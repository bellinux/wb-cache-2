In some cases,...ecological destruction could cost much more to repair than the investment to prevent it." [...] His comments reflected the impressions of many visitors to the country who observe a lack of proper waste management, poorly managed water supply and sanitation, and construction that damages the environment.|$|E
50|$|The Peruvian Amazon {{is divided}} into two areas: the High Jungle and the Lower Jungle. The High Jungle is more easily accessible, while the Lower Jungle is more {{pristine}} and untouched. In recent times, however, the government has increased accessibility to the Lower Jungle. Both areas contain an unrivaled diversity of animal and plant life. Large national preserves of interest to tourists include the Manú National Park, Rio Abiseo National Park, Pacaya Samiria National Reserve, and the Tambopata-Candamo Protected Area. Tourist agencies in these areas promote <b>eco-friendly</b> <b>tourism</b> to preserve the fragile ecosystems of the rainforest.|$|E
50|$|It is {{demanded that}} the Upper course of Ganges should be {{strictly}} disallowed any kind of damming and construction work. It should be declared a Wild River zone and visits by tourists and people to Gangotri National Park should also be regulated and toned down. <b>Eco-friendly</b> <b>tourism</b> should replace the present eco-hostile tourism. Time-bound steps for non-commercial afforestation of the Uttarakhand should be undertaken and these activities should be carried by the local people, using samplings of local plants. This demand was backed by a recent report prepared by the state-funded Wildlife Institute of India that recommended scrapping 34 of the Ganges dam projects, citing environmental concerns.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the benefits of}} the local communities across Natura 2000 sites. Human activities in these areas should take into account the economic, social, cultural, and environmental protection. It examines the most common problems encountered in forests, pastures and hayfields in the area of Natura 2000 sites. There are some examples of good practice exemplified by the activities of farmers living on the radius of Natura 2000 sites in different European countries. Natura 2000 sites are suitable for development of eco-tourism and agro-tourism based on tradition and organic products, which may lead to a brand. Tourism and specifically <b>eco-friendly</b> <b>tourism</b> industries (ecotourism, agrotourism, etc.) are encouraging development areas at regional and national Natura 2000 sites as a sustainable opportunity for people and nature...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{recent years}} {{there has been}} {{significant}} interest in modelling cumulative effects and the population consequences of individual changes in cetacean behaviour and physiology due to disturbance. One potential source of disturbance that has garnered particular interest is whale-watching. Though perceived as ‘green’ or <b>eco-friendly</b> <b>tourism,</b> there is evidence that whale-watching can result in statistically significant and biologically meaningful changes in cetacean behaviour, raising the question whether whale-watching is in fact a long term sustainable activity. However, an assessment of the impacts of whale-watching on cetaceans requires an understanding of the potential behavioural and physiological effects, data to effectively address the question and suitable modelling techniques. Here, we review the current state of knowledge on the viability of long-term whale-watching, as well as logistical limitations and potential opportunities. We conclude that an integrated, coordinated approach will be needed to further understanding of the possible effects of whale-watching on cetaceans...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT :The Neotiewpia Eco-Village {{is located}} within the Lim Chu Kang {{district}} at the north of Singapore. The Eco-Village only comprised of 3. 5 sq km. Meanwhile the area was dominated by farms, chalets and Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve. In 2006, National University of Singapore, School of Design and Environment (SDE), MSc. Environmental Management and Nature Society of Singapore initiated an ecological planning exercise within the Neotiewpia site to reduce the environmental impact from the development while providing <b>Eco-friendly</b> <b>Tourism</b> and R&D activities that feasible in the site. We did participate in the exercise and we tried explaining the ecological process, the limitation and potential development for integrated ecological planning framework in Developing Countries like Indonesia, Brazil, etc with high ecological-values ecosystems. The Vision of Neotiewpia was “A Model Eco-Village that Respects its Natural Heritage, Builds Strong Community Links and Promotes Economic Development on Nature’s Premises. " And Neotiewpia was successfully planned and designed with integrated ecological planning approach. It embraced the land evaluation and impact assessment. Further the plan was found feasible by the Singapore Government by earmarking the Lim Chu Kang and Kranji for Agri-tainment development in 2008 (although partially implemented). The Neotiewpia or Lim Chu Kang area was found thriving with Green-Economy and Agro-Tourism. This integrated ecological planning could be translated to other areas in Developing Countries with agriculture potential and facing development pressures such as Neotiewpia. This concept would give alternate Green-Solution to the current economic crisis...|$|E
40|$|The {{article is}} a {{synthesis}} of the DATOURWAY project which {{is a part of}} South Est Europe Program (2009 - 2012) and represents “an outstanding example of transnational cooperation” between partners from seven countries, from which six countries are touched by the Danube River. The cooperation within the project was committed to the development of tourism along and on the middle and south-eastern section of river Danube, while paying particular attention to the protection and enhancement of the natural and cultural resources linked to this part of River. National Institute for Research and Development in Construction, Urban Planning and Sustainable Spatial Develoment ”URBAN-INCERC”, through “Urbanproiect Branch”, {{has been one of the}} Romanian partners in the DATOURWAY project, together with The National Institute for Research and Development in Tourism and the Ministry of Regional Development and Tourism. “URBANPROIECT” has mainly contributed to the National Analysis and Strategy concerning Romanian territory and two Pilot-Projects: PiP 3 – “Vidin-Calafat” (Romania and Bulgaria) regarding city tourism and rural neighborhood, and PiP 4 – “Deltas” (Romania-Italy) regarding <b>eco-friendly</b> <b>tourism</b> development of river Danube and Po deltas. The DATOURWAY project has been a “contribution to sustainable territorial development and has reflected a common strategic interest by setting a common future approach in the field of tourist development, focusing mainly on the rural areas, by elaborating a set of mutually agreed tourist strategies and implementing different pilot projects tailored to special areas”...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} aims {{to analyse}} the balancing act between tourism {{and the environment}} in the Maasai Mara National Reserve, and assess its impacts in relation to sustainable tourism. Furthermore, the researcher will analyse how tourism wildlife laws have changed from 1930 to present, {{and the evolution of}} the relationship between tourists, local people (Maasai) and wildlife in the area. The main objectives of this dissertation are to make different stakeholders in Maasai Mara aware of: - How Maasai Mara's tourist attractions can be managed and utilised on a socially, environmentally and ecologically sustainable basis, using Mara Serena Safari Lodge as an example. - How much of the revenue from tourism trickles down to local people at the grassroots level. - How the awareness in sustainable development and the participation of the local community will ensure a good quality <b>eco-friendly</b> <b>tourism</b> product. The findings show that striking a balance between the expansions of tourism, stopping degradation of the Maasai Mara, saving the wildlife and leaving the local pastoralist community's lifestyle intact is probably the greatest challenge facing conservation in the game reserve. However, this research has proven that the MMNR needs more private help in the management of the reserve, for example, from European Game Wardens and external funding mostly from World Wildlife Fund for Nature, International Union for the Conservation of Nature and National Resources. Thus, the future of MMNR lies {{in the hands of a}} better management system that is needed by the County Councils. Furthermore, this research has shown that tourism is not just a narrow business world where the key social actors are the tourists and the tourism providers, but other stakeholders, like host communities, that should be given a greater voice whether they are positively engaged in the business of tourism or not...|$|E
40|$|Unlike a {{majority}} of Caribbean islands, the inhabitants of Utila in the Bay Islands of Honduras came there by choice. As a result, they have handcrafted a society where the key to harmony and avoiding confrontation is “live and let live”. In addition, they harbor a fierce sense of independence from Honduras, maintaining their allegiance to the formerly British Western Caribbean. Despite sharing a limited space the community is still divided racially and economically {{much as it was}} 150 years ago, and common property, the reef and surrounding waters were a shared resource whose management was adhered to through an unspoken understanding, much like the social relations on land. A surge of immigration from the mainland of Honduras in the 1990 ’s is neither welcomed nor confronted, despite the newcomers’ lack of cultural education about their new surroundings. The complacency to one another coupled with the sense of freedom endowed to themselves from their “Spanish rule”, has created a stagnancy in regards to environmental protection, so that even solving a visible issue such as trash management and education is a major hurdle. This inaction does not couple well with the Honduran government opening up the Bay Islands to create a “tourism free zone”, giving unprecedented access to land and goods to foreign investors. In recent years the tourist trends have shifted from traditional backpacking to <b>eco-friendly</b> <b>tourism,</b> which {{in the context of the}} Utila is everything from volunteering for beach trash clean-ups to diving courses. These trends have further exacerbated the local inclination to autonomy, and serve to alienate locals from their own management. For a significant part of the population the perception of their resources is still fluid and limitless, despite strong scientific evidence to the contrary. This rift in knowledge creates another barrier to understanding and salvage efforts. Despite all these rip currents at force, local actors still move forward to better their community. Through the unique language of the Caribbean steps are being made towards local action...|$|E
40|$|Proyecto de Graduación (Maestría en Gerencia de Proyectos) Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica, Área Académica Gerencia de Proyectos, 2011. Due to {{multiple}} factors, Coto Brus County has been classified {{as one of}} the poorest counties in Costa Rica, although it has a great potential to act towards the natural resources of the area. Considering this, there is an opportunity to develop a three stars hotel focused in <b>eco-friendly</b> <b>tourism.</b> This will have a positive impact in the population and will certainly generate earnings for the investors. In order to achieve all the desired benefits in the project of the three star hotel in San Vito de Coto Brus, it is necessary to develop a plan for the implementation that guarantees the fulfillment of all the needs and expectations of the developers. Thus, the general objective of this project is to develop a plan for the implementation of a three star hotel, located in San Vito de Coto Brus, using the PRINCE 2 ® project management methodology. In addition, the following specific objectives were set up:  Establish the prerequisites in order to decide if the project is worthwhile and if it has a solid rationale.  Set the solid foundations for the project plan, taking into account all the work that must be done to deliver the project.  Establish the product delivery plan and the acceptance criteria, so that the outcome of every project stage is successful.  Establish the closure plan to provide a fixed point at which acceptance for the project products is confirmed. This is a descriptive investigation, based on primary and secondary sources. Subjects, main activities and tools to gather information where defined in order to accomplish every specific objective As one of the main conclusions, the PRINCE 2 ® is a process-based structured project management methodology focused on product delivery. The project plan includes all the key elements to ensure that the expectations and client requirements are fulfilled. As a recommendation, project management according to PRINCE 2 ® must be tailored to project factors and the complexity of its processes, in order to avoid becoming a template-driven project. The final recommendation is that all the information regarding to the current legislation, costs, schedule, project products, strategies, tolerances, and exceptions, must be updated at the stage of project launching.
