40|$|Identification of low-velocity <b>impacts</b> to {{composite}} structures {{has become increasingly}} important in the aerospace industry. Knowing when <b>impacts</b> have occurred would allow inspections to be scheduled only when necessary, and knowing the approximate <b>impact</b> location would allow for a localized search, saving time and expense. Additionally, an estimation of the <b>impact</b> magnitude {{could be used for}} damage prediction. This study experimentally investigated a methodology for <b>impact</b> identification. To achieve the approach, the following issues were covered in this study: <b>impact</b> detecting; signal processing; feature extractioon; <b>impact</b> identification. In <b>impact</b> detection, them smart stuctures, two piezoelectric sensors embedded in {{composite structures}}, are designed to measure <b>impact</b> signals caused by foreign object <b>impact</b> events. The <b>impact</b> signals were stored in computer system memory through the <b>impact</b> monitoring system developed in this study. In signal processing, the cross correlation method was used to process the measured <b>impact</b> signals. This processing built the correlation between the <b>impact</b> signals and location of <b>impacts</b> as well as <b>impact</b> magnitude. In feature extraction, the initial feature data were gained from the cross correlation results through the point and segmentation processing. thie final feature data were selected from the initial feature data with a fuzzy clustering method. In <b>impact</b> identification, the adaptive deuro fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) were built with the feature data to identify abscissas of <b>impact</b> location, ordinates of <b>impact</b> location and <b>impact</b> magnitude. The parameters of the ANFISs were refined with a hybrid learning rule i. e. the combination of the Least Square Estimation and the Steepest Descent algorithm. Real time software developed in Visual Basic code manipulated the monitoring and control system for the <b>impact</b> experiments.
