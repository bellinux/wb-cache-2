50|$|The name ‘Parvalux’ {{derives from}} the latin 'parvulus' and 'lux' and means 'young light', {{alluding}} to the hopes that founder Leslie J. Clark had for the Romford-based business where he first began selling motor rewinds in 1947. After relocating to Bournemouth in 1957, the company moved from simply re-winding motors to designing and manufacturing complete <b>gear-motor</b> units for industrial applications.|$|E

Its head and neck access 6 degrees of freedom. It moves using differential steering with two high-torque EC <b>gear-motors,</b> and runs Ubuntu 9.10 on a 1.6Ghz Intel Core Duo. It stands 1.5 m tall and weighs 85 kg. A new, fresh battery allows it to run freely for eight hours.|$|R

Premised upon {{the concept of}} time-frequency (TF) reassignment, SST provides a sharp representation of signals in TF plane compared to many popular TF methods. Additionally, it can also extract the individual components, called intrinsic mode functions or IMFs, of a non-stationary multi-component signal, akin to empirical mode decomposition. The rich mathematical structure based on continuous wavelet transform makes SST a promising candidate for gearbox diagnosis. This work utilizes the decomposing power of SST to extract the IMFs from gearbox signals. For robust detection of faults in <b>gear-motors,</b> a fault detection technique based on time-varying autoregressive coefficients of IMFs as features is utilized. Sequential Karhunen-Loeve transform is employed on the condition indicators to select the appropriate window sizes on which SST can be applied. Laboratory experimental data obtained from drivetrain diagnostics simulator provides test bed to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed algorithm...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to demonstrate the design and construction of an innovative active gear-shift and clutch for racecars, applied to a Formula Student car, based on the use of DC <b>gear-motors.</b> Racecars require extremely quick gear-shifts and every system to be as light as possible. The proposed solution is designed to reduce energy consumption, weight and improve gear-shift precision compared to traditionally employed electro-hydraulic solutions, although maintaining state of the art performances. The proposed gear motor actuation satisfies all the above objectives: energy can be saved by removing the need for power when clutch is not pulled, thus improving efficiency; by substituting the entire electro-hydraulic-systems, that accounts for approx. 5 % of the overall car weight (10 kg); a significant weight reduction is achieved (weight is reduced to 2 kg); a fine actuation force modulation, in order to properly shift to neutral, can easily obtained with an DC electric motor; and, above all, shifting time is less than 20 ms. System modeling, regulator design, based on PI-control, and simulation were carried out. Electronics, both signal and power, micro-controller based design and program coding, written in C language, were the next steps. Finally, accurate tests to validate the solution and assess performances were carried out...|$|R
