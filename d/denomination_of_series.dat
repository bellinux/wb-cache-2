50|$|Fifteen <b>denominations</b> <b>of</b> the <b>series</b> {{were placed}} on sale by post offices on Monday, January 2, 1893. They were {{available}} nationwide, and were not restricted to the Exposition in any way. This was {{a larger number of}} stamps than the United States Post Office had ever offered in a definite series, thanks to the unprecedented inclusion of stamps denominated $1, $2, $3, $4 and $5: no U. S. postage stamp previously issued had cost more than 90¢. A sixteenth stamp—- 8 cents, to provide for the newly lowered registered letter fee—- was added during March. As a result, the face value of the complete set was $16.34, a substantial sum of money during 1893. In approximate 2009 dollars, the set would cost almost $390. As a result, of the most expensive stamps, especially the dollar values, only a small number were sold. Unsold stamps were destroyed after the Columbian Issue was removed from sale on April 12, 1894. In all, the American Banknote Company printed more than 2 billion Columbian stamps with a total face value exceeding $40 million.|$|R

25|$|In {{keeping with}} the quest for {{simplicity}} the original design concept was not for a Washington-Franklin series, but for a series devoted exclusively to Washington, with all its near-identical stamps exhibiting the same image of the first United States President—they would differ from one another only in denomination and color. This idea originated with one Charles H. Dalton of Boston, who, {{in a letter to}} his Senator, Winthrop M. Crane, expressed admiration for the current British stamps, all of which employed the same profile portrait of King Edward VII. Dalton recommended that the next U.S. series be similarly uniform, with every one of its stamps presenting the same profile head of Washington found on the 2¢ <b>denomination</b> <b>of</b> the 1894 First Bureau Issue. The senator passed this letter on to the Postmaster General, George Meyer, who by and large followed Dalton’s recommendation. Full uniformity, however, would have violated a long-standing postal tradition dating back to 1851, which had placed Franklin on every definitive one-cent stamp issued by the U.S. Post Office. It may have been for this reason that Franklin was admitted to the 1908 series in the single case of the one-cent stamp. The Washington-Franklin series resulting from this compromise was designed by the renowned artist Clair Aubrey Houston, known for his many postage stamp designs. Most <b>denominations</b> <b>of</b> the 1902–03 <b>series</b> had been identical in color to their counterparts in the preceding First Bureau Issue. By contrast, the Washington-Franklin set preserved the previous colors only for its five lowest values: new and very different colors were chosen for all <b>denominations</b> <b>of</b> 6-cents and higher.|$|R
