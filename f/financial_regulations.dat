5|$|A country's {{decision}} to operate an open economy and globalize its financial capital carries monetary implications {{captured by the}} balance of payments. It also renders exposure to risks in international finance, such as political deterioration, regulatory changes, foreign exchange controls, and legal uncertainties for property rights and investments. Both individuals and groups may participate in the global financial system. Consumers and international businesses undertake consumption, production, and investment. Governments and intergovernmental bodies act as purveyors of international trade, economic development, and crisis management.

A single nation with functioning governance, <b>financial</b> <b>regulations,</b> deposit insurance, emergency financing through discount windows, standard accounting practices, and established legal and disclosure procedures, can itself develop and grow a healthy domestic financial system. In a global context however, no central political authority exists which can extend these arrangements globally. Rather, governments have cooperated {{to establish a}} host of institutions and practices that have evolved over time and are referred to collectively as the international financial architecture. Within this architecture, regulatory authorities such as national governments and intergovernmental organizations {{have the capacity to}} influence international financial markets. National governments may employ their finance ministries, treasuries, and regulatory agencies to impose tariffs and foreign capital controls or may use their central banks to execute a desired intervention in the open markets.|$|E

25|$|The expiry of the Malaysian New Economic Policy (NEP) in 1990 gave Mahathir the {{opportunity}} to outline his economic vision for Malaysia. In 1991, he announced Vision 2020, under which Malaysia would aim to become a fully developed country within 30 years. The target would require average economic growth of approximately seven per cent {{of gross domestic product}} per annum. One of Vision 2020's features would be to gradually break down ethnic barriers. Vision 2020 was accompanied by the NEP's replacement, the National Development Policy (NDP), under which some government programs designed to benefit the bumiputera exclusively were opened up to other ethnicities. The NDP achieved success out one of its main aims, poverty reduction. By 1995, less than nine per cent of Malaysians lived in poverty and income inequality had narrowed. Mahathir's government cut corporate taxes and liberalised <b>financial</b> <b>regulations</b> to attract foreign investment. The economy grew by over nine per cent per annum until 1997 prompting other developing countries to try to emulate Mahathir's policies. Much of the credit for Malaysia's economic development in the 1990s went to Anwar Ibrahim, appointed by Mahathir as finance minister in 1991. The government rode the economic wave and won the 1995 election with an increased majority.|$|E

40|$|Book synopsis: The {{financial}} {{system and its}} regulation have undergone exponential growth and dramatic reform over the last thirty years. This period has witnessed major developments in the nature and intensity of financial markets, as well as repeated cycles of regulatory reform and development, often linked to crisis conditions. The recent financial crisis has led to unparalleled interest in <b>financial</b> <b>regulation</b> from policymakers, economists, legal practitioners, and the academic community, and has prompted large-scale regulatory reform. The Oxford Handbook of <b>Financial</b> <b>Regulation</b> is the first comprehensive, authoritative, and state-of-the-art account {{of the nature of}} <b>financial</b> <b>regulation.</b> Written by an international team of leading scholars in the field, it takes a contextual and comparative approach to examine scholarly, policy, and regulatory developments in the past three decades. The first three Parts of the Handbook address the underpinning horizontal themes which arise in financial regulation: {{financial system}}s and regulation; the organization of <b>financial</b> system <b>regulation,</b> including regional examples from the EU and the US; and the delivery of outcomes and regulatory techniques. The final three Parts address the major reoccurring objectives of <b>financial</b> <b>regulation,</b> widely regarded as the anchors of <b>financial</b> <b>regulation</b> internationally: <b>financial</b> stability; market efficiency, integrity, and transparency; and consumer protection. The Oxford Handbook of <b>Financial</b> <b>Regulation</b> will be an invaluable resource for scholars and students of <b>financial</b> <b>regulation,</b> and for economists, policy-makers and regulators...|$|R
40|$|<b>Financial</b> <b>regulation</b> {{in sports}} is usually {{discussed}} {{in the context of}} representing an instrument against "financial doping". Notwithstanding the merits of this discussion, this paper takes the opposite perspective and analyses how market-internal <b>financial</b> <b>regulation</b> itself may anticompetitively influence sporting results. Virtually every regulative financial intervention distorts sporting competition to some extent and creates beneficiaries and losers. Sometimes, the actual winners and losers of <b>financial</b> <b>regulation</b> stand in line with the (legitimate) goals of the <b>regulation</b> like limiting <b>financial</b> imbalances or preventing distortive midseason insolvencies of teams. However, <b>financial</b> <b>regulation</b> may also display unintended side-effects like protecting hitherto successful teams from new challengers, cementing the competitive order, creating foreclosure and entry barriers, or serving vested interests of powerful parties. All of these effects may also be hidden agendas by those who are implementing and enforcing market-internal <b>financial</b> <b>regulation</b> or influencing it. This paper analyses various types of budget caps (including salary caps) with respect to potentially anticompetitive effects. UEFA's so-called <b>Financial</b> Fair Play <b>Regulations</b> are highlighted as an example. Furthermore, the paper discusses allocation schemes of common revenues (like from the collective sale of broadcasting rights) as another area of <b>financial</b> <b>regulation</b> with potentially anticompetitive effects. Eventually, the effects of standards for accounting, financial management, and auditing are discussed...|$|R
