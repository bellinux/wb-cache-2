50|$|Basti Gallaga (Oyo Sotto), a happy-go-lucky rich kid, meets charming barrio lass, Almira Castelo (Valerie Concepcion), in an ancestral {{house in}} the {{province}} called Bahay na Bato (stone house).

Both of them have <b>individual</b> <b>commitments,</b> Basti to Rachel (Iya Villania) and Almira to Emil (Andrew Schimmer), her childhood sweetheart. Yet, their love for each other proves strong enough to motivate them to break their current relationship so that they can pursue their newfound love. Basti and Almira decided to break up with their respective commitments and vowed to see each other in the ancestral house to continue their love for one another. But Almira’s break up with Emil was tragic that led to her death.|$|E
5000|$|In 2011, the Rudd Center {{published}} {{a study in}} the journal Public Health Nutrition suggesting that additional government regulation of front-of-package labeling is needed to protect consumers. Through an online survey, researchers asked parents with {{children between the ages of}} 2 and 11 to view images of actual box fronts of children's cereals. While the cereals were of below-average nutritional quality, the boxes featured various nutrition-related health claims including 'whole grain', 'fiber', 'calcium and vitamin D', 'organic' and 'supports your child's immunity'. Participants were provided with possible meanings for these claims and indicated how the claims would affect their willingness to buy the product. Parents inferred that cereals containing claims were more nutritious overall and might provide specific health-related benefits for their children, which predicted a greater willingness to buy the cereals.According to John Bode, to expect for the food industry to voluntarily stop marketing junk to children is unrealistic and therefore makes no sense. However, Food industry advocates claim the industry is heavily regulated and if we start adding stricter regulations then the consumer is ultimately denied choice. The way that food industry [...] markets food and perceive different categories of food has worsened the body images of the American population. Our food environment has continually increased our populations' weight, appearance standards have remained severe, more people are dieting, more people are fighting their bodies, and more people have perverted relationships with food.Due to rising global concerns about the increasing occurrence of childhood overweight and obesity, the World Health Organization and the Institute of Medicine have both called on the private sector to address these problems. The Rudd Center has debuted a database for pledges on food marketing to children; listed in the Rudd Center database are the voluntary pledges issued by food and beverage companies to change marketing of foods and non-alcoholic beverages to children. To persuade the food industry to self-regulate, the Rudd Center organized a pledge initiative in which participants, many major global food and beverage companies, in conjunction with industry trade organizations, have issued voluntary pledges to change marketing of foods and non-alcoholic beverages to children.O Rudd makes available on its website a database that lists and describes these pledges, making publicly available the specific criteria each pledge or company uses to define their restrictions on marketing communications to children, including the definition of [...] "children" [...] (age); the definition of marketing directed at children (child-directed media); the communications channels (e.g. television, Internet, etc.) and marketing techniques (ex. advertising using licensed characters, advertising using promotional materials, etc.) covered. The self-regulation includes all participating companies. Most of the pledges* require participating companies to publish <b>individual</b> <b>commitments</b> to the pledges**, which may contain more stringent definitions than specified in the pledges. A minority of pledges do not require commitments from participating companies. In these cases the criteria set out in the pledge cover all members. On the other hand , according to Elaine Kolish, vice president of the Childrens Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative (CFBAI) states that it is wholly inappropriate for government regulation. She claims that, [...] " [...] products being sold to children are legal" [...] , it is the adults (parents) who are buying the products. Participants include such global food corporations as Mondelez International, Nestle, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, McDonald's, Pizza Hut, and Parmalat.|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{mediating}} effects of <b>individual</b> <b>commitment</b> and social networks on the relationship between project communication and perceived project performance. Many citizenship projects frequently fail to deliver on time, budget, specifications, and quality or do not deliver value to the public. This could be attributed to ineffective project communication, lack of <b>individual</b> <b>commitment</b> and inadequate social networks. Design/methodology/approach–A theoretical model and hypotheses are developed from literature review. A cross sectional data set collected from 322 project stakeholders from Uganda is used to validate the model. Findings – Structural Equation Modelling results reveal that <b>individual</b> <b>commitment</b> and social networks mediate the relationship between project communication and perceived project performance. The results also suggest that social networks elements have a stronger influence towards project performance than <b>individual</b> <b>commitment</b> elements. Research limitations/implications – The study focuses on behavioural constructs as predictors of perceived project performance. Although these constructs are robust and sufficiently represent the human aspects, the multidimensional nature of behavioural practises can be investigated further. Similarly, since perceived projec...|$|R

40|$|Sociologists {{have long}} sought to {{understand}} the relationship between collective experi-ences and <b>individual</b> <b>commitments.</b> This article examines the short-term mission as an institutionalized religious experience, assessing its prevalence, predictors and impact on the religious trajectories of the youth who participate in them. Religiously devout adolescents are more likely than others to go on a short-term mission as are younger adolescents and those with very religious parents. Applying propensity score matching to a nationally rep-resentative longitudinal sample of American adolescents, we find that adolescents who go on a short-term mission between interview waves report increased religious participation and solidified religious beliefs. We use the example of this experience to emphasize the importance of considering religious experiences to develop more nuanced understandings of the way religion shapes the beliefs and behaviors of individuals. Sociologists have long sought {{to understand the}} relationship between collective experiences and <b>individual</b> <b>commitments.</b> An early attempt at such understand-ing can be found in Durkheim’s Elementary Forms of Religious Life (1902 / 2001), which argued that the social organization of religious life would lead to particula...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} Communication and Performance explores how communicational {{structures}} impact {{the performance of}} innovation teams. Communication is particular important in teams in which members with different specializations and professional backgrounds have to execute the work together as it is common in innovation teams. This book argues that communicational structures influence the performance of innovation teams through three mediating factors, <b>individual</b> creativity, <b>individual</b> <b>commitment</b> and team discensus. It is shown that team discensus, or the conflict potential in teams, relates positively to team performance {{in the beginning of}} an innovation process, however negatively in the end of an innovation process. Individual creativity and <b>individual</b> <b>commitment</b> always foster the performance of innovation teams. Moreover, the study indicates that communicational structures indeed impact team performance via <b>individual</b> creativity, <b>individual</b> <b>commitment</b> and team discensus and that in order to improve the performance of teams a managerial focus on the team as a entity is more promising than focusing on single individuals in the team. Further, three managerial tools are introduced and explored that are useful for managing the structures of communication. These managerial tools are computer-mediated means of communication, physical proximity of the team members, and team composition. Altogether, this PhD thesis provides a tool and managerial knowledge for analyzing and navigating the structures of communication toward a better performance. ...|$|R

Following this approach, we reach the conclusion that federalism must be understood as a matter of political identity.

40|$|This paper unifies {{two recent}} strands of {{research}} in multiagent system design. One, commitments are widely recognized as capturing important aspects of interactions among agents, but current approaches tend to emphasize <b>individual</b> <b>commitments</b> and typically restrict themselves to interactions between pairs of agents. Two, methodologies for multiagent system design tend to consider protocols and coordination requirements among agents, but do not seriously accommodate commitments. This paper proposes a methodology to infer commitments from an example conversation among various parties. Based on the conversation, we first build a commitment causality diagram indicating the causal relations among the commitments. Using this diagram, we generate behavior models for each role. We show that models produced by this approach successfully capture commitment-level protocols and allow flexible implementation of non-commitment communications {{as long as the}} commitment causal relations are followed...|$|E
