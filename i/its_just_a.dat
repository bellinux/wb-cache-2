5000|$|Chase a Crooked Shadow {{received}} mixed reviews. Bosley Crowther in {{his review}} for The New York Times considered the plot as overly complex and torturous, but that the melodrama was [...] "nothing amazing, and neither is this film. <b>Its</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> moderately well-done program picture, endowed {{with a couple of}} standard thrills." ...|$|E

5000|$|Cats {{are quite}} anti-social animals in human eyes, preferring {{to go out}} and mind their own business. Since cats hunt mice, a much smaller animal, humans sympathy has always gone to the mouse rather than the cat, despite mice being {{considered}} vermin by most people. A cruel game where the hunter teases his victim before finally striking him is called a [...] "cat-and-mouse game" [...] in many languages. The concept is based on the behavior that real cats often display before killing their prey and which is often misunderstood as cruel torture. In reality <b>its</b> <b>just</b> <b>an</b> instinctive imperative to make sure their prey is weak enough to be killed.|$|R

She and Jagger then repeat the line [...] "Its just a shot away" [...] and finish with repeats of [...] "Its just a kiss away." [...] When speaking of her inclusion in the recording, Jagger stated in the 2003 book According to the Rolling Stones: [...] "The use of the female voice was the producers idea. It {{would be one of}} those moments along the lines of I hear a girl on this track - get one on the phone." [...] Summoned—pregnant—from bed around midnight by producer Jack Nitzsche, Clayton made her recording with just a few takes then returned home to bed.

5000|$|Before {{moving on}} to the formal {{description}} of a QFA, there are two noteworthy generalizations that should be mentioned and understood. The first is the non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA). In this case, the vector q is replaced by a vector which can have more than one entry that is non-zero. Such a vector then represents an element of the power set of Q; <b>its</b> <b>just</b> <b>an</b> indicator function on Q. Likewise, the state transition matrices [...] are defined {{in such a way that}} a given column can have several non-zero entries in it. After each application of , though, the column vector q must be renormalized so that it only contains zeros and ones. Equivalently, the multiply-add operations performed during component-wise matrix multiplication should be replaced by Boolean and-or operations, that is, so that one is working with a ring of characteristic 2.|$|R

5000|$|While {{some have}} {{suggested}} that the refrain of the song refers to nuclear fallout, Dylan disputes that this was a specific reference.
