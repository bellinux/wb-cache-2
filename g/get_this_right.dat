500|$|Hordern {{viewed the}} 1950s {{as a good}} decade to appear in film, {{although}} he did not then particularly care for the medium. Writing in 1993 he said: [...] "With cinema one has to leap into battle fully armed. From the start of the film the character has to be pinned down like a butterfly on a board. One does not always <b>get</b> <b>this</b> <b>right,</b> of course, sometimes starting at the beginning of shooting a film on a comedic level that cannot be sustained." [...] He disliked his physical appearance, which he found to be [...] "repulsive", and as a result loathed watching back his performances. He preferred radio because the audience only heard his voice, which he then considered his best attribute. Another reason was his recognition of the differences between his sense of personal achievement within a theatre compared to that on a film set: [...] "You get a certain sort of satisfaction in delivering what the director wants of you, but the chances of being emotionally involved are slim." [...] He acknowledged his good ability at learning lines, something which he found to be especially helpful for learning film scripts which frequently changed. [...] He enjoyed the challenge of earning as much value as possible out of a scene and revelled in being able to hit [...] "the right mark for the camera". With the experience of Nina still fresh in his mind, Hordern took a break from the stage and decided to concentrate on his film career.|$|E

2500|$|Duncan Smith {{has said}} that tighter {{immigration}} controls are vital if Britain is to avoid [...] "losing another generation to dependency and hopelessness". In a speech delivered in Spain he said that only immigrants with [...] "something to offer" [...] should be allowed into the country and that too often foreign workers purporting to be skilled take low-skilled jobs that could be occupied by British school leavers. [...] According to The Daily Telegraphs analysis, the speech contained a warning to David Cameron [...] "that a 'slack' attitude to immigration {{will result in the}} Coalition repeating the mistakes made under Labour, when the vast majority of new jobs generated before the recession were taken by immigrants". Duncan Smith believes that some companies are using immigration as [...] "an excuse to import labour to take up posts which could be filled by people already in Britain". He says Britain needs an immigration system that gives the unemployed [...] "a level playing field". [...] "If we do not <b>get</b> <b>this</b> <b>right</b> then we risk leaving more British citizens out of work, and the most vulnerable group who will be the most affected are young people," [...] he said.|$|E

[...] And you will sing it with respect!" [...] Revelli brought out a pitch pipe and began the instructions. [...] “You sing from down in here, in your diaphragm. [...] You bring it up from down here with feeling.” [...] Then he blew the starting note on his pitch pipe. [...] The players started, [...] "Hail to the Victors, valiant –" [...] Revelli interrupted, “No, No, No! [...] That’s terrible!

Mitzeee {{was in prison}} for the {{stabbing}} of Mercedes McQueen (Jennifer Metcalfe), Fox explained that Nancy has [...] "always known her friend was innocent" [...] as she knows that she is not capable of stabbing Mercedes. Nancy knows Mercedes has set Mitzeee up as she has threatened her on a couple of occasions, even saying [...] "something bad might happen to Nancy's baby if she doesn't get her nose out and that's made Nancy more determined". Fox said that Nancy's attitude towards Mitzeee's situation stems from when Becca was wrongly accused, sent to prison and murdered in jail which makes her [...] "really desperate to <b>get</b> <b>this</b> <b>right</b> for Mitzeee - to get her out and take Mercedes down!" [...] Explaining why Nancy and Mitzeee are such good friends, Fox said: [...] "They're such different people on the surface, but deep down Ann Minniver - Mitzeee's alter ego - is very moral, kind and caring and she's a very clever girl. I think those are all things that Nancy responds to and enjoys. Also, I think Mitzeee just makes Nancy laugh. Mitzeee can be a bit silly sometimes, and that makes Nancy smile". During the storyline, Nancy feuds with Mercedes. Fox said that Nancy has a bit of a [...] "bad girl" [...] in her which she shows during her confrontations with Mercedes, adding that the character has got [...] "more fire in her belly than maybe we'd realised".|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Are {{reasons for}} action facts or {{psychological}} states? There are two answers {{in the literature}} on the ontology of reasons. According to the Standard Story, normative reasons are facts, while motivating reasons are psychological states. According to the factualist, both normative and motivating reasons are facts. In this paper I argue that neither of these views is satisfactory. The Standard Story errs in thinking that the two kinds of reasons are different ontological entities. The factualist <b>gets</b> <b>this</b> <b>right,</b> but incurs some distasteful ontological commitments by thinking of motivating reasons as facts. We should, thus, give a proper hearing to the only serious logically possible alternative to the two existing views: both motivating and normative reasons are psychological states...|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} decade {{there has been a}} notable shift in South African {{education}} policy that raises the value of school leadership as a lever for learning improvements. Despite a growing discourse on school leadership, there has been a lack of empirical based evidence on principals to inform, validate or debate the efficacy of proposed policies in raising the calibre of school principals. Drawing on findings from a larger study to understand the labour market for school principals in South Africa, this paper highlights four overarching characteristics of this market with implications for informing principal policy reforms. The paper notes that improving the design and implementation of policies guiding the appointment process for principals is a matter of urgency. A substantial and increasing number of principal replacements are taking place across South African schools given a rising age profile of school principals. In a context of low levels of principal mobility and high tenure, the leadership trajectory of the average school is established for nearly a decade with each principal replacement. Evidence-based policy making has a strong role to play in <b>getting</b> <b>this</b> <b>right...</b>|$|R
