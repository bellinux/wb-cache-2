5|$|With this tour, I'm {{going to}} be working on some {{different}} arrangements for some of the older songs, to... <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more life to them. That's not to say they're going to sound totally different and to freak anybody out... I love re-singing songs to different music. I genuinely want to tour with these new songs, as well as older hits. These new songs mean so much to me, this time of my life has been so wonderful for me, and I want to experience that with my fans.|$|E
500|$|... and <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{performance}} twist, I'll {{bring that}} album cover to life, so it's {{going to be}} really fun. I can't give too much away about the songs, but it's definitely going to represent the album because the album is very multilayered. It doesn't represent 'Your Body' as a single tone. It has its ballads; and everything comes from a very sincere, deeprooted place whether it's having fun or being vulnerable.|$|E
2500|$|But he {{believed}} that the United States may be able to change Iran without using military force: [...] "Iran might fall of its own weight if we <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> help. We're not doing nearly enough to get communications in there. There are riots ... that are seldom reported, but they're taking place all over the country nowadays. Their inflation is up; unemployment is up." [...] By encouraging the people of Iran and using our intelligence resources {{we may be able to}} help bring about a regime change.|$|E

6000|$|She {{stopped the}} engine, beamed at him--there in the dust, on the quiet hilltop. He said as apologetically {{as though he}} had been at fault, [...] "Distributor got dry. Might <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> oil about once in six months." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your idea is an {{excellent}} one, Mr. Coulson," [...] he said. [...] "It has already been mooted, but we will <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> emphasis. Tomorrow we will offer a reward of one thousand pounds for any information leading to the apprehension of either murderer." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{felt her}} hand {{trembling}} in my hand, and <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> encouraging squeeze. [...] "Let us judge him," [...] I suggested, [...] "by {{what he says}} and does, on finding us together." ...|$|R
60|$|Rachel {{was silent}} for a moment. Sitting close behind her, I heard her sigh. Mr. Bruff took her hand, and <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> squeeze. She {{recovered}} herself, and answered Mr. Ablewhite as boldly as ever.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} me <b>a</b> <b>little</b> curiously. From the first her own {{demeanor}} had been singularly unmoved. During the last few seconds, however, she had grown paler. She suddenly {{took my hand and}} <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> squeeze.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I think I {{shall have}} to <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{publicity}} too,' said Woodhouse. 'We can't {{have this kind of}} thing going on, you know.' His face was set and quite white. Pallant's, on the other hand, was black, and I know that my very stomach had turned with rage. Ollyett was dum.|$|E
60|$|An Emir {{had bought}} a left eye of a glass eye-maker, supposing {{that he would be}} able to see with it. The man begged him to <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> time: he could not expect that it would see all at once as well as the right eye, which had been for so many years in the habit of it.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You needn't mind {{sending up}} to me, {{if the child}} cries, nurse,' said the surgeon, putting on his gloves with great deliberation. 'It's very likely it will be troublesome. <b>Give</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> gruel if it is.' He put on his hat, and, pausing by the bed-side {{on his way to}} the door, added, 'She was a good-looking girl, too; where did she come from?' ...|$|E
60|$|She {{fastened}} {{the paper}} to the thread again, and <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> twitch. She waited for the low note of laughter which did not fail to flutter down from above; then she threw herself upon the bed, and fell asleep.|$|R
6000|$|... "I tried," [...] said Mrs. Wragge, {{with a fresh}} {{burst of}} tears--"but she only opened the door far enough to put out her hand. I took and <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> squeeze--and, oh poor soul, it felt so cold in mine!" ...|$|R
60|$|She put a detaining {{hand through}} his arm again and <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> gentle squeeze. <b>A</b> huge feather almost rested on his shoulder, and the scent of eau-de-Cologne assailed his nostrils. He walked on in silent amazement at finding himself in such a position.|$|R
60|$|I trust, {{upon the}} whole, {{that it is}} not so: I am sure that Mr. Redgrave and Mr. Cole do not at all include results of this kind in their {{conception}} of the ultimate objects of the institution which owes so much to their strenuous and well-directed exertions. And I have put this painful question before you, only that we may face it thoroughly, and, as I hope, out-face it. If you will <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> sincere attention this evening, I trust we may find sufficiently good reasons for our work, and proceed to it hereafter, as all good workmen should do, with clear heads, and calm consciences.|$|E
6000|$|... [Footnote 2: This {{lady was}} of ancient family in Yorkshire, and {{particularly}} admired by the author's friend Mr. Walsh, who having celebrated {{her in a}} Pastoral Elegy, desired his friend to do the same, as appears {{from one of his}} letters, dated Sept. 9, 1706. [...] "Your last Eclogue being on the same subject with mine on Mrs. Tempest's death, I should take it very kindly in you to <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> turn, as if it were to the memory of the same lady." [...] Her death having happened {{on the night of the}} great storm in 1703, gave a propriety to this Eclogue, which in its general turn alludes to it. The scene of the Pastoral lies in a grove, the time at midnight.--POPE.|$|E
60|$|Bellston {{showed his}} {{gratification}} {{by one of}} his angry-pleasant flushes--he had hardly dared to ask for what she proffered freely; and having requested Nicholas to take the dairyman's daughter, led Christine to her place, Long promptly stepping up second with his charge. There were grim silent depths in Nic's character; a small deedy spark in his eye, as it caught Christine's, was all that showed his consciousness of her. Then the fiddlers began--the celebrated Mellstock fiddlers who, given free stripping, could play from sunset to dawn without turning a hair. The couples wheeled and swung, Nicholas taking Christine's hand in the course of business with the figure, when she waited for him to <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> squeeze; but he did not.|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{had your}} {{going back to}} Harvard to do with it? If your mother thinks I'm with her in that, she'll think I'm {{with her in the}} other. And I'm not. I'm with you." [...] She let her hand find his, as they walked side by side, and <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> pressure.|$|R
6000|$|Instead {{of helping}} me up, {{the poor thing}} stole her hand into mine, and <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> squeeze. She tried hard to keep from crying again, and succeeded--for which I {{respected}} her. [...] "You're very kind, Mr. Betteredge," [...] she said. [...] "I don't want any dinner to-day--let me bide <b>a</b> <b>little</b> longer here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Se√±or Don Almirante," [...] said Sancho, {{who took}} the helm, <b>giving</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> play to feel his command of <b>it,</b> as <b>a</b> skilful coachman brings his team in {{subjection}} on first assuming the reins, [...] "I am a servant of the crown's, and your inferior and subordinate; such duty as becometh me, I am ready to discharge." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, that's over," [...] said Mr. Stephen gently, as he fanned {{himself with}} a pocket-handkerchief. [...] "Quite {{exciting}} while it lasted, wasn't it, Mr. Quatermain--but I have been there before, so to speak. And {{now what do you}} say to some luncheon? Pym's is close by, and they have very good oysters. Only I think we'll drive round by the bank and hand in this cheque. When he's angry my parent is capable of anything. He might even stop it. Woodden, get off down to Twickenham with 'O. Pavo.' Keep it warm, for it feels rather like frost. Put it in the stove for to-night and <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> just a little tepid water, but be careful not to touch the flower. Take a four-wheeled cab, it's slow but safe, and mind you keep the windows up and don't smoke. I shall be home for dinner." ...|$|E
60|$|After {{the first}} week I found I could feed it better with a spoon, and <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more varied and more solid food. Well-soaked biscuit mixed with a little egg and sugar, and {{sometimes}} sweet potatoes, were readily eaten; {{and it was a}} never-failing amusement to observe the curious changes of countenance by which it would express its approval or dislike of what was given to it. The poor little thing would lick its lips, draw in its cheeks, and turn up its eyes with an expression of the most supreme satisfaction when it had a mouthful particularly to its taste. On the other hand, when its food was not sufficiently sweet or palatable, it would turn the mouthful about with its tongue for a moment as if trying to extract what flavour there was, and then push it all out between its lips. If the same food was continued, it would set up a scream and kick about violently, exactly like a baby in a passion.|$|E
60|$|As {{it turned}} out, I found myself {{standing}} nearly {{in the same}} place where Rosanna Spearman and I had been talking together when Mr. Franklin suddenly appeared before us, on arriving at our house from London. While my eyes were watching the Sergeant, my mind wandered away in spite of me to what had passed, on that former occasion, between Rosanna and me. I declare I almost felt the poor thing slip her hand again into mine, and <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> grateful squeeze to thank me for speaking kindly to her. I declare I almost heard her voice telling me again that the Shivering Sand seemed to draw her to it against her own will, whenever she went out--almost saw her face brighten again, as it brightened when she first set eyes upon Mr. Franklin coming briskly out on us from among the hillocks. My spirits fell lower and lower as I thought of these things--and the view of the lonesome little bay, when I looked about to rouse myself, only served to make me feel more uneasy still.|$|E
60|$|He {{left it to}} that able quadruped, after <b>giving</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bang on {{the flank}} with the butt end of the whip to keep its faculties fresh. There was a frenzied shout from the other vehicle, a sudden violent stoppage, with the {{crashing}} of wood, and Flower, crawling out of the ditch, watched with some admiration the strenuous efforts of his noble beast to take the carriage along on three wheels.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Hoskyn, {{naturally}} frank, {{felt some}} vague response within herself to this address. But, though not usually {{at a loss}} for words in social emergencies, she only looked at him, blushed slightly, and offered her hand. He took it as if <b>it</b> were <b>a</b> tiny baby's hand and he afraid of hurting <b>it,</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> pinch, and turned to go. Mr. Adrian Herbert, the painter, was directly in his way, with his back towards him.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first series}} of short 8-page stories are Angus Tales {{and the main}} {{character}} is Angus Fangus. This series consist of 7 stories. All of those stories where mostly colored with yellow, orange, brown, gray and black ink, <b>giving</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> [...] "vanishing" [...] atmosphere. The plot of those stories is usually about how Angus gets into trouble (there is usually a gangster or more involved), and how {{he gets out of}} it. All of the stories is drawn by Silvia Ziche.|$|R
60|$|Such is the {{singular}} statement which Columbus {{gave to the}} sovereigns of his supposed vision. It {{has been suggested that}} this was a mere ingenious fiction, adroitly devised by him to convey a lesson to his prince; but such an idea is inconsistent with his character. He was too deeply imbued with awe of the Deity, and with reverence for his sovereign, to make use of such an artifice. The words here spoken to him by the supposed voice, are truths which dwelt upon his mind, and grieved his spirit during his waking hours. It is natural that they should recur vividly and coherently in his feverish dreams; and in recalling and relating a dream one is unconsciously apt to <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> coherency. Besides, Columbus had a solemn belief that he was a peculiar instrument in the hands of Providence, which, together with a deep tinge of superstition, common to the age, made him prone to mistake every striking dream for a revelation. He is not to be measured by the same standard with ordinary men in ordinary circumstances. It is difficult for the mind to realize his situation, and to conceive the exaltations of spirit to which he must have been subjected. The artless manner in which, in his letter to the sovereigns, he mingles up the rhapsodies and dreams of his imagination, with simple facts, and sound practical observations, pouring them forth with a kind of scriptural solemnity and poetry of language, {{is one of the most}} striking illustrations of a character richly compounded of extraordinary and apparently contradictory elements.|$|E
60|$|MY DEAR CHARLES,--I {{have just}} written the {{dedication}} of David Balfour to you, and haste to put a job in your hands. This is {{a map of the}} environs of Edinburgh circa 1750. It must contain Hope Park, Hunter's Bog, Calton Hill, the Mouter Hill, Lang Dykes, Nor' Loch, West Kirk, Village of Dean, pass down the water to Stockbridge, Silver Mills, the two mill lakes there, with a wood {{on the south side of}} the south one which I saw marked on a plan in the British Museum, Broughton, Picardy, Leith Walk, Leith, Pilrig, Lochend, Figgate Whins. And I would like a piece in a corner, giving for the same period Figgate Whins, Musselburgh, Inveresk, Prestonpans, battlefield of Gladsmuir, Cockenzie, Gullane--which I spell Gillane--Fidra, Dirleton, North Berwick Law, Whitekirk, Tantallon Castle and Castleton, Scougal and Auldhame, the Bass, the Glenteithy rocks, Satan's Bush, Wildfire rocks, and, if possible, the May. If need were, I would not stick at two maps. If there is but one, say, Plan to illustrate David Balfour's adventures in the Lothians. If two, call the first Plan to illustrate David Balfour's adventures about the city of Edinburgh, and the second, Plan to illustrate David Balfour's adventures in East Lothian. I suppose there must be a map-maker of some taste in Edinburgh; I wish few other names in, but what I have given, as far as possible. As soon as may be I will let you have the text, when you might even find some amusement in seeing that the maps fill the bill. If your map-maker be a poor creature, plainness is best; if he were a fellow of some genuine go, he might <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> of the bird's-eye quality. I leave this to your good taste. If I have time I will copy the dedication to go herewith; I am pleased with it. The first map (suppose we take two) would go in at the beginning, the second at Chapter XI. The topography is very much worked into the story, and I have alluded in the dedication to our common fancy for exploring Auld Reekie.|$|E

Seriously, Basil," [...] she continued, [...] "that {{telltale}} locket of yours has so pleasantly brightened some very gloomy thoughts of mine about you, that I can now live happily on expectation, without once mentioning your secret again, till you give me leave to do so." ...|$|R
50|$|A seven-fold tie is an unlined {{construction}} {{variant of}} the four-in-hand necktie which pre-existed the use of interlining. Its creation {{at the end of}} the 19th century is attributed to the Parisian shirtmaker Washington Tremlett for an American customer. A seven-fold tie is constructed completely out of silk. A six-fold tie is a modern alteration of the seven-fold tie. This construction method is more symmetrical than the true seven-fold. <b>It</b> has <b>an</b> interlining which <b>gives</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more weight and is self tipped.|$|R
60|$|Her father {{answered}} {{that he would}} come with her mother {{as soon as he}} got the better of a cold he had taken. It was now well into the winter, and the journey must have seemed more formidable in Equity than in Boston. But Bartley was not impatient of his father-in-law's delay, and he set himself cheerfully about consoling Marcia for it. She stole her white, thin hand into his, and now and then <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> pressure to accent the points she made in talking.|$|R
