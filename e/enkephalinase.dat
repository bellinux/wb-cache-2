5000|$|Spinorphin is an endogenous, non-classical opioid peptide of the hemorphin {{family first}} {{isolated}} from the bovine spinal cord (hence the prefix spin-) and acts as a regulator of the <b>enkephalinases,</b> a class of enzymes that break down endogenous the enkephalin peptides. It does so by inhibiting the enzymes aminopeptidase N (APN), dipeptidyl peptidase III (DPP3), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), and neutral endopeptidase (NEP). Spinorphin is a heptapeptide and has the amino acid sequence Leu-Val-Val-Tyr-Pro-Trp-Thr (LVVYPWT). It has been observed to possess antinociceptive, antiallodynic, and anti-inflammatory properties. The mechanism of action of spinorphin has not been fully elucidated (i.e., how it acts to inhibit the <b>enkephalinases),</b> {{but it has been}} found to act as an antagonist of the P2X3 receptor, [...] and as a weak partial agonist/antagonist of the FP1 receptor.|$|R

40|$|Recently, {{propranolol}} {{was suggested}} to prevent hyperlactatemia {{in a child}} with hypovolemic shock through β-adrenergic blockade. Though it is a known inhibitor of glycolysis, propranolol, outside this observation, has never been reported to fully protect against lactate overproduction. On the other hand, literature evidence exists for a cross-talk between β-adrenergic receptors (protein targets of propranolol) and δ-opioid receptor. In this literature context, it is hypothesized here that anti-diarrheic racecadotril (a pro-drug of thiorphan, an inhibitor of <b>enkephalinases),</b> which, in the cited observation, was co-administered with propranolol, might have facilitated the β-blocker-driven inhibition of glycolysis and resulting lactate production.

40|$|Stress {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} {{to be a key}} modulator in learning and memory processes, in which the hippocampus plays a central role. A great number of neuropeptides have been reported to modulate learning and memory under stressful conditions. Neuropeptidases are proteolytic enzymes capable of regulating the function of neuropeptides in the central and peripheral nervous system. In this regard, a number of neuropeptidases, i. e. angiotensinases, oxytocinase, or <b>enkephalinases,</b> have received attention. Their involvement in stress and memory processes is a promising perspective, as it is possible to influence their activities through various activators or inhibitors and, consequently, to pharmacologically modulate the functions of the endogenous substrates that are involved. The present review describes the key findings showing the involvement of neuropeptides and neuropeptidases in stress and memory and highlights the role of the hippocampus in these processes...|$|R

50|$|Oxytocinase {{is a type}} of {{enzyme that}} metabolizes the {{endogenous}} neuropeptide, oxytocin. The most well-characterized oxytocinase is leucyl/cystinyl aminopeptidase, which is also an <b>enkephalinase.</b> Other oxytocinases are also known.|$|E
40|$|The {{coexistence}} of endogenous opioid systems and dopaminergic neurones in the midbrain tegmental area suggests functional interactions between dopamine and enkephalins. Nevertheless, {{the identification of}} the specific opioid receptors associated with modulation of tegmental dopamine activity and its behavioural concomitants on motility and reward is far from clear, considering the mixed nature of the ligands usually employed. In this way, kelatorphan, a potent inhibitor of <b>enkephalinases</b> and selective agonists for mu- and delta-opioid receptor subtypes (DAGO and DSTBULET, respectively) were infused directly into the ventral tegmental area of the rat to study the role of endogenous enkephalins and opioid receptors in regulating spontaneous motor activity and intracranial self-stimulation behaviour. A greater increase in the rate of intracranial self-stimulation behaviour was found after activation of mu-opioid receptors in the ventral tegmental area, as compared to activation of delta-opioid receptors, whereas enhancement of endogenous enkephalins by inhibiting their metabolism through kelatorphan, reduced the rate of intracranial self-stimulation behaviour. On the contrary, spontaneous motor activity was reduced by the delta-opioid receptor agonist, whereas kelatorphan increased the movements of the animal. Taken together, these results show that inhibition of the metabolism of enkephalins in the ventral tegmental area decreased positive reinforcement from the lateral hypothalamic medial forebrain bundle and increased spontaneous movements. On the contrary, activation of both mu- or delta-opioid receptors in the ventral tegmental area significantly increased self-stimulation and decreased spontaneous motor activity, supporting the view that different mechanisms underlie the behavioural effects, resulting from enhancement of endogenous enkephalins and from activation of specific opioid receptors in the ventral mesencephalon...|$|R

50|$|RB-101 is a prodrug {{which acts}} by {{splitting}} at the disulfide bond {{once inside the}} brain, to form two selective enzyme inhibitors and blocking both types of the zinc-metallopeptidase <b>enkephalinase</b> enzymes.

These two enzymes, aminopeptidase N (APN) and neutral endopeptidase 24.11 (NEP), are responsible for the breakdown of both kinds of enkephalin naturally found in the body, and so RB-101 causes a buildup of both Met-enkephalin and Leu-enkephalin.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{the more}} {{commonly}} used <b>enkephalinase</b> inhibitor racecadotril, which only acts peripherally and has antidiarrheal effects, RB-101 is able to enter the brain, and thus produces a range of effects, acting as an analgesic, anxiolytic and antidepressant. The antidepressant and anxiolytic actions {{are thought to be}} mediated through the delta opioid receptor, while the analgesic effects most likely result from a mix of mu and delta activity. Animal studies suggest that RB-101 is also likely to be useful in relieving the symptoms of acute opioid withdrawal and in the management of opioid dependence.|$|E

5000|$|Surprisingly, many potent Nav1.7 {{blockers}} {{have been}} found to be clinically effective but only relatively weak analgesics. Recently, it has been elucidated that congenital loss of Navv1.7 results in a dramatic increase in the levels of endogenous enkephalins, and it was found that blocking these opioids with the opioid antagonist naloxone allowed for pain sensitivity both in Navv1.7 null mice and in a woman with a defective Navv1.7 gene and associated congenital insensitivity to pain. [...] Development of the venom-derived peptide, JNJ63955 allowed for selective inhibition of Nav1.7 only while it was in the closed state, which produced results, in mice, much more similar to knock-out models. It is possible that channel blockade is maximal only when the channel is inhibited in it's closed state. It appears that complete inactivation of Nav 1.7-mediated sodium efflux is necessary to upregulate enkephalin expression enough to achieve complete analgesia. Prior to the development of JNJ63955, the most potent 1.7 antagonists had failed in regards to achieving the same degree of analgesia as congenital Nav 1.7 inactivity. The proposed mechanism also suggests that the analgesic effects of Nav1.7 blockers may be greatly potentiated by the co-administration of exogenous opioids or <b>enkephalinase</b> inhibitors. Supporting this idea, a strong analgesic synergy between local anesthetics and topical opioids has already been observed in clinical research.|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} whether recombinant <b>enkephalinase</b> (neutral endopeptidase, EC 3. 4. 24. 11) prevents cough induced by exogenously applied and endogenously released neuropeptides, we measured cough responses to aerosolized solutions of substance P or of capsaicin for 2 min in random-source guinea pigs {{before or after}} exposing them to aerosolized recombinant human <b>enkephalinase.</b> Substance P (10 (- 16) M) increased coughing compared with its vehicle. <b>Enkephalinase</b> (120 micrograms) inhibited cough induced by subsequent exposure to substance P compared with the response to substance P alone, but after further exposure to the <b>enkephalinase</b> inhibitor leucine-thiorphan (10 (- 5) M), substance P increased cough significantly. Similar results were obtained for capsaicin-induced cough. In pathogen-free guinea pigs, after they inhaled inactive recombinant <b>enkephalinase</b> (33 micrograms), capsaicin (10 (- 13) M) increased cough significantly. In contrast, after they inhaled active recombinant <b>enkephalinase</b> (33 micrograms), capsaicin increased cough only slightly. These results suggest that aerosolized <b>enkephalinase</b> reaches the sites of release or actions of endogenous neuropeptides and, by degrading them, prevents cough induced by their release. Furthermore, these studies suggest that recombinant <b>enkephalinase</b> might be useful {{in the treatment of}} cough and other symptoms of diseases involving peptides cleaved by this enzyme...|$|E

40|$|Bone {{metabolism}} {{is regulated}} {{by a wide}} variety of both circulating and locally produced peptides. The activity of such agents must be regulated, and one potential regulating mechanism is the inactivation of these peptides by locally produced proteolytic enzymes. One candidate for such a class of enzymes is <b>enkephalinase</b> (EC 2. 3. 24. 11), a membrane-bound neutral metalloendopeptidase that inhibits the activity of a range of biologically active peptides, including interleukin- 1 (IL- 1), a potent bone-resorbing agent. In this study, we examined the effects of human <b>enkephalinase</b> on bone resorption in cultures of fetal rat long bones. We found that partially purified and highly purified <b>enkephalinase</b> inhibited bone resorption stimulated by parathyroid hormone (PTH) and IL 1 α. The effects on PTH-stimulated resorption were reversible, but <b>enkephalinase</b> did not inhibit prestimulated resorption. <b>Enkephalinase</b> also inhibited resorption induced by the nonpeptide stimulators 1, 25 -(OH) 2 D 3, retinoic acid, and prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2). In addition, preliminary studies confirmed a previous report of the presence of an enkephalinase-like activity in osteoblast-like osteosarcoma cells.

40|$|Similarities between {{stimulation}} and opiate analgesia, {{together with}} the recent identification of central nervous system opiate receptors and endogenous opiate peptides {{has led to the}} proposal that periaqueductal gray (PAG) endorphins modulate pain perception. The specific hypothesis that PAG stimulation induces analgesia by the release of enkephalin was evaluated in rats using a specific competitive <b>enkephalinase</b> inhibitor (Gly-Gly-Phe-Met). [...] In three studies the <b>enkephalinase</b> inhibitor was administered intracerebrally two millemeters caudal to an analgesia producing stimulation electrode in the PAG. Analgesia was assessed at two minute intervals using the tail flick test. Study I demonstrated that the <b>enkephalinase</b> inhibitor potentiated in intensity and duration the analgesic action of sub maximal PAG stimulation in a naloxone reversible manner. In Study II the potentiation effect on stimulation produced analgesia was shown to be directly dependent on <b>enkephalinase</b> inhibitor dose and was completely reversed by naloxone. In Study III using specific norepinephrine (6 -OHDA) and serotonin (5. 7 -DHT) neurotoxins a serotonergic mechanism was shown to mediate <b>enkephalinase</b> inhibitor action.

40|$|The neutral endopeptidase EC 3. 4. 24. 11, also {{designated}} <b>enkephalinase,</b> {{has been}} visualized by in vitro autoradiography using the tritiated inhibitor [3 H]-N-[(2 RS) - 3 -hydroxyaminocarbonyl- 2 -benzyl- 1 -oxopropyl] glycine, ([3 H]HACBO-Gly). Specific binding of [3 H]HACBO-Gly (Kd = 0. 4 +/- 0. 05 nM) corresponding to 85 % {{of the total}} binding to brain slices was inhibited by 1 microM thiorphan, a selective inhibitor of <b>enkephalinase,</b> but remained unchanged {{in the presence of}} captopril, a selective inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme. Very high levels of [3 H]HACBO-Gly binding were found in the choroid plexus and the substantia nigra. High levels were present in the caudate putamen, globus pallidus, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, and in the substantia gelatinosa of the spinal cord. Moderate densities were found in parts of the amygdala, the periaqueductal gray matter, the interpeduncular nucleus, and the molecular layer of the cerebellum. The distribution of <b>enkephalinase</b> was compared to that of mu and delta opioid receptors, selectively labeled with [3 H]Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-MePhe-glycinol and [3 H]Tyr-D-Thr-Gly-Phe-Leu-Thr, respectively. In the caudate putamen, [3 H]HACBO-Gly binding overlapped the clustered mu sites but appeared more closely related to the diffusely distributed delta sites. High levels of <b>enkephalinase</b> and mu opioid binding sites were present {{at the level of the}} periaqueductal gray matter and in the substantia gelatinosa of the spinal cord, regions where only sparse delta opioid receptors could be detected. The association of <b>enkephalinase</b> with delta and mu opioid receptors in these areas is consistent with the observed role of the enzyme in regulating the effects of opioid peptides in striatal dopamine release and analgesia, respectively. Except for the choroid plexus and the cerebellum, the close similarity observed in numerous rat brain areas between the distribution of <b>enkephalinase</b> and that of mu and/or delta opioid binding sites could account for most of the pharmacological effects elicited by <b>enkephalinase</b> inhibitors...|$|E
40|$|There are {{at least}} two types of enzymes in brain, endopeptidases and aminopeptidases, which metabolize enkephalins. Evidence is {{presented}} to suggest that <b>enkephalinase,</b> an endopeptidase cleaving at the Gly-Phe bond, is specific for the endogenous enkephalinergic system. Selective inhibitors are described for each enzyme. These are parachloromercuriphenylsulfonic acid and puromycin in the case of aminopeptidases and various enkephalin fragments in the case of <b>enkephalinase.</b> Some characteristics of the two types of enzymes are described. <b>Enkephalinase</b> has many properties in common with the well-characterized brain angiotensin-converting enzyme.

40|$|Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and <b>enkephalinase,</b> two cell surface metallopeptidases, are {{responsible}} for angiotensin II formation and atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) degradation, respectively, and thereby {{play a critical role}} in the metabolism of hormonal peptides exerting essentially opposite actions in cardiovascular regulations. To affect simultaneously both hormonal systems by a single molecular structure, we have designed glycoprilat and alatrioprilat [(S) -N-[3 -(3, 4 -methylene-dioxyphenyl) - 2 -(mercaptomethyl) - 1 -oxoprop yl] glycine and -alanine, respectively]. In vitro the two compounds inhibit both ACE and <b>enkephalinase</b> activities with similar, nanomolar potencies, and in vivo, glycopril and alatriopril, the corresponding diester prodrugs, occupy the two enzyme molecules in lung at similar low dosages (0. 2 - 0. 5 mg/kg of body weight, per os). The high potency of these compounds is attributable to interaction of the methylenedioxy group with the S 1 subsite of ACE and of the aromatic ring with the S 1 ' subsite of <b>enkephalinase.</b> In rodents, low doses of these mixed inhibitors exert typical actions of ACE inhibitors [...] i. e., prevention of angiotensin I-induced hypertension [...] as well as of <b>enkephalinase</b> inhibitors [...] i. e., protection from 125 I-ANF degradation or enhancement of diuresis and natriuresis following acute extracellular volume expansion.

40|$|Thiorphan, N-[(R,S) - 3 -mercapto- 2 -benzylpropanoyl]glycine is {{a highly}} potent {{inhibitor}} (Ki = 3. 5 nM) of "enkephalinase," a metalloendopeptidase cleaving the Gly-Phe bond (positions 3 and 4) of enkephalins in brain tissue. In accordance with this property, thiorphan displays antinociceptive activity after systemic administration. However, thiorphan also inhibits {{to a lesser extent}} (Ki = 140 nM) the widely distributed angiotensin-converting enzyme, a carboxydipeptidase implicated in blood pressure regulation. Therefore, in view of an eventual clinical use of <b>enkephalinase</b> inhibitors, it was very important to develop fully specific compounds. Such derivatives were obtained taking into account that N-methylation of the ultimate amide bond of dipeptides strongly decreases <b>enkephalinase</b> affinity without affecting angiotension-converting enzyme recognition, whereas retro-inversion of the amide bond leads to the inverse effect. Thus, the retro-inverso dipeptide (R) -H 2 N-CH(CH 2 phi) -NHCO-CH 2 -CO 2 H exhibits an inhibitory potency on <b>enkephalinase</b> (IC 50 approximately equal to 12 muM) close to that of the natural dipeptide L-Phe-Gly (IC 50 approximately equal to 3 muM). This result shows the topological analogy between the crucial components involved in <b>enkephalinase</b> recognition both in active dipeptides and structurally related retro-inverso isomers. Taking into account these observations, retro-thiorphan, (R,S) -HS-CH 2 -CH-(CH 2 phi) -NHCO-CH 2 -COOH, was prepared. As compared to thiorphan, the retro isomer is 50 % as potent (Ki = 6 nM) on <b>enkephalinase</b> but displays a drastic loss of potency on angiotension-converting enzyme (IC 50 greater than 10, 000 nM). This specificity was interpreted as a consequence of differences in the stereochemical constraints involving enzyme-inhibitor hydrogen bonding. This hypothesis is supported by reported crystallographic studies on related enzymes such as thermolysin and carboxypeptidase A. As expected, retro-thiorphan exhibits about the same analgesic potency as thiorphan on the hot plate and writhing tests in mice. Therefore, the topological concept of retro-inverso isomers could be extended to other <b>enkephalinase</b> inhibitors, allowing the design of potent and highly selective compounds occurring as new classes of analgesic and psychoactive agents...|$|E

Twenty-one days following injection of kainic acid in the caudate-putamen (CP) [3 H]HACBO-Gly binding was locally decreased by 52 % with a concomitant reduction of 67 and 78 % in the ipsilateral substantia nigra (SN) and globus pallidus (GP), respectively. Inhibition of axonal transport in the CP by unilateral stereotaxic injection of colchicine induced a large (30 - 60 %) and progressive decrease in <b>enkephalinase</b> labelling within the ipsilateral GP and SN. Taken together these results strongly suggest that in the CP a large fraction of <b>enkephalinase</b> is localized on intrinsic striatal neurones, and that the enzyme present both in the GP and the SN is partly localized on nerve terminals originating from neurones in the CP. No change in [3 H]HACBO-Gly binding was observed in the CP following injection of 6 -hydroxydopamine in the nigrostriatal bundle, contrasting with the 30 % depletion in opioid receptors.

40|$|Atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) {{might be}} {{beneficial}} in several cardiovascular disorders, but its poor oral absorption and rapid inactivation in vivo {{have so far}} prevented its use in therapeutics. We have assessed the role of <b>enkephalinase</b> (membrane metallo-endopeptidase, EC 3. 4. 24. 11) in the in vivo inactivation of ANF in mice and healthy human volunteers by evaluating the effects of acetorphan, a potent inhibitor. In mice, the degradation of 125 I-labeled ANF was markedly delayed, {{as shown by the}} levels of the intact peptide in the plasma and the kidney, a major target organ. The effect of acetorphan was due to the inhibition of <b>enkephalinase</b> activity, since it occurred at an ED 50 very close to this drug's ID 50 for the inhibition of the specific binding of radioactive material to the kidney or lung peptidase that was measured after administration of [3 H]acetorphan. The effects of acetorphan were also studied in eight healthy human volunteers by using a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled design. Oral administration of acetorphan elicited a lasting elevation of plasma ANF-like immunoreactivity, with a time course parallel to that of the inhibition of plasma <b>enkephalinase</b> activity. These effects were accompanied by significant increases in urinary volume and sodium excretion, two well-established renal responses to ANF peptides. These results indicate that <b>enkephalinase</b> plays a critical role in ANF degradation in vivo and that its inhibition enhances the levels of circulating endogenous ANF, which, in turn, results in diuresis and natriuresis. <b>Enkephalinase</b> inhibition may constitute another therapeutic approach to the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, such as congestive heart failure or essential hypertension, on which ANF is postulated to have a beneficial effect...|$|E
