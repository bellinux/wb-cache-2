30|$|In {{order to}} clarify the {{advantage}} of the ZnO:Cs 2 CO 3 as the interfacial layer, the effect of ZnO:Cs 2 CO 3 on interfacial layer properties is investigated by UPS. As shown in UPS spectra (Figure  1 a), the work function of ITO is determined to be 4.7  eV, and upon the <b>interface</b> <b>modification,</b> the work function of ITO decreased to 3.8  eV. We interpret this decrease in work function as arising from the interfacial dipoles from the modified ZnO:Cs 2 CO 3 layer, which reduces the vacuum level, resulting in a lower electron injection barrier, thus facilitating electron injection [48]. Therefore, the establishment of the interfacial dipole or <b>interface</b> <b>modification</b> induces lower work function of ITO, which may reduce the electron-injection barrier height compared to the case without <b>interface</b> <b>modification.</b> The detailed values extracted from the UPS spectra are shown in Figure  1 a. As depicted from the energy diagram shown in Figure  1 b, the electron injection barrier from ITO to ZnO:Cs 2 CO 3 is reduced from 2.1 to 1.2  eV. Obviously, this cathode <b>interface</b> <b>modification</b> greatly reduces the electron injection barrier, which should be beneficial for the improvement of PCE. The complete structure of our inverted organic solar cells is shown in Figure  1 b. The <b>interface</b> <b>modification</b> was also carried out by taking multiple contact angle measurements from few locations on the substrates, with and without <b>interface</b> <b>modification.</b> Contact angle measurements were performed to confirm that <b>interface</b> <b>modification</b> was present on the ITO film. Six separate contact angle determinations were performed on each sample. Without <b>interface</b> <b>modification,</b> the surface of ZnO after oxygen plasma had a low wetting angle to DI water (~ 26 °) - showing a hydrophilic (oleophobic) surface. It is worth noting that such a low contact angle indicates a higher surface energy, which is characteristic for polar surfaces. The creation of the <b>interface</b> <b>modification</b> layer was confirmed from the data, which demonstrates the enhancement in contact angle (hydrophobic/oleophilic surface) after surface modification (~ 68 °).|$|R
30|$|An {{important}} issue is to check whether the work function shifts are {{also reflected in}} the performance of devices when other active materials are used. As demonstrated by several authors, if one employs <b>interface</b> <b>modification</b> into any device, it should, in principle, be possible to see some positive improvements {{as a result of the}} <b>interface</b> <b>modification,</b> regardless of active materials used. For this purpose, we made another set of inverted solar cells based on P 3 HT:ICBA with the configuration ITO/ZnO:Cs 2 CO 3 /P 3 HT:ICBA/PEDOT:PSS/Al. As a reference, solar cells without <b>interface</b> <b>modification</b> were also fabricated.|$|R

The PSC with TBT-a as the cathode interlayer exhibited a high power conversion efficiency of 8. 68 %. We found that the TBT-a interlayer simultaneously enhanced all the device parameters, probably by inducing an effective interface dipole, altering the optical distribution, and enhancing the electron mobility.
