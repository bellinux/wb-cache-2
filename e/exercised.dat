Aim: This study explored the psychological factors associated with the <b>exercise</b> behavior of nursing students. Methods/Design: A total of 195 first-year undergraduate nursing students completed a cross-sectional quantitative survey questionnaire, which included measures of their <b>exercise</b> behavior, the Physical <b>Exercise</b> Self-efficacy Scale, and the <b>Exercise</b> Barriers/Benefits Scale. Results/Findings: The results showed that male students spent more time <b>exercising</b> and had higher <b>exercise</b> self-efficacy compared with female students, but there were no gender differences in the perceived barriers to or benefits of <b>exercise.</b> Fatigue brought on by <b>exercising</b> was the greatest perceived barrier to <b>exercise,</b> whereas increasing physical fitness and mental health were the greatest perceived benefits of <b>exercise.</b> Multiple linear regression showed that gender, <b>exercise</b> self-efficacy, perceived barriers to <b>exercise,</b> and perceived benefits of <b>exercise</b> were independent predictors of <b>exercise</b> behavior.

Therefore, this study aims to (1) determine the levels of perceived <b>exercise</b> behavior, <b>exercise</b> behavior in the past, perceived barriers to <b>exercise,</b> perceived benefits of <b>exercise,</b> perceived self-efficacy to <b>exercise,</b> feelings associated with <b>exercise</b> behavior, influence of the family to <b>exercise,</b> influence of friends to <b>exercise,</b> and the perceived influence of the environment on <b>exercise.</b> (2) examine the predicting ability of each of the above factors while including personal factors (sex, educational level) for <b>exercise</b> behavior.

40|$|Introduction: <b>Exercise</b> {{professionals}} {{can follow}} readily available published guidelines, provided from major health organisations, when designing comprehensive <b>exercise</b> programs consisting of cardiorespiratory, resistance, flexibility, and neuromotor <b>exercise.</b> Paradoxically, when combining {{these types of}} <b>exercise</b> into the same <b>exercise</b> session, there are no current recommendations for the most appropriate <b>exercise</b> order. The {{purpose of this study}} was to provide preliminary evidence for establishing an optimal <b>exercise</b> order of cardiorespiratory, resistance, flexibility, and neuromotor <b>exercise.</b> Methods: A total of 20 participants performed an <b>exercise</b> prescription (ExRx) consisting of all possible sequences (24 combinations) of cardiorespiratory, resistance, flexibility, and neuromotor <b>exercise.</b> Physiological and psychological responses to <b>exercise</b> were measured throughout each <b>exercise</b> session. Repeated-measures ANOVA and polynomial trend analysis were performed to determine if physiological and psychological responses to <b>exercise</b> differed according to <b>exercise</b> order. Results: The mean heart rate (HR) response to cardiorespiratory <b>exercise</b> was significantly different (p 0. 05) when resistance <b>exercise</b> was positioned either first or second in the ExRx; however, post hoc tests showed mean resistance <b>exercise</b> RPE was significantly higher (p 0. 05) were found in the physiological responses to either neuromotor or flexibility <b>exercise</b> across all <b>exercise</b> sequence positions. Conclusion: Results of this novel study provide important preliminary evidence towards formulating recommendations for an optimal sequence of cardiorespiratory, resistance, flexibility and neuromotor <b>exercise</b> for the ExRx. Findings from the present study suggest cardiorespiratory <b>exercise</b> should always be performed first followed next by resistance <b>exercise.</b> Flexibility and neuromotor <b>exercise</b> can be positioned at a later point in the ExRx...|$|R
