50|$|The Riegner {{telegram}} read in part:Have received through {{foreign office}} following message from Riegner <b>Geneva</b> <b>STOP</b> Received alarming report that in Führers headquarters plan discussed and under consideration all Jews in countries occupied or controlled Germany number 3½ to 4 million should after deportation and concentration in East at one blow exterminated to resolve {{once and for}} all Jewish question in Europe.|$|E
50|$|Another early device {{which helped}} even out the spring's force was stopwork or winding stops, which {{prevented}} the mainspring from being wound {{up all the}} way, and prevented it from unwinding all the way. The idea was to use only {{the central part of}} the spring's 'torque curve', where its force was more constant. The most common form was the <b>Geneva</b> <b>stop</b> or 'Maltese cross'. Stopwork isn't needed in modern watches.|$|E
5000|$|Geneva wheels {{having the}} form of the driven wheel were also used in {{mechanical}} watches, but not in a drive, rather to limit the tension of the spring, such that it would operate only in the range where its elastic force is nearly linear. If one of the slots of the driven wheel is occluded, the number of rotations the drive wheel can make is limited. In watches, the [...] "drive" [...] wheel is the one that winds up the spring, and the Geneva wheel with four or five spokes and one closed slot prevents overwinding (and also complete unwinding) of the spring. This so-called <b>Geneva</b> <b>stop</b> or [...] "Geneva stop work" [...] was the invention of 17th or 18th century watchmakers.|$|E
5000|$|The name [...] "WRS" [...] {{and some}} {{features}} of the former public service broadcaster were retained by Anglo Media Group, which had previously operated an internet station: Radio Frontier. The broadcasting on FM 101.7 MHz covering the Western part of the lake <b>Geneva</b> area <b>stopped</b> on 1 October 2013 while the DAB+ signal covering the Swiss French Speaking region and the Swiss German Speaking region continues alongside internet, mobile and WRS app listening.|$|R
25|$|Itavia – 1 January 1974, (Caselle Torinese, airport of Turin, Italy): 38 fatalities. Flight IH897 from Cagliari to <b>Geneva</b> with {{intermediate}} <b>stops</b> in Bologna and Turin, crashed about 2 {{miles south}} of Runway 36 while attempting to land in fog. Airplane involved was registered I-TIDE.|$|R
5000|$|The United States {{urged the}} United Nations Human Rights Council in <b>Geneva</b> to <b>stop</b> its anti-Israel bias. It took {{particular}} {{exception to the}} council’s Agenda Item 7, under which at every session, Israel’s human rights record is debated. No other country has a dedicated agenda item. The US Ambassador to the UNHRC Eileen Chamberlain Donahoe said that the United States was deeply troubled by the [...] "Council’s biased and disproportionate focus on Israel." [...] She said that the hypocrisy was further exposed in the Golan Heights resolution that was advocated by the Syrian regime {{at a time when}} it was murdering its own citizens.|$|R
60|$|If this {{abuse of}} <b>Geneva</b> be not <b>stopped,</b> we may go whoop for husbandmen, labourers, &c. Trade must {{consequently}} stand still, and the credit {{of the nation}} sink; nor is the abatement of the excise, though very considerable, and most worthy notice, any ways comparable to the corruption of manners, the destruction of health, and all the train of evils we are threatened with from pernicious Geneva.|$|R
6000|$|As evening drew on, a wind sprang up, and a storm seemed {{gathering}} on the Jura. The rain dashed {{against the}} panes of the berime, as we rode past the grim-faced monarch of the [...] "misty shroud." [...] A cold wind went sweeping by, and the Rhone was rushing far below, discernible {{only in the}} distance as a rivulet of flashing foam. It was night as we drove into <b>Geneva,</b> and <b>stopped</b> at the Messagerie. I heard with joy a voice demanding if this were Monsieur Besshare. I replied, not without some scruples of conscience, [...] "Oui, monsieur, c'est moi," [...] though the name did not sound exactly like the one to which I had been wont to respond. In half an hour we were at home, in the mansion of Monsieur Fazy.|$|R
50|$|When {{they reached}} the {{boundaries}} of the Allobroges, the northernmost tribe of the Provincia, they found that Caesar had already dismantled the bridge of <b>Geneva</b> to <b>stop</b> their advance. The Helvetians sent “the most illustrious men of their state” to negotiate, promising a peaceful passage through the Provincia. Caesar stalled them by asking for some time for consideration, which he used to assemble reinforcements and to fortify the southern banks of the Rhône. When the embassy returned on the agreed-upon date, he was strong enough to bluntly reject their offer. The Helvetii now chose the more difficult northern route through the Sequani territory, which traversed the Jura Mountains via a very narrow pass {{at the site of the}} modern Fort l'Écluse, but bypassed the Provincia. After ravaging the lands of the Aedui tribe, who called upon Caesar to help them, they began the crossing of the Saône, which took them several days. As only a quarter of their forces were left on the eastern banks, Caesar attacked and routed them. According to Caesar, those killed had been the Tigurini, on whom he had now taken revenge in the name of the Republic and his family.|$|R
40|$|Neither Hamas nor Israel pay {{the cost}} of their episodic Gaza wars. Israel gets weapons and funds from the U. S. {{government}} and from the American Jewish community. Hamas gets weapons, funds and reconstruction funds from Iran, Qatar, and the international humanitarian community; i. e. the U. S., UK, EU, and Nordic states via the UN agencies they fund. Israel’s Gaza blockade has since 2007 allowed more than a hundred truckloads of food and humanitarian aid a week into Gaza, even during times of fighting. Israel has curtailed dual-use goods like cement and pipes which Hamas diverted for war purposes. In 2014, as previously, both sides repeatedly violated the <b>Geneva</b> Convention. To <b>stop</b> repetition of the Gaza wars, outsider financing for the adversaries has to be reduced and weapons must be removed and banned from Gaza. Gaza should be demilitarized in a “weapons-to-end-the-blockade” cease-fire deal. Israel should pay rent to the Palestine Authority for West Bank settlements, access roads, military bases and other occupied real estate. Suggestions are made in this paper about how to accomplish this goal...|$|R
5000|$|The {{introduction}} of TGV services to Bellegarde-sur-Valserine on 22 September 1981, {{the completion of}} the autoroutes from Lyon to Geneva and the opening of the Mont Blanc Tunnel all greatly improved access to Bellegarde, enabling the town to develop through industrial restructuring which allowed Bellegarde to maintain unemployment below the national average. [...] Two daily services between Paris and Geneva were created, making Bellegarde the first town with less than 20,000 inhabitants to get a daily TGV link to Paris, although night trains to Paris were discontinued at the same time. However the advent of TGV services coincided with the decline of the Geneva - Barcelona Trans-Europ-Express; on 23 May 1982 the Catalan Talgo was replaced by a EuroCity service. and the IC 5642/3 train took over the name le Rhodanien. It linked Geneva to Marseille via Bellegarde, Chambéry, Grenoble, Valence and Avignon. In summer 1983, a TGV Paris - Geneva/Annecy was created, with trains being split or joined at Culoz. In the 1980s, as with many other French stations, services to Bellegarde were generally reduced or cancelled. After summer 1984, the La Rochelle - Saint-Gervais service was stopped. In 1985, Z 7500, Z 9500 and Z 9600 railcars were introduced on the Lyon - Genève/Evian/Saint-Gervais services, then in 1987, the Class BB 25200 locomotives (made available by the {{introduction of}} BB 22200 locos) were used with push-pull Corail trains between Lyon and Geneva. Service reductions continued in the 1990s, and apart from the long-distance service from Hendaye/Irun to Geneva, only regional TER services were left. In 2001, the Corail Lunéa Rhône-Océan Lyon-Quimper service was extended to <b>Geneva</b> with a <b>stop</b> in Bellegarde.|$|R
