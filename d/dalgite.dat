50|$|Bruce Leake, {{a farmer}} from nearby Kellerberrin, {{documented}} the rich past fauna {{of the eastern}} wheatbelt in the late 1800s. These included possum, phascogale, tammar wallaby, brush wallaby, rock-wallaby, nailtail wallaby, banded hare-wallaby, rufous hare-wallaby, woylie, boodie, pig-footed bandicoot, <b>dalgite,</b> numbat and chuditch. Many of these species would {{have occurred in the}} Narembeen district also. Unfortunately, very little of this fauna remains. It has only been comparatively recently that this loss of fauna has been attributed largely to predation by introduced foxes and feral cats.|$|E
50|$|The name Morawa is an Indigenous Australian name; it {{probably}} {{derives from the}} Morowar, the local dialect's word for the <b>dalgite.</b> The name was first used on maps of the area in 1910, in reference to a rock hole. When the railway was being planned in 1913, {{it was decided to}} locate a siding at the location, and the name Morawa was chosen for it. The Lands Department then decided to establish a townsite there, and Morawa was gazetted in September 1913. In 1921 the Railways Department decided that Morawa was too similar to Mullewa and requested a name change. In response, the town's name was changed to Merkanooka in January 1922. However the Railway Department, which had pressed for the name change in the first place, did not rename the siding, and in June the town's name reverted to Morawa {{at the request of the}} townspeople.|$|E
