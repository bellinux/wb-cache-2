5|$|Meshuggah's {{music is}} written by Thordendal, Hagström and Haake with {{assistance}} from Kidman and Lövgren. During songwriting, a member programs the drums, and records the guitar and bass via computer. He presents his idea {{to the other}} members as a finished work. Meshuggah typically adheres to the original idea and rarely changes the song afterwards. Hagström explains that each member <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> of what the others are doing conceptually, and nobody thinks exclusively {{in terms of a}} particular instrument. Kidman does not play guitar in the band anymore, but he is involved in writing riffs.|$|E
5|$|Lisa imagines she and all {{the other}} Springfield Elementary {{students}} are Hebrews in ancient Egypt, with the Pharaoh (Principal Skinner) making them build a pyramid. Only Moses (Milhouse) can liberate the Hebrews. When Bart defaces the Pharaoh's sarcophagus, supposedly incited by the burning bush, he gets the other students punished. Lisa helps Milhouse produce plagues to scare the Pharaoh into freeing the Israelites; they fail. This in turn gets Lisa and Milhouse thrown in a Pyramid prison. When they escape, Milhouse gathers all the students and they attempt to leave. When they reach the sea, Lisa <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> to get across: They simultaneously flush all the Egyptians' toilets to drain the sea. As they cross, the Pharaoh and his guards follow, but the water fills the sea back up and swallows them. They enjoy splashing each other, and then return to the shore. Pleased that they have escaped, Milhouse asks Lisa what the future holds for the Israelites, but Lisa disappoints Milhouse when she says that they have to wander the desert for forty years. Milhouse then asks if {{it is going to be}} smooth sailing for the Jews after that. Rather than disappoint Milhouse again with news of the ongoing anti-Semitism that will plague the Jews for many centuries, she distracts the crowd by sending them to search for manna.|$|E

Knight) is depressed when all his patients from the car accident die until Hunt tells him one case where he helped has survived.|$|E
25|$|Temporal {{resolution}} of fMRI is limited by: (1) the feedback mechanism {{that raises the}} blood flow operating slowly; (2) having to wait till net magnetization recovers before sampling a slice again; and (3) having to acquire multiple slices to cover the whole brain or region of interest. Advanced techniques to improve temporal resolution address these issues. Using multiple coils speeds up acquisition time in exact proportion to the coils used. Another technique is to decide which parts of the signal matter less and drop those. This could be either those sections of the image that repeat often in a spatial map (that is small clusters dotting the image periodically) or those sections repeating infrequently (larger clusters). The first, a high-pass filter in k-space, has been proposed by Gary H. Glover and colleagues at Stanford. These mechanisms assume the researcher <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> of the expected shape of the activation image.|$|E
25|$|Harold is aghast, worried if {{the foreign}} police will believe the story {{both he and}} Elsie have to tell and that their 'relationship' is innocent. The {{evidence}} points to manslaughter at best and murder at worst. Mrs Rice suddenly <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> and wonders if the hotel management and foreign police are open to bribery. Harold agrees {{to give it a}} try and wires for money but aside from that, and unable to speak the local language, leaves Mrs Rice to carry out the negotiations. All seems to go well and the next day Harold sees Mrs Rice speaking with a police officer and she tells him that the death has been declared as being from natural causes and that they are all in the clear. That is until the two Polish women approach Mrs Rice and speak to her. She translates for Harold and tells him that they know what really happened (their room being next to Elsie's) and that they are blackmailing the English people.|$|E

They notice that the giants are all going to meet that alpha hydra, and Jack Junior leaves to go kill it, followed by the children. There, they meet the giant multi-headed dragon, who had already started to kill the giants that had gathered to fight it. After hurting Jack Junior and the Grace kids, Nick <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> and realizes it's up to him to save the day. Using the cap given to him by the merfolk so he could safely breathe, he goes into one of the tunnels with Jack's machete so to meet the hydra from below. When he gets there, instead of trying to kill the beast, he cuts the substance that keeps all the dragons together, thus making them separate from each other and easier for the giants to kill.|$|E

In a study made by IAG Research, the appearance of Second Life in [...] "Local Ad" [...] was rated eighth in the top ten most effective product placements of 2007. The Office was the only non-reality show to make the list, and Second Life was the only product on the list that did not pay for its placement.

500|$|Like the band's earlier releases, {{the album}} {{features}} {{a variety of}} guitar configurations as well as electronic synths. Erikson said that initially they gather with the standard guitar-bass-drum and keyboard gear, and as they pass around different ideas and implement them the songs take form in any which way a session takes them. [...] "Once we started on the album proper, it became a Garbage record, which is any number of approaches to writing a recording. There were no rules, certainly", he explained. A song like [...] "Automatic Systematic Habit" [...] features more electronics than guitars, and [...] "Big Bright World", a guitar-heavy song, involves configurations that make some of the guitars sound like synths. Guitar parts are normally divvied between guitarists Marker and Erikson. Erikson said {{it comes down to}} [...] "Whoever comes up with what at any given time. There's no job description as far as lead guitar/rhythm guitar. It's just whoever <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> as a articular [...] moment. It's usually about 50/50". Erikson and Marker used a variety of guitars and pedals, old, new, and defective.|$|E
500|$|The {{show was}} punctuated by fantasy {{sequences}} {{in which his}} character performed his thoughts as a stand-up routine in a small club. In the commentary and the interview on the DVD, Bathurst says that {{he was told that}} they would be re-shot after filming everything else, an idea abandoned because of the expense. He <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> of re-filming the sequences 'now', as his older self, to give them a more retrospective feeling. He has also said that he believes Mark was too [...] "designery" [...] and wishes that he had [...] "roughened him up a bit". The role is his favourite of his whole career; he has described it as [...] "the most enjoyable job I will ever do" [...] and considers several episodes of the series to be [...] "timeless, beautifully constructed farces which will endure". Bathurst is often recognised for his appearance in this series, mentioning that [...] "Drunks stop me on public transport and tell me details of the plot of their favourite episode". As punishment for arriving late for the series one press launch at the Café Royal in Regent Street, London, writer Steven Moffat pledged to write an episode in which Mark is naked throughout. To a large extent, this vow is realised in the second series.|$|E
