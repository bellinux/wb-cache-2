While only very slight effects of prostaglandins (PG) were seen in slices of normal liver, all the <b>hepatomas</b> responded strongly to PGE 1 and PGE 2. The <b>hepatomas</b> also had increased PGE,-sensitive adenylate-cyclase activity. PGFia and PGF 2 as did not increase the cAMP level significantly either in the liver or in the <b>hepatomas.</b> During AAF carcinogenesis the response to PGE 1 increased slightly during the carcinogen feeding, and was greatly elevated only in the fully developed <b>hepatomas.</b> This {{is in contrast to}} the increase in adrenalin response seen during carcinogenesis, which starts much earlier, and reaches a peak value within 8 - 10 weeks.

CYCLIC AMP (cAMP) seems to be a regulator of cell growth, but its precise role is incompletely understood (Ryan & Heidrick, 1974; Pastan et al., 1975; Friedman, 1976). The metabolism of cAMP is altered in many cancers and malignant cell lines. In rat <b>hepatomas</b> the cAMP system is regulated differently from that of normal liver tissue.

However, consistent with the dual inhibitory and stimulatory roles of IGFBP-3 seen in cell culture, there are other cancer types, such as breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, and clear cell renal cell cancer in which high tissue IGFBP-3 expression has been linked to poor prognostic features or patient outcome. The mechanisms regulating these contrasting effects of IGFBP-3 in vivo are not well understood.|$|E

MR imaging findings after administration of Gd-DTPA (0. 3 mmol/kg) and Gd-EOB-DTPA (30 mumol/kg) were correlated with microangiographic and histologic findings. Gd-EOB-DTPA produced a strong liver enhancement, which caused prompt negative contrast enhancement (CE) in all implanted <b>hepatomas</b> and in 77 of 79 primary <b>hepatomas.</b> A positive CE that lasted up to 2 hours was found in two of 79 primary <b>hepatomas,</b> both of which were highly differentiated (grade I) hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs).

2500|$|If the {{membrane}} receptors are denatured or deficient, the signal transduction can be hindered and cause diseases. Some diseases {{are caused by}} disorders of membrane receptor function. [...] This is due to deficiency or degradation of the receptor via changes in the genes that encode and regulate the receptor protein. The membrane receptor TM4SF5 influences the migration of hepatic cells and <b>hepatoma.</b> Also, the cortical NMDA receptor influences membrane fluidity, and is altered in Alzheimer's disease. When the cell is infected by a non-enveloped virus, the virus first binds to specific membrane receptors and then passes itself or a subviral component to the cytoplasmic side of the cellular membrane. In the case of poliovirus, it is known in vitro that interactions with receptors cause conformational rearrangements which release a virion protein called VP4.The N terminus of VP4 is myristylated and thus hydrophobic【myristic acid=CH3(CH2)12COOH】. It is proposed that the conformational changes induced by receptor binding result in the attachment of myristic acid on VP4 {{and the formation of}} a channel for RNA.|$|E

40|$|Surgical {{samples of}} human hepatic tissue were {{analysed}} morphologically and biochemically and highly differentiated <b>hepatomas</b> {{were compared with}} two control groups: morphologically normal liver tissue surrounding the tumour, and tissue from normal livers. In tumour homogenates cholesterol levels were more than twice, ubiquinone levels about half and the concentration of free dolichol about 10 % of the control value. The levels of dolichyl phosphate were basically similar, whereas the phospholipid level was slightly lower in the tumours. In microsomes isolated from <b>hepatomas,</b> the level of cholesterol was about 30 % higher than the control value. HMG-CoA reductase activity in microsomes isolated from <b>hepatomas</b> was elevated almost 100 % in comparison to control. In <b>hepatomas,</b> no major alterations in the compositions of dolichol or dolichyl phosphate could be observed. The relative amounts of alpha-saturated and alpha-unsaturated polyprenols were also basically unaltered in <b>hepatomas.</b> Liver samples were incubated with 3 H-mevalonic acid and radioactivity was monitored in polyprenols. With control tissue, incorporation was considerably higher in alpha-unsaturated polyprenols than in their alpha-saturated counterparts. In the tumours the rates of incorporation into both polyprenol fractions were much lower, although still higher in the alpha-unsaturated fraction. Labelling of polyisoprenols containing 19 isoprene residues was {{higher than that of}} 20 residues. The pattern of labelling in the polyisoprenyl-P fraction was similar. In <b>hepatomas</b> the incorporation into cholesterol and ubiquinone- 10 was about 100 % higher and 50 % lower respectively compared with control tissue. The results in this study of <b>hepatomas</b> indicate that the levels of various lipids may be influenced not only by the regulatory enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, but also by other enzymes catalysing reactions subsequent to this regulatory point.

It is now clear that lipid peroxidation is strongly decreased in most highly dedifferentiated <b>hepatomas.</b> It seems evident that the extent of the decline is strictly related to the degree of dedifferentiation. The model of diethylnitrosamine carcinogenesis, according to the method by Soh, Medline and Farber, has been now adopted to study the stages of carcinogenesis. It was shown that a net decline in lipid peroxidation occurs as early as at the stage of reversible nodules and progresses until the development of clear <b>hepatomas.</b> This change is practically simultaneous with a decline in the efficiency of the enzymes of the drug metabolizing system and in the content of cytochrome Pls 0. Glutathione content and metabolism show also important changes. In fact, a dramatic increase in gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase takes place very early during carcinogenesis, and is responsible for large decline in total glutathione during incubation of the homogenates. Glutathione peroxidase activity, on the contrary, is decreased, whereas glutathione reductase does not show significant changes. The supernatant of highly anaplastic tumors inhibits lipid peroxidation in normal liver homogenates, suggesting the presence of substances provided with antioxidant properties. These cannot be, however, related to a higher glutathione content. Supernatants from early nodules seem to be unable to block lipid peroxidation in normal liver homogenates.
