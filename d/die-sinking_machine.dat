Copper Electrode {{was used as a}} tools in this research. EDM is a thermal process that uses spark discharge to erode electrically conductive materials, it’s primarily used for hard metals that very difficult to machine with traditional techniques. EDM tests on a mild steel workpiece were conducted on a sodick AQ 55 L (ATC) EDM <b>Die-Sinking</b> <b>Machine.</b> The surface Roughness tester Series Mahrsurf XR 20 is used to measure Ra and the surface microstructure was examined with a metallurgical microscopes. The EDM machining parameters those were used were peak current, IP (9 A and 18 A), discharge voltage (90 V and 120 V), servo voltage, SV (20 V and 60 V), pulse on-time (100 μs and 300 μs) and pulse off-time (500 μs and 700 μs). The full factorial design of experiment (DOE) from STATISTICA software was used to generate the arrangement of the experiment parameter and the software was used to analyze the effect of each parameter on the machining characteristics. From the analyzed result, peak current, IP and the pulse on-time have significant effect to the Surface Roughness, Ra. The lower values of these two parameters the lower Surface roughness, Ra observed. From the observation on the metallurgical microscopes, it is found there are clearly EDM damaged layer on the workpiece, distinguished by the width and length of microcrack and craters, especially at high peak current, IP and pulse on-time. The surface roughness, damaged layer and micro-cracks seem to decrease when the peak current and pulse on-time were set at very low values...|$|E

A micro-mold cavity is required for the mass production of micro component using injection molding machine. Moreover, micro-holes are also required in a micro-die. Nowadays, WC and its composite (WC-Co) are the widely used material in the making of cutting tools, dies and other special tools and components.

Unfortunately there is limited information available about fabricating micro-hole electrode made from CuW for electrical discharge machining. This includes information on suitable electrode material for electrical discharge machining of CuW, the processing method and suitable parameter for micro-EDM of CuW and WC-Co. In this research, PGM WHITE 3 is used as the dielectric fluid, Cu-W as the micro-electrode, WC-Co as the workpiece material and Sodik AG 40 L as the <b>die-sinking</b> <b>machine</b> selected for the project.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the use of}} one finishing electrode to finish multiple dies without remachining the electrode. The multiple-use electrode finishing experiment in this study addresses technology in the die-forging industry. Methods of manufacturing spherical straight bevel forge gear dies have relied on <b>die-sinking</b> Electrical Discharge <b>Machining</b> (EDM) practices that showed great potential for advancement. The focus {{of this study is}} solely on the improvements of electrode use in EDM finishing-processes. The surface finish quality itself is not an area of concern other than maintaining that it does not diminish. The focused concern is maximizing the process by using one electrode unmodified for multiple-finishing operations. The objective for improvement is utilization of one finishing electrode used multiple times rather than only one finishing electrode per die. Utilizing a Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM), the inspection of specific locations on the finishing electrode reveals the repeatability and accuracy of use for one finishing electrode for six gear forging-dies. Initial experimentation validates the capabilities to finish four dies accurately in two separate die configurations with one electrode. To accomplish finishing the four initial dies, a <b>die-sinking</b> EDM <b>machine</b> that possesses a large enough working envelope was included in the process. The transition of using graphite electrode materials in place of brass for finishing multiple dies aids in reducing what was a total eight-hour process time into a four-hour process time. A machine with a working envelope large enough for only setting up one die to be EDM machined generated the eight-hour process time. The researcher achieved the eight-hour process time by replacing brass electrodes in the roughing stages with graphite electrodes. The extent to which one finish electrode can finish a sample set of six complete dies with one electrode is studied. Data is extrapolated from the deviation of absolute locations on a three-dimensional solid model compared to the multiple-use finishing electrode. Specific locations inspected on the electrode conclude the study efforts with results revealing that the maximum repeated use of an electrode is seven uses...|$|R

Powder-mixed dielectric in electrical discharge machining showed that {{it is one of}} the processing methods with high efficiency. This article reports on the results of surface quality of mold steels after powder-mixed electrical discharge machining using titanium powder in fine machining.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{evaluations of}} the stress intensity factors (SIFs) and the fatigue crack growths of a surface/corner crack in solid bar under combined cyclic tension-torsion loading. A surface crack in solid cylinder and a corner crack in square prismatic bar are considered. The numerical modelling was carried out using a Dual Boundary Element Method (DBEM) based software and an axial-torsion fatigue testing machine was utilized to perform the experimental works. In doing the numerical works, the J-integral technique was chosen to evaluate the stress intensity factors and the NASGRO crack growth rate equation was used to simulate the fatigue crack growths. As preliminary numerical works, fatigue crack growths of a surface crack in a notched cylinder under cyclic tension were evaluated. Crack shape evolutions for different crack aspect ratios and the corresponding stress intensity factors were correlated to study the behaviour of the crack growths. The cylinder that contains a defect which has a smaller crack aspect ratio in a notched cylinder shall be given more careful attentions. Next, the numerical works were further carried out to evaluate the stress intensity factors and fatigue crack growths of a corner crack in a square prismatic bar under combined cyclic torsion-tension loads. In this particular case, the cylinder part was needed to model the torsional loading {{to be transferred to}} the square bar. The SIFs at the initial condition and the fatigue crack growths for different loading ratios of tension stress to torsional stress are presented. For a given tension loading, the larger Mode III SIFs and the shorter fatigue life were found at the model with the crack aspect ratio a/c ≠ 1 and having a larger torsional loading. With a consideration of a practical interest, surface crack growths in a solid cylinder under combined cyclic tension-torsion loading were particularly evaluated through experimentation and numerical modeling. The aluminium alloy 6061 -T 6 was used for this purpose. A guideline for introducing a semi-elliptical surface crack in a solid cylinder using the <b>die-sinking</b> EDM <b>machine</b> is presented in detail in this thesis. iv The numerical simulations and experimental works showed similar crack growth paths. The fatigue lives obtained from the experimentation and numerical simulations were shown to be in good agreements. At the first increment, the torsion loading gave a more dominant effect on the crack extension angle at the crossed surface point than that due to the crack aspect ratio. Meanwhile, the effect of the crack aspect ratio on the crack extension angle was observed to be more dominant at the crack depth point. The combinations of flat and shear lips fracture surfaces, and fluctuating crack growth direction and Keff values at the crossed surface points confirmed the inclined and twisted crack front during stable crack growth. The crack growth direction at the crossed surface points fluctuated significantly during stable crack growth...|$|R
40|$|The {{millimeter}} wave {{frequency range}} {{has got a}} lot of attention {{over the past few years}} because it contains unused frequency spectrum resources that are suitable for delivering Gbit/s end-user access in areas with high user density. Due to the limited output power that current RF active components can deliver in millimeter waves, antennas with the merits of low profile, high gain, high effciency and low cost are needed to compensate free space path loss and increase the communication distance for the emerging high data rate wireless systems. In order to move towards the millimeter wave frequencies we need to face significant hardware challenges, such as active and passive components integration, packaging problems and cost-effective manufacturing techniques. The gap waveguide technology shows interesting characteristics as a new waveguide structure. It may be suitable to fill the existing gap between the planar transmission lines, such as microstrip, coplanar waveguide and substrate integrated waveguide and the non-planar hollow waveguides in terms of performance, such as loss and fabrication flexibility at high frequencies. Gap waveguide has a planar profile, and it can be used as low loss distribution network for an antenna array. This thesis mainly focuses on passive components design, in particular array antennas and bandpass filters based on gap waveguide technology. We present several low-profile multilayer corporate-fed slot array antennas with high gain, high effciency and wide impedance bandwidth for the 60 -GHz band. The aim of this thesis is to demonstrate the advantages of gap waveguide technology as an alternative to the traditional guiding structures to overcome the problem of good electrical contact due to mechanical assembly with low loss. The main challenge of gap waveguide components is the realization of the textured structure (pin surface) with a cost-effective manufacturing method. Due to the relatively complex pattern and physical dimensions of the textured structure, the fabrication of the gap prototypes introduces a challenging task, especially at millimeter wave frequencies. Therefore, we are continuously searching for effective alternative methods.
