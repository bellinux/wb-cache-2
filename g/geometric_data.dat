40|$|AbstractIn this paper, we {{consider}} the problem of semi-supervised dimensionality reduction. We focus on the local <b>geometric</b> structure of <b>data</b> and propose a novel method, called Semi-supervised Locality Discriminant Projections (SSLDP). It uses both labeled and unlabeled samples. Specifically, the labeled samples are used to explore the discriminating ainformation including both similarity and dissimilarity information, while the unlabeled samples are used to estimate the intrinsic <b>geometric</b> structure of <b>data.</b> Thus, SSLDP learns a discriminant projection which can best preserve both the discriminating structure and the local <b>geometric</b> structure of <b>data.</b> We evaluate SSLDP in the similarity measure which {{plays a key role}} in most of the information processing tasks. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our algorithm...|$|R
2500|$|... 3D {{modeling}} is {{the process}} of developing a mathematical, wireframe representation of any three-dimensional object, called a [...] "3D model", via specialized software. Models may be created automatically or manually; the manual modeling process of preparing <b>geometric</b> <b>data</b> for 3D computer graphics is similar to plastic arts such as sculpting. 3D models may be created using multiple approaches: use of NURBs to generate accurate and smooth surface patches, polygonal mesh modeling (manipulation of faceted geometry), or polygonal mesh subdivision (advanced tessellation of polygons, resulting in smooth surfaces similar to NURB models). A 3D model can be displayed as a two-dimensional image through a process called 3D rendering, used in a computer simulation of physical phenomena, or animated directly for other purposes. The model can also be physically created using 3D Printing devices.|$|E
2500|$|Connections are {{of central}} {{importance}} in modern geometry {{in large part}} because they allow a comparison between the local geometry at one point and the local geometry at another point. [...] Differential geometry embraces several variations on the connection theme, which fall into two major groups: the infinitesimal and the local theory. [...] The local theory concerns itself primarily with notions of parallel transport and holonomy. [...] The infinitesimal theory concerns itself with the differentiation of <b>geometric</b> <b>data.</b> [...] Thus a covariant derivative is a way of specifying a derivative of a vector field along another vector field on a manifold. [...] A Cartan connection is a way of formulating some aspects of connection theory using differential forms and Lie groups. [...] An Ehresmann connection is a connection in a fibre bundle or a principal bundle by specifying the allowed directions of motion of the field. [...] A Koszul connection is a connection generalizing the derivative in a vector bundle.|$|E

40|$|The {{distinctly}} non-random {{diversity of}} organismal form {{manifests itself in}} discrete clusters of taxa that share a common body plan. As a result, analyses of disparity require a scalable comparative framework. The difficulties of applying geometric morphometrics to disparity analyses of groups with vastly divergent body plans are overcome partly {{by the use of}} cladistic characters. Character-based disparity analyses have become increasingly popular, {{but it is not clear}} how they are affected by character coding strategies or revisions of primary homology statements. Indeed, whether cladistic and morphometric data capture similar patterns of morphological variation remains a moot point. To address this issue, we employ both cladistic and <b>geometric</b> morphometric <b>data</b> in an exploratory study of disparity focussing on caecilian amphibians. Our results show no impact on relative intertaxon distances when different coding strategies for cladistic characters were used or when revised concepts of homology were considered. In all instances, we found no statistically significant difference between pairwise Euclidean and Procrustes distances, although the strength of the correlation among distance matrices varied. This suggests that cladistic and <b>geometric</b> morphometric <b>data</b> appear to summarize morphological variation in comparable ways. Our results support the use of cladistic data for characterizing organismal disparity...|$|R
