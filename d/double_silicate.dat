40|$|The {{material}} characteristics and elastic properties of aluminum substituted 11 tobermorite in the relict lime clasts of 2000 year old Roman seawater harbor concrete are described with TGDSC and 29 Si MAS NMR studies, along with nanoscale tomography, X ray microdiffraction, and high pressure X ray diffraction synchroton radiation applications. The crystals have aluminum substitution for silicon in tetrahedral bridging and branching sites and 11. 49 3 interlayer [002] spacing. The experimentally measured bulk modulus, 55 5 GPa, {{is less than}} ab initio and molecular dynamics models for pure tobermorite with a <b>double</b> <b>silicate</b> chain structure, perhaps because Al 3 substitution for Si 4 produces increased interlayer spacing and weakened bonds at bridging and branching sites. Even so, Ko, is substantially higher than C A S H in slag concrete. Based on nanoscale tomographic study, the crystal clusters form a well connected solid, despite having about 52 porosity. In the pumiceous cementitious matrix, Al tobermorite with 11. 27 interlayer spacing is locally associated with phillipsite, similar to geologic occrrences in basaltic tephra. The ancient concretes provide a sustainable prototype for producing Al tobermorite in high performance concretes with natural volcanic pozzolan...|$|E

The diffraction {{pattern of the}} final phase points to an orthorhombic (or pseudo-orthorhombic) "family cell" with a 11. 2, b' 3. 67, c 20. 1 A. The b' unit-cell parameter is typical for the average structure {{of the members of}} the tobermorite group. Completely streaked reflections double the b' periodicity, indicating that the true b parameter is equal to 7. 3 Å, which is characteristic for wollastonite-like chains. The a unit-cell parameter of the "family cell" of tobermorite 10 Å is doubled with respect to that of the other tobermorite-group minerals (11. 2 instead of 5. 6 Å). Through the application of the OD theory, a structural model is proposed and the atomic positions of one of the two possible MDO polytypes have been refined, using a set of 399 reflections, up to a R 1 = 15. 7 %. Notwithstanding the quite high reliability index, the main structural features of tobermorite 10 Å could be observed. Its structure consists of layers of six- and seven-fold coordinated Ca cations, linked together by <b>double</b> <b>silicate</b> chains, with a conformation similar to that present in xonotlite. Additional information has been obtained through 29 Si nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and micro-Raman spectroscopies. Si Single Pulse Excitation Magic Angle Spinning (SPEMAS) spectra show the occurrence of two main sets of peaks, related to Q 2 and Q 3 sites, respectively, confirming the presence of <b>double</b> <b>silicate</b> chains. An additional weak peak at - 106 ppm, typical of Q 4 sites, may be interpreted as due to minor amorphous silica. In addition, the Si Cross-Polarization Magic Angle Spinning (CPMAS) spectra indicate that H 2 O is present in tobermorite 10 A and that Si-OH bonds are present prevalently in the bridging Q 3 tetrahedra. The results of the micro-Raman spectroscopy are in agreement with those of the NMR study, indicating the occurrence of double chains. The observed conformation of the double chains can be easily reached through the shrinking of clinotobermorite-like chains. An intermediate clinotobermorite-like phase was actually observed during the topotactic transformation from tobermorite 11 Å to tobermorite 10 Å. The comparison between structural, X-ray powder diffraction, and micro-Raman spectroscopic data on tobermorite 10 Å and oyelite allows to exclude that oyelite may be the natural counterpart of tobermorite 10 Å. On the contrary, similarities between the tobermorite 10 Å obtained in this study and its analogue obtained in hydrothermal synthesis experiments are clear...|$|E
40|$|Ancient Roman syntheses of Al-tobermorite in a 2000 -year-old {{concrete}} block submerged in the Bay of Pozzuoli (Baianus Sinus), near Naples, have unique aluminum-rich and silica-poor compositions relative to hydrothermal geological occurrences. In relict lime clasts, the crystals have calcium contents {{that are similar}} to ideal tobermorite, 33 to 35 wt%, but the low-silica contents, 39 to 40 wt%, reflect Al 3 + substitution for Si 4 + in Q 2 (1 Al), Q 3 (1 Al), and Q 3 (2 Al) tetrahedral chain and branching sites. The Al-tobermorite has a <b>double</b> <b>silicate</b> chain structure with long chain lengths in the b [020] crystallographic direction, and wide interlayer spacing, 11. 49 Å. Na+ and K+ partially balance Al 3 + substitution for Si 4 +. Poorly crystalline calcium-aluminum-silicate-hydrate (C-A-S-H) cementitious binder in the dissolved perimeter of relict lime clasts has Ca/(Si+Al) = 0. 79, nearly identical to the Al-tobermorite, but nanoscale heterogeneities with aluminum in both tetrahedral and octahedral coordination. The concrete is about 45 vol% glassy zeolitic tuff and 55 vol% hydrated lime-volcanic ash mortar; lime formed < 10 wt% of the mix. Trace element studies confirm that the pyroclastic rock comes from Flegrean Fields volcanic district, as described in ancient Roman texts. An adiabatic thermal model of the 10 m 2 by 5. 7 m thick Baianus Sinus breakwater from heat evolved through hydration of lime and formation of C-A-S-H suggests maximum temperatures of 85 to 97 °C. Cooling to seawater temperatures occurred in two years. These elevated temperatures and the mineralizing effects of sea-water and alkali- and alumina-rich volcanic ash appear to be critical to Al-tobermorite crystallization. The long-term stability of the Al-tobermorite provides a valuable context to improve future syntheses in innovative concretes with advanced properties using volcanic pozzolans...|$|E

40|$|Clinotobermorite, Ca 5 Si 6 O 17 · 5 H 2 O, {{is a rare}} mineral, {{structurally}} {{related to}} tobermorite 11 Å. It {{is characterized by the}} presence of structural disorder (evidenced by the diffuseness of the reflections with k odd) which, until now, prevented the determination of its real structure. In this paper, a model for the real structure of clinotobermorite is proposed on the basis of OD theory, through examination of the X-ray diffraction pattern of a sample coming from the Wessels mine (South Africa). The proposed model, which assumes the presence of silicate double chains of wollastonite-type, is confirmed by structural refinements carried out for the two polytypes with maximum degree of order (MDO). The MDO 1 polytype of clinotobermorite (monoclinic, space group Cc, a = 11. 276 (2), b = 7. 3427 (8), c = 22. 642 (4) Å, β = 97. 28 (1) °) was refined up to R = 0. 15, whereas the two refinements performed on the MDO 2 polytype (triclinic, space group C 1, a = 11. 274 (2), b = 7. 3439 (7), c = 11. 468 (2) Å, α = 99. 18 (1), β = 97. 19 (1), γ = 90. 09 (1) °) converged to R = 0. 12 and R = 0. 10, respectively. In clinotobermorite infinite calcium polyhedral layers parallel to (001) are connected through <b>double</b> <b>silicate</b> chains [Si 6 O 17] 10 - running along b; additional calcium cations and H 2 O molecules are placed in the channels of the resulting framework. By dehydration at 225 °C, clinotobermorite transforms topotactically into a new phase, which also displays an OD character. The results of the structural refinement carried out for its triclinic MDO 2 polytype (space group C 1 ̄, a = 11. 156 (5), b = 7. 303 (3), c = 9. 566 (5) Å, α = 101. 08 (4), β = 92. 83 (5), γ = 89. 98 (4) °) indicate that this phase, with crystal chemical formula Ca 5 Si 6 O 16 (OH) 2, exhibits single chains of wollastonite-type, resulting from decondensation of the double chains.

On {{the basis of the}} observed gallery heights (~ 7. 0 -~ 7. 2 ~) and 29 Si MAS NMR spectra that indicated the presence of Q 2, Q 3, and Q 4 SiO 4 sites, the intercalated silicate anions, which are formed by condensation reactions of silanol groups and partial neutralization f SiOH groups with gallery hydroxide ions, are assigned short chain structures. Also, some O 3 SiOH groups become grafted to the LDH layers by con-densation with MOH groups on the gallery surfaces. The LDH-silicates exhibited comparable non-microporous N 2 BET surface areas in the range 59 - 85 m 2 /g, but they differed substantially in acid/base reactivities, asjudged by their elative activities for the catalytic dehydration/disproportionation of 2 -methyl- 3 -butyn- 2 -ol (MBOH). Under reaction conditions where the LDH structure is retained (150 "C), all the silicate intercalates showed mainly basic reactivities for the disproportionation of MBOH to acetone and acetylene. However, all the LDH silicates were less reactive than the corresponding LDH carbonates. Conversion of the LDH silicates to metal oxides at 450 "C introduced acidic activity for MBOH dehy-dration, whereas the metal oxides formed by LDH carbonate decomposition were exclusivity basic under analogous conditions.

The clay dispersion and morphology obtained in the extruded nanocomposite samples were fully characterised both after processing and during photo-oxidation by a number of complementary analytical techniques. The effects of the compatibiliser, the organoclay modifier (quartenary alkyl ammonium surfactant) and the clays on the behaviour of the nanocomposites during processing and under accelerated weathering conditions were investigated. X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), rheometry and attenuated reflectance spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) showed that the nanocomposite structure obtained is dependent on the type of clay used, {{the presence or absence of}} a compatibiliser and the environment the samples are exposed to. The results revealed that during processing PE/clay nanocomposites are formed in the presence of the compatibiliser PEgMA giving a hybrid exfoliated and intercalated structures, while microcomposites were obtained in the absence of PEgMA; the unmodified NaMMT-containing samples showed encapsulated clay structures with limited extent of dispersion in the polymer matrix. The effect of processing on the thermal stability of the OMMT-containing polymer samples was determined by measuring the additional amount of vinyl-type unsaturation formed due to a Hoffman elimination reaction that takes place in the alkyl ammonium surfactant of the modified clay at elevated temperatures. The results indicate that OMMT is responsible for the higher levels of unsaturation found in OMMT-PE samples when compared to both the polymer control and the NaMMT-PE samples and confirms the instability of the alkyl ammonium surfactant during melt processing and its deleterious effects on the durability aspects of nanocomposite products. The photostability of the PE/clay nanocomposites under accelerated weathering conditions was monitored by following changes in their infrared signatures and mechanical properties. The rate of photo-oxidation of the compatibilised PE/PEgMA/OMMT nanocomposites was much higher than that of the PE/OMMT (in absence of PEgMA) counterparts, the polymer controls and the PE–NaMMT sample. Several factors have been observed that can explain the difference in the photo-oxidative stability of the PE/clay nanocomposites including the adverse role played by the thermal decomposition products of the alkyl ammonium surfactant, the photo-instability of PEgMA, unfavourable interactions between PEgMA and products formed in the polymer as a consequence of the degradation of the surfactant on the clay, as well as a contribution from a much higher extent of exfoliated structures, determined by TEM, formed with increasing UV-exposure times...|$|R

The structural model of Tinaksite proposed by Petrunina [1] was validated and improved by von Bissert [3] in 1980, who observed a more regular tetrahedra conformation. The tinaksite investigated by von Bissert [3] is triclinic with chemical composition: NaK 2 Ca 2 Ti[3 Si 7 O 19]OH.

In this work, the cation partition derived from SCXRD and EPMA data, is presented. The structure has been anisotropically refined up to an R(F) = 0. 025 (for 5238 observed reflections with Fo > (Fo)). Tinaksite exhibits straight channels parallel to [001] direction, formed by <b>double</b> chains of <b>silicate.</b> The channels are stretched approximately along [110] direction, with maximum dimension 10. 972 (2) Å. The highest peak in the Fourier difference map is related to some structural disorder inside the Ti octahedron. This disorder likely can be ascribed to the entrance of the large K substituting the six-fold coordinated Na atom. As a matter of fact, the replacing of Na for K changes the coordination number of the polyhedron from 6 to 7, which seems to influence the neighbouring Ti atom position. Another point concerns the K 1 and K 2 atoms located inside the channels. According to von Bissert [3], the higher K 1 thermal parameter with respect to the K 2 one indicates the site filled by K 1 is disorder. The structural refinement shows that K 1 atom is located over at least three different positions. A charge distribution analysis, performed by means of the Chardi-It software [4], has returned an ECON number [5] of 11 and 9 for the K 1 and K 2, respectively. The bond distances for the three K atoms, related to K 1, show these atoms are not always bonded to the same oxygens.

In 1980 von Bissert [3] confirmed the general structure architecture of tinaksite proposed by Petranunia [1], but found a more regular tetrahedral conformation.

In this work, the cation partition, derived by means of SCXRD and EMPA measurements, is presented. The structure has been anisotropically refined to a R(F) = 0. 025 (for 5238 observed reflections with Fo > 3 (Fo)). The highest peak in the Fourier difference map seems due to some structural disorder inside the Ti octahedron. This disorder likely is related to the entrance of the large K in place of six-fold coordinated Na atom. The replacing of Na by K seems to change the coordination number of the polyhedron from 6 to 7, so perturbing the neighbouring Ti atom position. Another point of interest concerns the K 1 and K 2 potassium atom located inside the system of one-dimensional channels of the structure, formed by <b>double</b> chains of <b>silicate.</b> According to von Bissert [3], the higher K 1 thermal parameters with respect to the K 2 one indicates the disorder on K 1 site.

The basic structural unit of all investigated compounds is the V 4 +O 5 pyramid arranged in layers. Besides structural characterisation alternative synthetic routes were explored. The work focuses on detailed single crystal and powder X-ray diffraction studies, for selected compounds magnetometric measurements were performed. For low-temperature measurements a split coldhead closed cycle He refrigerator was adapted to the image plate diffractometer IPDS I. The most important results are summed in the following:CaV 4 O 9 : The tetragonal compound consists of V 4 O 9 layers that are characterised by interacting quadripartite V units (metaplaquettes). It is the first known two-dimensional spin-gap compound. Crystals were grown by flux synthesis at moderate temperatures for the first time. The material shows no structural phase transition in the temperature range 20 K to 320 K. It reaches a minimum in the a lattice parameter at 150 K and a change in the slope of the c lattice parameter is observed at the same temperature. Magnetometric measurements confirm the presence of a broad susceptibility maximum at ~ 110 K and the presence of a gap in the magnetic excitation spectrum at low temperatures. A 2 V 4 O 9 •LiCl (A= Rb, K) : These two isostructural compounds, which form a solid solution series were grown from the flux. They are structurally related to CaV 4 O 9. The temperature dependence is different from that observed for the former; no structural phase transition was observed at low temperatures. The magnetometric measurements show a broad transition at T= 60 K for the Rb compound, possibly a transition from the paramagnetic to the antiferromagnetic state. This needs to be checked by neutron scattering. A 2 V 4 O 9 (A= Rb, Cs) : Investigated crystals of Rb 2 V 4 O 9 and beta-Cs 2 V 4 O 9 have a structure which deviates from the aforementioned plaquette compounds. The edge sharing VO 5 pyramids point to {{the same side of the}} V 4 O 9 layer and form V 2 O 8 dimer units. The structure of Rb 2 V 4 O 9 was determined in space group P- 4 n 2 contrary to previously reported results. Between RT and 100 K no structural phase transition was observed. At T= 190 K and T= 200 K a locking in of the dimers at a minimum V-V distance was seen. Magnetic properties in these substances are dominated by the interaction between the dimers within the V 4 O 9 layers. AV 3 O 7 (A= Ca, Sr) : It was found that these two compounds are not isostructural contrary to the assumption made in previous works. Single crystal structure determination shows that SrV 3 O 7 crystallizes in space group Pmmn. No structural phase transition was observed between RT and 100 K. For both compounds the in-plane lattice parameter perpendicular to the infinite chains of edge sharing VO 5 pyramids within the V 3 O 7 layer shows a negative linear thermal expansion coefficient which results from a competition of increasing buckling and thermal expansion of the layer. Given the fact that the two compounds are not isostructural the differently oriented magnetic spin structures reported for the two compounds should be readdressed. Rb 2 V 3 O 8 : The structure of this mixed valence compound shows a negative linear thermal expansion coefficient within the V 3 O 8 layers between RT and 14 K. This is a result of a combination of a stretching of the VO 4 tetrahedra in the a 1 a 2 layer and a translation of the VO 5 pyramids along c. Li 2 (VO) SiO 4 : Single crystal and powder diffraction indicates very weak temperature dependence of the structure. A maximum of the magnetic susceptibility was observed at ~ 8 K, confirming the results of previous works. Crystals of the two noncentrosymmetric V 4 + and Cu 2 + bearing compounds Rb 2 (VO) 2 [Si 8 O 19] and Cs 2 Cl 2 CuV 2 O 6 that display potentially interesting magnetic properties have been grown.
