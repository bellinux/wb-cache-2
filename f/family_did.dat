5|$|The younger Del Valle and his <b>family</b> <b>did</b> {{not live}} on the ranch initially, instead {{settling}} in a house on what is now Olvera Street in Los Angeles. The Del Valle <b>family</b> <b>did</b> not move back to Camulos, which he had expanded, until 1861. During this time, the ranch was overseen by José Antonio Salazar, Del Valle's majordomo. Although the rancho was associated with Ramona and Mexican California, the house was not constructed until after the United States acquired the territory and California was admitted as a state. The Del Valle family never lived there under Mexican rule.|$|E

He further added that Daniel had died on his father's birthday, and his mother has consequently become a psychiatry patient unable to work.|$|E

5|$|Duncan's reign was not {{successful}} {{and he was}} killed by Macbeth on 15 August 1040. Although Shakespeare's Macbeth presents Malcolm as a grown man and his father as an old one, it appears that Duncan was still young in 1040, and Malcolm and his brother Donalbane were children. Malcolm's <b>family</b> <b>did</b> attempt to overthrow Macbeth in 1045, but Malcolm's grandfather Crínán of Dunkeld was killed in the attempt.|$|E

5|$|They wrote frequently, and by March 1920, Scott {{had sent}} Zelda his mother's ring, {{and the two}} had become engaged.

5|$|Although Jewish, Levi's <b>family</b> <b>did</b> not {{practise}} their religion, {{and were}} not part of the Jewish community, but when she was enrolled at the Victoria School (now the Bettina School) in Frankfurt, her religion was listed as Jewish. Religious instruction was compulsory, so she had to attend classes with a local rabbi. She soon rebelled against this, and told her parents that she did not wish to attend the classes. She came to reject formal religion.|$|E

Alessandro's older brother, Stefano, briefly played professional football for Sampdoria before an injury curtailed his career; he later worked as Alessandro's agent. The family lived in the hamlet of Saccon, a rural home in San Vendemiano. While growing up, Del Piero's <b>family</b> <b>did</b> not have much money for travelling abroad, so he considered being a lorry driver in order to see the world.|$|E
5|$|Brodie was {{a native}} of Chicago, the son of Latvian Jewish {{immigrants}} who was alienated from both his family and his family's religion. A bright, emotional graduate student in international relations, Brodie eventually became a noted expert in military strategy during the Cold War era. The McKays were horrified at their daughter's impending marriage; Dilworth Jensen felt betrayed. David O. McKay went to Chicago to warn his niece of the family's strong objections. Out of consideration for her mother, Fawn scheduled the wedding in an LDS chapel, but of the McKays, only Fawn's mother attended. None of Brodie's <b>family</b> <b>did.</b>|$|E

Hubbard lived over a hundred miles from the Blackfeet reservation. While some sources support Scientology's claim of Hubbard's blood brotherhood, other sources say that the tribe did not practice blood brotherhood and no evidence has been found that he had ever been a Blackfeet blood brother.|$|E

She also talks to a former trafficker and parents of trafficked children. One trafficked boy says {{that he can not}} go back home because his mother is ill. A mother who trafficked her daughter describes how her <b>family</b> <b>did</b> not have enough food, and how even though they never received the promised payments for her daughter's work, at least she was fed.|$|E
5|$|Johnson was inexperienced in relationships, but {{the well-to-do}} widow {{encouraged}} him and provided for {{him with her}} substantial savings. The two were married on 9 July 1735, at St. Werburgh's Church in Derby. The Porter <b>family</b> <b>did</b> not approve of the match, partly because Johnson was 25 and Elizabeth was 21 years his elder. His mother's marriage to Johnson so disgusted her son Jervis that he stopped talking to her. Her other son Joseph later accepted the marriage, and her daughter, Lucy, accepted Johnson from the start.|$|E

5|$|One of Glynne's main {{interests}} was mountaineering {{and rock}} climbing, although her <b>family</b> <b>did</b> {{not support the}} hobby, as her mother's cousin, Owen Glynne Jones {{died at the age}} of 32 in a climbing accident on Dent Blanche. Despite this, Glynne climbed throughout her life, including in Australia and New Zealand whilst she was touring there. She recorded the second ever ascent of Mount Spencer in New Zealand, the first by a woman. When she returned to Europe, she climbed major Alpine peaks such as Matterhorn, Mont Blanc, La Meije and Aiguille du Dru in the 1930s. She carried on climbing into her 60s, ascending Mount Fuji in Japan in 1963.|$|E
5|$|Reines sang in a chorus, {{and as a}} soloist.
