40|$|Abstract: Currently, serum is {{used more}} often than urine to detect {{prostate}} specific antigen (PSA). The need for a non-invasive test yielding similar results led us to develop a <b>urine</b> <b>test</b> that uses solar irradiated water as a reactant species. To develop this technology, seven reagents plus one control were produced by exposure of water for 40 days in sunlight to {{the colors of the}} visible spectrum through colored cellophane, control being an unwrapped bottle of sterile water. Patients (127) were examined for serum PSA and the <b>urine</b> was <b>tested</b> using the above reagents. A positive <b>urine</b> <b>test</b> was observed with yellow-filtered irradiated water which absorbed at 454 nm. Twenty-five of the 45 patients with positive results for the <b>urine</b> <b>test</b> had PSA levels of 0. 21 - 4. 0 ng/ml. Thus, this pilot study describes a non-invasive <b>urine</b> <b>test</b> mainly positive in patients with PSA 0. 21 - 4. 0 ng/ml...|$|R

40|$|Background: A new rapid <b>urine</b> <b>test</b> was {{developed}} to detect anti-Helicobacter pylori antibody in urine using the principle of immunochromatography. The accuracy of this test in the Chinese population remains to be defined. Aim: To evaluate a new rapid <b>urine</b> <b>test</b> for the diagnosis of H. pylori infection in the Chinese population. Methods: Eligible patients without previous treatment of H. pylori were recruited. In-house rapid urease test and histology were used as the gold standard. The rapid <b>urine</b> <b>test</b> (RAPIRUN H. pylori antibody) was performed {{and the results were}} compared with the gold standard. Results: One hundred and twenty-three patients were eligible for analysis and 61 (50 %) were H. pylori positive by the gold standard. The rapid <b>urine</b> <b>test</b> showed a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy of 96. 7 %, 95. 2 %, 95. 2 %, 96. 7 % and 95. 9 %, respectively.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{improve the}} {{specificity}} in prostate cancer diagnosis {{and to prevent}} unnecessary prostate biopsies, especially in the serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) "gray zone" between 3 and 15 ng/mL, the implementation of prostate cancer-specific markers is urgently needed. The recently discovered prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA 3) is such a promising prostate cancer marker. In a previous single institution study, the PCA 3 <b>urine</b> <b>test</b> clearly proved to be of diagnostic value. Therefore, the diagnostic performance of the PCA 3 <b>urine</b> <b>test</b> was validated in a multicenter study. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The first voided urine after digital rectal examination was collected from a total of 583 men with serum PSA levels between 3 and 15 ng/mL who were to undergo prostate biopsies. We determined the PCA 3 score in these samples and correlated the results {{with the results of}} the prostate biopsies. RESULTS: A total of 534 men (92 %) had an informative sample. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve, a measure of the diagnostic accuracy of a test, was 0. 66 for the PCA 3 <b>urine</b> <b>test</b> and 0. 57 for serum PSA. The sensitivity for the PCA 3 <b>urine</b> <b>test</b> was 65 %, the specificity was 66 % (versus 47 % for serum PSA), and the negative predictive value was 80 %. CONCLUSIONS: In this multicenter study, we validated the diagnostic performance of the PCA 3 <b>urine</b> <b>test</b> in the largest group studied thus far using a PCA 3 gene-based test. This study shows that the PCA 3 <b>urine</b> <b>test,</b> when used as a reflex test, can improve the specificity in prostate cancer diagnosis and could prevent many unnecessary prostate biopsies...|$|R
