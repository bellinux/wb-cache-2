5|$|Archduke Charles {{traveled}} to Villa Pianore {{and asked for}} Zita’s hand and, on 13 June 1911, their engagement was announced at the Austrian court. Zita in later years recalled that after her engagement she had expressed to Charles her worries {{about the fate of}} the Austrian Empire and the challenges of the monarchy. Charles and Zita were married at the Schwarzau castle on 21 October 1911. Charles's great-uncle, the 81-year-old Emperor Franz Joseph, attended the wedding. He was relieved to see an heir make a suitable marriage, and was in good spirits, even leading the toast at the wedding breakfast. Archduchess Zita soon conceived a son, and Otto was born 20 November 1912. Seven more children would <b>follow</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> next decade.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{condition}} of the northerly pass it was decided to leave divisional artillery to <b>follow</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning, guarded by the 15th (Imperial Service) Cavalry Brigade. So it was that only the 13th and 14th Cavalry Brigades of the 5th Cavalry Division which entered the Esdraelon Plain on the morning of 20 September. Despite orders to the contrary, the 14th Cavalry Brigade advanced directly towards Afulah, the objective of the 4th Cavalry Division. Only the 13th Cavalry Brigade was therefore available to attack 5th Cavalry Division's objective at Nazareth. This brigade was not sufficiently strong to capture the town and the Yildirim Army Group headquarters and Liman von Sanders escaped. The next day, after the German and Ottoman garrison had retreated, Nazareth was occupied by the 13th Cavalry Brigade.|$|E

Kennedy. If elected, Dodd would have become the second Roman Catholic president (after Kennedy) and the second Connecticut-born president (after George W. Bush). He would have been the first Senator to win the presidency while in office since Kennedy was elected in 1960 (that honor ultimately went to Barack Obama). After his withdrawal from the race, Dodd went on to endorse the eventual winner Barack Obama, and retired from the Senate in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Growing up {{as part of}} a lucha libre {{family the}} future Espanto Jr. decided he wanted to <b>follow</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{footsteps}} of his father and grandfather at an early age. In a 2010 interview he recalled how he would be in the front row watching his father wrestle from the time he could walk. In 1996 his father suffered an injury during a match and was briefly clinically dead while in the ring until he was revived. While the injury left a big impression on the then-10 year old he later accepted that it was an accident and {{tried not to think about}} it, but did comment that his mother still worried about him every time he competed.|$|E
5|$|In 1929 Kennan {{began his}} program on history, politics, culture, and the Russian {{language}} at the University of Berlin's Oriental Institute.

During {{the course of his}} diplomatic career, Kennan would master a number of other languages, including German, French, Polish, Czech, Portuguese, and Norwegian.|$|E

5|$|In late 2013, a {{plan was}} {{proposed}} for salvage logging approximately 30,000 acres (120km2) of the Rim Fire. The snag forest habitat of forest-killed trees {{is home to}} a wide variety of wildlife, some of which are management indicator species. Many scientists and conservation groups opposed the logging plan, contending that the removal of trees from this area would harm species such as black-backed woodpeckers and affect other cavity-nesting birds that <b>follow</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wake of the woodpeckers. Other species of wildlife were also considered be at risk from salvage logging, such as frogs that inhabit forested streams and deer. Native plants and basic ecological succession of the forest are also reportedly harmed by salvage logging. However, some environmental groups endorsed the salvage logging plan.|$|E
5|$|Kingship had its ritual aspects. The {{kings of}} Dál Riata were inaugurated by putting their {{foot in a}} {{footprint}} carved in stone, signifying that they would <b>follow</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> footsteps of their predecessors. The kingship of the unified kingdom of Alba had Scone and its sacred stone {{at the heart of}} its coronation ceremony, which historians presume was inherited from Pictish practices. Iona, the early centre of Scottish Christianity, became the burial site of the early kings of Scotland until the eleventh century, when the House of Canmore adopted Dunfermline near Scone.|$|E

That Espanto Jr., Jesús Andrade Salas, was allowed to use the name by Espanto II. Later on other Espantos would <b>follow</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{footsteps}} of the character that Eusebio Vázquez created, including his nephews Espanto IV and V, Los Hijos del Espanto, Espantito, and a new Espanto Jr., son of the original Espanto.|$|E

The quartet recorded an EP, which a taxi-driving friend of theirs helped promote. They took their {{name from the}} experience had by passengers first hearing their music on a taxi ride. After their music was heard by an executive from record label Warner, the band signed a contract and released their debut album, Imaginate, in 1999. This was followed by 2002's Garage Mahal. Both albums were certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA). 2005's Axiomatic did not <b>follow</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> success of its predecessors.|$|E
5|$|Rex Ryan and his fraternal twin, Rob, {{were born}} in Ardmore, Oklahoma, on December 13, 1962, to Doris and Buddy Ryan. When the boys were aged two, their parents {{amicably}} divorced. Following the divorce, their mother attended the University of Chicago to earn her doctorate. Rex, Rob, and their older brother Jim moved with her to Toronto, Ontario, Canada, where she secured an administrative position at the University of Toronto. During {{the course of his}} upbringing, Rex wanted to <b>follow</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> footsteps of his father, a defensive pioneer in the NFL known for developing the 46 defense, and by the age of six, Rex and Rob knew they wanted to pursue coaching careers.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after losing}} Super Bowl XLI, Hester and special teams coach Dave Toub spent a {{significant}} amount of time working on new return strategies and formations. Ultimately, Lovie Smith converted Hester into a wide receiver in order {{to increase the number of}} opportunities he would receive during a game. Hester, who originally played as a wide receiver at the University of Miami, was initially hesitant about making the switch to offense, as he wished to <b>follow</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> footsteps of Deion Sanders. However, the Bears’ coaching staff eventually persuaded Hester to make the transition over the summer. During the 2007 off-season, Hester won the Best Breakthrough Athlete ESPY Award.|$|E

5|$|The La3+ ion is similarly-sized to {{the early}} {{lanthanides}} of the cerium group (those up to samarium and europium) that immediately <b>follow</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> periodic table, and hence it tends to occur along with them in phosphate, silicate and carbonate minerals, such as monazite (MIIIPO4) and bastnäsite (MIIICO3F), where M refers to all the rare earth metals except scandium and the radioactive promethium (mostly Ce, La, and Y). Bastnäsite is usually lacking in thorium and the heavy lanthanides, and the purification of the light lanthanides from it is less involved. The ore, after being crushed and ground, is first treated with hot concentrated sulfuric acid, evolving carbon dioxide, hydrogen fluoride, and silicon tetrafluoride: the product is then dried and leached with water, leaving the early lanthanide ions, including lanthanum, in solution.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} 1940, {{the threat}} of {{invasion}} had dissipated and the Australian troops that {{had been sent to}} the United Kingdom were transferred to the Middle East. Travelling by train from Colchester to Glasgow in January 1941, {{the main body of the}} battalion embarked upon the transport Nea Hellas and sailed via Freetown and Durban. They reached Egypt in early March 1941 where the 25th Brigade, was assigned to the 7th Division. Moving to a camp in Palestine, the battalion's fourth rifle company– designated 'D' Company– was taken on strength, having previously been formed at Beit Jirja in September 1940 from excess reinforcements from the 6th Division. At the time, the 7th Division was preparing to go to Greece, to <b>follow</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wake of the 6th Division; however, the entry of the Afrika Korps into the fighting in the Western Desert and early German successes prompted their movement to the fortress at Mersa Metruh, to guard against a possible German advance into Egypt from Libya.|$|E
