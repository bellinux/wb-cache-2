40|$|Urbanization is {{considered}} a main indicator of regional economic development due to its positive effect on promoting industrial development; however, many regions, especially developing countries, have troubled in its negative effect—the aggravating environmental pollution. Many researchers have addressed that the rapid urbanization stimulated {{the expansion of the}} industrial production and increased the <b>industrial</b> <b>pollutant</b> emissions. However, this statement is exposed to a grave drawback in that urbanization not only expands industrial production but also improves labor productivity and changes industrial structure. To make up this drawback, we first decompose the influence of urbanization impacts on the <b>industrial</b> <b>pollutant</b> emissions into the scale effect, the intensive effect, and the structure effect by using the Kaya Identity and the LMDI Method; second, we perform an empirical study of the three effects by applying the spatial panel model {{on the basis of the}} data from 282 prefecture-level cities of China from 2003 to 2014. Our results indicate that (1) there are significant reverse U-shapes between China’s urbanization rate and the volume of industrial wastewater discharge, sulfur dioxide emissions and soot (dust) emissions; (2) the relationship between China’s urbanization and the <b>industrial</b> <b>pollutant</b> emissions depends on the scale effect, the intensive effect and the structure effect jointly. Specifically, the scale effect and the structure effect tend to aggravate the industrial wastewater discharge, the sulfur dioxide emissions and the soot (dust) emissions in China’s cities, while the intensive effect results in decreasing the three types of <b>industrial</b> <b>pollutant</b> emissions; (3) there are significant spatial autocorrelations of the <b>industrial</b> <b>pollutant</b> emissions among China’s cities, but the spatial spillover effect is non-existent or non-significant. We attempt to explain this contradiction due to the fact that the vast rural areas around China’s cities serve as sponge belts and absorb the spatial spillover of the <b>industrial</b> <b>pollutant</b> emissions from cities. According to the results, we argue the decomposition of the three effects is necessary and meaningful, it establishes a cornerstone in understanding the definite relationship between urbanization and <b>industrial</b> <b>pollutant</b> emissions, and effectively contributes to the relative policy making...|$|R

40|$|Water is {{considered}} fundamental to development {{due to its}} contribution to economic growth and human welfare. Yet, most human activities such as agriculture, domestic and industrial pollute water resources. Industries use water in different processes and if not well managed, they pollute water bodies. The study assessed the levels of <b>industrial</b> <b>pollutants</b> and their effects on water resources and livelihoods along Msimbazi sub catchment. Specifically, the study determined the types and abundance of pollutants discharged by industries, levels of <b>industrial</b> <b>pollutants</b> and their effects on water resources and livelihoods. It also reviewed relevant aspects of {{the implementation of the}} relevant aspect of Tanzania National Industrial Policy on cleaner production and how they relate with <b>industrial</b> <b>pollutants.</b> Primary and secondary methods of data collection were used. Primary methods of data collection such as in situ measurements, laboratory analysis of water samples, structured questionnaires, interview guides as well as observation. Secondary data were collected from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). Different documentations were reviewed to compare data collected through primary methods. Data were analyzed using both quantitative and qualitative methods. The quantitative techniques included descriptive statistics such as cross-tabulation, frequencies, percentages and means which was done using Statistical Packages for Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 18. 0 and Microsoft Excel 2007. Qualitative data was analyzed using Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) analysis. The results show that the types and abundance of pollutants discharged by industries along the sub catchment were higher and to some points exceeding the World Health Organization (WHO) and Tanzania Bureau of Standards (TBS) standards. Pollutants such as COD was found to be the highest at Vingunguti with the COD of 2451. 57 mg/l and Tabata 1 recorded 879. 39 mg/l. Turbidity was higher at Vingunguti with 674 NTU and Kigogo 2 which had 357 NTU exceeded the TBS and WHO acceptable levels. DO was exceeding the standards in stations like Vingunguti and Kigogo 1 which had 0. 00 mg/l. DO was within the standards at upstream from the industries station. Chromium concentration was higher at Tabata 2 and Kigogo 2 and it was within the standards at the station upstream from the industries. Furthermore the results show that <b>industrial</b> <b>pollutants</b> was found to be affecting the water resources in terms of quality where the water quality parameters in some stations were exceeding the WHO and TBS permissible limits also livelihoods were found to be affected by the <b>industrial</b> <b>pollutants</b> in terms of health, agriculture and settlement. Moreover, the study found that industries are still discharging pollutants into the sub catchment despite the implementation of the Tanzania National Industrial Policy. The study recommends improvement of law enforcement in order to control <b>industrial</b> <b>pollutants.</b> Further; the authorities like NEMC should ensure that industries adopt efficient technology such as Effluent treatment Plants (ETP’s) in order to minimize the effects of <b>industrial</b> <b>pollutants</b> into water resources and livelihoods. The findings will add to documentation on levels of <b>industrial</b> <b>pollutants</b> and their effects on water resources and on livelihoods along Msimbazi sub catchment which will be essential to community, water managers and other conservationists.
