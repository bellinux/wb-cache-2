Bell said {{at the end of}} his quote: [...] "Fear <b>is</b> bondage. <b>Fear</b> <b>is</b> slavery. <b>Fear</b> <b>is</b> Hell. <b>Fear</b> <b>is</b> control." [...] Lyrically, this song <b>is</b> about <b>fear</b> of a variety of sufferings, including war, hate, enemy, loss, and failure, plus god and savior. The final line is 'Fear is your god'.|$|R

They argue while lateral entry may create synergy between the government and big businesses, but it will also compromise the integrity of the government.|$|E

While a court found in 2005 that he should be free to go to the Gaza Strip and West Bank, a year later further restrictions explicitly forbade him to visit either, reversing the court's initial decision. Vanunu said his knowledge was outdated and that he had nothing more he could reveal that is not already widely known. Despite the stated restrictions he gave interviews to the foreign press since his release, for which he has been arrested.|$|E
25|$|Although {{freedom of}} access was {{enshrined}} in the law, as a security measure, the Israeli government currently enforces a ban on non-Muslim prayer on the site. Non-Muslims who are observed praying on the site are subject to expulsion by the police. At various times, when there <b>is</b> <b>fear</b> of Arab rioting upon the mount resulting in throwing stones from above towards the Western Wall Plaza, Israel has prevented Muslim men under 45 from praying in the compound, citing these concerns. Sometimes such restrictions have coincided with Friday prayers during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. Normally, West Bank Palestinians are allowed access to Jerusalem only during Islamic holidays, with access usually restricted to men over 35 and women of any age eligible for permits to enter the city. Palestinian residents of Jerusalem, which because of Israel's annexation of Jerusalem, hold Israeli permanent residency cards, and Israeli Arabs, are permitted unrestricted access to the Temple Mount. The Mughrabi Gate is the only entrance to the Temple Mount accessible to non-Muslims.|$|E

25|$|Every {{emotional}} response has a behavioral component, an autonomic component, and a hormonal component. The hormonal component includes {{the release of}} epinephrine, an adrenomedullary response that occurs in response to stress and that {{is controlled by the}} sympathetic nervous system. The major emotion studied in relation to epinephrine <b>is</b> <b>fear.</b> In an experiment, subjects who were injected with epinephrine expressed more negative and fewer positive facial expressions to fear films compared to a control group. These subjects also reported a more intense fear from the films and greater mean intensity of negative memories than control subjects. The findings from this study demonstrate that there are learned associations between negative feelings and levels of epinephrine. Overall, the greater amount of epinephrine is positively correlated with an arousal state of negative feelings. These findings can be an effect in part that epinephrine elicits physiological sympathetic responses including an increased heart rate and knee shaking, which {{can be attributed to the}} feeling of fear regardless of the actual level of fear elicited from the video. Although studies have found a definite relation between epinephrine and fear, other emotions have not had such results. In the same study, subjects did not express a greater amusement to an amusement film nor greater anger to an anger film. Similar findings were also supported in a study that involved rodent subjects that either were able or unable to produce epinephrine. Findings support the idea that epinephrine does have a role in facilitating the encoding of emotionally arousing events, contributing to higher levels of arousal due to fear.|$|E

500|$|Fingeroth {{also argues}} that a major theme in the film <b>is</b> <b>fear,</b> which {{supports}} the story of Bruce Wayne becoming a hero. Director Christopher Nolan stated that the idea behind the film was [...] "a person who would confront his innermost fear and then attempt to become it". Fingeroth referred to this film's depiction as [...] "the man with fear—but who rises above it". The theme of fear is further personified by the Scarecrow. The film depicts how fear can affect all creatures regardless of might. Allusions to fear are seen throughout, from Bruce's conquering of his demons, to becoming Batman, to the Scarecrow and his deadly fear toxin. The macabre, distorted images presented in the Scarecrow's toxin-induced hallucinations also express the idea of terror to an extreme.|$|E

She creates a {{hand-drawn}} comic book about Jim who gets attacked by a radioactive bear and takes its powers.

Meanwhile, Jim agrees to a snowball fight with Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson). When he is first challenged outside, however, he finds the doors chained. Dwight then emerges from a snowman, throwing multiple snowballs at Jim and leaving him with a bloody nose. Throughout the day, Dwight torments Jim with increasingly elaborate snowball ambushes. Jim tries to surrender, but Dwight refuses. At the end of the day, Jim is too afraid to go outside. He and Pam find multiple snowmen, and Jim attacks them all hoping to find Dwight. Dwight, however, is {{on the roof of the}} building, watching Jim with a satisfied look on his face. He claims that the most powerful snowball in a snowball fight <b>is</b> <b>fear,</b> and smilingly wishes the camera [...] "Merry Christmas".|$|E
