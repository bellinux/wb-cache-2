5|$|Linguist Jesse Sheidlower {{traces the}} gesture's {{development}} in the United States to the 1890s. According to anthropologist Desmond Morris, the gesture probably came to the United States via Italian immigrants. The first documented appearance of the finger in the United States was in 1886, when Old Hoss Radbourn, a baseball pitcher for the Boston Beaneaters, was photographed giving it {{to a member of}} their rival the New York Giants. In the film Speedy (1928), Harold Lloyd's character gives himself the finger into a <b>distorting</b> <b>mirror</b> at Luna Park, about 24 minutes into the film.|$|E
6000|$|In {{cleaning}} the house she pondered upon the maid's-room. It was a slant-roofed, small-windowed hole above the kitchen, oppressive in summer, frigid in winter. She saw that while she had been considering herself an unusually good mistress, she had been permitting her friends Bea and Oscarina {{to live in a}} sty. She complained to Kennicott. [...] "What's the matter with it?" [...] he growled, as they stood on the perilous stairs dodging up from the kitchen. She commented upon the sloping roof of unplastered boards stained in brown rings by the rain, the uneven floor, the cot and its tumbled discouraged-looking quilts, the broken rocker, the <b>distorting</b> <b>mirror.</b>|$|E
60|$|I {{discovered}} that a concave speculum hung slantingly high over his head; a movement in this caught my attention sharply, and I looked up to see, distorted and made fantastic but bright and beautifully colored, the magnified, reflected, evasive rendering of a palace, of a terrace, of the vista of a great roadway with many people, people exaggerated, impossible-looking because of the curvature of the mirror, going to and fro. I turned my head quickly that I might see more clearly through the window behind me, {{but it was too}} high for me to survey this nearer scene directly, and after a momentary pause I came back to that <b>distorting</b> <b>mirror</b> again.|$|E

This is he whom English boys are to be ignorant of, if Greek be ousted from our schools, or are to know only in the <b>distorting</b> <b>mirror</b> of a versified, or in the pale shadow of a prose translation. Translations are good only as teachers to bring men to Homer. English verse has no measure which even remotely suggests the various flow of the hexameter. Translators who employ verse give us a feeble Homer, dashed with their own conceits, and moulded to their own style. Translators who employ prose [...] "tell the story without the song," [...] but, at least, they add no twopenny [...] "beauties" [...] and cheap conceits of their own.|$|E
60|$|Theatrical art {{begins as}} the holding up to Nature of a <b>distorting</b> <b>mirror.</b> In this phase it pleases {{people who are}} childish enough {{to believe that they}} can see what they look like and what they are when they look at a true mirror. Naturally they think that a true mirror can teach them nothing. Only by giving them back some monstrous image can the mirror amuse them or terrify them. It is not until they grow up to the point at which they learn that they know very little about {{themselves}}, and that they do not see themselves in a true mirror as other people see them, that they become consumed with curiosity as to what they really are like, and begin to demand that the stage shall be a mirror of such accuracy and intensity of illumination that they shall be able to get glimpses of their real selves in it, and also learn a little how they appear to other people.|$|E

6000|$|The Webbites do {{not deny}} the broad facts of the case. Our present electoral system, with our big modern {{constituencies}} of thousands of voters, leads to huge turnovers of political power with a relatively small shifting of public opinion. It makes a mock of public opinion by caricature, and Parliament becomes the <b>distorting</b> <b>mirror</b> of the nation. Under some loud false issue a few score of thousands of votes turn over, and in goes this party or that with a big sham majority. This the Webbites admit. But they applaud it. It gives us, they say, [...] "a strong Government." [...] Public opinion, the intelligent man outside the House, is ruled out of the game. He has no power of intervention at all. The artful little Fabian politicians rub their hands and say, [...] "Now {{we can get to}} work with the wires! No one can stop us." [...] And when the public complains of the results, there is always the repartee, [...] "You elected them." [...] But the Fabian psychology is the psychology of a very small group of pedants who believe that fair ends may be reached by foul means. It is much easier and more natural to serve foul ends by foul means. In practice it is not tricky benevolence but tricky bargaining among the interests that will secure control of the political wires. That is a bad enough state of affairs in ordinary times, but in times of tragic necessity like the present men will not be mocked in this way. Life {{is going to be very}} intense in the years ahead of us. If we go right on to another caricature Parliament, with perhaps half a hundred leading men in it and the rest hacks and nobodies, the baffled and discontented outsiders in the streets may presently be driven to rioting and the throwing of bombs. Unless, indeed, the insurrection of the outsiders takes a still graver form, and the Press, which has ceased entirely to be a Party Press in Great Britain, helps some adventurous Prime Minister to flout and set aside the lower House altogether. There is neither much moral nor much physical force behind the House of Commons at the present time.|$|E

Instead of a normal plane mirror that reflects a perfect mirror image, distorting mirrors are curved mirrors, often using convex and concave sections to achieve the distorted effect. Because of their distorting properties, they are sometimes featured in fiction as a literary device, such as in Hans Christian Andersen's The Snow Queen.|$|E

Some of the interviewees were criticised as viewing their part [...] "through the <b>distorting</b> <b>mirror</b> of bitterness or loyalty", whilst [...] "others bore grudges, others were staking their positions for posterity". The series was noted for the wry contributions of former secretary to the government Dermot Nally, the contrasting observations of Haughey's son Seán with those of his daughter Eimear, {{and the performance of}} Pádraig Flynn before the camera, which was described as [...] "utterly extraordinary". Questions were, however, raised if a better programme could have been made after Haughey's death when people would feel freer to speak.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedAdaptive optics offer {{the potential to}} reduce the high cost and long lead time associated with manufacturing mirrors for spaced-based telescopes by allowing lighter materials to be substituted. These lighter materials lack the optical performance of traditional space-based mirrors. Deformable mirrors {{could be used to}} correct for surface aberrations in order to improve the optical quality by altering their surface to adjust the wavefront. Research focused on placing a deformable mirror at the exit pupil of a simulated telescope. Experimental work first studied a severely degraded one-meter carbon fiber reinforced polymer mirror to establish a baseline. Simulations were conducted to see how a notional deformable mirror would be able to negate the optical effects due to a <b>distorted</b> <b>mirror</b> in combination with field angle effects. Results from the investigation showed that a deformable mirror yielded the greatest benefit when applied to a <b>distorted</b> <b>mirror</b> surface. Increasing the actuator count on the deformable mirror boosted the root mean square performance across all field angles. Increasing the actuator stroke yielded minimal benefits after a certain reduction in wavefront had already been achieved. Further research is recommended to focus on using a continuous deformable mirror to account for field angle effects. Lieutenant, United States Nav...|$|R
5000|$|The Handmaid's Tale {{was well}} {{received}} by critics, helping to cement Atwood's {{status as a}} prominent writer of the 20th century. Not only was the book deemed well-written and compelling, but Atwood's work was notable for sparking intense debates {{both in and out}} of academia. Atwood maintains that the Republic of Gilead is only an extrapolation of trends already seen in the United States at the time of her writing, a view supported by other scholars studying The Handmaid's Tale. Indeed, many have placed The Handmaid's Tale in the same category of dystopian fiction as Nineteen Eighty-Four and Brave New World, with the added feature of confronting patriarchy, a categorization that Atwood has accepted and reiterated in many articles and interviews. Even today, many reviewers hold that Atwood's novel remains as foreboding and powerful as ever, largely because of its basis in historical fact. Yet when her book was first published in 1985, not all reviewers were convinced of the [...] "cautionary tale" [...] Atwood presented. For example, Mary McCarthy's New York Times review argued that The Handmaid's Tale lacked the [...] "surprised recognition" [...] necessary for readers to see [...] "our present selves in a <b>distorting</b> <b>mirror,</b> of what we may be turning into if current trends are allowed to continue".|$|E
50|$|While {{holding the}} opinion that Germany, as {{presented}} in Seventeen Moments of Spring, resembled the Soviet Union more than its real countepart, Russian historian Konstantin Zalesski also noted numerous inaccuracies, errors and inconsistencies in the series. In his 2006 book, Seventeen Moments of Spring: A <b>Distorting</b> <b>Mirror</b> of the Third Reich, Zalesski pointed out many such. For example, while Pastor Schlag is supposedly a Catholic priest, he possesses all {{the characteristics of a}} Lutheran one, including the title 'pastor'; Müller is decorated with the Honour Chevron for the Old Guard, although he only joined the NSDAP in 1939; Stierlitz and Schlag listens to Édith Piaf's Milord, released in 1959; all members of the SS are seen to wear black uniform - which were replaced by gray ones already in 1938 - and frequently smoke, in spite of the campaign to ban this habit; Gestapo uses pocket recorders of 1960s. In addition, Joseph Goebbels, Hermann Göring and Heinrich Himmler all had university, rather than merely secondary education, as claimed in the series: Goebbels also became the Gauleiter of Berlin already in 1926, and not in 1944. At one point, footage of Julius Streicher is presented as if he were Robert Ley. Another incorrect detail was Friedrich Krüger's portrayal as the SS and Police Leader in Poland in early 1945, while he was relieved from this position in November 1943.|$|E
