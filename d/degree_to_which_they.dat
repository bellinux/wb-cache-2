However, {{the degree to which the}} Jesuits controlled the indigenous population for which they had responsibility and the <b>degree</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> allowed indigenous culture to function is a matter of debate, and the social organization of the reductions have been variously described as jungle utopias on the one hand, to theocratic regimes of terror, the former description being much closer to the mark.|$|E

Verifying absolute satisfaction (true or false) of these requirements is challenging. Instead, we analyse requirements that admit flexible degrees of satisfaction. We analyse vague requirements using fuzzy logic, and probabilistic requirements using model checking. The resulting analysis method provides a partial ordering of system designs, identifying trade-offs between different requirements {{in terms of}} the <b>degrees</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> are satisfied.

Although several manufacturing industries, such as cotton textiles, depart from the pattern, most appear to have devoted the hulk of their investments to working capitaL This variation across industries in the composition of capital investmentsis indicative of a more general variation in factor intensities, and bears on the issues of why industries became concentrated in the regions they did, and the <b>degrees</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> were adversely affected by the limited availability of long-term loans. Evidence that most manufacturing industries had quite modest investments in machinery and tools per unit of labor is also presented, serving to undercut the notion that the early period of industrialization was based on a proliferation of new, machinery-intensive technologies...|$|R
40|$|Are {{there any}} {{coherent}} and defensible alternatives to liberal democracy? The author examines {{the possibility that}} a reformed democratic centralism—the principle around which China’s cur-rent polity is officially organized—might be legitimate, according to both an inside and an out-side perspective. The inside perspective builds on contemporary Chinese political theory; the outside perspective critically deploys Rawls’s notion of a “decent society ” as its standard. Along the way, the author pays particular attention to the kinds and degree of pluralism a decent society can countenance, and to the specific institutions in China that might enable the realization of a genuine and/or decent democratic centralism. The author argues that by considering both inside and outside perspectives, and the <b>degrees</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> inter-penetrate and critically inform one another, we can engage in a global philosophy that neither pre-judges alternative political traditions nor falls prey to false conceptual barriers...|$|R

25|$|As blood perfuses the system, it exerts shear and {{pressure}} {{forces on the}} vessel walls. At the same time, tissue growth outside the cardiovascular system pushes back {{on the outside of}} the vessel walls. These forces must be balanced to obtain an efficient energy state for low-cost delivery of nutrients and oxygen to all tissues of the embryo body. When growth of the yolk sac (external tissue) is constrained, the balance between vascular forces and tissue forces is shifted and some vascular branches may be disconnected or diminished during the remodelling process because they are unable to forge new paths through the compressed tissue. In general, the stiffness and resistance of these tissues dictates the <b>degree</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> can be deformed and the way in which biomechanical forces can affect them.|$|E
40|$|Voters {{and party}} activists {{are drawn to}} a {{particular}} political party, at least in part, because of its ideological/issue profile. 2 Hence, changing that profile could result in losing current members and/or voters.

And yet, {{there is ample evidence}} that parties do change their profiles, both in their positions and in the relative <b>degrees</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> emphasize particular issues, and sometimes the changes are dramatic. Why, in the face of good reasons for standing pat, do parties change? In addition to possible internal factors, such as changes in who controls the party’s own positions of power, recent literature has focused a good deal of attention on pressures and opportunities from outside the party (i. e., “environmental ” factors).

5000|$|Though all {{of these}} local flavors of {{regional}} Thai Buddhism evolved their own customary elements relating to local spirit lore, all were shaped by the infusion of Mahayana Buddhism and Indian Tantric traditions, which arrived in the area prior to the fourteenth century.

Thanissaro writes that these monks would lead sedentary lives in village monasteries; take occupations as doctors and fortune tellers; and occasionally take leave on [...] "a pilgrimage <b>they</b> called 'dhutanga' <b>which</b> bore {{little resemblance to the}} classic dhutanga practices."

40|$|Coral reef {{calcification}} {{is predicted}} to decline {{as a result of}} ocean acidification and other anthropogenic stressors. The majority of studies predicting declines based on in situ relationships between environmental parameters and net community calcification rate have been location-specific, preventing accurate predictions for coral reefs globally. In this study, net community calcification and production were measured on a coral reef flat at One Tree Island, Great Barrier Reef, using Lagrangian flow respirometry and slack water methods. Net community calcification, daytime net photosynthesis and nighttime respiration were higher under the flow respirometry method, likely due to increased water flow relative to the slack water method. The two methods also varied in the <b>degrees</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> were influenced by potential measurement uncertainties. The difference in the results from these two commonly used methods implies that some of the location-specific differences in coral reef community metabolism may be due to differences in measurement methods...|$|R
25|$|Because {{of their}} legal status as {{citizens}} and the <b>degree</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> could become emancipated, women in ancient Rome could own property, enter contracts, and engage in business. Some acquired and disposed of sizable fortunes, and are recorded in inscriptions as benefactors in funding major public works. Roman women could appear in court and argue cases, though it was customary {{for them to be}} represented by a man. They were simultaneously disparaged as too ignorant and weak-minded to practice law, and as too active and influential in legal matters—resulting in an edict that limited women to conducting cases on their own behalf instead of others'. But even after this restriction was put in place, there are numerous examples of women taking informed actions in legal matters, including dictating legal strategy to their male advocates.|$|E
25|$|As {{effective}} caregiving {{involves a}} great amount of responsibility, as well as the expenditure of cognitive, emotional, and/or tangible resources, caregivers must be sufficiently motivated in order to provide responsive support to their relationship partner. That is, people who do not possess enough motivation to help will be less effective at providing care that is appropriate for their partner's needs. Furthermore, individuals may differ in the <b>degree</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> hold altruistic versus egoistic motivations for helping. Altruistic motivations are centred on the desire to advance the significant other's welfare, whereas egoistic motivations are centred on the desire to gain benefits for oneself, or to avoid sanctions for not helping and/or other negative consequences to the self. More altruistic and less egoistic motivations for caregiving are linked to better outcomes for the care recipient and enhanced relationship quality.|$|E
25|$|Mining {{operations}} use crushers, commonly {{classified by}} the <b>degree</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> fragment the starting material, with {{primary and secondary}} crushers handling coarse materials, and tertiary and quaternary crushers reducing ore particles to finer gradations. Each crusher is designed {{to work with a}} certain maximum size of raw material, and often delivers its output to a screening machine which sorts and directs the product for further processing. Typically, crushing stages are followed by milling stages if the materials need to be further reduced. Additionally rockbreakers are typically located next to a crusher to reduce oversize material too large for a crusher. Crushers are used to reduce particle size enough so that the material can be processed into finer particles in a grinder. A typical processing line at a mine might consist of a crusher followed by a SAG mill followed by a ball mill. In this context, the SAG mill and ball mill are considered grinders rather than crushers.|$|E
40|$|This paper explores how {{three major}} European nation-states, France, Germany, and the UK, are {{negotiating}} financial {{reform in the}} wake of the most recent financial crisis. France, Germany, and the UK were affected differently by the 2009 financial crisis, in some ways vary- ing the <b>degrees</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> are willing <b>to</b> negotiate further financial regulation. Also because of these differences financial reform resonates differently with each states’ polities. Drawing on statements by finance ministers and heads of state, as well as IMF data measuring the effects of the latest crisis on each national economy, this paper seeks to identify opportunities for consen- sus amongst the three major actors. The characteristics and outcome of negotiations by these states have the potential to greatly influence the future of financial regulation not only within the EU, but also abroad. On the other hand, promising opportunities for consensus lie in potentially negotiating within the European Union and establishing methods to reduce the costs of market failure in the financial sector...|$|R
40|$|This report reviews 24 out of 202 Bank {{projects}} that involved nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) {{in order to}} identify ways to improve Bank-NGO collaboration. It identifies five functional categories of NGO interaction with the Bank along a public-private continuum, based on the varying <b>degrees</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> represent social goals on the public end of the continuum and economic goals on the private end. Discussion focuses on the benefits and difficulties arising from the involvement of NGOs in each category in Bank-supported projects. It recommends involving NGOs before implementation, developing creative financing mechanisms to support them, and learning what they have to teach Bank staff about motivation, education and organization. The challenge for the Bank is to forge institutional links between governments and NGOs that extend and complement government capabilities. Governments and NGOs must learn to respect each other so they can work toward such mutual goals as poverty alleviation.

40|$|The {{current study}} {{examines}} young Japanese women’s attitudes toward work and marriage, and the <b>degrees</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> see their career goals as complementing or conflicting with {{other aspects of}} their lives. The data were collected using a questionnaire-based survey: providing unique information on awareness of gender differences in workplaces among undergraduate women (N = 577) at a large national university in Japan. The results are complex: indicating {{an increase in the}} numbers of career- minded women, but also that many women still approach their careers in a very conservative way. This implies that Japan remains far behind many other developed countries in terms of how women are encouraged to approach their careers, and in how companies make use of female human capital as well. The results indicate a need to educate both male and female students on these issues in order to support female students in their decisions on how to participate in the labor force. Implications of the results and directions for future research are also discussed...|$|R
25|$|Reductions {{were laid}} out {{according}} to a standardised plan: the main buildings, like the church, college and churchyard were concentrated around a wide square, with houses facing the other three sides. Each village also provided a house for widows, a hospital, and several warehouses. In {{the centre of the}} square there was a cross and a statue of the mission's patron saint. The reductions were ruled by indigenous chiefs who served as the reductions' governors, but were controlled by the Jesuits. There was a minimum of two Jesuits in a reduction, with more for larger ones. The social organization of the reductions has often been described as extremely efficient; most were self-supporting and even produced surpluses of goods, which they traded to outside communities, which laid the foundation of the belief that Jesuits were guarding immense riches acquired through Indian labour. The main traded produce was the hides of their cattle and yerba mate, leaves drunk somewhat like tea. Initially these were collected from the wild, but later cultivated. A number of trades and skills were taught to some Indians, including even printing to produce mostly religious texts in indigenous languages, some illustrated by engravings by indigenous artists. In reality the communities were economically successful but hardly constituted any important source of income for the Jesuit order. The degree to which the Jesuits controlled the indigenous population for which they had responsibility and the <b>degree</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> allowed indigenous culture to function is a matter of debate.|$|E

In an essay on the opera orchestras of Montverdi's day, Janet Beat regrets that the 30-year gap between L'Orfeo and the next Monteverdi opera to have survived, Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria, hampers the study of how opera orchestration developed during those critical years.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the orienteering problem (OP) which is a {{combination}} of two well-known problems (i. e., travelling salesman problem and the knapsack problem). OP is an NP-hard problem and is useful in appropriately modeling several challenging applications. As the parameters involved in these applications cannot be measured precisely, depicting them using crisp numbers is unrealistic. Further, the decision maker may be satisfied with graded satisfaction levels of solutions, which cannot be formulated using a crisp program. To deal with the above-stated two issues, we formulate the fuzzy orienteering problem (FOP) and provide a method to solve it. Here we state the two necessary conditions of OP of maximizing the total collected score and minimizing the time taken to traverse a path (within the specified time bound) as fuzzy goals and the remaining necessary conditions as crisp constraints. Using the max-min formulation of the fuzzy sets obtained from the fuzzy goals, we calculate the fuzzy decision sets (Z and Z∗) that contain the feasible paths and the desirable paths, respectively, along with the <b>degrees</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> are acceptable. <b>To</b> efficiently solve large instances of FOP, we also present a parallel algorithm on CREW PRAM model...|$|R
40|$|We {{live in an}} era {{of rapid}} change in {{ecosystems}} and their environ- ments, that all scales up to the global. The contemporary view is that the interactions between life and the environment are bidirectional: the environment creates life and life creates the environment. However, most ecosystem models have an inbuilt rigidity such that the <b>degrees</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> can mimic structural change in response to environmental cues is very limited. In an effort to capture the plasticity of life we present a new theoretical individual-based ecosystem model in the con- text of previous classical and experimental modelling approaches. The aim is to develop {{a deeper understanding of the}} factors determining trophic structure. The individual-based approach permits the inclusion of traits to model heritable attributes. Population-level models imple- ment a mean-�eld approximation that led to the competitive exclustion principle. The addition of a trait to de�ne speci�c feeding strategy permits the model exploration of this problem. Life history theory pre- dicts that reduced juvenile mortality selects for delayed maturity and decreased reproductive effort, and reduced adult mortality will select for the opposite. Through the inclusion of a different trait to represent relative parental investment in offspring, we explore the predictions of life history theory and hypotheses for clutch size...|$|R
