40|$|Abstract—Nature {{and amount}} of taxes and other charges, the {{structure}} of the tax system may significantly affect the competitiveness of national economies. Countries with higher tax rates may get into in a less favourable competitive situation compared to countries with lower tax rates. However, the maintaining the budgetary discipline and avoiding an <b>excessive</b> <b>government</b> <b>deficit</b> may restrictively affect the endeavour to decrease tax burden. The nature and extent of taxes on labour income and para-fiscal contributions have changed in Hungary over the examined period (between 2002 and 2011). The progressive taxation on labour income was replaced by the flat income tax rate (16 %) in 2011. The study examines the impact of changed personal income tax system on the tax burden of labour income. Keywords—educational level, flat tax rate, implicit tax rate, tax burden. T I...|$|E
25|$|To {{prevent the}} joining states {{from getting into}} {{financial}} trouble or crisis after entering the monetary union, they were obliged in the Maastricht treaty to fulfil important financial obligations and procedures, especially to show budgetary discipline and {{a high degree of}} sustainable economic convergence, as well as to avoid <b>excessive</b> <b>government</b> <b>deficits</b> and limit the government debt to a sustainable level.|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the question of why}} interest rates are so high in Brazil as compared to the international average. It looks at theoretical arguments based on <b>excessive</b> <b>government</b> <b>deficits,</b> structural lack of private savings, inflation bias, excessive investment demand and fear of floating. An informal look at the evidence does not strongly corroborate any of these arguments. Hence a wise central bank should consider "testing" the market to make sure it is not dealing with an extreme equilibrium configuration or a long standing disequilibrium...|$|R
50|$|Since {{membership}} of the eurozone establishes a single monetary policy for the respective states, {{they can no longer}} use an isolated monetary policy, e.g. to increase their competitiveness at the cost of other eurozone members by printing money and devalue, or to print money to finance <b>excessive</b> <b>government</b> <b>deficits</b> or pay interest on unsustainable high government debt levels. As a consequence, if member states do not manage their economy {{in a way that they}} can show a fiscal discipline (as they were obliged by the Maastricht treaty), they will sooner or later risk a sovereign debt crisis in their country without the possibility to print money as an easy way out. This is what happened to Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Cyprus, and Spain.|$|R
40|$|Because {{of recent}} {{economic}} crises, financial fragility has regained prominence {{in both the}} {{theory and practice of}} macroeconomic policy. Consistent with macroeconomic paradigms prevalent at the time, the original architecture of the euro zone assumed that safeguards against inflation and <b>excessive</b> <b>government</b> <b>deficits</b> would suffice to guarantee macroeconomic stability. Recent events, in both Europe and the industrial world at large, challenge this assumption. After reviewing the roots of the euro crisis in financial‐market developments, this essay draws some conclusions for the reform of euro area institutions. The euro area is moving quickly to correct one flaw in the Maastricht treaty, the vesting of all financial supervisory functions with national authorities. However, the sheer size of bank balance sheets suggest that the euro area must also confront a financial/fiscal trilemma: countries in the euro zone can no longer enjoy all three of financial integration with other member states, financial stability, and fiscal independence, because the costs of banking rescues may now go beyond national fiscal capacities. Thus, plans to reform the euro zone architecture must combine centralized supervision with some centralized fiscal backstop to finance bank resolution in situations of insolvency...|$|R
40|$|This paper first {{describes}} the ingredients the present {{crisis in the}} euro zone and then evaluates the key options that policy makers face in resolving the crisis and avoiding similar crises in the future. I argue that the crisis should {{not be seen as}} caused by government profligacy alone. In many troubled countries, an unsustainable build-up of private sector debt was involved as well. I argue that a more fundamental problem is that the euro zone lacks an adjustment mechanism for balance of payments crises that may arise in its member countries, with or without <b>excessive</b> <b>government</b> <b>deficits.</b> The metaphor of taps to be opened or closed by policy is used to discuss the core trade offs that policy makers face. I discuss monetary taps, bailout taps, austerity taps and devaluation taps. I propose a simple model of government bond markets with sovereign insolvency to be used in order to evaluate EU-type bailouts. I discuss {{the pros and cons of}} austerity as a precondition for such bailouts, and I criticize the use of Target 2 as a mechanism to absorb balance of national payments crises...|$|R
2500|$|Note about UK: Paragraph 4 of , exempts UK {{from the}} {{obligation}} in [...] of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to avoid <b>excessive</b> general <b>government</b> <b>deficits,</b> {{for as long}} as the state opts not to adopt the euro. Paragraph 5 of the same protocol however still provides that the [...] "UK shall endeavour to avoid an <b>excessive</b> <b>government</b> deficit". On one hand, this means that the Commission and Council still approach the UK with EDP recommendations whenever excessive deficits are found, but on the other hand, they legally can not launch any sanctions against the UK if they do not comply with the recommendations. Due to its special exemption, the UK also did not incorporate the additional MTO adjustment rules introduced by the 2005 SGP reform and six-pack reform. Instead, the UK defined their own budget concept comprising a [...] "Golden rule" [...] and [...] "Sustainable investment rule", effectively running throughout 1998-2008, which was UK's national interpretation how the SGP-regulation text should be understood.|$|R
40|$|A zero net {{domestic}} financing (NDF) target has served Tanzania well in recent years, contributing to prudent expenditure policy, improved fiscal sustainability, and macroeconomic stability. Moving {{to a more}} flexible fiscal policy, however, may serve Tanzania better. The "diamond rule" proposed in this paper incorporates a permanent hard ceiling on debt and annual benchmark limits on NDF, expenditure growth, and nonconcessional external financing. This rule would provide flexibility for countercyclical policy and help define the fiscal space for infrastructure spending {{that is consistent with}} longrun fiscal sustainability. An illustrative simulation shows that Tanzania has considerable fiscal space for development spending.

Using data of nonfinancial firms in Taiwan from 1981 to 2009, this study finds that corporate liquidity is lower when <b>government</b> <b>deficit</b> is higher. In addition, corporate liquidity is related with other macroeconomic conditions, such as inflation, short-term interest rate, and economic growth. More precisely, results indicate that inflation and interest rates {{have a negative impact}} on corporate liquidity that is aggravated when <b>government</b> <b>deficit</b> is higher.

50|$|When {{the economy}} is {{operating}} near capacity, government borrowing to finance {{an increase in the}} deficit causes interest rates to rise and higher interest rates reduce or 'crowd out' private investment, reducing growth. This theory explains why large and sustained <b>government</b> <b>deficits</b> take a toll on growth: they reduce capital formation. But this argument rests on how <b>government</b> <b>deficits</b> affect interest rates, and the relationship between <b>government</b> <b>deficits</b> and interest rates varies.|$|R

Further, evidence shows that <b>government</b> <b>deficit</b> leads to incremental reserve money creation even though the Reserve Bank financing of <b>Government</b> <b>deficit</b> almost ceased to exist during most part of the current decade. It argues that <b>Government</b> <b>deficit</b> by influencing the level of sterilisation impacts the accretion of net foreign assets to RBI balance sheet and, therefore, continues to be a key factor causing incremental reserve money creation and overall expansion in money supply. Given the finding that money leads to inflation, <b>government</b> <b>deficit,</b> therefore, remains relevant for stabilisation. ...|$|R

40|$|This 2005 Article IV Consultation {{highlights}} {{that economic}} activity in Austria gathered speed in 2004, supported mostly by strong export performance. Growth of real GDP rose to 2. 2 percent in 2004. Consumption growth was modest, {{in view of}} small gains in employment and nominal wage growth barely matching inflation. Investment demand continued to expand, benefiting from the improved prospects for exports and the extension of tax incentives through end- 2004. Progress in the structural area has been impressive, and this has contributed to Austria’s relatively favorable growth performance in the past period.
