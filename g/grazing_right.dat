40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{institutional}} {{analysis of the}} grazing lands in Matsheng area, Kgalagadi District in Botswana and {{the purpose is to}} use the Institutional Analysis Development framework (IAD) in order to examine how the institutional arrangements affect the probability for cattle owners to successfully govern the grazing land. Grazing land is what Elinor Ostrom defines as a common pool resource and has been governed as a common property in Botswana. According to Garrett Hardin’s “The tragedy of the commons” this kind of resource and resource management are doomed to fail with the outcome of land degradation. Instead Hardin suggests that common property could be changed into either private or state owned property. This argument led to the implementation of the Tribal Grazing Land Policy in 1975. All land was zoned into three different areas: reserved land, commercial land, and communal land. Dividing the areas was assumed to relieve the grazing pressure in the communal lands. The government stressed that the traditional system of land tenure was structured {{in such a way that}} individuals lacked the incentives to conserve the common grazing land. The policy’s objectives were to stop degradation, promote economic equality and increase commercialization in the livestock industry. However, none of the policies objectives has been realized. Ostrom has a more optimistic view to common property and common pool resources and she believes that it is possible to overcome the “tragedy of the commons”. Ostrom had developed three sets of contextual variables that determine whether a resource will be used in a sustainable way or not. These three sets of variables: institutional arrangements, the physical attributes of the resource, and the attributes of the community are brought under the name “Institutional Analysis and Development Framework”, IAD. I have analyzed several factors by doing interviews with cattle owners in Hukuntsi and Lehututu and by using secondary data. I have found that the present resource management in Matsheng is not sustainable! The skewed income variance, the lack of indicators, and the ongoing degradation of water and land, are few factors that hinder cattle owners from investing in resource management. Also, the dual <b>grazing</b> <b>right</b> make few wealthy cattle owners benefit disproportionately which is maybe the greatest obstacle for a sustainable grazing management. Therefore, the government of Botswana needs to cancel the dual <b>grazing</b> <b>right</b> and help cattle owners to take good decisions by providing them information about the water and grazing condition.

40|$|The {{reindeer}} {{are kept}} in extensive pasture systems where the conditions {{are similar to those}} for wild reindeer. Since the reindeer have special demands on their pasture, it is difficult to keep them in intensive production systems where they cannot graze selectively. Too many reindeer on a small area will also facilitate spread of diseases. A selection program for reindeer needs special qualifications according to several different reasons. The purpose with this literature review is to summarize the factors needed for a reindeer selection program and the problems and possibilities included. Reindeer <b>grazing</b> <b>right</b> has a special meaning to the Sami and are reserved for them according to immemorial rights. Reindeer husbandry cannot be directly compared to the intensive systems of other meat producing animals and there are some additional factors to keep in mind when making a selection program for reindeer. The most important factors are the use of pasture (number of reindeer per area), herd structure (regulated by slaughter) and the genetic progress of each individual, which can be increased by selection. The genetic progress can not be maximized in a reindeer population in practice; predators, food resources and changes in climate and environment from one year to another will slow down the progress. It is important to let the reindeer husbandry remain a Sami right to keep their culture and language. At the same time modern tools to improve production and genetic progress in the herds should be used to keep the possibility to make a living on reindeer husbandry...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} 30 years, the {{southern}} part of the Sudano‐Sahelian Africa, hosted a large population of farmers and Fulani herders in search of arable land and pastures. They have developed agricultural practices that maintain soil fertility through long fallow periods, and pastoral practices that allow the best exploitation of the feed distributed along the space during the time. But today, the high human pressure on resources and the global climatic change disturb this balance. The natural grazing land is cultivated by farmers in order to extend crop production; while the historical free <b>grazing</b> <b>right</b> of farmer’s crop residues by herds is now challenged. Competition, tensions and conflicts have become common for the utilization of crop residues in their natural state (cattle feeding or cropping systems based on mulch), or when they are recycled in manure. The challenge is to insure simultaneously the forage supply for herds, and the preservation of soil fertility. Participatory analysis of practices (approach of local knowledge and follow‐up of cropping and livestock systems), experiments and discussions with stakeholders have been carried out in the northern Cameroon (NC), south of Mali (SM) and west of Burkina Faso (WBF). The indicators of practices helped to design two innovative models of management of plant biomass. The first model explains the present and innovative process of production and of utilization of biomass according to the diversity of family farms.

30|$|Perhaps {{the oldest}} {{way to resolve}} the tension between {{conservation}} targets and human interests is the so called ‘Yellowstone model’ or ‘fences and fines’ approach. It encompasses conservation measures by prohibitions, top-down policy control and fines, and even the very separation of human culture and society from conservation areas by fencing (Spence 1999; cf. Rytteri and Puhakka 2009). In Finnish reindeer discourses, not only the enclosure of reindeer outside certain areas, such as private forests, fields and conservation areas but also {{the ending of the}} free <b>grazing</b> <b>right</b> and the transformation of reindeer herding to farming {{have a long history of}} being discussed. Recently, the cessation of free grazing rights has been justified by references to, for example, the avoidance of traffic accidents, overgrazing problems and for nurturing larger, great beast populations (cf. Heikkinen 2002; Jokinen 2005; Rantamäki-Lahtinen 2008). Here reindeer herders are seen more strongly as users of ecosystem services, and an idea in conservation is that reindeer herders should not be allowed to deteriorate the forest floor and regional biodiversity. In addition, suggestions have been made for reintroducing wild forest reindeer to the area. There are reflections of this kind of trend in PAN Parks' recommendations to decrease the density of reindeer close to the hypothetical density of wild forest reindeer (Zinke et al. 2002, Stritih et al. 2007, PAN Parks 2010; Heikkinen et al. 2010; Sarkki et al.In press). An increase in predator numbers also results in difficulties for continuing free grazing reindeer herding. The number of wolves in Finland has also been debated between EU and Finland, as EU claimed in 2005 that Finland was violating the conservation targets of EU's habitat directive. After intense debate, the appeal was closed in 2008 when the European Commission finally stated that Finland has not threatened the sustainable level of its wolf population (Heikkinen et al. 2011; Hiedanpää and Bromley 2011). However, this debate stresses that international conservation pressures exist for increased predator conservation.|$|E

In summer, the village’s herdsmen had to keep their stock on the mountain. In 1575, when the young lord Pfilipp zu Winneburg built a sheep farm at Winneburg (castle) and his shepherds often led their flocks across Faid’s limits, the Faiders took his wethers, rams and goats away and sold them, as the bailiff of Cochem had advised them to do. This they kept doing until the grazing incursions stopped.|$|R

50|$|Faid was {{somewhat}} less successful in keeping its <b>grazing</b> <b>rights</b> in Cochem’s wild lands. About 1840, Cochem claimed that Faid {{had no such}} rights, and forbade the villagers to graze their livestock there. Nevertheless, they once again ignored an official pronouncement, and the village shepherd continued to graze his sheep in the wild lands, for which offence he was booked and subsequently penalized by the court. The village then decided to send a delegation to Trier to seek the old documents granting them <b>grazing</b> <b>rights</b> in the wild lands in the old Electoral archive. The delegates were turned away and told that the more recent Prussian administration had had all such documents transferred to Koblenz. No such thing was to be found there, however, and Faid thereby lost its <b>grazing</b> <b>rights</b> in Cochem’s wild lands. As it later turned out, no delegation had ever needed to go anywhere. In 1887 - somewhat {{too late for the}} delegation’s purposes - the document that had been sought was found - in Faid’s own municipal chest.|$|R
