25|$|It was thrilling {{to work on}} {{this film}} and when you see my {{extraordinary}} interpretation you realise why I immediately fell into the arms of Jenny Craig, and minor cosmetic surgery. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> motion capture was something you did when you were taking a specimen at the doctor.|$|E
25|$|I {{regret to}} say {{that none of us}} {{approved}} of the marriage at that time. Mother thought Jack was too young, and Lottie and I felt that Olive, being in musical comedy, belonged to an alien world. Ollie had all the rich, eligible men of the social world at her feet. She had been deluged with proposals from her own world of the theater as well. Which was not at all surprising. The beauty of Olive Thomas is legendary. The girl had the loveliest violet-blue eyes I have ever seen. They were fringed with long dark lashes that seemed darker because of the delicate translucent pallor of her skin. I could understand why Florenz Ziegfeld never forgave Jack for taking her away from the Follies. She and Jack were madly in love with one another but <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> of them as a couple of children playing together.|$|E

Dan and Maddy have always been {{incredibly}} close without becoming lovers, but it is obvious that they are great together, so when it happens it is effortless and joyous and has wonderful potential. But Dan's private demons prevent it from being allowed to live and grow. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> it might be great for him, if only he could have let it be." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the music}} community, {{there have been}} {{disagreements}} whether the band {{should be considered as}} [...] "heavy metal". In 2015, lead singer Jonathan Davis commented, [...] "Yeah, we're heavy and downtuned, but metal, to me, is like Judas Priest and Iron Maiden, that's metal man. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> of us as a funk band." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Food Wife" [...] {{was written}} by {{executive}} producer of The Simpsons Matt Selman. The writing process began around September 2010. According to Selman, the episode mainly revolves around Homer and Marge competing about who is perceived as the most fun by Bart and Lisa, a situation that he thinks parents can identify with in real-life. The episode also focuses heavily on foodies and food blogs. Selman {{said in an interview}} with New York magazine's Grub Street publication that the foodie culture is [...] "just a world that <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> was funny and fascinating. The idea of food as not only something you enjoy eating, but as something that you are so passionate about that you're kind of bragging about it. 'I'm the one who discovered this particular Korean pork-neck soup restaurant,' and you can kind of claim that as yours. The blogging just feeds into that kind of territorial element that <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> was inherently funny. And when I write Simpsons episodes, I try to start with a world I think is funny, and think, 'What's a good story we can tell in that world, using the characters that we have?'" ...|$|E

[...] But <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> Vernie was very close." [...] Vernon said that playing against the likes of Fuhr and Roy led him to improve at his position. [...] He was a stand-up goaltender early in his career, but learned to adopt aspects of the butterfly style after watching them play. [...] Standing only [...] tall, he relied on speed and reflexes to be a successful goaltender in the NHL.|$|E

500|$|After {{returning}} to San Clemente, California, in 1974 and settling into the Nixons' home, La Casa Pacifica, Pat Nixon rarely appeared {{in public and}} only granted occasional interviews to the press. In late May 1975, Pat went to her girlhood town of Artesia to dedicate the Patricia Nixon Elementary School. In her remarks, she said, [...] "I'm proud to have the school carry my name. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> that only those who have gone had schools named after them. I am happy {{to tell you that}} I'm not gone—I mean, not really gone." [...] It was Pat's only solo public appearance in {{five and a half years}} in California.|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} {{decided to}} have the film open with the statement [...] "Hell is a teenage girl" [...] to reflect the [...] "horrors" [...] of puberty and that [...] "the hellish emotions felt during high school often reappear as teenage girls mature into young women". Cody stated: There's the scene where Jennifer's sitting alone smearing makeup on her face. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> {{that was such a}} sad image. She's so vulnerable. I don't know any woman who hasn't had a moment {{sitting in front of the}} mirror and thinking, 'Help me, I want to be somebody else.' What makes it extra affecting is that [...] is stunning.|$|E
500|$|Lennon and Ono co-produced {{the song}} and album with Phil Spector, who commented on the track: [...] "We knew {{what we were going}} to do ... It was going to be John making a {{political}} statement, but a very commercial one as well ... <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> that 'Imagine' was like the national anthem." [...] Lennon described his working arrangement with Ono and Spector: [...] "Phil doesn't arrange or anything like that— and Phil will just sit in the other room and shout comments like, 'Why don't you try this sound' or 'You're not playing the piano too well'... I'll get the initial idea and ... we'll just find a sound from [...]" ...|$|E

500|$|Reviewing Beresford's after action report, Wellington {{was unhappy}} with its despondent tone and commented to a staff officer [...] "This won't do. It will drive the people in England mad. Write me down a victory." [...] The report was duly rewritten, {{although}} Wellington privately acknowledged that another such battle would ruin his army. Soult, {{on the basis of}} higher allied casualties, also claimed [...] "a signal victory". He generously paid tribute to the steadfastness of the allied troops, writing [...] "There is no beating these troops, in spite of their generals. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> they were bad soldiers, now I am sure of it. I had turned their right, pierced their centre and everywhere victory was mine– but they {{did not know how to}} run!" ...|$|E
500|$|Spanish {{critic and}} philosopher Miguel de Unamuno {{comments}} of the book, [...] "I never took Facundo by Sarmiento {{as a historical}} work, nor do I {{think it can be}} very valued in that regard. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> of it as a literary work, as a historical novel". However, Facundo cannot be classified as a novel or a specific genre of literature. According to González Echevarría, the book is at once an [...] "essay, biography, autobiography, novel, epic, memoir, confession, political pamphlet, diatribe, scientific treatise, [...] travelogue". Sarmiento's style and his exploration of the life of Facundo unify the three distinct parts of his work. Even the first section, describing Argentina's geography, follows this pattern, since Sarmiento contends that Facundo is a natural product of this environment.|$|E
500|$|In 1974, Aerosmith brought [...] "Train Kept A-Rollin'" [...] {{into the}} hard-rock mainstream. [...] Steven Tyler, Joe Perry, and Tom Hamilton had {{performed}} the song prior to joining Aerosmith. [...] Perry recalled, [...] "'Train Kept A-Rollin {{was the only}} song we had in common {{when we first got}} together. [...] Steven's band had played 'Train' and Tom and I played it in our band... It's a blues song, if you follow its roots all the way back... <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> if I could just play one song, it would be that one because of what it does to me". [...] Perry's band began performing the song regularly after he had been moved by the performance of [...] "Stroll On" [...] in Blowup; Tyler recalled his band opened for the Yardbirds in 1966: ...|$|E

500|$|According to Rolling Stone, Marquee Moon was a post-punk album, while Jason Heller from The A.V. Club {{described}} it as [...] "elegantly jagged" [...] art punk. Robert Christgau regarded it {{as more of a}} rock record because of Television's formal and technical abilities as musicians: [...] "It wasn't punk. Its intensity wasn't manic; it didn't come in spurts." [...] Both sides of the album began with three shorter, hook-driven songs, which Stylus Magazines Evan Chakroff said veered between progressive rock and post-punk styles. The title track and [...] "Torn Curtain" [...] were longer and more jam-oriented. [...] "As peculiar as it sounds, I've always thought that we were a pop band", Verlaine later told Select. [...] "You know, <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> Marquee Moon was a bunch of cool singles. And then I'd realise, Christ, [...] is ten minutes long. With two guitar solos." ...|$|E
500|$|... "When I {{was writing}} it, I {{was sitting in}} a fourth-floor walk-up on Avenue-B, and there was this {{gorgeous}} Puerto Rican boy sitting across me that I wanted {{to go out on a}} date with, and I just wanted to get the song over with. I ultimately did go out with him and the song was finished just before my last date with him, which I'm kinda happy that it did not continue... The dance floor was quite a magical place for me. I started off wanting to be a dancer, so that had a lot to do with the song. The freedom that I always feel when I'm dancing, that feeling of inhabiting your body, letting yourself go, expressing yourself through music. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> of it as a magical place– even if you're not taking ecstasy. Hence that came to me as the primary inspiration for 'Into the Groove'." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Kidd {{drove his}} dancers hard, {{partly because he}} himself was capable of doing all the dance steps that he {{required}} of them, his personal style was gentle. Nanette Fabray, who performed in Love Life, could only make dancing turns {{to the left side}} because of a hearing problem. Rather than insisting she turn to the right, as many choreographers would do, Kidd [...] "found that fascinating, and he made all the other dancers turn to the left". Julie Andrews recalled that the [...] "Burlington Bertie From Bow" [...] number in Star! was physically demanding, and she balked when Kidd asked her for a retake, saying she had a bad back. Andrews recalled that [...] "he looked crestfallen. Then he said, 'I wasn't trying to be mean. I just knew that when you saw it on film, you wouldn't be pleased.' <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> that was a nice way to say, 'Once more.|$|E

500|$|As {{children}} {{coming of}} age, Scout and Jem face hard realities {{and learn from}} them. Lee seems to examine Jem's sense of loss about how his neighbors have disappointed him more than Scout's. Jem says to their neighbor Miss Maudie {{the day after the}} trial, [...] "It's like bein' a caterpillar wrapped in a cocoon... <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> Maycomb folks were the best folks in the world, least that's what they seemed like". This leads him to struggle with understanding the separations of race and class. Just as the novel is an illustration of the changes Jem faces, it is also an exploration of the realities Scout must face as an atypical girl on the verge of womanhood. As one scholar writes, [...] "To Kill a Mockingbird can be read as a feminist Bildungsroman, for Scout emerges from her childhood experiences with a clear sense of her place in her community and an awareness of her potential power as the woman she will one day be." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} {{for the song}} was {{directed}} by Joseph Kahn, who revealed that the concept for the music video was created by Spears herself, by saying [...] "I would like to dance {{in a chair and}} drive in a car and break up with [...] boyfriend. [...] Those are your three elements." [...] Kahn ended up creating, according to Jocelyn Vena of MTV, [...] "a semi-futuristic world in which Spears walks into a club, breaks up with her cheating boyfriend and triumphantly walks in the rain, knowing her life is better off without him." [...] Kahn also considered the music video as very sophisticated, saying that it is [...] "definitely a departure from the sort of candy-colored videos she was doing before, so <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> this was the transition between Britney the teenage pop star and Britney the sort of diva she became." [...] An alternate footage of the video {{can be found on the}} DVD of Spears first compilation album [...]|$|E
500|$|Paul Nobuo Tatsuguchi {{graduated}} from {{middle school in}} Hiroshima on March 16, 1919. [...] On March 2, 1923, he {{graduated from}} Travier English Academy.

[...] When his parents both died unexpectedly in 1932, Paul returned to Japan to help settle the family affairs. [...] He returned to California in 1933 and entered the College of Medical Evangelists at Loma Linda University, completing the course of study in June 1937. [...] Paul Tatsuguchi then accepted a year's internship at White Memorial Hospital in Los Angeles. [...] While studying in America, Tatsuguchi was regarded by his classmates, who called him [...] "Tatsy" [...] or Paul, as a serious student, friendly but not gregarious. [...] Classmate J. Mudry, a year behind Tatsuguchi at Loma Linda University, later said, [...] "I know him well. [...] <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> Tatsuguchi—we called him Paul—was quite an American." ...|$|E
