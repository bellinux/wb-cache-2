40|$|International audienceSince {{the end of}} the 1990 s, unexplained {{outbreaks}} of acute encephalitis in children coinciding with litchi harvesting (May-July) have been documented in the Bac Giang Province in northern Vietnam. A retrospective ecologic analysis of data for 2004 - 2009 involving environmental, agronomic, and climatic factors was conducted to investigate the suspected association between the outbreaks and litchi harvesting. The clinical, biological, and immunologic characteristics of the patients suggested a viral etiology. The <b>ecologic</b> <b>study</b> revealed an independent association between litchi plantation surface proportion and acute encephalitis incidence: Incidence rate ratios were 1. 52 (95 % CI 0. 90 - 2. 57), 2. 94 (95 % CI 1. 88 - 4. 60), and 2. 76 (95 % CI 1. 76 - 4. 32) for second, third, and fourth quartiles, respectively, compared with the lowest quartile.

40|$|Background: Although {{several in}} vitro and animal studies have {{suggested}} that isoflavones might exert inhibitory effects on gastric carcinogenesis, epidemiologic studies have reported inconclusive results in this field. The aim of this brief review was to investigate whether such an association exists among dietary isoflavones and gastric cancer incidence, prevention, and mortality in epidemiologic studies. Materials and Methods: We conducted a search of PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane, Science direct, and Iranian Scientific Databases including Scientific Information Database and IranMedex Database (up to November 2014) using common keywords for studies that focused on dietary isoflavones and gastric cancer risk. Results: A total of nine epidemiologic studies consisting of five case-controls, three prospective cohorts, and one <b>ecologic</b> <b>study</b> were included in this review. An inverse association between dietary isoflavones and gastric cancer was shown in only one case-control and one <b>ecologic</b> <b>study.</b> Conclusion: In summary, whether anticarcinogenic properties of isoflavones are established, research found no substantial correlation in this field. There are insufficient studies to draw any firm conclusions about the relationship between isoflavones intake and the risk of gastric cancer. Hence, further evidence from cohort and trial studies are needed...|$|E

This paper examines three types of ecologic bias: confounding by group, effect measure modification by group, and non-differential exposure misclassification. Methods Bias of the risk difference on the individual and ecologic levels are compared using two-by-two tables, simple equations, and risk diagrams. Risk diagrams provide a convenient way to simultaneously display information from both levels. Results Confounding by group and effect measure modification by group act in the same direction on the individual and group levels, but have larger impact on the latter. The reduction in exposure variance caused by aggregation magnifies the individual level bias due to ignoring groups. For some studies, the magnification factor can be calculated from the ecologic data alone. Small magnification factors indicate little bias beyond that occurring at the individual level.

40|$|<b>Ecologic</b> <b>studies</b> use data {{aggregated}} over groups, {{rather than}} data on individuals.

Unfortunately the aggregation of data that defines <b>ecologic</b> <b>studies</b> results {{in a loss of}} information that can lead to ecologic bias. Specifically, ecologic bias arises from the inability of ecologic data to characterize within-area variability in exposures and confounders. We describe in detail particular forms of ecologic bias so that their potential impact on any particular study may be assessed. The only way to overcome such bias, while avoiding uncheckable assumptions concerning the missing information, is to supplement the ecologic with individual-level information, and we outline a number of proposals that have been suggested to achieve this aim...|$|R

40|$|The {{incidence}} {{of breast cancer}} in the United States has steadily increased {{for the past three}} decades. Exposure to excess estrogen, in both natural and synthetic forms, has been implicated as a risk factor for the development of this disease. Considerable interest has been focused on organochlorines, such as the triazine herbicides, and their possible role in the initiation or promotion of human breast cancer. To explore this relationship, an <b>ecologic</b> <b>study</b> of Kentucky counties was designed. Exposure to triazines was estimated by use of water contamination data, corn crop production, and pesticide use data. A summary index of triazine herbicide exposure was developed to classify counties into low, medium, or high exposure levels. Data on county breast cancer rates were obtained from the state registry. A Poisson regression analysis was performed, controlling for age, race, age at first live birth, income, and level of education. Results revealed a statistically significant increase in breast cancer risk with medium and high levels of triazine exposure [odds ratio (OR) = 1. 14,p< 0. 0001 and OR = 1. 2, p< 0. 0001, respectively].

40|$|Purpose Controversy {{persists}} {{over whether}} cancer risk is increased in communities surrounding oil fields, {{especially in the}} Oriente region of Ecuador. This <b>ecologic</b> <b>study</b> uses quantitative exposure data, updated mortality data, and improved statistical methods to study the impact of oil exploration and production activities on cancer mortality rates in the Oriente. Methods Cancer mortality rates in the Oriente in 1990 through 2010 were compared between seven cantons with active oil exploration and production as of 1990 and thir-teen cantons {{with little or no}} such activities. Poisson regression was used to estimate mortality rate ratios (RRs) adjusted for age and sex. In a two-stage analysis, canton-specific log-RRs were regressed against quantitative esti-mates of cumulative barrels of oil produced and well-years per canton, adjusting for canton-level demographic and socioeconomic factors. Results Overall and site-specific cancer mortality rates were comparable between oil-producing and non-oil-pro-ducing cantons. For overall cancer mortality in males and females combined, the RR comparing oil-producing to non-oil-producing cantons was 0. 85 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 72 – 1. 00]. For leukemia mortality, the corresponding RR was 0. 80 (95 % CI 0. 57 – 1. 13). Results also revealed no excess of mortality from acute non-lym-phocytic, myeloid, or childhood leukemia. Standardized mortality ratios were consistent with RRs. Canton-specific RRs showed no pattern in relation to oil production volume or well-years.

40|$|The {{assessment}} of {{long-term effects of}} air pollution in humans relies on epidemiologic studies. A widely used design consists of cross-sectional or cohort <b>studies</b> in which <b>ecologic</b> assignment of exposure, based on a fixed-site ambient monitor, is employed. Although health outcome and usually {{a large number of}} covariates are measured in individuals, these studies are often called ecological. We will introduce the term semi-individual design for these studies. We review the major properties and limitations with regard to causal inference of truly <b>ecologic</b> <b>studies,</b> in which outcome, exposure, and covariates are available on an aggregate level only. Misclassification problems and issues related to confounding and model specification in truly <b>ecologic</b> <b>studies</b> limit etiologic inference to individuals. In contrast, the semi-individual study shares its methodological and inferential properties with typical individual-level study designs. The major caveat relates to the case where too few study areas, e. g., two or three, are used, which render control of aggregate level confounding impossible. The issue of exposure misclassification is of general concern in epidemiology and not an exclusive problem of the semi-individual design. In a multicenter setting, the semi-individual study is a valuable tool to approach long-term effects of air pollution. Knowledge about the error structure of the ecologically assigned exposure allows consideration of the impact of ecologically assigned exposure on effect estimation. Semi-individual studies, i. e., individual level air pollution <b>studies</b> with <b>ecologic</b> exposure assignment, more readily permit valid inference to individuals and should not be labeled as <b>ecologic</b> <b>studies...</b>|$|R

The reason for this, as well as its exact pathophysiologic {{mechanisms}} are yet unknown. In this <b>ecologic</b> <b>study</b> we assessed the relation between water nitrate content and prevalence of GERD in Tehran, Iran. Methods: We determined the prevalence of acid regurgitation (AR) heartburn or any of them occurring on a frequent (at least weekly) or infrequent basis in areas with different water nitrate. The areas for nitrate were dened as below: 100 mg/L. Frequency of each symptom was assessed in each area and compared. Adjustment for age, sex, education, NSAID-consumption, BMI, smoking, history of GERD in rst degree relatives and spouse was done in a multivariate model. Results: People living in areas with water nitrate content more than 100 mg/L had a higher chance of suffering from frequent AR than those living in areas with water nitrate less than 100 mg/L (25. 5 % vs. 12. 0 %, OR: 2. 53, 95 % CI: 1. 36 – 4. 73, P= 0. 006). After adjustment for the named factors, the relationship remained signicant (OR: 3. 65, 95 % CI: 1. 32 – 10. 09). The relation for frequent heartburn or infrequent symptoms was not signicant.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: On August 31, 1998, the rhesus-human reassortant {{rotavirus}} vaccine (RRV-TV) was licensed {{for use in}} the U. S. During {{the next}} nine months, 15 cases of intussusception were reported among infants who received the vaccine. Case-control and cohort studies showed a significantly increased risk of developing intussusception within one week of receiving the vaccine; subsequent <b>ecologic</b> <b>studies</b> did not. In this study, the authors used data on RRV-TV vaccination rates from the National Immunization Survey (NIS) to estimate state and national RRV-TV uptake rates and factors associated with receiving RRV-TV. These estimates are a key component in evaluating published <b>ecologic</b> <b>studies</b> designed to investigate the relationship between receipt of the vaccine and intussusception. METHODS: The authors analyzed NIS data for children ages 19 to 35 months who were eligible to receive RRV-TV between September 1998 and July 1999. The authors estimated vaccine coverage and the number of doses administered by state, NIS sampling quarter, and birth cohort, and analyzed demographic and socioeconomic variables to evaluate their relationship with receiving RRV-TV. RESULTS: It was estimated that approximately 1 million doses of RRV-TV were administered to 504, 585 (+/- 61, 854) children, 13. 4 % (+/- 1. 6 %) of children who were eligible. The estimated number of doses administered and the vaccination coverage rate varied greatly from state to state. Children living in households with higher socioeconomic conditions were more likely to receive the vaccine. CONCLUSION: <b>Ecologic</b> <b>studies</b> had a limited ability to detect {{a significant increase in the}} population incidence rate of intussusception that could be attributed to RRV-TV because populations in these studies consisted primarily of children who did not receive the vaccine.

Methods We searched the Medline database for epidemiological studies on air pollution and health outcomes published between January 2002 and December 2007. We also examined the reference lists of individual papers and reviews. Two independent reviewers classified the studies according to type of air pollutant, duration of exposure and health outcome considered. Among European investigations that examined long-term PM exposure we found 4 cohort studies (considering total and cardiopulmonary mortality), 1 case-control study (considering mortality from myocardial infarction), and 4 <b>ecologic</b> <b>studies</b> (2 studies considering total and cardiopulmonary mortality and 2 studies focused on cardiovascular mortality). Results Measurement indicators of PM exposure used in European studies, including PM 10, PM 2. 5, total suspended particulate and black smoke, were heterogeneous. This notwithstanding, in all analytic studies total mortality was directly associated with long-term exposure to PM. The excesses in mortality were mainly due to cardiovascular and respiratory causes. Three out of 4 <b>ecologic</b> <b>studies</b> found significant direct associations between PM indexes and mortality.

40|$|Little {{is known}} about {{environmental}} causes of childhood cancer. This is {{probably due to the}} relative rarity of cancer in children. In the United States, cancer incidence in adults is over 20 times greater than cancer incidence in children. The situation is {{compounded by the fact that}} two groups of cancers, leukemias and brain and spinal tumors, account for half of all childhood cancers. The rarity of childhood cancer renders the conduct of most cohort studies infeasible. The majority of studies assessing potential environmental risk factors for childhood cancers have been case-control studies, which are highly efficient for studying rare diseases. Case-control studies of childhood cancers have been greatly facilitated by using cooperative clinical trial groups for case identification. The national studies that have emerged utilize random-digit telephone dialing and telephone interviewing as feasible and economic means of identifying and interviewing controls. Other approaches such as descriptive epidemiology, <b>ecologic</b> <b>studies,</b> and studies of cancer clusters have proven to be disappointing in elucidating environmental causes of childhood cancer. Descriptive and <b>ecologic</b> <b>studies</b> provide no information on specific exposures of study subjects; rather, they use population levels as surrogates for individual exposure. Studies of cancer clusters have also proven to be disappointing. Although there are numerous difficulties in conducting research on the causes of childhood cancer, these difficulties can be remedied by using carefully designed and conducted studies. It should be remembered that the epidemiologic approach is probably the most likely research venue for uncovering environmental causes of childhood cancer.
