40|$|The {{concentrations}} in the air of total and of respirable (less than 7 microns equivalent diameter) dust were measured in 142 workrooms of 17 Northern Ireland <b>flax</b> <b>spinning</b> <b>mills</b> using a hexhlet air sampler. Neither the distribution of total nor of respirable dust concentrations (mg. / 100 m. 3 air) measured in each of four large workrooms conformed to the normal (or Gaussian) distribution, but it is shown that the logarithms (to the base 10) of these concentrations are normally distributed. In order to make valid statistical comparisons between the dustiness of {{the different types of}} room, mean log. concentrations are therefore used. The mean log. concentrations of total and of respirable dust, and the 95 % confidence limits derived from these, were calculated for each room surveyed. For total and respirable dust the ranges ofmean log. concentrations followed in brackets by the respective antilogs. (mg. / 100 m. 3 air) were as follows...|$|R

Twenty-eight acres of land entitled "The Throne Lands " were purchased and a Children's Hospital with 32 beds erected at a cost of £ 4, 000 to the designs of the architect Mr T Hevey. The site was considered an ideal one situated on the lower escarpment of Cavehill, and commanding an uninterrupted view of Belfast Lough, the County Down coast and the Crumlin Hills. The hospital first opened its doors to patients on October 1, 1874 and was subsequently transferred by Mr John Martin in 1875 to be incorporated within the Belfast Royal Hospital with a stipulation that a convalescent home should be built on the Lands within 2 years of the transfer.

In 1835 they {{converted}} an old flour mill on the River Mourne into a <b>flax</b> <b>spinning</b> <b>mill,</b> and erected a bigger mill behind it in the 1850s. However, nearly everything in Sion Mills today was designed later, in the 1880s and 1890s, by James Herdman's son-in-law, the English architect William Frederick Unsworth. Sion House, a half timbered Elizabethan style mansion originally built in the early 1840s, was largely remodelled and expanded in the 1880s by Unsworth, {{around the same time}} as he was designing the first Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon (this theatre was destroyed by a fire in 1926). More modest half timbered buildings include the gatehouse, the Recreation Hall and Old St. Saviour's Church. Unsworth based his design for the polychrome Anglican church, the Church of the Good Shepherd (1909), on a church in Pistoia in Tuscany. This church is built in an Italian neo-Romanesque style. By contrast, the modern Church of St Teresa (1963, by Patrick Haughey), the Catholic place of worship, is admirable for its severely plain lines - a long rectangle with a striking representation of the Last Supper on the slate facade. Oisín Kelly was the artist.|$|E
