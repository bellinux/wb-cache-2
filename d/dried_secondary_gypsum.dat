Other less continuous units are also present. Peculiar sedlmentational conditions are described indetail in a larger Italian paper. In the Gypsum formation primary anhydrite and primary gypsum are varved rocks with inverse graded bedding of the laminae, due to chemical deposition. <b>Secondary</b> <b>gypsum</b> derives from anhydrite by paradiagenetic ransformation aud shows two different petrologic types. In the "sulphlferous facies " of the <b>Gypsum</b> Formation selenitie <b>secondary</b> <b>gypsum</b> is developed, with large size crystals and a peculiar fabric of almost free growth. In the "saliferous facies " alabastrine <b>secondary</b> <b>gypsum</b> shows structures caused by hindered growth under considerabIe load. A sequence of stages in the anhydrite-gypsum transformation {{seem to be the}} following: (1) build-ing of limpid selenite crystals; (2) ruptural deformation of their peripheral zones, giving rise to super-hldlvidual polarisation; (3) production of intergranular fine-size gypsum aggregate of mylonltic har-acter. Ruptural deformation is originated by volume increase of the solid phase during the transforma-tion. Residual anhydrlte inclusions are present in the first two stages, absent in the last one. The above sequence is just the reverse of that described in the studies on American and German salt domes. Goldman (1952) gives the name "integration " to a process of progressive adjustment of randomly oriented flue-size gypsum pieces to superindivlduals with less dispersed optical orientation and finally to limpid selenite crystals. This prcx-ess i very different from the well-known "Sammel-kristallisation " and {{does not seem to be}} feasible in view of the physieo-ehemical forces known thus far.

40|$|We {{report the}} δ 34 S and δ 18 O(SO 4) {{measured}} in gypsum, pyrite, and elemental sulfur through a 456 -m thick sediment core {{from the center}} of the Dead Sea, representing the last ~ 200 kyrs, as well as from the exposed glacial outcrops of the Masada M 1 section located on the margins of the modern Dead Sea. The results are used to explore and quantify the evolution of sulfur microbial metabolism in the Dead Sea and to reconstruct the lake's water column configuration during the late Quaternary. Layers and laminae of primary gypsum, the main sulfur-bearing mineral in the sedimentary column, display the highest δ 34 S and δ 18 O(SO 4) in the range of 13 – 28 and 13 – 30 ‰, respectively. Within this group, gypsum layers deposited during interglacials display lower δ 34 S and δ 18 O(SO 4) relative to those associated with glacial or deglacial stages. The reduced sulfur phases, including chromium reducible sulfur, and <b>secondary</b> <b>gypsum</b> crystals are characterized by extremely low δ 34 S in the range of − 27 to + 7 ‰. The δ 18 O(SO 4) of the <b>secondary</b> <b>gypsum</b> in the M 1 outcrop ranges from 8 to 14 ‰. The relationship between δ 34 S and δ 18 O(SO 4) of primary gypsum suggests that the rate of microbial sulfate reduction was lower during glacial relative to interglacial times. This suggests that the freshening of the lake during glacial wet intervals, and the subsequent rise in sulfate concentrations, slowed the rate of microbial metabolism. Alternatively, this could imply that sulfate-driven anaerobic methane oxidation, the dominant sulfur microbial metabolism today, is a feature of the hypersalinity in the modern Dead Sea. Sedimentary sulfides are quantitatively oxidized during epigenetic exposure, retaining the lower δ 34 S signature; the δ 18 O(SO 4) of this <b>secondary</b> <b>gypsum</b> is controlled by oxygen atoms derived equally from atmospheric oxygen and from water, which is likely a unique feature in this hyperarid environment...|$|R
40|$|<b>Secondary</b> <b>gypsum</b> rocks, {{formed from}} {{anhydrite}} by {{the action of}} ground waters and/or surface weather-ing and unmodified by tectonic influences, are divided into two main petrographic groups, porphyroblastic and alabastrine <b>secondary</b> <b>gypsum.</b> The two groups though often occurring together, are thought o be essen-tially distinct. Porphyroblastic gypsum is the first to form and sometimes dates from early diagenesis. Alabastrine. gypsum includes a wide wtriety of related textures. Hydration fabrics vary from indefinite grains with irregular extinction to more perfectly defined granoblastic gypsum. Reerystallizatior ~ of hydra-tion gypsum leads to unequigranular granoblastic gypsum, in unstrained and perfectly oriented grains. Prophvroblastie gypsum may also recrystallizc in conjunction with the alabastrine variety. In most cases of gypsifieation there is no evidence for any volnme increase or associated crushing, and there may often be a net volume reduction due to solution. Excess amounts of certain trace-elements, notably strontium and boron, are released from some anhydrite rocks during hydration and occur in the form of such minerals as celestite and probertite. Three reaction mechanisms appear to be possible, all of which may occur naturally {{to a greater or lesser}} extent. Late stage displacive gypsum veins possibly form from the excess sulfate removed in solu-tion during gypsification, or alternatively may precipitate from sulfate-rich eonnate waters...|$|R

40|$|Mississippian nodular anhydrites {{beneath an}} {{unconformity}} in the subsurface of southern Saskatchewan are locally replaced by calcite, pyrite and celestite. Triassic clastics above the unconformity are green, rather than red, and a usually developed subunconformity alteration zone (where carbonates are dolomitized, and porosity {{is filled with}} anhydrite) is absent. The unconformity lacks karstic features (unlike in the USA), and probably formed in a hyperarid climate. Mississippian anhydrites near the unconformity are not preferentially dissolved, nor were they extensively hydrated. Anhydrite calcitization occurred only after the unconformity was shallowly buried by redbeds, and it probably involved sulphate-reducing bacteria. Hydrogen sulphide, generated by bacteria, reduced redbed pigments. The replacement calcite contains pseudomorphs and relicts of anhydrite, and pseudomorphs of <b>secondary</b> <b>gypsum.</b> These indicate calcitization occurred only after original Mississippian gypsum was altered to anhydrite and this, in turn, was partially converted back to <b>secondary</b> <b>gypsum</b> beneath the unconformity. Replacement occurred concurrently with the formation elsewhere of the dolomitized zone beneath the unconformity. Sulphur isotopic ratios of replacement pyrite are depleted relative to Mississippian sulphate values, consistent with the activities of sulphate-reducing bacteria. Carbon isotopic ratios of replacive calcites, however, do not support this interpretation, and are identical to those of Mississippian limestones. Simple replacement of sulphate by pore-water bicarbonate (in equilibrium with host limestones) is unlikely because protons generated during the reaction should have created acidic conditions in which calcite would have dissolved. A full explanation of the calcitization remains elusive, but may involve replacement occurring in an active groundwater system and/or bacterial sulphate reduction occurring upstream of the site of calcitization...|$|R

Results show that the variety of calcium sulfate determines its solubility and dissolution rate, which directly lead to the differences in the formation content, time and size of ettringite (AFt), and affects the volume stability, which finally determines the strength of pastes. When the calcium sulfate dosage is 7. 5 %, the formation content of AFt firstly increases and then decreases.

When anhydrite is added, the transit time from AFt to monosulfate is the latest, and the size of AFt is much longer and thinner than those with other calcium sulfate, additionally the AFt content before 8 hours is prominently lower than others, which leads to lower strength.

These dikes are probably part of the regional magmatic activity of the Sukhothai Arc during the Early to Middle Triassic. Sulfur (δ 34 S) and strontium (87 Sr/ 86 Sr) isotopic compositions of the sulfates range from 15. 86 ‰ to 16. 26 ‰ and from 0. 70810 to 0. 70817, respectively.
