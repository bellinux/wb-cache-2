5|$|Two unassisted triple plays {{were turned}} at Forbes Field. The <b>first</b> <b>took</b> place on May 7, 1925, when Pittsburgh's Glenn Wright {{achieved}} the feat.

5|$|Filming <b>first</b> <b>took</b> {{place in}} a {{storeroom}} in the industrial district of Shanghai. Having difficulties scouting a cotton factory suitable for shooting, set designers decided to recreate one {{in the style of}} the 1930s. They spent weeks transforming an abandoned storeroom into the Zhen Hua Cotton Mill Factory, a 1930s cotton mill factory founded by Ip's friend Chow Ching-chuen (played in the film by Simon Yam) during the Sino-Japanese War. It was where Ip Man first taught Wing Chun openly to the public.|$|E

25|$|Rehearsal on Broadchurch {{was kept}} to a minimum. To heighten the raw and tension-filled tone of the show, actors were often {{prevented}} from seeing the space they were to perform in until shooting began. Almost no improvisation of dialogue occurred on the set. A heavy reliance was also placed on getting the <b>first</b> <b>take</b> right. Director James Strong believed the <b>first</b> <b>take</b> was more spontaneous and more natural than subsequent takes. Subsequently, most of what the viewer sees in Broadchurch series one are <b>first</b> <b>takes.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{following}} year, Nottingham Forest won {{the first}} of two consecutive titles, the first time that any club won back-to-back League Cup titles. The <b>first</b> <b>took</b> a replay at Old Trafford to beat Liverpool, and they beat Southampton 3–2 to win the second. Liverpool won four consecutive titles between 1981 and 1984, the most consecutive League Cup titles won by any club. Nottingham Forest won two more consecutive titles in 1989 and 1990.|$|E
5|$|The longest-serving {{governor}} was the first, George Clinton, who <b>first</b> <b>took</b> office on July 30, 1777, and served seven terms {{in two different}} periods, totaling just under 21 years in office. (As 18 of those years were consecutive, Clinton also served the longest consecutive period in office for a New York governor.) Charles Poletti had the shortest term, serving 29 days following {{the resignation of the}} previous governor in 1942. The current governor is Andrew Cuomo, who took office on January 1, 2011.|$|E
5|$|Two by-elections {{were held}} after the main election. The <b>first</b> <b>took</b> place on 17 March 1957 at Nowy Sącz.

5|$|A {{survey in}} 1932 {{found that the}} roof was cracked and it {{eventually}} collapsed in 1935. In 1936 the roof structure was straightened, preserving the medieval trusses where possible, and covered with clay tiles. The restoration was undertaken by the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings, with the work being funded by Roger Clark of the local shoemakers C. & J. Clark who bought the derelict barn for £5. It has been owned by the National Trust since 1938. Designation as a Grade I listed building <b>first</b> <b>took</b> place in 1961. A survey in 2002 found minor repairs were needed to the doors and wall plate.|$|E
5|$|Antiquarians like John Aubrey and William Stukeley <b>first</b> <b>took</b> an {{interest}} in the site during the 18th century. It later received archaeological attention, although it has not been excavated. Local folklore has grown up around the circle, associating it with the Devil and with children petrified into rock. The Nine Stones are regarded as a sacred site by local Druids, who perform religious ceremonies there. The circle is adjacent to the A35 road and encircled by trees. The site is owned by English Heritage and is open without charge to visitors.|$|E

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the English Civil War in 1642 between the supporters of Charles I and those of Parliament, Dartmouth initially sided with Parliament and the castle was guarded by five men. In 1643, Prince Maurice besieged the town and the castle was overcome by artillery positioned on the higher ground of the overlooking hill behind it. An earthwork fort, called Gallants Bower, may subsequently have been built to protect this vulnerable position; an alternative explanation is that the fort was first built in 1627 and was simply brought back into use during the conflict. In January 1646, Sir Thomas Fairfax led a Parliamentary army to retake Dartmouth. He <b>first</b> <b>took</b> the town, then Gallants Bower, before forcing the surrender of Sir Hugh Pollard, the castle's commander, the following day. The Carews' house was probably badly damaged during the attack.|$|E
5|$|Contador <b>first</b> <b>took</b> {{the race}} lead {{after the second}} {{mountain}} stage, to Marmolada, by finishing nearly fifteen minutes ahead of previous race leader Gabriele Bosisio. The race's overall classification had been headed for several days beforehand by Giovanni Visconti, who participated in a breakaway in the sixth stage which won him sufficient time to hold the race leader's pink jersey {{for more than a}} week. In the race's final week, Contador faced stern challenges from Riccò and defending Giro champion Danilo Di Luca. Though Contador did not win any stage, his performances were consistently strong enough to remain ahead through to the conclusion of the race.|$|E
5|$|During the war, {{two state}} {{elections}} were held, in 1941 and 1944. In the 1941 election, {{there was a}} significant decrease in the independent vote, and both the Labor Party and the LCL made gains, with Playford forming the LCL's first majority government. This was in large part due to the LCL's shift to the right on social issues to usurp the independents' appeal. In 1942, compulsory voting (but not enrolment) was introduced, and <b>first</b> <b>took</b> effect at the 1944 election, with an increase in voter turnout from 51% to 89%. Again Playford won with a one-seat LCL majority, hanging on {{with the help of the}} malapportioned electoral system.|$|E

5|$|Gibanica {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular and {{recognizable}} pastry dishes from the Balkans, whether served on festive occasions, or as a comforting family snack. In Serbia, the dish is often consumed at traditional events such as Christmas, Easter and Slava. According to the Serbian media, the largest Gibanica ever made was in the town of Mionica in 2007. It weighed over 1,000 kg, and was applied for inclusion in the Guinness Book of Records. 330kg of phyllo dough, 330kg of cheese, 3,300 eggs, 30 l. of oil, 110 l. of mineral water, 50kg of lard and 500 packets of baking powder went into its creation. In Serbia, as well as in neighboring countries, there are festivals dedicated to pies. One of them, called the Gibanica festival or Days of Banitsa, is held each year in Bela Palanka. It <b>first</b> <b>took</b> place in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Glinka's anthem was {{replaced}} soon after Yeltsin's successor as President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, <b>first</b> <b>took</b> office on 7 May 2000. The federal legislature established and approved {{the music of}} the National Anthem of the Soviet Union, with newly written lyrics, in December 2000, and became the second anthem used by Russia after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The government sponsored a contest to find lyrics, eventually settling upon a new composition by Mikhalkov; according to the government, the lyrics were selected to evoke and eulogize the history and traditions of Russia. Yeltsin criticized Putin for supporting the reintroduction of the Soviet-era national anthem even though opinion polls showed that many Russians favored this decision.|$|E
5|$|Greer Stadium {{has been}} the setting for eight no-hit games, {{including}} one perfect game. The <b>first</b> <b>took</b> place on May 16, 1981, when Jeff Cornell, of the visiting Jacksonville Suns, pitched a 4–0 no-hit game against the Sounds. The second no-hitter at Greer was Jim Deshaies' 5–1 win over the Columbus Astros on May 4, 1984. In the second inning, Deshaies walked three batters and hit another, accounting for the only Astros run of the game, part of a seven-inning doubleheader. The third, a 6–0 win over the Oklahoma City 89ers, was thrown by Nashville's Bryan Kelly on July 17, 1985.|$|E

5|$|Himmler and Potthast confessed {{their love}} for each other at Christmastime in 1938. At first they tried to keep it platonic, but they fell into an adulterous {{relationship}}. Himmler's wife since 1928 and mother of their daughter, Margarete Himmler, found out about Himmler's relationship with Potthast at some time in February 1941. She felt humiliated and bitter, and Potthast's parents rejected the extramarital relationship. Potthast <b>first</b> <b>took</b> up residence in Grunewald and from 1943 she lived in Brückentin, near the estate of Oswald Pohl, because she was a friend of his wife, Eleonore. Lina Heydrich, wife of Himmler's right-hand man Reinhard Heydrich, and Gerda Bormann, spouse of Martin Bormann, were also counted among her friends. Later she lived in Berchtesgaden, Bavaria.|$|E
5|$|However, {{following}} {{the terrorist attacks}} {{that occurred in the}} United States on 11 September 2001 and American military action in Afghanistan on 7 October, the Government decided to temporarily suspend overseas voting at the 2001 general election as having large numbers of Singaporeans congregating at known locations at known times could put them at risk of further terrorist attacks. Therefore, overseas voting <b>first</b> <b>took</b> place at the 2006 general election. The number of Singapore citizens who registered to vote overseas was 1,017, and of these, 553 resided in the 16 constituencies that were contested in the election. Eventually, 335 electors voted at eight polling stations around the world.|$|E
5|$|Malmö Fotbollförening, {{commonly}} called Malmö FF, is a Swedish professional association football club based in Malmö, whose first team {{play in the}} highest tier of Swedish football, Allsvenskan, as of the 2017 season. Malmö FF was founded on 24 February 1910 by 19 members of a predecessor club named BK Idrott who, for a short time, had been merged with cross-town rivals IFK Malmö. After participating in regional competitions and national cup play in Svenska Mästerskapet during the 1910s, Malmö FF joined Sweden's newly created national league system in 1920, and played in the second tier of Swedish football for the next decade– {{with the exception of}} one season in Svenska Serien, then unofficially the top football league in Sweden. Allsvenskan was established as Sweden's official first tier in 1924, and Malmö FF <b>first</b> <b>took</b> part in 1931.|$|E
