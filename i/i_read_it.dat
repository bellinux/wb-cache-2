500|$|The idea {{to create}} a story {{involving}} the 731 unit came from series creator Chris Carter. He noted, [...] "Unit 731 first came to my attention {{at the same time}} as it did for a lot of other people, when <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>it</b> in the New York Times about what the Japanese did to prisoners of war during the Second World War." [...] Carter decided that an episode based around former war criminals who had received [...] "clemency so [...] could use their science" [...] would be [...] "interesting".|$|E
500|$|Dunst {{was offered}} the role of Angela in the 1999 drama film American Beauty, but turned it down {{because she did not}} want to appear in the film's suggestive sexual scenes or kiss the film's star Kevin Spacey. She later explained: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>it,</b> I was 15 and I don't think I was mature enough to {{understand}} the script's material." [...] That same year, she co-starred in the comedy film Dick, opposite Michelle Williams. The film is a parody retelling the events of the Watergate scandal which led to the resignation of U.S. president Richard Nixon.|$|E

500|$|Guest actor Jared Harris {{made his}} third {{appearance}} {{of the season in}} [...] "Ability". At the time, the actor had not heard whether his character would be returning, though he later appeared in the first season finale and five fourth season episodes. Harris described his character as an [...] "anti-hero who is fighting for the just cause" [...] and the episode as [...] "a page-turner... When <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>it,</b> I said, 'Ah, this is a fantastic one. I can't wait to see it.' It's directed with a lot of energy, a lot of tension. It's a good one, a really good one".|$|E
500|$|Ellie Kendrick, who portrays Meera Reed, {{spoke about}} {{the writing of the}} episode {{following}} its airing, and revealed that she was surprised by the scene, saying [...] "When I was reading the episode, I completely forgot that I was a character in the show. I was reading it with such excitement, because this is a real story unfolding, with so many mysteries and quantum leaps and Inception-style traveling between the past and the present. I found it very exciting. So the first time <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>it,</b> I was just reading it for enjoyment, really, because it was so well-written and exciting. Once I picked my jaw up off the floor, I was really keen to get started working on it, because it's such an epic sequence." ...|$|E

[...] The verses pose the questions: [...] "What have I got?/ That {{makes you want to}} love me?/ Is it my body?"—and declare in the chorus: [...] "Have you got the time to find out/ Who I really am?" [...] "Hallowed Be My Name" [...] follows with lyrics such as [...] "Screaming at mothers/ Cursing the Bible". [...] "Second Coming" [...] {{continues}} on the theme of religion: [...] "...have no other gods before me/ I'm the light/ The devil's getting smarter all the time" [...] The track developed from one of Cooper's lyrical fragments—"Time is getting closer/ <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>it</b> on a poster"—and is set to a delicate piano by Ezrin.|$|E

500|$|Life at the Bottom has {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Gregory Schneider of the Topeka Capital-Journal called the collection [...] "the best {{exploration of the}} problems of poverty ever written." [...] America magazine writer, Peter Heinegg, considered the essays to be a [...] "barrage of breathtakingly horrible true-life...stories", but he said that Dalrymple puts too much of his personal [...] "snorting indignation" [...] into the text without letting the reader draw their own conclusions. He ended by saying, [...] "Dalrymple's case sounds like a paranoid tirade or perverse tribute, but it is at least partially redeemed by the barrage of breathtakingly horrible true-life (one assumes) stories that this very angry doctor tells...to bolster it." [...] John Clark of Liberty magazine called it [...] "so compelling...that <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>it</b> cover to cover in a day's time—and later reread it twice." ...|$|E
500|$|Work on Hooper's next film, The King's Speech, {{began in}} the same year. Hooper explained: [...] "It was a stage play, and my mother who's Australian was invited to a fringe [...] reading in London because she's part of the Australian community. The play's about the {{relationship}} between King George the Sixth and his Australian speech therapist. She came back and said 'you've got to read this play,' and <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>it</b> and it was brilliant ...". Hooper cast Colin Firth as George VI and Geoffrey Rush as Lionel Logue and spent three weeks with the actors reading the script and rehearsing. Principal photography took place on location around the UK from November 2009 to January 2010. During editing, Hooper continued to consult with Firth and Rush by sending them cuts of the film and listening to their feedback.|$|E
500|$|Brooks {{discussed}} the cultural {{influences on the}} novel. He claimed inspiration from [...] (1984) by Studs Terkel, stating: [...] " [...] an oral history of World War II. <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>it</b> when I was a teenager and it's sat with me ever since. When I sat down to write World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War, I {{wanted it to be}} in the vein of an oral history." [...] Brooks also cited renowned zombie film director George A. Romero as an influence and criticized the Return of the Living Dead films: [...] "They cheapen zombies, make them silly and campy. They've done for the living dead what the old Batman TV show did for the Dark Knight." [...] Brooks acknowledged making several references to popular culture in the novel, including one to alien robot franchise Transformers, but declined to identify the others so that readers could discover them independently.|$|E

500|$|When {{asked about}} its sexually {{explicit}} nature, the singer responded: [...] "Erm, yeah. I guess {{a part of}} me wanted to be truthful about what it is that really drives me, and maybe give back to the place that is nourishing me... I don't know what to say. When I read books or see films or listen to albums I want certain things. I want a heart—I'm very old school like that, I'm very emotional... I just didn't want anybody to know. I wanted it for myself. The lyric to 'Cocoon' was a whole diary, then I had to edit 90 per cent of it out. It's very hard to explain, but when <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>it</b> and the other person it's about reads it, we don't feel abused or anything. I think there's songs where I've been more... scruffy about what I'm expressing. I have a problem with music that's too indulgent. It's like 'Keep your own dirty laundry, please'".|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{set out in}} a {{sequence}} of the year's seasons, which, director Jason Reitman explains, [...] "really resonated with me when <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>it,</b> because they mirror the three trimesters of Juno's pregnancy." [...] Because filming took place over only 30 days, fake flora was used {{to give the impression}} of different seasons while other flora was edited in post-production. Brown leaves were composited onto a fake tree outside Juno's house and cherry blossom trees outside Leah's house were touched up in a lighter shade of pink to depict autumn; a fan was used to blow leaves around in some scenes as if the leaves were falling from trees. Fake flowers were used in front of Paulie's house {{at the end of the}} film to give the impression of summer. Reitman used different colors to inform character, such as the burgundy and gold Dancing Elk High School track uniforms and an early scene with Juno in a red hooded jacket [...] "walking through a world of somber greens and browns." ...|$|E
500|$|Michael Rosen, {{a novelist}} and poet, {{advocated}} {{the books were}} not suited for children, who {{would be unable to}} grasp the complex themes. Rosen also stated that [...] "J. K. Rowling is more of an adult writer." [...] The critic Anthony Holden wrote in The Observer on his experience of judging Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban for the 1999 Whitbread Awards. His overall view of the series was negative – [...] "the Potter saga was essentially patronising, conservative, highly derivative, dispiritingly nostalgic for a bygone Britain", and he speaks of [...] "a pedestrian, ungrammatical prose style". Ursula K. Le Guin said, [...] "I have no great opinion of it. When so many adult critics were carrying on about the 'incredible originality' of the first Harry Potter book, <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>it</b> {{to find out what the}} fuss was about, and remained somewhat puzzled; it seemed a lively kid's fantasy crossed with a [...] "school novel", good fare for its age group, but stylistically ordinary, imaginatively derivative, and ethically rather mean-spirited." ...|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rotten Tomatoes, Gosling was asked what had attracted him to the film, and whether he had read the script at the time Jackman and director Neil Marshall were attached to it. He replied: I think {{that might be the}} original one I read. I read a few drafts. I read one as well where he wasn't a stunt driver at all, which was a newer draft [...] maybe that's the one Hugh Jackman had; I'm not sure exactly. Basically when <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>it,</b> in {{trying to figure out who}} would do something like this, the only way to make sense of this is that this is a guy that's seen too many movies, and he's started to confuse his life for a film. He's lost in the mythology of Hollywood and he's become an amalgamation of all the characters that he admires. [...] When Ryan Gosling signed on for the leading role, he was allowed to choose the director, a first in his career. A fan of his work, the actor chose the Danish filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn. [...] "It had to be [...] There was no other choice." ...|$|E
500|$|LeMond grew {{up living}} an active, outdoor life. Hiking, hunting, skiing and flyfishing were boyhood pastimes. The ranch country [...] of the Sierra Nevada {{mountain}} range lent itself to such pursuits. A hyperactive youngster, LeMond believes these outdoor activities helped {{keep him out}} of trouble. [...] "I was a boy who just could not sit still. I had trouble focusing in school. Parents and educators then did not have the skill set to diagnose and cope with what we know now was a classic case of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). ADHD certainly was not the frequently medicated childhood disease it is today. My triumph over the symptoms was found atop two thin tires over many dusty miles." [...] Said LeMond: [...] "That's one of the traits. It's the inability to sit down [...] to something you are not really interested in and absorb it. If they are interested in it, people with ADD excel in really good ways. When I got into cycling I would say the sport itself took a fog off my brain. I was able to absorb stuff <b>I</b> <b>read.</b> <b>It</b> changed my life." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Winds of Winter" [...] saw the {{departure}} of several cast members and recurring guest actors from the series. Notables included Dean-Charles Chapman, whose character, King Tommen Baratheon, committed suicide in the episode. Before appearing {{in the role of}} Tommen, which was originally portrayed by actor Callum Wharry, Chapman appeared in the third season of the series as Martyn Lannister, a minor character who was also killed off. Chapman stated that he found out about his character's death the night before the initial table read for the season, saying [...] "I was in my hotel, minding my own business, and I got a phone call. I picked up the phone, and instantly, I knew it was coming. It was David Benioff and Dan Weiss, the two creators of the show, and they stated the facts. But they did it really nice. I couldn't have asked for a better way to have that news broken to me. Them telling me beforehand really helped me out, otherwise I would have been in a state when <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>it</b> in the scripts. I probably would have cried." ...|$|E

500|$|Ayola's other notable {{television}} appearances {{include the}} BBC psychological thriller Green-Eyed Monster (2001), soap opera EastEnders (2001), Waking the Dead (2001), London's Burning (2001), Offenders (2002), Murder in Mind (2003), The Canterbury Tales (2003) and Sea of Souls (2004). In 2008, she {{starred in the}} Doctor Who episode [...] "Midnight", playing an intergalactic Hostess alongside David Tennant's Tenth Doctor. In 2009, Ayola starred in the CBBC musical comedy My Almost Famous Family. She stated: [...] "The script made me laugh out loud when <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>it.</b> [...] I also {{like the fact that}} there were a lot of correct boxes being ticked, but the writers and producer haven't been restrained by that. [...] "So, instead of bowing to this altar, they've said, 'Okay, we have this family that's half-black, half-white, half-American, half-British. We have a mix of boys and girls, one character who's mixed-raced and deaf – but we're not going to be restrained by any of that. We're not going to tiptoe around Martha's disability or anything.' I liked that. It wasn't some sort of reverential hands-off approach to what we're presenting." [...] She has also been cast in the film Dredd. She will join the cast of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child at the Palace Theatre, London from 24 May 2017, playing the role of Hermione Granger.|$|E
500|$|Before each segment, {{there are}} {{trailers}} advertising fake films, {{as well as}} vintage theater snipes and an ad for a fictional restaurant called Acuña Boys. According to Rodriguez, it was Tarantino's idea to film fake trailers for Grindhouse. [...] "I didn't even know about it until <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>it</b> in the trades. It said something like 'Rodriguez and Tarantino doing a double feature and Tarantino says there's gonna be fake trailers.' And I thought, 'There are?'" [...] Rodriguez and Tarantino had originally planned to make all of the film's fake trailers themselves. According to Rodriguez, [...] "We had so many ideas for trailers. I made Machete. I shot lobby cards and the poster and cut the trailer {{and sent it to}} Quentin, and he just flipped out because it looked so vintage and so real. He started showing it around to Eli Roth and to Edgar Wright, and they said, 'Can we do a trailer? We have an idea for a trailer!' We were like, 'Hey, let them shoot it. If we don't get around to shooting ours, we'll put theirs in the movie. If theirs come out really great, we'll put it in the movie to have some variety.' Then Rob Zombie came up to me in October at the Scream Awards and said, 'I have a trailer: Werewolf Women of the SS.' I said, 'Say no more. Go shoot it. You got me.'" [...] Each trailer was shot in two days. While Wright and Roth shot only what ended up on screen, Zombie shot enough footage to work into a half-hour film and was particularly pained to edit it down. Some Canadian screening releases included the South by Southwest-winning trailer Hobo with a Shotgun.|$|E
