50|$|<b>Direct</b> <b>Chill</b> <b>casting</b> is {{a method}} for the {{fabrication}} of cylindrical or rectangular solid ingots from non-ferrous metals, especially Aluminum, Copper, Magnesium and their alloys. The original ingots are usually further processed by other methods (rolling, forging, etc.).

50|$|Approximately 70 {{percent of}} {{aluminium}} ingots in the U.S. are cast using the <b>direct</b> <b>chill</b> <b>casting</b> process, which reduces cracking. A total of 5 percent of ingots must be scrapped because of stress induced cracks and butt deformation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Direct</b> <b>Chill</b> <b>casting</b> {{operates}} by pouring liquid metal continuously into a short mold (7.5-15 cm deep) {{that is open}} at the bottom. Only {{an outer}} layer of metal solidifies within the water-cooled mold. After leaving the closed mold at its bottom (e.g. with 5-15 cm/min), water is directly sprayed on the new ingot, continuing the solidification until complete. Only about 20% of {{the heat of the}} molten metal is removed through the mold wall, the secondary cooling (Direct Chill) contributing the majority of cooling. Typically the process is started with a starter-dummy block {{at the bottom of the}} mold, and runs until the maximum length possible in the machine is reached (up to 10 m).|$|E
40|$|Abstract. By {{imposing}} a high frequency magnetic field, the surface quality and macro/micro {{structure of the}} <b>direct</b> <b>chill</b> <b>cast</b> billets are improved. The casting speed can also be improved by simultaneous applying mold and electromagnetic coil, especially for the alloys with a wide freezing range such as Al-Cu-Mg alloy. The extent of macrosegregation in the Al-Cu-Mg alloy is reduced by application of the magnetic field. Moreover, the inverse segregation layer usually observed in the <b>direct</b> <b>chill</b> <b>cast</b> billet is eliminated by {{the effect of the}} electromagnetic field. The microstructure of the hot-rolled and heat treated billets cast under the high frequency field also show better characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Aluminium alloys {{that contain}} Si, Mg, Fe, Mn and/or Cu usually contain {{one or more}} types of {{intermetallic}} phases that are not readily distinguishable in the microstructure by conventional microscopy methods.

The pi-AlSiMgFe type intermetallic phase was also observed but its presence was limited. Except for the surface region, no obvious difference was found in the distribution of intermetallics across the billet section.

40|$|Abstract. Effects of low {{frequency}} electromagnetic field on surface quality, microstructure and hot-tearing tendency of <b>direct</b> <b>chill</b> <b>casting</b> of Φ 500 mm ZK 60 magnesium alloy billets were investigated. The {{results show that}} with {{the application of the}} {{low frequency}} electromagnetic field, the surface quality of Φ 500 mm ZK 60 magnesium alloy billets has been markedly improved, and the depth of cold fold is decreased. In the conventional <b>direct</b> <b>chill</b> <b>casting,</b> the microstructures of the billet, especially at the center, are coarse. The distribution of the grain size is non-uniform throughout the billet. From the edge to the center, the microstructure gradually changes from fine to coarse in all billets. However, under the low frequency electromagnetic casting, the microstructures of the billet is significantly refined, the distribution of the grains size is relatively uniform from the billets edge to the billets center. And it also shows that the hot-tearing tendency of <b>direct</b> <b>chill</b> <b>casting</b> Φ 500 mm ZK 60 magnesium alloy billets under low frequency electromagnetic field is significantly reduced...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{fabricate}} high quality aluminium products, it is first essential to produce high quality billets/slabs. One {{of the key}} objectives associated with casting processes {{is to be able}} to control the as-cast structure. A novel <b>direct</b> <b>chill</b> (DC) <b>casting</b> process, the melt conditioned <b>direct</b> <b>chill</b> (MC-DC) <b>casting</b> process, has been developed for production of high quality aluminium billets. In the MC-DC casting process, a high shear device is submerged in the sump of the DC mould to provide intensive melt shearing, which in turn, disperses potential nucleation particles, creates a macroscopic melt flow to uniformly distribute the dispersed particles, and maintains a uniform temperature and chemical composition throughout the melt in the sump. The effect of intensive shearing on the complex microstructure evolution observed after MC-DC is explained on the basis of nucleation and growth behavior. Complete suppression of typical columnar grain growth and significant equiaxed grain refinement is observed. The solidification mechanisms responsible for the significant grain refinement by intensive shearing and the morphological evolution of Mg 2 Si and Fe–containing intermetallic phases are discussed. ...|$|R

In order to identify and prioritise areas in the cast house where greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced {{it is necessary to}} quantify CO 2 e (CO 2 equivalent tonnes) emissions for the various cast house operations. In this study two typical cast house layouts are examined. In one case, 22 kg 99. 85 % aluminium remelt ingots are produced using chain conveyor ingot casting machines.

40|$|International audiencenverse {{methods can}} be used in {{solidification}} and related processes for the estimation of boundary conditions or physical properties of materials. For heat flow problems, these methods are based upon a minimization of the errors between calculated and measured temperatures at given locations and times of the space-time domain, the calculated values being obtained from a numerical solution of the heat flow equation. In the present case, a maximum a posteriori technique has been implemented into a finite element code. This method is then applied to several situations for the determination of: i) the time-dependent heat-transfer coefficient at the surface of a steel rod which has been water-cooled after induction heating (non-stationary situation); ii) the space-dependent heat flow at the surface of a <b>direct</b> <b>chill</b> <b>cast</b> aluminum slab (stationary situation); and iii) the temperature-dependent thermal conductivity of aluminum-silicon alloys.

40|$|This {{research}} {{has been carried out}} to understand the relation between work hard-ening, deformation behaviour, dislocation substructure and crystallographic texture developed during plastic flow in pure Al and continuous <b>cast</b> and <b>direct</b> <b>chill</b> <b>cast</b> AA 5754 AI-Mg alloys. Tensile and strain rate sensitivity tests are performed in the temperature range 4. 2 K- 295 K; details of the process of dislocation accumulation, the dislocation substructure development and texture evolution are followed using a range of techniques such as TEM, in-situ resistivity measurements and X-ray diffraction. The tensile deformation results show an unprecedented level of strength and unusual work hardening behaviour of AI-alloys at 4. 2 K. The electrical resistivity data suggest that fracture is initiated by the collapse of the dislocation network at places where dislocations develop a critical spacing for spontaneous annihilation. This spacing is estimated at approximately 8 nm at 4. 2 K for both pure Al and Al alloys and rv 12 nm at 78 K for pure AI. Strain rate sensitivity measurements suggest that deformation of high purity Al is governed by dislocation-dislocation interactions in a broad rang...|$|R

Semi-continuously direct chill (DC in short) casting {{was carried}} out to modify the size and {{morphology}} of eutectic Si particles in eutectic Al-Si alloy.
