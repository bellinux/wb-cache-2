5|$|Family and <b>family</b> <b>history</b> {{also plays}} an {{important}} role in the poem. Eliot found information on his family from Sketch of the Eliot Family, which described how Eliot's family lived in East Coker for 200 years. When Andrew Eliott left, he disrupted the <b>family</b> <b>history.</b> Similarly, Eliot broke from his own family when he travelled away from his family, a family that he saw was declining. Within the poem, Eliot emphasizes the need for a journey and the need for inward change.|$|E

40|$|Blood {{pressure}} {{and heart rate}} responses to isometric handgrip exercise were studied at age 31 and after 5 years in young nonhypertensive men with positive <b>family</b> <b>histories</b> of hypertension (n= 13) and in those with negative <b>family</b> <b>histories</b> of hypertension (n= 13) for two generations to test whether subjects with positive <b>family</b> <b>histories</b> established a pattern of increased blood {{pressure and}} heart rate responses during the 5 -year follow-up period. At follow-up the response to mental stress (Stroop's color word test) was also studied. Baseline blood pressure and heart rate at rest did not differ, initially or at follow-up, between the groups. At the initial examination, absolute blood pressure levels were significantly higher during isometric handgrip exercise just before exhaustion in subjects with positive <b>family</b> <b>histories.</b> At follow-up the absolute blood pressure level (/»< 0. 01) at follow-up than initially and was significantly related (r= 0. 70, p< 0. 01) to changes in baseline diastolic blood pressure during the follow-up period.

40|$|Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) {{infection}} {{plays an}} important role in the carcinogenesis and development of gastric cancer. Eradication of H. pylori can effectively reduce the risk of gastric cancer, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. This study aimed to investigate the effect of eradication of H. pylori on the expression levels of FHIT, IL- 8 and P 73 in the gastric mucosa of first-degree relatives of gastric cancer patients. One hundred and thirty-two patients with functional dyspepsia having first-degree relatives with gastric cancer were prospectively recruited in this study. Nine patients presented with H. pylori infection and <b>family</b> <b>histories</b> of gastric cancer, 61 with H. pylori infection and without <b>family</b> <b>histories</b> of gastric cancer, 6 without H. pylori infection and with <b>family</b> <b>histories</b> of gastric cancer, and 56 without H. pylori infection and <b>family</b> <b>histories</b> of gastric cancer. The protein and mRNA expression levels of FHIT, IL- 8 and P 73 in gastric mucosa of the subjects were detected by immunohistochemical staining and polymerase chain reaction, respectively. Compared with the patients without H. pylori infection and <b>family</b> <b>histories</b> of gastric cancer, both the protein and mRNA levels of FIHT significantly decreased in patients with H. pylori infection and/or <b>family</b> <b>histories</b> of gastric cancer, and both the protein and mRNA levels of IL- 8 significantly increased. After eradication of H. pylori, both the protein and mRNA levels of FHIT were significantly higher, and both the protein and mRNA levels of IL- 8 were significantly lower. However, H. pylori infection and <b>family</b> <b>histories</b> of gastric cancer had no major effect on P 73 expression. Down-regulation of FHIT and up-regulation of IL- 8 may be involved in the pathogenesis of H. pylori infection in the first-degree relatives of gastric cancer patients...|$|R

HLA-B12, HLA-B51, HLA-Cw7, HLA-A2, HLA-A11, and HLA-DR2 are examples of human leukocyte antigen types associated with aphthous stomatitis. However, these HLA types are inconsistently associated with the condition, and also vary according to ethnicity. People who have a positive <b>family</b> <b>history</b> of aphthous stomatitis tend to develop a more severe form of the condition, and at an earlier age than is typical.|$|E

5|$|The risk of VTE is {{increased}} in pregnancy by {{about five times}} because of a more hypercoagulable state, a likely adaptation against fatal postpartum hemorrhage. Additionally, pregnant women with genetic risk factors are subject to a roughly three to 30 times increased risk for VTE. Preventative treatments for pregnancy-related VTE in hypercoagulable women were suggested by the ACCP. Homozygous carriers of factor V Leiden or prothrombin G20210A with a <b>family</b> <b>history</b> of VTE were suggested for antepartum LMWH and either LMWH or a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) for the six weeks following childbirth. Those with another thrombophilia and a <b>family</b> <b>history</b> but no previous VTE were suggested for watchful waiting during pregnancy and LMWH or—for those without protein C or S deficiency—a VKA. Homozygous carriers of factor V Leiden or prothrombin G20210A with no personal or <b>family</b> <b>history</b> of VTE were suggested for watchful waiting during pregnancy and LMWH or a VKA for six weeks after childbirth. Those with another thrombophilia but no family or personal history of VTE were suggested for watchful waiting only. Warfarin, a common VKA, can cause harm to the fetus and is not used for VTE prevention during pregnancy.|$|E

40|$|Background: Genetic {{predisposition}} is a {{risk factor}} for many chronic diseases, yet {{little is known about the}} frequency in which college students seek out their <b>family</b> health <b>history</b> or with whom they communicate relevant information. Purpose: This study examines motivations and barriers associated with obtaining one’s <b>family</b> health <b>history</b> and discussing it with others. Methods: Data were analyzed from 625 college students using an internet-delivered questionnaire. Questions asked respondents about intentions and motivations to obtain and share <b>family</b> health <b>history</b> as well as barriers encountered in obtaining <b>family</b> health <b>history.</b> Responses were bifurcated by participants’ sex. Chi-squared and t statistics were used to identify response differences by sex. Results: Females were significantly more likely than males to be motivated to obtain their <b>family</b> health <b>history,</b> and more likely to have: shared their <b>family</b> health <b>history</b> with others; state they would share their <b>family</b> health <b>history</b> with others; and express a preference for sharing their <b>family</b> health <b>history</b> with a wider range of people. Discussion: Educational interventions and improved student health services could be effective mechanisms to increase college students’ knowledge, awareness, and perceived importance of obtaining their <b>family</b> health <b>history...</b>|$|R
