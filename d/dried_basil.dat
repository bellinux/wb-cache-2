Four experimental diets were formulated; Diet 1 : control diet (without basil, CTR); Diet 2 : 2 % <b>dried</b> <b>basil</b> leaves, (BL), Diet 3 : 2 % <b>dried</b> <b>basil</b> seeds, (BS) and Diet 4 : 2 % soaked and <b>dried</b> <b>basil</b> seeds, (BSS). Fish were fed experimental diets twice a day until visual apparent satiation, 7 {{days a week for}} 84 days. The results showed an improvement in fish growth and feed utilization indices when fed diets were supplemented either with BS or BSS respectively. Feeding of either BL or BS resulted in an enhancement in protein retention coinciding with depression in lipid content.

30|$|A micro-plot field {{experiment}} {{was conducted in}} loamy soil naturally infested with Meloidogyne spp. to assess the potential of bio-agents namely bio-arc (Bacillus megaterium), nemastrol (a mixture of active ingredients), humisun (humic acid), and <b>dried</b> sweet <b>basil</b> callus to suppress nematodes’ population and induce resistance in sugar beet. Results indicated that integration {{of two or more}} components of such bio-agents gave better results in sugar beet growth parameters than did single ones. Hence, nemastrol and humisun in concomitant with bio-arc, sweet basil callus, and oxamyl (half recommended dose) induced significant (P[*]≤[*] 0.05) and maximum improvement in total plant fresh weight and shoot dry weight. Similar trend was also noticed in root diameter and number of leaves of sugar beet infected with Meloidogyne spp. Additionally, the greatest suppression in nematodes’ population (95.7 %), root galling (83.0 %), and number of egg masses (100 %) was also sustained at the soil amended with nemastrol + humisun + bio-arc + sweet basil callus + oxamyl since incorporation of such organic materials into soil might enhance B. megaterium activity that initiates antibiotics towards nematode population. However, single application of <b>dried</b> sweet <b>basil</b> callus showed better performance than did the dried leaves in terms of female fecundity and total nematodes’ population. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) indicated the presence of higher content of triterpenoides that belong to three groups, i.e., lupane, ursane, and oleanane, in <b>dried</b> sweet <b>basil</b> callus compared to native dried leaves powder. Concomitant treatment with nemastrol + humisun + bio-arc + sweet basil callus + oxamyl exhihited significantly increased in sucrose (17.1 %), total sugar solids (21.8 %), and purity (79.0 %).

Alternative agricultural practices such as aquaponics (includes crop plant and aquatic species) and hydroponics (includes crop plant only) {{have the potential to}} generate high yield per unit area using limited land, water, and no soil. A soilless agricultural study was conducted at the Georgia Southern University, Statesboro, GA, USA from August to November, 2015. The growth, yield, quality, and nutrition of basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) cultivar Aroma 2, were compared between aquaponic and hydroponic systems using crayfish (Procambarus spp.) as the aquatic species. Non-circulating floating raft systems were designed using 95  L polyethylene tanks. Equal amounts of start-up fertilizer dose were applied to both systems. The objective was to understand how the additional nutritional dynamics associated with crayfish influence the basil crop. Both fresh and <b>dry</b> <b>basil</b> plant weights were collected after harvest, followed by leaf nutrient analysis. Leaf chlorophyll content, water pH, nitrogen and temperature were measured periodically. Aquaponic basil (AqB) showed 14 %, 56 %, and 65 % more height, fresh weight, and dry weight, respectively, compared to hydroponic basil (HyB). It is logical to assume that crayfish waste (excreta and unconsumed feed) has supplied the additional nutrients to AqB, resulting in greater growth and yield. The chlorophyll content (plant quality) or leaf nutrients, however, did not differ between AqB and HyB. Further research is needed to investigate aquaponic crayfish yield, overall nutritional dynamics, cost-benefit ratio, and other plant characteristics under soilless systems...|$|R
40|$|This {{experiment}} investigated mineral {{composition of}} 13 basil genotypes (Ocimum spp.) {{in order to}} find varieties supporting human dietary intake of essential minerals and to evaluate basil genotypes which could serve for herbal production as raw material in pharmaceutical or food processing industry. In addition, this study tested a potential risk of the accumulation of heavy metals during the commercial production of basil on agricultural soil. Mineral composition of basil genotypes was found to be in association with its genetic potential, where some of them can be used in human nutrition as an additional source of several minerals, particularly micronutrients (Fe, Mn, Zn), which generally improve human immune system. Iron-rich basil genotypes were identified in this experiment, like Compact (3576. 0 mg/kg), with Lattuga (1585. 6 mg/kg) and Blue spice (1167. 9 mg/kg) genotypes, containing more than 1000 mg/kg of Fe in herbal part on <b>dry</b> <b>basil</b> (d. m.). This attract a special attention as a source of iron, especially for humans with low Fe intake, and consequently, for people with low level of hemoglobin. Basil grown on agricultural soil was tested on the accumulation of heavy metals (Cu, Co, Cu, Ni, Cr, Pb), which were not found to be excessive in herbal parts of the plants. Cluster analysis (CA) distinguished Ocmium spp. genotypes in two separate groups. Despite of significant differences among the genotypes, content of Fe, Mn, Co, Cr, Ni and Pb made a clear distinction between the clusters. [Projekat Ministarstva nauke Republike Srbije, br.

40|$|Basil (Ocimum spp.) is {{a popular}} annual culinary and {{medicinal}} herb contains essential oils. Numerous researchers have studied the effects of fertilizer level on the growth and oil yield of basil, but in most studies, basil was grown in the field during the summer. Our experiment was conducted in a controlled environment greenhouse using a capillary mat system during the winter with a goal of increasing dry weight for fresh produce and basil essential oil. The 7 -month experiment was conducted to determine the optimal production timeline and fertilizer levels for eight basil cultivars grown in a soilless mix. We found that for most sweet basil cultivars (Ocimum basilicum), later harvest led to higher dry weight yield. In most cases, the additional supplement of slow release fertilizer (12 N- 3. 1 P- 14. 9 K: 6 g and 9 g) increased the dry weight yield compared to the control (100 ppm N from 20 N- 4. 4 P- 16. 6 K soluble fertilizer only), {{but there was no}} significant difference between the 2 levels. ‘Mrs. Burns’ Lemon’ (Ocimum basilicum) had the largest flower <b>dry</b> weight. ‘Holy’ <b>basil</b> (Ocimum sanctum) didn’t grow well in the capillary mat system, so tissue culture was thought to be a suitable production method. In this study, 3 media [Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium, Woody Plant medium (WPM), and DKW medium], and 4 treatments of plant growth regulators [the control, 0. 1 mg indole- 3 -butyric acid (IBA) /L, 50 μM thidiazuron (TDZ), 0. 1 mg IBA/L + 50 μM TDZ], were compared to see whether they could be used to grow ‘Holy’ plants successfully. ‘Dolly’, a classic sweet basil cultivar was also tested to see if there was a different effect between basil species. We found that both ‘Holy’ and ‘Dolly’ explants cultured on DKW medium didn’t survive, and the explants cultured on MS medium grew better and had higher fresh and dry weight and heights than those grown on WPM. The explants supplied with TDZ didn’t grow well and had low survival rate while those supplied with nothing or IBA alone grew well. Advisor: Ellen T. Paparozz...|$|R
