25|$|After {{completing}} an Escape section, {{the player}} {{needs to take}} a stance in a moral decision; one such decision involves one character being locked <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>chair</b> with a gun next to it and another character inside an incinerator. To stop the incinerator, the player needs to choose to pull the trigger, which has a 50% possibility of firing a live bullet, killing the character in the chair. The way the decisions are made varies: some involve choosing between options, and some have the player input their own answer.|$|E

500|$|The final music video, [...] "Adam in Chains", was {{directed}} by Julien Temple. It depicted Billy Idol being bound <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>chair</b> as he is monitored by scientists. He struggles before being hypnotised, and is then inserted into a virtual reality simulator. There he is treated to an ethereal water fantasy. Idol eventually rejects the fantasy, which is consumed in flames as, in the real world, his body violently convulses. The scientists end the experiment and Idol is brought back into reality, only to fall unconscious.|$|E
500|$|Everyone who was {{fortunate}} enough to be in the audience agreed that it was the musical event of their lives, and after the performance of the last number there was an ovation to the composer which I have never seen equalled anywhere, the entire audience rose to their feet and shouted with enthusiasm, and probably the calmest man in the whole hall was the composer himself; he bowed repeatedly with that distinction of manner which was so typical of him... As calm as Sibelius had appeared on the stage, after his part was over he came up stairs and sank <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>chair</b> in one of the dressing rooms and was very much overcome. Some people declared that he wept. Personally I do not think that he did, but there were tears in his eyes as he shook our hands and thanked us for what he was pleased to call the [...] "honor we had done him".|$|E

After bringing the Ancestors into harmony, the Stranger discovers the combination to Sirrus' color-code lock. Returning to the [...] "waking world" [...] and entering the old Memory Chamber, the Stranger finds Yeesha strapped <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>chair,</b> and she begs to be released from it with a silver lever. At that moment, Achenar arrives with a crossbow and the Life Stone, and warns that Sirrus used the Memory Chamber to remove Yeesha's memories and transfer his own into her body; Achenar points to an amber lever, which will reverse the mind-transfer.|$|E

[...] The executioner activates a mechanism which drops potassium cyanide (or sodium cyanide) pellets into a bath of sulfuric acid beneath the chair; the ensuing chemical reaction generates lethal hydrogen cyanide gas. [...] Because hydrogen cyanide gas condenses at approximately 78°F (26°C), the temperature in the chamber (when it is in use) is maintained at at least 80°F (27°C).|$|E

2500|$|Its setlist was {{composed}} of {{a wide array of}} Jackson's discography, focusing on new material in addition to medleys of previous hits. The tour is divided into five segments, each displaying different themes and settings. In “What About”, Its racy visuals and depictions of violence drew controversy. In her rendition of [...] "Rope Burn", Jackson selects a fan from the audience, performing a lap dance and kissing them while strapped <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>chair.</b> The show's suggestive promotional ads were banned from a number of publications, the image was reported to cause traffic accidents in Europe. A number of reviews commended Jackson's stage presence as consistently exceptional, noting improvement in her vocal delivery.

2500|$|The {{early part}} of the 18th century was still {{characterized}} by the combination of Lutheran orthodoxy and classical philology of the previous century, but eventually a larger emphasis on sciences and practically useful knowledge developed. The innovative mathematician and physicist Samuel Klingenstierna (1698–1765) was made a professor in 1728, the physicist and astronomer Anders Celsius in 1729, and Carl Linnaeus was made professor of Medicine with Botany in 1741. The university was not immune to the parliamentary struggle between the parties known as the [...] "Hats" [...] and the [...] "Caps", with the former having a preference for hard sciences and practical knowledge. The Hat government then in power established a chair in economics (Œconomia publica) in 1741 and called Anders Berch as its first incumbent. This was the first professorship in economics outside Germany, and possibly the third in Europe (the first chairs having been established in Halle and Frankfurt (Oder) in 1727). In 1759, following a donation, another chair in economy was established, the Borgströmian professorship in [...] "practical economy", by which was meant the practical application of the natural sciences for economic purposes (it eventually developed <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>chair</b> for physiological botany).|$|E
2500|$|Smailey {{says he has}} {{no desire}} to be hard on her, but that [...] "it is a fraud". Ruth points out he was guilty of fraud, and she has {{evidence}} to prove it. Smailey tries to buy it from her, but she's respectable now: She won't take his money, though she keeps the papers as she [...] "ain't a fool"; Smailey leaves. Fitz-Partington interviews Ruth, to her confusion. Mrs. Van Brugh re-enters, and Fitz-Partington warns her about Smailey, explaining that his detective agency was called on to find out about Smailey's fraud, but as Smailey then hired him to investigate Mrs. Van Brugh, they had combined the cases. However, Fitz-Partington goes on to ask several further questions about Mrs. Van Brugh's marriage, and she begins to realise what Smailey is looking for: if Mrs. Van Brugh's godfather had called her Captain Van Brugh's wife in his will, her secret might be revealed. Smailey returns with the will, and reads out the relevant section about the farm, ending with the section referring to her as [...] "Catherine Ellen, wife of Captain Richard Van Brugh." [...] She faints <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>chair.</b>|$|E

She chases the Snow Queen (Elizabeth Mitchell) and demands to know why she is being followed, but the Snow Queen vanishes. Belle calls Emma and tells her to meet her at the library because there is a situation. [...] Will Scarlet is seen in the library next to a bottle of alcohol and a copy of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. [...] Mr. Gold finds Hook {{sleeping}} on the docks and wakes him. He produces a broom and tells Hook it is going to help him find an old friend. [...] When Mr. Gold lets go of the broom it begins walking off and he tells Hook to follow it. [...] Mr. Gold and Hook arrive at a red house in town and knock on the door. [...] The Storybrooke version of the Apprentice answers the door and Mr. Gold tells Hook to force him <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>chair.</b> [...] Mr. Gold then opens the box and produces the hat. The Apprentice tells Mr. Gold that no Dark One ever succeeds with the hat, stating that he will never have enough power to use it. Mr. Gold then uses the hat to pull the man into the hat and increase its power.|$|E
2500|$|The set {{transitions}} into a [...] "steamy burlesque house" [...] with {{a succession}} of [...] "Alright", [...] "I Get Lonely", and instrumental interlude of [...] "Any Time, Any Place." [...] Jackson strips to a black bra and tight pants during [...] "Rope Burn", selecting a participant from the crowd at random, [...] "pointing and demanding, [...] "You!". The chosen fan is strapped <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>chair</b> as Jackson proceeds to pole dance and perform a striptease and lap dance, planting {{a kiss on the}} fan for the finale. [...] "Black Cat" [...] is followed by an emotionally charged rendition of the rock-influenced [...] "What About", one of the tour's most controversial and praised renditions. Jackson narrates as four dancers demonstrate two vignettes of domestic violence in abusive relationships, including rape and physical abuse, concluding in a gun pulled on the abusers in self-defense. Proceeding is [...] "Rhythm Nation", in which Jackson rapidly dances using martial arts movements and nunchucks, followed by the ballad [...] "Special." [...] The tour's encore includes chandeliers and a final outfit change, performing [...] "That's the Way Love Goes", [...] "Got 'til It's Gone", and [...] "Go Deep" [...] before concluding with [...] "Together Again." [...] Piano ballad [...] "Every Time" [...] and [...] "Whoops Now" [...] were performed exclusively on selected international dates.|$|E
