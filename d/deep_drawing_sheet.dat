40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the technical {{development of the}} laser welding process and presents the results {{from a number of}} experimental investigations. The seven papers that make up the thesis investigate various aspects of the technical development of the laser welding process mechanism as well as industrial applications. The thesis provides an introduction to the subject of CO 2 laser welding. The mechanism and techniques of the process are analysed and the future commercial growth of the subject is discussed. An investigation of laser welding of construction steels used in the heavy mechanical industries is presented. The results include welding parameters for high power lasers up to 17 kW, weld metallurgy and static and dynamic weld strength of test specimens. Also components designed for laser welding were tested. An investigation of the effect of plasma control on porosity levels when welding zinc-coated steel is is presented including the reduction of plasma production by using a pulsed laser beam. Laser welding of <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>sheet</b> steel has been performed with simultaneous feeding of iron powder into a butt joint. A new method using a magnetic field to feed the powder into the joint gap has been developed. A continuous wave Nd:YAG-laser was used to weld sheet metal parts with very high demands on the weld geometry and quality. Examples include applications from the aircraft and aerospace industry. To achieve improved weld geometry and to reduce the probability of porosity formation, a dual-focusing optic was designed and successfully tested. Fatigue tests were carried out on thin section stainless steel lap welds produced by Nd:YAG-laser. Analysis of the fatigue tests results and the fracture surfaces identified sheet thickness and inter sheet gaps as having considerable effect on fatigue life. Weld width has a more moderate influence on fatigue life and weld porosity has a negligible effect at low concentrations. Three metals with different thermal properties were welded under similar conditions by Nd:YAG and CO 2 lasers. The Nd:YAG laser was found to give superior welding performance. The welding process efficiency was found to be affected by four material properties: the specific heat, the density, the melting point and the keyhole absorption.

40|$|Zinc {{coated steel}} is an {{attractive}} material for the manufacture of automotive body panels due to its excellent corrosion resistance and good weldability. It does however pose problems during sheet metal forming operations due to zinc pick-up on the die surfaces which changes the original forming characteristics of the part and increases maintenance of the die. The hypothesis presented {{here is that the}} severity of the problem may be reduced through surface engineering of the critical areas of the die so as to modify the frictional and chemical properties of the die surface. The critical area of the die to be investigated is the drawbead region. Drawbeads are added to <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>sheet</b> metal forming dies to control the flow of metal into the die to eliminate wrinkling. The surface engineering involved coating experimental drawbeads with thin, hard coatings of TiN, TiCN and TiC using filtered arc physical vapour deposition. Uncoated Steel drawbeads of varying hardness were also investigated. Frictional forces of the drawbeads were determined using a Drawbead Simulation Test. Zinc pick-up on the drawbeads was assessed through ICP analysis. All results were correlated with hardness, roughness and chemistry of the drawbead surface. Hardening and polishing the surface of the uncoated steel drawbead reduces the average coefficient of friction between the sheet and the bead. Over time however as more sheets are drawn, a steady increase in friction coefficient occurs. Changing the surface chemistry of the drawbead by coating not only reduces the average coefficient of friction but also acts to reduce friction as more sheets are drawn. Thus, the minimisation of zinc pick-up when using galvanneal steel depends on a complex interaction between increasing die surface hardness, decreasing die surface roughness and changing die surface chemistry in the regions of high forming forces (i. e. the drawbead). Thin, hard, smooth ceramic-like coatings of alloy carbides (in particular) and alloy nitrides deposited onto the drawbead section of sheet metal forming dies effectively reduced the coefficient of friction between the die and galvanneal sheet. The reduction in the friction contribution of the forming forces in the drawbead region assists in maintaining forming characteristics of the die and may also assist in reducing the powder/flaking of the zinc-alloy coated sheet. The hardness of the coated drawbead together with the reduced affinity between the carbides and nitrides in the drawbead coating and the Fe in the zinc-alloy coating also reduced the amount of zinc-alloy pick-up...|$|E

The paper {{proposes a}} hyperelasticity-based concept of finite strain {{plasticity}} with combined hardening using evolving structure tensors {{to represent the}} evolution of elastic and plastic anisotropy in the material. By defining the Helmholtz free energy density and the yield surface as functions of the evolving structure tensors, {{we are able to}} describe both evolving elastic and plastic anisotropy, respectively. The model considers also nonlinear kinematic and isotropic hardening and is derived from a thermodynamic framework based on the multiplicative split of the deformation gradient. The kinematic hardening component represents a continuum extension of the classical rheological model of Armstrong-Frederick kinematic hardening. Exploiting the dissipation inequality leads to the important result that the model includes only symmetric tensor-valued internal variables. Evolution of elastic and plastic anisotropy is numerically investigated by means of simulations of cylindrical <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> of metal <b>sheets</b> and thermoforming of thermoplastic polymer blends...|$|R
