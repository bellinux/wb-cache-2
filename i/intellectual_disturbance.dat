Neurosurgical treatment, {{in some of}} these patients in combination with external radiotherapy, results in a fair prognosis for children with craniopharyngioma. However, the central localisation of this tumour in the brain, damage of surrounding structures due to tumour growth, as well as the adverse effects of treatment will result in substantial morbidity in many patients. The first patient, a 13 -year-old boy, presented with symptoms and signs of increased intracranial pressure. Following operation he was treated with radiotherapy, and up to 4 years after the operation there was no tumour recurrence. However, he experienced endocrine, visual, hypothalamic and <b>intellectual</b> <b>disturbances</b> due to the disease and its treatment. The second patient, a 6 -year-old girl, presented with hydrocephalus due to the tumour, but also had growth retardation. After operation and radiotherapy, she had visual, endocrine, and intellectual dysfunction, but there were no signs of tumor recurrence.

40|$|Psychoanalytic {{characterology}} {{posits that}} distinctive traits which {{are associated with}} conflicts in various impulse areas will be manifest in extreme degrees when the conflict is inadequately resolved. 48 Ss performed a hand-eye coordination task (action test) in an odorous dirty medium reminiscent of fecal matter. Poor performance of this task was taken as an index of ineffective defenses against anal impulses. It was predicted that indecisiveness and narrow intellectualism {{would be associated with}} ineffective defenses. Ss with unsuccessful action tests showed slower decision making and a selective sensitivity for anal concepts. Questionnaire study indicated that they also profess greater discomfort in areas which are characteristically troublesome for anal personalities. Psychoanalytic study of individuals with prominent fixations on the anal stage of psychosexual development has yielded the impression that their characteristic defense tactics frequently result in an intellectualized approach to life problems, emotional issues, and interpersonal relationships. It seems, furthermore, that while the mere presence of anal fixations may lead to a sound, creative, and subtle intellectual mentality, the latter may decompensate into an <b>intellectual</b> <b>disturbance</b> marked by emptiness, ritualism, and pedantry, when defensive efforts are weakened or impulses gain in strength. This has been observed in adolescents in particular (A. Freud, 1936). A second normal compulsive trait often discerned in anally fixated people is that of cool and impassive deliberateness in taking action and in making decisions. Its pathological extreme are the paralyzing doubt and indecisiveness resulting from decompensated or overly rigid defenses against anal impulses. Normal intellectuality and deliberateness are usually ego-syntonic and adaptive personality traits, whereas their pathological extremes are often experienced iThis investigation has been aided by a gran...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{characterize}} the memory dysfunction of schizophrenic patients.

40|$|The main aim of {{the present}} study was two-wise: first, to assess the {{presence}} of behavioral and <b>intellectual</b> <b>disturbances</b> in high-risk 7 -year-old children, compared to healthy controls; and, second, and most importantly, to evaluate the discriminative validity of a motor impulsivity neuropsychological task (Go/No-go) as an indicator of daily-life socioemotional adjustment. We administered the Behavior Assessment Scale for Children (BASC), the Weschler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISCIV), and the Go/No-go task to 14 high-risk 7 year-olds and 20 matched healthy controls. High-risk children had been classified as so shortly after birth, due to the presence of perinatal risk factors, and later released from the early care unit. They are currently schooled according to their age. We expected performance in the Go/No-go task to be a good indicator of behavioral disturbances in high-risk children, and more specifically of those related to socioemotional adjustment. Accordingly to such a hypothesis, high-risk children showed significantly worse scores in most BASC and WISC subscales, and committed more commission and omission errors on the Go/No-go task. Most importantly, regression analyses showed that performance on the Go/No-go task (but not WISC scores) was an independent indicator of socioemotional adjustment problems. This result is in accordance with proposals that motor impulsivity is an important mediator between altered executive function development and socioemotional adjustment...|$|R
60|$|From {{the very}} beginning, therefore, Burke {{was drawn to}} the deepest of all the {{currents}} in the thought of the eighteenth century. Johnson and Goldsmith continued the traditions of social and polite literature which had been established by the Queen Anne men. Warburton and a whole host of apologists carried on the battle against deism and infidelity. Hume, after furnishing the arsenal of scepticism with a new array of deadlier engines and more abundant ammunition, had betaken himself placidly to the composition of history. What is remarkable in Burke's first performance is his discernment of the important fact, that behind the <b>intellectual</b> <b>disturbances</b> in the sphere of philosophy, and the noisier agitations in the sphere of theology, there silently stalked a force that might shake the whole fabric of civil society itself. In France, as all students of its speculative history are agreed, there came a time in the eighteenth century when theological controversy was turned into political controversy. Innovators left the question about the truth of Christianity, and busied themselves with questions about the ends and means of governments. The appearance of Burke's Vindication of Natural Society coincides in time with the beginning of this important transformation. Burke foresaw from the first what, if rationalism were allowed to run an unimpeded course, would be the really great business of the second halt of his century.|$|R

40|$|The neuropsychological {{records of}} 56 {{patients}} operated for clipping were studied. Almost every patient remained autonomous and without invalidating motor defect. The {{present study was}} aimed at specifying the type and frequency of neuropsychological sequelae and, to a lesser extent, the role of various pathophysiological factors. A main concern was to examine to what extent and at what post-operative interval the neuropsychological assessment can predict the intellectual and socioprofessional outcome of each individual patient. The neuropsychological assessment performed beyond the acute phase showed evidence of intellectual sequelae in about {{two thirds of the}} patients. Only one case of permanent anterograde amnesia was observed, probably due to unavoidable inclusion of a hypothalamic artery in the clip during surgery. Transient anterograde amnesia and confabulations were occasionally observed, generally for less than three weeks. A common finding was impaired performance on memory and/or executive tests. In a minority of patients, language disorders, visuoperceptive and visuoconstructive disabilities were found, probably in relation with hemodynamic changes at distance from the aneurysm. Global impairment of intellectual function was not uncommon in the acute post-operative phase but it evolved in most cases towards a more selective impairment, for instance restricted to executive and memory functions, in the chronic phase. The neuropsychological investigation carried out 4 to 15 weeks post-operatively provided satisfactory information about possible long-lasting <b>intellectual</b> <b>disturbances</b> and professional resumption. In particular, persistent global intellectual impairment, persistent amnesia and confabulations 4 - 15 weeks post-operative were associated with cessation of professional activity; executive and memory impairment, behavioral disturbances such as those encountered in patients with frontal lobe damage were associated with a decreased probability of full-time employment. Pre- and post-operative angiography were not good predictors of long-term cognitive outcome: normal angiography was not necessarily followed by normal neuropsychological outcome, conversely abnormal angiography could be found together with normal neuropsychological outcome. By contrast, there was a relationship between left-lateralised abnormalities on post-operative angiography and occurrence of language disorders; similarly, there was a relationship between side of craniotomy and type of deficits, that is language disorders versus visuoperceptive-visuoconstructive impairments...|$|R

40|$|The term {{dementia}} {{refers to}} a clinical syndrome of acquired <b>intellectual</b> <b>disturbances</b> produced by brain dysfunction. Dementia may result {{from a wide variety}} of disorders, including degenerative (e. g. Alzheimer's disease, AD), vascular (e. g. multi-infarct dementia), and traumatic (e. g. head injury). Long-term abuse of alcohol is related to the development of the Wernicke-Korsakoff's syndrome or alcohol dementia. However, light to moderate alcohol intake might also reduce the risk of dementia and AD. In Bordeaux (France), a population-based prospective study found that subjects drinking 3 to 4 standard glasses of wine per day (> 250 and up to 500 ml), categorized as moderate drinkers, the crude odds ratio (OR) was 0. 18 for incident dementia (p < 0. 01) and 0. 25 for Alzheimer's disease (p < 0. 03), as compared to the non-drinkers. After adjusting for age, sex, education, occupation, baseline cognitive performances and other possible confounders, the ORs were respectively 0. 19 (p < 0. 01) and 0. 28 (p < 0. 05). In the 922 mild drinkers (< 1 to 2 glasses per day) there was a negative association only with AD, after adjustment (OR = 0. 55; p < 0. 05). The inverse relationship between moderate wine drinking and incident dementia was explained neither by known predictors of dementia nor by medical, psychological or socio-familial factors. These results were confirmed from data of the Rotterdam study. Light-to-moderate drinking (one to three drinks per day) was significantly associated with a lower risk of any dementia (hazard ratio 0. 58 [95 % CI 0. 38 - 0. 90]) and vascular dementia (hazard ratio 0. 29 [0. 09 - 0. 93]). No evidence that the relation between alcohol and dementia varied by type of alcoholic beverage was found. Stroke constitutes one of the most common causes of serious functional impairment in developed countries. Ischaemic strokes represent about 80 % of all strokes. Several studies have been published and the overall conclusion is that heavy drinking is a risk factor for most stroke subtypes. Regular light to moderate drinking seemed to be associated with a decreased risk for ischaemic stroke...|$|R

40|$|Meningitis is an {{inflammation}} of the meninges, the membranes that cover the central nervous system. The most frequent causes of the disease are viruses and bacteria. In the past, the disease was {{commonly referred to as}} “brain fever” or “brain inflammation,” and extreme temperatures, sun, rain, mental distress, and other factors were believed to be its potent triggers. By {{the beginning of the twentieth}} century, these beliefs faded away in the United States and most western European countries. In contrast, some of these archaic notions persist in Russia, where cold air, draft, wet hair, and failure to cover one 2 ̆ 7 s head with a hat during winter are perceived as serious risks for contracting meningitis. These sentiments are reflected in the prose of Solzhenitsyn and other contemporary Russian authors. However, in the fictional literature of the nineteenth century, emotional or <b>intellectual</b> <b>disturbances</b> rather than the wrath of winter were portrayed worldwide as the most frequent cause of brain inflammation. Both physicians and laity blamed nervous breakdown or mental distress for the development of meningitis and the tragic deaths of the eminent Russian writer Gogol, talented poet Nadson, and heir to the Imperial throne Grand Duke Nicholas Romanov. Even in the twentieth century, esteemed Russian artists, including Pasternak, Paustovsky, and Roerich, highlighted this belief. Following the discovery of the infectious nature of meningitis, fictional depictions of the illness changed. While literary accounts of brain inflammation by the realists (e. g., Dostoevsky and Flaubert) were rather imprecise, the descriptions of the course and symptoms of meningitis by the modernists (e. g., Balmont, Hesse, and Huxley) became detailed and recognizable. Typically, the victim of the disease is a boy, and his imminent agony is preceded by immense suffering that devastates his parents. The dreadful experience of seeing children in the merciless clutches of meningitis had a profound personal effect on Maugham, Twain, and Russian philosopher Tikhomirov, changing their spiritual convictions. However, several authors, among them Avseenko, Davydov, Gazdanov, and Shmelyov, created uplifting stories of survival of the affliction. In this chapter, references to meningitis in the medical and fictional literature are explored through a cultural and historical prism, which may help readers to understand how and why this disease has held a special significance in the Russian psyche.

Profound morbidity often accompanies a common and severe seizure type, the drop attack. Seizures often remain refractory, or initial treatment efficacy fades. Few individuals are seizure free despite {{the development of}} multiple generations of antiseizure medications over decades and high-level evidence on several choices. Approved medications such as lamotrigine, topiramate, rufinamide, felbamate and clobazam have demonstrated efficacy in reducing seizure burden. Cannabidiol {{has emerged as a}} promising investigational therapy with vast social interest yet lacks a standard, approved formulation. Palliative surgical procedures, such as vagal nerve stimulation and corpus callosotomy may provide reduction in total seizures and drop attacks. Emerging evidence suggests that complete callosotomy provides greater improvement in seizures without additional side effects.

The neuropsychiatric disturbances associated with TBI include cognitive impairments, mood disorders, anxiety disorder, psychosis, and behavioral problems. This article will provide an overview of the common neuropsychiatric sequelae of TBI along with a guide to the assessment and treatment of these conditions. The primary goal of this review is to demonstrate the link between psychiatry and TBI. We will summarize the epidemiology, risk factors, classification, and mechanism of brain injury after TBI. Next, a description of the various neuropsychiatric disorders associated with TBI will be provided. Finally, a brief discussion of pharmacological treatment in TBI will be outlined, followed by concluding remarks...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of non-reading language ability was {{studied in the}} context of estimating premorbid IQ among normal elderly individuals. Non-reading language performance was measured by the Controlled Oral Word Association (COWA) Test and the Animal Naming (AN) Test. Non-reading language disturbances were divided into three levels (i. e., no disturbance on COWA and AN, either COWA or AN disturbance, and both COWA and AN <b>disturbances).</b> <b>Intellectual</b> ability was primarily measured by the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI). Additionally, reading measures such as the New Adult Reading Test- Revised (NART-R) and the Wide Range Achievement Test- Fourth Edition (WRAT- 4) Word Reading subtest were used to predict premorbid intellectual ability. Results indicated that the scores on the WASI Full Scale IQ (FSIQ), NART-R estimated FSIQ, and WRAT- 4 Word Reading subtest decreased when the severity of the non-reading language disturbances increased. Results also suggested that non-reading language performance did not predict intellectual ability across the three levels of disturbances. Instead, the NART-R was found to account for more variance in WASI FSIQ scores when there were no non-reading language disturbances (83. 4 %) and COWA or AN disturbance (52. 4 %). The WRAT- 4 Word Reading subtest was found to account for more variance (84. 1 %) in WASI FSIQ scores when there were disturbances on both COWA and AN. Limitations of the study, directions for future research, and diversity issues were also addressed...|$|R
40|$|Smith-Magenis {{syndrome}} (SMS) is {{a complex}} syndrome involving <b>intellectual</b> disabilities, sleep <b>disturbance,</b> behavioural problems, {{and a variety of}} craniofacial, skeletal, and visceral anomalies. While the majority of SMS cases harbor an ~ 3. 5 Mb common deletion on 17 p 11. 2 that encompasses the retinoic acid induced- 1 (RAI 1) gene, some patients carry small intragenic deletions or point mutations in RAI 1. We present data on two cases of Smith-Magenis syndrome with mutation of RAI 1. Both cases are phenotypically consistent with SMS and RAI 1 mutation but also have other anomalies not previously reported in SMS, including spontaneous pneumothoraces. These cases also illustrate variability in the SMS phenotype not previously shown for RAI 1 mutation cases, including hearing loss, absence of self-abusive behaviours, and mild global delays. Sequencing of RAI 1 revealed mutation of the same heptameric C-tract (CCCCCCC) in exon 3 in both cases (c. 3103 delC one case and and c. 3103 insC in the other), resulting in frameshift mutations. Of the seven reported frameshift mutations occurring in poly C-tracts in RAI 1, four cases (~ 57 %) occur at this heptameric C-tract. Collectively, these results indicate that this heptameric C-tract is a preferential hotspot for single nucleotide insertion/deletions (SNindels) and therefore, should be considered a primary target for analysis in patients suspected for mutations in RAI 1. We expect that as more patients are sequenced for mutations in RAI 1, the incidence of frameshift mutations in this hotspot will become more evident...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is an {{autosomal}} recessive lipid storage disorder {{characterized by a}} heterogeneous presentation and {{a broad spectrum of}} clinical manifestations. Since early diagnosis and replacement therapy with chenodeoxycholic acid can prevent clinical deterioration, our aim was to develop a diagnostic tool to identify and treat CTX patients at an initial stage of the disease. METHODS: We devised a suspicion index, composed of weighted scores assigned to indicators such as family history characteristics and common systemic and neurological features, {{on the basis of a}} pooled analysis of selected international CTX series. The indicators were classified as very strong (score 100), strong (50) or moderate (25). The suspicion index was then applied retrospectively to our CTX population. RESULTS: Early systemic signs such as cataract, diarrhea and neonatal cholestatic jaundice were considered strong indicators, together with neurological features such as <b>intellectual</b> impairment, psychiatric <b>disturbances,</b> ataxia, spastic paraparesis and dentate nuclei abnormalities at MRI. Tendon xanthomas were regarded as very strong indicators, as was an affected sibling. A total score[*]≥[*] 100 warranted serum cholestanol assessment. Elevated cholestanol or a total score[*]≥[*] 200, with one very strong or four strong indicators, warranted CYP 27 A 1 gene analysis. In our patients, age at diagnosis was 35. 5 [*]±[*] 11. 8 years (mean ± standard deviation), whereas with the diagnostic tool it became 10. 6 [*]±[*] 9. 8 years (p[*]<[*] 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS: Our suspicion index provides a simple and inexpensive diagnostic tool allowing diagnosis and treatment of CTX before neurological disability occurs...|$|R
