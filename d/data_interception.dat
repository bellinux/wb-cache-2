50|$|The tools {{used by the}} Iranian {{authorities}} to monitor and control the Internet include <b>data</b> <b>interception</b> tools capable of Deep Packet Inspection. Interception products from leading Chinese companies such as ZTE and Huawei are in use. The products provided by Huawei to Mobin Net, the leading national provider of mobile broadband, {{can be used to}} analyze email content, track browsing history and block access to sites. The products that ZTA sold to the Telecommunication Company of Iran (TCI) offer similar services plus the possibility of monitoring the mobile network. European companies are the source of other spying and data analysis tools. Products designed by Ericsson and Nokia Siemens Networks (later Trovicor) are in use. These companies sold SMS interception and user location products to Mobile Communication Company of Iran and Irancell, Iran’s two biggest mobile phone companies, in 2009 and they were used to identify Iranian citizens during the post-election uprising in 2009. The use of Israeli surveillance devices has also been detected in Iran. The network traffic management and surveillance device NetEnforcer was provided by Israel to Denmark and then resold to Iran. Similarly, US equipment has found its way to Iran via the Chinese company ZTE.|$|E

30|$|Our {{analysis}} shows this linear relationship {{holds true for}} a number of different correlations. First, experiment in Section 5.1 and a subsequent correlation analysis demonstrate that there is an approximately linear mapping relationship between MGS fragment coding bit rate and percentage of fragment quality in quality increments. Thus, payload <b>data</b> <b>interception</b> due to sub-stream extraction results in a mainly linear descending bit rate. Second, the sub-stream and the actual coding have the same NALUs and similar bit rate sizes for their respective NAL headers. Finally, as the percentage of fragment quality in quality increments increases, the error drift that results due to inter-frame prediction will also increase in a linear fashion.|$|E

30|$|RF 4 CE {{can provide}} the basic {{security}} functionalities such as frame encryption and data authentication in MAC layer because {{it is based on}} IEEE 802.15. 4 specification. In the network layer of RF 4 CE, it first generates 128 bits link encryption key and stores the key in the pairing table after finishing the pairing process, and then the encryption key is utilized for secure data transmission. In the process of distributing the key seeds, it establishes secure channel between nodes. At this time, a controller and target node first performs the pairing process, and then checks the security capability option of the pairing request node. In case the correspondent node supports the security function, a key seed distribution process is performed. During the key seed distribution, the key seed values of the maximum n are delivered to a controller and then the same secret key is generated in an end-to-end. At this time, the maximum n of the transmitted key seed value is 255. In each node, the key seed value is reassembled through the XOR operation and then generates the link encryption key [6, 7, 12, 14]. However, the key seed values have the vulnerabilities such as <b>data</b> <b>interception,</b> masquerading, and denial-of-service by the third party as well as MITM attack because of being transmitted to the plaintext state without providing an encryption or any security functions. Therefore, the key seed wiretapping by malicious users should be fundamentally prevented, and a solution for forgery of seed value itself and a sequence number of a key seed frame is required, too. In order to prevent DoS attack, it is necessary to support tolerant and resilient capability to prepare for interrupting the normal key seed distribution and secret key generation. There is the protection method of the key seed value through an encryption by using a predistributed master key as a simple solution for solving this problem between nodes. However, there remains still security issues like a node capture and distribution the master key safely.|$|E
40|$|A sensor {{integrated}} “intelligent” diamond {{grinding wheel}} {{was designed and}} developed for in-process monitoring of ceramic grinding processes. The system is capable of monitoring normal force, acoustic emission, gap elimination and wheel rounding process in real-time. The prototype wheel consisted of an aluminum core integrated with piezo-ceramic sensors and diamond abrasive segments bonded on the periphery. A DSP based telemetric data acquisition was employed to acquire, process and transmit data from the rotating wheel to a remote receiver. Software was developed for <b>data</b> <b>interception,</b> processing and presentation of process information. ^ The mechanical design of the “intelligent” grinding wheel was evaluated both by numerical simulations and static experiments. Prior to system integration, experiments were conducted on each sub-component of the system to ascertain its performance and mechanical integrity. The capabilities of the “intelligent” grinding wheel was verified through grinding and wheel preparation experiments. The DSP was programmed to implement application specific algorithms for process monitoring. Wheel roundness during truing was monitored by comparing the outputs from all eleven force sensors located on the outer periphery of the wheel. Normal force monitored by the “intelligent” grinding wheel showed a close match with that measured by a commercial dynamometer. Furthermore, it was shown that acoustic emission signal monitored by this system can identify Wheel-workpiece contact, thereby serving as useful gap elimination tool. In addition, it was demonstrated that the acoustic signal is sensitive to grinding parameters and can provide corroborative evidence to normal force measurements. Finally, the “intelligent” grinding wheel was used to study contact length and normal force distribution in the grinding zone. ^ The prototype wheel used diamond abrasives for grinding of ceramic components. This same approach can also be applied to CBN wheels for grinding of ferrous and nickel based alloys. The results of this investigation provide the scientific and technological basis for commercial {{development of a new}} generation of monitoring systems for machining. ...|$|E

40|$|Due to the {{broadcast}} nature of radio propagation, the wireless air interface is open and accessible to both authorized and illegitimate users. This completely differs from a wired network, where communicating devices are physically connected through cables and a node without direct association is unable to access the network for illicit activities. The open communications environment makes wireless transmissions more vulnerable than wired communications to malicious attacks, including both the passive eavesdropping for <b>data</b> <b>interception</b> and the active jamming for disrupting legitimate transmissions. Therefore, this paper is motivated to examine the security vulnerabilities and threats imposed by the inherent open nature of wireless communications and to devise efficient defense mechanisms for improving the wireless network security. We first summarize the security requirements of wireless networks, including their authenticity, confidentiality, integrity, and availability issues. Next, a comprehensive overview of security attacks encountered in wireless networks is presented {{in view of the}} network protocol architecture, where the potential security threats are discussed at each protocol layer. We also provide a survey of the existing security protocols and algorithms that are adopted in the existing wireless network standards, such as the Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, WiMAX, and the long-term evolution (LTE) systems. Then, we discuss {{the state of the art}} in physical-layer security, which is an emerging technique of securing the open communications environment against eavesdropping attacks at the physical layer. Several physical-layer security techniques are reviewed and compared, including information-theoretic security, artificial-noise-aided security, security-oriented beamforming, diversity-assisted security, and physical-layer key generation approaches. Since a jammer emitting radio signals can readily interfere with the legitimate wireless users, we also introduce the fam- ly of various jamming attacks and their countermeasures, including the constant jammer, intermittent jammer, reactive jammer, adaptive jammer, and intelligent jammer. Additionally, we discuss the integration of physical-layer security into existing authentication and cryptography mechanisms for further securing wireless networks. Finally, some technical challenges which remain unresolved at the time of writing are summarized and the future trends in wireless security are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Evaporation of {{rainfall}} intercepted by tree canopies is usually {{an important part}} of the overall water balance of forested catchments and there have been many studies dedicated to measuring and modelling rainfall interception loss. These studies have mainly been conducted in dense forests; there have been few studies on the very sparse forests which are common in dry and semi-arid areas. Water resources are scarce in these areas making sparse forests particularly important. Methods for modelling interception loss are thus required to support sustainable water management in those areas. In very sparse forests, trees occur as widely spaced individuals rather than as a continuous forest canopy. We therefore suggest that interception loss for this vegetation type can be more adequately modelled if the overall forest evaporation is derived by scaling up the evaporation from individual trees. The evaporation rate for a single tree can be estimated using a simple Dalton-type diffusion equation for water vapour as long as its surface temperature is known. From theory, this temperature is shown to be dependent upon the available energy and windspeed. However, the surface temperature of a fully saturated tree crown, under rainy conditions, should approach the wet bulb temperature as the radiative energy input to the tree reduces to zero. This was experimentally confirmed from measurements of the radiation balance and surface temperature of an isolated tree crown. Thus, evaporation of intercepted rainfall can be estimated using an equation which only requires knowledge of the air dry and wet bulb temperatures and of the bulk tree-crown aerodynamic conductance. This was taken as the basis of a new approach for modelling interception loss from savanna-type woodland, i. e. by combining the Dalton-type equation with the Gash’s analytical model to estimate interception loss from isolated trees. This modelling approach was tested using data from two Mediterranean savanna-type oak woodlands in southern Portugal. For both sites, simulated interception loss agreed well with the observations indicating the adequacy of this new methodology for modelling interception loss by isolated trees in savanna-type ecosystems. Furthermore, the proposed approach is physically based and requires only a limited amount of <b>data.</b> <b>Interception</b> loss for the entire forest can be estimated by scaling up the evaporation from individual trees accounting for the number of trees per unit area...|$|E
40|$|While {{working with}} the {{information}} and communication technology we are being exposed {{to a number of}} risks in the form of various ways and possibilities of an unauthorized disclosure of data. My paper focuses upon an area that has not been usually taken into much consideration. The impact on the environment/s, as a collateral phenomenon {{in the use of the}} Information-communication Technology (ICT) may be directly linked to the processed data and those data that are transmitted through communication connections. These data my be flowing off into an unsupervised area through the side channels, by means of electromagnetic (EM) radiation, various forms of parasitic couplings, power lines and conducting infrastructure. It could be also possible to intercept them also on the basis of a long-distance observation control, immage rebound, specific sound effects, enery use analysis and other side channel attacks. Taking into consideration the possibility of <b>data</b> <b>interception</b> through side channels, peripheral units (screen, keyboard), communication links and also other equipment, like smart cards, where there is a risk of intercepting the secret key of cryptographic algorithm, may be enlisted among the exposed ICT components. The paper illustrates, on the basis of an analysis of the results and research carried out in the field, the use of the usual information technology as highly risky from this point of view, mostly because of the impact of the EM on the surroundings. Regulations and standards that regulate this field should be viewed from two points of view. When speaking about the usual personal or business use, these are mostly defined by guaranteeing EM conformity and interference and aimed at minimizing the dangerous impact on the human organism, but they do not guarantee safety against data leakage. On the other hand, provisions for protecting from such threats are prescribed by the law when dealing with confidential or classified data. Misuse of data of the public, national interest can seriously jeopardize the work of the key functions of the State and the public area. Protection against classified data outflow through EM radiation and other side channel attacks is carried out on different levels, while it is impossible to apply the measures in the usual personal or business use sphere due to their complexity. As protection is concerned, in Slovenia we comply with the EU and NATO requirements. Notwithstanding what previously said in regard, there is, however, a number of reccomandations and measures that can be used to also reduce the risk level in the personal and business sphere. To achieve the preset goal, security measures have to bet taken into account through from the very beginning, while planning the information and communication technology process. What I meant to demonstrate in the practical part of the paper was, that there may, however, exist quite some differences between tecnologies that still meet the requirements of the EU technical normative law. ...|$|E
