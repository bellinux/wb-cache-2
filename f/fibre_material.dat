Initial shooting occurred for 10 days in Rann of Kutch, Gujarat. Art director Ravinder went to Chennai and gave details of their requirements to a prominent chariot-making specialist. After rejecting the maker's first iron skeletons, Ravinder opted to design them himself, and prepared three models of chariots with different heights to be used, depending on the camera’s location and other technical requirements. He used <b>fibre</b> <b>material</b> for the iron skeleton's exteriors. For {{a scene in which}} neither the hero nor the villain was present on the chariot, Ravinder measured a short person and designed a hidden chamber in which he could sit and secretly control the horses. While the chariot race sequence was shot in Dholavira, the sequence in which the chariot sinks in quicksand was shot at a set comprising three acres in Ramoji Film City.|$|E

40|$|Acid/base {{and metal}} ion {{adsorption}} properties {{have been investigated}} {{for a range of}} chemically modified bleached Kraft <b>fibre</b> <b>materials</b> (pulps). The studies were performed via potentiometric titrations, Flame Atomic Absorbtion (and Emission) Spectroscopy, Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy and Extended X-ray Absorbtion Fine Structure measurements. As a result of a chemical modification procedure, the total concentration of acidic carboxylate groups in the <b>fibre</b> <b>materials</b> ranged between 43 and 590 μmol/g. The preferable surface potential model for modelling the ionic strength dependent acid/base properties of <b>fibre</b> <b>materials</b> with low charge densities, i. e. unmodified fully bleached Kraft <b>fibre</b> <b>materials,</b> was found to be the Basic Stern Model. For <b>fibre</b> <b>materials</b> with high total charge, ≳ 100 μmol/g, this model resulted in poor fits to data, and for such materials a number of Constant Capacitance Models, one at each ionic strength, must be recommended. With respect to metal ion adsorption, the results have indicated that the unspecific Donnan theory could correctly model the simultaneous adsorption of several metal ions, i. e. K+, Na+, Mg 2 +, Ca 2 + and Cu 2 +, provided that the salt concentration in the fibre suspension is low. In suspensions of high salt concentration it was, however, found that this very same model strongly underestimated the adsorption of Ca 2 + and Cu 2 +. Here, the Donnan model had to be complemented by specific ion exchange equilibria. These results were corroborated by spectroscopic evidence of specific interactions between Cu 2 +-ions and fibres. The spectroscopic indication of a complex formed between two fibre surface carboxylate groups and one Cu 2 +-ion, agree with the specific ion exchange model. It was therefore concluded that specific metal ionfibre interactions cannot be neglected, especially at high salt concentrations. The interactions occurring between the polycation GaO 4 Al 12 (OH) 24 (H 2 O) 127 + and <b>fibre</b> <b>materials</b> were studied by both adsorption and spectroscopic measurements. These indicate that GaO 4 Al 12 (OH) 24 (H 2 O) 127 + is surprisingly stable in fibre suspensions and that intact GaO 4 Al 12 (OH) 24 (H 2 O) 127 +- ions are strongly adsorbed onto the fibres. Also for this ion, specific interactions has to be considered, since the strong adsorption registered was too strong to be explained by Donnan equilibria. In the thesis, the stochiometric composition and an equilibrium constant characterising these interactions is presented...|$|R

50|$|Many centuries ago, fish {{production}} was mainly {{by a few}} fisherfolk communities living by the lakesides who bartered fish for other food commodities. Fishing activities were characterised by use of traditional gears such as spears, arrows, fish-pots, and the capture of fish by hand in shallow waters of lakes, rivers and swamps or fish poisoning with local herbs. However, these types of gears and methods still exist in minor lakes, the River Nile Basin and shallower areas of Lake Victoria. The fishing activity was relatively at a subsistence level. In the mid-1950s, foreign traders introduced Japanese nylon gillnets which proved more effective in the fishery than the cotton, hemp and flax gillnets. Nylon gillnets gave higher catchability characteristics than any other gears mainly because of higher tensile strength, mesh-size constancy, resistance to abrasion and durability of the nylon <b>fibre</b> <b>material.</b> The introduction of new fish scpecies also boosted fish production. Fish production increased by six times in 30 years rising from 60,000 tons in 1961 to 245,000 tons in 1990 {{partly as a result}} of higher productivity of the lakes but also because of the increased catch effort. In 1983 when {{production was}} estimated at 78,000 tons p.a., potential production or Maximum sustainable yield (MSY) was estimated at 150,000 tons, yet by 1990 production had exceeded this level by 55,000 tons.|$|E

In this paper, a continuum mechanics-based three-dimensional periodic beam-network model has been constructed to describe the stochastic <b>fibre</b> network <b>materials.</b> In this model, {{the density of the}} cross-linkers {{is directly related to the}} relative density of the <b>fibre</b> network <b>materials,</b> and the cross-linkers are represented by equivalent beam elements.

The results indicate that the stochastic <b>fibre</b> network <b>materials</b> are transversely isotropic.

For the <b>fibre</b> network <b>materials</b> with a small relative density, the relationship between the uniaxial yield strength and the relative density is a quadratic function in the x direction and is a cubic function in the z direction, which agree well with our dimensional analysis and are consistent with the relevant experimental results in literature.

The vacuum parameters of the LHC vacuum chamber prototype with a carbon fibre cryosorber mounted onto the beam screen were studied in the beam screen temperature range from 14 to 25 K at the Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics SB RAS. This carbon <b>fibre</b> <b>material</b> has shown sufficient sorption capacity for hydrogen at operational temperatures of the beam screen in the LHC long straight sections.
