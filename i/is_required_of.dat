5|$|Kant's Formula of Autonomy {{expresses the}} idea that an agent is obliged to follow the Categorical Imperative because of their {{rational}} will, rather than any outside influence. Kant believed that any moral law motivated {{by the desire to}} fulfill some other interest would deny the Categorical Imperative, leading him to argue that the moral law must only arise from a rational will. This principle requires people to recognize the right of others to act autonomously and means that, as moral laws must be universalisable, what <b>is</b> <b>required</b> <b>of</b> one person <b>is</b> <b>required</b> <b>of</b> all.|$|E
5|$|The {{curriculum}} emphasizes writing; {{students are}} required to complete a semester project each term on a topic chosen in conjunction with an advisor, and are required to complete a research paper during their third year. All students must pass a basic-studies comprehensive examination to register for upper-level courses, and at least one area-studies comprehensive examination (usually in their area of concentration) to graduate. A senior thesis <b>is</b> <b>required</b> <b>of</b> all students. Usually an analytic or expository essay, it may also be a piece of original fiction, poetry, a performance or work of visual art. Students are encouraged to present their theses orally, and the public is invited to the presentations.|$|E

25|$|For Roman Catholics, fasting, {{taken as}} a {{technical}} term, is the reduction of one's intake of food to one full meal (which may not contain meat on Ash Wednesday and Fridays throughout Lent) and two small meals (known liturgically as collations, taken {{in the morning and}} the evening), both of which together should not equal the large meal. Eating solid food between meals is not permitted. Fasting <b>is</b> <b>required</b> <b>of</b> the faithful between the ages of 18 and 59 on specified days. Complete abstinence of meat for the day <b>is</b> <b>required</b> <b>of</b> those 14 and older. Partial abstinence prescribes that meat be taken only once {{during the course of the}} day. Meat is understood not to include fish or cold-blooded animals.|$|E
25|$|In para-alpine and para-Nordic skiing, {{guides for}} B2 and B3 skiers often {{position}} themselves differently as the skiers have some vision, {{which means the}} things a guide assists with will be different from what <b>is</b> <b>required</b> <b>of</b> a skier who has almost no sight.

25|$|In some religions, {{some groups}} of people are {{expected}} to remain unmarried and to abstain from sex completely.

The Shakers, on the other hand, impose chastity in the form of celibacy for all members, even forgoing procreation such as the case with the castration cult.|$|E

25|$|Along {{with sexual}} {{harassment}} policies {{in colleges and}} universities, brochures or informational handouts are often distributed, and there are often designated locations or personnel on campus where victims can report sexual harassment. Under Title IX, schools that receive federal funding must designate a coordinator to whom those who need to report sexual harassment can go to, as well as who can receive suggestions and feedback from students {{on how to improve}} upon how the school is dealing with sexual harassment. This <b>is</b> <b>required</b> <b>of</b> all schools who receive federal funding, not only in higher education.|$|E

They have to act this way, because of the co-operative relationships they necessarily have to work with in the division of labour. People have to conform to them, whether they like it or not.

25|$|The {{use of a}} sighted guide {{by people}} in this class is {{dependent}} on the specific requirements of the sport. Guides are used in para-alpine and para-Nordic skiing. Guides for B2 and B3 skiers often position themselves differently from for B1 skiers as the skiers in this class have some vision, which means the things a guide assists with will be different from what <b>is</b> <b>required</b> <b>of</b> a skier who has almost no sight. The guide may ski in front of the skier and use visual cues to inform the skier of what is ahead of them on the course. For cyclists in this class, a guide is used with the guide sitting at the front of a tandem bicycle.|$|E
25|$|The Klingon {{military}} {{is divided into}} the Navy (serving in space) and the Marines (serving as ground troops rather than shipboard security). There are six enlisted ranks (including warrant officers), seven officer ranks and one cadet rank for officer training. There is significant rivalry between the two branches. Discipline is routinely maintained by the agonizer booth (that stimulates pain nerves without causing physical harm) {{as well as the}} threat of summary execution. Officer candidates spend four or five years in an academy and one year on a cadet cruise. More training <b>is</b> <b>required</b> <b>of</b> commanders. Academy life is spartan, with medicine and food being considered privileges not rights. Marines are often transported in a form of suspended animation with approximately 4% of troops not surviving the awakening process. Klingon mass transporters (for rapid deployment of troops) have a 2% casualty rate. These losses are all seen as acceptable.|$|E

25|$|A general festival for all {{the provinces}} of Sweden is customarily held at Uppsala every nine years. Participation in this festival <b>is</b> <b>required</b> <b>of</b> everyone. Kings and their subjects, collectively and individually, send their gifts to Uppsala; - and – a thing more cruel than any {{punishment}} – those who have already adopted Christianity buy themselves off from these ceremonies. The sacrifice is as follows; of every kind of male creature, nine victims are offered. By the blood of these creatures it is the custom to appease the gods. Their bodies, moreover, are hanged in a grove which is adjacent to the temple. This grove is so sacred {{to the people that}} the separate trees in it are believed to be holy because of the death or putrefaction of the sacrificial victims. There even dogs and horses hang beside human beings. (A certain Christian {{told me that he had}} seen seventy-two of their bodies hanging up together.) The incantations, however, which are usually sung in the performance of a libation of this kind are numerous and disgraceful, and it is better not to speak of them.|$|E

[...] Obama quoted the lyrics of the Jerome Kern and Dorothy Fields song [...] "Pick Yourself Up" [...] from the musical comedy Swing Time, saying that [...] "starting today, we must pick {{ourselves}} up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking America."

500|$|Jaws 3-D had two 3D consultants: the {{production}} started with Chris Condon, president of StereoVision, and Stan Loth was later {{added to the}} team for the Arrivision 3D. Production began using the StereoVision, but this was dropped after {{a week for the}} Arrivision system, [...] "which Alves believed was a superior system because it has a wider variety of lenses". According to Alves, inferior systems lead to ghosting and blurring, leaving audiences with headaches. He says that [...] "the left and right images [...] are very well-matched, and the photography is very clean; it's restful to the eye, and though we do have the occasional effects where things do emerge toward the audience from the plane of projection, you come out of the film without a headache." [...] Historian R. M. Hayes says that the film was shot using both the Arrivision and StereoVision single strip-over-and-under units. Both cameras were used in conjunction with each other. This is a means of shooting 3D movies in normal color with a single camera and single strip of film: the Arrivision 3D technique uses a special twin-lens adapter fitted to the film camera, and divides the 35mm film frame in half along the middle, capturing the left-eye image in the upper half of the frame and the right-eye image in the lower half – this is known as [...] "over/under". This allows filming to proceed as for any standard 2D film, without the considerable additional expense of having to double up on cameras and film stock for every shot. When the resultant film is projected through a normal projector (albeit one requiring a special lens that combines the upper and lower images), a true polarised 3D image is produced. This system allows 3D films to be shown in almost any cinema since it does not require two projectors running simultaneously through the presentation – something most cinemas are not equipped to handle. What <b>is</b> <b>required</b> <b>of</b> the theatre is both the special projection lens and a reflective [...] "silver" [...] screen to enable the polarized images to reflect back to the viewer with the appropriate filter on each eye blocking out the wrong image, thus leaving the viewer to see the film from two angles as the eyes naturally see the world. According to the company that built the underwater camera housings for Jaws 3-D, the underwater sequences were shot using an Arriflex 35–3 camera with Arrivision 18mm over/under 3D lens.|$|E
