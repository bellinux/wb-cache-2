5|$|After renovations were {{finished}} in 2005, {{the number of}} two- and three-bedroom units was increased dramatically, due to {{the combination of the}} building's original studio apartments. The larger layouts attracted more families to the cooperative community. In recent years the lobby has been restored, <b>hallways</b> remodeled, and amenities increased, including larger storage areas, a bike room, and an improved laundry facility. The building is now said to be luxurious as measured both by residents' quality of living and by the purchase prices they pay.|$|E

5|$|The barracks {{was less}} than 10yards wide and 33yards long (9mx30m) and was divided into eight houses, each with three floors, {{containing}} 56 rooms in all. Each floor had seven rooms facing the front and seven in the back. There were no internal <b>hallways.</b> The rooms were accessed directly from the outside via eight narrow wooden staircases, a fire hazard given that the stairs provided the sole exit and the houses were separated only by thin lathe and plaster partitions.|$|E

Madonna resented her father for getting remarried, and began rebelling against him. They {{would have a}} strained relationship for many years afterward. She attended St. Frederick's and St. Andrew's Catholic Elementary Schools, and West Middle School. Madonna was known for her high grade point average, and achieved notoriety for her unconventional behavior. She would perform cartwheels and handstands in the <b>hallways</b> between classes, dangle by her knees from the monkey bars during recess, and pull up her skirt during class—all so that the boys could see her underwear.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the {{building}} underwent an extensive $20million renovation directed by Chicago architect Gunny Harboe, whose restoration work included Loop landmarks the Rookery Building and Reliance Building. The project included {{restoration of the}} main lobby to emphasize the design features of the art deco era, elevator modernization, façade renovation and cleaning, and the continued renovation of upper floor corridors and <b>hallways.</b> Though impractically small for modern use, mailboxes in the lobby were restored to their original condition to follow the theme of vertical lines found throughout the complex. An improved electrical infrastructure, with ten main feeds from seven different Commonwealth Edison electrical substations, was added in addition to redundant cooling systems and upgraded telecommunications capabilities.|$|E

Noe had been built without an auditorium in anticipation of a theater-oriented school being built on site. The YPAS building includes production facilities, a costume shop and an 886-seat proscenium-style theater. The YPAS building did not contain extensive classroom space, however, and for many years teachers conducted YPAS classes in <b>hallways</b> and on loading docks if other space wasn't available. Since 1993, YPAS has used an adjacent facility, built in 1899 and formerly home to Cochran Elementary, as an annex.|$|E

As they ran, they encountered Harris and Klebold, who were approaching from the corner of the North <b>Hallway.</b> Sanders and the student turned and ran in the opposite direction. Harris and Klebold shot at them both, with Harris hitting Sanders twice in the chest but missing the student. The latter ran into a science classroom and warned everyone to hide. Klebold walked over towards Sanders, who had collapsed, to look for the student but returned to Harris up the North <b>Hallway.</b>|$|R

5|$|At {{the front}} of the house, on the ground floor, is a reconstructed medieval shop front, from where the owner would have {{conducted}} his mercantile business. Behind this is the central hall, originally designed with an open hearth in the middle, but now fitted with a 14th-century Flemish chimney, plastered so as to resemble brickwork. A hallway runs along one side of the hall; <b>hallways</b> were a traditional feature of the period, although the fashion was eventually abandoned because of the difficulty of lighting them effectively. At the rear of the property is an inner private room, with a decorative ceiling. Beneath the house is an undercroft, or cellar, designed to store barrels of wine at a constant temperature; the brick floor is 18th-century in origin, however. This is an architectural feature found in several other English coastal and river medieval towns, including Winchester and London.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Hallway</b> Hangers {{and their}} parents {{rejected}} the achievement ideology {{because they did not}} see job success through hard work to be a likely outcome in their situation, a situation in which few family members ever succeeded financially, where job opportunities were few and where hard work in school rarely influenced employability. Moreover, if the <b>Hallway</b> Hangers were to accept the achievement ideology, this would logically entail the belief that their parents had not succeeded financially because they were lazy or unintelligent. The <b>Hallway</b> Hangers knew this was not true. [...] Ironically, though the caucasian <b>Hallway</b> Hangers understood that the achievement ideology was false in their case, they were not able to understand that it was equally false in the case of African Americans. The <b>Hallway</b> Hangers were kept from this understanding by their belief in another powerful American ideology, that of racism and the intellectual inferiority of Blacks. Whereas the <b>Hallway</b> Hangers recognized that they failed to succeed financially because of their position in the lower class, they could not see that class exploitation was also responsible for the financial failure of African Americans. In addition to attributing inferiority to African Americans, the <b>Hallway</b> Hangers also scapegoated them, blaming them for taking all of the jobs that they, as white, believed they deserved.|$|R
50|$|The brick core {{comprises}} {{two rooms}} up and two down, with a <b>hallway</b> {{along the southern}} end of the ground floor leading from what was originally the front door in the western wall to a small stair hall in the SE corner of the building. There is an original arch between the <b>hallway</b> and the stair hall, and an early back door in the eastern external wall below the staircase. The lack of a central <b>hallway</b> is unusual in a house of this period, suggesting the design was the work of a competent architect who maximised the size and functionality of the rooms by offsetting the <b>hallway.</b>|$|R
50|$|Inside the school, the {{interior}} rooms are set along {{both sides of}} a main <b>hallway</b> that runs the length of the building.

Phineas and Ferb are inspired {{to find their own}} mummy and go out to the basement of the theater, where there is rumored to be a mummy. Candace sees them going off to do this and follows them, hoping to get them in trouble with their father. However, as Phineas and Ferb go searching for the mummy through the basement <b>hallways</b> wearing archeologist hats, they run into what they believe are booby traps; they avoid the traps but Candace ends up getting hit by them all. Eventually, she becomes caught up in raggy toilet paper and cannot talk properly (due to eating stale bubble gum), which leads to the boys mistaking her for the mummy and capturing her.|$|E
5|$|The {{facility}} features architecture {{intended to}} evoke {{a sense of}} calm. It was constructed with a central courtyard {{and a number of}} windows overlooking it, as well as nature-related artwork and architecture. There are also separate <b>hallways</b> for staff and visitors {{in order to make the}} interior appear less crowded. The hospital also features a substantial amount of parking and a shuttle service to the entrance. Miami Valley Hospital South was constructed with future expansion in mind. Two of the five floors in the patient wing are empty and can be filled adding 24 beds each. A third hallway can be added to the wing which will add 60 beds, and the maternity ward can also be expanded with a second floor to add 12 beds, which means the facility could be expanded to 180 beds.|$|E
