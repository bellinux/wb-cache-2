40|$|This study {{set out to}} {{investigate}} which career path a group of <b>intellectually</b> <b>gifted</b> <b>individuals</b> chose, if any. How did they actually like their work, and what were the reasons for satisfaction or dissatisfaction with their chosen career? In all, 287 Mensa members (216 men and 71 women) constituted the research group. Their average age was 34. 4 years (SD = 8. 8) and all had obtained IQ scores equal to or higher than the 98 th percentile. The study {{was designed as a}} survey operationalized as an Internet-based questionnaire using the SPSS Dimensions software. A shortened version of the Work and Life Attitudes Survey (Warr, Cook & Wall, 1979) was included as part of the questionnaire. Quantitative data were analyzed as dispersions within the research group whereas qualitative data were content-analyzed using the so-called VSAIEEDC Model. Results show that participants tended to pursue careers mainly in Technology, Science and Social Work and to a lesser degree in Practical and Aesthetic work. Work satisfaction for all these fields was shown to be average. However, for individuals choosing to start their own company and, or assume leading managerial positions, satisfaction with work and career is very high. This article focuses on possible reasons for differences between subgroups in the sample and discusses a possible way forward to improve work satisfaction for <b>intellectually</b> <b>gifted</b> <b>individuals</b> at work, where needed...|$|R
40|$|Recent efforts {{examining}} {{the educational and}} vocational development needs of <b>intellectually</b> <b>gifted</b> students {{have focused on the}} possibility of early intervention. There is considerable anecdotal evidence that the gifted begin to think earlier about careers than their peers and that their general vocational preferences may crystallize at an earlier age. Empirical research has produced some support for these assertions, as well as the notion that tests and questionnaires devised for use with older students might be applied in early adolescence with <b>intellectually</b> <b>gifted</b> <b>individuals.</b> Instruments measuring abilities and preferences, factors critical to the development of educational and vocational choice, competence, and fulfillment, enjoy long and successful histories of predicting vocational outcomes in adult populations. Although much has been uncovered in the last 25 years regarding the utility of above-level ability testing among the <b>intellectually</b> <b>gifted,</b> relatively little is known about how above-level preference assessment might also be applied to <b>intellectually</b> <b>gifted</b> persons in their early adolescent years. Chapter 1 of this dissertation reviewed components of both vocational psychology and gifted student literature pertaining to these developments. Then, using the Theory of Work Adjustment (Dawis 2 ̆ 6 Lofquist, 1984; Lofquist 2 ̆ 6 Dawis, 1991) and C. P. Snow 2 ̆ 7 s (1959) conceptualization of 2 ̆ 2 two cultures 2 ̆ 2 as theoretical frameworks, the study presented in Chapter 2 analyzed the incremental validity of above-level preference assessment (relative to abilities) in predicting humanities, math-science, and other college majors completed by the <b>intellectually</b> <b>gifted.</b> Discriminant analysis results indicated that the age- 13 SAT (used to measure abilities) and Study of Values (used to measure preferences) assessments of 432 <b>intellectually</b> <b>gifted</b> adolescents each provided unique and valuable information to the prediction of type of college major completed 10 years after initial assessment. These positive findings add to growing support for the notion of early crystallization of preferences among the gifted and lend further credence to conjointly applying above-level ability and preference assessment in facilitating educational and early career planning among <b>intellectually</b> <b>gifted</b> adolescents...|$|R
40|$|<b>Intellectually</b> <b>gifted</b> <b>individuals</b> are {{increasingly}} {{seen as the}} problem solvers of the future who are to secure societal prosperity and welfare. However, {{little attention has been}} paid to the fact that there may exist cultural obstacles in promoting intellectual giftedness in any given culture when setting such educational targets. If certain abilities are not highly valued in a given culture, it seems unlikely that increasing an interest in education focused on excellence in these abilities would be as successful as hoped. The abilities needed for economical growth and continued welfare are not necessarily the abilities valued by the people who are expected to pursue such training. Successful implementation is likely to dependent on the culturally dominant ability climate. The presentation focuses on a recent study of ability climates in 29 European countries as based on socially represented notability. The analysis of data yielded three types of European ability climates: A uniform ability climate; a divergent ability climate, and a diverse ability climate; each of which was characterized by clusters of abilities that seemed to be particularly valued in a given European country. Only nine of the participating countries appeared to feature an ability climate conducive to intellectual pursuits.

40|$|The term <b>intellectually</b> <b>gifted</b> rural-to-urban migrant {{children}} {{refers to}} <b>intellectually</b> <b>gifted</b> {{children who are}} in migration from rural to urban areas. We compared performances on seven attention tasks among <b>intellectually</b> <b>gifted</b> (n= 26) and average (n= 30) rural-to-urban migrant and <b>intellectually</b> <b>gifted</b> urban children (n= 31).
