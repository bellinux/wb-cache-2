5|$|On August 22, a {{tropical}} wave moved {{off the coast}} of Africa, and it moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea without developing significantly. On September 1 the wave axis entered the Gulf of Mexico, and upon doing so convection steadily organized around a low-level center of circulation. The system moved northward and developed into Tropical Depression Twelve on September 3 while located about 300miles (480kilometers) west of Tampa, Florida. <b>Embedded</b> <b>within</b> <b>a</b> slow mid-latitude trough, the depression moved eastward and strengthened into Tropical Storm Henri on September 5.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} autumn 2007, long-rage {{forecast}} models {{indicated that a}} La Niña would develop by December of that year. In general, this event results in increased sea surface temperatures near Australia. Following this, a strong Madden–Julian oscillation phase took shape, leading {{to the development of}} Tropical Cyclone Melanie off the coast of Western Australia and an area of low pressure over the Top End by 28December. Situated over land, the system initially <b>embedded</b> <b>within</b> <b>a</b> disorganised trough and to intensify as it slowly tracked eastward. By 30December, it separated itself from the trough and travelled towards the west. The following day, the interaction between the two systems allowed the low to significantly deepen, attaining a barometric pressure of 993mbar (hPa; 29.32inHg). This strengthening was short-lived as wind shear over the low increased, displacing convection from its centre.|$|E
5|$|By {{the evening}} of June22, {{satellite}} imagery indicated {{the formation of an}} eyewall; by this time Andres was near hurricane-status. Early the next day, the center of circulation became <b>embedded</b> <b>within</b> <b>a</b> central dense overcast and Andres intensified into a hurricane, the first of the season, around 0600UTC. At this time, the storm attained its peak intensity with winds of 80mph (130km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 984mbar (hPa; 29.06inHg); the storm was located roughly 80mi (130km) southwest of Lázaro Cárdenas upon attaining this intensity. Twelve hours after becoming a hurricane, most of the deep convection associated with the storm had weakened; however, Hurricane Hunters still recorded 75mph (120km/h) winds despite the ragged appearance of Andres.|$|E

5|$|Development of Igor quickly ceased once it {{was named}} as a nearby {{disturbance}} produced moderate wind shear over the storm, displacing convection from its center. <b>Embedded</b> <b>within</b> <b>a</b> monsoon trough over the eastern Atlantic, the system maintained a slow westward track as it weakened to a tropical depression on September9. Intensification resumed the following day once shear lessened and the dominant steering factor shifted to a mid-tropospheric ridge north of Igor; it would remain so throughout {{the remainder of the}} cyclone's existence. Contrary to its earlier movement, the storm's forward motion markedly increased. Following the development of an intermittent eye feature and steady convection around its center, Igor strengthened into a hurricane around 0000UTC on September12.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} two days of its duration, Agatha steered toward the north while <b>embedded</b> <b>within</b> <b>a</b> deep southerly flow. Steady {{intensification}} continued, and the storm reached winds of 50 mph (90 km/h) six hours after being upgraded as it neared the coast of Mexico. By the afternoon of June 2, the center exhibited an elongated appearance within its associated central dense overcast, a large area of organized mid-tropospheric convection. Around 1800 UTC that same day, the storm peaked in intensity with winds of 70 mph (110 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 990 mbar (hPa; 29.23 inHg).|$|E
5|$|Intermittent {{bursts of}} deep {{convection}} kept satellite intensity estimates at 40mph (65km/h) {{through the morning}} of June28. After becoming <b>embedded</b> <b>within</b> <b>a</b> low-level westerly flow, the system began to slowly execute a small counter-clockwise loop. That afternoon, Celia degenerated into a non-convective remnant low pressure system; operationally, the system was monitored as a tropical depression for an additional six hours before the final advisory from the NHC was issued. The remnants of Celia continued to drift towards the north before finally dissipating on June30, about 990mi (1,590km) southwest of {{the southern tip of}} Baja California Sur.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} Amara {{can be traced}} back to an area of low {{pressure}} <b>embedded</b> <b>within</b> <b>a</b> monsoon trough southeast of Diego Garcia on December13, 2013. Computer models suggested that surrounding atmospheric conditions would later become more conducive for tropical cyclogenesis. Over the course of the day, the localized area of circulation remained sheared, though convection remained persistent. Despite the hindering atmospheric environment, the system organized faster than anticipated, and was classified as a tropical disturbance by Météo-France at 1200UTC on December14. Shortly after development, the disturbance underwent a reformation phase and consequently a new center of circulation developed, allowing the system to reach tropical depression status early on December15. Nonetheless, the storm's overall structure remained ill-defined due to the presence of wind shear and multiple mesovortices.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Ignacio was a weak {{tropical}} cyclone affected {{parts of the}} western United States in August 1997. The 12th {{tropical cyclone}} and 9th named storm of the 1997 Pacific hurricane season, Ignacio formed west of Mexico from a weather disturbance <b>embedded</b> <b>within</b> <b>a</b> more broad system. It was classified as a tropical depression on August 17, and although it quickly intensified into a tropical storm, harsher environmental conditions caused it to begin weakening as the cyclone moved northward. On August 19, Ignacio transitioned into an extratropical cyclone as it approached California, where its remnants produced unprecedented August rainfall, numerous traffic accidents, and 78,000 power outages.|$|E

5|$|Until {{late in the}} 20th century, the {{temperature}} of Eta Carinae {{was assumed to be}} over 30,000K {{because of the presence of}} high excitation spectral lines, but other aspects of the spectrum suggested much lower temperatures and complex models were created to account for this. It is now known that the Eta Carinae system consists of at least two stars, both with strong stellar winds and a shocked colliding wind (wind-wind collision or WWC) zone, <b>embedded</b> <b>within</b> <b>a</b> dusty nebula that reprocesses 90% of the electromagnetic radiation into the mid and far infrared. All of these features have different temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Upon being {{classified}} as a tropical cyclone, the depression was <b>embedded</b> <b>within</b> <b>a</b> deep easterly steering current provided by a ridge to its north. Expected to track across sea surface temperatures greater than 82°F (28°C), the cyclone was forecast to gradually strengthen and within four days attain hurricane status; the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory predicted the depression to reach Category4 status on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale within three days. Increased northeasterly wind shear shifted the center to the northeastern edge of the deep convection, and despite the shear and its relatively low latitude of 9.7°N, the depression strengthened to attain tropical storm status early on September 3; upon reaching the intensity, the National Hurricane Center classified the system as Tropical Storm Ivan.|$|E
5|$|After {{reaching}} peak winds, Tropical Storm Chantal became disorganized {{while the}} center became ill-defined and situated to the west-southwest {{of the main}} area of convection; {{this was due to}} unfavorable upper-level winds, although computer models continued to forecast a more favorable upper-level environment. By early on August20, Hurricane Hunters reported several low-level circulations <b>embedded</b> <b>within</b> <b>a</b> large low pressure area. Later that day, wind shear decreased when the storm moved into the Gulf of Honduras. Chantal became much better organized, again reaching peak winds of 70miles per hour (110km/h) before making landfall early on August21 near the border of Mexico and Belize. Initially, the storm was forecast to cross the Yucatán Peninsula and Bay of Campeche and make a second landfall in the state of Veracruz. Chantal slowly weakened over land while moving slowly across northern Belize. Convection decreased markedly late on August21, and early the next day Chantal weakened to tropical depression status. The upper- and middle-level circulations turned to the northeast while the low-level circulation turned to the west-southwest further inland. Weakening continued, and late on August22 Chantal dissipated over the Mexican state of Tabasco.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of formation, high clouds {{indicated}} the presence of intense convection, and the cyclone featured an axisymmetric cloud structure, with a distinct, cloud-free eye and rainbands spiraling around the disturbance as a whole. Soon thereafter, the parent low separated from the medicane entirely and continued eastward, meandering toward the Aegean Sea and Turkey. Initially remaining stationary between Greece and Sicily with a minimum atmospheric pressure of 1002mbar (29.59inHg), the newly formed system began to drift southwest-to-south in the following days, influenced by northeasterly flow incited by the initial low, now far to the east, and a high-pressure area above central and eastern Europe. The system's atmospheric pressure increased throughout 15January {{due to the fact}} it was <b>embedded</b> <b>within</b> <b>a</b> large-scale environment, with its rising pressure due to the general prevalence of higher air pressures throughout the region, and was not a sign of deintensification.|$|E
5|$|Following its {{designation}} as a named storm, Carlos drifted generally north-northwestward while <b>embedded</b> <b>within</b> <b>a</b> weak steering regime. The cyclone {{struggled with}} a combination of northerly wind shear and dry air entrainment, limiting the storm's associated deep convection to the eastern quadrant. By early on June13, however, a ragged eye became evident on visible satellite imagery as the upper-level environment became increasingly conducive for intensification, and Carlos was upgraded to a Category1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson scale at 12:00UTC. Deep convection became increasingly symmetric about the eye, and the cyclone reached its initial peak intensity six hours later with winds of 85mph (140km/h) and a minimum pressure of 978mbar (hPa; 28.88inHg). However, early on June14, the presentation of Carlos began to deteriorate as a result of upwelling and the ingestion of dry air; the eye became obscured and banding features decreased as evident on satellite imagery, while the eyewall became increasingly ill-defined on radar. At 00:00UTC on June15, the storm was downgraded to a tropical storm about 75mi (120km) west-southwest of Acapulco.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the {{depression}} possessed {{a combination of}} tropical and subtropical characteristics; it remained attached to a nearby frontal zone, though {{the organization of the}} convection and a warm core within the system resulted in classification as a tropical cyclone. Forecasters had predicted {{the depression}} would only slowly strengthen and reach a peak intensity of 65mph (105km/h). However, the depression steadily organized and had strengthened into Tropical Storm Juan by early September25. Juan moved northwestward at around 10mph (16km/h) in response to a developing subtropical ridge to its east. On September26, an eye feature developed, and very deep convection increased around the circulation. The cloud pattern continued to consolidate, and Juan attained hurricane status later on September26 while located 165mi (270km) southeast of Bermuda. The hurricane moved into an area of warm waters and light wind shear, allowing for additional strengthening; by September27, Juan had attained a peak intensity of 105mph (165km/h) while located 635mi (1,020km) south of Halifax, Nova Scotia. At this peak strength, the eye of the hurricane was distinct and <b>embedded</b> <b>within</b> <b>a</b> well-defined and round central dense overcast.|$|E

5|$|The {{remnants}} of Dean {{turned to the}} north, and became <b>embedded</b> <b>within</b> <b>a</b> large mid-level trough off the East Coast of the United States. Convection increased around the system early on August 24. The system became better organized, with indications of a broad surface circulation forming about 400miles (645km) west-southwest of Bermuda. However, a reconnaissance flight into the {{remnants of}} Dean reported a broad low pressure area with the strongest winds and convection located far from the area of minimum pressure, indicating it had some non-tropical characteristics. The weak disturbance passed {{to the west of}} Bermuda early on August 25, and subsequently began to drift to the northeast. The remnants of Dean produced convection near its developing circulation, and on August 26, while located 220miles (350km) north of Bermuda the system organized sufficiently enough to be re-classified a tropical depression. Operationally, the National Hurricane Center did not re-initiate advisories until fifteen hours later.|$|E
5|$|Upon first {{becoming}} a subtropical cyclone, Andrea was <b>embedded</b> <b>within</b> <b>a</b> large, nearly stationary deep-layer trough, {{resulting in a}} westward movement. Drifting over sea surface temperatures {{of no more than}} 77°F (25°C), the organization of the system deteriorated with a significant decrease in convection. By early on May 10, much of the associated weather was located to the east of the cyclone within a band of moderate convection due to a brief spell of westerly vertical wind shear. The center of circulation had become disorganized, with several small cloud swirls within the larger circulation. This disorganization of the center, combined with increasing wind shear and dry air suppressing convective activity, caused it to begin weakening later that morning. By 1500UTC on May 10, only a few thunderstorms remained near the center, and thus the NHC downgraded Andrea to subtropical depression status. Though a few intermittent thunderstorms persisted over the eastern semicircle, the depression remained disorganized and weak; the National Hurricane Center discontinued advisories early on May 11, after it had been without significant deep convection for 18hours about 80miles (125km) northeast of Cape Canaveral, Florida.|$|E
5|$|When Barry {{became a}} {{tropical}} cyclone, its convection wrapped around {{roughly half of}} the center. Outflow in the eastern semicircle was good, although due to upper-level wind shear, it was restricted to southeast of the circulation. The cyclone became <b>embedded</b> <b>within</b> <b>a</b> mid- to-upper-level trough between the ridge over the central U.S. and the ridge over the northwestern Caribbean. A strong, upper-level cyclonic shear axis extended from just south of Cape Hatteras to near Brownsville, Texas, which prevented Barry from accelerating in forward speed. The ridge over the United States weakened, thus collapsing the steering pattern; {{this resulted in a}} west-southwestward drifting motion of the tropical storm by around August 3. Early on August 3, strong westerly winds prevailed, and separated the center of circulation from what limited convection remained. The storm quickly regained some convection, although maximum sustained winds remained weak, at about 40mph (60km/h). Despite a slight drop in barometric pressure, post-season analysis revealed Barry weakened into a tropical depression early on August 4 due to the persistent wind shear and falling external pressure.|$|E
