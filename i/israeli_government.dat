5|$|Brand {{testified in}} 1954 at the {{controversial}} libel trial in Jerusalem of Malchiel Gruenwald, who was sued by the <b>Israeli</b> <b>government</b> {{on behalf of}} Rezső Kasztner. Gruenwald was a Hungarian Holocaust survivor who had moved to Israel after the war. In a self-published pamphlet in 1952 he accused Kasztner, by then an Israeli civil servant, of having collaborated with the Nazis by dealing with Eichmann. Brand testified for Kasztner, but instead of defending him {{took the opportunity to}} accuse the Jewish Agency, whose officials became the first <b>Israeli</b> <b>government,</b> of having helped the British scupper the blood-for-goods proposal.|$|E
5|$|Muslim {{residents}} of Israel and Palestinians living in East Jerusalem are normally {{allowed to enter}} the Temple Mount and pray at the al-Aqsa Mosque without restrictions. Due to security measures, the <b>Israeli</b> <b>government</b> occasionally prevents certain groups of Muslims from reaching al-Aqsa by blocking the entrances to the complex; the restrictions vary from time to time. At times restrictions have prevented all men under 50 and women under 45 from entering, but married men over 45 are allowed. Sometimes the restrictions are enforced {{on the occasion of}} Friday prayers, other times they are {{over an extended period of}} time. Restrictions are most severe for Gazans, followed by restrictions on those from West Bank. The <b>Israeli</b> <b>government</b> states that the restrictions are in place for security reasons.|$|E

5|$|When {{the first}} Black Hebrews arrived in Israel in 1969, they claimed {{citizenship}} under the Law of Return, which gives eligible Jews immediate citizenship. The <b>Israeli</b> <b>government</b> ruled in 1973 {{that the group}} did not qualify for automatic citizenship {{because they could not}} prove Jewish descent and had not undergone Orthodox conversion. The Black Hebrews were denied work permits and state benefits. The group accused the <b>Israeli</b> <b>government</b> of racist discrimination. In 1981, a group of American civil rights activists led by Bayard Rustin investigated and concluded that racism was not the cause of the Black Hebrews' situation. No official action was taken to return the Black Hebrews to the United States, but some individual members were deported for working illegally.|$|E

5|$|Arafat {{remains a}} {{controversial}} figure. The {{majority of the}} Palestinian people view him as a heroic freedom fighter and martyr who symbolized the national aspirations of his people. Conversely, most Israelis came to regard him as an unrepentant terrorist, while Palestinian rivals, including Islamists and several PLO leftists, often denounced him for being corrupt or too submissive in his concessions to the <b>Israeli</b> <b>government.</b>|$|E
5|$|In September 2012 the <b>Israeli</b> <b>government</b> set {{up another}} inquiry {{at the request}} of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The team was led by Yossi Kuperwasser, {{director-general}} of the Strategic Affairs Ministry.

5|$|In mid-1996, Benjamin Netanyahu {{was elected}} Prime Minister of Israel. Palestinian-Israeli {{relations}} grew even more hostile {{as a result}} of continued conflict. Despite the Israel-PLO accord, Netanyahu opposed the idea of Palestinian statehood. In 1998, US President Bill Clinton persuaded the two leaders to meet. The resulting Wye River Memorandum detailed the steps to be taken by the <b>Israeli</b> <b>government</b> and PNA to complete the peace process.|$|E

5|$|After Israel {{captured}} East Jerusalem from Jordan in 1967, {{a number}} of plans were submitted {{for the design of}} a new building. After years of deliberation and indecision, a commemorative arch was erected instead at the site in 1977, itself becoming a prominent landmark of the Jewish Quarter. The plan to rebuild the synagogue in its 19th-century style received approval by the <b>Israeli</b> <b>Government</b> in 2000, and the newly rebuilt synagogue was dedicated on March 15, 2010.|$|E
5|$|On December 23, 2016 {{under the}} Obama Administration, the United States abstained from United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334, {{effectively}} {{allowing it to}} pass. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu strongly criticized the Administration's actions, and the <b>Israeli</b> <b>government</b> withdrew its annual dues from the organization, which totaled $6million in United States dollars, on January 6, 2017. On January 5, 2017, the United States House of Representatives voted 342–80 to condemn the UN Resolution.|$|E
5|$|Persistent {{attempts}} by the <b>Israeli</b> <b>government</b> to identify another Palestinian leader to represent the Palestinian people failed. Arafat was enjoying the support of groups that, given his own history, would normally have been quite wary of dealing with or supporting him. Marwan Barghouti (a leader of al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades) emerged as a possible replacement during the Second Intifada, but Israel had him arrested for allegedly {{being involved in the}} killing of twenty-six civilians, and he was sentenced to five life terms.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2010, Israel's {{government}} approved {{construction of}} an additional 1,600 apartments in a large Jewish housing development in northern East Jerusalem called Ramat Shlomo despite {{the position of the}} current U.S. Government that acts such as this thwart the peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians. The <b>Israeli</b> <b>government's</b> announcement occurred during a visit by U.S. Vice-President Joe Biden and the U.S. government subsequently issued a strongly worded condemnation of the plan. Netanyahu subsequently issued a statement that all previous <b>Israeli</b> <b>governments</b> had continuously permitted construction in the neighborhood, and that certain neighborhoods such as Ramat Shlomo and Gilo have always been included as part of Israel in any final agreement plan that has been proposed by either side to date. Netanyahu regretted the timing of the announcement but asserted that [...] "our policy on Jerusalem is the same policy followed by all <b>Israeli</b> <b>governments</b> for the 42 years, and it has not changed." ...|$|R

5|$|The <b>Israeli</b> <b>government</b> {{and some}} Jewish groups {{strongly}} criticised the report, which they asserted was biased and commissioned by a UN body that was hostile to Israel.

Goldstone denied the accusations, saying he felt that being a Jew increased his obligation {{to participate in the}} investigation.|$|E
5|$|The {{document}} {{was presented to}} the British Museum in 1924 by Walter Rothschild; today it is held in the British Library, which separated from the British Museum in 1973, as Additional Manuscripts number 41178.

The aircraft were scrambled to perform CAPs, some having to dump their bomb loads in the Mediterranean, yet no aerial opposition was encountered. The squadron flew 37 sorties on the first day of the war, of which only 4 were strike missions, while two aircraft suffered damage from SA-7s over the Golan Heights.|$|E

5|$|Parsons was {{immediately}} fired from Hughes; the FBI investigated the complaint and were suspicious that Parsons was spying for the <b>Israeli</b> <b>government.</b> Parsons denied the allegations when interrogated; {{he insisted that}} his intentions were peaceful {{and that he had}} suffered an error of judgment in procuring the documents. Some of Parsons' scientific colleagues rallied to his defense, but the case against him worsened when the FBI investigated Rosenfeld for being linked to Soviet agents, and more accounts of his occult and sexually permissive activities at the Parsonage came to light. In October 1951 the U.S. attorney decided that because the contents of the reports did not constitute state secrets, Parsons was not guilty of espionage.|$|E
5|$|Schindler {{moved to}} West Germany after the war, {{where he was}} {{supported}} by assistance payments from Jewish relief organisations. After receiving a partial reimbursement for his wartime expenses, he moved with his wife, Emilie, to Argentina, where they took up farming. When he went bankrupt in 1958, Schindler left his wife and returned to Germany, where he failed at several business ventures and relied on financial support from Schindlerjuden ("Schindler Jews") – the people whose lives he had saved during the war. He was named Righteous Among the Nations by the <b>Israeli</b> <b>government</b> in 1963. He died on 9 October 1974 in Hildesheim, Germany, and was buried in Jerusalem on Mount Zion, {{the only member of}} the Nazi Party to be honoured in this way.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Israeli</b> <b>government</b> {{arranged}} for the trial to have prominent media coverage.

The trial was held at the Beit Ha'am (today known as the Gerard Behar Center), an auditorium in central Jerusalem. Eichmann sat inside a bulletproof glass booth to protect him from assassination attempts. The building was modified to allow journalists to watch the trial on closed-circuit television, and 750 seats were available in the auditorium itself. Israelis had the opportunity to watch live television broadcasts of the proceedings, and videotape was flown daily to the United States for broadcast the following day.|$|E

In response, Livingstone wrote [...] "For 20 years <b>Israeli</b> <b>governments</b> have attempted to portray anyone who forcefully criticizes the policies of Israel as anti-semitic. The truth is the opposite: the same universal human values that recognize the Holocaust as the greatest racist crime of the 20th century require condemnation of the policies of successive <b>Israeli</b> <b>governments</b> - not on the absurd grounds that they are Nazi or equivalent to the Holocaust, but because ethnic cleansing, discrimination and terror are immoral." ...|$|R
