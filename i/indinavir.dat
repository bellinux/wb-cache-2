2500|$|In April 1995, Merck and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases began {{recruiting}} {{patients for}} a trial examining {{the effects of a}} three drug combination of the protease inhibitor <b>indinavir</b> and two nucleoside analogs. illustrating the substantial benefit of combining 2 NRTIs with a new class of anti-retrovirals, protease inhibitors, namely <b>indinavir.</b> Later that year David Ho became an advocate of this [...] "hit hard, hit early" [...] approach with aggressive treatment with multiple antiretrovirals early {{in the course of the}} infection. [...] Later reviews in the late 90s and early 2000s noted that this approach of [...] "hit hard, hit early" [...] ran significant risks of increasing side effects and development of multidrug resistance, and this approach was largely abandoned. The only consensus was on treating patients with advanced immunosuppression (CD4 counts less than 350/μL). Treatment with antiretrovirals was expensive at the time, ranging from $10,000 to $15,000 a year.|$|E
2500|$|Protease inhibitors {{block the}} viral {{protease}} enzyme necessary to produce mature virions upon budding from the host membrane. [...] Particularly, these drugs prevent the cleavage of gag and gag/pol precursor proteins. [...] Virus particles {{produced in the}} presence of protease inhibitors are defective and mostly non-infectious. Examples of HIV protease inhibitors are lopinavir, <b>indinavir,</b> nelfinavir, amprenavir and ritonavir. Darunavir and atazanavir are currently recommended as first line therapy choices. Maturation inhibitors have a similar effect by binding to gag, but development of two experimental drugs in this class, bevirimat and vivecon, was halted in 2010. [...] Resistance to some protease inhibitors is high. Second generation drugs have been developed that are effective against otherwise resistant HIV variants.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{effective}} therapy against HIV was the nucleoside {{reverse transcriptase}} inhibitor (NRTI), zidovudine (AZT). It {{was approved by}} the US FDA in 1987. Subsequently, several more NRTIs were developed but even in combination were unable to suppress the virus {{for long periods of time}} and patients still inevitably died. To distinguish from this early antiretroviral therapy (ART), the term highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was introduced. [...] In 1996 by sequential publications in The New England Journal of Medicine by Hammer and colleagues and Gulick and coinvestigators illustrating the substantial benefit of combining 2 NRTIs with a new class of antiretrovirals, protease inhibitors, namely <b>indinavir.</b> This concept of 3-drug therapy was quickly incorporated into clinical practice and rapidly showed impressive benefit with a 60% to 80% decline in rates of AIDS, death, and hospitalization.|$|E

50|$|<b>Indinavir,</b> {{which is}} a peptidomimetic hydroxyethylene HIV {{protease}} inhibitor, reached the market in 1996. The design of <b>indinavir</b> was guided by molecular modeling and the X-ray crystal structure of the inhibited enzyme complex. The terminal phenyl constituents contribute hydrophobic binding to increase potency. It is an analogue of the phenylalanine-proline cleavage site of the HIV Gag-polyprotein.|$|E
5000|$|The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{approved}} <b>indinavir</b> on March 13, 1996, {{making it}} the eighth antiretroviral drug approved. <b>Indinavir</b> is much more powerful than any prior antiretroviral drug; using it with dual NRTIs set a new standard for treatment of HIV/AIDS. Protease inhibitors {{changed the nature of}} AIDS from a terminal illness to a somewhat manageable one.|$|E

50|$|<b>Indinavir</b> (IDV; {{trade name}} Crixivan, {{manufactured}} by Merck) is a protease inhibitor {{used as a}} component of highly active antiretroviral therapy to treat HIV/AIDS.|$|E
50|$|Reduction in <b>indinavir</b> and {{delavirdine}} plasma {{levels have}} been shown to occur when administered simultaneously with didanosine; these drugs should be administered at different times.|$|E
50|$|<b>Indinavir</b> {{inhibits}} urinary {{nitrous oxide}} production and may inhibit nitric oxide production. Treatment with this drug is frequently associated with renal abnormalities, sterile leukocyturia, and reduced creatinine clearance.|$|E
5000|$|St. John's wort {{affects the}} {{clearance}} of numerous drugs, including cyclosporin, SSRI antidepressants, digoxin, <b>indinavir,</b> and phenprocoumon. It may also {{interact with the}} anti-cancer drugs irinotecan and imatinib.|$|E
5000|$|Protease inhibitors {{can cause}} a {{syndrome}} of lipodystrophy, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus type 2, and kidney stones. This lipodystrophy is colloquially known as [...] "Crix belly", after <b>indinavir</b> (Crixivan).|$|E
50|$|Stavudine, {{zidovudine}} and <b>indinavir</b> (IDV) cause {{a decrease}} in mitochondrial respiration {{and an increase in}} mitochondrial mass in fat cells. Stavudine also causes severe mitochondrial DNA depletion. Combining zidovudine with stavudine does not increase the mitochondrial toxicity compared to stavudine alone. Both of these drugs must be phosphorylated by host enzymes before they become active. Zidovudine inhibits the phosphorylation of stavudine. This might reduce the toxicity of the combination. Using <b>indinavir</b> in combination with the other two drugs did not increase the toxicity of the combination. <b>Indinavir</b> is a protease inhibitor and works by a different mechanism than the other antiviral drugs. (d4T+AZT+IDV = d4T+AZT = d4T+IDV > AZT+IDV = AZT = IDV). All three of these drugs inhibit the expression of respiratory chain subunits (cytochrome c oxidase CytOx2 and CytOx4) in white fat cells but not brown fat cells. Since stavudine and zidovudine are OAT1 substrates, they may have similar effects on proximal renal tubule cells as they do on fat cells.|$|E
50|$|The UAB AIDS Center was {{the first}} to perform {{clinical}} trails of the protease inhibitor <b>Indinavir</b> (Crixivan), one of the first protease inhibitors used in the drug cocktail to fight HIV.|$|E
50|$|Nevirapine is an inducer of {{cytochrome}} P450 isoenzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. It {{may reduce}} levels of several co-administered drugs including the antiretrovirals efavirenz, <b>indinavir,</b> lopinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir, {{as well as}} clarithromycin, ketoconazole, forms of hormonal contraception, and methadone.|$|E
50|$|Berry {{served as}} {{principal}} investigator {{on more than}} 50 phase II-IV HIV-1 clinical studies providing consistent, reliable data leading to FDA approval of lamivudine, <b>indinavir,</b> ritonavir and saquinavir. Dr. Berry was also the host of MedTalk and HearTalk radio talk show.|$|E
50|$|Atazanavir is {{contraindicated}} {{in those}} with previous hypersensitivity (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, or toxic skin eruptions). Additionally, atazanavir should not be given with alfuzosin, rifampin, irinotecan, lurasidone, pimozide, triazolam, orally administered midazolam, ergot derivatives, cisapride, St. John's wort, lovastatin, simvastatin, sildenafil, <b>indinavir,</b> or nevirapine.|$|E
50|$|Vorapaxar is {{eliminated}} primarily by metabolism by the CYP3A enzymes. It {{is best to}} avoid any strong CYP3A4 inhibitors(ex: ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, ritonavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, <b>indinavir,</b> boceprevir, telaprevir, telithromycin, and conivaptan). CYP3A4 inducers(Carbamazepine, rifampin, St. John's Wort, and Phenytoin) should also be avoided.|$|E
50|$|Unfortunately, <b>indinavir</b> {{wears off}} quickly after dosing, so {{requires}} very precise dosing every eight hours to thwart HIV from forming drug-resistant mutations, including resistances to other protease inhibitors. It has restrictions on {{what sorts of}} food may be eaten concurrently. For these reasons it is now rarely used.|$|E
50|$|Contraindications include: atherosclerosis, Buerger's syndrome, {{coronary}} artery disease, hepatic disease, pregnancy, pruritus, Raynaud's syndrome, and renal disease.It's also contraindicated if patient is taking Macrolide antibiotics (eg, erythromycin), certain HIV protease inhibitors (eg, ritonavir, nelfinavir, <b>indinavir),</b> certain azole antifungals (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole) delavirdine, efavirenz or a 5-HT1 agonist (eg, sumatriptan).|$|E
50|$|Methaniazide/thioacetazone, {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Neothetazone, is an {{antibiotic}} combination of methaniazide (neotizide) and thioacetazone that is or was very commonly used {{in the treatment of}} tuberculosis. It has been implicated as a cause of gigantomastia in a single 1970 case report, and, along with D-penicilliamine, bucillamine, ciclosporin, and <b>indinavir,</b> is one of the only drugs to have been associated with gigantomastia.|$|E
5000|$|Being metabolized by hepatic {{cytochrome}} P450, voriconazole {{interacts with}} many drugs. [...] Voriconazole {{should not be}} used in conjunction with many drugs including sirolimus, rifampicin, rifabutin, carbamazepine, quinidine and ergot alkaloids) and dose adjustments and/or monitoring when coadministered with others (including fluconazole, warfarin, ciclosporin, tacrolimus, omeprazole, and phenytoin). Voriconazole may be safely administered with cimetidine, ranitidine, <b>indinavir,</b> macrolide antibiotics, mycophenolate, digoxin and prednisolone.|$|E

50|$|Abiraterone acetate is a CYP3A4 {{substrate}} {{and hence}} {{should not be}} administered concurrently with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, atazanavir, nefazodone,saquinavir, telithromycin, ritonavir, <b>indinavir,</b> nelfinavir, voriconazole) or inducers such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital. It also inhibits CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4 and likewise {{should not be taken}} concurrently with substrates of any of these enzymes that have a narrow therapeutic index.|$|E
50|$|One {{group of}} drugs that {{efavirenz}} affects is protease inhibitors, which are used for HIV/AIDS. Efavirenz will lower the blood levels of most protease inhibitors, including aprenavir, atazanavir, and <b>indinavir.</b> At lowered levels, protease inhibitors may not be effective in people taking both drugs, which means {{the virus that causes}} HIV/AIDS won’t be stopped from replicating and may become resistant to the protease inhibitor.|$|E
5000|$|Common {{causes of}} drug-related {{cheilitis}} include Etretinate, <b>Indinavir,</b> Protease inhibitors, Vitamin A and Isotretinoin (a retinoid drug). Uncommon causes include Atorvastatin, Busulphan, Clofazimine, Clomipramine, Cyancobalamin, Gold, Methyldopa, Psoralens, Streptomycin, Sulfasalazine and Tetracycline. A condition called [...] "drug-induced ulcer of the lip" [...] {{is described as}} being characterized by painful or tender, well-defined ulcerations of the lip without induration. It {{is the result of}} oral administration of drugs, and the condition resolves when the drugs are stopped.|$|E
50|$|After the {{discovery}} of HIV protease it only took 10 years for its first inhibitor to reach the market. The first reports of highly selective antagonists against the HIV protease were revealed in 1987. Phase I trials of saquinavir began in 1989 {{and it was the}} first HIV protease inhibitor to be approved for prescription use in 1995. Four months later, two other protease inhibitors, ritonavir and <b>indinavir,</b> were approved. In 2009, ten protease inhibitors have reached the market for treatment against HIV but one protease inhibitor, amprenavir, was withdrawn from the market in 2004.|$|E
50|$|Several drugs {{may cause}} AC {{as a side}} effect, by various mechanisms, such as {{creating}} drug-induced xerostomia. Various examples include isotretinoin, <b>indinavir,</b> and sorafenib. Isotretinoin (Accutane), an analog of vitamin A, is a medication which dries the skin. Less commonly, angular cheilitis is associated with primary hypervitaminosis A, which can occur when large amounts of liver (including cod liver oil and other fish oils) are regularly consumed or as a result from an excess intake of vitamin A {{in the form of}} vitamin supplements. Recreational drug users may develop AC. Examples include cocaine, methamphetamines, heroin, and hallucinogens.|$|E
50|$|The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) devoted the July {{issue of}} their {{magazine}} to HIV topics {{to support the}} conference, and chose especially to focus on two studies which would be presented at the conference. One focus was Roy Gulick's study on combination therapy for reducing viral load in HIV positive persons, in which AZT, 3TC and <b>indinavir</b> were shown to cause study participants to lower their viral load to undetectable levels. The other was Michael Giordano's study which showed that HIV positive mothers could {{reduce the risk of}} transmission of HIV to their child by elective cesarean section, taking AZT before delivery of the child, and taking AZT intravenously during the delivery.|$|E
50|$|People {{with certain}} rare inborn errors of {{metabolism}} have a propensity to accumulate crystal-forming substances in their urine. For example, those with cystinuria, cystinosis, and Fanconi syndrome may form stones composed of cystine. Cystine stone formation {{can be treated}} with urine alkalinization and dietary protein restriction. People afflicted with xanthinuria often produce stones composed of xanthine. People afflicted with adenine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency may produce 2,8-dihydroxyadenine stones, alkaptonurics produce homogentisic acid stones, and iminoglycinurics produce stones of glycine, proline and hydroxyproline. Urolithiasis has also been noted {{to occur in the}} setting of therapeutic drug use, with crystals of drug forming within the renal tract in some people currently being treated with agents such as <b>indinavir,</b> sulfadiazine and triamterene.|$|E
