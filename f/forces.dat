5|$|According {{to the new}} strategy, the <b>forces</b> under Girolamo Ramorino and Tomasz Łubieński were {{to leave}} the city and stay on the right bank of the Vistula, harass the Russian <b>forces</b> under von Rosen and von Rüdiger, capture the river {{crossings}} at Osiek, provide the city with supplies, and force Paskevich to divert some of his <b>forces</b> to fight them. Both <b>forces</b> left the city between 16 and 20 August 1831. Tomasz Łubieński's Corps headed towards Płock, broke the encirclement, and delivered much-needed supplies to Warsaw. His <b>forces</b> also broke the northern line of communications between Paskevich's <b>forces</b> and East Prussia. Girolamo Ramorino's II Corps in Podlasie defeated von Rosen's Corps in several clashes, including the battles of Międzyrzec and Rogoźnica. Ramorino's indecisiveness and disregard for orders allowed the defeated and numerically inferior Russians to retreat towards Brześć Litewski and avoid complete destruction.|$|E

5|$|After the United States was {{attacked}} at Pearl Harbor on December7, 1941 by Japanese <b>forces,</b> it entered World War II {{to join the}} Allied <b>forces</b> in their fight against the Axis powers. American <b>forces</b> led by General Douglas MacArthur, already stationed in the Philippines as a deterrent against a Japanese invasion of the islands, were attacked by the Japanese hours after Pearl Harbor. On March12, 1942, General MacArthur and a few select officers, on the orders of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, left the American <b>forces,</b> promising to return with reinforcements. The 72,000 soldiers of the United States Army <b>Forces</b> in the Far East (USAFFE), fighting with outdated weapons, lacking supplies, and stricken with disease and malnourishment, eventually surrendered to the Japanese on April 9, 1942.|$|E
5|$|All of the <b>forces</b> in the {{universe}} are based on four fundamental interactions. The strong and weak <b>forces</b> are nuclear <b>forces</b> that act only at very short distances, and {{are responsible for the}} interactions between subatomic particles, including nucleons and compound nuclei. The electromagnetic force acts between electric charges, and the gravitational force acts between masses. All other <b>forces</b> in nature derive from these four fundamental interactions. For example, friction is a manifestation of the electromagnetic force acting between the atoms of two surfaces, and the Pauli exclusion principle, which does not permit atoms to pass through each other. Similarly, the <b>forces</b> in springs, modeled by Hooke's law, are the result of electromagnetic <b>forces</b> and the Exclusion Principle acting together to return an object to its equilibrium position. Centrifugal <b>forces</b> are acceleration <b>forces</b> that arise simply from the acceleration of rotating frames of reference.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} masses, gravity pulls the rider {{and all the}} bike {{components}} toward the earth. At each tire contact patch there are ground reaction <b>forces</b> with both horizontal and vertical components. The vertical components mostly counteract the force of gravity, but also vary with braking and accelerating. For details, see the section on longitudinal stability below. The horizontal components, due to friction between the wheels and the ground, including rolling resistance, are in response to propulsive <b>forces,</b> braking <b>forces,</b> and turning <b>forces.</b> Aerodynamic <b>forces</b> due to the atmosphere are mostly {{in the form of}} drag, but can also be from crosswinds. At normal bicycling speeds on level ground, aerodynamic drag is the largest force resisting forward motion. At faster speed, aerodynamic drag becomes overwhelmingly the largest force resisting forward motion.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to its two premier ensembles, the United States Air <b>Force</b> has ten additional active-duty bands: the Air <b>Force</b> Band of the West (at Lackland Air <b>Force</b> Base), the Air <b>Force</b> Heritage of America Band (at Joint Base Langley-Eustis), the Air <b>Force</b> Heartland of America Band (at Offutt Air <b>Force</b> Base), the Air <b>Force</b> Band of Mid-America (at Scott Air <b>Force</b> Base), the Air <b>Force</b> Band of the Golden West (at Travis Air <b>Force</b> Base), the Air <b>Force</b> Band of Flight (at Wright Patterson Air <b>Force</b> Base), the Air <b>Force</b> in Europe Band, the Air <b>Force</b> Band of the Pacific - Asia, and the Air <b>Force</b> Band of the Pacific - Hawaii (at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam).

5|$|At 07:20 Moscow time on 19 November, Soviet <b>forces</b> on the {{northern}} flank of the Axis <b>forces</b> at Stalingrad began their offensive; <b>forces</b> in the south began on 20 November. Although Romanian units were able to repel the first attacks, {{by the end of}} 20 November the Third and Fourth Romanian armies were in headlong retreat, as the Red Army bypassed several German infantry divisions. German mobile reserves were not strong enough to parry the Soviet mechanized spearheads, while the Sixth Army did not react quickly enough nor decisively enough to disengage German armored <b>forces</b> in Stalingrad and reorient them to defeat the impending threat. By late 22 November Soviet <b>forces</b> linked up at the town of Kalach, encircling some 290,000 men east of the Don River. Instead of attempting {{to break out of the}} encirclement, German leader Adolf Hitler decided to keep Axis <b>forces</b> in Stalingrad and resupply them by air. In the meantime, Soviet and German commanders began to plan their next movements.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time that Hyakutake's troops were attacking the Lunga perimeter, Japanese {{warships}} under the overall direction of Isoroku Yamamoto moved into a position near the southern Solomon Islands. From this location, the Japanese naval <b>forces</b> hoped to engage and decisively defeat any Allied (primarily U.S.) naval <b>forces,</b> especially carrier <b>forces,</b> that responded to Hyakutake's ground offensive. Allied naval carrier <b>forces</b> in the area, now under the command of William Halsey, Jr. who had replaced Ghormley, also hoped to meet the Japanese naval <b>forces</b> in battle.|$|E

5|$|By 13 August, the {{offensive}} had fully halted, with German <b>forces</b> being {{driven out of}} Mortain.

UN <b>forces</b> began their final counteroffensive against the stalled North Korean <b>forces</b> on August 15. Intense fighting around P'ohang-dong ensued for several days as each side suffered large numbers of casualties in back-and-forth battles. By August 17, UN <b>forces</b> were able to push North Korean troops out of the Kyongju and An'gang-ni areas, putting the supply road to Taegu out of immediate danger.

5|$|For certain {{physical}} scenarios, it {{is impossible}} to model <b>forces</b> as being due to gradient of potentials. This is often due to macrophysical considerations that yield <b>forces</b> as arising from a macroscopic statistical average of microstates. For example, friction is caused by the gradients of numerous electrostatic potentials between the atoms, but manifests as a force model that is independent of any macroscale position vector. Nonconservative <b>forces</b> other than friction include other contact <b>forces,</b> tension, compression, and drag. However, for any sufficiently detailed description, all these <b>forces</b> are the results of conservative ones since each of these macroscopic <b>forces</b> are the net results of the gradients of microscopic potentials.|$|E

5|$|General Douglas MacArthur was {{appointed}} as the Supreme Commander, Southwest Pacific Area, on its creation on 18 April 1942.
