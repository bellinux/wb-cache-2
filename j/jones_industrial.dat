5|$|At {{one time}} the second largest steel {{producer}} in the USA, TCI was listed on the first Dow <b>Jones</b> <b>Industrial</b> Average in 1896. However, in 1907, the company was merged with its principal rival, the United States Steel Corporation. The Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company was subsequently operated as a subsidiary of U. S. Steel for 45 years until it became a division of its parent company in 1952.|$|E
5|$|The attacks had a {{significant}} economic impact on United States and world markets. The stock exchanges did not open on September 11 and remained closed until September 17. Reopening, the Dow <b>Jones</b> <b>Industrial</b> Average (DJIA) fell 684points, or 7.1%, to 8921, a record-setting one-day point decline. By {{the end of the}} week, the DJIA had fallen 1,369.7points (14.3%), at the time its largest one-week point drop in history. In 2001 dollars, U.S. stocks lost $1.4 trillion in valuation for the week.|$|E
5|$|When U.S. President Andrew Jackson {{allowed the}} charter of the Second Bank of the United States to expire in 1836, the U.S. was without any sort of central bank, and the money supply in New York City fluctuated with the country's annual {{agricultural}} cycle. Each autumn money flowed out of the city as harvests were purchased and—in an effort to attract money back—interest rates were raised. Foreign investors then sent their money to New York {{to take advantage of the}} higher rates. From the January 1906 Dow <b>Jones</b> <b>Industrial</b> Average high of 103, the market began a modest correction that would continue throughout the year. The April 1906 earthquake that devastated San Francisco contributed to the market instability, prompting an even greater flood of money from New York to San Francisco to aid reconstruction. A further stress on the money supply occurred in late 1906, when the Bank of England raised its interest rates, partly in response to UK insurance companies paying out so much to US policyholders, and more funds remained in London than expected. From their peak in January, stock prices declined 18% by July 1906. By late September, stocks had recovered about half of their losses.|$|E
5|$|The Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company's {{status was}} bolstered {{when it became}} one of the first 12 {{companies}} to be listed on the inaugural Dow <b>Jones</b> <b>Industrial</b> Average, compiled in May 1896. However, it was not long before TCI was eclipsed by its principal competitor, the United States Steel Corporation, a huge conglomerate formed in 1901 out of the enormous Carnegie and Federal steel empires. By the time of the Panic of 1907, U. S. Steel felt confident enough to launch a takeover bid of its Southern rival. On the morning of Saturday November 2, banker and tycoon J. P. Morgan, one of the founders of U. S. Steel, convened a meeting in his library and there suggested that U. S. Steel purchase the stock of an insolvent Wall Street brokerage firm, Moore and Schley, which had secured huge loans against 6 million TCI shares. This was not an entirely selfish gesture, as Morgan recognised that the failure of Moore and Schley would send investor confidence in the markets into a nose-dive. E. H. Gary, president of U. S. Steel, agreed in principle to this transaction, yet argued that without careful political maneuvering the deal would be seen by Congress as an effort to create a monopoly and thereby encounter troublesome federal anti-trust litigation. Morgan himself had been burnt by crusading Washington trust-busters in 1902 when his Northern Securities Company had been forcibly broken up by the government in a landmark test case.|$|E

25|$|Foreign leaders {{reacted with}} both {{positive}} and mixed messages. Most world leaders congratulated and praised Barack Obama on his re-election victory.

By his inauguration, however, the markets had gained back all the losses and a bull run began that culminated in 2015 when the Dow closed at an all-time high of 18,312, the NASDAQ reached the milestone of 5,210, and the S 500 peaked at a record 2,130.|$|E
25|$|The {{company began}} by mining stone from {{quarries}} {{for use in}} grinding wheels.

By 1929, 3M had made its first moves toward international expansion by forming Durex to conduct business in Europe. The same year, the company's stock was first traded over the counter and in 1946 listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The company is currently {{a component of the}} Dow <b>Jones</b> <b>Industrial</b> Average and of the S 500.|$|E
25|$|The Standard & Poor's500, often {{abbreviated}} as the S 500, or {{just the}} S, is an American stock market index based on the market capitalizations of 500 large companies having common stock listed on the NYSE or NASDAQ. The S 500 index components and their weightings are determined by S Dow Jones Indices. It differs from other U.S. stock market indices, such as the Dow <b>Jones</b> <b>Industrial</b> Average or the Nasdaq Composite index, because of its diverse constituency and weighting methodology. It {{is one of the}} most commonly followed equity indices, and many consider it one of the best representations of the U.S. stock market, and a bellwether for the U.S. economy. The National Bureau of Economic Research has classified common stocks as a leading indicator of business cycles.|$|E
25|$|On March 23, 2009, the S 500 {{marked a}} 20% gain {{when it hit}} 822.92. The Dow <b>Jones</b> <b>Industrial</b> Average soon followed.

25|$|Leveraged {{exchange-traded}} funds (LETFs or leveraged ETFs) are {{a type of}} ETF {{that attempt}} to achieve returns that are more sensitive to market movements than non-leveraged ETFs. Leveraged index ETFs are often marketed as bull or bear funds. A leveraged bull ETF fund might for example attempt to achieve daily returns that are 2x or 3x more pronounced than the Dow <b>Jones</b> <b>Industrial</b> Average or the S 500. A leveraged inverse (bear) ETF fund {{on the other hand}} may attempt to achieve returns that are -2x or -3x the daily index return, meaning that it will gain double or triple the loss of the market. Leveraged ETFs require the use of financial engineering techniques, including the use of equity swaps, derivatives and rebalancing, and re-indexing to achieve the desired return. The most common way to construct leveraged ETFs is by trading futures contracts.|$|E
25|$|Negative {{economic}} {{effects were}} seen {{throughout the region}} after the test.

The Japanese and Taiwanese stock exchanges were closed for a market holiday {{on the day of}} the test. The Japanese yen also fell to a seven-month low against the United States dollar while oil on the world market rose above US$60 a barrel. Gold prices rose 1% as a safe haven investment. Several stock markets in Asia from the Singapore Exchange to the Philippine Stock Exchange have traded lower, possibly due to the tests. American stock markets were mixed, with the Dow <b>Jones</b> <b>Industrial</b> Average down at its open the next day; however, at 10:30am EDT, the Dow rebounded and concluded the day with an increase of 7.60 points (+0.06%). NSE and BSE of India, however, showed some strength.|$|E
25|$|The {{performance}} of gold bullion is often compared to stocks as different investment vehicles. Gold is regarded {{by some as}} a store of value (without growth) whereas stocks are regarded as a return on value (i.e., growth from anticipated real price increase plus dividends). Stocks and bonds perform best in a stable political climate with strong property rights and little turmoil. The attached graph shows the value of Dow <b>Jones</b> <b>Industrial</b> Average divided by the price of an ounce of gold. Since 1800, stocks have consistently gained value in comparison to gold {{in part because of the}} stability of the American political system. This appreciation has been cyclical with long periods of stock outperformance followed by long periods of gold outperformance. The Dow Industrials bottomed out a ratio of 1:1 with gold during 1980 (the end of the 1970s bear market) and proceeded to post gains throughout the 1980s and 1990s. The gold price peak of 1980 also coincided with the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan and the threat of the global expansion of communism. The ratio peaked on January 14, 2000 a value of 41.3 and has fallen sharply since.|$|E
