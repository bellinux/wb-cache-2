40|$|OBJECTIVE:To {{identify}} variables {{associated with}} rejection of synthetic, suburethral slings used for female {{stress urinary incontinence}}. METHODS:Between 1991 and 1998, gynecologists at our department performed 428 operations for stress urinary incontinence by inserting <b>expanded</b> polytetrafluoroethylene or <b>polyethylene</b> suburethral slings. After suitable exclusions, 386 women followed for at least 24 months after surgery remained for analysis. Of the 386 women, 47 (12. 2 %) had graft rejection or symptoms associated with rejection within 24 months after surgery, which led to later removal. We compared cases and controls using logistic regression analyses with forward selection to identify independent risk factors and risk markers for rejection. RESULTS:The rejection rate declined sharply during the years 1993 - 1994 after introduction of routines that included preoperative prophylactic antibiotics active against anaerobes and repeated preoperative treatment of the vagina with chlorhexidine acetate. After adjusting for potentially confounding variables, surgery after 1993, the gynecologist performing the procedure, and adequate antibiotic prophylaxis remained significantly associated with a lower rejection rate. There was no significant association between rejection and sling material, age at surgery, year of surgery (in one year steps), or concomitant prolapse surgery. CONCLUSION:Rejection of suburethral slings might be associated with bacterial contamination of the graft, and the rate was decreased with prophylactic antibiotics a repeated and vaginal disinfection...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The {{disadvantaged}} {{people in}} South Africa are unfortunate {{by virtue of}} their financial status. It was estimated in 1992 that 20 % of the South African population live in informal settlements. The houses in these settlements are found to be very energy inefficient. This study was aimed at developing low cost thermal insulating materials {{that can be used to}} increase energy efficiency of the houses in these informal settlements. This was done by firstly studying the properties of thermal insulation materials. Furthermore, common thermal insulating materials in South Africa were studied and evaluated. Only recycled polymeric based materials were examined for selecting the raw materials that were used to investigate the feasibility of the thermal insulating materials from waste material. The experimental work was extended to construct a thermal conductivity rig that was to be used in measuring the thermal conductivity of both the developed and existing thermal insulating materials. The expanded polystyrene obtained from Sagex (Pty) Ltd and polyester obtained from Isotherm (Pty) Ltd. were evaluated and compared to the manufactured recycled polymer slabs and <b>expanded</b> <b>polyethylene</b> foams (EPEF). <b>Expanded</b> <b>polyethylene</b> foam and recycled polymer slab samples were subjected to mechanical and physical testing. A temperature comparison test and thermal conductivity determination were conducted on both the <b>expanded</b> <b>polyethylene</b> foam (EPEF) and recycled polymer slab (RPS) samples. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to reveal the micro-structures of all the developed thermal insulating material samples. The expanded polystyrene and polyester thermal insulating materials were also examined using the SEM. Optical microscopy was only used on RPS samples. It was found in this research, that the properties that govern the viability of thermal insulating materials are: thermal conductivity (k-value), thermal resistance (R-value), combustibility, moisture absorption and the presence of hazardous gases during burning. The temperature comparison test showed that the recycled polymer slab (RPS) and <b>expanded</b> <b>polyethylene</b> foam (EPEF) retards the flow of heat to levels comparable to that of the locally obtained thermal insulation. The comparative cut bar method was found to be relatively cheap to design and it was ideal for the measurement of the thermal conductivity of polymeric based materials. The k-value of all the EPEF samples was measured to be around 0. 04 W. m-¹K-¹ and the RPS k-value was found to be 0. 05 W. m-¹K-¹. This is attributed to air pockets with lower conductivities values, found within the structure of the polymeric thermal insulating materials. The porous structure is evident from the SEM micrographs of both the EPEF and RPS samples. One grade of <b>expanded</b> <b>polyethylene</b> foam, the SPX 80, had accumulated less moisture when moisture absorption was compared with other EPEF samples. The RPS material did have a propensity for absorption of water. The flammability retardant tests have showed that gypsum board has to be incorporated during service for the RPS and SPX 80. The mechanical testing results also suggest that both the EPEF and RPS need to be supported when installed in a ceiling, for example...|$|E

This work addresses the influence of porosity and cell shape on the dielectric properties of expanded PE. Foams were produced using a single-screw extruder with a slit die. Dielectric spectroscopy revealed improving dielectric properties with increasing porosity at both medium frequencies (34 kHz) and high frequencies (11. 2 GHz). The cells were elongated and flat which in combination with increasing porosity resulted in a transition from a parallel equivalent circuit to a series equivalent circuit at about 28 % porosity...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. To {{evaluate}} quantitatively {{the performance}} of cushioning materials, a cushion curve is indispensable. However, the desired cushioning effect may sometimes be absent when we use the cushion curve to design a transport package. In addition, to plot the cushion curve, massive dynamic compression tests are traditionally necessary. Thus, large amounts of labor and material resources are required. Therefore, we used <b>expanded</b> <b>polyethylene</b> and laminated-board cushion as test materials to represent typical cushioning materials, and proposed simplified performance evaluation methods based on certain dynamic compression tests. An analysis of the experimental results showed that to obtain a more accurate packaging design, the shearing effect {{must be taken into}} account when using the cushion curve; For both plastic and paper cushions, new proposed performance evaluation methods significantly reduce the number of dynamic compression tests needed to accurately evaluate an actual packaging design...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, as a {{consequence}} of higher market prices for cork and of the qualitative problems created by natural stoppers, the demand for alternative seals has increased remarkably. Since 1990, numerous manufacturers of plastic materials have begun production of synthetic stoppers for the closure of wine bottles. The application of the first experimental products was highly unsatisfactory and showed the need to carry out more research into the characterisation of the materials employed and their interaction with the “matrix wine”. The object {{of this study was to}} estimate the mechanical characteristics of a particular kind of synthetic stopper and to compare the physico-chemical profiles of different Italian wines bottled with corks, or with synthetic stoppers made of <b>expanded</b> <b>polyethylene,</b> during the wine conservation phase. Analytical and statistical data produced give assurance that for these wine types, the employment of the synthetic stopper helps to increase the shelf-life of wines ready to consume within 1 – 2 years after bottling...|$|E
40|$|In some microelectronic products, one {{or several}} {{components}} can be idealized as {{simply supported beam}} type and viewed as vulnerable elements or critical component {{due to the fact}} that they are destroyed easily under impact loadings. The composite cushioning structure made of <b>expanded</b> <b>polyethylene</b> (EPE), and expanded polystyrene (EPS) was utilized to protect the vulnerable elements against impact loadings during transportation. The vibration equations of composite cushioning system were deducted and virtual mass method was applied to predict impact behavior of critical component. Numerical results indicate that virtual mass method is appropriate for computing impact response of composite cushioning system with vulnerable element of simply supported beam type, which is affirmed by the fact that the impact responses of structure element in terms of velocity- and displacement-time curves are almost unchanged when virtual mass is smaller than a certain value. The results in this paper make it possible for installation of packaging optimization design...|$|E
40|$|The {{advantages}} of glass fiber reinforced composites (FRP) and SIPs (structural insulated panels) are combined, {{and a new}} type of sandwich panel called composite structural insulated panels (CSIPs) is proposed. Through the adhesive bonding, CSIPs are made of FRP as face sheets and <b>expanded</b> <b>polyethylene</b> foam (EPS) as a core. To master the mechanical characteristics of CSIPs, firstly, adopting the large deflection theory of Reissener in this paper derived the calculation formula of displacement and the stability critical load of CSIPs. Then, ANSYS software was used to carry on the analysis of finite element simulation. Finally, a testing piece of CSIP with length 1000 mm and breath 1000 mm was made and a test was done. The results show that the theoretical analysis results, finite element simulation results and test results are basically coincide. So the calculating formula of deformation and bearing capacity of CSIPs are correct. And CSIPs have the outstanding {{advantages of}} light weight and high strength...|$|E
40|$|The {{steam-chest}} {{molding process}} {{can be used to}} prepare molded bead foams, including expandable polystyrene (EPS), <b>expanded</b> <b>polyethylene</b> (EPE), expanded polypropylene (EPP), and expanded polylactide (EPLA) with complex three-dimensional shapes. A new thermoplastic elastomer bead foam, which is described as expanded thermoplastic polyurethane (ETPU), now exists. Notably, it has an excellent soft touch quality and is ductile. It has also generated widespread interest in both the academic and industrial communities. In this study, three types of ETPU foams with various sample sizes were steam-chest molded. We concentrated on the preparation of the molded ETPU (METPU), which was followed by a mechanical test. Our morphological observations showed that the ETPU bead foams' interfaces had effectively bonded. A high tensile strength of 1. 80 MPa and an elongation at break of 360. 1 % were reached in the METPU sample with a density of 0. 35 g/cm(3). A 200 -fold cyclic compression measurement verified that the compressed METPU sample could recover more than 95 % both in stress and modulus, after 6 days of relaxation. This suggested the presence of excellent interbead bonding in the ETPU bead foams. Based on the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results, we proposed that a formation mechanism for interbead bonding during the ETPU steam-molding process existed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
