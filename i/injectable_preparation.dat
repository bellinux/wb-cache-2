40|$|In {{addition}} to the control of symptoms associated with arthritis, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) can be administered to relieve acute pain (Kantor, 1982). Although effective {{in the management of}} mild to moderate pain (Miller, 1981), there are conflicting reports as to the ability of NSAIDs to control postoperative pain. For example, several studies suggest that analgesia provided by an <b>injectable</b> <b>preparation</b> of acetyl salicylate is similar to that provided by parenteral morphine (Kweekel-De Vries et al., 1974; Cash-man et al., 1985; Jones et al., 1985).

40|$|Sulodexide is {{a highly}} {{purified}} glycosaminoglycan approved for leg ulcers treatment. It contains two principal components: heparan sulfate, a fast-moving heparin fraction, (80 %) and dermatan sulfate (20 %). Sulodexide is available as an oral agent and as an <b>injectable</b> <b>preparation.</b> Its pharmacological action is obtained by dose-dependent coagulation factors inhibition: dermatan sulfate upgrades the physiological action of a selective thrombin inhibitor, heparin cofactor II, and heparan sulfate depresses activated factor X, via an increase of antithrombin III action.

Percutaneous {{autologous}} bone marrow injection (PABMI) encourages early treatment of delayed union and non-union to expedite healing and minimize complications from prolong immobilization. Aims and objectives: To assess the outcome of PABMI treatment in delayed and non-union of long bones. Study design: Prospective study Participants and procedures: 24 cases (33 bones) of Delayed and non-union of long bones were selected. Percutaneous autologous bone marrow injection treatment was adopted for fracture healing. Change in pattern of union was followed after 12 weeks by clinical and radiological study. Results: 90 % of tibial fractures, 66. 66 % of radial fractures and 50 % of ulna fractures show clinical and radiological union. 100 % of the fractures with no gap at the fracture site united, where the gap was less than 1 cm, 85 % of bone united, in only 1 case the gap was more than 1 cm and it failed to unite. 7 out of 9 bones in hypertrophic non-union united, whereas 4 out of 6 bones in atrophic non-union united.

To obtain an injectable form, we lyophilized and dissolved d-ECM in pepsin solution as previously reported. Although we scrupulously followed the described methodology, d-ECM did not dissolve. Adjustments were made until, with a treatment of 24 h at 37 °C on tube rotator, d-ECM dissolved. It is reported that d-ECM-pepsin solution spontaneously gels at 37 °C in about 1 h.

Aim: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of topical methotrexate iontophoresis in comparison with coal tar ointment {{in the treatment of}} palmoplantar psoriasis. Methods: Thirty-one patients with palmar and/or plantar psoriasis were selected for the study and 28 patients completed it. The side having more severe involvement was treated while the other palm/sole served as a control.

In a previous study we demonstrated that injections of TU every 6 weeks resulted in satisfactory substitution but a tendency toward testosterone accu-mulation. Here we investigate prolonged TU treatment at extended injection intervals in 7 hypogonadal men. Injections were given at gradually increasing intervals between the fifth and 10 th injection, and from then on every 12 weeks. Steady state kinetics were ob-tained after the 13 th injection. Well-being, sexual activity, clinical chemistry, prostate volume, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and serum hormone levels were monitored. Patients were clinically well-adjusted throughout the study. Before the next injection, testoster-one, dihydrotestosterone, and estradiol levels were mostly within the normal range and showed a tendency to decrease with increasing injection intervals. Body weight, hemoglobin, serum lipids, PSA, and prostate volume did not change significantly during the 3. 2 years of treatment. PSA levels were always within the normal limit. Maximal testosterone levels during steady state kinetics were measured after 1 week with 32. 0 6 11. 7 nmol/L (mean 6 SD).

It was necessary to first develop and validate a robust HPLC analytical technique to detect tilmicosin in a variety of equine tissues. The methodology was fully validated in plasma and lung with LODs of 13 ng/mL and 181 ng/g respectively. In a preliminary trial, we administered tilmicosin to recently weaned foals at a dose of 4 mg/kg PO sid or 10 mg/kg SC q 72 hrs. The oral dose did not result in detectable tissue concentrations of tilmicosin. The pharmacokinetics of the injectable dose were similar to previous reports in other species. The <b>injectable</b> <b>preparation</b> resulted in severe swelling at the site of injection associated with edema and tissue necrosis. Otherwise, tilmicosin was well tolerated by the foals and no foals developed severe colitis. However, a semi-quantitative fecal bacteriological technique demonstrated marked changes in the normal fecal flora, with profound overgrowth of the Enterbacteriacae and almost complete removal of the normal â-hemolytic streptococci population. No known pathogens were isolated from the feces. In a subsequent study, we investigated the administration of higher doses of oral tilmicosin to unweaned foals to simulate treatment of R. equi. A dose of 40 mg/kg PO sid resulted in detectable plasma concentrations of tilmicosin. Foals were treated at this dose regimen for 2 weeks and sequentially euthanized. Tissue analysis demonstrated concentrations of tilmicosin in tissues similar to those seen with the 10 mg/kg sc dose with a Cmax of 4 µg/g in lung and a MRT which was shorter at 8. 8 hrs. The MIC 50 of R. equi to tilmicosin was 4 µg/g. Based on pharmacodynamic studies it appears that oral tilmicosin {{has the potential to be}} of use in the treatment of R. equi pneumonia in foals. No adverse clinical effects were noted in the foals; however, the fecal flora was again changed by tilmicosin administration. The fecal flora of the unweaned foals was different from that of the older animals with almost no â-haemolytic streptococci and a predominantly Gram negative flora. Disruption of the fecal flora did result in overgrowth of Cl. perfringens which was not associated with disease. In a final study, we compared the effects of tilmicosin and ceftiofur on the fecal flora of adult horses. The fecal flora of the horses receiving tilmicosin was severely disrupted in the same manner as the weaned foals with the added effect of overgrowth of Cl. perfringens. Ceftiofur which is widely regarded as being associated with antimicrobial associated diarrhea had very little effect on the fecal flora. It is concluded that oral tilmicosin shows potential for the treatment of R. equi pneumonia in young foals. However, care should be taken due to possibility of developing colitis. The drug’s use should be avoided in older horses due to the very real risk of developing acute bacterial colitis. The <b>injectable</b> <b>preparation</b> should not be used in horses due to the severity of the reaction at the injection site...|$|E

Folic acid has been {{employed as a}} targeting ligand of various anticancer agents to increase their cellular uptake within target cells since the folate receptor is overexpressed {{on the surface of}} such tumor cells. In this study, a novel biodegradable deoxycholic acid-O-carboxymethylated chitosan&ndash;folic acid conjugate (DOMC-FA) was used to form micelles for encapsulating the anticancer drug PTX. Methods and results: The drug-loading efficiency, encapsulation efficiency, in vitro drug release and physicochemical properties of PTX-loaded micelles were investigated in detail. In vitro cell culture studies were carried out in MCF- 7 cells, a human breast carcinoma cell line, with folate receptor overexpressed on its surface. An increased level of uptake of folate-conjugated micelles compared to plain micelles in MCF- 7 cells was observed, and the enhanced uptake of folate-micelles mainly on account of the effective process of folate receptor-mediated endocytosis. The MTT assay, morphological changes, and apoptosis test implied that the folate-conjugated micelles enhanced the cell death by folate-mediated active internalization, and the cytotoxicity of the FA-micellar PTX (DOMC-FA/PTX) to cancer cells was much higher than micelles without folate (DOMC/PTX) or the commercially available <b>injectable</b> <b>preparation</b> of PTX (Taxol). Conclusion: Results indicate that the PTX-loaded DOMC-FA micelle is a successful anticancer-targeted drug-delivery system for effective cancer chemotherapy.

40|$|A sensitive, precise, specific, linear, and stability-indicating {{gradient}} HPLC {{method was}} developed for the estimation of doripenem in active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and in <b>injectable</b> <b>preparations.</b> Chromatographic separation was achieved on C 18 stationary phase with a mobile phase gradient consisting of acetonitrile, methanol, and pH 5. 2 phosphate buffer. The mobile phase flow rate was 0. 8 [*]mL/min, and the eluted compounds were monitored at 210 [*]nm. The method is linear over the range of 0. 335 to 76. 129 [*]µg/mL. The correlation coefficient {{was found to be}} 0. 999. The numbers of theoretical plates and tailing factor for doripenem were 53021 and 0. 9, respectively. Doripenem was subjected to the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) prescribed hydrolytic (acid, base, and neutral), oxidative, photolytic, and thermal stress conditions. Among all the above-mentioned conditions, the drug was found to be stable under photolytic degradation. Peak homogeneity data for doripenem in the chromatograms from the stressed samples obtained by use of the photodiode array detector demonstrated the specificity of the method for analysis of doripenem in presence of the degradation products. The performance of the method was validated according to the present ICH guidelines for specificity, limit of detection, limit of quantification, linearity, accuracy, precision, and robustness...|$|R
40|$|Selenium (Se) {{deficiency}} occurs commonly in California grazing {{cattle and}} {{has been associated with}} reduced immune function and, in some studies, reduced weight gain. Multiple methods of supplementing Se are available, but little research has compared the effects of these methods on whole blood Se levels and weight gain. In two trials, we evaluated four methods of Se supplementation — an intrarumenal bolus, two <b>injectable</b> <b>preparations</b> and a loose salt containing 120 ppm Se — over an 85 - to 90 -day period in Se-deficient yearling cattle in Tehama County. The bolus treatment raised whole blood Se levels to an adequate level (0. 08 ppm) for the entire study period. Whole blood Se concentrations in injected cattle initially reached adequate levels but then declined to deficient levels. The loose salt treatment acted slowly, with average whole blood Se concentration reaching adequate levels {{at the end of the}} study period. None of the treatments significantly affected weight gain and Se blood concentration was not correlated with weight gain. In growing cattle, it appears that Se supplementation may be viewed not as a direct driver of weight gain, but rather as similar to vaccination, in that it can prevent health problems that might otherwise lead to reduced weight gain...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Other <b>injectable</b> <b>preparations</b> than {{parenteral}} nutrition admixture and injectable cytotoxic drugs could be prepared by Centralised IntraVenous Admixture Service (CIVAS) if the Long-term {{stability of the}} drugs is known. However, this information is not always available. PURPOSE: To develop a program of chemical drug stability analysis in collaboration between Hospital Pharmacy, Medical Laboratory and Scientific Support Unit to determine the long-term stability of largely used injectable anti-infectious and non-anti-infectious drugs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: After a setup of the High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLCI method, 28 drugs were reconstituted in laminar air flow hood, 17 of them stored directly at 5 +/- 3 degrees C and 19 stored in the freezer at - 20 degrees C, thawed by microwave following a standardised procedure and stored at 5 +/- 3 degrees C before use. Concentration stability was evaluated by regression analysis. RESULTS: For each drug, long-term stability has varied from 11 days to 180 days. The freeze-thaw treatment by microwave may enhance the stability (from 30 to 120 days) and allow batch-scale production of intravenous drugs, less expensive in term of manpower and sterile device than a drug reconstitution at the ward. The results were published by 55 posters in international congress and by 36 publications in national and international pharmaceutical journals. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings contribute to enhance the scale of drugs that may be take on by a CIVAS...|$|R
