The resultant improvements in power quality in homes and in schools {{are associated with}} fewer and less severe headaches, more energy, lower blood sugar levels for diabetics, and improved balance for those with multiple sclerosis. Results are observed {{within a matter of}} hours or days. Cases studies for blood sugar, multiple sclerosis, and general wellbeing are presented...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In this paper, we {{simulated}} series arc on electric heaters, {{vacuum cleaners}} and incandescent lamps {{controlled by a}} dimmer to analyze the characteristics of series arc that causes electric fires. A high pass filter (HPF) was designed to detect arc signal only. The HPF consists of 2 -stage coupling capacitors and detection impedance, and its low cut-off frequency of- 3 dB was estimated to 3 kHz. By using the HPF, we could detect high frequency components included in AC voltage and discriminate series arc signals on most types of loads used in low-voltage <b>indoor</b> <b>wiring</b> systems...|$|E
40|$|This master’s thesis {{tries to}} show the {{differences}} between usual obsolete <b>indoor</b> <b>wiring</b> and clas-sic <b>indoor</b> <b>wiring</b> used these days and also between this „classic“ <b>indoor</b> <b>wiring</b> and „intelligent wiring“. There is insisted on selection and optimalization of the adequate system for a concrete building and there is made a question of specifications of the user or the customer, his preferen-ces (financial, space, family etc.), disadvantages and advantages of the current system. Whereas it’s impossible to satisfy all the users in these problems by reason of diversity of the buildings (it {{can be a lot}} of variants of family houses or small apartments), the systems in this thesis are ap-plied only on the most frequent types of houses. Quite lot of firms deal in this country with indo-or wiring, the most known are ABB, ELKO EP and Moeller. Each of these firms offers different alternatives of systems. From the simplest, basic alternative, to most sophisticated „intelligent“ systems, which can care about almost everything, what is common with electrical energy. These different systems, their review, advantages and disadvantages are also presented in this work. Preliminary there is analysed the whole issue from the historical view and there is briefly explai-ned, what the system wiring is. In the next chapter there is a complex description of the actual state of known firms and systems on the present-day market in our country and in the world. The-re is also summarised the basic structure and the overall comparison of the most frequently used bus systems. In the next two chapters there are presented the main objectives of this work and the methods and procedures, how to achieve these objectives. The central part of this work is the next to last chapter, in which there are presented the different model variants of the project, applied to the real residential building - middle-sized family house. That is realized {{on the basis of the}} spe-cified requirements on the designed system. Before that there was performed the complex design of the situation scheme of all usual electrical appliances and lighting system in the house. In the end the whole work is in summary analysed, mainly in term of costs of each variant of the pro-ject. By virtue of this can the reader make a better view about the whole financial problem of the system wiring, that means, how much he has to invest in his concrete wiring. In the end of the work there is attached the detailed documentation to all alternatives of the project, such as dra-wings (complex horizontal plans) and costs budget of all used items and the wiring material...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- Lightning surge damages of {{low voltage}} {{equipments}} in building are increasing due {{to increase in}} electrical and communication networks in the information-oriented society. And electrical circuits with semiconductor are very weak against lightning surge. To achieve effective method of surge protection on low voltage lines, there are needs {{for the relationship between}} propagation aspects of lightning surge and arrangement of <b>indoor</b> <b>wire.</b> This paper describes the experimental study on the relationship between them. This result may be raw data for establishment of surge protection system...|$|R
40|$|The {{impressive}} market {{spread of}} IEEE 802. 11 based wireless local area networks (WLAN) calls for quantitative approaches {{in the network}} planning procedure. It is common belief that such networks {{have the potential to}} replace traditional <b>indoor</b> <b>wired</b> local networks and allow flexible access outdoors, eventually competing with classical cellular systems (GSM, GPRS, UMTS, etc.). The appropriate positioning of the access points (AP) is crucial to determining the network effectiveness. In a companion paper we argue that previously proposed approaches to coverage planning neglect the features of the IEEE 802. 11 access mechanism, which limits system capacity when access point coverage areas overlap. We describe the optimization models with hyperbolic and quadratic objective functions that directly accounts system capacity and we propose heuristics combining greedy and local search phases. Computational results show that our heuristics provide near-optimal solutions within a reasonable amount of time...|$|R

The hospital treated hundreds of French wounded, many of them African soldiers. As the hospital thrived, Bartlett resigned from her administrative duties for reasons unclear, then embarked on a popular lecture tour to raise further funds for war relief.|$|R
40|$|This {{prototype}} is {{a continuation}} of a series of wireless prototypes which began in August 2001 and was reported on again in August 2002. This is the final year of this prototype. This con-tinuation allowed Saint Francis University’s Center of Excellence for Remote and Medically Under-Served Areas (CERMUSA) to refine the existing WLAN for the Saint Francis University (SFU) campus and attempted to show if computer modeling software was a legitimate tool for designing wireless campuses. The prototype was divided into two distinct divisions. The first portion of the prototype con-sisted of verifying that the access points were located in optimal locations on the SFU campus. Previous wireless prototypes consisted of doing base wiring of the SFU campus. The second current portion of the prototype consisted of wiring the greenspaces of the campus, and testing “leaky wire ” antenna technology as a viable option for <b>indoor</b> <b>wiring</b> applications. For the 2003 - 2004 funding year, the testing of the greenspaces on the SFU campus was the main thrust of the research. Additionally, experiments were done with various wireless technologies.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to test the effect of the Graham/Stetzer microsurge filters on the {{wellbeing}} of teachers and on the behavior of their students in a private school (grades 1 to 12) in Toronto, Canada. GS filters remove electromagnetic frequencies from 4 to 100 kHz on <b>indoor</b> <b>wiring</b> and they were installed in this school because one of the students is electrically sensitive. Teachers were asked in a single blind study to complete a questionnaire daily between January and March 2003 for a 6 -week period (3 weeks with and 3 weeks without filters). Eighteen teachers out of 49 completed the questionnaire enough times to enable statistical analysis. Symptoms improved for 55 % of the teachers and got worse for 11 % of the teachers while the filters were installed. Three teachers (16 %) had no response to the filters and another three (16 %) had mixed reactions (some symptoms improved and some got worse). Overall teacher wellbeing improved while the filters were in place. Teachers were less frustrated, less tired, less irritable. They were better able to focus and had better health, improved mood, and greater sense of accomplishment. Student response appeared to be age-specific with younger students responding more favorably than older students. This preliminary study needs to be repeated in other schools. If the Graham/Stetzer filters are as effective as they appear to be, then the dirty electricity in schools, homes, and offices can be reduced until other methods are in place to minimize the production and distribution of this form of electrical pollution...|$|E
40|$|In home {{networks}} advanced communication technologies {{has allowed}} the Power Line Communication (PLC) channel to be a transmission medium that enables the transferring of high-speed digital data over the classical <b>indoor</b> electrical <b>wires.</b> Nowadays, the increase of the customer's demand in terms of services leads {{to the fact that}} the 200 Mbps theoretical rates of the Homeplug AV specification are no still sufficient for transferring Internet, voice, HD videos, and data services simultaneously through the electrical support, especially as real data merely exceed 70 Mbps. This paper deals with an Electromagnetic Compatibility analysis and throughput calculation of the PLC systems. The frequency band up to 30 MHz, characterizing actual PLC modems, is here pushed up to 100 MHz. The investigation is aimed to take into account the EMC constraints in order to increase PLC throughputs by extending the frequency band above 30 MHz...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{portable}} system to record synchronised, multi-video data for vision {{applications such as}} 3 D reconstruction and video-based rendering of dynamic scenes. The aim of the project is {{to gain access to}} a greater number of scenes than what a static, <b>wired</b> <b>indoor</b> studio allows for. The portable acquisition system is constructed from a number of independent modules, each consisting of a FireWire camera and a laptop. Our software utilises wireless networking making the system behave like a tightly coupled unit without requiring the modules to be physically connected to each other. The scheme also includes an external calibration method suitable for general scenes. The system is scalable and allows for easy transportation and adhoc setup and configuration. We present recent results acquired in the field and their use for free-viewpoint video...|$|R
40|$|Non-ionizing {{radiation}} (NIR) is {{the term}} given to radiation {{in the part of}} the electromagnetic spectrum that does not have enough energy to ionize atoms or molecules directly. The NIR includes electric and magnetic fields up to 300 GHz, infrared, visible, and ultraviolet radiation (UV). People are exposed to non-ionizing radiation by several man-made sources every day. From highest to lowest energy, this includes for example microwave ovens, cell phones, baby monitors, cordless phones, garage-door openers etc. Extremely low frequency (ELF) waves are produced by high voltage power lines and <b>indoor</b> electrical <b>wiring</b> systems. Radiofrequency (RF) waves can cause tissue heating at high intensities. Some forms of non-ionizing radiation can induce damage of tissues if exposed to high intensity fields. For instance, exposure to ultraviolet light from the sun for a prolonged period of time is known to cause skin cancers (Narayanan et al., 2010); even moderate amounts can cause skin burns. There is a big concern amongst the public and authorities regarding possible adverse health effects from exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMFs), in particular the radiation generated by power lines and wireless communication devices. In 2002 the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) concluded that extremely low frequency magnetic fields (from power lines) are possibly carcinogenic (Group 2 B of IARC classification). The same conclusion was reached in 2011 with respect to radiofrequency fields from mobile phones. UVB and UVA radiation has been classified by IARC as Group I: the agent is carcinogenic to humans. It is therefore not surprising that a lot of research was (and still is) devoted to the investigation of biological effects of non-ionizing radiation. In many cases the link has been established between genotoxicity and carcinogenicity and the possibility that non-ionising radiations including EMFs are carcinogenic so it follows that studies on the mutagenicity and genotoxicity of such agents are also important issues. In our laboratory we use comet assay for testing genotoxicity of non-ionizing radiation for more than ten years. In the experiments we use whole blood samples (human or dog), cell lines (e. g. H 295 R cell line) or 3 dimensional in vitro skin tissue (epidermis) models. In our protocol a slightly modified alkaline Comet assay method of Singh et al. (1988) is used. On our poster there will be presented a brief summary of our experiments with exposure to different types of radiation (ELF, RF, and intermediate frequency). In our protocols the non-ionizing radiation was often combined with ionizing radiation to see whether the non-ionizing radiation can influence the repair of the DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation. For the evaluation of the slides mainly Komet 4. 0 image analysis system software (Kinetic Imaging, Liverpool, UK) was used, but as we got familiarized with other methods for slide evaluation like grading the comets by visual scoring into 5 categories or the CaspLab software, the comparison of these three methods will be also presented...|$|R
