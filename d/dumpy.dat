25|$|Pomona Sprout is Professor of Herbology and the Head of Hufflepuff House. She is {{described}} as a <b>dumpy</b> little witch with flyaway grey hair who wears a patched, frayed hat and shabby robes, often covered in dirt due to the time she spends tending plants in the Hogwarts greenhouses. Sprout is introduced in Philosopher's Stone, but she plays no active role until Chamber of Secrets, in which she teaches her second year students to work with Mandrake plants. She is responsible for raising the Mandrakes to full maturity, at which point their juice is used to revive the petrified victims of the basilisk.|$|E

500|$|... "How About a Friendly Shrink?" [...] {{received}} generally mixed reviews. Gerrick Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times {{praised the}} episode and was particularly {{excited by the}} guest appearance by Jane Leeves. She called the subplot between Gaby and Susan was [...] "cute, but honest", but felt the Orson and Katherine characters have [...] "run their course". Entertainment Weekly writer Tanner Stransky declared the reappearance of Katherine Mayfair was the only interesting element of the episode, {{and that it was}} touching to see her realize the damage she had done. Stransky wrote, [...] "The rest of the story lines from last night just kind of sat there rather limply," [...] and said the Orson and Bree story, and Tom and Lynette's therapy, [...] "just seemed so <b>dumpy</b> for this once-sexy show".|$|E
500|$|Thinner {{than most}} of the other men who have portrayed Edna, Travolta {{appeared}} onscreen in a large fat suit, and required four hours of makeup in order to appear before the cameras. His character's nimble dancing style belies her girth; Shankman based Edna's dancing style on the hippo ballerinas in the Dance of the Hours sequence in Walt Disney's 1940 animated feature, Fantasia. Although early versions of the suit created [...] "a <b>dumpy,</b> Alfred Hitchcock version of Edna," [...] Travolta fought for the ability to give his character curves and a thick Baltimore accent. Designed by Tony Gardner, the fat suit was created using lightweight synthetic materials, consisting of layered pads and silicone, which was used from the chest upwards. The suit provided the additional benefit of covering Travolta's beard, eliminating the problem of his facial hair growing through his makeup midday.|$|E
500|$|The common {{chiffchaff}} is a small, <b>dumpy,</b> 10–12centimetres (4in) long leaf warbler. [...] The male weighs 7–8grammes (0.28–0.31oz), and {{the female}} 6–7grammes (0.25–0.28oz). The spring adult of the western nominate subspecies [...] P. c. collybita has brown-washed dull green upperparts, off-white underparts becoming yellowish on the flanks, and a short whitish supercilium. It has dark legs, a fine dark bill, and short primary projection (extension of the flight feathers beyond the folded wing). As the plumage wears, it gets duller and browner, and the yellow on the flanks tends to be lost, but after the breeding season there is a prolonged complete moult before migration. The newly fledged juvenile is browner above than the adult, with yellow-white underparts, but moults about 10 weeks after acquiring its first plumage. After moulting, both the adult and the juvenile have brighter and greener upperparts and a paler supercilium.|$|E
50|$|British biker rock band, <b>Dumpy's</b> Rusty Nuts, {{released}} a single called 'Boxhill or Bust' {{in the early}} 1980s. The song {{is something of a}} cult anthem for bikers, and reflects the popularity of Box Hill amongst the biking community.|$|R

500|$|In the ambush, Troilus and Polyxena {{approach}} a fountain where Achilles lies in wait. This scene was familiar {{enough in the}} ancient world for a parody to exist from c.400BC showing a <b>dumpy</b> Troilus leading a mule to the fountain. In most serious depictions of the scene, Troilus rides a horse, normally with a second next to him. He is usually, but not always, portrayed as a beardless youth. He is often shown naked; otherwise he wears a cloak or tunic. Achilles is always armed and armoured. Occasionally, as on the vase picture at [...] , or the fresco from the Tomb of the Bulls shown at the head of this article, either Troilus or Polyxena is absent, indicating how the ambush is linked to each of their stories. In the earliest definitely identified version of this scene, (a Corinthian vase c.580BC), Troilus is bearded and Priam is also present. Both these features are unusual. More common is a bird sitting on the fountain; normally a raven, symbol of Apollo and his prophetic powers and thus a final warning to Troilus of his doom; sometimes a cock, a common love gift suggesting that Achilles attempted to seduce Troilus. In some versions, for example an Attic amphora in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston dating from c.530BC (seen here [...] ) Troilus has a dog running with him. On one Etruscan vase from the 6th century BC, doves are flying from Achilles to Troilus, suggestive of the love gift in Servius. The fountain itself is conventionally decorated with a lion motif.|$|E

They made a return visit to this festival on 3 August 1991, sharing the bill on the latter occasion with Hawkwind, Mama's Boys, Atom Seed and Marshall Law.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to this there are several unverifiable legends regarding Scots <b>Dumpies.</b> One of which relates to their use as ambush alarms by the Celts and Picts, and the claim {{that it was the}} bird’s superior hearing that enabled them to hear attackers responses to stepping on thistles, which in turn led to thistles being adopted as a Scottish emblem. Other tales tell of them being trained to crow by the hour, day or night.|$|R
2500|$|By {{the turn}} of the century, Vera Constantinova {{appeared}} small and <b>dumpy</b> with a fat, round face. She wore her hair very short, which gave her a masculine look.

5000|$|Pterostylis truncata, {{commonly}} known as the brittle greenhood or little <b>dumpies</b> is a species of orchid endemic to eastern Australia. It is easily distinguished from other greenhood orchids by its short habit and relatively large, [...] "dumpy", green, white and brown flowers. It is widespread and common in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory but is classed as [...] "endangered" [...] in Victoria due to habitat loss as a result of urbanisation.|$|R
50|$|Scotch <b>Dumpies</b> {{were first}} shown in London in 1852. It {{has been one}} of the rarest British breeds since the late 1800s. Other {{references}} to short-legged birds can go back to Columella where he states he does not approve of dwarf fowls. However, a common reference date of 1678 (as found in the British Poultry Standards) is almost certainly erroneous as this refers to Grigs in John Ray's The ornithology of Francis Willughby. These Grigs were bantam rather than dwarf fowl.|$|R
2500|$|Sabyasachi Mukherjee [...] made a {{debut in}} jewelry line with Guzaarish. He had {{designed}} the line {{keeping in mind}} a multicultural element with a nomadic vibe. Omar Siddiqui played by Aditya Roy Kapoor was styled like a struggling French musician. Suhel Seth, who played Ethan's doctor, is presented in stiff suits and Shernaz Patel, Ethan's lawyer is given a look of a Gandhian in cotton saris and three-quarter blouses. The maids are in <b>dumpy</b> dresses. The costume designer says that [...] "..the clothes are nearly theatrical {{and they have a}} mind of their own. If you remove the characters and hang the clothes, they will tell a story. It's like Neverland or the reality version of The Magic Faraway Tree!". The entire look of Rai consisted of thirty-seven long frocks, four <b>dumpy</b> shoes, maxis, aprons with motifs of cutlery, quirky glasses and jewelry, surreal hairdos and red lips. For the collection, Sabyasachi used precious and semi-precious stones, minakari and filigree and had to work with about 60 skilled workers from West Bengal to complete the line. The price range of rings and earrings starts from Rs. 40,000 and navratan necklaces are priced at Rs. 510,000. On the look of Ethan Mascarenhas, Mukherjee said that the make up and costume was more organic. On a lighter note he added that he wanted his hero to look like Clark Kent and not James bond.|$|E
2500|$|Only one {{architectural}} design {{drawn up by}} the Professor during the 1850s had led to a building being constructed. This was for an office for Messrs. Berens {{on the south side}} of Canon Street. Somewhat piqued, Hosking set out his concerns in a book: Some observations upon the recent addition of the Reading-room to the British Museum; with plans, sections and other illustrative documents (London: Stanford, 1858) that aimed to put the record straight from his perspective. In great detail it explained why this was an obvious case of plagiarism, and why, although some modification was needed since the competition as the dome was now to be for a reading room rather than a gallery, the result was poorer than it need be: [...] "How mean their <b>dumpy</b> dome-room is" [...] Hosking opined.|$|E

50|$|After the tour, drummer Thompson {{left the}} group. He was {{replaced}} by former <b>Dumpy's</b> Rusty Nuts drummer Mick Kirton for some September dates, but the group felt he was unsuitable. Richard Chadwick, a veteran drummer of groups involved with English free-festival scene, then joined for an 18 date UK tour in November and December. The Nottingham Rock City show on 7 December was recorded, and part released on Undisclosed Files Addendum (1995), with these tracks being included as bonus tracks on the 2010 re-issue.|$|R
50|$|In winter some {{care must}} be taken to {{distinguish}} this from other pipits that winter in the area, such as Richard's pipit, Anthus richardi and Blyth's pipit, Anthus godlewskii. The paddyfield pipit is smaller and <b>dumpier,</b> has a shorter looking tail and has weaker fluttering flight. The usually uttered characteristic chip-chip-chip call is quite different from usual calls of Richard's pipit (an explosive shreep) and Blyth's pipit (a nasal pschreen). The tawny pipit has less streaking on the mantle and has a black loreal stripe and a longer tail. The Western Ghats population can appear very similar to the Nilgiri pipit.|$|R
50|$|Formed in 1998 by drummer Gary Appleby, 9xDead {{underwent}} {{a number of}} line-up changes and released two well received albums on independent labels before splitting up in 2007.
