5|$|To have {{a chance}} of winning a competition, two {{consistently}} good jumps must be made. If an athlete finds themselves in an uncompetitive position after the first round, their challenge in the second round is to make up ground via the attrition of other athletes, their own distance and style points, and wind/gate compensation. For an athlete who had a poor jump in round one, it is possible for them to climb up the order in round two with an excellent jump, and if other competitors <b>fall</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> wayside. Conversely, a high-scoring athlete may lose their advantage from round one if their second jump is not up to par.|$|E

25|$|The massacres {{began in}} July 1941, {{as soon as}} SS Einsatzkommando 9 arrived in Vilna on 2 July 1941. Most of the actual killings were carried out by Ypatingasis burys (Special Platoon).

In the same month 3,700 Jews were shot in one action, and 6,000 in another, rounded up {{in the city and}} walked to Paneriai. Most victims were stripped before being shot. Further mass killings, often aided by Lithuanian commandos of Ypatingasis burys, took place throughout the summer and <b>fall.</b> <b>By</b> <b>the</b> end of the year, about 21,700 Vilna Jews had been killed at Ponary, men, women, and children.|$|E

500|$|The Allman Brothers Band was {{released}} in November 1969 through Atco and Capricorn Records. Atco was a subsidiary label of Atlantic Records, and Walden had not even created a logo for Capricorn Records; instead, the LP featured an Atco label with a [...] "barely noticeable" [...] line reading [...] "Capricorn Records Series." [...] The record received a poor commercial response, selling fewer than 35,000 copies upon initial release.

500|$|Evelyn Waugh, born in 1903, was {{the younger}} son of Arthur Waugh, the {{managing}} director of the London publishing firm of Chapman & Hall. After attending Lancing College and Hertford College, Oxford, Waugh taught for three years in a series of private preparatory schools before beginning his career as a writer. His first commercially printed work was a short story, [...] "The Balance", which Chapman and Hall included in a 1926 anthology. He worked briefly as a Daily Express reporter, and wrote a short biography of the pre-Raphaelite painter Dante Gabriel Rossetti before achieving success in 1928 with the publication of his comic novel, Decline and <b>Fall.</b> <b>By</b> <b>the</b> end of 1932 Waugh had written two further novels, Vile Bodies and Black Mischief, and two travel books. His professional successes coincided with private upheavals; in June 1928 he married Evelyn Gardner, but just over a year later the marriage ended when she declared her love for the couple's mutual friend John Heygate. Reconciliation proved impossible, and Waugh filed for divorce in September 1929. At the same time, Waugh was undergoing instruction which led to his reception, in September 1930, into the Roman Catholic Church.|$|E
500|$|A {{hamstring}} surgery forced Jackson {{out of the}} 2013 season, and {{she also}} missed the 2014 season after operating both her right knee and left Achilles in February. The final year of her Storm contract was suspended in 2013 and dissolved under the new collective-bargaining agreement signed in 2014, but Seattle still retained Jackson's rights. During her 2014 recovery, Jackson expressed interest in returning to Seattle in 2015, saying that despite so much time sidelined by injury, [...] "I've just had too good of a career there to let that <b>fall</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> wayside." [...] However, these hopes of returning to the WNBA and the Storm for the 2015 season were sidelined when Jackson had further surgery on her right knee {{in the spring of}} 2015. Her attentions turned to the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. However, in November 2015, Jackson announced that her rehabilitation had suffered a setback that would keep her from practicing until January 2016. Upon taking the court again, she stated she would decide in February 2016 if she would participate in what would be her fifth Olympic games or retire from the sport. Her retirement was announced one month later.|$|E

500|$|The Allman Brothers Band {{formed in}} March 1969, and began writing music and touring together. By that August, {{the group had}} {{recorded}} their self-titled debut album, which was released that November on Capricorn Records, a division of Atlantic Records. The record received a poor commercial response, selling less than 35,000 copies upon initial release. Executives suggested to the band's manager and Capricorn president, Phil Walden, that he relocate the band to New York or Los Angeles to increase their exposure. [...] "They wanted us to act [...] "like a rock band" [...] and we just told them to [...] "fuck themselves," [...] remembered Trucks.

500|$|The {{effect of}} {{drainage}} {{on the light}} peaty soils was that further shrinkage occurred, and land levels continued to <b>fall.</b> <b>By</b> <b>the</b> late 1920s, gravity discharge alone {{could no longer be}} relied upon to provide an adequate level of flood protection, and a change to pumped drainage began. A new sluice and pumping station were constructed at St Germans, which was completed in 1934. The sluice was built in the centre of the old syphon sluice channel, with a pumping station on either side of it. Three pump sets were installed, with space for a fourth. Each consisted of a [...] Crossley diesel engine coupled to an [...] Gwynnes pump, which could pump 840 tons per minute (1,234 megalitres per day [...] ). Once completed, the syphon sluice was demolished, while Hawkshaw's replacement sluice and its channel were abandoned. The new works were paid for by a grant, given on condition that three quarters of the workforce were from the local area. The capacity of the station was increased in 1951, when a [...] Crossley diesel engine was fitted into the spare bay, and again in 1969–70, when the two pumps {{on the north side of}} the sluice were rebuilt, and the engines replaced by [...] electric motors.|$|E

The band rented a $165-a-month farmhouse on a lake outside of Macon, the busy comings and goings at which reminded them of New York City's Idlewild Airport. Idlewild South was the home of rehearsals and parties, and was [...] "where the brotherhood came to pass," [...] according to roadie Kim Payne; [...] "There was a pact made out there around a campfire—all for one and one for all ... Everybody believed [...] 100 percent." [...] Much of the material presented on the band's second album, Idlewild South, originated at the cabin. Oakley's wife rented a large Victorian home on 2321 Vineville Avenue in Macon and the band moved into what they dubbed [...] "the Big House" [...] in March 1970.|$|E
