This paper used a 3 phase auxiliary winding and balanced capacitance compensation to ifluence the <b>effective</b> <b>reactance</b> ratio of a synchronous reluctance machine with simple salient rotor structure, such that its power factor and torque/ampere performance is improved. A mathematical model and dq equivalent circuit suitable for dynamic and steady state analysis was developed and used to study the synchronous operation of this machine.

40|$|Abstract: Synchronous {{reluctance}} {{machine with}} simple salient rotor {{is known to}} have poor power factor because of its poor reactance ratio. This study presents the use of an auxiliary winding attached to a balanced capacitor to improve the <b>effective</b> <b>reactance</b> ratio as well as the performance characteristics of synchronous reluctance machine. A unique feature of this configuration is that although the machine runs at synchronous speed, the <b>effective</b> <b>reactance</b> ratio of the machine can be improved by appropriate sizing of the capacitor attached to the auxiliary winding, with the constraint of the ampere turn rating of the auxiliary winding. The operational characteristics of a simple salient rotor synchronous reluctance machine equipped with this configuration were investigated and shown to have a desirable performance. How the <b>effective</b> <b>reactance</b> ratio, power factor and airgap flux distribution depend on the size of capacitor attached to the auxiliary winding is determined using a simplified mathematical model of the system. Analytical results and experimental measurements are in good agreement, and demonstrate the effectiveness and benefits of the configuratio...|$|E

40|$|Due to {{a variety}} of effects, such as lightning, severe storms and {{equipment}} failures, the configuration of an electric power system is not constant. Thus, important parameters, such as <b>effective</b> <b>reactances</b> of transmission lines, in an electric power system always contain some uncertainties. The aim {{of this paper is to}} discuss transient stability enhancement and voltage regulation of power systems using feedback linearization techniques and an adaptive control approach. A nonlinear controller design approach is employed to design an adaptive nonlinear control law to prevent the loss of synchronism in a power system under a large sudden fault. An adaptive nonlinear controller is proposed and the stability results for the overall system are established. Simulation results show that transient stability enhancement and voltage regulation of a power system under a large sudden fault can be achieved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|This project {{presents}} the variable <b>effective</b> fundamental equivalent <b>reactance</b> capability of TCSC for enhancing the transient stability of power systems. For obtaining the varying <b>effective</b> fundamental equivalent <b>reactance,</b> two different controllers namely a speed deviation based Self-tuning Fuzzy PID Controller and a nonlinear controller are used. To validate {{the performance of}} the control schemes, the simulation studies are carried out on a single machine infinite bus system using MATLAB/ SIMULINK software package. The results of computer simulation indicate that Self-tuning Fuzzy PID controlled TCSC can not only improve the static stability of system, but also effectively damp power oscillation and enhance the transient stability of system when the power system suffers small disturbance and short circuit. In addition, it also illuminates that Self-tuning Fuzzy PID Controlled TCSC is more effective than nonlinear control, traditional PID control and fixed series compensation. </p...|$|R
50|$|A {{quartz crystal}} {{provides}} both series and parallel resonance. The series resonance {{is a few}} kilohertz lower than the parallel one. Crystals below 30 MHz are generally operated between series and parallel resonance, {{which means that the}} crystal appears as an inductive reactance in operation, this inductance forming a parallel resonant circuit with externally connected parallel capacitance. Any small additional capacitance in parallel with the crystal pulls the frequency lower. Moreover, the <b>effective</b> inductive <b>reactance</b> of the crystal can be reduced by adding a capacitor in series with the crystal. This latter technique can provide a useful method of trimming the oscillatory frequency within a narrow range; in this case inserting a capacitor in series with the crystal raises the frequency of oscillation. For a crystal to operate at its specified frequency, the electronic circuit has to be exactly that specified by the crystal manufacturer. Note that these points imply a subtlety concerning crystal oscillators in this frequency range: the crystal does not usually oscillate at precisely either of its resonant frequencies.|$|R

It is shown that if capacitor (whose reactance is twice that of the inductive reactance of the rotor) is injected into the rotor circuit such that the <b>effective</b> <b>reactance</b> of the rotor is capacitive, there will be reversal of power flow. The slip of the machine will be positive, yet it will be operating as a generator...|$|E

A radiator of length l in an infinite ferrite medium is electrically μl meters long if μ=ϵ (relative permeability and permittivity). For very small ferrite spheres, the {{radiation resistance}} {{is determined by the}} relative permittivity, the <b>effective</b> <b>reactance</b> length by both the permittivity and the permeability.

40|$|Power {{transfer}} {{capability of}} long transmission lines {{is limited by}} stability considerations. Reducing the <b>effective</b> <b>reactance</b> of lines by series compensation is a direct approach to increase transmission capability; often, {{it is the most}} economical solution. The Static Synchronous Series Compensator (SSSC) is a series connected FACTS controller, which is capable of providing reactive power compensation to a power system. The reactive power flow/transmission line side voltage is controlled by adjusting the phase angle of the series injected voltage. In this paper, an improved fuzzy logic-based controller for SSSC is developed for the stability of the power system. These models are first validated by means of MATLAB simulations on a test system...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- {{the current}} major {{restructuring}} of the electricity market and the advances of new technology add new complexities in the power system applications software, particularly optimization. Minimization {{of the impact of}} a transaction on unrelated third party facilities or maximization of the power transfer between utilities needs now to be formulated as new constraints or objective functions. The dispatch and control of generating units, the taps of regulating transformers, mechanically switched capacitors and reactors have been the primary means available for controlling power flows over the years. However, certain applications require frequent operations that result in a rapid wearing out of the switching equipment. The inadequate line flow control may result in overloaded parts of the networks, while other parts are loaded far below their power carrying capacity. Therefore, the demands for flexibility in power flow control are growing continuously. The FACTS relying on thyristors have high speed switching capability that allows for rapid readjustment of line power flows in response to various contingencies. Installation of FACTS devices on key locations in a meshed network changes the <b>effective</b> <b>reactance</b> of the parallel paths and consequently the way that power divides among them. This paper proposes study of various FACTS DEVICES that can be installed. FACTS DEVICES model is incorporated into a Newton-Raphson algorithm to perform load flow analysis. Proposed algorithm is tested on IEEE 30 bus power system for optimal allocation of STATCOM and results are presented. KEYWORDS- Power Flow Studies, FACTS Devices, STATCOM...|$|E
40|$|Damping of {{electromechanical}} oscillations between interconnected synchronous generators {{is necessary}} for a secure system operation. While local oscillations involving one or more generators swinging against {{the rest of the}} system are mainly influenced by a restricted number of local system parameter- the behavior of low frequency inter-area oscillations is generally determined by global parameters of larger parts of the power system. Power System Stabilizers (PSSs) applied on selected generators can effectively damp local oscillation modes; their limited influence on inter-area modes, however, lead {{to the fact that they}} may not be considered as the only solution to damp interarea oscillations. Flexible AC Transmission Systems are being increasingly used to better utilize the capacity of existing transmission systems. Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS) is a technology based solution to help the utility industry deal with changes in the power delivery business. A major thrust of FACTS technology is the development of power electric based systems that provide dynamic control of the power transfer parameters transmission voltage, line impedance and phase angle [1]. The static var compensator (SVC), which is a shunt device, provides dynamically variable shunt impedance to regulate the series compensator (TCSC), which is a Series FACTS controller, is used to change the <b>effective</b> <b>reactance</b> of the line dynamically, thereby controlling the real power flow in the lines. The unified power flow controller (UPFC) is used to control the real and reactive powers simultaneously in a line by injecting a series voltage across the line. It also injects a shunt reactive current at one of the line-end buses to maintain the bus voltage at a specified value [2, 3]. FACTS devices are provided with supplementary controllers for damping out small signal oscillations [4 - 8], and the effectiveness of damping the oscillations depends on the location of FACTS controllers. Several methods [2 – 4] have been proposed for the placement of FACTS controllers. Previous studies [9 – 10] considered only static criterion like improving power transfer, available transfer capability (ATC), loss minimizations and did not consider any dynamic criteria for the placement of the FACTS controllers. A sensitivity based approach has been developed in some researches for determining the optimal placement of FACTS devices in electricity market having pool and contractual dispatches [11 - 13]. [11] Shows that few locations of FACTS devices can be decided based on sensitivity factors and then optimal dispatch problem must solved for finding suitable placement of UPFC in a congested system. [15] Implements Genetic Algorithm to finding the best location for TCSC to maximizing total transfer capacity. Tuning of FACTS parameters has been proposed for improving damping of weakly damped inter-area modes. [16 - 17] proposed a method for selecting suitable feedback signal to FACTS controllers for improving the damping. Sadikovic and Korba [18] used residue, called location index for effective damping, to find suitable location for damping inter-area mode of oscillations, also in the work of [14] and [19], the method used only UPFC placement based on only single operating condition. No consideration of other FACTS devices. ...|$|E
