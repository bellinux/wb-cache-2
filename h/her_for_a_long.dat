5|$|In 1972, Applewhite met Bonnie Nettles, a nurse with an {{interest}} in theosophy and Biblical prophecy. The two quickly became close friends; he later recalled that he felt like he had known <b>her</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time and concluded that they had met in a past life. She told him their meeting had been foretold to her by extraterrestrials, persuading him that he had a divine assignment. By that time, he had begun to investigate alternatives to traditional Christian doctrine, including astrology. He also had had several visions, including one in which he was told that he was chosen for a role like that of Jesus. In her 2005 profile of Applewhite, Susan Raine speculates that he had a schizophrenic episode around this time.|$|E
5|$|Arha's {{childhood}} and youth are lonely; her only friends are Manan and Penthe, a priestess her own age. She {{is trained in}} her duties by Thar and Kossil, the priestesses of the two other major deities. Thar tells her of the undertomb and the labyrinth beneath the Tombs, teaching her the instructions to find her way around them. She tells of the treasure hidden within the labyrinth, which wizards from the archipelago have tried to steal in past years. When Arha asks about the wizards, Thar tells her that they are unbelievers who can work magic. When she turns fourteen, Arha assumes all the responsibilities of her position, becoming the highest ranked priestess in the Tombs. She is required to order the death of prisoners sent to the Tombs by the God-King of the Kargad lands; she has them killed by starvation, an act which haunts <b>her</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time. After Thar dies of old age, Arha becomes increasingly isolated: although stern, Thar had been fair to her. Kossil despises Arha and sees the Nameless Ones {{as a threat to}} her power.|$|E

25|$|Of the {{existing}} accounts of her abduction, {{that of the}} Annals of Tigernach is probably the only one which is contemporaneous to the event:A hosting by Toirdhealbhach Ó Conchobhair and Diarmaid Mac Murchadha against Tighearnán Ó Ruairc, and they burned Bun Cuilinn and inflicted a defeat on Tighearnán, and made the son of Giolla Bruide Ó Ruairc king of Conmaicne, and he got the lordship of them all. And Diarmaid mac Murchadh, king of Leinster, forcibly carried off out of Meath the wife of Ó Ruairc, that is, Derbhfhorgaill, daughter of Murchadh, with her wealth.The same source claims that she fled Mac Murchada within a year. The next most reliable account is that found within the seventeenth-century Annals of the Four Masters, who report that:An army was led by Mac Lochlainn into Meath, as far as Rath-Ceannaigh, to meet the men of Ireland; and Toirdhealbhach proceeded into Meath, to meet Ua Lochlainn and Diarmaid Mac Murchadha, King of Leinster. They divided Meath into two parts on this occasion; they gave from Cluain-Iraird westwards to Murchadh Ua Maeleachlainn, and East Meath to his son, Maeleachlainn. They took Conmhaicne from Tighearnan Ua Ruairc, after having defeated him; and they burned the town named Bun-cuilinn, and gave the chieftainship to the son of Gillabraide Ua Ruairc, and their hostages were given up to Toirdhealbhach Ua Conchobhair. On this occasion Dearbhforgaill, daughter of Murchadh Ua Maeleachlainn, and wife of Tighearnan Ua Ruairc, was brought away by the King of Leinster, i.e. Diarmaid, with her cattle and furniture; and he took with her according to the advice of her brother, Maeleachlainn. There arose then a war between the Ui-Briuin and the men of Meath.The Annals of the Four Masters are clearly relying on multiple sources at this point, as the return of Derbforgaill from Laigin in 1153 is recorded twice. Firstly {{as a result of}} being carried away by force by Tairdelbach Ua Conchobair and returned to her male kinsmen (and not her husband), and noted a second time {{in a manner similar to}} that of the Annals of Tigernach (in which she returned to Ua Ruairc of her own accord). The description in the seventeenth-century Annals of Clonmacnoise is quite close to that of the Annals of the Four Masters, although more lurid and it is the only Irish annalistic source to offer a moral judgement on Mac Murchada, while simultaneously apportioning blame on Ua Ruairc:Dermott mcMurrogh king of Leinster tooke the lady Dervorgill, daughter of the said Morrogh o’Melaghlin, and wife of Tyernan o’Royrck, with her cattle with him, and kept <b>her</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> space to satisfie his insatiable, carnall and adulterous lust, shee was procured and enduced thereunto by her unadvised brother Melaghlin for some abuses of her husband Tyernan don before.Of the remaining accounts in the Irish annals, Mac Carthaigh’s Book appears to have been written after the invasion and appears to follow English accounts, while the Annals of Boyle’s curt entry adds no extra detail.|$|E

McDuffie, a native of Kannapolis, North Carolina, who had lied about his age so he could enlist at the age of 15, went on after the war to play semi-pro baseball and work for the United States Postal Service. He says that on that day he was on the subway to Brooklyn to visit his girlfriend, Ardith Bloomfield. He came out of the subway at Times Square, where people were celebrating in the streets. Excited that his brother, who was being held by the Japanese as a prisoner of war, would be released, McDuffie began hollering and jumping up and down. A nurse saw him, and opened her arms to him.
