5|$|Studies {{conducted}} off the Florida {{coast and}} the Bahamas {{have shown that}} silky sharks are highly sensitive to sound, in particular low-frequency (10–20Hz), irregular pulses. Experiments in which these sounds were played underwater attracted sharks from hundreds of meters away. Silky sharks likely orient to these sounds because they {{are similar to the}} noise generated by feeding animals such as birds or dolphins, thus indicating promising sources of food. These studies have also demonstrated that a silky shark attracted by one sound will quickly withdraw if that sound abruptly changes in amplitude or character; this change need not be a sound produced by a predator to evoke the reaction. Over repeated exposures, silky sharks habituate to the sound change and stop withdrawing, though <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>them</b> much longer to do so compared to the bolder oceanic whitetip shark.|$|E

25|$|The colony {{is founded}} by a single overwintered, inseminated queen. She rears the first {{generation}} of workers on her own until they are functional. Colonies pass through the foundation over an average period of 23–24 days. After the queen lays her eggs, it takes 6 days for them to hatch. They grow as larva for eight days. <b>It</b> <b>takes</b> <b>them</b> an additional 9–10 days to mature into adult workers.|$|E

25|$|Ms Frizzle's {{class is}} going {{with her on}} the most boring field trip, to the waterworks. At least that is what they think until they {{discover}} how interesting things always happen on Ms Frizzle's trips. After going through a tunnel, all the children find themselves in scuba diving outfits. On the top of a bridge the bus rises {{up in the air and}} into a cloud. Once in the cloud, the class finds that water droplets are growing, and they are shrinking. The class rains and lands in the water purification system. Eventually <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>them</b> back to Walkerville Elementary, where they come out of the faucet in the girls' bathroom. Later, they see the bus outside and wonder how it returned from the cloud.|$|E
500|$|Carp {{evaluated}} the script as [...] "impeccably written", adding that [...] "The Man from Jupiter" [...] was a hilarious episode. Cites of adulation {{stemmed from the}} animation, which Carp described it as [...] "likely the best you'll see anywhere on television." [...] He wrote, [...] "It's just so unique the way they use {{state of the art}} 3D computer animation to create a retrofitted look. <b>It</b> <b>takes</b> <b>them</b> months to animate each episode and the hard work really pays off in the unique visuals of the show." [...] Writing for TV Fanatic, Eric Hochberger stated that [...] "if this week combined with the mini-series was any indication, we're in for a damn strong season of Archer." ...|$|E
500|$|Neutrophils are {{normally}} {{found in the}} bloodstream and are the most abundant type of phagocyte, constituting 50% to 60% of the total circulating white blood cells. One litre of human blood contains about five billion neutrophils, which are about 10 micrometers in diameter and live for only about five days. Once they have received the appropriate signals, <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>them</b> about thirty minutes to leave the blood and reach {{the site of an}} infection. [...] They are ferocious eaters and rapidly engulf invaders coated with antibodies and complement, and damaged cells or cellular debris. Neutrophils do not return to the blood; they turn into pus cells and die. Mature neutrophils are smaller than monocytes and have a segmented nucleus with several sections; each section is connected by chromatin filaments—neutrophils can have 2–5 segments. Neutrophils do not normally exit the bone marrow until maturity but during an infection neutrophil precursors called myelocytes and promyelocytes are released.|$|E

2500|$|In [...] "Dinner at Eight" [...] (1993), Martin takes Frasier and Niles to a themed steakhouse, where health-conscious, snobby Frasier and Niles {{criticize the}} food, the restaurant's customs, and the clientele. Martin becomes {{frustrated}} and angry before leaving, remarking upon departing that their mother, Hester, would be disappointed with their behavior. Frasier and Niles {{try to prove}} that they are not [...] "snobs" [...] by finishing their meal, although <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>them</b> until after closing time. Ironically, in the Cheers season seven episode, [...] "I Kid You Not" [...] (1988), Frasier invites Carla and her son Ludlow to the upper class, expensive restaurant, but Carla and Ludlow criticize and mock it, enraging Frasier.|$|E
2500|$|Millions of {{butterflies}} travel south into Mexico, from Texas and then follow the Sierra Madre Oriental {{mountains to the}} preserve. [...] The butterflies congregate, clustering onto pine and oyamel trees. To many, the trees appear orange and branches sag from the weight. Come Spring, these butterflies migrate across America, sometimes ending up in Eastern Canada. Over the time <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>them</b> to make this journey, four generations of monarch butterflies are born and die. The monarch butterflies migration patterns are altered by climate change. During migration, monarchs fly north once {{they are exposed to}} cooler temperatures. Dense congregations are thought to conserve heat. If warmed by the sun, the butterflies take flight. the beating of their wings has been compared to the sound of a light rain. The reserve is susceptible to lethal, freezing temperatures.|$|E
2500|$|Unferth {{is portrayed}} by John Malkovich. Malkovich became {{involved}} in the project because one of his friends, who had worked with Zemeckis, [...] "spoke very highly of him. I had always found him a very interesting and innovative filmmaker. I liked the script very much and I liked the group involved and the process interested me a great deal also." [...] He found the experience of working with motion capture to be similar to his experiences working in the theater. He also found the process intriguing: [...] "Say you do a normal day of filmmaking. Sometimes that’s 1/8 of a page, sometimes it’s 3/8th of a page, normally let’s say it’s 2½ pages, maybe 3. Now it’s probably a little more {{than it used to be}} but not always. So you may be acting for a total of 20 minutes a day. In this, you act the entire day all the time except for the tiny amount of time <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>them</b> to sort of coordinate the computer information, let’s say, and make sure that the computers are reading the data and that you’re transmitting the data. It interests me on that level because I’m a professional actor so I’d just as soon act as sit around." [...] Malkovich also recalled that he studied the original poem in high school, and that “I think we got smacked if we couldn’t recite a certain number of stanzas. It was in the Old English class and I think my rendition was exemplary." ...|$|E
