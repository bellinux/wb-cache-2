5|$|The pinna helps {{direct sound}} through {{the ear canal}} to the eardrum. The complex {{geometry}} of ridges on the inner surface of some mammalian ears helps to sharply focus sounds produced by prey, using echolocation signals. These ridges {{can be regarded as}} the acoustic equivalent of a fresnel lens, and may be seen {{in a wide range of}} animals, including the bat, aye-aye, lesser <b>galago,</b> bat-eared fox, mouse lemur and others.|$|E
5|$|Mouse lemurs (Microcebus), sifakas (Propithecus), and the indri (Indri) {{use their}} toothcombs {{to scoop up}} fruit pulp. Other small lemuriforms, such as fork-marked lemurs (Phaner), the hairy-eared dwarf lemur (Allocebus), and galagos (particularly the genera <b>Galago</b> and Euoticus) use their toothcombs to tooth-scrape plant exudates, such as gum and sap. In fork-marked lemurs, the toothcomb is {{specially}} adapted to minimize food trapment since the interdental spaces are greatly reduced. The herbivorous colugos in the genus Cynocephalus may also use their toothcomb for food procurement.|$|E

25|$|The complex {{geometry}} of ridges {{on the inner}} surface of aye-aye ears helps to sharply focus not only echolocation signals from the tapping of its finger, but also to passively listen for any other sound produced by the prey.

25|$|Three hundred {{species of}} mammals have been {{reported}} in Tanzania. Some of the species reported are: African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana), Burchell's zebra (Equus burchellii), Thomson's gazelle (Eudorcas thomsonii), hartebeest (Alcelaphus buselaphus), woodland dormouse (Graphiurus murinus), kipunji (Rungwecebus kipunji), Thomas's bushbaby (<b>Galago</b> thomasi), Prince Demidoff's bushbaby (Galagoides demidovii), puku (Kobus vardonii), gerenuk (Litocranius walleri), common warthog (Phacochoerus africanus), pygmy scaly-tailed flying squirrel (Idiurus zenkeri), suni (Neotragus moschatus), mbarapi (Hippotragus niger) and North African crested porcupine (Hystrix cristata).|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to echolocating prey, bat ears {{are sensitive to}} the fluttering of moth wings, the sounds produced by tymbalate insects, and the movement of ground-dwelling prey, such as centipedes and earwigs. The complex geometry of ridges on the inner surface of bat ears helps to sharply focus not only echolocation signals, but also to passively listen for any other sound produced by the prey. These ridges can be regarded as the acoustic equivalent of a Fresnel lens, and may be seen in a large variety of unrelated animals, such as the aye-aye, lesser <b>galago,</b> bat-eared fox, mouse lemur, and others. [...] Bats can estimate the elevation of their target using the interference patterns from the echoes reflecting from the tragus, a flap of skin in the external ear.|$|E
500|$|Slow lorises are a {{group of}} several species of nocturnal strepsirrhine {{primates}} {{that make up the}} genus Nycticebus. Found in Southeast Asia and bordering areas, they range from Bangladesh and Northeast India in the west to the Sulu Archipelago in the Philippines in the east, and from Yunnan province in China in the north to the island of Java in the south. [...] Although many previous classifications recognized as few as a single all-inclusive species, there are now at least [...] eight that are considered valid: the Sunda slow loris (N.coucang), Bengal slow loris (N.bengalensis), pygmy slow loris (N.pygmaeus), Javan slow loris (N.javanicus), Philippine slow loris (N.menagensis), Bangka slow loris (N.bancanus), Bornean slow loris (N.borneanus), and Kayan River slow loris (N.kayan). The group's closest relatives are the slender lorises of southern India and Sri Lanka. Their next closest relatives are the African lorisids, the pottos, false pottos, and angwantibos. They are less closely related to the remaining lorisoids (the various types of <b>galago),</b> and more distantly to the lemurs of Madagascar. Their evolutionary history is uncertain since their fossil record is patchy and molecular clock studies have given inconsistent results.|$|E
2500|$|Research in 2007 {{showed that}} common {{chimpanzees}} sharpen sticks {{to use as}} weapons when hunting mammals. This is considered the first evidence of systematic use of weapons in a species other than humans. Researchers documented 22 occasions when wild chimpanzees on a savanna in Senegal fashioned sticks into [...] "spears" [...] to hunt [...] lesser bushbabies (<b>Galago</b> senegalensis). In each case, a chimpanzee modified a branch by breaking off one or two ends and, frequently using its teeth, sharpened the stick. The tools, on average, were about 60cm (24in) long and 1.1cm (0.4in) in circumference. The chimpanzee then jabbed the spear into hollows in tree trunks where bushbabies sleep. There was a single {{case in which a}} chimpanzee successfully extracted a bushbaby with the tool. It has been suggested that the word [...] "spear" [...] is an overstatement that makes the chimpanzees seem too much like early humans, and that the term [...] "bludgeon" [...] is more accurate, since the point of the tool may not be particularly sharp. This behaviour was seen more frequently in females, particularly adolescent females, and young chimps in general, than in adult males.|$|E
50|$|A similar {{organization}} by typical movement repertoire {{has been}} reported in the posterior parietal cortex of monkeys and <b>galagos</b> and in the motor cortex of rats and mice.|$|R
50|$|Use of nests {{for leaving}} young {{is thought to}} have evolved from nocturnal {{primates}} with solitary habits which possibly led to the evolution of nesting and parking behaviour in strepsirrhines such as <b>galagoes.</b> <b>Galagoes</b> give birth to single young which is left in a nest as an infant and carried to a parking place in the vegetation orally by the mothers. In addition, the use of nests or tree holes as shelters for young infants differs functionally from the use of resting places by adult animals (which may be accompanied by infants).|$|R
50|$|<b>Galagos</b> are brown grey {{to light}} grey in color. With many showing a {{yellowish}} tint {{to the sides}} and limbs. They also have a distinct dark marking around the eye.|$|R
60|$|Mr. MacLennan gave me sundry beetles, but {{insisted on}} {{retaining}} {{one which is}} the largest I ever saw. The hunting-dog must scour the bush in packs, for the voice is exactly that of hounds. The laugh of the hyæna and the scream of the buzzard are commonly heard. The track of a 'bush-cow' once crossed my path: the halves of the spoor were some five inches long by three wide, and the hoofs knuckled backwards so as to show false hoofs of almost equal size. I was unable to procure for Dr. Günther a specimen of the 'bush-dog,' as the Kruboys call it: last year I was bringing home a live one in the s.s. Nubia; but one day the fellow in charge reported that it was dead and had been thrown overboard. I hold it to be a tailless lemur, the <b>galago</b> of the East Coast. The French name is orson, the popular idea being that it is an ursine. The Fanti peoples, whose 'folk-lore' is extensive, and who have some tale about every bird, beast, and fish, thus account for the loud cries which we heard at night in every 'bush.' King Leo, having lost his mother, commanded by proclamation all his subjects to attend her funeral, and none failed save Orson. One evening his Feline Majesty, when going his rounds, found the delinquent upon the ground, and roughly demanded the reason why. Orson, shuffling towards the nearest tree, pleaded in all humility, 'O King, is thy beloved parent really deceased? I never heard of it. I am so sorry; I would never have failed to show the respect due to the royal house.' When he had climbed the foot of the tree his tone began to alter. 'But, Sire, if thy Majesty hath lost a mother, I see no cause compelling me to attend her funeral.' And when quite safe the change was notable. 'Bother the old woman! very glad she is dead, and may her grave be defiled!' These people know the stuff of which courtiers are made.|$|E
