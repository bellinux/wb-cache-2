5|$|At {{this point}} Díaz {{tried to come}} to terms with Madero, {{particularly}} after the capture of Cuautla by the Zapatistas in south-central Mexico. Together with his finance minister and main advisor, José Yves Limantour, Díaz planned to make concessions to the fairly moderate Madero and, once Madero was pacified, crack down <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> the more radical elements among the rebels. A truce was agreed to on April 23.|$|E
5|$|After {{ten weeks}} being {{constantly}} watched to prevent suicide attempts in police custody, he {{was transferred to}} Akershus Fortress and awaited trial {{as part of the}} legal purge. Despite initially losing weight and suffering from polyneuritis, his strong constitution meant that he soon started working <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> his case with Henrik Bergh, a lawyer with a good track record but largely unsympathetic, at least initially, to Quisling's plight. Bergh did, however, believe Quisling's testimony that he tried to act {{in the best interests of}} Norway and decided to use this as a starting point for the defence.|$|E
5|$|At {{the final}} whistle, Van Nistelrooy was {{immediately}} confronted by Arsenal players Martin Keown, Lauren, Ray Parlour, Ashley Cole and Kolo Touré. Keown jumped {{up next to}} Van Nistelrooy and brought his arms down <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> the Dutchman's back, while Lauren pushed Van Nistelrooy {{in the back and}} Parlour and Cole offered verbal abuse. Van Nistelrooy did not react and was escorted away by Manchester United captain Roy Keane, but the incident escalated away from the two of them. In defence of their teammate, Manchester United players Ryan Giggs, Cristiano Ronaldo, Gary Neville, Mikaël Silvestre, Quinton Fortune and Rio Ferdinand also became involved in the situation.|$|E

5|$|Eventually {{the order}} to {{withdraw}} was given from 11th Brigade headquarters. During the subsequent evacuation, two more landing craft ran aground and although one managed to float free, the other remained stuck <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> a reef. Over {{the course of the}} next couple of days, the men in the landing craft were subjected to heavy Japanese attack and it was not until 11 June that rescue efforts were completed. The battalion lost 23 men killed or missing, presumed dead, while a further 106 were wounded in the operation.|$|E
5|$|Greeley, in his paper, {{initially}} {{supported the}} Whig program. As divisions between Clay and President Tyler became apparent, {{he supported the}} Kentucky senator and looked to a Clay nomination for president in 1844. However, when Clay was nominated by the Whigs, he was defeated by the Democrat, former Tennessee governor James K. Polk, though Greeley worked <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> Clay's behalf. Greeley had taken positions in opposition to slavery as editor of The New-Yorker in the late 1830s, opposing the annexation of the slaveholding Republic of Texas to the United States. In the 1840s, Greeley became an increasingly vocal opponent of the expansion of slavery.|$|E

Bart is unable to play the position well and causes the team's first loss. While training at night Bart meets Joe Namath, who promises to help him, but soon after Joe's wife fixes the car, which had broken down due to vapor lock, Joe leaves without helping Bart.|$|E

I remember seeing videos from New Edition, The Jackson 5 and the Temptations, bands I love for their beautiful harmonies, and precise choreography and I always wanted to make a video and be part of a boy group myself. It was so much fun. I put my heart and soul into 'Love On Top' and I hope you love it.|$|E
5|$|In Bakuriani, {{the street}} where Kumaritashvili's {{childhood}} home is located was renamed in his honour. Felix Loch of Germany, who {{won the gold medal}} in luge at the Vancouver Olympics, had his medal melted down and refashioned into two disks, etched with an image of Kumaritashvili and the years of his birth and death, one of which he gave to Kumaritashvili's parents. In spite of several donations of money to the Kumaritashvili family, the tragedy was <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> them; twice in the years afterwards Dodo, who continued to fix a meal for Kumaritashvili every day, tried to kill herself, while David dealt with severe health problems resulting in multiple stays in hospital.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the success of the tour, the band was not without at least one serious altercation which has since been widely publicized. After playing a {{sell-out}} show in Glasgow, Scotland, members of the band and crew were involved in heavy drinking. After a brief amount of time, vocalist Randy Blythe, whilst wearing a quilt and attempting to speak with a Scottish accent, became verbally violent towards both drummer Chris Adler and guitarist Mark Morton, the later of whom then struck Blythe from behind on the bus in response. The incident developed into grabbing, pushing and separating until Blythe and Morton then encountered each other outside on the footpath. The fight between the two was especially lackluster due to intoxication, however it resulted in Morton bringing Blythe down <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> the pavement beneath him briefly incapacitating Blythe. Two days and at least one show later, the duo reconciled over drinks.|$|E

5|$|Khalid bin Ali, the Al Khawalid ancestor, was the {{governor}} of Riffa and ruled over Sitra and Nabih Saleh islands, and his elder son Ibrahim controlled Jabalah Habashi. The Khalids were known for being <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> the Shia. In 1923, the events took a new turn. Wanting to end the calls for reform, the Khalids and Al Dawasir tribe used armed tactics to intimidate reform supporters. The former's paramilitary forces numbered 100, about 20 {{percent of the total}} Al Khalifa manpower, while the latter had about 400 men.|$|E
5|$|One of the Smith government's first actions was {{to crack}} down <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> the black {{nationalist}} political violence that had erupted following {{the establishment of a}} second black nationalist organisation, the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), by disgruntled ZAPU members in Tanzania in August 1963. The rival movements were split tribally, ZAPU being mostly Ndebele and ZANU predominantly Shona, and politically—ZAPU, which had relabelled itself the People's Caretaker Council (PCC) within Southern Rhodesia to circumvent its ban, was Marxist–Leninist and backed by the Warsaw Pact and its allies, while ZANU had aligned itself with Maoism and the bloc headed by communist China. Their respective supporters in the black townships clashed constantly, also targeting non-aligned blacks whom they hoped to recruit, and sporadically attacked whites, businesses and police stations.|$|E
5|$|Portland had {{strongly}} desired Washington, {{and their}} general manager Stu Inman, {{was a close}} friend of Pete Newell's. Inman had worked hard through Newell to let Washington know that they intended this to be the last time he was traded. This was important as the media coverage and re-locations had been <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> Pat and the children. To his great relief, the city of Portland welcomed Washington with open arms. Portland had one of the more rabid fan bases in the league, and everywhere Washington went he was treated like a beloved celebrity.|$|E

5|$|Stage 14 was the {{individual}} time trial, which was won by Vasil Kiryienka (Sky). Contador finished {{third on the}} stage, nearly three minutes ahead of Aru. Contador therefore moved back into the race lead. Contador passed Landa on the road, despite starting three minutes after him; Landa lost over four minutes and fell to seventh place overall. Movistar's Andrey Amador moved up into third. Stage 15 was {{the final stage of}} the second week and was the climb to Madonna di Campiglio. Landa won the stage after Astana rode <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> the final climb; he finished five seconds ahead of Contador and moved back up to fourth place. Contador finished a second ahead of Aru and extended his lead further due to bonus seconds for his third-place finish. Porte, who had lost over 30 minutes during the weekend following the crash in stage 13, withdrew from the race after the stage.|$|E
5|$|Strong, royalty-based {{nation states}} rose {{throughout}} Europe in the Late Middle Ages, particularly in England, France, and the Christian kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula: Aragon, Castile, and Portugal. The long conflicts {{of the period}} strengthened royal control over their kingdoms and were extremely <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> the peasantry. Kings profited from warfare that extended royal legislation and increased the lands they directly controlled. Paying for the wars required that methods of taxation become more effective and efficient, {{and the rate of}} taxation often increased. The requirement to obtain the consent of taxpayers allowed representative bodies such as the English Parliament and the French Estates General to gain power and authority.|$|E
