50|$|The {{species is}} {{commonly}} referred to as the <b>giant</b> freshwater <b>pufferfish</b> due to its massive size, growing to a length of 67 cm (26 inches). As such, these fish are difficult to adequately house in home aquaria since they require a very large tank and appropriately scaled water filtration.|$|R
5000|$|The flora {{includes}} Albizzia gummifera, Bridelia micrantha, Cyperus papyrus, Diospyros mespiliformis, Ficus sycomorus, Ficus verruculosa, Isoberlinia spp., Khaya senegalensis, Parkia filicoidea, Phoenix reclinata, Syzgium cordatum, and Syzgium owariense. Mesobola spinifer, {{also known}} as [...] "Malagarasi Sardine", is endemic to the river. In the valley grasslands there are prominent species such as Hyparrhenia, Themeda, Echinochloa. The Malagarasi contains several fish species which occur in the Congo River Basin but not in Lake Tanganyika. <b>Giant</b> freshwater Mbu <b>pufferfish,</b> however, occur in both the Central and Upper Zaire Basin and the Malagarasi River. Waterbuck and hippopotamus are common in the swamps. Concerns have been raised over hippo poaching in the river basin by the Wanyahosa people, who prefer the meat over fish.|$|R
