Needing a witness for the coroner's inquest, he next questions an apprehensive Porgy. Once Porgy admits to knowing Crown, he is ordered to come and identify Crown's body. Sportin' Life tells Porgy that corpses bleed {{in the presence of}} their murderers, and the detective will use this to hang Porgy. Porgy refuses to identify the body, but is dragged off anyway. Bess is distraught, and Sportin' Life puts his plan into action. He tells her that Porgy will be locked up for a long time, and points out that he is the only one still here.

25|$|Modern-day {{authorities}} disagree as to {{how much}} of Gerard's Herball was original. Garret made a chance visit to the Norton publishing shop, where he discovered the proofs of the Herball, and alerted the Nortons as both to errors he discovered in the proofs and to the incorporation of some of L'Obel's material in Gerard's new book. This story is recounted by L'Obel in his Stirpium illustrationes (1655) in which he accuses Gerard of plagiarism. Although they were not concerned about plagiarism, the Nortons, fearing errors in a book {{that was supposed to be}} an expert reference guide, hired L'Obel, as an internationally recognized expert on plants (who had as Gerard’s friend, unwittingly contributed to his book) to proof the translations, fix the mismatched illustrations, and right its textual wrongs. When Gerard discovered L'Obel's thankless efforts, he had him dismissed. Although Gerard was an experienced collector and plantsman, unlike L'Obel he lacked scholarship, as is evident in his dedication to Burghley, where <b>he</b> <b>paints</b> a picture of himself as a gardener. Gerard dismissed L'Obel's criticisms as being due to his unfamiliarity with English idioms. Norton decided to proceed with publication despite these difficulties. He decided against using Dodoens' original illustrations since this would have revealed the actual source of the material, but instead rented woodblocks from Nicolaus Bassaeus in Frankfurt, about 1,800 in all, only 16 being original. However, Gerard was then faced with the difficulty of matching them to the text and frequently mislabelled them.|$|E
25|$|In 1927, a Canadian {{teacher and}} writer Florence Deeks unsuccessfully sued Wells for {{infringement}} of copyright and breach of trust, claiming {{that much of}} The Outline of History had been plagiarised from her unpublished manuscript, The Web of the World's Romance, which had spent nearly nine months {{in the hands of}} Wells's Canadian publisher, Macmillan Canada. However, it was sworn on oath at the trial that the manuscript remained in Toronto in the safekeeping of Macmillan, and that Wells did not even know it existed, let alone having seen it. The court found no proof of copying, and decided the similarities were {{due to the fact that}} the books had similar nature and both writers had access to the same sources. In 2000, A. B. McKillop, a professor of history at Carleton University, produced a book on the case, The Spinster & The Prophet: Florence Deeks, H. G. Wells, and the Mystery of the Purloined Past. According to McKillop, the lawsuit was unsuccessful due to the prejudice against a woman suing a well-known and famous male author, and <b>he</b> <b>paints</b> a detailed story based on the circumstantial evidence of the case. In 2004, Denis N. Magnusson, Professor Emeritus of the Faculty of Law, Queen's University, Ontario, published an article on Deeks v. Wells. This re-examines the case in relation to McKillop's book. While having some sympathy for Deeks, he argues that she had a weak case that was not well presented, and though she may have met with sexism from her lawyers, she received a fair trial, adding that the law applied is essentially the same law that would be applied to a similar case today (i.e., 2004).|$|E
25|$|The first {{important}} {{painter of}} this time was the Amasis Painter (560–525 BC), named after the famous potter Amasis, with whom he primarily worked. Many researchers regard them as the same person. He began his painting career {{at about the same}} time as Lydos but was active over a period almost twice as long. Whereas Lydos showed more the abilities of a skilled craftsman, the Amasis Painter was an accomplished artist. His images are clever, charming and sophisticated and his personal artistic development comes close to a reflection of the overall evolution of black-figure Attic vase painting at that time. His early work shows his affinity to the painters of Siana cups. Advances can be most easily recognized in how he draws the folds of clothing. His early female figures wear clothes without folds. Later <b>he</b> <b>paints</b> flat, angular folds, and in the end he is able to convey the impression of supple, flowing garments. Drawings of garments were one of his chief characteristics; he liked to depicted pattered and fringed clothing. The groups of figures which the Amasis Painter shows were carefully drawn and symmetrically composed. Initially they were quite static, later figures convey an impression of motion. Although the Amasis Painter often depicted mythological events—he is known for his pig-faced satyrs, for example—he is better known for his scenes of daily life. He was the first painter to portray them to a significant extent. His work decisively influenced the work of red-figure painters later. He possibly anticipated some of their innovations or was influenced by them toward the end of his painting career: on many of his vases women are only shown in outline, without a black filling, and they are no longer identifiable as women by the application of opaque white as skin color.|$|E
50|$|<b>He</b> also <b>painted</b> frescoes of the Life and Miracles of San Francis of Paola for the cloister of Trinità dei Monti in the Pincio. <b>He</b> <b>painted</b> an oil altarpiece for {{the chapel}} of the Compagnia del Carmine {{in the church}} of San Martino ai Monti. <b>He</b> <b>painted</b> an altarpiece with St Sebastian with Saints for the church of San Luigi de' Francesi. <b>He</b> <b>painted</b> life of Galla for Santa Maria in Portico. <b>He</b> <b>painted</b> a Virgin with Child and Saints in oil for Sant'Andrea delle Fratte. <b>He</b> <b>painted</b> a Jesus before Caiphas for Santa Prassede. He {{returned}} to Lucca late in life, where he died.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>painted</b> an altarpiece {{depicting}} St Vincent Ferrer performing miracle for San Pietro in Monastero. <b>He</b> <b>painted</b> a Marriage of the Virgin and a Glory of St Joseph for the suppressed Oratory of Santa Caterina presso Ognissanti. <b>He</b> <b>painted</b> a St Augustine meditating on the Trinity for {{the church}} of Santa Eufemia.

500|$|As an {{introduction}} for [...] "Little Susie", Michael used his own variation of Pie Jesu from Maurice Duruflé's Requiem. The inspiration behind the song more likely {{came from an}} artist called Gottfried Helnwein. Michael admired the artist's work and he had purchased some of his paintings. One of them, [...] "Beautiful Victim", inspired the song. Helnwein is considered quite provocative as <b>he</b> <b>paints</b> about the human condition depicting wounded children, among others. Helnwein later painted a portrait of Michael. There {{appears to be a}} similarity between the [...] "Beautiful Victim" [...] painting and the artwork included for the song in HIStory.|$|E
500|$|Unlike the {{painters}} in the Low Countries, Lochner {{was not so}} concerned with delineating perspective; his pictures are often set in shallow space, while his backgrounds give little indication of distance and often dissolve into solid gold. Thus, and given his harmonious colour schemes, Lochner is usually described {{as one of the}} last exponents of the International Gothic. This is not to say his paintings lack contemporary northern sophistication; his arrangements are often innovative. The worlds <b>he</b> <b>paints</b> are hushed, according to Snyder, achieved with the symmetry of subdued use of colour and the often repeated stylistic element of circles. Angels form circles around the heavenly figures; the heavenly figures' heads are highly circular and they wear round haloes. According to Snyder, the viewer is slowly [...] "drawn into empathy with the revolving forms".|$|E
500|$|Auric Goldfinger was {{described}} by Raymond Benson as [...] "Fleming's most successful villain to date" [...] and Fleming gives him a number of character flaws that are brought out across the novel. Psychologically Goldfinger is warped, possibly because of an inferiority complex brought on by his shortness, {{in contrast to a}} number of Fleming's other oversized villains and physically he is odd, with a lack of proportion to his body. As with a number of other villains in the Bond novels, there is an echo of World War II, with Goldfinger employing members of the German Luftwaffe, some Japanese and Koreans. For Operation Grand Slam, Goldfinger used the poison GB, now known as Sarin, which had been discovered by the Nazis. Goldfinger has an obsession with gold to the extent that academic Elizabeth Ladenson says that he is [...] "a walking tautology". Ladenson lists both his family name and his first name as being related to gold ("Auric" [...] is an adjective pertaining to gold); his clothes, hair, car and cat are all gold coloured, or a variant thereof; his Korean servants are referred to by Bond as being [...] "yellow", or yellow-faced"; and <b>he</b> <b>paints</b> his women (normally prostitutes) gold before sex.|$|E
