5|$|Ralston, who {{considered}} the Enterprise ugly {{and the model}} hard to shoot, delighted in destroying the ship. Several shots were combined together for the complete destruction sequence; while Ralston {{would have preferred to}} take a mallet to the original $150,000 model, a variety of cheaper models were used. The first part of the ship to be destroyed was the bridge, a separate miniature with stars added to the background. The shot switches to the Bird of Prey moving away as the top of the saucer burns, where explosions (filmed upside down to simulate the absence of gravity) were superimposed over a motion control pass of the ship. The camera cuts to a closeup of the ship's registration number being eaten away by inner explosions. George created a light Styrofoam model that was dissolved by acetone dripped on the saucer from above. By shooting at less than one <b>frame</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> and keeping light off the model, the drips were not visible in the print. Burning steel wool {{on the inside of the}} saucer created a glowing ember effect from the ship's inner decks being destroyed. The saucer explosion was simulated by blowing up a talcum powder-covered plaster dish. Two and fourounce bombs and gasoline were used as pyrotechnics in live action scenes of the bridge being destroyed. Stuntmen used spring-loaded platforms to launch themselves in the air.|$|E
25|$|A Steadicam rig was {{employed}} {{during the filming}} of Return of the Jedi, in conjunction with two gyroscopes for extra stabilization, to film the background plates for the speeder bike chase. Steadicam inventor Garrett Brown operated the shot, walking through a redwood forest, running the camera at one <b>frame</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b> When projected at 24 frames per second, it {{gave the impression of}} flying through the air at perilous speeds.|$|E
2500|$|In 1957, when Cooper was 30 and a Captain, he was {{assigned}} to Fighter Section of the Experimental Flight Test Engineering Division at Edwards AFB in California. He acted as a test pilot and project manager. On May 3 of that year, he had a crew setting up an Askania Cinetheodolite precision landing system on a dry lake bed. This cinetheodolite system would take pictures at one <b>frame</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> as an aircraft landed. The crew consisted of James Bittick and Jack Gettys who began work at the site just before 08:00, using both still and motion picture cameras. According to his accounts, later that morning they returned to report to Cooper that they saw a [...] "strange-looking, saucer-like" [...] aircraft that did not make a sound either on landing or take-off.|$|E

50|$|In 2016, Ang Lee {{released}} Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk. Unlike The Hobbit trilogy, {{which used}} 48 <b>frames</b> <b>per</b> <b>second,</b> the picture shot and projected selected scenes in 120 <b>frames</b> <b>per</b> <b>second,</b> which is five {{times faster than}} the 24 <b>frames</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> standard used in Hollywood.|$|R
50|$|In PAL, SECAM, {{and other}} 25 {{frames per second}} systems, the film {{projector}} speed is increased one <b>frame</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> to 25 frame/s. This gives a one-to-one film to video frame transfer ratio. Thus a standard two-bladed shutter can be used.|$|E
50|$|Phase Alternating Line (PAL) is a colour {{encoding}} {{system for}} analogue television used in broadcast television systems {{in most countries}} broadcasting at 625-line / 50 field (25 <b>frame)</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> (576i). Other common colour encoding systems are NTSC and SECAM.|$|E

50|$|The device {{would be}} the largest {{telescope}} ever built - {{twice the size of}} the ground-based twin 10 m Keck telescopes. It could see about 40 percent of the Earth's surface and could image a 10 x 10 km area at a 1 m resolution and generate videos at one <b>frame</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} also defines nominal bitrates of 3 Gbit/s, for 50/60 <b>frame</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> 1080P applications. This {{version of}} the interface is not used (and has not been commercially implemented); instead, either a dual-link extension of SMPTE 292M known as SMPTE 372 or a version running twice as fast known as SMPTE 424 is used for e.g. 1080p60 applications.|$|E
50|$|All formats {{designed}} for digital cinematography are progressive scan, and capture usually {{occurs at the}} same 24 <b>frame</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> rate established as the standard for 35mm film. Some films such as The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey have a High Frame Rate of 48 fps, although in some theatres it was also released in a 24 fps version which many fans of traditional film prefer.|$|E

5000|$|NTSC is {{the most}} {{challenging}} of the formats {{when it comes to}} standards conversion and, specifically, converting to film prints. NTSC runs at the approximate rate of 29.97 video [...] "frames" [...] (consisting of two interlaced screen-fulls of scan lines, called fields, per <b>frame)</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b> In this way, NTSC resolves actual live action movement at almost - but not quite - 60 alternating half-resolution images every second. Because of this 29.97 rate, no direct correlation to film frames at 24 frames per second can be achieved. NTSC is hardest to reconcile with film, thus motivates its own unique processes.|$|E
50|$|Garrett Brown (born April 6, 1942) is an American cinematographer, {{best known}} as the {{inventor}} of the Steadicam. Brown's invention allows camera operators to film while walking without the normal shaking and jostles of a handheld camera. The Steadicam was first used in the Hal Ashby film Bound for Glory (1976), receiving an Academy Award (Best Cinematography), and since used on such films as Rocky, filming Rocky's running and training sequences, and Return of the Jedi, where Brown walked through a Redwood forest with the Steadicam shooting film at 1 <b>frame</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> to achieve the illusion of high speed motion during the speeder-bike chase.|$|E
50|$|A Steadicam rig {{was also}} {{employed}} {{during the filming}} of Return of the Jedi (1983), in conjunction with two gyroscopes for extra stabilization, to film the background plates for the speeder bike chase. Brown, who personally operated the shot, walked through a redwood forest, with the camera running at a speed of less than one <b>frame</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b> The end result, when projected at 24 frames per second, {{gave the impression of}} flying through the air at perilous speeds. In the Michael Crichton film Runaway (1984), a Steadicam rig was used to simulate {{the point of view of}} a futuristic smart bullet in flight while targeting specific individuals by their heat signature.|$|E
50|$|Stereoscopic 3D {{support was}} {{demonstrated}} at the 2010 Consumer Electronics Show and released in June {{in the same}} year. Super Stardust HD is the first 3D game for the PS3 that runs at 720p resolution at 60 <b>frames</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> for each eye (120 <b>frames</b> <b>per</b> <b>second).</b> The original 2D version supports full 1080p resolution at 60 <b>frames</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Although many DVD video players support {{playback}} of VCDs, VCD {{video is}} only {{compatible with the}} DVD-Video standard if encoded at 29.97 <b>frames</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> or 25 <b>frames</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b>|$|R
50|$|In March 2011, {{director}} James Cameron {{announced plans}} to film his next Avatar-type 3D feature in a digital version of Showscan. Cameron has been pushing for movie theatres to adopt higher frame-rates to maintain the 3D effect during scenes involving high-speed motion (such as explosions). At twenty-four <b>frames</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> the 3D effect breaks down, while at forty-eight or sixty <b>frames</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> it is maintained. Sixty <b>frames</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> is difficult to achieve with conventional film because of the stress on the medium itself; recording sixty <b>frames</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> using a digital camera is commonplace.|$|R
