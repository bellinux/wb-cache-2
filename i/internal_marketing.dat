40|$|What is ‘the’ EU <b>internal</b> <b>market,</b> as economists see it? The present BEER paper {{attempts}} to survey and help readers understand various ‘economic’ {{approaches to the}} <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> idea. The paper starts with a conceptual discussion of what ‘the’ <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> is (in an economic perspective). Six different economic meanings of the <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> are presented, with the sixth one being the economic benchmark in an ideal setting. Subsequently, the question is asked what the <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> (i. e. its proper functioning) is good for. Put differently, the <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> in the EU Treaty is a means, but a means to what? Beyond the typical economic growth objectives of the Rome Treaty (still valid today, with some qualifications), other Treaty objectives have emerged. Economists typically think in means-end relationships and the instrumental role of the <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> for Treaty objectives is far from clear. The ‘new’ Commission <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> strategy of 2007 proposes a more goal-oriented <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> policy. Such a vision is more selective in picking intermediate objectives to which ‘the’ <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> should be instrumental, but it risks to ignore the major deficits in today’s internal market: services and labour! The means-end relationships get even more problematic once one begins to scrutinise all the socio-economic objectives of the current (Amsterdam/Nice) Treaty or still other intermediate objectives. The <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> (explicitly including the relevant common regulation) then becomes a ‘jack of all trades’ for the environment, {{a high level of}} social protection, innovation or ‘Social Europe’. These means/ends relationships often are ill-specified. The final section considers the future of the <b>internal</b> <b>market,</b> by distinguishing three strategies: incremental strategies (including the new <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> strategy of November 2007); the <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> as the core of the Economic Union serving the ‘proper functioning of the monetary union’; and deepening and widening of the <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> as justified by the functional subsidiarity test. Even though the latter two would seem to be preferable from an economic point of view, they currently lack political legitimacy and are therefore unlikely to be pursued in the near future...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} project was initiated {{in response to}} concerns held by the author on aspects of the European Community (EC) <b>internal</b> <b>market.</b> These concerns applied particularly to what was understood {{at the time to}} be the perceptions of EC <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> practitioners; their perceptions on the process of EC <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> technical legislative change and on how well the EC <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> was functioning. A literature review was undertaken to determine if, and if so where, the EC <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> technical legislative change process was defined and to determine which organisations were the important players in the process. The literature review was then extended to determine more about the players in the process and the information exchanges between the defined process and individuals, such as EC <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> practitioners, having a legitimate interest in the process. Also within the literature review the views of other commentators are noted and assessed. A methodological review was undertaken. This review gave rise to the formulation of a structured interview that was applied to a purposive sample of EC <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> practitioners. Two main areas were examined via the structured interview. The first was the knowledge of the overall EC <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> technical legislative change process and of its main players. The second area was the perception of the completeness of the functioning of the EC <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> possessed by EC <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> practitioners. This research concludes {{that there are a number}} of flaws in the treaty establishing the European Community; this is the treaty that includes the high level description of the EC <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> technical legislative process. One of these flaws particularly affects the EC <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> technical legislative process.

It also changed the {{corporate}} structure: instead of the FMB’s non-executive chairman, ADMARC was given an executive chairman and a Board comprising him and between four and eight directors, all appointed by the Agriculture Minister. It was given the new power to assist any public or private organization with capital, credit or other resources in any projects relating to the economic development of Malawi. ADMARC had three mandates: to promote the Malawian economy by increasing the volume of exportable economic crops and improving their quality, to develop new agricultural markets by promoting the consumption of Malawian agricultural produce abroad and to support farmers on Customary Land. To achieve its mandates, was divided into three sections dealing with <b>internal</b> <b>marketing,</b> the export trade and the management of development projects. [...] It took over the FMB monopolies over maize, tobacco and cotton, and powers to fix prices, operate markets and supply credit. ADMARC produce prices were uniform across Malawi: these rarely changed, so reducing price fluctuations. It was also a major seller of maize, with 47% of the market in 1982. Smallholders had to support ADMARC’s high operating costs and much of its profits came from underpaying them. Despite its mandate, it only re-invested 5% of funds in smallholder farms but subsidised estates and other businesses. By the mid-1980s, ADMARC diverted two-thirds of its income into estates. Until 1979, it had sound finances: when tobacco prices collapsed, its liquidity problems threatened its main creditors, Malawi’s two commercial banks.|$|E

Influence activities that arise from decentralization, imperfect monitoring, and a relative performance system are a potential liability of <b>internal</b> <b>markets,</b> coordination may be worse in <b>internal</b> <b>markets</b> than in external markets. However, strategic coordination is an advantage of <b>internal</b> <b>markets,</b> a hierarchy can more effectively implement strategic policies in <b>internal</b> <b>markets</b> than external markets. The {{results of this study}} show that profit center managers engage in influence activities by haggling over price adjustments, causing greater renegotiation costs in <b>internal</b> <b>markets</b> than in comparable external markets. However, implementation of cost reduction, which is a strategic policy, appears to be more effective in <b>internal</b> <b>markets</b> the results show that supplying profit centers disclose more private cost information than external market suppliers. Thus cooperation and competition appear to operate simultaneously in <b>internal</b> <b>markets.</b> In addition, the results suggest that <b>internal</b> <b>markets</b> appear to undermine one advantage of a vertical integration strategy the creation of unique assets, as organizational resource that can generate rents.

40|$|The EU <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> has {{predominantly}} {{been studied}} in terms of changes in delegation of authority and division of labor between EU institutions and member states. However, this EU internal focus ignores that already in 1987 {{the completion of the}} <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> was substantially left to the private European standardization organizations (ESO). The paper addresses two fundamental challenges in this transnational, public-private, and internal-external delegation of authority. First, it involves a governance challenge, because private actors are directly involved – but to a certain extent outside EU political and administrative control – in the constitution of the <b>internal</b> <b>market.</b> Second, the delegation raises important analytical questions concerning the identification of the institutional locus of European integration, when the realization of the political goals with the <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> is dependent on an inter-organizational coordination between the EU and ESO.

Within the <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> private actors are the recipients of rights and public authorities are constrained in their (regulatory) powers. The notion of this new individualism is bound up with capacities, powers, and resources that empower private actors {{to engage in the}} <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> and cross-border situations;ultimately serving the objectives the <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> seeks to attain. Yet, within thinew individualism a conceptually different class of private actors has emerged that is constrained in economic freedoms, i. e. through obligations, rather than being empowered {{in the context of the}} <b>internal</b> <b>market.</b> This thesis will enquire the reasons that led to the development of this counter-culture. Why did it emerge? To what extent does this phenomenon affect the roles of private actors in the <b>internal</b> <b>market?</b> I will demonstrate that under the counter-culture private actors are responsibilized and transformed into ‘competent authorities’, i. e. alternative forms of regulatory authority, in the <b>internal</b> <b>market.</b> Private actors are placed into systems of shared responsibilities the relationships of which are coordinated by EU <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> law. In this regard, the concept of responsibility will serve as a tool to bridge the gap between the new positions EU <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> law allocates to private actors and the emerging legal consequences, i. e. allocation of obligations or tasks. The legal contexts of EU free movement law, EU discrimination law, EU food safety law and EU data protection law will serve as case studies against which the construed conceptual framework will be tested.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{advantages and disadvantages}} with <b>internal</b> <b>markets</b> and different degrees of internal trading of services and supplies in the Norwegian Armed Forces. Different degrees of internal trading in armed forces relate mainly to the grade of internal pricing and centralised versus decentralised management of internal trading. The policy of internal pricing is common, but the level of management of <b>internal</b> <b>markets</b> varies between military capabilities and services. Overall, the support side, consisting of the Norwegian Defence Logistic Organisation and Norwegian Defence Estates Agency, seem to have advantages with this model, independent from degree of internal trading. On the other side, the operational side seems generally to have disadvantages with the <b>internal</b> <b>markets.</b> Furthermore, significant disadvantages were discovered for the units that have decentralised management. Additionally the organisation model derived {{by the process of}} creating <b>internal</b> <b>markets</b> seems to have some negative effects on the efficiency of the operational capabilities.
