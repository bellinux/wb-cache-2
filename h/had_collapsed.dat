5|$|The chain {{was part}} of the {{eventual}} dismantling of the Net Book Agreement, when in 1991, following a promotion by then rivals Dillons, the company decided to pursue its own discounting promotion on selected titles. By 1997, the agreement <b>had</b> <b>collapsed</b> and been declared illegal.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{affected}} area is extremely remote, distributing the relief supplies was difficult. Reaching some villages would require a five-hour drive over unpaved roads, some of which <b>had</b> <b>collapsed</b> or had been covered by landslides during the earthquake. Helicopters were used to provide supplies to some otherwise inaccessible areas.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1922 the Khilafat {{movement}} <b>had</b> <b>collapsed.</b> Turkey's Ataturk {{had ended}} the Caliphate, Khilafat movement ended, and Muslim support for Gandhi largely evaporated. Muslim leaders and delegates abandoned Gandhi and his Congress. Hindu-Muslim communal conflicts reignited. Deadly religious riots re-appeared in numerous cities, with 91 in United Provinces of Agra and Oudh alone.|$|E

5|$|In 1944, both Missouri and Oklahoma Row {{were sold}} to Springdale {{businessmen}} Roy Joyce and Jim Barrack. Missouri Row was torn down and sold in small lots. The roof tiles were bought by a Little Rock law firm. By 1956, the building <b>had</b> <b>collapsed,</b> leaving only a small section standing.|$|E

5|$|The F.2bs, DH-4s and one Avro 504K were {{retained}} for government use, {{and the balance}} were issued on loan as transports and training aircraft to civil aviation companies between 1920 and 1924.

50|$|According to the Gansu provincial officials, {{more than}} 1,200 {{buildings}} <b>have</b> <b>collapsed</b> and over 21,000 severely damaged. Many local buildings, often crudely constructed, {{were buried in}} the landslides caused by the earthquakes. Within the disaster zone, 20% of the buildings <b>have</b> <b>collapsed</b> and 60% are damaged. 27,360 people are estimated to have been displaced in Zhang County alone.|$|R

5|$|The {{unexpected}} French advance {{from the}} west and the fall of the Shevardino redoubt threw the Russian formation into disarray. Since the left flank of their defensive position <b>had</b> <b>collapsed,</b> Russian forces withdrew to the east, constructing a makeshift position centered around the village of Utitsa. The left flank of the Russian position was thus ripe for a flanking attack.|$|E
5|$|The {{work was}} {{undertaken}} rapidly, and 24 sites were completed and garrisoned {{by the end}} of 1540, with almost all of the rest finished {{by the end of}} 1543. By the time they were completed, however, the alliance between Charles and Francis <b>had</b> <b>collapsed</b> and the threat of imminent invasion was over.|$|E
5|$|After 1530, it was {{the colonists}} {{themselves}} who held the keys to power, installing new governors and removing them from office. By 1534, the Spanish colony in Honduras was close to collapse. Trujillo had a population of less than two hundred; {{it was the}} only Spanish settlement in Honduras, and very little territory beyond the town itself had been conquered. The Spanish were beset by infighting, and had provoked widespread indigenous uprisings. Simultaneously, the native population <b>had</b> <b>collapsed</b> as a result of disease, mistreatment, and the export of large numbers to work on the sugar plantations of the Caribbean islands.|$|E

50|$|The {{design of}} the Ghantai temple {{is similar to that}} of the Parshvanatha temple, {{although}} the Ghantai temple is nearly twice larger in size. The temple is now in ruins: its walls <b>have</b> <b>collapsed.</b> Only the pillars of its entrance porch and its maha-mandapa (large hall) have survived. The maha-mandapa has an elaborate doorway, but the enclosing walls <b>have</b> <b>collapsed.</b>|$|R
5|$|Alexios, who was {{fighting}} with his retinue alongside the Franks, {{did not immediately}} realize that his left wing <b>had</b> <b>collapsed.</b> In the meantime, on his right wing, the Chomatenoi, engaged with Tarchaneiotes's men, were outflanked and attacked in the rear by the Pechenegs, who had somehow evaded Alexios's Turkish flank-guards. The Chomatenoi too broke and fled, and Alexios's fate seemed sealed. At this point the Pechenegs failed to follow up their success, and instead turned back and began looting Bryennios's own camp. After gathering what plunder they could, they left the battle and made for their homes.|$|E
5|$|By 1924, {{the company}} had share capital of £3,500,000 (£185 million in 2013 terms); it had also issued £1,500,000 (£74 million in 2013 terms) in {{debenture}} stock in May 1922. In 1938, the company helped to finance {{the founding of the}} New Jarrow Steel Company from the old Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company which <b>had</b> <b>collapsed</b> in 1933, leading to the Jarrow March of 1936. The Consett Iron Company continued production during the Second World War using lower quality iron ore. It employed about 12,000 workers at that time.|$|E
5|$|By the 16th century Conisbrough Castle {{was in a}} poor {{state of}} repair, and a royal survey carried out in 1537 and 1538 showed that the gates, bridge {{and parts of the}} walls <b>had</b> <b>collapsed</b> in a {{spectacular}} land slippage, and that one floor of the keep had also fallen in. The collapse of the walls was a consequence of the instability of the topsoil on top of the limestone spur, which was a mixture of clay and sandstone; once the clay was washed away over time, the remaining sandstone proved extremely unstable and liable to crack.|$|E

In the meantime, Minh left Joint General Staff (JGS) {{headquarters}} and travelled to Gia Long Palace in a sedan, accompanied by Nhung. He arrived at the palace at 08:00 in full military uniform to supervise the arrest of Diệm and Nhu for the surrender ceremony.|$|E
5|$|During archaeological {{investigation}} of the ballcourt a well-preserved tennoned ballgame marker was found placed on the western bench. Its original placement was indicated by {{a hole in the}} upper part of the ballcourt wall. The second marker that would have been placed directly opposite the first has never been found and the area of the ballcourt wall where it would have been <b>had</b> <b>collapsed</b> prior to excavations. Replicas of the ballcourt marker have been placed in both walls; the original is in the Museo Nacional de Arqueología y Etnología in Guatemala City.|$|E
5|$|During the night, {{artillery}} strikes continued, eventually {{forcing the}} ICU frontlines to falter. A mutiny within the ICU caused their forces to disintegrate, and abandon both Jilib and Kismayo. At 10p.m., {{the sounds of}} battle died down. By midnight, the ICU front in Jilib <b>had</b> <b>collapsed,</b> and the ICU began to flee. By 2:00a.m., they had fled from Kismayo. Local militiamen patrolled the streets, and looting began of former ICU property. They were reported to be fleeing towards Ras Kamboni island in southern Somalia, or the Kenyan border.|$|E

5|$|Excavations {{under the}} {{supervision}} of the Deutsches Archäologisches Institut Kairo (DAIK) in 2001 and 2004 revealed that the tomb had been erected and completed in a great hurry. The building works took place in a single phase; the walls were plastered roughly; and the monument <b>had</b> <b>collapsed</b> several times over the centuries. During the Middle Kingdom, Peribsen's tomb was restored at least twice together with the tomb of Djer, which was thought to be that of Osiris.|$|E
5|$|Following {{several more}} troubled months, Jackson {{ended up in}} the hospital; he <b>had</b> <b>collapsed</b> while rehearsing for a concert in New York.

She obliged, and was admonished by a doctor and Jackson's mother Katherine along the way. Presley subsequently returned to Los Angeles. Upon being discharged from hospital, Jackson went to Disneyland Paris to recover.|$|E
5|$|Henry's {{ability to}} govern was intimately {{bound up with}} the Church, which formed the key to the {{administration}} of both England and Normandy, and this relationship changed considerably {{over the course of his}} reign. William the Conqueror had reformed the English Church with the support of his Archbishop of Canterbury, Lanfranc, who became a close colleague and advisor to the King. Under William Rufus this arrangement <b>had</b> <b>collapsed,</b> the King and Archbishop Anselm had become estranged and Anselm had gone into exile. Henry also believed in Church reform, but on taking power in England he became embroiled in the investiture controversy.|$|E
