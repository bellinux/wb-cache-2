50|$|Manuel de Ynchausti, born in 1900, was Joaquín José's only {{surviving}} son. As a result, he was {{the heir}} apparent of Ynchausti y Compañia. However, because of his youth (he was only twenty {{at the time of}} his father's death) managerial control was instead entrusted to members of the Elizalde family until he came of age. By 1927, Manuel felt it was time to become more active. He completed his law studies at the University of Madrid and married a young Basque woman from San Sebastián, Ana Belén Laurrari. They returned to Manila and settled in the family's ancestral home along Calle Real. But, by that time he found it difficult to become involved because of certain internal corporate issues. Spurred by those issues, as well as changing global economic conditions, Manuel made the difficult decision to divest Ynchausti y Compañia of certain partners and some of its industrial assets, among them Ynchausti Shipping, Tanduay, YCO Paints and <b>Floor</b> <b>Wax,</b> Rizal Cement, and their sugar interests. Rizal Cement Factory, located in Binangonan, Rizal was established in 1924 and was the first cement factory in the Philippines. It was sold to Vicente Madrigal.

50|$|Growing {{concerns}} about {{the health effects of}} acids and solvents {{led to the development of}} less toxic etching methods in the late 20th century. An early innovation was the use of <b>floor</b> <b>wax</b> as a hard ground for coating the plate. Others, such as printmakers Mark Zaffron and Keith Howard, developed systems using acrylic polymers as a ground and ferric chloride for etching. The polymers are removed with sodium carbonate (washing soda) solution, rather than solvents. When used for etching, ferric chloride does not produce a corrosive gas, as acids do, thus eliminating another danger of traditional etching.|$|E
