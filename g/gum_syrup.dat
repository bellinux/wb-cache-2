60|$|Some of {{the leaves}} which were not {{affected}} by the non-nitrogenous fluids were, as above stated, immediately afterwards tested with bits of meat, and were thus proved {{to be in an}} active condition. But in addition to these trials, twenty-three {{of the leaves}}, with drops of <b>gum,</b> <b>syrup,</b> or starch, still lying on their discs, which had produced no effect in the course of between 24 hrs. and 48 hrs., were then tested with drops of milk, urine, or albumen. Of the twenty-three leaves thus treated, seventeen had their tentacles, and in some cases their blades, well inflected; but their powers were somewhat impaired, for the rate of movement was decidedly slower than when fresh leaves were treated with these same nitrogenous fluids. This impairment, as well as the insensibility of six of the leaves, may be attributed to injury from exosmose, caused by the density of the fluids placed on their discs.|$|E

5000|$|Iced {{coffee is}} cold coffee with ice. The iced latte and iced mocha are examples. There are various brewing methods, with the {{fundamental}} division being cold brew - brewing the coffee cold, yielding different flavor, but not requiring cooling - or brewing hot and then cooling, generally by simply pouring over ice or into ice cold milk. In case of hot brewing {{this can be}} normally brewed coffee (drip, press pot, etc.), or espresso. Also in hot brewing, sweeteners and flavorings are often mixed into the hot coffee before cooling, due to faster dissolution in hot water.

6000|$|... 1594. That I {{may not be}} {{misunderstood}} (1587.), I must observe {{here that}} I do not consider the cones produced as the result only of the current of air or other insulating dielectric over their surface. When the drop is of badly conducting matter, {{a part of the}} effect is due to the electrified state of the particles, and this part constitutes almost the whole when the matter is melted sealing-wax, oil of turpentine, and similar insulating bodies (1588.). But even when the drop is of good conducting matter, as water, solutions, or mercury, though the effect above spoken of will then be insensible (1607.), still it is not the mere current of air or other dielectric which produces all the change of form; for a part is due to those attractive forces by which the charged drop, if free to move, would travel along the line of strongest induction, and not being free to move, has its form elongated until the sum of the different forces tending to produce this form is balanced by the cohesive attraction of the fluid. The effect of the attractive forces are well shown when treacle, <b>gum</b> water, or <b>syrup</b> is used; for the long threads which spin out, {{at the same time that}} they form the axes of the currents of air, which may still be considered as determined at their points, are like flexible conductors, and show by their directions in what way the attractive forces draw them.|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{purpose was}} to {{evaluate}} the microbiological mechanism of action of xylitol and to assess its use in clinical practice for preventing acute otitis media (AOM). To test whether the effect of xylitol on S. pneumoniae is inhibited by fructose, a total of 20 strains of S. pneumoniae were exposed to xylitol {{in the presence of}} fructose and other carbon sources. Addition of 5 % xylitol to the media resulted in marked growth inhibition, an effect which was totally eliminated in the presence of 1 %, 2. 5 % or 5 % fructose but not in the presence of 1 % or 5 % glucose, 1 % galactose or 1 % sucrose. The inhibition of pneumococcal growth is probably mediated via a fructose phosphotransferase system in a similar manner to that seen in mutans streptococci. Sorbitol alone did not affect the growth of pneumococci, and thus sorbitol is unlikely to provide any clinical benefit in the prevention of AOM. To evaluate the effect of xylitol on the ultrastructure of S. pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae) and on the pneumococcal phenotype, five strains of S. pneumoniae and one strain of H. influenzae were examined by electron microscopy after xylitol exposure. Xylitol damaged the ultrastructure of the pneumococci. Some of the bacteria were lysed and the cell wall of the remaining ones became more diffuse and the polysaccharide capsule was ragged. The resulting morphology was identical to that of the transparent pneumococcal phenotypic variant. The properties of the transparent variants of pneumococci could explain the clinical efficacy of xylitol in preventing AOM despite the lack of effect on the nasopharyngeal carriage of pneumococci. The cell wall of H. influenzae became slightly thicker, but the morphology remained otherwise unchanged. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of xylitol locally in the nasopharynx, xylitol concentrations were measured in the saliva of 65 children by enzymatic assay after giving them xylitol chewing <b>gum</b> or <b>syrup</b> at doses equal to those used in clinical trials. Concentrations high enough to have an antimicrobial effect were attained, but the xylitol disappeared from the saliva within 15 minutes, which indicates that high peak concentrations may be more important for efficacy than the time for which the concentration exceeds the level needed for an antimicrobial effect. To find a more convenient dosing regime for xylitol prophylaxis, xylitol was administered to 1277 children only during an acute respiratory infection (ARI) in a randomised placebo-controlled trial. The occurrence of AOM during ARI was 34 / 166 (20. 5 %) in the xylitol mixture group as compared with 32 / 157 (20. 4 %) among the children receiving the control mixture. Among older children receiving control chewing gum, xylitol chewing gum or xylitol lozenges, AOM was experienced by 24 / 218 (11. 0 %), 31 / 220 (14. 1 %) and 34 / 219 (15. 5 %) respectively. None {{of the differences between the}} groups was statistically significant. Xylitol should be used continuously in AOM prophylaxis, as it proved ineffective when used only during URI...|$|R
40|$|Cassava is an {{important}} crop in India, with an area of 289, 000 ha and production of 5. 6 million t of fresh roots in 1991. It is mainly cultivated in Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and in the Northeastern states. A large variation in cassava consumption exists between {{urban and rural areas}} in India. About 70 % of cassava production in Kerala is used for food. In Tamil Nadu, however, only 25 % is used for human consumption, while the rest is used for industrial utilization, mainly for starch production. About 17 % of cassava production in the country is used for animal feed. Cassava is used in industry for production of starch, sago, liquid glucose, dextrin, vitamin C, <b>gums</b> and high-fructose <b>syrup.</b> Earlier agronomy research concentrated on the development of cultural practices and soil fertility management for cassava grown in monoculture. Recently, research has focused on the development of cassava-based cropping systems, soil fertility management with emphasis on micronutrients and bio-fertilizers (especially VA-mycorrhiza), low-input technology, water management and production practices for non-traditional areas. Short-duration cassava cultivars were shown to produce higher root yields at closer spacing of 75 x 75 cm, while for cassava grown under coconuts a plant population of 8000 /ha was found to be optimum. Under intercropping with groundnut or cowpea the paired-row cassava system performed best. In acid infertile soils in Kerala, continuous cropping of cassava with application of only NPK chemical fertilizers resulted in a depletion of Ca, Mg, Cu and Zn in the soil. From the study on interrelationships of cations the optimum doses of K, Ca and Mg were found to be 146 kg K^O, 56 kg Ca and 37 kg Mg/ha. Incorporation of ZnSO at 12. 5 kg/ha increased the root yield 12 %. An NPK application of 50 : 62 : 62 kg/ha was sufficient for the cassava-ground nut intercropping system if the haulms of groundnut were turned back into the soil. For cassava grown under coconut an NPK rate of 50 : 50 : 100 kg/ha gave higher net returns. For rice-cassava sequential cropping on paddy soils the P application rate to cassava could be reduced to 25 kg P O /ha. In calcareous soils of Tamil Nadu short duration cassava cultivars performed better at lower levels of NPK (75 : 25 : 75 kg/ha). Application of a liquid NPK fertilizer at the rate of 8 - 8 - 8 kg/ha was equally effective as the same rate applied in solid form. Inoculation of VA mycorrhiza (VAM) enhanced the dry matter production, root yield and uptake of P, Cu and Zn in cassava. For successful field inoculation a nursery techniquewas developed. To realize the production potential of high-yielding cassava, the application of NPK at 150 : 100 : 150 kg/ha and supplementary irrigation at an IW/CPE ratio of 1 were found necessary. In cassava-groundnut intercropping systems, supplementary irrigation during drought periods at 25 mm/week enhanced the yield of both crops. Studies on effects of subsoil moisture on cassava showed that a shallow water table (around 40 cm from the surface) depressed root yields...|$|R
