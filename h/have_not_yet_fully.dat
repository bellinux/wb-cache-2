The monument receives strict conservation protection, with exceptions for traditional Native Hawaiian uses and limited tourism.|$|E
5|$|Following his 2009–10 OHL season, it was {{expected}} Hodgson would join the Manitoba Moose for a second consecutive AHL playoff season. However, after being assessed by Canucks team doctors, his broken toe was judged to <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>fully</b> healed {{and he was not}} cleared for AHL assignment. Hodgson additionally believed that he had re-injured his back while colliding head-first into the boards during Game 7 of the opening playoff round. He underwent an MRI in the off-season, which uncovered the misdiagnosed bulging disc to be a muscle strain instead. With the Canucks' consent, he trained in the off-season with former NHL player Gary Roberts, who had himself overcome a back injury during his career.|$|E
25|$|The Insular Mountains on {{the coast}} of British Columbia <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>fully</b> emerged above sea level, and Vancouver Island and Haida Gwaii are just the higher {{elevations}} of the range, which was in fact fully exposed during the last ice age when the continental shelf in this area was a broad coastal plain. Although the Coast Mountains are commonly considered to be the westernmost range of the American cordillera, the Insular Mountains are the true westernmost range. Through the most recent ice age about 18,000 years ago, ice enclosed nearly all of the mountains. Glaciers that ran down to the Pacific Ocean sharpened the valley faces and eroded their bottoms.|$|E

2500|$|In {{recent times}} {{there has been}} more of an {{emphasis}} on the [...] "physiological" [...] ripeness of the grape, usually in the form of tannins and other phenolics. Currently, tasting {{is the only way to}} measure tannin ripeness, which can take experience and skill to do accurately. Viticulturalists <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>fully</b> explained the complex processes that go into the ripening of tannins but most believe it begins with the polymerization of small astringent tannins into larger molecules which are perceived by the taste buds as being softer.|$|E

2500|$|Her {{songs were}} set to music by Francesco Berger and Lady Charlesmont, and later on by Margaret Ruthven Lang, Arthur Foote, Ethelbert Nevin, and many others. Marston wrote her, [...] "Much as we all love and admire your work, {{it seems to me}} we <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>fully</b> {{realized}} the unostentatious loveliness of your lyrics, as fine for lyrics as your best sonnets are for sonnets. 'How Long' struck me more than ever. The first verse is eminently characteristic of you, exhibiting in a very marked degree what runs through nearly all of your poems, the most exquisite and subtle blending of strong emotion with the sense of external nature. It seems to me this perfect poem is possessed by the melancholy yet tender music of winds sighing at twilight, in some churchyard, through old trees that watch beside silent graves. Then nothing can be more subtly beautiful than the closing lines of the sonnet, 'In Time to Come':— [...] "'Which was it spoke to you, the wind or I? I think you, musing, scarcely will have heard.'" [...] Marston wrote her again concerning [...] "The House of Death" [...] that it was one of the most beautiful, the most powerful poems he knew. [...] "No poem gives me such an idea of the heartlessness of Nature. The poem is Death within and Summer without—light girdling darkness—and it leaves a picture and impression on the mind never to be effaced." [...] The poem of [...] "The House of Death" [...] is unequalled in its tragic beauty and sweetness. It was apropos of this volume that in one of his letters to her Robert Browning said he had closed the book with music in his ears and flowers before his eyes, and not without thoughts across his brain. And it was concerning a later poem, [...] "Laus Veneris," [...] inspired by a painting of his own, that Edward Burne-Jones said it made him work all the more confidently and was a real refreshment.|$|E

60|$|Now, {{the modern}} Evolutionists {{have made no}} real use {{of the idea of}} evolution, {{especially}} in the matter of social prediction. They always fall into what is (from their logical point of view) the error of supposing that evolution knows what it is doing. They predict the State of the future as a fruit rounded and polished. But the whole point of evolution (the only point there is in it) is that no State will ever be rounded and polished, because it will always contain some organs that outlived their use, and some that <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>fully</b> found theirs. If we wish to prophesy what will happen, we must imagine things now moderate grown enormous; things now local grown universal; things now promising grown triumphant; primroses bigger than sunflowers, and sparrows stalking about like flamingoes.|$|E
60|$|But we <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>fully</b> {{grasped the}} extent of the {{relationship}} between the first Teutonic settlers in Britain and their continental brethren. Not only are the true Englishmen of modern England distantly connected with the Franks, who never to our knowledge took part in the colonisation of the island at all; and more closely connected with the Frisians, some of whom probably accompanied the earliest piratical hordes; as well as with the Danes, who settled at a later date in all the northern counties: but they are also most closely connected of all with those members of the colonising tribes who did not themselves bear a share in the settlement, and whose descendants are still living in Denmark and in various parts of Germany. The English proper, it is true, seem to have deserted their old home in Sleswick in a body; so that, according to Bæda, the Christian historian of Northumberland, in his time this oldest England by the shores of the Baltic lay waste and unpeopled, through the completeness of the exodus. But the Jutes appear to have migrated in small numbers, while the larger part of the tribe remained at home in their native marshland; and of the more numerous Saxons, though a great swarm went out to conquer southern Britain, a vast body was still left behind in Germany, where it continued independent and pagan till the time of Karl the Great, long after the Teutonic colonists of Britain had grown into peaceable and civilised Christians. It is from the statements of later historians with regard to these continental Saxons that our knowledge of the early English customs and institutions, during the continental period of English history, must be mainly inferred. We gather our picture of the English and Saxons who first came to this country from the picture drawn for us of those among their brethren whom they left behind in the primitive English home.|$|E
60|$|I most cordially thank his Honor Mayor Wilson, and the {{citizens}} of Pittsburg generally, for their flattering reception. I am the more grateful because I {{know that it is}} not given to me alone, but to the cause I represent, which clearly proves to me their good-will, and that sincere feeling is at the bottom of it. And here I may remark that in every short address I have made to the people, in every crowd through which I have passed of late, some allusion has been made to the present distracted condition of the country. It is natural to expect that I should say something on this subject; but to touch upon it at all would involve an elaborate discussion of a great many questions and circumstances, requiring more time than I can at present command, and would, perhaps, unnecessarily commit me upon matters which <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>fully</b> developed themselves. The condition of the country is an extraordinary one, and fills the mind of every patriot with anxiety. It is my intention to give this subject all the consideration I possibly can before specially deciding in regard to it, so that when I do speak it may be as nearly right as possible. When I do speak I hope I may say nothing in opposition to the spirit of the Constitution, contrary to the integrity of the Union, or which will prove inimical to the liberties of the people, or to the peace of the whole country. And furthermore, when the time arrives for me to speak on this great subject, I hope I may say nothing to disappoint the people generally throughout the country, especially if the expectation has been based upon anything which I may have heretofore said. Notwithstanding the troubles across the river [the speaker pointing southwardly across the Monongahela, and smiling], there is no crisis but an artificial one. What is there now to warrant the condition of affairs presented by our friends over the river? Take even their own view of the questions involved, and there is nothing to justify the course they are pursuing. I repeat, then, there is no crisis, excepting such a one as may be gotten up at any time by turbulent men aided by designing politicians, My advice to them, under such circumstances, is to keep cool. If the great American people only keep their temper {{on both sides of the}} line, the troubles will come to an end, and the question which now distracts the country will be settled, just as surely as all other difficulties of a like character which have originated in this government have been adjusted. Let the people on both sides keep their self-possession, and just as other clouds have cleared away in due time, so will this great nation continue to prosper as heretofore. But, fellow-citizens, I have spoken longer on this subject than I intended at the outset.|$|E
