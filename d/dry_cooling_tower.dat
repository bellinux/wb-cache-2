5000|$|In some {{circumstances}} {{the use of}} an enabling technology, either diurnal thermal energy storage or seasonal thermal energy storage (STES, which allows heat or cold storage between opposing seasons), is necessary to make energy recovery practicable. One example is waste heat from air conditioning machinery stored in a buffer tank to aid in night time heating. Another is an STES application at a foundry in Sweden. Waste heat is recovered and stored in a large mass of native bedrock which is penetrated by a cluster of 140 heat exchanger equipped boreholes (155mm diameter) that are 150m deep. This store is used for heating an adjacent factory as needed, even months later. An example of using STES to recover and utilize natural heat that otherwise would be wasted is the Drake Landing Solar Community in Alberta, Canada. The community uses a cluster of boreholes in bedrock for interseasonal heat storage, and this enables obtaining 97 percent of the year-round space heating from solar thermal collectors on the garage roofs. [...] Another STES application is recovering the cold of winter by circulating water through a <b>dry</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>tower,</b> and using that to chill a deep aquifer or borehole cluster. The chill is later recovered from the storage for summer air conditioning.

The effects of drop size distribution and air velocity on droplet evaporation and cooling effectiveness were investigated.

If using existing dry cooling technology, the CST power generation will be reduced significantly at high ambient temperatures. This paper presents design options of a novel cooling tower design concept {{with the potential to}} maintain the design-point performance even on very hot days. In this new concept, a natural draft <b>dry</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>tower</b> is modified by adding a solar collector around its base. The function of the solar collector is to make the air inside the cooling tower hotter so the buoyancy force increases. In a natural draft <b>dry</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>tower,</b> increased buoyancy means increased air flow rate through the heat exchangers and, therefore, increased heat transfer capacity. The end result is power plant efficiencies significantly higher than what could be achieved with the unmodified design...|$|E

40|$|Climatic {{changes and}} {{indiscriminate}} use {{of water resources}} have led to increasingly serious water shortages. This situation has been followed by more and more restrictive legislation aimed at limiting water consumption and thermal pollution. Rejecting enormous quantities of heat in large condensation type thermoelectric plants has {{become more and more}} of a problem. In some cases the solution has been found in the use of <b>dry</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>towers</b> that exploit the atmosphere's own cooling power. Given the very low density of the water vapour at the condenser, however, this solution calls for very big exchangers and leads to a rise in heat rejection temperature. To solve these and other problems, the idea of using alternative fluids in the cooling circuit, or even in the final phase of expansion, has been presented. Thus experimental systems have been built using ammonia both in <b>dry</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>towers</b> and in bottoming cycles.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new concept}} of hybrid cooling, named solar enhanced natural draft <b>dry</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>tower</b> (SENDDCT), in which solar collectors are added to traditional natural draft dry cooling towers to increase their performance. The purpose of using solar energy in this new cooling system {{is to increase the}} suction through the tower so that more air flow is achieved through the compact heat exchangers that cool condensers of a geothermal power plant. For the same size of the cooling tower, more air flow across the heat exchangers means more heat can be rejected by the system.

40|$|As {{fluidized}} beds {{can result}} in {{an order of magnitude}} increase in the heat transfer coefficinet for a surface, they can potentially be coupled with <b>dry</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>towers</b> for power plant heat rejection. On such a large scale, economic considerations necessitate the use of an inexpensive particle and shallow bed depths. Existing heat transfer mechanism models for fluidized beds are discussed, and a new model presented. Heat transfer coefficients from a horizontal tube in a row of dummy tubes to a shallow fluidized bed were experimentally measured. Coefficients from banks of horizontal tubes are lower than coefficients from vertical walls primarily because of particle stagnation on the tube tops and particle recirculation problems. Experimentally, different tube and distributer geometries were tried in order to reduce stagnations and enhance particle recirculation. Experimental data for these different geometries is compared to exising horizontal tube correlations and the new model. The RMS deviation of data from the model is less than 17 %. The best correlation was obtained by modifying the Vreedenberg correlation to include a dependency on the particle fraction of the bed. The RMS deviation of data from the modified Vreedenberg correlation was 13. 8 %. Using both experimental data and the modified Vreedenberg correlation, economic optimizations were performed to compare fluidized bed <b>dry</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>towers</b> to a finned tube tower. For a 1000 mw plant, heat exchanger costs are 13 % lower for fluidized beds, but the fluidized bed is severely penalized by the cost for the power needed to keep the bed fluidized. The incremental cost of the fluidized bed is 16 % higher than that for a finned surface, but rapidly approaches the finned tube incremental cost as the particle size and bed depth are reduced.
