40|$|The {{feasibility}} of operating small thrust level <b>electrothermal</b> <b>thrusters</b> with monopropellants other than MIL-grade hydrazine was studied. Analytical study, design, and fabrication of demonstration thrusters was performed, and an evaluation test program was initiated to evaluate monopropellants with freezing points lower than MIL-grade hydrazine, {{and to determine}} their applicability to <b>electrothermal</b> <b>thrusters</b> for spacecraft attitude control.

40|$|An {{improved}} electrothermal {{device is}} disclosed. An <b>electrothermal</b> <b>thruster</b> utilizes a generally cylindrical heat exchanger chamber to convert electricity to heat {{which raises the}} propellant temperature. A textured, high emissivity heat element radiatively transfers heat to the inner wall of this chamber that is ion beam morphologically controlled for high absorptivity.

40|$|As {{microsatellite}} technology progresses, {{the need}} for improved on-board propulsion systems has grown. The Purdue Laboratory for Electric and Advanced Propulsion (LEAP) <b>electrothermal</b> <b>thruster</b> is a device that attempts to fill this niche, by providing a low-power, non-complex <b>electrothermal</b> <b>thruster</b> that shows vast improvements over conventional cold gas thrusters. Preliminary tests {{have shown that the}} proposed RF thruster can improve upon cold gas thrust by up to 75 %. ^ To further investigate the viability of this concept, a sophisticated diagnostics system is necessary; in addition to thrust, mass flow, and power/frequency, a detailed analysis of the feasibility of a low-power RF thruster also requires an investigation of its plasma and plume characteristics {{in order to determine the}} thruster’s performance. Experimental plume diagnostics of RF thrusters are inherently difficult due to the high-frequency oscillations that occur in the thruster chamber, as well as the electrical interference produced by the RF signal itself. ^ In this thesis, a double Langmuir probe apparatus was designed and used to obtain electron temperature and electron number density measurements in the plume of the LEAP <b>electrothermal</b> <b>thruster.</b> To simplify the diagnostics system and provide a baseline for future comparison, the thruster plume that was investigated was of the LEAP thruster operating in DC-mode, producing a glow discharge. This experimental investigation provides further information about the plume, and about the relationship between the plume characteristics and the variables of interest of the RF thruster – voltage, power, and mass flow rate. ^ The thruster used in this study is a cylindrical geometry prototype with a ¾” outer electrode bore, and a ¼” inner electrode diameter, arranged concentrically and separated by an alumina dielectric sleeve. The experimental setup includes a Langmuir double probe in a fixed location with respect to the thruster. It was found to be necessary to reduce flow velocity as much as possible, which indicates a very low degree of ionization, necessitating the removal of the nozzle plate. Electron temperatures were found to be within 2 - 3 eV, depending heavily on mass flow, but not on the applied DC voltage. ...|$|E

40|$|High-performance <b>electrothermal</b> <b>thrusters</b> {{operate in}} a low nozzle-throat Reynolds number regime. Under these conditions, the flow {{boundary}} layer occupies a large volume inside the nozzle, contributing to large viscous losses. Four nozzles (conical, bell, trumpet, and modified trumpet) and a sharp-edged orifice were evaluated over a Reynolds number range of 500 to 9000 with unheated nitrogen and hydrogen. The nozzles showed significant decreases in specific impulse efficiency with decreasing Reynolds number. At Reynolds numbers less than 1000, all four nozzles were probably filled with a large boundary layer. The discharge coefficient decreased with Reynolds number {{in the same manner}} as the specific impulse efficiency. The bell and modified trumpet nozzles had discharge coefficients 4 to 8 percent higher than those of the cone or trumpet nozzles. The Two-Dimensional Kinetics (TDK) nozzle analysis computer program was used to predict nozzle performance. The results were then compared to the experimental results in order to determine the accuracy of the program within this flow regime...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of electric propulsion to communications satellites, however, {{has been limited}} {{to the use of}} hydrazine thrusters with electric heaters for thrust and specific impulse augmentation. These <b>electrothermal</b> <b>thrusters</b> operate at specific impulse levels of approximately 300 s with heater powers of about 500 W. Low power arcjets (1 - 3 kW) are currently being investigated as a way to increase specific impulse levels to approximately 500 s. Ion propulsion systems can easily produce specific impulses of 3000 s or greater, but have yet to be applied to communications satellites. The reasons most often given for not using ion propulsion systems are their high level of overall complexity, low thrust with long burn times, and the difficulty of integrating the propulsion system into existing commercial spacecraft busses. The Electrostatic Plasma Accelerator (EPA) is a thruster concept which promises specific impulse levels between low power arcjets and those of the ion engine while retaining the relative simplicity of the arcjet. The EPA thruster produces thrust through the electrostatic acceleration of a moderately dense plasma. No accelerating electrodes are used and the specific impulse is a direct function of the applied discharge voltage and the propellant atomic mass...|$|R

40|$|The {{operating}} {{characteristics of a}} prototype two-stage microwave <b>electrothermal</b> <b>thruster</b> (MET) have been investigated. The thruster incorporates a novel supersonic energy addition stage. A Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF) technique was used to make measurements of temperature and velocity in the exhaust plume, with and without the supersonic energy addition. A numerical model was developed to simulate microwave-sustained discharge in the thruster with argon as the propellant gas. The simulation results agreed with the experimental observations of change both in temperature and plume velocity as energy {{is added to the}} supersonic stage of the thruster. In general, as a result of supersonic energy addition, a reduction in temperature and exhaust velocity along the centerline of the thruster was observed.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{experimental results}} from {{an investigation of}} a pulsed <b>electrothermal</b> (PET) <b>thruster</b> using water propellant. The PET thruster is operated on a calibrated thrust stand, and produces a thrust to power ratio of T/P = 0. 07 + or - 0. 01 N/kW. The discharge conditions are inferred from a numerical model which predicts pressure and temperature levels of 300 - 500 atm and 20, 000 K, respectively. These values in turn correctly predict the measured values of impulse bit and discharge resistance. The inferred ideal exhaust velocity from these conditions is 17 km/sec, but the injection of water propellant produces a test tank background pressure of 10 - 20 Torr, which reduces the exhaust velocity to 14 km/sec.
