25|$|It is this {{commitment}} to man's dignity and relief of humanity that inspires the Ismā'īlī Imāmat's philanthropic institutions. Giving of one's competence, sharing one's time, material or intellectual ability with those among whom one lives, for {{the relief of}} hardship, pain or <b>ignorance</b> <b>is</b> a deeply ingrained tradition which shapes the social conscience of the Ismā'īlī Muslim community.|$|E

Of these modern writers, Nuruddin Farah is probably the most celebrated. Books such as From a Crooked Rib and Links are considered important literary achievements, works that have earned Farah, among other accolades, the 1998 Neustadt International Prize for Literature.

25|$|The written work of Somananda {{contains}} more than philosophical system building. It also contains {{an account of the}} rival schools of philosophy and a series of refutations based on logic. For example, Somananda disagrees with the gross realism of the Nyaya-Vaisesika system, the subtle realism of Samkhya, and the idealism of Vedanta, or that of Vijnanavada of Buddhism. In his view, the universe is an appearance, but not of Maya (illusion) but of the free will of Shiva. In reality the universe is Shiva himself. Instead of postulating an principle of beginning-less ignorance avidya like Advaita Vedanta, he points out that it is though the free-will of Shiva, Svatantriya, that ignorance appears. <b>Ignorance</b> <b>is</b> not an ontological reality but an epistemological phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|Samkhya school {{suggests}} that jnana (knowledge) is a sufficient means to moksha, Patanjali {{suggests that}} systematic techniques/practice (personal experimentation) combined with Samkhya's approach to knowledge is {{the path to}} moksha. Patanjali holds that <b>ignorance</b> <b>is</b> the cause of suffering and saṁsāra. Liberation, like many other schools, is removal of ignorance, which is achieved through discriminative discernment, knowledge and self-awareness. The Yoga Sūtras is Yoga school's treatise on how to accomplish this. Samādhi is the state where ecstatic awareness develops, state Yoga scholars, {{and this is how}} one starts the process of becoming aware of Purusa and true Self. It further claims that this awareness is eternal, and once this awareness is achieved, a person cannot ever cease being aware; this is moksha, the soteriological goal in Hinduism.|$|E
25|$|The {{theory of}} ignorance, by Lionel Robbins, {{focuses on the}} market failure as causes for lack of {{economic}} development. It describes the purpose of governments as the distribution of resources. As resources are scarce, the regime has to allocate those resources wisely to encourage economic growth. Therefore, lack of economic growth {{is caused by the}} inability to carry out correct decisions in allocating economic resources. For example, the previous president of Ghana, Kwame Nkrumah, focused his policies only on developing the country's industries, {{which turned out to be}} disastrous to the economy. His successor, Kofi Abrefa Busia, knowing the mistakes of Nkrumah, still carried out the same expansionary economic policy, not because he did not know what policy was good or bad—because of ignorance—but because the institutional design in Ghana pushed him to do so. This example demonstrates that ignorance oversimplifies the situations and cannot offer a satisfactory explanation for why nations fail. First, this theory assumes that rulers are benevolent, and ignore the possibility that rulers intentionally carry out bad economic decisions for personal interests. Second, if a leader's <b>ignorance</b> <b>is</b> the cause, then by having a better and less ignorant leader, the country will witness greater economic growth. Yet, this isn't always the case.|$|E

25|$|Later that year, {{following}} {{the example of}} a friend Joe Wallace (Jason Rush) who had told his parents about being gay and HIV-positive, Mark decides to tell his parents. By now, he is dating Rachel Kominski (Jacquetta May), who advises him not to but Mark is tired of the pretence. On Boxing Day Mark tells Pauline and Arthur that he is HIV-positive. They sit in stunned silence while he scatters helpful leaflets around the house and then goes away for a while. On his return, he faces Pauline's irrational terror and Arthur's hostility. Arthur's <b>ignorance</b> <b>is</b> apparent initially as he fears that Mark will pass HIV on to him; he even bleaches everything Mark touches to avoid infection. Pauline and Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully) are understandably distraught but help Arthur to understand the illness, and are a huge support to Mark. Mark's relationship with Rachel ends, and the animosity at home send Mark back to his girlfriend Gill, who moves to London and becomes seriously ill. Gill's HIV has already progressed into AIDS and her deterioration is rapid. She is diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and goes into a hospice. Mark realises that he is in love with her and asks her to marry him. Mark and Gill marry, and their honeymoon consists of one night in a hotel, before Gill returns to the hospice and dies.|$|E
500|$|As a {{film about}} the {{struggle}} between freedom and the state, V for Vendetta takes imagery from many classic totalitarian icons both real and fictional, including the Third Reich and George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four. For example, Adam Sutler primarily appears on large video screens and on portraits in people's homes, both common features among modern totalitarian regimes and reminiscent {{of the image of}} Big Brother. The slogan [...] "Strength through Unity. Unity through Faith" [...] is displayed prominently across London, similar in cadence to [...] "War is Peace. Freedom is Slavery. <b>Ignorance</b> <b>is</b> Strength" [...] in Orwell's book. There is also the state's use of mass surveillance, such as closed-circuit television, on its citizens. Valerie was sent to a detention facility for lesbianism and then had medical experiments performed on her, reminiscent of the persecution of homosexuals in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust. The name [...] "Adam Sutler" [...] and his hysterical style of speech are inspired by Adolf Hitler although Jews appear to have been replaced by Muslims as a target for persecution. Norsefire has replaced St George's Cross with a national symbol similar to the modern Cross of Lorraine (both crossbars near the top). This was a symbol used by Free French Forces during World War II, as it was a traditional symbol of French patriotism that could be used as an answer to the Nazis' swastika.|$|E
500|$|The {{impressive}} {{orange tree}} {{served as a}} metaphor for Stowe in Palmetto Leaves. She calls it [...] "the fairest, the noblest, the most generous, it is the most surprising and abundant of all trees which the Lord God caused to grow eastward in Eden", and compares it to her task of educating emancipated slaves. When she first arrived in Mandarin, from 1868 to 1870, religious services were held in the Stowes' home, with Calvin presiding and Stowe teaching Sunday School to both black and white children and sometimes serving as an acolyte during services. Stowe purchased a lot in 1869 to build a church for her neighbors that would double as a school to educate children, freed slaves, and anyone eager to learn. Though she encountered considerable frustration in dealing with the bureaucracy of the Freedmen's Bureau, construction was finished within a year and a teacher was in place, procured from Brooklyn, New York. Stowe had an organ that was rolled from her home to the church, but after it became too difficult to roll back and forth, they locked it in a closet in the school. The building burned down to Stowe's deep dismay, probably because of some drifters who spent the night in it and caught the southern pine wood on fire from carelessness, although Olav Thulesius suggests it was arson committed by Stowe's neighbors who did not appreciate her efforts to educate black children. After a frost in 1835, the orange trees in north Florida were killed, even underground, but they sprouted back only to be assaulted by insects, yet they recovered. While her neighbors helped to raise funds to rebuild the church, Stowe and the small community handed spellers to local blacks who were eager to learn. She decried the delay in the children's education: [...] "To see people who are willing and anxious to be taught growing up in <b>ignorance</b> <b>is</b> the sorest sight that can afflict one".|$|E

500|$|In {{his review}} of the series, Martin called them as the [...] "most {{entertaining}} characters" [...] of the series and [...] "one of anime's liveliest and most entertaining couples".

He felt that their presence [...] "elevates the series from merely {{a very good one}} to a truly exceptional one." [...] He believes that they always [...] "make the most of their screen time", noting how every one of their actions [...] "give an entirely new twist to the events otherwise playing out normally." [...] Carl Kimlinger, also from ANN, adds that [...] "the things those two can do to a well-laid plan are simply appalling." [...] Davey Jones of Active Anime felt the pair was the [...] "highlight of the story" [...] and should have their own series. Chris Beveridge from Mania Entertainment described the two as [...] "very off center in a colorful and fun way" [...] and believed they stood out from the large cast because they were [...] "far more outgoing." [...] He felt that the connections they make {{with the rest of the}} cast [...] "are fun to watch and there's only a kind of elegance to it". Beveridge commented that [...] "when this pair comes on the screen, [...] can’t help but smile" [...] and that he [...] "enjoy all of the scenes that involve [...] because they bring such a lighthearted aspect to the show that’s definitely needed to break up the more intense scenes." [...] DVD Talk's Todd Douglass felt that Isaac and Miria are [...] "the uplifting and energetic component of [...] show," [...] feeling that it is entertaining to see how they influenced the events. Nick Hartel, also from DVD Talk, believed that it would be cruel not to mention them. He described them to be filled with [...] "a maniac energy, often brought to a screeching halt by melodramatic breakdowns over trivial occurrences or bold assumptions." [...] Although he admit they seem to have to place in the series at first, he notes that their interactions with other characters [...] "causes a drastic shift in tone." [...] He comments that as the plot progresses, the pair [...] "become a bright spot as storylines take dark turns and serve as a reminder of the goodness that makes up the vast majority of the world." [...] Daryl Surat of the Anime World Order Podcast and quest Mike Toole believed that out of every other character in the ensemble cast, the pair are the [...] "default protagonists" [...] simply because they meet every other character. They also felt that if <b>ignorance</b> <b>is</b> bliss, they are the happiest people [...] "in the world" [...] because they are [...] "that stupid". The two characters were compared to Bonnie and Clyde, but the reviewers felt that were more like Blue Falcon and Dynomutt, characters from the animated series Dynomutt, Dog Wonder. Even if the events become grim, the reviewers could not help but smile as Isaac and Miria appear. ANN columnist Erin Finnegan described Isaac and Miria as [...] " [...] a couple of completely loveable weirdoes". She agreed that the subplot revolving around them [...] "takes some of the edge off the dark moments." [...] Amanda Tarbet of SequentialTart.com drew parallels between the duo and the trickster god archetype. She compared them to the kitsune of Japanese folklore, which are portrayed [...] "as tricksters, but also as nurturing characters such as guardians and friends". She felt that Isaac and Miria [...] "represent this duality perfectly." [...] Tarbet also described them as part Bonnie and Clyde and part Rodgers and Hammerstein.|$|E
