40|$|Introduction: Gag reflex {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{problems}} during dental procedures, especially during radiography and impression taking. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of Elaeagnus angustifolia drug film on gag reflex. Materials and methods: One hundred patients referring to the Radiology Department of Isfahan School of Dentistry were selected for the purpose of this double-blind clinical trial and randomly divided into two groups. The gag reflex was provoked and then in 50 patients, medication A (placebo) and in 50 others medication B containing Elaeagnus angustifolia were placed for 3 minutes in zones which were trigger zones for the gag reflex. Then the patients’ gag reflex was evaluated again. Data was analyzed with Wilcoxon, Mann-Whitney and chi-squared tests (α= 0. 05). Results: In group A (placebo), frequency of distribution of gag reflex in the soft palate, tonsils and tongue were not significantly different before and after drug use. However, in <b>group</b> <b>B,</b> <b>frequency</b> of distribution of gag reflex exhibited significant differences in the tonsils (p value < 0. 001) and soft palate (p value < 0. 003) after drug application. In addition, there were no significant differences in sex distribution between the two groups. Conclusion: The results of the present study showed that a thin film of a medication containing Elaeagnus angustifolia has a positive effect on gag reflex in the tonsil and soft palate areas, and it can be used during dental procedures such as radiography procedures.

40|$|Although {{difficulties}} with neck mobility often interfere with patients’ {{activities of daily}} living (ADL) after cervical laminoplasty, there was no detailed study on the relation between the limitations of ADL accompanying postoperative reduced neck mobility and the cervical posterior approach. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare retrospectively the frequency of limitations of ADL accompanying neck mobility after laminoplasty preserving the semispinalis cervicis inserted into the C 2 spinous process with that after laminoplasty reattaching the muscle to C 2. Forty-nine patients after C 4 –C 7 laminoplasty with C 3 laminectomy preserving the semispinalis cervicis inserted into C 2 (Group A) and 24 patients after C 3 –C 7 laminoplasty reattaching the muscle (<b>Group</b> <b>B)</b> were evaluated. The frequency of postoperative limitations of ADL accompanying each of three neck movements of extension, flexion and rotation were investigated. The postoperative O–C 7 angles at extension and flexion was measured on lateral extension and flexion radiographs of the cervical spine, respectively. The postoperative cervical range of motion in rotation was measured in the cranial view using a digital camera. Frequency of limitations of ADL accompanying extension was lower (P =  0. 037) in Group A (2 %) than in <b>Group</b> <b>B</b> (17 %). <b>Frequency</b> of limitations of ADL accompanying flexion was similar in Group A (8 %) and <b>Group</b> <b>B</b> (4 %). <b>Frequency</b> of limitations of ADL accompanying rotation was lower (P =  0. 031) in Group A (12 %) than in <b>Group</b> <b>B</b> (33 %).

40|$|Purpose: This study aims {{to compare}} a {{simplified}} technique of external dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR), where the posterior flap is excised, {{with the more}} traditional approach of double flap repair. Methods: A prospective, comparative, single surgeon, single centre clinical trial was conducted of eighty-three patients who received external DCR, with either anterior and posterior flap anastomosis (Group A), or anterior flap anastomosis and excision of the posterior flap (<b>Group</b> <b>B),</b> in a tertiary referral hospital in Nepal. Patients with nasolacrimal duct obstruction and epiphora were {{assigned to one of}} two groups. Follow up was a minimum of 6 months for inclusion in the study. Success was defined objectively by irrigation of the puncta without regurgitation and subjectively by the absence of epiphora or discharge. Results: The overall success rate of external DCR was 89. 2 %, after a mean follow up of 13. 5 ± 2. 2 months. There was no difference in success between the two groups (p-value = 0. 73), with 90. 7 % success in Group A and 87. 5 % in <b>Group</b> <b>B.</b> The <b>frequency</b> of complications was not statistically different between <b>Groups</b> A and <b>B</b> (p-value = 0. 79).

Aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the most important technical endpoints associated with the use of IIPCS for the delivery of 5 -fluorouracil-based HAI in patients with colorectal liver metastases in a phase 2 -study, and to perform a non-randomised comparison with a historical group of patients in which HAI was administered via SIPCS. Methods 41 patients with isolated liver metastases of colorectal cancer were enrolled into a phase II-study and provided with IIPCS between 2001 and 2004 (group A). The primary objective of the trial was defined as evaluation of device-related complications and port duration. Results were compared with those observed in a pre-defined historical collective of 40 patients treated with HAI via SIPCS at our institution between 1996 and 2000 (<b>group</b> <b>B).</b> Results Baseline characteristics were balanced between both groups, except for higher proportions of previous palliative pre-treatment and elevated serum alkaline phosphatase in patients of group A.

40|$|Introduction. The {{placement}} of fixed orthodontic appliances {{may lead to}} increased plaque accumulation and changes in subgingival microflora. Objective. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the changes in frequency of subgingival microflora that occur after placement and removal of fixed orthodontic appliance using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Methods. This study included 33 orthodontic patients, who were divided into two groups. Subgingival plaque samples were collected from the right upper incisor (U 1) and right upper first molar (U 6). In group A, the samples were taken three times: before placement appliance (T 1), after one month (T 2), and after 3 months (T 3). In <b>group</b> <b>B</b> the samples were also taken three times: before appliance removal (T 1), after one month (T 2), and after three months (T 3). PCR method was used to determine the presence of P. gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans, T. forsythia, and P. intermedia. Results. In group A the frequency of P. gingivalis showed statistically significant decrease at U 1 (p= 0. 049) and U 6 (p= 0. 008), from T 1 to T 2, and at U 1 (p= 0. 048) from T 1 to T 3. In <b>group</b> <b>B</b> only the <b>frequency</b> of T. forsythia showed a statistically significant decrease, at U 6 (T 1 vs. T 2, p= 0. 004; T 1 vs. T 3, p= 0. 0003). Regarding other analyzed bacteria, changes in the presence were noticed but no statistical significance was found. Conclusion. Placement of fixed appliances may have an impact on subgingival microflora, but in the first months after the placement and removal of the appliance changes were not significant, probably due to good oral hygiene.

40|$|Abstract Background Sox domain {{containing}} {{genes are}} important metazoan transcriptional regulators implicated {{in a wide}} rage of developmental processes. The vertebrate B subgroup contains the Sox 1, Sox 2 and Sox 3 genes that have early functions in neural development. Previous studies show that Drosophila <b>Group</b> <b>B</b> genes have been functionally conserved since they play essential roles in early neural specification and mutations in the Drosophila Dichaete and SoxN genes can be rescued with mammalian Sox genes. Despite their importance, the extent and organisation of the <b>Group</b> <b>B</b> family in Drosophila has not been fully characterised, {{an important step in}} using Drosophila to examine conserved aspects of <b>Group</b> <b>B</b> Sox gene function. Results We have used the directed cDNA sequencing along with the output from the publicly-available genome sequencing projects to examine the structure of <b>Group</b> <b>B</b> Sox domain genes in Drosophila melanogaster, Drosophila pseudoobscura, Anopheles gambiae and Apis mellifora. All of the insect genomes contain four genes encoding <b>Group</b> <b>B</b> proteins, two of which are intronless, {{as is the case with}} vertebrate <b>group</b> <b>B</b> genes. As has been previously reported and unusually for <b>Group</b> <b>B</b> genes, two of the insect <b>group</b> <b>B</b> genes, Sox 21 a and Sox 21 b, contain introns within their DNA-binding domains. We find that the highly unusual multi-exon structure of the Sox 21 b gene is common to the insects. In addition, we find that three of the <b>group</b> <b>B</b> Sox genes are organised in a linked cluster in the insect genomes. By in situ hybridisation we show that the pattern of expression of each of the four <b>group</b> <b>B</b> genes during embryogenesis is conserved between D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura. Conclusion The DNA-binding domain sequences and genomic organisation of the <b>group</b> <b>B</b> genes have been conserved over 300 My of evolution since the last common ancestor of the Hymenoptera and the Diptera. Our analysis suggests insects have two <b>Group</b> <b>B</b> 1 genes, SoxN and Dichaete, and two <b>Group</b> <b>B</b> 2 genes. The genomic organisation of Dichaete and another two <b>Group</b> <b>B</b> genes in a cluster, suggests they may be under concerted regulatory control. Our analysis suggests a simple model for the evolution of <b>group</b> <b>B</b> Sox genes in insects that differs from the proposed evolution of vertebrate <b>Group</b> <b>B</b> genes. </p...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{sought to}} compare the {{efficacy}} of Celsior and University of Wisconsin (UW) solutions on the perfusion and cold storage of renal grafts for human transplantation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective analyses of 313 kidney transplants were performed between 2002 and 2005; group A (n = 160), UW solution and <b>group</b> <b>B</b> (n = 153), Celsior solution {{were used in the}} preservation of the organs. The mean donor age was lower in <b>group</b> <b>B</b> (<b>group</b> A = 42. 67 years vs <b>group</b> <b>B</b> = 38. 96 years; P <. 05), living donors were more frequent in the UW group (group A = 10 % vs <b>group</b> <b>B</b> = 0. 9 %; P <. 001). Multiorgan procurement procedures were more common in the Celsior group (group A = 75 % vs <b>group</b> <b>B</b> = 81. 7 %; P <. 001). Recipients with no associated comorbidities were more frequent in the UW group (group A = 50 % vs <b>group</b> <b>B</b> = 36 %; P <. 001). Recipient mean age, cold ischemia time, and HLA matches were comparable. RESULTS: Delayed graft function (group A = 22. 7 % vs <b>group</b> <b>B</b> = 20. 6 %), acute rejections (group A = 21. 4 % vs <b>group</b> <b>B</b> = 18. 4 %), and serum creatinine at 6 months (group A = 1. 75 vs <b>group</b> <b>B</b> = 1. 67 mg/dL), 1 year (group A = 1. 47 vs <b>group</b> <b>B</b> = 1. 74 mg/dL), and 2 years (group A = 1. 43 vs <b>group</b> <b>B</b> = 1. 58 mg/dL) showed no differences (P = NS).
