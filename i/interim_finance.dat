500|$|Days {{prior to}} this announcement, state Emergency Management Director Frank Siracusa noted that [...] "there is no {{precedent}} where government will go after people for costs just because they have {{money to pay for}} it. You get lost, and we look for you. It is a service your taxpayer dollars pay for", although he conceded that legally any decision would rest with Gibbons. At an April 10, 2008 Legislature's <b>Interim</b> <b>Finance</b> Committee hearing, Siracusa indicated that he had hired an independent auditor to review costs incurred by the state in searching for Fossett, but added, [...] "We are doing an audit but not because we are critical of anybody or suspect something was done wrong". Chairman Morse Arberry queried Siracusa as to why, since they lacked funds, had the state not billed the Fossett family for its search costs, to which Siracusa did not directly respond. In his later interview with the Las Vegas Review-Journal, he stated that his comments to the Committee may have given the false impression that he had hired an auditor for the purpose of later challenging the state's financial burden incurred on its behalf by the National Guard during the search operation. Upon interview regarding reports that the state would seek payment, Arberry was recorded as stating that he was glad to hear steps were being taken to try to recoup some of the costs.|$|E
2500|$|By March 2011, the MTA—citing Nassau's {{refusal to}} pay its {{contracted}} amount—proposed a set of major service reductions which would have eliminated {{over half of the}} routes, with the greatest impact on southeastern Nassau County, eliminating all routes operating south of Hempstead Turnpike and east of the Meadowbrook State Parkway (except for the N71). After reviewing the service cut plans, County Executive Ed Mangano considered severing ties with the MTA and privatizing the Long Island Bus system. [...] A temporary reprieve, via additional state funding, would have sustained service through the end of 2011. However, on April 27, 2011, the MTA voted to cease all bus service in Nassau County after the end of 2011. Mangano then announced that he had retained Veolia Transport to operate the system beginning in 2012 through a public-private partnership pending legislative approval. On November 10, 2011, Veolia and Mangano announced that the service was going to be renamed Nassau Inter-County Express (or NICE), upon Veolia's takeover of the system. [...] All buses, including Able-Ride vehicles, would be painted into a new paint scheme to reflect the change. On December 12, 2011, the legislature unanimously approved the Veolia contract, which was subsequently approved by the state-controlled Nassau County <b>Interim</b> <b>Finance</b> Authority (NIFA) on December 22, 2011. Veolia began operations January 1, 2012. [...] This Veolia plan was the subject of heated county public hearings in which Long Island Bus riders and employees criticized the plan.|$|E

40|$|The European Commission {{published}} a draft Directive in November 2016, {{with the aim}} of ensuring that all Member States have in place an effective mechanism for dealing with viable, but financially distressed, businesses. The draft Directive includes provisions designed to encourage financing for the debtor company, both <b>interim</b> <b>financing</b> to “keep the lights on” for a brief period while the debtor negotiates with its creditors for a resolution to its financial distress, and where possible, to finance implementation of a restructuring plan, called “new financing” in the draft Directive. Creating such a financing regime is a complex and difficult issue, as the law’s intervention in this area often involves constraints on the rights of existing creditors, requiring that a careful balance is maintained between existing creditors’ rights and the rights of the interim financier. This paper examines the underlying policy rationale and benefits of having new and <b>interim</b> <b>financing</b> available to financially distressed debtor companies, and discusses the risks involved. It examines the EU Commission’s proposals in light of the experience of jurisdictions that have already tackled these issues, notably the United States and Canada, or have developed a market-based solution to this problem, such as the UK. While the European Commission’s wish to include such measures in its restructuring proposals is laudable, the measures as drafted raise concerns, particularly regarding risks associated with priority for the grantors of such finance. The authors suggest that there are four fundamental aspects of such financing on which the Directive could give guidance to Member States, namely, effective notice to pre-filing creditors, thresholds for the debtor to qualify, a menu of relevant criteria to balance benefit and prejudice, and a role for the court in resolving disputes, ensuring fairness to stakeholders, and serving as an accountability check on <b>interim</b> <b>financing</b> arrangements, all aimed at maintaining the integrity of the insolvency process...|$|R

The constraints slow insolvency resolution, increase <b>interim</b> <b>financing</b> costs, and undermine RTC recovery of asset value. Operationalizing its task as preserving evanescent and economically misconceived "franchise values," the RTC allows insolvents to seek financing on an unconsolidated basis, initiates bidding for one institution at a time, holds back seriously troubled assets, and recruits an overly narrow range of bidders.

5000|$|Nassau County <b>Interim</b> <b>Finance</b> Authority (NIFA) is a bipartisan, {{independent}} state financial oversight agency. In 2009, NIFA published a report titled [...] "Review of the May 1, 2009 Nassau County Multi-Year Financial Plan Update and Related Matters". According to NIFA's report, Suozzi had prepared a 2009 budget {{that did not}} address the current budget gap, nor did the Multi-Year Financial Plan address a continuing baseline gap in the Out-Years. The Plan assumed optimistic rates of recovery and growth despite the ongoing crises affecting the nation and high levels of unemployment. The report also claims that Suozzi and the County have underestimated Nassau’s greater exposure to the economic downturn from Wall Street job losses, and have used $23 million in bond proceeds and reserves to pay operating expenses. The report noted the large amount of turnover in the county Office of Management and Budget, which has not helped Nassau's recovery and planning efforts. By deferring debt service payments and not paying off obligations in a timely manner, Suozzi and the County put taxpayers at risk. Suozzi reportedly planned for Nassau County to use $28 Million of bond proceeds to pay for Fiscal Year 2009's tax assessment grievance refunds. The county would receive $80 million {{over the next two years}} in non-recurring federal stimulus monies, which the county would use to subsidize the operating budget.|$|E
