5|$|Ultimately, {{it seemed}} {{unlikely}} that any media company, particularly the major studios and television network making Inferno and 12 Monkeys, would risk the negative publicity that would come from using the <b>images</b> <b>in</b> the spectrograms and a suggested threat against a U.S. president.|$|E

5|$|A Trip to the Moon {{was named}} one of the 100 {{greatest}} films of the 20th century by The Village Voice, ranked 84th. The film remains the best-known of the hundreds of films made by Méliès, and the moment in which the capsule lands in the Moon's eye {{remains one of the most}} iconic and frequently referenced <b>images</b> <b>in</b> the history of cinema. It is widely regarded as the earliest example of the science fiction film genre and, more generally, as one of the most influential films in cinema history.|$|E
5|$|A {{photo of}} a dazed Tittle {{in the end zone}} taken by Morris Berman of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on September 20, 1964, is {{regarded}} among the most iconic <b>images</b> <b>in</b> the history of American sports and journalism. Tittle, in his 17th and final season, was photographed helmet-less, bloodied and kneeling immediately after having been knocked to the ground by John Baker of the Pittsburgh Steelers and throwing an interception that was returned for a touchdown at the old Pitt Stadium. He suffered a concussion and cracked sternum on the play, but went on to play the rest of the season.|$|E
5|$|According to the Dalai Lama, {{among the}} many <b>images</b> <b>in</b> the temple was an image of Chenrizi, made of clay in the temple, within which the small wooden statue of the Buddha brought from Nepal was hidden. The image was in the temple for 1300 years, and when Songtsen Gampo died his soul was {{believed}} to have entered the small wooden statue. During the Cultural Revolution, the clay image was smashed and the smaller Buddha was given by a Tibetan to the Dalai Lama.|$|E
3000|$|We recall some {{concepts}} from probabilistic metric space [6, 7] and convergence concept. For more details, {{we refer}} {{the reader to}} Chung’s study [8]. A distance distribution function is a mapping [...] Open <b>image</b> <b>in</b> new window [...] which is nondecreasing, left continuous on (0,∞) and [...] Open <b>image</b> <b>in</b> new window [...]. The class of all distribution functions is denoted by [...] Open <b>image</b> <b>in</b> new window [...]. [...] Open <b>image</b> <b>in</b> new window [...] is the subset of [...] Open <b>image</b> <b>in</b> new window [...] containing all functions F which satisfy the condition [...] Open <b>image</b> <b>in</b> new window [...]. If S is a nonempty set, a mapping F from [...] Open <b>image</b> <b>in</b> new window [...] to [...] Open <b>image</b> <b>in</b> new window [...] is called a probabilistic distance on S, and [...] Open <b>image</b> <b>in</b> new window [...] is denoted by [...] Open <b>image</b> <b>in</b> new window [...].

5|$|Algorithmic {{analysis}} {{of images of}} artworks, for example using X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, can reveal information about art. Such techniques can uncover <b>images</b> <b>in</b> layers of paint later covered over by an artist; help art historians to visualize an artwork before it cracked or faded; help to tell a copy from an original, or distinguish the brushstroke style of a master from those of his apprentices.|$|E
5|$|All {{the figures}} are adorned with carved {{ornaments}} and surrounded by borders with reliefs of animals and birds. The lotus design is a common theme. On the ceiling are images of the Vidyadhara couples as well as couples in courtship and erotic Mithuna scenes. Through a cleft in {{the back wall of}} the cave is a square sanctuary with more carved <b>images.</b> <b>In</b> the mandapa is a seated Nandi facing the garbha ghriya (sacrum sanctum) containing a Shiva linga.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the films}} were not popular with critics, Friday the 13th is {{considered}} one of the most successful media franchises in America—not only for the success of the films, but also because of the extensive merchandising and repeated references to the series in popular culture. The franchise's popularity has generated a fanbase who have created their own Friday the 13th films, fashioned replica Jason Voorhees costumes, and tattooed their bodies with Friday the 13th artwork. Jason's hockey mask has become one of the most recognizable <b>images</b> <b>in</b> horror and popular culture.|$|E

5|$|By {{examining}} unique striations, or markings, {{left behind}} on the bullet as it passes through the barrel and on the cartridge as it is hit by the firing pin, individual spent rounds can be linked back to a specific weapon. Known exemplars taken from a seized weapon can be directly compared to samples recovered from the scene using a comparison microscope. Striation images can also be uploaded to any existing national databases. Furthermore, these markings {{can be compared to}} other <b>images</b> <b>in</b> an attempt to link one weapon to multiple crime scenes. Like all forensic specialties, forensic firearm examiners are subject to being called to testify in court as expert witnesses.|$|E
5|$|Chhinnamasta's shrines {{are also}} found in Nepal's Kathmandu Valley. A shrine in the Changu Narayan Temple holds a 13th-century icon of Chinnamasta. A chariot festival in the Nepali month of Baishakh is held in honour of the goddess. In the fields near the temple sits a small shrine to Chhinnamasta. A temple of the goddess in Patan built in 1732 {{contains}} her <b>images</b> <b>in</b> different postures and enjoys active worship.|$|E
5|$|Howard and {{her husband}} were part of a circle of artists, writers and {{designers}} who were interested in visual <b>images,</b> <b>in</b> language and in the book arts. One close associate was the graphic designer Allan Fleming, whose Martlet Press published Twenty-Eight Drawings by Barbara Howard in 1970, a period when she was drawing the figure. The Canadian wood engraver Rosemary Kilbourn, a close friend since art college, taught Howard to carve images that could be printed in conjunction with text.|$|E

5|$|In 1956, Norwegian adventurer and ethnographer Thor Heyerdahl later {{claimed the}} reliefs on Tiki Makiʻi Tauʻa Pepe were llamas or pumas instead {{to bolster his}} theory that Polynesia was settled from South America. Later {{unidentified}} writers and rumors have insinuated that Heyerdahl deliberately altered and defaced the <b>images</b> <b>in</b> his process of restoring them.|$|E
5|$|In {{his final}} season, Tittle was photographed bloodied and {{kneeling}} {{down in the}} end zone after a tackle by a defender left him helmetless. The photograph {{is considered one of the}} most iconic <b>images</b> <b>in</b> North American sports history. He retired as the NFL's all-time leader in passing yards, passing touchdowns, attempts, completions, and games played. Tittle was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1971, and his jersey number 14 is retired by the Giants.|$|E

5|$|Not {{only did}} Sorabji, {{who had not}} written any music since 1968, return to {{composition}} {{as a result of}} Hinton's interest in his work, but on 24 March 1976 he gave the pianist Yonty Solomon permission to play his works in public (although it has been claimed that Michael Habermann received tentative approval at an earlier date). Several recitals ensued and led to the making of a television documentary on Sorabji, which was broadcast in 1977. The <b>images</b> <b>in</b> it consisted mostly of still photographs of his house; there was just one brief shot of Sorabji waving to the departing camera crew.|$|E

5|$|Thakkar joined Pacific Data <b>Images</b> <b>in</b> 1996. Pacific Data Images was {{acquired}} by DreamWorks in 2000, enabling Thakkar {{to work with the}} film production company. While at DreamWorks, Thakkar worked with his mentor Richard Chuang (the co-founder of Pacific Data Images) on designing the DreamWorks Animation Media Review System, which subsequently led Thakkar to jointly win the Academy Award in 2016.
