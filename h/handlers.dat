5|$|Bears {{in captivity}} have for centuries {{been used for}} entertainment. They {{have been trained to}} dance, and were kept for baiting in Europe at least since the 16th century. There were five bear-baiting gardens in Southwark, London at that time; archaeological remains of three of these have survived. Across Europe, nomadic Romani bear <b>handlers</b> called Ursari lived by busking with their bears from the 12th century.|$|E
5|$|Fighting {{has been}} a part of ice hockey since the sport's rise in {{popularity}} in 19th century Canada. There are a number of theories behind the integration of fighting into the game; the most common is that the relative lack of rules in the early history of hockey encouraged physical intimidation and control. Other theories include the poverty and high crime rates of local Canada in the 19th century. The implementation of some features, such as the blue lines in 1918, actually encouraged fighting due to the increased level of physical play. Creation of the blue lines allowed forward passing, but only in the neutral zone. Therefore, puck <b>handlers</b> played at close quarters and were subject to a great deal of physical play. The emergence of enforcers, who protected the puck <b>handlers</b> and fought when necessary, followed shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Individuals of the Asian {{species have}} been often trained as working animals. In the forests of Myanmar, for example, {{elephants}} have {{played a critical role}} in sustainable logging.

From there, the valuable logs are shipped to commercial mills.|$|E

5|$|During the war, the Army also trained {{animals for}} use in the trenches. Dogs carried messages; horses, mules and dogs were used to lay {{telephone}} and telegraph cables. Carrier pigeons, who transported messages back from the front line, were also carried in tanks so that they could deliver messages during an attack. Over 20,000 pigeons and 370 <b>handlers</b> were used during the war, and at times, they were the sole means of communication.|$|E

5|$|Operationally, {{the design}} of the cargo holds led to {{considerable}} difficulty for the ground crew, especially baggage <b>handlers</b> at the airports. The cargo hold had its doors located directly underneath the aircraft, so each item of baggage or cargo had to be loaded vertically upwards {{from the top of the}} baggage truck, then slid along the hold floor to be stacked inside. The individual pieces of luggage and cargo also had to be retrieved in a similarly slow manner at the arriving airport.|$|E
5|$|Ponies often exhibit thicker manes, tails, {{and overall}} coat.

For example, the Shetland pony which averages , is considered a pony. Conversely, breeds such as the Falabella and other miniature horses, which can be no taller than , are classified by their registries as very small horses, not ponies.|$|E

5|$|S.iniae has {{occasionally}} produced {{infection in}} humans, especially fish <b>handlers</b> of Asian descent. Human infections include sepsis, toxic shock syndrome, and {{inflammation of the}} skin, intervertebral discs, or inner layer of the heart. Identifying S.iniae in the laboratory can be difficult, since the conventional methods used to identify streptococci yield insufficient results. It cannot be grouped by the Lancefield antigen method typically used to categorize Streptococcus species. The two known serotypes can be distinguished biochemically by differences in enzyme activity. Several antibiotics {{have been used to}} treat S.iniae infections.|$|E

Rally obedience offers more interaction with the owner and less repetition than traditional obedience trials.|$|E
50|$|Dog agility is a dog {{sport in}} which a <b>handler</b> directs a dog through an {{obstacle}} course in a race for both time and accuracy.

[...] As such, future narrating duties were handed back to Curry, of whom <b>Handler</b> states: [...] "he does a splendid job".
