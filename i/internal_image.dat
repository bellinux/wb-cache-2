Plotz and Oldstone presented evidence that autoimmunity can arise {{as a result of}} a cross-reaction between the idiotype on an antiviral antibody and a host cell receptor for the virus in question. In this case, the host-cell receptor is envisioned as an <b>internal</b> <b>image</b> of the virus, and the anti-idiotype antibodies can react with the host cells.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Visual {{summarization}} of {{web pages}} helps {{to achieve a}} friendlier user experience in search and refinding tasks. With {{the use of this}} method users quickly get an idea of what the web page is all about and help in recalling the visited web page. The <b>internal</b> <b>images</b> of web page are usually used to describe the content of a webpage. <b>Internal</b> <b>images</b> in web pages are generally worthy for this purpose. Nevertheless, in many web pages dominant <b>internal</b> <b>images</b> are unavailable. So, we move towards a new approach i. e. external image summarization to summarize web pages without any dominant <b>internal</b> <b>images.</b> But, external images are sometimes unreliable {{because of the way they}} are retrieved from internet. By taking advantage of <b>internal</b> and external <b>images</b> we propose a scheme for visual summarization. To improve the reliability of external images, relevant external images are retrieved from the Internet by considering textual and visual importance between target webpage and hosting webpage. Relevance, Dominance and typicality of the image with respect to web page are the features of images. We propose an Affinity Propagation Clustering based algorithm to select the best of <b>internal</b> and external <b>images</b> as summarization.

50|$|Submodalities are {{the fine}} details of {{representational}} systems. In the late 1970s the developers of NLP started playing {{around with the}} submodalities of representational systems involving the enhancement of visualisation techniques (common in sports psychology and meditation), by including other sensory systems. Submodalities involve the relative size, location, brightness of <b>internal</b> <b>images,</b> the volume and direction of internal voices and sounds, and the location, texture, and movement of internally created sensations. Submodalities and hypnosis {{became the focus of}} Richard Bandler's later work. A typical change process may involve manipulating the submodalities of internal representations. For example, someone may see their future as 'dark and cloudy' with associated emotions, but would seek through NLP to perceive, and feel it, as 'light and clear'. Other training exercises develop a person's ability to move around <b>internal</b> <b>images,</b> change the quality of sounds and find out how these effect the intensity of internal feelings or other submodalities. Although NLP did not discover submodalities, it appears that the proponents of NLP may have been the first to systematically use manipulation of submodalities for therapeutic or personal development purposes, particularly phobias, compulsions and addictions.|$|R

50|$|Compared to {{reactive}} agents, {{which are}} able to reach their goal only by reacting reflexively on external stimuli, a deliberative agent's internal processes are more complex. The difference lies in fact, that deliberative agent maintains a symbolic representation of the world it inhabits. In other words, it possesses <b>internal</b> <b>image</b> of the external environment and is thus capable to plan its actions. Most commonly used architecture for implementing such behavior is Belief-Desire-Intention software model (BDI), where an agent's beliefs about the world (its image of a world), desires (goal) and intentions are internally represented and practical reasoning is applied to decide, which action to select.|$|E

50|$|The camera can be {{attached}} {{directly to the}} kite but is usually secured to an adjustable rig suspended from the kite line {{at a distance from}} the kite. This distance reduces excessive movement being transmitted from the kite to the camera and allows the kite to be flown into higher, stable air before the camera is attached. If possible, the camera is set to a high shutter speed to reduce motion blur. Cameras using <b>internal</b> <b>image</b> stabilization features can increase the number of sharp photos. In order to take photographs that are oriented correctly with the horizon, a suspension method is used to allow the rig to automatically level itself under the kite line.|$|E
