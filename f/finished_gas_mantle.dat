2500|$|Identified by the EPA in 1980, the Welsbach/General Gas Mantle site {{contained}} {{soil and}} building materials contaminated with radioactive materials. [...] Radiation became prominent when the companies used thorium, a radioactive material withdrawn from monazite ore, {{in the production}} of their <b>gas</b> <b>mantles.</b> [...] In the late 19th century and early 20th century, Welsbach Company was located in Gloucester City, which borders Camden, and was a major producer of <b>gas</b> <b>mantles</b> until <b>gas</b> lights were replaced by electric lights. [...] The fabric of the Welsbach <b>gas</b> <b>mantle</b> was put into a solution that consisted of 99% thorium nitrate and 1% cerium nitrate in distilled water, causing it to emit a white light. [...] Operating from 1915 to 1940 in Camden, General Gas Mantle, or GGM, was a manufacturer of <b>gas</b> <b>mantles</b> and served as a competitor for Welsbach. [...] Unlike Welsbach, General Gas Mantle used only a refined, commercial thorium solution in order to produce its <b>gas</b> <b>mantles.</b> Welsbach and General Gas Mantle went out of business in the 1940s and had no successors.|$|R

50|$|An {{incandescent}} <b>gas</b> <b>mantle,</b> <b>gas</b> <b>mantle</b> or Welsbach mantle is {{a device}} for generating bright white light when heated by a flame. The name refers {{to its original}} heat source in gas lights which filled the streets of Europe and North America {{in the late nineteenth}} century, mantle referring to the way it is hung above the flame. Today it is still used in portable camping lanterns, pressure lanterns and some oil lamps.|$|R

50|$|The {{excess of}} {{hydrogen}} in a coal, above the amount necessary to combine with its oxygen to form water, {{is known as}} disposable hydrogen, and {{is a measure of}} the fitness of the coal for use in the manufacture of coal gas. Such coal, although of very small value as fuel, commands a specially high price for gas-making. Cannel coal was used as a major feedstock for the historical manufactured gas industry, as the gas produced from it was valuable for lighting due to the luminosity of the flame it produced. Cannel gas was widely used for domestic lighting throughout the 19th century before the invention of the incandescent <b>gas</b> <b>mantle</b> by Carl Auer von Welsbach in the 1880s. Following the introduction of the <b>gas</b> <b>mantle,</b> cannel coal lost favour as a manufactured gas feedstock as the <b>gas</b> <b>mantle</b> could produce large quantities of light without regard for the flame luminosity of the gas burnt.|$|R
50|$|In June 2001 the NUREG {{published}} a study about the Systematic Radiological Assessment of Exemptions for Source and Byproduct Materials stating that radioactive <b>gas</b> <b>mantles</b> are explicitly legal in the US.|$|R
50|$|In 1922 Oppenheim {{took over}} a company called Erste Rixdorfer Glühkörper-Fabrik Alschweig & Co., which had been founded ten years ago. As well as his own company, it was {{specialized}} in chemical products and <b>gas</b> <b>mantles.</b>|$|R

25|$|Efficient <b>gas</b> <b>mantles</b> and {{electric}} lighting were eroding the illuminating oil market {{beginning in the}} 1880s; however a previously low value byproduct of refining was gasoline, which more than offset the role of kerosene in the early 20th century.|$|R

50|$|In 1903 Oppenheim founded {{his first}} own company called Allgemeine Glühlichtwerke Dr. Alfred Oppenheim & Co. G.m.b.H., {{in which he}} shared the {{management}} with Julius and Rosa Rosenfeld. The company soon had 300 employees and produced about 30,000 <b>gas</b> <b>mantles</b> a day.|$|R
50|$|The {{light is}} {{produced}} either {{directly by the}} flame, generally by using special mixes of illuminating gas to increase brightness, or indirectly with other components such as the <b>gas</b> <b>mantle</b> or the limelight, with the gas primarily functioning as a heat source.|$|R
40|$|This study {{took place}} within the {{framework}} of a general update of the average radiation dose for the Dutch population. It focuses on consumer products in which radionuclides have been intentionally incorporated and on radiation-emitting devices that can be supplied to members of the public without special surveillance. Eleven consumer products were studied in more detail. The radiation from these products determined 90 % of the total collective dose due to consumer products in the Netherlands in 1988. Individual and collective doses are presented here for each product. The total collective dose has decreased from 130 personSv in 1988 to 4. 6 personSv at present. This reduction was attributed to: a {{decrease in the number of}} radioactive products (<b>gas</b> <b>mantles),</b> lower estimates of the number of radioactive products present in the Netherlands thanks to new information (camera lenses, smoke detectors containing Ra- 226), replacement of radioactive by non-radioactive products (<b>gas</b> <b>mantles,</b> dental protheses), and a lower estimate of the dose rate for certain products (smoke detectors, VDT). Some products were shown to be unavailable on the Dutch consumer market because importing and selling them was prohibited (antistatic brushes) or because the products were only available for professional users (TIG welding electrodes). Only a few products showed a significant change in radionuclide content. In summary, 60 - 70 % of the reduction is due to a realistic decrease in the number of radioactive products. The remaining 30 - 40 % is due to a better estimation of the number of products and the dose rate. The largest reduction of the total collective dose was realised through the decrease in the number of radioactive <b>gas</b> <b>mantles.</b> The contribution of <b>gas</b> <b>mantles</b> to the collective dose has decreased from 70 personSv in 1988 to 2 personSv per year at present. The total number of <b>gas</b> <b>mantles</b> has decreased by a factor of three of which still 1 / 10 th is radioactive. A further reduction in the contribution of consumer products is to be expected as a number of radioactive products will be placed on a list of non-justified applications as a result of the new Dutch Radiation Protection Act...|$|R
50|$|In 1913 an {{incandescent}} <b>gas</b> <b>mantle</b> {{operated by}} vaporised kerosene was installed, raising {{the power to}} 64,000 cd. In 1920 a fixed automatic acetylene gas lamp (carbide lamp) with a sun valve was installed. As a result, the lighthouse was demanned and all other buildings were demolished.|$|R

5|$|Thorium was {{formerly}} {{used as an}} alloying element in TIG welding electrodes, as a material in high-end optics and scientific instrumentation, and as the light source in <b>gas</b> <b>mantles,</b> but these have become marginal uses. It has been suggested {{as a replacement for}} uranium as nuclear fuel in nuclear reactors, and several thorium reactors have been completed.|$|R
5|$|While {{actinides}} {{have some}} established daily-life applications, {{such as in}} smoke detectors (americium) and <b>gas</b> <b>mantles</b> (thorium), they are mostly used in nuclear weapons and use as a fuel in nuclear reactors. The last two areas exploit the property of actinides to release enormous energy in nuclear reactions, which under certain conditions may become self-sustaining chain reaction.|$|R
50|$|The {{interconvertibility}} of CeOx {{materials is}} the basis of the use of ceria for an oxidation catalyst. One small but illustrative use is its use in the walls of self-cleaning ovens as a hydrocarbon oxidation catalyst during the high-temperature cleaning process. Another small scale but famous example is its role in oxidation of natural <b>gas</b> in <b>gas</b> <b>mantles.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The current {{revetment}} of {{the land}} is in need of repair which may cost up to $5.7 million. [...] In addition, soil tests performed at the location of DuSable Park in December 2000 showed contamination of radioactive thorium. From 1904 through 1936, the Lindsay Light Company processed ores which contained thorium to manufacture thorium impregnated <b>gas</b> <b>mantles.</b>|$|R
50|$|Gas {{lighting}} was economical {{enough to}} light streets {{in major cities}} starting in the early 1800s, and was also used in some commercial buildings and {{in the homes of}} wealthy people. The <b>gas</b> <b>mantle</b> boosted the luminosity of utility lighting and of kerosene lamps. The next major drop in price came about with the incandescent light bulb powered by electricity.|$|R
50|$|In 1891 the <b>gas</b> <b>mantle</b> {{was invented}} by the Austrian chemist Carl Auer von Welsbach. This {{eliminated}} the need for special illuminating gas - a synthetic mixture of hydrogen and hydrocarbon gases produced by destructive distillation of bituminous coal or peat, to get bright shining flames. Acetylene was also used from about 1898 for gas lighting on a smaller scale.|$|R
50|$|In {{many cases}} {{members of the}} decay chain are far more {{radioactive}} than the original nuclide. Thus, although uranium is not dangerously radioactive when pure, some pieces of naturally occurring pitchblende are quite dangerous owing to their radium content. Similarly, thorium <b>gas</b> <b>mantles</b> are very slightly radioactive when new, but become far more radioactive {{after only a few}} months of storage.|$|R
50|$|Mixed oxide {{minerals}} {{are plentiful}} in nature. Synthetic mixed oxides are components of many ceramics with remarkable properties and important advanced technological applications, such as strong magnets, fine optics, lasers, semiconductors, piezoelectrics, superconductors, catalysts, refractories, <b>gas</b> <b>mantles,</b> nuclear fuels, and more. Piezoelectric mixed oxides, in particular, are extensively used in pressure and strain gauges, microphones, ultrasound transducers, micromanipulators, delay lines, etc..|$|R
5|$|Exposure {{is raised}} {{for people who}} live near thorium deposits, {{radioactive}} waste disposal sites, those who live near or work in uranium, phosphate, or tin processing factories, {{and for those who}} work in <b>gas</b> <b>mantle</b> production. Thorium is especially common in the Tamil Nadu coastal areas of India, where residents may be exposed to a naturally occurring radiation dose ten times higher than the worldwide average.|$|R
