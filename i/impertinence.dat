5|$|To attract {{support from}} Kenya's Indian community, he {{made contact with}} Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of the newly {{independent}} Indian republic. Nehru's response was supportive, {{sending a message to}} Kenya's Indian minority reminding them that they were the guests of the indigenous African population. Relations with the white minority nevertheless remained strained; for most white Kenyans, Kenyatta was their principal enemy, an agitator with links to the Soviet Union and who had the <b>impertinence</b> to marry a white woman. They too increasingly called for further Kenyan autonomy from the British government, but wanted continued white-minority rule and closer links to the white-minority governments of South Africa, Northern Rhodesia, and Southern Rhodesia; they viewed the newly elected Labour Party government of Britain with great suspicion. The white Electors' Union had put forward a 'Kenya Plan' which proposed greater white settlement in Kenya, bringing Tanganyika into the British Empire, and incorporating it within their new British East African Dominion. In April 1950, Kenyatta was present at a joint meeting of KAU and the East African Indian National Congress in which they both expressed opposition to the Kenya Plan.|$|E

500|$|Ford {{was also}} a notorious {{alcoholic}} whose excesses contributed to his death six years after Johnson's visit. This event deeply affected Johnson, and he remembered Ford in his Life of Fenton, saying that Ford's abilities, [...] "instead of furnishing convivial merriments to the voluptuous and dissolute, might have enabled him to excel among the virtuous and the wise". Having spent six months with his cousins, Johnson returned to Lichfield, but Hunter, [...] "angered by the <b>impertinence</b> of this long absence", refused {{to allow him to}} continue at the grammar school.|$|E

500|$|By {{the end of}} 1974, Harper {{had formed}} the United Conservative Party, which called for {{separate}} black and white legislatures. He subsequently reacted with revulsion each time Smith moved towards settlement with black nationalist factions. In December that year he described Smith's announcement of a ceasefire {{in the run-up to}} the Victoria Falls Conference as a [...] "ghastly capitulation". In 1976, when Smith announced his acceptance of unconditional majority rule by 1978, Harper accused the Prime Minister of [...] "selling us out". [...] "The mind boggles at the enormous <b>impertinence</b> and audacity of this man Smith," [...] he said.|$|E
500|$|Christ and {{the disciples}} {{are placed in}} a semicircle, {{reflecting}} {{the shape of the}} chapel's apse. The tax collector, on the other hand, stands outside the holy space. While the group of holy men are dressed almost entirely in robes of pastel pink and blue, the official wears a shorter tunic of a striking vermilion. The colour adds to the <b>impertinence</b> expressed through his gestures. Another way contrast is achieved is in the way [...] both in the central scene and on the right [...] the tax collector's postures are copying almost exactly those of Peter, only seen from the opposite angle. This gives a three-dimensional quality to the figures, allowing the spectator to view them from all sides.|$|E
500|$|While English {{newspapers}} suppressed {{mention of}} the Prince's name {{in association with the}} case, Welsh-language, colonial, and American newspapers were less inhibited. The New York Times ridiculed him as a [...] "dullard" [...] and [...] "stupid perverse boy", who would [...] "never be allowed to ascend the British throne". According to one American press report, when departing the Gare du Nord in Paris in May 1890, Albert Victor was cheered by a waiting crowd of English, but hissed and catcalled by some of the French; one journalist present asked him if he would comment [...] "as to the cause of his sudden departure from England". According to the report, [...] "The Prince's sallow face turned scarlet and his eyes seemed to start from their orbits," [...] and he had one of his companions upbraid the fellow for <b>impertinence.</b>|$|E

500|$|At {{the age of}} 16, Johnson {{was given}} the {{opportunity}} to stay with his cousins, the Fords, at Pedmore, Worcestershire. There he became a close friend of Cornelius Ford, who employed his knowledge of the classics to tutor Johnson while he was not attending school. Ford was a successful, well-connected academic, but he was also a notorious alcoholic whose excesses contributed to his death six years later. After spending six months with his cousins, Johnson returned to Lichfield, but Mr. Hunter, the headmaster, [...] "angered by the <b>impertinence</b> of this long absence," [...] refused to allow Samuel to continue at the grammar school. Unable to return to Lichfield Grammar School, Johnson was enrolled into the King Edward VI grammar school at Stourbridge. Because the school was located near Pedmore, Johnson was able {{to spend more time with}} the Fords, and he began to write poems and verse translations. However, he spent only six months at Stourbridge before returning once again to his parents' home in Lichfield.|$|E
500|$|Lambert's girth {{was then}} enormous; six men of normal size could fit {{together}} inside his waistcoat, {{and each of}} his stockings {{was the size of}} a sack. [...] His £50 annuity did not adequately cover his living costs, and his size prevented him from working. He became a virtual recluse. [...] Stories of his bulk had by then begun to spread, and travellers visiting Leicester would use various pretexts to visit his home. One such visitor asked Lambert's servant to allow him entry as he wished to ask Lambert's advice about fighting cocks; Lambert leaned out of the window and told the servant to [...] "tell the gentleman that I am a shy cock". On another occasion, he admitted into his house a Nottingham man who sought his advice about a mare's pedigree; on realising the man was visiting only to look at him, Lambert told him that the horse in question was [...] "by <b>Impertinence</b> out of Curiosity".|$|E

His manner was suave; his hair immaculate; his voice quiet; but he revealed his truest self, after his 161 in the 1926 Oval Test, surely the most truly Sutcliffian innings of his life, when he said: 'Yes, Mr. Warner, I love a dogfight...' ...|$|E
2500|$|But Alfonso de Cartagena was not done. Eager {{to punish}} Henry for his <b>impertinence,</b> the Castilian diplomat {{submitted}} more claims – urging the Pope to restore several Portuguese bishoprics back under Compostela's jurisdiction, to revoke {{the autonomy of}} the Portuguese military orders (and fold them under the Castilian orders), to revoke the Tangier bull in light of Castile's 'right of conquest' over Morocco and even demanding the handover of Ceuta as rightfully Castilian (a point that had never been raised before). [...] While it is probable that Cartagena was only half-serious, and sought merely to rattle Henry, the sudden splurge of Castilian claims nearly sank the Tangier expedition, and even opened alarm at the prospect of a new war between Portugal and Castile.|$|E
2500|$|The United Opposition {{staged a}} riot against the PNL in March 1888. Carp {{was shocked by}} the violent backlash, and, {{although}} he did not sign up to a common platform, joined the peaceful March of Mourning into the Assembly Palace. Carp thus witnessed the unresolved shooting incident, during which an Assembly usher was shot dead. It has been reported that Carp verbally assaulted PNL minister Dimitrie Sturdza, grabbing him by the collar and pointing to the dead body: [...] "You rascal, these are your deeds!" [...] When government briefly arrested two United Opposition agitators, the PNL man Nicolae Fleva and the junior Conservative Nicolae Filipescu, Carp denounced a cover-up attempt: [...] "If <b>impertinence</b> were enough to hide a murder, the government would be clean as snow; if numbers were enough to guarantee impunity, you'd go unpunished." ...|$|E

2500|$|Brummell {{put into}} {{practice}} the principles of harmony of shape and contrast of colours with such a pleasing result that men of superior rank sought his opinion on their dress. [...] The Duke of Bedford once did this touching a coat. Brummell examined his Grace with the cool <b>impertinence</b> which was his Grace’s due. He turned him about, scanned him with scrutinizing, contemptuous eye, and then taking the lapel between his dainty finger and thumb, he exclaimed {{in a tone of}} pitying wonder, “Bedford, do you call this thing a coat?” His personal habits, such as a fastidious attention to cleaning his teeth, shaving, and daily bathing exerted an influence on the ton - the upper echelons of polite society - who began to do likewise. Enthralled, the Prince would spend hours in Brummell's dressing room, witnessing the progress of his friend's lengthy morning toilette.|$|E
2500|$|Dougherty {{remained}} in the Army as a reservist. He assumed command of the 8th Infantry Brigade in 1948. He was promoted to major general in 1952 on taking command of the 2nd Division. In 1954, he became the CMF member of the Military Board, which he held until his retirement from the Army in 1957. Dougherty again clashed with Sir Henry Wells, now Chief of the General Staff. Dougherty felt {{that he should be}} Chairman of the Military Board when Wells was absent, being the next most senior member. Wells denounced [...] "the <b>impertinence</b> of a part-time soldier wanting to be the chairman of a board of regular soldiers!" [...] Dougherty replied, [...] "No we are all the same, we are all soldiers." [...] In 1960, the Minister for the Army, John Cramer, attempted to appoint Dougherty as Chief of the General Staff in succession to Lieutenant General Sir Ragnar Garrett. The proposal got as far as cabinet, where it was defeated.|$|E
2500|$|Patrides wrote {{informative}} introductions and annotations {{as part of}} his {{preparation of}} critical editions of literary works. His edition of the English prose of Milton discussed Milton's literary leadership in the English Reformation and Civil War. In this work, Patrides noted appreciations and misappropriations of Milton by later writers, particularly Romantics, who neglected the Christian discipline of Milton's thought and practice. Patrides prepared two Everyman editions of the collected poems of Donne and Herbert, two leading Metaphysical poets. Both prefaces noted his aim “to avoid the <b>impertinence</b> of mere paraphrases” while providing essential contextual information to aid the contemporary reader. Despite his prodigious knowledge of literature and of religious history, Patrides eschewed elaborate annotations that would distract readers from the text itself. Restrained annotation allowed readers to experience the semantic harmonics of Metaphysical poetry and of Milton, the most allusive writer of the English Renaissance. [...] For additional explanation, [...] readers should consult first the Oxford English Dictionary and second his selected bibliography. Patrides's editing and his commentaries were called reverential by Frye. [...] In the judgment of Summers and Pebworth, “Patrides's Olympian style remains distinctive, characterized not only by its mannered elegance of phrasing, but preeminently by a kind of sophisticated wit that incorporates playfulness and amusement even in the most serious of observations and that prevents even the most magisterial pronouncements from ever sounding pompous or self-important.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a {{concurrence}} that {{argued that}} students in public schools {{do not have a}} right to free speech and that Tinker should be overturned. Thomas wrote, [...] "In my view, the history of public education suggests that the First Amendment, as originally understood, does not protect student speech in public schools." [...] He praised Hugo Black's dissenting opinion on Tinker and called it [...] "prophetic". Thomas cited the doctrine of in loco parentis, meaning [...] "in place of the parent", in his opinion. He traced the history of public education in America back to its colonial roots. According to Thomas, because originally public schools were intended to substitute for private tutors, public schools could discipline students as they liked and had a far stronger hand in what happened in the classroom. [...] "In short", he continues, [...] "in the earliest public schools, teachers taught, and students listened. Teachers commanded, and students obeyed." [...] He opined that because parents entrusted the care of their children to teachers, teachers have a right to act in the place of parents during school hours. Therefore, teachers should be able to discipline students if necessary. Thomas lambasted Tinker for [...] "usurping [...] traditional authority for the judiciary". Thomas believed that Frederick was neither speaking gibberish nor openly advocating drug use, but granting such an <b>impertinence</b> constitutional protection [...] "would...be to 'surrender control of the American public school system to public school students.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Initial {{criticism}} of Amos Barton was mixed, with Blackwood's close friend W. G. Hamley [...] "dead against Amos" [...] and Thackeray diplomatically noncomittal. However, the complete Scenes of Clerical Life {{was met with}} 'just and discerning applause', and considerable speculation as to the identity of its author. Sales were no better than satisfactory, following a first printing of 1,500 copies, but Blackwood was none the less confident of Eliot's talent. Early reviewers deemed the writer [...] "religious, without cant or intolerance" [...] and [...] "strong in his [...] knowledge of the human heart". It was praised for its realism: one contemporary review noted approvingly that [...] "the fictitious element is securely based upon a broad groundwork of actual truth, truth as well in detail as in general". Due to its subject matter, it was widely assumed to {{be the work of}} a real-life country parson; one such even attempted to take the credit. Popular opinion in Eliot's home town attributed the work to a Mr Joseph Liggins, who attempted ineffectually to deny the rumours, and eventually accepted the undeserved celebrity. George Eliot's [...] "identity" [...] was revealed in a letter to The Times, but this claim was immediately refuted in a letter from Eliot herself. In 1858 Charles Dickens wrote to Eliot to express his approval of the book, and {{was among the first to}} suggest that Scenes of Clerical Life might have been written by a woman.I have been so strongly affected by the two first tales in the book you have had the kindness to send me, through Messrs. Blackwood, that I hope you will excuse my writing to you to express my admiration of their extraordinary merit. The exquisite truth and delicacy both of the humour and the pathos of these stories, I have never seen the like of; and they have impressed me in a manner that I should find it very difficult to describe to you. if I had the <b>impertinence</b> to try. In addressing these few words of thankfulness to the creator of the Sad Fortunes of the Rev. Amos Barton, and the sad love-story of Mr. Gilfil, I am (I presume) bound to adopt the name that it pleases that excellent writer to assume. I can suggest no better one: but I should have been strongly disposed, if I had been left to my own devices, to address the said writer as a woman. I have observed what seemed to me such womanly touches in those moving fictions, that the assurance on the title-page is insufficient to satisfy me even now. If they originated with no woman, I believe that no man ever before had the art of making himself mentally so like a woman since the world began.|$|E
