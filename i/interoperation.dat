40|$|The lack of {{semantic}} metadata {{is becoming}} a barrier for the in-depth study and wide adoption of Semantic Web. At the same time, folksonomy draws more and more attention as a promising source of semantic metadata. By avoiding the use of ”apriori” agreements on ontology, which is the main feature for folksonomy, the <b>interoperations</b> among metadata from different users could be likely supported by dynamically constructed emergent semantics. In this paper the authors propose a concept model that supports metadata generation by extending the ideas from folksonomy. A semantic layer is specified in the model that comprises three types of semantics varying from simple to complex to support different kinds of semantic <b>interoperations.</b> An implementation of the model, Lego-Note, the folksonomy system featured by graphic tagging is introduced. The preliminary experiment is performed as a case study, and the qualitative analysis on social consensus discovery is exhibited. ...|$|R

An issue with any of the stated elements can be the contributing cause of miscommunication or ineffective interaction between key players. The analysis of <b>interoperations</b> in the organization layer includes different elements. Analyzing the structure, functional or matrix, for example, of each involved organization and how compatible it is with the organizational structure of other players is one type of analysis in this layer. Evaluating the compatibility of existing Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) as well as Emergency Operating Procedures (EOPs) within each involved organization is another important component in analyzing the effectiveness of <b>interoperations</b> among key players. The development of procedures to guarantee seamless connectivity and information assurance every time key players interact with each other throughout all regular or disaster-response operations of a nuclear incident, for example, is critical (Garwin et al. 2004).|$|R

Management of business workflows is facing many significant challenges, including in particular design, making changes, <b>interoperations,</b> etc. A key step in addressing these challenges is to develop techniques for mapping logical workflow specifications into executable workflow systems. In this paper we introduce a new artifact-centric workflow model called Artifact Conceptual Flow (ArtiFlow) and show that automated translation from ArtiFlow to BPEL is achievable. We also discuss technical issues in the translation. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{this chapter}} we review a {{category}} theoretic approach to ontology engineering. Using ideas from universal algebra, we carefully distinguish presentations of ontologies from the ontologies themselves. This {{leads to a}} precise notion of “view”, and views can be used both to create new ontologies incorporating existing ontologies while recognising their common classes and relations, and to develop interoperating ontologies. Interoperating ontologies are separate but linked ontologies with the property that systems developed under each ontology can interoperate without changing the system and with {{only a small amount}} of front-end <b>interoperations</b> code...|$|R

30|$|We run {{simulations}} of a SoS architectural configuration with 69 constituent systems, i.e., 42 sensors, 9 crowdsourcing systems, and 18 drones. Stimuli generators were automatically generated {{for each type}} of constituent. These stimuli generators were capable of receiving the input data from the database and generating the expected stimuli for the constituents, allowing to simulate constituent systems <b>interoperations</b> into the flood monitoring SoS. Using Stimuli-SoS, we simulated 38 days of flood monitoring in little more than 6 h. Stimuli generators correctly forwarded data to the simulation, which was able to reproduce 29 flood alerts triggered by the SoS during a flooding event. In particular, Stimuli-SoS is almost 65 times more productive than a manual approach to producing data for the same type of simulation.|$|R

40|$|After {{more than}} 20 years, several video coding {{standards}} and technologies have been delivered. Less consideration is taken on their commonalities and <b>interoperations.</b> Specification and reference code of {{case by case}} is time consuming. The MPEG reconfigurable video coding (RVC) framework is a new standard under development by MPEG. It aims to provide a unified high-level specification of current MPEG video coding technologies. In this framework, the decoder is built as a configuration of video coding tools taken from MPEG toolbox library. Up to now, MPEG- 4 simple profile and China audio video coding standard (AVS) decoders have been successfully modeled with RVC framework. In this paper, we examine another video standard, that is, DV/DVCPRO, and model it with RVC-CAL. The flexibility and ease of RVC-CAL is demonstrated {{as well as the}} validation of RVC modeling...|$|R

FLINT is based on a predicative variant of the Girard-Reynolds polymorphic calculus F!, extended with a very rich set of primitive types and functions. FLINT provides a common compiler infrastructure that can be quickly adapted to generate compilers for new general-purpose and domain-specific languages. With its single unified type system, FLINT serves as a great platform for reasoning about crosslanguage <b>interoperations.</b> FLINT [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Business-to-Business (B 2 B) <b>interoperations</b> are an {{important}} part of today's global economy. Business process standards are developed to provide a common understanding of the information shared between trading partners. These standards, however, mainly capture the syntax of the transactions and not their semantics. This paper proposes the use of ontologies as the basis for standards development and presents an ontology for the ebXML Business Process Specification Schema (ebBP) with the aim of empowering the capture and sharing of semantics embedded within B 2 B processes as well as enabling knowledge deduction and reasoning over the shared knowledge. The paper utilises the Ontology-based Standards Development methodology (OntoStanD) as a methodological approach for designing ontological models of standards. This research demonstrates how Semantic Web technologies can be utilised as a basis for standards development and representation in order to improve standards-based interoperability between trading partners...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — A real Grid is {{composed}} of nodes at three levels. At the lowest level are the compute nodes on which jobs are run. Next there are the infrastructure servers which enable grid access to each site. Finally, there are high-level servers (such as resource brokers) that link multiple sites {{together to form a}} Grid. Complex <b>interoperations</b> between nodes make it difficult to adequately test middleware and application software before deployment. A realistic, large-scale testbed is needed that accurately reflects the configuration of the real infrastructure. We present TestGrid, a testbed that replicates all three levels of a national infrastructure. This replica is hosted in a self-contained network which uses the same system and network configurations as on the real infrastructure. We describe the virtualisation techniques used to reduce hardware requirements and to replicate the real network infrastructure. We also describe the benefits this testbed provides for system administrators and software developers. I...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTo {{deal with}} {{challenges}} as globalization and fast-changing environments, enterprises are progressively collaborating {{with others and}} becoming a Networked Enterprise (NE). In this context, Enterprise Interoperability (EI) is a crucial requirement {{that needs to be}} verified by enterprises when starting a relationship to avoid interoperability problems. The concepts of NE and EI are not easy to understand due the variety of interpretations that exist in the literature. Having a clear and shared understanding of the NE and the different <b>interoperations</b> between partners is a necessity to manage the interoperability development. In order to reach such an objective, this research work defines a meta-model for NE based on a systemic approach. Concepts related to EI are taken into account to highlight the importance of this ability (i. e. Interoperability), seen as a requirement, within a system to attain its targeted goals. Finally, a real case study is proposed to validate the defined meta-model...|$|R
