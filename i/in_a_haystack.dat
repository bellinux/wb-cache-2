500|$|As {{the police}} claimed {{that there were}} no {{surviving}} papers in the case, and the senior investigating officers had since died, Chand relied largely upon newspaper cuttings to piece together what had happened. Chand, who acted pro bono for Hodgson, said of his investigation: [...] "The search was the most difficult thing I have encountered in my personal and professional life. It was like finding a needle <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>haystack.</b> I spent months chasing false leads and implacable bureaucracy but I was not prepared to accept this, as instinct told me that the samples would be somewhere. I persevered because I had a gut feeling that something was wrong." [...] Eventually, Chand's probing led to the rediscovery of an archive of evidence on an industrial estate in the Midlands [...] "which they appeared to have forgotten about". Stored here were all of the swabs taken by the pathologist in December 1979. In December 2008 the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) notified Julian Young of the initial results of the DNA analysis, and on 30January 2009 it was confirmed that the semen detected on the vaginal and the anal swabs could not have originated from Hodgson.|$|E

In particular, we propose a “comb-needle ” discovery support model resembling an ancient method: Use a comb {{to help find}} <b>a</b> needle <b>in</b> sand or <b>a</b> <b>haystack.</b> The model combines push and pull for information dissemination and gathering. The push component features data duplication <b>in</b> <b>a</b> linear neighborhood of each node. The pull component features a dynamic formation of an on-demand routing structure resembling a comb. The comb-needle model enables us to investigate {{the cost of a}} spectrum of push and pull combinations for supporting query and discovery in large-scale sensor networks. Our result shows that the optimal routing structure depends on the frequency of query occurrence and the spatial-temporal frequency of related events in the network. The benefit of balancing push and pull for information discovery is demonstrated. Index Terms—Information discovery, query, geographical routing, wireless sensor networks. Ç...|$|R

2500|$|The MythBusters {{typically}} test myths in a two-step process. In early episodes, {{the steps}} {{were described as}} [...] "replicate the circumstances, then duplicate the results" [...] by Savage. This means that first the team attempts to recreate the circumstances that the myth alleges, {{to determine whether the}} alleged result occurs; if that fails, they attempt to expand the circumstances to the point that will cause the described result. Occasionally the team (usually Savage and Hyneman) will hold a friendly competition between themselves to see which of them can devise a more successful solution to recreating the results. This is most common with myths involving building an object that can accomplish a goal (for example, rapidly cooling a beer, or finding a needle <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>haystack).</b>|$|E

Examples of Knight's work frequently appeared in dinosaur books published in the US {{during the first half}} of the twentieth century. Many works released since then also include examples of Knight’s paintings; for example, Stephen Jay Gould used one of Knight’s paintings for the cover of his 1991 book Bully for Brontosaurus and another in his 1996 book Dinosaur <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Haystack.</b> Though many other paleoartists have succeeded Knight (most notably Zdeněk Burian) Knight’s paintings still remain very popular among paleontology enthusiasts. A commemorative edition of Knight’s 1946 book Life Through the Ages [...] was recently published by Indiana University Press, and a 2007 calendar [...] of Knight’s paintings is also currently available. Additionally, fantasy artist William Stout has compiled a series of Charles Knight Sketchbooks, which contain many rare and previously unpublished drawings and studies by Knight.|$|E
2500|$|Soon {{afterwards}} on August 6, 1871, Hardin, {{his cousin}} Gip Clements, and a rancher friend named Charles Couger {{put up for}} {{the night at the}} American House Hotel after an evening of gambling. Clements and Hardin shared one room, with Couger in the adjacent room. All three had been drinking heavily. Sometime during the evening, Hardin was awakened by loud snoring coming from Couger's room. He first shouted several times for the man to [...] "roll over" [...] and then, irritated by the lack of response, drunkenly fired several bullets through the shared wall in an apparent effort to awaken him. Couger was hit in the head by the second bullet as he lay in bed, and was killed instantly. Although Hardin may not have intended to kill Couger, he had violated an ordinance prohibiting firing a gun within the city limits. Half-dressed and still drunk, he and Clements exited through a second-story window onto the roof of the hotel. He saw Hickok arrive with four policemen. [...] "Now, I believed," [...] Hardin wrote, [...] "that if Wild Bill found me in a defenseless condition he would take no explanation, but would kill me to add to his reputation." [...] A newspaper reported, [...] "A man was killed in his bed at a hotel in Abilene, Monday night, by a desperado called Arkansas. The murderer escaped. This was his sixth murder." [...] Hardin leapt from the roof into the street and hid <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>haystack</b> {{for the rest of the}} night. He then stole a horse and rode to the cow camp 35 miles outside town. Hardin claimed he ambushed lawman Tom Carson and two other deputies there. According to Hardin, he did not kill them but forced them to remove all their clothing and walk back to Abilene. Carson denied the incident ever took place. The next day, Hardin left for Texas, never to return to Abilene.|$|E

These test states {{can also be used to}} realize "a classical search for the quantum needle" which is deterministic [...] -it always gives a definite answer after a finite number of steps [...] -and faster by a factor of 3. 41 than the purely classical search. Since the test-state search and Grover's algorithm look for the same quantum needle, the average number of oracle queries of the test-state search is the classical benchmark for Grover's algorithm.
