40|$|Simulations {{and real}} {{decomposition}} experiments with hydrogen peroxide induced by dissolved iron and solar illumination were {{performed in a}} solar pilot plant with compound parabolic collectors designed for photo-Fenton wastewater treatment. The structure of a gray-box linear model aimed at reproducing system dynamics with parameters dependent on operating conditions when operating around prescribed set-points is proposed. This simple model relates the changes in hydrogen peroxide concentration due to changes in hydrogen peroxide injection, dissolved iron, and solar illumination. Based on this model, control of the hydrogen peroxide concentration at set points between 200 – 900 mg/L± 10 mg/L under dynamic conditions (simultaneous decomposition and addition of hydrogen peroxide by a <b>dosage</b> <b>pump),</b> was achieved. Different basic approaches for controller actuation upon {{the frequency of the}} <b>dosage</b> <b>pump</b> were tested, ranging from a simple PI controller to a PI controller plus antiwindup action and feedforward control. From these basic approaches, conclusions can be drawn about the process 2 ̆ 7 s behavior under closed-loop contro...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Supplying {{good quality}} of {{drinking}} water is a challenging task {{during the rainy season}} and floods. During this period water becomes highly polluted with suspended solids which increase the water turbidity. Alum is used to reduce the turbidity of the water. Typically in water treatment plants alum dosage is decided by the Jar test and the desired alum dosage is added manually. This research proposes an automatic alum dosage mixing process. The alum dosage is controlled by an intelligent controller which consists of a dosage predictor, an inverse model of the <b>dosage</b> <b>pump</b> and a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) controller. The optimal alum dosage is predicted by the dosage predictor. The PWM controller controls the flow rate of the alum dosing pump. This proposed method has been implemented in a laboratory based water treatment plant and it ensures the automation in water treatment plant to supply good quality drinking water...|$|E

How {{frequently}} this occurs is dependent on several factors, including drug concentration and <b>dosage,</b> and <b>pump</b> size. The refill frequency can range between one and six months for baclofen pumps.|$|R
40|$|Effective type 1 {{diabetes}} mellitus (T 1 DM) management tools are education, empowerment, insulin, and diet control. Exercise should be of moderate intensity {{so as to avoid}} hypoglycaemia. It is prudent to ensure that the required insulin levels are achieved in all children in order to manage the disorder well. The total daily dose of insulin may be 0. 6 - 1. 0 u/kg body weight, and it may be 2 / 3, 1 / 3 for split mixed insulin, and 50 / 50 for multiple subcutaneous injections. The <b>dosages</b> for the <b>pump</b> also vary from child to child. Basal bolus regimen is important and necessary in all T 1 DM children. It is not necessary to use all types of insulin analogs in all T 1 DM children, and the decision should depend on cost and delivery limiting factors. The advantages of using analogues are that some of these exhibit low hypoglycemic events (especially nocturnal events with basal insulin) and a few offer flexibility of administration to patients (most prandial analogs and some basal analogs) ...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} {{effectiveness and}} safety of intrathecal baclofen administration (ITB) testing with continuous infusion via an external pump before the implantation of an internal one in ambulatory spastic patients with cerebral palsy (CP). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seven CP patients (3 diplegic, 4 quadriplegic - 18. 4 +/- 7. 0 years) with a progressive decrease in walking ability were included. Assessments included: Ashworth's scale, Observational Gait Scale (OGS), and GMFM- 66. RESULTS: During the ITB test (45 - 150 microg/ 24 h), spasticity decreased by more than two points on Ashworth's scale (p< 0. 001) and walking ability improved (median OGS increased from 7 to 9, p<or= 0. 05). After implantation of an internal Synchromed <b>pump</b> (<b>dosage</b> 66 - 160 microg/ 24 h), mean GMFM- 66 increased from 49. 9 +/- 7. 3 to 54. 5 +/- 7. 7 (p< 0. 05) and median OGS from 7 to 10 (p< 0. 05). Two nonambulatory patients recovered some walking ability following implantation of the pump. Adverse effects included one case of chemical meningitis during the test and two temporary CSF leaks. CONCLUSIONS: Tests of ITB using a continuous infusion by an external pump allowed precise evaluation {{of the effects of}} different ITB doses on walking ability, enabling prediction of how the patient would respond to an internal pump. All patients showed ambulatory improvement with ITB...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Eosinophilic {{esophagitis}} is {{a chronic}} immunogenic-antigen mediated {{disease of the}} esophagus, characterized by symptoms related to esophagus dysfunction, histologically defined by over 15 eosinophil counts seen in high-power microscopic field, without gastroesophageal reflux disease. In adults, the most common clinical manifestations are dysphagia, reflux, chest pain, regurgitation and bolus impaction. Case report. We presented {{the case of a}} female patient, hospitalized for a serious form of pancreatitis with complications, which required artificial ventilation and enteral feeding, after the initial esophagoscopy verified reflux esophagitis. Further treatment cured the primary illness, and peroral feeding was reintroduced. However, dysphagia with regurgitation occurred, and endoscopic and radiological tests verified esophagus stenosis, which histopathologically corresponded to erosive esophagitis. Two months of treatment by a double <b>dosage</b> of proton <b>pump</b> inhibitors led to no regression of disorders, and the repeated biopsies from the stenotic segments resulted in over 30 eosinophil counts in the high-power microscopic field, which histologically corresponds to eosinophilic esophagitis. Subsequent therapy included fluticasone 880 μg/day orally for a period of eight weeks, which led to complete regression of disorders, and endoscopic and histopathologic remission. Conclusion. In case of irresponsiveness to the conventional therapy by proton pump inhibitors, repeated esophagoscopy and histopathological analyses of esophagus mucosa biopsy can point to the diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis, and a good therapeutic response to topical corticosteroids can be regarded as the clinical confirmation of the diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|Conventional drug {{delivery}} systems have slight {{control over their}} drug release and almost no control over the effective concentration at the target site. This kind of dosing pattern may result in constantly changing, unpredictable plasma concentrations. Drugs can be delivered in a controlled pattern {{over a long period}} of time by the controlled or modified release {{drug delivery}} systems. They include dosage forms for oral and transdermal administration as well as injectable and implantable systems. For most of drugs, oral route remains as the most acceptable route of administration. Certain molecules may have low oral bioavailability because of solubility or permeability limitations. Development of an extended release dosage form also requires reasonable absorption throughout the gastro-intestinal tract (GIT). Among the available techniques to improve the bioavailability of these drugs fabrication of osmotic drug delivery system is the most appropriate one. Osmotic drug delivery systems release the drug with the zero order kinetics which does not depend on the initial concentration and the physiological factors of GIT. This review brings out new technologies, fabrication and recent clinical research in osmotic drug delivery. Osmotically controlled drug delivery systems use osmotic pressure for controlled delivery of active agent(s). Drug delivery from these systems, to a large extent, is independent of the physiological factors of the gastrointestinal tract. Because of their unique advantages over other types of <b>dosage</b> forms, osmotic <b>pumps</b> form a class of their own among the various drug delivery technologies, and a variety of products based on this technology are available on the market...|$|R

Methods: In this double-blind, randomized, proof-of-concept study, 369 patients with GERD and moderate heartburn lasting &ge;three days/week, a history of response to antacids/acid suppression therapy, and a positive {{esophageal acid perfusion test}} result were randomized to esomeprazole 20 or 40 mg once daily, or to 40 mg twice daily for four weeks. Heartburn symptom relief/resolution was subsequently evaluated. Results: In this study population, no relationship was apparent between esomeprazole dosage and efficacy variables for sustained heartburn resolution (seven days without symptoms) at week 4 (48. 0 %, 44. 0 %, and 41. 4 % for esomeprazole 20 mg once daily, 40 mg once daily, and 40 mg twice daily, respectively). Nocturnal heartburn resolution with esomeprazole 40 mg twice daily showed a numeric improvement trend versus esomeprazole 20 and 40 mg once daily, but this was not statistically significant. Conclusions: Heartburn resolution rates at four weeks were similar for all esomeprazole dosages and comparable with rates reported previously, suggesting a plateau effect in terms of clinical response to acid suppression with PPI therapy in this population of selected GERD patients.

40|$|Dois sistemas de bebedouros utilizados na criação avícola, {{pendular}} e chupeta (nipple), foram estudados objetivando avaliar a qualidade microbiológica da água fornecida às aves, em relação à presença de coliformes totais e fecais, aeróbios mesófilos, bolores e leveduras. Realizaram-se coletas de água no primeiro, 14, 28 e 42 dias de idade, sendo os dias de amostragem divididos em três períodos, de acordo com o horário de limpeza dos bebedouros pendulares: primeira, antes da limpeza; segunda, logo após a limpeza e terceira, ao meio dia. Os bebedouros avaliados apresentaram índices de contaminação em relação ao NMP de coliformes fecais acima dos limites estabelecidos pela Portaria do MS-Brasil. As contagens para UFC de bolores e leveduras obtidas para bebedouros pendulares apresentaram índices de contaminação maiores do que os chupeta. Em uma segunda etapa do estudo, foi avaliado o efeito da cloração constante sobre a qualidade microbiológica da água, usando os mesmos parâmetros anteriores. Foram instaladas bombas dosadoras de cloro em cada galpão reguladas para manter concentração de 2 mg/L de cloro residual livre. A cloração contínua da água melhorou a qualidade microbiológica em relação ao NMP de coliformes totais e fecais nos bebedouros avaliados. Quanto aos aeróbios mesófilos, os bebedouros apresentaram-se fora dos padrões estabelecidos pela Portaria MS-Brasil, sendo o chupeta o que apresentou melhor desempenho. O bebedouro chupeta apresentou índices de contaminação da água inferiores aos apresentados pelos pendulares. Mesmo assim, foram considerados fora dos padrões para água potável. Two drinker systems used {{by commercial}} broiler growers, the bell drinker type and the nipple drinker, were studied aiming {{to evaluate the}} microbiological quality of the water supplied to the birds in relation to occurrence of total and fecal coliforms, mesophilic aerobic, moulds and yeast. The water samplings were taken on the 1 st, 14 th, 28 th and 42 th days of age. The days of sampling, {{in accordance with the}} cleaning schedule for the bell type drinkers, were divided into three periods: before the cleaning, right after cleaning and at noon. The evaluated drinkers presented patterns of contamination in relation to the most probable number (mpn/ 100 ml) of fecal coliforms above that of the limit number established by the Ministry of Health, Brazil. The counts for mould and yeast (cfu/mL) obtained from bell type drinkers showed a higher pattern of contamination when compared to the nipple drinker. In a second stage of the study, the effect of constant flow chlorination was evaluated on the microbiological quality of the water, using the same standard parameters as previous described. <b>Dosage</b> measurement <b>pumps</b> of chlorine were installed in each poultry house and managed to keep a concentration of 2 mg/l of free residual chlorine. Continuous flow water chlorination improved the microbiological quality in relation to the MPN of total and faecal coliforms in the evaluated drinkers. In relation to the mesophilic aerobic, the evaluated drinkers showed {{to be out of the}} standards established by the MH-Bresil, while the nipple type was the drinker that presented the best performance. The nipple drinker showed lower patterns of water contamination in relation to that presented in the bell type drinkers. Even thought, the water contamination were out of the established standard for drinking water...|$|R
