40|$|Interactions between {{water and}} flavour {{molecules}} {{have been widely}} studied and are characterized by the hydrophobicity and volatility. The influence {{of different types of}} sugar should be known in case of they are part from the material. Flavour release from complex food matrices is difficult to predict and solubility data would be helpful. Thus, interactions between flavour molecules and other compounds are often investigated in binary and ternary model systems (e. g., water, flavour compounds, carbohydrates) to characterize specific release mechanisms. In this paper, the solubility of butyl acetate from pure water and various low-viscosity aqueous solutions (D-Sucrose, D-Glucose, D-Fructose), at 10 - 30 gL- 1, was investigated. Static isothermal method was used and concentrations of the aroma or <b>flavour</b> <b>compound</b> at thermodynamic equilibrium were monitored by analyzing liquid samples using gaseous chromatography.

Model food systems and real food products investigated included oil/water emulsions, oil/casein models, oil/pectin models, skim milk and whole milk. A small amount of oil (50 g l- 1) had {{a major influence on}} the amount of flavour absorption. Because of solubilization of the more apolar <b>flavour</b> <b>compounds</b> limonene, decanal and linalool into the oily phase, only the remaining <b>flavour</b> <b>compounds</b> in the aqueous phase were available for absorption by LLDPE. After 14 days of exposure, absorption of limonene and decanal decreased by 97 °and that of linalool by 86 ÐDue to a salting out effect, absorption of the less apolar ethyl 2 -methylbutyrate (E 2 MB) first increased with increasing oil concentration, but decreased at higher oil concentrations (> 2. 5 g l- 1). Oil/casein and oil/pectin models showed that the more apolar <b>flavour</b> <b>compounds</b> were mainly dissolved in the oily phase and that the compounds present in the aqueous phase could interact with casein or pectin. Oil influenced the level of flavour absorption by LLDPE to a much greater extent than pectin or casein. However, the low amount of fat (1. 11 g l- 1) in skim milk had no influence on the absorption of <b>flavour</b> <b>compounds.</b> Only the proteins in skim milk (especially casein) decreased the absorption of limonene and decanal, because the fat was probably entrapped. Whole milk, which contained a higher concentration of (free) fat, suppressed the absorption of all <b>flavour</b> <b>compounds</b> by LLDPE to the same extent as was found for the oil model solutions. In general, absorption results from skim milk and whole milk were in good agreement with the results of the investigated model solutions containing individual food components...|$|R

40|$|Milk {{proteins}} {{are known}} to bind volatile flavour compounds to varying extents, depending {{on the nature of}} the protein and <b>flavour</b> <b>compound.</b> Processing conditions, such as temperature and pH, are also known to have an influence on the interactions between milk proteins and flavour compounds. These interactions cause a great challenge for flavour scientists because they influence the perceived aroma profile of food products significantly, in particular in low-fat food products. The objectives of this research were to develop a headspace solid-phase microextraction (SPME) method followed by gas chromatography with flame ionisation detection (GC-FID) for the investigation of protein-flavour interactions, and to determine binding parameters of the hydrophobic <b>flavour</b> <b>compound,</b> 2 -nonanone, to individual milk proteins - namely, β-lactoglobulin (β-lg), α-lactalbumin (α-la), bovine serum albumin (BSA), αs 1 -casein, and β-casein -, whey protein isolate (WPI), and sodium caseinate. Secondly, it was the aim to compare the binding of the structurally similar flavour compounds - 2 -nonanone, 1 -nonanal, and trans- 2 -nonenal – to WPI in aqueous solution, and to investigate the effect of heat and high pressure treatment, and pH on the extent of protein-flavour binding. The final objective was to investigate the in vivo release of the reversibly bound <b>flavour</b> <b>compound,</b> 2 -nonanone, from WPI and sodium caseinate using proton transfer-reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS), and to understand the effect of viscosity on flavour release in vivo. The binding of the model <b>flavour</b> <b>compound</b> 2 -nonanone to individual milk proteins, WPI, and sodium caseinate in aqueous solutions was investigated, using headspace SPME followed by GC-FID. The 2 -nonanone binding capacities decreased in the order: BSA > β-lg > α-la > αs 1 -casein > β-casein, and the binding to WPI was stronger than the binding to sodium caseinate. All proteins appeared to have one binding site for 2 -nonanone, except for BSA which possessed two classes of binding sites. The influence of heat treatment, high pressure processing and pH of the protein solutions on the binding of 2 -nonanone, 1 -nonanal, and trans- 2 -nonenal to WPI was determined. The binding of these compounds to WPI decreased in the order: trans- 2 -nonenal > 1 -nonanal > 2 -nonanone. The binding of 2 -nonanone appears to involve hydrophobic interactions only, whereas the aldehydes, in particular trans- 2 -nonenal, also react through covalent binding. Upon both heat and high pressure denaturation, the binding of 2 -nonanone to WPI decreased, the binding of 1 -nonanal remained unchanged, while the binding of trans- 2 -nonenal increased. The binding affinity of the flavour compounds and WPI increased with increasing pH, which is likely to result from pH dependent conformational changes of whey proteins. The in vivo flavour (2 -nonanone) release from solutions of WPI and sodium caseinate was investigated using proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometry. During consumption, 2 -nonanone was partly released from WPI, whereas there was no significant release from sodium caseinate. Even after swallowing of the samples, a substantial amount of flavour was detected in the breath, suggesting that the milk proteins interact with the mucosa in the mouth and throat, resulting in a further release of flavour from mucosa-bound proteins. An increase in viscosity of the protein solutions by the addition of carboxymethylcellulose enhanced the release of 2 -nonanone from WPI, and resulted in 2 -nonanone release from sodium caseinate. This may be due to a thicker coating of the mucosa with the sample solution after swallowing due to the higher viscosity, resulting in additional release of protein-bound flavour. These findings contribute to the knowledge of the interactions that occur between flavour compounds and proteins, which is required to improve food flavouring and to make protein based foods, e. g., low-fat dairy products, sensorily more acceptable to the consumer. The results also emphasize a careful choice of food processing conditions, such as temperature, high pressure or pH to obtain a desirable flavour profile...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAn {{experimental}} method of pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) is proposed {{to evaluate the}} fate of selected <b>flavour</b> <b>compounds</b> in low-temperature (300 °C) tobacco heating conditions. The thermal behaviour of five <b>flavouring</b> <b>compounds</b> (citronellol, menthol, tartaric acid, cinnamic acid, and guaiacol) was studied under conditions to simulate low-temperature tobacco heating at 300 °C, and compared with results obtained using simulated cigarette-combustion conditions with a temperature programme up to 900 °C. The impact of oxygen and nitrogen atmospheres on the thermal transfer and breakdown patterns was also investigated. It was established that the four <b>flavouring</b> <b>compounds</b> of high volatility (citronellol, menthol, cinnamic acid, and guaiacol) evaporated to a high degree (88 – 100 %) during the low- and high-temperature experiments, as well. Guaiacol was the most stable compound under the test conditions; only 0. 3 % decomposition was detected at 900 °C with the oxidative atmosphere. Thermal decomposition reactions were substantially less extensive at the low-temperature heating conditions than with the high-temperature pyrolysis and simulated cigarette combustion. Citronellol and cinnamic acid produced about 1. 5 % decomposition products, while menthol produced 0. 8 %. In general, dehydrogenation reactions were more pronounced in the oxidative atmosphere, while aromatisation was significant in the nitrogen atmosphere, and at high temperatures. More oxo-compounds and less aromatic hydrocarbons were formed in the oxidative atmosphere. Other types of reactions took place with tartaric acid, due to its low volatility. Extensive formation of light carboxylic acids was observed at the low temperature, and cyclic compounds were also formed in addition to carbon oxides and water under both nitrogen and oxidative atmospheres. Intermolecular reactions are proposed to explain these observations. At high temperatures the pyrolysis products of tartaric acid {{were the same as}} at low temperatures, but in the oxidative atmosphere more carboxylic acids and less aldehydes were formed than in pure nitrogen.

40|$|The food {{industry}} could potentially benefit from using pervaporation, a membrane process, to concentrate flavours. This research aimed to investigate its application for concentrating flavours in dairy process streams. Pervaporation experiments {{were carried out}} at a range of operating conditions, using hydrophobic membranes. The feed mixtures were either aqueous model solutions of dairy flavour compounds (acids, esters and ketones), complex model mixtures containing flavour compounds plus non-volatile dairy components, or real dairy products. <b>Flavour</b> <b>compound</b> enrichment factors ranged from below one to above 30, with esters and ketones being concentrated more effectively than acids. Thus, the flavours could be partially fractionated based on their chemical structure. The permeation of acids was reduced by approximately 50 % when the feed pH was increased to near their p Ka values. For flavour compounds with lower molecular weights than approximately 1 20 g mol- I, permeation was controlled mainly by sorption i n the membrane; for larger compounds it was controlled mainly by diffusion through the membrane. The mass transfer of each <b>flavour</b> <b>compound</b> increased with temperature, following an Arrhenius-like relationship. The activation energy was a function of each compound's heat of sorption, its molecular weight, and the elastic modulus of the membrane. The activation energy was also related to the Arrhenius preexponential factor. Thus, fluxes could be estimated through empirical correlations. The non-volatile feed composition was an important factor influencing the pervaporation performance. Milk protein isolate (4 % w/v) or lactose (6 % or 1 2 % w/v) bound with the flavour compounds in the feed, thus lowering the enrichment of sorption-controlled compounds. Milk fat (up to 38 % w/v, {{in the form of}} cream) reduced the enrichment of all the flavour compounds tested. Esters and ketones became unavailable for pervaporation as they partitioned into the fat phase; acids remained mainly in the aqueous phase, but their permeation was reduced because the added cream increased the feed pH. Experiments with real dairy products showed that pervaporation could be used to concentrate diacetylin starter distillate, and to selectively recover short-chain esters from ester cream. Of these two products, starter distillate is the more promising for use as a pervaporation feed stream...|$|E

The volatile flavour fraction of feijoa fruit flesh, seeds and skin were isolated by ethanol extraction and steam distillation. Further an organoleptic evaluation was carried out to distinguish flavour differences within the obtained distillates to decrease the number of samples to be analysed by gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Gas chromatography analysis resulted in 13 identified <b>flavour</b> <b>compounds</b> of the 23 reference compounds used. Results showed gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to be most successful and this technique presented a great amount of data of which seven compounds are reported for the first time as <b>flavour</b> <b>compounds</b> of feijoa fruit; citronellyl acetate, cis-rose oxide, geraniol acetate, isoamyl acetate, ethyl octanoate, D-limonene and humulane- 1, 6 -dien- 3 -ol. Further analysis is needed to evaluate the extent of unique findings of <b>flavour</b> <b>compounds</b> and to evaluate how they contribute to the flavour of feijoa fruit to be able to produce a flavour mixture for the food industry...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} flavour {{absorption}} on the oxygen permeability of low-density polyethylene (LDPE), polypropylene (PP), polycarbonate (PC) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) was studied using an isostatic continuous flow system. Polymer samples {{were exposed to}} a model solution containing limonene, hexyl acetate, nonanone and decanal at 40 °C. After exposure, one part of each sample was analysed for absorbed <b>flavour</b> <b>compounds</b> using a Large Volume Injection GC Ultrasonic 'in vial' extraction method, and from the other part, oxygen permeability was measured in a permeation cell at 25 °C. After 8 h of exposure, LDPE and PP samples showed a significant linear (R 2 = 0. 82 and 0. 99) increase in oxygen permeability of 21 and 130 %, respectively. Owing to swelling of the polymer samples resulting from flavour absorption, {{the structure of the}} polymeric network changed (i. e. opened) and consequently increased oxygen permeability. The oxygen permeability of exposed PC showed a significant linear (R 2 = 0. 78) decrease of 11 % after 21 days. PC obviously did not swell like LDPE or PP. Therefore, it was suggested that absorbed <b>flavour</b> <b>compounds</b> occupied or blocked 'microcavities' through which normally oxygen is transported. Absorption of <b>flavour</b> <b>compounds</b> by PET did not affect the oxygen permeability of PET significantl...|$|R
5000|$|Mash {{enters the}} top of the {{distillation}} column and <b>flavour</b> <b>compounds</b> are separated by boiling points to create high wines. High wines can be further distilled using the pot still (batch process) for concentrated flavours, or double distilled in a column still to strip out flavours and create a base whisky.|$|R
