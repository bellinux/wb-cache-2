40|$|It is {{desirable}} to optimize (minimizing both the inductance and electron flow) the magnetically insulated vacuum sections of low impedance pulsed-power drivers. The goal of low inductance is understandable from basic efficiency arguments. The goal of low electron flow results from two observations: (1)  flowing electrons {{generally do not}} deliver energy to (or even reach) most loads, and thus constitute a loss mechanism; (2)  energetic electrons deposited in a small area can cause anode damage and anode plasma formation. Low inductance and low electron flow are competing goals; an optimized system requires a balance of the two. While magnetically insulated systems are generally forgiving, {{there are times when}} optimization is crucial. For example, in large pulsed-power drivers used to energize high energy density physics loads, the electron flow as a fraction of total current is small, but that flow often reaches the anode in relatively small regions. If the anode temperature becomes high enough to desorb gas, the resulting plasma initiates a gap closure process that can impact system performance. Magnetic-pressure driven (z pinches and material equation of state) loads behave like a fixed inductor for much of the drive pulse. It is clear that neither fixed gap nor constant-impedance transmission lines are optimal for driving inductive loads. This work shows a technique for developing the optimal impedance profile for the magnetically <b>insulated</b> <b>section</b> of a high-current driver. Particle-in-cell calculations are used to validate the impedance profiles developed in a radial disk magnetically insulated transmission line geometry. The input parameters are the spacing and location of the minimum gap, the effective load inductance, and the desired electron flow profile. The radial electron flow profiles from these simulations are in good agreement with theoretical predictions when driven at relatively high voltage (i. e., V≥ 2 [*][*]MV) ...|$|E

40|$|The ProSEDS {{conductive}} tether design incorporates {{two distinct}} types of tethers from a plasma interaction viewpoint. The 200 m {{closest to the}} Delta 11 spacecraft is insulated from the plasma, and the remaining 5000 m is semi-bare. This latter portion is semi-bare {{because it has a}} conductive coating applied to the wires to permit electron collection while also regulating the overall tether temperature. Because the tether possesses these two distinct types of tethers, a transition point exists between the two types that form a triple point with the space plasma. Insulated tethers can suffer from a second plasma interaction if the insulation is weakened or breached, such as by pinholes caused by small particle debris strikes. Because electrodynamic tethers are typically long, they have a high probability of such impacts. These impacting particles may not be of sufficient size to severe the tether, but they can easily be of sufficient size to damage the tether insulation. Samples of both the ProSEDS tether transition region and the <b>insulated</b> tether <b>section</b> (with various degrees of pinhole damage) were placed into the MSFC plasma chamber and biased to typical ProSEDS open circuit tether potentials (- 500 V to - 1600 V).

40|$|Almost 90 years ago, Lillie {{reported}} that rapid saltatory conduction arose in an iron wire model of nerve impulse propagation when {{he covered the}} wire with <b>insulating</b> <b>sections</b> of glass tubing equivalent to myelinated internodes. This led to his suggestion of a similar mechanism explaining rapid conduction in myelinated nerve. In both their evolution and their development, myelinating axons must make a similar transition between continuous and saltatory conduction. Achieving a smooth transition is a potential challenge that we examined in computer models simulating a segmented insulating sheath surrounding an axon having Hodgkin-Huxley squid parameters. With a wide gap under the sheath, conduction was continuous. As the gap was reduced, conduction initially slowed, owing to the increased extra-axonal resistance, then increased (the “rise”) up to several {{times that of the}} unmyelinated fiber, as saltatory conduction set in. The conduction velocity slowdown was little affected by the number of myelin layers or modest changes {{in the size of the}} “node,” but strongly affected by the size of the “internode” and axon diameter. The steepness of the rise of rapid conduction was greatly affected by the number of myelin layers, and axon diameter, variably affected by internode length and little affected by node length. The transition to saltatory conduction occurred at surprisingly wide gaps and the improvement in conduction speed persisted to surprisingly small gaps. The study demonstrates that the specialized paranodal seals between myelin and axon, and indeed even the clustering of sodium channels at the nodes, are not necessary for saltatory conduction...|$|R

40|$|In {{the heating}} and cooling sector, {{borehole}} heat exchangers (BHE) have become increasingly popular for supplying renewable energy. When grouped in compact arrays, BHEs represent suitable thermal energy storage systems for fluctuating heat sources such as solar energy or district heating grids. Tapping into greater depth allows for storage operation on a higher temperature level. This so called medium deep borehole thermal energy storage (BTES) requires negligible groundwater flow in the reservoir rock and the thermal insulation of {{the upper part of}} the boreholes to meet legal requirements and to improve the BHEs’ performance. Medium deep BTES is characterized by a slow thermal response and a large storage capacity, which makes it particularly suitable for seasonal heat storage applications. However, the economic feasibility of these systems is compromised by high investment costs, especially by the expensive drilling of the boreholes. Therefore, a priori numerical simulations of the storage operation are imperative for the systems’ planning and design. Only fully discretized models can account for depth-dependent borehole properties like <b>insulated</b> <b>sections,</b> but the model setup is cumbersome and the simulations come at high computational cost. Hence, these models are often not suitable for the simulation of larger installations and are difficult to handle in mathematical optimization applications. This thesis presents a versatile tool for the simulation and optimization of medium deep BTES systems. The Borehole Heat Exchanger Array Simulation and Optimization tool (BASIMO) includes models for the three most common BHE types: U-pipe, double U-pipe and coaxial pipe BHEs. In a dual-continuum approach, the simulator couples a numerical subsurface model with an analytical solution for the BHEs, which allows for the efficient, but detailed consideration of the relevant thermo physical and operational parameters. With the presented tool, many aspects of BTES systems can be simulated and optimized. The concept of medium deep BTES has not been put into practice so far.

The influence of pH on biosensor performance was established and an operational pH of 8. 0 was selected. Steady-state responses were obtained under quiescent conditions, suggesting a mixed mechanism predominated by radial diffusion, indicative of microelectrode behaviour.

High-performance façades include spectrally selective glazing systems, dynamic elements and <b>insulated</b> spandrel <b>sections.</b> Nevertheless, it is generally accepted that, compared to standard, traditional opaque construction, modern transparent envelopes result in increased overall energy use in these buildings. In this paper, the building façade is treated {{as a part of the}} building perimeter zone, which also includes electric lighting controls, shading attachments, HVAC components, and indoor environmental controls. Consequently, the objective is to balance the need for daylighting and view versus the need for controlling of solar gains and maintaining human comfort, while reducing energy demand for air conditioning and lighting. Key parameters in solving this problem are (1) technological advancements in glazing products, (2) utilization of dynamic building envelope components, and (3) lighting and HVAC controls. In order to demonstrate the potential of high-performance façades, a typical office building with large perimeter zones is used as an example. The basic model consists of standard brick exterior walls with 20 % punched windows. Then, a comparative analysis is performed for a more transparent envelope with dynamic systems including shading and electric lighting controls, for the climates of Chicago and Rome. An integrated thermal-lighting model with flexible dynamic system controls, verified with commercial software, is expanded to simulate more complex façade controls for reducing glare problems while maximizing useful daylight. The results show the advantages of transparent façades with active systems, compared to traditional building envelopes. The more transparent building results in lower operational costs and source energy use, although total site energy use can be higher for heating-dominated climates...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe Atmospheric Plasma Sprayed Thermal Barrier Coatings (APS TBCs) is {{commonly}} used to <b>insulate</b> hot <b>sections</b> in gas turbines. Cyclic oxidation failure usually results from the spallation of the ceramic top coat. In order to predict such spalling phenomena, understanding the mechanisms for cracks initiation and propagation in thermal barriers is a major issue for engine-makers. Failure of the TBC is strongly related to the thermal and mechanical properties of each component of the multi-materials system (substrate, bond coat and ceramic) {{but also to the}} response of the TBC as a whole. The purpose of the present work is to assess the mechanical behavior of a complete TBC using comparative experimental (uniaxial and biaxial loading) and Digital Images Correlation (DIC) analysis approaches for classical TBC microstructures obtained through APS coatings. The experimental characterization of the mechanical behavior of the TBC systems was studied on as deposited specimens. Three Points Bending (3 PB) tests were performed at room temperature, with the ceramic coating either under tension or compression. Additionally, in situ observations during 3 PB tests by a camera, associated to a DIC analysis, allow determining the evolution of the strain field of surface sample correlated with the damage evolution. Location of crack initiation and crack propagation paths up to macroscopic failure were investigated. These tests highlighted the strong differences in mechanical behavior and fracture mode depending on the tension or compression stress state in ceramic coating. Small Punch Tests (SPT) were also performed at room temperature using both geometries (tension/compression). This allows pointing out the similarities of failure modes between uniaxial solicitation and biaxial flexure.

This anode was composed of the mutually <b>insulated</b> four <b>sections.</b> Each segmented anode current was measured by the ammeter which was set in the individual anode circuit, and its waveform was observed by dual beam synchroscope. At the same time another synchroscope was used to examine the waveform of the arc voltage. In case of the total arc current being 10 amp., the arc current was concentrated at a downstream end of the anode throat. Its arc turminus fixed there steadily and its attachment area was small. It was shown that, increasing with the total arc current, the segmented anode current distribution shifts gradually its peak value to the upstream segments of the anode nozzle. For the arc current from 15 to 45 amp., the anode spot moved swiftly {{in the form of the}} restrike mode. The mean velocity of anode arc turminus which was determined from electrical measurement was of the order of 20 ? 150 m/sec. As the gas flow rate a increased, its velocity getting faster. Over 50 amp. the steady mode prevailed again, but the anode arc turminus expanded in its size and moved up to the adjacent upstream segments. In case the total current less than 45 amp. segmented anode current distribution was independent of the argon gas flow rate. When the total arc current increased over 50 amp., the influence of the gas flow rate became considerable, and with increasing the gas flow rate the segmented anode current distribution drifted to the downstream. The arc voltage was dependent on the anode attachment position. As the anode arc turminus shifted to downstream, the value of the arc voltage increased...|$|R
