This work studied the decrease in forming time in <b>gas</b> <b>blow</b> forming using fine-grained Mg alloy AZ 31 B thin sheet with a thickness of 0. 6 mm. The stress-strain rate data showed that fine-grained AZ 31 B thin sheet on testing at 420 °C exhibited strain rate sensitivity exponent values of approximately 0. 29 – 0. 36 in a strain rate ranging from 4 × 10 - 3 and 2 × 10 - 2 s- 1, indicating that the dislocation creep would be a possible deformation mechanism to reduce forming time in <b>gas</b> <b>blow</b> forming. The alloy sheets were successfully deformed into a shallow rectangular pan using constant gas pressure forming. The deformation characteristics of <b>gas</b> <b>blow</b> forming were discussed. As a result, {{a significant reduction in}} forming time was achieved, in which a rectangular pan was formed with a height of 10 mm in less than 105 s at 420 °C.

Decreasing the forming time for <b>gas</b> <b>blow</b> forming of a commercially available fine-grained Mg alloy AZ 31 B thin sheet with a thickness of 0. 6 mm has been studied in the present work. The results indicated that it was feasible to form a shallow rectangular pan with a height of 10 mm in less than 320 sec.

Grain growth was not a serious problem for forming at a temperature of 370 °C. Grain size increased from about 5. 1 μm to a maximum size of about 7. 1 μm.

To observe distinct microstructural effect, three types of AZ 31 alloy sheets which have different average grain size as 16. 41 μm (type-A), 11. 02 μm (type-B), and 7. 58 μm (type-C) were investigated. Among {{the three types of}} AZ 31 alloy sheets, Type-A and Type-B was the partially hardened specimens containing twins (AZ 31 -H) and Type-C was fully annealed specimen with equiaxed grains (AZ 31 -O). At room temperature tensile test, initial microstructural features such as twin density, dislocation density, and grain size affected mechanical properties.

40|$|The {{availability}} of polysilicon feedstock {{has become a}} major issue for the photovoltaic (PV) industry in recent years. Most of the current polysilicon feedstock is derived from rejected material from the semiconductor industry. However, the reject material can become scarce and more expensive during periods of expansion in the integrated-circuit industry. Continued rapid expansion of the PV crystalline-silicon industry will eventually require a dedicated supply of polysilicon feedstock to produce solar cells at lower costs. The photovoltaic industry can accept a lower purity polysilicon feedstock (solar-grade) compared to the semiconductor industry. The purity requirements and potential production techniques for solar-grade polysilicon have been reviewed. One interesting process from previous research involves reactive <b>gas</b> <b>blowing</b> of the molten silicon charge. As an example, Dosaj et all reported a reduction of metal and boron impurities from silicon melts using reactive <b>gas</b> <b>blowing</b> with 0 {sub 2 } and Cl{sub 2 }. The same authors later reassessed their data and the literature, and concluded that Cl{sub 2 }and 0 {sub 2 }/Cl{sub 2 } <b>gas</b> <b>blowing</b> are only effective for removing Al, Ca, and Mg from the silicon melt. Researchers from Kawasaki Steel Corp. reported removal of B and C from silicon melts using reactive <b>gas</b> <b>blowing</b> with an 0 {sub 2 }/Ar plasma torch.
