5|$|The website asserts to its {{visitors}} {{that all}} performers engaged in sexual activities {{depicted in the}} videos appear of their own volition and feel bliss and gratification from the experience. The majority of new entrants to the adult film industry enjoyed their work with Fucking Machines because they discovered it was more socially acceptable to perform with a sexual device, rather than a human partner. Public relations manager for Kink.com Thomas Roche observed in a 2009 interview that Fucking Machines did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>focus</b> on BDSM material. In September 2010 the site had a live filming with an audience of 40 spectators, followed by the introduction in November 2010 of an interactive format in which viewers could watch shoots and recommend devices for the participants. By 2012 the site had 500 hours of archival footage with adult film performers, including Alexis Texas, Flower Tucci, and Sasha Grey.|$|E
25|$|Two {{downloadable}} content packs {{have been}} released, {{both of which}} are actually included in the main game but require premium unlock keys to be accessed. The first, entitled Extreme Fighters Pack, was released on September 21, 2011 and adds three additional planes, the Vanguard, Sparrow X1 and Triwing Vintage. The first two planes feature a design similar to modern day fighter jets, while the latter focuses on older, Red Baron-style planes such as the triplane. The second pack, entitled Gladiator Pack brings six new combat arenas into the game. These new levels <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>focus</b> entirely on dogfights, and have all racing aspects removed.|$|E

A$251.9 million of GRP was also generated directly from tourism in the Frankston area in 2010, and is {{a contributor to the}} A$2.2 billion tourism industry of the greater Mornington Peninsula region. Frankston became a popular seaside destination of Melbourne in the 1880s. And, since the early-2000s, tourism is being reestablished as a key industry in the area. Frankston City Council prepared its first tourism strategy for the area in 2003, which continues to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>focus</b> on its beach and waterfront, cultural and natural heritage, major events and festivals, performing and visual arts, as well as restaurants and shopping—with the majority of which being located within the suburb of Frankston.|$|E

25|$|Spinal {{cord injury}} (SCI) causes damage to nerve roots and fibers that carry {{messages}} {{to and from}} the brain. Spinal cord injuries can result from physical trauma, tumors, developmental disorders or a number of different diseases. In 1995, Christopher Reeve, known for his role in all three Superman movies, was thrown from his horse and landed headfirst into a fence shattering his first and second vertebrae. Reeve’s cervical spinal injury paralyzed him from the neck down. Reeve sought the aid of Dr. John McDonald, who was working at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. After extensive activity-based therapies, Reeve was able to wiggle his toes and move a couple of fingers. Christopher Reeve died in 2004, however his achievements shined light on everyone affected by spinal cord injuries. Dr. McDonald left St. Louis and officially opened the International Center for Spinal Cord Injury (ICSCI) at Kennedy Krieger Institute on June 14, 2005. ICSCI {{is one of the first}} centers to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>focus</b> specifically on children with chronic spinal cord injuries and paralysis. The center utilizes innovative activity-based therapies such as FES cycling, aquatic therapy, and partial weight supported walking to help patients regain sensation and feeling in their bodies. The center combines clinical research with a focus on restoration and rehabilitation for children and adults with chronic paralysis.|$|E
500|$|Miyazaki went to Colmar and Riquewihr in Alsace, France, {{to study}} the {{architecture}} and the surroundings for {{the setting of the}} film. Additional inspiration came from the concepts of future technology in Albert Robida's work. Commentators have stated that Miyazaki's imagery was influenced by his fondness for the [...] "illusion art" [...] of 19th century Europe. Suzuki stated that unlike many Western films, in which the imagery went [...] "from the general [...] the specific," [...] Miyazaki employed a uniquely Japanese approach, frequently beginning with a very specific image and moving from there.

500|$|Tsakalotos {{has been}} {{described}} as a [...] "Revolutionary Europeanist", as he supports European Union integration but not its capitalist principles. In one article, he wrote: [...] " [...] European Monetary Union has created a split between [...] core and periphery, and relations between the two are hierarchical and discriminatory." [...] Tsakalotos has also advocated for a [...] "change in [...] architecture" [...] of the Eurozone. He has also suggested that the EU should <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>focus</b> on the development of member countries, which is what requires this change in architecture. In a May 2012 interview on Lateline, Tsakalotos said: [...] "At the moment the Eurozone is at risk, not because of the Greek radical left – it's at risk because it has an architecture, a financial and economic architecture that is evidently unable to deal with the crisis in the Eurozone, and we think part of the solution is a change in that architecture." [...] In 2011, he cited a move towards fiscal federalism as a potential solution to the EU's economic architecture.|$|E

500|$|For most birds, moult {{begins at}} a certain {{specific}} point, called a focus (plural foci), on the wing or tail and proceeds in a sequential manner in one or both directions from there. [...] For example, most passerines <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>focus</b> between the innermost primary (P1, using the numbering scheme explained above) and outermost secondary (S1), and a focus point {{in the middle of}} the center pair of rectrices. [...] As passerine moult begins, the two feathers closest to the focus are the first to drop. [...] When replacement feathers reach roughly half of their eventual length, the next feathers in line (P2 and S2 on the wing, and both R2s on the tail) are dropped. [...] This pattern of drop and replacement continues until moult reaches either end of the wing or tail. [...] The speed of the moult can vary somewhat within a species. [...] Some passerines that breed in the Arctic, for example, drop many more flight feathers at once (sometimes becoming briefly flightless) in order to complete their entire wing moult prior to migrating south, while those same species breeding at lower latitudes undergo a more protracted moult.|$|E

2500|$|After The Fifth of July, Reeve {{stretched}} his acting range further {{and played a}} homicidal novice playwright trying to kill his lover and mentor Michael Caine in Sidney Lumet's dark comedy film Deathtrap based on the play by Ira Levin. The film was well received. After Superman II, Reeve portrayed partially corrupt Catholic priest John Flaherty in Monsignor. Reeve felt this gave {{him the opportunity to}} play [...] "a morally ambiguous character who was neither clearly good nor clearly bad, someone to whom life is much more complex than the characters I've played previously". Reeve blamed the failure of the film on poor editing. He said [...] "the movie is sort of a series of outrageous incidents that you find hard to believe.
