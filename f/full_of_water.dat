He would record the number of times the bowl sank by putting small stones into a jar.|$|E
5|$|In Pezuelas Lebrón {{began her}} {{education}} in a small community school. Early in her life, Lebrón contracted pneumonia when she accidentally fell into a gutter that was <b>full</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> as a consequence she grew with a frail body {{and was unable to}} keep up with the constant activities of her brothers without feeling fatigue. She developed an introverted and contemplative personality, often spending her time admiring nature around the hacienda.|$|E
5|$|On July10, 2008, {{a tanker}} truck <b>full</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> {{crashed into a}} tree along a portion of NY149 between Bay Road (CR7) and Ridge Road (NY9L) that {{features}} a sharp curve. After the first accident occurred at 3:10 a.m., a second tractor-trailer, who had stopped because of the tanker, rolled in reverse, jackknifing across the road and hitting a car. The road was shut down for the accident, where {{the driver of the}} tanker was taken to Glens Falls Hospital. The drivers of the car and the tractor-trailer that jackknifed were not hurt. The route was reopened by 11:40 a.m. This accident was one of many tractor-trailer accidents that has occurred on this stretch of NY149.|$|E

'Thou waterest it; thou greatly enrichest it with the river of God, which is <b>full</b> <b>of</b> water' (Psa 65:9). <b>Full</b> <b>of</b> grace and truth. Fill the water-pots, saith Christ, up to the brim.

25|$|The Fenjaan {{consisted}} of a large pot <b>full</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> and a bowl with a small hole in the center. When the bowl became <b>full</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> it would sink into the pot, and the manager would empty the bowl and again {{put it on the}} top of the water in the pot. He would record the number of times the bowl sank by putting small stones into a jar. The place where the clock was situated, and its managers, were collectively known as khaneh Fenjaan. Usually this would be the top floor of a public-house, with west- and east-facing windows to show the time of Sunset and Sunrise. There was also another time-keeping tool named a staryab or astrolabe, but it was mostly used for superstitious beliefs and was not practical for use as a farmers' calendar. The Zeebad Gonabad water clock was in use until 1965 when it was substituted by modern clocks.|$|E

In addition, the reactor's containment vessel is leaking large amounts of water into the basement. A TEPCO worker is able to peer into the basement and determines that the 11m deep basement is approximately half <b>full</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E

Divers lowered a video camera on a rod into the compartment and found several bodies.|$|E

25|$|Restoration {{projects}} and plans have {{gone as far}} as the negotiation process, but none has come to fruition. Since 2011, demolition works, minor structural repairs, repairs of the roof structure, and covering the glass roof openings in the concourse have been performed. The basement, which was once <b>full</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> has been fully drained, and a barbed wire fence has been installed in an attempt to keep out vandals and the windows in the tower have been replaced.|$|E
25|$|The Plane was {{designed}} by Gordon Cale Thomas, after a large-scale prototype was built at the company's Bulbourne yard and he had assessed the 75ft climb. It had two tanks, or caissons, each capable of holding two narrowboats or a barge. The caissons were <b>full</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> and so balanced each other. The caissons' vertical guillotine gates created a watertight seal. The lift was powered by a 25-horsepower (19kW) stationary steam engine. The land for the Plane was purchased for £1,595 and total expenses for the project came to £39,244 by 24 June 1900.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} effect {{an escape from}} the {{stricken}} vessel, the escaping crew were required to enter the submarine’s only escape chamber, which can only accommodate one person at a time. As the pressure outside the submarine is greater than the pressure inside, this must be equalised before the outer door of the escape chamber is opened. The escape chamber is flooded with the occupant having to wait until the chamber is completely <b>full</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> Only then will the pressure within the escape chamber be equal to the outside sea pressure.|$|E
25|$|Pascal's work in {{the fields}} of the study of hydrodynamics and hydrostatics {{centered}} on the principles of hydraulic fluids. His inventions include the hydraulic press (using hydraulic pressure to multiply force) and the syringe. He proved that hydrostatic pressure depends not on the weight of the fluid but on the elevation difference. He demonstrated this principle by attaching a thin tube to a barrel <b>full</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> and filling the tube with water up {{to the level of the}} third floor of a building. This caused the barrel to leak, in what became known as Pascal's barrel experiment.|$|E
25|$|The {{greatest}} single alteration to {{the design}} however, came not directly from Stimers but from Admiral Joseph Smith, chief of the Bureau of Yards and Docks in Washington, D.C., who suggested that the oval hull of the ship be surrounded by large iron tanks which could be pumped <b>full</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> in order to lower the ship's freeboard still further when in combat to present an even smaller target, or drained for normal travel. Stimers liked the idea and ordered the changes, but when Ericsson saw the new plans he resigned from the project. The new plans greatly added {{to the design}}'s complexity, requiring sophisticated pumping mechanisms, while the added weight would also reduce speed and buoyancy.|$|E

25|$|From late 1809 Owen Glendower {{operated}} in the Channel. On 10 March 1810, she {{came upon a}} French privateer lugger while her crew was boarding a schooner. Selby chased the lugger for one and half hours. She resisted until she was half <b>full</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> and had had two men killed and three wounded out of her crew of 58. She {{turned out to be}} the Camille, armed with only six of the fourteen guns she carried, having stored eight in her hold. She had sailed from Cherbourg only six hours earlier and had already captured the English schooner Fame, of London, William Proper, Master, which had been sailing from Lisbon to London with a cargo of fruit. Diana later recaptured the Fame.|$|E
25|$|Rabbi Abin the Levite, {{the son of}} Rabbi Judah the Prince, {{taught that}} the Israelites became wealthy from the plague of blood. If an Egyptian and an Israelite were in a house {{where there was a}} barrel <b>full</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> and the Egyptian went to fill a pitcher from the barrel, the Egyptian would find that it {{contained}} blood, while the Israelite would drink water from the same barrel. When the Egyptian asked the Israelite to give the Egyptian some water with the Israelite's own hand, it still became blood. Even if the Egyptian said to the Israelite that they should both drink from one vessel, the Israelite would drink water, but the Egyptian would drink blood. It was only when the Egyptian bought water from the Israelite for money that the Egyptian was able to drink water. And this is how the Israelites became rich.|$|E
25|$|Four {{accounts}} of Berti's experiment exist, but a simple model of his experiment consisted of filling with water a long tube that had both ends plugged, then standing the tube in a basin already <b>full</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> The bottom {{end of the}} tube was opened, and water that had been inside of it poured out into the basin. However, {{only part of the}} water in the tube flowed out, and the level of the water inside the tube stayed at an exact level, which happened to be 10.3m, the same height Baliani and Galileo had observed that was limited by the siphon. What was most important about this experiment was that the lowering water had left a space above it in the tube which had no intermediate contact with air to fill it up. This seemed to suggest the possibility of a vacuum existing in the space above the water.|$|E
