500|$|Dark-skinned American Cream Draft {{horses are}} {{actually}} chestnuts, as the breed is not homozygous for the champagne gene; only one allele {{is needed to}} produce the proper color. Champagne dilutes any base coat color, and in the American Cream Draft, the underlying <b>genetic</b> <b>base</b> color is chestnut. As of 2003, scientists have not found the breed to carry the cream gene, even though breeders refer to the desired color as [...] "cream". The American Cream Draft is never cremello or white, and though the gold coat color with a white mane and tail resembles palomino, the breed's defining characteristics {{are the result of}} the champagne gene.|$|E
500|$|In 1979, the Piedmontese Breeding Co-operative, Ltd. of Saskatchewan, Canada (PBL Co-op of Canada) began {{preparations}} {{to import}} the first Piedmontese cattle into North America. There had been prior attempts at importation of the breed by the PBL Co-op of Canada and other cattle breeders, but the Italian Association {{was reluctant to}} sell any of their purebred breeding stock. [...] Health protocols also created substantial levels of difficulty. The first successful importation occurred {{in the fall of}} 1979 with the arrival of five animals into Canada. [...] Obtaining authorization and transfers to import the first five animals was the culmination of a half decade of effort, the cost of which is estimated at $100,000 per animal based on 2014 values. [...] The following year, Canada received more Italian imports of Piedmontese cattle, including five more bulls. The next year, Italian imports arrived in the US, including three additional sire lines and two cows. [...] It was from that <b>genetic</b> <b>base</b> that the North American breed of Piedmontese cattle began. [...] In 1983, the Canadian Piedmontese Association (CPA) was formed, followed by the Piedmontese Association of the United States (PAUS) in 1984. [...] By the 1990s, imports of semen and embryos were more substantial. [...] Today there are several bloodlines available to cattle raisers in North America.|$|E

40|$|Adaptation and {{reproductive}} isolation, the engines of biological diversity, are still elusive when discussing the <b>genetic</b> <b>bases</b> of speciation. Namely, {{the number of}} genes and magnitude of selection acting positively or negatively on genomic traits implicated in speciation is contentious. Here, we describe the first steps of an ongoing research program aimed at understanding the <b>genetic</b> <b>bases</b> of population divergence {{and reproductive}} isolation in the lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis). A preliminary linkage map originating from a hybrid cross between dwarf and normal ecotypes is presented, whereby some of the segregating AFLP markers {{were found to be}} conserved among natural populations. Maximum-likelihood was used to estimate hybrid indices from non-diagnostic markers at 998 AFLP loci. This allowed identification of the most likely candidate loci that have been under the influence of selection during the natural hybridisation of whitefish originating from different glacial races. As some of these loci could be identified on the linkage map, the possibility that selection of traits in natural populations may eventually be correlated to specific chromosomal regions was demonstrated. The future prospects and potential of these approaches to elucidate the <b>genetic</b> <b>bases</b> of adaptation and reproductive isolation among sympatric ecotypes of lake whitefish is discussed...|$|R

50|$|Many times, domesticated species live {{in or near}} areas {{which also}} still hold {{naturally}} evolved, region-specific wild ancestor species and subspecies. In some cases, a domesticated species of plant or animal may become feral, living wild. Other times, a wild species will come into an area inhabited by a domesticated species. Some of these situations lead {{to the creation of}} hybridized plants or animals, a cross between the native species and a domesticated one. This type of crossbreeding, termed genetic pollution by those who are concerned about preserving the <b>genetic</b> <b>base</b> of the wild species, has become a major concern. Hybridization is also a concern to the breeders of purebred species as well, particularly if the gene pool is small and if such crossbreeding or hybridization threatens the <b>genetic</b> <b>base</b> of the domesticated purebred population.|$|E

40|$|Drought {{tolerance}} (DT) {{and drought}} avoidance (DA) {{are two major}} mechanisms in drought resistance of higher plants. In this study, the <b>genetic</b> <b>bases</b> of DT and DA at reproductive stage in rice were analyzed using a recombinant inbred line population from a cross between an indica lowland and a tropical japonica upland cultivar. The plants were grown individually in PVC pipes and two cycles of drought stress were applied to individual plants with unstressed plants as the control. A total of 21 traits measuring fitness, yield, and the root system were investigated. Little correlation of relative yield traits with potential yield, plant size, and root traits was detected, suggesting that DT and DA were well separated in the experiment. A genetic linkage map consisting of 245 SSR markers was constructed for mapping QTL for these traits. A total of 27 QTL were resolved for 7 traits of relative performance of fitness and yield, 36 QTL for 5 root traits under control, and 38 for 7 root traits under drought stress conditions, suggesting {{the complexity of the}} <b>genetic</b> <b>bases</b> of both DT and DA. Only a small portion of QTL for fitness- and yield-related traits overlapped with QTL for root traits, indicating that DT and DA had distinct <b>genetic</b> <b>bases...</b>|$|R
40|$|Summary:. Syndactyly and polydactyly—respectively {{characterized}} by fused and supernumerary digits—are {{among the most}} common congenital limb malformations, with syndactyly presenting at an estimated incidence of 1 in 2, 000 – 3, 000 live births and polydactyly at a frequency of 1 in approximately 700 – 1, 000 live births. Despite their relatively regular manifestation in the clinic, the etiologies of syndactyly and polydactyly remain poorly understood because of their phenotypic and genetic diversity. Further, even though concrete knowledge of genotypic links has been established for some variants of syndactyly and polydactyly, {{there appears to be}} no single comprehensive published summary of all syndromic and nonsyndromic syndactyly and polydactyly presentations, and there is decidedly no resource that maps all syndromic and nonsyndromic syndactylies and polydactylies to their <b>genetic</b> <b>bases.</b> This gap in the literature problematizes comprehensive carrier screening and prenatal diagnosis and complicates novel diagnostic attempts. This review thus attempts to collect all that is known about the <b>genetic</b> <b>bases</b> of syndromic and nonsyndromic syndactylies and polydactylies, as well as to highlight the dactyly manifestations for which no <b>genetic</b> <b>bases</b> are as yet known.
