40|$|Thesis (MCom (Industrial Psychology)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012 Student <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> {{drop out}} is a concern for higher {{education}} institutions as well for their students. Students with the <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> drop out may eventually drop out and contribute towards the already high dropout rates, which are causing economic damage. Students leaving their institution have vast financial consequences for their institution, as institutions obtain grants from the government according to their success rates. Although previous {{research has been conducted}} on students’ <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> drop out, it is limited, especially when looking at possible predictors that are specific to the South African context. This study contributes towards the gap in research regarding the possible predictors of student <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> drop out. The objectives of this study were to 1) conceptualise the possible predictors of student <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> drop out according to the literature; 2) determine if self-evaluation traits (self-esteem and self-efficacy) are significant predictors of student <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> drop out; 3) determine if student burnout and student engagement are significant predictors of student <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> drop out; 4) determine if social support (social support from parents and general social support) are significant predictors of student <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> drop out; and 5) determine if career decision-making difficulties are significant predictors of student <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> drop out. A non-probability quota sample (N = 782) was used to investigate possible predictors of career student <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> drop out in a sample of university students. Student <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> drop out was measured by one item consisting of two categories: I have no <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> drop out (n = 501), and I have an <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> drop out (n = 280). These two groups were enclosed as a dependent variable in the logistic regression. The variables included in the final model predicted between 13 % (Cox and Snell) and 18 % (Nagelkerke) of the variance in <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> drop out. The {{results of this study suggest}} that self-esteem had an influence on student <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> drop out. Furthermore, it was found that cynicism and dedication have a significant relationship with student <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> drop out. Lastly, lack of information about ways to obtain information also indicated a significant relationship with student <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> drop out. Thus, it may be concluded that self-esteem, burnout and engagement and lack of information about ways of obtaining information have an influence on students’ <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> drop out.

Social influence has {{significant impact on the}} study participants’ behavioral <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> use ICT in tourism. As social influence to use ICT in tourism increases, the behavioral <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> use it also increases. There is also strong positive association between perceived usefulness and behavioral <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> use ICT in the tourism. This shows that users are more interested to integrate ICT in their tourism activities when they think that such technologies will be helpful. The finding also showed significant positive relationship between perceived ease of use and behavioral <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> use ICT in tourism. That means tourism organizations are motivated to use ICTs when such technologies are easy to use letting them to have more time for other activities. There was significant association between cost effectiveness and behavioral <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> use ICT in tourism. Cost-effective ICT facilities are more preferable by tourism organizations. Moreover, there is significant relationship between competitive advantage and behavioral <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> use ICT in tourism. This suggests that users’ behavioral <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> use ICT in tourism increases when they believe that the technology will improve their competitive advantages over their counter parts. Besides, the research illustrated significant association between facilitating conditions and behavioral <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> use ICT in tourism. Tourism organizations’ behavioral <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> use ICT increases when facilitating conditions such as users’ experience, resources, and background ICT skill increases.|$|R
