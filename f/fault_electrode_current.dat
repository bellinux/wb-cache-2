In the experiment under an <b>electrode</b> <b>current</b> control, a bifurcation of the <b>electrode</b> <b>current</b> against the bias voltage, i. e. the negative resistance, was observed. In this paper a comparison of a plasma behavior in a LH transition with that in an HL transition is made in order to investigate the bifurcation phenomena. The <b>electrode</b> <b>current</b> IE is continuously changed using a current-control power supply, and the driving force, the J´B, is actively changed. The plasma parameters, ne, Te and the fluctuation level show sudden change in the negative resistance region, in both LH transition and HL transition. The driving force in the region where the poloidal rotation speed shows a rapid change is greater in LH transition than that in HL transition in the whole region. It implies the existence of a local maximum of an ion viscosity which is predicted by a neoclassical theory. On the other hand, the dependence of radial electric field on the <b>electrode</b> <b>current</b> shows no difference between LH and HL transitions...|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of the low order rational surface (n, m) = (5, 3) on an ion viscosity {{and the formation of}} the radial electric field were investigated by the <b>electrode</b> <b>current</b> sweep biasing with a hot cathode in Tohoku University Heliac (TU-Heliac). During the improved mode, the position of the maximum electric field stayed on the n/m = 5 / 3 rational surface. After the H-L transition the local maxima shifted outward to the plasma periphery of ρ ~ 0. 8. The low order magnetic islands were formed resonating the magnetic Fourier components of (n, m) = (5, 3) by external perturbation coils. As widths of magnetic island were increased, the biasing <b>electrode</b> <b>current</b> required for the improved mode transition increased. It suggested that the ion viscosity increased according to the increase of the magnetic island width. The increase in the biasing <b>electrode</b> <b>current</b> is equivalent to the increase in the driving force for the poloidal rotation.

40|$|During patch clamp recordings, {{measurement}} of passive parameters such as access resistance (Ra), membrane resistance (Rm), and membrane capacitance (Cm) often provides useful information regarding physiological {{changes in the}} cell.

40|$|AbstractPurpose: To {{determine}} whether the concentration of nitric oxide (NO) at the arterial wall is increased subsequent to the abrupt elevation of blood flow in resistance arteries. Methods: Eight dogs underwent laparotomy with anesthesia, and their small bowels were exteriorized. NO concentration was measured with NO-specific electrodes (200 -μ–tip diameter) at the outer wall of the mesenteric arteries. Flow was increased by occlusion of the adjacent mesenteric arteries. In four animals, flow and NO concentration were measured after the administration of Nω-nitro-l-arginine-methyl ester (l-NAME) to inhibit NO production. Results: As arterial flow was increased from a baseline of 5. 4 ± 1. 3 ml/min to 10. 9 ± 1. 8 ml/min (p = 0. 001), NO <b>electrode</b> <b>current</b> was elevated in every animal. With repetition of the flow stimulus, the response tended to be attenuated. In the first experimental trial, NO <b>electrode</b> <b>current</b> measured at the arterial wall increased from 2. 86 ± 0. 56 to 3. 00 ± 0. 60 nA (p = 0. 02). l-NAME (10 mg/kg intravenous) effectively inhibited NO synthase {{as indicated by the}} elevation of mean arterial pressure (11 ± 1. 7 mm Hg; p = 0. 04). After administration of l-NAME, NO <b>electrode</b> <b>current</b> measured at the outer arterial wall fell 0. 23 ± 0. 05 nA (p = 0. 02). Conclusions: The data indicate that a doubling of blood flow in the canine mesenteric resistance arteries is associated with an increase in NO concentration of at least 100 nm at the outer arterial wall. This association is probably a substantial underestimation of the actual concentration because of the geometry of the electrode tip. To our knowledge, ours is the first report of direct in vivo measurement of flow-dependent NO release in resistance arteries. (J Vasc Surg 1998; 27 : 726 - 32. ...|$|R
