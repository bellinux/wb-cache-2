25|$|Both the HD and SD serial {{interfaces}} provide for 16 channels of <b>embedded</b> <b>audio.</b> The two interfaces use different audio encapsulation methods— SD uses the SMPTE 272M standard, whereas HD uses the SMPTE 299M standard. In either case, an SDI signal may contain up to sixteen audio channels (8 pairs) embedded 48kHz, 24-bit audio channels {{along with the}} video. Typically, 48kHz, 24-bit (20-bit in SD, but extendable to 24 bit) PCM audio is stored, in a manner directly compatible with the AES3 digital audio interface. These are placed in the (horizontal) blanking periods, when the SDI signal carries nothing useful, since the receiver generates its own blanking signals from the TRS.|$|E
25|$|Like SMPTE 259M, SMPTE 292M {{supports}} the SMPTE 291M standard for ancillary data. Ancillary data is provided as a standardized transport for non-video payload within a serial digital signal; {{it is used}} for things such as <b>embedded</b> <b>audio,</b> closed captions, timecode, and other sorts of metadata. Ancillary data is indicated by a 3-word packet consisting of 0, 3FF, 3FF (the opposite of the synchronization packet header), followed by a two-word identification code, a data count word (indicating 0 - 255 words of payload), the actual payload, and a one-word checksum. Other than in their use in the header, the codes prohibited to video payload are also prohibited to ancillary data payload.|$|E

2500|$|These {{standards}} {{are used for}} transmission of uncompressed, unencrypted digital video signals (optionally including <b>embedded</b> <b>audio</b> and time code) within television facilities; {{they can also be}} used for packetized data. Coaxial variants of the specification range in length but are typically less than [...] Fiber optic variants of the specification such as 297M allow for long-distance transmission limited only by maximum fiber length or repeaters. SDI and HD-SDI are usually available only in professional video equipment because various licensing agreements restrict the use of unencrypted digital interfaces, such as SDI, prohibiting their use in consumer equipment. Several professional video and HD-video capable DSLR cameras and all uncompressed video capable consumer cameras use the HDMI interface, often called clean HDMI. There are various mod kits for existing DVD players and other devices, which allow a user to add a serial digital interface to these devices.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTo {{increase}} the robustness of the scheme, {{we have developed}} an efficient video watermarking scheme to <b>embed</b> <b>audio</b> watermark based on optimal location. Before <b>embed</b> the <b>audio</b> watermark in to the digital video, the input video sequence is segmented into shots using discrete cosine transform. The segmented video shots are partitioned addicted to number of frames for the embedding process. In this process the PSNR value calculated for each frames and select the best frame by using CS algorithm. The audio data is utilized as a watermark to embed into the digital video sequence. Initially, the audio data is converted into 9 bit sequence and then it is encrypted. In watermarking embedding process, segmented video data {{is given to the}} Coiflets wavelet transform and the encrypted audio watermark data is embedded based on optimal location analysis that is carried out using CS algorithm. Later, the original audio data is extracted from the watermarked video using the designed watermarking extraction procedure.

30|$|In the {{proposed}} scheme, the watermark {{does not require}} to be embedded into the original audio but is used to generate secret and public share images by using the visual cryptography technique. In a nutshell, feature extraction is first accomplished to obtain digital audio’s features by frequency-domain functions. The sharing matrices referred to as codebook are then generated in such ways that have two properties: contrast and secrecy. Instead of data <b>embedding,</b> <b>audio’s</b> features and binary-valued watermark are integrated to construct secret shares based on generated codebook. In other words, the image shares contain watermark information. In contrast to existing schemes [7 – 12] that exploit XOR operation, we employ a visual OR of the shares to reveal the original watermark as its original concept stated in [14].|$|R
