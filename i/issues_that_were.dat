5|$|He {{was known}} for his support of {{representative}} democracy and his populist style. For example, he would hold town halls and let constituents vote on motions to decide what he would do in Congress on their behalf and these meetings helped Bedell understand the problems of his constituents; as a result, he backed <b>issues</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> important to his farming constituency, such as waterway usage fees and production constraints.|$|E
5|$|Modzelewski {{qualified}} {{this view}} by stressing the greatly {{limited access to}} impartial information. Society was intensely indoctrinated at the official level, while families at home, to protect their youth, refrained from criticizing the regime or discussing <b>issues</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> deemed not safe.|$|E
5|$|Despite his willing {{adherence}} to the Southern position on the <b>issues</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> dividing the country, Mallory was not prominent in the secession movement. He advocated reconciliation almost up to the moment that Florida passed its ordnance of secession. That occurred on January 10, 1861, making Florida the third state (behind South Carolina and Mississippi) to leave the Union. On January 21, Mallory delivered his farewell speech in the United States Senate.|$|E

5|$|The {{conflict}} between Old School and New School factions {{merged with the}} slavery controversy. The New School's enthusiasm for moral reform and voluntary societies was evident in its increasing identification with the abolitionist movement. The Old School, however, {{was convinced that the}} General Assembly and the larger church should not legislate on moral <b>issues</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> not explicitly addressed in the Bible. This effectively drove the majority of Southern Presbyterians to support the Old School faction.|$|E

25|$|The United States Populist Party, United States Greenback Party, and the Agrarianism {{movement}} are {{often cited as}} the first truly left-wing political movements within the United States. Nonetheless, while they emphasized economic <b>issues</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> radical by the political standards of the time, they are relatively conservative by today's standards. Historian Richard Hofstadter has taken {{the view that the}} Populist and Agrarian movements were essentially right-wing and reactionary movements, left-wing economic issues notwithstanding.|$|E

25|$|In 1997, {{the black}} humour which had {{featured}} in On the Hour and The Day Today became more prominent in Brass Eye, another spoof current affairs television documentary, shown on Channel 4.

25|$|Probably {{mindful of}} {{environmental}} <b>issues</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> key {{elements in the}} 1985 cancellation of the Westway project, the New York City Industrial Development Agency commissioned an environmental assessment.

25|$|In 1819, after {{securing}} the approval and {{cooperation of the}} Manumission Society of Tennessee, {{of which he was}} an active member, Embree began the publication of a weekly anti-slavery paper at Jonesborough, Tennessee under the name of the Manumission Intelligencer, the first issue of which appeared in March.

25|$|Along with {{identifying}} all of {{the approximately}} 20,000–25,000 genes in the human genome, the Human Genome Project also sought to address the ethical, legal, and social <b>issues</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> created by {{the onset of the}} project. For that the Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications (ELSI) program was founded in 1990. Five percent of the annual budget was allocated to address the ELSI arising from the project. This budget started at approximately $1.57 million in the year 1990, but increased to approximately $18 million in the year 2014.|$|E

These issues consisted of the drilling of oil and natural gas, Congressman Richard Pombo's bill designed to weaken the Endangered Species Act of 1973, {{an amendment to the}} Energy Policy Act of 2005, by Congresswoman Lois Capps to remove section 1502, a provision that would provide liability protection for manufacturers of the gasoline additive MTBE, and the movement to increase fuel economy standards.|$|E

25|$|Bileaflet {{heart valves}} consist of two semicircular {{leaflets}} that rotate about struts {{attached to the}} valve housing. This design was introduced in 1979 and while {{they take care of}} some of the <b>issues</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> seen in the other models, bileaflets are vulnerable to backflow and so they cannot be considered as ideal. Bileaflet valves do, however, provide much more natural blood flow than caged-ball or tilting-disc implants. One of the main advantages of these valves is that they are well tolerated by the body. Only a small amount of blood thinner is needed to be taken by the patient each day in order to prevent clotting of the blood when flowing through the valve.|$|E
25|$|On 18 April 1955, {{fourteen}} representatives met at Camp Detrick in Frederick, Maryland. The {{meeting was}} to share knowledge and experiences regarding biosafety, chemical, radiological, and industrial safety <b>issues</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> {{common to the}} operations at the three principal biological warfare (BW) laboratories of the U.S. Army. Because of the potential implication of the work conducted at biological warfare laboratories, the conferences were restricted to top level security clearances. Beginning in 1957, these conferences were planned to include non-classified sessions as well as classified sessions to enable broader sharing of biological safety information. It was not until 1964, however, that conferences were held in a government installation not associated with a biological warfare program.|$|E
25|$|Pokémon Go was {{released}} to mixed reviews, with critics praising the game's concept and {{the incentive to}} be more active in the real world, while criticizing frequent technical <b>issues</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> prevalent {{around the time of}} the original launch. Despite such reviews, it quickly became a global phenomenon and was one of the most used and profitable mobile apps in 2016, having been downloaded more than 500million times worldwide. It was credited with popularizing location-based and augmented reality technology, promoting physical activity, and helping local businesses grow due to increased foot traffic. However, it also attracted controversy for contributing to various accidents, as well as becoming a public nuisance at some locations. Various governments also expressed concerns over the security of the game, with some countries passing legislation to regulate its use.|$|E
