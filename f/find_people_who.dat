As a result, the newspaper insisted on verifying Vanunu's story with leading nuclear weapon experts, including former U.S. nuclear weapons designer Theodore Taylor and former British AWE engineer Frank Barnaby, who agreed that Vanunu's story was factual and correct. In addition, a reporter, Max Prangnell, was sent to Israel to <b>find</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> knew Vanunu and verify his story. Prangnell verified Vanunu's backstory, meeting a few people at Ben-Gurion University who identified Vanunu from a photograph, as well as meeting neighbors and others who confirmed he had worked at the Dimona nuclear plant.|$|E
25|$|Wapishana is {{classified}} {{as a member of}} the Arawak language family. Wapishana is the only remaining Arawakan language in the circum-Roraima area. The term Arawak is more generally used to refer to the Arawakan or Lokono languages spoken in Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana and in some of the Antilles Islands. Most Brazilian Wapishana often speak Portuguese, instead of Wapishana and many Guyanese Wapishana speak English in addition to Wapishana. Portuguese is the dominant language among the Wapishana who live in urban areas that are bilingual in Portuguese and Wapishana, especially among the younger generations. According to Migliazza, more than 80% of Wapishana can speak the national language with which they are in contact, Portuguese in Brazil or English in Guyana. Since someone can cross the border between the two countries so easily, it is common to <b>find</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> speak Portuguese and English, as well as the maternal language.|$|E

500|$|Grant {{set out to}} {{establish}} himself as what McCann calls the [...] "epitome of masculine glamour", and made Douglas Fairbanks his first role model. McCann notes that Grant's career in Hollywood immediately took off because he exhibited a [...] "genuine charm", which made him stand out among the other good looking actors at the time, making it [...] "remarkably easy to <b>find</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> were willing to support his embryonic career". He made his feature film debut with the Frank Tuttle-directed comedy This is the Night (1932), playing an Olympic javelin thrower opposite Thelma Todd and Lili Damita. Grant disliked his role and threatened to leave Hollywood, but to his surprise a critic from Variety praised his performance, and thought that {{he looked like a}} [...] "potential femme rave".|$|E
500|$|On the moors, when dried turves {{were ready}} to be collected, {{temporary}} track sections were laid {{at right angles to}} the main line, and a portable turntable was installed. A rake of twelve wagons could then be moved onto the temporary track, one at a time, to be filled by a 'filling gang'. Each wagon held about a ton, and once all twelve had been manoeuvred over the turntable back onto the main line, they would be pulled to the works by horses. With the advent of the small Lister engines, a new system was used, where three curved sections of track were used, the end one being clipped onto the top of the main line track. The engines could then push a line of forty or fifty wagons onto the temporary track. Cutting of the peat was mechanised from 1963, with the introduction of German peat-cutting machines, and by 1970, all hand cutting had ceased. Loading of the turves into wagons was also initially by hand, but gradually 'sod collectors' were introduced, which at Swinefleet had a [...] conveyor and at Hatfield a [...] one. These enabled a single side track to serve a much wider section of moor, without having to move the track. Loading turves onto the start of the conveyor was still done manually, but it became difficult to <b>find</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> wanted to do the work, and so Hymac loaders were used to load peat directly into the wagons. The success of this process at Hatfield in 1981 lead to it being used at Swinefleet as well.|$|E

500|$|With [...] "Human Stupidity", Creangă {{builds a}} fable about {{incompetence}} in its absolute forms. The story {{centers on a}} peasant's quest to <b>find</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> are less rational than his wife, having been infuriated by her panic at the remote possibility that a ball of salt could fall from its place of storage and kill their baby. This, essayist and chronicler Simona Vasilache argues, highlights [...] "a family-based division" [...] of illogical behavior, in which women are depicted as the main propagators of both [...] "astonishing nonsense" [...] and [...] "prudent stupidity". Instead, literary critic Ion Pecie identified inside the narrative a meditation on [...] "the link between spirit and nature", with the unpredictable ball of salt representing {{the equivalent of a}} [...] "sphinx". His colleague Gheorghe Grigurcu argued that such conclusions [...] "may seem excessive", but that they were ultimately validated by the literary work being [...] "a plurality of levels". A similar piece is the prose fable [...] "The Story of a Lazy Man": fed up with the protagonist's proverbial indolence, which has led him as far as to view chewing food as an effort, his fellow villagers organize a lynching. This upsets the sensibility of a noblewoman who happens to witness the incident. When she offers to take the lazy man into her care and feed him bread crumbs, he seals his own fate by asking: [...] "But are your bread crumbs soft?" [...] The peculiar effect of this moral is underlined by Anghelescu: [...] "The lazy man dies as a martyr of his own immobility." [...] Braga interpreted the story as evidence of [...] "the primacy of ethics" [...] over social aspects in the local tradition. Ion Pecie saw in the story proof of Creangă's own support for capital punishment with a preventive or didactic purpose, even in cases were the fault was trivial or imagined, concluding: [...] "Here,... Creangă loses much of his depth." [...] Pecie's conclusion was treated with reserve by Grigurcu, who believed that, instead, the narrator refrains from passing any judgment on [...] "the community's instinctual eugenic reaction".|$|E

2500|$|To make up {{for this}} disparity, the NKVD worked prisoners harder than ever. To meet rising demand, prisoners worked longer and longer hours, and on lower food-rations than ever before. A camp {{administrator}} said in a meeting: [...] "There are cases when a prisoner is given only {{four or five hours}} out of twenty-four for rest, which significantly lowers his productivity." [...] In the words of a former Gulag prisoner: [...] "By the spring of 1942, the camp ceased to function. It was difficult to <b>find</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> were even able to gather firewood or bury the dead." [...] The scarcity of food stemmed in part from the general strain on the entire Soviet Union, but also lack of central aid to the Gulag during the war. The central government focused all its attention on the military, and left the camps to their own devices. In 1942 the Gulag set up the Supply Administration to find their own food and industrial goods. During this time, not only did food become scarce, but the NKVD limited rations in an attempt to motivate the prisoners to work harder for more food, a policy that lasted until 1948.|$|E

2500|$|Around 1996 {{many artists}} began {{moving into the}} Third Ward. In 2011 Danyahel Norris, a Third Ward {{resident}} and a legal research instructor and attorney at Texas Southern University, said that he observed {{the first sign of}} gentrification in the Third Ward in 2000, when a crack house was converted into a high-end residence. By 2004, many wealthier African Americans and Whites began to move into the Third Ward area. Some activists in the Third Ward area created campaigns encouraging area residents to not sell their homes to new residents to avoid gentrification and re-development. By 2006 many townhouses appeared in the area across the freeway from the Third Ward, with childless couples, empty nesters, and yuppies occupying the movements. Garnet Coleman—a state representative from the area—expressed his opposition to gentrification and a desire to keep the original residents in the neighborhood. Coleman had some control over the Midtown Tax Increment Financing District, which bought land in the Third Ward and enacted deeds restricting what may be done with the land, so that the land could indefinitely be used to house low income residents. In 2009, Coleman said [...] "We learned a lot from the debacle in the Fourth Ward. So it would be stupid not to respond to the negative byproducts of rapid development. We want to <b>find</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> will make this community better by becoming part of its fabric, not by changing its fabric." [...] In 2010 Norris published an article in the Thurgood Marshall Law Review stating how existing Third Ward residents could continue to keep their properties, including enforcing deed restrictions; because the City of Houston does not have zoning, many Houston neighborhoods use deed restrictions to maintain their existing setups and atmospheres.|$|E
2500|$|In Kanchana Sita, {{the roles}} of the epic heroes like are played by Adivasis (tribal members) from Andhra Pradesh known as the Rama Chenchus (also known as Koyas), who claim that they are the {{descendants}} of the Ikshvaku clan, to which Rama belonged. Aravindan's idea was not to use conventional actors, but to <b>find</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> had reached the state of awareness that the role required. Rama Chenchu healers play the central roles of Rama, Lakshmana, Bharata, Lava, and Kusha. Shambukha was played by a wayside tapasvi, while a destitute woman acted in the role of his wife. The credited cast of the film includes Ramdas, Venkateswarlu, Chinna Pulliah, Kesava Panicker, Krishnan, Pottiah, Rangiah, Siva, Sobha Kiran, and Annapurna. The name of each village chief is Ramdas. The tribal who acted as Rama is also a village chief. Valmiki's character was played by poet and dramatist Kavalam Narayana Panicker's brother Kesava Panicker. Director John Abraham gave voice for this character. When asked how he got the idea to use tribals for the film, Aravindan said, [...] "These tribals come to Trivandrum to sell herbal medicine. They are extremely intelligent. In fact, the tribals inhabiting the nine villages around the Godavari river in Andhra are supposed to have the highest I.Q. among Indian tribals. The tribe I selected is known as the Rama Chenchus. They claim to belong to the dynasty of Rama. Physically, I feel, they fit the description given by Valmiki." [...] This experiment in casting resulted in several difficulties during production. A precise detailing had to be done because most of the actors could only react to demonstrated instructions. Communication with the actors was carried out with the help of Manohar Dutt, painter and lecturer at the College of Fine Arts, Hyderabad. Dutt also accompanied Aravindan and his associate, journalist and filmmaker Chintha Ravi, on a preliminary trip to Andhra Pradesh to finalise the locations.|$|E
