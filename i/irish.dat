5|$|During the {{economic}} {{expansion of the}} 1830s, <b>Irish</b> and German immigration to St. Louis increased substantially. In particular, the writings of Gottfried Duden encouraged German immigration. Many <b>Irish</b> were motivated by the <b>Irish</b> potato famine of 1845–1846 and the failed <b>Irish</b> uprising of 1848. Other <b>Irish</b> settlers came because of its reputation as a Catholic city.|$|E

5|$|The Easter Rising was a {{rebellion}} staged in Ireland during Easter Week, 1916. It was mounted by <b>Irish</b> republicans with {{the aims of}} ending British rule in Ireland and establishing an <b>Irish</b> Republic. Organised by the Military Council of the <b>Irish</b> Republican Brotherhood, the rising lasted from 24–30 April 1916. Members of the <b>Irish</b> Volunteers, joined by the smaller <b>Irish</b> Citizen Army, along with 200 members of Cumann na mBan, seized key locations in Dublin and proclaimed an <b>Irish</b> Republic independent of Britain.|$|E
5|$|The {{phonology}} of the <b>Irish</b> language {{varies from}} dialect to dialect; {{there is no}} standard pronunciation of <b>Irish.</b> Therefore, {{this article focuses on}} phenomena that pertain generally to most or all dialects, and on the major differences among the dialects. Detailed discussion of the dialects {{can be found in the}} specific articles: Ulster <b>Irish,</b> Connacht <b>Irish,</b> and Munster <b>Irish.</b>|$|E

5|$|Another {{impact was}} the {{competition}} with Canada that Australia and New Zealand had with <b>Irish</b> immigration. The increasing <b>Irish</b> immigration {{was seen as}} an economic boon by these antipodean countries. One {{of the reasons for the}} increase was due to many <b>Irish</b> deciding against emigrating to the warring nations of North America.|$|E

5|$|Descended from <b>Irish</b> {{nationalist}} grandparents on both sides, Neal {{has been}} an advocate for <b>Irish</b> concerns throughout his Congressional career, pushing to keep the United States involved in the Northern Ireland peace process. He is the co-chair of the ad hoc Committee on <b>Irish</b> Affairs, has been chairman of the Friends of Ireland since 2007, and was considered {{as a candidate for}} United States Ambassador to Ireland in 1998. After the disarmament of the <b>Irish</b> Republican Army (IRA) in September 2005, Neal was among a group of Congressmen who met with Sinn Féin MP Martin McGuinness to congratulate him on the action of disarmament and ensure a lasting peace had been reached. Neal invited Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams to the inauguration of Barack Obama in January 2009. Neal has been named {{as one of the top}} 100 Irish-Americans by <b>Irish</b> America magazine and received the International Leadership Award from The American Ireland Fund in 2002.|$|E
5|$|During his lifetime, the <b>Irish</b> {{schools were}} not as {{successful}} as Smith had anticipated.

5|$|Florence Nagle (26 October 1894– 30 October 1988) was {{a trainer}} and breeder of racehorses, a breeder of {{pedigree}} dogs, and an active feminist. Nagle purchased her first <b>Irish</b> Wolfhound in 1913, {{and went on}} to own or breed twenty-one United Kingdom Champions. Best in Show at Crufts in 1960 was awarded to Sulhamstead Merman, who was bred, owned and exhibited by Nagle. She also competed successfully in field trials with <b>Irish</b> Setters, from the 1920s until the mid-1960s resulting in eighteen Field Trial Champions. The male dog who was a linchpin in the 1970s revival of the <b>Irish</b> Red and White Setter breed was descended from one of Nagle's <b>Irish</b> Setters.|$|E
5|$|Following a spell in England {{playing for}} Sheffield Wednesday and Grimsby Town, Roy Coyle joined the club as player-manager, {{taking over the}} reigns from {{outgoing}} manager Billy Campbell. After a tough start to his managerial career at the club, Coyle {{went on to become}} the most successful Linfield manager in history, winning numerous trophies during his time at Windsor Park. His first season in charge was without silverware. In fact, having been <b>Irish</b> Cup runners-up the previous season when Coleraine defeated the Blues 1–0 after two replays, Linfield suffered one of the biggest upsets in Northern <b>Irish</b> football history when B Division club Carrick Rangers defeated the Blues 2–1 in the 1975–76 <b>Irish</b> Cup final on 10 April 1976. This giant-killing act in which a junior club defeated a senior club in the <b>Irish</b> Cup final had only happened twice before in the cup's history, and not since 1955 – 21 years earlier. The club stuck by Coyle however, and it was not long before he brought silverware to the club. His first honour arrived in the 1976–77 season in the form of the County Antrim Shield. However, the Blues suffered defeat in the <b>Irish</b> Cup final for the third consecutive season when they once again lost out against Coleraine – losing 4–1. The 1977–78 season saw the club win an <b>Irish</b> League, <b>Irish</b> Cup and Ulster Cup treble. Runners-up in the last three <b>Irish</b> Cup finals, this time they were not to be denied. A 3–1 victory over Ballymena United secured the club's third trophy of the season.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{establishment}} of the <b>Irish</b> Free State in December 1922, <b>Irish</b> peers ceased to elect representatives, although those already elected were allowed to serve for life; the last of the temporal peers, The 4th Earl of Kilmorey (a peer from an Ulster family), died in 1961. Disputes then arose as to whether representative peers could still be elected. The Act establishing the <b>Irish</b> Free State was silent on the matter, although the <b>Irish</b> Free State (Consequential Provisions) Act 1922 had abolished the office of Lord Chancellor of Ireland, whose involvement was required in the election process; the office of Clerk of the Crown had also been abolished in Ireland. Various <b>Irish</b> peers petitioned the House of Lords for a restoration of their right to elect representatives. In 1962, the Joint Committee on House of Lords Reform rejected such plans. In the next year, when the Peerage Act 1963 (which, among other things, gave all peers in the Peerage of Scotland the right to sit in the House of Lords) was being considered, an amendment to similarly allow <b>Irish</b> peers to attend was defeated, ninety to eight. Instead, the new Act gave all <b>Irish</b> peers the right to stand for election to the House of Commons, and to vote at parliamentary elections.|$|E
5|$|George Lee (born 27 September 1962) is an <b>Irish</b> economist, journalist, {{television}} and radio presenter, and former Fine Gael politician. He worked for RTÉ from 1992 to 2009. He was appointed Economics Editor in 1996. During his time in RTÉ News and Current Affairs he was named <b>Irish</b> Journalist of the Year for uncovering a major tax evasion and overcharging scandal at National <b>Irish</b> Bank. He has also presented many documentary programmes for RTÉ.|$|E
5|$|Green was the {{traditional}} color of <b>Irish</b> nationalism, {{beginning in the}} 17th century. The green harp flag, with a traditional gaelic harp, became {{the symbol of the}} movement. It was the banner of the Society of United Irishmen, which organized the <b>Irish</b> Rebellion of 1798, calling for <b>Irish</b> independence. The uprising was suppressed with great bloodshed by the British army. When Ireland achieved independence in 1922, green was incorporated into the national flag.|$|E
5|$|Historically, the British and <b>Irish</b> Lions were {{intended}} as a representative team of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland however, when the <b>Irish</b> Free State {{broke away from the}} United Kingdom it was deemed inappropriate for the British and <b>Irish</b> Lions to use the British national anthem, God Save the Queen. As a result of this, the British and <b>Irish</b> Lions did not have an anthem to represent them before any of their matches until 2005.|$|E

5|$|In 1910, {{team captain}} Bob Milne left the club with a legacy {{as one of}} Linfield's best ever players. He had amassed nine <b>Irish</b> Cups, eight league titles, and had earned 27 {{international}} caps for Ireland during his time at the club. Another Scot, Marshall McEwan, joined Linfield in 1911 {{at the age of}} 26. He had previously played for Blackpool, Bolton Wanderers and Chelsea. McEwan is perhaps best remembered for his performance in the 1913 <b>Irish</b> Cup final, described by some fans as the best in years. McEwan retired in 1916, but remained in Belfast and later opened several businesses. In 1915, the <b>Irish</b> League was suspended as a result of World War I. In its place, a temporary unofficial league known as the Belfast & District League was set up and ran for four seasons until the return of the <b>Irish</b> League in 1919. As this was an unofficial competition, any titles during this time are not counted as <b>Irish</b> League Championships. Linfield won this competition twice, in 1915–16 along with the <b>Irish</b> Cup, and in 1917–18.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, {{the frustrations}} caused by delays to <b>Irish</b> home rule led the MPs of Sinn Féin, a pro-independence party that {{had won a}} {{majority}} of the <b>Irish</b> seats in the 1918 British general election, to establish an independent parliament in Dublin, at which <b>Irish</b> independence was declared. The <b>Irish</b> Republican Army simultaneously began a guerrilla war against the British administration. The Anglo-Irish War ended in 1921 with a stalemate and the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, creating the <b>Irish</b> Free State, a Dominion within the British Empire, with effective internal independence but still constitutionally linked with the British Crown. Northern Ireland, consisting of six of the 32 <b>Irish</b> counties which had been established as a devolved region under the 1920 Government of Ireland Act, immediately exercised its option under the treaty to retain its existing status within the United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|In episode five, Tim Pigott-Smith plays Hampton Wilder, a {{character}} who was based on Richard Nixon and Jeffrey Archer. In the same episode, Naoko Mori appeared as a lover of Danny's; Mori previously appeared in Psychos, another series produced by Kudos. In the finale, <b>Irish</b> actor Lorcan Cranitch plays <b>Irish</b> splinter group terrorist Patrick McCann. Cranitch had previously appeared in several other dramas as Provisional <b>Irish</b> Republican Army (IRA) operators.|$|E
5|$|In stamp {{collecting}} circles, the word forerunner usually describes {{a postage stamp}} used during the time period before a region or territory issues stamps of its own. However, in <b>Irish</b> reference books, such as Handbook of <b>Irish</b> Philately, the term forerunners usually refers to political and propaganda labels. These often resemble stamps, but few of them were used on <b>Irish</b> mail {{and they had no}} legal standing for mail in Ireland.|$|E
5|$|In the 1820s, Boston's {{population}} grew rapidly, and the city's ethnic composition changed dramatically {{with the first}} wave of European immigrants. <b>Irish</b> immigrants dominated {{the first wave of}} newcomers during this period, especially following the <b>Irish</b> Potato Famine; by 1850, about 35,000 <b>Irish</b> lived in Boston. In {{the latter half of the}} 19th century, the city saw increasing numbers of <b>Irish,</b> Germans, Lebanese, Syrians, French Canadians, and Russian and Polish Jews settling in the city. By the end of the 19th century, Boston's core neighborhoods had become enclaves of ethnically distinct immigrants. Italians inhabited the North End, <b>Irish</b> dominated South Boston and Charlestown, and Russian Jews lived in the West End. <b>Irish</b> and Italian immigrants brought with them Roman Catholicism. Currently, Catholics make up Boston's largest religious community, and the <b>Irish</b> have played a major role in Boston politics since the early 20th century; prominent figures include the Kennedys, Tip O'Neill, and John F. Fitzgerald.|$|E

5|$|Ireland once {{dominated}} the world's market for whiskey, producing 90% of the world's whiskey {{at the start}} of the 20th century. However, as a consequence of bootleggers during the prohibition in the United States (who sold poor-quality whiskey bearing Irish-sounding names thus eroding the pre-prohibition popularity for <b>Irish</b> brands) and tariffs on <b>Irish</b> whiskey across the British Empire during the Anglo-Irish Trade War of the 1930s, sales of <b>Irish</b> whiskey worldwide fell to a mere 2% by the mid-20th century. In 1953, an <b>Irish</b> government survey, found that 50 per cent of whiskey drinkers in the United States had never heard of <b>Irish</b> whiskey.|$|E
5|$|Ireland participated at the Eurovision Song Contest 2007 after Radio Telefís Éireann (RTÉ), the <b>Irish</b> broadcaster, {{internally}} {{selected the}} <b>Irish</b> traditional group Dervish {{to represent them}} at the 2007 contest, held in Helsinki, Finland.|$|E
5|$|Ireland was a net food exporter. The excess {{was shipped}} to Britain. The <b>Irish</b> Mercantile Marine ensured that <b>Irish</b> agricultural, and other, exports reached Britain, and that British coal arrived in Ireland. Some {{foods such as}} wheat, citric fruits and tea were imported. Ireland {{depended}} on, mainly, British tankers for petroleum. Initially <b>Irish</b> ships sailed in British convoys. In the light of experience they chose to sail alone, relying on their neutral markings. German respect for that neutrality varied from friendly to tragic.|$|E
