40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Visual Analytics is a multi-disciplinary field that uses interactive visualisations to promote and assist the analytic reasoning and generate insights. Understanding the perceptual and cognitive factors {{is key to the}} progress in this field. This research focuses on understanding the benefits of interaction in terms of <b>insight</b> <b>generation</b> Moreover, this investigation explores the compounding effects individual differences have with interaction when analysing data to generate insights. This study investigated the individual differences in two sets; psychometric set measures, and a sensorial preferences multimodal learning style. Interaction was analysed from an information visualisation perspective, exploring the Visual Mapping and View Transformation interaction, by isolating interaction as an independent variable. Moreover, the View Transformation experiment used two different visual representations 2 D and 3 D. Additionally, the individual differences were analysed using the aptitude-by-treatment interaction (ATI) methodology. The ATI approach enabled the assessment of the performance gains in terms of <b>insight</b> <b>generation</b> according to pre-defined set levels of individual differences measures. This thesis confirms the benefits of interaction in generating more insights and increasing their accuracy, whilst facilitating the generation of insights requiring lower mental effort. Further, the results show significant conjoint effects between interaction and individual differences. Furthermore this research revealed a performance difference between 2 D and 3 D visual representation in the serious game problem solving context. Overall, this thesis provides tangible proof that both visual mapping and view transformation interaction are beneficial to visual analytics in generating insights. Strengthening the view that interaction with the problem-set improves understanding, and the number of insights gleaned into the problem and that more research into the use of individual differences, as a performance predictor in Visual Analytics is beneficial...|$|E

The approach followed in the paper is a conceptual discussion, extended by two short case studies. Findings are that the quality of the model and the expertise of the modeler are necessary, but not sufficient requirements for organizational impact. Further research should concentrate on the detailed analysis of additional requirements. Practical implications are an increased embedding of system dynamics projects in organizational intervention architectures.

In a group session these insights were translated into product ideas. It was concluded that it is indeed possible to generate product ideas with a practice oriented approach. The experiments in the home context helped the participants to come up with practice level bathing innovations. As predicted, they turned out to have potential to yield strong reductions in resource consumption and compete with the currently dominant practice of daily showering.

40|$|Driven by {{a global}} {{movement}} towards transparent governance, {{an increasing number}} of cities are opening up their data. Aside from the obvious economic possibilities, this data also offers citizens the possibility to understand the urban context, to gain insights on civic opportunities and challenges, or to organize debates on civic issues. However, if this data is expected to reach a wide variety of citizens, the visualizations should fit into the existing communicative ecology of cities. In this thesis, we present the concept of public visualization, which brings data in an opportunistic way to citizens by situating data at the actual location of its capturing, thereby allowing social interactions and fostering civic engagement. Through a series of in-the-wild studies, in which visualization prototypes are deployed in the real world, we explore how design aspects of the content of public visualization, its carrying artifact and the surrounding environment affect <b>insight</b> <b>generation.</b> * In Street Infographics, a guerrilla-style intervention that augmented actual street signage with statistic information, we explored the effect of spatially contextualizing public visualizations on user engagement and insight generation; * In Sight on Local Data, a physical see-through artifact placed in a public street, we studied the influence of tangible versus touch interaction on how people engage with public visualization; * In Bicycle Barometer, a cyclist-specific public polling display, we investigated how contextual elements such as location, material qualities and interaction design aspects affect participation rate. * In Narrative Visualization, a visualization shown on a public touch-enabled display, we evaluated how narrative annotations integrated in public visualization affects <b>insight</b> <b>generation.</b> * In Data on Site, a public visualization toolkit for spatial distribution is deployed to raise awareness on the issue of air pollution, which we evaluated in different neighborhood contexts. In summary, this dissertation contributes to the understanding of public visualization as a means to create awareness and reflection on local and civic issues, to elicit social discussion and to trigger considerate civic responses, thereby demonstrating how data-driven and well-situated technological interventions in public space can support the involvement of citizens in civic debates. nrpages: 190 status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Sleep {{has been}} shown to foster the process of <b>insight</b> <b>generation</b> in young adults during problem solving activities. Aging is {{characterized}} by substantial changes in sleep architecture altering memory consolidation. Whether sleep might promote the occurrence of insight in older adults as well has not yet been tested experimentally. To address this issue, we tested healthy young and old volunteers on an insight problem solving task, involving both explicit and implicit features, before and after a night of sleep or a comparable wakefulness period. Data showed that insight emerged significantly less frequently after a night of sleep in older adults compared to young. Moreover, {{there was no difference in}} the magnitude of insight occurrence following sleep and daytime -consolidation in aged participants. We further found that acquisition of implicit knowledge in the task before sleep potentiated the gain of insight in young participants, but this effect was not observed in aged participants. Overall, present findings demonstrate that a period of sleep does not significantly promote insight in problem solving in older adults...|$|E

40|$|User {{centered}} {{design is}} a process which aims to understand user needs and desires by using different tools and methods. This is challenging in the industry as companies have different goals compared to the academic discipline of user centered design. As companies have different goals, common UCD methods which {{are used in the}} academic field are often not used. Therefore, there is a gap in how UCD is done in practice compared to theory. Designers and user experience specialists must use the tools which are available, capitalize on the opportunity to use existing resources in the organization in order to understand users and their needs. Insights explain the why and the motivation of the consumer or user, and they are less apparent and intangible, hidden truths that result from continuous digging. Insights can be draw from several different sources, from data and qualitative sources. This thesis investigates from what available sources in an organization can insights be generated from in order to understand users and design better experiences, specifically from the organizations perspective. The purpose is not only to understand users but to drive the organization’s objectives and goals.
