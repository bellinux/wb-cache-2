Periodic {{monitoring}} of pumping units reducer vibration {{allow for a}} prediction of its full or residual resource to the next repair, which can be estimated {{on the basis of}} extrapolation methods and classification. Considering these two methods, we can say that the advantage extrapolation method has its accuracy and the possibility of adaptation to each specific gear, and the disadvantages include its complexity and the need to respect the conditions of constant change over time the vibration characteristics of the selected gear by law. In the application of classification method, which is simple, you need to process a certain amount of statistical data derived from the operation of machines, swing or perform experiments on a special stand that is relatively complex. In addition, the practice shows that the use of statistical techniques often makes accurate predictions due to the large gap modes of machines, swing and various properties of the pumped wells product, so the decision was made in solving this problem use the method of construction and extrapolation of time trend change of gear operating parameters. In Borislav CBPC the diagnostic examination of a number of reducers RN - 2300 were conducted and the optimal level of vibration determined, whereby it can be concluded the qualitative repair of this type of gear. Some sensors during testing were installed on the gear housing near the output shaft. The average frequency of rotation of the <b>input</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>gear</b> was during vibroobservations was obtained respectively: fvh = 3. 9 Hz and fvh = 3. 53 Hz. Processing of the results was conducted by software MathCAD. Acceptable level of vibration that is recommended by standard GOST ISO 8579 - 2 - 2002 for gear RN - 2300 is 8. 3 mm / s, which can be used to determine its suitability for further exploitation. According to calculations conducted by an appropriate method the acceptable level of vibration above mentioned gear is 3. 1 mm / s. These valid values are in good agreement with the experimental values and have a lower level compared to the standard recommendations. According to conducted researches the curve of resource prediction for gear of pumping unit has been plotted. Thus, the expected service life of the gear RN - 2300 of pumping unit will be approximately 36 - 38 thousand hours. Dostępny również w formie drukowanej.

This paper shows a method of modeling the transition process during gear shifting in planetary gear trains. The simulation model is developed with in order to provide virtual research of planetary gear trains, which would positively decrease the number of real prototypes, thus considerably saving time and contributing to the quality improvement of the final product (planetary gear train) and vehicles in general. Introduction Modeling of gear shift processes has been carried out on the planetary gear type Ravigneaux used in planetary gear trains of motor vehicles. The model was developed modularly, so that more simulation models can be added to the whole. At the same time each subsystem is a model for itself and can be used independently from the main model. Simplified engine model Bearing in mind that, for the simulation of the planetary gear which {{is the subject of this}} paper, the necessary input parameters are in the form of engine torque Mm, angular velocity and motor ωm moment of inertia of rotating engine components reduced to the <b>input</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>gear,</b> a simplified model of an internal combustion engine has been formed. Model of external load External load resistance is in the form of the torque Mt occurring on the drive wheel of the vehicle. On the other hand, this load is defined by the moment of inertia of rotating elements from the planetary gear to the drive wheel, reduced to the output shaft. Model of friction transmission simulation Transmission power control in planetary gears is achieved through friction components. The output size of this subsystem is the moment of carrying the friction assembly. Simulation model of the planetary gear train The model simulation of the planetary gear type Ravigneaux was formed in accordance with the kinematic scheme of the gear train. The gears are presented as a solid body defined by mass, moment of inertia, position with respect to the system and the center of gravity. Subsystem for monitoring the simulation results Measuring and recording the simulation results are simulated with the simulation tracking subsystem. The simulation results are described through the torque and the angular velocity as a function of time. Analysis of the simulation model Forming a simulation model enables virtual testing of the planetary gear and the analysis of the impact of certain parameters on the behavior of the gear during gear changes. In other words, an opportunity has been created to examine the behavior of the model while simulating different conditions. Conclusion This paper presents the modeling of the gear change process in a planetary gear using computers in the Matlab / Simulink environment. Computer-aided modeling of the gear change process enables the generation of different versions of virtual gear models with relevant data about their characteristics thus helping designers in their decision making in the iterative process of design, i. e. in making appropriate decisions in the early stages of design...|$|E
