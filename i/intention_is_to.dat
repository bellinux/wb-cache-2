5|$|In {{recognition}} of the established and popular activity of mountain biking in the greater Adelaide area, and to better accommodate the mountain biking community in the north eastern suburbs, it was proposed in 2006 to permit cycling in designated zones on purpose-built tracks and on certain management tracks within the park. The <b>intention</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> satisfy both biodiversity and recreation objectives {{in the park and}} reducing the incidence of illegal mountain bike riding in other non designated areas.|$|E
5|$|The video {{features}} Beyoncé {{and her two}} companions dancing {{inside an}} infinity cove, which alternates {{between black and white}} and places the focus on the complex choreography. Throughout the video the women click their heels and shake their hips and legs. However, the main <b>intention</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> attract the viewers' attention toward their hands and ring fingers as they do the hand-twirl move. At one point during the video, the dancers run up to a wall, which, according to Frank Gatson Jr., pays homage to Shirley MacLaine's act in the 1969 film Sweet Charity. Toward the end of the video, Beyoncé flashes her own wedding ring on her finger.|$|E
5|$|Four middle-aged {{friends who}} {{have known each other}} since sixth form, Baxter (John Simm), Quinn (Philip Glenister), Rick (Marc Warren) and Woody (Max Beesley), get {{together}} for a holiday in Majorca at the villa of Alvo (Ben Chaplin), a mutual friend who became wealthy in the property business. Over time Alvo's behaviour becomes increasingly erratic, and he is later killed by a man in a Tony Blair mask for taking a drug boat the group used earlier. The four clean the boat to remove evidence of their presence, when they are mistaken for drug dealers and paid three million euros. Afterwards, the four learn from María (María Botto), a local detective, that they are caught up in a Serbian mafia drug smuggling operation. Using video camera footage of their holiday, Baxter learns the real perpetrators are corrupt police officers, including María and her superior Dominic (Tim Woodward). Alvo is revealed {{to be a part of}} the operation, and was murdered when he no longer wanted to take part in it. María later attempts to kill the four when employing scare tactics to make them part with the cash fails to work, but is shot to death by Quinn. The other three run over Dominic to save Quinn. They leave with the money and accidentally board a ferry to Ibiza (their <b>intention</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> go to Barcelona).|$|E

It can be seen in the subtle use of naturally occurring plants throughout the park. Non-native species planted for the sake of their own uniqueness defeat the purpose of design, as that very uniqueness draws attention to itself where the <b>intention</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> enable relaxation: utility above all else.|$|E

Operators can then install pollution control equipment, and sell portions of their emissions allowances they no longer need for their own operations, thereby recovering some of the capital cost of their investment in such equipment. The <b>intention</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> give operators economic incentives to install pollution controls.|$|E
25|$|The Bicentennial Tramway {{runs through}} the city of Rosario with two {{different}} routes {{and a total of}} 19 stops. Rosario got its first trams in 1906, however after they closed in 1962 much of the track was covered in tarmac, so the vintage units have been converted to run on rubber tires. In June 2015, a heritage tram began running on rails using one of the original trams from the restored network; the <b>intention</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> provide more heritage services and restore more trams.|$|E
25|$|Continuous {{blending}} is {{the process}} of adding the component gases of the mixture together as a continuous process and then compressing the mixture into a storage cylinder. The <b>intention</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> supply the component gases to the intake of the compressor in a continuous flow at a pressure suited to the compressor design, already mixed to the correct specification. This generally requires equipment to monitor and control the flow of the input gases, which are usually supplied from high-pressure storage cylinders, excepting for air which is normally taken from the ambient surroundings.|$|E

In October 2015, after two months of public voting, the black cab topped the list of favourite London transport icons, which also included the original Routemaster bus and the Tube map, among others. In 2016, the programme is holding exhibitions, walks and a festival at Regent Street on 3 July.|$|E

5000|$|The {{question}} <b>is</b> if the <b>intention</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> {{impose a}} punishment or [...] "civil proceedings". If the <b>intention</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> punish, that ends the inquiry. If the <b>intention</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> enact a regulatory scheme that is civil and nonpunitive, the Court must examine whether the scheme is so punitive as to negate the State's intention to deem it civil. Because the Court ordinarily defers to the legislature's stated intent, only the clearest proof will suffice to override that intent and transform {{what has been}} denominated a civil remedy into a criminal penalty. The Court decided 6-3 that the legislature's intent <b>was</b> <b>to</b> create a civil, nonpunitive program {{to protect the public}} and that the resulting dissemination of the registration information was not significant enough to declare as debilitating.|$|R

He and the Delta Force team under his command would kill anyone who is a threat to his plan, even Marjorie Tench, the president's adviser, who once had disagreed with him. Pickering is sucked into a vortex.|$|E
25|$|Associated {{with the}} formula is an {{extremely}} comprehensive set of rules. The rules can be classified into two main areas: rules concerning safety and rules to ensure competitive racing. For example, the maximum total area of all cockpits is specified to minimise {{the chance of a}} boat being swamped in rougher seas. Structural requirements are specified to ensure that strength is not sacrificed by the need to get weight low down in the keel. Materials are specified plus numerous other details concerning all aspects of the boat. The <b>intention</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> challenge designers but ensure competitive racing.|$|E

25|$|Because of the unorthodox {{nature of}} hand and body position, {{it is often}} {{difficult}} to get a lot of power behind a reverse sweep; in many situations, the <b>intention</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> glance or cut the ball to the backward leg area. However, in rare occasions, players have been able to execute reverse sweeps for a six. Kevin Pietersen, who pioneered switch hitting, is adept at this, but one could argue that the resulting shot is basically a sweep rather than a reverse sweep. A more classic example of such a shot would be Yusuf Pathan's six off Robin Peterson. South Africa's AB de Villiers is well known for his ability to hit sixes with the reverse sweep at ease and Glenn Maxwell also often plays reverse sweep.|$|E
25|$|Multimodal imaging {{frequently}} {{consists of}} the coupling of an electrophysiologic measurement technique, such as EEG or MEG, with a hemodynamic one such as fMRI or PET. While the <b>intention</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> use the strengths and limitations of each to complement the other, current approaches suffer from experimental limitations. Some previous work has focused on attempting to use the high spatial resolution of fMRI to determine the (spatial) origin of EEG/MEG signals, so that in future work this spatial information could be extracted from a unimodal EEG/MEG signal. While some studies have seen success in correlating signal origins between modalities to within a few millimeters, the results have not been uniformly positive. Another current limitation is the actual experimental setup: taking measurements using both modalities at once yields inferior signals, but the alternative of measuring each modality separately is confounded by trial-to-trial variability.|$|E
25|$|Intimidatory or {{aggressive}} bowling {{is a legitimate}} tactic of bowling {{with the intent of}} hitting the batsman with the ball. This is somewhat restrained by some of the laws of cricket, including those that disallow excessive use of bouncers and any use of the beamer, which is aimed directly at the head on the full. Successful intimidatory bowling usually employs a mixture of bouncers and short-pitched deliveries aimed at the batsman's head, chest, and rib cage. The <b>intention</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> disrupt a batsman's focus, and ultimately induce a mistake that leads to the loss of the batsman's wicket. Often the eventual wicket will not fall to a bouncer or short-pitched ball, but instead to a more standard delivery that the batsman is no longer expecting, or is rendered temporarily unable to play in his usual way (by fear, pain, surprise, or some combination of the three).|$|E
