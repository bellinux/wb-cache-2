40|$|In {{order to}} clarify the {{relationship}} between hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and integration of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA into the host <b>hepatocyte</b> <b>genome,</b> the states of HBV DNA in 14 cases of HCC, 3 cases of chronic hepatitis, 2 cases of metastatic hepatic carcinoma and 4 normal livers were examined by the Southern blot hybridization technique. All 3 cases of HCC positive for serum HBsAg had both free and integrated HBV DNA. Integration of HBV DNA without free HBV DNA was detected in 2 cut of 4 HCC cases negative for serum HBsAg but positive {{for more than one}} of the HBV-related antibodies. Only free HBV DNA was observed in all 3 cases of chronic hepatitis positive for serum HBsAg. The remaining cases had no HBV DNA in their liver tissues...|$|E

40|$|Chronic {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) {{infection is}} the primary risk factor {{for the development of}} hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide. After decades of chronic hepatitis, about 30 - 40 % of patients progress into liver cirrhosis, and of them, around 1 - 5 % subsequently develop hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) annually. Since the carcinogenic process involves the interplay between the hepatitis virus and the host <b>hepatocytes,</b> both <b>genomes</b> contribute to the final pathogenic outcome, either individually or synergistically. Studying the genetic factors predisposing hepatocarcinogenesis in both host and viral genomes will help illuminate the critical carcinogenic mechanisms, and create molecular targets for future therapy. In this article, we thus review the epidemiology of HBV-related HCC and viral factors involved in hepatocarcinogenesis...|$|R
25|$|Within {{the liver}} <b>hepatocytes,</b> the RNA <b>genome</b> is {{released}} from the protein coat and is translated by the cell's own ribosomes. Unlike other picornaviruses, this virus requires an intact eukaryote initiating factor 4G (eIF4G) for the initiation of translation. The requirement for this factor results in an inability to shut down host protein synthesis, unlike other picornaviruses. The virus must then inefficiently compete for the cellular translational machinery which may explain its poor growth in cell culture. Presumably for this reason, the virus has strategically adopted a naturally highly deoptimized codon usage with respect to that of its cellular host. Precisely how this strategy works is not quite clear yet.|$|R
40|$|Delta {{hepatitis}} {{virus is}} a new human pathogen always found associated with hepatitis B virus (HBV) causing both fulminant hepatitis and the accelerated progression of pre-existing HBV hepatitis. The virus is coated in HBsAg and contains circular single stranded RNA genome with very high intramolecular base-pairing, similar to the genomes of plant viroids, and the HDV antigen, a specific marker of HDV infection {{also found in the}} nuclei of infected <b>hepatocytes.</b> The <b>genome</b> is about 1700 nucleotides long and of minus polarity with a major constant antigenomic Open Reading Frame (ORF) which codes for the antigen. Replication of viral RNA appears to proceed by a rolling circle mechanism and specific self-cleavage and self-ligation of both genomic and antigenomic HDV RNA strands has been demonstrated in vitro. HDV appears to require HBsAg for its propagation and hepatotropism but not to depend on H BV for replication. In 1977 Rizzetto et al. 1 reported the observation of a new viral antigen present in the nuclei of hepatocytes in patients infected with hepatitis B virus. Subsequent studies confirmed the original observation and revealed that the new antigen was related to a new agent, later termed hepatitis delta virus or HDV. DELTA HEPATITIS Natural history and epidemiology The new defective virus has an RNA genome, is coated in hepatitis B virus surface antigen and is dependent on pre-existing or concomitant HBV infection for propagation. 2 In the former case...|$|R
40|$|Hepatitis B virus (HBV) {{serological}} markers {{were investigated}} in 40 incident cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) {{and in two}} age and sex matched control groups, comprising 40 patients with other cancers and 80 healthy individuals, resident in Bahia, Brazil. Serologic tests were done by radioimmunoassay. The study observed high proportion of seropositivity to HBsAg (42. 5 %) and of those presenting HBsAg or antiHBc (65. 0 %) among HCC cases, higher in men than women and in those aged 17 to 30 years old. HBsAg seropositivity among HCC patients was greater than {{in the control group}} with other cancers (7. 5 %) and in healthy controls (2. 5 %), corresponding to odds ratio estimates of 15. 0 (95 % CI 3. 29, 68. 30) and 33. 0 (95 % CI 9. 13, 119. 28), both statistically significant. HBeAg was not observed and antiHBe was present in 41. 2 % of cases, suggesting the absence of viral replication, possibly with viral DNA intergration into the <b>hepatocyte</b> <b>genome.</b> The presence of cirrhosis was associated with HBsAg seropositivity among HCC cases. A history of chronic alcoholism is shown to be more frequently related to those cases with cirrhosis. This study highlights the relevant association between HCC and HBV in Northeast Brazil, particularly for young individuals, and the high risk of development of HCC for HBsAg carriers...|$|E
40|$|Liver-targeted {{gene therapy}} based on {{recombinant}} adeno-associated viral vectors (rAAV) shows promising therapeutic efficacy in animal models and adult-focused clinical trials. This promise, however, {{is not directly}} translatable to the growing liver, where high rates of hepatocellular proliferation are accompanied by loss of episomal rAAV genomes and subsequently a loss in therapeutic efficacy. We have developed a hybrid rAAV/piggyBac transposon vector system combining the highly efficient liver-targeting properties of rAAV with stable piggyBac-mediated transposition of the transgene into the <b>hepatocyte</b> <b>genome.</b> Transposition efficiency was first tested using an enhanced green fluorescent protein expression cassette following delivery to newborn wild-type mice, with a 20 -fold increase in stably gene-modified hepatocytes observed 4 weeks posttreatment compared to traditional rAAV gene delivery. We next modeled the therapeutic potential of the system {{in the context of}} severe urea cycle defects. A single treatment in the perinatal period was sufficient to confer robust and stable phenotype correction in the ornithine transcarbamylase-deficient Spf(ash) mouse and the neonatal lethal argininosuccinate synthetase knockout mouse. Finally, transposon integration patterns were analyzed, revealing 127, 386 unique integration sites which conformed to previously published piggyBac data. CONCLUSION: Using a hybrid rAAV/piggyBac transposon vector system, we achieved stable therapeutic protection in two urea cycle defect mouse models; a clinically conceivable early application of this technology in the management of severe urea cycle defects could be as a bridging therapy while awaiting liver transplantation; further improvement of the system will result from the development of highly human liver-tropic capsids, the use of alternative strategies to achieve transient transposase expression, and engineered refinements in the safety profile of piggyBac transposase-mediated integration. 12 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Abstract__ The {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) is a DNA {{virus that}} belongs to the group ofhepadnaviridae. The partially double-stranded DNA contains 4 open reading frames, encoding for the envelope (pre-S/ S), core (precore/ core), polymerase and X proteins. The pre-S/S open reading frame encodes for the large, middle and small surface glycoproteins. The precore/ core region encodes for both the nucleocapsid protein (hepatitis B core antigen) and a soluble protein, the hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg). After attachment of HBV to the <b>hepatocyte,</b> the viral <b>genome</b> is converted into covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) within the hepatocyte nucleus (Figure 1). This cccDNA serves as template for the pregenomic mRNA. In the hepatocyte cytoplasm viral particles are assembled from HBV core protein, HBV DNA polymerase and the pregenomic mRNA. Within these particles the pregenomic mRNA is reverse transcribed by the HBV DNA polymerase into the minus strand HBV DNA. Finally the plus strand DNA is synthesized by the HBV DNA polymerase. There are seven major HBV genotypes (A to G), prevailing {{in different parts of}} the world. Recently another genotype, genotype H, was found in central America...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) {{transgenic mouse}} containing a naturally occurring mutation in the nucleocapsid promoter (A 1764 T plus G 1766 A) that inhibits the retinoid X receptor α (RXRα) plus peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) heterodimer from binding to the proximal nuclear hormone receptor recognition sequence has been generated. Viral transcription and replication {{occur in the}} liver and kidney. The nucleocapsid promoter mutation does not prevent peroxisome proliferators from increasing viral transcription and replication in the liver of these variant HBV transgenic mice. This suggests that peroxisome proliferators may enhance viral transcription directly in a PPARα-dependent manner through the nuclear hormone receptor recognition site in the enhancer 1 region of the HBV <b>genome.</b> <b>Hepatocyte</b> nuclear factor 4 (HNF 4) binding to the proximal nuclear hormone receptor recognition sequence in the nucleocapsid promoter appears to limit RNA synthesis from the precore transcription initiation site. Consequently, the variant HBV transgenic mice transcribe very little precore RNA and secrete extremely low levels of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) compared with the wild-type HBV transgenic mice. This {{is consistent with the}} suggestion that viruses expressing HBeAg are preferentially eliminated in infected individuals when they seroconvert from HBeAg positive to anti-HBe antibody-positive status, leaving escape HBV variants that have reduced HBeAg expression...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{systemic}} {{delivery of}} [E 1 −] adenoviral (Ad) vectors encoding a transgene results in efficient viral uptake and abundant transgene {{expression in the}} liver. However, [E 1 −]Ad vector persistence is transient due to cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) -mediated loss of the Ad-infected cells. Our laboratory has previously demonstrated that additional modifications to the [E 1 −]Ad vector genome, by deletion of the Ad E 2 b genes, significantly decreased virus-genome-derived gene expression and simultaneously improved the long-term performance of the resultant [E 1 −, E 2 b−]Ad vector. In this study, we confirmed that [E 1 −, E 2 b−]Ad vector genomes could persist equally well in C 57 Bl/ 6 or Balb/c mouse <b>hepatocytes.</b> Despite vector <b>genome</b> persistence, we observed a strain-dependent variability in the duration of CMV enhancer/promoter-driven transgene expression in the liver. While Balb/c mice rapidly shut down [E 1 −, E 2 b−]Ad-derived transgene expression, C 57 Bl/ 6 mice allowed for prolonged transgene expression. This occurred even when both strains were crossed into a severe combined immune-deficient background, demonstrating that host adaptive immune responses {{are not responsible for}} the phenomenon. Furthermore, differential methylation of the CMV enhancer/promoter was also not demonstrated in either strain of mouse, eliminating this mechanism as causative. Thus, alternative mechanisms for this phenomenon are discussed...|$|R

Understanding the toxic mechanism and biotransformation process of T- 2 toxin at a cellular level {{is essential for the}} development of countermeasures. We investigated the effect of T- 2 toxin in porcine primary <b>hepatocytes</b> using porcine <b>genome</b> array and two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization tandem time of flight mass spectrometry. Integrated transcriptional and proteomic analysis demonstrated that T- 2 toxin adversely affected porcine hepatocytes by initiating lipid metabolism disorder, oxidative stress response, and apoptosis. In addition, xenobiotic metabolism genes, including cytochrome P 450 3 As (CYP 3 A 46 and CYP 3 A 39), carboxylesterase 1 Cs (CES 1 C 4 and CES 1 C 5), and epoxide hydrolase (EPHX 1), increased in T- 2 toxin treatment cells. Using HepG 2 cells to over-express the recombinant xenobiotic metabolism genes above and rapid resolution liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry to detect metabolites of T- 2 toxin, we determined that porcine CYP 3 A 46 mainly catalyzed T- 2 to form 3 '-hydroxy-T- 2, which was further confirmed by purified CYP 3 A 46 protein. However, recombinant porcine CES 1 C 5 and EPHX 1 did not enhance hydrolysis and de-epoxidation of T- 2 implying that other esterases and epoxide hydrolases may play dominant roles in those reactions.

40|$|Adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors show great {{potential}} for therapeutic gene delivery for monogenic diseases, including hemophilia. Major limitations of this approach are the inability to persist in dividing cells and the restrictive packaging capacity of AAV. Gene targeting, {{the ability to make}} site-directed changes to the genome, has been a powerful tool for genetic discovery. Until recently, the low efficiency of targeting has rendered it unlikely to be of therapeutic value for most genetic diseases. Zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) are engineered proteins capable of site-directed DNA cleavage, known to increase the efficiency of gene targeting. Our lab has previously demonstrated in vivo gene targeting of the liver using AAV to deliver ZFNs and therapeutic donor in neonatal mice, where the rapid proliferation of <b>hepatocytes</b> may promote <b>genome</b> editing through homology directed repair (HDR). It was unknown whether the success of this approach could be replicated in adult mice (with predominantly quiescent hepatocytes, unlikely to be amenable to HDR). We hypothesized that in the absence of HDR, the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway may promote gene targeting in adult mice. Indeed, homology independent vector integration was sufficient to drive robust expression of clotting factor IX, deficient in hemophilia B, and correct the disease phenotype in mice treated as adults. This approach was adapted to create a general platform for liver-directed protein replacement therapy. Using ZFNs targeting the mouse albumin locus, we achieved long-term therapeutic expression of human factors VIII and IX in mouse models of hemophilia A and B as well as four different therapeutic enzymes deficient in lysosomal storage disorders. To test our hypothesis that in vivo genome editing relies on different DNA repair mechanisms in neonatal and adult mice, we applied multiple techniques including a novel reporter construct, southern blot, comparisons of donors with and without arms of homology, and a mouse model of NHEJ deficiency. These data indicate HDR is the primary mechanism of genome editing in neonatal mouse livers, and dispensable for therapeutically relevant levels of genome editing in adult mice. These results have implications in designing safer and more efficacious genome editing therapies. ...|$|R
