40|$|The {{principle}} {{objective of}} this study is to examine how penal codification was received and interpreted by the media. The media sources to be used are English newspapers and professional legal English Journals. With respect to the legal journals three journals were selected (two from Ontario, one from Quebec where they already experienced codification). The period examined is <b>from</b> <b>each</b> <b>journal's</b> founding date until 1900. Therefore, the examination of the Legal News was from 1886 - 1900, the Canada Law Journal was from 1855 - 1900, and the Canadian Law Times was from 1881 - 1900. It should be noted that the Canada Law Journal was the successor of the Upper Canada Law Journal beginning in 1868. The three newspapers examined for this study representing either the conservative, liberal or radical label were: The Montreal Gazette (conservative), The Toronto Globe (liberal) and The Toronto Mail (radical). The period examined was 1886 - 1893 for the two former newspapers and 1890, 1891 and 1892 for the latter newspaper. All articles relating to the criminal law, the criminal code and codification were analyzed for both sources of data. In examining what opinions were expressed this study attempted to establish whether the focus was on codification or specific topics of the code as well as whether the reactions to the code, if any, changed after its inception.

40|$|Abstract Introduction The STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational {{studies in}} Epidemiology (STROBE) Statement was {{developed}} in response to inadequate reporting of observational studies. In recent years, several extensions to STROBE have been created to provide more nuanced field-specific guidance for authors. The content and the prevalence of extension endorsement {{have not yet been}} assessed. Accordingly, there are two aims: (1) to classify changes made in the extensions to identify strengths and weaknesses of the original STROBE checklist and (2) to determine the prevalence and typology of endorsement by journals in fields related to extensions. Methods and analysis Two independent researchers will assess additions in each extension. Additions will be coded as ‘field specific’ (FS) or ‘not field specific’ (NFS). FS is defined as particularly relevant information for a single field and guidance provided generally cannot be extrapolated beyond that field. NFS is defined as information that reflects epidemiological or methodological tenets and can be generalised to most, if not all, types of observational research studies. Intraclass correlation will be calculated to measure reviewers’ concordance. On disagreement, consensus will be sought. Individual additions will be grouped by STROBE checklist items to identify the frequency and distribution of changes. Journals in fields related to extensions will be identified through National Library of Medicine PubMed Broad Subject Terms, screened for eligibility and further distilled via Ovid MEDLINE® search strategies for observational studies. Text describing endorsement will be extracted <b>from</b> <b>each</b> <b>journal’s</b> website. A classification scheme will be created for endorsement types and the prevalence of endorsement will be estimated. Analyses will use NVivo V. 11 and SAS University Edition.

40|$|Purpose - Publishers of some {{scientific}} journals and the ISO standard require or recommend specific {{information to be}} present in abstracts. However little is known whether this is what scientists give when they write abstracts. The structure of abstracts was tested in Czech, Slovenian and international {{scientific journals}} in the English language in the areas of library and information science and materials science. Design/methodology/approach - One hundred research paper abstracts were selected <b>from</b> <b>each</b> <b>journal,</b> and content analysis was performed both manually and using Weft QDA qualitative analysis software. Findings - The results show that neither the ISO nor the Emerald structure is entirely appropriate. Abstracts in IS usually have this structure: Ikaros (CZ) : background, purpose of the research projectKnjižnica(SI) : background, results only indicatedJournal of Documentation: results, methods, and purpose. In MS, the abstracts usually report on: Czech MS journals: background, methods, resultsMateriali in Tehnologije (SI) : methods, backgroundMaterials Science and Technology (international) : methods, results. The differences can in part be attributed to the varying disciplines and to the different roles of journals in professional societies, to cultural differences in perception of the role of abstracts.

40|$|Background: Excessive {{protocol}} violations (PV), {{which can}} be defined as preventable mistakes in study conduct, may result in patient harm and introduce errors into a clinical trial’s results leading to flawed trial conclusions. The purpose of this project was {{to gain a better understanding}} of reported PVs, to describe current practice with regards to the use of methods for the reduction of PVs and to investigate relationships between clinical trial characteristics and PVs. Methods: We reviewed 80 clinical trials conducted across a broad range of medical specialties published in four major general medical journals (The Lancet, NEJM, JAMA, BMJ). Eligible papers were identified using a PubMed search. For each included trial, two authors independently abstracted information on trial characteristics, PV reporting and PV rates and interventions used to reduce PVs. PVs were categorised into one of five distinct types: enrolment, randomisation, study intervention, patient compliance and data collection errors. Associations between PVs and study characteristics were investigated using logistic regression. Results: Eighty clinical trials (20 <b>from</b> <b>each</b> <b>journal)</b> were identified from 101 consecutive PubMed abstracts.

With the ACGME/AOA merger, we sought to evaluate the frequency of publication in high-impact peer-reviewed EM journals from authors affiliated with osteopathic emergency medicine (EM) programs. Methods: We performed a retrospective literature review using the Journal Citation Report database and identified the top five journals {{in the category of}} 'Emergency Medicine' by their 2011 Impact Factor. We examined all publications <b>from</b> <b>each</b> <b>journal</b> for 2011. For each article we recorded article type, authors' names, position of authorship (first, senior or other). Results: The 2011 EM journals with the highest impact factor were the following: Annals of Emergency Medicine, Resuscitation, Journal of Trauma, Injury, and Academic Emergency Medicine. Of the 9, 298 authors published in these journals in 2011; 1, 309 (15 %) claimed affiliation with U.

These grades were accumulated for each department {{to provide an}} overall quality profile {{in terms of the}} proportions of its outputs in each category. The assessments of individual papers were not made public but the papers submitted by each department were. This data provides a major opportunity for addressing issues of concern about the evaluation of research and the effects of journal rankings, as well as the possibility of reconstructing the judgements made by the Panel about journal quality.

Then, we reviewed the current practice of reporting these methodological aspects of SA in clinical trials in four leading journals, i. e., the New England Journal of Medicine, the Journal of the American Medical Association, the Lancet, and the American Journal of Public Health. Eight consecutive reports <b>from</b> <b>each</b> <b>journal</b> published after July 1, 1998 were included. Of the 32 trials surveyed, 17 (53 %) had at least one SA.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the reference and quotation accuracy in four peer-reviewed manual therapy journals. A stratified random sample of original research (n= 7) was collected from each of the journals spanning the years January 2000 to December 2001. A further random selection of 80 references <b>from</b> <b>each</b> <b>journal</b> paper sampled was then reviewed (Total N= 320) for citation and quotation accuracy. Numbers of citations with errors were determined, then classified as either major or minor and categorized by bibliographic headings (author, title, journal, year, volume, page and irretrievable). Each quotation was individually assessed for accuracy and judged to be either correct or incorrect. A quotation was deemed correct if it accurately substantiated and reported the original authors assertions. One hundred and fifteen citations across all journals contained errors (35. 9 %). Some citations exhibited multiple major and minor errors. Bibliographically classified errors for all journals showed 61 author, 51 title, 6 journal, 4 year, 12 volume and 25 page errors.

40|$|We {{characterized}} {{the influence of}} androstenedione, 5 -alpha-dihydrotestosterone and 17 -beta-estradiol on the chromatin organization and the cell kinetics (distribution of the cells into the G 0 -G 1, S and G 2 + M fractions) of MXT mouse mammary tumors grafted onto animals that were left intact or that were oophorectomized and/or treated with aminoglutethimide. The cell kinetics and chromatin pattern were monitored by analyzing Feulgen-stained MXT imprint smears through a cell image processor, the SAMBA 200 system. We have also assayed the estrogen and progesterone receptors of these MXT tumors, which appeared to possess both of these biological markers. Our results show that ovariectomy or aminoglutethimide treatment slowed down the MXT tumor growth without any additive effect between them. Androstenedione exerted a stimulating influence on the cell kinetics, which were {{very similar to those}} observed after estradiol administration; the treatment of castrated animals with aminoglutethimide completely abolished this androstenedione-induced stimulating influence, however. This androgen lacked any apparent efficiency to transform cell nuclei from a state of castration-induced chromatin condensation into a thinly textured and decondensed state, as did estradiol. Dihydrotestosterone was able to activate the cell kinetics of MXT tumor grafted onto castrated animals {{as well as those of}} MXT neoplasms grafted on oophorectomized mice treated with aminoglutethimide. Dihydrotestosterone also possesses the property to transform condensed chromatin into decondensed chromatin. It thus appeared that androstenedione and dihydrotestosterone could activate MXT cell proliferation, as did estradiol, although it appeared that their mechanisms of action were quite distinct <b>from</b> <b>each</b> other. <b>Journal</b> ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.

Methodologically, this mixed methods study uses historical analysis, genre analysis, and an interview study to investigate reviews and their functions in the field of composition. A corpus of 90 reviews, 45 <b>from</b> <b>each</b> <b>journal,</b> was analyzed from 1939 to 2007, to study how reviews reflect the disciplinary trajectory of composition studies, the genre trends of reviews as they reflect the development of changing research and scholarship in composition, and the editorial perspectives and contextualization of the review genre and the development of reviews in the field. The research finds that historically, reviews prove to reflect the development of the field over time; that textually, the review genre displays four moves, describing, evaluating, situating, and theorizing; and that professionally, the editors contextualize the reviews as an important contributor to the scholarship of the discipline. The main findings include a genre shift from short reviews and book reviews to the review essay. The shift is a move from a focus on description and evaluation to a focus on situating the review and the books within composition studies and using the review as a launching point for further disciplinary theorization. The findings also indicate that while reviews are not a primary genre in the field, they do reflect and contribute to the historical publication record of composition in its development as an academic discipline...|$|E

The median study duration was 24 months (range: 5. 81 - 127 months) and 74 % (59 / 80) of included trials were primarily academic funded. Thirty two percent (26 / 80) of included trials failed to provide explicit reporting of any type of PV and none (0 / 80) of the trials provided explicit reporting of all five types of PVs. Larger clinical trials (more patients, more sites, longer duration, more complex management structure) were more likely to have more complete reporting of PV's. Only 9 % (7 / 80) of trials reported the use of a specific study method to prevent PVs. Use of a run-in phase was the only method reported. Conclusions PVs are under-reported. Although the CONSORT statement provides guidance on the reporting of PVs, reporting requirements are not explicit for all types of PVs. As a first step towards improved reporting by authors, we recommend the CONSORT statement highlight the importance of PVs by making reporting requirements more explicit. </p...|$|E
40|$|Some rhetorical and discursive {{features}} of spanish dental academic writing: an exploratory study. (Morales, Oscar Alberto y Cassany, Daniel) Resumen We will describe some typical rhetorical and discursive {{features of}} the Spanish Dental Academic Writing (SDAW), which have not been studied yet. We analyzed three different genre of four leading Hispanic dental journals (Spanish, Venezuelan and Cuban) published between January 1989 and December 2005 : 10 review articles (RA), 10 case reports (CR) and 10 research papers (RP) <b>from</b> <b>each</b> <b>journal,</b> which sum up 120 texts. Using Swales’ genre analysis model, we analyzed the rhetorical structures, the moves of the rhetorical sections, the physical components and the hedging devices used in each genre. We also compared our results with some studies carried out in English medical discourse. We found that even though SDAW has some common features with the discourse of other academic and professional communities, such as medicine, it has some particular features, rhetorical moves and communicative functions. The prototypical rhetorical organizations found were: In the RA, introductiondevelopment-conclusion; its moves coincide partially with Swales’ CARS model, Mulrow’s criteria, Myers’s and Noguchi’s findings. In the CR, a three-section structure predominated: introduction-case presentationdiscussion/conclusion. Its moves coincided in some way with those Taavitsainen & Pahta, Jenicek and Uribarri found in medical CR. Finally, RP followed predominantly the IMRDC format. Some of its moves {{were similar to those}} reported for medical RP (Swales, Day, Huth, Nwogu, Williams, and Hopkins & Dudley-Evans). Finally, we found that hedging is a common semantic-pragmatic strategy used in the SDAW, among those shields; approximators and impersonal constructions reported a high frequency, which coincide with Salager-Meyer. We also found deictics and compound hedges. We conclude that the characteristics of the SDAW, its communicative functions and the position of the authors could condition the writing of the different genres. Moreover, the expectations of members of the Dental community associated with academic writing could determine the way authors present their propositions, and their stances. Results could have didactic implications for teaching SDAW. We consider that it should be based on the empirical evidence: the way dentists (clinicians, researchers and professors) produce and interpret discourse in professional and academic settings.
