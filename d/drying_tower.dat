50|$|This {{includes}} the dusting tower, cooling pipes, scrubbers, <b>drying</b> <b>tower,</b> arsenic purifier and testing box. Sulphur dioxide has many impurities such as vapours, dust particles and arsenous oxide. Therefore, {{it must be}} purified to avoid catalyst poisoning (i.e.: destroying catalytic activity and loss of efficiency). In this process, the gas is washed with water, and dried by sulphuric acid. In the dusting tower, the sulphur dioxide is exposed to a steam which removes the dust particles. After the gas is cooled, the sulphur dioxide enters the washing tower where it is sprayed by water to remove any soluble impurities. In the <b>drying</b> <b>tower,</b> sulphuric acid is sprayed on the gas to remove the moisture from it. Finally, arsenic oxide is removed when the gas is exposed to ferric hydroxide.|$|E

40|$|Cooling {{tower is}} an {{integrated}} {{part of any}} geothermal power plant because waste heat from turbine exhaust steam must be continuously rejected to make the plants operate.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new concept}} of hybrid cooling, named solar enhanced natural draft <b>dry</b> cooling <b>tower</b> (SENDDCT), in which solar collectors are added to traditional natural draft <b>dry</b> cooling <b>towers</b> to increase their performance. The purpose of using solar energy in this new cooling system {{is to increase the}} suction through the tower so that more air flow is achieved through the compact heat exchangers that cool condensers of a geothermal power plant. For the same size of the cooling tower, more air flow across the heat exchangers means more heat can be rejected by the system. The governing equations for the SENDDCT {{are similar to those of}} a conventional natural draft <b>dry</b> cooling <b>tower</b> except that solar heating is added after the heat exchanger bundles. Performance comparisons show that SENDDCT has substantial advantages over conventional natural draft <b>dry</b> cooling <b>towers</b> for geothermal power plants as well as standalone solar chimney power plants...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{projected}} shortage of water supply for evaporative cooling in electric power industry {{by the end}} of this century, Thus, dry and wet/dry cooling tower systems are going to be the solution for this problem. This study has determined the cost of dry cooling compared to the conventional cooling methods. Also, the savings by using wet/dry instead of all-dry cooling has been determined. A total optimization has been performed for power plants with <b>dry</b> cooling <b>tower</b> systems using metal-finned-tube heat exchangers and surface condensers. The optimization minimizes the power production cost. The program does not use pre-designed heat exchanger modules. Rather, it optimizes the heat exchanger and its air and water flow rates. In the base case study, the-method of replacing lost capacity assumes the use of gas turbines. As a result of using <b>dry</b> cooling <b>towers</b> in an 800 MWe fossil plant, the incremental costs with the use of high back pressure turbine and conventional turbine over all-wet cooling are 11 % and 15 %, respectively. For a 1200 MWe nuclear plant, these are 22 % and 25 %, respectively. Since the method of making up lost capacity depends on the situation of a utility, considerable effort has been placed on testing the effects of using different methods of replacing lost capacity at high ambient temperatures by purchased energy. The results indicate that the optimization is very sensitive to the method of making up lost capacity. It is, there- fore, important to do an accurate representation of all possible methods of making up capacity loss when optimizating power plants with <b>dry</b> cooling <b>towers.</b> A solution for the problem of losing generation capability by a power plant due to the use of a <b>dry</b> cooling <b>tower</b> is to supplement the <b>dry</b> <b>tower</b> during the hours of peak ambient temperatures by a wet tower. A separate wet/dry cooling tower system with series tower arrangement has been considered in this study. In this cooling system, the physical separation of the <b>dry</b> and wet <b>towers</b> protects the <b>dry</b> <b>tower</b> airside heat transfer surface from the corrosion problem. It also allows complete freedom of design and operation of the <b>dry</b> and wet <b>towers.</b> A wet/dry cooling system can be tailored to meet any amount of water available for cooling. The results of the optimization show that wet/dry cooling towers have significant savings over all-dry cooling, For example, in either fossil or nuclear plant, the <b>dry</b> <b>tower</b> heat transfer surface of 30 % makeup water wet/dry cooling system is only about fifty percent of that in all-dry cooling using high back pressure turbines. This results in a reduction of 27 % and 37 % of the incremental cost in the fossil and nuclear plant, respectively, over all-wet cooling. Even the availability of a small percentage of makeup water reduces the incremental cost significantly. Thus, wet/dry cooling is an economic choice over all-dry cooling where some water is available but supplies are insufficient for a totally evaporative cooling towers. On the other hand, the advantage of wet/dry cooling over evaporative towers is conservation of water consumption. Originally issued as the author's thesis (M. S.), M. I.

40|$|Solar Enhanced Natural Draft <b>Dry</b> Cooling <b>Tower</b> is a {{new concept}} of hybrid cooling, in which solar heat {{collection}} is added to traditional natural draft <b>dry</b> cooling <b>tower.</b> Adding a solarheated space to further heat the air after it leaves the heat exchangers increases the temperature difference between the {{inside and outside of}} tower, which leads to an increased air flow rate through the heat exchangers therefore better cooling performance. A one-dimensional model has been developed to predict its cooling performance by using MATLAB. The purpose of the present paper is to report on results of a detailed numerical analysis and to validate performance predictions from that onedimensional model.

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{research for}} the past year on methods to enhance the environmental and economic performance of <b>dry</b> cooling <b>towers.</b> The work has concentrated on <b>dry</b> cooling <b>towers</b> utilizing periodic water to air heat exchangers. Periodic towers have sheet metal discs partially submerged in hot, power plant condenser effluent. As the discs rotate, the discs alternately absorb heat from the effluent and discharge heat to the air. The means of heat transfer on the air side can be either evaporative and/or convective, depending upon the amount of effluent carried into the air side {{on the surface of the}} plates. An oil layer, floated on the water's surface, has been shown to be effective in eliminating water carry-over to the air side. The advantages of the periodic tower lie in the low cost of the discs and the ability to operate <b>dry.</b> A periodic <b>tower</b> should be significantly less expensive than a conventional <b>dry</b> <b>tower</b> fabricated with finned tubes. Further, since the periodic tower can also operate wet, by removing the oil film, the high capacity losses incurred during warm months by conventional <b>dry</b> <b>towers</b> can be eliminated. In the past year, tests on a 20 inch model of the periodic tower indicated that at operational speeds of the full sized disc, no noticeable churning of the oil layer ocurred. Heat transfer rates measured with the 20 inch model were 20 percent higher than predicted by an approximate analysis. Finally, silicone oils' low vapor pressure make them superior to hydrocarbon oils on the basis of evaporation rates, but their higher costs and possible ecological impact necessitates a closer look at hydrocarbon oils. Construction of the full scale test facility is complete. Shaped, rigid five foot diameter discs have been designed, fabricated, and assembled into an initial test module. Instrumentation for heat transfer tests is also complete; including instrumentation for measuring disc temperatures, and both air and water flow rates and temperatures. A parametric study of the oil film thickness on the air side of the test module has been completed. Measured thicknesses were 20 percent less than that previously predicted. This thinner oil layer means an increase in the disc heat transfer. A test apparatus to study the further enhancement of disc performance by surface roughening has been constructed, instrumented and calibrated. The apparatus has reproduced experimental friction factor and heat transfer coefficient curves for flat plates, and will be used to evaluate enhancement as a function of rib shape, size, spacings and Reynold's number. Visits to several architectural engineers across the country were made with representatives of Air Preheater Company to gage their acceptance of the rotary concept.
