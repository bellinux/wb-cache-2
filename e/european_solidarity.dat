5|$|Câmpineanu, who had {{proposed}} a reformist constitution {{to replace the}} Regulament entirely, was forced into exile, but remained an influence on a younger generation of activists, both Wallachian and Moldavian. The latter group, comprising many young boyars who had studied in France, also took direct inspiration from reformist or revolutionary-minded societies such as the Carbonari (and even, through Teodor Diamant, from Utopian socialism). It was this faction who would first explicitly publicize the demands for national independence and Moldo-Wallachian unification, which it included in a wider agenda of political reforms and <b>European</b> <b>solidarity.</b> Societatea Studenților Români (the Society of Romanian Students) was founded in 1846, having the French poet Alphonse de Lamartine for its honorary president.|$|E

50|$|The <b>European</b> Union <b>Solidarity</b> Fund (EUSF) {{was founded}} in 2002. Its {{objective}} is to provide assistance to European Union member states when large-scale disasters occur. Catastrophes {{are considered to be}} large-scale if the estimated direct cost of damage exceeds 3 billion euro or 0.6% of gross national income of the country concerned. Since its inception, the Fund has provided assistance to member states as a result of 56 disasters including earthquakes, forest fires, drought, storms and floods. According to a European Commission report, Italy and Germany have been the leading beneficiaries of these emergency funds, though in total 23 states have received support.|$|R
50|$|The European Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid Kristalina Georgieva {{stated that}} Croatia and Serbia have the {{possibility}} to apply for aid from the <b>European</b> Union <b>Solidarity</b> Fund, up to one billion euro in one year, but this was later rescinded as a misstatement of the Commissioner. The EU Solidarity Fund in 2014 is 500 million euros, while individual countries can expect around 10 million. The aid can be transferred if the damage is assessed to be over 0.64% of the country's GDP. For Serbia, that would be around 175 million euros in damages. Bosnia, not being a candidate or member country of the EU, is not eligible for aid from this fund.|$|R

40|$|Love {{is often}} {{a key factor in}} {{migration}} decisions. Partner relationships and union formation have also been identified as forming an intrinsic part of intra-European migration. Nevertheless, empirical research into intra-European love migration remains rather scarce. In this paper, we focus on the often neglected but substantial intra-European moves. We analyse the relationship between bi-national couple formation, identification as a European and <b>European</b> transnational <b>solidarity.</b> The analyses are based on the EUMARR survey, investigating bi-national marriages in a unified Europe, comparing European bi-national and uni-national couples. In this paper, we focus on the Netherlands (n¼ 898) and compare Dutch–Dutch with Dutch–EU couples. Our findings indicate that bi-national couples are more likely to identify as European compared to uni-national couples, but this is not reflected in more <b>solidarity</b> to <b>European</b> countries in times of crisis. Implications of these findings are discussed in light of the European integration process...|$|R
