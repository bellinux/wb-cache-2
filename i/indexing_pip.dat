40|$|The {{effect of}} {{increasing}} salinity {{on a range}} of chlorophyll fluorescence parameters in foliar tissue of 30 Acer genotypes was examined. The magnitude of the fluorescence responses differed among genotypes ranging from minor effects to substantial leaf tissue damage. Interpretation of the fluorescence expressions provided an insight into mechanisms of salt damage and resilience among genotypes. Based on reductions in a performance <b>index</b> (<b>PIp)</b> following salinity, genotypes were ranked in order from tolerant to sensitive. Based on this ranking criterion, marked differences in salt tolerance among genotypes were distinguished. It is concluded that chlorophyll fluorescence offers a rapid screening technique for assessing the foliar salinity tolerance of urban trees...|$|R

Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the association between periodontal disease and interleukin- 10 gene polymorphism in 66 elderly. Methods: PD was diagnosed using the <b>index</b> <b>PIP.</b> The genetic polymorphism was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction followed by cleavage with restriction enzyme Rsa I. Results: The study included 66 elderly (mean age: 68 ± 5. 02 years), 63. 3 % female gender and 36. 4 % male. The elderly harboring AA genotype or A allele were significantly associated with severe PD, according to c 2 test (p< 0. 05), suggesting that this genotype or allele may be a genetic factor leading to chronic susceptibility of PD. Conclusions: The genetic polymorphism at position - 627 of the IL- 10 gene may influence the PD severity in the elderly...|$|R
40|$|The Yermak Plateau {{is located}} north of Svalbard at the {{entrance}} to the Arctic Ocean, i. e. in an area highly sensitive to climate change. A multi proxy approach was carried out on Core PS 92 / 039 - 2 to study glacial-interglacial environmental changes at the northern Barents Sea margin during the last 160 ka. The main emphasis was on the reconstruction of sea ice cover, based on the sea ice proxy IP 25 and the related phytoplankton - sea ice <b>index</b> <b>PIP</b> 25. Sea ice was present most of the time but showed significant temporal variability decisively affected by movements of the Svalbard Barents Sea Ice Sheet. For the first time, we prove the occurrence of seasonal sea ice at the eastern Yermak Plateau during glacial intervals, probably steered by a major northward advance of the ice sheet and the formation of a coastal polynya in front of it. Maximum accumulation of terrigenous organic carbon, IP 25 and the phytoplankton biomarkers (brassicasterol, dinosterol, HBI III) can be correlated to distinct deglaciation events. More severe, but variable sea ice cover prevailed at the Yermak Plateau during interglacials. The general proximity to the sea ice margin is further indicated by biomarker (GDGT) - based sea surface temperatures below 2. 5 °C...|$|R
40|$|Contingency {{analysis}} {{technique is}} being widely {{used to predict}} the effect of outages in power systems, like failures of equipment, transmission line etc. The off line analysis to predict the effect of individual contingency is a tedious task as a power system contains large number of components. Practically, only selected contingencies will lead to severe conditions in power system like violation of voltage and active power flow limits. The process of identifying these severe contingencies is referred as contingency selection and {{this can be done}} by calculating performance indices for each contingencies. In this paper, the contingency selection by calculating two kinds of performance indices; active power performance <b>index</b> (<b>PIP)</b> and reactive power performance index (PIV) for single transmission line outage have been done with the help of Fast Decoupled Load Flow (FDLF) in MATLAB environment. The ranking of most severe contingency has been done based on the values of performance indices. Simultaneously the value of bus voltages and active power flow before and after the most severe transmission line contingency has been analyzed. The effectiveness of the method has been tested on 5 -Bus, IEEE- 14 Bus and IEEE- 30 Bus test systems. It {{can be seen from the}} results that, based on the knowledge of PIP & PIV the most severe transmission line contingency can be identified and the effect of this contingency on the rest of the system can also be seen via post contingency analysis...|$|R
40|$|During the Polarstern 1995 Expedition, a {{long-term}} mooring system with two cone-shaped multi-sampling traps was deployed at the dominantly ice-covered western {{slope of the}} southern Lomonosov Ridge (81 ° 04. 5 ’N, 138 ° 54. 0 ’E, 1712 m water depth). One trap was installed at 150 m below the sea surface, the other at 150 m above the bottom at 1550 m depth; material was collected in 20 time intervals between September 1995 and August 1996. For background data see Fahl and Nöthig (2007). Here, we present new biomarker data recording the seasonal variability of sea-ice cover. This type of data representing modern seasonal variability of the sea-ice biomarker proxies, was not available {{so far from the}} central Arctic Ocean but may help significantly the interpretation of these proxies to be used in sedimentary records for reconstruction of paleo-sea-ice distributions. In this study, we have focused on the novel sea ice proxy IP 25, a direct proxy for sea ice coverage (Belt et al., 2007). Furthermore, we used the phytoplankton-IP 25 <b>index</b> (<b>PIP</b> 25 <b>Index),</b> a further development of the IP 25 index, based on the coupling of the environmental information carried by IP 25 (sea ice) and brassicasterol (open-water phytoplankton productivity) (Müller et al., 2011). The interval November 1995 to June 1996 is characterized by the absence of the sea-ice proxy IP 25 (except very minor values for January and April), suggesting a predominantly permanent sea-ice cover at the trap location. During July/August 1996, maximum fluxes of the diatom-specific fatty acids and brassicasterol as well as maximum contents of biogenic opal (Fahl and Nöthig, 2007) indicate increased primary productivity. The marine organic matter (here POC, brassicasterol, and fatty acids) and the IP 25 values decrease systematically from 150 to 1550 m depth, indicating the typical biogeochemical degradation with increasing water depth. Due to the coincidence of maximum abundances of sea-ice proxies and open-ocean primary productivity proxies during the July/August time interval we propose a ice-edge situation characterized by increased phytoplankton productivity and sea-ice algae input. This interpretation is also supported by the phytoplankton-IP 25 <b>index</b> (<b>PIP</b> 25 <b>Index),</b> reaching quite high values of 0. 5 - 0. 8. It seems to be that in general PIP 25 values do not change significantly between the shallow and deep trap, i. e. with increasing water depth, an important observation when thinking about the interpretation of PIP 25 sedimentary records. The distinctly reduced September/October values of brassicasterol and fatty acids suggest a decrease in primary productivity, probably related to the start of new-ice formation in late September. This situation is reflected in high IP 25 values and high PIP 25 ratios. Whereas for October no IP 25 was determined in the shallow trap, medium-high IP 25 values were determined in the deep trap with maximum PIP 25 ratio of about 0. 7. This may indicate lateral IP 25 input, but also means that in this case the PIP 25 ratios should be interpreted with caution. References: Belt, S. T., Massé, G., Rowland, S.

40|$|Records of {{the spatial}} and {{temporal}} variability of Arctic Ocean sea ice are of significance for understanding {{the causes of the}} dramatic decrease in Arctic sea-ice cover of recent years. In this context, the newly developed sea-ice proxy IP 25, a mono-unsaturated highly branched isoprenoid alkene with 25 carbon atoms biosynthesized specifically by sea-ice associated diatoms and only found in Arctic and sub-Arctic marine sediments, has been used to reconstruct the recent spatial sea-ice distribution. The phytoplankton biomarkers 24 S-brassicasterol and dinosterol were determined alongside IP 25 to distinguish ice-free or permanent ice conditions, and to estimate the sea-ice conditions semi-quantitatively by means of the phytoplankton-IP 25 <b>index</b> (<b>PIP</b> 25). Within our study, {{for the first time a}} comprehensive data set of these biomarkers was produced using fresh and deep-frozen surface sediment samples from the Central Arctic Ocean proper (> 80 °N latitude) characterised by a permanent ice cover today and recently obtained surface sediment samples from the Chukchi Plateau/Basin partly covered by perennial sea ice. In addition, published and new data from other Arctic and sub-Arctic regions were added to generate overview distribution maps of IP 25 and phytoplankton biomarkers across major parts of the modern Arctic Ocean. These comprehensive biomarker data indicate perennial sea-ice cover in the Central Arctic, ice-free conditions in the Barents Sea and variable sea-ice situations in other marginal seas. The low but more than zero values of biomarkers in the Central Arctic supported the low in-situ productivity there. The <b>PIP</b> 25 <b>index</b> values reflect modern sea-ice conditions better than IP 25 alone and show a positive correlation with spring/summer sea ice. When calculating and interpreting <b>PIP</b> 25 <b>index</b> as a (semi-quantitative) proxy for reconstructions of present and past Arctic sea-ice conditions from different Arctic/sub-Arctic areas, information of the source of phytoplankton biomarkers and the possible presence of allochthonous biomarkers is needed, and the records of the individual biomarkers always should be considered as well...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Objective: To {{analyze the}} {{relationship}} between the oral health status and functional capacity in performing basic activities of daily living of a population of elderly persons. Method: A cross-sectional population-based study with 441 individuals aged 60 years or over both genders was performed in the municipality of Macaíba, Rio Grande do Norte. From intraoral epidemiological examination, the degree of caries attacks (CPO-D index), periodontal condition (CPI and <b>PIP</b> <b>indexes),</b> the use and need for dental prosthesis and the presence of oral lesions were evaluated. Independence in Activities of Daily Living was used to evaluate functional capacity. Socioeconomic and demographic characteristics were surveyed using a structured questionnaire. Results: Oral health variables were subjected to factor analysis, which resulted in four indicators. There was no association between these indicators and the functional capacity of the elderly. Gender, age, presence of caregiver, dominant area of residence, time of last visit to the dentist, type of care sought during such visit and self-perception regarding prosthesis replacement were significantly associated with oral health indicators. Conclusion: Given the non-identification of the effect of functional capacity on the oral health of the elderly, the time of measurement of the events investigated should be considered. It is suggested that dependency among the elderly occurs at different times from when the consequences of oral problems are observed, considering the cumulative effects of a previous history of invasive dental care...|$|R
40|$|Flexion of {{the index}} finger is a fairly complex process {{requiring}} the coordination of different joints. This study is the first attempt to investigate how the angular velocity profile of the three right <b>index</b> joints (DIP, <b>PIP,</b> and MCP) varies with respect to time {{during the course of}} flexion. Ten right-handed subjects (healthy college students between 21 and 23 years old) were recruited to participate in the experiment. Each of these human subjects was instructed to perform a flexion task with his/her right hand. Five miniaturized (5 -mm diameter) reflective markers were applied to each human subject: three placed at the DIP, PIP, and MCP joints {{of the index}} finger on the side close to thumb, and the rest at the predetermined landmarks on dorsum of thumb. A high-speed camera was used to record the motion of the index finger during a paced flexion, and the instantaneous angular velocity of each joint was determined by relating the marker displacement to the frame frequency (~ 5 ms between two consecutive frames). Opposite to the general belief that the speed is constant throughout a flexion cycle, to our best knowledge, this study, for the first time, has revealed that the speed of multi-joint movement actually varies with time. It has been identified that during one full flexion cycle, the angular velocity of the three joints of interest undergoes five distinguishable phases, referred as phases P 1 (slow), P 2 (fast), P 3 (slow), P 4 (fast), and P 5 (slow), respectively. It has also been observed that duration of each of phases P 1, P 2, P 4, or P 5 accounts for approximately 10 – 15 % of the whole flexion cycle, while P 3 lasts for nearly half a cycle. Furthermore, although the flexions of DIP, PIP, and MCP joints cycle through the same five phases, the starts of their respective phases tend to vary. In P 2 and P 5, flexion of MCP takes place considerably later than those of PIP and DIP, whereas DIP flexes earlier than PIP in P 2. The angular velocity of each joint reaches its peaks in P 2 and P 4; the peak velocity of DIP occurs earlier than that of PIP or MCP in P 2, whereas peak of MCP is reached later than that of PIP. Moreover, the three joints of index finger flex with different angular velocities in each of the five phases: PIP moves significantly faster than MCP in P 2, whereas DIP moves faster than MCP in P 4. The results from our study indicate that the multi-joint motion of index finger is an uneven course, i. e. different joints flex with different angular velocities during the flexion. The temporal features of the velocity due to a single joint or multi-joint motion provide useful information to further clarify the dexterity of finger movement...|$|R

A hip??tese de que a dist??ncia geogr??fica do centro urbano influencia os desfechos de sa??de bucal em popula????es remotas foi testada. M??todos: As comunidades ribeirinhas foram selecionadas com base no crit??rio de localiza????o: uma deveria ser a mais pr??xima da sede do munic??pio (Comunidade de Isidoro) e a outra a mais distante (Comunidade de LauroSodr??). Um estudo de corte {{transversal}} foi conduzido, seguindo os crit??rios da OMS para pesquisas epidemiol??gicas em sa??de bucal. O estudo incluiu indiv??duos de 1 a 75 anos, e os grupos et??rios para an??lise inclu??ram os preconizados pela OMS. Os desfechos cl??nicos foram: c??rie para denti????o dec??dua (ceo-d) e permanente (CPO-D), condi????o periodontal de acordo com os ??ndices CPI, PIP e de sangramento gengival, e les??es de tecido mole. As vari??veis analisadas foram: local de resid??ncia, dados socioecon??micos, h??bitos de higiene e dieta. Adicionalmente, foram aplicados question??rios estruturados a indiv??duos acima de 18 anos, e entrevistas semi-estruturadas a informantes-chave para se obter dados sobre freq????ncia de uso dos servi??os odontol??gicosObjective: The aim of {{this thesis}} was to evaluate oral health conditions and to analyze factors associated with the health-disease process in two rural riverine populations located in the Amazonas state (Brazil). The hypothesis that the geographical distance from urban centers influences oral health outcomes in remote populations, has been tested. Methods: The riverine communities were selected based on the location criteria: one was the nearest from the administrative center of the town (Isidoro Community), {{and the other was}} the farther (Lauro Sodr?? Community). A cross-sectional study was conducted following the WHO guidelines for epidemiological surveys in oral health. The study covered population aged from 1 to 75 years, and the age groups for analysis included the WHO pattern. The clinical outcomes were: dental caries for deciduous (dmf-t) and permanent (DMF-T) teeth, periodontal condition according to the CPI and <b>PIP</b> <b>indexes</b> and to gingival bleeding, and soft tissue lesions. The variables analyzed were: place of residence, socioeconomic data, oral hygiene habits and diet. Additionally, structured questionnaires were applied to individuals above 18 years-old and semi-structured interviews were led with key-informants to obtain data about the frequency of use of dental health services. The OHIP- 14 was validated and applied to individuals above 18 years-old for the description of oral health impacts. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed for the comparison of the two communities. Results: 136 individuals in Isidoro and 242 individuals in Lauro Sodr?? were examined. The farther community (Lauro Sodr??) presented more caries, a higher prevalence of edentate persons, more time in between since their last dental visit, and more negative impacts of oral health than the nearest community. For the DMF-T outcome, when socioeconomic, hygiene and diet variables were controlled in the multivariate analyses, only place of residence and age remained significant. The psychometric properties of the OHIP- 14 was good (ICC= 0, 97 and Cronbach s alpha= 0, 89). Conclusions: The prevalence of untreated caries, oral pain, edentulism and oral health negative impacts were high for the riverines, especially for those who live further distant from the urban center. Additionally, the limited access to dental health services for these populations points to the need for imminent deployment of broad measures of health promotion, along with greater availability of services...|$|R
40|$|Background: Outcomes in the {{management}} of early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have been significantly improved through the use of composite disease activity measures (such as the DAS 28) and aggressive DMARD escalation until a lower disease activity target has been achieved. Imaging studies suggest that the DAS 28 may be insensitive to low levels of subclinical active disease that is associated with an increased risk of flare and progressive joint damage. Further, in some cases, elevations of the DAS 28 may not necessarily be related to on going active synovitis. In both instances, relying upon the DAS 28 assessment alone may lead to patients being considered for an inappropriate treatment decision since, patients with active subclinical disease may not be considered for further DMARD escalation whilst patients with non-inflammatory causes of DAS 28 elevation may be offered additional DMARD therapy that is either ineffective or potentially toxic. There is emerging evidence that musculoskeletal ultrasound (MSUS), gene expression profiles and inflammatory protein microarrays might provide useful additional disease activity information that allows clinicians to reach a treatment decision that is targeted at an individual patient’s specific needs. Objectives: 1. 	To determine whether using MSUS assessment of global disease activity in addition to the DAS 28 produces significantly better short-medium term clinical and radiological outcomes 2. 	To determine whether grouping early RA patients by either RA phenotype or disease activity level is associated with evidence of differential gene expression between the comparator groups 3. 	To determine the degree of correlation and agreement between the Multi-Biomarker Disease Activity (MBDA) test, the DAS 28 and a MSUS disease activity assessment Methods 111 patients with either clinical diagnoses of early RA (symptom duration < 1 year) or anti-CCP antibody positive inflammatory arthritis were recruited to the Targeting Synovitis in Early Rheumatoid Arthritis (TaSER) study. Clinical consultations occurred monthly for 18 months and all participants were treated using the same step-up DMARD-biologic escalation protocol. Participants were randomised to either a DAS 28 or MSUS assessment group. In the DAS 28 group, DMARD therapy was escalated until DAS 28 low disease activity (LDAS – DAS 28 < 3. 2) had been achieved. In the MSUS group, MSUS assessment was indicated for instances of DAS 28 LDAS or DAS 28 moderate disease activity (3. 2 ≤ DAS 28 < 5. 1) with minimal clinical synovitis (28 SJC ≤ 1). During MSUS assessment, the bilateral radiocarpal, index and middle MCP, <b>index</b> and middle <b>PIP</b> and 2 nd and 5 th MTP joints were examined for the presence of gray scale synovial hypertrophy and Power Doppler (PD) signal. Active disease was defined as the presence of grade 1 or higher PD signal in 2 or more joints. DMARD therapy was not changed if there had been significant escalation within the preceding 3 months. Intra-articular and intra-muscular corticosteroid injections were administered generously during periods of active disease. Blinded clinical outcomes were collected at baseline and every 3 months until study completion. Plain x-rays of hands and feet and MRI of the dominant wrist and hand were performed at baseline and study completion and will be graded by 2 independent radiologists who are blinded to participant’s randomisation group. Primary outcomes comprised: 1. mean change in DAS 44 from baseline and 18 months, 2. mean change in MRI RAMRIS erosion score between baseline and 18 months. Secondary outcome measures included: between group comparisons of the DAS 44 and ACR-EULAR remission rates, EULAR response criteria, HAQ, EURO-QoL 5 D, CRP, ESR, 10 cm pain visual analogue score, mean change in plain x-ray Sharp score (van der Heijde modification) and mean change in MRI RAMRIS synovitis and bone marrow oedema scores. 79 Participants donated additional blood samples for nested biomarker analysis at baseline, follow-up months 3 and 18. Baseline and 3 month PAXgene RNA samples were analysed {{with the assistance of the}} Systems Biology Group, Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences, University of Glasgow using an Illumina HumanHT- 12 v 4 Beadchip microarray. Baseline, 3 month and 18 month serum samples were analysed by Crescendo Biosciences using their in house MBDA microarray. Additional whole blood, serum and plasma samples remain available for future polyomic analyses. For the gene expression analysis, participants were segregated into comparator groups based upon baseline and 3 month RA phenotypic and disease activity data. Comparator groups were intended to represent common clinical scenarios. Between group comparisons of gene expression were conducted in the R software package using the Linear Models for Microarray Data (Limma) plug-in. An adjusted p value < 0. 05 was considered to represent evidence of differential gene expression. For the MBDA analysis, the degree of correlation (Spearman’s rank correlation) between DAS 28 and MBDA score was calculated at each time point and for all time points pooled together. The percentage agreement between MBDA, DAS 28 and MSUS disease activity state categorisations was also calculated. Results: 111 participants were recruited and 101 (91...|$|R
