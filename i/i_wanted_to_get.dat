I had him on the brain for sure but I hadn't called him yet, but I sort of took a leap of faith and set things up with Fox and then called Joss. We went to a four-hour lunch where I just sort of used my womanly wiles. No, we've become such good friends, kind of like brother and sister and kind of like he was my watcher, my handler from when I first moved out to L.A. when I was 17 and I {{was a little bit of}} a wild child. He's watched me and helped me and taught me over the years. I told him how bad I wanted and needed him back and he accepted and here we are.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{the lack}} of {{creative}} direction, Waters began to visualise a new concept after several weeks. During 1974, Pink Floyd had sketched out three original compositions and had performed them at a series of concerts in Europe. These compositions became {{the starting point for}} a new album whose opening four-note guitar phrase, composed purely by chance by Gilmour, reminded Waters of Barrett. The songs provided a fitting summary of {{the rise and fall of}} their former bandmate. Waters commented: [...] "Because <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> as close as possible to what I felt... indefinable, inevitable melancholy about the disappearance of Syd." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{appearing}} in the 1986 films Jumpin' Jack Flash and ¡Three Amigos!, Hartman successfully auditioned for NBC's variety show Saturday Night Live (SNL) and joined the cast and writing staff.

Hartman's original Saturday Night Live characters included Eugene, the Anal Retentive Chef and Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer. His impressions included Frank Sinatra, Ronald Reagan, Ed McMahon, Barbara Bush, Charlton Heston, Phil Donahue and Bill Clinton; the last was often considered his best-known impression.|$|E

[...] Essentially saying that his (relatively) slow times in the 100 and 200 meters were the result of too short a period to train and prepare, Thorpe announced he will continue training, setting as his (new) goal qualifying for the World Championships in 2013.|$|E

500|$|On July 29, 1966, Dylan crashed his 500cc Triumph Tiger 100 {{motorcycle}} {{near his}} home in Woodstock, New York, and was thrown to the ground. Though the extent of his injuries was never disclosed, Dylan said that he broke several vertebrae in his neck. Mystery still surrounds the circumstances of the accident since no ambulance was called to the scene and Dylan was not hospitalized. Dylan's biographers have written that the crash offered Dylan the chance to escape the pressures around him. Dylan confirmed this interpretation in his autobiography: [...] "I had been in a motorcycle accident and I'd been hurt, but I recovered. Truth was that <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out of the rat race." [...] Dylan withdrew from public and, apart from a few appearances, did not tour again for almost eight years.|$|E
500|$|The show's animal trainer, Debbie Cove, used {{around three}} hundred {{cockroaches}} for this episode.

[...] "I really admired that. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to that kind of place where the song could just exist with a guitar and a vocal." [...] With Icelandic audio engineer S. Husky Höskulds, Ndegéocello proceeded to record the album in seven days, backed by a band that featured guitarist Chris Bruce, keyboardist Keefus Ciancia, and drummer Deantoni Parks. She later credited them with providing her inspiration and critique while keeping her [...] "clear about what is the real focus—in life and in music". Their instruments were recorded live without digital post-production, which New York Times critic Ben Ratliff said contributed to the music's raw and organic sound.|$|E
500|$|McFall {{spent the}} next year at home, during which he took up {{mountain}} biking and climbing {{and worked as a}} fitness instructor at his local leisure centre.

I missed that and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> that back." [...] After taking up his place at Swansea University to pursue a Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) in sport and exercise science, he practised on the university's running track and also trained with a local running club, the Swansea Harriers Athletic Club. However, he found running difficult and uncomfortable as his prosthesis was not designed for the purpose, and frequently got damaged. Upon making inquiries at the Federation of Disability Sport Wales (FDSW), he was introduced to carbon-fibre running [...] "blades". He graduated from university with an upper second-class honours degree in summer 2004, taking part in his first race at the Disability Sports Events (DSE) Championships in the UK the same year.|$|E

In July 2009, Big Boi left Jive Records, following creative differences and the label's unwillingness to release and promote his solo album. According to Big Boi, Jive gave him an ultimatum to shop the album elsewhere.

500|$|In his own words, Ocean {{calls the}} album [...] "nostalgic." [...] He explains, [...] "it's {{a longing for}} the past. That's what this record felt like." [...] The lyrical content, {{according}} to Ocean, relates to heartbreak and other familiar tropes of interpersonal relationships: [...] "I wasn't {{trying to make a}} record that people could relate to. I was just trying to make a record with the shit that I wanted to express. The shit that <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> off my chest. [...] A lot of this record is influenced by one relationship, but I don't owe that whole project to one situation. It doesn't matter what the details of it are." [...] Discussing the writing process behind the album, he mused that he was just inspired to tell stories. He continued, [...] "you gotta make sure the listener is listening to you, so if you put it into a song, often times, if the song is striking enough, then you can really deliver the story most effectively while keeping the ear of the listener the whole time. I guess it all starts with the stories for me." ...|$|E
500|$|The United States entered World War II {{with the}} attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. Feller heard about the bombing while {{returning}} from a visit to his terminally ill father at Des Moines to Chicago where he was to sign a new Indians contract. Two days later, he volunteered for the United States Navy, becoming the first American professional athlete to enlist. Originally he tried to enlist as a fighter pilot but failed hearing tests. Feller attended basic training at Norfolk Naval Base {{and served as a}} physical fitness instructor there. He also pitched in baseball games hosted by the military. Although he had received a military exemption owing to his father's failing health, he wanted to serve in combat missions.

500|$|He {{then joined}} Don Carthel's West Texas A University staff as a {{volunteer}} quarterbacks coach in 2006, commenting, [...] "About a year after I retired from playing, I decided that <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> back to college, where I had the greatest time of my life, and {{to get involved with}} college football." [...] He also admitted that he was unprepared for the NFL when he was drafted back in 1998. In April 2008, ESPN described Leaf as having come to terms with his past. [...] He said at the time, [...] "When playing football became a job, it lost its luster for me. I kind of got out of the spotlight, and life's never been this good." [...] But in November 2008 he was put on indefinite leave, and resigned the next day, from his coaching position at West Texas A for allegedly asking one of his players for a pill to help him deal with pain in his wrist from past injuries. Leaf's usage of painkillers dates back to 2002, when he took Vicodin from a boxing promoter after attending a match in Las Vegas. Leaf described the event as what [...] "started about an eight-year run of off-and-on Opioid abuse that took my life to the very bottom".|$|E
