5|$|Although Jennings {{dreamed of}} {{following}} in his father's footsteps in broadcasting, {{his first job}} was as a bank teller for the Royal Bank of Canada. He <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> the company would assign him to its Havana branch; instead, it located him to {{the small town of}} Prescott, Ontario, before transferring him to its nearby Brockville branch. During this time, he explored acting by appearing in several amateur musical productions with the Orpheus Musical Theatre Society, including Damn Yankees and South Pacific.|$|E
5|$|Revie {{returned}} to the First Division when he joined Leeds United in November 1958 for a £14,000 fee. Manager Bill Lambton <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> Revie's creativity would help the Peacocks to turn their poor form around, and appointed him as captain. Leeds avoided relegation in 1958–59, but new manager Jack Taylor took Leeds down in the 1959–60 campaign with the division's worst defensive record. Revie recognised his playing days were {{coming to an end}} and relinquished the captaincy to Freddie Goodwin.|$|E
5|$|The film {{received}} {{numerous awards}} and nominations. Although Vikram <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> the film {{would get him}} his second National Award, the film won its only National Award in the Special Effects category. Anniyan became the fourth film directed by Shankar to receive that award; the other three are Kadhalan (1994), Indian (1996) and Jeans (1998). It also won eight out of the total 15 awards awarded by Filmfare for the best of Tamil cinema.|$|E

50|$|The {{rescue effort}} {{continued}} after Diver had been found, now <b>that</b> rescue workers <b>had</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> {{there would be}} more survivors. They did not find any, and the last body was recovered on the following Thursday.|$|R
5|$|The {{reintegration}} of French prisoners into {{civilian life}} was facilitated by {{a network of}} Maisons du Prisonnier (Prisoner Houses), established across France, which would help them readjust and find work. Generally, prisoners generally found it easy to regain their pre-war jobs because of the shortage of labour. The government <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> returning prisoners of war would be more sympathetic to the Vichy regime, but prisoners coming back were not noticeably more loyal to Vichy than other groups.|$|E
5|$|A {{complication}} arose when Venancio Sanchez of St. Augustine {{purchased for}} US$400 a half {{share in the}} old Fornells grant from another surviving heir, who lived in Havana. A feud quickly developed between Sanchez and the Davises, with Sanchez demanding {{a division of the}} property, and the Davises refusing to acknowledge that Sanchez had any claim to the island. The Davises <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> a restored lighthouse would be the centerpiece of their town, but all attempts to repair the lighthouse failed while the war was on. Shortly {{after the end of the}} war, the Davises gave up on Key Biscayne and moved to Texas. Their older son Edmund J. Davis eventually was elected as governor there.|$|E
5|$|A {{document}} from 25 March contains her {{note that}} joining the uprising was her sole idea, {{and that she}} <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> such a moment would come her entire life. She cut her hair, prepared a uniform for herself and organized and equipped a group of volunteers, speaking passionately after a mass on 29 March. On 4 April she signed a declaratory document marking her access to the local uprising forces. Her unit was composed of roughly 280 infantry, 60 cavalry and several hundred peasants armed with war scythes.|$|E

60|$|He <b>had</b> <b>hopes</b> <b>that</b> {{he would}} soon make himself so {{indispensable}} {{that he would get}} someone to take him into partnership, and there was no reason why in a few years he should not be a rich man.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, how {{thoughtful}} of him!" [...] cried Miss Ailie, the deceived, and McLean said: [...] "How very thoughtful!" [...] {{but now he}} saw in a flash why Mr. Cathro still <b>had</b> <b>hopes</b> <b>that</b> Tommy might carry a bursary.|$|R
5|$|Also on 10 October 19, {{his wife}} Livilla {{had given birth}} to twin sons, Tiberius Gemellus and Germanicus, whom he named after his adoptive brother. Their birth was celebrated by his father who claimed that never before in the history of Rome had twins been born to a man as high in rank as Drusus, and the event was commemorated on the reverse of coins. Tiberius <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> Drusus would keep the {{imperial}} family together and entrusted him with the guardianship of Germanicus' sons, Nero and Drusus.|$|E
5|$|Cloverleaf {{announced}} Rosecroft {{would close}} on July 1, 2010. Live racing ended in 2009, {{and the track}} only had simulcasts as revenue from off-track betting. After several of the surrounding states legalized casinos, Rosecroft was unable to continue as a successful business. Cloverleaf Enterprises filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in June 2009. Mark Vogel loaned the track $350,000 and offered to buy the track, but a bankruptcy court judge refused to approve the plan. Rosecroft officials <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> the Maryland General Assembly would approve legislation allowing casino-style gambling at Rosecroft, {{but that did not}} occur. In early June 2010, Cloverleaf filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} time, Kneale used a {{character}} {{from a previous}} serial other than Quatermass himself, the journalist James Fullalove from The Quatermass Experiment. The production team <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> Paul Whitsun-Jones {{would be able to}} reprise the part; he was unavailable and Brian Worth was cast instead. Michael Ripper appeared as an army sergeant; he had been in Hammer Film Productions' adaptation of the second Quatermass serial, Quatermass 2, the previous year. The drama also featured future Dad's Army actress Nan Braunton as Miss Dobson.|$|E

5|$|Hensley met Inez Hutcheson, a widow {{with ten}} children, in 1946 while {{performing}} a service in Soddy-Daisy, Tennessee. After Hensley spoke with her, she accepted {{the doctrine of}} snake handling. He soon proposed marriage, which she accepted. They lived in the Soddy-Daisy area for several months. Although he <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> she would travel with him and read Bible passages during his services, she left him after {{less than a year}} of marriage, and their union was soon dissolved. In 1951, Hensley married Sally Norman in Chattanooga. After their marriage, she traveled with him as he ministered in Tennessee and Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|Hergé <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> {{being the}} author of an ongoing comic strip would improve his job prospects, for {{at the time he}} was {{beginning}} to develop a reputation as a designer of postcards, stationary, and advertisements. Rather than representing an example of a comic as the medium would come to be understood in the following decade, The Adventures of Totor consisted of square boxes containing illustrations with the captions written separately underneath, as was the style found in French comic creator Christophe's works La Famille Fenouillard (The Fenouillard Family) and Sapeur Camembert (Sapper Camembert). Initially using four boxes per page, as the series progressed this was increased to six and then eight, with each page ending on a cliffhanger.|$|E
5|$|In 1915, a new Mint director, Robert W. Woolley, took office. Woolley {{advocated}} {{the replacement of}} the silver coins when it was legal to do so, and instructed Barber and Morgan to prepare new designs. He consulted with the Commission of Fine Arts, asking them to examine the designs produced by the Mint's engravers and, if they felt they were not suitable, to recommend artists to design the new coins. The Commission rejected the Barber and Morgan designs and proposed Adolph Weinman, Hermon MacNeil, and Albin Polasek as designers. Although Woolley <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> each artist would produce one design, different concepts by Weinman were accepted for the dime and half dollar, and one by MacNeil for the quarter.|$|E

60|$|BENNET. She was {{not without}} her attractions. Her chief faults, I am {{inclined}} to think, were those arising from want of discipline in youth. I <b>have</b> <b>hopes</b> <b>that</b> {{it is not even}} yet too late to root out from her nature the weeds of indiscretion.|$|R
5|$|The {{first months}} of Bradbury's {{directorship}} were particularly difficult. He <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> Atomic Energy Act of 1946 would be quickly passed by Congress and the wartime Manhattan Project would be superseded by a new, permanent organization. It {{soon became clear that}} this would take more than six months. President Harry S. Truman did not sign the act creating the Atomic Energy Commission into law until 1 August 1946, and it did not become active until 1 January 1947. In the meantime, Groves' legal authority to act was limited.|$|E
5|$|The second movie Cagney's company {{produced}} was Blood on the Sun. Insisting {{on doing}} his own stunts, Cagney required judo training from expert Ken Kuniyuki and Jack Halloran, a former policeman. The Cagneys <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> an action film would appeal more to audiences, but it fared worse {{at the box}} office than Johnny Come Lately. At this time, Cagney heard of young war hero Audie Murphy, who had appeared on the cover of Life magazine. Cagney thought that Murphy had the looks to be a movie star, and suggested that he come to Hollywood. Cagney felt, however, that Murphy could not act, and his contract was loaned out and then sold.|$|E
5|$|A {{detailed}} {{proposal was}} presented by Oslo Sporveier in August 1996. It {{became clear that}} Berg would not be served by the Ring Line. Many neighbours to {{the route of the}} Sognsvann Line complained about this proposal, stating that they <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> the section from Majorstuen to Berg would have been rebuilt as a tunnel. They also argued that it was irrational that the line was running at-grade in densely populated areas, while it would run in a tunnel through the then mostly unpopulated Nydalen. To compensate, Oslo Sporveier stated that they would build noise screens along the line. Also, the Norwegian Public Roads Administration protested to the plans, and stated that funding should be allocated to upgrading Ring 3 to six lanes before public transport investments were made in the area.|$|E
50|$|The {{purpose of}} a hunping is {{somewhat}} enigmatic, but archaeologists suggest {{that they may have}} been used as containers for fruit accompanying the deceased into the afterlife. According to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the ancients may <b>have</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> the soul of the deceased would eventually reside in the vessel.|$|R
50|$|The {{convention}} is interesting in many ways. It represents the theoretically voluntary transferral {{of authority in}} Kandy to the British, and indeed later events showed that the Kandyan nobility did <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> they were simply replacing one malleable master (the Nayakkar monarchy) with another (the British). Indeed, Ehelepola appears to <b>have</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> the new master {{would not be the}} British at all, but himself.|$|R

5|$|A strong game by Doug Williams {{carried the}} Buccaneers despite an anemic rushing attack. Both teams later complained about officiating errors and the {{malfunctioning}} game clock. The Metropolitan Stadium 30-second clock failed {{for the second}} week in a row, as did both regulation clocks. The Buccaneers survived a last-minute drive by the Vikings in which quarterback Tommy Kramer was penalized for throwing a pass from beyond the line of scrimmage, which helped to keep the Vikings out of field goal range. Curtis Jordan sealed the victory by deflecting Kramer's last-second Hail Mary pass. Kramer later admitted to being aware of having crossed the line of scrimmage, but <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> the officials would miss it as they had missed so many other penalties in the game.|$|E
5|$|Apollo 14 {{had visited}} and sampled a ridge of {{material}} that had been ejected by the impact that created the Mare Imbrium impact basin. Likewise, Apollo 15 had also sampled material {{in the region of}} Imbrium, visiting the basin's edge. There remained the possibility, because the Apollo 14 and Apollo 15 landing sites were closely associated with the Imbrium basin, that different geologic processes were prevalent in areas of the lunar highlands far from Mare Imbrium. Several members of the scientific community remarked that the central lunar highlands resembled regions on Earth that were created by volcanic processes and hypothesized the same might be true on the Moon. They <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> scientific output from the Apollo 16 mission would provide an answer.|$|E
5|$|Dunne <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> {{by moving}} to New York to write full-time, {{he would be}} able to greatly expand his output, and he signed to do several projects, {{including}} a play featuring Mr. Dooley, and for a series of third-person stories featuring Molly Donahue, Bridgeport's resident suffragist. But Dunne found that he could not increase his production, and that some of the Dooley projects were ill-suited to the character: the play went unwritten and the Molly Donahue stories were abandoned after four pieces. Dooley appears as a character in some of them. Fanning found them unsatisfactory, with a misplaced Dooley, deprived of his bar and control of the dialogue. Dunne was not happy with them either: a note from the author appeared in the Ladies' Home Journal after the fourth piece was published there, alleging ill-health and dissatisfaction with the product.|$|E
