40|$|In this work, {{quantitative}} energy-dispersive {{electron probe}} X-ray microanalysis (ED-EPMA) (called low-Z particle EPMA), Raman microspectrometry (RMS), and attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic (ATR-FTIR) imaging were applied in combination {{for the analysis}} of the same <b>individual</b> airborne <b>particles</b> for the first time. After examining <b>individual</b> <b>particles</b> of micrometer size by low-Z particle EPMA, consecutive examinations by RMS and ATR-FTIR imaging of the same <b>individual</b> <b>particles</b> were then performed. The relocation of the same particles on Al or Ag foils was successfully carried out among the three standalone instruments for several standard samples and an indoor airborne particle sample, resulting in the successful acquisition of quality spectral data from the three single-particle analytical techniques. The combined application of the three techniques to several different standard particles confirmed that those techniques provided consistent and complementary chemical composition information on the same <b>individual</b> <b>particles.</b> Further, it was clearly demonstrated that the three different types of spectral and imaging data from the same <b>individual</b> <b>particles</b> in an indoor aerosol sample provided richer information on physicochemical characteristics of the particle ensemble than that obtainable by the combined use of two single-particle analytical techniques...|$|R

25|$|Swarm {{algorithms}} {{follow a}} Lagrangian approach or an Eulerian approach. The Eulerian approach views the swarm as a field, {{working with the}} density of the swarm and deriving mean field properties.

However, most models work with the Lagrangian approach, which is an agent-based model following the individual agents (points or particles) that make up the swarm. <b>Individual</b> <b>particle</b> models can follow information on heading and spacing that is lost in the Eulerian approach.|$|E

25|$|Even if {{the source}} {{intensity}} is turned down, {{so that only}} one particle (e.g. photon or electron) is passing through the apparatus at a time, the same interference pattern develops over time. The quantum particle acts as a wave when passing through the double slits, but as a particle when it is detected. This is a typical feature of quantum complementarity: a quantum particle will act as a wave in an experiment to measure its wave-like properties, and like a particle in an experiment to measure its particle-like properties. The point on the detector screen where any <b>individual</b> <b>particle</b> shows up will {{be the result of}} a random process. However, the distribution pattern of many individual particles will mimic the diffraction pattern produced by waves.|$|E
25|$|In {{a highly}} publicized {{experiment}} in 2012, researchers claimed to have identified the path each particle had taken without any adverse effects {{at all on the}} interference pattern generated by the particles. In order to do this, they used a setup such that particles coming to the screen were not from a point-like source, but from a source with two intensity maxima. However, commentators such as Svensson have pointed out that there is in fact no conflict between the weak measurements performed in this variant of the double-slit experiment and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Weak measurement followed by post-selection did not allow simultaneous position and momentum measurements for each <b>individual</b> <b>particle,</b> but rather allowed measurement of the average trajectory of the particles that arrived at different positions. In other words, the experimenters were creating a statistical map of the full trajectory landscape.|$|E
25|$|A {{colloidal}} crystal is {{a highly}} ordered array of particles that forms over a long range (from a few millimeters to one centimeter in length); colloidal crystals have appearance and properties roughly analogous to their atomic or molecular counterparts. It {{has been known for}} many years that, due to repulsive Coulombic interactions, electrically charged macromolecules in an aqueous environment can exhibit long-range crystal-like correlations, with interparticle separation distances often being considerably greater than the <b>individual</b> <b>particle</b> diameter. Periodic arrays of spherical particles give rise to interstitial voids (the spaces between the particles), which act as a natural diffraction grating for visible light waves, when the interstitial spacing is of the same order of magnitude as the incident lightwave. In these cases in nature, brilliant iridescence (or play of colours) is attributed to the diffraction and constructive interference of visible lightwaves according to Bragg’s law, in a matter analogous to the scattering of X-rays in crystalline solid. The effects occur at visible wavelengths because the separation parameter d is much larger than for true crystals.|$|E

25|$|According to the {{principles}} of quantum mechanics, particles do not actually have trajectories through space. Motion can only be described in terms of waves, and the momentum p of an <b>individual</b> <b>particle</b> is related to its wavelength λ by pnbsp&=nbsp&h/λ. In terms of empirical measurements, the wavelength can only be determined by observing a change in the wave between one point in space and another nearby point (mathematically, by differentiation). A wave with a shorter wavelength oscillates more rapidly, and therefore changes more rapidly between nearby points. Now suppose that we arbitrarily fix a gauge at one point in space, by saying that the energy at that location is 20% A's and 80% B's. We then measure the two waves at some other, nearby point, in order to determine their wavelengths. But there are two entirely different reasons that the waves could have changed. They could have changed because they were oscillating with a certain wavelength, or they could have changed because the gauge function changed from a 20-80 mixture to, say, 21-79. If we ignore the second possibility, the resulting theory doesn't work; strange discrepancies in momentum will show up, violating the principle of conservation of momentum. Something in the theory must be changed.|$|E
500|$|Besides rotation, {{another factor}} that can widen the {{absorption}} features in the spectrum of a star is pressure broadening. The presence of nearby particles will affect the radiation emitted by an <b>individual</b> <b>particle.</b> So the line width {{is dependent on the}} surface pressure of the star, which in turn is determined by the temperature and surface gravity. This technique was used to determine the surface gravity of Tau Ceti. The , or logarithm of the star's surface gravity, is about 4.4—very close to the [...] for the Sun.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{techniques}} {{used to measure}} flows are laser Doppler velocimetry [...] and hot-wire anemometry. The main difference between PIV and those techniques is that PIV produces two-dimensional or even three-dimensional vector fields, while the other techniques measure the velocity at a point. During PIV, the particle concentration is such {{that it is possible}} to identify individual particles in an image, but not with certainty to track it between images. When the particle concentration is so low {{that it is possible to}} follow an <b>individual</b> <b>particle</b> it is called Particle tracking velocimetry, while Laser speckle velocimetry is used for cases where the particle concentration is so high that it is difficult to observe individual particles in an image.|$|E

40|$|The {{determination}} of low-Z {{elements such as}} carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen in atmospheric aerosol particles is of interest in studying environmental pollution. Conventional electron probe microanalysis technique has a limitation for the {{determination of}} the low-Z elements, mainly because the Be window in an energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) detector hinders the detection of characteristic X-rays from light elements. The feasibility of low-Z element determination in <b>individual</b> <b>particles</b> using a windowless EDX detector is investigated. To develop a method capable of identifying chemical species of <b>individual</b> <b>particles,</b> both the matrix and the geometric effects of particles have to be evaluated. X-rays of low-Z elements generated by an electron beam are so soft that important matrix effects, mostly due to X-ray absorption, exist even within particles in the micrometer size range. Also, the observed radiation, especially that of light elements, experiences different extents of absorption, depending on the shape and size of the particles. Monte Carlo calculation is applied to explain the variation of observed X-ray intensities according to the geometric and chemical compositional variation of <b>individual</b> <b>particles,</b> at different primary electron beam energies. A comparison is carried out between simulated and experimental data, collected for standard <b>individual</b> <b>particles</b> with chemical compositions as generally observed in marine and continental aerosols. Despite the many fundamental problematic analytical factors involved in the observation of X-rays from low-Z elements, the Monte Carlo calculation proves to be quite reliable to evaluate those matrix and geometric effects. Practical aspects of the Monte Carlo calculation for the determination of light elements in <b>individual</b> <b>particles</b> are also considered...|$|R

2500|$|Similarly, {{the fluid}} dynamic {{interaction}} of particles suspended in a flow were investigated. The drag forces exerted on the particles by the relative velocity by {{them and the}} flow were treated as additional forces acting on the particles. Therefore, these multiphase flow phenomena including a solid e.g.~particulate and a gaseous or fluid phase resolve the particulate phase by discrete methods, while gas or liquid flow is described by continuous methods, and therefore, is labelled the combined continuum and discrete model (CCDM) as applied by Kawaguchi et al., Hoomans, Xu 1997 and Xu 1998. [...] Due to a discrete description of the solid phase, constitutive relations are omitted, and therefore, leads {{to a better understanding}} of the fundamentals. This was also concluded by Zhu 2007 et al. and Zhu 2008 et al. during a review on particulate flows modelled with the CCDM approach. It has seen a mayor development in last two decades and describes motion of the solid phase by the Discrete Element Method (DEM) on an <b>individual</b> <b>particle</b> scale and the remaining phases are treated by the Navier-Stokes equations. Thus, the method is recognized as an effective tool to investigate into the interaction between a particulate and fluid phase as reviewed by Yu and Xu, Feng and Yu [...] and Deen et al.

40|$|JohnnyVon is an {{implementation}} of self-replicating automata in continuous two-dimensional space. Two types of particles drift {{about in a}} virtual liquid. The particles are automata with discrete internal states but continuous external relationships. Their internal states are governed by finite state machines but their external relationships are governed by a simulated physics that includes brownian motion, viscosity, and spring-like attractive and repulsive forces.
