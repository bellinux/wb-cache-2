5000|$|As {{an urgency}} to find {{alternatives}} to fossil fuels rises globally, anthropologists prove the constant shift of climate and temperature. We {{refer to this}} today as “climate change”.  As decades of fossil <b>fuel</b> <b>residue</b> and carbon emissions {{have been exposed to}} the world, this has proven the melting of ice caps, and a general increase in global temperature. Historically, a sense of denial was implied, in the connection of greenhouse gases and the rise of climate change. More recently, a link between the two is becoming more clear.  “Given that 86% of global energy comes from fossil fuels and that these produce annually 27 billion tons of CO2 emissions, finding alternative energy sources is a critical component in the strategy to reduce the effect of climate change”.  Although, this is not to be believed the sole reason for an increase of temperature, but in addition the rise in population has attributed to this.  With Mexico placing within the top ten populated countries, it is clear the contribution this country has made.  The chart below better informs the population by year, and the percent of change that has occurred.|$|E

Upon taking on his role as Riverkeeper in 1983, Cronin was tipped off by a state trooper that oil tankers were rinsing {{contents}} into the Hudson. He quickly engaged the issue and often anchored near the advised area {{to listen to the}} captains' discussions over the radio at night. When he learned ships were flushing out jet <b>fuel</b> <b>residue</b> and filling up with river water to take to an Exxon refinery, Cronin started collecting water samples. Over two years, he recorded one hundred seventy-seven Exxon tankers discharge into the river and take up clean water. Cronin's proof was so thorough that Exxon settled, paying $1.5 million to New York State for a private river management fund and $500,000 to HRFA; half of which went to Riverkeeper and the other half towards environmental projects on the Hudson. This case afforded Riverkeeper local and national regard. In 1986, HRFA joined Riverkeeper as one group to protect the river, to retract it from corporate abuse and to return it to public use. Cronin saw Riverkeeper's new mission as not just to hunt polluters, but to prove itself to the community and empower those who felt the social disruption of the ecological misuse of the Hudson.|$|E

Although {{it is possible to}} immobilize actinides in vitreous wasteforms; ceramic phases, such as brannerite (UTi 2 O 6), are attractive due to their high waste loading capacity and relative insolubility. A range of uranium brannerites, formulated GdxU 1 -xTi 2 O 6, were prepared using a mixed oxide route. Charge compensation of divalent and trivalent cations was expected to occur via the oxidation of U 4 + to higher valence states (U 5 + or U 6 +).

The improvement is even higher at high idle (3100 r/min), exceeding 40 per cent.

40|$|One of {{the space}} hazards of concern {{is the problem of}} natural matter and space debris {{impacting}} spacecraft. In addition to mechanical damage, impact velocities greater than 5 km/sec can produce shock induced ionization effects with resultant surface charging and complex chemical interactions. The upper limit of the velocity distribution for these particles is on the order of 70 km/sec. The second source of particulate matter is due to the presence of man and the machinery needed to place satellites in orbit. This 'man made' component {{of the space}} debris consists of waste, rocket exhaust, and debris caused by satellite break-up. Most of the particles are small. However as the size increases, debris purposefully thrown overboard such as garbage and human waste, combined with paint chips, plastic, wire fragments, bolts, etc., become formidable hazards which completely dominate the distribution function for some orbits. These larger fragments can produce penetration and spalling of the thick metallic structures associated with spacecraft. The particles most often encountered are aluminum oxide, associated with <b>fuel</b> <b>residue,</b> and paint chips. These debris types can have a wide range of particle sizes. It has been stated that the design of spacecraft will have to take the debris evolution into account and provide additional suitable armor for key components in the near future.

Man's contribution ranges from <b>fuel</b> <b>residue</b> to large derelect satellites that weigh many kilograms. Current debris models are able to predict {{the growth of the}} problem and suggest that spacecraft must employ armor or bumper shields for some orbital altitudes now, and that, the problem will become worse as a function of time. The practical upper limit to the velocity distribution is on the order of 40 km/s and is associated with the natural environment. The maximum velocity of the man-made component is in the 14 - 16 km/s range. The Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) has verified that the 'high probability of impact' particles are in the microgram to milligram range. These particles can have significant effects on coatings, insulators, and thin metallic layers.

40|$|Kosterhavet National Park, {{a marine}} {{protected}} area on the Swedish west coast, is a popular destination for tourists and attracts over half a million visitors annually. Many of the tourists arrive by boat, and the natural harbours are frequently visited. Boat presence may affect bottom substrates through anchoring, and pollution could also occur {{in the form of}} leaching antifouling paints, <b>fuel</b> <b>residue</b> (PAHs) and litter. This thesis set out to investigate if there are any lingering impacts resulting from boat tourism in Kosterhavet and suggests management efforts in those cases there are. Through studies using a video sledge, data from two consecutive years revealed visible anchor traces on soft un-vegetated bottoms, and number of traces were also linked to number of bottom anchoring boats. Furthermore, it was found that visitors engage in bottom anchoring at locations where sensitive habitats like eelgrass and oyster beds are located, which may result in harm to both habitat types. Sediment samples taken in both natural harbours and small marinas unexpectedly showed presence of long since banned antifouling products like TBT, but also more recently prohibited biocides like irgarol and diuron. This suggests that they are still in use. Moreover, water samples from the area show that the currently used antifouling compound copper, is likely to exceed threshold values set by the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (SwAM) during peak boat season. Concentrations of PAHs were found to be below threshold values for water, but they are also known to have low water solubility {{and are more likely to}} be bound to particles. From the video data, occurrence of seafloor litter was also obtained and data on beach litter from reference sites on the Swedish west coast was downloaded from the OSPAR beach litter database. Seafloor litter, in contradiction to beach litter, was at a much higher degree found to have an origin related to recreational activities. This suggest that beach litter stem from other activities in the park, or are brought to the area by currents. A threat analysis based on the leisure boat related threats; anchoring, antifouling, PAHs and litter were performed. The threats were analysed with respect to their potential impact on three soft bottom values; eelgrass, oysters and blue mussels. The sum of these threats showed that eelgrass was highly impacted by anchoring, but oysters were more severely affected when all threats were considered. This type of threat analysis can be of great value to park managers, as they need to make prioritizations regarding how to use their often limited resources. Based on these finding, it is, among others, suggested that bottom anchoring should not be allowed at locations where eelgrass and oyster beds occur, and that bottom friendly mooring solutions should be made available to avoid negative impact on these habitats. ...|$|E
40|$|For {{the first}} time, the {{dependency}} {{of the characteristics}} of organic matter in PM 2. 5 on geographical and climatic zones in three metropolitan cities of China was studied. Seasonal samples were collected at suburban and urban sites in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou in 2002 and 2003. To further support the above study, seasonal samples were also collected at Changdao Island, a remote island, in Bohai Sea/Yellow Sea. Concentrations of organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), and solvent-extractable organic compounds (SEOC) were analyzed. The characteristics of the n-alkanes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, n-fatty acids, n-alkanols and molecular markers such as triterpanes were determined and used for source identification. Source apportionment was complemented by Chemical Mass Balance (CMB) modeling using the measured organic species as tracers. The impact of wind speed and wind direction on air quality was studied by back trajectory calculations and analysis. In general, traffic emissions were the largest contributors of OC followed by coal burning, kitchen emissions, vegetative detritus and biomass burning. However, in the space-heating season in Northern China, coal burning was the most important contributor of OC in the suburban areas of Beijing and at Changdao. Beijing had the highest concentration of organic aerosol followed by Guangzhou and Shanghai, while seasonal variation was in reverse order. Dispersion conditions determined by local topographies and meteorology were responsible for this trend. Contrary to common understanding, pollutant concentrations at the suburban sites were higher than the urban sites in all three cities. The main reason was the rapid urbanization of the suburban areas in the immediate vicinity of urban centers since China opened up for economic development, in addition, large numbers of manufacturing plants were relocated from the cities to the countryside in an attempt to clean up the urban environment. WSOC/TC ratios were comparable in all three cities at 0. 2 - 0. 3 and this value can be considered typical for urban aerosols from Chinese cities. Similar PAH/ALK ratios were found in the three cities, and PAHs were from a mixed contribution of coal burning and engine exhaust. More than half of the resolved SEOC was found to be n-fatty acids and they were mainly from kitchen emissions based on source profile comparisons and CMB analysis. The increase of contribution from coal burning in Beijing due to space heating was identified by the different distribution of triterpanes in summer and winter. The relative concentrations of semivolatile fossil <b>fuel</b> <b>residue</b> n-alkanes (<=C 26) were inversely dependent on the ambient temperature. Similar trend was found in the concentrations of the semivolatile PAHs (molecular weight <= 228). This was mainly caused by the gas/particle partitioning of semivolatile species in the different climatic zones. The enrichment of higher molecular weight plant wax compounds from Beijing to Shanghai to Guangzhou was a reflection of the variations of the vegetation in the different climatic zones. The seasonal variations in the concentrations and compositions of organic matter at Changdao were similar to the three cities, especially to Beijing. The remote island was also impacted by anthropogenic pollutants, and transported particles {{played a significant role in}} the contribution of the organic matter exemplified by the high WSOC/TC, low C 18 : 1 /C 18 fatty acid, and high BeP/(BeP+BaP) ratios...|$|E

The {{focus was on}} solvent-extractable organic compounds (SEOC), which were used to identify the influences of geography, variation of the season, sources and transport on the concentration and distribution of these homologues. Organic carbon, elemental carbon, and water-soluble organic carbon concentrations were analyzed only for the substantiation of the SEOC findings. Analysis of the fossil <b>fuel</b> <b>residues</b> and the plant wax components in n-alkanes, PAHs, fatty acids and n-alkanols allowed the identification of anthropogenic (coal and petroleum combustion processes, and kitchen emissions) and biogenic (vegetation and microbial) sources. The influence of temperature {{on the distribution of}} the SEOC was exemplified by the negative correlation between the relative concentrations of the semivolatile homologues (alkanes and PAHs) and ambient temperature. This is attributable to gas-particle partitioning. Indirectly, ambient temperature dictates the type of vegetation that can grow in a geographical zone. This would influence the distribution of the plant waxes, and finally, it plays a role in the aerosol loading due to energy usage. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

The flame appearances and effects of sand sizes and sand layer depths on flame temperature profiles, locations of vapor/liquid interface, vapor region moving speed, combustion duration time, fuel consumption and amount of <b>fuel</b> <b>residues</b> in the porous beds were studied in the experiments. An approximate analytical model based on the assumption of a two-phase Stefan problem was employed to predict the fuel consumption rate and the interface location. This model can quantitatively predict the interface position of combustion of the liquid fuel in the porous bed. The predicted results can also confirm that heat transfer in the bed is the controlling mode at the beginning stage of the combustion. After that, capillary force acts as the dominant role for diffusion of the vapor upward.

40|$|Fine {{particle}} emissions {{were measured}} at two commercial grate fired boilers operating on moist <b>fuel</b> <b>residues.</b> The {{aim of this}} study was to characterize fine particle emissions with a view to pinpoint parameters influencing the emissions. Additionally effectiveness of used flue gas cleaning techniques was assessed. The results show that large quantities of fine particles are emitted to the atmosphere from both boilers. From 1 MW boiler equipped only in multicyclone 4. 8 * 107 of particles/cm 3 (particles with diameter smaller than 0. 6 μm) are emitted to the atmosphere. From 6 MW boiler equipped in multicyclone, ESP and flue gas condenser 1. 7 * 106 of particles/cm 3 (< 0. 6 μm) end up in the atmosphere. Significant fluctuations in the coarse mode (1 - 10 μm) number concentration over time were observed in 1 MW boiler (between 100 and 10000 particles/cm 3) and these were much higher than in 6 MW boiler (between 6000 and 11000 particles/cm 3). Operating load showed to have a significant influence on coarse particles number concentration. Collection efficiency of ESP was assessed for about 96 % by number and 83 % by mass. Number concentration of particles passing through the flue gas condenser was close to unaltered, while mass concentration was reduced by half...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{studies were}} {{conducted}} to investigate the behavior of non-spread diffusion flames of liquid fuel soaked in porous sand beds of different depths. Sand bed depths from 50 to 80 mm and sand size of 1. 55 mm were chosen as the porous beds. Pure methanol {{was used as the}} liquid fuel. The effects of sand bed depth on flame temperature profile, position and thickness of the vapor/liquid coexisting region, vapor region moving speed, combustion duration time, fuel consumption, and amount of <b>fuel</b> <b>residues</b> in the porous beds were studied in the experiments. Theoretical analysis was conducted to account for the experimental results. The capillary effect and heat conduction are the controlling mechanisms of the processes. The capillary pressure decreases with increasing bed depth due to the effects of gravity. Thus, only when the fuel soaked in the ground is shallow enough, combustion can be applied for effective soil decontamination. The presented heat transfer model can quantitatively predict the interface position of the combustion of the liquid fuel in the porous bed and explain the appearing maximum value in the fuel consumption rate curves in the early stage of the combustion. These results confirmed that heat conduction is the dominant mode of heat transfer in the beginning stage of combustion...|$|R
