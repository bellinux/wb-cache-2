50|$|For {{ethylene}} oxide, {{metal oxide}} semiconductor sensors provide a low cost, long life detector, but they lack the sensitivity necessary to detect ethylene oxide at the OSHA PEL. Instead these sensors are used only as <b>gross</b> <b>leak</b> detectors. Gas chromatography offers excellent sensitivity and selectivity towards ethylene oxide, but the monitors tend to maintenance intensive and usually sample and analyze from several measuring points in sequence as opposed to providing continuous monitoring. Electrochemical sensors offer very good sensitivity, fast alarm response times and small size. ChemDAQ and most other gas monitor manufacturers mainly use electrochemical sensors for toxic gases because of their many advantages.|$|E
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of using an electrostatic bonding (ESB) and ultrasonic welding process to produce hermetic edge seals on terrestrial solar cell modules was investigated. The fabrication sequence is to attach an aluminum foil "gasket' to {{the perimeter of}} a glass sheet. A cell circuit is next encapsulated inside the gasket, and its aluminum foil back cover is seam welded ultrasonically to the gasket. An ESB process for sealing aluminum to glass was developed in an ambient air atmosphere, which eliminates the requirement for a vacuum or pressure vessel. An ultrasonic seam welding process was also developed which did not degrade {{the quality of the}} ESB seal. Good quality welds with minimal deformation were produced. The effectiveness of the above described sealing techniques was tested by constructing 400 sq cm (8 x 8 s 64 sq in) sample modules, and then subjecting them to nondestructive fine and <b>gross</b> <b>leak</b> tests. The <b>gross</b> <b>leak</b> tests identified several different causes of leaks which were then eliminated by modifying the assembly process...|$|E

40|$|London Ltd is {{used for}} {{sampling}} respirable dusts on to either 37 or 25 mm diameter filters. Potential leak problems using the 25 mm holder have been investigated here. Two sources of leaks may cause errors: (1) external leaks into the grit pot, or into the 25 mm filter holder, allow air to by-pass the cyclone {{and as a result}} large particles which should be removed by it are deposited directly on the filter, so that the amount of respirable dust in the air is overestimated; and (2) internal leaks due to a poor seal between the filter and the holder by-pass the filter and result in the respirable dust concentration being underestimated. A crude check for external leaks can be made by placing a finger over the cyclone inlet. The pump should stall if there are no leaks. If there is a <b>gross</b> <b>leak,</b> e. g. a split in the rubber grit pot, the pump will not be loaded and this can be readily heard. A more sophisticated, yet convenient, method of checking for both types of leaks is presented. It assumes the use of a calibrator pack, e. g. Dupont. Internal leaks are revealed by measuring the pressure drop across the filter in a leaktight holder, an...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{mechanical}} and electrical characterization of benzo-cyclo-butene (BCB) as a bonding and sealing material for 0 -level packages (cavities) housing (RF-) MEMS devices. Shear strength and hermeticity of BCB-sealed cavities are experimentally investigated as functions of the geometrical parameters of the BCB sealing ring and the bonding conditions. The leak rate of BCB-sealed cavities strongly depends on the BCB width, and leak rates as low as 10 (- 11) mbar l s(- 1) are measured for large BCB widths (> 800 mu m), dropping to 10 (- 8) mbar l s(- 1) for BCB widths of around 100 gm. Depending on the bonding conditions, shear strengths as high as 150 MPa are achieved. BCB is also used in 0 -level packaging of RF-MEMS devices, such as RF-switches,and coplanar waveguides (CPWs). The electrical influence of the 0 -level package is studied for different capping materials. It is experimentally shown that a 0 -level package using capping chips made of low-loss high-resistivity materials (AF 45 glass and high-resistivity silicon) and having a cavity height larger than about 45 mu m above RF-MEMS devices, has a negligible impact on the microwave characteristics of an RF-MEMS device. Finally, some reliability testing is performed on BCB-sealed 0 -level packages in order to study the influence of temperature and humidity on the mechanical properties of BCB. After testing in relatively harsh conditions, the BCB seal stays <b>gross</b> <b>leak</b> tight and shear strengths as high as 30 MPa are measured.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} {{mechanical}} ventilation is {{to rest the}} respiratory muscles while providing adequate gas exchange. Ventilatory support proved to be indispensable during the 1952 polio epidemic in Copenhagen, decreasing mortality among patients with paralytic polio from more than 80 % to approximately 40 %. 1 Despite the clear benefits of this therapy, many patients eventually die after the initiation of mechanical ventilation, even though their arterial blood gases may have normalized. This mortality has been ascribed to multiple factors, including complications of ventilation such as barotrauma (i. e., <b>gross</b> air <b>leaks),</b> oxygen toxicity, and hemodynamic compromise. 2, 3 During the polio epidemic, investigators noted that mechanical ventilation could cause structural damage to the lung. 4 In 1967, the term “respirator lung” was coined to describe the diffuse alveolar infiltrates and hyaline membranes that were found on postmortem examination of patients who had undergone mechanical ventilation. 5 More recently, {{there has been a}} renewed focus on the worsening injury that mechanical ventilation can cause in previously damaged lungs and the damage it can initiate in normal lungs. This damage is characterized pathologically by inflammatory-cell infiltrates, hyaline membranes, increased vascular permeability, and pulmonary edema. The constellation of pulmonary consequences of mechanical ventilation has been termed ventilator-induced lung injury. The concept of ventilator-induced lung injury is not new. In 1744, John Fothergill discussed a case of a patient who was “dead in appearance” after exposure to coal fumes and who was successfully treated by mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. 6 Fothergill noted that mouth-to-mouth resuscitation was preferable to using bellows because “the lungs of one man may bear, without injury, as great a force as those of another man can exert; which by the bellows cannot always be determin'd. ” Fothergill clearly understood the concept that mechanical forces generated by bellows (i. e., a ventilator) could lead to injury. However, it was not until early in this century that the clinical importance of ventilator-induced lung injury in adults was confirmed by a study showing that a ventilator strategy designed to minimize such injury decreased mortality among patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 7 Given the clinical importance of ventilator-induced lung injury, this article will review mechanisms underlying the condition, its biologic and physiological consequences, and clinical strategies to prevent it and mitigate its effects...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} an {{increasing}} interest for thin-film packaging techniques that can seal MEM devices at the wafer level. When these packages are fabricated using standard surface micromachining techniques, the need for wafer bonding equipment is eliminated. These packages not only ensure a stable environment for the devices, but also protect the packaged devices during further processing like dicing for example. This thesis presents the development of a thin-film wafer level packaging process flow with the use of polycrystalline silicon-germanium thin films. Poly-SiGe layers are developed with a low residual stress, a low stress gradient and a low electrical resistivity. &# 956;c-SiGe is identified as a locally porous layer {{that can be used in}} the packaging process to avoid deposition inside the cavity. Since poly-SiGe can be deposited at temperatures around 450 C, the developed packaging technology is CMOS compatible. This means that MEMS and its package can be deposited directly on top of a CMOS substrate. The contact between CMOS and MEMS is therefor characterized and optimized. A model is proposed to accurately extract the contact resistivity from measurements using a Stacked Greek Cross Resistor structure. An Ar soft sputter etch in combination with a Ti-TiN interlayer results in a contact resistivity of 5 10 &# 8722; 7 Ohm cm 2 for a 2 × 2 &# 956;m 2 contact size. This value is comparable with the state-of-the-art but the within wafer uniformity is one order of magnitude better than previously reported processes. Also the hermeticity of thin-film packages is evaluated. This is done using <b>gross</b> and fine <b>leak</b> tests. The packages were leaky for He. In air the packages sealed with AlCu have a leak rate that is lower than 5. 73 10 &# 8722; 16 mbar l/s. A further investigation is done using an encapsulated resonator to characterize the pressure inside the cavity. Resonator measurements show that the pressure inside a AlCu sealed cavity is near atmospheric pressure (1 atm). This high pressure inside the package is unexpected, but highly suitable to encapsulate accelerometers. Accelerometers were thus packaged using AlCu as a sealing layer as a proof of concept. After encapsulation, the accelerometers show to be free-moving and functional. Also measurements at low (0, 5, and 15 C) and high (125 C) temperatures indicate a stable environment. The medium-term hermeticity was checked for 6 weeks. For the first time shear tests are performed on thin-film packages to evaluate their mechanical strength. Different variations in design and processing of the anchors are tested. By using a Ti-TiN glue layer almost all structures meet the MIL-STD 883 E standard (method 2019. 5) specifications. If the ratio determined by the total SiGe-SiGe anchor area and the SiO 2 -SiGe anchor area is higher than 1, the thin film package reaches the MIL-standard requirements. These packages are able to resist a VHF release process. For the failing packages the cause is identified and understood. <w:latentstyles deflockedstate="false" defunhidewhenused="true"  <w:lsdexception="" locked="false" priority=" 0 " semihidden="false"  <w:lsdexceptionlocked="false"  status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|A low {{temperature}} multiple photoresist mold metal electroplating technology was developed. This {{technology can be}} utilized to fabricate metallic MEMS devices directly on substrates containing IC fabricated electronic devices by a post-IC process. Normal IC process flow is not affected by the add-on MEMS process. A further integrated packaging solution is also proposed with the same {{low temperature}} plating technology to supply the first-level, wafer scale package. The packaging process combines with the MEMS devices process seamlessly to unite the MEMS integration and packaging as a whole. Integration and packaging are considered together {{at the beginning of}} MEMS design which allows this technology to realize real batch fabrication and fulfill the task of low-cost manufacturing to meet the low-end application requirement. A packaged electrical inertia micro-switch was implemented. Separate and non-interfering photoresist-molded Au, Cu and PbSn solder metal-electroplating processes have been applied to the fabrication of the micro-switches and their wafer-level packaging in sealed cavities. The switches were designed using a simple but accurate lumped spring-mass model. The threshold velocity and natural frequency were calibrated by the drop hammer test and shaker test respectively. Testing results showed the good coincidence with the designed values. Packaging scheme supply the solution of independently control for the height of a switch and that of its cavity. It also provides leads for low-resistance electrical access to the sealed devices. The measured critical shear stress before packaging failure was around 30 MPa for all samples. Using both the <b>gross</b> <b>leak</b> and fine leak hermeticity tests, all the samples reached the requirement. An integrated floating gate electrostatic micro power generator was also implemented by the developed technology. The micro power generator was designed based on the technology of floating gate. The pre-charged floating gate by the TN tunneling technique acted as the voltage bias. Power is generated using a variable capacitor, formed between the resonator and the floating gate. A full analysis of the generator was done based on the system differential equations. A linear model for small signal input and a general model for nonlinearity analysis were built. Simulations were done using both models. The results from the two models corresponded well with each other. The properties of the electronic devices and the mechanical resonator were fully tested. The consistency of the electronic devices properties before and after the back-end process showed that the processing of the mechanical device has little effect on standard IC devices. Output power depending on the driving frequency and the resistant load was investigated using the shaker test. The maximum output power happened at the designed natural frequency. With an optimum load, the power generator worked at the pre-designed scale...|$|E
