I assume however, {{that he believes}} both that today’s good is certain, and that, as the promised date for future goods becomes increasingly distant, the probability of his consuming the goods decreases continuously to zero. For example, the probability might be the subjective mortality rate of a decision maker or the objective hazard rate of future goods. Under the assumptions specified above, the present paper shows that (<b>i)</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> maker exhibits the common ratio effect {{if and only if}} he discounts hyperbolically; (ii) he exhibits the certainty effect if and only if he discounts quasi-hyperbolically; and (iii) he exhibits the expected utility if and only if he is temporally unbiased (an exponential discounter) ...|$|E
40|$|It {{is often}} touted that decisiveness {{is one of}} the most {{important}} qualities to be possessed by leaders, broadly defined. To see how and why decisiveness can be a valuable asset in organizations, we construct a model of strategic information transmission where: (<b>i)</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> maker solicits opinions sequentially from experts; (ii) how many experts to solicit opinions from is the decision maker's endogenous choice. We show that communication is less efficient when the decision maker is indecisive and cannot resist the temptation to ask for a second opinion. This result suggests that the optimal diversity of information sources depends critically on the strategic nature of communication: when communication is strategic, it is optimal to delegate information acquisition to a single party and rely exclusively on it; when it is not, it is optimal to diversify information sources and aggregate them via communication...|$|E

Moreover, the proposed approach displays the results of queries through visualizations that are aimed at facing the screen estate problem typical of mobile devices. We will show how this approach can be applied to different domains by illustrating two examples of its application: (<b>i)</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> support tool that allows tourists to search for points of interest (e. g., hotels, restaurants, [...] .) that best satisfy their preferences and (ii) a tool allowing users to retrieve information about soil properties in a geographic area to meet a number of user’s constraints...|$|E

40|$|Warfarin {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used anticoagulants. Therapy is {{complicated}} by warfarin’s narrow therapeutic range and pronounced variability in individual dose requirements. Although warfarin therapy is uncommon in children, it is crucial for children with certain congenital or acquired heart diseases. Treatment in children is especially difficult due to the lack of <b>i)</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> support tool for efficient and consistent dose adjustments, and ii) a flexible warfarin formulation for accurate and reproducible dosing. The overall aim of this thesis was to develop a PKPD-based pharmacometric model for warfarin that describes the dose-response relationship over time, and to identify important predictors that influence individual dose requirements both in adults and children. Special emphasis was placed on investigating the contribution of genetic factors to the observed variability. A clinically useful pharmacometric model for warfarin has been developed using NONMEM. The model has been successfully reformulated into a KPD-model that describes the relationship between warfarin dose and INR response, and that is applicable to both adults and children. From a clinical perspective, this is a very important change since it allows the use of information on dose and INR that is available routinely. The model incorporates both patient and clinical characteristics, such as age, weight, CYP 2 C 9 and VKORC 1 genotype, and baseline and target INR, for the prediction of an individualised starting dose. It also enables the use of information from previous doses and INR observations to further individualise the dose a posteriori using a Bayesian forecasting method. The NONMEM model has been transferred to a user-friendly, platform independent tool to aid use in clinical practice. The tool can be used for a priori and a posteriori individualisation of warfarin therapy in both adults and children. The tool should ensure consistent dose adjustment practices, and provide more efficient individualisation of warfarin dosing in all patients, irrespective of age, body weight, CYP 2 C 9 or VKORC 1 genotype, baseline or target INR. The expected outcome is improved warfarin therapy compared with empirical dosing, with patients achieving a therapeutic and stable INR faster and avoiding high INRs that increase the risk of bleeding...|$|E
