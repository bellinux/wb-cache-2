5000|$|Dorothy {{was never}} a communist, but she {{inherited}} from her mother Molly a concern about social inequalities and a determination {{to do what she}} could to prevent armed conflict and, in particular, the threat of nuclear war. She became president of the Pugwash Conference in 1976 and served longer than any who preceded or succeeded her in this post. She stepped down in 1988, the year after the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty imposed [...] "a global ban on short- and long-range nuclear weapons systems, as well as an <b>intrusive</b> <b>verification</b> regime". She accepted the Lenin Peace Prize from the Soviet government in 1987 in recognition of her work for peace and disarmament.|$|E
40|$|The Convention {{provides}} the most extensive and <b>intrusive</b> <b>verification</b> regime of any arms control treaty, extending its coverage to not only governmental but also civilian facilities. The Convention also requires export controls and reporting requirements on chemicals {{that can be used}} as warfare agents and their precursors. The CWC establishes the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) to oversee the Convention's implementation. Chemical Weapons Convention implementing legislation, as S. 610, passed the Senate unanimously on May 23, 1997. This legislation, which was an amendment in the nature of a substitute reported from the Judiciary Committee, {{provides the}} statutory authority for domestic compliance with the Convention's provisions. It sets criminal and civil penalties for the development, production, acquisition, stockpiling, transfer, possession, or use of chemical weapons...|$|E
40|$|In 1993 the US and the Russian Federation {{signed an}} {{agreement}} allowing the US to purchase highly enriched uranium (HEU) from Russia over a 20 -year period. This Highly Enriched Uranium Purchase Agreement permits the purchase of 500 metric tons of HEU from dismantled Russian nuclear weapons {{in the form of}} low-enriched uranium (LEU) for use as power reactor fuel in the US. Under the HEU Agreement, the US and Russia are cooperating in a ''Transparency Program'' to ensure that arms control and nonproliferation objectives are being met. The Transparency Program measures, which are a departure from traditional, <b>intrusive</b> measures of <b>verification,</b> include sending individuals from the US to Russia to monitor the processing of the HEU...|$|R
40|$|The CWC bans the development, production, stockpiling, {{and use of}} {{chemical}} weapons by members signatories. It also requires the destruction of all chemical weapons stockpiles and production facilities. Neither the United States nor Russia {{will be able to}} meet the original CWC’s deadlines for destruction of their CW stockpiles, and have been granted extensions to at least 2012. The Convention provides the most extensive and <b>intrusive</b> <b>verification</b> regime of any arms control treaty, extending its coverage to not only governmental but also civilian facilities. The Convention also requires export controls and reporting requirements on chemicals that can be used as warfare agents and their precursors.

40|$|The United States and the Soviet Union {{recently}} signed a treaty that eliminates an entire class of nuclear arms, and allows more <b>intrusive</b> <b>verification</b> procedures than ever before. As technology improves and verification {{becomes even more}} central in arms control negotiations, Professor Koplow warns that the United States Constitution limits the types of verification procedures to which the United States can agree. After reviewing existing United States-Soviet Union arms control treaties and agreements, Professor Koplow examines potential verification procedures {{in light of the}} fourth amendment 2 ̆ 7 s protection of United States citizens from government intrusion. He argues that although many contemplated verification procedures could be implemented in this country, there are some that would not pass constitutional muster; some could be implemented only with a warrant of some kind, others could not be implemented at all. Professor Koplow concludes that the time is ripe for the United States to rethink its attitude toward verification of arms control agreements and to use the fourth amendment to guide and shape future negotiations and verification procedures...|$|E
40|$|The article {{compares the}} interplay between soft law {{institutions}} and those based on hard law in international efforts to protect the North Sea, reduce transboundary air pollution, and discipline fisheries subsidies. Our cases confirm that ambitious norms are more easily achieved in soft law institutions than in legally binding ones, but not primarily because they bypass domestic ratification or fail to raise concerns for compliance costs. More important is the greater flexibility offered by soft law instruments with respect to participation and sectoral emphasis. Second, ambitious soft law regimes put political pressure on laggards in negotiations over binding rules, but this effect is contingent on factors such as political saliency and reasonably consensual risk and option assessment. Third, hard-law instruments are subject to more thorough negotiation and preparation which, unless substantive targets have been watered down, makes behavioral change and problem solving more likely. Finally, {{although most of the}} evidence presented here confirms the implementation edge conventionally ascribed to hard law institutions, the structures for <b>intrusive</b> <b>verification</b> and review that provide part of the explanation can also be created within soft law institutions.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. An international system {{is necessary in}} a multi-polar world. The problem for today is learning how to develop cooperation, not just assume it. Most striking was the level of cooperation involved {{in the area of}} nuclear weapons. The United States and the Soviet Union signing of the Intermediate- Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in 1987 ushered in an unprecedented acceptance of <b>intrusive</b> <b>verification</b> measures. The puzzle surrounding this historic event is how the two sides managed to move from conflict to cooperation, from a zero-sum game to positive gains for both sides. Solving this puzzle may provide lessons that can be applied today to organizations such as the International Atomic Energy Agency and the United Nations Special Commission on Iraq. Solving this puzzle will also help students of international relations to better understand how nations learn to cooperate. The search for a new strategy in the post-Cold War era shows that reality is more complicated in a multi-polar environment. The simpler assumptions that explained the antagonistic situation no longer apply. An attempt must be made to find and develop those structures which may foster overall cooperation. Nations can learn to work together in an area vital to national security, arms control, by working together. Nations can learn by doing if the structure of the organization does not hinder the process. Sustained cooperation, therefore, can be a product and precondition of the organization through the structure of a given treaty. Captain, United States Arm...|$|E
