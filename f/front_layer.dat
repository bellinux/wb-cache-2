40|$|We {{present a}} multigrid solver for the {{exponential}} fitting method. The solver {{is applied to}} the current continuity equations of semiconductor device simulation in two dimensions. The exponential fitting method is based on a mixed finite element discretization using the lowest-order Raviart-Thomas triangular element. This discretization method yields a good approximation of <b>front</b> <b>layers</b> and guarantees current conservation. The corresponding stiffness matrix is an M-matrix. 'Standard' multigrid solvers, however, cannot be applied to the resulting system, as this is dominated by an unsymmetric part, which is due to the presence of strong convection in part of the domain. To overcome this difficulty, we explore the connection between Raviart-Thomas mixed methods and the nonconforming Crouzeix-Raviart finite element discretization. In this way we can construct nonstandard prolongation and restriction operators using easily computable weighted L(exp 2) -projections based on suitable quadrature rules and the upwind effects of the discretization. The resulting multigrid algorithm shows very good results, even for real-world problems and for locally refined grids...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} {{a study on}} the effect of the surface roughness of <b>front</b> TCO <b>layers</b> on the amorphous silicon solar cell performance. The same amorphous p-i-n silicon solar cell was deposited on four front ZnO substrates with different surface roughnesses.

The analysis of the spectral response of the solar cells shows that the haze factor alone of the <b>front</b> TCO <b>layer</b> is not sufficient to characterize fully its influence to the light trapping of an amorphous silicon solar cell. The structure of the TCO surface has to be taken into account, as the latter will directly influence the topology of the amorphous solar cell deposited on this layer and additionally affect the light trapping potential in the cell...|$|R

Two dimensional periodic nanotextures are fabricated using a combination of nanoimprint lithography and either dry or wet etching, while random pyramid texturing is used for benchmarking.
