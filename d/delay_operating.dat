40|$|Optical {{switches}} {{have been}} drawing attention {{due to their}} large data bandwidth and low power consumption. However, scheduling policies need {{to account for the}} schedule reconfiguration delay of optical switches to achieve good performance. The Adaptive MaxWeight policy achieves optimal throughput for switches with nonzero reconfiguration delay, and has been shown in simulation to have good delay performance. In this paper, we analyze the queue length behavior of a switch with nonzero reconfiguration <b>delay</b> <b>operating</b> under the Adaptive MaxWeight. We first show that the Adaptive MaxWeight policy exhibits a weak state space collapse behavior in steady-state, which could be viewed as an inheritance of the MaxWeight policy in a switch with zero reconfiguration delay. We then use the weak state space collapse result to obtain a steady state delay bound under the Adaptive MaxWeight algorithm in heavy traffic by applying a recently developed drift technique. The resulting delay bound is dependent on the expected schedule duration. We then derive the relation between the expected schedule duration and the steady state queue length through drift analysis, and obtain asymptotically tight queue length bounds in the heavy traffic regime.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} video coding in a joint source-channel setting. In particular, we propose a video encoding algorithm that prevents the indefinite propagation of errors in predictively encoded video [...] -a problem that has received considerable attention over the last decade. This is accomplished by periodically transmitting {{a small amount of}} additional information, termed coset information, to the decoder, as opposed to the popular approach of periodic insertion of intra-coded frames. Perhaps surprisingly, the coset information is capable of correcting for errors, without the encoder having a precise knowledge of the lost packets that resulted in the errors. In the context of real-time transmission, the proposed approach entails a minimal loss in performance over conventional encoding in the absence of channel losses, while simultaneously allowing error recovery in the event of channel losses. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach through experimental evaluation. In particular, the performance of the proposed framework is 3 [...] 4 dB superior to the conventional approach of periodic insertion of intra-coded frames, and 1. 5 [...] 2 dB away from an ideal system, with infinite decoding <b>delay,</b> <b>operating</b> at Shannon capacity...|$|E

40|$|Introduction The distal locking of an intramedullair tibia nail is {{the most}} time {{consuming}} during an operation. To reduce time, a lot of systems are developed to reduce the time to lock a nail. A reamed nail with a distal aiming device is compared with an unreamed nail to see benefit on operation time and reduction of complications. Material and methods A retrospective case-controlled study is performed from 2007 until 2009. A total of 75 patients were enrolled and placed in two groups. Group I received a reamed nail with use of a distal aiming device for locking, group II an unreamed nail. Data from the pre-, per- and postoperative period were collected. Results The groups were equal for sex and age. Not any difference was seen regarding the complications (infection, pain, failure, thrombosis, mal- and non-union) and time to union. The operation time the group treated with a reamed nail. (p= 0, 027). Discussion The amount of complications was higher {{in comparison with the}} literature; a difference in scoring could be the cause. The distal aiming device seemed to have an adverse effect on the operation time. A survey was carried out under the users which showed that further nail designs should have a special dynamisation hole and a more rigid aiming device. Conclusion No difference is seen between the reamed and unreamed group regarding complications and radiological consolidation. The use of a distal aiming device for the locking of the reamed nail seems to <b>delay</b> <b>operating</b> time instead of shortening it. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{report the}} {{experience}} of endovascular repair (ER) in patients with ruptured and symptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysms (rAAA and sAAA), comparing results with a cohort of controls who underwent open repair (OR) of sAAA or rAAA. DesignA historically controlled cohort study. MaterialsRetrospective data from 21 patients who underwent ER and prospective data from 23 patients who underwent OR. MethodsResults were compared using the Mann–Whitney U-test. ResultsEleven ER patients had sAAAs and 10 had rAAAs. Nine OR patients had rAAAs and 13 had sAAAs. Thirty-day mortality was 11 % in patients with rAAA in the ER group, and 54 % in the OR group (p= 0. 03). There were no post-operative deaths in the patients who had an sAAA in the ER group, and one death in the patients who had sAAA in the OR group. Results as expressed as mean ER value versus mean OR value and p-value. ER was associated with significant reductions in the length of operation (2. 6 versus 3. 1 h, p= 0. 03), blood transfusion requirements (0. 86 versus 10. 7 units p< 0. 01), time in critical care (1. 5 versus 6. 1 days, p= 0. 02), and total hospital stay (8. 5 versus 17. 5 days, p= 0. 01) compared with OR. There {{was no difference in}} time from admission to arrival in theatre between the two groups (3. 4 versus 5. 0 h, p= 0. 35).

40|$|There {{are various}} types of test {{performed}} on Integrated Circuits, (IC), for detecting and locating defects and faults during failure analysis. Functional, logic, parametric and IDDQ tests {{are among the most}} common. Functional IC tests are designed to verify whether the IC performs its intended function. Logic tests verify the logic operation of gates and registers. AC and DC parametric tests are used to measure time, voltage and current-varying parameters associated with the operational limits of the IC. Test parameters in parametric testing include, among others, propagation <b>delay,</b> <b>operating</b> current and signals rise and fall time. Currently, almost all ICs are manufactured or refurbished in Asia. A greater portion of the ICs are processed in China and Malaysia. Presently issues with component reliability are compromised since the ICs are not tested before they leave the factory, are sometimes only remarked with different part numbers and date codes or resold even though they do not work properly. These activities lead to a high level of uncertainty among consumers all over the world. The purpose of this research was the design of a software-defined semiconductor validation test system using the PCI eXtension for Instrumentation, (PXI), platform. The test system was to be capable of performing Open and Short Circuit Tests for CMOS components. Open and Short Circuit Tests verify for faults at the protection diode circuitry of CMOS chips level. The test system reduces the overall test timing compared to the tests performed by a functional instrument such as a curve tracer. PXI is a modular instrumentation platform originally introduced in 1997 by National Instruments, (NI). PXI is an open, PC-based platform for test, measurement and control. PXI possesses the highest bandwidth and lowest latency with modular inputs and outputs for high-resolution from DC to RF frequencies. PXI was designed for measurement and automation applications that require high-performance.

40|$|Reducing {{the energy}} {{required}} per operation {{is the key}} to building ultra-low energy systems, and the most effective way of achieving this is to reduce the supply voltage. However, operating CMOS circuits at low supply voltages increases circuit delay, leading to lower circuit performance. In this region, the sub-threshold leakage energy component becomes more pronounced and can even dominate the total circuit energy. Increasing threshold voltages reduces the amount of leakage, but this forces operation in the sub-threshold region where performance and variability become exponentially worse. The use of the sense amplifier-based pass transistor logic (SAPTL) topology is one approach to reducing the energy per operation. It uses an inverted pass transistor logic (PTL) tree, which inherently has no gain, and hence no power supply connections, eliminating the sources of sub-threshold leakage current. Reducing the threshold voltages of the PTL transistors improves performance, without the leakage current increase associated with conventional static CMOS logic. This reduced threshold voltage also allows the PTL transistors to operate in the super-threshold region, even for very low supply voltages, avoiding the increased delay and variability associated with the sub-threshold operating regime. Gain is introduced by using drivers and sense amplifiers (SAs) that restore the output voltage swing and provide the appropriate output current to drive the fan-out capacitances. These drivers and SAs are the primary source of sub-threshold leakage, which can be amortized by making the PTL networks complex, and by applying various leakage reduction techniques. SAPTL-based 90 nm test circuits using both synchronous and asynchronous timing schemes have been designed, fabricated and tested. These circuits show leakage and energy characteristics better than the equivalent static CMOS circuits. These test chips also demonstrate rudimentary SAPTL-based design flows using commercially available CAD tools. Simulation and measurement results of basic synchronous SAPTL building blocks show a 40 X- 50 X reduction in standby current and a 6 X reduction in energy when compared to an equivalent CMOS logic block, at the expense of a 10 X- 30 X increase in <b>delay.</b> <b>Operating</b> the SAPTL asynchronously reduces the average delay by 89 %. However, adding the necessary handshaking circuitry increases the energy by 31 %. These SAPTL building blocks are used to create a parallel 64 -byte asynchronous SAPTL-based CRC generator with a minimum energy point that is 25 % lower than that of the static CMOS equivalent, with a 6 X delay penalty. Also, {{due to the nature of}} the PTL tree, forward-biasing the body of the PTL transistors results in a 10 % reduction in delay with no energy penalty. The advantages of the SAPTL over conventional static CMOS is expected to be more significant as technology continues to scale, where subthreshold leakage continue to prevent supply voltages from being aggressively scaled...|$|E
