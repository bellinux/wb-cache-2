Rheological testing included two empirical rheological methods, <b>farinograph</b> and alveograph, and more fundamental creep-recovery experiments at shear stresses of 100 and 250 Pa. Principal component analysis on the <b>farinograph</b> and alveograph results showed that a wide range of {{rheological properties}} was present among the wheat cultivars. Correlation analysis pointed out that creep-recovery parameters showed significant correlations with protein content, Zeleny sedimentation value, <b>farinograph</b> water absorption, alveograph extensibility and bread volume.

40|$|Because of {{the belief}} that the {{rheological}} properties of wheat fl our and dough are related to the flour quality and its processing characteristics, they are of great importance in the baking and milling industries. The <b>Farinograph,</b> Extensograph, Amylograph and Alveograph tests are the most common empirical tests used for assessing rheological properties of wheat dough. Recently, new rheological tool for wheat fl our characterization, called Mixolab, has been developed. The advantage of using Mixolab is that one can measure protein and starch characteristics in a single test. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the relationships between Mixolab parameters and parameters obtained using <b>Farinograph</b> and Amylograph among flour samples of different technological quality.

40|$|The {{effect of}} low water {{contents}} and xylanases on wheat dough rheology is reported. <b>Farinograph,</b> dynamic oscillation, and creep-recovery measurements were performed using water concentrations from 34 to 44. 8 % (total basis).

Addition of an endoxylanase with a higher selectivity for water-unextractable arabinoxylans and an endoxylanase with a higher selectivity for water-extractable arabinoxylans both resulted in lower G' and <b>Farinograph</b> dough consistencies {{and an increase in}} maximum creep compliance.

Analysing {{wheat flour}} composites with hemp, teff, or chia {{in terms of}} all three mentioned rheological methods, correspondence of <b>farinograph,</b> and amylograph versus mixolab features was examined by principal component analysis. The first two principal components, PC 1 and PC 2, explained 75 % of data scatter and allowed a satisfying confirmation of presumed relationships between <b>farinograph</b> or amylograph and mixolab parameters. Dough development time and stability were associated with gluten strength (C 1 torque point) and also dough softening (mixing tolerance index) had a link to protein weakening (C 1 -C 2 difference). In the second mentioned case, amylograph viscosity maximum and amylase activity (C 3 -C 4) closeness was verified. Starch and starch gel properties during mixing (C 3, C 3 -C 2, and C 4) affect dough viscosity (C 1) and rheological behaviour (dough development time and stability).

Mixing characteristics of commercial and reformulated corn dry masa flours (DMF) were evaluated using a mixograph and a <b>farinograph.</b> The objectives were to evaluate the potential use of the mixograph and <b>farinograph</b> to study DMF mixing and hydration properties and also to evaluate the use of the Rapid Visco Analyzer (RVA), consistometer and penetrometer to study DMF properties. The effect of sample size, moisture level, mixing speed, temperature, particle size distribution and CMC level on the mixing characteristics of DMF were evaluated. Reformulated and commercial flours with and without CMC were also evaluated using a consistometer, penetrometer, RVA and also were subjectively evaluated for their machinability properties. Reduced moisture levels produced firmer masas which produced higher and wider curves. At increased moisture levels masa develops maximum consistency and stickiness faster. Excess water produced soft masas that exhibited decreased maximum consistency. Three stages were observed during mixing. The first stage involves hydration of the DMF causing the curve to go up. During the second stage, masa develops cohesiveness; the curve becomes wider and reaches maximum consistency. During the third stage, masa becomes sticky due to overmixing and the curve becomes narrower and lower. Mixing stages were developed at different times reflecting differences among DMF. Finer DMF required less mixing time to reach maximum consistency and to develop stickiness, whereas coarser flours produced firmer masas with increased maximum consistency. Masas from DMF containing 0. 5 % CMC exhibited the highest maximum consistency, while time to reach maximum consistency increased along with CMC level. Reduced penetrometer readings and shorter distances traveled in the consistometer, as well as increased viscosities in the RVA were significantly correlated to increased maximum consistency in the mixograph and <b>farinograph.</b> Subjective machinability determinations were also significantly correlated to mixograph and <b>farinograph</b> parameters. The mixograph and <b>farinograph</b> are simple techniques with acceptable repeatability to detect differences in mixing characteristics of DMF. Mixograph and <b>farinograph</b> as well as consistometer, penetrometer and RVA have potential for rapid evaluation of DMF properties and mixing performance in a quality control program...|$|E
40|$|Demand for health-oriented bakery {{products}} with low sugar, low fat and high fibre contents is increasing. Incorporating dietary fibre in biscuit dough tends to require some increase in its hydration level depending on fibre types and contents.

In {{order to improve}} {{the understanding of the}} impact of dietary fibre on dough processing and properties, two complementary approaches are proposed. The first is a sensory description, that helps formalize the hydration correction of biscuit dough enriched in fibre. The second focuses on the prediction of biscuit dough hydration, based on the evaluation of fibre and sugar water holding capacity (WHC) with the <b>Farinograph.</b> A polynomial model was used to describe the <b>Farinograph</b> water absorption versus the powder content. The WHC was computed from data obtained with the <b>Farinograph,</b> and it was used in biscuit dough {{in order to try to}} predict biscuit dough hydration. This model was compared to the actual added water, evaluated by the sensory methodology. A simple relationship was found between the actual and predicted amount of water.

Our purpose in the present research is to apply soft computation tools for predicting the rheological properties of dough out of simple measurable factors. Materials and Methods: One hundred samples of white flour were collected from different provinces of Iran. Seven physic-chemical properties of flour and Farinogram parameters of dough were selected as neural network’s inputs and outputs, respectively. Trial-and-error and genetic algorithm (GA) were applied for developing an artificial neural network (ANN) with an optimized structure. Feed-forward neural networks with a back-propagation learning algorithm were employed. Sensitivity {{analyses were conducted to}} explore the ability of inputs in changing the <b>Farinograph</b> properties of dough. Results: The optimal neural network is an ANN-GA that evolves a four-layer network with eight nodes in the first hidden layer and seven neurons in the second hidden layer. The average of normalized mean square error, mean absolute error and correlation coefficient in estimating the test data set was 0. 222, 0. 124 and 0. 953, respectively. According to the results of sensitivity analysis, gluten index was selected as the most important physicochemical parameter of flour in characterization of dough’s <b>Farinograph</b> properties.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of supplementing wheat flour with 5, 10, and 15 % seinat seed proteins on physicochemical, nutritional and sensory properties of bread. Seinat seeds protein concentrate (SSPC) and seinat seeds protein isolates (SSPI) were added to wheat flour (WF) to make bread. Dough characteristics were studied using a Brabender <b>Farinograph</b> and Extensograph. Loaves were prepared by using the straight dough procedure. Water absorption was increased (p< 0. 05) as the protein level in the blends increased. The dough stability time decreased (p< 0. 05...|$|E
