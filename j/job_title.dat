5|$|Furthermore, {{the title}} Cakravarti {{seem to have}} been {{commonly}} used in the Pandyan kingdom as a caste or <b>job</b> <b>title.</b> Compound titles exist, such as Maravacakravarti that belonged to a Maravar chief as well as Malavacakravarti that belonged to a Malava chief. Ariyar in Tamil could denote a noble or a learned person, a Brahmin or alternatively a person from Aryavarta. Thus the title Arayacakravarti seems to fit the structure of similarly used titles across the Pandyan kingdom.|$|E

In those cases where there were statistically significant differences, English <b>job</b> <b>titles</b> were evaluated worse than their Dutch counterparts, while <b>jobs</b> with English <b>titles</b> were assessed more positively, were thought to have higher salaries, and were on the whole considered to be more international. Contrary to what is suggested in the literature, where there were significant differences, <b>jobs</b> with English <b>titles</b> were not considered more gender-neutral, but in fact were perceived to be more male-oriented than their Dutch equivalents. Although no statistically {{significant differences were found between}} the associations evoked by equivalent English and Dutch <b>job</b> <b>titles,</b> our findings support the hypothesis, formulated with respect to English in advertising in non-English-speaking countries, that English words do not just have referential meaning but also carry symbolic value...|$|R
5|$|Despite his <b>job</b> <b>title</b> as a composer, Mitsuda {{worked as}} a sound effects {{designer}} for two years. In 1994, after threatening to quit to Square's vice president, Hironobu Sakaguchi, {{he was assigned to}} compose the soundtrack to Chrono Trigger.

In 1998, Mitsuda left Square to work as a freelance composer, founding his own music production studio in 2001, Procyon Studio, as well as his own record label, Sleigh Bells. Although Mitsuda continues to compose for video games, he began to produce music in other forms of media beginning in the 2010s, including various anime series, films, and television specials, as well as his own independent albums.|$|E
5|$|He {{accepted}} a teaching {{position in the}} Department of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Cincinnati, having decided on Cincinnati over other universities, including his alma mater, Purdue, because it had a small aerospace department; he hoped that the faculty members would not be annoyed that he came straight into a professorship with only the USC master's degree. He began the work while stationed at Edwards years before, and finally completed it after Apollo11 by presenting a report on various aspects of Apollo, instead of a thesis on the simulation of hypersonic flight. The official <b>job</b> <b>title</b> he received at Cincinnati was University Professor of Aerospace Engineering.

25|$|This was when, in 1989, the {{profession}} of the Rettungsassistent was created, introducing a two-year education program.

25|$|Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, {{the field}} {{continued}} to evolve, although in large measure, {{on a local}} level. In the broader scheme of things the term 'ambulance service' was replaced by 'emergency medical service' to reflect the change from a transportation system to a system that provides actual medical care. The training, knowledge base, and skill sets of both paramedics and emergency medical technicians (both competed for the <b>job</b> <b>title,</b> and 'EMT-Paramedic' was a common compromise) were typically determined by what local medical directors were comfortable with, what {{it was felt that}} the community needed, and what could actually be afforded. There were also tremendous local differences in the amount and type of training required, and how it would be provided. This ranged from in-service training in local systems, through community colleges, and ultimately even to universities. During the evolution of paramedicine, a great deal of both curriculum and skill set {{was in a state of}} constant flux. Permissible skills evolved in many cases at the local level, and were based upon the preferences of physician advisers and medical directors. Treatments would go in and out of fashion, and sometimes, back in again. The use of certain drugs, Bretylium for example, illustrate this. In some respects, the development seemed almost faddish. Technologies also evolved and changed, and as medical equipment manufacturers quickly learned, the pre-hospital environment was not the same as the hospital environment; equipment standards that worked fine in hospitals could not cope well with the less controlled pre-hospital environment.|$|E

The side for gender-neutral <b>job</b> <b>titles</b> usually makes an ideological argument, that gender-specific <b>job</b> <b>titles</b> at some level promote sexism in the workplace. The side for the more traditional, gender-specific terms usually makes a practical argument, that replacing the historical terms everywhere they appear (in documents, etc.) would be difficult and expensive, or that it is unnecessary. However, there are many (in particular feminists) who would claim that this argument is really a backlash against the argument for gender-neutral language.|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} to all the training usually given to Chemical Technologists in their respective degree (or one given via an associate degree), a Chemist is also trained to understand more details related to chemical phenomena so that the chemist can be capable of more planning on the steps to achieve a distinct goal via a chemistry-related endeavor. The higher the competency level achieved {{in the field of}} Chemistry (as assessed via a combination of education, experience and personal achievements), the higher the responsibility given to that chemist and the more complicated the task might be. Chemistry, as a field, have so many applications that different tasks/objectives can be given to workers/scientists with these different levels of education and/or experience. The specific title of each job varies from position to position, depending on factors such as the kind of industry, the routine level of the task, the current needs of a particular enterprise, the size of the enterprise or hiring firm, the philosophy and management principles of the hiring firm, the visibility of the competency and individual achievements of the one seeking employment, economic factors such as recession or economic depression, among other factors, so this makes it difficult to categorize the exact roles of these chemistry-related workers as standard for that given level of education. Because of these factors affecting exact job titles with distinct responsibilities, some chemists might begin doing technician tasks while other chemists might begin doing more complicated tasks than those of a technician, such as tasks that also involve formal applied research, management, or supervision included within the responsibilities of that same <b>job</b> <b>title.</b> The level of supervision given to that chemist also varies in a similar manner, with factors similar to those that affect the tasks demanded for a particular chemist.|$|E
