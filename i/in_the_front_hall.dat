25|$|Inside this residence, {{the house}} {{originally}} {{had a very}} simple interior, with a large living room {{to the right of}} the front door, a simple dining room straight ahead, a long hallway to the left of the front door, a simple spiral staircase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>hall,</b> and a small kitchen and servants' quarters in the back (now a bigger kitchen). In the interior of the house, the forms of the rooms were simple but combined to make a more complex structure like Breuer and Gropius advocated. The house has four bedrooms and four bathrooms.|$|E
500|$|Finds {{especially}} in Pompeii show the so-called Roman goddess Venus wearing a bikini. A {{statue of the}} so-called Venus in a bikini {{was found in a}} cupboard in the southwest corner in Casa della Venere, others were found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>hall.</b> A statue of the so-called Venus was recovered from the tablinum of the house of Julia Felix, and another from an atrium in the garden at Via Dell'Abbondanza. Naples National Archaeological Museum, which opened its limited viewing gallery of more explicit exhibits in 2000, also exhibits a [...] "Venus in Bikini". However, the Naples National Archaeological Museum is keen to stress that this statue actually depicts her Greek counterpart Aphrodite as she is about to untie her sandal, a common theme among other works depicting Aphrodite. The museum's exhibits include female statues wearing see-through gold lamé brassiere, basque and knickers. The Kings of Naples discovered these Pompeii artifacts, including the one meter tall, almost unclothed statue of Venus painted in gold leaf with something like a modern bikini. They found them so shocking that for long periods the secret chamber was opened only to [...] "mature persons of secure morals". Even after the doors were opened, only 20 visitors were to be admitted at a time, and children under 12 were not allowed into the new part of the museum without their parents' or a teacher's permission.|$|E
2500|$|Prominent {{original}} exterior {{features include}} carved limestone detail, numerous false chimneys, steeply pitched slate roofs, and a seven-story clock tower. While {{it is not}} known for certain that Columbia High School was inspired by any earlier structures, there is a strong resemblance to Laynon Hall at Queen's University of Belfast. At {{the very top of the}} clock tower is a copper pyramidal structure. The entire pyramid structure rotates, and one side opens, serving as an observatory. The observatory is equipped with a large refracting telescope made by John Brashear. [...] That telescope is no longer functional, but there is a more modern Celestron C11 reflecting telescope that is used by students. Two levels below are the E. Howard & Co. Style #3 clock works. Alongside the clock is an enormous bronze bell by the Meneely Bell Foundry. Inside the school can be found rooms with fireplaces, hallways with beautiful faience wall tiles by John Scott Award recipient Herman Carl Mueller of Trenton, and mosaic inlaid terrazzo floors <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>hall.</b> The front foyer was recently renovated, removing non-period lighting and mid-century acoustic tile. The restoration included doors that more closely replicated the 1926 originals, a new terrazzo floor, and dramatic lighting of the zodiac-inspired plaster ceiling. Recently, dubious student art dating from as far back as the 1970s was painted over, among other improvements. The auditorium includes a three-manual Ernest M. Skinner Organ. Although it is little used and not completely functional, the organ is one of the few unmodified Skinners in existence and has received an Organ Historical Society citation. Regrettably, on either side of the stage the large plaster grills that hide the organ pipes were water damaged. The original auditorium chandeliers have also been removed. A similar story exists with regard to the swimming pool; while the original vaulted Catalan Guastavino tile ceiling remains, the chandeliers are gone, and a giant arched window is blocked by a later addition.|$|E
5000|$|Valluvar Kottam is a popular monument in Chennai, {{dedicated}} to the classical Tamil poet, philosopher, and saint, Thiruvalluvar who wrote his famous Thirukkural some 2,000 years ago. All 133 chapters and 1330 verses of the Thirukkural are inscribed on bas-relief <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>hall's</b> corridors.

6000|$|The {{occasions}} {{which brought}} us to New York together were not nearly so frequent as those which united us in Boston, {{but there was a}} dinner given him by a friend which remains memorable from the fatuity of two men present, so different in everything but their fatuity. One was the sweet old comedian Billy Florence, who was urging the unsuccessful dramatist across the table to write him a play about Oliver Cromwell, and giving the reasons why he thought himself peculiarly fitted to portray the character of Cromwell. The other was a modestly millioned rich man who was then only beginning to amass the moneys afterward heaped so high, and was still in the condition to be flattered by the condescension of a yet greater millionaire. His contribution to our gaiety was the verbatim report of a call he had made upon William H. Vanderbilt, whom he had found just about starting out of town, with his trunks actually <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>hall,</b> but who had stayed to receive the narrator. He had, in fact, sat down on one of the trunks, and talked with the easiest friendliness, and quite, we were given to infer, like an ordinary human being. Clemens often kept on with some thread of the talk when we came away from a dinner, but now he was silent, as if [...] "high sorrowful and cloyed"; and it was not till well afterward that I found he had noted the facts from the bitterness with which he mocked the rich man, and the pity he expressed for the actor.|$|E
