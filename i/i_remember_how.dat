500|$|In Washington, {{the company}} was {{quartered}} in the Ladies' Gallery of the Senate Chamber, in the Capitol. The 350 Pennsylvania troops who first reached Washington on April 18 {{became known as the}} First Defenders and, after the war, the survivors formed an association with that name. While they were lodged at the Capitol, President Lincoln, Secretary of State William H. Seward, and Secretary of War Simon Cameron visited. Bosbyshell recalled Lincoln, [...] "yes, here, towering over all in the room was the great central figure of the war. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> I was impressed by the kindliness of his face and awkward hanging of his arms and legs, his apparent bashfulness in the presence of these first soldiers of the Republic, and with it all a grave, rather mournful bearing in his attitude." ...|$|E
500|$|Fink {{does not}} know how long her {{character}} will be featured on Glee. When asked about what she likes about her character, Fink said: [...] "I think what I love about Lauren is she's so strong and so confident and she knows what she wants and I feel very blessed to play a role model for people who have ever felt other or different. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> I used to feel watching TV and seeing Sara Rue on Popular because she was an inspiration to me. It's funny because what I love about Lauren is that she's unapologetic and she's confident and she's making Puck work for it and she's not just looking for a roll in the hay. I think that they are very sweet together, there is this vulnerability when they are both such bad asses and you put them together and I think there is something really special there. What I appreciate about Lauren is that she's like I don't need to give it to you, you're going to work for it, and I think that's a great message to send to young girls. I think that he is smitten and she is probably a little smitten too but I think she has enough self esteem not to give everything up for the charming cute boy that's kind of after her." [...] Kevin Fallon, a writer for The Atlantic, reacted favorably to the casting of Fink: [...] "Glee hit the trifecta this year with its three major cast additions. First there were Darren Criss—who's exploded with popularity—and Chord Overstreet. Now there's Ashley Fink's Lauren. And while the tough-only-on-the-outside Lauren can deliciously out-sass Santana Lopez, it's her straight-talking that really has me sold." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1940, Ziolkowski spent three weeks with Standing Bear at Pine Ridge, South Dakota, {{discussing}} land ownership issues and learning about Crazy Horse and the Lakota way of life. According to Ziolkowski, [...] "Standing Bear grew very angry when {{he spoke of the}} broken Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868). That was the one I'd read about in which the President promised the Black Hills would belong to the Indians forever. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> his old eyes flashed out of that dark mahogany face, then he would shake his head and fall silent for a long while." ...|$|E
6000|$|I was in despair. Then, suddenly, <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>how</b> one fright {{could destroy}} another fright, and I frowned {{up at him}} and shouted sternly: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Pity I hadn't brought mine--I do so {{well with}} it,' I said, and I laughed as <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> aimed at Joe and hurt myself.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Are you married, Jack?' says <b>I,</b> <b>remembering</b> <b>how</b> consumedly in love he {{was with}} his cousin Letty Lovelace, when the Cuttykilts were {{quartered}} at Strathbungo some twenty years ago.|$|R
2500|$|By 1942 {{she was a}} star in the Chicago area, {{performing}} at the Rhumboogie Club. The band leader and arranger Marl Young who worked at the club recognised her talent and signed her under contract to the then famous Club DeLisa. [...] A year later, the future owner of Atlantic Records, Ahmet Ertegun, heard her sing in Washington DC and wrote in his memoirs:"1943, I was about 19 years old; I went to a nightclub in the northeast black district of Washington DC and heard a singer named Little Miss Cornshucks and thought: 'Oh God!' She was better than anything I had heard so far. She came across like a country girl, provided with a headscarf and a basket in her hand and so on; but she could sing the blues better than anyone I've heard to date. That night I asked her if I could record a record with her. We then played Kansas City and a few other blues numbers and the song So Long. She had such a wonderful sound and <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> I always thought, 'Oh my God, and I have no record company; I can make the drive just for myself.'" [...] "So Long" [...] became her signature tune and a regional hit in 1943 for the short-lived Sunbeam label.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> {{she looked}} at me, expectantly, yet timidly, almost fearfully. I kissed her.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no--but <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how,</b> {{about our}} having, in our benighted innocence, no position, you quite crushed me with your explanation." ...|$|E
60|$|All {{this might}} have been very true, but <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> had sat and walked and thought and worried about Rectus, and his {{explanation}} did me no good.|$|R
6000|$|She thought {{like one}} inspired, and <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>how</b> Corvick {{had told me}} long before that her face was interesting. [...] "Perhaps it won't go in a letter if it's 'immense.'" ...|$|R
60|$|And then <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>how</b> {{the artistic}} critics have always praised the grave tints and the grim {{shadows of the}} {{crumbling}} cloisters and abbey towers, and how they themselves often dress up like Gothic ruins in the sombre tones of dim grey walls or dark green ivy. <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>how</b> they hated almost all primary things, but especially primary colours. I knew they were appreciating much more delicately and truly than I the sublime skeleton and the mighty fungoids of the dead Glastonbury. But I stood for an instant alive in the living Glastonbury, gay with gold and coloured like the toy-book of a child.|$|R
60|$|The {{room was}} a {{pleasant}} one, {{at the top of}} the house, overlooking the sea, on which the moon was shining brilliantly. After I had said my prayers, and the candle had burnt out, <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> I still sat looking at the moonlight on the water, as if I could hope to read my fortune in it, as in a bright book; or to see my mother with her child, coming from Heaven, along that shining path, to look upon me as she had looked when I last saw her sweet face. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> the solemn feeling with which at length I turned my eyes away, yielded to the sensation of gratitude and rest which the sight of the white-curtained bed--and how much more the lying softly down upon it, nestling in the snow-white sheets!--inspired. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> I thought of all the solitary places under the night sky where I had slept, and how I prayed that I never might be houseless any more, and never might forget the houseless. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> I seemed to float, then, down the melancholy glory of that track upon the sea, away into the world of dreams.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how,</b> {{after our}} third bout of talking, I walked {{back through the}} streets of Utopian London to rejoin the {{botanist}} at our hotel.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And revenge,' added Mrs. Brown-Smith. 'I {{have heard}} of his bragging, the monster. He has talked about me. And <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> he treated Violet Lebas.' ...|$|E
5000|$|... “I guess <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>how</b> to drive, and I {{guess this}} team <b>remembered</b> <b>how</b> to do it,” Johnson said in victory lane. “I'm just real {{proud of this}} team. What a tough track and tough conditions. We were really in our {{wheelhouse}} {{and we were just}} able to execute all day.” ...|$|R
60|$|Captain Dan {{was in his}} element. He saw victory perched {{upon the}} mast of the Leta D. He moved with a {{celerity}} that amazed me, when <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>how</b> exasperatingly slow he could be, fooling with kites. This was Captain Dan's game.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{too late}} to talk like that," [...] I replied, smiling as <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>how</b> eager my partner had been to go as a soldier when I was hanging back. [...] "We're like to see an hundred times worse than this before we're many hours older." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I will. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> pretty she is," [...] said Dorothea, into whose mind every {{impression}} about Rosamond had cut deep. [...] "I {{hope she}} will like me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In great form. I {{forgot to}} ask what you called him; I've named him Hotspur--he'll never be steady at his fences. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> he pulled with you that day." ...|$|E
60|$|The barking of the {{vigilant}} dogs {{had drawn}} me instantly to the door, and <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> positively certain I then felt that Sidney had kissed Mariposilla during her groundward journey.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> had fainted Christmas morning, and how gladly I had regained {{consciousness}} in the protecting {{presence of the}} little Mother. I knew that the Doña Maria would gain strength and courage before the shrine of her implicit faith, and my own heart hungered for a touch of palpable comfort.|$|R
60|$|The {{hollow of}} the arch gave back Learoyd's broken whisper in a bass boom. Mulvaney {{looked at me}} hopelessly, but <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>how</b> the madness of despair had once fallen upon Ortheris, that weary, weary {{afternoon}} in {{the banks of the}} Khemi River, and how it had been exorcised by the skilful magician Mulvaney.|$|R
60|$|They were {{pointing}} {{to the ground as}} though they examined spoor in the sand. I heard the man say something about the dogs not daring to enter the territory of the Mountain, a remark which came back to my mind again after Leo had told me his dream. Then <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>how</b> we were placed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> you {{afterwards}} {{put it to}} me. Though it {{was nothing}} more," [...] Susie did herself the justice to observe, [...] "than what I too had quite felt." ...|$|E
60|$|As we {{surveyed}} this, Lady Tarvrille appeared, back from some party, a slender, white-cloaked, satin-footed figure with amazed blue eyes beneath her golden hair. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> stupidly we {{laughed at her}} surprise.|$|E
60|$|COOK. Ah! <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> {{he used to}} {{fall down}} when he was little--he would go about with {{his head in the}} air. But he always picked himself up like a little man.|$|E
60|$|Particularly, <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> {{standing}} {{with my father}} on the wharf when a large ship was getting under way, and rounding {{the head of the}} pier. <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> the yo heave ho! of the sailors, as they just showed their woolen caps above the high bulwarks. <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> thought of their crossing the great ocean; and that that very ship, and those very sailors, so near to me then, would after a time be actually in Europe.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, then, take no note of him, but let him go; and {{presently}} {{call the}} rest of the watch together, and thank God you are rid of a knave.' When <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>how</b> Lady Georgina had hob-nobbed with the Count from Ostend to Malines, I agreed to a great extent both with her and with Dogberry.|$|R
60|$|Across {{the marsh}} {{was a tiny}} square of orange-coloured light, from the farm-house with the low, {{spreading}} roof. <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>how</b> {{the man and his}} wife and the children worked on till dark, silent and intent, carrying the hay in their arms out of the streaming thunder-rain into the shed, working silent in the soaking rain.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am heartily glad, for {{you were}} very useful. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> Cantrip almost cried {{when he told me}} you were going to leave him. He had been rather put upon, I fancy, before." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{always loved}} her, Harry. Oh, dear, <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> unhappy {{that made me}} once, and I was so afraid that Hugh would suspect it. She would never have done for you; would she, Harry?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, {{she read}} it to father and me down by the cove," [...] said Sally, [...] "the {{afternoon}} that you {{came home from the}} Banks; <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> we saw you coming in; don't you, Mara?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Like a bull moose," [...] said Lister with a frown. [...] "I {{ought to}} have kept cool, used caution, and frozen him off by a few short {{arguments}}. You can picture Cartwright's putting across the job! After all, however, I don't know the arguments I could have used, and <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>how</b> the fellow had injured you--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So you did. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> now. <b>How</b> extraordinary----" [...] Tuppence tailed {{off into}} silence. Suddenly she aroused herself. [...] "Tommy!" ...|$|R
60|$|My astonishment {{somewhat}} prevented me from replying to this, too. Was {{it possible}} that Mr. Wharton meant to sue the General? I reflected while he paused. <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>how</b> inconspicuous he had named me, and hope died. Mr. Wharton {{did not look at}} me, but stared into the fire, for he was plainly not a man to rail and rant.|$|R
