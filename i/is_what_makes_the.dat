25|$|Often, these subgenres are blended, blurred or {{overlapped}} {{to create}} second-generation subgenres.

25|$|Meditations are {{reflective}} thought poems. Like the Montage and the Series subgenres, Meditations can {{be somewhat}} fragmented, yet their connectivity <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> long poem a coherent and cohesive idea.

25|$|Finding a modular {{multiplicative inverse}} has many {{applications}} in algorithms {{that rely on}} the theory of modular arithmetic. For instance, in cryptography the use of modular arithmetic permits some operations {{to be carried out}} more quickly and with less storage requirements, while other operations become more difficult. Both of these features can be used to advantage. In particular, in the RSA algorithm, encrypting and decrypting a message is done using a pair of numbers that are multiplicative inverses with respect to a carefully selected modulus. One of these numbers is made public and {{can be used in a}} rapid encryption procedure, while the other, used in the decryption procedure, is kept hidden. Determining the hidden number from the public number is considered to be computationally infeasible and this <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> system work to ensure privacy.|$|E
25|$|When a {{bacterium}} detects environmental conditions are becoming unfavourable it may {{start the process}} of endosporulation, which takes about eight hours. The DNA is replicated and a membrane wall known as a spore septum begins to form {{between it and the}} rest of the cell. The plasma membrane of the cell surrounds this wall and pinches off to leave a double membrane around the DNA, and the developing structure is now known as a forespore. Calcium dipicolinate, the calcium salt of dipicolinic acid, is incorporated into the forespore during this time. The dipicolinic acid helps stabilize the proteins and DNA in the endospore. Next the peptidoglycan cortex forms between the two layers and the bacterium adds a spore coat to the outside of the forespore. In the final stages of endospore formation the newly forming endospore is dehydrated and allowed to mature before being released from the mother cell. The cortex <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> endospore so resistant to temperature. The cortex contains an inner membrane known as the core. The inner membrane that surrounds this core leads to the endospore's resistance against UV light and harsh chemicals that would normally destroy microbes. Sporulation is now complete, and the mature endospore will be released when the surrounding vegetative cell is degraded.|$|E

25|$|Not all {{cells in}} a {{multicellular}} plant contain chloroplasts. All green {{parts of a}} plant contain chloroplasts—the chloroplasts, or more specifically, the chlorophyll in them <b>are</b> <b>what</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> photosynthetic parts of a plant green. The plant cells which contain chloroplasts are usually parenchyma cells, though chloroplasts {{can also be found}} in collenchyma tissue. A plant cell which contains chloroplasts is known as a chlorenchyma cell. A typical chlorenchyma cell of a land plant contains about 10 to 100 chloroplasts.|$|R

The single sold sixmillion copies in the US and was the best-selling song of 2010 in the United Kingdom. [...] Musical acts such as Cher Lloyd and The Band Perry have performed cover versions.
