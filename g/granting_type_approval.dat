When the FCC mandated Emergency Broadcast System (EBS) monitoring by all licensed radio stations, requiring the purchase of special reception equipment, Dick Wright built WTTF's EBS receiver himself.

50|$|Hong Kong has {{independent}} traffic laws from mainland China. Electric {{bikes are}} considered motorcycles in Hong Kong, and therefore need <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> from the Transport Department, just as automobiles. All electric bikes available in Hong Kong {{fail to meet}} the <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> requirement, and the Transport Department has never <b>granted</b> any <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> for an electric bike, making all electric bikes effectively illegal in Hong Kong. Even if they got <b>type</b> <b>approval,</b> the driver would need a motorcycle driving license to ride. As a side note, Hong Kong doesn't have a moped vehicle class (and therefore no moped driving license), and mopeds are considered motorcycles too.|$|R

40|$|Construction {{boasts a}} vast {{worldwide}} literature, but few books take an international overview or draw on relevant technologies outside construction. This book fills those gaps, {{concentrating on the}} UK but also investigating international practice. It provides both a historian’s and a forecaster’s perspective on building and its planning context. Outcomes included: • a nationwide speaking tour on the book • joining the Board of the Housing Forum, a body that, with government support until recently, represents all stakeholders in UK housing • contributing to the Construction Research and Innovation Strategy Panel (CRISP) paper, The social and economic value of construction: the Pearce report revisited, August 2004 • lecturing to major conferences on housing, engaging with top civil servants at the Department of Communities and Local Government (CLG) • a series of broadcasts on housing for Radio 4. My book engaged in contemporary debates {{in the field and}} since publication, the Government has decided to build three million new homes by 2020. In an original manner, the book subjects the complexities of building to interdisciplinary perspectives, including those of economics, urban geography and the management of marketing and innovation. The book makes the novel suggestion that mass-produced buildings, <b>granted</b> <b>Type</b> <b>Approvals,</b> could be located beyond brown-field sites in the UK, so offering householders more space, better architecture, lower energy use and lower house prices. The rigour of the research consists in its comprehensive survey of international opinion on building, as well its insistence on always asking the question: why should the quality and price dynamics of buildings be any different from those of other products...|$|R

TÜV <b>Type</b> <b>Approval</b> helps meet the growing worldwide demand for commercial, standards-based safety instrumentation incorporating Foundation technology. FOUNDATION for SIF technology meets the rigorous requirements of the IEC 61508 standard for functional safety of electrical, electronic and programmable electronic safety-related systems, up to, and including, Safety Integrity Level (SIL) 3. In addition, end users can build systems per the IEC 61511 standard covering SIF functional safety in the process industries (IEC 61511 is available as the ANSI/ISA-84.00.01-2004 standard). International end user associations such as NAMUR (Germany) and JEMIMA (Japan) have voiced support for Foundation technology, and provided input from the end user community that aided in specification development.Approval and support by key international industry bodies gave users the confidence that their investments in Foundation control solutions were based on recognized global standards.|$|R

Marriages performed by those who have no impediment of marriage according to Law No. 1 of 1974. To address this problem researchers use empirical normative approach. As is the normative approach is an effort to bring the issues examined by the normative law. While the empirical approach is an attempt to approach the issues examined by real law or in accordance with the reality that exists in the community. The source of the data in this research is purposive sampling and techniques used in data collection are: 1. Observasi, 2. Interview 3. Documentation.
