Fracturing is a concern when people new to laboratory become impatient and heat glassware, especially the larger pieces, too fast. Heating of glassware should be slowed using an insulating material, such as metal foil or wool, or specialized equipment such as heated baths, heating mantles or laboratory grade <b>hot</b> <b>plates</b> to avoid fracturing.|$|E

40|$|The current {{paradigm}} for the <b>hot</b> <b>plate</b> pain test is problematic in several ways. It uses very limited behavioral criteria to define pain; traditionally, the <b>hot</b> <b>plate</b> pain test measures rats 2 ̆ 7 latencies to performing a specified behavior (hind paw mouthing or jumping) when {{placed on a}} warm surface. Also, the <b>hot</b> <b>plate</b> test yields significant results for only certain analgesics. Non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have an analgesic effect in humans. They do not, however, affect <b>hot</b> <b>plate</b> latencies in rats, unlike opioid analgesics, such as morphine. This study was intended {{to develop a new}} {{paradigm for}} using the <b>hot</b> <b>plate</b> to determine the effectiveness of different analgesics. This study had two main components; first, an inventory of morphine and saline treated rats 2 ̆ 7 behavior on the <b>hot</b> <b>plate</b> was compiled. Videotaped sessions of rats being placed on the <b>hot</b> <b>plate</b> were used to operationally define several behaviors not commonly employed in <b>hot</b> <b>plate</b> analysis. Then the frequencies of these behaviors were determined from the tapes and used to develop a paradigm intended to yield significant results for rats treated with NSAIDs. In the second component of this study, rats treated with ibuprofen, an NSAID, were subjected to the new paradigm. These rats displayed certain behaviors at a significantly different frequency than control rats suggesting that there are in fact behavioral changes on the <b>hot</b> <b>plate</b> in response to NSAIDs, and they are detectable with the new paradigm...|$|R

40|$|Solar cookers supply {{clean and}} {{sustainable}} energy for cooking and so limit {{the use of}} wood or charcoal. A new type of solar cooker is developed with a <b>hot</b> <b>plate.</b> The <b>hot</b> <b>plate</b> offers comfortable access to the food under preparation. The <b>hot</b> <b>plate</b> opens up the opportunity to generate small amounts of electricity {{with the help of}} a thermo electric generator (TEG). The cooker uses a parabolic trough mirror, a Sidney Tube and a heat pipe to transport energy to the <b>hot</b> <b>plate.</b> The energy losses in the conversion steps and so the effectiveness of the whole system are verified with experiments. A comparison of the Tube Solar Cooker with a conventional parabolic solar cookers shows that the new solar cooker outperforms the state of the art on several aspects. The <b>hot</b> <b>plate</b> provides easy access to the pot without the risk of exposure to intense radiation. The high temperature of the <b>hot</b> <b>plate</b> increases the number of cooking techniques compared to conventional solar cookers. The avoidance of heat loss at elevated temperatures of the system is an important issue for further improvement. © 2012 IEEE...|$|R

The instrument consists of a <b>hot</b> and cold <b>plate,</b> between which the fabric was positioned. <b>Hot</b> <b>plate</b> contacts fabric at a pressure of 200  Pa. When the temperature of <b>hot</b> <b>plate</b> reaches the preset value, the thin film heat flux sensor senses the heat flow from <b>hot</b> <b>plate</b> to cold plate. Heat flux sensors detect the amount of heat flow from hot surface to cold surface through fabric. The heat flow value and thickness are used to calculate fabric conductivity and finally the thermal resistance.|$|R

50|$|The Q-machine plasma {{is created}} at a plate {{that has been}} heated to about 2000 K and hence is called the <b>hot</b> <b>plate.</b> Electrons are emitted by the <b>hot</b> <b>plate</b> through {{thermionic}} emission, and ions are created through contact ionization of atoms of alkali metals that have low ionisation potentials. The <b>hot</b> <b>plate</b> is made of a metal that has a large work function and can withstand high temperatures, e.g. tungsten or rhenium. The alkali metal is boiled in an oven {{that is designed to}} direct a beam of alkaline metal vapour onto the <b>hot</b> <b>plate.</b> A high value of the <b>hot</b> <b>plate</b> work function and a low ionisation potential of the metal makes for a low potential barrier for an electron in the alkaline metal to overcome, thus making the ionisation process more efficient. Sometimes barium is used instead of an alkaline metal due to its excellent spectroscopic properties. The fractional ionization of a Q-machine plasma can approach unity, which can be orders of magnitude greater than that predicted by the Saha ionization equation. The Q-machine's nonequilibrium plasmais a primary example of epicatalysis.|$|R

She was striving to adjust {{herself to the}} elements of a new and revolutionary experience; to the waiters who came and went, softly, deferentially putting <b>hot</b> <b>plates</b> before her, helping her to strange and delicious things; a creamy soup, a fish with a yellow sauce whose ingredients were artfully disguised, a breast of guinea fowl, a salad, an ice, and a small cup of coffee. Instincts and tastes hitherto unsuspected and ungratified were aroused in her. What would it be like always to be daintily served, to eat one's meals in this leisurely and luxurious manner? As her physical hunger was satisfied by the dainty food, even as her starved senses drank in the caressing warmth and harmony of the room, the gleaming fire, the heavy scent of the flowers, the rose glow of the lights in contrast to the storm without,--so the storm flinging itself against the windows, powerless to reach her, seemed to typify a former existence of cold, black mornings and factory bells and harsh sirens, of toil and limitations. Had her existence been like that? or was it a dream, a nightmare from which she had awakened at last? From time to time, deep within her, she felt persisting a conviction that that was reality, this illusion, but she fought it down. She wanted--oh, how she wanted to believe in the illusion! ...|$|E
60|$|Lord Monmouth's dinners at Paris were celebrated. It was {{generally}} agreed {{that they had no}} rivals; yet there were others who had as skilful cooks, others who, for such a purpose, were equally profuse in their expenditure. What, then, was the secret spell of his success? The simplest in the world, though no one seemed aware of it. His Lordship's plates were always hot: whereas at Paris, in the best appointed houses, and at dinners which, for costly materials and admirable art in their preparation, cannot be surpassed, the effect is always considerably lessened, and by a mode the most mortifying: by the mere circumstance that every one at a French dinner is served on a cold plate. The reason of a custom, or rather a necessity, which one would think a nation so celebrated for their gastronomical taste would recoil from, is really, it is believed, that the ordinary French porcelain is so very inferior that it cannot endure the preparatory heat for dinner. The common white pottery, for example, which is in general use, and always found at the cafés, will not bear vicinage to a brisk kitchen fire for half-an-hour. Now, if we only had that treaty of commerce with France which has been so often on the point of completion, the fabrics of our unrivalled potteries, in exchange for their capital wines, would be found throughout France. The dinners of both nations would be improved: the English would gain a delightful beverage, and the French, {{for the first time in}} their lives, would dine off <b>hot</b> <b>plates.</b> An unanswerable instance of the advantages of commercial reciprocity.|$|E
