5|$|By the 11th century, the I Ching {{was being}} {{read as a}} work of {{intricate}} philosophy, as a jumping-off point for examining great metaphysical questions and ethical issues. Cheng Yi, patriarch of the Neo-Confucian Cheng–Zhu school, read the I Ching as a guide to moral perfection. <b>He</b> <b>described</b> <b>the</b> text as a way to for ministers to form honest political factions, root out corruption, and solve problems in government.|$|E

5|$|In the prologue, John {{identifies}} Jesus as the Logos (Word). In Ancient Greek philosophy, {{the term}} logos meant {{the principle of}} cosmic reason. In this sense, it {{was similar to the}} Hebrew concept of Wisdom, God's companion and intimate helper in creation. The Hellenistic Jewish philosopher Philo merged these two themes when <b>he</b> <b>described</b> <b>the</b> Logos as God's creator of and mediator with the material world. The evangelist adapted Philo's description of the Logos, applying it to Jesus, the incarnation of the Logos.|$|E

5|$|At 09:35 September 2, {{while the}} North Koreans were {{attempting}} to destroy the engineer troops at {{the southern edge of}} Yongsan and clear the road to Miryang, Eighth United States Army commander Lieutenant General Walton Walker spoke by telephone with Major General Doyle O. Hickey, Deputy Chief of Staff, Far East Command in Tokyo. <b>He</b> <b>described</b> <b>the</b> situation around the Perimeter and said the most serious threat was along the boundary between the US 2nd and US 25th Infantry Divisions. <b>He</b> <b>described</b> <b>the</b> location of his reserve forces and his plans for using them. He said he had started the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade, under Brigadier General Edward A. Craig, toward Yongsan but had not yet released them for commitment there and he wanted to be sure that General of the Army Douglas MacArthur approved his use of them, since he knew that this would interfere with other plans of the Far East Command. Walker said he did not think he could restore the 2nd Division lines without using them. Hickey replied that MacArthur had the day before approved the use of the US Marines if and when Walker considered it necessary. A few hours after this conversation, at 13:15, Walker attached the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade to the US 2nd Division and ordered a co-ordinated attack by all available elements of the division and the marines, with the mission of destroying the North Koreans east of the Naktong River in the 2nd Division sector and restoring the river line. The marines were to be released from 2nd Division control as soon as this mission was accomplished.|$|E
5|$|Brown had {{collected}} seventy-seven osteoderms while excavating a Tyrannosaurus specimen in the Lance Formation of Wyoming in 1900. He mentioned these osteoderms (specimen AMNH 5866) in {{his description of}} Ankylosaurus, but thought they belonged to the Tyrannosaurus instead. Paleontologist Henry Fairfield Osborn also expressed this view when <b>he</b> <b>described</b> <b>the</b> Tyrannosaurus specimen as the now invalid genus Dynamosaurus in 1905. Later examination has shown them {{to be similar to}} those of Ankylosaurus, and that Brown had compared them with some Euoplocephalus osteoderms, which had been erroneously catalogued as belonging to Ankylosaurus at the AMNH.|$|E
5|$|Calvin {{also wrote}} many letters and treatises. Following the Responsio ad Sadoletum, Calvin wrote {{an open letter}} {{at the request of}} Bucer to Charles V in 1543, Supplex exhortatio ad Caesarem, {{defending}} the reformed faith. This was followed by an open letter to the pope (Admonitio paterna Pauli III) in 1544, in which Calvin admonished Paul III for depriving the reformers of any prospect of rapprochement. The pope proceeded to open the Council of Trent, which resulted in decrees against the reformers. Calvin refuted the decrees by producing the Acta synodi Tridentinae cum Antidoto in 1547. When Charles tried to find a compromise solution with the Augsburg Interim, Bucer and Bullinger urged Calvin to respond. He wrote the treatise, Vera Christianae pacificationis et Ecclesiae reformandae ratio in 1549, in which <b>he</b> <b>described</b> <b>the</b> doctrines that should be upheld, including justification by faith.|$|E

5|$|Chinese geographers such as Jia Dan wrote {{accurate}} {{descriptions of}} places far abroad. In his work written between 785 and 805, <b>he</b> <b>described</b> <b>the</b> sea route {{going into the}} mouth of the Persian Gulf, and that the medieval Iranians (whom he called the people of Luo-He-Yi) had erected 'ornamental pillars' in the sea that acted as lighthouse beacons for ships that might go astray. Confirming Jia's reports about lighthouses in the Persian Gulf, Arabic writers a century after Jia wrote of the same structures, writers such as al-Mas'udi and al-Muqaddasi. The Tang dynasty Chinese diplomat Wang Xuance traveled to Magadha (modern northeastern India) during the 7th century. Afterwards he wrote the book Zhang Tianzhu Guotu (Illustrated Accounts of Central India), which included a wealth of geographical information.|$|E
5|$|Even before Haywood {{first became}} an {{official}} with the Western Federation of Miners, {{he was convinced that}} the system under which working people toiled was unjust. <b>He</b> <b>described</b> <b>the</b> execution of the Haymarket leaders in 1887 as a turning point in his life, predisposing him toward membership in the largest organization of the day, the Knights of Labor. Haywood had watched men die in unsafe mine tunnels, and had marched with Kelly's Army. He had suffered a serious hand injury in the mines, and found that his only support came from other miners. When Haywood listened to Ed Boyce of the WFM addressing a group of miners in 1896, he discovered radical unionism and welcomed it.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{assassination}} of former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, Dodd released a statement while campaigning that elaborated on his experiences with the slain leader.

5|$|Frigatebirds {{were grouped}} with cormorants, and sulids (gannets and boobies) {{as well as}} {{pelicans}} in the genus Pelecanus by Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae. <b>He</b> <b>described</b> <b>the</b> distinguishing characteristics as a straight bill hooked at the tip, linear nostrils, a bare face, and fully webbed feet. The genus Fregata was defined by French naturalist Bernard Germain de Lacépède in 1799. Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot described the genus name Tachypetes in 1816 for the great frigatebird. The genus name Atagen had been coined by German naturalist Paul Möhring in 1752, though this has no validity as it predates the official beginning of Linnaean taxonomy.|$|E
5|$|In a 1982 {{interview}} with Knight-Ridder Newspapers, Henson said ideas for his feature film The Dark Crystal originated from his efforts at character creation on Saturday Night Live. Henson told the Associated Press in 1982 that The Dark Crystal characters evolved directly from his Saturday Night Live creations. Henson described the evolutionary process from The Land of Gorch to Dark Crystal, saying that because The Land of Gorch was featured on late-night television, it helped {{expand the scope}} of his puppets, including risqué behavior. <b>He</b> <b>described</b> <b>the</b> challenge that motivated him to further develop concepts from The Land of Gorch on Dark Crystal, saying his next motivation was to draft a universe of puppets for a feature film without humans.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 17th century, the Spanish missionary Fray Alonso de León {{reported}} that about eighty families in San Mateo Ixtatán {{did not pay}} tribute to the Spanish Crown or attend the Roman Catholic mass. <b>He</b> <b>described</b> <b>the</b> inhabitants as quarrelsome and complained that they had built a pagan shrine in the hills among the ruins of pre-Columbian temples, where they burnt incense and offerings and sacrificed turkeys. He reported that every March they built bonfires around wooden crosses about two leagues from the town and set them on fire. Fray de León informed the colonial authorities that the practices of the natives were such that they were Christian in name only. Eventually, Fray de León was chased out of San Mateo Ixtatán by the locals.|$|E

LeMond also described how being a victim of molestation had impacted both his racing career and his life since.|$|E
5|$|The {{industrial}} {{development of the}} Gier valley had its negative aspects. An 1884 writer described the region of Échalas and Saint-Romain-en-Gier, where the country was furrowed by the river, the canal, the railway and the national road. <b>He</b> <b>described</b> <b>the</b> people as the most miserable in the canton of Givors. He said that everything showed this misery: agriculture, roads, houses, church. Work in the mines was the only choice for the poor villagers. An 1885 travel guide mentions the station of Givors-canal on the railway south from Lyon, where the Nîmes line separated from the line to Saint Etienne. The canal then was mainly used by coal barges. The route from Givors-Canal to St. Etienne passed coal mines, large smelting works and iron foundries.|$|E
5|$|Use and {{knowledge}} of the Maya script continued until the 16th century Spanish conquest at least. Bishop Diego de Landa Calderón of the Catholic Archdiocese of Yucatán prohibited the use of the written language, effectively ending the Mesoamerican tradition of literacy in the native script. He worked with the Spanish colonizers to destroy the bulk of Mayan texts as part of his efforts to convert the locals to Christianity and away from what he perceived as pagan idolatry. Later <b>he</b> <b>described</b> <b>the</b> use of hieroglyphic writing in the religious practices of Yucatecan Maya in his Relación de las cosas de Yucatán.|$|E
