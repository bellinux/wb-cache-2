Data is {{not generally}} {{available on the}} specifics, however Divers Alert Network (DAN) has an ongoing citizen science based programme run by DAN (Europe) which gathers data from volunteer recreational divers for analysis by DAN research staff and other researchers. This research is funded by subscription fees of DAN Europe members. The Diving Safety Laboratory is a database to which members can upload dive profiles {{from a wide range}} of dive computers converted to a standard format and other data about the dive. Data on hundreds of thousands of real dives is analysed to investigate aspects of diving safety. The large amounts of data gathered is used for probabilistic analysis of decompression risk. The data donors can get immediate <b>feedback</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> of a simple risk analysis of their dive profiles rated as one of three nominal levels of risk (high, medium and low) based on comparison with Bühlmann ZH16c M-values computed for the same profile.|$|E

40|$|Computer-aided free-response {{mathematics}} {{assessments are}} becoming increasingly important vehicles <b>in</b> supporting <b>the</b> notion of “learning through assessment”. Hence, having a marking engine that is able to assess each step in a scheme of constructed responses (or working scheme) is a vital requirement for a mathematics computer-aided system that offers free-response assessments. Existing computational solutions for assessing the correctness of intermediate steps do so by limiting the responses to be entered stepwise, and not all at once, with the delivery of qualitative feedbacks to steps that are incorrect. In this paper, we propose our marking engine that is able to execute a stepwise assessment of responses in a working scheme that closely emulates the marking practices of a typical human. The marking engine delivers quantitative <b>feedbacks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> of numeric scores that indicate the degree of correctness of <b>the</b> responses <b>in</b> a working scheme and of the working scheme as well. The results of the reliability analysis on the automated correctness scores suggest that the scores are reliable indicators of responses correctness as well as working schemes correctness...|$|R

50|$|Experiments {{have found}} that the {{temporal}} length of the motor control loop takes approximately 250-400 ms. Motor centers, however, are already making corrections to their previous motor plan about 70 ms after the onset of the movement based on peripheral information that should not have arrived yet. It is thus likely that there are motor emulators that receive and process efferent copies and then send predictive peripheral output before the actual peripheral output from sensors is received. Motor centers often have to run very quickly. Feedback delays and peripheral errors make real-time, rapid motor movement very difficult and liable to failure. Through the use of emulators motor centers can receive fast and reliable <b>feedback</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> of a priori predictions. The later real periphery output can then be incorporated into a more accurate model.|$|E

5000|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} the echo frequency around a constant value for optimal hearing, the bat must dynamically modulate the frequency of the pulses it emits. This is done rapidly in the naturally behaving animal, and is accomplished by making a series of small changes to the call frequency upon receiving auditory <b>feedback</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> of an echo. [...] These small changes are produced between, not within, calls. [...] The bat produces a call, listens for the returning echo, and makes a small, step-wise adjustment in the frequency of its next pulse. [...] By making small changes to the frequency of each call, and increasing the overall rate of pulses produced, the bat is able to rapidly attend to ongoing auditory feedback and use that information to accurately stabilize the echo frequency around a constant value. [...] Making large changes in call frequency without increasing the call rate leads to a risk that the bat will overcompensate for the Doppler shift, which will also result in the echoes falling outside of the auditory fovea. [...] By making a series of small, rapid changes to call frequency, the Doppler shift can be acutely compensated for, without the echo frequency falling outside of the acoustic fovea. [...] This mechanism of feedback control ultimately optimizes speed, accuracy, and overall stability of the DSC in the animal’s natural context.|$|E
