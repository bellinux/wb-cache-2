Applying multivariate analysis, the sum of normalized concentrations of Ti, Fe, and Al in sediments was selected to trace the terrigenous influence in bottom sediments, whereas Ca, Si, and K were used as indicators of marine influence. Sepetiba Bay bottom sediments are dominated by up to 80 % terrigenous <b>inputs.</b> The open <b>bay</b> sediments are enriched in P, Mg, K, and Ca because of the intensive water column primary production.

The residence time of bio-chemical parameters in the Bay and the exchange between Izmir Bay and the Aegean Sea are strongly affected by horizontal and vertical mixing and advection. The distributions of bio-chemical parameters depend not only on the wind-driven circulation in the Bay, but also on the thermohaline-driven or baroclinic circulation.

With top half-normal wiring, the same happens but vice versa. If a patch bay is wired to full-normal, then it includes break contacts in both rows of jacks.|$|R
40|$|Copano Bay is {{a shallow}} (< 2 - 3 m), {{microtidal}} estuary {{in south central}} Texas. In an effort to both determine the distribution as well as investigate the controls {{on the distribution of}} oyster reefs, a geophysical survey of Copano Bay was conducted in June and July 2007. Surficial sediment analysis confirms that the recent sedimentation in Copano Bay is comprised of mostly estuarine mud with little sand or shell, large extents of oyster reefs and smaller areas of sand. Seismic stratigraphy analyses verify that the first oyster reefs in Copano Bay formed atop topographic highs in the Pleistocene surface. About 6 ka, sea level rise slowed to near its present rate and sediment supply decreased tremendously to Copano Bay decreasing the amount of suspended sediment. The first oyster reefs began forming around this time using these fluvial terraces as suitable substrate. Once the initial reefs were established, additional reefs began forming atop these initial reefs, or on the eroded shell hash material from the initial reefs. During this time of slow sea level rise and low sediment <b>input</b> to the <b>bay,</b> oyster reefs thrived and reef and shell hash material covered a majority of the bay surface. Once climate change increased sediment <b>input</b> to the <b>bay,</b> the reefs began to decrease in size due to siltation.

40|$|The evolvement of a beach {{depends on}} many conditions. Erosion and {{deposition}} {{are the most}} common phenomena during beach evolvement proceeding, whicn can always be found in the same beach. Sediment transport drived by waves or currents changes with season or tide period time. The coastal infrastructures have great influences on sediment transport by changing the nature conditions, so it is the most common approach adopted to deal with beach problems. In China, sand beach getting muddy by depositing silt is another beach problem in addition to erosion. With the population of coastal city growing, it is attracting more attention from researchers. This paper demonstrates an approach of coastal shallows and development in a semi-closed bay. The waves, tidal currents and floods are discussed and the sediment conditions are analyzed. After that, a mud digging and sand beach rebuilding plan is recommended. In the adduced bay, waves are small and varying with wind forces and directions, tidal currents are weak in the most part of the coastal shallows, floods generally happen during July to September accompanying with sediment <b>input</b> the <b>bay</b> every year. The analyzing method and simulation technology can be used in the similar semi-closed bay and be referenced by other coastal areas...|$|R

30|$|The metal {{contaminations}} in {{the aquatic}} environments have received considerable concern {{due to their}} toxicity, abundance and persistence in the environment, and their subsequent accumulation in aquatic habitats. It has been recognized for many years that the concentrations of metals found in dissolved or particulate phase of coastal areas, may be derived {{from a variety of}} anthropogenic and natural sources (Abdallah et al. 2007). El-Mex Bay is a part of Alexandria coast on the Mediterranean Sea, it is adjacent to Alexandria City center that is populated with about six million inhabitants; in addition, it is considered as one of the main fishing sources in Egypt (Abdallah 2014). The contaminants are introduced through waterway and through several landbased sources into the Bay. El-Mex Bay has several industrial plants situated close to the coast and directly discharges its effluents into it. In addition this Bay is an estuarine zone of huge agricultural drain (Omoum Drain), which crosses areas of intensive agriculture and a county with rapidly growing population density, and industrial activities; its discharge rate is about 2547.7  ×  106  m 3 /year (Abdallah 2008; El-Rayis and Abdallah 2006). As a result, large amounts of pollutants including heavy metals were supplied to the <b>bay.</b> Besides aquatic <b>inputs,</b> El-Mex <b>Bay</b> is also exposed to atmospheric pollution from the same activities that cause aquatic pollution.|$|R

Narragansett Bay covers approximately 147 square miles with an undulating shoreline that creates a string of sheltered coves where water circulation may be restricted (Figure 1).

50|$|The {{establishment}} of reservoirs containing {{large amounts of}} standing water {{has the ability to}} produce local climate changes. Alteration of annual precipitation patterns, increased abundance of low stratus clouds and fog, and warmer autumns and cooler springs, leading to a delay in {{the beginning and end of}} the growing season, have all been observed in the vicinity of the project’s major reservoirs. The doubling of the freshwater <b>input</b> into James <b>Bay</b> during the winter decreases the salinity of the seawater, thereby increasing the freezing point of the bay. The resultant increased ice content at the northern section of the project in the winter has cooled warm air currents more than usual, bringing harsher Arctic weather, including strong winds and less precipitation, to south-central Quebec. The tree line at the southern edge of the development has shifted noticeably southward since the project’s construction.|$|R
40|$|Net {{biogeochemical}} {{production and}} transport rates for several variables {{were computed for}} the Patuxent River estuary from 1985 to 2003 using a box model. Monthly rate estimates were analyzed for temporal patterns and variability in response to climatic factors and nutrient management. The middle estuary was the most productive estuarine region and was characterized by strong pelagic-benthic coupling. Phytoplankton biomass in this region peaked in spring as fueled by seaward nutrient inputs. Nutrients regenerated from decomposition of this spring bloom were required to support summer productivity. Improvements of sewage treatment in the watershed resulted in declining point source nutrient loads to the estuary, but water quality did not improve in the mesohaline estuary. Poor water quality in the middle estuary was maintained by persistent non-point nutrient loads, while degrading water quality in the lower estuary correlated with increasing DIN <b>inputs</b> from Chesapeake <b>Bay,</b> high river flow, and declining herbivorous grazing...|$|R

Loading to the upper bay increased far more than that to the lower bay, and the most important source shifted from non-point animal waste to human waste concentrated at sewage treatment facilities. We also modeled future N loads in 2015 under four management scenarios. Planned improvements in sewage treatment would reduce N loads 9 % below business-as-usual, to the 1990 loading rate.

Agricultural sources account for about 70 – 80 % of the N and P in rivers. The coastal eutrophication potential is high in the Bay. In 2000, nutrient discharge from about 85 % of the basin area of the Bay drains into coastal seas contributes to the risk of coastal eutrophication. By 2050, this may be 96 %.

Distributions of Fe and Mn were used as indicators of chemical conditions of sediment cores and Cu, Pb, Cr, Zn, Ag, and Ni distributions with time were compared with known or estimated source inputs to examine the long-term variation of pollutant metal <b>inputs</b> to Narragansett <b>Bay.</b> ^ At one location, duplicate cores were sampled to look at variability within a marsh. At another location, a high marsh, receiving predominantly atmospheric inputs and a low marsh, receiving waterborne and atmospheric inputs, were sampled so that atmospheric and tidal contributions could be determined. A comparison was made of the distributions of metals in bay cores and in the lagoon core. ^ All the Rhode Island marshes accrete at rates equal to or greater (avg. 0. 40 cm/yr) than the local rise in sea level (0. 26 cm/yr). Based on the 210 Pb chronologies, pollutant metals began to increase in the mid to late 1800 s, corresponding to coal burning emissions to the atmosphere. Steeper increases in the 1900 s reflect industrial and sewage discharges. Maximum concentrations were reached in the 1950 s and have declined almost continuously since then. Observed reductions were attributable to implementation of and improvements to sewage treatment, and controls on atmospheric emissions. ^ All cores in the bay showed variations which occurred at about the same time, but concentrations in upper bay cores were greater than in lower bay cores. The observed gradient and the simultaneous changes in concentrations in all cores suggests that discharge limitations {{at the head of the}} estuary will result in bay-wide reductions. Comparison of high and low marsh cores suggested a predominately waterborne source of metals. Concentrations in the lagoon core peaked in the 1970 s and appear to follow atmospheric emission restrictions and/or changes in local highway drainage patterns. ...|$|R

The first phase of construction cost $800 million and included four research buildings, a community center, a student housing complex, two parking structures, and development of large open spaces.|$|R
40|$|International audienceAuthigenic 10 Be/ 9 Be {{ratios and}} 10 Be-fluxes reconstructed using the 230 Thxs normalization, proxies of thecosmogenic {{radionuclide}} 10 Be production {{rate in the}} atmosphere, have been measured in a sedimentarycore from Baffin Bay (North Atlantic) spanning the last 136 ka BP. The normalization applied on theexchangeable (authigenic) 10 Be concentrations using the authigenic 9 Be isotope and 230 Thxs methodsyield equivalent results strongly correlated with sedimentological parameters (grain-size and mineralogy). Lower authigenic beryllium (Be) concentrations and 10 Be/ 9 Be ratios are associated with coarsegrainedcarbonate-rich layers, while higher authigenic Be values are related to fine-grained felsparrichsediments. This variability is due to: i) sediment composition control over beryllium-scavengingefficiency and, ii) glacial history that contributed to modify the 10 Be concentration in Baffin Bay byinput and boundary scavenging condition changes. Most paleo-denudation rates inferred from the 10 Be/ 9 Be ratio vary weakly around 220 ± 76 tons. km 2. yr 1 (0. 09 ± 0. 03 mm. yr 1) corresponding torelatively steady weathering fluxes over the last glacial cycle except for six brief intervals characterizedby sharp increases of the denudation rate. These intervals are related to ice-surging episodes coeval withHeinrich events and the last deglaciation period. An average freshwater flux of 180. 6 km 3. yr 1 (0. 006 Sv),consistent with recent models, has been calculated in order to sustain glacially-derived 10 Be <b>inputs</b> intoBaffin <b>Bay.</b> It is concluded that in such environments, the authigenic 10 Be measured mainly depends onclimatic effects related to the glacial dynamics, which masks the 10 Be production variation modulated bygeomagnetic field changes. Altogether, these results challenge the simple interpretation of 10 Be-concentrationvariation as a proxy of Interglacial/Glacial (interstadial/stadial) cycles in Arctic and sub-Arcticregions.

The concentrations of HCHs, DDTs and PCBs in the SPM varied both with the sampling locations and the season of collection. Higher concentrations were recorded in the SPM as compared with sediments. The distribution pattern of such organochlorine compounds (OCs), in the Pearl River estuary, showed that sources were some major river mouths and <b>input</b> from Shenzhen <b>Bay.</b> The concentrations of OCs were, however, low as compared with other estuaries and seas. The environmental fate of the OCs during estuarine mixing was determined, in part, by physicochemical and biochemical properties.

Although primary productivity measurements are usually used to assess responses to limiting factors, the rates are proportional to biomass and inversely related to grazing pressure during experimental incubations. Alternatively, carbon-specific growth-rate determinations provide insights into physiological responses without the confounding effects of biomass and grazing. The objective {{of this study was to}} quantify the growth-rate responses of phytoplankton to enhanced nutrient availability (nitrate and phosphate) over a range of in situ irradiances. Growth rates were determined based on chlorophyll a-specific 14 C-uptake rates by phytoplankton. Phytoplankton demonstrated high (24 h) growth rates when exposed to increased concentrations of limiting nutrients, independent of the surface irradiances (12 – 41 %). Growth-rate responses were also compared with the biomass (chlorophyll a) responses and community composition. Observed and estimated phytoplankton biomass changes during the incubations differed, emphasizing the structural role of grazers on the phytoplankton community. The phytoplankton community in Galveston Bay has the potential to instantaneously respond to nutrient pulses, facilitating diatom biomass accumulations in spring and summer and small, flagellated species and cyanobacteria during periods of low nutrient <b>inputs.</b> Thus, Galveston <b>Bay</b> phytoplankton biomass and community composition reflect a dynamic balance between the frequency of nutrient pulsing and grazing intensity...|$|R

Seasonal variation in gonad development was investigated in a suspended cultured oyster population. Gametogenesis began in February and first-spawning was observed between mid and late June when surface water temperature reached 22 to 25 degrees C. Spawning activity extended from mid June to late September, with 2 marked spawning peaks in June and August. Histological examination indicated that gonad development paralleled seasonal fluctuations in water temperature. Spawning in late June was partly associated with a sudden drop in salinity due to large freshwater <b>inputs</b> to the <b>Bay</b> with the summer monsoon. M. chungmuensis occurred in developing and fully mature eggs of spawning oysters in late June to January, but were not observed from February to May. Monthly mean infection intensity was high in late June when most oysters had their first spawning period. The infection level was also relatively high in late August and November, when oysters were spawning or had completed spawning. Several oysters collected in November (11. 4 %) and December (16. 3 %) carried a large quantity of ripe but M. chungmuensis-infected eggs, suggesting that infection also causes spawning failure by delaying spawning and destroying ripe oocytes.

This study mapped seagrass at three sites in Port Phillip Bay between 1939 and 2011 and reviewed possible influences on seagrass cover changes. Historical aerial photographs from multiple sources were digitally scanned and orthorectified. Automated image processing techniques incorporating an unsupervised classification combined with minor editing in a GIS were applied to map seagrass cover and analyse variations in the size and distribution of seagrass beds. Large declines in seagrass cover were observed at all three sites after 1998. In contrast to other world-wide observations, these recent declines were preceded by a period of sustained seagrass expansion between the 1960 s and 1990 s and lower levels of seagrass cover were observed in the 1930 s/ 40 s. The recent and earlier low levels of seagrass cover coincided with extended droughts characterised by large reductions in nutrient <b>inputs</b> to the <b>Bay.</b> However, recent declines were not consistent across the Bay with three other sites remaining relatively stable during this period. The sites with large declines are all subject to longshore drift and changes in nearshore sediment transport driven by variations in weather patterns coinciding with extended periods of drought may be important influences on seagrass cover at these locations...|$|R

In estuaries such as the Chesapeake Bay, such large increases in nitrogen are severely damaging populations of aquatic plants and animals, and also increasing harmful and toxic algal blooms. Most of the coastal waters of the USA are seriously degraded. At the global and national scale, agriculture is {{the major source of}} nitrogen pollution. However, atmospheric deposition is also a major source in many regions, and it contributes 25 percent to 50 percent of the nitrogen <b>inputs</b> to Chesapeake <b>Bay.</b> The Susquehanna River is the largest river east of the Mississippi in the USA, the largest tributary of Chesapeake Bay, and the single largest source of nutrients to the main stem of the Bay. Therefore, better understanding of the sources and sinks of nutrients and sediment in the Susquehanna River watershed will support better management of nutrients and water quality in the Chesapeake Bay. Research is needed urgently to identify the most important targets for nutrient reductions and the most cost-effective solutions.

40|$|Autogenous and allogenous {{control of}} the {{phytoplankton}} standing crop and biomass was proved in Mex Bay, west of Alexandria (Egypt). Among the clear signs of eutrophication are the heavy visible blooms, which became regular events, at intermittent periods during the warm seasons. The causative organisms progressed differently, the dinoflagellate, Gymnodinium catenatum, is well known toxic species. The Environmental Impact Assessment model (EIA) was applied to Mex Bay. It is a three-dimensional water quality and flow model, based on the three interacted dimensional: longitude, latitude and depth, calculations {{of time and space}} variations. The model deals with processes that affecting the water quality. It was initiated with measured field data and load input. The model was used to simulate phytoplankton biomass transport and ambient nutrient concentrations (nitrate, phosphate & ammonia). The model results and the field measurements are compared in order to fit the model. Generally, the calculated flow and concentrations corresponded well with observations. Deviations are attributed to several reasons. A notable influence of the main outfall on the concentrations, particularly in the near shore area, as well as, on the seawater quality was detected. The spatial distribution of the phytoplankton standing crop coincided clearly with the accompanied chlorophyll a concentrations calculated by the model. The results stressed the need to reduce load <b>input</b> into Mex <b>Bay,</b> in order to counteract eutrophication in Alexandria waters. Nitrogen reduction is more important for the whole area, while phosphorous reduction is more effective in the bay...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: This {{watershed}} modeling {{effort was}} conducted {{as part of}} a larger study by the Brake Pad Partnership (BPP), a multi-stakeholder effort of manufacturers, regulators, stormwater management agencies and environmentalists working together to better understand the impacts of copper from brake pad debris on water quality in the San Francisco Bay Region. The watershed model provides runoff loads to a Bay modeling effort to assess resulting concentrations in SF Bay, with the objective of assessing how the contribution of copper from brake pads affects both the short-term and long-term concentrations of copper in the Bay. This paper describes the model set up process and GIS processing of relevant data layers to efficiently produce watershed modeling inputs for the U. S. EPA BASINS system that was used for the watershed modeling component of this effort; a companion paper describes the model application process and loading results produced by the effort as <b>input</b> to the <b>Bay</b> modeling component. Local and national-scale data for land use, soils, topography, hydrography, and meteorology were processed within the BASINS framework to generate model input files for the U. S. EPA's Hydrological Simulation Program-FORTRAN (HSPF) model for each of the Brake Pad Partnership modeled sub-watersheds that drain to the San Francisco Bay. Selected model parameters were estimated through overlays of soils, topography, and land use GIS layers onto the watershed delineations to establish parameter values within each of the sub-watersheds...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} relationships between the biomass, morphometry, and density of short shoots (SS) of the tropical seagrass Thalassia testudinum and the physical-environmental forcing in the region. Seasonal sampling surveys were undertaken four times in Bahia de la Ascension, a shallow estuary in the western Mexican Caribbean, to measure plant morphology and environmental variables. The estuary has a fresh water-influenced inner bay, a large central basin and a marine zone featuring a barrier reef at the seaward margin. Leaf size was positively correlated with increasing salinity, but total biomass was not, being similar across most of the sites. Aboveground biomass exhibited seasonal differences in dry and rainy seasons along the bay, most markedly in the brackish inner bay where an abrupt decline in biomass coincided with the rainy season. The relationship between nutrients and biomass indicates that the aboveground/belowground biomass ratio increases as nutrient availability increases. Areal cover was inversely correlated with SS density during both dry and rainy seasons. Maximum SS recruitment coincided with the rainy season. Peaks in SS density were recorded in the freshwater-influenced inner bay during an ENSO cold phase in 2007 ("La Niña") which is associated with a wetter dry season and following a strong storm (Hurricane Dean). The onset of the rainy season influences both shoot density and T. testudinum biomass by controlling the freshwater <b>input</b> to the <b>bay</b> and thus, the system's salinity gradient and external nutrients supply from the coastal wetland...|$|R
40|$|The {{levels of}} 15 {{polycyclic}} aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were determined in seawater, suspended particulate matter (SPM), surface sediment and core sediment samples of Deep Bay, South China. The average concentrations Sigma(15) PAHs were 69. 4 +/- 24. 7 ng l(- 1) in seawater, 429. 1 +/- 231. 8 ng g(- 1) in SPM, and 353. 8 +/- 128. 1 ng g(- 1) dry weight in surface sediment, respectively. Higher PAH concentrations were observed in SPM than in surface sediment. Temporal trend of PAH concentrations in core sediment generally increased from 1948 to 2004, with higher concentrations in top than in sub-surface, implying a stronger recent input of PAHs owing to the rapid economic development in Shenzhen. Compared with historical data. the PAH levels in surface sediment has increased, and this was further confirmed by the increasing trend of PAHs in the core sediment. Phenanthrene, fluoranthene and pyrene dominated in the PAH composition pattern profiles in the Bay. Compositional pattern analysis suggested that PAHs in the Deep Bay were derived from both pyrogenic and petrogenic sources, and diesel oil leakage, river runoff and air deposition may serve as important pathways for PAHs <b>input</b> to the <b>Bay.</b> Significant positive correlations between partition coefficient in surface sediment to that in water (K-OC) of PAH and their octanol/water partition coefficients (K-OW) were observed, suggesting that K-OC of PAHs in sediment/water of Deep Bay may be predicted by the corresponding K-OW.

40|$|Standing on the {{causeway}} to Antelope Island, many things are striking…the {{beauty of the}} sun over the lake, the incredible serenity of the landscape…the stifling odor coming from Farmington Bay. The causeway, which was first constructed in 1969 and then rebuilt in 1993, serves as the only entrance to Antelope Island. It {{also serves as a}} barrier between Farmington Bay estuary, where the Jordan River flows into the lake, {{and the rest of the}} Great Salt Lake. Our research, both through the mid- 1990 s and more recently in October 2000 has illustrated many differences between Farmington Bay and the southern basin (Gilbert Bay) of the Great Salt Lake. We believe that many of the differences we found are due to high levels of nutrient <b>input</b> into Farmington <b>Bay</b> from the Jordan River and sewage treatment plants along the shore. The most striking difference between the basins is the productivity. Farmington Bay supports very high densities of algae, while the Great Salt Lake (Bridger Bay) has much lower concentrations. Water transparency, measured by determining the depth a white Secchi disk disappears from view, was shallower in Farmington Bay [...] 0. 6 m compared to 1. 8 m in the Lake proper. This indicates that Farmington Bay has higher algal densities and growth. We also used chlorophyll a concentrations as a measure of algal biomass. In Farmington Bay average chlorophyll concentrations ranged from 11 to 70 µg L- 1 during our 1994 survey, and in 2000 ther...|$|R
40|$|The {{capacity}} of epifauna to control algal proliferation following nutrient input depends on responses of both grazers and upper trophic level consumers to enrichment. We examined {{the responses of}} Thalassia testudinum (turtle grass) epifaunal assemblages to nutrient enrichment at two sites in Florida Bay with varying levels of phosphorus limitation. We compared epifaunal density, biomass, and species diversity in 2 m 2 plots that had either ambient nutrient concentrations or had been enriched with nitrogen and phosphorus for 6 months. At the severely P-limited site, total epifaunal density and biomass were two times higher in enriched than in unenriched plots. Caridean shrimp, grazing isopods, and gammarid amphipods accounted {{for much of the}} increase in density; brachyuran crabs, primary predatory fish, and detritivorous sea cucumbers accounted for most of the increase in biomass. At the less P-limited site, total epifaunal density and biomass were not affected by nutrient addition, although there were more caridean shrimp and higher brachyuran crab and pink shrimp biomass in enriched plots. At both sites, some variation in epifaunal density and biomass was explained by features of the macrophyte canopy, such as T. testudinum and Halodule wrightii percent cover, suggesting that enrichment may change the refuge value of the macrophyte canopy for epifauna. Additional variation in epifaunal density and biomass was explained by epiphyte pigment concentrations, suggesting that enrichment may change the microalgal food resources that support grazing epifauna. Increased epifaunal density in enriched plots suggests that grazers may be able to control epiphytic algal proliferation following moderate nutrient <b>input</b> to Florida <b>Bay...</b>|$|R
