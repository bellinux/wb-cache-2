25|$|Conventional {{techniques}} for measuring in-situ infiltration {{include the use}} of a single or double ring infiltrometer. Single and double ring infiltrometer only measures flow under ponded (saturated) conditions, and when used in soil with distinct macropores, preferential flow will dominate the flow. (See: Poiseuille's law) This does not reflect infiltration under rainfall or sprinkler irrigation. Therefore, many authors attempted to create a negative potential (tension) on the water flow. This is to exclude macropores in the <b>flow</b> <b>process,</b> hence only measuring the soil matrix flow.|$|E

40|$|The {{formation}} of a methodological approach to evaluating management {{of the state of}} enterprise <b>flow</b> <b>processes</b> has been considered. Proceeding from the developed and presented in literary sources theoretical propositions on organization of management of enterprise <b>flow</b> <b>processes,</b> the hypothesis of the study is correlation of quantitative and qualitative evaluations of management effectiveness and {{formation of}} the integral index on their basis. The article presents stages of implementation of a methodological approach to evaluating the state of management of enterprise <b>flow</b> <b>processes,</b> which implies indicating the components, their characteristics and methods of research. The composition of indicators, on the basis of which it is possible to evaluate effectiveness of management of enterprise <b>flow</b> <b>processes,</b> has been determined. Grouping of such indicators based on the flow nature of enterprise processes has been performed. The grouping of indicators is justified by a pairwise determination of canonical correlations between the selected groups (the obtained high correlation coefficients confirmed the author’s systematization of indicators). It is shown that a specificity of the {{formation of a}} methodological approach to evaluating the state of management of enterprise <b>flow</b> <b>processes</b> requires expansion in the direction of aggregation of the results and determination of factors that influence effectiveness of <b>flow</b> <b>processes</b> management. The article carries out such aggregation using the factor analysis. Distribution of a set of objects into different classes according to the results of the cluster analysis has been presented. To obtain an integral estimation of effectiveness of <b>flow</b> <b>processes</b> management, the taxonomic index of a multidimensional object has been built. A peculiarity of the formed methodological approach to evaluating the state of management of enterprise <b>flow</b> <b>processes</b> is in the matrix correlation of integral indicators calculated {{on the basis of the}} taxonomic index of development of quantitative (characterizing the effectiveness of management of enterprise <b>flow</b> <b>processes)</b> and qualitative (determine the degree of logistization of management system elements) evaluations, which provides for justifying scenarios of the enterprise strategic behavior in functional areas of logistics...|$|R

40|$|The {{relevance}} of the logistics concept concerning the solution of <b>flow</b> <b>processes</b> optimal control problems of industrial enterprises is discussed in the article. Modern tools of logistics {{make it possible to}} resolve the existing contradictions in Ukrainian economy by unifying business-structures into a single efficient system. While dealing with enterprise optimal management as a total combination of <b>flow</b> <b>processes,</b> logistics plays the main role as a regulator between an enterprise and resources market on the one hand, and an enterprise and sales market of finished goods on the other hand. Thus, there is a constant exchange (supply) of matter, energy and information between the links of a continuous chain (supply chain). Such a definition as "variability" is suggested as a fundamental reason of inconsistency. The concept of variability is explained as any deviation at input / output processes from the desired ideal values. From this points of view the fundamental way to improve system efficiency is to reduce this variability. The current management of an enterprise should take into consideration integration and innovation aspects of economy. It should be based on consistency and compliance of <b>flow</b> <b>processes</b> of an enterprise, and be predictive. The conditions for implementation of optimal (logistics) management of <b>flow</b> <b>processes</b> were outlined...|$|R
