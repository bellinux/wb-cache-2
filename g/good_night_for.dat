25|$|Booth {{followed}} up his first career defeat with victory {{back at home}} beating Mark Reynolds in Coventry before getting a fight with the current holder of the British and Commonwealth flyweight titles Keith Knox. The fight due {{to take place in}} Belfast on 16 October 1999 would have both titles on the line with Booth eventually winning in the 10th round. The new champion defended his Commonwealth title first when in January 2000 he beat South African Abbey Mnisi. In November 2000 he put both titles on the line when defending against 8-0 prospect Ian Napa eventually winning a 12-round unanimous decision. In February 2001, he made the second defence of his Commonwealth belt knocking out Zimbabwean, Nogthula Tshabangu at the Harvey Hadden Leisure Centre in Nottingham. Booth's brother, Nicky, was also on the bill and defeated Adey Lewis with a seventh round stoppage to crown a <b>good</b> <b>night</b> <b>for</b> the brothers and a unique one in British boxing history in that {{it was the first time}} that two siblings had defended titles on the same night.|$|E

But the prince treated him with rare kindness and always pressed Nerle's hand affectionately when he bade him <b>good</b> <b>night,</b> <b>for</b> he had grown fond of his esquire.

6000|$|Dumoulin {{suspects}} {{he is with}} Lord Chesterfield, the English Ambassador here. A {{light was}} seen, for a night or two, {{in one of the}} garret-rooms of Lord Chesterfield's house,--probably Keith reading?--but Keith is not to be heard of, on inquiry there; and the very light has now gone out. The Colonel at least, distinguished English Lord is gone to England in these days; but his German Secretary is not gone: the House is inviolable, impregnable to Prussia. Who knows, in spite of the light going out, but Keith is still there, merely with a window shutter to screen him? One morning, it becomes apparent Keith is not there. One morning, a gentleman at the seaside is admiring Dutch fishing-skiffs, and how they do sail, [...] "Pooh, Sir, that is nothing!" [...] answers a man in multiplex breeches: [...] "the other night I went across to England in one, with an Excellency's Messenger who could not wait!"--Truth is, the Chesterfield Secretary, who forbade lights, took the first <b>good</b> <b>night</b> <b>for</b> conveying Keith to Scheveningen and the seaside; where a Fisher-boat was provided for him; which carried him, frail craft as it was, safe across to England. Once there, the Authorities took pity on the poor fellow;--furnished the modicum of cash and help; sent him with Admiral Norris to assist the Portuguese, menaced with Spanish war at this time; among whom he gradually rose to be Major of Horse. Friedrich Wilhelm cited him by tap of drum three times in Wesel, and also in the Gazettes, native and Dutch; then, as he did not come, nailed an Effigy of him (cut in four, if I remember) on the gallows there; and confiscated any property he had. Keith had more pedigree than property; was of Poberow in Pommern; son of poor gentlefolks there. He sent no word of himself to Prussia, for the next ten years; so that he had become a kind of myth to many people; to his poor Mother among the rest, who has her tragical surmises about him. He will appear again; but not to much purpose. His Brother, the Page Keith, is packed into the Fusileer Regiment, at Wesel here; and there walks sentry, unheard of {{for the rest of his}} life. So much for the Keiths.
