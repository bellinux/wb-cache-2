25|$|The words homophile and <b>homophilia</b> are dated {{terms for}} homosexuality. The {{use of the}} word began to {{disappear}} with the emergence of the gay liberation movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s, replaced by a new set of terminology which provides a much clearer identity such as gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender.|$|E
25|$|Although early writers {{also used}} the {{adjective}} homosexual to refer to any single-sex context (such as an all-girls school), today the term is used exclusively in reference to sexual attraction, activity, and orientation.

50|$|Perez’s primary insight, {{according}} to Toby Johnson, is defining {{what he calls}} “The Importance of Being Gay.” In a series of short essays he argues that there are four major patterns, archetypal and universal: masculine, feminine, other-directed, and same-directed. In Perez's philosophy, Love {{is said to be}} a manifestation of the soul’s desire to be reunited with God both as love for others (heterophilia) and love for the self or similar (<b>homophilia).</b> Perez himself, in a dialogue with Ken Wilber published by Integral Naked, said that he views the autobiographical climax of his book to be a reflection of <b>homophilia</b> in its positive and negative forms, Love (Agape) and Fear (Thanatos).|$|E
50|$|Other notable {{trends in}} punk {{politics}} include anarchism, socialism, individualism, anti-statism, anti-militarism, anti-capitalism, anti-racism, anti-sexism, anti-nationalism, <b>homophilia,</b> environmentalism, vegetarianism, veganism and animal rights. However, some individuals within the punk subculture hold right-wing views (such as {{those associated with}} the Conservative Punk website), neo-Nazi views (Nazi punk), or are apolitical (e.g., horror punk).|$|E

50|$|The shooting, {{carried out}} {{mainly in the}} sixteenth century Villa Gonzaga-Zani in Villimpenta in the spring of 1975 were difficult; not so much at the {{technical}} level (the cinematographer was Tonino Delli Colli) but because the scenes of <b>homophilia,</b> coprophagia and sadomasochism required a patience that only savoir faire and charisma of Pasolini made it acceptable. The courtyard of the sequence, then, in which torture culminate, caused abrasions and burns on some bodies (naked) of the actors.|$|E
5000|$|The thesis {{argued that}} in certain erotic and {{friendly}} relationships there are certain norms looked for and desired which are [...] "the same". This <b>homophilia</b> can occur both in relationships between men and between women. In contrast, Heimsoth saw heterophilia as a relationship characterized by [...] "the opposite"; considered well {{within the range of}} heterophilia are platonic relationships between an effeminate man and a masculine man. His interpretations of homosexuality and male friendship were based upon previous ideas, as developed in 1903 by Otto Weininger in Geschlecht und Charakter ("Sex and Character") and in 1919 by Hans Blüher in Die Rolle der Erotik in der männlichen Gesellschaft ("The Role of Eroticism in Male Society"). Heimsoth's reflections start with Blüher's theory on the central meaning of eroticism between men to society.|$|E
5000|$|According to {{the lower}} Court in 2005, the {{administrator}} was guilty of [...] "incitement against a group of people" [...] for statements he himself had written, and for crime against [...] "the law on electronic bulletin boards", for guest-messages which he neglected to delete. Liljeström told the court that his purpose is to preach the gospel and win people for Jesus, and that the truth is needed to awake people. Among the statements {{that led to the}} verdict were the following: [...] "The modern <b>homophilia</b> is the source and engine behind the AIDS-epidemic", and [...] "AIDS is a punishment from God against sodomy". The view {{that there should be a}} [...] "death penalty for homosexual acts" [...] was also uttered on the website by a guest, but that was repudiated by Leif Liljeström directly in the forum. Still, he was convicted to prison also for the guest's statements.|$|E
40|$|In {{a series}} of records that have been {{published}} in the 1914 - 1916 period, Corrado Gini has laid the foundations of the discussion on a methodology for studying the statistical relations concerning the association of two characters. Gini's theory of concordance, which makes a distinction between the notion of absolute and relative maximum, allowed the definition of a multiplicity of correlation indexes and <b>homophilia</b> which are to be connected to the various cognitive applications that {{are to be found in}} the substantial research context. Gini's theory, at the same time, has performed a critical deepening which permitted to obtain a complete framework together with a reinterpretation of already known indexes such as Bravais-Pearson's correlation coefficient and Spearman's rank correlation. In our work, by extending Gini's concordance theory to multiple statistical distribu-tions and in the light of the simplest algebraic language, some partial correlation indexes, which have been previously defined by means of the geometric instrumenta-tion of tensorial calculus, are here reconsidered, and, therefore, the partial <b>homophilia</b> indexes are introduced...|$|E
40|$|Diversity is a {{fundamental}} idea present in educational processes. Therefore, sexual diversity is a topic that must {{be discussed in the}} school setting. This is why the author explores the concept of homophobia as an expression the violence a rejection against other individuals. On the other hand, <b>homophilia</b> is regarded as the capacity to love individuals from the same sex, and heterophylly as the capacity to love and feel desire for individuals from the opposite sex. Understanding such terms helps experience eroticism as an intimate and collective expression in a society where all humans will be accepted...|$|E
40|$|Prominent {{measures}} of masculinity focus on traditional masculine norms, {{such as high}} aggression, low emotional expression, and heteronormativity. However, recent qualitative {{research has indicated that}} a variety of men embrace alternative forms of masculinity that include unique characteristics not represented by traditional norms. I developed the Alternative Masculinity Measure (ALT-M) to address this gap. The ALT-M was designed to measure individual differences on constructs derived from a modern, socially progressive representation of masculinity. Concepts, scales, and items were developed primarily from readings of qualitative research on alternative masculinities. Nine dimensions with 14 items each was sent to 15 experts for content validity assessment. A final pool of 101 items distributed across 9 constructs (10 - 12 items per scale) was distributed to undergraduate males at Western University (N = 497). Participants also completed the Conformity to Masculine Norms Inventory (CMNI- 46; Parent 2 ̆ 6 Moradi, 2009), the Aggression Questionnaire (Buss 2 ̆ 6 Perry, 1992), the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire – Short Form (TEIQue-SF; Petrides, 2009) and the HEXACO Personality Inventory-short version (Ashton 2 ̆ 6 Lee, 2009) for construct validation purposes. Item descriptive statistics and separate factor analyses were inspected for each construct to evaluate unidimensionality. One scale was removed due to its inability to adequately represent a homogeneous set of items. The other 8 scales displayed evidence of unidimensionality and were analysed together using a combination of Exploratory Structural Equation Model (ESEM) with a target rotation and CFA. Weak items, defined as items with loadings below. 30 on their hypothesized scales or high loadings on other scales were removed one at a time using an iterative process. During this process, another full scale and multiple items were removed. In the end, I retained 7 scales with 6 items each, for a total of 42 items. All items load strongly on their scales (range. 414 -. 823) and have low cross-loadings on other scales. The seven remaining scales are labelled <b>Homophilia,</b> Emotional Openness, Cooperation, Avoidance of Physical Aggression, Reticence, Gender Egalitarian, and Intimacy Orientation. A higher order factor structure reveals all scales load significantly onto a latent “progressive masculinity” construct, loadings range from. 506 -. 771. Final CFA and ESEM models show good level of fit. Average scores for the scales and full measure were created and compared to the scale and full measure scores of the CMNI, revealing a good level of convergent and discriminant validity. In order to evaluate the distinctiveness of the ALT-M from the CMNI, these two instruments were compared in terms of their relationships with the HEXACO, Aggression Questionnaire, and Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire. Strong evidence of construct distinctiveness is provided. Finally, a Latent Profile Analysis was conducted on the measure, revealing four unique masculinity profiles that differ in shape, ethnic composition, and trait aggression levels. Overall the ALT-M has sound psychometric properties and can be used to delineate multiple unique masculinities. It will benefit from future cross validation in terms of its factorial structure and profiles...|$|E
