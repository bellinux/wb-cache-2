40|$|This paper explores current printer {{identification}} techniques which allow {{the origins of}} a printed document to be established. The printer {{used to create a}} particular document can be traced by using unique and hidden information contained within that document. Printer identification can ultimately lead to the printer’s owner(s) which provides a valuable tool to government agencies during criminal investigations involving forged documents or associated correspondence. Two groups of {{printer identification}} technique are examined. Passive techniques utilise microscopic <b>flaws</b> <b>in</b> a document’s <b>print</b> for printer matching while active techniques explicitly embed traceable data into a document. Evidence has emerged to suggest that embedding tracking data into printed documents has been employed since the 1980 s. No legal precedents need be followed to obtain and use hidden tracking data nor does the public have to be informed of this practice. Related privacy concerns are discussed brought about by the potential to compromise the anonymity of every single printed document...|$|R
25|$|This last {{printing}} {{may have}} consisted of several printing runs or perhaps was contracted out to different printers. While no deliberate {{changes to the}} text block have been noted, the binding cloth and the text block's paper stock both changed at times, and <b>flaws</b> developed <b>in</b> the <b>printing</b> plates over time. One of the cloth variants {{is similar to the}} first printing's, but even yellower. Another shows an even weave with light, very even oatmeal coloring that can even seem faintly pink in some light. Its cloth shows deep, vivid blues in the lettering, whereas the others look obviously paler. Yet another variant carries a variegated linen-like weave wherein individual threads can stand out for several centimeters. This latter is as dark as the binding of the third printing (while lacking the yellow cast), but the coloring is so uneven that it might be mistaken as soiled even when clean. Soiling on the other variants, on the other hand, is immediately apparent.|$|R
