40|$|Graduation date: 2014 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from March 27, 2014 - March 27, 2015 To become a competitor for fossil fuels such as coal, solar installations {{will need to be}} produced and installed at a price equal to or below grid parity. This price can be approached by either reducing the overall system cost or increasing system efficiency. The focus of this paper is on increasing both cell and module efficiency through application of nanotechnology and by numeral modeling. The first portion of this dissertation will focus on the production and characterization of zinc oxide urchin-like nanostructures. These nanostructures have a very high surface area to volume ratio. Such nanostructures could be appropriate for dye sensitized solar cells, an emergent PV technology. The second portion focuses on improving a solar module’s anti-reflective properties. In a traditional glass-encapsulated solar module at least 4 % of the incoming light is lost to reflections off of the first optical interface alone. This in turn lower system efficiency and increases the levelized cost of energy. The power loss can be reduced greatly by thin film or gradient index anti-reflective coatings. An in-depth review of the current options for mathematical modeling of the optics of anti-reflective coatings is presented. The following chapter describes a numerical approach to anti-reflective interface design and a comparison between the finite-difference time-domain and the transfer matrix method of optical modeling. The last chapter describes several approaches to applying anti-reflective coatings to solar module lamination materials, including glass and a flexible substrate, fluorinated <b>ethylene</b> <b>polymer.</b> Scale up deposition of the anti-reflective coating on the flexible substrate is discussed...|$|E

40|$|In general, polymer blends {{are most}} often {{developed}} {{in order to raise}} toughness of conventional polymers and to overcome processing difficulties of certain polymers. These enhancements however, can be obtained providing good compatibility between blend components by purposeful selection of the blend components, compatibilization or modification in the case of necessity and choosing the most appropriate processing regimes. In order to satisfy the demands of new technologies there is growing incentive of using new polymer grades with more regular structure and better predictable and reproductable macromolecular characteristics for developing of polymer-polymer composites. Thus new polypropylene (PP) grades with optimized crystallization behaviour and metallocene ethylene copolymers with stable easy controllable structure and narrow molecular weight distribution and high co-monomer arrangement regularity are perspective candidates for building of new polymer-polymer composites. Besides it, due to structural affinity of PP with <b>ethylene</b> <b>polymers</b> no major technical problems for the compatibility development between the components are expected.

40|$|Pd {{black was}} exposed to {{ethylene}} alone or in its mixture with hydrogen at 300 and 573 K. The samples were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). Room temperature introduction of C 2 H 4 (also {{in the presence of}} H 2) induced a binding-energy (BE) shift in the Pd 3 d doublet and changed its full width at half-maximum (fwhm). The UPS features indicate shifting of electrons from the Pd d-band to Pd-H, Pd-C, and even Pd-OH species. Vinylidene (BE 284. 1 eV) may be the most abundant indiVidual surface species on disperse Pd black, along with carbon in various stages of polymerization: “disordered C” (BE ~ 284 eV), graphite (~ 284. 6 eV), and <b>ethylene</b> <b>polymer</b> (~ 286 eV), and also some “atomic” C (BE ~ 283. 5 eV). Introduction of H 2 followed by ethylene brought about stronger changes in the state of Pd than exposure in the reverse sequence. This may indicate that the presence of some surface C may hinder the decomposition of bulk PdH. Formation of Pd hydride was blocked when ethylene was introduced prior to H 2. The C 1 s intensity increased, the low-binding-energy C components disappeared, and graphitic carbon (BE 284. 6 eV) prevailed after ethylene treatment at 573 K. The loss of the Pd surface state and “PdH” signal were observed in the corresponding valence band and UPS spectra. Hydrogen treatment at 540 K was not able to decrease the concentration of surface carbon and re-establish the near-surface H-rich state. UPS showed overlayer-type C in these samples. The interaction of Pd with components from the feed gas modified its electronic structure that is consistent with lattice strain induced by dissolution of carbon and hydrogen into Pd, as indicated by the d-band shift and the dilution of the electron density at EF...|$|E
40|$|Sulphide stress {{corrosion}} cracking, (SSCC) {{is one of}} the major problems encountered by the petroleum industry throughout the world. The problem is likely to increase in severity for the North Sea oil and gas industries as the fields get older and platforms are moved to deeper waters. This is because the hydrogen sulphide concentration increases as the fields get older and deeper water explorations require higher strength steels. The protective measures taken at present to combat SSCC are not adequate. Therefore a novel method was developed to inhibit SSCC in steel. This method is based on using an active hydrogen evolution sulphide electro-catalyst, more active than steel, as a coat on the surface of the steel, such that the hydrogen evolution will take place on the catalyst surface, instead of on the corroding steel surface. Therefore, the amount of hydrogen diffusing through the steel is greatly reduced. Hence, SSCC in the steel is effectively inhibited. Electrochemical and mechanical experimental studies were carried out to confirm the validity of this method A computer-aided literature survey on SSCC and its prevention in oil- and gas-well equipment is presented. The viability of three sulphide electro-catalysts, NiCo₂S₄, MoS₂ and WS₂ for this method were studied in various experiments, namely, electrochemical polarization, hydrogen diffusion studies and corrosion weight loss measurements. The experimental studies carried out in NACE solution, consisting of a 5 percent (mass/volume) NaCl and 0. 5 percent (volume/volume) acetic acid, with a continuous flow of H₂S at 1 atmospheric pressure, indicated that hydrogen evolution performances are in the following order: in the absence of H₂S, NiCo₂, S₄ > WS₂, > MoS₂> EN 42 steel in the presence of H₂S, MoS₂> WS₂> NiCo₂S₄> EN 42 steel MoS₂was found to be the most stable catalyst in the sour corrosive environment. Evans diagrams, constructed to predict corrosion rates, indicate that the corrosion current ratio of the MoS₂ - EN 42 steel couple and EN 42 steel did not change significantly when the catalyst loading was reduced. The hydrogen diffusion studies confirmed that an MoS₂/ FEP (fluoro <b>ethylene</b> <b>polymer)</b> adherent coat with higher catalyst to FEP ratio was the most effective of three adherent coats. The corrosion weight loss measurements showed that the corrosion rates of steel coupons partially coated with MoS₂/ FEP coat were higher than those of uncoated coupons for up to 50 hours but thereafter they reduced significantly below those of uncoated coupons. Mechanical studies carried out to eväluate the effectiveness of this method were helped by a literature survey on {{stress corrosion}} test methods and interpretation of results. Slower straining/loading rate tests and sustained load tests were selected to study the changes in various mechanical parameters on different types of specimens when protected with MoS₂ / FEP coat. In addition to these tests, Charpy impact tests were also carried out. The mechanical parameters measured on the specimens are: a) for compact tension specimens - stress intensity factor at failure - total energy required for fracturing the specimen - average energy consumed for unit length of crack extension - crack opening displacement - crack growth rate - time to failure b) for three-point bend specimens - crack opening displacement c) for Charpy V-notch impact test specimens - fracture energy All these mechanical parameters confirm the effectiveness of the MoS₂ / FEP coat to inhibit SSCC in steel. Scanning electron microscopic examinations of the specimens also confirmed the viability of the novel protective method. The sour-corrosion fatigue tests showed that the MoS₂ / FEP coat could be used effectively in environments where a cyclic loading pattern is inevitable. These studies confirm that the proposed protective technique could be used effectively in the oil and gas industries to inhibit SSCC...|$|E
