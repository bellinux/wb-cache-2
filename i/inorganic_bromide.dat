These approaches were compared with one another, as well as with the ICP-MS method previously adopted, not only with regard to their performance, but also in terms of the interferences caused by the composition of final samples coming from the microwave digestion procedure. The results found pointed out unambiguously that IC turns out to be well suited for replacing ICP-MS, thanks to its consistency with the composition of digested samples and its good sensitivity which allows a quite low detection limit for bromides (0. 2 mg kg(- 1)) to be achieved.

40|$|An {{improved}} microwave {{digestion procedure}} is described for the {{inductively coupled plasma}} mass spectrometric (ICP-MS) determination of <b>inorganic</b> <b>bromide</b> residues in foodstuffs fumigated with methyl bromide. It {{is based on the}} addition to the usual acid oxidizing mixture of small amounts of silver ions which cause bromides from the mineralized matrix to precipitate as sparingly soluble AgBr, thus, avoiding losses due to their conversion into Volatile products. The silver bromide precipitate separated from the digested sample is dissolved with ammonia and the cationic complex [Ag(NH 3) (2) ](+) thus formed is removed on a cation-exchange column. The resulting solution is finally acidified and added with indium internal standard, to make it suitable for inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometric (ICP-MS) analysis. This modified procedure has been tested for the analysis of synthetic KBr samples by obtaining totally satisfactory results, in that bromide recoveries ranging from 98. 6 to 100. 2 % were found, with an overall standard deviation of 5. 17 %. Its application to the bromide determination in some mushroom samples is reported and the results found are compared with those obtained on the same samples mineralized by conventional alkali fusion.

The vital status as of 31 December 1976 was determined for 3384 (95 %) of these workers: 2806 (79 %) were still living and 578 (16 %) had died. Death certificates were obtained for 541 deaths (94 % of all deaths). The mortality experience of the entire cohort and several subcohorts was {{compared with that of}} United States white men adjusted for age and calendar time. The comparison statistic was the commonly used standardised mortality ratio (SMR). Historical industrial hygiene data were not available, and the workers were classified by their work areas or departments in order to estimate their potential exposures. Overall mortality for the entire cohort and several subgroups was significantly lower than expected. For the entire cohort, significant mortality deficits were observed in diseases of the circulatory system, non-malignant respiratory disease, and diseases of the digestive system. On the other hand, mortality from diabetes mellitus was significantly raised for the cohort. No significant overall or cause-specific mortality excess was detected among employees potentially exposed to either TRIS or DDT. A significant mortality excess due to diseases of the circulatory system was observed among workers potentially exposed to DBCP. Mortality from testicular cancer was significantly higher than expected among those potentially exposed to other organic bromides. The common potential exposure of those who had died of testicular cancer was methyl bromide. Owing to the lack of accurate historical exposure information and the fact that many workers were potentially exposed to a multitude of chemicals, it is difficult to draw definitive statements on the causations of the observed mortality excesses...|$|R
40|$|Iodine is an {{essential}} trace element for all mammals and may also influence climate through new aerosol formation. Atmospheric bromine cycling is also important due to its well-known ozone depletion capabilities. Despite precipitation being the ultimate source of iodine in the terrestrial environment, the processes effecting its distribution, speciation and transport are relatively unknown. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the effect of orographically induced precipitation on iodine concentrations in snow and also to quantify the inorganic and organic iodine and bromine species. Snow samples were collected over an altitude profile (~ 840 m) from the northern Black Forest and were analysed by ion-chromatography - inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (IC-ICP-MS) for iodine and bromine species and trace metals (ICP-MS). All elements and species concentrations in snow showed significant (r 2 > 0. 65) exponential decrease relationships with altitude despite the short (5 km) horizontal distance of the transect. In fact, total iodine more than halved (38 to 13 nmol/l) over the 840 m height change. The results suggest that orographic lifting and subsequent precipitation has a major influence on iodine concentrations in snow. This orographically induced removal effect may be more important than lateral distance from the ocean in determining iodine concentrations in terrestrial precipitation. The microphysical removal process was common to all elements indicating that the iodine and bromine are internally mixed within the snow crystals. We also show that organically bound iodine is the dominant iodine species in snow (61 – 75 %), followed by iodide. Iodate was only found in two samples despite a detection limit of 0. 3 nmol/l. Two unknown but most likely anionic organo-I species were also identified in IC-ICP-MS chromatograms and comprised 2 – 10 % of the total iodine.

40|$|Haloorganic {{biocides}} {{are widely}} employed as soil fumigants {{to combat the}} destructive action of plant parasitic nematodes and fungi. These substances are dehalogenated by soil organisms, principally species of Pseudomonas and Flavobacteria, to nontoxic metabolites. The paths of metabolism {{of a variety of}} simply alkyl halides are described with emphasis upon the biodehalogenation step. Simple alkyl halides are widely employed throughout California and elsewhere as soil fumigants to combat the destructive action of plant parasitic nematodes and fungi. Typical of this class of compounds are: methyl bromide, chloropicrin, ethylene dibromide, 1, 2 -dibromo- 3 -chloropropane, and cis- and trans- 1, 3 -dichloropropene. In addition to their broad biocidal capacities, these compounds are volatile and possess good diffusion characteristics. Analyses, in our laboratory, of the edible portion of crops grown in orchards and fields throughout the state that had been fumigated with these substances showed no organic halide to be present. On the other hand, an increase in <b>inorganic</b> <b>bromide</b> or chloride compared to that of untreated check crops could be detected. These results corroborated earlier industrial findings. The lack of organic halide in any crop suggested that these substances may be metabolized or simply chemically degraded within the soil environment. Such is, indeed, the case, and I wish to present here some of the variety of biodehalogenation processes we have encountered. In many ways they resemble the transformations some of you have noted or expect in liver microsomes. Finally, I wish to comment on the reaction of iron porphyrins and hemeproteins with alkyl halides.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{established}} that chlorination of naturally coloured waters produces chloroform and other trihalomethanes in concentrations that are considerably higher {{than most of the}} organic microcontaminants commonly found in polluted surface waters. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the origin of the trihalomethanes in drinking water and the mechanism responsible for their formation. Chapter 1 gives a historical survey of the use of chlorine in drinking water treatment. The main application of chlorine originally was disinfection. Soon after, chlorination became common practice for the oxidative removal of earthy tastes and odors. Additionally the bleaching of naturally coloured water was found to be advantageous. As a result of studies of the various reactions between chlorine and inorganic ammonium the breakpoint phenomenon was discovered in 1940. Since then breakpoint chlorination is used for quantitative removal of ammonium from raw water. Until that time alternate methods of removal included biological means such as slow sand filtration. Breakpoint chlorination led to the development of water purification methods that could be accomplished by entirely physico-chemical treatment. However, as the levels of pollution of river Rhine water increased, the experience in Rotterdam was that breakpoint chlorination became less and less effective. Additionally the taste was adversely affected. In 1965 gaschromatography was applied in an attempt to determine the reaction products responsible for the taste problem. Chapter 2 describes the development in our laboratory of a modified headspace vapour analysis method for water. This allowed for the capture of minute amounts of volatile organics before and after chlorination of the river water. The technique basically is a static method in which a gas volume (headspace) is brought into equilibrium with the water sample. The headspace gas is collected on a cold trapping column which contains the same adsorbent as used for the stationary phase in the subsequent gaschromatographic separation. Using this technique for drinking water four large peaks were found which were not present in the untreated water. The four compounds were identified with chloroform, dichloro-bromomethane, chloro-dibromomethane and bromoform. Chapter 3 gives the analytical data obtained from Rotterdam drinking water, first prepared from river Rhine and later from river Meuse. Surprisingly the same four haloforms were found after chlorination of both waters. It was analytically established that the chlorine gas didnot contain trihalomethanes. Neither did it contain bromine in detectable amounts, i. e. less than 100 mg/kg. In an investigation of natural waters chloroform formation was found to occur after chlorination of samples from several unpolluted ponds and. lakes. Those that contained bromide-ions in concentrations higher thans 0. 1 mg/l also gave the brominated trihalomethanes. It was suspected that both the organic precursor for chloroform and the inorganic precursor for the brominated compounds were present in all types of natural waters. Chlorination resulted in the oxidation of Br -to HBrO, which in turn is known to react as a halogenating agent. Chapter 4 : Since the major soluble organic compounds in natural waters are humic substances - mainly fulvic acids - it was logical to assume that they are the organic precursor. Humic acids contain both carboxylic and phenolic functionalities. Polyphenols are known to make up for the bulk of the degradation products of humic acids. Furthermore several polyhydroxybenzenes are known to give the iodoform reaction. The combination of the latter two facts led to the theory that polyphenolic structures in the humic acid matrix are the reactive sites from which chloroform is formed. To prove this, the principle experiment consisted of chlorination of peat extracts and aqueous solutions of commercial humic acids. Both solutions gave chloroform when treated with chlorine. Addition of <b>inorganic</b> <b>bromide</b> before chlorination resulted in the formation of all four haloforms. Chapter 5 involves an investigation of the specific type of polyhydroxybenzene responsible for chloroform-formation. Compounds in which two hydroxy-groups are in the meta-position gave the highest yields of chloroform. We also found that in the methylethers of resorcinol and phloroglucinol the formation of chloroform is suppressed. This led to the theory that the phenoxide-ion is essential for the formation of the halogenated mono-carbon degradation product. It is a reasonable assumption that in the competetive oxidation and substitution reactions the aromatic nucleus is destroyed to give an alpha-chlorinated ketone. A reaction mechanism is proposed in which the carbon atom in between two meta-positioned OH-groups is chlorinated twice. This is followed by scission into a linear alpha-ketone. This intermediate is further chlorinated to RCCl 3 according to the pathways known to occur in the haloform reaction. In chapter 6 cursory pilot plant studies focused on removal of chloroform by adsorption on activated carbon are described. It was found that the adsorptive capacity of carbon for chloroform was too low to be of interest. Further investigation aimed at the removal of the fulvic acids which are the precursor for the trihalomethanes. Pre-ozonation was tried but had little effect. Some experimental results with macroporous ion exchance resins appear effective in removing a major portion of the precursor for the haloformformation...|$|E

This stationary phase was used for ion-exchange capillary electrochromatography of inorganic anions in a 75 -μm-i. d. capillary with Tris/perchlorate electrolyte and direct UV detection at 195 nm. Seven <b>inorganic</b> anions (<b>bromide,</b> nitrate, iodide, iodate, bromate, thiocyanate, chromate) could be separated {{over a period of}} 90 s, and the elution order indicated that both ion exchange and electrophoresis contributed to the separation mechanism. Separation efficiencies of up to 1. 66 × 105 plates m- 1 were achieved, and the monoliths were stable under pressures of up to 62 MPa. Another latex-coated monolith in a 250 -μm-i. d. capillary was used for in-line preconcentration by coupling it to a separation capillary in which the EOF had been reversed using a coating of either a cationic polymer or cationic latex particles. Several capillary volumes of sample were loaded onto the preconcentration monolith, and the analytes (inorganic anions) were then eluted from the monolith with a transient isotachophoretic gradient before being separated by electrophoresis in the separation capillary. Linear calibration curves were obtained for aqueous mixtures of bromide, nitrite, nitrate, and iodide. Recoveries of all analytes except iodide were reduced significantly when the sample matrix contained high levels of chloride. The preconcentration method was applied to the determination of iodide in open ocean water and provided a limit of detection of 75 pM (9. 5 ng/L) calculated at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3. The relative standard deviation for migration time and peak area for iodide were 1. 1 and 2. 7 %, respectively (n = 6).

Two different experimental procedures were used for these purpose: the direct UV detection of vitamines and the indirect UV detection of inorganic anions. As an example for the direct absorption technique, the separation of the water soluble vitamines, has been performed with a 50 #mu#m inner diameter capillary using 20 mmol phosphate buffer at pH 7. The vitamines samples were introduced by electromigration to the capillary and detected by direct UV-detection at a 215 nm wavelength. The rms-values of the migration times were determined as follows: thiamine hydro chloride 1. 12 %, nicotinic acid amide 3. 21 % and nicotinic acid 9. 50 %. The rms values for the introduced amounts of samples show to be lower than 6. 2 % for all 3 vitamines. The limit of detections (LOD) for three vitamines were: thiamine hydrochloride 404 #mu#g/l, nicotinic acid amide 97 #mu#g/l and nicotinic acid 616 #mu#g/l using a 50 #mu#m diameter capillary. According to the principal of indirect absorption, the 8 <b>inorganic</b> anions, <b>bromide,</b> chloride sulfate, nitrite, nitrate, fluoride, hydrophosphate and hydrocarbonate acid have been separated in a second separation procedure by using a UV background providing compound (chromate pH 8. 05) in a 75 #mu#m inner diameter capillary.

These Kass values of anions with C 12 N 3 S increased as follows: Cl− (4. 2 ± 0. 1) <IO 3 − (4. 6 ± 0. 1) <Br− (5. 9 ± 0. 1) <NO 2 − (6. 2 ± 0. 1) <MoO 42 − (7. 8 ± 0. 1) <NO 3 − (14 ± 1) <ClO 3 − (26 ± 1) <I− (68 ± 7) <SCN− (310 ± 30) <ClO 4 − (800 ± 200) dm 3 mol− 1. Similar Kass values {{were obtained for}} C 14 N 3 S micelles, but Kass values of these anions with a non-ionic surfactant and with a non-surfactant-type zwitterion (used for comparative purposes) were small. The Kass values of cations with the C 12 N 3 S micelle in 10 mM imidazole– 20 mM 2 -morpholinoethanesulfonic acid (MES) buffer of pH 6. 2 increased as follows: Rb+ (1. 4 ± 0. 1) =Cs+ (1. 4 ± 0. 1) =K+ (1. 4 ± 0. 1) <Na+ (3. 2 ± 0. 1) <Li+ (4. 5 ± 0. 1) <Mg 2 + (7. 8 ± 0. 1) <Ce 3 + (12 ± 1) dm 3 mol− 1.

The magnitude of the selectivity change was evaluated from the association constants (Kass) between the zwitterionic surfactants { 3 -(N,N-dimethyldodecylammonio) propane sulfonate and 3 -(N,N-dimethylmyristylammonio) propane sulfonate} micelles and the inorganic ions. The largest Kass value was 800 dm 3 mol- 1 for the perchlorate ion among the 10 inorganic anions. The perchlorate ion {{could also be used}} an the additive in the BGE for a selectivity change of the inorganic anions. On the other hand, the Kass values for the 7 inorganic cations were small compared to those for the inorganic anions. When carboxylate ions and amines as additives in the BGE were used, the separation selectivity of copper(II) in 5 transition-metal ions {iron(II), cobalt(II), nickel(II), copper(II), and zinc(II) ions} could be signiticantly changed. The magnitude of the selectivity change was also evaluated from the stepwise coordination constants (KCuL 1 and KCuL 2) between [Cu(phen derivative) 2] 2 + (phen= 1, 10 -phenanthroline) pre-complexed copper(II) with the phen derivatives and the carboxylate ions in the BGE and between the Cu(II) -Alizarin complexone complex anion formed by an on-line complexation and the amines in the BGE. The mechanism of the separation selectivity was considered based on the KCuL 1 and KCuL 2 values. Furthermore, when pyridinedicarboxylates (PDCs) as chelate reagents for the on-line complexation were used, the separation selectivity of cobalt(II) and copper(II) could be changed. The migration orders were cobalt(II) <copper(II) and copper(II) <cobalt(II) for both 2, 3 - and 2, 5 -PDC and 2, 4 -PDC, respectively.

Substances such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and chlorinated organic compounds in contaminated soil and groundwater can have severe and long-lasting effects on health in animals and humans. There is an urgent need {{for the development of}} safe technologies for their effective removal. Originally developed for mineral processing, mechanical treatment by ball milling is an extremely versatile technique for the degradation of toxic compounds. Reactive milling can rapidly destroy organic compounds without producing hazardous wastes. Complete breakdown of the organic molecules is achieved after relatively short milling times. Successful tests were conducted on polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs), DDT, DDD, DDE, Dieldrin and hexachlorobenzene with a conversion yield in the of greater than 99 % (Hall et al., 1996; Monagheddu et al., 2000; Zhang et al., 2001; Zhang et al., 2002; Tanaka and Zhang, 2003; Pizzigallo et al., 2004; Nomura et al., 2005; Bellingham, 2006). In this study reactive ball milling was used to investigate the destruction of two classes of persistent {{organic pollutants}} environmental contaminants. The compounds studied are either known environmental pollutants or simple analogues. These were chosen as being representative of pollutants to investigate the pathway using ball milling destruction and in most cases were relatively small molecules so that the intermediates could be more easily identified. The first class of compounds was polycyclic aromatic compounds. Some smaller members of this class such as naphthalene, anthracene were investigated. The second class of compounds were some analogues of environmentally hazardous hydroxylated and halogenated compounds such as chloronaphthalene, bromonaphthalene, 1 - naphthol, 2 -naphthol and pentachlorophenol under reactive milling using GCMS analysis of the degradation pathway. Destruction efficiencies greater than 99 % have been achieved for a number of organic compounds. Several different intermediates have been identified during the milling degradation. There was also some evidence from this study that halogens could be transferred between compounds during milling. The final products of the milling destruction of these compounds are an amorphous carbon residue and <b>inorganic</b> chloride or <b>bromides.</b> It was proposed that large amounts of halogens could be found however the results showed that small amounts detected. At early stages of milling a number of intermediate breakdown products were detected which were destroyed on extended milling.

30|$|For the {{separation}} of large molecules, polymeric monoliths (due to their biocompatibility and large domain size morphology) showed better performance than silica monoliths (Smith and Jiang, 2008; Vlakh and Tennikova, 2009). But for isocratic separation of the low-molecular-weight, organic compound is relatively poor in polymeric monoliths; {{it is because of}} an absence of mesopore, a presence of micropore, and a structural inhomogeneity (causing flow dispersion) (Guiochon, 2007; Svec, 2010). Eeltink et al. studied {{the separation}} of complex proteolytic digest by using 50 -mm, 250 -mm, and 1 -m-long poly(styrene-co-divinylbenzene) monolithic capillary column by coupling with LC-MS/MS separation. They observed that 50 -mm column has the maximum peak capacity of 400. Moreover, 20 % of peak capacity increases with 5 -fold increase in the column length, which could be explained by the larger macropore size of the 250 -mm-long monolith. Taking gradient time, dwell time, and equilibrium time into consideration, 50 -mm monolithic column has better peptide separation than 250 -mm monolithic column. On the other hand, 250 -mm monolithic column has the highest peak production rate (Eeltink et al. 2010). Zhang et al. showed that sulfonate strong cation exchange (SCX) hybrid monolithic columns had seven times more permeability and three times more sample loading capacity compared to the commercially available particulate SCX column. They also compared sulfonate SCX hybrid monolithic columns with phosphate SCX polymer monolithic column and found a 19 % increase in the phosphopeptides identification (sulfonate group bind peptide cation stronger than phosphate group) (Z. Zhang, Wang, et al. 2012 a). Cambra et al. demonstrated that {{the separation of}} tryptic digest of industrial enzymes is best done by particulate shell-core C 18 columns (Kinetes, 2.6  μm) followed by silica monolithic column and (Chromolith RP- 18 e) conventional C 18 columns (Gemini, 5 or 3  μm) and then by polymeric monolithic column (ProSwift) (Beneito-Cambra, Herrero-Martínez, Ramis-Ramos, Lindner, and Lämmerhofer, 2011). Eeltink et al. used a poly(styrene-co-divinylbenzene) monolithic capillary column for the separation of protein isoforms coupled with MS. Formic acid were added as an ion pairing agent (Eeltink et al. 2011). Liu et al. used a polymeric weak anion exchange monolithic capillary for high-resolution separation of glycoprotein isoforms. They separated glycoproteins and found them to be distinct glycoforms (Liu, Ren, Liu, Li, and Liu, 2012). Ivanov et al. separated tryptic digest peptide mixtures by using polymeric polystyrene-divinylbenzene monolithic nanocapillary columns of an internal diameter of 20  μm (Ivanov, Zang, and Karger, 2003). He et al. prepared an amino acid-based polymeric monolithic column by using chiral amino acid surfactant containing acryloyl amide tail, a carbamate linker, and leucine headgroup. They showed the separation of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine-containing multiple chiral centers by coupling CEC to MS (He, Wang, Morill, and Shamsi, 2012). Hutchinson et al. prepared latex coated polymeric monolithic ion-exchange stationary phase by using sulfonated methacrylate monolithic polymer and coated it with quaternary latex particles. They separated seven <b>inorganic</b> anions like <b>bromide,</b> nitrate, iodide, iodate, bromate, thiocyanate, and chromate within 90  s (Hutchinson et al. 2005).|$|R
40|$|The present {{globalization}} of energy shortage and environmental pollution issues have posed a grave menace to human survival and development. Finding a viable supply of clean, renewable energy {{is one of}} the most daunting challenges facing the world. Solar cells as devices that convert solar energy into electricity is the focus of the whole society. However, conventional solar cells have had limited impact in meeting this challenge because of their high pollution, high cost and low power conversion efficiencies. Recently, colloid quantum dot solar cells (CQDSCs) and perovskite solar cells (PSCs) as new generation solar cells have been attracting immense attention owing to their inexpensive solution-based techniques and high theoretical power conversion efficiency. However, stability is still a big problem for CQDSCs and PSCs, and charge dynamics in those solar cells are not clear. To obtain stable CQDSCs and PSCs through interface modification, and reveal the charge dynamics in those solar cells are the central aim of this thesis. This thesis investigated the surface ligand dependent charge carrier dissociation, charge carrier transmission and recombination of CQDSCs, and used novel hole transport materials to modify the interface of CQDSCs and PSCs to reduce the interfacial recombination in CQDSCs and PSCs. In this thesis, I explore a method to obtain air stable PbSe CQDs and surface ligand dependent exciton dissociation, recombination, photovoltaic property, and stability of PbSe solid films and CQDSCs. I select four short ligands, that is, two organic ligands 1, 2 -ethanedithiol (EDT) and 3 -mercaptopropionic acid (MPA); two <b>inorganic</b> ligand cetyltrimethylammonium <b>bromide</b> (CTAB) and tetrabutylammonium iodide (TBAI) to investigate the ligand-dependent air stability, energy level shift, the exciton dissociation, and photovoltaic properties of PbSe CQDSCs. In addition, the charge transfer rate, recombination processes and carrier lifetimes in these CQDSCs were also revealed through ultrafast transient absorption (TA) spectra, and open-circuit transient voltage (Voc) decay measurements. We also explore a method to suppress the interfacial recombination at QDs/Au electrode in CQDSCs by using organic small molecule. We develop a novel donor-π-donor (D-π-D) organic small molecule bis-triphenylamine with spiro(fluorene- 9, 9 ’-xanthene) as the conjugated system, named BTPA- 4, as a hole selective layer (HSL) in the PbS CQDSCs. We found that the introduction of BTPA- 4 as HSL can enhance the open-circuit voltage (Voc), prolong the effective carrier lifetime, reduce the interfacial recombination at PbS QDs/Au interface, and hence improve the device performance. Furthermore, the PbS CQDSCs with BTPA- 4 possessed a noticeably stable property for over 100 days of storage under ambient atmosphere that has been the Achilles 2 ̆ 7 heel of other organic HSL for CQDSCs. We also focus on hole transport materials and the interfacial recombination in PSCs. Three triphenylamine-based hole-transport materials (HTMs), named BTPA- 4, BTPA- 5 and BTPA- 6, were used into PSCs. BTPA- 6 with four substituted triphenylamine units exhibited a better solar cell performance than BTPA- 4 and BTPA- 5 which contain two substituted triphenylamine units. BTPA- 6 achieved a PCE of 14. 4...|$|R
40|$|Two new {{analytical}} methodologies {{were developed}} for chlorine and bromine stable isotope analyses of inorganic samples by Continuous-Flow Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry (CF-IRMS) coupled with gas chromatography (GC). <b>Inorganic</b> chloride and <b>bromide</b> were precipitated as silver halides (AgCl and AgBr) and then converted to methyl halide (CH 3 Cl and CH 3 Br) gases and analyzed. These new techniques require small samples sizes (1. 4 µmol of Cl- and 1 µmol of Br-). The internal precision using pure CH 3 Cl gas {{is better than}} ∓ 0. 04 ‰ (∓STDV) while the external precision using seawater standard is better than ∓ 0. 07 ‰ (∓STDV). The internal precision using pure CH 3 Br gas is better than ∓ 0. 03 ‰ (∓STDV) and the external precision using seawater standard is better than ∓ 0. 06 ‰ (∓STDV). Moreover, the sample analysis time is much shorter than previous techniques. The analyses times for chlorine and bromine stable isotopes are 16 minutes which are 3 - 5 times shorter than all previous techniques. Formation waters from three sedimentary settings (the Paleozoic sequences in southern Ontario and Michigan, the Williston Basin and the Siberian Platform) were analyzed for 37 Cl and 81 Br isotopes. The δ 37 Cl and δ 81 Br values of the formation waters from these basins are characterized by large variations (between - 1. 31 ‰ and + 1. 82 ‰ relative to SMOC and between - 1. 50 ‰ and + 3. 35 ‰ relative to SMOB, respectively). A positive trend between δ 81 Br and δ 37 Cl values was found in all basins, where an enrichment of δ 81 Br is coupled by an enrichment of δ 37 Cl. In the Paleozoic sequences in southern Ontario and Michigan, the δ 37 Cl and δ 81 Br signatures of formation water collected from northwest of the Algonquin Arch are distinct from those collected from southeast of the Arch. All of the brines from the northwest of the Algonquin Arch are characterized by depleted isotopic values {{in comparison with the}} isotopic values from the brines from southeast of the Arch. The δ 81 Br signatures of the two brines show total separation with no overlaps. The δ 37 Cl values show some overlap between the two groups. One of the scenarios that can be put forward is that the Arch forms a water divide, where sediments southeast of the Arch are dominated by Appalachian Basin formation waters, and the sediments located northwest of the Arch are dominated by the Michigan Basin formation waters. The δ 81 Br and δ 37 Cl signatures of the Williston Basin brines suggest the existence of several different brines that are isotopically distinct and located in different stratigraphic units, even though they are chemically similar. The relatively wide range of δ 37 Cl and δ 81 Br of the formation waters suggests that the ocean isotopic signatures were variable over geologic time. A seawater temporal curve for δ 81 Br and δ 37 Cl was proposed with a larger variation of δ 81 Br in comparison with δ 37 Cl. The isotopic variations of these two elements agree very well with 87 Sr/ 86 Sr seawater variation during the same period. In general, the use of chlorine and bromine stable isotopes can be very useful in assessing the origin and the evolutionary processes involved in evolving formation waters and also in distinguishing different brines (end members). Furthermore, they can be employed to investigate the hydrogeological dynamics of sedimentary basins...|$|R
