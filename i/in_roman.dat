5|$|After Rome {{conquered the}} Ptolemaic kingdom in 30BC, Roman {{emperors}} {{took on the}} role of ruler and temple patron, reducing the temples' wealth and political power. Many temples <b>in</b> <b>Roman</b> Egypt continued to be built in Egyptian style. Others, including some that were dedicated to Egyptian gods—such as the temple to Isis at Ras el-Soda—were built in a style derived from Roman architecture.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} prince, Augustus also gave Phraates IV an Italian slave-girl, {{who later became}} Queen Musa of Parthia. To ensure that her child Phraataces would inherit the throne without incident, Musa {{convinced}} Phraates IV to give his other sons to Augustus as hostages. Again, Augustus used this as propaganda depicting the submission of Parthia to Rome, listing it as a great accomplishment in his Res Gestae Divi Augusti. When Phraataces took the throne as Phraates V (r. c.2BC – 4AD), Musa married her own son and ruled alongside him. The Parthian nobility, disapproving of both the incestuous relationship {{and the notion of}} a king with non-Arsacid blood, forced the pair into exile <b>in</b> <b>Roman</b> territory. Phraates' successor Orodes III of Parthia lasted just two years on the throne, and was followed by Vonones I, who had adopted many Roman mannerisms during time in Rome. The Parthian nobility, angered by Vonones' sympathies for the Romans, backed a rival claimant, Artabanus III of Parthia (r. c.10–38AD), who eventually defeated Vonones and drove him into exile <b>in</b> <b>Roman</b> Syria.|$|E

40|$|Following on a {{previous}} article, three more problematic lexical items which occur repeatedly <b>in</b> <b>Romans</b> are discussed: [foreign font omitted] and [foreign font omitted]. Typical of the old, etymological approach, translators are often inclined to attach too much weight to the preposition [foreign font omitted] in [foreign font omitted] <b>In</b> <b>Romans</b> 8 : 16, for instance, {{it would be more}} appropriate to translate [foreign font omitted] in the sense of ‘affirm’: ‘[t]he Spirit of God affirms to our spirit that we are God’s children’. Despite all objections, rendering [foreign font omitted] as ‘Gentiles/Gentile nations’ still remains the best option. In certain contexts <b>in</b> <b>Romans,</b> it would be advisable to translate [foreign font omitted] as ‘I realise/am convinced’.
