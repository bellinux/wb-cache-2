40|$|The {{problem of}} {{optimizing}} the photovoltaic field orientation in stand-alone Photovoltaic-Hydrogen-Powered Distributed Power Systems (PHP-DPS) is treated in this paper. The system {{is supposed to}} be composed of a photovoltaic field, as energy source, and of a hydrogen energy backup subsystem including a hydrolyser, a hydrogen tank and a PEM fuel cell. Given the characteristics of the solar panels, of the switching converters and of the backup subsystem, three different load profiles have been considered with three typical <b>irradiation</b> <b>diagrams</b> corresponding to as many different typical days in a year. For each case study, the best photovoltaic field orientation, which involve the minimum number of panels to ensure the load power and energy requirements, has been found. Results of simulations allows to single the best configuration out, both whenever the system is supposed to work all the year round and if its operating period does not include winter. The paper puts in evidence that panels� orientations chosen according to the load time profile allow to reduce the plant cost, in terms of number of panels and backup size, and to save some amount of energy that is not processed by the backup subsystem. To this regard, the paper also highlights that the best design of a stand-alone PHP-DPS maximizes the flux of energy that goes straight from source to load, as the energy production matches the load needs as much as possible. This objective is particularly important in PHP-DPS that are characterized by a low efficiency back-up path...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the work is to develop a cost {{effective}} semistationary CPC concentrator for a string PV-module. A novel method of using annual <b>irradiation</b> distribution <b>diagram</b> projected in a north-south vertical plane is developed. This method allows us easily to determine the optimum acceptance angle of the concentrator and the required number of annual tilts. Concentration ranges of 2 - 5 x are investigated with corresponding acceptance angles between 5 and 15 &# 176;. The concentrator should be tilted 2 - 6 times per year. Experiments has been performed on a string module of 10 cells connected in a series and equipped with a compound parabolic concentrator with C = 3. 3 X. Measurement show that the output will increase with a factor of 2 - 2. 5 for the concentrator module, compared to a reference module without concentrator. If very cheap aluminium reflectors are used the costs for the PV-module can be decreased nearly by a factor of two...|$|R
40|$|Closing {{the nuclear}} fuel cycle, as {{studied in the}} frame of {{international}} programmes will be a major step in reducing the long term radiotoxicity of high level waste while optimizing the sustainability of uranium resources. The Joint Research Centre (JRC) has almost 50 years experience in safety studies associated with thermal and fast reactor fuels and corresponding reprocessing cycles. In the past, these studies were focused to a large extent on carbide and nitride compounds. Ongoing programmes are mainly dedicated to advanced oxide and metal alloy fuels bearing minor actinides (MA). Homogeneous MA recycling envisages a small addition of MA to the fuel, while heterogeneous recycling concepts include UO 2 -based targets and inert matrix fuels for fast and sub-critical reactor systems. The safety driven research activities cover most stages of the fuel cycle: dust-free liquid conversion processes; advanced techniques for the study (before and after irradiation) of key-safety-relevant aspects, such as thermal conductivity, mechanical properties, density, micro- and macro-structural evolution due to <b>irradiation,</b> phase <b>diagrams,</b> vapour pressure, fission product behaviour, fuel-cladding interactions, and basic properties and process investigations to assess safe and efficient aqueous and pyrometallurgical reprocessing routes.

40|$|We {{report on}} {{comparative}} study of magnetic properties of Pt/Co/Pt trilayers after irradiation with different light sources. Ultrathin Pt/Co/Pt films were deposited by molecular beam epitaxy technique on sapphire (0001) substrates. Pt buffers were grown at room temperature (RT) and at 750 °C (high temperature, HT). The samples were irradiated with {{a broad range of}} light energy densities (up to film ablation) using two different single pulse irradiation sources: (i) 40 fs laser with 800 nm wavelength and (ii) 3 ns laser-plasma source of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) with the most intense emission centered at 11 nm. The light pulse-driven irreversible structural and as a consequence, magnetic modifications were investigated using polar magneto-optical Kerr effect-based microscopy and atomic and magnetic force microscopies. The light pulse-induced transitions from the out-of-plane to in-plane magnetization state, and from in-plane to out-of-plane, were observed for both types of samples and <b>irradiation</b> methods. <b>Diagrams</b> of the magnetic states {{as a function of the}} Co layer thickness and energy density of the absorbed femtosecond pulses were constructed for the samples with both the RT and HT buffers. The energy density range responsible for the creation of the out-of-plane magnetization was wider for the HT than for RT buffer. This is correlated with the higher (for HT) crystalline quality and much smoother Pt/Co surface deduced from the X-ray diffraction studies. Submicrometer magnetic domains were observed in the irradiated region while approaching the out-of-plane magnetization state. Changes of Pt/Co/Pt structures are discussed for both types of light pulses...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{incidence}} angle modifier (IAM) of a {{solar thermal collector}} for diffuse irradiance is usually determined under the simplifying assumption of isotropic sky and ground radiance. It is applied as one constant collector parameter, independent from slope or weather conditions. The simulation model introduced here considers the varying anisotropy of sky radiance. To create realistic distributions, the approach of Brunger and Hooper is used. Three modes are possible: Mode 1 calculates separate IAMs for anisotropic sky (for every time step) and isotropic ground. Mode 2 calculates separate IAMs for isotropic sky and isotropic ground (once per simulation). Mode 3 uses a user-specified isotropic IAM-value for the collector hemisphere. The model is applied to a stationary, double-covered process heat flat-plate collector with one-sided CPC booster reflector (RefleC). This collector shows a biaxial and asymmetric IAM for direct irradiance. It is found that, compared to anisotropic modeling, the simplified isotropic model is undervaluing the annual output of this collector by 13. 7 % for a constant inlet temperature of 120 °C in Würzburg, Germany. At 40 °C inlet temperature the undervaluation is 9. 3 %. For the basis flat-plate without reflector the undervaluation is 7. 5 % at 120 °C and 3. 3 % at 40 °C. An annual <b>irradiation</b> distribution <b>diagram</b> shows that {{this is due to}} an underestimation of diffuse irradiation from directions with high direct irradiation. Detailed results reveal that for RefleC the IAM for anisotropic diffuse sky radiance can vary by up to approx. 25 percentage points during one day. It is concluded that isotropic modeling of diffuse irradiance can be expected to significantly undervalue the annual output of all non-focusing solar thermal collectors. Highest relevance is found for high collector slopes, complex IAMs and at low-efficiency operation. The optimal collector slope is almost not affected. Accuracy of existing models can be increased by applying Mode 2...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. In {{order to}} reduce the field {{inhomogeneity}} caused by edge effects and capacitance of two parallel metal plate electrode system we have proposed a mathematical model of conductive multilectrode cylindrical system. Analytical analysis techniques. According to the model the analysis of the distribution of the electric field inside the zone restricted with multiply connected circular boundary {{on the basis of the}} theory of singular integral equations in the form of conjugation problem is performed. The calculation of the electric field distribution is reduced to the consideration of partial problem where only one electrode possesses a non-zero voltage. It is shown that providing the harmonic feeding of the electrode system consisting of identically sized equally spaced arc-shaped electrodes with voltages of the same amplitudes and phases equal to the angular position of the electrode on the circle will ensure the feasibility of the rotating and homogeneous field in the area. The expressions for determination of the electric field strength in the area are given. Results and discussion. It is shown that the size of the field homogeneity zone depends on the number of electrodes in such a way that increasing the number of elements causes the increasing of the zone size, and with the number of electrodes equal to 8 the diameter of the zone is equal to 60 % of structure. It is proved that such an electrode system can be successfully applied for creating of apparatus for bulk materials <b>irradiation.</b> A schematic <b>diagram</b> of a generator for the electrodes supply and the principle of building of the apparatus for treat-ment of grain and other bulk materials with the electric field of high frequency are proposed. ???????? ?????? ????????????? ????????????? ?????????????? ???? ?????? ????????????, ????????????? ???????????? ????????? ???????? ?? ?????? ?????? ???????????? ??????????? ????????? ? ???? ?????? ??????????. ????????? ????????? ??????? ??? ??????????? ????????????? ?????????????? ???? ? ???????? ????. ?????????? ??????????? ????? ?????????? ??? ??????? ?????????? ? ??????? ?????????? ????????? ??? ????????? ????? ? ?????? ??????? ?????????? ????????????? ????? ??????? ???????...|$|R
