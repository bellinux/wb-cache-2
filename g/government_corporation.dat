25|$|The Penn Central's {{bankruptcy}} had {{a ripple}} effect on the Northeast economy. The PC bankruptcy absolved them from paying their debts, which included payments owed to other railroads. The PC's failure to pay was a major contribution to other Northeast lines that also entered bankruptcy protection. The bankruptcy was the final blow to long-haul private-sector passenger train service in the United States. The troubled company filed proposals with the ICC to abandon most of its remaining passenger rail service, causing a chain reaction among its fellow railroads, who also decided to drop their money losing passenger trains. In 1971 Congress created Amtrak, a <b>government</b> <b>corporation,</b> which began to operate a skeleton passenger service on the tracks of Penn Central and other U.S. railroads.|$|E
