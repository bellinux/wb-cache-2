As proposed by Strandell et al. (2004), when VDI is greater than 4  l (i.e. human blood volume), {{it is likely that}} in vivo herb–drug interactions occurred with the participation of hepatic CYP enzymes. According to the National Drug Standards (Traditional Chinese Medicine Prescription, Volume 2) (Ministry of Health, PR of China), the <b>dose</b> <b>unit</b> of HQ tablets is about 650  mg HQ extract in which 117  mg is baicalin. Based on this <b>dose</b> <b>unit</b> and the respective IC 50 values, the VDI of individual CYP 450 isoforms were estimated (Table  5). The estimated VDIs of all HQ extracts examined on CYP 1 A 2, CYP 2 C 9 and CYP 2 D 6 enzymes were greater than 4  l per <b>dose</b> <b>unit.</b> More importantly, based on the estimated VDIs, only the extract obtained using UE-E method illustrated a significant in vivo herb–drug interaction with CYP 3 A 4 -metabolized Western drugs.

40|$|As {{the number}} of persons chronically {{prescribed}} antiretrovirals has grown and the realization that antiretrovirals are required to be continued for life, pharmaceutical manufacturers have developed new classes of agents, improved the pharmacokinetics of marketed products through dosing reformulations, and {{in an effort to}} maximize success with respect to adherence, compiled into a single <b>dosing</b> <b>unit</b> all necessary elements for an antiretroviral regimen.

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the results of}} a pilot study of the reliability of the biokinetic and dosimetric models currently used by the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) as predictors of <b>dose</b> per <b>unit</b> internal or external exposure to radionuclides. The study examines the feasibility of critically evaluating the accuracy of these models for a comprehensive set of radionuclides of concern to the NRC. Each critical evaluation would include: identification of discrepancies between the models and current databases; characterization of uncertainties in model predictions of <b>dose</b> per <b>unit</b> intake or unit external exposure; characterization of variability in <b>dose</b> per <b>unit</b> intake or unit external exposure; and evaluation of prospects for development of more accurate models. Uncertainty refers here to the level of knowledge of a central value for a population, and variability refers to quantitative differences between different members of a population. This pilot study provides a critical assessment of models for selected radionuclides representing different levels of knowledge of <b>dose</b> per <b>unit</b> exposure. The main conclusions of this study are as follows: (1) To optimize the use of available NRC resources, the full study should focus on radionuclides most frequently encountered in the workplace or environment. A list of 50 radionuclides is proposed. (2) The reliability of a dose coefficient for inhalation or ingestion of a radionuclide (i. e., an estimate of <b>dose</b> per <b>unit</b> intake) may depend strongly on the specific application. Multiple characterizations of the uncertainty in a dose coefficient for inhalation or ingestion of a radionuclide may be needed for different forms of the radionuclide and different levels of information of that form available to the dose analyst. (3) A meaningful characterization of variability in <b>dose</b> per <b>unit</b> intake of a radionuclide requires detailed information on the biokinetics of the radionuclide and hence is not feasible for many infrequently studied radionuclides. (4) The biokinetics of a radionuclide in the human body typically represents the greatest source of uncertainty or variability in <b>dose</b> per <b>unit</b> intake. (5) Characterization of uncertainty in <b>dose</b> per <b>unit</b> exposure is generally a more straightforward problem for external exposure than for intake of a radionuclide. (6) For many radionuclides the most important outcome of a large-scale critical evaluation of databases and biokinetic models for radionuclides {{is expected to be the}} improvement of current models. Many of the current models do not fully or accurately reflect available radiobiological or physiological information, either because the models are outdated or because they were based on selective or uncritical use of data or inadequate model structures. In such cases the models should be replaced with physiologically realistic models that incorporate a wider spectrum of information...|$|R
40|$|The {{output factor}} for a therapy photon beam {{is defined as}} the <b>dose</b> per monitor <b>unit</b> {{relative}} to the <b>dose</b> per monitor <b>unit</b> in a reference field. Convolution models for photon dose calculations yield the <b>dose</b> in <b>units</b> normalized to the incident energy fluence with phantom scatter intrinsically modeled. Output factors calculated with the convolution method as the <b>dose</b> per <b>unit</b> energy fluence relative to the calculated <b>dose</b> per <b>unit</b> energy fluence in a reference field could deviate as much as 5 % if corrections are not made for perturbations due to treatment head scatter. Significant perturbations are particles backscattered from the collimators to the monitor and photons forward scattered from the filter and collimators in the treatment head. The forward scatter adds an "unmonitored" contribution to the total energy fluence of the beam. A model is developed that describes the field size dependence of these perturbations for conversion of output factors, calculated with the convolution method, to machine output factors as an integrated part in treatment planning. The necessary machine characteristics are derived from measurements of the output in air for a limited set of field sizes. The method has been tested using five different multileaf collimated irregular fields at 6 MV and for a large set of rectangular fields at 5, 6, and 18 MV and found to predict output factors with an accuracy better than 1 %...|$|R

40|$|Successful {{treatment}} of many diseases {{depends on the}} level of drug concentration in blood and its maintenance {{over a period of time}} around a value considered as therapeutic. The dose regimen that minimizes the underexposure and overexposure around the target concentration maximizes efficacy and safety, resulting in increased chances of a successful patient recovery. We present a method of computer-assisted dose finding by explicit optimization of a target criterion. We develop a general theory for such dose regimens and propose criteria for their computation. This approach is likely to supersede "brute force" techniques exclusively based on simulation. In case of a combination of two drugs in a single <b>dosing</b> <b>unit,</b> it is crucial that the optimal combination ratio is identified during the developmental process and is taken forward to further trials or approval. The algorithm computes the optimal ratio along with the optimal dose regimen. If the interest is in restricting the concentration profile of the drug to a therapeutic range, we adapt the algorithm to determine the optimal dose regimen. In future, this work is intended to aid the development of fixed dose combinations, especially antimalarials and other anti-infectives. The methodology also has potential applications in randomized concentration-controlled trials where adherence to the target concentration is a fundamental requirement. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Combined sewer {{overflows}} {{contribute significantly}} to pathogen loads in surface water. Some chemical disinfectants such as chlorine have proved to reduce the levels of microorganisms even in complex matrices such as wastewater in combined sewer systems; however, some of them release toxic by-products into water bodies and increase costs of plant maintenance and repair. In this study, we determined if performic acid (PFA) disinfection units can be operated at decentralized treatment facilities and reduce bacteria, viruses, and protozoan parasites in combined sewer overflows (CSOs). The PFA <b>dosing</b> <b>unit</b> at the inflow of a CSO storage tank dosed a fixed flow volume into the inflowing stormwater and, thus, concentrations varied between approximately 12 – 24 mg l− 1. The results showed a reduction of most hygienically relevant bacteria with mean removal efficiencies of 1. 8 log 10 for Aeromonas spp. and 3. 1 log 10 for E. coli. For viruses, however, reduction was only observed for somatic coliphages with 2. 7 log 10. In this setting, PFA {{does not seem to}} be suitable to remove e. g. protozoan parasites such as Giardia lamblia. In terms of operation, dosing the substance is uncritical in decentralized facilities, but the PFA needs too much time to react with pathogens after being dosed into the overflow of CSO storage tanks and before dilution with surface water in most facilities. © 2016 Elsevier Gmb...|$|E
