50|$|When the 4-volume luxury {{edition of}} the Sinai Bible was {{completed}} in 1862, C. Tischendorf presented the original ancient manuscript to Emperor Alexander II. Meanwhile, the question of transferring the manuscript to the full possession of the Russian Sovereign remained unresolved for some years. In 1869, the new Archbishop of Sinai, Callistratus, and the monastic community, signed the official certificate presenting the manuscript to the Czar. The Russian Government, in turn, bestowed the Monastery with 9000 rubles and decorated the Archbishop {{and some of the}} brethren with orders. In 1933 the Soviet Government sold the Codex Sinaiticus for 100,000 pounds to the British Museum in London, England.

500|$|With the {{elevation}} of Palmyra to a colonia around 213–216, the city ceased being subject to Roman provincial governors and taxes. Palmyra incorporated Roman institutions into its system while keeping many of its former ones. The council remained, and the strategos designated one of two annually-elected magistrates. This duumviri implemented the new colonial constitution, replacing the archons. Palmyra's political scene changed {{with the rise of}} Odaenathus and his family; an inscription dated to 251 describes Odaenathus' son Hairan I as [...] "Ras" [...] (lord) of Palmyra (exarch in the <b>Greek</b> <b>section</b> of the inscription) and another inscription dated to 252 describes Odaenathus with the same title. Odaenathus was probably elected by the council as exarch, which was an unusual title in the Roman empire and {{was not part of the}} traditional Palmyrene governance institutions. Whether Odaenathus' title indicated a military or a priestly position is unknown, but the military role is more likely. By 257 Odaenathus was known as a consularis, possibly the legatus of the province of Phoenice. In 258 Odaenathus began extending his political influence, taking advantage of regional instability caused by Sasanian aggression; this culminated in the Battle of Edessa, Odaenathus' royal elevation and mobilization of troops, which made Palmyra a kingdom.|$|E

40|$|Justification in {{mathematics}} {{is a very}} particular thing; no other field has such high standards placed {{on the notion of}} ‘proof’. There is justification and there is evidence. That non-deductive methods have long been seen as belonging to the latter category is uncontroversial. One contrarian to this view is Brown and his belief in a kind of non-deductive justification he calls ‘picture-proofs’. Brown's most recent and thorough treatment of picture-proofs is found in Philosophy of Mathematics: A Contemporary Introduction to the World of Proofs and Pictures published in 2008; the discussions contained therein will form the basis for this paper. This belief in picture-proofs will be placed {{in the context of the}} highly visual culture of Greek mathematics and through this, conclusions will be drawn about the validity and usefulness of these picture-proofs. Sections 1 - 3 will be devoted to the discussion of picture-proofs and Brown's argument for their existence. In this discussion, further arguments will be provided to supplement Brown's own with the view to establishing the strongest possible account of picture-proofs. Section 4 will consider the role of pictures in Greek mathematics and will introduce the question of whether Brown's interpretation of pictures has a place within <b>Greek</b> mathematics. <b>Section</b> 5 will clearly state what it means to assess Brown's view in the context of Greek mathematics. Following this, an attempt will be made to argue that Brown's views are consistent with <b>Greek</b> mathematics. <b>Section</b> 6 will attempt to bring these ideas together in an example from Euclid. Finally, Section 7 will discuss the state of picture-proofs given the conclusions so far drawn from the paper...|$|R
