5|$|When a room is {{occupied}} {{only by a}} single person, some men will position themselves to suggest what they might like from someone joining them in the room: those {{who would like to}} be penetrated anally ("bottoms") will sometimes lie face <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> with the door open, while those who prefer to penetrate others ("tops") or to receive fellatio might lie face up.|$|E
5|$|On Friday 9 November, prostitute Mary Jane Kelly {{was murdered}} in the single room where she lived at 13 Miller's Court, behind 26 Dorset Street, Spitalfields. One of the earlier victims, Chapman, had lived in Dorset Street, and another, Eddowes, was {{reported}} to have slept rough there. Kelly's severely mutilated body was discovered shortly after 10:45am lying on the bed. The first doctor at the scene, Dr George Bagster Phillips, believed that Kelly was killed by a slash to the throat. After her death, her abdominal cavity was sliced open and all her viscera removed and spread around the room. Her breasts had been cut off, her face mutilated beyond recognition, and her thighs partially cut through to the bone, with some of the muscles removed. Unlike the other victims, she was undressed and wore only a light chemise. Her clothes were folded neatly on a chair, with the exception of some found burnt in the grate. Abberline thought the clothes had been burned by the murderer to provide light, as the room was otherwise only dimly lit by a single candle. Kelly's murder was the most savage, probably because the murderer had more time to commit his atrocities in a private room rather than in the street. Her state of undress and folded clothes have led to suggestions that she undressed herself before lying <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> which would indicate that she was killed by someone she knew, by someone she believed to be a client, or when she was asleep or intoxicated.|$|E
5|$|The White House's {{most famous}} alleged {{apparition}} {{is that of}} Abraham Lincoln. Eleanor Roosevelt never admitted to having seen Lincoln's ghost, but did say that she felt his presence repeatedly throughout the White House. Mrs. Roosevelt {{also said that the}} family dog, Fala, would sometimes bark for no reason at what she felt was Lincoln's ghost. President Dwight Eisenhower's press secretary, James Hagerty, and Liz Carpenter, press secretary to First Lady Lady Bird Johnson, both said they felt Lincoln's presence many times. The former president's footsteps are also said to be heard in the hall outside the Lincoln Bedroom. As reputable an eyewitness as Lillian Rogers Parks admitted in her autobiography My Thirty Years Backstairs at the White House that she had heard them. Margaret Truman, daughter of President Harry S. Truman, said she heard a specter rapping {{at the door of the}} Lincoln Bedroom when she stayed there, and believed it was Lincoln. President Truman himself was once wakened by raps at the door while spending a night in the Lincoln Bedroom. Others have actually seen an apparition of the former president. The first person reported to have actually seen Lincoln's spirit was First Lady Grace Coolidge, who said she saw the ghost of Lincoln standing at a window in the Yellow Oval Room staring out at the Potomac. Winston Churchill, Theodore Roosevelt, and Maureen Reagan and her husband have all claimed to have seen a spectral Lincoln in the White House. A number of staff members of the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration claimed to have seen Lincoln's spirit, and on one occasion Roosevelt's personal valet ran screaming from the White House claiming he had seen Lincoln's ghost. Perhaps the most famous incident was in 1942 when Queen Wilhelmina of The Netherlands heard footsteps outside her White House bedroom and answered a knock on the door, only to see Lincoln in frock coat and top hat standing in front of her (she promptly fainted). Several unnamed eyewitnesses have claimed to have seen the shade of Abraham Lincoln actually lying <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> in the Lincoln Bedroom (which was used as a meeting room at the time of his administration), and others have seen Lincoln sit on the edge of the bed and put his boots on. The most famous eyewitness to the latter was Mary Eben, Eleanor Roosevelt's secretary, who saw Lincoln pulling on his boots (after which she ran screaming from the room).|$|E

25|$|Box enters, {{after a brief}} offstage altercation with Cox on the staircase. After dismissing Bouncer, {{he takes}} out a bread roll, lights the fire, and puts a rasher of bacon on the gridiron. Overcome with exhaustion, he lies <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> for a catnap. Cox re-enters, having {{unexpectedly}} secured a day off from his employer. He is delighted to find a roll on the table, but surprised to find the fire already lit. Assuming that Bouncer has been using the room in his absence, he takes the bacon off the gridiron, replaces it with a mutton chop, and heads off to his dressing room to retrieve his breakfast utensils.|$|E
25|$|Edward hires {{a private}} investigator, Frank Wilson (Dominic Chianese), to follow her. Frank returns with {{pictures}} of Connie and Paul together, which devastates Edward. Connie's visits with Paul become more frequent, {{to the point that}} she is late to pick up Charlie from school. Following this incident, she realizes she can no longer carry on the affair. Unsuccessfully trying to end the affair over the phone, Connie decides {{it would be best to}} do so in person. She spots Paul with another woman walking down the street as she approaches his neighborhood in her SUV. After following and then confronting Paul, their argument ends in a tryst in the stairwell of his apartment building. At the same time, Edward is standing outside Paul's apartment building, where Edward and Connie narrowly miss each other as she leaves out the backdoor. Edward goes to Paul's apartment and confronts him, revealing that he is Connie's husband. Edward asks to come into Paul's apartment, and after Paul lets him in, he gives Edward some vodka and they talk about Connie. Edward asks how Paul and Connie met, and while walking around the apartment, Edward is stunned to see a snow globe by the bed, which he recognizes as a gift he gave to Connie. Paul reveals that Connie gave it to him as a gift. Feeling sick and disoriented, Edward sits <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> and Paul asks if he would like some water. Edward suddenly has a mental breakdown and hits Paul with the snow globe, severely fracturing his skull and killing him instantly.|$|E

When they lie <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> in the dark, Courtney discovers that she is lying on something, when Charlie turns on the light he finds Teddy lying dead on his bed with his pants around his knees, and lipstick on his [...] "Hoo Hoo". When Charlie tells Alan, they know they have an even bigger problem: telling their mother. After pulling Evelyn away from the piano, they tell her and she then cashes in their honeymoon tickets for a trip for one to Fiji before calling the police.|$|E

Then at length he and the notary departed, and, the jailers having cleared away the food and locked the door, Castell and Peter lay <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beds</b> that they had made ready for them, thankful enough to find themselves at Seville, even though in a prison, where indeed they slept very well that night.|$|R
500|$|Ian, Rachel and Geraldine join Rebecca and Carl. Geraldine {{says that}} the room is {{normally}} locked, but Rebecca rebukes her. Stuart rejoins the group after using the toilet. As the group talk, Mark and his wife, Liz, enter the bedroom, unaware of the people hiding in the wardrobe. The pair talk candidly before beginning foreplay and lying <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b> Geraldine shouts to alert them, {{and those in the}} wardrobe pretend they did not hear Mark and Liz's conversation. Mark and Liz reluctantly enter the wardrobe. As the doors close, Rachel's boyfriend Lee enters the room, but as the wardrobe has become more cramped, Stuart and Lee hide under the bed and Ian moves to the en suite bathroom. Stuart and Carl argue, and it is revealed that Carl has a fear of intimacy. When [...] "Stinky" [...] John enters the room, both those in the wardrobe and under the bed claim there is no room, so he hides behind a curtain. Jeremy enters the room and tells Rebecca he is going to pick up another guest from the train station, but as he turns to leave he mistakenly calls her [...] "Rachel". Andrew, Rebecca's father, enters and becomes annoyed when he sees people hiding in different places. He forces Jeremy, Stuart, Lee and Stinky John into the wardrobe with everyone else and follows them in.|$|E
2500|$|Shōichi Nakagawa died on 4 October 2009, aged 56 at {{his home}} in Tokyo. Japanese media reports said his body was found face <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> by his wife, with no {{external}} injuries. She alerted ambulance services at approximately 8:30 am. His death had taken place at least eight hours previously. An investigation was done to determine the cause of death. An autopsy was planned to determine the cause of death. A will has not been located. Taro Aso, the former Japanese Prime Minister, was rendered speechless by the news: [...] "I am so deeply shocked that I have no words." [...] Hirohisa Fujii, his successor as Finance Minister, also commented: [...] "I want to express my heartfelt condolences. He was doing a fine job as a finance minister, so it is regrettable." [...] The Sydney Morning Herald said his death had [...] "sent a shock wave throughout the nation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Abberline {{questioned}} Kelly's boyfriend, Joe Barnett, {{for four}} hours after her murder, and his clothes were examined for bloodstains, but he was then released without charge. A century after the murder, authors Paul Harrison and Bruce Paley proposed he killed Kelly in a jealous rage, or because she scorned him, and suggested that he committed the other murders to scare Kelly {{off the streets and}} out of prostitution. Other authors suggest Barnett killed Kelly only, and mutilated her body {{to make it look like}} a Ripper murder. Abberline's investigation appears to have exonerated him. Other acquaintances of Kelly's put forward as her murderer include her landlord John McCarthy and her former boyfriend Joseph Fleming. (The state of undress of Kelly's body, and some folded clothes on a chair, have led to suggestions that she undressed herself before lying <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> which would indicate that she was killed by someone she knew, or believed to be a client, when she was asleep or insensate from drink.) ...|$|E
