40|$|This {{study was}} done to a product {{development}} unit of a Finnish elevator technology com-pany and it was focused {{on one of the}} components of the whole elevator, the <b>door</b> <b>sill</b> as-sembly. The study had two goals, the main goal was to introduce and to further develop a test system created for testing <b>door</b> <b>sill</b> assemblies, and the secondary goal was to create a technical documentation about the <b>door</b> <b>sill</b> assembly for training purpose. The main issue with the sill assembly {{is that one of the}} main components of the whole as-sembly, the sill profile, does not have duty ranges. The sill profile is the visual part of the whole sill assembly and it guides the movement of elevator doors. Always when something is introduced to the elevator car, it goes over the sill profiles. There are different kinds of sill profiles available for different kind of use, but at the moment the main issue is that it is not known how much wear each profile can take. This often leads to a situation where wrong kinds of sill profiles are delivered with the elevator. A typical example is that too weak sill profiles are delivered with an elevator expecting heavy use, and eventually the sill profiles breaks down. The test system for testing <b>door</b> <b>sill</b> assemblies was already created before this study wa...|$|R

40|$|In the {{research}} project Next Generation Car (NGC) at the German Aerospace Center (DLR), three different novel vehicle concepts are being developed: Urban Modular Vehicle (UMV), Safe Light Regional Vehicle (SLRV) and Interurban Vehicle (IUV). The NGC {{project is the}} consolidation of tools, methods and technologies for the different vehicle concepts investigated by DLR {{in the field of}} transport. The motivation for this work was to find an optimized side crash concept for the Urban Modular Vehicle concept consisting of a <b>door</b> <b>sill</b> and a sandwich element for crash. For the development of the body in white of the NGC Urban Modular Vehicle different structure optimization strategies were used. From the analyses of global load paths, to the size and shape optimization of the floor panels were applied to increase crash performance. The focus of the presentation is on a nonlinear <b>door</b> <b>sill</b> optimization and a parametric sandwich optimization resulting in innovative solutions for car design and the identification of energy absorber mechanisms. The main field of observation by using parametric sandwich elements is to detect thickness and angle of the sandwich core for the required crash performance. For the interpretation of the topology results which defines the location of the structures different optimization tasks were required. The concept for the side impact crash of the Urban Modular Vehicle includes an energy absorbent <b>door</b> <b>sill</b> consisting out of sandwich elements. In the first step, the optimization of the <b>door</b> <b>sill</b> cross-section was done with a nonlinear topology approach. In the second step, a size and shape optimization of the sandwich crash concept were performed to increase the internal energy and to reduce the intrusion of the pole. In the end a final concept was developed according to different optimization results...|$|R
