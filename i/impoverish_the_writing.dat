In this report, India's Ministry of Home Affairs claims it is {{the poor and the}} under-privileged who are worst affected by natural disasters; additionally, these disasters retard socio-economic development, further <b>impoverishing</b> <b>the</b> impoverished. The routine flood relief, drought relief, and other disaster relief efforts lead to diversion of scarce resources from development to rehabilitation and reconstruction.|$|R

30|$|The {{sensible}} is our mediation {{with the}} world, the common structure. For Merleau-Ponty, {{openness to the}} world is the way to ascend to things in itselves, not the renewed traditions, and to operate with the world, not images. Seeking a new source of truth, Merleau-Ponty relates to the whole history of philosophy, but we can see a strong dialogue with Descartes and even Plato. Somehow the Greeks idealized form, creating the concept of ideal as simplification, generalization, reduction, <b>impoverishing</b> <b>the</b> basics, the simple life to the ideal. And this became a deeply rooted tradition, which became european and still is very strong in Brazil.|$|R

In 1492 the victorious Baglioni are the reigning overlords of the Republic. The Oddi family and its attendant army live in exile in the valley between Perugia and Assisi where they conduct a long and oppressive guerrilla war against their rivals; and in the process devastate the Umbrian land and <b>impoverish</b> <b>the</b> common citizen.|$|R

To resolve the problems, this note proposes a change to the “political” rules; i. e., change the Iraqi constitution, and provides an economic strategy to transfer oil wealth to the Iraqi people. ...|$|R

Another consequence of preference falsification is thus widespread ignorance about the advantages of change. Over long periods, preference falsification can dampen a community’s capacity to want change by bringing about intellectual narrowness and ossification.|$|R
