50|$|Overcoming the {{obstacles}} (thanks to Ennis) the McIntyre Mine {{went on to}} set {{a long list of}} firsts in mining and milling practices, as well as in health and safety. It was the first mine in Canada to have a metallurgist on the mill staff and employing a graduate engineer as mine superintendent. It was also the first in Canada to use rubber liners in milling and the first in the Porcupine camp to apply square-set and cut-and-fill stope mining. <b>Gunitting</b> was developed there it adapted and introduced flotation to gold milling. They were the first in Ontario to sink a shaft to below 4,000 feet.|$|E

Often-times {{we find that}} a given code base can talk a mean game, but when time comes to “throw down, ” that code base {{is nowhere to be}} seen. While intuitively we as software developers come to gain a sense of which code bases are trust-worthy (or, “will ball ‘till they fall”), some systematic method for measuring and reporting this is necessary. In this paper we present the <b>GUnit</b> testing harness (pronounced, “Gee Unit”), which does just that...|$|R
40|$|The {{recovery}} of highly radioactive waste from underground storage poses significant problems, which vary from location to location with both material stored and tank configuration. Three possible solutions to this retrieval problem illustrate {{the different approaches}} which must be adopted for the storage tanks at Hanford, Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The first must produce up to 30 gpm of mixed waste. A mining strategy {{to make use of}} a dual head end effector with a jet pump to extract the resulting fluid is described. At Idaho the walls of this tank support a series of cooling coils which limit access. A lighter arm is to be used on this site, with limited strength. Initial experiments to clean around the piping and infrastructure are described. At Oak Ridge the arm has an intermediate capacity. The tool must clean the waste from the gunite walls of the tank without damage, although the jets must have sufficient power to fragment any <b>gunit</b> [...] ...|$|R
