5000|$|Since most {{instructions}} were 16 bits long, {{there was no}} room in an instruction for both a full 15-bit memory address and a meaningful instruction code. Memory was therefore addressed in terms of [...] "pages" [...] of 1,024 words each. Instructions that reference memory had 10 bits for a page offset (supporting values from 0 through 1023 decimal) and a single bit for a [...] "zero/current" [...] page indicator. If the page <b>indicator</b> <b>bit</b> was set the 10 bits were interpreted as an offset within the page that contained the instruction being executed; in other words, the high five bits of the operand address were taken from the P-register, the program counter. If the page <b>indicator</b> <b>bit</b> was clear, the offset represented an address within page zero. Thus 2,048 words could be addressed at once: 1,024 of them within page zero and another 1,024 within the same page as the instruction performing the reference. If necessary to access other memory locations the instruction could have its high bit set, denoting indirect addressing as described previously; the location addressed by the instruction would then contain the full 15-bit operand address (unless it too had its indirect bit set, etc.).|$|E

If conventional power allocation is used with the relay selection, the number of selected relays need to be broadcasted by the destination.

40|$|Abstractâ€”Reminiscent of the parity {{function}} in network coding for the butterfly network, it is shown that forwarding an even/odd <b>indicator</b> <b>bit</b> for a scalar quantization of a relay observation recovers 1 {{bit of information}} at the two destinations in a noiseless interference channel where interference is treated as noise. Based on this observation, a coding strategy is proposed to improve the rate of both users {{at the same time}} using a relay node in a noisy interference channel. In this strategy, the relay observes a linear combination of signals sent by the two sources, and broadcasts a common message to the two destinations over a shared out-of-band link of constant rate R 0 bits per channel use. The relay message consists of the bin index of a structured binning scheme obtained from a 2 R 0 -way partition of the squared lattice in the complex plane. We show that such scalar quantization-binning relay strategy asymptotically achieves the cut-set bound in an interference channel with a common out-of-band relay link of limited rate, improving the sum rate by two bits for every bit relayed, asymptotically at high signal to noise ratios (SNR) and when interference is treated as noise. We then use low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes along with bit-interleaved coded-modulation (BICM) as a practical coding scheme for the proposed strategy. We consider matched and mismatched scenarios, depending on whether the input alphabet of the interference signal is known or unknown to the decoder, respectively. For the matched scenario, we show the proposed strategy results in significant gains in SNR. For the mismatched scenario, we show that the proposed strategy results in rate improvements that, without the relay, cannot be achieved by merely increasing transmit powers. Finally, we use generalized mutual information analysis to characterize the theoretical performance of the mismatched scenario and validate our simulation results. I...|$|E

Digital images are increasingly conveyed over vulnerable channels such as the Internet. Protecting digital product is going to become important issue to ensure the secure transmission of the digital items.

Also, The Block Truncation Coding (BTC) is one of the effective and real time application for data hiding. Most present BTC based watermarking methods cannot completely exploit visual perception of the cover images and do not obtain high data embedding rate. For more exploiting visual perception and high data embedding, an enhanced data hiding scheme based on BTC is proposed. In proposed method, considering the texture sub blocks and Least Significant Bits (LSBs of higher mean value and lower mean value) substitution combine together for designing improved the BTC watermarking scheme. It can obtain good balance between high embedding rate (capacity) and high quality. So, the texture sensitivity is exploited to recognize whether the image blocks or are smooth or complex.

This allows for end-to-end notification of network congestion without dropping packets. ECN bit notifies TCP sources of incipient congestion before losses occur. ECN is a binary <b>indicator</b> (1 <b>bit)</b> which does not reflect the congestion level completely and so its convergence speed is relatively low.

In comparison to single bit ECN, the additional information afforded by double bit ECN allows for more flexibility to adjust window size, to handle congestion.

This work studies one of the operational modes described in this amendment: Time-Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH). This protocol is more robust due to the use of channel hopping. When channel hopping is used, every time communication fails, the nodes switch to another channel for retransmission. This way the resilience to interference increases. To be able to analyze this protocol, some environments are characterized. These serve the purpose of evaluating the operation of TSCH in real circumstances. To characterize these environments the signal strength (RSSI), 802. 15. 4 link quality <b>indicator</b> (LQI), <b>bit</b> error rate (BER) and packet loss (PL) are measured. A first conclusion derived from the results is the asymmetry in interference between nodes. The nodes do not see an equal amount of interference on the same channel.

This would improve decision making procedures for when to pull the bit when experiencing a poor penetrationrate in soft formations or problems getting through harder formations. Using several recorded runs, factors that might be good indicators of the drill bit state of wear was investigated by comparing several bit runs that were using a PDC bit with an Auto Trak X-Treme motor and a CoPilot sub assembly. Some of the possible suggestions did not seem viable to determine the wear of the bit. Some looked viable in some cases, but then again had exceptions in other runs under other conditions. At the end only two of the indications seemed usable to determine the wear of the bit. ROP compared to WOB was in almost every run a good indicator. But the most reliable <b>indicator</b> of <b>bit</b> wear in the runs investigated, was the degree of reduction of torque relative to the applied WOB. When recording these parameters with a new bit in early sections, using this as a basis for comparison with later measurements, it was possible to see if the torque generated had declined once a similar formation appeared again. A third possibility that was not fully investigated was recording increase in mud pressure due to blocked nozzles.

There are many algorithms and techniques of concealing data. Each of which has its own way of hiding and its own advantages and limitations. In our research we introduce a new algorithm of hiding data. The algorithm uses the same technique used by the Least Significant Bit (LSB) algorithm which is embedding secret data in the least significant bit(s) of the bytes of the carrier. It differs from the LSB algorithm in that it does not embed the bytes of the cover data sequentially but it embeds into one bit or two bits at once. Actually it depends on indicators to determine where and how many bits to embed at a time. These <b>indicators</b> are two <b>bits</b> of each cover byte after the least two significant bits. The advantage of this algorithm over the LSB algorithm is the randomness used to confuse intruders as it does not use fixed sequential bytes and it does not always embed one bit at a time.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. May 2015. Major: Electrical Engineering. Advisor: Nicholaos Sidiropoulos. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); x, 87 pages. Transmit beamforming is a characteristic {{feature of the}} modern wireless communication standards like 4 G-LTE and 802. 11 ac because of the increasing demand for higher data rates and better Quality of Service at the user-end. Transmit beamforming uses multiple transmit antennas and channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter (Tx) to steer the radiated power towards the intended receiver (Rx) while limiting the leakage caused in other directions. In the absence of channel reciprocity, this channel information is acquired at the transmitter by channel estimation at the intended Rx and subsequent feedback of the quantized channel information back to the Tx. This conventional training method requires a complex Rx design and high communication overhead, which could be a burden when the receivers operate on battery power and have limited computational resources and restricted communication capabilities. Obtaining CSI for limiting interference caused due to leakage, can be much more challenging especially when the Rx affected by the spatial leakage interference (side lobes) is not cooperating with the Tx (as in secondary transmit beamforming in underlay cognitive radio networks, for achieving a high Quality of Service at the secondary Rx while limiting the interference to the primary Rx). This thesis proposes various algorithms that enable the Tx, which has no initial CSI, learn to beamform on-the-fly and asymptotically attain the performance achievable using perfect CSI at the Tx, using 1 -bit direct or implicit periodic feedbacks from the receivers of interest. The receivers are assumed to have limited computational capability. This thesis starts by considering long-term transmit beamforming for point-to-point Multiple-Input Single-Output (MISO) links and proposes an online beamforming and learning algorithm using the analytic center cutting plane method which is shown to asymptotically attain optimal performance. A robust maximum-likelihood formulation is next developed to combat feedback errors and correlation drift. The setup is then extended to an underlay cognitive radio network for designing secondary transmit beamforming vectors that maximize the average Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) at the secondary Rx while limiting the interference to the primary Rx, using direct binary channel quality <b>indicator</b> feedback <b>bits</b> from the secondary Rx and indirect ACK-NACK feedback from the primary Rx. When the primary interference threshold is known at the secondary Tx, it is analytically shown that the proposed algorithm converges to maximum average SNR at the secondary Rx achieved using perfect CSI at the Tx. Subsequently, the thesis considers max-min fair transmit beamforming for single group multicast networks (which is NP-hard in general) and introduces {{a new class of}} adaptive beamforming algorithms that features guaranteed convergence and state-of-the-art performance at low complexity, when perfect CSI is available at the Tx. Convergence to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point of a related proportionally fair beamforming is established. Simulations show that the proposed approach outperforms the prior state-of-art in terms of multicast rate, at considerably lower complexity. When there is no initial CSIT, an extension of the online algorithm developed for point to point MISO links is proposed for designing the beamforming vector to maximize the minimum SNR among the users, using only periodic binary SNR feedback from each Rx. The design methodology for the multicast beamforming problem is finally extended in a novel fashion to obtain feasible solutions for non-convex Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Programs (QCQP) with two-sided constraints when the associated matrices are positive semi-definite. In this context, the proposed algorithm starts with a infeasible solution which is iteratively updated using a gradient of the log-barrier function of the non-convex constraints followed by projection onto the intersection of the set of convex constraints and a refining step using successive linear approximation. Convergence of the algorithm is established using the Descent lemma and simulations show that the algorithm obtains feasible solutions with a high probability at a much lower complexity compared to the state-of-the-art...|$|R
