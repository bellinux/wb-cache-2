The first blocks were made of rubber, later changed to rigid plastic.It was sold in different box sets, and had different accessories as for example: windows and doors, wheels, and electric motors.|$|E
40|$|As {{an example}} for an {{environmentally}} benign and low-cost material we prepared blends from 1. copolyester-urethanes (PEU) and 2. cellulose acetate recycling material (CAR). The copolyester-urethanes were prepared by <b>joining</b> <b>blocks</b> of alpha, omega-(poly-(R) - 3 -hydroxybutyrate) -diol and poly-butylenglycol-adipate-diol with hexamethylene diisocyanate. Fibrous CAR {{was transformed into a}} short-fiber felt by textile technology and calendared into the PEU melt. The processing of the blends was done at 80 - 100 °C mainly by injection molding. The mechanical properties of the tough-elastic materials were studied with respect to the influence of the PEU composition and the ratio of CAR admixture. The starting materials, (R) -PHB and cellulose derivatives are obtained from agrarian resources. Therefore, the resulting polymers are stable under conditions of usage, yet readily bio-degradable on soil deposition. Mixing with cellulose acetate waste material allows for cost-effective production of such blends...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – The {{effect of}} {{piece-wise}} welding on thermal and mechanical response of thick plate weldments is studied {{by the use}} of a 3 -D thermo-viscoplastic model. Anand’s viscoplastic model is used to simulate the rate dependent plastic deformation of welded materials. Modeling of the welded region in the present study has been done {{by the use of}} the “isothermal melting pool ” approach. The temperature dependency of thermal and mechanical properties of material is considered in analysis and the effect of welder characteristics such as welding speed and welding lag between sequences are introduced into the model. In addition, the Element Rebirth Technique (ERT) is incorporated into the model to introduce the effect of welds of materials added to the weldments during the welding. The model was compared with the results of two analytical and experimental works. The results of the present model are feasible and clearly show the relation between the order of <b>joining</b> <b>blocks</b> and distribution of thermal loads. They also demonstrate the role of this kind of welding sequence on the formation of residual stresses and distortion in thick plate weldments...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Using maximal {{consistent}} {{blocks of}} tolerance relation on {{the universe in}} incomplete decision table, the concepts of <b>join</b> <b>block</b> and meet block are introduced and studied. Including tolerance class, other blocks such as tolerant kernel and compatible kernel of an object are also discussed at the same time. Upper and lower approximations based on those blocks are also defined. Default definite decision rules acquired from incomplete decision table are proposed in the paper. An incremental algorithm to update default definite decision rules is suggested for effective mining tasks from incomplete decision table into which data is appended. Through an example, we demonstrate how default definite decision rules based on maximal consistent <b>blocks,</b> <b>join</b> <b>blocks</b> and meet blocks are acquired and how optimization is done in support of discernibility matrix and discernibility function in the incomplete decision table. Keywords—rough set, incomplete decision table, maximal consistent block, default definite decision rule, <b>join</b> and meet <b>block.</b> I...|$|R

The use of SSA simplifies many compiler optimizations and makes the life of compiler writers easier.

5000|$|... ==Debris avalanche== The {{southern}} {{flank of}} the volcano underwent a collapse, forming a 300 km2 large landslide deposit in the Salar de Coipasa. The deposit has an inverted T shape and an approximate volume of 6 km3, containing various kinds of hummocks. The deposits are little hydrothermally altered but contain prismatically <b>joined</b> <b>blocks,</b> suggesting that the collapse was precipitated by seismic and magmatic activity and not by hydrothermal weakening of the rock. The avalanche deposit contains Toreva blocks and is covered by carbonate deposits, suggesting that it entered the salar {{when it was still}} a lake. Radiocarbon analysis of the avalanche deposits suggest that the edifice collapse occurred between 6000 and 16000 years ago, 12000 being suggested by the height of the carbonate deposits that match the Tauca stage of Coipasa lake evolution.|$|R

3000|$|... 68 Ga-citrate {{is one of}} the {{radiotracers}} for PET imaging of inflammation/infection. Gallium (like iron) {{has high}} affinity to blood transport proteins (e.g. transferrin) due to their similar physical/chemical properties [1]. One of the functions of transport proteins is delivery iron (gallium too) to inflammation/infection foci for inclusion in metabolic pathways related with eradication of pathology [2]. But excessive gallium bindings with proteins are cause of slow blood clearance, long accumulation time in foci (24 - 72 h) and exception of application possibility of the short-lived 68 Ga (T½ = 1, 13 h) unlike 67 Ga (T½ = 78, 26 h). Injection of additional nonradioactive chemical agents (e.g. Fe 3 + containing salts of hydroxy acids: citrate, tartrate, lactate, etc.) competing with gallium to the protein <b>joining</b> (<b>blocking</b> of its metal binding capacity) {{is one of the}} ways to solve formulated problem.
