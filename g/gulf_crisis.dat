5|$|Economic {{conditions}} have fluctuated {{with the changing}} price of oil since 1985, for example during and following the Persian <b>Gulf</b> <b>crisis</b> of 1990–91. With its highly developed communication and transport facilities, Bahrain {{is home to a}} number of multinational firms and construction proceeds on several major industrial projects. A large share of exports consist of petroleum products made from imported crude oil, which accounted for 51% of the country's imports in 2007. Bahrain depends heavily on food imports to feed its growing population; it relies heavily on meat imports from Australia and also imports 75% of its total fruit consumption needs. Since only 2.9% of the country's land is arable, agriculture contributes to 0.5% of Bahrain's GDP. In 2004, Bahrain signed the US-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement, which will reduce certain trade barriers between the two nations. Due to the combination of the global financial crisis and the recent unrest, the growth rate decreased to 2.2% which is the lowest growth rate since 1994.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This article {{attempts}} {{to explain the}} Japanese {{foreign policy in the}} Middle East between 1904 - 1998. This policy is characterized by its steadiness and continuity and is based on resource diplomacy. The article deals with the effects of the oil and <b>Gulf</b> <b>crises</b> on the Japanese Middle East policy. Also, it explains external, social and bureaucratic factors that affect Japan’s decision-makers on foreign policy issues. Japan’s two major foreign policy tools- official development assistance (ODA) and trade – are examined in the context of its Middle East policy. In conclusion, the Japan-Middle East relations have not been changed even if there have been major changes in international system, regional politics and internal affairs of the countries in the last century...|$|R

25|$|After {{collaborating with}} the Arab {{nationalist}} Sudanese government for years, the Ba'ath Party broke off relations and became an opposition party in 1990; this would have disturbed Iraq if Sudan had not supported it during the 1991 <b>Gulf</b> <b>crisis.</b> In 1990, the party was composed largely of students who had studied in Ba'athist Iraq. The party, which was small in 1990, was influential in certain sectors, was opposed to the National Islamic Front and was staunchly secularist. Members have historically been torned between the Ba'ath and other secular party movements, such as the Sudanese communists. Because of Saddam Hussein's amicable relationship with the Revolutionary Command Council for National Salvation, the body ruling Sudan, the Ba'ath branched was oppressed by the authorities. Later in 1990, 26 Ba'athi military officers were executed in Khartoum after a failed military coup. In 2002 a group led by Mohamad Ali Jadein {{broke away from the}} branch and established the independent Sudanese Ba'ath Party, which has no affiliation with neither the pro-Iraq Ba'ath movement nor the pro-Syrian Ba'ath movement. The following year, after the invasion of Iraq, 80 Sudanese Ba'athists return to Sudan under the condition that they would stay out of politics.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to explore {{the ways in which}} Japan can {{contribute}} to UN peace operations. In particular, it looks into the political history of Japan as well as its foreign policies in order to understand how Japan's contributions were implemented and why they are characteristically distinct from other countries. During the 1990 s, Japan encountered heavy criticism for the way it responded to the <b>Gulf</b> War <b>crisis.</b> This prompted many discussions on the willingness and ability of Japan to contribute to the resolution of international crises. The main criticism was its unwillingness to send personnel to locations in need and instead, only offered financial assistance. The reasons for Japan's behaviour were deeply rooted in the interpretation of its constitution which was established right after the end of World War II. Despite the constraints on Japan's initial offer, the way Japan was subsequently able to contribute was highly effective. This started a new way in which to take part in peace related activities that was distinct from the traditional approaches to peace operations. In order to substantiate this argument, this thesis will look at analyses Japan's involvement in the UN missions in Cambodia and East Timor and draws on this analysis of those operations in order to identify future opportunities...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} contagion and crisis propagation (spillovers) in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) economies {{over the period}} 1960 to 2002. It also examines whether contagion occurred in Saudi Arabia (large country) after the 1987 US stock market crash and the 1997 Thai exchange rate devaluation and whether these contagion shocks spillover to smaller countries of the region. Spillovers are likely to occur among interdependent countries within the same geographical region. Tests based on correlation coefficients, ARCH/GARCH estimates and direct change (generalized least squares regression) propagation effects indicate that contagion from the US stock market crash and the Thai devaluation occurred in Saudi Arabia, and these external shocks were propagated to smaller GCC countries. This suggests that GCC countries are likely to mitigate such propagations through economic integration. Thus, the idea of GCC formation may help insulate <b>Gulf</b> economies against <b>crisis</b> propagation. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the integration of young Omanis into the labour market. The aim is identify the factors that hamper their efforts to gain access into the labour market. The year 1970 marked {{the beginning of a new}} era in the history of Oman. This hitherto backward and undeveloped country embarked on an ambitious development programme and within a span of twenty five years achieved rapid economic growth and social change. The pace of economic development has been determined by the revenues generated from oil which are the main source of income for the government. In its transformation the country relied on an expatriate labour force to meet the demand for a competent work force needed to carry out and run various plans and projects. Their size increased from few hundreds in 1970 to constitute two thirds of the country's workforce which was estimated at around 625, 000 in 1995. Until 1970, most young Omanis were seeking employment in the public sector. The fall of oil prices from 1986 onwards and the advent of the <b>Gulf</b> <b>crises</b> in 1990, weakened the economy of Oman and the Government's role as the leading employer of school-leavers was reduced. Accordingly, a growing number of young Omanis began to approach the private sector for employment. The private sector employers were, however, more enthusiastic to recruit expatriate workers than to employ young Omanis. The result was growing unemployment amongst young school-leavers. This situation coincided with the majority of jobs being occupied by non-Omanis. This situation raised question marks about the efficiency of the human resource policies of the country. The changes brought about by this new pattern of employment and the difficulties faced by the young schoolleavers is the central focus of this study. To provide an adequate explanation for the impact of this issue, the study drew on the experiences of several countries and covered different issues under different disciplines, in order to formulate a set of assumptions. These assumptions were developed to reflect the perspectives of the principle groups of stakeholders concerned with labour market issues - young Omanis, private sector employers, and Omani society as a whole. In gathering data and generating knowledge, the study employed a triangulation of methods comprising quantitative and qualitative research methods. The employment of multiple methods was essential, on the grounds that not much research has been carried out in Oman. Respondents, many of them expatriates with little motivation to support the objective of the study, often questioned the intention and motivation of the researcher. Therefore, to obtain an accurate picture from them, it was important to intensify the efforts in the field to ensure the veracity of their responses. Based on these investigations the study has sought to conceptualise a theoretical approach to youth transition from school to the labour market, based on two types of factors: endogenous and exogenous. The study also offered a set of suggestions to policy makers to alleviate the problem of youth unemployment in the country. </p...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the very}} first {{beginnings}} of American popular culture, just about every other race or culture-"other" generally referring to all those outside of the category of White, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant, Americans-has {{at one point or}} another fallen victim to being stereotyped. This study is an attempt to explore some of the easily recognizable and prevalent stereotypes that have been widely circulated by America's popular culture. By doing so, it is hoped that this study will serve to enhance a greater awareness of the existence of stereotypes as well as to reveal some of the possible causes and potentially powerful effects. Most recently, {{over the course of the}} recent Persian <b>Gulf</b> War <b>Crisis,</b> when our nation was forced to focus on the Middle East and the Arabs who inhabit it, it became painfully apparent that there are complex people and unique cultures that actually exist beyond and outside the narrow-minded, one dimensional parameters of the Arab stereotype. Yet, once Kuwait was liberated and American troops started returning home from the gulf, America was left with the indelible impression that all Arabs are nothing more than irrational, violent, uncivilized, and untrustworthy inhabitants of a politically and economically important desert. Theoretically then, a seemingly simple question such as, "What actually 'is' an Arab?" goes insufficiently and unfairly answered since most people know so little about Arabs and what is known is hardly related to reality. The knowledge most readily available is oftentimes limited to generalized, biased, and possibly distorted or inaccurate stereotypes portrayed and perpetuated by pop culture...|$|R

40|$|If {{the public}} sphere {{constitutes}} a prerequisite for democracy, and democracy is regarded as deficient in the EU, it is inevitable for academic discourse {{to deal with the}} phenomenon of a European public sphere. The aim of this Ph. D. thesis is to make an empirical contribution to the quest of such a European public sphere. In the following work, a European public sphere is conceptualised as a (horizontal and vertical) Europeanization of national media. On the theoretical level, three criteria were identified which have to be fulfilled in order to speak of European-transnational communication: First, the national media have to treat the same topics at the same time under the same aspects of relevance (Relevanzgesichtspunkte). Secondly, we must be able to observe an exchange and mutual observation within the EU (horizontally as well as vertically) and thirdly, a European identification must be present in the national discourses. The author furthermore suggests to also analyse transatlantic-transnational communication in order to put the discussion of European communication into perspective. The selected policy field refers to security and defence policy. The analysis focuses in particular on three military <b>crises</b> (<b>Gulf</b> 1991, Kosovo 1999 and Iraq 2003). These crises represent defining moments in the path of a European security and defence policy. Furthermore it is moments of crises that push security debates to the forefront of public attention and therefore produce an aggregation or condensation of communication. Within this debate the analysis concentrates on three European countries, Germany, France and the UK, which all represent very different approaches regarding European policy. The US was added {{in order to have a}} control variable. The sample of analysis contained 2838 articles which where coded by using a mixture of quantitative and qualitative content analysis (in particular a frame analysis). The data analysis is first conducted and discussed for each war individually. In the last chapter of the thesis the results are then summarised to more general hypotheses concerning a European public sphere. It can be stated that the aspects of relevance in this case study do not remain within the national arena but are shared across Europe and also within the transatlantic space. Furthermore, one of the most central thesis is that European communication increases when the national media deal with their European institutions and partners in a critical manner  paradoxically a European public sphere seems to develop much stronger in conflict than in consensus...|$|R
