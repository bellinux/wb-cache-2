5|$|Rushes, tussock sedge, cattails, jewelweed, sphagnum, {{and various}} native true grasses {{are found in}} the bog turtle's habitat, as well as some shrubs and trees such as willows, red maples, and alders. It is {{important}} for their habitat to have an open canopy, because bog turtles spend a considerable amount of time basking in the sunlight. An open canopy allows sufficient sunlight to reach the ground so that the bog turtles can manage their metabolic processes through thermoregulation. The <b>incubation</b> <b>of</b> <b>eggs</b> also requires levels of sunlight and humidity that shaded areas typically lack. The ideal bog turtle habitat is early successional. Late successional habitats contain taller trees that block the necessary sunlight. Erosion and runoff of nutrients into the wetlands accelerate succession. Changes caused by humans have begun to eliminate bog turtles from areas where they would normally survive.|$|E

One {{generation or}} one physical crate {{is used for}} mating and <b>incubation</b> <b>of</b> <b>eggs,</b> which takes from seven to twelve days. One male usually mates {{to three or four}} females. Females are discarded (and fed to zoo animals) immediately after laying the eggs: their life span is too short to give them a second chance. Three other generations, spaced by the same seven to twelve days, are for raising the larvae, which takes 4–5 weeks. Thus the zoos restock their live food supply practically every week.|$|E

25|$|Both sexes {{contribute}} with nest construction, <b>incubation</b> <b>of</b> <b>eggs</b> {{and caring}} for the young. Nests can be built and eggs laid within 3 days (Burgess 1946) and may be built in low shrubs or trees including (e.g. mulga, cork bark (Hakea lorea), sandlewood (genus Santalum)) or on top of thick creepers, about 122cm to 155cm above the ground (Carter 1902b; North 1909). The nest is generally an open, deep, saucer-shaped, well-made structure constructed from twigs or short grass stems (e.g. Spinifex) bound with spider-web, which may be placed on thin twigs {{at the end of}} a branch or at the junction of several thin horizontal leafy stems and suspended by the rim (Carter 1902b).|$|E
500|$|To {{monitor the}} kakapo {{population}} continuously, each bird {{is equipped with}} a radio transmitter. Every known kakapo, barring some young chicks, has been given a name by Kakapo Recovery Programme officials. It is an affectionate way for conservation staff to refer to individual birds, and a stark reminder of how few remain. Artificial <b>incubation</b> <b>of</b> <b>eggs</b> and hand-raising of chicks have often been used to improve the condition of the eggs and chicks. In November 2005, the population comprised 41 females and 45 males, including four fledglings (3 females and 1 male) bred in 2005. The oldest known kakapo, [...] "Richard Henry", was thought to be 80 {{years old at the time}} of his death in December 2010.|$|E
6000|$|The [...] "Utopia" [...] is {{none the}} less {{interesting}} because {{it is one of}} the most inconsistent of books. Never were the forms of Socialism and Communism animated by so entirely an Individualist soul. The hands are the hands of Plato, the wide-thinking Greek, but the voice is the voice of a humane, public-spirited, but limited and very practical English gentleman who takes the inferiority of his inferiors for granted, dislikes friars and tramps and loafers and all undisciplined and unproductive people, and is ruler in his own household. He abounds in sound practical ideas, for the migration of harvesters, for the universality of gardens and the artificial <b>incubation</b> <b>of</b> <b>eggs,</b> and he sweeps aside all Plato's suggestion of the citizen woman as though it had never entered his mind. He had indeed the Whig temperament, and it manifested itself down even to the practice of reading aloud in company, which still prevails among the more representative survivors of the Whig tradition. He argues ably against private property, but no thought of any such radicalism as the admission of those poor peons of his, with head half-shaved and glaring uniform against escape, to participation in ownership appears in his proposals. His communism is all for the convenience of his Syphogrants and Tranibores, those gentlemen of gravity and experience, lest one should swell up above the others. So too is the essential Whiggery of the limitation of the Prince's revenues. It is the very spirit of eighteenth century Constitutionalism. And his Whiggery bears Utilitarianism instead of the vanity of a flower. Among his cities, all of a size, so that [...] "he that knoweth one knoweth all," [...] the Benthamite would have revised his sceptical theology and admitted the possibility of heaven.|$|E
50|$|Eggs {{tend to be}} laid in the {{few hours}} {{preceding}} dusk. <b>Incubation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>egg</b> starts {{as soon as the}} last egg in the clutch is laid and lasts an average of 16.5 days. Japanese quail females carry out most <b>of</b> the <b>incubation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>eggs,</b> becoming increasingly intolerant of the male throughout the incubation process. Eventually, the female will drive the male away before the eggs hatch. Thus, the females also provide all of the parental care to the newly hatched young.|$|R

50|$|Reproduction {{in captivity}} {{has been known}} to occur, with {{clutches}} of 2-5 eggs being observed 25-40 days after copulation. <b>Incubation</b> <b>of</b> <b>eggs</b> with a moist substrate at 86 F has resulted in hatching after 160-175 days.

50|$|Blue-headed vireo’s have an {{atypical}} breeding strategy {{when compared}} to other closely related species. Blue-headed vireo males will assist their mates with daytime <b>incubation</b> <b>of</b> <b>eggs,</b> nest construction, and feeding of the chicks. Also, unlike most bird species, female blue-headed vireos do not attempt any extra-pair copulations with other males. Likewise, males make no attempt to guard females from other males, making blue-headed vireos both socially and genetically monogamous birds.|$|E

5000|$|In species where mate {{guarding}} is {{not needed}} there may still {{be a need for}} the pair to protect each other. An example of this would be sentinel behavior in avian species. The main advantage of sentinel behavior is that many survival tactics are improved. As stated, the male or female will act as a sentinel and signal to their mate if a predator is present. This can lead to an increase in survivorship, foraging, and <b>incubation</b> <b>of</b> <b>eggs.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Brush Bronzewing {{exhibits}} a breeding display {{similar to the}} common bronzewing, including a courtship display of bowing and a vocal advertisement of a low repeated 'hoop' or 'whoo' call. Breeding occurs mainly between September - January, however <b>incubation</b> <b>of</b> <b>eggs</b> and hatchlings has been observed all year round. Young are semi-altricial and nidicolous, requiring warmth, nourishment and {{a high level of}} parental care. The clutch usuallu consists of two eggs, which will be incubated for roughly 17 days and fledge after 16-20 days. Adult pairs will resume breeding 3-4 weeks after fledglings become independent.|$|E

40|$|Eggs from a layer-type {{breeder flock}} (Baladi, King Saud University) between 61 and 63 weeks of age {{were used in}} 3 trials to {{study the effects of}} {{electric}} field (EF) during incubation on the internal temmperature <b>of</b> <b>incubation,</b> and <b>eggs</b> and hemoglobin (Hb) dielectric of chicken embryos at 18 days of age. Dielectric relative permittivity (ε') and conductivity () of Hb were examined in the range of frequency from 20 to 100 kHz. The values of dielectric increment (ε) and the relaxation times () of Hb molecules were calculated. The internal temperature <b>of</b> <b>eggs</b> was measured in empty (following the removal <b>of</b> <b>egg</b> contents) and fertilized eggs in trials 1 and 2, respectively. The level of the EF was 30 kV/m, 60 Hz. EF <b>incubation</b> <b>of</b> embryos influenced the temperature <b>of</b> <b>incubation</b> and electrical properties of Hb molecules and did not influence the temperature <b>of</b> <b>incubation</b> and internal environment <b>of</b> <b>eggs</b> when empty eggs were incubated.

The outer surface of the egg is ornamented with coarse ornamentation, accounting for one fifth the total thickness of the shell.
