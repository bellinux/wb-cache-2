A cutting of armoured plates was more rough than developed during the Winter War; {{the majority of these}} modified tanks did not have a moving armoured gun mask as seen in Factory No. 174's original design, and some tanks had front appliqué armour only.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the harsh}} winters, {{the park has}} few reptile and {{amphibian}} species with only one species of toad, three species of frog, one salamander species and two species of snakes that have been identified. At least 280 species of birds {{can be found in}} Banff including bald and golden eagles, red-tailed hawk, osprey, and merlin, all of which are predatory species. Additionally, commonly seen species such as the gray jay, American three-toed woodpecker, mountain bluebird, Clark's nutcracker, mountain chickadee and pipit are frequently found in the lower elevations.

5|$|London held {{a special}} status within the English economy. The nobility {{purchased}} and consumed many luxury {{goods and services}} in the capital, and {{as early as the}} 1170s the London markets were providing exotic products such as spices, incense, palm oil, gems, silks, furs and foreign weapons. London was also an important hub for industrial activity; it had many blacksmiths making a wide range of goods, including decorative ironwork and early clocks. Pewter-working, using English tin and lead, was also widespread in London during the period. The provincial towns also had a substantial number of trades {{by the end of the}} 13th century – a large town like Coventry, for example, contained over three <b>hundred</b> <b>different</b> specialist occupations, and a smaller town such as Durham could support some sixty different professions. The increasing wealth of the nobility and the church was reflected in the widespread building of cathedrals and other prestigious buildings in the larger towns, in turn making use of lead from English mines for roofing.|$|E
5|$|STRAT-X, or Strategic-Experimental, was a U.S. government-sponsored study {{conducted}} during 1966 and 1967 that comprehensively analyzed the potential {{future of the}} U.S. nuclear deterrent force. At the time, the Soviet Union was making significant strides in nuclear weapons delivery, and also constructing anti-ballistic missile defenses to protect strategic facilities. To address a potential technological {{gap between the two}} superpowers, U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara entrusted the classified STRAT-X study to the Institute for Defense Analyses, which compiled a twenty-volume report in nine months. The report looked into more than one <b>hundred</b> <b>different</b> weapons systems, ultimately resulting in the MGM-134 Midgetman and LGM-118 Peacekeeper intercontinental ballistic missiles, the s, and the Trident submarine-launched ballistic missiles, among others. Journalists have regarded STRAT-X as a major influence on the course of U.S. nuclear policy.|$|E
5|$|There are a {{total of}} 14 species of {{amphibians}} in the Nescopeck Creek watershed, of which 11 breed in the watershed.

25|$|The city's fortifications were strengthened, with Lviv {{becoming}} {{one of the most important}} fortresses guarding the Commonwealth from the south-east.

The most common ALS-causing mutation is a mutant SOD1 gene, seen in North America; this is characterized by an exceptionally rapid progression from onset to death. The most common mutation found in Scandinavian countries, D90A-SOD1, is more slowly progressive than typical ALS, and people with this form of the disorder survive for an average of 11 years.|$|E
25|$|Boron, {{with its}} atomic number of 5, {{is a very}} light element. Almost never found free in nature, it is very low in abundance, {{composing}} only 0.001% (10 ppm) of the Earth's crust. It is known to occur in over a <b>hundred</b> <b>different</b> minerals and ores, however: the main source is borax, {{but it is also}} found in colemanite, boracite, kernite, tusionite, berborite and fluoborite. Major world miners and extractors of boron include the United States, Turkey, Argentina, China, Bolivia and Peru. Turkey {{is by far the most}} prominent of these, accounting for around 70% of all boron extraction in the world. The United States is second, most of its yield coming from the state of California.|$|E
25|$|In 1996, Saccharomyces cerevisiae was {{the first}} single-celled, {{eukaryotic}} organism to have its entire genome sequenced.

Today there are several <b>hundred</b> <b>different</b> strains of S. cerevisiae identified. Not all of the strains are suitable for winemaking and even among the strains that are, there is debate among winemakers and scientists about the actual magnitude of differences between the various strains and their potential impact on the wine. Even among strains that have demonstrated distinctive difference when compared among young wines, these differences seem to fade and become less distinctive as the wines age.|$|E
