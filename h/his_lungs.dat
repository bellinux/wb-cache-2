5|$|Given {{the events}} {{happening}} in Cuba at the time, Betances thought that his diplomatic work {{was more important}} than ever. However, his failing health (he had uremia, and since <b>his</b> <b>lungs</b> could not exchange oxygen properly this put extra burden to his heart and kidneys) prevented Betances from performing further diplomatic work from France on behalf of Puerto Rico or Cuba. His illness, which lasted more than a year, prevented him from performing medical work, and forced the Party to approve a stipend for Betances during his long illness, until his death.|$|E

5|$|Nelson owns Luck, Texas, a {{ranch in}} Spicewood, Texas, and also lives in Maui, Hawaii with several celebrity neighbors.While {{swimming}} in Hawaii in 1981, Nelson's lung collapsed. He {{was taken to}} the Maui Memorial Hospital and his scheduled concerts were canceled. Nelson temporarily stopped smoking cigarettes each time <b>his</b> <b>lungs</b> became congested, and resumed when the congestion ended. He was then smoking between two and three packs per day. After suffering from pneumonia several times, he decided to quit either marijuana or tobacco. He chose to quit tobacco. In 2008 he started to smoke marijuana with a carbon-free system to avoid the effects of smoke. In 2004 Nelson underwent surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome, as he had damaged his wrists by continuously playing the guitar. On the recommendation of his doctor, he canceled his scheduled concerts and only wrote songs during his recovery. In 2012 he canceled a fund-raising appearance in the Denver area. He suffered from breathing problems due to high altitude and emphysema and was taken to a local hospital. His publicist Elaine Schock confirmed soon after that Nelson's health was good and that he was heading to his next scheduled concert in Dallas, Texas. After repeated instances of pneumonia and emphysema through the years, Nelson underwent stem-cell therapy in 2015 to improve the state of <b>his</b> <b>lungs.</b>|$|E

He had suffered severe injuries to his left side, with major damage to his diaphragm, spleen, and one of <b>his</b> <b>lungs.</b> He also had a fractured rib. A doctor, Slanina, packed the chest wound, while another doctor, Walter Diek, tried unsuccessfully to remove the splinters. He immediately decided to operate.

5|$|After {{the team}} finds and stores Pierce's body, Mulder reviews Trepkos' {{fragmented}} notes. He finds references {{to a new}} silicon-based organism existing inside Mount Avalon; Scully, however, doubts his conclusions because of his mental state. Tanaka breaks into convulsions and displays a high fever, but refuses any help from Mulder or Scully. When he is put on a stretcher for a medivac pickup, Mulder notices a throbbing bulge in his neck. Tanaka flees {{into the woods and}} dies when a tentacle bursts out of his throat. An autopsy by Scully finds sand in <b>his</b> <b>lungs,</b> indicating the existence of a silicon-based spore; she theorizes that when exposed, the spore infects the nearest hosts or otherwise dies. Mulder contacts the CDC to have them quarantine the site.|$|E

He was forced to end his run outside Thunder Bay when the cancer spread to <b>his</b> <b>lungs.</b> His hopes of overcoming the disease and completing his marathon ended when he died nine months later.|$|E

5|$|In spring 1917, Rau, by {{this time}} an elected trade union {{official}} in his firm, participated {{in the attempt to}} organise a strike against the war. His action led to a reprimand from his employer, and may have hastened his conscription into the army in August 1917. In the army he was trained in the Zuffenhausen-garrisoned Infantry Regiment 126 and deployed to the Western Front as member of a machine gun company. In September 1918 a shell splinter penetrated <b>his</b> <b>lungs.</b> In the following weeks, he was treated in military hospitals in Weimar and in Stuttgart's neighbouring town Ludwigsburg. While in Ludwigsburg, Rau managed to get leave at short notice on 8November 1918 and joined the in those days developing revolution in Stuttgart.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} case {{of possible}} BHD {{in the medical}} literature was published by Burnier and Rejsek in 1927, who described a case of perifollicular fibromas on a 56-year-old woman's face. Trichodiscomas were first described in 1974 by H.S. Zackheim and H. Pinkus, but were not associated with BHD until Birt, Hogg, and DubÃ©. The first case of BHD with the systemic symptoms was described by Hornstein and Knickenberg and found in two siblings and their father, all of whom exhibited colon polyps and the characteristic fibrofolliculomas. Though the siblings did not have renal or pulmonary symptoms, their father had cysts in <b>his</b> <b>lungs</b> and kidneys. Hornstein-Knickenberg syndrome is a now-deprecated name for the inherited fibrofolliculomas inherent to BirtâHoggâDubÃ©.|$|E
5|$|Leslie takes {{possession}} of the jinniyah and asks for his brother {{to be returned to}} life. Anson is returned, but in a decaying state, complete with injuries from the crash. Leslie's second wish is for Anson to talk, which results in Anson screaming at the top of <b>his</b> <b>lungs</b> and telling his brother that he is cold. Back at the morgue, Scully finds the body has disappeared and Mulder suspects it is because of Leslie's wish. They go to the Stokes residence and Anson blows the house up trying to light the stove in an attempt to warm up. Mulder questions Jenn, the jinniyah, who says she's 500 years old. According to her, she gained her powers after wishing for great power and long life from another genie. She also says that Mulder unrolled her so he now has three wishes of his own. Mulder wishes for peace on earth and she wipes out the entire human population. With his second wish, Mulder undoes his first wish. Mulder then writes down his third wish to be very specific. However, just before making the final wish, Scully helps Mulder realize that the power of a genie should not be used to force people to be good, and so he ultimately wishes for Jenn to be free.|$|E
