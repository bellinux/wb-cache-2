5|$|Marginal {{abatement}} cost curves attempt {{to compare the}} <b>financial</b> <b>costs</b> of different options for reducing pollution in a region and are used in emissions trading, policy discussions and incentive programs. McKinsey & Company released its first marginal {{abatement cost}} (MAC) curve for greenhouse gas emissions in February 2007, which was updated to version two in January 2009. McKinsey & Company's MAC curve {{has become the most}} widely used and is the basis for McKinsey’s consulting on climate change and sustainability.|$|E
5|$|The company {{collected}} NOK73.5 {{million in}} tolls, {{in addition to}} accumulating NOK16.3 million in interest. Costs, mostly for running of the toll plaza, were NOK7.6 million, in addition to <b>financial</b> <b>costs</b> of NOK20.0 million. This gave a profit of NOK62.4 million, including the necessary repayments of the initial loan. Because the debt had been financed with bonds, the company chose to place revenue in the bank with a higher interest instead of paying off the bonds faster. The preferred shares were repaid in 1980, while all bonds had been repaid by 1985. A/S Sotrabrua was formally liquidated on 9 February 1989.|$|E
5|$|The various health {{problems}} associated with long-term alcohol consumption are generally perceived as detrimental to society, for example, money due to lost labor-hours, medical costs due to injuries due to drunkenness and organ damage from long-term use, and secondary treatment costs, such as the costs of rehabilitation facilities and detoxification centers. Alcohol use is a major contributing factor for head injuries, motor vehicle accidents (due to drunk driving), domestic violence, and assaults. Beyond the <b>financial</b> <b>costs</b> that alcohol consumption imposes, there are also significant social costs to both the alcoholic and their family and friends. For instance, alcohol consumption by a pregnant woman can lead to fetal alcohol syndrome, an incurable and damaging condition. Estimates of the economic costs of alcohol abuse, collected by the World Health Organization, vary from one to six percent of a country's GDP. One Australian estimate pegged alcohol's social costs at 24% of all drug abuse costs; a similar Canadian study concluded alcohol's share was 41%. One study quantified {{the cost to the}} UK of all forms of alcohol misuse in 2001 as £18.5–20 billion. All economic costs in the United States in 2006 have been estimated at $223.5 billion.|$|E
40|$|Background/Aim Hamstring strain {{injuries}} (HSIs) {{have remained}} {{the most prevalent}} injury in the Australian football league (AFL) over the past 21 regular seasons. The impact of HSIs in sport is often expressed as regular season games missed due to injury. However the <b>financial</b> <b>cost</b> of athletes missing games due to injury has not been investigated. The aim of this report is to estimate the <b>financial</b> <b>cost</b> of games missed due to HSIs in the AFL. Method Data was collected using publically available information from the AFL’s injury report and the official AFL annual report for the past 10 competitive AFL seasons. Average athlete salary and injury epidemiology data {{was used to determine}} the average yearly <b>financial</b> <b>cost</b> of HSIs for AFL clubs and the average <b>financial</b> <b>cost</b> of a single HSI over this time period. Results Across the observed period, average yearly <b>financial</b> <b>cost</b> of HSIs per club increased by 71...|$|R
