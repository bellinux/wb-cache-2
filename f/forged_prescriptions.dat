25|$|Benzodiazepines are a {{commonly}} misused class of drug. A study in Sweden found that benzodiazepines {{are the most}} common drug class of <b>forged</b> <b>prescriptions</b> in Sweden. Concentrations of benzodiazepines detected in impaired motor vehicle drivers often exceeding therapeutic doses have been reported in Sweden and in Northern Ireland. One of the hallmarks of problematic benzodiazepine drug misuse is escalation of dose. Most licit prescribed users of benzodiazepines do not escalate their dose of benzodiazepines.|$|E
500|$|In {{the next}} episode, [...] "Que Será Será", Tritter {{searches}} House's apartment {{and finds a}} large quantity of Vicodin pills and two apparently <b>forged</b> <b>prescriptions</b> that bear the name of House's friend James Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard). During [...] "Son of Coma Guy" [...] and [...] "Whac-A-Mole", Tritter pressures Wilson and members of House's diagnostic team to testify against him, but they all refuse. In [...] "Finding Judas", Cuddy finds Tritter spending his day off looking through the hospital's log for evidence against House. She accuses him of not having a life and [...] "personalizing every slight". Tritter responds that [...] "nobody [...] is innocent", as everyone allows House to treat patients despite knowing of his Vicodin addiction and {{that it takes a}} police detective to uncover what the doctors are deliberately hiding. At the end of the episode, Wilson visits Tritter and indicates his willingness to testify.|$|E

50|$|He and {{his family}} are notable for being {{involved}} in a high-profile legal dispute around 1993, when his paternal grandfather (the 11th Duke of Marlborough) sought to disinherit Lord Blandford's father.

50|$|Jansen Steur sufferent {{a serious}} car {{accident}} in Germany in 1990, {{resulting in a}} complex hip fracture. In 2000 he became addicted to Midazolam, a sedative. In order to obtain this drug he started <b>forging</b> <b>prescriptions</b> using his colleagues' names as prescribing physicians. As it turned out later, {{in the four years}} following his becoming addicted, he regularly misdiagnosed patients. In order to support his misdiagnoses, he forged diagnostic questionnaires from patients, swapped patient x-rays and forged laboratory results. He prescribed strong medications unnecessarily for a number of his patients and in a number of cases had patients undergo brain surgery without necessity.|$|R
50|$|Dr. Andrew Bowers, who {{had treated}} Anne, {{refused to sign}} her death {{certificate}} without a post-mortem. Bouwer objected to a post-mortem but was overruled.

The Vicar was puzzled by Bouwer's behaviour and stated that the house seemed to have been disinfected. Significant levels of sedatives and insulin were found in her blood, and a further investigation showed they had been obtained via 11 <b>forged</b> <b>prescriptions.</b> Bouwer claimed he was suffering from cancer and depression and had obtained the drugs to commit suicide.|$|E
50|$|Research {{carried out}} by the Australian {{government}} found that benzodiazepine users {{are more likely to be}} violent, more likely to have been in contact with the police, and more likely to have been charged with criminal behavior than those using opiates. Illicit benzodiazepines mostly originate from medical practitioners but leak onto the illicit scene due to diversion and doctor shopping. Although only a very small number originate from thefts, <b>forged</b> <b>prescriptions,</b> armed robberies, or ram raids, it is most often benzodiazepines, rather than opiates, that are targeted in part because benzodiazepines are not usually locked in vaults and or do not have as strict laws governing prescription and storage of many benzodiazepines. Temazepam accounts for most benzodiazepine sought by forgery of prescriptions and through pharmacy burglary in Australia.|$|E

50|$|Living in {{a wealthy}} section of Palm Beach, Billy Burroughs began {{to spend more}} time out of his grandparents' care and beyond the reach of local authorities.

He was soon arrested, but he was not an adult, and had the tragic story of his parents' life to temper criminal proceedings against him. Nevertheless, his second novel begins with his condemnation to a four-year suspended sentence and required admission to the Federal Narcotics Farm at Lexington in Kentucky. This prison was one of two U.S. Federal prison hospitals treating persons convicted of federal drug crimes in the United States from 1935 until 1973.|$|R
