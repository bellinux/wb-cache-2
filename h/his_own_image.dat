5|$|Invader works incognito, often masked {{and largely}} at night. To guard his {{anonymity}} on camera during interviews, he pixellates <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>image</b> or wears a mask as a disguise.

5|$|Limited-time events {{sometimes}} introduced {{additional material}} into the story. For instance, during the game's first anniversary event (July 2014), the player meets and befriends Goofy and Donald Duck, whose Gummi Ship has crash landed in Daybreak Town and broken into many Gummi Blocks. The player agrees to help collect the Gummi Blocks {{to repair the}} ship, and meets King Mickey, Chip, and Dale while doing so. Once the Gummi Ship is repaired, the player watches the others depart for their world. Meanwhile, a Moogle has constructed a Gummi Ship in <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>image,</b> but is unable to locate an entrance into his design.|$|E
5000|$|English has {{appropriated}} many {{well known}} images and characters from pop culture, reworking them into <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>images.</b> These include a reworking of Charlie Brown into his [...] "Grin" [...] character {{and one of}} his famous [...] "MC Supersized" [...] {{based on the idea that}} Ronald McDonald ate <b>his</b> <b>own</b> product. Another <b>image</b> of the idealized American female is that of Marilyn Monroe with Mickey Mouse breasts.|$|R
50|$|In 1905 Demachy {{was elected}} to the Royal Photographic Society. At the {{invitation}} of the Society, he and Puyo selected the French entries for the London Photographic Salon that year, and he included more than twenty of <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>images</b> in the show.|$|R
50|$|He doesn't like {{to paint}} using {{references}} and prefers to develop <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>images</b> using {{a very bright}} palette. He uses complementary colors heavily and adopts moods such as cool or warm as a guiding principle. Early on he favored deep violet over black.|$|R
5|$|Smoke Imix {{demolished}} the Papagayo {{phase and}} ritually interred the broken remains of its sculpted monuments, accompanied by stone macaw heads {{from an early}} version of the ballcourt. He then built a pyramid over the earlier phases, nicknamed Mascarón by archaeologists. It in turn was developed into the Chorcha pyramid {{with the addition of a}} long superstructure with seven doorways at the front and back. Before a new building was built over the top, the upper sanctuary was demolished and a tomb was inserted into the floor and covered with 11 large stone slabs. The tomb contained the remains of an adult male and a sacrificed child. The adult's badly decayed skeleton was wrapped in a mat and accompanied by offerings of fine jade, including ear ornaments and a necklace of sculpted figurines. The burial was accompanied by offerings of 44 ceramic vessels, jaguar pelts, spondylus shells, 10 paintpots and one or more hieroglyphic books, now decayed. There were also 12 ceramic incense burners with lids modeled into human figurines, thought to represent Smoke Imix and his 11 dynastic predecessors. The Chorcha building was dedicated to the long-lived 7th-century king Smoke Imix and it is therefore likely that the remains interred in the building are his. Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil had sealed the Chorcha phase under a new version of the temple, nicknamed Esmeralda, by AD710. The new phase bore the first version of the Hieroglyphic Stairway, which contains a lengthy dynastic history. K'ak' Yipyaj Chan K'awiil built over the Esmeralda phase in the mid-8thcentury. He removed the Hieroglyphic Stairway from the earlier building and reinstalled it into his own version, while doubling the length of its text and adding five life-size statues of rulers dressed in the garb of Teotihuacano warriors, each seated on a step of the stairway. At the base of the stairway, he also raised StelaM, with <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>image.</b> The summit shrine of the temple bore a hieroglyphic text composed of full-figure hieroglyphs, each placed beside a similar glyph in faux-Mexican style, giving the appearance of a bilingual text.|$|E

60|$|Hutter {{opened his}} glassy eyes, and stared wildly at the speaker. A flood of {{confused}} recollections rushed on his wavering {{mind at the}} sight of his late comrade. It was evident that he struggled with <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>images,</b> and knew not the real from the unreal.|$|R
50|$|In 1864 Levitsky in turn {{sold out}} to Augustin Aimé Joseph Le Jeune whose cards carried the Levitsky {{name and the}} {{information}} {{that he was the}} new owner/successor i.e. 'Lejeune succr' until at least 1867 and Lejeune reused negatives made by Levitsky as well as making <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>images.</b>|$|R

50|$|Valeria Maximilla's {{portrait}} {{does not}} appear {{on any of the}} coinage issued under Maxentius, but she may have been depicted on a defaced sculpture now housed in the Capitoline Museums. If it is of Maximilla, it was likely defaced after her husband's overthrow, when <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>images</b> were also defaced.|$|R
5000|$|His 2012 show Objects in Pieces at the Newman Popiashvili {{gallery in}} New York {{included}} oil paintings derived from collages made from cutting up and combining <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>images</b> with those by Jackson Pollock, Paul Cézanne and Dong Qichang.

25|$|Byrd {{was one of}} {{only four}} American {{military}} officers in history entitled to wear a medal with their own image on it. The others were Admiral George Dewey, General John J.

25|$|To improve <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>image,</b> Chalmers {{requests}} SFPD Lieutenant Frank Bullitt, who is well-liked by {{the local}} media. Bullitt and his team, Delgetti and Stanton, put Ross under around-the-clock protection in a cheap hotel selected by Chalmers. At 1:00a.m., while Bullitt is with his girlfriend Cathy, Stanton is on solo duty when the desk clerk unexpectedly calls to announce that Chalmers wants to come up. While Stanton checks by phone with Bullitt, Ross unchains the hotel room door. A pair of hitmen burst in and shoot Stanton and Ross, seriously wounding both.|$|E
5000|$|Brett Weston used {{to refer}} to Edward Weston lovingly as [...] "my biggest fan" [...] and there was no rivalry between the two {{photographic}} giants. Brett and his wife Dody loyally set aside their own photography to help Edward after he was unable to print <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>images</b> due to Parkinson's disease, which claimed Edward's life in 1958.|$|R
5000|$|Kuert views {{himself as}} an artist of the [...] "sublime". In his poetry he always plays with {{concepts}} and their opposites: the carnality of his figures and their symbolic developments, the digital medium and the picturesque image, the destruction of <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>images</b> to seek a new meaning yet again, and the representation of pain to evoke hope.|$|R

25|$|Stories Toto Told Me (1898), a {{collection}} of six stories, later expanded to thirty-two and republished as In <b>His</b> <b>Own</b> <b>Image</b> (1901), in which ‘Don Friderico’ and his teenage acolytes embark on long walking tours in the Italian countryside, even as far from Rome as the eastern coast of Italy. The youths’ leader, the sixteen-year-old Toto, recounts tales of saints behaving like pagan gods. The stories are richly Catholic and unashamedly superstitious, and the saints who figure in them are hedonistic, revengeful and (though not licentious) entirely comfortable with nudity, diametric to any Protestant ideal of sainthood.|$|E
25|$|Eastern Orthodox {{find the}} first {{instance}} of an image or icon in the Bible when God made man in <b>His</b> <b>own</b> <b>image</b> (Septuagint Greek eikona), in Genesis 1:26-27. In Exodus, God commanded that the Israelites not make any graven image; but soon afterwards, he commanded that they make graven images of cherubim and other like things, both as statues and woven on tapestries. Later, Solomon included still more such imagery when he built the first temple. Eastern Orthodox believe these qualify as icons, in that they were visible images depicting heavenly beings and, {{in the case of}} the cherubim, used to indirectly indicate God's presence above the Ark.|$|E
25|$|In {{traditional}} Islamic societies, {{love between}} men and women was widely celebrated, and both the popular and classical literature of the Muslim world is replete with works on this theme. Throughout Islamic history, intellectuals, theologians and mystics have extensively discussed the nature and characteristics of romantic love (ishq). In its most common intellectual interpretation of the Islamic Golden Age, ishq refers to an irresistible desire to obtain possession of the beloved, expressing a deficiency that the lover must remedy in order to reach perfection. Like the perfections of the soul and the body, love thus admits of hierarchical degrees, but its underlying reality is the aspiration to the beauty which God manifested in the world when he created Adam in <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>image.</b>|$|E
50|$|Sommer was {{involved}} {{in every aspect of}} the photography business. He published <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>images</b> that he sold in his studios and to customers across Europe. In later years, he photographed custom images for book illustrations, as well as printing <b>his</b> <b>own</b> albums and postcards. Sommer worked in all the popular formats of his day: carte de visite, stereoview, and large albumen prints (approximately 8x10) which were sold individually and in bound albums.|$|R

25|$|In 1982, Beuys {{recorded}} a music video {{for a song}} he had written entitled “Sonne statt Reagan” which translates to “Sun, not Rain/Reagan” This was an anti-Reagan political piece that included some clever puns in German and continued to reinforce {{some of the key}} messages of Beuys' career—namely an extremely liberal, pacifist political attitude; a desire to perpetuate open discourse on art and politics; a refusal to sanctify <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>image</b> and ‘artistic reputation’ by only doing the kinds of work other people expected he would do; and above all an openness to exploring different media forms to get across the messages he wanted to convey. His continued commitment to the demystification and dis-institutionalization of the ‘art world’ was never more clear than it is here.|$|E
25|$|Rolfe took an {{interest}} in photography throughout his life, but never achieved any more than basic competence. While he began to experiment with photography when he was a schoolmaster, it was his time in Rome in 1889–90 that introduced him to the work of the 'Arcadian' photographers Wilhelm von Gloeden and Guglielmo Plüschow. His seminary, the Scots College, was quite close to Plüschow's studio in via Sardegna, just off the via Veneto, and when Rolfe was expelled from the College and came under the benevolent patronage of the Duchess Sforza Cesarini, he began his own photographic efforts in imitation of von Gloeden and Plüschow. His models were the local ragazzi from the streets of Genzano di Roma, a town dominated by the Duchess's palazzo. These youths were later to become the principal characters in Rolfe's Toto stories, published first in The Yellow Book in 1895–96 and later collected in Stories Toto Told Me in 1898 and In <b>His</b> <b>Own</b> <b>Image</b> in 1901.|$|E
25|$|Following Duffey's murder, Nilsen {{began to}} kill with {{increasing}} frequency. Before {{the end of}} 1980, he was to kill a further five victims and attempt to murder one other, although {{only one of these}} victims whom Nilsen murdered, 26-year-old William David Sutherland, has ever been identified. Nilsen's recollections of the unidentified victims are vague, although he graphically recalled how each victim had been murdered and just how long the body had been retained before dissection. One unidentified victim killed in November had moved his legs in a cycling motion as he was strangled (Nilsen is known to have absented himself from work between 11 and 18 November, likely due to this particular murder); another unidentified victim Nilsen had unsuccessfully attempted to resuscitate, before sinking to his knees and sobbing, before standing to expressly spit at <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>image</b> as he looked at himself in the mirror. On another occasion, he had lain in bed alongside the body of an unidentified victim as he listened to the classical theme Fanfare for the Common Man before bursting into tears.|$|E
