5|$|Church {{belief in}} {{the resurrection of the}} body led to a {{prohibition}} against cremation that was pastorally modified at the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s under limited circumstances, but those conditions have been largely ignored even by the clergy.

Organ donation after death and organ transplants under certain terms, also autopsies for legal and scientific reasons are permitted.|$|E

5|$|The Book of the Dead first {{developed}} in Thebes toward {{the beginning of}} the Second Intermediate Period, around 1700 BCE. The earliest known occurrence of the spells included in the Book of the <b>Dead</b> <b>is</b> from the coffin of Queen Mentuhotep, of the 13th dynasty, where the new spells were included amongst older texts known from the Pyramid Texts and Coffin Texts. Some of the spells introduced at this time claim an older provenance; for instance the rubric to spell 30B states that it was discovered by the Prince Hordjedef in the reign of King Menkaure, many hundreds of years before it is attested in the archaeological record.|$|E

5|$|Left 4 <b>Dead</b> <b>is</b> a first-person shooter {{survival}} horror {{video game}} released in November 2008 for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360. Turtle Rock led the game's development, with assistance provided by publisher Valve. It puts emphasis on co-operative gameplay, in which players must fight against zombies {{in order to}} complete levels. In addition, the game features an asymmetrical multiplayer mode called Versus mode, in which players fight against a zombie which is controlled by another player. The game was built atop the most advanced version of the Source Engine {{available at the time}} and introduced version 2 of Turtle Rock's AI technology, which had since been updated from the AI used for the bots in Condition Zero. The game was released on Microsoft Windows and the Xbox 360 in November 2008. The game received critical acclaim. The PC version of the game received an 89 out of 100 from Metacritic, a review aggregator. The title was thought to have redefined co-operative gameplay. The success of Left 4 Dead led Valve to develop Left 4 Dead 2, the next installment in the series. Alongside its sequel, the franchise had collectively sold 12 million copies as of October 1, 2012.|$|E
5|$|To {{reach the}} cathedral, Garrett ventures through Old Quarter, a haunted, {{abandoned}} district of the City. Through {{an opening in}} the cathedral, The Eye informs Garrett of a nearby Keeper sanctuary, where he may learn how to unseal the cathedral. There, Garrett discovers that the cathedral was sealed to prevent the City's destruction by the Trickster. He learns that there are four talismans needed to remove the seal: two hidden in ancient ruins beneath the City, and two inside a Hammerite temple (in Thief Gold, one talisman is in possession of the mages and another was found at an opera house after it was taken from the caves below, while the other two are in the Lost City and the Hammerite Temple as in the original game). Garrett recovers the talismans and returns to the cathedral. After unsealing the cathedral, he learns that its inhabitants had been killed and made undead by The Eye. He returns The Eye to Constantine, who reveals himself to be the Trickster. Viktoria says that The Eye requires a flesh eye to function; she binds Garrett with vines and removes his right eye. The Trickster places it on the gemstone, and the two disappear through a portal. Garrett, left for <b>dead,</b> <b>is</b> found and freed by two Keepers. During his escape from the Trickster's mansion, he learns that the Trickster plans to use The Eye to revert the world to a wild state.|$|E
