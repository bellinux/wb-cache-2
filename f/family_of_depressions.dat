40|$|Depression is {{associated}} with increased morbidity and mortality and is highly prevalent, particularly in women. Studies indicate increased risk for onset of new and recurrent episodes <b>of</b> major <b>depression</b> in women during midlife. To improve understanding of the etiology <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> in midlife women and to inform prevention and treatment efforts, the risk and protective factors that influence the occurrence and course <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> in midlife women should be determined. In particular, the role <b>of</b> <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> in the development <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> among midlife women is unknown. This dissertation explores associations between family history and major depression in midlife women {{in the context of}} other risk and protective factors. First, the relationship between family history and major depression was examined in 303 midlife women. Results showed that <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> is a significant predictor <b>of</b> midlife major <b>depression,</b> particularly in women with a history <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> prior to midlife. 	 Second, data from the same cohort of midlife women showed that <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> {{is associated}} with midlife major depression, after controlling for the menopausal transition and relevant time-varying covariates. Furthermore, menopausal status {{is associated with}} major depression among midlife women without a <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> <b>depression,</b> but not among those with a family history. Third, potential mediators of the relationship between family history and the onset <b>of</b> major <b>depression</b> during midlife were explored in 103 midlife women with a lifetime history <b>of</b> <b>depression.</b> Mediation analyses provided evidence that childhood abuse, trait anxiety, and life events mediate the effect <b>of</b> <b>family</b> history on the onset <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> during midlife. In conclusion, <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> continues {{to play an important role}} in the development <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> in women during midlife, particularly for women with a prior history <b>of</b> <b>depression.</b> The public health relevance of our findings is that clinicians may be able to improve the emotional health of midlife women by assessing family and lifetime history <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> to identify those at risk and by closely monitoring mood among women found to have such histories, thus allowing for implementation of appropriate interventions in a timely manner. ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Individuals with a <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> show subtle {{abnormalities}} in {{the processing}} of social stimuli. This could negatively affect their interpersonal functioning and contribute to their depression risk. Repeated administration of the serotonin precursor tryptophan has previously been shown to increase agreeable behavior and reduce quarrelsome behavior in irritable people, who are also considered at risk for depression. Methods: To {{examine the effects of}} tryptophan on social functioning in individuals with a <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> <b>depression,</b> 40 men and women with at least one first-degree relative with depression received tryptophan (1 g three times a day) and placebo for 14 days each in a double-blind crossover design and recorded their social behavior and mood during everyday interpersonal encounters. Participants also provided daily ratings of their positive and negative cognitions concerning their social functioning. Results: Tryptophan improved mood. Unexpectedly, tryptophan increased quarrelsome behavior and reduced agreeable behavior, specifically during interactions at home. The behavioral effects of tryptophan were not moderated by mood or by the interaction partner. Negative social cognitions were lower when tryptophan was given second and lower during placebo when placebo was given second. Conclusion: Overall, tryptophan may not alter social behavior in individuals with a <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> as it does in irritable people. However, the behavioral effects of tryptophan at home might be seen as a way for individuals with a <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> to achieve more control. Over time, this may positively influence the way they feel and think about themselves in a social context...|$|R
40|$|Limited {{information}} is available about the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> in children with autism and other pervasive developmental disorders (FDD). Although depression has been de-scribed in autistic children, questions about its validity have often been raised. One approach {{to address this issue}} is to investigate <b>family</b> histories <b>of</b> those autistic children diagnosed with clinical depression. Based on data available in nonautistic children, autistic children with depression would be expected to show an increased <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> <b>depression.</b> Since studies <b>of</b> this nature have not been attempted in autistic children, we compared the <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> 13 autistic/PDD children with depression (11 male; 2 female; M full-scale IQ 86. 2, SD 24. 2; M age 10. 4 years, SD 2. 2) with 10 autistic/FDD children without a history of current or previous depression (9 male; 1 female; M full-scale IQ 67, SD 12. 9; M age 10. 5 years, SD 1. 6). Diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> was based on the DSM-III-R criteria and confirmed inde-pendently by two psychiatrists. Ten (77 %) of the depressed children had a positive <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> compared to 3 (30 %) of the nondepressed group, t(21) =- 2. 4; p =. 02. These findings lend support to the validity <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> as a distinct condition in some children with autism/PDD and suggest that, as in the normal population, autistic children who suffer from depression {{are more likely to have}} a <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> <b>depression...</b>|$|R

5000|$|The use of term diathesis in {{the fields}} of {{medicine}} and psychiatry dates back to the 1800s; however, the diathesis-stress model was not introduced and utilized to describe the development of psychopathology until it was used to explain schizophrenia in the 1960s.The diathesis-stress model is used in many fields of psychology, specifically for studying the development of psychopathology. It is useful for the purposes of understanding the interplay of nature and nurture in the susceptibility to psychological disorders throughout the lifespan. Diathesis-stress models can also assist in determining who will develop a disorder and who will not. For example, in the context <b>of</b> <b>depression,</b> the diathesis-stress model can help explain why Person A may become depressed while Person B does not, even when exposed to the same stressors. [...] More recently, the diathesis-stress model has been used to explain why some individuals are more at risk for developing a disorder than others. For example, children who have a <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> are generally more vulnerable to developing a depressive disorder themselves. A child who has a <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> and who has been exposed to a particular stressor, such as exclusion or rejection by his or her peers, {{would be more likely to}} develop depression than a child with a <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> that has an otherwise positive social network of peers.|$|R

40|$|Objective: To examine factors {{increasing}} {{the risk for}} onset and persistence of subthreshold mania and depression. Method: In a prospective cohort community study, the association between risk factors [a <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> mood disorders, trauma, substance use, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and temperamental/personality traits] and onset of manic/depressive symptoms was determined in 705 adolescents. The interaction between baseline risk factors and baseline symptoms in predicting 8 -year follow-up symptoms was used to model the impact of risk factors on persistence. Results: Onset of manic symptoms was associated with cannabis use and novelty seeking (NS), but NS predicted a transitory course. Onset of depressive symptoms {{was associated with a}} <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> <b>depression.</b> ADHD and harm avoidance (HA) were associated with persistence of depressive symptoms, while trauma and a <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> predicted a transitory course.

40|$|Background: The strongest {{risk factor}} for {{depression}} is having a <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> the condition. Many individuals with a <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> are concerned about their personal risk for depression and report unmet educational and psychological support needs. No supportive and/or educational interventions are currently available that target this group of individuals. In this study we will develop and evaluate the first online psycho-educational intervention targeted to individuals with a <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> <b>depression.</b> Genetic risk information and evidence-rated information on preventive strategies for depression will be provided to such individuals in a general practice setting. The intervention will also incorporate a risk assessment tool. The content and delivery of the intervention will be pilot-tested. Methods/design: The proposed intervention will be evaluated in the general practitioner (GPs) setting, using a cluster randomized controlled trial. GP practices will be randomized to provide either access to the online, targeted psycho-educational intervention or brief generic information about depression (control) to eligible patients. Eligibility criteria include having at least one first-degree relative with either major depressive disorder (MDD) or bipolar disorder (BD). The primary outcome measure is 'intention to adopt, or actual adoption of, risk-reducing strategies'. Secondary outcome measures include: depression symptoms, perceived stigma <b>of</b> <b>depression,</b> knowledge <b>of</b> risk factors for development <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> and risk-reducing strategies, and perceived risk <b>of</b> developing <b>depression</b> or having a recurrence <b>of</b> <b>family</b> history. Over {{the course of the}} study, participants will complete online questionnaires at three time points: at baseline, and two weeks and six months after receiving the intervention or control condition. Discussion: This novel psycho-educational intervention will provide individuals with a <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> with information on evidence-based strategies for the prevention <b>of</b> <b>depression,</b> thus, we hypothesize, enabling them to make appropriate lifestyle choices and implement behaviors designed to reduce their risk for depression. The online psycho-educational intervention will also provide a model for similar interventions aimed at individuals at increased familial risk for other psychiatric disorders. 10 page(s...|$|R

Irritability is common in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) but {{little is known about}} its association with depression risk in this group. This study aims to establish levels of irritability and prevalence of DMDD in a clinical sample of children with ADHD, and examine their association with anxiety, <b>depression</b> and <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> <b>depression.</b> Methods: The sample consisted of 696 children (mean age 10. 9 years) with a diagnosis of ADHD, recruited from UK child psychiatry and paediatric clinics. Parents completed the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Assessment, a semi-structured diagnostic interview, about their child. This was used to establish prevalence of DMDD, anxiety disorder and depressive disorder, as well as obtain symptom scores for irritability, anxiety and depression.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that low central serotonin, induced by acute tryptophan depletion (ATD), results in depressed mood and impairs cognition in healthy volunteers with a predisposition for depression. It remains unknown whether ATD affects emotional processing via mood changes or directly. In the present study we investigated the interaction between vulnerability for depression and the effect of ATD on mood, cognition and the associated brain activation. In a previous functional MRI study, we tested the effect of ATD during a combined cognitive and emotional Stroop task in healthy women without a <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> (FH-). In this study, we present the data of an additional group of 12 healthy women with a positive <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> unipolar <b>depression</b> (FH+). The effect of ATD on mood and Stroop performance was different for the FH+ group as compared with the FH- group. Scores on the <b>depression</b> sub-scale <b>of</b> the Profile of Mood States (POMS) did not correlate with performance changes, but did correlate with the anterior cingulate cortex response during Stroop interference.

A <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> and perceived poor intimate relationships are internal risk factors associated with this type <b>of</b> <b>depression.</b> It is important to know these risk factors in order to take steps to recognize and help prevent this illness.|$|R
40|$|Background Psychotic {{depression}} {{is arguably the}} most diagnostically stable subtype of major depressive disorder, and an attractive target of study in a famously heterogeneous mental illness. Previous imaging studies have identified abnormal volumes of the hippocampus, amygdala, and subcallosal region of the anterior cingulate cortex (scACC) in psychotic depression, though studies have not yet examined the role <b>of</b> <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> in these relationships. Methods 20 participants with psychotic depression preparing to undergo electroconvulsive therapy and 20 healthy comparison participants (13 women and 7 men in each group) underwent structural brain imaging in a 1. 5 T MRI scanner. 15 <b>of</b> the psychotic <b>depression</b> group had a first-degree relative with diagnosed affective disorders, while the healthy control group had no first-degree relatives with affective disorders. Depression severity was assessed with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and duration of illness was assessed in all patients. Automated neural nets were used to isolate the hippocampi and amygdalae in each scan, and an established manual method was used to parcellate the anterior cingulate cortex into dorsal, rostral, subcallosal, and subgenual regions. The volumes of these regions were compared between groups. Effects <b>of</b> laterality and <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> affective disorders were examined as well. Results Patients with psychotic depression had significantly smaller left scACC and bilateral hippocampal volumes, while no group differences in other anterior cingulate cortex subregions or amygdala volumes were present. Hippocampal atrophy was found in all patients with psychotic depression, but reduced left scACC volume was found only in the patients with a <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> <b>depression.</b> Conclusions Patients with psychotic depression showed significant reduction in hippocampal volume bilaterally, perhaps due to high cortisol states associated with this illness. Reduced left scACC volume may be a vulnerability factor related to <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> <b>depression...</b>|$|R
40|$|The Center <b>of</b> Epidemiologic Studies <b>Depression</b> Scale (CES-D) is a {{commonly}} used self-report scale to measure depressive symptoms {{in the general}} population. In the present study, the Dutch version of the CES-D was administered {{to a sample of}} 837 Dutch-speaking adults of Belgium to examine the factor structure of the scale. Using confirmatory factory analysis (CFA), four first-order models and two second-order models were tested, and the second-order factor model with three pairs of correlated error terms provided the best fit to the data. Second, five socio-demographic variables (age, gender, education level, relation status, and <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> <b>depression)</b> were included as covariates to the second-order factor model to explore the associations between background characteristics and the latent factor depression using a multiple indicators and multiple causes (MIMIC) approach. Age had a significantly negative effect on depression, but the effect was not substantial. Female gender, lower education level, being single or widowed, and having a <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> were found to be significant predictors of higher levels <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> symptomatology. Finally, percentile norms on the CES-D raw scores were provided for subgroups of gender by education level for the general Dutch-speaking adult population of Belgium...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the prevalence and associated risk factors for post stroke depression (PSD), and their clinical correlations. Method: A consecutive cohort of 102 ischemic stroke patients {{with a mean age}} of 72. 6 ± 7. 2 years, were studied. Hamilton depression rating scale (HDRS), modified motor assess-ment scale (MMAS) and Barthel index (BI) were administered. Risk factors of PSD studied were gender, later-ality <b>of</b> stroke, <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> and post stroke functional impairment. Results: From assessment with the HDRS, 71 (69. 6 %) of the subjects were non-depressive and the rest 31 (30. 4 %) had depression. De-pressive symptoms (HDRS> 10) were relatively common, but the prevalence <b>of</b> severe <b>depression</b> (HDRS> 17) was only 7. 0 %. Patients with depressive symptoms were more likely to be female(X 2 = 4. 01, P = 0. 039), have a <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> depression(X 2 = 3. 87, P = 0. 045), and a poor functional status(MMAS, t = 2. 18 and P = 0. 016; BI, t = 3. 74 and P = 0. 009).

40|$|Anxious-retarded {{depression}} is a two-dimensionally defined subcategory <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> based on high scores for both anxiety and retardation. The anxious-retarded subcategory {{is related to}} melancholia as defined by DSM-IV. Patients with this diagnosis exhibit elevated plasma arginine vasopressin (AVP) and a high correlation between plasma vasopressin and cortisol, which suggests vasopressinergic overactivation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. In this report, we present the multidimensional derivation of the anxious-retarded subcategory from DSM-IV melancholia, and a second step in the validation of this anxious-retarded subcategory by exploring its relation to <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> <b>depression.</b> The patient sample comprised 89 patients with major depression and encompassed 66 patients investigated previously regarding plasma AVP and cortisol.

40|$|Objectives: To {{study the}} {{duration}} <b>of</b> <b>depression,</b> recovery over time, and predictors of prognosis in an older cohort (≥ 55 years) in primary care. Design: Longitudinal cohort study, with three years' follow-up. Setting: 32 general practices in West Friesland, the Netherlands. Participants: 234 patients aged 55 {{years or more}} with a prevalent major depressive disorder. Main outcome measures: Depression at baseline and every six months using structured diagnostic interviews (primary care evaluation of mental disorders according to diagnoses in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition) and a measure of severity of symptoms (Montgomery Åsberg depression rating scale). The main outcome measures were time to recovery {{and the likelihood of}} recovery at different time points. Multivariable analyses were used to identify variables predicting prognosis. Results: The median duration of a major depressive episode was 18. 0 months (95 % confidence interval 12. 8 to 23. 1). 35 % of depressed patients recovered within one year, 60 % within two years, and 68 % within three years. A poor outcome was associated with severity <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> at baseline, a <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> <b>depression,</b> and poorer physical functioning. During follow-up functional status remained limited in patients with chronic depression but not in those who had recovered. Conclusion: Depression among patients aged 55 years or more in primary care has a poor prognosis. Using readily available prognostic factors (for example, severity of the index episode, a <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> <b>depression,</b> and functional decline) could help direct treatment to those at highest risk of a poor prognosis...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Family</b> history <b>of</b> major {{depressive}} disorder (MDD) increases individuals 2 ̆ 7 {{vulnerability to}} depression and alters the way depression manifests itself. Emotion processing and attention shifting are functions altered by MDD and <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> the disease; therefore, {{it is important to}} recognize the neural correlates of these functions in association with both factors. METHODS: Our study determines neural correlates of emotion processing and attention shifting for healthy individuals and patients with MDD with and without <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> <b>depression.</b> We compared the performance and neural activity in a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment examining emotion processing and attention shifting in all participants. RESULTS: Our sample included 4 study groups: healthy controls without <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> (n = 25), patients with MDD without <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> the disease (n = 20), unaffected healthy first-degree relatives of patients with MDD (n = 21) and patients with MDD with <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> MDD (n = 30). Compared with healthy controls, unaffected first-degree relatives overactivate the somatosensory cortex and the attention controlling areas during both emotion processing and attention shifting. Patients with <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> MDD have stronger neural activation in subcortical areas during shifting attention from negative stimuli. Patients without <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> MDD have less activation in the paralimbic regions and more activation in core limbic areas, especially during emotion processing. LIMITATIONS: The conclusions about the intergroup differences in activation can be drawn only about neural areas engaged in the task. CONCLUSION: Unaffected first-degree relatives of patients with MDD overreact to external emotional cues and compensate for the vulnerability with increased involvement of executive control. Patients with a <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> MDD have less executive control over their attentional shifts in the face of negative stimuli. Patients without a <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> MDD process emotional stimuli in a more visceral way than controls...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the prevalence of depressive symptoms in a community sample of 13 -year-old adolescents and identify associated features. Thirteen year-old adolescents attending private and public schools in Porto (n = 1, 988, 52. 2 % females) were evaluated from October 2003 to June 2004 and completed a questionnaire including health behaviors and the Beck Depression Inventory II. A questionnaire on parents’ socio-demographics and clinical characteristics was sent home. Data were analyzed separately by sex. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using logistic regression. The prevalence of depressive symptoms was 18. 8 % in girls and 7. 6 % in boys (p < 0. 001). Boys with a <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> and girls with smoking habits had a significantly increased risk of depressive symptoms (OR = 2. 18, 95 %CI 1. 00 – 4. 71; OR = 2. 34, 95 %CI 1. 46 – 3. 76).

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that isolated delusional-like experiences (DLE) are common in the general population. Furthermore, there is preliminary evidence to suggest that these experiences are more common in those with a <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> mental disorders. We had the opportunity to explore the association between <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> a wide range of mental disorders and DLE in an Australian general population survey. The Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing 2007 examined 8, 841 adult community residents. The Composite International Diagnostic Interview was used to generate various DSM-IV lifetime diagnoses and to assess DLE. The participants were asked to report mental disorders in their first-degree relatives. The influence <b>of</b> <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> mental disorders on DLE endorsement was assessed with logistic regression, with adjustments for age, sex, and the presence of comorbid psychiatric diagnoses in the respondents. A <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> anxiety, <b>depression,</b> schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or alcohol or illicit drug abuse/dependence was each significantly associated with endorsement of DLE, and these associations remained significant when we adjusted for the presence of mental illness in the respondents. When we examined a more restrictive definition of DLE, only a <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> and schizophrenia remained significantly associated with DLE. DLE are associated with a <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> a wide range of mental disorders.

[...] For example, a child with a <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> likely has a genetic vulnerability to depressive disorder. This child has also been exposed to environmental factors associated with parental depression that increase his or her vulnerability to developing depression as well. Protective factors, such as strong peer network, involvement in extracurricular activities, and a positive relationship with the non-depressed parent, interact with the child's vulnerabilities in determining the progression to psychopathology versus normative development.|$|R
40|$|A {{retrospective}} data {{analysis was conducted}} to evaluate the usefulness of baseline characteristics in predicting treatment response to antidepressant medication in 97 outpatients with nonpsychotic major depression treated for up to sixteen weeks with nefazodone. Baseline demographics (gender), illness features (symptom severity, length of illness, length of current episode, number of episodes, age of onset, longitudinal subtype, endogenicity, melancholia, <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> mood disorders), and social features (living status) were evaluated. Response to treatment {{was defined as a}} ≥ 50 % reduction in the 17 -item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD 17) score. The results of a survival analysis indicated that patients with shorter histories of illness (< 4 years), a negative <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> <b>depression,</b> and those who were either married or were living with someone {{were more likely to have}} a positive outcome during the acute phase treatment <b>of</b> <b>depression.</b> The main findings are consistent with extensive previous literature indicating a better short-term outcome <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> where illness is shorter, where there is no family history, and where there is better social support...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} <b>of</b> elevated <b>depression</b> risk {{recently discovered}} among adult persons raised by same-sex parents with possible precipitating conditions in childhood has not previously been acknowledged. This study tests whether such inattention is supportable. Logistic regression based risk ratios were estimated from longitudinal measures {{of mental health}} outcomes observed in three waves (at ages 15, 22, and 28) of the US National Survey of Adolescent to Adult Health (n= 15, 701). At age 28, the adults raised by same-sex parents were at over twice the risk <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> (CES-D: risk ratio 2. 6, 95 % CI 1. 4 – 4. 6) as persons raised by man-woman parents. These findings should be interpreted with caution. Elevated risk was associated with imbalanced parental closeness and parental child abuse in <b>family</b> <b>of</b> origin; <b>depression,</b> suicidality, and anxiety at age 15; and stigma and obesity. More research and policy attention to potentially problematic conditions for children with same-sex parents appears warranted...|$|R

Methods: This case–control study was conducted in pregnant females who delivered at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital from November 2010 to October 2013 and had postpartum psychological assessment. Demographic, medical, and postpartum psychological status assessments, intrapartum data including method of induction of labor, mode of labor analgesia, duration of first and second stages of labor, mode of delivery, and pain intensity on hospital admission and after delivery were collected. PPD was assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and clinical assessment by the psychiatrist. Results: There were 62 cases of PPD and 417 controls after childbirth within 4 – 8 weeks. The odds of PPD was significantly lower (33 of 329 [10. 0 %]) in females who received epidural analgesia for labor compared with those who chose nonepidural analgesia (29 of 150 [19. 3 %]) ([odds ratio] 0. 47 (0. 27 – 0. 8), P= 0. 0078). The multivariate analysis showed that absence of labor epidural analgesia, increasing age, <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> <b>depression,</b> history <b>of</b> <b>depression,</b> and previous history of PPD were independent risk factors for development of PPD. Conclusion: The absence of labor epidural analgesia remained as an independent risk factor for development of PPD when adjusted for psychiatric predictors of PPD such as history <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> or PPD and <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> <b>depression.</b> Keywords: epidural analgesia, childbirth, Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scal...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} this study was to test the {{differences}} between adult children from alcoholic families with adult children from non-alcoholic <b>families</b> on levels <b>of</b> <b>depression,</b> self-esteem, and anxiety. The sample consisted of 203 volunteers, all from the Counselor Education Department, 150 females and 53 males, ages 19 and older. Volunteers who were noted as being adult children <b>of</b> alcoholic <b>families</b> numbered 60. Measures used were the Children of Alcoholics Screening Test (CAST), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and the Coopersmith Adult Self-Esteem Inventory (SEI). Multivariate Analysis of Variance was used to test for differences between groups. In addition, a secondary analysis using a one-way MANOVA was used to test for differences between dysfunctional and functional <b>family</b> <b>of</b> origin status on the dependent variables <b>of</b> <b>depression,</b> self-esteem, and anxiety...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAccording to {{cognitive}} theories <b>of</b> <b>depression,</b> individuals susceptible to depression attend selectively to negative information. The {{purpose of the}} study was to examine if such an affective processing bias is present in never-depressed individuals with a <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> major depressive disorder (MDD). Formerly depressed female patients having at least one first-degree relative with a history of MDD (n= 23), their never-depressed female siblings (n= 21) and never-depressed female controls (n= 21) performed a conventional and an emotional Stroop task using negative, positive and neutral words. A significant effect was found of group on negative processing bias; post hoc comparisons indicated that never-depressed siblings showed a larger negative processing bias than never-depressed controls. No significant differences were observed in positive bias or conventional interference between the three groups. Our findings suggest that never-depressed females with a <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> <b>depression,</b> like depressed patients, have more difficulties to inhibit negative material and to direct their attention towards task-specific material. This adds to the existing evidence that affective processing bias is a trait characteristic that contributes to the onset <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> and that could be a useful endophenotype for MDD...|$|R
40|$|Persistent {{depressive}} disorder or dysthymia is {{a recurrent}} depressive disorder with no clearly demarcated episodes. Onset is insidious and can occur in adolescence or adulthood. Dysthymia frequently remains unrecognized and undiagnosed for years. Co-morbid major depression, anxiety, personality, somatoform and substance abuse disorders are common. Symptoms center on sad mood, pessimism and hopelessness. Sufferers experience significant functional impairment and {{are at risk of}} death by suicide. Those most at risk are female, unmarried, live in high income countries and have <b>family</b> histories <b>of</b> <b>depression.</b> Screening instruments include the Cornell Dysthymia Rating Scale (CDRS). Typical treatments are antidepressant medications and cognitive behavioral analysis system of psychotherapy (CBASP).
