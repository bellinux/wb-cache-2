[...] implies {{an initial}} [...] "such as...", {{and it is likely}} that this first woman treated was Pyrrha, wife of Deucalion. There is some debate about whether the Catalogue included an account of the Flood myth, but the creation of a race of humans born from stones cast by Deucalion and Pyrrha does appear to have figured in the poem. Zeus unsurprisingly had first pick from the catalogue of women, and sired Hellen by Pyrrha. Pyrrha also had three daughters by Deucalion: Thyia, Protogeneia and Pandora, who was named for her maternal grandmother, the famous Pandora. Like their mother, these three lay with Zeus, bearing sons from whom several early Greek tribes were said to descend. Thyia bore Magnes and Macedon; Protogeneia bore Aethlius, the grandfather of Aetolus; and Pandora's son was Graecus.|$|E

2500|$|Modern {{linguistic}} {{studies have}} shown that Brazilian Portuguese is a topic-prominent or topic- and subject-prominent language. Sentences with topic are extensively used in Portuguese, perhaps more in Brazilian Portuguese most often by means of turning an element (object or verb) in the sentence into an <b>introductory</b> <b>phrase,</b> on which the body of the sentence constitutes a comment (topicalization), thus emphasizing it, as in Esses assuntos eu não conheço bem– literally, [...] "These subjects I don't know [...] well". Although this sentence would be perfectly acceptable in Portugal. In fact, in the Portuguese language, the anticipation of the verb or object {{at the beginning of the}} sentence, repeating it or using the respective pronoun referring to it, is also quite common, e.g. in Essa menina, eu não sei o que fazer com ela ("This girl, I don't know what to do with her") or Com essa menina eu não sei o que fazer ("With this girl I don't know what to do"). The use of redundant pronouns for means of topicalization is considered grammatically incorrect, because the topicalized noun phrase, according to traditional European analysis, has no syntactic function. This kind of construction, however, is often used in European Portuguese. Brazilian grammars traditionally treat this structure similarly, rarely mentioning such a thing as topic. Nevertheless, the so-called anacoluthon has taken on a new dimension in Brazilian Portuguese. The poet Carlos Drummond de Andrade once wrote a short metapoema (a metapoem, i.e., a poem about poetry, a specialty for which he was renowned) treating the concept of anacoluto: ...|$|E

5000|$|Winningham and Barton-Burke (2000) {{argue that}} [...] "slavish worship" [...] of {{political}} correctness contributes to the woozle effect. Dutton sees the woozle effect {{as an example of}} confirmation bias and links it to belief perseverance and groupthink. Because in the social sciences empirical evidence may be based on experiential reports rather than objective measurements, there may be a tendency for researchers to align evidence with expectation. According to Dutton {{it is also possible that}} the social sciences may be likely to align with contemporary views and ideals of social justice, leading to bias in favor of those ideals. Gambrill (2012) links the woozle effect to the processes that create pseudoscience.

5000|$|Gundry {{notes that}} the <b>introductory</b> <b>phrases</b> of the antithesis has slowly been shrinking, in this verse it reverts to {{the full length of}} Matthew 5:21, renewed by the {{addition}} of the opening again. Unlike the previous antitheses this verse does not contain a direct quotation form the Old Testament, but similar sentiments are expressed in a number of places in the scripture and Hill reports that Mosaic law forbade [...] "false and irreverent oaths." [...] The first half of the quote seems to come from Leviticus 19:12 and the second half from Psalm 50 verse 14 with a mix of LXX wording and seemingly original translation. However, Psalm 50:14 is on vows, not oaths, and Matthew changes the word vow to oath. Jewish scholars made a distinction between the two concepts, but scholars argue this distinction was unclear and Numbers 30:12 seems to present them as essentially the same. Matthew's conflation of the two ideas is thus possible. Schweizer feels that the wording implies that Jesus is only discussing oaths associated with vows, and that he never speaks against the oaths of innocence or truthfulness that were not linked with vows.|$|R

The data of this thesis was a novel entitled Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows by J. K. Rowling and the source of data were 150 sentences containing hedges found in the novel. The theories used were hedges by Yule, the taxonomy of hedges by Salager-Meyer, and maxims of cooperative principle by Grice. This thesis used descriptive quantitative approach as its approach. In collecting the data, the writer used a table which classified hedges into its taxonomies. For the data analysis, the writer analyzed the data based on the taxonomies in details.

Failures in using hedges properly can threat the face of students and other stakeholders in academic contexts. This research aims at investigating how hedges are used by the tertiary students when addressing questions in a discussion session of a presentation. This research is a qualitative research employing interaction analysis method. The participants in this research were nine students of Language in Use course of master of English education program in a state university in Bandung. The findings demonstrate that hedges were found in all questions addressed to the presenters and the lecturer. <b>Introductory</b> <b>phrases</b> were the most frequently-used forms used to hedge and hedges function mostly to attenuate epistemic commitment in addressing questions.

In total, 120 vocalizations from six colonies were analyzed {{to provide a}} description of the acoustic structure and for the presence of geographic variation. The complex harbor seal vocalizations may be described by how the frequency bandwidth varies over time. An algorithm that identifies the boundaries between noise and signal from digital spectrograms was developed in order to extract a frequency bandwidth contour. The contours were used as inputs for multivariate analysis. The vocalizations' sound types (e. g., pulsed sound, whistle, and broadband nonharmonic sound) were determined by comparing the vocalizations' spectrographic representations with sound waves produced by known sound sources. Comparison between colonies revealed differences in the frequency contours, as well as some geographical variation in use of sound types. The vocal differences may reflect a limited exchange of individuals between the six colonies due to long distances and strong site fidelity. Geographically different vocal repertoires have potential for identifying discrete breeding colonies of harbor seals, but more information is needed on {{the nature and extent of}} early movements of young, the degree of learning, and the stability of the vocal repertoire.

Hillary Clinton {{is one of the}} inspiring women nowadays. Considering her existence to inspire people especially women, this pragmatics study attempts to find the types, functions, and type in relation to each function in Clinton?s utterances. The theory that is applied to find type of hedges is the taxonomy of hedges by Salager-Meyer (1997), while the theory of multiple functions by Jennifer Coates (1996) is applied to find functions of hedges. It is found that Clinton?s utterances contain a lot of hedges, classified into seven types and four functions of hedges. The most frequent type is <b>Introductory</b> <b>Phrases.</b> The second most frequent is approximators of degree, quantity, frequency and time. The following are modal auxiliary, adjectival, adverbial, excluding nominal phrases, compound hedges, "if" clauses, and modal lexical verbs. In addition, noun as one of types of hedges that could not be found. Furthermore, functions of hedges that appear the most is expressing doubt, which is followed by searching for the right word, avoiding playing the expert, sensitivity to other?s feeling, and expressing confidence. In addition, it is found that one type can have more than one function depending on the context. Besides, the findings reveal certain types of hedges are used in relation to each function. Although, the result reveals that Hillary uses hedges to express doubt the most frequently, it can not be concluded that she is lack of confidence.

In both types of dialects the differentiation between (pragmatically) marked and unmarked boundaries is relevant.

Thus in the tone dialects pragmatically marked boundaries are assigned high pitch, while in nontonal dialect it is a pitch fall that has a high pragmatic load...|$|R
