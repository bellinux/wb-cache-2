5|$|British <b>immersive</b> theatre company Punchdrunk took {{inspiration}} from the Paisley witch trials for their ongoing New York City production, Sleep No More. Gallow Green, {{the name of the}} fictitious Scottish town that serves as the show's setting, as well as many of the characters (including Fulton, Bargarran, Reid, Agnes Naismith, Catherine Campbell, James Lindsey, and Nurse Christian Shaw) were all taken from the witch trials and interwoven with the elements of William Shakespeare's Macbeth found throughout the <b>immersive</b> production.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} three hours and 15 minutes of footage were shot before editing, where it was brought down to 130 minutes (119 without the credits), marking the longest {{stand-alone}} Iron Man film. Post-production also had a 3D conversion and a digital remaster for the IMAX release. Todd-AO mixed the sound in Dolby Atmos to enhance the <b>immersive</b> experience.|$|E
5|$|Episode Two was {{developed}} simultaneously with Episode One by a development {{team led by}} David Speyrer. This schedule of simultaneous development aided them in streamlining the story between the two games to create an <b>immersive</b> story. The technology used was the same for both games, allowing the development teams to quickly fix any technical problems that might arise from either game; this happened often because of the multi-platform release.|$|E
5|$|Like its predecessor, Riven is a {{point and}} click {{adventure}} game played from a first-person perspective. The player explores <b>immersive</b> environments depicted through a large series of computer generated stills using mouse clicks for movement or to manipulate objects within reach. By operating mechanical contraptions and deciphering codes and symbols discovered in the surroundings, the vaguely explained goal can eventually be reached.|$|E
5|$|Within a {{few years}} all of Delrina's major market focuses—fax and form software—would be {{overtaken}} or superseded by email, e-commerce and the Internet. Daily planning software remains a niche market, and the <b>immersive</b> 3D environment used for creating multimedia presentations has (so far) fallen by the wayside in favour of more traditional user interfaces. Symantec ended support for its final WinFax PRO product in June 2006.|$|E
5|$|After it was showcased at E3 2000, Dungeon Siege {{proceeded}} {{to win the}} Best RPG award from Game Revolution and Most <b>Immersive</b> Role-playing Game award from GameSpot. After release, it was nominated for the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences's 2003 Annual Interactive Achievement Awards in the Computer Role-Playing Game of the Year and Innovation in Computer Gaming categories, though it did not win either, losing to Neverwinter Nights and Battlefield 1942, respectively. It did win the Best PC Game Graphics award from IGN.|$|E
5|$|ArtRave's {{concept and}} name {{are derived from}} the {{similarly}} named release party for Artpop. The stage resembled a cave and consisted of two sections connected by catwalks made of translucent lucite, allowing the audience to move underneath the catwalks while still being able to watch the show. Gaga's costumes in the show included one with tentacles, one with bejeweled wings, a rave-inspired outfit and a necklace made of marijuana leaves. Costume designers and choreographers aspired to make a single, coherent show. The lighting fixtures used for the concert were from Clay Paky and the main idea was to create an <b>immersive</b> rave experience with the lights. They were also designed to accommodate minor changes in the show sequences.|$|E
5|$|BioShock {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} and was particularly praised by critics for its morality-based storyline, <b>immersive</b> environments, and its unique setting, {{and is considered}} {{to be one of the}} greatest video games of all time and a demonstration of video game as an art form. It received several Game of the Year awards from different media outlets, including from BAFTA, Game Informer, Spike TV, and X-Play. Since its release a direct sequel has been released, BioShock 2 by 2K Marin, as well as a third game titled BioShock Infinite by Irrational Games. A remastered version of the game was released on Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on September 13, 2016, as part of , along with BioShock 2 and Infinite.|$|E
5|$|For its United States release, {{the film}} was {{originally}} scheduled to be released on November 25, 2015, but 20th Century Fox switched The Martian with Victor Frankenstein, so the former would be its first film for all audiences in the country's Autumn season (September–November). On the film's 3D screenings, RealD's chief Anthony Marcoly said 3D technology was proliferating from action-packed blockbuster films commonly released in the United States' summer season. Marcoly said the technology was being used in more <b>immersive</b> storytelling, citing The Martian and The Walk (released the same year) as two examples.|$|E
5|$|Grin {{announced}} in May 2001 {{that it was}} working on an arcade version of Ballistics for distribution by Triotech. The game's gameplay had to be reworked to suit an arcade environment, and support was added for multiplayer games with up to eight linked cabinets. Triotech designed a unique reclined seating cabinet for the game, {{the aim of the}} design was to offer the player a more comfortable and <b>immersive</b> experience. The inspiration for the design came to Triotech co-founder, Ernest Yale; who whilst putting his feet up on the desk, realised how comfortable the playing position was. Ballistics was released for arcades in January 2002.|$|E
5|$|In {{development}} since 1999, {{the project}} was repeatedly delayed, going through several revisions and having {{some of its most}} ambitious and <b>immersive</b> features abandoned and the initially planned PlayStation 2 version cancelled. Although well received by most critics and regarded by some {{as one of the best}} horror video games of all time, Dark Corners of the Earth was a commercial failure. At least two additional Cthulhu Mythos games were planned by Headfirst Productions, including a direct sequel titled Call of Cthulhu: Destiny's End, but both were never completed due to Headfirst's bankruptcy.|$|E
5|$|Jedi Knight uses both 3D {{graphics}} and surround sound. It {{is one of}} the early games to adopt the use of 3D graphics hardware acceleration using Microsoft Direct3D. The 3D sound technology was tweaked extensively to give an <b>immersive</b> feel to the game. This was achieved by experimentation using many different sound effects and playback styles. Between levels Jedi Knight features full motion video cutscenes. The characters are represented by live actors while the backgrounds are pre-rendered graphics. The cutscenes included the first lightsaber footage filmed since Return of the Jedi in 1983.|$|E
5|$|Justice League: Alien Invasion 3D (also {{known as}} Justice League 3D – The Ride) is an Interactive Dark Ride {{created by the}} Sally Corporation that is located at Warner Bros. Movie World on the Gold Coast, Australia. It opened on 22 September 2012 and {{requires}} riders to shoot their laser blasters at targets in order to defeat an alien threat. The ride is touted as the world's first Justice League-themed ride and the first ride of its type to feature 3D projections. Justice League: Alien Invasion 3D has been well received with many praising the ride's special effects and <b>immersive</b> theming.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{conceived}} as an adventure game named Dream for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Banjo-Kazooie {{was designed to}} appeal players of all ages {{in a similar vein}} to Walt Disney Animation Studios films. The game was a critical and commercial success, selling nearly two million copies in the United States. It was praised for its detailed graphics, <b>immersive</b> sound, and intricate level design. In 1999, it received two awards from the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences: Console Action Game of the Year and Outstanding Achievement in Art/Graphics. The game was remastered for the Xbox 360 in 2008 and included in the Rare Replay video game compilation for the Xbox One in 2015. A sequel, Banjo-Tooie, was released in 2000.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} team {{hoped the}} new title {{would appeal to}} both newcomers and fans of the series, be accessible and introduce the franchise to a broader audience. They assumed most players would not have played the original Syndicate games. The team also considered {{that because of the}} change in audience tastes and the introduction of new video game platforms, altering the game's perspective to first-person was a correct decision. Turning it into a first-person game was the first design choice made by the team, who hoped allowing players to view from the agent's perspective directly would make the game more <b>immersive</b> for players.|$|E
5|$|The game {{appeared}} on several year-end {{lists of the}} best games of 2013, receiving Game of the Year wins from CNET, Edge, the Golden Joystick Awards, Machinima's Inside Gaming, the Spike VGX, Slant Magazine and Time. It was also named the Best Xbox Game by Canada.com, GameSpot, and IGN, and the Best Multiplatform Game by Destructoid. It was awarded the title of Most <b>Immersive</b> Game at the Inside Gaming Awards, and the Best British Game from BAFTA. Rockstar Games and Rockstar North won Best Studio and Best Developer from Edge, and the BAFTA Academy Fellowship Award at the 10th British Academy Video Games Awards.|$|E
5|$|The game {{received}} {{numerous other}} awards. It {{was awarded the}} title of Most <b>Immersive</b> Game at the Inside Gaming Awards. The general public voted for the game to receive the User Choice Award at the PlayStation Awards 2013 and the Community Choice award from Destructoid. The game received the Platinum Award at the PlayStation Awards, and was named the Best British Game from BAFTA. At IGN's Best of 2013 Awards, it received multiple wins, including Best Xbox 360 Graphics, Best Xbox 360 Sound, and Best Action Game on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and overall.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} not a {{significant}} commercial success but received widespread critical praise and has since become a cult classic. It was lauded for its <b>immersive</b> dialogue, for the dark and relatively obscure Planescape setting, and for the protagonist's unique persona, which shirked many characteristics of traditional role-playing games. It was considered by video game journalists to be the best role-playing game of 1999, and continues to receive attention long after its release, with a source port version of Torment released on April 11, 2017 by Beamdog.|$|E
5|$|The team {{sought to}} create an <b>immersive</b> world for the player and {{to compete with the}} Microsoft Flight Simulator series. Commercially, Flight Unlimited II {{performed}} well enough to recoup its development costs. Critics lauded the game's graphics and simulated airspace, and several praised its physics. However, some considered the game to be inferior to Microsoft Flight Simulator '98. Following the completion of Flight Unlimited II, its team split up to develop Flight Unlimited III (1999) and Flight Combat (later Jane's Attack Squadron) simultaneously. Both projects were troubled, and they contributed to the closure of Looking Glass in May 2000.|$|E
5|$|Upon release, Saw {{received}} mixed reviews. It {{was praised}} for the storyline and multiple endings, {{as well as}} the <b>immersive</b> environment that is true to the Saw film series. The controls and combat system, however, were panned by critics. Since Konami purchased the publishing rights after former publisher Brash Entertainment went bankrupt, Konami had a significant input on the games' final outcome. They stated that they had plans to make Saw their next big franchise as well as a spiritual successor to their other survival horror series, Silent Hill. A sequel, , was released on multiple platforms on October 19, 2010.|$|E
5|$|Cited as an {{influential}} {{title in the}} video game industry {{and one of the}} best games of all time, Shadow of the Colossus is often regarded as an important example of video game as art due to its minimalist landscape designs, <b>immersive</b> gameplay and emotional journey. It received wide critical acclaim by the media and was met with strong sales compared to Ico, due in part to a larger marketing campaign. The soundtrack was also widely praised. The game won several awards for its audio, design, and overall quality. Shadow of the Colossus is also referenced numerous times in debates regarding the art quality and emotional perspectives of video games. A remake of the game with ultra-high definition art assets is currently in development and scheduled for release on the PlayStation 4 in 2018.|$|E
5|$|Forgoing the {{downloadable}} content {{model used}} in previous Guitar Hero games, Guitar Hero Live adds songs {{to the game}} via Guitar Hero TV (GHTV), an online game mode offered free of charge in Guitar Hero Live. Instead of playing the <b>immersive</b> first-person view that the main career mode presents, songs on GHTV are played over the music video or footage of the band playing at a concert. Songs on GHTV are normally offered in a curated rotation, similar to a music video channel, allowing the player to drop in and out, but the player can use collected in-game rewards or use microtransactions to play any available song outside of this rotation. FreeStyleGames found that this approach, {{in contrast to the}} traditional downloadable content model, made it easier to secure licensing rights with artists to use their songs, as well as a throwback to the heyday of music video channels like MTV.|$|E
5|$|Gaga {{performed}} {{songs from}} her third studio album Artpop (2013) at ArtRave, a two-day event hosted by her {{to promote the}} album. In 2014, she headlined her first residency show, with seven shows at the Roseland Ballroom in Manhattan, New York. Later that year, she began the , whose main idea was to create an <b>immersive</b> rave. The tour received a positive response from reviewers, but some criticized it for being disjointed. After the release of her collaborative album with Tony Bennett, Cheek to Cheek (2014), the duo embarked on their Cheek to Cheek Tour, which began in December 2014 and concluded in August 2015. The tour was critically acclaimed, and topped Vulture's list of 10 best concerts of 2015. In 2015, she received her third Billboard Music Award for Top Touring Artist nomination; she was also nominated in 2011 and 2013.|$|E
5|$|In April 2015, Activision {{announced}} a new entry in the series, titled Guitar Hero Live. The title was developed by Activision's internal studio FreeStyleGames, who previously had worked on the DJ Hero spinoff titles. FreeStyleGames were given free rein to reboot the Guitar Hero series for next-generation consoles. One of their first innovations was to drop the standard five-button guitar controller, ultimately designing a six-button guitar controller, with two rows of three buttons each, allowing them to mimic actual guitar fingering. Guitar Hero Live was released with both a career and an online mode. The career mode used full-motion video taken {{from the perspective of}} a lead guitarist underneath the note highway, to create an <b>immersive</b> experience to the player. The online mode, called GHTV, discarded the previous downloadable content approach and used a music video channel approach to stream playable songs to players, adding new songs to the catalog on a weekly basis. The game was released in October 2015.|$|E
5|$|Saw {{received}} mixed reviews. The Xbox 360 {{version of}} the game currently holds an average score of 59 percent on the game aggregator Metacritic, based on 35 reviews; the PlayStation 3 version has 59 percent from 36 reviews. On another aggregator site, GameRankings, the Xbox 360 version has a 60.89 percent score based on 27 reviews, while the PlayStation 3 has 58.57 percent from 23 reviews. The PC version holds a lower score of 44.33 percent, based solely on three reviews. Although the game was nearly universally praised for the storyline and the two endings the game presented and critics consistently mentioned the <b>immersive</b> atmosphere and environment as being true to the Saw series, the quality level of puzzles were mixed, depending on the reviewer. The controls in general were not well received by many, and worse the combat system was panned by nearly every reviewer.|$|E
5|$|The {{title is}} {{considered}} a reboot of the series; instead of using a five-button guitar-shaped game controller, the game shipped with a six-button controller, arranged in two rows of three aimed to provide more realistic fingering positions than the five-button controller. The game includes 42 songs on the game's disc, presented in sets using full motion video taken from the first-person perspective of the lead guitarist as the background visuals to create an <b>immersive</b> experience. Guitar Hero Live does not use traditional downloadable content to expand the game and is not backward compatible with previous songs from Guitar Hero games. Instead, the game includes the online Guitar Hero TV (GHTV) mode modeled after music video channels that players can jump {{in or out of}} at any time, playing through ongoing songs in a curated fashion. GHTV, through in-game rewards and microtransactions, supports the ability to play any song in the library, perform Premium shows where the newest tracks to GHTV will be found, or even unlock all features for a 24-hour period as part of a Party Pass. Two hundred songs were available at the release of the game, with more added over time, averaging about six new songs each week.|$|E

25|$|York {{offers a}} Space and Communication Sciences {{undergraduate}} degree. York’s Centre for Vision Research {{has developed a}} ‘virtual reality room’ called IVY (<b>Immersive</b> Virtual Environment at York) in order to study spatial orientation and perception of gravity and motion. The Canadian Space Agency and National Space Biomedical Research Institute (NSBRI) use this room to strengthen astronauts’ sense of ‘up’ and ‘down’ in zero-gravity environments. The room is a six-sided <b>immersive</b> environment made of the glass used in the CN Tower’s observation deck and includes walls, ceiling, and a floor made of computer-generated pixel maps.
