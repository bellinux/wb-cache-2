25|$|Social ecology {{is closely}} related to the work and ideas of Murray Bookchin and {{influenced}} by anarchist Peter Kropotkin.

25|$|Harmful {{environmental}} {{issues such as}} ozone depletion, acidification, eutrophication and climate change came to the public's attention in the same period, and caused the onset of environmental science and environmental technology.

25|$|Also, {{shortly before}} his death in 1992, Asimov {{approved}} an outline for three novels, known as the Caliban trilogy by Roger MacBride Allen, set between Robots and Empire and the Empire series. The Caliban trilogy describes the terraforming of the Spacer world Inferno, a planet where an <b>ecological</b> <b>crisis</b> forces the Spacers to abandon many long-cherished parts of their culture. Allen's novels echo the uncertainties that Asimov's later books express about the Three Laws of Robotics, and in particular the way a thoroughly roboticized culture can degrade human initiative.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{try to figure}} out how capital logic caused <b>ecological</b> <b>crises</b> since {{capitalism}} developed. Furthermore I attempt to explore the relationship of capital logic and socialist countries. China, being a socialist country, is seriously bothered by <b>ecological</b> <b>crises.</b> I argued wether plan economy or market economy, when the government is deeply influenced by the lure of rapid economy growth, capital logic would dominate society, and <b>ecological</b> <b>crises</b> are inevitable. It is time for China to begin to implement controls on the market to improve ecological outcomes and rethink the concept of socialism. I conclude that <b>ecological</b> <b>crises</b> can be resolved, depending on whether China can move on from its traditional misunderstanding of socialism and make socialism redress the failure of the market. I make some suggestions, including Green GDP, restricted consumerism and narrowing the income gap. These may help to solve the current environmental crisis. </p...|$|R

25|$|At present, it {{is still}} {{believed}} that molecular oxygen {{was not a significant}} fraction of Earth's atmosphere until after photosynthetic life forms evolved and began to produce it in large quantities as a byproduct of their metabolism. This radical shift from a chemically inert to an oxidizing atmosphere caused an <b>ecological</b> <b>crisis,</b> sometimes called the oxygen catastrophe. At first, oxygen would have quickly combined with other elements in Earth's crust, primarily iron, removing it from the atmosphere. After the supply of oxidizable surfaces ran out, oxygen would have begun to accumulate in the atmosphere, and the modern high-oxygen atmosphere would have developed. Evidence for this lies in older rocks that contain massive banded iron formations that were laid down as iron oxides.|$|E
25|$|In pre-modern times, {{environmental}} issues were not widely discussed, though Ashoka banned {{the burning of}} forests and promoted the planting of trees in his edicts. Bhikkhu Bodhi, an American Theravada monk, has been outspoken {{about the issue of}} environmental crisis. Bodhi holds that the root of the current <b>ecological</b> <b>crisis</b> is the belief that increased production and consumption to satisfy our material and sensual desires leads to well being. The subjugation of nature is directly opposed to the Buddhist view of non-harming and dwelling in nature. Buddhist activists such as Ajahn Pongsak in Thailand and the Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement have worked for reforestation and environmental protection. The Dalai Lama also professes the close relationship of human beings and nature, saying that since humans come from nature, {{there is no point in}} going against it. He advocates that a clean environment should be considered a basic human right and that it is our responsibility as humans to ensure that we do all we can to pass on a healthy world to those who come after us.|$|E

40|$|The {{notion of}} a {{political}} economic opportunity structure not only provides a sociological description of capitalism’s economic and <b>ecological</b> <b>crises</b> but also connects these crises to radical social and environmental movements, which must confront both political and economic institutions to bring about change. Until now, the theoretical foundation that the political economic opportunity structure (PEOS) uses to explain the perpetration of injustice has conditionally accepted ecological modernization theory and the classless notion of circularity described in risk theory. By constructively criticizing the theoretical foundation of the PEOS, this paper primarily emphasizes the class structure {{of the economic and}} <b>ecological</b> <b>crises</b> of capitalism as the context in which social and environmental movements exist...|$|R

Sustainability is viewed not as a domain exclusive to scientists, environmental activists, and business leaders but as a holistic project that must involve the whole of humanity redefining its place in Nature: [...] "What every environmentalist needs to know ... is that capitalism is not the solution but the problem, and that if humanity is going to survive this crisis, it will do so because it has exercised its capacity for human freedom, through social struggle, {{in order to create}} a whole new world—in coevolution with the planet." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ecopedagogy {{calls for}} the remaking of {{capitalist}} practices and seeks to re-engage democracy to include multispecies interests {{in the face of}} our current global <b>ecological</b> <b>crisis.</b> It does so by using different ideas that challenge the way we see education. [...] In Critical Pedagogy, Ecoliteracy and Planetary Crisis: The Ecopedagogy Movement, Richard Kahn (2010) reformulates Herbert Marcuse’s critical theories of society, and supports the kind of education that seizes the power of radical environmental activists and supports the earth democracy in which multispecies interests are represented. The destruction of habitats and threats to biodiversity resulting from expansion of human population and consumption is rarely addressed in a way that confronts students with the necessity to consider moral implications of such destruction. Pedagogically, a return to education associated with significant life experiences, such as hiking in wilderness areas as a youth; as well as strategically significant education, action competence, social learning, and variations and combinations of those and many other pedagogical approaches developed in the past 40 years. Some of these pedagogical approaches have been disputed—for example, the belief that experiencing environment first hand is an essential component of engaging people in conservation has been disputed by arguments that these education efforts have been informed by behaviorist socio-psychology models that assumed a linear causality between education experience and pro-environmental behavior. [...] Rather, the critics have argued that people’s environmental behaviors are too complex and contextually dependent to be captured by a simple casual model. The process of environmental education of schoolchildren has the following methodological characteristics: ...|$|E

30|$|Traditionalists {{believe that}} science and {{technology}} are able to compensate the environmental problems, which the TMA causes (Shafer 2006). But today, as we experienced, science cannot solve the <b>ecological</b> <b>crises</b> and these crises {{pose a threat to}} future generations. Cotgrove (1982) mentions that the roots of these <b>ecological</b> <b>crises</b> {{are to be found in}} the basics of TMA, which supports the unlimited growth and the domination of nature. The insufficiency of the current system in solving problems it causes, like holes in the ozone layer and global warming, puts the future of the human race at risk. These environmental crises have seriously weakened the comfortable assumptions about normal science and have led to the loss of the scientific certainty of old belief (Ravetz 2004). In this context, Funtowicz and Ravetz (1992, 1994) criticized normal science due to its nature that ignores environmental values and they propounded ecological economics as a post-normal science, which brings ecological issues into the center of business operations.|$|R
