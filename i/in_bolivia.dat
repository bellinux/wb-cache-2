5|$|Filmmaker Terrence Malick {{originally}} {{worked on}} a screenplay limited to Guevara's attempts to start a revolution <b>in</b> <b>Bolivia.</b> When financing fell through, Malick left the project, and Soderbergh subsequently agreed to direct the film. He {{realized that there was}} no context for Guevara's actions <b>in</b> <b>Bolivia</b> and decided that his participation in the Cuban Revolution and his appearance at the United Nations in 1964 should also be depicted. Peter Buchman was hired to write the screenplay: the script was so long that Soderbergh decided to divide the film into two parts, one chronicling Cuba and other depicting Bolivia. Soderbergh shot the installments back-to-back starting at the beginning of July 2007, with Guerrilla first in Spain for 39 days, and The Argentine shot in Puerto Rico and Mexico for 39 days.|$|E

5|$|The {{species is}} {{generally}} resident across its range, but sightings of solitary and silent birds {{have suggested that}} the species may be migratory <b>in</b> <b>Bolivia</b> and Brazil. A study published in 2005 suggested it was migratory in Santa Fe, Argentina, as the species was not observed in the area between March and September (the austral winter). In 2006 the species was reported {{for the first time in}} Peru, but it was unclear if this represented a vagrant escaping cold weather or a migrant, as the species is mostly uncommon across its range and that area is poorly studied ornithologically.|$|E
5|$|Upon his {{election}} to the presidency, Bolivia was South America's poorest nation. Morales' government did not initiate any fundamental change in Bolivia's economic structure, and in their National Development Plan (PDN) for 2006–10, they adhered largely to the country's previous liberal economic model. Bolivia's economy was based largely on the extraction of natural resources, with the nation having South America's second largest reserves of natural gas. As per {{his election}} pledge, Morales took increasing state control of this hydrocarbon industry with Supreme Decree 2870; previously, corporations paid 18% of their profits to the state, but Morales symbolically reversed this, so that 82% of profits went {{to the state and}} 18% to the companies. The oil companies threatened to take the case to the international courts or cease operating <b>in</b> <b>Bolivia,</b> but ultimately relented. Thus, where Bolivia had received $173 million from hydrocarbon extraction in 2002, by 2006 they received $1.3 billion. Although not technically a form of nationalization, Morales and his government referred to it as such, resulting in criticism from sectors of the Bolivian left. In June 2006, Morales announced his desire to nationalize mining, electricity, telephones, and railroads, and in February 2007 nationalized the Vinto metallurgy plant, refusing to compensate Glencore, which the government asserted had obtained the contract illegally. Although the FSTMB miners' federation called for the government to nationalise the mines, the government did not do so, instead stating that any transnational corporations operating <b>in</b> <b>Bolivia</b> legally would not be expropriated.|$|E
