5|$|By the 19th century, {{the tower}} was {{obscured}} by the surrounding buildings, and was accessed through the brick-built office in front of it, according to the antiquarian and engraver John Smith. The tower began to become too small for storing all the House of Lords' records, and from 1827 onwards only the acts, journals and minute-books were <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tower.|$|E

5|$|Mu'azzam's {{imprisonment}} was not severe, {{and indeed}} he was <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lap of luxury by his captors.

Shivaji's own son, Sambhaji, was at roughly the same time a prisoner of the Mughals.|$|E

5|$|The Japanese {{public and}} much of the {{military}} command structure were <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark about the extent of the defeat: Japanese news announced a great victory.
