5|$|The game's story follows Neku {{over the}} course of the three weeks that he plays the Game, paired with {{partners}} Shiki, Joshua, and Beat for each week, respectively. Neku is confused at first, lacking knowledge of how he died or how he arrived at the UG. As he develops friendships with his partners, he starts to understand the rules of the Game. After the first week, only Shiki is allowed to return to the living, and she promises to meet Neku at the statue of Hachiko. He also recovers his entry fee, which was his memories, except for the events leading up to his death. However, Shiki has become what Neku values most, and she is used as his new entry fee for the second week. During the second week he recalls small details of his death; eventually, <b>he</b> <b>recognizes</b> <b>that</b> he was shot at by Sho Minamimoto, one of the Reapers he faced during the Game. At the end of the second week, Joshua seemingly sacrifices himself to save Neku from an explosion created by Minamimoto.|$|E

25|$|Abortion: Badnarik {{personally}} opposes abortion, but {{believes that}} decisions regarding abortion rights {{should be made}} {{at the state and}} not the federal level. <b>He</b> <b>recognizes</b> <b>that</b> there is significant controversy surrounding when life begins, and argues that therefore the state should not legislate against abortion, since a fetus is arguably not a human life in and of its own.|$|E

25|$|Richard Wiseman, of The Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, draws {{attention}} to possible alternative explanations for perceived paranormal activity in his article, The Haunted Brain. While <b>he</b> <b>recognizes</b> <b>that</b> approximately 15% of people believe they have experienced an encounter with a ghost, he reports that only 1% report seeing a full-fledged ghost while the rest report strange sensory stimuli, such as seeing fleeting shadows or wisps of smoke, or the sensation of hearing footsteps or feeling a presence. Wiseman makes the claim that, rather than experiencing paranormal activity, it is activity within our own brains that creates these strange sensations.|$|E

25|$|The film {{begins with}} the {{unearthing}} of the Stargate in Giza in 1928. In a present day, i.e., 1994, military base in Creek Mountain, Colorado, discredited Egyptologist Daniel Jackson (James Spader) enables use of the Stargate when <b>he</b> <b>recognizes</b> <b>that</b> symbols on the cover stones of the Stargate are asterisms used in a three dimensional coordinate system. A team led by Colonel Jack O'Neil (Kurt Russell) is ordered to step through the Stargate and identify potential military threats on the other side. Jackson accompanies them to operate the other Stargate with {{his knowledge of the}} coordinate system. The team discovers a slave civilization serving an alien who is posing as the Egyptian god Ra (Jaye Davidson). Ra and his minions have taken human form, dominating the slaves with brute force. With the help of the locals, O'Neil's team is eventually able to instigate a slave rebellion, overwhelming Ra's forces. Ra escapes in his mothership, but O'Neil is able to teleport a nuclear warhead on-board Ra's ship in orbit and detonate it. With Ra dead, the civilization can live in peace; O'Neil and his team return home through the Stargate, but Daniel Jackson stays on the planet with a young local woman named Sha'uri.|$|E
500|$|Despite such criticisms, {{some social}} activist groups remain optimistic that Speakers' Corner {{represents}} a step towards political liberalization {{and the promise}} of a wider political space. Although Dr. Kenneth Paul Tan, Assistant Dean of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, has noted that initial cynicism was inevitable as Speakers' Corner was a top-down initiative, <b>he</b> <b>recognizes</b> <b>that</b> civil society activists have since actively occupied and made use of Speakers' Corner to generate public interest in various social and political issues. This view is shared by Professor Bilveer Singh, a political science analyst at the National University of Singapore, who has pointed to large turnouts at events organized at Speakers' Corner as evidence that Singaporeans are [...] "not fearful and not politically apathetic." ...|$|E
500|$|Five years later, the Smoking Man {{writes a}} novel {{entitled}} Take a Chance: A Jack Colquitt Adventure, using the pen name [...] "Raul Bloodworth". After hearing Martin Luther King, Jr. {{give a speech}} criticizing America's attitude towards the distribution of wealth at home and social revolutions abroad, the Smoking Man meets {{with a group of}} men, including J. Edgar Hoover. Unlike most of the men present, the Smoking Man admires King's principles and perseverance, but <b>he</b> <b>recognizes</b> <b>that,</b> as King grows more popular, his idealism might undermine American involvement in the Vietnam War and other military activities. He thus convinces the group to have King assassinated and volunteers to perform the task. Shortly thereafter, a publishing company rejects his novel.|$|E

2500|$|Baptist theologian Roger Nicole, {{considered}} {{an expert in}} Calvinism, is a Christian Egalitarian and a Biblical Inerrantist. <b>He</b> <b>recognizes</b> <b>that</b> biblical egalitarianism is still viewed by many as inconsistent with biblical inerrancy, although he disagrees. He writes that [...] "the matter of the place {{of women in the}} home, in society, and in the church is not an issue that can be conclusively determined by a few apparently restrictive passages that are often advanced by those who think that subordination represents God’s will for women." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lin {{tries not}} to be overly {{judgmental}} of the characters because <b>he</b> <b>recognizes</b> <b>that</b> too many issues {{were involved in the}} chaotic years of the early twentieth century China. There are no absolutely right or wrong characters. Each character held a piece of truth and reality and a piece of irrationality. In the preface, Lin writes that [...] " [...] is merely a story of... how certain habits of living and ways of thinking are formed and how, above all, [...] adjust themselves to the circumstances in this earthly life where men strive but gods rule." ...|$|E
2500|$|A third {{interpretation}} {{is that an}} action might be considered a complex action consisting of several stages {{and it is the}} intention that determines which of these stages are to be considered part of the action. Although this is the interpretation favoured by Dancy, <b>he</b> <b>recognizes</b> <b>that</b> this might not have been Mill's own view, for Mill [...] "would not even allow that 'p & q' expresses a complex proposition. He wrote in his System of Logic I iv. 3, of 'Caesar is dead and Brutus is alive', that 'we might as well call a street a complex house, as these two propositions a complex proposition'." ...|$|E

He now sees that the infected view him with the same hatred and fear that he once felt for the vampires; he realizes that he, a remnant of old humanity, is now a legend to the new race born of the infection: [...] Just as vampires are monsters that hunt humans {{during the time of}} day they are not active (night), he is a feared monster that hunts the vampires during the daylight hours when they are asleep. <b>He</b> <b>recognizes</b> <b>that</b> their desire to kill him is not something he can condemn.

2500|$|In response, Kellner {{continues}} {{to examine the}} repercussions of understanding {{the effects of the}} September 11 attacks. He questions if the attacks are only able to be understood in a limited form of postmodern theory due to the level of irony. In further studies, he enhances the idea of semiotics in alignment with the theory. Similar to the act of September 11 and the symbols that were interpreted through this postmodern ideal, he {{continues to}} even describe this as [...] "semiotic systems" [...] that people use to make sense of their lives and the events that occur in them. Kellner's [...] that signs are necessary to understand one's culture is what he analyzes from the evidence that most cultures have used signs in place of existence. Finally, <b>he</b> <b>recognizes</b> <b>that</b> many theorists of postmodernism are trapped by their own cogitations. He finds strength in theorist Baudrillard and his idea of Marxism. Kellner acknowledges Marxism's end and lack of importance to his theory.|$|E
2500|$|Carl D. Atkins insinuates {{that the}} final quatrain of Shakespeare's Sonnet 73 is the final stage in which youth disappears forever. [...] "As the fire goes out when the wood which has been feeding it is consumed, so is life {{extinguished}} when the strength of youth is past". He compares the burning fire that slowly {{goes out to the}} passing away of life, as old age prevails youth. Shakespeare is concerned with the reality of death, [...] "the fading out of life's energy". He realizes that what he has [...] "nourished" [...] but must now [...] "expire". [...] "The ashes of his youth doth lie" [...] –the ashes of his youth burn brightly, as <b>he</b> <b>recognizes</b> <b>that</b> what brightened up his youth is devoured by the fire burning away his old age. As a result, Shakespeare informs his audience that we must [...] "love more strongly", because in the end, we are going to leave it all behind and respond to death.|$|E
