25|$|The Hewlett Packard HP 9830 {{was one of}} {{the first}} desktop {{computers}} in the early 1970s to use automatically controlled cassette tapes for storage. It could save and find files by number, using a clear leader to detect the end of tape. These would be replaced by specialized cartridges, such as the 3M DC-series. Many of the earliest microcomputers implemented the <b>Kansas</b> <b>City</b> <b>standard</b> for digital data storage. Most home computers of the late 1970s and early 1980s could use cassettes for data storage as a cheaper alternative to floppy disks, though users often had to manually stop and start a cassette recorder. Even the first version of the IBM PC of 1981 had a cassette port and a command in its ROM BASIC programming language to use it. However, IBM cassette tape was seldom used, as by 1981 floppy drives had become commonplace in high-end machines.|$|E

50|$|During {{investigation}} {{after the}} walkway collapse, architectural engineer Wayne G. Lischka noticed a substantial alteration {{of the original}} design. The fabricator constructed a double-rod support system rather than the originally designed single-rod system without approval of the engineering design team.

It was documented that even the single-rod system would have barely supported the expected load and would not have met <b>Kansas</b> <b>City</b> Building Code <b>standards.</b>|$|R
