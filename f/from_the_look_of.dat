500|$|Animation for {{the film}} began in January 2006, with the Itchy & Scratchy short being the first scene to be storyboarded. Groening {{rejected}} making either a live-action or a CGI film, calling the film's animation [...] "deliberately imperfect" [...] and [...] "a tribute {{to the art of}} hand-drawn animation". The film was produced in a widescreen [...] aspect ratio, to distinguish it <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>of</b> the television series, and colored with the largest palette the animators had ever had available to them. A lot of the animation was produced using Wacom Cintiq tablets, which allowed images to be drawn directly onto a computer monitor to facilitate production. Animation production work was divided among four studios around the world: Film Roman in Burbank, California, Rough Draft Studios in Glendale, California, and AKOM and Rough Draft's division in Seoul, South Korea. As with the television series, the storyboarding, characters, background layout, and animatic parts of production, were done in America. The overseas studios completed the inbetweening, digital ink and paint, and rendered the animation to tape before being shipped back to the United States.|$|E
500|$|The downtempo {{song was}} {{developed}} {{on the following}} day, with Madonna writing the lyrics and Leonard composing the melody. Named [...] "The Look of Love", the song contains the line [...] "No where to run, no place to hide. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>of</b> love, from the eyes of pride". Madonna {{was inspired by the}} look that actor James Stewart gave actress Grace Kelly in the 1954 film Rear Window. Madonna said: [...] "I can't describe it, but that is the way I want someone to look at me when he loves me. It's the most pure look of love and adoration. Like surrender. It's devastating." [...] After [...] "The Look of Love", Madonna went on to develop two further songs with Bray as the producer. The first was called [...] "Causing a Commotion", and was inspired by Penn and the couple's often tumultuous relationship. Madonna felt that her marriage to Penn {{was on the verge of}} breaking-up, due to Penn's abusive and violent nature. In a Rolling Stone article dated September 10, 1987, Madonna spoke about Penn's impact on her life and the song: [...] "I don't like violence. I never condone hitting anyone, and I never thought that any violence should have taken place. But on the other hand, I understood Sean's anger and believe me, I have wanted to hit him many times. I never would you know, because I realize that it would just make things worse. [...] I felt like he was 'Causing a Commotion' to purposefully distract me. I wrote this song and vented my frustration in it." [...] The last song developed was [...] "Can't Stop", a track inspired by Sixties Motown and the group Martha and the Vandellas. In addition to this, the album also included tracks by some acts on Warner Bros. Records, namely Club Nouveau, Scritti Politti and Michael Davidson. Commercially unsuccessful and unknown in the US, these groups needed a platform to project their songs, and including them in a Madonna album seemed like the right thing to do for Warner. Two tracks by Duncan Faure and Coati Mundi were included on the soundtrack at the request of Madonna since they were her friends. Despite her only performing four of the nine tracks on the album, Who's That Girl was marketed as a Madonna album, with only her face and name appearing on the cover art.|$|E

2500|$|The Valiant {{was less}} radical in {{configuration}} than General Motors' compact Chevrolet Corvair, {{which had a}}n air-cooled rear-mounted engine, but was considered more aesthetically daring than the also-new Falcon which had a more conventional look; the Valiant boasted a radical design that continued Exner's Forward Look styling with [...] "sleek, crisp lines which flow forward in a dart or wedge shape." [...] The flush-sided appearance was a carried-over feature from Chrysler's Ghia-built D'Elegance and Adventurer concept cars which also gave the Valiant additional inches of interior room. With its semi-fastback and lengthy hood line, many automotive publications of the time thought the Valiant's styling was European inspired. While the Valiant was all new, specific design elements tied it to other contemporary Chrysler products. Features such as the canted tailfins tipped with cat's-eye shaped tail lamps and the simulated spare tire pressing (or continental tire) on the deck lid were thematically similar to those on the Imperial and the 300F. According to Exner, the stamped wheel design was used not only to establish identity with other Chryslers, but to [...] "dress up the rear deck area without detracting <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>of</b> directed forward motion." ...|$|E

50|$|Jains make {{considerable}} efforts not {{to injure}} plants {{in everyday life}} as far as possible. Jains only accept such violence inasmuch as it is indispensable for human survival, and there are special instructions for preventing unnecessary violence against plants. Strict Jains don’t eat root vegetables such as potatoes, onions, roots and tubers, because such root vegetables are considered ananthkay. Ananthkay means one body, but containing countless lives. A regular vegetable such as cabbage has number of leaves and lives as could be counted by a layman. However, a root vegetable such as potato, though <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>looks</b> <b>of</b> it is one article, is said to contain multiple lives ('ekindriya') in it. Also, tiny life forms are injured when the plant is pulled up and because the bulb {{is seen as a}} living being, as it is able to sprout.

The pharaoh mask in the opening credits was made out of fiber glass and was modeled in the workshop. The sequence was filmed with a motion-control camera to give a better depth of field. The film was originally planned to play out in a chronological order, but when Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich edited the film to tighten the narrative, they decided to change the first scene of the film into a flashback to show who the human host of Ra was before the aliens took him. <b>The</b> Jaffa (<b>from</b> Stargate SG-1) <b>look</b> in <b>the</b> series was copied <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Egyptian <b>look</b> <b>of</b> Ra <b>from</b> <b>the</b> film. <b>The</b> <b>look</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Goa'uld, such as Apophis, was initially based on Ra in the feature film.|$|R

How have 21 st-century technologies required us to redefine terms like “original,” “musical,” and “expressive,” even further than the collage, détournement, cut-up, re-contextualization, and sampling of the 20 th century?
