Examples include: Five <b>Finger</b> <b>Grass,</b> Dragon Blood Sticks, Dixie Love Perfume and Brimstone. Explanations in a 1946 book said that Five <b>Finger</b> <b>Grass</b> was a leaf split into five sections. The belief was that if hung in one’s house, it would ward off any evil. Dragon Blood Sticks were said to bring good luck in money, business, and love. Keeping a stick close on a person was said to bring luck. Dixie Love Perfume was noted for a fragrance to encourage romance. Brimstone is used to keep away evil spirits and counteract spells cast on households, and was burned in rooms needing to be deodorized. These were traditionally available in local shops.|$|E

Pangola is a stoloniferous {{perennial}} and when established, it spreads rapidly by stolons. It {{does not produce}} viable seeds. Stems are up to 120  cm high. The leaves are linear-lanceolate to linear, 10 to 25  cm long and 2 to 7  mm wide. The inflorescence has one to two whorls with 5 to 10 spikes that are up to 13  cm long each, with many spikelets 2.70 to 3.00  mm long (Bogdan 1977). Optimal growth conditions are annual precipitations ranging from 700 to 4000  mm, temperatures from 15.9 to 27.8 °C and soil pH from 4.30 to 8.50 (Duke 1983), indicating adaptability {{to a wide range}} of environmental conditions.|$|E

40|$|In {{reproductive}} swards, stems {{can act as}} {{a barrier}} that affects the grazing behaviour of ruminant livestock. The barrier effect of stems is closely associated with both the force required to fracture the stems and the density of these stems (in combination, these make up grazing resistance), and these factors need to be considered when making predictions about the forage intake of ruminants grazing reproductive pastures. Differences in grazing resistance between sward canopy layers of different grass species are thought to affect bite dimensions, but data are scarce. In this study, we assessed the grazing resistance for three canopy layers of seven tropical grass species. Species differed significantly in grazing resistance for every canopy layer, with a general ranking order for grazing resistance, in ascending order: Cenchrus ciliaris (‘American' buffel), Digitaria milanjiana (‘Jarra’ <b>finger</b> <b>grass),</b> Setaria surgens (annual pigeon grass), Setaria sphacelata (‘Narok’ setaria), Dichanthium sericeum (Queensland bluegrass), Chloris gayana (‘Callide’ Rhodes grass). In the top canopy layer, grazing resistance did not appear to create a barrier for any of the species, but in the bottom canopy layer, it did for all species. Species also differed in the relative contribution of fracture force and density to grazing resistance. The results highlight the importance of managing the grazing systems to minimize the barrier effect of the stems, which can be done by controlling the phenological stage of the pasture and the grass species and animal size used in the system...|$|E

In experiment 1, ten multi-parous does were allocated to intensive management following kidding. Does were hand-milked twice weekly and the {{milk production}} recorded. Body weight changes of dam and kid, milk fat, milk solid were determined weekly over 12 weeks period. The average birth weight of the Sahelian (2. 2 ± 0. 23 kg) was significantly (p 0. 05) in daily milk yield and total lactation between the two breeds. The total solids and milk fat of 16. 4 ± 0. 39 and 3. 7 ± 0. 13 % were significantly (p< 0. 05) higher for the Red Sokoto than the Sahelian (15. 1 ± 0. 39 and 3. 2 ± 0. 13 %). The second trial was to evaluate the comparative growth of the Sahelian and Red Sokoto breeds of goats. Animals were group-fed based on sex and fed Digitaria smutsii hay supplemented with concentrate. The growth trial lasted for 150 days with a 14 day digestibility trial. The Average Daily Gain (ADG) were significantly (p< 0. 05) different for breed, as well as sex. The Red Sokoto (66. 9 ± 1. 59) kids had higher ADG than the Sahelian (46. 6 ± 1. 59). Similarly the males of the Red Sokoto (61. 9 ± 1. 59) had higher ADG than the Sahelian males (46. 7 ± 0. 59) and the females of both breed. The experiments demonstrated a linear increase in weight gains of Red Sokoto over the Sahelian and a slightly higher milk yield obtained from the Sahelian providing the basis {{to conclude that the}} Sahelian goat can adapted and fit into the production systems of Sudan Savannah rural farmers...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Environmental Science and Management)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. Restoration and {{rehabilitation}} activities are presently {{considered to be}} a major priority in environmental management, whether the activity implies the restoration of neglected cultivated pastures or degraded rangelands due to overgrazing and climatic impacts, or the rehabilitation of the mining and industrial areas. However, the goals are not easily achieved, mainly due to the high input costs, including that of re-seeding activities. Reseeding success is influenced by the quality and effectiveness of the used seed regarding germination and establishment under natural field conditions. If techniques can be developed to enhance the effectiveness of germination and establishment percentage of the seed in restoration {{and rehabilitation}} sites, a better cover, density and biomass yield can be expected, which will improve the rehabilitation process. It is known that commercially available grass seed has a better germination percentage and establishment percentage in comparison with seed locally harvested, which may include many impurities such as sticks and stones. The availability of the locally harvested seed types, especially of certain ecotypes adapted to specific environments, can be poor. Advance Seed Company (Krugersdorp, South Africa) has taken commercially available grass seed to the next level by enhancing (coating) the seed with a multitude of different treatments to ensure better handling of the seed in reseeding applications. These treatments also have advantages such as a higher seed to soil contact, growth stimulants included in the treatment, higher seed purity and the protection of the seed against predation by ants and other insects and against harsh chemicals in the soil, which might have an influence on the germination percentage of the seed and the establishment of seedlings. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate whether or not certain enhanced grass seed types of selected grass species will have a better germination and establishment percentage, fresh and dry above-(leaves) and below-ground (root) biomass yield (glasshouse trials) and dry above-ground biomass yields (natural fields trials) in comparison with non-enhanced types. The predation of enhanced and non-enhanced seeds by ants and other insects, as well as the development of the vascular tissue in the transitional region of the seedlings was also investigated. The grasses assessed included enhanced and non-enhanced seed types of Chloris gayana (Rhodes grass), Cynodon dactylon (Couch grass), Digitaria eriantha (Common <b>finger</b> <b>grass)</b> and Eragrostis curvula (Weeping love grass). In the case of E. curvula, four seed types, including the non-enhanced seed type were tested. These included non-enhanced seed, seed treated with "plain coat", enhancement with "organic insecticide on the base of the coaf' (Le. insecticide between the enhancement and the seed) and enhancement with "organic insecticide on the base of the coat and as an overspray" (Le. insecticide between the enhancement and the seed, as well as spraying the insecticide over the coated seed). The above mentioned species are commonly used in grass seed mixtures for rehabilitation and restoration purposes. Seeds were supplied by Advance Seed Company. The seed enhancement treatments as well as the non-enhanced seed types were tested under various conditions. The chemical composition of the enhancement treatment used in the coating process is only known by the seed technicians at Advance Seed Company. All the seed supplied by the seed merchant had a purity of > 95 %. With the application of dormancy breaking in the germination tests the non-enhanced seed types of Chloris gayana had the higher germination percentage of the seed type or the same species. Other differences included the germination percentage being significantly higher for the enhanced seed type of Cynodon dactylon than the non-enhanced seed type. Lower germination percentages were noted in the comparison of the E. curvula seed types, were the non-enhanced seed type had a higher germination percentage in comparison with the enhanced seed types. In the germination tests without dormancy breaking being applied, these results differ. With regard to the establishment percentages, similar statistical differences were noted in both the Coco Peat Moss medium and the Hygromix growth medium. In the above-and below-ground biomass production trials in the glass house the only significant difference were noted in the biomass production of D. eriantha plants. In the case of the dry above-and below-ground biomass yield the plants of the non-enhanced seed types of D. eriantha yielded a significantly higher biomass in comparison with the plants harvested from the enhanced seed type of the same species. With regard to the natural field trials a few significant differences were noted. The results indicated that the enhanced seed types of Chloris gayana and Cynodon dactylon, the non-enhanced seed type of D. eriantha as well as the non-enhanced and "organic insecticide on base and as overspray" enhancement of E cUNula can be used in re-seeding restoration and rehabilitation practices. Eragrostis cUNula enhanced with "plain coat" is not recommended to be used for re-seeding in disturbed areas. Master...|$|E

The girl had a native name, but Red called her Sally. He picked up the easy language very quickly, {{and he used to}} lie on the mat for hours while she chattered gaily to him. He was a silent fellow, and perhaps his mind was lethargic. He smoked incessantly the cigarettes which she made him out of the native tobacco and pandanus leaf, and he watched her while with deft <b>fingers</b> she made <b>grass</b> mats. Often natives would come in and tell long stories of the old days when the island was disturbed by tribal wars. Sometimes he would go fishing on the reef, and bring home a basket full of coloured fish. Sometimes at night he would go out with a lantern to catch lobster. There were plantains round the hut and Sally would roast them for their frugal meal. She knew how to make delicious messes from coconuts, and the bread-fruit tree {{by the side of the}} creek gave them its fruit. On feast-days they killed a little pig and cooked it on hot stones. They bathed together in the creek; and in the evening they went down to the lagoon and paddled about in a dugout, with its great outrigger. The sea was deep blue, wine-coloured at sundown, like the sea of Homeric Greece; but in the lagoon the colour had an infinite variety, aquamarine and amethyst and emerald; and the setting sun turned it for a short moment to liquid gold. Then there was the colour of the coral, brown, white, pink, red, purple; and the shapes it took were marvellous. It was like a magic garden, and the hurrying fish were like butterflies. It strangely lacked reality. Among the coral were pools with a floor of white sand and here, where the water was dazzling clear, it was very good to bathe. Then, cool and happy, they wandered back in the gloaming over the soft grass road to the creek, walking hand in hand, and now the mynah birds filled the coconut trees with their clamour. And then the night, with that great, sky shining with gold, that seemed to stretch more widely than the skies of Europe, and the soft airs that blew gently through the open hut, the long night again was all too short. She was sixteen and he was barely twenty. The dawn crept in among the wooden pillars of the hut and looked at those lovely children sleeping in one another's arms. The sun hid behind the great tattered leaves of the plantains so that it might not disturb them, and then, with playful malice, shot a golden ray, like the outstretched paw of a Persian cat, on their faces. They opened their sleepy eyes and they smiled to welcome another day. The weeks lengthened into months, and a year passed. They seemed to love one another as--I hesitate to say passionately, for passion has in it always a shade of sadness, a touch of bitterness or anguish, but as whole heartedly, as simply and naturally as on that first day on which, meeting, they had recognised that a god was in them." ...|$|R
