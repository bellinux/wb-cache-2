Unless you really saw the country that they were caught up in and also felt the weight of the herd and what the herd does to {{decision}} making. The fact that these are all tiny characters caught up in a bad landscape may not sound very controversial but when you're dealing with a venue like the small screen that is contrary to what a lot of guys perceive to be good form. A lot of people say you the way to deal with it is to accommodate the reality of it and play it closer and more intimately. But I <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> were going to lose a lot if you did that and I really did feel {{that you were going to}} know the characters so I wasn't going to cheat them but I wanted to put them in a big landscape. One scene he is most proud of occurs when Church's character has to put one of the horses down by shooting it after it hurts its leg.|$|E
5000|$|When {{the family}} tries an anger {{management}} technique of writing letters and not sending them, Meg finds Peter's letter to her, which says, [...] "Dear Meg, {{for the first}} four years of your life, I thought you were a house cat." [...] And in Peter's short story of her birth, they {{had to go back to}} get her once they realized they grabbed the afterbirth. In the episode [...] "Stewie Kills Lois", Peter tells guests on a cruise ship about how he and Lois had gone to get an abortion but decided against it when they arrived at the clinic and found out the abortionist had one hand. He then says [...] "two and a half months later, our daughter Meg was born" [...] - indicating that they had tried to abort her when Lois was already over six months pregnant. Another hint to this is when Meg is in the car with Lois and at an attempt to make civilized conversation, says, [...] "Hey Meg, did you know that if you're on birth control and you take an antibiotic it makes it not work? 'Cause no one told me! I <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> should know" [...] and laughs awkwardly. On Meg's 17th birthday, her mother and father both try to hide from Meg that they do not remember her age. Peter openly states that Meg sucks in the episode [...] "PTV", and Chris says the same thing about her in [...] "Long John Peter". In [...] "Not All Dogs Go to Heaven", Brian says to Meg's face that she lives in a home [...] "where nobody respects or cares about her, not even enough to get her a damn mumps shot!" [...] Chris, however, seems to have more of a typical brother-sister relationship with Meg. Although they fight and argue from time to time, he tends to go to her for advice. Chris even once threatened to quit his job if his boss didn't re-hire Meg (at the insistence of Lois). Like Chris, Meg has an anthropomorphic monkey in her closet, and although she has proved it, her family coldly state that they were talking about Chris', not hers. Cleveland comments to Peter [...] "Meg is my least favorite of your children." ...|$|E

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with the music site [...] "ireallylovemusic", James Murphy (the leader of the group) explained his inspiration for the song: When I was DJing, playing Can, Liquid Liquid, ESG, all that kind of stuff, I became kind of cool for a moment, which was a total anomaly. And when I heard other DJs playing similar music I was like: 'Fuck! I'm out of a job! These are my records!' But it was like someone had crept into my brain and said all these words that I hate. Did I make the records? Did I fuck! So, I started becoming horrified by my own attitude. I had this moment of glory though. People would use me to DJ just to get them cool. They'd be like 'It's the cool rock disco guy' and this was really weird. And to be honest I was afraid that this new found coolness was going to go away and that's where ''''Losing My Edge'''' comes from. It is about being horrified by my own silliness. And then it became a wider thing about people who grip onto other people's creations like they are their own. There is a lot of pathos in that character though because it's born out of inadequacy and love. James Murphy In another interview, Murphy elaborated further on the birth and the release of the song:So I started going to different types of things and meeting different people, and started throwing parties. And all of a sudden, I was kind of cool, I'd always just been a total... not even an outsider, just sort of a nobody, a sort of invisible, sad and kind of shy. And all of a sudden I was DJing, and felt cool, throwing parties. And then one night I went to go see a band, and somebody else was playing the records that I was playing. Nobody else was playing the records that I was playing, that was sort of my thing! And I got really mad, and I got really defensive. And I was like 'What the heck, that's mine! What the--who the hell is this? Some 22-year-old...', and I got really embarassed sic? by being like 'These aren't your records, you didn't write them, you just... play them, you just own them, you can't be proud of yourself for owning them' but I was mad at the same time because I was like 'I know that kid was at one of my parties...'. It was this really dense conflict that I couldn't resolve, and that's where ''''Losing My Edge'''' came from. I didn't have a good answer. I was angry, but I was also pathetic for being angry. There wasn't really a right or wrong, you know? I was right and wrong, and this kid was right and wrong, and everybody there was right and wrong. It felt really dense, and really easy to write from. Easy to make something from. So I made that song, and everybody thought it was terrible. I remember playing it to people, and they'd give you this face (makes a face of surprise and doubt), you know, when they don't want to say anything! And they'd ask me about technical stuff like 'Oh, what are the drums?' and I was like 'OK, you don't like this'. And Phil Mossman, who was the original LCD guitar player, was the only person that was like 'I love this, I really love this, it's very funny'. So we put it out, and the people from the label, my two partners Tim and Jonathan afterwards said 'We <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> were making a big mistake, you're gonna look like an idiot, and we just feel bad for you'. It was the B-side to 'Beat Connection' until the last minute. I thought 'No, that should be the A-side, that should be the one I should sink or swim with.|$|E
40|$|Translation begins] Thursday My Darling, Hope {{that this}} doesn’t get too blurred. But I just washed {{my hair and}} it’s {{dripping}} all over the place. Your letter came that you wrote last Sunday. Golly, honey, I hope March 11 th isn’t rainy too. My hair will look horid [sic] if it does. Right now I’m half listening to Suspense- very confusing. I always pick the nicest atmosphere to write to you, honey- very romantic! I guess that the train is just as slow as the bus, honey. We’ll stay in Atlanta Thursday night probably. So it’s hard to get hotel rooms, huh, honey? Well- that’s a minor detail, we can always find a nice park bench someplace. Honey, that’s the way I always wear my hair- parted {{on the side and}} flat on top- [?] when you were home, that’s the only time I changed it. Everyone else likes it this way, honey. Listen, Judson Clark- will you please answer my question about the Scotch? First- how many bottles {{do you want me to}} buy? And which is better- Pinch bottle or Johnny Walker? You’ve been avoiding my question about Steve. Is there anything wrong between you and sweetie? You never mention him? I’ve been asking and asking you if he was going to be able to arrive by two and if he was very far away. Those are the only two questions that I can think of off hand but if you don’t answer me so help me there’ll be a private war. Especially about the Scotch. Where are the other places that are more convenient? We should go to Mexico or someplace on the way. Of course Mexico is probably millions of miles away. But, how long will we be able to stay wherever we go? You said you wanted to go swimming but I don’t know. If we don’t have more than four or five days it wouldn’t make much difference to me- Remember? Yes, I guess I want you to be boss- I don’t know whether you will be or not. I’ve got a pretty strong mind of my own- All right so you’ll be an officer. There are plenty of other officers- and and [sic] you’ll take orders when necessary! So I’ll be a Colonel! I’m glad that you’re getting the rings. I’d never get it done. Never have time to look. If you like them, honey, I’m sure I will- You have such good taste. You’ll always have to buy my jewelry. Well, I wasn’t exactly trying to discourage you, honey, just sorta preparing you and letting you know what you’re getting in for. But, honey, we’ve got to eat. Golly, I just hate to think of what’s going to happen. You’re going to be awfully hungry. I hope after we’ve been married a while you still feel the same way. I’m not worrying at all about it but everyone else is- All you hear is “Poor Juddie”- Everyone is sure that I’m going to starve you to death or something horrible. Probably kill you from cooking- I’m definitely not the domestic type. Which is the best Johnny Walker, red or black? Well, honey all the articles I’ve read in magazines say that religion is terribly important and since we’re not religious, honey, I was wondering what would happen. I’m not worrying about it at all. I <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> might like to worry about it. Everyone else seems to think things like that are important. Golly, honey, when we get married it will be the first time I’ve been in a church all this year! That’s awful. Yes, honey, I’m sure it will work out fine- But the experts all disagree. We’ll show them. Well, you see, I read anything that comes along + lately they’re publishing lots of stuff on war marriages and what makes them last + not last. I agree about the only way we can find out if it will work is by trying it. I’m not worried in the least but I want you to be sure that you’ve considered all angles. What a waste of time! Why can’t March hurry. Gee, honey, the way time drags you’d thing we had all year or something. Oh, happy day- (day after Valentine’s day but we got paid today. Tomorrow at noon I’ll take my huge check over to the bank. Hope they have enough money to cover it. (Is that what they do with checks?) Someone’s singing “There Goes That Song Again”. Gee, I miss you so, honey. Golly the time’s getting shorter. Only 24 more days now and we’ll be married, honey. As you’ve probably gathered by now I’m in a very wacky mood and if this letter makes sense it’s purely coincidental. Remember that night at Split Rock when you were getting decoldized- (new word!) Woody and Steve were ready to murder me- I always get wacky at the most inappropriate times. Golly, hone in eleven more days I’ll be all finished working. That’s eleven weekdays. Weekends don’t count. There are times when I dislike everything about that place but then other times I don’t mind it at all. I still feel real patriotic and everything. I don’t know whether I’ll be able to go back to modeling again. It’s so unessential. “To Have And Have Not” is at the movies this weekend. I can hardly wait to see it. Lauren Bacall is in it. I like her a lot. Won’t be able to see it until Monday night though. Tomorrow night I’m not going out. I’ll be a good little girl and write to you for a change. Forgot to buy some envelopes again. Oh well, maybe tomorrow I’ll remember. Gee, honey, I wish these 24 days would hurry. Have you found out about when the graduation dance will be? Can you get Charlotte a date? I should carry a pad + pencil around with me always so that when I think of something to ask you I could write it down and then remember- whenever I begin to write, always forget. Let’s see honey, what else was there that I wanted to ask you. Oh, how many hours have you flown now? Are ya still ahead of everyone? Are you still highest in your class or don’t you know? Gee, in about 14 more days you should know what you’re going to be. That’s 10 days before graduation. I’ll probably have pneumonia if I don’t dry my hair soon. It’s still all wet. Gee, honey, it will be so queer to be married. Since I’ve never been married before, I think it will be queer anyway. But being married to you will be wonderful, darling. Last Sunday seems months away. This week went so fast in a way but in another way it seems as if it had been going on forever. Oh, tomorrow’s Friday- I like Fridays. Honey, will we go on our honeymoon right after we’re married or what? Do you get the 15 days right away. No, don’t tell me that. But where are we going? Let’s not go where it’s rainy- that would be very wetish and – wait a minute- that wouldn’t be so bad- It would be very romantic. Remember that day we walked in the rain, honey. That sure was a long time ago. Well, my darling, I guess I’d better dry my hair and take a bath and get to bed. I love you more than anything else in the world. You’re so sweet, honey, how can anyone be so wonderful. Well, honey, until we’re together again, I’ll love you, Always, Dottie P. S. Please answer my questions!!! [Translation ends...|$|E
