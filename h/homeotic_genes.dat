5|$|The field {{grew from}} 19th century beginnings, where {{embryology}} faced a mystery: zoologists {{did not know}} how embryonic development was controlled at the molecular level. Charles Darwin noted that having similar embryos implied common ancestry, but little progress was made until the 1970s. Then, recombinant DNA technology at last brought embryology together with molecular genetics. A key early discovery was of <b>homeotic</b> <b>genes</b> that regulate development {{in a wide range of}} eukaryotes.|$|E

25|$|Manatees are unusual amongst mammals in {{possessing}} {{just six}} cervical vertebrae, {{which may be}} due to mutations in the <b>homeotic</b> <b>genes.</b> All other mammals have seven cervical vertebrae, other than the two-toed and three-toed sloths.|$|E
50|$|Multicellular {{systems are}} {{composed}} {{of more than one}} <b>homeotic</b> <b>gene.</b> Each <b>homeotic</b> <b>gene</b> in this system puts together a different combination of sub-expression trees or ADFs, creating multiple cells or main programs.|$|R
40|$|We have {{analysed}} <b>homeotic</b> <b>gene</b> {{expression in}} the embryonic visceral mesoderm of segmentation mutants by antibody staining against Ultrabithorax, Antennapedia and Sex combs reduced protein. We found that even-skipped (eve) function is crucially required for <b>homeotic</b> <b>gene</b> expression, whereas most other segmentation mutations have only minor effects on position and/or width of the homeotic expression domains in this germ layer. Analysis of pair-rule double mutants indicates that complete loss of <b>homeotic</b> <b>gene</b> activity in the visceral mesoderm, as observed in amorphic eve mutants, correlates with loss of engrailed (en) {{expression in the}} epidermis and loss of segmentation. We suggest that the establishment of parasegment borders, a consequence of eve expression and witnessed by subsequent en expression, is a necessary precondition for <b>homeotic</b> <b>gene</b> expression in the visceral mesoderm...|$|R

25|$|The {{methodology}} for studying flower development involves two steps. Firstly, {{the identification of}} the exact genes required for determining the identity of the floral meristem. In A. thaliana these include APETALA1 (AP1) and LEAFY (LFY). Secondly, genetic analysis is carried out on the aberrant phenotypes for the relative characteristics of the flowers, which allows the characterization of the <b>homeotic</b> <b>genes</b> implicated in the process.|$|E
25|$|In 1977, {{recombinant}} DNA technology enabled biologists {{to start}} to explore the genetic control of development. The growth of evolutionary developmental biology from 1978, when Edward B. Lewis discovered <b>homeotic</b> <b>genes,</b> showed that many so-called toolkit genes act to regulate development, influencing the expression of other genes. It also revealed {{that some of the}} regulatory genes are extremely ancient, so that animals as different as insects and mammals share control mechanisms; for example, the Pax6 gene is involved in forming the eyes of mice and of fruit flies. Such deep homology provided strong evidence for evolution and indicated the paths that evolution had taken.|$|E
25|$|The {{fact that}} these <b>homeotic</b> <b>genes</b> {{determine}} an organ’s identity becomes evident when a gene that represents a particular function, for example the A gene, is not expressed. In Arabidopsis this loss results in a flower which is composed of one verticil of carpels, another containing stamens and another of carpels. This method for studying gene function uses reverse genetics techniques to produce transgenic plants that contain a mechanism for gene silencing through RNA interference. In other studies, using forward genetics techniques such as genetic mapping, it is {{the analysis of the}} phenotypes of flowers with structural anomalies that leads to the cloning of the gene of interest. The flowers may possess a non-functional or over expressed allele for the gene being studied.|$|E
40|$|Mutations in the <b>homeotic</b> <b>gene</b> agamous of {{the plant}} Arabidopsis cause the {{transformation}} of the floral sex organs. Cloning and sequence analysis of agamous suggest that it encodes a protein {{with a high degree of}} sequence similarity to the DNA-binding region of transcription factors from yeast and humans and to the product of a <b>homeotic</b> <b>gene</b> from Antirrhinum. The agamous gene therefore probably encodes a transcription factor that regulates genes determining stamen and carpel development in wild-type flowers...|$|R
40|$|During most of Drosophila {{development}} {{the regulation}} of <b>homeotic</b> <b>gene</b> transcription is controlled by two groups of regulatory genes, the trithorax group of activators and the Polycomb group of repressors. brahma (brm), {{a member of the}} trithorax group, encodes a protein related to the yeast SWI 2 /SNF 2 protein, a subunit of a protein complex that assists sequence-specific activator proteins by alleviating the repressive effects of chromatin. To learn more about the molecular mechanisms underlying {{the regulation of}} <b>homeotic</b> <b>gene</b> transcription, we have investigated whether a similar complex exists in flies. We identified the Drosophila snr 1 gene, a potential homologue of the yeast SNF 5 gene that encodes a subunit of the yeast SWI/SNF complex. The snr 1 gene is essential and genetically interacts with brm and trithorax (trx), suggesting cooperation in regulating <b>homeotic</b> <b>gene</b> transcription. The spatial and temporal patterns of expression of snr 1 {{are similar to those of}} brm. The snr 1 and brm proteins are present in a large (> 2 x 10 (6) Da) complex, and they co-immunoprecipitate from Drosophila extracts. These findings provide direct evidence for conservation of the SWI/SNF complex in higher eucaryotes and suggest that the Drosophila brm/snr 1 complex plays an important role in maintaining <b>homeotic</b> <b>gene</b> transcription during development by counteracting the repressive effects of chromatin...|$|R
40|$|Cell fate is {{determined}} when {{the commitment of}} cells to a particular fate is autonomously maintained, irrespective of their environment. In Drosophila, fate determination is maintained through {{the action of the}} Polycomb-group and trithorax-group genes, which are required so that states of <b>homeotic</b> <b>gene</b> activity are inherited through cell division. It is shown here that the CURLY LEAF gene of Arabidopsis is necessary for stable repression of a floral <b>homeotic</b> <b>gene</b> and encodes a protein with homology to the product of the Polycomb-group gene Enhancer of zeste. We suggest that Polycomb-group genes have a similar role in fate determination in plants and animals...|$|R
25|$|The ABC {{model of}} flower {{development}} was first formulated by George Haughn and Chris Somerville in 1988. It {{was first used}} as a model to describe the collection of genetic mechanisms that establish floral organ identity in the Rosids, as exemplified by Arabidopsis thaliana, and the Asterids, as demonstrated by Antirrhinum majus. Both species have four verticils (sepals, petals, stamens and carpels), which are defined by the differential expression {{of a number of}} <b>homeotic</b> <b>genes</b> present in each verticil. This means that the sepals are solely characterized by the expression of A genes, while the petals are characterized by the co-expression of A and B genes. The B and C genes establish the identity of the stamens and the carpels only require C genes to be active. It should be noted that type A and C genes are reciprocally antagonistic.|$|E
25|$|As {{discussed}} above, {{the floral}} organs of eudicotyledonous angiosperms {{are arranged in}} 4 different verticils, containing the sepals, petals, stamen and carpels. The ABC model states that the identity of these organs {{is determined by the}} <b>homeotic</b> <b>genes</b> A, A+B, B+C and C, respectively. In contrast with the sepal and petal verticils of the eudicots, the perigone of many plants of the Liliaceae family have two nearly identical external petaloid verticils (the tepals). In order to explain the floral morphology of the Liliaceae, van Tunen et al. proposed a modified ABC model in 1993. This model suggests that class B genes are not only expressed in verticils 2 and 3, but also in 1. It therefore follows that the organs of verticils 1 and 2 express class A and B genes and this is how they have a petaloid structure. This theoretical model has been experimentally proven through the cloning and characterization of homologs of the Antirrhinum genes GLOBOSA and DEFICIENS in a Liliaceae, the tulip Tulipa gesneriana. These genes are expressed in verticils 1,2 and 3.|$|E
500|$|This led to {{a second}} synthesis, at last {{including}} embryology as well as molecular genetics, phylogeny, and evolutionary biology to form evo-devo. In 1978, Edward B.

40|$|AbstractThe floral <b>homeotic</b> <b>gene</b> AGAMOUS {{specifies}} stamen and carpel fate in {{the central}} whorls of Arabidopsis flowers. Transcription of AGAMOUS RNA is restricted {{to the center of}} developing flowers by several, partially redundant negative regulators, one of which is the <b>homeotic</b> <b>gene</b> APETALA 2. We have identified regulatory elements that mediate transcriptional repression of AGAMOUS by APETALA 2 and found that several redundant elements respond independently to loss of APETALA 2 activity. Thus, redundancy at the level of cis-regulatory sequences is independent of redundancy at the level of trans-regulators. We have also found that only the early, but not the late, effects of APETALA 2 on AGAMOUS require the meristem-identity protein LEAFY, a positive regulator of AGAMOUS...|$|R
50|$|Despite {{the terms}} being {{commonly}} interchanged, not all <b>homeotic</b> <b>genes</b> are Hox genes; the MADS-box genes are homeotic but not Hox genes. Thus, the Hox genes {{are a subset}} of <b>homeotic</b> <b>genes.</b>|$|E
50|$|Much {{research}} has been done on <b>homeotic</b> <b>genes</b> in different organisms, ranging from basic understanding of how the molecules work to mutations to how <b>homeotic</b> <b>genes</b> affect the human body. Changing the expression levels of <b>homeotic</b> <b>genes</b> can negatively impact the organism. For example, in one study, a pathogenic phytoplasma caused <b>homeotic</b> <b>genes</b> in a flowering plant to either be significantly upregulated or downregulated. This led to severe phenotypic changes including dwarfing, defects in the pistils, hypopigmentation, and the development of leaf-like structures on most floral organs. In another study, {{it was found that the}} homeotic gene Cdx2 acts as a tumor suppressor. In normal expression levels, the gene prevents tumorgenesis and colorectal cancer when exposed to carcinogens; however, when Cdx2 was not well expressed, carcinogens caused tumor development. These studies, along with many others, show the importance of <b>homeotic</b> <b>genes</b> even after development.|$|E
50|$|While the {{segmentation}} genes can {{specify the}} number, size, and polarity of segments, <b>homeotic</b> <b>genes</b> can specify {{the identity of}} the segment. The <b>homeotic</b> <b>genes</b> are activated by gap genes and pair-rule genes. The Antennapedia complex and the bithorax complex on the third chromosome contain the major <b>homeotic</b> <b>genes</b> required for specifying segmental identity (actually parasegmental identity). These genes are transcription factors and are expressed in overlapping regions that correlate with their position along the chromosome. These transcription factors regulate other transcription factors, cell surface molecules with roles in cell adhesion, and other cell signals. Later during development, <b>homeotic</b> <b>genes</b> are expressed in the nervous system in a similar anterior/posterior pattern. <b>Homeotic</b> <b>genes</b> are maintained throughout development through the modification of the condensation state of their chromatin. Polycomb genes maintain the chromatin in an inactive conformation while trithorax genes maintain chromatin in an active conformation.|$|E

The unsuspected additional role of WUS in regulating floral <b>homeotic</b> <b>gene</b> expression supports the hypothesis that floral patterning uses a general meristem patterning system that was present before flowers evolved.

50|$|In {{evolutionary}} developmental biology, <b>homeotic</b> <b>genes</b> are genes which {{regulate the}} development of anatomical structures in various organisms such as echinoderms, insects, mammals, and plants.

40|$|Differential gene {{expression}} is what allows cells {{with the same}} genetic material to perform different functions, and is therefore a fundamental question {{in the field of}} developmental biology. Although all of the steps involved in {{gene expression}} can, in principle, be regulated (like RNA processing and protein modifications), for most genes, the initial act of transcription is the primary point of control. During my thesis, I have focused my research on understanding how genes can be selectively regulated.

40|$|We have {{screened}} the Drosophila X chromosome for genes whose dosage {{affects the}} function of the <b>homeotic</b> <b>gene</b> Deformed.

The other previously characterized gene identified as a Deformed interactor is Notch, which encodes a transmembrane receptor.

40|$|A {{deletion}} mutation in the Antennapedia Complex of Drosophila melanogaster, Df(3 R) SCB(XL 2), induces both dominant and recessive loss-of-function phenotypes. The deletion {{is associated with}} diminished function of proboscipedia (pb), a <b>homeotic</b> <b>gene</b> required for mouthparts formation. Df(3 R) SCB(XL 2) also has associated dominant thoracic defects related to diminished expression of the <b>homeotic</b> Antennapedia (Antp) <b>gene</b> copy on the homologous chromosome.

Newly juxtaposed Antp sequences provide the pb gene on the deletion bearing chromosome with a second promoter, Antp P 1, in addition to its own. Ectopic pb protein expression occurs under Antp P 1 control, by alternate splicing, and results in diminished accumulation of Antp protein in the imaginal disc cells where Antp P 1 is normally expressed.

We have used DNA microarray analyses to identify potential targets of Ultrabithorax function during haltere specification. Expression patterns of 18 validated target genes and functional analyses of a subset of these genes suggest that down-regulation of both anterior–posterior and dorso-ventral signaling is critical for haltere fate specification. This is further confirmed by the observation that combined over-expression of Decapentaplegic and Vestigial is sufficient to override the effect of Ubx and cause dramatic haltere-to-wing transformations. Our results also demonstrate that analysis of the differential development of wing and haltere is a good assay system to identify novel regulators of key signaling pathways...|$|R
