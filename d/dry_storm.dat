5|$|The {{mountain}} pine beetle killed {{a number of}} trees in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem from the late 1960s through the mid-1980s. This created a heterogeneous forest in which old surviving trees were mixed with younger trees of various ages. This mixed stand structure may have provided ladder fuels {{that contributed to the}} fires. In addition, the winter season of 1987–1988 was drier than usual, with the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem receiving only 31% of the normal snowpack. However, April and May 1988 were very wet and the abundant moisture greatly aided grass and understory development. By June, the rainfall stopped and little was recorded in the entire Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem for the next four months. By July, the worst drought in the history of Yellowstone National Park began. Grasses and plants which grew well in the early summer soon turned to dry tinder. Relative humidity levels fell further, desiccating the forest. Fuel moisture content in dead and fallen timber was recorded as low as 5%. By mid-August, humidity levels were averaging below 20% and were recorded as low as 6% on one occasion. To compound the lack of rainfall, the majority of Yellowstone's soils are rhyolitic volcanic rocks and soils which have poor moisture retention. A series of strong but <b>dry</b> <b>storm</b> fronts also led to the rapid spread of a number of the largest fires.|$|E

60|$|To reef the {{mainsail}} we {{were forced}} to run off before the gale under the single reefed jib.

A wind sheer to starboard, then another to port as the enormous seas struck the schooner astern and nearly broached her to. As day broke we took in the jib, leaving not a sail unfurled. Since we had begun scudding she had ceased to take the seas over her bow, but amidships they broke fast and furious. It was a <b>dry</b> <b>storm</b> in the matter of rain, but the force of the wind filled the air with fine spray, which flew as high as the crosstrees and cut the face like a knife, making it impossible to see over a hundred yards ahead. The sea was a dark lead color as with long, slow, majestic roll it was heaped up by the wind into liquid mountains of foam. The wild antics of the schooner were sickening as she forged along. She would almost stop, as though climbing a mountain, then rapidly rolling to right and left as she gained the summit of a huge sea, she steadied herself and paused for a moment as though affrighted at the yawning precipice before her. Like an avalanche, she shot forward and down as the sea astern struck her with the force of a thousand battering rams, burying her bow to the cat-heads in the milky foam at the bottom that came on deck in all directions--forward, astern, to right and left, through the hawse-pipes and over the rail.|$|E

40|$|International audienceA 1 -year {{survey of}} {{sediment}} dynamics on the Têt inner-shelf in the south-western {{part of the}} Gulf of Lions was conducted {{as part of the}} EUROSTRATAFORM program (European Margin Strata Formation) from October 2004 to November 2005. Several bottom instruments (ADCP, wave gauge and altimeters) were deployed at 28 m water depth on the Têt prodelta to measure forcing responsible for sediment erosion and transport on the inner-shelf. The survey period was characterized by low inputs from the coastal rivers and the absence of severe E–SE marine storms, but intense cold dense shelf water formation along the inner-shelf due to strong and persistent N–NW continental winds. The strong (> 20 cm/s) and prolonged (4 months) southwards alongshore currents during the preconditioning and formation phases of dense shelf water generated continuous sediment erosion of several centimetres on the Têt prodelta and significant suspended-sediment transport. Hydrodynamical modelling shows that the core of the flow predominantly affects the inner-shelf, but occasionally spreads over the mid-shelf mud belt and the outer-shelf, due to the variable intensity of the NW wind (Tramontane). The impact of this N–NW wind-driven process in terms of resuspension rates and suspended-sediment transport clearly differs from that of extreme E–SE storms observed during the previous winter at the same site [Guillén, J., Bourrin, F., Palanques, A., Durrieu de Madron, X., Puig, P., Buscail, R., 2006.

40|$|Special issue EUROSTRATAFORM VOL. 1 : Source to Sink Sedimentation on the European Margin. [...] 14 pages, 8 figuresThe {{importance}} of short-term processes, such as floods and storms, on sediment delivery and reworking on the Têt inner shelf was investigated. The Têt inner shelf is a small, event-dominated system {{located in the}} south-western part of the Gulf of Lions. The expected sedimentary scenario in this environment is that fluvial sediment should be deposited on the prodelta and later dispersed around the shelf and slope by wave and current reworking during storms. This paper investigates differences in inner shelf sediment dynamics between storm events occurring during usual river discharges and those occurring during river floods. Waves, current velocities, near-bottom water turbidity, bottom sediment grain-size and sea-floor erosion/accretion were concurrently measured at 28 -m water depth on the Têt inner shelf from November 2003 to March 2004. Two major storms took place on 4 December 2003 and 21 February 2004, and two moderate storms occurred on 8 December 2003 and 14 March 2004. The two major storms displayed similar wave characteristics: maximum significant wave height (Hs) > 7 m, peak period (Tp) > 12 s and wave direction around 90 °. The main environmental differences during the two major storm events correspond {{to the amount of}} sediment discharged from the Têt River. About 2 × 104 t of sediment was delivered by the river during the 4 December flood (wet storm) and less than 5 × 102 t during the 21 February storm (<b>dry</b> <b>storm).</b> Sediment dynamics were quite similar during the storm events: resuspension caused by waves and sediment advection towards the southeast due to near-bottom shelf currents were the dominant sedimentary processes. The result was a bottom sediment erosion of several centimetres at the study site during both the wet and dry events. The main differences between the wet and dry events arose after the storm. Immediately after the peak of the wet storm, sediment supplied by the Têt River (and probably from other rivers) was deposited around the river mouth. A few days later, during a moderate storm, this unconsolidated sediment was resuspended, transported offshore and deposited on the inner shelf. In contrast, a moderate storm which occurred some days after the dry February storm caused bottom erosion on the inner shelf, because no fresh sediment was available on the shallower area. The results from this study indicate that the Têt inner shelf at 28 -m water depth is mainly a bypass zone for sediment that is transported S-SE towards the middle-outer shelf and slope, although ephemeral sediment deposits may be favoured by the sediment supplied from flood events. Sediment transport across the shelf, from the river to the slope, follows a complex, multi-step pattern {{that needs to be addressed}} using a multi-event approach.
