40|$|Court orders {{may require}} supervising {{agencies}} (probation, parole, pre-trial or law enforcement) to monitor a {{specific set of}} offenders using <b>ankle</b> <b>bracelets.</b> These <b>ankle</b> <b>bracelets</b> transmit the offender’s GPS coordinates at regular intervals. The analysis of the offender’s GPS data help: (1) detect unauthorized activities in real time and provide alerts to a community corrections officer, law enforcement dispatcher or a control center, and (2) mine for the offenders’ suspicious behavior and predict probable future threats beforehand. Unauthorized activities include protecting geographically defined regions (e. g., school zones) in which the offender is not allowed to be present. Suspicious behaviors include the meeting of offenders with each other on a regular basis, possibly near restricted zones. This demo presents “Safe Step”, a real time tracking and analysis system for GPS data streamed out of <b>ankle</b> <b>bracelets.</b> The system’s back end is a data stream processing system that collects data from multiple <b>ankle</b> <b>bracelets,</b> correlates the past and the current GPS locations together to analyze the offender’s individual behavior as well as the interaction between offenders. The system’s front end utilizes a web application interface that displays the current locations of offenders on a map. It also pushes to the user various alert notifications that have been generated by the system’s backend. The system’s back end is built using Microsoft StreamInsight and Microsoft SQL Server Spatial Libraries while the visualization in the system’s front end utilizes Bing Maps...|$|R
