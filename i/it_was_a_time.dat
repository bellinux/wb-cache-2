Lamb shared his idea with several cable executives, who helped him launch the network. Among them were Bob Rosencrans who provided $25,000 of initial funding in 1979 and John D. Evans who provided the wiring and access to the headend needed for the distribution of the C-SPAN signal.|$|E

Old buildings were demolished, new machine and composing rooms built on West Wear Street and two rotary presses installed just before the move, each capable of printing 24,000copies an hour. These changes brought about increased circulation, but it took another seven years before the Echo made a profit. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> of intense competition; the Sunderland Times converted from a bi-weekly to a daily paper in the same month as the Echo moved to Bridge Street, and Tory supporters started a paper of their own, the Sunderland Daily Post. The Sunderland Times was the first to collapse, but the Post survived for the next quarter of a century, providing the Echo with an often bitter rival.|$|E

25|$|Brunelleschi, {{and others}} like him, {{developed}} {{a passion for the}} highly refined style of Roman architecture, in which the forms and decorations followed rules of placement and proportion that had long been neglected.

25|$|The sudden {{spread of}} the rumours {{in the spring of}} 1915, six months after the events and Machen's story was {{published}}, is also puzzling. The stories published then often attribute their sources to anonymous British officers.

As <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> of allied problems with the Lusitania sinking, Zeppelin attacks and failure to achieve a breakthrough on the Western Front, the timing would make military sense.

In 450, Emperor Taiwu once again attacked the Liu Song and reached Guabu (瓜步, in modern Nanjing, Jiangsu), threatening to cross the river to attack Jiankang, the Liu Song capital. Though up to this point, the Northern Wei military forces dominated the Liu Song forces, they took heavy casualties. The Northern Wei forces plundered numerous households before returning north.|$|E

He brought in the converts by the score, most notably in the revivals in Canada West 1851–53. His technique combined restrained emotionalism with a call for personal commitment, coupled with follow-up action to organize support from converts. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> when the Holiness Movement caught fire, with the revitalized interest {{of men and women}} in Christian perfection.

However the Republic also marked a time of foreign domination and revolution.
