5|$|While {{the designs}} for the corps de logis were {{confined}} by the foundations of Harrison's earlier plan, the secondary wings and precincts were not. Abandoning completely Harrisons concept of bedrooms set in terraces beneath the corp de logis, Blore's assistant architect, Hunt, opted for the typical vast sprawling wings and servants' quarters of the 19th century English country house. These took {{full advantage of the}} gradients and topography of the site, and with their courtyards came to resemble a small medieval, fortified town of towers and high castellated walls. Nowhere <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>more</b> evident than the Shuvalov Passage, an enclosed carriage drive squeezed between the high walls of two wings, leading from the castellated Western Gatehouse to the forecourt before the northern facade. The passage, which twists and turn beneath high wall and towers and even passes under a bridge, resembles the street of a medieval town, rather than the approach to a country house.|$|E

Colonial buildings {{influenced by the}} Portuguese, Dutch and British exist alongside structures built in Buddhist, Hindu, Islamic, Indian and Contemporary architectural styles.

25|$|Idyllic and {{pleasant}} as this concept was for those living upstairs, {{it was bad}} news for the servants, as the first and most obvious solution was to bury them. Nowhere <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>more</b> evident than at Castle Coole in Northern Ireland. The entire servant's quarters were put underground into cellars, lit only by windows at the bottom of grated pits. The only means of approach was through a single underground tunnel, the entrance of which was concealed by the brow of a landscaped hill some distance from the house.|$|E
500|$|... "Shivers" [...] {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} {{and became a}} major underground success in Australia, bringing more national attention to the band. Nick Cave cited it in hindsight as {{the main reason for}} the Boys Next Door's eminence. In a retrospective review for AllMusic, critic Will Lerner wrote that [...] "it's impressive how, even at this early stage, Nick Cave was a confident and unique singer, perfectly aware of the strengths and limitations of his voice … he knows how to come across in a scary and theatrical manner that perfectly complements the music. Nowhere <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>more</b> apparent than on … 'Shivers', an unashamedly melodramatic example of post-adolescent anguish". [...] "Shivers", along with other songs Howard composed, were [...] "crucial to guiding the band in the darker, wilder direction" [...] that defined the Birthday Party's music, according to Dan Lawrence of Stereogum. The song has since been considered an Australian classic and labelled by ABC Television as [...] "possibly Australia's most enduring cult hit".|$|E

500|$|Horrocks became {{interested}} in writing, and submitted articles about military matters to newspapers and magazines including the Picture Post and The Sunday Times. This led to a short but successful career as the presenter {{of a series of}} television programmes, British Castles (1962), Men in Battle and Epic Battle, produced by Huw Wheldon. In these, Horrocks lectured on great historical battles, [...] "highlighting excitement and interest" [...] to allow the programmes to appeal to the widest possible audience. He was interviewed extensively for the Thames Television series, The World at War, and, to his embarrassment, appeared {{on the cover of the}} BBC's Radio Times magazine. [...] After his television career ended, he served on the board of the housebuilding company Bovis, and continued writing, contributing a column to The Sunday Times and editing a series of British Army regimental histories. In 1968 Horrocks collaborated with J & L Randall as editor of the 'Merit' board game 'Combat'. His portrait and signature appear on the box and in his introduction to the game he states [...] "In war no two battles are ever the same because the terrain is always different and it <b>is</b> <b>this,</b> <b>more</b> than anything else, which influences the composition of the different armies and the tactics employed by the rival Commanders". His autobiography, A Full Life, was published in 1960, and he co-authored Corps Commander, an account of his battles in north-west Europe, published in 1977.|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics. Joey Lynch of Billboard compared the song's demo {{to the studio}} versions, claiming that [...] "The studio version of 'Joan of Arc' is a massive improvement on the illegally leaked demo that preceded news of the album itself. [...] Nowhere <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>more</b> apparent than on 'Joan of Arc,' a solid album track that sounds 10 times better than the leaked version." [...] While reviewing the three tracks released prior to the album, Sam C. Mac of Slant Magazine called it [...] "arguably the standout of the whole over-blown affair," [...] noting that the song [...] "sounded like a highlight even in its more acoustic demo form, but the album version is a full-on stunner... The song sounds {{a bit like a}} Cardigans leftover circa 'Long Gone Before Daylight'. It's the strongest (anti-)ballad of Madonna's last few albums, and a strong argument for artists responding to the denigration of their art through the more considered medium of the art itself, rather than snap public statements. [...] More than any of the previously released songs, 'Joan of Arc' also establishes one of the foundational themes of Rebel Heart, albeit one not always evident when wading through the poorly sequenced album." [...] Adding to the previous review, Annie Zaleski of The A.V. Club praised the juxtapositions in the album's lyrical content, which according to her, [...] "make some of her most vulnerable, engaging work in years— in particular 'Joan of Arc'." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nowhere <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>more</b> {{apparent}} {{than in his}} portrait [...] (1908), in which the subject is seen wearing a Persian costume, a pearl encrusted turban, and strumming an Indian tambura, accoutrements all meant to convey sensuality and mystery. If Sargent used this portrait to explore issues of sexuality and identity, {{it seems to have}} met with the satisfaction of the subject's father, Asher Wertheimer, a wealthy Jewish art dealer.|$|E
2500|$|While the Local 77 {{movement}} in the 1960s succeeded in extending racial equality towards the predominantly black labor unions, the lack of student support in the following years hindered further improvements for a demographic group with much less power than Duke's administration.

5000|$|Luther's harsh {{comments}} about the Jews are {{seen by many as}} a continuation of medieval Christian antisemitism.

2500|$|Aesthetics are {{a central}} {{component}} of Russian Orthodox worship services; nowhere <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>more</b> evident than through {{the study of}} the architecture of Russian churches and cathedrals. [...] Services are designed so as to stimulate the five senses, and the structure and layout of the churches themselves regulate the sensory perceptions of the worshipers. [...] The mystic environment cultivated through church services is enhanced through the regulation of light, movement, smoke, and sound. [...] Icons, visual representations of holy figures, are the most ancient and important visual aspect of worship. [...] Icons adorn the space in a multitude of ways and become a part of Orthodox churches’ architecture.|$|E
2500|$|Of the two, Zeca Afonso {{was more}} {{prolific}} and more {{identified with the}} movement, {{so much so that}} another of his songs was the first choice for the code [...] "Venham mais 5" [...] (Let 5 more come). Other artists also used some craft to hide their meanings in the song or went into exile. One example is Adriano Correia de Oliveira that masked the explicit lyrics with the vocal tone making it difficult to distinguish the critical verse, from the refrain or even other verses. In no other song <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>more</b> noted that the ballad [...] "Trova do Vento que Passa" [...] (Song/Poem of the Passing Wind), whose lyrics by the writer Manuel Alegre were a direct criticism of the state. The music was by António Portugal but Correia used a typical Fado rhythm to hide such provocative verses as [...] "Mesmo na noite mais triste/em tempo de sevidão/há sempre alguém que resiste/há sempre alguém que diz não" [...] (even in the saddest night/in time of servitude/there is always someone who stands up/there is always someone who says No).|$|E
