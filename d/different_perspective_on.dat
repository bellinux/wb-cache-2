5|$|Godwin's books {{begin to}} {{incorporate}} religious themes starting with Father Melancholy's Daughter (1991). The novel is told {{from the perspective}} of multiple characters, each of whom have a <b>different</b> <b>perspective</b> <b>on</b> religion. Father Melancholy's Daughter was followed by several books that centered on the Episcopal church and Christian practices. In these novels female and male characters have a more equal influence on the events and plot than in prior novels. Godwin's books neither evangelize nor mock the practices of the Episcopal Church, but rather treat it as a routine aspect of life, or as a subject of intellectual interest. During these years Godwin's books continued to show father figures who have died or are absent. By 1996 two of her books had fathers that died and five had stepfathers that are depicted as intruding on the mother-daughter relationship.|$|E
5|$|The first divine act is the {{creation}} of the cosmos, described in several creation myths. They focus on different gods, each of which may act as creator deities. The eight gods of the Ogdoad, who represent the chaos that precedes creation, give birth to the sun god, who establishes order in the newly formed world; Ptah, who embodies thought and creativity, gives form to all things by envisioning and naming them; Atum produces all things as emanations of himself; and Amun, according to the theology promoted by his priesthood, preceded and created the other creator gods. These and other versions of the events of creation were not seen as contradictory. Each gives a <b>different</b> <b>perspective</b> <b>on</b> the complex process by which the organized universe and its many deities emerged from undifferentiated chaos. The period following creation, in which a series of gods rule as kings over the divine society, is the setting for most myths. The gods struggle against the forces of chaos and among each other before withdrawing from the human world and installing the historical kings of Egypt to rule in their place.|$|E

25|$|In late 2004, Morris {{directed}} {{a series of}} noteworthy commercials for Sharp Electronics. The commercials enigmatically depicted various scenes from {{what appeared to be}} a short narrative that climaxed with a car crashing into a swimming pool. Each commercial showed a slightly <b>different</b> <b>perspective</b> <b>on</b> the events, and each ended with a cryptic weblink. The weblink was to a fake webpage advertising a prize offered to anyone who could discover the secret location of some valuable urns. It was in fact an alternate reality game. The original commercials can be found on Morris's website.|$|E
25|$|Palladio was to {{transform}} the architectural style of both palaces and churches by taking a <b>different</b> <b>perspective</b> <b>on</b> the notion of Classicism. While the architects of Florence and Rome looked to structures like the Colosseum and the Arch of Constantine to provide formulae, Palladio looked to classical temples with their simple peristyle form. When he used the “triumphal arch” motif of a large arched opening with lower square-topped opening on either side, he invariably applied it on a small scale, such as windows, rather than {{on a large scale}} as Alberti used it at Sant’Andrea’s. This Ancient Roman motif {{is often referred to as}} the Palladian Arch.|$|E
25|$|But the use {{of stable}} models in answer set {{programming}} provides a <b>different</b> <b>perspective</b> <b>on</b> such programs. In that programming paradigm, a given search problem is represented by a logic program so that the stable models of the program correspond to solutions. Then programs with many stable models correspond to problems with many solutions, and programs without stable models correspond to unsolvable problems. For instance, the eight queens puzzle has 92 solutions; to solve it using answer set programming, we encode it by a logic program with 92 stable models. From this point of view, logic programs with exactly one stable model are rather special in answer set programming, like polynomials with exactly one root in algebra.|$|E

25|$|Creative {{director}} Tim Longo {{explained that}} one of the main goals for Halo 5: Guardians was to expand the universe. To achieve this the studio created new main characters for Fireteam Osiris and introduced characters from the expanded fiction with Blue Team. Early in development, the team decided that Spartan Locke would be used to present the player with a <b>different</b> <b>perspective</b> <b>on</b> the Master Chief. The aim was to create a deliberate contrast between the two main characters. In developing the characters of Fireteam Osiris, 343 Industries initially considered making the team Fireteam Majestic, using the same characters from the Halo 4 episodic series Spartan Ops. When Longo joined as creative director {{and the rest of the}} story developed, the developers decided that Majestic was the wrong team to use and set out to create a new fireteam with different characters.|$|E

[...] There is wide agreement that he was an outstanding political campaigner—persuasive, witty, and warm: [...] "his astonishing memory for faces persuaded voters that they were intimate friends... his resourceful mind afforded quips and stunts for every occasion." [...] A <b>different</b> <b>perspective</b> <b>on</b> Thorpe, quoted by Bloch, was given by a former friend, the art expert David Carritt, {{at the time of the}} trial: [...] "Self-centred...Mildly entertaining, slightly sinister. Said to be witty, but... if one doesn't care for impersonations, he's really a bit of a bore".|$|E

500|$|The film is {{primarily}} presented {{from the perspective}} of the character Dax and his camera, but Nourizadeh also obtained footage by providing the cast and extras with recording devices such as BlackBerrys and iPhones to capture events occurring outside of the perspective or knowledge of the cameraman. This resulted in hours of unusable footage that had to be observed by Nourizadeh and his team to find segments that could be incorporated into the final film. Nourizadeh stated [...] "when you have real material being shot by real people, it then kind of feels like it is. It is found footage. I hated spending 10 hours looking through bits of flip footage – people didn’t press stop, it's like in their pockets. But yeah, it was great, man." [...] Other footage was provided from fictional police and news cameras to give a <b>different</b> <b>perspective</b> <b>on</b> the events.|$|E
500|$|Gender was a {{recurring}} theme in Rix Nicholas's career, for better and for worse. Praise from a French art critic for her abilities was expressed by saying [...] " [...] Rix paints like a man!". An Australian critic was unsure what to say, admiring her composition but declaring her technique [...] "strangely unfeminine". Pigot considered that, when Rix Nicholas sought to stake out a woman's place in nationalist art in mid-twentieth century Australia, her career was ultimately penalised by her unwillingness {{to play by the}} male establishment's rules. Art historian Catherine Speck had a <b>different</b> <b>perspective</b> <b>on</b> Rix Nicholas's post-World War I work, suggesting that it never subsequently attained the quality of her Paris output, because her first husband's death in the Great War drove her to create nationalist images of inconsistent quality. In their reference work A Story of Australian Painting, Mary Eagle and John Jones considered Rix Nicholas, alongside Clarice Beckett, to be [...] "the best woman artist to emerge from the artistic milieu of Melbourne in the decade of the First World War".|$|E
500|$|Only a few {{assets from}} Resident Evil 1.5 could be recycled, as the {{principal}} locations in the final build were made to look more extravagant and artistic, based on photographs taken of the interiors of Western-style buildings in Japanese cities. These environments were created with a software program called O2, and each background took {{two to three weeks}} to render. The maximum number of zombies displayed on the screen at one time was limited to seven, making it possible to use 450 polygons for the comparatively detailed models of Leon and Claire. The protagonists, instead of being given visible wounds, were made to limp slowly upon receiving heavy damage. Apart from the graphics, {{one of the most important}} new features was the [...] "Zapping System", which was partly inspired by Back to the Future Part II, a time travel-themed film sequel that offers a <b>different</b> <b>perspective</b> <b>on</b> the story of the original film. The voice-overs by the all-Canadian cast of Resident Evil 2 were recorded before the actual cutscenes were completed, with each of the actors selected from a roster of ten people per role. Thereafter, the full-motion videos (FMVs) were created by filming stop motion animations of action figures, which were then rendered to completed pictures with computer graphics (CG) tools. Ada's movie model could not be finished in time. Thus, she is the only main character not to appear in a pre-rendered cutscene.|$|E
