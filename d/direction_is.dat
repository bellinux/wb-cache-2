5|$|The {{winds are}} {{predominantly}} northern. Along the coastline the winds {{flow from the}} north in November – March, from the east in April – August and from the north-east in September – October. The sea breeze causes the high frequency of eastern winds in summer. In the interior the predominant wind <b>direction</b> <b>is</b> more varied with northern winds being the most frequent in January – March and in October.|$|E
5|$|When {{the general}} flow pattern buckles from a zonal pattern to the meridional pattern, a slower {{movement}} in a north or southward <b>direction</b> <b>is</b> more likely.

5|$|ARC is {{an audio}} link meant to replace other cables between the TV and the A/V {{receiver}} or speaker system. This <b>direction</b> <b>is</b> used when the TV {{is the one}} that generates or receives the video stream instead of the other equipment. A typical case is the running of an app on a smart TV such as Netflix, but reproduction of audio is handled by the other equipment. Without ARC, the audio output from the TV needs to be routed by another cable, typically TOS-Link or coax, into the speaker system.|$|E

5|$|All {{these facts}} are {{consequences}} of the thermal wind relation. The balance of forces acting on an atmospheric air parcel in the vertical <b>direction</b> <b>is</b> primarily between the gravitational force acting on {{the mass of the}} parcel and the buoyancy force, or the difference in pressure between the top and bottom surfaces of the parcel. Any imbalance between these forces results in the acceleration of the parcel in the imbalance direction: upward if the buoyant force exceeds the weight, and downward if the weight exceeds the buoyancy force. The balance in the vertical <b>direction</b> <b>is</b> referred to as hydrostatic. Beyond the tropics, the dominant forces act in the horizontal direction, and the primary struggle is between the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient force. Balance between these two forces is referred to as geostrophic. Given both hydrostatic and geostrophic balance, one can derive the thermal wind relation: the vertical gradient of the horizontal wind is proportional to the horizontal temperature gradient. If two air masses, one cold and dense to the North and the other hot and less dense to the South, are separated by a vertical boundary and that boundary should be removed, the difference in densities will result in the cold air mass slipping under the hotter and less dense air mass. The Coriolis effect will then cause poleward-moving mass to deviate to the East, while equatorward-moving mass will deviate toward the west. The general trend in the atmosphere is for temperatures to decrease in the poleward direction. As a result, winds develop an eastward component and that component grows with altitude. Therefore, the strong eastward moving jet streams are in part a simple consequence {{of the fact that the}} Equator is warmer than the North and South poles.|$|E
5|$|Cloud often forms inland, {{especially}} near hills, {{and reduces}} exposure to sunshine. The average annual sunshine is about 1,600 hours. Rainfall {{tends to be}} associated with Atlantic depressions or with convection. In summer, convection caused by solar surface heating sometimes forms shower clouds, and {{a large proportion of the}} annual precipitation falls from showers and thunderstorms at that time of year. Average rainfall is 800–900mm (31–35in). About 8–15 days of snowfall is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, and June to August having the lightest.

5|$|Continuing east-{{southeast}}erly along Washtenaw Avenue, M-17 {{meets the}} southeast corner of the EMU campus at Oakwood Avenue. The highway follows the southern edge of campus to Cross Street, where the highway splits to follow a one-way pairing of streets. Eastbound M-17 continues along Washtenaw Avenue while westbound traffic follows Cross Street. Eastbound traffic turns southward at Hamilton Street for two blocks before turning east along Michigan Avenue, meeting westbound Bus. US12. The two highway designations merge, running concurrently through downtown Ypsilanti. The section of Michigan Avenue between Hamilton and Huron streets is actually a wrong-way concurrency because although it is a two-way boulevard, the eastbound <b>direction</b> <b>is</b> M-17 and the westbound <b>direction</b> <b>is</b> Bus. US 12. Both directions of traffic for both highways rejoin at Huron Street, as the westbound M-17 traffic uses Huron Street north to Cross Street and westbound Bus. US 12 turns south along Huron Street. Northeast of the Huron Street intersection is Riverside Park. Michigan Avenue forms the extreme southern park boundary just before it crosses the Huron River. At Ecorse Road, M-17 turns south in Ypsilanti Township through a residential area, separating from Bus. US12. Ecorse Road turns east four blocks north of I-94/US12 and runs parallel to the freeway. Past Harris Road, US12 turns northeasterly on a separate expressway. Where it meets Ecorse Road, US12 follows Ecorse Road, replacing M-17. This junction marks the eastern terminus of M-17 west of Willow Run Airport.|$|E
5|$|Cubic {{diamonds}} have {{a perfect}} and easy octahedral cleavage, {{which means that they}} only have four planes—weak directions following the faces of the octahedron where there are fewer bonds—along which diamond can easily split upon blunt impact to leave a smooth surface. Similarly, diamond's hardness is markedly directional: the hardest <b>direction</b> <b>is</b> the diagonal on the cube face, 100 times harder than the softest direction, which is the dodecahedral plane. The octahedral plane is intermediate between the two extremes. The diamond cutting process relies heavily on this directional hardness, as without it a diamond would be nearly impossible to fashion. Cleavage also plays a helpful role, especially in large stones where the cutter wishes to remove flawed material or to produce more than one stone from the same piece of rough (e.g. Cullinan Diamond).|$|E

5|$|However, {{because the}} planet is {{rotating}} underneath the atmosphere, and frictional forces arise as the planetary surface drags some atmosphere with it, the air flow from center to periphery is not direct, but is twisted due to the Coriolis effect, or the merely apparent force that arise when the observer is in a rotating frame of reference.

Change in gaze <b>direction</b> <b>is</b> one of several behavioral cues that individuals use in combination with changes in facial and vocal displays and body posture to mark the intention to act on an object. Individuals who seek or follow a joint focus of attention display knowledge that what is in their awareness is also in another's awareness.

5|$|Like {{the other}} Galilean {{satellites}} and the Moon, Io rotates synchronously with its orbital period, keeping one face nearly pointed toward Jupiter. This synchronicity provides the definition for Io's longitude system. Io's prime meridian intersects the equator at the sub-Jovian point. The side of Io that always faces Jupiter {{is known as}} the subjovian hemisphere, whereas the side that always faces away {{is known as the}} antijovian hemisphere. The side of Io that always faces in the direction that Io travels in its orbit is known as the leading hemisphere, whereas the side that always faces in the opposite <b>direction</b> <b>is</b> known as the trailing hemisphere.|$|E

40|$|December 15 - 17, 2007 Royal Phuket City Hotel, Phuket, ThailandEmperor {{penguins}} Aptenodytes forsteri feed {{mainly on}} Pleurogramma antarcticum and Pagothenia borchgrevinki {{in the sea}} of Antarctica. Because these prey are not distributed uniformly, prey encounter rates during a dive change depending on where emperor penguins dive. In limited time and space, they should select areas in which prey are expected to be abundant. We hypothesized that the distribution of emperor penguins' dive <b>directions</b> <b>was</b> not uniform due to their selective dives. In order to test this hypothesis, dive paths were calculated with the data recorded by data loggers. Dive <b>direction</b> <b>was</b> obtained for each dive path, and the distribution of the dive <b>directions</b> <b>was</b> investigated. In five experiments of the total of six experiments, the dive <b>directions</b> <b>were</b> not distributed uniformly. This suggested that the emperor penguins had a preference about their dive directions. The dive <b>directions</b> <b>were</b> not related with ocean current <b>direction,</b> which <b>was</b> considered {{to be one of the}} factors affecting penguins' diving behavior.
