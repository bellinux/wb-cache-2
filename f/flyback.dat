25|$|Diodes are {{frequently}} used to conduct damaging high voltages away from sensitive electronic devices. They are usually reverse-biased (non-conducting) under normal circumstances. When the voltage {{rises above the}} normal range, the diodes become forward-biased (conducting). For example, diodes are used in (stepper motor and H-bridge) motor controller and relay circuits to de-energize coils rapidly without the damaging voltage spikes that would otherwise occur. (A diode used in such an application is called a <b>flyback</b> diode). Many integrated circuits also incorporate diodes on the connection pins to prevent external voltages from damaging their sensitive transistors. Specialized diodes are used to protect from over-voltages at higher power (see Diode types above).|$|E
500|$|The Delon circuit uses {{a bridge}} {{topology}} for voltage doubling; consequently {{it is also}} called a full-wave voltage doubler. This form of circuit was, at one time, commonly found in cathode ray tube television sets where {{it was used to}} provide an [...] Extra high tension (EHT) supply. Generating voltages in excess of 5kV with a transformer has safety issues in terms of domestic equipment and in any case is uneconomical. However, black and white television sets required an e.h.t. of 10kV and colour sets even more. Voltage doublers were used to either double the voltage on an e.h.t winding on the mains transformer or were applied to the waveform on the line <b>flyback</b> coils.Millman and Halkias, p.109Wharton and Howorth, pp.68–69 ...|$|E

2500|$|... 50Hz/60Hz CRTs {{used for}} {{television}} operate with horizontal scanning frequencies of 15,734Hz (for NTSC systems) or 15,625Hz (for PAL systems). These frequencies {{are at the}} upper range of human hearing and are inaudible to many people; however, some people (especially children) will perceive a high-pitched tone near an operating television CRT. The sound is due to magnetostriction in the magnetic core and periodic movement of windings of the <b>flyback</b> transformer.|$|E
2500|$|Amplifiers with {{built-in}} 70-volt output transformers {{are available with}} low impedance and high impedance output connections, the latter typically labeled [...] "25 V" [...] and [...] "70 V". These are robust, purpose-built amplifiers with many application-specific design features such as overcurrent protection and aggressive high-pass filtering for <b>flyback</b> voltage protection. Some models can be configured so that one channel drives one or two low impedance 8-ohm speakers while the other drives a constant-voltage string of speakers.|$|E
50|$|While {{it looks}} superficially like a <b>flyback</b> converter, it {{operates}} in a fundamentally different way, and is generally more energy efficient. A <b>flyback</b> converter stores {{energy in the}} magnetic field in the inductor air gap during the time the converter switching element (transistor) is conducting. When the switch turns off, the stored magnetic field collapses and the energy is transferred to {{the output of the}} <b>flyback</b> converter as electric current. The <b>flyback</b> converter can be viewed as two inductors sharing a common core with opposite polarity windings.|$|E

50|$|The <b>flyback</b> {{converter}} {{is used in}} both AC/DC and DC/DC conversion with {{galvanic isolation}} between the input and any outputs. The <b>flyback</b> converter is a buck-boost converter with the inductor split to form a transformer, so that the voltage ratios are multiplied with an additional advantage of isolation. When driving for example a plasma lamp or a voltage multiplier the rectifying diode of the boost converter is left out and the device is called a <b>flyback</b> transformer.|$|E
50|$|Most <b>flyback</b> chronographs are {{constructed}} {{with the usual}} crown at 3 o'clock and 2 pushpieces at 2 and 4 o'clock. Usually the <b>flyback</b> function {{is controlled by the}} button at 4 o'clock whereas the one at 2 o'clock is used to stop the chronograph.|$|E
50|$|A <b>flyback</b> diode (sometimes {{called a}} snubber diode, commutating diode, {{freewheeling}} diode, suppressor diode, suppression diode, clamp diode, or catch diode) is a diode used to eliminate <b>flyback,</b> {{which is the}} sudden voltage spike seen across an inductive load when its supply current is suddenly reduced or interrupted.|$|E
