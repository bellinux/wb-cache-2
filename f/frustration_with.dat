5|$|The close {{geographic}} and cultural {{ties between the}} Riverina and northern Victoria, combined with continuing <b>frustration</b> <b>with</b> inter colonial tariffs, made the Riverina a fertile area for ideas for uniting the various colonies in an Australian federation.

5|$|As {{the series}} progressed, some critics began to express <b>frustration</b> <b>with</b> the comic. Joey Smith, also with Inside Pulse, found the large cast was {{difficult}} to track by the fourth issue. In a review of issue 33, Fulton found the series entertaining, but sometimes thought the plot felt directionless. Not all agreed, however; Paste Magazine included the comic book in its list of favorite horror comics in late 2016.|$|E

5|$|Part of the {{conflict}} between Team Bondi and Rockstar was due to Rockstar's <b>frustration</b> <b>with</b> Team Bondi's direction, and eventually Team Bondi's management in turn resented Rockstar for taking lots of creative control. It's also worth pointing out that Rockstar used to be very keen on making Team Bondi something like 'Rockstar Sydney' - the more they worked with Team Bondi management, the more they {{came to understand that}} this was a terrible idea.|$|E
5|$|The game {{received}} universal acclaim from critics, who {{praised the}} enhanced vehicle physics, updated visuals, and strong sound design. Several reviewers also gave {{high marks for}} the game's Autovista mode. Some critics expressed <b>frustration</b> <b>with</b> Kinect features, and others also felt that the game was not enough of an innovation from its predecessor, Forza Motorsport 3. These critics did, however, concede that the game was a vast improvement over Forza Motorsport 3.|$|E
5|$|At her new job, Goldman met {{a fellow}} worker named Jacob Kershner, who shared {{her love for}} books, dancing, and traveling, {{as well as her}} <b>frustration</b> <b>with</b> the monotony of factory work. After four months, they married in February 1887. Once he moved in with Goldman's family, however, their {{relationship}} faltered. On their wedding night she discovered that he was impotent; they became emotionally and physically distant. Before long he became jealous and suspicious. She, meanwhile, was becoming more engaged with the political turmoil around her—particularly the fallout of the 1886 Haymarket affair in Chicago and the anti-authoritarian political philosophy of anarchism.|$|E

5|$|Donna Lee Brien {{stated that}} just as the filmmakers {{attempted}} {{to distance themselves from}} Leigh's murder, the city of Newcastle attempted to distance itself from Blackrock. A 1999 feature in The Sydney Morning Herald discussing cinematic production in Newcastle mentioned everything from Mel Gibson's 1977 debut film Summer City to a short film festival that year, but made no mention of Blackrock. Brien theorised that some of the condemnation the film received may have been due to public <b>frustration</b> <b>with</b> the legal system, as the film achieves justice for the victim, whereas no one was ever convicted of raping Leigh. Brien cited the film as an example of why sensitivity and care must be taken when fictionalising an actual crime.|$|E
5|$|Fleury {{continued}} to battle {{drug and alcohol}} addictions, revealing in a November 2004 interview {{that he had not}} overcome the problems that ended his NHL career {{a year and a half}} earlier. He credits his second wife, Jennifer, with turning his life around after they met when he was playing for Horse Lake in 2005. Fleury feared that Jennifer's <b>frustration</b> <b>with</b> his drug use would cost him the relationship, and, with her help, quit drugs and drinking on September 18, 2005. They were married one year later and have a daughter, Skylah. Fleury also has a son and daughter, Beaux and Tatym, from his relationship with his first wife, Veronica, and a son, Josh, born in 1987 to his high school girlfriend, Shannon.|$|E
5|$|For the {{remainder}} of the summer, Wolfe's focus changed, possibly due to <b>frustration</b> <b>with</b> Montcalm's tactics. Wolfe's troops, along with American Rangers, attacked and destroyed small French settlements along the St. Lawrence. An estimated 1,400 stone houses and manors were destroyed, and many colonists killed. The effort was likely an attempt to force Montcalm's army out of its fortifications, but was unsuccessful. However, the attacks did reduce the amount of supplies available to the French, especially as the British navy, unable to control the St. Lawrence entirely, was successfully blockading the ports in France.|$|E
50|$|Clayton was beset with {{personal}} problems in his mid-30s, including <b>frustrations</b> <b>with</b> his career, doubts arising from his homosexuality, manic depression, {{drug abuse and}} a related arrest. He died by his own hand in 1967.|$|R

5|$|Historian Jean-Claude Willame {{argued that}} the speech {{was the result of}} Lumumba's growing <b>frustration</b> <b>with</b> the process of {{independence}} which he believed might represent a purely nominal change in government with no real effects. Lumumba blamed Kasa-Vubu and his colleagues for failing to publicly oppose this situation. Gender historians have therefore {{argued that the}} speech was the result of Lumumba's growing feeling of emasculation. Others have pointed to the influence of Belgian Socialist delegates and representatives of the Guinean President, Ahmed Sékou Touré, who had a strongly Marxist ideology, all of whom hoped a public and international denouncement of colonialism would help them politically.|$|E
5|$|Obama, at age 38, was a {{lecturer}} at the University of Chicago and a two-term state Senator. Though friends, including Terry Link, his colleague in the Illinois Senate, warned Obama against challenging Rush, {{as there was}} no obvious reason to displace him to the voters, Obama ran anyway because of his <b>frustration</b> <b>with</b> what he claimed was Republican obstructionism in the Illinois Legislature and the feeling Rush was representing the district less well as he could. Also challenging Rush were Donne Trotter, a state senator, and George Roby, a police officer. Raymond Wardingly, a perennial candidate {{who worked as a}} clown, ran unopposed for the Republican nomination.|$|E
5|$|On April 19, 1969, {{during a}} parents' weekend, over 80 members of Cornell's Afro-American Society {{took over the}} student union building, Willard Straight Hall. The {{takeover}} was precipitated by increasing racial tension at {{the university and the}} students' <b>frustration</b> <b>with</b> the administration's lack of support for a black studies program. The specific catalysts for the takeover were a reprimand of three black students for an incident the previous December and a cross burning in front of the black women's cooperative and other cases of racism.|$|E

5|$|The {{announcement}} that Portal 2 {{would be available}} on PlayStation 3 {{came as a surprise}} to the industry because Gabe Newell had criticized that console in the past, citing difficulties in the port of The Orange Box. The move toward the PlayStation 3 was a result of growing <b>frustration</b> <b>with</b> Microsoft's policies for Xbox 360 content, including the difficulty of pushing patching and new content to players. Newell saw Sony's publication model as more open, allowing Steam-like features to be used on the console. Portal 2 was the first PlayStation 3 game to support a subset of features from Steamworks, including automatic updates, downloadable content, and community support. The game supports cross-platform play between the PlayStation 3, Windows, and OS X versions.|$|E
5|$|Bass guitarist and lyricist Roger Waters {{conceived}} the album {{as a rock}} opera during Pink Floyd's 1977 In the Flesh Tour, when his <b>frustration</b> <b>with</b> the audience became so acute that he spat on them. Its story, which follows themes of abandonment and personal isolation, explores Pink, a character whom Waters modeled after himself and the band's original leader Syd Barrett. Pink's life begins {{with the loss of}} his father during the Second World War, and continues with abuse from his schoolteachers, an overprotective mother, and the breakdown of his marriage; all contribute to his eventual self-imposed isolation from society, represented by a metaphorical wall. The band, who were then struggling with personal and financial difficulties, supported the idea. The album {{is considered one of the}} most recognisable concept albums.|$|E
5|$|By {{the fall}} of 1967, Peckinpah was {{rewriting}} the screenplay and preparing for the production. The principal photography was shot entirely on location in Mexico, most notably at the Hacienda Ciénaga del Carmen (deep in the desert between Torreón and Saltillo, Coahuila) and on the Rio Nazas. Peckinpah's epic work was inspired by his hunger to return to films, the violence seen in Arthur Penn's Bonnie and Clyde (1967), and America's growing <b>frustration</b> <b>with</b> the Vietnam War and what he {{perceived to be the}} utter lack of reality seen in Westerns up to that time. He set out to make a film which portrayed not only the vicious violence of the period, but as well the crude men attempting to survive the era. Multiple scenes attempted in Major Dundee, including slow motion action sequences (inspired by Akira Kurosawa's work in Seven Samurai (1954)), characters leaving a village as if in a funeral procession and the use of inexperienced locals as extras, would become fully realized in The Wild Bunch.|$|E
