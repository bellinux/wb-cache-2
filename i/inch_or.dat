5|$|Cores {{are often}} drilled {{in areas such}} as Antarctica and central Greenland where the {{temperature}} is almost never warm enough to cause melting, but the summer sun can still alter the snow. In polar areas, the sun is visible day and night during the local summer and invisible all winter. It can make some snow sublimate, leaving the top <b>inch</b> <b>or</b> so less dense. When the sun approaches its lowest point in the sky, the temperature drops and hoar frost forms on the top layer. Buried under the snow of following years, the coarse-grained hoar frost compresses into lighter layers than the winter snow. As a result, alternating bands of lighter and darker ice can be seen in an ice core.|$|E

50|$|There is {{a special}} {{vocabulary}} {{used to describe the}} length of pearl necklaces. While most other necklaces are simply referred to by their physical measurement, pearl necklaces are named by how low they hang when worn around the neck. A collar, measuring 10 to 13 <b>inches</b> <b>or</b> 25 to 33 cm in length, sits directly against the throat and does not hang down the neck at all; collars are often made up of multiple strands of pearls. Pearl chokers, measuring 14 to 16 <b>inches</b> <b>or</b> 35 to 41 cm in length, nestle just {{at the base of the}} neck. A strand called a princess length, measuring 17 to 19 <b>inches</b> <b>or</b> 43 to 48 cm in length, comes down to or just below the collarbone. A matinee length, measuring 20 to 24 <b>inches</b> <b>or</b> 50 to 60 cm in length, falls just above the breasts. An opera length, measuring 28 to 35 <b>inches</b> <b>or</b> 70 to 90 cm in length, will be long enough to reach the breastbone or sternum of the wearer; and longer still, a pearl rope, measuring more than 45 <b>inches</b> <b>or</b> 115 cm in length, is any length that falls down farther than an opera.|$|R
50|$|Magnolia biondii {{can grow}} up to 40 feet, or 12 meter. Its bark has a pale gray and smooth appearance. It {{produces}} simple leaf type with ovate shape. In general, leaf size varies and can be up to eight <b>inches,</b> <b>or</b> 20 centimeters, long and four <b>inches,</b> <b>or</b> ten centimeters, across. In addition, they are taper-pointed at the tip and wedge-shaped at the base with a short petiole of up to ¾ <b>inches,</b> <b>or</b> 2 centimeters. Furthermore, leaves are arranged in an alternative pattern. Leaves have pinnate venation. Moreover, stamens and carpels are spirally arranged.|$|R

25|$|The storm {{moved into}} Illinois and Wisconsin in the {{afternoon}} of December 1. An <b>inch</b> <b>or</b> two of snow fell in many areas, before a wintry mix of icy precipitation (up to a half-inch of ice accumulation) made things even more treacherous. Numerous highway accidents were reported, resulting in three deaths in Wisconsin and one in Illinois, as well as numerous injuries. In addition, a Mesa Airlines plane with 25 passengers slid off the runway at Dane County Regional Airport in Madison, but no injuries were reported. 400 flights were canceled at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, 28 at Midway International Airport and dozens more at Milwaukee's General Mitchell International Airport.

25|$|To Spain and the Teutonic {{countries}} of Europe {{we look for}} the most important object of church decoration, the retable; the Reformation accounting for the absence in England of any work of this iec kind. The magnificent altar-piece in Schleswig cathedral was carved by Hans Bruggerman, and consists, like many others, {{of a number of}} panels filled with figures standing some four or five deep. The figures in the foremost rows are carved entirely separate, and stand out by themselves, while the background is composed of figure work and architecture, etc., in diminishing perspective. The panels are grouped together under canopy work forming one harmonious whole. The genius of this great carver shows itself in the large variety of the facial expression of those wonderful figures all instinct with life and movement, In France few retables exist outside the museums. In the little church of Marissel, not far from Beauvais, there is a retable consisting of eleven panels, the crucifixion being, of course, the principal subject. And there is a beautiful example from Antwerp in the Muse Cluny, Paris; the pierced tracery work which decorates the upper part being {{a good example of the}} style composed of interlacing segments of circles so common on the Continent during late Gothic times and but seldom practised in England. ln Spain the cathedral of Valladolid was famous for its retable, and Alonso Cano and other sculptors frequently used wood for large statuary, which was painted in a very realistic way with the most startlingly lifelike effect. Denmark also possessed a school of able wood-carvers who imitated the great altar-pieces of Germany. A very large and well-carved example still exists in the cathedral of Roskilde. But besides these great altarpieces tiny little models were carved on a scale the minuteness of which staggers the beholder. Triptychs and shrines, etc., measuring but a few inches were filled in with tracery and figures that excite the utmost wonder. In the British Museum there is such a triptych (Flemish, I 511); the center panel, measuring an <b>inch</b> <b>or</b> two square, is crowded with figures in full relief and in diminishing perspective, after the custom of this period. This rests on a semicircular base which is carved with the Lord's Supper, and is further ornamented with figures and animals. The whole thing inclusive measures about 9 in. high, and, with the triptych wings open, 5 in. wide. The extraordinary delicacy and minuteness of detail of this microscopic work baffle description. There is another such a piece, also Flemish, in the Wallace collection, which rivals that just referred to in rni& applied talent. For, marvellous as these works of art are, they fail to satisfy. They make ones eyes ache, they worry one as to how the result could ever have been obtained, and after the first astonishment one must ever feel that the same work of art on a scale large enough for a cathedral could have been carved with half the labor.|$|E

500|$|Frogs in the {{families}} Bufonidae, Rhinophrynidae, and Microhylidae have short back legs {{and tend to}} walk rather than jump.

In an experiment, Fowler's toad (Bufo fowleri) was placed on a treadmill which was turned at varying speeds.
