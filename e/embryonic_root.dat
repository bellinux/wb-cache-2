5|$|The {{roots of}} a tree serve to anchor {{it to the ground}} and gather water and {{nutrients}} to transfer to all parts of the tree. They are also used for reproduction, defence, survival, energy storage and many other purposes. The radicle or <b>embryonic</b> <b>root</b> is the first part of a seedling to emerge from the seed during the process of germination. This develops into a taproot which goes straight downwards. Within a few weeks lateral roots branch {{out of the side of}} this and grow horizontally through the upper layers of the soil. In most trees, the taproot eventually withers away and the wide-spreading laterals remain. Near the tip of the finer roots are single cell root hairs. These are in immediate contact with the soil particles and can absorb water and nutrients such as potassium in solution. The roots require oxygen to respire and only a few species such as the mangrove and the pond cypress (Taxodium ascendens) can live in permanently waterlogged soil.|$|E

Systemic acquired resistance (SAR) is the main defence mechanism activated in plants in response to pathogen attack. Here, we report the effects of benzo(1, 2, 3) thiadiazole- 7 -carbothioic acid-s-methyl ester (BTH), a SAR chemical inducer, on the expression profile of C. arabica. Two cDNA libraries were constructed from the mRNA isolated from leaves and <b>embryonic</b> <b>roots</b> to create 1587 nonredundant expressed sequence tags (ESTs). We developed a cDNA microarray containing 1506 ESTs from the leaves and <b>embryonic</b> <b>roots,</b> and 48 NBS-LRR (nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat) gene fragments derived from 2 specific genomic libraries. Competitive hybridization between untreated and BTH-treated leaves resulted in 55 genes that were significantly overexpressed and 16 genes that were significantly underexpressed. In the roots, 37 and 42 genes were over and underexpressed, respectively. A general shift in metabolism from housekeeping to defence occurred in the leaves and roots after BTH treatment. We observed a systemic increase in pathogenesis-related protein synthesis, in the oxidative burst, and in the cell wall strengthening processes. Moreover, responses in the roots and leaves varied significantly...|$|R

The collection provides both {{an overview of the}} field, positioning it within a social and commercial context with reference to other forms of digital and pictorial art, and to the mainstream videogames industry. Videogames and Art details specialized areas of the subject such as machinima and games console artwork and includes a series of individual interviews with both established and emerging videogame artists. In addition to the aesthetic design and production of this area of digital art, contributors examine works of politically orientated videogame art which depict a critical engagement with the social or cultural issues of their time. Following this review of the genre’s artistic elements, the book diverts into a broader critical appraisal of the commercial games industry, posing several polemical pieces upon the present quality and originality of video games in general.

500|$|In {{the second}} chapter, [...] "Taking Root", the <b>embryonic</b> <b>root</b> emerges {{through a small}} opening in the seed coat and through cell division, aided by plant hormones, it grows downward. Water and {{nutrients}} enter the root by osmosis and are transported to the seedling. A symbiotic relationship develops between the roots and the truffles. The roots give its extra sugars to the truffles, which it uses for energy, and the truffles assist the roots' uptake of water and nutrients. From excess starches and nutrients gathered by the root, a stem similar to the root but surrounded with thin, grayish bark, grows upwards. As the starch reserves are exhausted, its first needles sprout and photosynthesis begins. The tree anchors itself with a deep taproot and a web of roots begin to grow laterally. Some roots develop symbiotic relationships with near-by red alders which excel at nitrogen-fixation but lack the storage capacity that the Douglas-fir can offer. In early April of every year, a new layer grows between the bark and wood. As this new layer takes over transportation of fluids throughout the tree, last year's layer of cells die and form a ring in the wood.|$|E

30|$|Maize {{root system}} {{development}} has been divided into two stages that correspond to embryonic and post-embryonic growth (Feldman 1994). Post-embryonic root development begins approximately 1  week after the primary and seminal roots emerge, as branching of the <b>embryonic</b> <b>roots</b> produces lateral roots that can continue to branch. Lateral roots together with root hairs {{play an important role}} in the absorption of nutrients and water by increasing the root’s surface area (Hochholdinger et al. 2004; Gaudin et al. 2011). Approximately 2  weeks after germination the post-embryonic root system becomes prominent, as the coleoptilar node begins giving rise to the crown roots, a type of shoot-borne root that develops from nodes below the soil surface. Brace roots, the second type of shoot-borne roots, develop from nodes above the soil surface several weeks later as the plant matures (Hochholdinger et al. 2004). Crown roots develop from about six compact underground nodes, while the first two or three above ground nodes generate brace roots (Hoppe et al. 1986). Both of these types of roots also exhibit lateral branching, although the brace roots will not branch until they penetrate the soil.|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackgroundWhereas the {{majority}} of animals develop toward a predetermined body plan, plants show iterative growth and continually produce new organs and structures from actively dividing meristems. This raises an intriguing question: How are these newly developed organs patterned? In Arabidopsis embryos, radial symmetry is broken by the bisymmetric specification of the cotyledons in the apical domain. Subsequently, this bisymmetry is propagated to the root promeristem. ResultsHere we present a mutually inhibitory feedback loop between auxin and cytokinin that sets distinct boundaries of hormonal output. Cytokinins promote the bisymmetric distribution of the PIN-FORMED (PIN) auxin efflux proteins, which channel auxin toward a central domain. High auxin promotes transcription of the cytokinin signaling inhibitor AHP 6, which closes the interaction loop. This bisymmetric auxin response domain specifies the differentiation of protoxylem in a bisymmetric pattern. In <b>embryonic</b> <b>roots,</b> cytokinin is required to translate a bisymmetric auxin response in the cotyledons to a bisymmetric vascular pattern in the root promeristem. ConclusionsOur results present an interactive feedback loop between hormonal signaling and transport by which small biases in hormonal input are propagated into distinct signaling domains to specify the vascular pattern in the root meristem. It is an intriguing possibility that such a mechanism could transform radial patterns and allow continuous vascular connections between other newly emerging organs...|$|R

This forms a mass of fine roots, with no distinct tap root, because the <b>embryonic</b> <b>root</b> dies back while the plant is still young and growing.|$|E
40|$|Congenital heart defects {{remain the}} most common birth defect in humans, {{occurring}} in over 1 % of live births. The high prevalence of cardiac malformations can be partially attributed to limited knowledge regarding the <b>embryonic</b> <b>roots</b> of the disease. A variety of congenital heart defects are thought to arise from combinations of genetic and epigenetic factors. In an effort to better understand this dynamic relationship, our study explores the structure and function of the developing heart and valves and examines hemodynamic factors influencing valvulogenesis. In order to study cardiac mechanics, we employed novel high-speed confocal microscopy and four-dimensional visualization techniques. A dynamic four-dimensional dataset describing heart and valve development along with blood flow patterns throughout cardiac morphogenesis is presented. Utilizing newly developed tools, we propose a novel pumping mechanism in the valveless embryonic heart tube via elastic wave propagation and reflection. We show that this form of pumping leads to oscillatory shear stresses in the developing atrio-ventricular canal, a phenomenon that had not previously been documented. An in vivo method to modulate trans-valvular oscillatory flows is described and used to test our hypothesis that oscillatory shear stress across the primitive valve cushions stimulates heart valve leaflet formation. Our results suggest hemodynamic forces contribute to valvulogenesis and enhance our understanding of normal and abnormal heart valve development...|$|R
40|$|Aims: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{characterize}} redox changes in the nuclei and cytosol occurring during the mitotic cell cycle in the <b>embryonic</b> <b>roots</b> of germinating Arabidopsis seedlings, and to determine how redox cycling was modified in mutants with a decreased capacity for ascorbate synthesis. Results: Using an in vivo reduction-oxidation (redox) reporter (roGFP 2), we show that transient oxidation of the cytosol and the nuclei occurred at G 1 in the synchronized dividing cells of the Arabidopsis root apical meristem, with reduction at G 2 and mitosis. This redox cycle was absent from low ascorbate mutants in which nuclei were significantly more oxidized than controls. The cell cycle-dependent increase in nuclear size was impaired in the ascorbate-deficient mutants, which had fewer cells per unit area in the root proliferation zone. The transcript profile of the dry seeds and size of the imbibed seeds was strongly influenced by low ascorbate but germination, dormancy release and seed aging characteristics were unaffected. Innovation: These data demonstrate the presence of a redox cycle within the plant cell cycle and that the redox state of the nuclei is an important factor in cell cycle progression. Conclusions: Controlled oxidation is a key feature of the early stages of the plant cell cycle. However, sustained mild oxidation restricts nuclear functions and impairs progression through the cell cycle leading to fewer cells in the root apical meristem...|$|R

Currently, botulinum neurotoxin serotype A (BoNT⁄A) is commonly used {{for the treatment of}} many disorders, such as hyperactive musculoskeletal disorders, dystonia, and pain. However, the effectiveness of BoNT⁄A for pain alleviation and the mechanisms that mediate the analgesic effects of BoNT⁄A remain unclear. To define the antinociceptive mechanisms by which BoNT/A functions, the interactions between BoNT⁄A and the transient receptor potential vanilloid subfamily 1 (TRPV 1) were investigated using immunofluorescence, co-immunoprecipitation, and western blot analysis in primary mouse <b>embryonic</b> dorsal <b>root</b> ganglion neuronal cultures. 1) Three-week-old cultured dorsal root ganglion neurons highly expressed transient TRPV 1, synaptic vesicle 2 A (SV 2 A) and synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP- 25). SV 2 A and SNAP- 25 are the binding receptor and target protein, respectively, of BoNT⁄A. 2) TRPV 1 colocalized with both BoNT⁄A and cleaved SNAP- 25 when BoNT⁄A was added to dorsal root ganglia neuronal cultures. 3) After 24 hours of BoNT⁄A treatment (1 nmol⁄l), both TRPV 1 and BoNT⁄A positive bands were detected in western blots of immunoprecipitated pellets. 4) Blocking TRPV 1 with a specific antibody decreased the cleavage of SNAP- 25 by BoNT⁄A. BoNT/A interacts with TRPV 1 both structurally and functionally in cultured mouse <b>embryonic</b> dorsal <b>root</b> ganglion neurons.

50|$|A {{seedling}} is a {{young plant}} sporophyte developing out of a plant embryo from a seed. Seedling development starts with germination of the seed. A typical young seedling consists of three main parts: the radicle (<b>embryonic</b> <b>root),</b> the hypocotyl (embryonic shoot), and the cotyledons (seed leaves). The two classes of flowering plants (angiosperms) are distinguished by their numbers of seed leaves: monocotyledons (monocots) have one blade-shaped cotyledon, whereas dicotyledons (dicots) possess two round cotyledons. Gymnosperms are more varied. For example, pine seedlings have up to eight cotyledons. The seedlings of some flowering plants have no cotyledons at all. These {{are said to be}} acotyledons.|$|E

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND AND AIMS: The root {{meristem}} of the Arabidopsis thaliana mature embryo is {{a highly}} organized structure in which individual cell shape and size must be regulated in co-ordination with the surrounding cells. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the role of the AUX 1 LAX family of auxin import carriers during the establishment of the <b>embryonic</b> <b>root</b> cell pattern. METHODS: The radicle apex of single and multiple aux 1 lax mutant mature embryos was used to evaluate the effect of this gene family upon <b>embryonic</b> <b>root</b> organization and root cap size, cell number and cell size. KEY RESULTS: It was demonstrated here that mutations within the AUX 1 LAX family are associated with changes in cell pattern establishment in the embryonic quiescent centre and columella. aux 1 lax mutants have a larger radicle root cap than the wild type and this is associated with a significant increase in the root-cap cell number, average cell size, or both. Extreme disorganization of the radicle apex was observed among quadruple aux 1 lax 1 lax 2 lax 3 mutant embryos, but not in single aux 1 null or in lax 1, lax 2 and lax 3 single mutants, indicating redundancy within the AUX 1 LAX family.
