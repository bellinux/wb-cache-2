5000|$|The {{first human}} {{trial of the}} female oral {{contraceptive}} was conducted by Gregory Pincus and John Rock in Massachusetts on a test group of 50 women. The trial {{was described as a}} <b>fertility</b> <b>study</b> to avoid state legal interruption of the trial. Massachusetts at the time had strong legislation against birth control. In the 1950s in Massachusetts it was a felony to [...] "exhibit, sell, prescribe, provide, or give out information" [...] on birth control. Rather than distributing birth control, women were receiving hysterectomies to avoid continuing to get pregnant and have birth. Pincus and Rock felt confident that the combined oral contraceptive pill they had developed was ready for consumers in the United States. Once the Food and Drug Administration approved, the drug could potentially be released in the U.S., but they could not get the approval of the FDA without a larger clinical trial. In 1955 they developed a larger clinical trial of the drug, and tested it on women in Puerto Rico. The pharmaceutical company G. D. Searle & Company created the pills for the trial.After the trials in Puerto Rico, the drug was approved in the U.S. in 1957 for consumer use as a medication to treat severe menstrual side-effects. The drug was approved as a female oral contraceptive, the first in the U.S., in May 1960. G.D. Searle and company profited greatly from widespread sales of the product, although the company was initially extremely hesitant {{to be associated with the}} trials in any way.|$|E

40|$|Symmetry {{in human}} male faces {{may be a}} cue to {{heritable}} fitness benefits and is found attractive. Preferences for facial masculinity, another proposed marker of genetic quality, {{have been found to}} vary in ways that may maximise evolutionary relevant benefits and masculinity is found to be of increased attractiveness at peak fertility across the menstrual cycle. Here we show that women prefer more symmetric faces at peak <b>fertility</b> (<b>Study</b> 1) and that such shifting preferences may be potentially strategic preferences as we found them to occur only for judgements concerning short-term relations and when women already had a partner (Study 2). Such preferences potentially indicate a strategy that maximises the quality of extra-pair/short-term partners or a quality dependent response to hormones. Such strategic preferences for symmetry may support the role of symmetry in signalling potential good-gene benefits. © 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a new version of}} dynamic time warping for samples of observed event times that are modeled as time-warped intensity processes. Our approach is devel- oped within a framework where for each experimental unit or subject in a sample, one observes a random number of event times or random locations. As in our setting the number of observed events differs from subject to subject, usual landmark align- ment methods that require the number of events to be the same across subjects are not feasible. We address this challenge by applying dynamic time warping, initially by aligning the event times for pairs of subjects, regardless of whether the numbers of observed events within the considered pair of subjects match. The information about pairwise alignments is then combined to extract an overall alignment of the events for each subject across the entire sample. This overall alignment provides a useful description of event data and {{can be used as a}} pre-processing step for subse- quent analysis. The method is illustrated with a historical <b>fertility</b> <b>study</b> and with on-line auction data...|$|E
40|$|Comparisons {{of growth}} {{analysis}} functions within and among experiments are often confounded by sources of variation {{other than those}} imposed by treatment. we suggest use of a temperature index, such as modified growing degree days, as the divisor in growth functions to facilitate treatment comparisons within certain experiments and to reduce the effects of differing temperature regimes among experiments on these comparisons. Three experiments were identified to provide data to analyze this new approach.

40|$|The {{function}} of life history (LH) strategies acquired {{in response to}} ambient conditions during childhood is to maximize reproductive success. Mate preferences that facilitate reproductive goals should thus vary with LH strategies. In two studies, male participants completed measures of LH and mate preferences regarding fertility and good genes, fidelity and good mothers, and modernity and good provisioning (Study 1) or a face identification task designed to assess perceptual sensitivity toward neoteny representing <b>fertility</b> (<b>Study</b> 2). Results showed that men identified as of fast LH preferred physically attractive women and prioritized fertility and good genes over fidelity and good mothers in their mate selections. Moreover, they were sensitive to female fertility features, as evidenced by them spending less time identifying odd faces that differed from other faces in terms of neoteny. These findings suggest that men of faster LH {{are more likely to}} invest in mating than parenting and preferred mates of high reproductive potential over those representing high parental investment.

40|$|SUMMARY. This paper reviews {{several issues}} and {{statistical}} approaches for assessing risks from reproductive toxicants {{with emphasis on}} the study designs, data analysis techniques and most appropriate transformations for the response measures. Importance of time as a critical variable in this endeavor is also discussed. Selecting dibromochloropropane(DBCP) as a case study, the evi-dence of the reproductive risk of this toxicant from epidemiological studies are reviewed first. This {{is followed by a}} reanalysis of data from a rabbit inhalation <b>fertility</b> <b>study</b> where sperm concentration from individual rabbits exposed to one of four doses of DBCP vapor from pre-exposure, exposure and post-exposure phases constitute the response measure. The analysis use three transforma-tions, logarithmic, cube root, and a transformation via additivity and variance stabilization and two longitudinal data analyses techniques using random-effects models and generalized estimating equations. Specific benchmark doses are calculated for alteration of spermatogenesis. Results show that the effects of DBCP on the sperm concentration varies within the period of experimentation, suggesting that chronic experiments must be continued until the estimate of the dose parameter stabilizes. 1...|$|E
