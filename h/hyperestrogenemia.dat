40|$|Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is an orexigenic neuropeptide {{produced}} by neurons of the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA). Because genetic MCH deficiency induces hypophagia {{and loss of}} body fat, we hypothesized that MCH neurons may represent a specific LHA pathway that, when inhibited, contributes to the pathogenesis of certain anorexia syndromes. To test this hypothesis, we measured behavioral, hormonal, and hypothalamic neuropeptide responses in two models of <b>hyperestrogenemia</b> in male rats, a highly reproducible anorexia paradigm. Whereas estrogen-induced weight loss engaged multiple systems that normally favor recovery of lost weight, the expected increase of MCH mRNA expression induced by energy restriction was selectively and completely abolished. These findings identify MCH neurons as specific targets of estrogen action and suggest that inhibition of these neurons {{may contribute to the}} hypophagi...|$|E
40|$|Hormonal and {{energetic}} status was studied in 168 patients with endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer. The comparative analysis of hormonal status (LH, FSH, estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, prolactin, SHBG), energetic status (leptin, grelin, insulin) and {{the assessment of}} lipid and carbohydrate metabolisms were carried out for patients with proliferative processes in the endometrium with the evidence of metabolic syndrome and without it. The study showed that the changes in hormonal status were characterized by a high frequency of disturbances with development of <b>hyperestrogenemia</b> (72 %), hypertestosteronemia (65 %), hyperinsulinemia (81 %) and hyperleptinemia (68 %). Moreover, the LH level and LH/FSH index were increased and FSH and progerterone levels were decreased. Significant changes in both carbohydrate (hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance) and lipid (hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia) metabolisms were revealed. The mechanisms of hormonal correlations that underlie pathological endometrial process were described...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} case of {{ureteral}} endometriosis in a 48 -year-old postmenopausal patient who was hospitalized complaining of right flank pain & microhematuria. She had no bladder irritability. She had a past history of simple hysterectomy and left oophorectomy because of adenomyomatosis. At that time, right ovary and other pelvic organs were normal. Physical examination revealed slight swelling of the liver without tenderness. Laboratory data at admission revealed severe liver dysfunction due to liver cirrhosis. Excretory urography demonstrated right hydronephroureterosis and severe stricture of the right lower ureter. Right ureteral catheterization demonstrated {{a high degree of}} stricture at the distal third. Cytology of right pelvic urine was negative. Right nephroureterectomy was done because long segment of right lower ureter adhered to the peritoneum tightly and we could not rule out ureteral cancer. Pathological diagnosis was extrinsic endometriosis of the right ureter. Ureteral endometriosis is rare and postmenopausal endometriosis is also rare. In our case <b>hyperestrogenemia</b> caused by liver cirrhosis might {{have played a role in}} the genesis and progression of endometriosis...|$|E
40|$|Rationale: Insulin {{resistance}} {{associated with}} <b>hyperestrogenemias</b> occurs in gestational diabetes mellitus, polycystic ovary syndrome, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, estrogen therapies, metabolic syndrome and obesity. The {{mechanism by which}} insulin and estrogen interact is unknown. We hypothesize that estrogen binds directly to insulin and the insulin receptor producing insulin resistance. Objectives: To determine the binding constants of steroid hormones to insulin, the insulin receptor, and insulin-like peptides derived from the insulin receptor; and to investigate the effect of estrogens on the binding of insulin to its receptor. Methods: Ultraviolet spectroscopy, capillary electrophoresis and NMR demonstrated estrogen binding to insulin and its receptor. Horse-radish peroxidase-linked insulin was used in an ELISA-like procedure to measure the effect of estradiol on binding of insulin to its receptor. Measurements: Binding constants for estrogens to insulin and the insulin receptor were determined by concentration-dependent spectral shifts. The effect of estradiol on insulin-HRP binding to its receptor was determined by shifts in the insulin binding curve. Main Results: Estradiol bound to insulin with a Kd of 12 x 10 - 9 M and to the insulin receptor with a Kd of 24 x 10 - 9 M, while other hormones had significantly less affinity. 200 nM estradiol shifted the binding curve of insulin to its receptor 0. 8 log units to the right. Conclusions: Estradiol concentrations in many hyperestrogenemic syndromes are sufficient to interfere with insulin binding to its receptor producing significant insulin resistance...|$|R
40|$|An {{increase}} in the number of (CAG) n repeats in the first coding exon of the androgen receptor (AR) gene has been strongly associated with Kennedy disease (KD) (spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy). This is an X-linked hereditary disorder characterized by motoneuron degeneration occurring in adults together with gynecomastia and <b>hyperestrogenemia.</b> We have performed AR gene molecular analysis in several members of a large family with KD as well as in 25 sporadic patients suffering from heterogeneous motoneuron disease (MND). An {{increase in}} the length of the (CAG) n repeats was detected, as expected, in all the affected males and in obligatory carrier females, some of which had minor signs of lower motoneuron involvement. There was only one possible exception, one young male with initial signs of the disease, who had an apparent normal length allele. An increased pathological allele was also found in 3 patients with MND. This indicates that the analysis of (CAG) n repeats of the AR gene plays a role in the differential diagnosis of this heterogeneous group of neurological diseases...|$|E
40|$|Objective. Prolactin {{plays an}} {{important}} role on the disease flare of postpartum SLE patients. 76 pregnant SLE patients were enrolled in this study to evaluate the efficacy of bromocriptine (an inhibitor of prolactin secretion) on preventing the postpartum disease relapse. Methods. Patients were randomly divided into the treatment group (bromocriptine, 2. 5 [*]mg oral, twice a day for 14 days after delivery) and the control group. All the patients were followed up for 12 months. Clinical features were recorded every 4 weeks. Serum prolactin and estradiol levels were measured at the second week and the second month after delivery. The endpoint of the study was disease relapse and defined when SLEDAI score increased by ≥ 3 points from the antenatal baseline. Results. (1) Serum levels of prolactin and estradiol decreased significantly in bromocriptine treatment group at the second week (P< 0. 001) and second month (P< 0. 05) after delivery compared to control group. (2) The relapse rate of the treatment group was lower than the control group (χ 2 = 4. 68, P= 0. 0305). Conclusions. Two weeks of oral bromocriptine treatment in postpartum SLE patients may relieve the disease from hyperprolactinemia and <b>hyperestrogenemia</b> and may be beneficial in preventing the patients from disease relapse...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{review the}} current {{literature}} on the safety of using exogenous estrogens in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Method: A MEDLINE search for articles published between 1970 and 2000 regarding the relationship between estrogens and SLE was performed. Emphasis was put on human studies, treatment trials, and epidemiologic surveys. Results: The use of exogenous estrogens in healthy women {{increases the risk of}} SLE development. For patients with established SLE, a hypoestrogenemic state appears to be protective against severe flares, whereas exogenous estrogen administration or <b>hyperestrogenemia</b> induced by hormonal manipulation may exacerbate the disease in certain individuals. Both the use of oral contraceptives and the use of hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) increase the chance of venous thromboembolism. The presence of antiphospholipid antibodies may aggravate the risk of thrombosis in SLE. In retrospective studies, HRT appears to be well tolerated in postmenopausal SLE patients. Conclusions: There are no prospective data that show a deleterious effect of exogenous estrogens on disease activity in human SLE. Oral contraceptives may be considered for patients with SLE in the absence of active nephritis or antiphospholipid antibodies. The slight increase in venous thromboembolic risk should not be the chief deterrent to the use of HRT in postmenopausal SLE patients, considering its various health benefits. Copyright © 2001 by W.

40|$|Liver cirrhosis, {{a highly}} {{prevalent}} chronic disease, is frequently associated with endocrine dysfunctions, {{notably in the}} gonadal axis. We evaluated lactotroph population by immunohistochemistry, gonadotropins and prolactin by immunoradiometric assay and testosterone and estradiol by radioimmunoassay in adult male Wistar rats with cirrhosis induced by carbon tetrachloride. No significant difference in mean ± SEM percentages of lactotrophs was found between cirrhotic animals and controls (N = 12, mean 18. 95 ± 1. 29 %). Although {{there was no significant}} difference between groups in mean serum levels of prolactin (control: 19. 2 ± 4 ng/mL), luteinizing hormone (control: 1. 58 ± 0. 43 ng/mL), follicle-stimulating hormone (control: 19. 11 ± 2. 28 ng/mL), estradiol (control: 14. 65 ± 3. 22 pg/mL), and total testosterone (control: 138. 41 ± 20. 07 ng/dL), 5 of the cirrhotic animals presented a hormonal profile consistent with hypogonadism, all of them pointing to a central origin of this dysfunction. Four of these animals presented high levels of estradiol and/or prolactin, with a significant correlation between these two hormones in both groups (r = 0. 54; P = 0. 013). It was possible to detect the presence of central hypogonadism in this model of cirrhotic animals. The <b>hyperestrogenemia</b> and hyperprolactinemia found in some hypogonadal animals suggest a role in the genesis of hypogonadism, and in the present study they were not associated with lactotroph hyperplasia...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA unique non-laying {{strain of}} {{chickens}} with heritable hyperlipidemia and aortic atherosclerosis was first described in 1974. Subsequent work {{established that the}} phenotype results from a naturally occurring point mutation in the gene specifying the very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) receptor, a 95 -kDa membrane protein which normally mediates the massive uptake of the main circulating hepatically-synthesized yolk precursors, VLDL and vitellogenin. As a result, hens of the mutant strain termed “restricted ovulator” (R/O) have approximately 5 -fold elevations in circulating cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations compared with normal layers, and hepatic lipogenesis and cholesterogenesis are markedly attenuated due to feedback inhibition. R/O hens also exhibit <b>hyperestrogenemia,</b> hypoprogesteronemia, elevated circulating gonadotropins, and up-regulated pituitary progesterone receptor mRNA and isoforms. The ovaries of R/O hens are abnormal in that they lack a follicular hierarchy and contain many small preovulatory follicles of various colors, shapes, and sizes. However, since R/O hens occasionally lay eggs, {{it is possible that}} endocytic receptors other than the VLDL receptor may be able to facilitate oocyte growth and/or that yolk precursor uptake can occur via a nonspecific bulk process. A mammalian model of impaired fecundity with abnormal lipoprotein metabolism also has been described, but different mechanisms are likely responsible for its reproductive dysfunction. Nevertheless, as our understanding of the molecular physiology and biochemistry of avian oocyte growth continues to expand, in part due to studies of the R/O model, new analogies may emerge between avian and mammalian systems, which ultimately could help to answer important questions in reproductive biology...|$|E
40|$|International audienceTriggering factors {{seem to be}} {{multiple}} in the pathogenesis of facial hyperpigmentation (FH), as dark skin types, pregnancy, sun exposure [...] . The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the risk factors for FH in Maghrebian population. Patients with FH were included in a case-controlled study. Following data were recorded: age, sex, parity, phototype, FH and hormonal-related history, endocrinological features, sunlight exposure, specific cultural behaviours, use of topic corticosteroids and sunscreens. One hundred women (mean age 29. 5 ± 13. 7 years) were included with 200 age-matched controls. Duration of FH was 32. 9 ± 42. 2 months. There was a statistically significant relation between FH and hirsutism (P = 0. 009), troubles of menstruations (P = 0. 008), but not with acne (P = 0. 23) and contraceptive oral (P = 0. 06) drugs or with history of thyroid disorders (P = 0. 13). For cultural factors, there were a statistical significant relation with rubbing by flannel glove (P < 0. 05), use of dark soap (P = 0. 009) and traditional masks (P < 0. 05) but both groups were used to go to hammam. A strong relation was observed between FH and use of topical corticosteroids: 40 % in the FH group vs. 5 % in the control group (P < 0. 05). Both groups used to apply sunscreens: 70 % in the FH group and 67 % in the control group where as there were no differences in the two groups for sun exposure. No statistical differences were observed regarding to age, phototypes and grade of parity. Our study demonstrated a relation between FH and <b>hyperestrogenemia,</b> rubbing with a friction glove, use of moroccan traditional masks and application of topical steroids. The eviction of all these triggering factors could be an adjuvant recommendation in the assessment of FH...|$|E
40|$|Uterine {{leiomyoma}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} common benign hyperproliferative diseases of the female reproductive organs. According to the literature, its prevalence among women of reproductive age is estimated to be approximately 20 – 40 %. Moreover, it is diagnosed more often (up to 75 - 85 %) when carrying out morphological investigations of macro specimens after hysterectomy. In recent years the proportion of young patients with this pathology has increased. For a long period of time radical hysterectomy has been the most common method used to treat the disease. During the past decades the possibilities of organ-preserving treatment of the disease expanded due to the achievements of modern pharmaceutical industry and implementation of new technologies. As a result, surgical interventions themselves changed and the proportion of surgeries such as conservative myomectomy, uterine artery embolization, hysteroscopic resection of submucous fibroid increased. The data on surgical interventions allowed us to eradicate the symptoms of uterine leiomyoma preserving fertility in many patients, however, the risk of tumor recurrence and growth is still present. The recurrence rate after organ-preserving surgeries remains high and, according to the results of various studies, accounts for 2 - 50 % of cases. Considering the above-mentioned data prevention of tumor recurrence is of great relevance. Based on the results of diagnostic program including endocrinologic, immunological and morphological investigations there was found that in women with isolated uterine leiomyoma dyshormonal disease, inflammatory processes of the genital organs, chronic endometritis, pathology of the receptor apparatus of uterine tissues occur more often; hyperprolactinemia, relative or absolute <b>hyperestrogenemia</b> and increased production of antibodies are more often diagnosed in women with uterine leiomyoma and co-existent dyshormonal pathology of the mammary and thyroid gland. According to the literature, in isolated uterine leiomyoma therapy aimed at correcting local factors including anti-inflammatory therapy, local hormone therapy or uterine artery embolization is recommended. In comorbidity correction of systemic metabolic disorders, namely anti-stress therapy, systemic hormone therapy, immune system correction, treatment of co-existent somatic pathology which may include local use of hormones and organ-preserving surgical interventions should be performed first of all. Thus, modern medicine has in its arsenal various organ-preserving, conservative, surgical including minimally invasive methods of treatment implementation of which allows us to improve quality of life in such patients as well as to enhance fertility and reproductive health of women...|$|E
