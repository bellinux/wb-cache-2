25|$|The GMDSS (Global Maritime Distress and Safety System) officer role {{consists}} of performing tests and maintenance, and ensuring the proper log-keeping on the ship's Global Maritime Distress Safety System equipment. Safety equipment includes <b>Emergency</b> <b>Position-Indicating</b> Radio Beacons, a NAVTEX unit, INMARSAT consoles, various radios, Search and Rescue Transponders, and Digital Selective Calling systems.|$|R
50|$|The International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) and the International Life-Saving Appliance Code (LSA) {{requires}} certain {{emergency equipment}} {{be carried on}} each lifeboat and liferaft used on international voyages.

50|$|In {{addition}} to an altimeter, compass, and an airspeed indicator, gliders are often equipped with a variometer, turn and bank indicator and an airband radio (transceiver), each {{of which may be}} required in some countries. An <b>Emergency</b> <b>Position-Indicating</b> Radio Beacon (ELT) may also be fitted into the glider to reduce search and rescue time in case of an accident.|$|R
50|$|After the 1991 Perfect Storm, the {{commercial}} fishing vessel Andrea Gails <b>emergency</b> <b>position-indicating</b> radio beacon (EPIRB) was discovered {{on the shore}} of Sable Island on November 6, 1991, nine days after the last transmission from the crew. Other items found were fuel drums, a fuel tank, an empty life raft, and some other flotsam. All crew members perished and were never found.|$|R
5000|$|Signaling {{devices are}} useful if the kitesurfer {{needs to be}} rescued. This may {{be as simple as}} a whistle {{attached}} to the knife, or retro-reflective tape applied to the helmet. Some kitesurfers carry a mobile phone or two-way radio in a waterproof pouch to use in an emergency. A small <b>Emergency</b> <b>Position-Indicating</b> Radio Beacon (EPIRB) can be carried and activated to send out a distress signal.|$|R
50|$|Gray's {{boat was}} {{equipped}} with an automatically deployable EPIRB (<b>Emergency</b> <b>Position-Indicating</b> Radio Beacon), which should have deployed and begun transmitting the instant his vessel sank. The area around the Farallon Islands where Gray was sailing is well north of the East-West ship channel used by freighters entering and leaving San Francisco Bay. The weather was clear that day and no ships reported striking his boat, nor were any distress radio transmissions reported.|$|R
50|$|In addition, a {{distress}} can be signaled using automated {{radio signals}} {{such as a}} Search and Rescue Transponder (SART) which responds to 9 GHz radar signal, or an <b>Emergency</b> <b>Position-Indicating</b> Radio Beacon (EPIRB) which operates in the 406 MHz radio frequency. EPIRB signals are received and processed by a constellation of satellites known as COSPAS-SARSAT. Older EPIRBs which use 121.5 MHz are obsolete. Many regulators require vessels which proceed offshore to carry an EPIRB.|$|R
5000|$|On November 6, 1991, Andrea Gail's <b>emergency</b> <b>position-indicating</b> {{radio beacon}} (EPIRB) was {{discovered}} {{washed up on}} the shore of Sable Island in Nova Scotia. The EPIRB was designed to automatically send out a distress signal upon contact with sea water, but the Canadian Coast Guard personnel who found the beacon [...] "did not conclusively verify whether the control switch was in the on or off position". Authorities called off the search for the missing vessel on November 9, 1991, due to the low probability of crew survival.|$|R
2500|$|On 28 February, {{the ship}} {{was the subject of}} news reports in Iceland and Ireland, and a caution to smaller vessels was issued. On 1 March 2013, Irish media {{reported}} that a signal from the vessel's <b>emergency</b> <b>position-indicating</b> radio beacon (EPIRB) was received from 700 nautical miles off the Kerry coast, still in international waters. An EPIRB starts transmitting only when the device is exposed to water, leading experts to speculate that the ship may have sunk. [...] The Irish Air Corps was expected to continue to monitor the region.|$|R
50|$|VMS {{itself can}} help in search and rescue (SAR), {{especially}} when the SAR organization participates in the Global Maritime Distress Safety System(GMDSS). Some VMS have built-in <b>Emergency</b> <b>Position-Indicating</b> Radio Beacons (EPIRB), or SART capability although a dedicated VMS unit {{may not be able}} to have an emergency beacon that automatically floats to the surface and starts transmitting when it detects it is in salt water. At the very least, the SAR agency can get a last reported location of the vessel, and perhaps its course, from the FMC.|$|R

50|$|More backcountry adventurers {{are also}} {{carrying}} Satellite Electronic Notification Devices (SEND) to quickly alert rescuers to a problem. These devices include the SPOT Messenger, <b>Emergency</b> <b>Position-Indicating</b> Radio Beacon (EPIRB) or Personal Locating Beacons (PLBs) containing the Global Positioning System (GPS). This device can quickly notify {{search and rescue}} of an emergency and the general location (within 100 yards), {{but only if the}} person with the EPIRB has survived the avalanche and can activate the device. Survivors should also try to use a mobile phone to notify emergency personnel. Unlike the other devices mentioned above, the mobile phone (or satellite phone) provides two-way communications with rescuers.|$|R
40|$|The {{background}} {{behind the}} congressional legislation {{that led to}} the requirement for the Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) and the <b>Emergency</b> <b>Position-Indicating</b> Radio Beacon (EPIRB) to be installed on certain types of aircraft and inspected marine vessels respectively is discussed. The DAL problem is discussed for existing ELT and EPIRB equipped aircraft and ships. It is recognized that the DAL requirement for CONUS and Alaska and the maritime regions are not identical. In order to address the serious DAL problem which currently exists in CONUS and Alaska, a low orbiting satellite system evolves as the most viable and cost effective alternative that satisfies the overall SAR system design requirements. A satellite system designed {{to meet the needs of}} the maritime regions could be either low orbiting or geostationary. The conclusions drawn from this report support the recommendation to proceed with the implementation of a SAR orbiting satellite system...|$|R
50|$|Cospas-Sarsat is an {{international}} satellite-based search and rescue system, established by Canada, France, the United States, and Russia. These four countries jointly helped develop the 406 MHz <b>Emergency</b> <b>Position-Indicating</b> Radio Beacon (EPIRB), {{an element of the}} GMDSS designed to operate with Cospas-Sarsat system. These automatic-activating EPIRBs, now required on SOLAS ships, commercial fishing vessels, and all passenger ships, are designed to transmit to alert rescue coordination centers via the satellite system from anywhere in the world. The original COSPAS/SARSAT system used polar orbiting satellites but in recent years the system has been expanded to also include 4 geostationary satellites. Newest designs incorporate GPS receivers to transmit highly accurate positions (within about 20 metres) of the distress position. The original COSPAS/SARSAT satellites could calculate EPIRB position to within about 3 nmi km by using Doppler techniques. By the end of 2010 EPIRB manufacturers may be offering AIS (automatic identification system) enabled beacons. The serviceability of these items is checked monthly and annually and they have limited battery shelf life, between two and five years using mostly lithium-type batteries. 406 MHz EPIRB's transmit a registration number which is linked to a database of information about the vessel.|$|R
5000|$|A Cospas-Sarsat [...] {{distress}} beacon is a [...] digital 406-MHz radio transmitter {{that can be}} activated in a life-threatening emergency to summon assistance from government authorities. Beacons are manufactured and sold by dozens of vendors. They are classified in three main types. A 406-MHz beacon designed for use in an aircraft is known as an emergency locator transmitter (ELT). One designed for use aboard a marine vessel is called an <b>emergency</b> <b>position-indicating</b> radio beacon (EPIRB). And one {{that is designed to}} be carried by an individual is known as a personal locator beacon (PLB). Sometimes PLBs are carried aboard aircraft or vessels, but whether this satisfies safety requirements depends on local regulations. [...] A Cospas-Sarsat 406-MHz beacon does not transmit until it is activated in an emergency (or when certain testing features are activated by the user). Some beacons are designed to be manually activated by a person pressing a button, and some others are designed for automatic activation in certain circumstances (e.g., ELTs may be automatically activated by a physical shock, such as in a crash, and EPIRBs may be automatically activated by contact with water). There are no subscription or other costs imposed by Cospas-Sarsat for beacon ownership or use. (Some countries may impose licensing and/or registration charges for beacon ownership, and some jurisdictions may assess costs for rescue operations.) ...|$|R
40|$|Low Earth Orbit (LEO) {{satellites}} have {{a limited}} direct contact time with the stations of their ground segment. This fundamentally constraints a timeliness reaction of the mission control center in case of emergency situations onboard the LEO spacecraft. To enable such a rapid reaction to emergency situations onboard LEO satellites, it is proposed to use a Search and Rescue (SAR) beacon onboard that spacecraft to transmit an alert message via Galileo satellites which support SAR through the Cospas-Sarsat (C/S) system to the satellite mission control center. While SAR up to now is limited to terrestrial, maritime, and aviation user scenarios, this space user concept presents a novel emergency system which helps facilitating the valuable space assets which LEO satellites in many cases represent. However, such a space user system faces various technical, system, and business challenges as well as legal and regulatory issues. The frequency band assigned for the SAR system is limited to low power satellite <b>emergency</b> <b>position-indicating</b> radio beacons and is foreseen for earth-space transmissions only. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) should agree on opening this band for space-space communication for space user distress beacons. The Distress Alerting Satellite System (DASS) and the SAR/Glonass system will also operate in this band and an agreement will be required for these as well. A visibility analysis is presented for LEO to Galileo satellites. Depending on {{the placement of the}} antenna of the distress beacon on the LEO spacecraft, between 6 and 21 Galileo satellites are visible. The space user beacon may cause interference to the current SAR system when it’...|$|R
