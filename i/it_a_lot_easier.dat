According to co-writer Jim Vallance modern technology and equipment made <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>easier</b> to record the album. Adams recorded the album while on tour, making use of the time between playing on stage and readying himself for the next gig. Vallance and Adams recorded the album normally while sitting backstage or in an hotel room with small devices which they usually carried along on tours, but especially during their off days. Adams, in an interview, mentioned that when recording a song, they needed to set up mattresses against the windows, and having microphones run through the toilet.|$|E

Having a parent as a donor also has made <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>easier</b> for children - because both patients are in the same hospital and can help boost each other's morale.|$|E

500|$|TV Guide listed [...] "Kir'Shara" [...] on its Hot List for the day, {{while the}} preview by IGN {{said that the}} show [...] "finally grows up and becomes a Star Trek series this week". It {{described}} [...] "Kir'Shara" [...] as [...] "far from a perfectly executed Trek story but they get enough right to make <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>easier</b> to overlook the few things they miss." [...] It said {{that there had been}} an overall improvement in the fourth season, and that [...] "this could become some of the best Star Trek ever made". It gave [...] "Kir'Shara" [...] a rating of four and a half out of five. In Matthew Kappell's book Star Trek As Myth, he said that he felt that the revelation that the previous Vulcan administration was working with the Romulans all along [...] "suddenly makes sense of years of previously incomprehensible Vulcan policy" [...] and linked to The Next Generation episode [...] "".|$|E
500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the season, Fazekas recalled the potential story revolving around Carter having a girls night out, saying that they realized that [...] "once Peggy is on the mission, it starts to become difficult for her to have a social life...we kept sort of punting that scene because every time we tried to do it, it was like, 'She's not going to stop to go out to dinner. She has the world to save.'" [...] Also, they felt they were not properly servicing Angie's character, instead [...] "just sticking her in scenes just to be there," [...] resulting in the decision to ultimately not bring Angie back for the season as planned. In her place, the characters of Ana Jarvis and Rose Roberts are featured as confidante's for Carter, [...] "both people who are 100% in on Peggy's secret.

500|$|A strong {{start to}} the 2006–07 Australian {{domestic}} season, exemplified by 150* against Tasmania in the Pura Cup and 126* against New South Wales in the Ford Ranger Cup (previously ING Cup) saw White recalled to the Australia one-day squad. [...] Chief of selectors, Andrew Hilditch described his inclusion in the squad, praising his [...] "great form with the bat and [...] has had some terrific performances with the ball". In an interview with Australian newspaper The Age, White professed his relief at returning to the international scene, stating that [...] "I don't really care if I get picked as a batting allrounder or a bowling allrounder, or just as a bat or bowler, as long as I get picked." [...] An international Twenty20 against England saw White rewarded with {{a man of the}} match award for his 40* off 20 balls, and 1/11 with the ball in hand. In his next batting innings, White scored 45runs including 3sixes against New Zealand, leading teammate Andrew Symonds to praise his ability to strike the cricket ball, saying that [...] "when you've got that going on at the other end, it makes <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>easier</b> for me". Despite his excellent form with the bat, White's bowling was proving to be mostly ineffective. For this reason, as well as the improved form of Brad Hodge and the selection of Brad Hogg and Shane Watson for their ability with the ball, he was dropped for the finals of the Commonwealth Bank Series and left out of the World Cup squad.|$|E

Watson told Katrina Fox [...] "I've never {{made a point of}} letting people know about my sexuality because I've never thought it was relevant, but it's who I am and I'm not ashamed of it. However in saying that, I think in this particular day <b>it's</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>easier</b> to be identified as a not-so-straight woman particularly with the The L Word series out where it's glamorised if you like; <b>it's</b> almost <b>a</b> bit of a fad like we're in fashion." ...|$|R

2500|$|For {{writing and}} {{production}} of A Girl like Me Rihanna teamed up once again with record producers Carl Sturken and Evan Rogers, who produced most of the tracks on her previous album, J.

While recording the track [...] "If It's Lovin' That You Want" [...] for her debut album, Rihanna received a visit from American singer Ne-Yo, in which they {{met for the first}} time, although they never got the chance to collaborate on Music of the Sun. When production started, she {{came up with the idea}} of working with Ne-Yo. When asked about collaborating with Ne-Yo, Rihanna stated: [...] "We never got around to it on the first album. So for the second album, I was like, 'You know what? I have to work with that guy Ne-Yo.' And it made <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>easier</b> because he's on the same label I am."

I wanted to make a record that was both small and huge, and sometimes both of those things at the same time. Some people get over things by talking about them to anyone who’ll listen, but for me, <b>it’s</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>easier</b> to just sing my heart out and hope whoever’s listening gets a little something out of it too.|$|R
5000|$|At a Michigan primary {{campaign}} appearance on January 14, 2008, Huckabee said [...] "I have opponents {{in this race}} {{who do not want}} to change the Constitution.

And that's what we need to doto amend the Constitution so it's in God's standards rather than try to change God's standards so it lines up with some contemporary view." [...] Huckabee's comment was generally poorly received; television pundit Joe Scarborough commented that while he believes [...] "evangelicals should be able to talk politics ... some might find that statement very troubling, that we're going to change the Constitution to be in line with the Bible.

500|$|Diary of a Camper and {{the films}} that it {{inspired}} were initially called [...] "Quake movies"; the term machinima was later coined in 1998, {{in response to}} the increasing use of other game engines. There was initial hesitance to retroactively label Diary of a Camper the first machinima piece; a Machinima.com article from February 2000 opened, [...] "It's kinda hard to pin down the first Machinima: things like the Doom speedruns, the Stunt Island stuff and the Demo Scene all compete for the title. However, <b>it's</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>easier</b> to pin down the first piece of film made in a 3D game engine: Diary Of A Camper". Marino states that the AMAS carefully defined machinima in 2002 as [...] "animated filmmaking within a real-time virtual 3-D environment" [...] to separate machinima from its creative lineage. Separating machinima from the demoscene and earlier demo recordings, he defines Diary of a Camper as the first machinima work. Lowood also contrasts the film with earlier recordings of [...] "documented gameplay".|$|R
5000|$|Hammel {{described}} her own recent research {{by saying that}} [...] "one thing that we all care about is the weather, and we care about the weather on the Earth the most. But what makes weather is gases and clouds, and the reason the weather on the Earth is hard to predict is because we have oceans and continents that interact with our atmosphere. That makes {{it very hard to}} predict the weather, as we all know. But if you take a planet like Jupiter or Neptune you don't have continents and you don't have oceans. All you have is gas, all you have is atmosphere, and therefore <b>it's</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>easier</b> to model the weather on those planets. But it's the same physical process, it's {{the same kind of thing}} happening, whether it happens on the Earth or whether it happens on Neptune. Therefore by studying weather on Neptune we learn about weather in general, and that helps us understand the weather on Earth better".|$|R
