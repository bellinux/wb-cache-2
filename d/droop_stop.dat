40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} recent developments {{in an effort to}} predict transient aeroelastic rotor response during shipboard engage and disengage sequences. The blade is modeled as an elastic beam undergoing in flap, lag, extension and torsion. The blade equations of motion are formulated using Hamilton's principle and they are spatially discretized using the finite element method. The discretized blade equations of motion are integrated for a specified rotor speed run-up or run-down profile. Blade element theory is used to calculate quasi-steady or unsteady aerodynamic loads in linear and nonlinear regimes. The analysis is capable of simulating both articulated, hingeless, and gimballed rotor systems. Validation of the rotor code is discussed, including correlation with <b>droop</b> <b>stop</b> impact tests and wind tunnel experiments. Predictions of safe engagement and disengagement envelopes, limited by excessive blade tip deflections or hub moments, are presented. Future directions of study are also discussed...|$|E
50|$|The bladess of the three-bladed {{main rotor}} are {{attached}} to the rotor head via a lightweight and strong interleaving steel plates while tie-rods absorb direct centrifugal force under tension. The blade levers are connected via ball joints to the arms of a control spider, the cone of which being actuated up and down by the collective pitch lever in order to change to pitch of all of the blades; an irreversible mechanism is present to prevent blade loads being transferred back to the control stick. The blades are supported when still or at slow rotational speeds by <b>droop</b> <b>stops,</b> which serve to keep a level of clearance between the blades and the fuselage even under high wind conditions; these stops are withdrawn above 100 RPM so that full freedom of movement for effective flight is possible.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a double sharpened CIC decimation filter, {{which consists of}} generalized comb filter as first stage, sharpened comb filter as second and third stage. The comb decimation filter at the first stage operates at the input sampling rate, sharpened second stage operates at lower sampling rate as compared to first stage and sharpened third stage operates at lower than {{the first and second}} stages. This reduces the sampling at every stage of the three stage CIC decimation filter. The sharpened second stage produces the narrow passband <b>droop</b> and better <b>stop</b> band alias rejection. This narrow passband droop will be compensated with the help of third stage which is sharpened section. This filter structure is designed in MATLAB Simulink environment and implemented with help of Virtex-V XC 5 VLX 110 T- 3 ff 1136. Device utilization and simulation results are tabulated...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{modeling}} of the engage and disengage operations of a helicopter rotor during which blades can come in intermittent contact with the <b>droop</b> or flap <b>stops.</b> The problem is formulated {{within the framework of}} finite element based flexible multibody dynamics that allows the analysis of rotorcraft systems of arbitrary topology with the potential of contact among various components of the system. Contact is assumed to be of finite duration, and the forces acting between the contacting stops are explicitly computed during the simulation. The modeling of contact consists of three parts: the evaluation of the relative distance between the stops, a unilateral contact condition which is transformed into a holonomic constraint by the addition of a slack variable, and a contact model which describes the relationship between the contact force and the local deformation of the contacting bodies. The proposed analysis procedure is validated by comparison with experimental data, and the aeroelastic analysis of shipboard engage and disengage operations of a H- 46 rotor is presented...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{proposes a}} Rotary-Wing Aeroservoelasticity {{approach}} to the modeling, analysis {{and control of the}} blade-sailing phenomenon in the helicopter-ship dynamic interface (DI), based on the identification, response evaluation and control of flow and ship motion induced loads, during the engagement/disengagement flight regimes, in order to establish some principles for the design and safe operation of shipboard rotorcraft systems. The nonlinear aeroelastic analysis revealed that the nonlinearity due to large flapping deflections and to the centrifugal forces is not relevant for normal operating conditions, whereas the nonlinear effects due to the flapping stops in articulated rotors influence significantly the blade-sailing vibrations. These nonlinear effects related to the stops can be tackled with approximate stiffness functions. The nonlinear analysis confirmed that hingeless rotor blade-sailing vibrations are lower than that of the articulated rotor, however, the differences are small for rotors with similar structural/geometric characteristics. The blade-sailing phenomenon in the DI and the flapping response during engagement/disengagement shipboard operations can be analyzed trough an oscillator system with nonlinear stiffness related to the <b>droop</b> and flap <b>stops</b> and time-varying coefficients related to the undisturbed flow velocity and to the parameters of the proposed active proportional-derivative individual blade control (PD-IBC). The aeroelastic analysis also showed that blade sailing is a cooperative phenomenon. Though the mean flow vertical velocity gradient across the rotor be the single most important factor, the combination of horizontal wind velocities, fluctuating flow vertical velocities, gravity and ship motion effects may give rise to excessive flapping vibrations. The proposed active proportional-derivative state feedback individual blade control (PD-IBC) can obtain blade-sailing flapping vibration reduction of 30 % for shipboard articulated rotors at moderate wind-over-deck (WOD) conditions/advance ratios, without monitoring the DI environment, and a reduction greater than 40 % if combined with shipboard rotor plant modifications, involving an increase of the blade flapwise stiffness and an aerodynamic design of the ship flight deck, considering the current blade pitch input limits of the actuators. Therefore, the implementation of active feedback aeroelastic control methods {{may be one of the}} most important measures for blade-sailing mitigation in the DI...|$|R
