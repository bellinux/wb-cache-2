Most two-die set includes a bullet seating die and either a full length resizing die or a neck sizing die. A full length sizing die reforms the complete body of the case to specification. The neck sizing die reforms only the neck {{so that it can}} hold the bullet in place. Neck-sizing cases rather than full length sizing cases can extend the case life of cartridges. On the <b>downside,</b> <b>cases</b> that are only neck sized may not feed through some actions reliably especially when used in semi-automatic rifles. Cartridges which are intended for semi-automatics should be full length resized. Most Weatherby manufactured rifle chambers are machined to very tight tolerances making [...] full length resizing has little effect on extending the case life as the cartridge brass {{does not have to be}} worked as much to reform it. If once fired cases are to be used in a rifle in other than one it which it had been previously fired full length resizing the cases is the norm.|$|R

In {{this article we}} compare the benefits of portfolio diversification for <b>downside</b> risk in <b>case</b> returns are normally distributed with the case of fat-tailed distributed returns. The downside risk of a security is decomposed into a part which is attributable to the market risk, an idiosyncratic part, and a second independent factor. We show that the fat-tailed-based downside risk, measured as value-at-risk (VaR), should decline more rapidly than the normal-based VaR. This result is confirmed empirically.

40|$|Should {{you buy a}} {{stock or}} a {{corporate}} bond? A common belief is that the Pratt-Arrow risk aversion measure gives the answer: a more risk averse investor will prefer more a corporate bond to a stock. However, {{this is not always}} true. In a simple portfolio problem with a riskless bond, a stock and a corporate bond from a firm, we show that, it is not the risk aversion measure but a downside risk aversion measure called cautiousness which gives the answer to the question: a more cautious investor will prefer more a stock to a corporate bond. While in some <b>cases</b> <b>downside</b> risk aversion agrees with risk aversion, in some other cases it does not...|$|R
40|$|Multilayered graphitic {{materials}} are not suitable as load-bearers {{due to their}} inherent weak interlayer bonding (for example, graphite is a solid lubricant in certain applications). This situation is largely improved when two-dimensional (2 -D) materials such as a monolayer (SLG) graphene are employed. The <b>downside</b> in these <b>cases</b> {{is the presence of}} thermally or mechanically induced wrinkles which are ubiquitous in 2 -D materials. Here we set out to examine the effect of extensive large wavelength/ amplitude wrinkling on the stress transfer capabilities of exfoliated simply-supported graphene flakes. Contrary to common belief we present clear evidence that this type of "corrugation" enhances the load bearing capacity of few-layer graphene as compared to 'flat' specimens. This effect {{is the result of the}} significant increase of the graphene/polymer interfacial shear stress per increment of applied strain due to wrinkling and paves the way for designing affordable graphene composites with highly improved stress-transfer efficiency.

30|$|Mangroves {{belonging}} to 14 species, 9 genera and 5 families were collected. We acquired high quality DNA barcodes for 45 specimens {{belonging to}} 14 species, which were sequenced for rbcL and matK. The sequencing result of rbcL produced {{an average of}} 510  bp without any insertion, deletion and stop codon, whereas matK sequencing produced 712  bp with few insertion and deletions {{in the form of}} gaps without stop codon. Overall GC content observed in rbcL was 43.29  % (SE = 0.09), while in matK it was 33.18  % (SE =  0.18). The mean GC content of codon at positions 1 - 3 in rbcL was 54.66  % (SE =  0.1), 45.77  % (SE =  0.09) and 29.44  % (SE =  0.21), and in matK, it was 33.15  % (SE =  0.18), 30.92  % (SE =  0.36), 29.91  % (SE =  0.25) respectively. The specimen data, collection site details and sequences were submitted to BOLD database in form of project IMDB (doi: 10.5883 /DS-IMDBNG) (For details, Table  1). The specimens were verified from sequenced data by performing NCBI BLAST. This is performed for preliminary verification for all mangroves at species level but <b>downside</b> in our <b>case</b> study is limited reference data for comparison. The rbcL and matK correctly identified genera up to 100  %, while species identification with rbcL and matK leads to 64 and 85  % identification respectively.|$|R
40|$|Copulae provide {{investors with}} tools {{to model the}} {{dependency}} structure among financial products. The choice of copulae {{plays an important role}} in successful copula applications. However, selecting copulae usually relies on general goodness-of-fit (GoF) tests which are independent of the particular financial problem. This paper ¯rst proposes a pair-copula-GARCH model to construct the dependency structure and simulate the joint returns of five U. S. equites. It then discusses copula selection problem from the perspective of downside risk management with the so-called D-vine structure, which considers the Joe-Clayton copula and the Student t copula as building blocks for the vine pair-copula decomposition. Value at risk, expected shortfall, and Omega function are considered as downside risk measures in this study. As an alternative to the traditional bootstrap approaches, the proposed pair-copula-GARCH model provides simulated asset returns for generating future scenarios of portfolio value. It is found that, although the Student t pair-copula system performs better than the Joe-Clayton system in a GoF test, the latter is able to provide the loss distributions which are more consistent with the empirically examined loss distributions while optimizing the Omega ratio. Furthermore, the economic benefit of using the pair-copula-GARCH model is revealed by comparing the loss distributions from the proposed model and the conventional exponentially weighted moving average model of RiskMetrics in this <b>case.</b> <b>Downside</b> Risk, AR-TGARCH, Pair-Copula, Vine Structure, Differential Evolution...|$|R
5000|$|Halberstam {{begins to}} define stupidity on page 54 where she says [...] "Stupidity {{conventionally}} means different things {{in relation to}} different subject positions; for example, stupidity in white men can signify new modes of domination, but stupidity in women of all ethnicities inevitably symbolizes their status as, in psychoanalytic terms, [...] "castrated" [...] or impaired." [...] Stupidity can mean {{a variety of things}} depending on the scenario. Right off the bat he gives an example of how stupidity in men is generalized compared to that of women. Stupidity in women seems to be strictly looked down upon, while stupidity in men can be seen as charming. Women have always been oppressed by the idea, which was created by past hierarchy systems, that women are just not as intelligent as men.. [...] "Stupidity is as profoundly gendered as knowledge formations in general; thus while unknowing in a man is sometimes rendered as part of masculine charm, unknowing in a woman indicates a lack and a justification of a social order that anyway privileges men. Though we both punish and naturalize female stupidity, we not only forgive stupidity in white men, but we often cannot recognize it as such since white maleness is the identity construct most often associated with mastery, wisdom, and grand narratives." [...] White males were the symbolization of knowledge and power, not stupidity. The election of 2004, between George W. Bush and John Kerry, was used {{as an example of how}} stupidity is beneficial in certain scenarios for men. John Kerry was the well-educated, hard-working, and well-spoken candidate who gets edged out by George W. Bush, a man who sold himself on being a fun-loving, fun to be around type of guy. Bush sold himself to the public in a way to show that he was just an average person like [...] "everyone else". Society loved that he was a Yale student but not a 4.0 kind of student. Stupidity in men does not hurt their chances in society, unlike that of women. In a male-dominated culture, stupidity in men does not have a negative <b>downside.</b> In this <b>case,</b> it actually helped the person. Stupidity can also help shed light on queer culture also.|$|R
40|$|This Article identifies, justifies, and {{explains}} {{the parameters of}} a largely ignored but important category of cases—what is here called 2 ̆ 2 preventive adjudication. 2 ̆ 2 In this category of cases, courts offer opinions without any 2 ̆ 2 command 2 ̆ 2 to the parties, and these opinions are meant to avoid future harm, not remedy past harm. Despite receiving little attention in the legal literature, preventive adjudication is pervasive throughout the law. It happens in declaratory judgment actions about wills, patents, and unconstitutionally vague statutes; in paternity and maternity petitions; in petitions to have missing persons declared dead; in boundary disputes; in actions to quiet title. This Article explains what preventive adjudication is and how it should {{and should not be}} used. Preventive adjudication is intuitively appealing, because it helps people avoid harm and clarifies the law. But there are <b>downsides</b> to deciding <b>cases</b> in advance instead of waiting for remedial adjudication. The argument for preventive adjudication is therefore a qualified one. This Article identifies not only the merits of preventive adjudication but also the crucial limiting principles. One limiting principle is administrative and error costs; another is the adequacy of discounting (that is, taking into account the uncertainty of future events). People discount for many kinds of uncertainty, and discounting is usually adequate for uncertainty caused by law. But discounting is inadequate when the law causes uncertainty about inescapable threshold questions for human behavior, such as legal parenthood, citizenship, marital status, or death. Discounting is also inadequate for uncertainty about property rights because of how uncertainty undermines the rationales for having property rules in the first place (such as encouraging efficient investment and information gathering by property owners). In short, where discounting is inadequate, preventive adjudication is especially valuable. This Article also shows how this normative understanding of preventive adjudication can be translated into the actual practice of courts in the United States. Legal systems in the United States have two ways of determining which cases should be decided by preventive adjudication: sometimes they rely on judicial discretion to decide if preventive adjudication is appropriate in each case (2 ̆ 2 retail sorting 2 ̆ 2); and sometimes they specify categories of cases in which preventive adjudication is available(2 ̆ 2 wholesale sorting 2 ̆ 2). An analysis of both approaches shows that wholesale sorting—which is common in state courts but not in federal courts—better aligns the actual practice of preventive adjudication with the cases in which it is justifiable...|$|R
40|$|Unemployment {{has ceased}} {{to have an impact}} on the {{electorate}} or politicians, says John Quiggin Sometimes the real news is that nothing has changed, nor is likely to. Australia’s unemployment rate has been stuck between 6 and 8 per cent for the best part of a decade, with almost no net movement over the past two years. The figures are not bad enough to provoke any sense of crisis, and people have gradually got used to them. On the other hand, no economy with such a poor performance on this crucial measure can be described as booming or even performing adequately. And the prospects for the coming year do not look good. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry has already predicted a decline in new hiring. Australia’s macroeconomic performance has been good by world standards. We have managed a decade without a recession, or even a serious slowdown. Of course, the combination of good macroeconomic performance with poor outcomes on unemployment implies there must be even more serious failures somewhere else in the system. The first problem is the restructuring of the labour market, with the steady erosion of long-term full-time employment. Not only has the number of ‘full-time’ jobs declined, or at best stagnated, but job security has been eroded and the length and variability of the working week has risen. This restructuring has been the deliberate product of two decades of microeconomic reform. The entire program of microeconomic reform could be summed up simply by saying that the core objective is to ensure that no one should have a safe job, or, if you prefer, that everyone should be exposed to the full force of competition. In principle, this applies as much to bosses as to workers. In practice, however, those at the top have proved remarkably adept at protecting themselves from any <b>downside,</b> even in <b>cases</b> of gross incompetence or dishonesty. Continuous exposure to remorseless competition is, no doubt, good for productivity in the short run, but it has adverse long-term consequences. Many of those pushed out of the full-time workforce ‘to encourage the others’ never return. Moreover, many who remain are eager to retire as soon as it becomes financially possible. Not surprisingly, male participation in the full-time labour force (those who have a full-time job or want one) is at a record low. Even for women, the long-term historical trend towards full-time participation has halted and started to decline somewhat. By its very nature, a casualised labour market based on short-term contracts or employment at will is bound to be associated with more frequent spells of unemployment. And every episode of unemployment carries with it the risk of permanent withdrawal from the labour force and, sooner or later, reliance on the social security system. Labour market programs directed at the unemployed are supposed to help in resolving these problems. Under the present government, however, the two primary policy goals in this area have been saving money and scoring political points. The replacement of the Commonwealth Employment Service by the Job Network was supposed to introduce a brave new world of individually tailored services for the unemployed, leading to greatly improved outcomes. Even the governmentÃ…fs own reports, such as that issued by the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations in September, now admit that the Job Network has been almost totally ineffective in assisting the long-term unemployed. The only defence offered is that, based on statistical measures, the previous governmentÃ…fs programs were equally ineffective and cost more to run. The problem, which is finally receiving partial acknowledgement, is that an incentive-based system like the Job Network is perfectly designed to produce statistical outcomes at minimum cost. Service providers have strong incentives to focus resources on the easy cases in any given category and to adopt strategies that produce the measured outcomes required by government rather than those that meet the needs of their clients. More important than any of these specific failures is simple lack of interest. At no time since the election of the current government has unemployment been an issue of real concern. Second-order trivia like the GST and waterfront reform have had far more attention. And, sadly, the Australian public has become inured to chronic mass unemployment. In the absence of a severe economic downturn, the government will pay no real political price for its worst policy failure.
