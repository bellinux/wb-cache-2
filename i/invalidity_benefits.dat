At the same time I would like to describe in detail and evaluate above named national legislations in the same structure, if possible. The first chapter deals with historical aspects. After the origins of social security are mentioned, I already focus on the historical development of invalidity benefits' legislation in european and czech context. The next chapter is an analysis of <b>invalidity</b> <b>benefits</b> at the international level. Especially the achievements of the International Labour Organization, the Council of Europe and the European Union in the field of disablement pensions are highlighted. It is completed by a brief description of bilateral agreements on social security.

40|$|International audienceThe French {{pattern of}} early {{transitions}} out of employment is basically {{explained by the}} low age at "normal" retirement and by the importance of transitions through unemployment insurance and early-retirement schemes before access to normal retirement. These routes have exempted French workers from massively relying on disability motives for early exits, contrarily to the situation that prevails in some other countries where normal ages are high, unemployment benefits low and early-retirement schemes almost non-existent. Yet the role of disability remains interesting to examine in the French case, at least for prospective reasons {{in a context of}} decreasing generosity of other programs. The study of the past reforms of the pension system underlines that disability routes have often acted as a substitute to other retirement routes. Changes in the claiming of <b>invalidity</b> <b>benefits</b> seem to match changes in pension schemes or controls more than changes in such health indicators as the mortality rates. However, our results suggest that increases in average health levels {{over the past two decades}} have come along with increased disparities. In that context, less generous pensions may induce an increase in the claiming of <b>invalidity</b> <b>benefits</b> partly because of substitution effects, but also because the share of people with poor health increases...|$|E

40|$|Social {{security}} expenditure totalled ATS 745 {{billion in}} 1998, the 2. 8 percent growth of nominal expenditure being 0. 7 percent below nominal GDP growth. The social expenditure ratio, i. e., {{the share of}} social expenditure in GDP, stood at 28. 5 percent in 1998, thus continuing its downward trend for the fourth consecutive year. The trend is expected to remain unchanged in 1999, as the cyclical upswing results in employment growth and a reduction of unemployment. At the same time, the budget consolidation measures (austerity budgets) are reinforcing this development. Measured by its social expenditure ratio, Austria ranks seventh in Europe. The ratios are higher in the Nordic countries as well as France and Germany. With a social expenditure ratio of 28. 7 percent, Austria was 0. 5 percentage point below the EU average in 1997. However, the structure of social security spending in Austria differs greatly from the European average. Expenditure for old-age pensions and survivor benefits is 3. 3 percentage points above the EU average and family benefits exceed {{the average of the}} fifteen member states by 1. 9 percentage points. The way Austrian social security is financed also differs from the EU average: contributions by public and private employers are 1 percentage point below the average, while employee contributions to social security are 3. 6 percentage points above the EU average; the share of tax money flowing into social security exceeds the average by 1. 6 percentage points. Old-age benefits (38. 2 percent for old-age pensions and 10. 3 percent for survivor benefits) account for the largest share of social benefits, followed by health care expenditure (25. 8 percent) and family benefits (10. 2 percent). <b>Invalidity</b> <b>benefits</b> are the fourth largest expenditure item (8. 6 percent), while unemployment benefits account for no more than 5. 6 percent of all social benefit payments. The shares of old-age pensions and <b>invalidity</b> <b>benefits</b> increased between 1997 and 1998. Spending rose most strongly (+ 10. 8 percent) in the field of <b>invalidity</b> <b>benefits</b> (including early retirement for reasons of partial invalidity) as well as early retirement after long-term insurance coverage (+ 4. 9 percent) and unemployment benefits (+ 4. 1 percent). Changes in legislation resulted in a steep decline of spending for parental leave (– 21. 5 percent) and child-birth benefits (– 75. 4 percent), although family benefit expenditure as a whole increased by 1. 6 percent.

40|$|Calculated on {{the basis}} of the European System of Integrated Social Protection Statistics (ESSPROS), social {{expenditures}} (including social security, health and old-age pensions) in Austria rose by 0. 2 percent in 1997. The ratio of social expenditures to GDP, on the other hand, fell from 29. 6 percent in 1996 to 28. 8 percent in 1997. After levelling off in 1995, the ratio actually declined in the wake of the first and second austerity packages. In 1997, it was lower for the second consecutive year, and the trend appears to have continued in 1998 as a consequence of the economic upswing, which was, however, accompanied by an ongoing rise in the unemployment rate. Ever since 1995, real social expenditures have been growing at a lesser rate than the GDP. Social expenditures in 1997 concentrated on four major items: retirement benefits (social security pensions including survivors' pensions, 48. 4 percent), health care (25. 8 percent), family- or child-related benefits (10. 5 percent) and <b>invalidity</b> <b>benefits</b> (8. 3 percent). Above-average growth rates were registered for <b>invalidity</b> <b>benefits</b> granted to persons of working age and unemployment benefits, although the latter were declining from 1996 to 1997. Child-related expenditures showed substantial fluctuations (growth until 1995, cuts afterwards). As a proportion of GDP, social expenditures in Austria is slightly above the EU- 15 average. But the structural composition of social outlays differs markedly from the EU average: in Austria retirement benefits (including survivors' pensions) are higher by 3. 8 percentage points, and child-related benefits by 2. 5 percentage points, than the EU average, whereas expenditures on unemployment benefits is 2. 8 percentage points below the European average.

Therefore a cross national study of sickness absence in Belgium, West Germany, and the Netherlands focused firstly on "contextual" aspects of sickness absence such as work incapacity benefit schemes, job security regulations, {{and the role of}} occupational physicians. Substantial differences were observed in regulations, local definitions, and available data. Those differences provide hypotheses for possibly divergent absence levels as well. For instance, Belgium shows the most diversified control procedures, the lowest level of sickness benefits, and the most rigid qualifying criteria for <b>invalidity</b> <b>benefits.</b> Sickness absence data were obtained from companies of four different clusters, each consisting of a comparable Belgian, German, and Dutch organisation. Conceptual, administrative, and statistical sources of bias were accounted for by selecting companies which resemble each other as to their product, production process, size, and geographical location: by using standardised definitions, absence data, and indices (observation period 1 January 1980 to 1 January 1982); and by measuring population variables to eliminate obvious explanations in terms of workforce composition. Controlled comparisons in these multiple clusters showed considerable and consistent differences in sickness absence rates. Whereas Belgian employees had 20. 3 days of sickness absence (standardised for sex, age, and occupation) a year, German and Dutch employees had 28. 5 and 39. 1 days off a year respectively.

40|$|From data {{provided}} by a national census of treatment for alcohol problems in 1996, this paper reports findings on differences between three countries of the UK (England, Northern Ireland and Scotland). Wales and the Channel Islands {{were not included in}} this analysis because of especially low response rates. Countries did not differ in the numbers of clients seen per day or the gender balance of clients. Mean age of clients was highest in Scotland (44 years) and lowest in Northern Ireland (39 years). A higher proportion of clients seen in Northern Ireland were friends or relatives of problem drinkers seeking help than in the other countries. English agencies reported much larger proportions of 'Irish' clients than those in Scotland. Northern Irish agencies showed the highest proportion of married clients and also the lowest proportion of those divorced, separated or widowed, the highest proportion of whom was found in Scotland. The country recording the highest proportion of clients in insecure accommodation was England. Northern Irish agencies had the highest proportion of clients in employment and the lowest proportion on sickness or <b>invalidity</b> <b>benefits.</b> The highest proportion of professional staff delivering treatment on census day was recorded in Northern Ireland. Clients in Northern Ireland were less likely to complain about physical health consequences of drinking and more likely to complain about psychological consequences. The highest proportion of clients simultaneously attending Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings was found in Northern Ireland. Known drug use was higher in agencies in Northern Ireland than in England and Scotland. Clients seen by agencies in Northern Ireland appear to form a distinct group from those seen in Scotland and England.

40|$|The {{prevention}} of age discrimination in Sweden {{did not have}} any solvent grounds until directive 2000 / 78 /EG was implemented into Swedish law. Today age discrimination has been banned for just over two years. This ground of discrimination has, compared to other existing grounds of discrimination in Swedish law, a lot more opportunities to make exceptions from. Given the fact that the exemption rules are vague, it is difficult to determine whether the protection against age discrimination is in fact a protection at all. The purpose of this essay is to describe what the law regarding age discrimination means. Is the protection against age discrimination appropriate or are the prohibitions against age discrimination deficient? Both Swedish and EU-law applies in this essay, since the Swedish Discrimination Act has been influenced by EU-law. From the prohibition of age discrimination there are a few exemptions which are permissible under Swedish and EU-law. There are three possibilities to make exemptions to the age discrimination ban in Swedish law, one of which can be made in individual contracts and collective agreements as regards the right to pension- survivor - or <b>invalidity</b> <b>benefits.</b> The other two exemptions are more general and vague and therefore do not provide much guidance. Consequently, the main {{question is whether or not}} the Swedish Discrimination Act provides a protection with no actual effect, since the preparatory works mention situations where exceptions to the prohibition of age discrimination are considered to be permitted. In 2001 a mandatory rule came into force in the Employment Protection Act (LAS) which gave employees the right, to remain in their post until the month in which he or she reaches the age of 67. The issue however occurs after the employer has reached this age and whether or not this rule constitutes a direct discrimination by law...|$|E

40|$|From data {{provided}} by a national census of treatment for alcohol problems in 1996, this paper reports findings on differences between types of treatment agencies in England and Wales. The overall response rate was 44 % but {{no significant differences were}} found between responding and non-responding agencies in size and composition of staff. The highest mean number of clients per day was seen in NHS trust services and charitable organizations. Private (for profit) agencies showed both the highest mean age of clients and the highest proportion of men among agency types, while NHS trusts saw the highest proportion of women. Charities and voluntary organizations reported higher than average proportions of clients living in insecure accommodation. Private (for profit) agencies showed both the lowest proportion of unemployed clients and the highest proportion of those on sickness or <b>invalidity</b> <b>benefits.</b> Seventy-three per cent of clients attending NHS trust services were seen by nurses, medical or non-medical professionals; only 8 % of clients attending private (for profit) agencies were seen by these professional groups. Worries about physical health were far more common among clients attending private (for profit) agencies and legal/financial problems occurred much more often among those attending voluntary/statutory partnerships. The highest proportion of clients in residential treatment was shown in private (for profit) agencies and the lowest in voluntary/statutory partnerships and NHS trusts. Nearly all (90 %) treatment carried out by voluntary/statutory partnerships was in the form of 'counselling', while approximately half the clients seen by charities and independent (non-profit) organizations were in day or residential treatment. While in the overall sample, the mean percentage of clients also attending Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) was 9 %, this rose to 23 % of clients attending independent (non-profit) agencies. The highest proportions of clients with reported illicit drug use was in voluntary/statutory partnerships and the lowest in independent (non-profit) agencies.

40|$|After {{shooting}} {{up in the}} early 1990 s, due to additional benefits such as {{the second year of}} parental leave, tax credits for children and the long-term care benefit, and leveling off at 29. 7 percent in 1994 and 1995, the social expenditure/GDP ratio began to shrink at last, to 29. 5 percent, in 1996, thanks to the effect of the first austerity package and {{in the face of a}} weakening economy and growing unemployment. As defined by the European System of Integrated Social Protection Statistics (ESSPROS), social outlays in Austria totaled ATS 714 billion in 1996, equivalent to 29. 5 percent of its gross domestic product, and down from 29. 7 percent in 1994 and 1995 in spite of the slump and high unemployment rates. During the 1980 s, changes in the social expenditure/GDP ratio reflected mainly cyclical variations: it rose throughout the period of sluggish growth until 1987, but fell back below the 1980 level when the economy recovered. Structural grounds, i. e., the introduction and improvement of benefit levels, such as the second year of parental leave, improved eligibility criteria for women's pensions, tax credits for children and the long-term care benefit, caused the social expenditure/GDP ratio to shoot up again in 1991 to 1994. In spite of the subsequent cyclical downswing, the ratio leveled off in 1995 and actually declined in 1996 as a consequence of the first austerity package. In view of the economic upswing and ongoing efforts at further consolidation, the trend is likely to continue in 1997 and 1998. In 1991 to 1996, social spending grew by altogether 36. 5 percent. Above-average growth rates were registered for unemployment benefits (+ 61. 5 percent), <b>invalidity</b> <b>benefits</b> (+ 55. 5 percent) and family benefits (+ 43. 4 percent). The scope of social expenditures in Austria is similar to that of other European countries of comparable economic and social structures. As a proportion of GDP, Austria's 1995 ratio was slightly above the EU average of 28. 4 percent which was depressed by the meager level of social spending in the southern European countries. The structural composition of social outlays in Austria differs markedly from the EU average insofar as old age pensions claim a much larger share (Austria 48 percent, EU 44 percent) whereas the share of spending on unemployment (6 percent and 8 percent, respectively) and on health care and invalidity (33 percent versus 36 percent) are distinctly lower in Austria.

40|$|The {{fiscal and}} {{distributive}} impact of three reforms {{to the social}} security pension system in the UK are evaluated. All three reforms are designed to increase the retirement age by changing the incentive structure underlying the pension system. The first increases the pension age by three years, the second introduces an actuarial adjustment to retirement before 65 and after sixty five allowing deferral to age 70. The final reform adapts the second reform to include a cap and a floor so as to mirror more closely the existing state pension scheme in the UK. Using a transition model of retirement, the simulations show that increasing the state pension age leads to {{a lower level of}} expenditure on the state pension. The increase in retirement ages would also lead to an increase in government revenues arising from increased income tax and national insurance contributions.

The level of inactivity among prime-age men is particularly concentrated among those who are both low skilled and suffering from a chronic health problem or disability.

30|$|It {{should be}} added, however, that {{the drop in}} UK {{unemployment}} from the mid- 1980 s {{until the end of}} the 1990 s was matched by a rise in the numbers of working-age persons on <b>Invalidity</b> <b>Benefit</b> (IB). OECD (2014 a) points out that the success of the activation strategy for UI benefit recipients was one of the factors driving the rise in the IB caseload in that period. This led to a shift in focus for activation measures to be extended to recipients of other inactive benefits, namely IB and sole-parent benefits. As noted above, the Pathways to Work programme was introduced in 2003 with the aim of helping IB claimants find work. However, participation in it was voluntary, at least until 2008. In 2008, IB was replaced by the Employment and Support allowance (ESA) for new claimants for disability benefits who were required to undergo both a Work Capability Assessment (WCA) and a work-focussed interview. It is noticeable that post- 2008, and continuing under the Coalition government, the tightening of conditionality requirements for working-age people in receipt of disability benefits led to declines in the inflows and stocks of people on such benefits. Participation on the New Deal for Lone Parents was also on a voluntary basis in the first instance.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The Opinions and Lifestyle Survey, formerly known as ONS Opinions Survey or Omnibus, is a regular, multi-purpose survey which {{was carried out in}} eight months of the year until April 2005. From this point it has run monthly. It started operating commercially in 1990 and was set up originally {{to meet the needs of}} government departments for a survey that used short and simple sets of questions, had greater statistical reliability than private sector omnibus surveys and a properly designed random sample. Now, however, an increasing number of academics are finding it a valuable research tool. The Opinions and Lifestyle Survey is used for a number of purposes, for example: to provide quick answers to questions of immediate interest to provide information on topics that do not require a full survey to develop and pilot questions for other surveys to sift for subgroups that can be followed up in another survey History From January 2008 the ONS Omnibus Survey changed its name to the ONS Opinions Survey (OPN) and became part of the Integrated Household Survey (IHS). As a result, certain classificatory variables were altered to harmonise with the rest of the surveys that form the IHS. For further information, see detailed breakdown of the changes contained within the documentation for 2008 studies onwards. Subsequently, in January 2010, the OPN component was dropped from the IHS due to only one individual per household being interviewed, while the IHS requires questions to be asked of all household members. This process significantly increased the length of the OPN interview and, therefore, OPN reverted back to interviewing one household member, but still contains questions harmonised to the IHS. From April 2012 the ONS Opinions Survey changed its name to the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey following the merger of the non-EU-SILC questions from the General Lifestyle Survey. Special Licence Access Opinions and Lifestyle Survey data With effect from 2008, the decision was made by ONS to make all new and existing Disability Monitoring data (Module 363) and Contraception data (Module 170) issuable only to Approved Researchers under Special Licence access conditions due to the disclosive nature of the modules. See the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey Special Licence Access datasets page. Main Topics : Each month's questionnaire consists of two elements: core questions, covering demographic information, are asked each month together with non-core questions that vary from month to month.

40|$|Objectives: The {{aim was to}} {{gain insight}} into work {{experiences}} and problems of subjects with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) to develop more effective guidelines for preventing work disability and work loss. Methods: A total of 617 patients aged 45 - 60, recruited from pulmonary outpatient clinics and general practices, completed a questionnaire on (respiratory) health and work history. Results: Of the patients 43 % were female, 52 % were employed and more than half were less educated. Comorbidity was present in 52 % of the study group. Of those who stopped working (N = 260), 36 % stopped before the onset of COPD, 39 % stopped because of COPD and 25 %, although having COPD, had other reasons to stop. Of the patients with a work history 39 % had an invalidity benefit: 21 % of the working and 60 % of the non-working patients. For one-third of these patients COPD was not the reason for having an <b>invalidity</b> <b>benefit.</b> For 56 % of those who had a benefit because of COPD, comorbidity contributed to work disability. No difference in current smoking habit was seen between working patients and non-working patients. Yet, non-working patients were more often smokers at the moment they stopped working. Furthermore, former smokers who still worked stopped smoking at a younger age than former smokers who stopped working. Compared with workers and independent of smoking habit, former workers were more exposed to dust/irritants, had their work(place) less frequently modified and had more unfavourable (social) work experiences. Conclusion: For employees with COPD, work loss is often multi-factorial. Comorbidity is often present and an important cause for work loss. Therefore occupational health guidance has to take other interfering (health) factors than COPD into consideration as well. In preventing work disability, work(place) adjustment merits more attention. © Springer-Verlag 2006...|$|R

40|$|UWV (Employee Insurance Agency) is an {{autonomous}} administrative authority (ZBO) and is {{commissioned by the}} Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment (SZW) to implement employee insurances and provide labour market and data services in the Netherlands. The Dutch employee insurances are provided for via laws such as the WW (Unemployment Insurance Act), the WIA (Work and Income according to Labour Capacity Act, which contains the IVA (Full <b>Invalidity</b> <b>Benefit</b> Regulations), WGA (Return to Work (Partially Disabled) Regulations), the Wajong (Disablement Assistance Act for Handicapped Young Persons), the WAO (Invalidity Insurance Act), the WAZ (Self-employed Persons Disablement Benefits Act), the Wazo (Work and Care Act) and the Sickness Benefits Act. The data in this collection pertains to customer contacts {{over a period of}} 8 months and UWV is looking for insights into their customers' journeys. Data has been collected from several different sources, namely: 1) Clickdata from the site www. werk. nl collected from visitors that were not logged in, 2) Clickdata from the customer specific part of the site www. werk. nl (a link is made with the customer that logged in), 3) Werkmap Message data, showing when customers contacted the UWV through a digital channel, 4) Call data from the callcenter, showing when customers contacted the call center by phone, and 5) Complaint data showing when customers complained. All data is accompanied by data fields with anonymized information about the customer as well as data about the site visited or the contents of the call and/or complaint. The texts in the dataset are provided in both Dutch and English where applicable. URL's are included based on the structure of the site during the period the data has been collected. UWV is interested in insights on how their channels are being used, when customers move from one contact channel to the next and why and if there are clear customer profiles to be identified in the behavioral data. Furthermore, recommendations are sought on how to serve customers without the need to change the contact channel...|$|R
40|$|In Gosta Esping-Andersen’s {{paradigmatic}} {{analysis of}} welfare capitalism (1990), the French welfare state is {{classified in the}} conservative corporatist regime. 1 France is generally recognized as belonging to the Bismarckian family of welfare states because of the centrality of social insurance. In fact, most of benefits are earnings related and entitlement is conditional upon a contribution record. Social security contributions are paid by both employers and employees. However, in France, {{there is also a}} non-contributory element, a Beveridgean component. It refers to the tax-financed system and includes social assistance programs, minimum incomes and programs aimed at vocational training, and at integrating the young or long-term unemployed. These programs benefit those who {{do not have access to}} the social insurance system, such as the long-term unemployed or the young unemployed who have not contributed enough or have only a very short contribution period. Since the late 1970 s, several kinds of minimum incomes or social minima have been set up to compensate for the failures of the Bismarckian sector (the social insurance system). There are at least eight different minimum incomes: minimum income for old people over sixty-five years, allowance for disabled adults, integration allowance, specific solidarity allowance, lone parent allowance, minimum income for disabled people (for those who have small <b>invalidity</b> insurance <b>benefits),</b> widowhood allowance, and mini...|$|R
