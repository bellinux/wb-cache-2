5|$|Woody {{returns to}} Sunnyside and learns from a Chatter Telephone toy {{that there is}} only one way out of the daycare: the trash. Woody and Andy's other toys execute their plan, but accidentally reset Buzz to Spanish mode instead of his old persona. Buzz {{promptly}} allies himself with Woody and falls in love with Jessie. The toys reach a dumpster, but are cornered by Lotso and his gang. As a <b>garbage</b> <b>truck</b> approaches, Woody reveals what he learned about Lotso and shows proof of Daisy's ownership tag, which Chuckles had kept, to Big Baby. Lotso destroys the tag and says that toys are meant to be discarded, but an enraged Big Baby throws Lotso into the dumpster. As the toys try to leave, Lotso pulls Woody into the dumpster just as the truck collects the trash. The rest of Andy's toys fall into the back of the truck while trying to rescue him, and a falling television lands on Buzz, restoring his memory and normal personality. The truck deposits the toys at a landfill, where they find themselves on a conveyor belt, leading to an incinerator. Woody and Buzz help Lotso reach an emergency stop button, only for Lotso to abandon them and escape. The toys resign themselves to their fate, but are soon rescued by the Aliens operating an industrial claw. Lotso is found by a <b>garbage</b> <b>truck</b> driver, who straps him to his truck's radiator grill, and drives away. Woody and the other toys board another <b>garbage</b> <b>truck</b> back to Andy's house.|$|E
5|$|Carol buys a car, and the McCoys {{drive to}} an {{electronics}} store. As Doc buys a portable radio, he switches {{off the television}} set near the proprietor's desk broadcasting {{the news of the}} earlier incidents they were involved in. Suddenly, all the television sets in the store show Doc's picture, prompting him to leave immediately. The proprietor gets a glimpse of the picture, and calls the police. Doc steals a shotgun, followed by several shoot-outs and police chases. The couple escape by hiding in a large trash bin, only to end up {{in the back of a}} <b>garbage</b> <b>truck</b> that dumps its load at the local landfill. Filthy and frustrated, they argue about whether to stay together or split up. They decide to see things through.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{his career}} von Stroheim used {{grotesque}} imagery and characters. This is most {{apparent in the}} wedding-banquet scene, which includes a midget, a hunchback, a woman with buck teeth and a boy on crutches. The wedding guests violently and crudely devour their meal like animals. This scene was unlike any other in films of that period, which treated meals with dignity {{and a sense of}} communion. Other instances of grotesque imagery include Trina's fingers becoming infected and amputated. Von Stroheim contrasted love scenes between McTeague and Trina with their ugly, lower-class environment, such as the sewer with the dead rat and a <b>garbage</b> <b>truck</b> driving by as they kiss.|$|E

5|$|At the FBI, Krycek confesses that Billy Miles {{is one of}} a {{new type}} of aliens that are trying to wipe out humanity's ability to survive the invasion—including Scully's baby, which Krycek states is a special child that the aliens fear. Mulder tells Doggett to send for help. Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) arrives as Miles shows up at the J. Edgar Hoover Building. Scully is able to sneak out of the {{building}} with the help of Krycek, Doggett and Reyes. Mulder and Skinner, meanwhile, lead Miles to the roof, where Mulder pushes him off into a waiting <b>garbage</b> <b>truck,</b> which then compacts him. Scully and Reyes pull away. The episode ends with Agent Crane pointing them to safety, then turning around, revealing to the camera that he is a Super Soldier.|$|E
5|$|Later drafts see vice made {{central to}} the plot, with the Le Chiffre {{character}} becoming head {{of a network of}} brothels (as he is in the novel) whose patrons are then blackmailed by Le Chiffre to fund Spectre (an invention of the screenwriter). The racy plot elements opened up by this change of background include a chase scene through Hamburg's red light district that results in Bond escaping whilst disguised as a female mud wrestler. New characters appear such as Lili Wing, a brothel madam and former lover of Bond whose ultimate fate is to be crushed {{in the back of a}} <b>garbage</b> <b>truck,</b> and Gita, wife of Le Chiffre. The beautiful Gita, whose face and throat are hideously disfigured as a result of Bond using her as a shield during a gunfight in the same sequence which sees Wing meet her fate, goes on to become the prime protagonist in the torture scene that features in the book, a role originally Le Chiffre's.|$|E
5|$|The Voyage Home was {{the first}} Star Trek film to {{extensively}} film on location—only one day was spent doing so in The Search for Spock. Much of the production was filmed in and around San Francisco during ten days of shooting. The production wanted to film scenes that were readily identifiable as the city. The use of extensive location shooting caused logistical problems; {{a scene in which}} Kirk is nearly run over by an irate cab driver required 12–15cars to be repositioned if the shot was incorrect, taking a half-hour to reshoot. Other scenes were filmed in the city but used sets rather than real locations, such as an Italian restaurant where Taylor and Kirk eat. In the film, the Bird-of-Prey lands cloaked in Golden Gate Park, surprising trashmen who flee the scene in their truck. The production had planned to film in the real park, where they had filmed scenes for The Wrath of Khan, but heavy rains before the day of shooting prevented it—the <b>garbage</b> <b>truck</b> would have become bogged down in the mud. Will Rogers Park in western Los Angeles was used instead.|$|E

John Cena then came to Sting's aid, which prompted Triple H to book a tag team contest involving the four wrestlers: Sting and Cena won after Sting made Rollins tap out to the Scorpion Deathlock. Sting suffered a legit neck injury during his championship match against Rollins at Night of Champions, but was able to complete the bout in a losing effort.|$|E

At the event, Kane, Strowman, Miz, Cesaro, and Sheamus lost a 5-on-3 handicap Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match against Kurt Angle, Dean Ambrose, and Seth Rollins when Angle pinned Miz. During the match, Kane betrayed Strowman by chokeslamming him through the stage, crushing him with steel chairs, and then trapping him inside of a <b>garbage</b> <b>truck.</b> The following night on Raw, Kane defeated Finn Bálor. On the October 30 episode of Raw, Kane chokeslammed SmackDown General Manager Daniel Bryan and hit Finn Bálor with a Tombstone Piledriver on the entrance stage.

500|$|On April 7, 1972 McCoy staged {{the best-known}} of the {{so-called}} [...] "copycat" [...] hijackings (see above). He boarded United Airlines' Flight855 (a Boeing727 with aft stairs) in Denver, and brandishing what later {{proved to be a}} paperweight resembling a hand grenade and an unloaded handgun, he demanded four parachutes and $500,000. After delivery of the money and parachutes at San Francisco International Airport, McCoy ordered the aircraft back into the sky and bailed out over Provo, Utah, leaving behind his handwritten hijacking instructions and his fingerprints on a magazine he had been reading. He was arrested on April 9 with the ransom cash in his possession, and after trial and conviction, received a 45-year sentence. Two years later he escaped from Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary with several accomplices by crashing a <b>garbage</b> <b>truck</b> through the main gate. Tracked down three months later in Virginia Beach, McCoy was killed in a shootout with FBI agents.|$|E
500|$|The {{events of}} Wings for My Flight take place {{throughout}} 1975. Marcy Cottrell Houle (then [...] "Marcy Cottrell"), a 21-year-old wildlife biologist, is sent by her supervisor, Barry Layne, to the U.S. Forest Service office near Chimney Rock in Colorado, where {{a pair of}} peregrine falcons reside. The pair {{is one of only}} seven pairs remaining in the Rocky Mountains region. Mr. Preston Fitch, an administrator involved with the peregrine falcon project, criticizes Houle for her lack of experience in the field upon meeting her. Nevertheless, Mr. Fitch introduces Houle to Chimney Rock. He explains that the Forest Service spent {{more than half a million}} dollars building a road which led to Chimney Rock; work on the road had to be discontinued upon discovery of the falcons. Further, the Chimney Rock area is home to 250 Anasazi ruins dated between 900 and 1100. The Chimney Rock community had been planning a million-dollar development to build a tourist attraction for the ruins. Houle spends several weeks with the peregrine falcons, recording her observations in her notebook. In spite of her initial attempt at maintaining an impersonal relationship with the falcons, Houle names the female peregrine [...] "Jenny" [...] and the male [...] "King Arthur". In the middle of June, after Houle had spent several days of making field observations alone and with limited equipment, Mr. Fitch introduces Houle to her teammate, Alex Porter. He also provides them with a <b>garbage</b> <b>truck</b> for transportation.|$|E
