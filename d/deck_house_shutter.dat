The upper <b>deck</b> <b>housed</b> the bridge, radio and navigation {{room in the}} front, workshops for engines and planes, med-bay, boats and arresting cable machines {{in the middle and}} back. Along the whole deck were cabins for the 80 soldiers for both ships and planes plus the pilots. The middle <b>deck</b> <b>housed</b> anchors and catapult mechanisms, aircraft fuel tanks, main and auxiliary engines, food storage and rudder control.

40|$|Planing crafts were {{specifically}} designed to achieve relatively high speeds on the water. When a planing craft is running at high speed, dynamic pressure on the bottom makes the boat rise {{on the surface of}} the water. This reduces the area of the sinking surface of the boat to increase air resistance. Air resistance means the resistance that occurs when the hull and <b>deck</b> <b>house</b> over the surface of the water come in contact with the air current. In this paper, we carried out a CFD numerical analysis to find optimal <b>deck</b> <b>houses</b> that decreased air-resistance on the water when planing crafts are running at high speed. We finally developed the <b>deck</b> <b>house</b> shape of high-speed planing crafts that optimally decreased air resistance...|$|R
