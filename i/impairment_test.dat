40|$|IAS 36 {{states that}} both {{tangible}} and intangible assets must {{be subjected to}} <b>impairment</b> <b>test.</b> This is based on net-selling price and value-in-use, the latter being measured by “…(a) estimating the future cash inflows and outflows to be derived from continuing use of the asset and from its ultimate disposal; and (b) applying the appropriate discount rate to these future cash flows. ” In order to calculate value-in-use, the Appendix A to IAS 36 clearly offers a Discounted Cash Flows (DCF) approach for the <b>impairment</b> <b>test,</b> where the appropriate discount rate can be calculated as « [...] . the entity’s weighted average cost of capital determined using techniques such as the Capital Asset Pricing Model; [...] . » (IAS 36 : Paragraph A 17). A large body of literature developed within Finance theory has plainly demonstrated that a CAPM-based DCF approach suffers from many pitfalls that systematically lead to a huge under-valuation of both assets and investment projects. In particular, when uncertainty is combined with managerial flexibility, the implementation of a CAPM-based DCF approach produces the highest undervaluation. On the basis of such evidence, it is expected the CAPM-based DCF approach proposed by IAS 36 for the <b>impairment</b> <b>test</b> results in over-impairment of assets, therefore depressing companies’ book and market values. The Real Options Analysis and Valuation (ROV) approach has been developed in order to overcome the under-valuation problem. It could be contended, therefore, that ROV could be employed in order to carry on the <b>impairment</b> <b>test</b> required by IAS 36. However such view should be carefully analysed, since the compliance of ROV with IAS 36 and the effects of a ROV-based <b>impairment</b> <b>test</b> (ROVIT) should be assessed. The paper shows that ROVIT is a theoretically feasible alternative since it is compliant with IAS 36, and it is also better than a CAPM-based <b>impairment</b> <b>test</b> (CAPMIT) as for the effects on investors’ decision-making. From a value relevance perspective, ROVIT results in higher correlation between book and economic (market) values and returns. The paper discusses the theoretical acceptability of ROVIT from the analysis of its consistency with the letter of IAS 36, and works on a simulation model in order to analyse and presents pros and cons of ROVIT versus CAPMIT. Finally, the paper highlights some peculiar problems related to the employing of ROV for <b>impairment</b> <b>test,</b> especially {{from the point of view}} of prudence/conservatis...|$|E

The results indicate that, in 2009, most companies did not disclose any information required for the goodwill <b>impairment</b> <b>test.</b> In 2010 and 2011, however, the percentage of companies that did not disclose anything about the procedures adopted for the test dropped.

My results indicate that over-investment in PPE (or capital expenditures) is lower following IFRS adoption among EU firms that used historical cost accounting with <b>impairment</b> <b>testing</b> in the post-IFRS period, consistent with EU firms having more timely loss recognition for PPE under IFRS strict impairment rules. In my analysis of United Kingdom (UK) firms, I find that most UK firms elected to use historical cost accounting with <b>impairment</b> <b>testing</b> for PPE after IFRS mandatory adoption.

40|$|The {{application}} of <b>Impairment</b> <b>Test</b> on Goodwill {{is one of}} the most debated issues in the international arena, both in relation to the multiple profiles of subjectivity inherent in the valuation criteria set out in IAS 36 and in relation to the novelty that brings this procedure. For this reason, in our work we analyze Goodwill, <b>Impairment</b> <b>Test</b> and the international regulations governing them that are IAS 36 and IFRS 3. The Goodwill is an important asset for some companies, an intangible asset that arises as a result of the acquisition of one company by another for a premium value. Its assessment is, however, discretionary. Main objective of this paper is to analyze this discretionary and check whether the information resulting from the <b>Impairment</b> <b>Test</b> on Goodwill is in accordance with the provisions of IAS 36. The empirical analysis has been developed on a selected sample relative to utilities in Europe who had recorded higher Goodwill in 2012. The results show that disclosures do not always conform to the requirements of IAS 36; in particular, there is a reluctance of the company managements in providing quantitative information about the sensitivity analysis of the <b>Impairment</b> <b>Test</b> results. The practical implications lead to stress that the reader of the financial statements is not facilitated, not only he fails to assess the effects on the recoverability of the value but also to recognize the reliability of the estimate...|$|E

There has been much criticism of this new <b>impairment</b> <b>testing</b> regime, principally along the lines that it results in an increased potential for opportunism in financial statement preparation due to the subjective and unverifiable nature of a range of judgements necessary to the execution of the <b>impairment</b> <b>testing</b> process.

40|$|The European Union Regulation no. 1606 / 2002 made it {{mandatory}} for all EU listed companies to prepare {{consolidated financial statements}} in accordance with International Accounting Standards (IAS) for each financial year starting on or after 1 January 2005. As it is well known, the implementation of <b>impairment</b> <b>test</b> is emerging {{as one of the}} most debated issues. In particular, the <b>impairment</b> <b>test</b> for intangible assets is rather complex and will become even more important in consideration of the ongoing amendment of IAS 38 (Intangible Assets) and IAS 36 (<b>Impairment</b> <b>Test)</b> which is currently carried out by the IASB “Business Combination Project” in the footsteps of US’s SFAS 141 and SFAS 142. The purpose of the paper is to challenge IAS 36 Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) approach to <b>impairment</b> <b>test</b> by proposing Real Options Analysis (ROA) as a fruitful and viable methodology for giving content to this test. At present, the <b>impairment</b> <b>test</b> of intangible assets follows the general rules provided by IAS 36, and it is based on net-selling price and value-in-use. The latter is measured by “…(a) estimating the future cash inflows and outflows to be derived from continuing use of the asset and from its ultimate disposal; and (b) applying the appropriate discount rate to these future cash flows. ” Unfortunately, DCF approach undervalues systematically high-risk assets since it does not account for managerial flexibility giving the firm the opportunity to take advantage of positive states of nature without suffering from bad ones. This flexibility, usually referred to as real option, is often connected with and arises from intangible assets and, if it is not incorporated in the value-in-use calculation, intangible assets could be unfairly impaired. Indeed, looking at the finance literature, ROA application to intangible investments, such as R&D investments, patents and licences, has often demonstrated the pitfalls of DCF approach in assessing their value. In spite of its theoretical fairness in measuring value-in-use, ROA should be implemented with caution. An asset could provide the firm an option to grow or expand. Nevertheless, such an option could ask for new investments to be made and this could violate IAS 36. Current formulation of IAS 36 requires in fact that future cash flows to be considered for the value-in-use valuation should be estimated for an asset with the reference to its present state without taking into account other investments (“stand-alone asset” approach). The extent of ROA applicability, then, is to be carefully determined and the typologies of real options to be considered in the asset value-in-use valuation should be clearly identified. Some numerical examples will also be provided in order to reinforce the theoretical conclusions of the paper. Despite those technical bewares, the paper nonetheless sets a case for the employment of ROA – instead of DCF approach –for the practical implementation of the <b>impairment</b> <b>test</b> for European companie...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This paper aims at {{examining}} {{the quality of}} corporate disclosure about goodwill impairment and its relationship with goodwill write-offs and earnings performance, exploiting an accounting regulation that allows significant unverifiable estimates whilst requires {{a high level of}} information. Design/methodology/approach: This study, based on a sample of Italian and British firms with market indications of goodwill impairment, verifies through a both univariate and multivariate analysis whether the level of disclosure is positively related to the magnitude of goodwill write-off and to earnings performance, using a self-constructed score of mandatory disclosure about goodwill impairment tests in accordance with IAS 36 requirements. Findings: In a general context of insufficient information, we find that for Italian firms both the magnitude of goodwill write-offs and earnings performance are significantly and positively associated to the level of mandatory disclosure about goodwill impairment tests. For the British firms, as companies more used to <b>impairment</b> <b>test</b> rules, the data does not confirm any significant association. Research limitations/implications: The objective {{of this study is to}} test the initial impact of IAS 36 in the first years of its application, selecting a sample of firms belonging to limited but significant activity sectors.
