Eventually, Calvin lost patience {{and refused to}} respond; by this time Servetus had written around thirty letters to Calvin. Calvin was particularly outraged when Servetus sent him {{a copy of the}} Institutes of the Christian Religion heavily annotated with arguments pointing to errors in the book. When Servetus mentioned that he would come to Geneva, [...] "Espeville" [...] (Calvin) wrote a letter to Farel on 13 February 1546 noting that if Servetus were to come, he would not assure him safe conduct: [...] "for if he came, as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>my</b> authority goes, I would not let him leave alive." ...|$|E

Khánh said Taylor and the US would need to be [...] "more practical and not have a dream of having Vietnam be an image of the United States, because the way of life and people are entirely different." [...] He added that Taylor's [...] "attitude during the last 48 hours—as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>my</b> small head is concerned—has been beyond imagination". Justifying the removal of the HNC, Khánh said they were [...] "exploited by counter-revolutionary elements who placed partisan considerations above the homeland's sacred interest."

Taylor is not serving his country well." ...|$|E
500|$|In Leipzig, Bache studied piano with Ignaz Moscheles and {{composition}} with Carl Reinecke. He also {{became friends with}} a fellow student, Arthur Sullivan, who, he wrote, [...] "cannot play well, but ... has written some things which I think show great talent." [...] Another fellow student Bache knew well, though they were not especially close, was Edvard Grieg. While the city was reportedly past the halcyon days it had experienced under Mendelssohn, it proved valuable for exposing Bache to artists such as Pauline Viardot, Giulia Grisi, Joseph Joachim and Henri Vieuxtemps, and {{to the music of}} Beethoven, Bellini, Chopin, Moritz Hauptmann and Mendelssohn. He applied himself to his piano studies, but by his own admission wasted much time in Leipzig and lacked direction. In Brother Musicians, Constance quotes [...] "a musician of high standing" [...] who was one of his circle of friends (possibly Sullivan or the pianist Franklin Taylor), who explained, [...] "You see in Leipzig nobody was compelled to work, there being no particular supervision; and there was always plenty to do, in the way of amusement, for the less energetic. As <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>my</b> recollection goes Bache was at that time rather given to working by fits and starts, frequently making excellent resolutions, the effect of which did not last many days." ...|$|E

Ray Illingworth only discovered this {{when he was asked}} for a comment by a journalist in the morning {{and the rest of the}} team when they read the newspapers at the airport.

2500|$|After the game, Lyle Blackwood {{criticized the}} referee's ruling of Freddie Solomon's fumble as an {{incomplete}} pass. [...] "You don't want {{the game to}} hinge on that play, but you never know," [...] Blackwood said. [...] "I could have taken the ball up the sideline. That's a 14-point swing." [...] However, other Dolphins were not convinced. [...] "We were dominated {{to the point where}} one play didn't make much of a difference," [...] said Dolphins coach Don Shula. [...] "Our major objective was to contain Montana, and we did a terrible, terrible job of it," [...] added defensive coach Chuck Studley. Even Reggie Roby, who averaged only 39.3 yards per punt and didn't place any of his 6 punts inside the 20, took some responsibility for the loss. [...] "I was trying to kill the ball, and I kicked it bad," [...] he said. [...] "I didn't hit one well. I was scared – scared to make a mistake. It was the worst game of my life, counting high school, college, counting everything." [...] Meanwhile, in the 49ers' locker room, Joe Montana had his own explanation for the win. [...] "As <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>my</b> own game, well, I'd have to admit it was pretty close to the best I've ever played. I didn't throw anything I didn't have confidence in.

2500|$|In an {{interview}} {{published in the}} alternative weekly Montreal Mirror on June 8, Day addressed some of the perceptions that he was homophobic. He began by denying that he had ever referred to homosexuality as a [...] "mental disorder". He acknowledged having gay staffers working on his campaign: [...] "First of all, as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>my</b> campaign, I don't ask people if they're homosexual, lesbian or heterosexual. People who are working on my campaign are doing so because they believe in me. That doesn't mean that they necessarily agree 100 per cent with everything I believe. But in principle they're saying we think you can take this Alliance {{to the next step}} and we think you'd be good for Canada. So I don't ask. Nobody has to pass a sex test to be on this campaign." [...] But the statement that made headlines in newspapers across the country was Day's acknowledgment that he would indeed consider using the Notwithstanding Clause to block a Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage, then a distinct possibility that was unnerving many social conservatives. After being pressed by journalist Matthew Hays on the Notwithstanding Clause question, Day replied [...] "Yes, and the reason I say that is because such a significant number of constituents would reflect concern on that and would want the discussion. The Alberta position on this is that the definition of marriage changing would allow {{for the use of the}} Notwithstanding Clause. That's because the sense of the elected officials in Alberta is that the people would be significantly motivated on that issue." ...|$|E
2500|$|Snow {{wrote that}} the series in Australia [...] "emphasised the gulf between players and administrators" [...] and [...] "I was sick of the biased {{attitude}} and incompetence which was apparent in cricket administration".

After Snow had bowled more than 50 eight-ball overs in the First Test he was rested for the state match against Western Australia, but Clark insisted that he practice in the nets with the others.

When the team returned to England Illingworth said that [...] "all hell would break loose" [...] if anyone was denied his good conduct bonus (as with Fred Trueman in the West Indies in 1953–54.), but this did not happen. However, Geoffrey Boycott and John Snow had to report to Lord's for a dressing down by the Secretary of the M.C.C. Billy Griffith for their behaviour.|$|E

[...] She added that in real life, she was nothing like the person people see in her videos and performances: [...] "I'm really more quiet, reserved. I speak when spoken to and polite.

Sasha Fierce formally introduced Sasha Fierce as her alter ego; she revealed that Sasha was born during the making of her single [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] (2003). In an interview with People magazine, Knowles affirmed that her alter ego is strictly for the stage and Sasha Fierce was further described as the singer's sensual, aggressive alter ego. In October 2008, Billboard magazine reported that Knowles would go on tour in the spring of 2009 to support her third studio album. Beyoncé's father and manager Mathew Knowles revealed that it would visit different countries worldwide. The tour dates for the European leg were announced in December 2008. During an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Knowles confirmed that she was excited about the tour and that she would be backed by her all-female band which also accompanied her during her previous tour The Beyoncé Experience (2007). She also stated that she worked on the tour for eight months, rehearsing and trying to put the set list together. Knowles further revealed that the twelve-hour rehearsals for the tour included dancing the choreography in heels for two months before it commenced. She also added that she learnt to make transition from herself to Sasha Fierce really fast for the performances. Knowles further acknowledged that I Am... World Tour was a huge production and that she was proud of the theatrical show she created.
