60|$|Their road wound onward {{among the}} hills, which rose steep and lofty from the scanty level space that lay between them. They {{continually}} thrust their great bulks before the wayfarers, as if grimly resolute to forbid their passage, or closed abruptly behind them, when they still dared to proceed. A gigantic hill would set its {{foot right down}} before them, and only {{at the last moment}} would grudgingly withdraw it, just far enough to let them creep towards another obstacle. Adown these rough heights were visible the dry tracks of many a mountain torrent that had lived a life too fierce and passionate to be a long one. Or, perhaps, a stream was yet hurrying shyly along the edge of a far wider bed of pebbles and shelving rock than it seemed to need, though not too wide for the swollen rage of which this shy rivulet was capable. A stone bridge bestrode it, the ponderous arches of which were upheld and rendered indestructible by the weight of the very stones that threatened to crush them down. Old Roman toil was perceptible in the foundations of that massive bridge; the <b>first</b> <b>weight</b> that it ever bore was that of an army of the Republic.|$|E
60|$|The course {{which the}} confederates {{decided to pursue}} in order to effect their object, was to proceed to Ostia, where Claudius still remained, and there make known to him what Messalina and Silius had done, and {{endeavor}} {{to convince him that}} this audacious conduct on their part was only the prelude to open violence against the life of the emperor. It would seem, however, that no one of them was quite willing to take upon himself the office of making such a communication as this, in the first instance, to such a man. They did not know how he would receive it,--or against whom the <b>first</b> <b>weight</b> of his resentment and rage would fall. Finally, after much hesitation and debate, they concluded to employ a certain female for the purpose,--a courtesan named Calpurnia. Calpurnia was a favorite and companion of Claudius, and as such they thought she might perhaps have an opportunity to approach him with the subject under such circumstances as to diminish the danger. At any rate, Calpurnia was easily led by such inducements as the conspirators laid before her, to undertake the commission. They not only promised her suitable rewards, but they appealed also to the jealousy and hatred which such a woman would naturally feel toward Messalina, who, being a wife, while Calpurnia was only a companion and favorite, would of course be regarded as a rival and enemy. They represented to Calpurnia how entirely changed for the better her situation would be, if Messalina could once be put out of the way. There would then, they said, be none to interfere with her; but her influence and ascendency over the emperor's mind would be established on a permanent and lasting footing.|$|E
60|$|The next {{favorite}} {{remedy is}} a place-bill. The same principle guides in both; I mean, the opinion which is entertained by many, of the infallibility {{of laws and}} regulations, in the cure of public distempers. Without being as unreasonably doubtful as many are unwisely confident, I will only say, that this also is a matter very well worthy of serious and mature reflection. It {{is not easy to}} foresee, what the effect would be, of disconnecting with Parliament the greatest part of those who hold civil employments, and of such mighty and important bodies as the military and naval establishments. It were better, perhaps, that they should have a corrupt interest in the forms of the constitution, than that they should have none at all. This is a question altogether different from the disqualification of a particular description of revenue-officers from seats in Parliament; or, perhaps, of all the lower sorts of them from votes in elections. In the former case, only the few are affected; in the latter, only the inconsiderable. But a great official, a great professional, a great military and naval interest, all necessarily comprehending many people of the <b>first</b> <b>weight,</b> ability, wealth, and spirit, has been gradually formed in the kingdom. These new interests must be let into a share of representation, else possibly they may be inclined to destroy those institutions of which they are not permitted to partake. This is not a thing to be trifled with; nor is it every well-meaning man that is fit to put his hands to it. Many other serious considerations occur. I do not open them here, because they are not directly to my purpose; proposing only to give the reader some taste of the difficulties that attend all capital changes in the constitution; just to hint the uncertainty, to say no worse, of being able to prevent the court, as long as it has the means of influence abundantly in its power, of applying that influence to Parliament; and perhaps, if the public method were precluded, of doing it in some worse and more dangerous method. Underhand and oblique ways would be studied. The science of evasion, already tolerably understood, would then be brought to the greatest perfection. It is no inconsiderable part of wisdom, to know how much of an evil ought to be tolerated; lest, by attempting a degree of purity impracticable in degenerate times and manners, instead of cutting off the subsisting ill-practices, new corruptions might be produced for the concealment and security of the old. It were better, undoubtedly, that no influence at all could affect the mind of a member of Parliament. But of all modes of influence, in my opinion, a place under the government is the least disgraceful to the man who holds it, and by far the most safe to the country. I would not shut out that sort of influence which is open and visible, which is connected with the dignity and the service of the state, when it is not in my power to prevent the influence of contracts, of subscriptions, of direct bribery, and those innumerable methods of clandestine corruption, which are abundantly {{in the hands of the}} court, and which will be applied as long as these means of corruption, and the disposition to be corrupted, have existence amongst us. Our constitution stands on a nice equipoise, with steep precipices and deep waters upon all sides of it. In removing it from a dangerous leaning towards one side, there may be a risk of oversetting it on the other. Every project of a material change in a government so complicated as ours, combined at the same time with external circumstances still more complicated, is a matter full of difficulties: in which a considerate man will not be too ready to decide; a prudent man too ready to undertake; or an honest man too ready to promise. They do not respect the public nor themselves, who engage for more than they are sure that they ought to attempt, or that they are able to perform. These are my sentiments, weak perhaps, but honest and unbiassed; and submitted entirely to the opinion of grave men, well-affected to the constitution of their country, and of experience in what may best promote or hurt it.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} {{research}} on stress distribution and failure depth of mining floor during the <b>first</b> <b>weighting</b> of main roof, {{based on the}} analysis of abutment pressure distribution in this case, an elastic mechanics model is established to cal-culate the stress of any point in the floor, expressions for this model are deduced, and meanwhile a failure criterion of floor rock is put forward according to the Mohr-Coulomb failure criteria. Take the parameters of 3612 mining face of Zhu Zhuang coal mine as an example, through solving stress distribution of mining floor during its <b>first</b> <b>weighting</b> of main roof, stress contour and failure district of floor are given out. The result shows that, the failure depth of 3612 mining floor is 12. 4 m, which is rather close to the measured value 13 m, thus the utility and reliability of this study method is well veri-fied. The result provides theoretical basis for bottom grouting strengthening before the <b>first</b> <b>weighting</b> of main roof, and establishes the theoretical foundation for further research on safe mining on confined waters...|$|R

This was {{quite different from the}} current experience. In this research work, field measurements and theoretical analysis were conducted to study the mechanisms of this uncommon phenomenon. The results showed that, the sub key stratum 1 (SKS 1), which commonly {{played a major role in}} mining face strata behaviour, had broken before the <b>first</b> <b>weighting.</b> And because of its high horizontal distance above the coal seam, its long breakage interval, as well as the large bulking factor of the immediate roof, its breakage did not have influence on the mining face. Therefore, the reason for the unusual <b>weighting</b> intensity of <b>first</b> <b>weighting</b> was not because of the breakage of SKS 1 but due to the fracturing of the upper primary key strata (PKS). Also, as PKS was far away from the coal seam, its breakage had only little influence on mining face so that the weighting intensity was quite weak...|$|R

The <b>first</b> <b>weighting</b> step of the Da-liu-ta 1203 working face, derived from the calculation through the revised formula, is very close to the actual measurement.
