500|$|Jonathan Rosenbaum {{from the}} Chicago Reader called Sleepy Hollow [...] "a ravishing visual experience, {{a pretty good}} vehicle for some talented American and English actors," [...] but {{concluded}} that the film was a missed opportunity to depict an actual representation of the short story.

500|$|On 5 October 2005, a {{reporter}} for the BBC News revealed that writer Andrew Davies was planning to adapt Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility into a major television drama due to be broadcast on the BBC in two years. Davies commented, [...] "When they are <b>great</b> <b>stories,</b> you keep on coming back to them and doing them in different ways with different people at different lengths." [...] Davies explained that his script was in the early stages and that no actors had yet been cast. The writer later expressed his delight at adapting the novel during an interview with Paul Carey from the Western Mail, calling Austen his [...] "favourite novelist". He also admitted that due to the acclaim he received for his adaptation of Pride and Prejudice, there was pressure on him to get Sense and Sensibility right. Davies later stated that the aim of the miniseries was to make viewers forget about Ang Lee's 1995 film adaptation of the novel.|$|E

500|$|In season three, Abby {{sets her}} {{sights on the}} wealthy Gary Ewing, the husband of her good friend Valene Ewing. While Gary {{initially}} thwarted her attempts, he eventually gave in and had a full-fledged affair with her. Actress Joan Van Ark, who played Val, said: [...] "I went in way early, whenever Donna Mills came on the show, and told David Jacobs that it made total sense that Gary would fall for Abby. Because they were celebrating Donna Mills and she became the center I can’t believe I did that but it really provided us with some <b>great</b> <b>stories.</b> And it was the longest running story on the show." [...] Dan Lewis of the Sarasota Journal said, [...] "In a recent episode, Abby lures Gary Ewing into an affair, and sets it up so that his wife will discover it. After she completed the scene, Miss Mills recalls, the crew hissing at her – jokingly, of course." [...] The character was known for her numerous rivalries with other female characters, such as Paige and Karen. Carole Glinez said, [...] "Mills' character faced her rival Paige, played by future Desperate Housewives sexpot Nicollette Sheridan." ...|$|E
500|$|On 10 November 2005, Julia Day from The Guardian {{reported}} ITV controller of drama, Nick Elliott, {{had ordered}} three new adaptations of Mansfield Park, Northanger Abbey and Persuasion. Elliot {{commented that the}} adaptations would be [...] "important remakes for the new generation". He explained, [...] "About every 10 years, all the <b>great</b> <b>stories</b> need retelling. These films will be very much 2007 films... we've asked and pushed the production team to make them young. Her stories always make great TV drama and our Jane Austen season will feature the absolute cream of British acting talent." [...] Elliott revealed that he had deliberately shied away from ordering adaptations of Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility to focus on Austen's lesser known works. Each of the productions were made by a different company, cast and directors, so they had [...] "a distinct look". They were also made {{to appeal to a}} younger audience that might have previously switched off other Austen adaptations. Northanger Abbey was given a budget of £2 million, and it marked only the second filmed adaptation of the book; with the first being made and broadcast in 1986.|$|E
500|$|Valene's {{relationship}} with Gary {{is important to}} the understanding of her overall character. The Gary/Abby/Valene love triangle, which involved Gary cheating on Valene with Abby Cunningham – the show's main villain – was a monumental storyline for all three characters. Van Ark described the storyline:"There wasn’t really anything I could think of, but I will mention that Ted and I went in way early, whenever Donna Mills came on the show, and told David Jacobs that it made total sense that Gary would fall for Abby. I can’t believe I did that but it really provided me with some <b>great</b> <b>stories.</b> Because they were celebrating Donna Mills and she became the center but Gary and Val were supposed to be this enduring couple. Ted and I were saying Gary and Val should break up and Gary should go with Abby. It was a pretty big deal to break up the couple that the show began with. So (the producers) were going toward this, then they pulled away but eventually returned to it. David Jacobs was against it but we convinced him. And it was the longest running story on the show. It took a long time for them to get back together. Eight years." ...|$|E
