As high-paying white-collar employment in <b>financial</b> <b>institutions</b> and other service industries replaced long-departed blue-collar jobs in the industrial sector, real estate speculators found that they could profit from new condos and co-ops either by replacing old buildings or by renovating them.|$|E
5|$|Cluj-Napoca and the {{surrounding}} area (Cluj County) had a rate of 268 criminal convictions per 100,000 inhabitants during 2006, just above the national average.

Although the overall crime rate is reassuringly low, petty crime can be an irritant for foreigners, as in other large cities of Romania.

5|$|Researchers found {{evidence}} that significant deviations from CIRP during {{the onset of the}} global financial crisis in 2007 and 2008 were driven by concerns over risk posed by counter parties to banks and <b>financial</b> <b>institutions</b> in Europe and the US in the foreign exchange swap market. The European Central Bank's efforts to provide US dollar liquidity in the foreign exchange swap market, along with similar efforts by the Federal Reserve, had a moderating impact on CIRP deviations between the dollar and the euro. Such a scenario was found to be reminiscent of deviations from CIRP during the 1990s driven by struggling Japanese banks which looked toward foreign exchange swap markets to try and acquire dollars to bolster their creditworthiness.|$|E

40|$|A <b>financial</b> <b>institution</b> {{involved}} in commercial lending makes a short-term loan (for example, 90 days) to a borrower under a long-term credit commitment (for example, 5 years). The <b>financial</b> <b>institution</b> transfers the short-term loan, without recourse, to a third-party purchaser {{for the remaining}} term of the loan. The risk of loss relating to the short-term loan is legally transferred to the purchaser, and the <b>financial</b> <b>institution</b> has no contractual obligation to repurchase the shortterm loan. Under the long-term credit commitment, the <b>financial</b> <b>institution</b> may, at the maturity of the short-term loan, relend to the borrower. However, the <b>financial</b> <b>institution</b> may refuse to relend to the borrower based on a current credit evaluation or if any covenant under the long-term commitment is not satisfied. The issue is whether {{the transfer of the}} short-term loan should be accounted for as a sale or as a financing. Copyright © 2010, Financial Accounting Standards Board Not for redistributio...|$|R
