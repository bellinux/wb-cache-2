However, in 2003 it was discovered to be extremely weakly radioactive: its only primordial isotope, bismuth-209, decays via alpha decay with a half-life {{more than a billion}} times the estimated age of the universe.

5|$|Alternative {{representations}} of 1 also occur in non-integer bases. For example, {{in the golden}} ratio base, the two standard representations are 1.000... and 0.101010..., and there are infinitely many more representations that include adjacent 1s. Generally, <b>for</b> <b>almost</b> <b>all</b> q between 1 and 2, there are uncountably many base-q expansions of 1. On the other hand, there are still uncountably many q (including all natural numbers greater than 1) {{for which there is}} only one base-q expansion of 1, other than the trivial 1.000.... This result was first obtained by Paul Erdős, Miklos Horváth, and István Joó around 1990. In 1998 Vilmos Komornik and Paola Loreti determined the smallest such base, the Komornik–Loreti constant q = 1.787231650.... In this base, 1 = 0.11010011001011010010110011010011...; the digits are given by the Thue–Morse sequence, which does not repeat.|$|E
5|$|As Austen's {{works were}} {{published}} anonymously, they brought her little personal renown. They were fashionable among opinion-makers, but were rarely reviewed. Most of the reviews were short and on balance favourable, although superficial and cautious. They most often {{focused on the}} moral lessons of the novels. Sir Walter Scott, a leading novelist of the day, contributed one anonymously. Using the review as a platform to defend the then-disreputable genre of the novel, he praised Austen's realism. The other important early review was attributed to Richard Whately in 1821. However, Whately denied having authored the review, which drew favourable comparisons between Austen and such acknowledged greats as Homer and Shakespeare, and praised the dramatic qualities of her narrative. Scott and Whately set the tone <b>for</b> <b>almost</b> <b>all</b> subsequent 19th-century Austen criticism.|$|E

5|$|The {{decision}} to cast Billy Campbell as Cliff Secord caused mixed emotions amongst Disney executives. Director Joe Johnston and creator Dave Stevens believed Campbell {{was perfect for}} the role, but Disney wanted an A-list actor. Johnston eventually convinced Disney otherwise. Campbell was {{not familiar with the}} comic book when he got the part but quickly read it, in addition to books on aviation. He also prepared by listening to 1940s period music. The actor had a fear of flying but overcame it {{with the help of the}} film's aerial coordinator, Craig Hosking. To ensure his safety, Campbell was doubled <b>for</b> <b>almost</b> <b>all</b> of the flying sequences in conventional aircraft. Ultimately, a scale model devised by ILM puppeteer Tom St. Amand was used for all the rocket pack scenes.|$|E

5|$|There is no {{evidence}} that Æthelberht's influence in other kingdoms was enough for him to convert any other kings to Christianity, although this is partly {{due to the lack of}} sources—nothing is known of Sussex's history, for example, <b>for</b> <b>almost</b> <b>all</b> of the seventh and eighth centuries. Æthelberht was able to arrange a meeting in 602 in the Severn valley, on the northwestern borders of Wessex, however, and this may be an indication of the extent of his influence in the west. No evidence survives showing Kentish domination of Mercia, but it is known that Mercia was independent of Northumbria, so it is quite plausible that it was under Kentish overlordship.|$|E
5|$|After the {{development}} of larger and faster-growing hogs (due to crosses between European and Asian breeds) in the 18th and 19th century in the United States, backyard and small-scale hog production provided an inexpensive means of converting waste food, crop waste, and garbage into calories (in a relatively small space and {{in a relatively short}} period of time). Many of those calories came in the form of fat and rendered lard. Lard was used <b>for</b> <b>almost</b> <b>all</b> cooking and was a fundamental component in many common homestead foods (many that today are still regarded as holiday and comfort foods) like biscuits and pies. The economic/caloric necessity of consuming lard and other saved fats may have led to the popularity of fried foods, not only in the US, but worldwide. In the 19th century cast iron became widely available for use in cooking. The combination of flour, lard, a chicken and a heavy pan placed over a relatively controllable flame became the beginning of today's fried chicken.|$|E

5|$|<b>For</b> <b>almost</b> <b>all</b> {{of their}} history, Serjeants at Law and King's Serjeants {{were the only}} advocates given rights of {{audience}} in the Court of Common Pleas. Until the 17th century they were also first {{in the order of}} precedence in the Court of King's Bench and Court of Chancery, which gave them priority in motions before the court. Serjeants also had the privilege of being immune from most normal forms of lawsuit – they could only be sued by a writ from the Court of Chancery. It was held as an extension of this that servants of Serjeants could only be sued in the Common Pleas. As part of the Court of Common Pleas the Serjeants also performed some judicial duties, such as levying fines. In exchange for these privileges, Serjeants were expected to fulfil certain duties; firstly, that they represent anybody who asked regardless of their ability to pay, and secondly that, due to the small number of judges, they serve as deputy judges to hear cases when there was no judge available.|$|E
5|$|In 1723, Bach was {{appointed}} as Thomaskantor (director of church music) in Leipzig, {{where he was}} responsible for the music at four churches and for the training and education of boys singing in the Thomanerchor. He took office {{in the middle of the}} liturgical year, on the first Sunday after Trinity. In his first twelve months in office, Bach decided to compose new works <b>for</b> <b>almost</b> <b>all</b> liturgical events, known as his first cantata cycle. The year after, he continued that effort, composing chorale cantatas based on Lutheran hymns. He kept the format of the chorale cantata cycle until Palm Sunday of 1725, but then repeated an early Easter cantata, Christ lag in Todes Banden, BWV 4, on Easter Sunday, and wrote Bleib bei uns, denn es will Abend werden for Easter Monday as the first cantata in that cycle that was not a chorale cantata. The change was possibly due to the loss of a librettist.|$|E
5|$|The redback spider {{has been}} {{historically}} {{responsible for more}} envenomations requiring antivenom than any other creature in Australia, however by 2017 the spider was blamed for only 250 envenomations requiring antivenom annually. Estimates {{of the number of}} people thought to be bitten by redback spiders each year across Australia range from 2,000 to 10,000. The larger female spider is responsible <b>for</b> <b>almost</b> <b>all</b> cases of redback spider bites. The smaller male was thought to be unable to envenomate a human, although some cases have been reported; their rarity is probably due to the male's smaller size and proportionally smaller fangs, rather than the male being incapable of biting or lacking potent venom. The bite from both juvenile and mature females appears to have similar potency. The male bite usually only produces short-lived, mild pain. Most bites occur in the warmer months between December and April, in the afternoon or evening. As the female redback is slow-moving and rarely leaves her web, bites generally occur as a result of placing a hand or other body part too close to the spider, such as when reaching into dark holes or wall cavities. Bites often also occur when a hidden spider is disturbed in items such as clothes, shoes, gloves, building materials, garden tools or children's outdoor toys.|$|E
