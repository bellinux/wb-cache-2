5|$|Bewick {{made use}} of his close {{observation}} of nature, his remarkable visual memory, and his sharp eyesight to create accurate and extremely small details in his wood engravings, which proved to be both a strength and a weakness. If properly printed and closely examined, his prints could be seen to convey subtle clues {{to the character of}} his natural subjects, with humour and feeling. This was achieved by carefully varying the depth of the engraved grooves to provide actual greys, not only black and white, as well as the pattern of the marks to provide texture. But this subtlety of engraving created a serious technical difficulty for his printers; they needed to ink his blocks with <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> ink, mixed so as to be of exactly the right thickness, and to press the block to the paper slowly and carefully, to obtain a result that would satisfy Bewick. Not surprisingly, this made printing slow and expensive. It also created a problem for Bewick's readers; if they lacked his excellent eyesight, they needed a magnifying glass to study his prints, especially the miniature tail-pieces. But the effect was transformative, and wood engraving became the main method of illustrating books for a century. The quality of Bewick's engravings attracted a far wider readership to his books than he had expected: his Fables and Quadrupeds were at the outset intended for children.|$|E

Fleets {{that did not have}} well-drilled, experienced oarsmen and skilled commanders relied more on boarding with superior infantry (such as increasing the complement to 40 soldiers). Ramming attempts were countered by keeping the bow towards the enemy until the enemy crew tired, and then attempting to board as quickly as possible. A double-line formation could be used to achieve a breakthrough by engaging the first line and then rushing the rearguard in to take advantage of weak spots in the enemy's defense. This required superiority in numbers, though, since a shorter front risked being flanked or surrounded.|$|E

Sundermann said Scott's slightly over-the-top performance was made especially funny because he is normally such a straight man character. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix praised Scott for his ability to be both a straight man and a more outrageously funny character, as during his meltdowns in media interviews. Sepinwall also complimented Aubrey Plaza's performance and said the overall episode was very funny, but that the main storyline was resolved too quickly.|$|E

Ingrid Rubio, a sometimes shaky screen presence to date, finds her feet in this sentimental but intelligent story with quirky yet believable characters and stunning polar-circle settings. Charming fable about how people whom life has turned cold must learn to warm up again was well received at the Berlin fest, and further such showings are likely, though that's less than the movie deserves." ...|$|R

[...] Robert Ballantyne of music website Popjournalism described it as [...] "both a peppy pop track and a ballad", and called it Robyn's best single yet, stating, [...] "Producer and long-time Robyn collaborator Klas Åhlund adds <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> au courant electro-pop into the mix, but not too much to doom the track to the dance-club ghetto."

Writing for The A.V. Club, Keith Phipps rated the episode an A, calling it [...] "one of the most peculiar hours of television ever to air on a network". He praised the episode's portrayal of the Black Lodge, called the dream sequence [...] "some of the most disquieting filmmaking Lynch has ever done", and described its depiction as [...] "a weirdly All-American [...] supernatural system" [...] that seems [...] "completely terrifying". Fellow A.V. Club writer Noel Murray felt that the episode pushed [...] "into previously unexplored television territory", and that the climactic Black Lodge dream sequence came to be seen as [...] "the signature moment in the entirety of Twin Peaks".

5000|$|Double-clutching {{allows the}} driver to control the engine and {{transmission}} revolutions to synchronize, so that a smooth shift can be made; for example, when upshifting, the accelerator pedal is released and the clutch pedal is depressed while the gear lever is moved into neutral, the clutch pedal is then released and quickly pushed down again while the gear lever is moved to the next higher gear. Finally, the clutch pedal is released and the accelerator pedal pushed down to obtain required engine speed. Although this is a relatively fast movement, perhaps a second or so while transmission is in neutral, it allows the engine speed to drop and synchronize engine and transmission revolutions relative to the road speed. Downshifting is performed in a similar fashion, except the engine speed is now required to increase (while transmission is in neutral) <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>amount</b> {{in order to achieve}} the synchronization for a smooth, non-collision gear change.

The data was gathered through qualitative interviews with students and international university administrators, which provided their perspectives of the current internationalization efforts, as well as a summary of the current internationalization policies at the institution. The interviews pointed to the organizational culture of the university as a factor affecting internationalization, taking Swedish lagom culture into consideration. This discovery is followed by the application of Sporn’s Organizational Culture Typology (1996) to the institution to understand {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the university, and how to harness the strategic management style to better facilitate internationalization and thus increase the number of students pursuing studies abroad. The results suggest that a more centralized organizational university culture is a more effective way to facilitate internationalization.  Additionally, the Swedish lagom culture presents a uniquely challenging paradigm for fostering the innovative internationalization agenda in HEIs...|$|R
