40|$|Introduction: Samples {{of plant}} remains and animal bones were {{collected}} {{from a series of}} Romano-Libyan sites. With the exception of the excavations at site Lm 4, most of the excavations consisted of trial trenches in middens. These trenches were often small and the middens shallow, and the amount of botanical and faunal material collected from each site was invariably small. However, whilst the samples cannot be regarded simplistically as representative of each settlement's system of obtaining and consuming food, they at least provide a broad general picture of the range of food species available to the occupants, together with some indications of how these species were exploited. Given the paucity of such material from the pre-desert hitherto, they provide an invaluable body of new evidence for the nature of Romano-Libyan agriculture in this environment. The evidence provided by other botanical and <b>faunal</b> <b>samples</b> for agricultural systems in ensuing periods in the study area is discussed in Chapter 12. The Romano-Libyan sites from which we obtained botanical and <b>faunal</b> <b>samples</b> can be divided into two categories: large open farms and fortified farms or gsur; no samples {{were collected from}} the small farmsteads or hilltop villages. The origin of the botanical and <b>faunal</b> <b>samples</b> is described below and their location is shown in Figure 8. 1; unless otherwise stated, both botanical and faunal remains were recovered from each site excavated. Many of the sites have been mentioned in preceding chapters and full details for each of them are available in the survey gazetteer in the companion volume. All the plant remains were analysed by Marijke van der Veen; a preliminary report was published in 1985 (van der Veen, 1985). The <b>faunal</b> <b>samples</b> collected in the first four seasons were analysed by Gill Clark, who has published a preliminary report on them (Clark, 1986), and those of the last season by Annie Grant; the sites they studied are indicated by their respective initials in the following site comments.

With time, scientists are becoming {{more aware of the}} impacts of sampling on the faunal communities and are looking for less invasive ways to investigate the vent ecosystems. In this perspective, imagery analysis plays a very important role. With this study, we test which factors can be quantitatively and accurately assessed based on imagery, through comparison with <b>faunal</b> <b>sampling.</b> Twelve instrumented chains were deployed on the Atlantic Eiffel Tower hydrothermal edifice and the corresponding study sites were subsequently sampled. Discrete, quantitative samples were compared to the imagery recorded during the experiment. An observer-effect was tested, by comparing imagery data gathered by different scientists.

40|$|Toromoja I and Gwi Pan West are two mid-Holocene sites {{located in}} the Makgadikgadi Pans region of {{northern}} central Botswana. The 1980 excavations at these sites yielded good sedimentological, geomorphological, and paleobotanical data as well as microlithic Later Stone Age tools, ostrich eggshell beads, silicified reeds, and faunal bones, but no Middle Stone Age tools or extinct faunal species were recovered. Eleven mammalian genera and four reptilian genera are represented in the <b>faunal</b> <b>sample</b> from Toromoja I and Gwi Pan West. The faunal species identified represent a very plausible natural association of animal species, and an association {{which is consistent with}} the geological and paleobotanical data recovered from these sites. This association of faunal species also represents a very plausible larder for Later Stone Age (LSA) people living along the ancient lakeshore, but no direct evidence linking the faunal bones with LSA subsistence practices could be established. No diagnostic marks, such as stone tool cutmarks, toothmarks, trampling marks or polish could be discerned in the <b>faunal</b> <b>samples.</b> Many ethnoarchaeological and taphonomic studies have attempted to identify characteristic patterns of skeletal element representation, but the results of these studies are often unreliable, difficult to apply, or both. Several studies have attempted to relate patterns of skeletal element representation in faunal assemblages to bone density, but with only qualified success. The present study is the first attempt to use computed tomography CT imaging to systematically measure regional bone density, and to apply CT bone density measurements in the interpretation of faunal assemblages. The 583 density measurements obtained in the present study are used to define five CT density categories for a complete caprine skeleton and for a set of bovine long bones.

The first observations on this site were numerous clear and black smokers and surprisingly few known symbiotic species dominant in other vent {{areas on the}} MAR. The species most abundant at Ashadze- 1 are those usually found at the periphery of hydrothermal communities: sea-anemones Maractis rimicarivora and chaetopterid polychaetes Phyllochaetopterus sp. nov. This study comprised site mapping and <b>faunal</b> <b>sampling</b> and Ashadze- 1 was completely mapped by using the remote operated vehicle 'Victor 6000 ' and a new high resolution tool available for deep-sea research. A photo-mapping survey was carried out with a long range optical black and white camera. Digitization of substrata and sea-anemones visible on the images was performed by GIS. Spatial distribution of Ma. rimicarivora was distinguished by high densities of 32 ind. m− 2 {{on the western side}} of the main smoker area.

40|$|Diversity and {{community}} patterns of macro- and megafauna were compared on the Canadian Beaufort shelf and slope. <b>Faunal</b> <b>sampling</b> collected 247 taxa from 48 stations with box core and trawl gear over the summers of 2009 - 2011 between 50 and 1, 000 m in depth. Of the 80 macrofaunal and 167 megafaunal taxa, 23 % were uniques, present at only one station. Rare taxa {{were found to}} increase proportional to total taxa richness and differ between the shelf (< 100 m) where they tended to be sparse and the slope where they were relatively abundant. The macrofauna principally comprised polychaetes with nephtyid polychaetes dominant on the shelf and maldanid polychaetes (up to 92 % in relative abundance/station) dominant on the slope. The megafauna principally comprised echinoderms with Ophiocten sp. (up to 90 % in relative abundance/station) dominant on the shelf and Ophiopleura sp. dominant on the slope. Macro- and megafauna had divergent patterns of abundance, taxa richness (α diversity) and β diversity. A greater degree of macrofaunal than megafaunal variation in abundance, richness and β diversity was explained by confounding factors: location (east-west), sampling year and the timing of sampling with respect to sea-ice conditions. Change in megafaunal abundance, richness and β diversity was greatest across the depth gradient, with total abundance and richness elevated on the shelf compared to the slope. We conclude that megafaunal slope taxa were differentiated from shelf taxa, as faunal replacement not nestedness {{appears to be the}} main driver of megafaunal β diversity across the depth gradient...|$|E
40|$|Like {{hydrothermal}} vents along oceanic ridges, cold seeps are patchy {{and isolated}} ecosystems along continental margins, extending from bathyal to abyssal depths. The Atlantic Equatorial Belt (AEB), from the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of Guinea, was one {{focus of the}} Census of Marine Life ChEss (Chemosynthetic Ecosystems) program to study biogeography of seep and vent fauna. We present a review and analysis of collections from five seep regions along the AEB: the Gulf of Mexico where extensive <b>faunal</b> <b>sampling</b> has been conducted from 400 to 3300 m, the Barbados accretionary prism, the Blake ridge diapir, and in the Eastern Atlantic from the Congo and Gabon margins and the recently explored Nigeria margin. Of the 72 taxa identified at the species level, a total of 9 species or species complexes are identified as amphi-Atlantic. Similarity analyses based on both Bray Curtis and Hellinger distances among 9 faunal collections, and principal component analysis based on presence/absence of megafauna species at these sites, suggest that within the AEB seep megafauna community structure is influenced primarily by depth rather than by geographic distance. Depth segregation is observed between 1000 and 2000 m, with the middle slope sites either grouped with those deeper than 2000 m or with the shallower sites.

40|$|The aim of {{the project}} was to {{determine}} factors which explain the distribution of macroinvertebrates in two Melbourne streams both drastically affected by urbanisation. A detailed description is given of Dandenong Creek, flowing through the south-eastern suburbs, and Darebin Creek, in the northern suburbs, emphasising stream features likely, or known, to influence the drift and benthic fauna. <b>Faunal</b> <b>sampling</b> was carried out in Dandenong Creek from June 1992 until July 1993, and in Darebin Creek from February 1995 until March 1998. Physicochemical parameters were also recorded. The collected data, together with previously existing data, were analysed using multivariate analyses: non-metric multi-dimensional scaling (NMDS); analysis of similarities (ANOSIM); matching biotic and abiotic variables using BIOENV, and principal component analysis (PCA). Various biotic and diversity indices were calculated in an attempt to identify the major factors responsible for the failure of the fauna to recover from previously more seriously degraded water quality. The contribution of drift to the colonisation potential in Dandenong Creek appeared to be impacted by retarding basins, underground barrel-draining and channelization. Results also indicated that increased conductivity adversely affected the fauna in the lower reaches of Dandenong Creek. It was concluded that in Darebin Creek, high nutrient levels, as well as other pollutants, had resulted in low macroinvertebrate diversity in both the drift and benthos. If, as this study suggests, faunal diversity is a valid measure of stream health, the following factors need to be addressed for catchment-wide, stream management: lack of riparian zone vegetation (increasing bank erosion and making the benthic habitat unstable, with greater temperature variability); control of stormwater runoff (flow variability, increased conductivity, nutrient levels, sediment loads, sewage effluent, industrial discharges and heavy metals), and to modify retarding basins to increase stream continuity...|$|E
40|$|The hydrologic, geomorphic, and {{ecological}} dynamics of tropical montane streams are poorly understood {{in comparison to}} many temperate and/or alluvial rivers. Yet as the threat to tropical freshwater environments increases, information on the dynamics of relatively pristine streams is important for understanding landscape evolution, managing and conserving natural resources, and implementing stream restoration. This dissertation characterizes the geomorphology and hydrology of five adjacent watersheds draining the Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF) in northeastern Puerto Rico, and discusses implications on aquatic habitat. I performed several interrelated studies, including: (1) formulating a geographic information systems (GIS) framework to estimate hydrologic parameters from topographic information and hydrologic records, (2) developing a method to determine active stream channel boundaries (2 ̆ 2 bankfull 2 ̆ 2 stage) that allows for comparison of channel geometry {{on the basis of}} flow-frequency, (3) decoupling the relative influences of lithologic and hydraulic controls on channel morphology using an extensive field-based stream survey and analysis of stream profiles, channel geometry, and sediment dynamics, (4) linking network- and pool-scale geofluvial dynamics to the abundance of migratory fish and shrimp through a collaborative analysis combining geomorphic surveys and aquatic <b>faunal</b> <b>sampling.</b> This research indicates that these streams have some properties resembling both temperate montane and alluvial rivers. Similar to low-gradient rivers where floodplains mark channel boundaries, the active channel stage in these streams is defined by the incipient presence of woody vegetation and soil development. Systematic basin-scale geomorphic patterns are well-developed despite apparent non-fluvial and lithologic control on local channel morphology. This implies that strong fluvial forces are sufficient to override channel boundary resistance; a feature common in self-forming 2 ̆ 2 threshold 2 ̆ 2 alluvial channels. Migratory aquatic fauna abundances are influenced by a variety of geomorphic factors such as barrier waterfalls and suitable headwater habitat, and are consequently highly variable and patchy. These results stand in contrast to the notion that aquatic communities mirror systematic geomorphic gradients, but rather acknowledges the influences of multiscale geomorphic processes. Ultimately, this research provides baseline information on physical and biological processes in relatively unaltered tropical streams and can be used to inform further studies that document human interactions with stream networks. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} access the {{descriptive}} value of subterranean organisms with regard to groundwater contamination, <b>faunal</b> <b>sampling</b> was carried out at two unimpacted sites and one sewage polluted site located in the south {{eastern part of the}} Lez karst system from 1991 - 1993. Invertebrates were collected by means of an air lift pump in 8 deep monitoring wells which intersected Cretaceous and/or Jurrassic limestones. Wells of the unimpacted sites had faunal assemblages dominated by crustaceans and they harboured a high number of stygobite species which usually represented a major component {{of the total number of}} invertebrates. At the sewage polluted site, the wells had significant relative abundances of oligochaetes, lowstygobite richnesses and their groundwater fauna consisted mainly of stygoxene taxa whose relative abundance could be as high as 88 %. The spatio temporal distribution of organisms was related to the groundwater ans sewage flow patterns. During low water periods sewage polluted water moved preferentially through the conductive fractures of the saturated zone whose faunal assemblages were dominated by stygoxenes such as the polysaprobiont oligochaete Tubifex tubifex. When floods occured, these stygoxenes were flushed out of the site and were associated with stygophiles. As the source of sewage pollution decreased in intensity with time, preliminary signs of groundwater fauna recovery were observed. Oligochaetes became less abundant but recolonization of groundwater by stygobites was not yet observed. On the basis of our results and those of other authors we emphasize the advantages which could result from the development of biomonitoring programmes for the assessment of karstic groundwater contamination. / Dans la partie sud est du système karstique du Terrieu (Hérault), des prélèvements de faune ont été effectués sur trois sites de 1991 à 1993 : deux sont exempts de pollution et un site s'avère pollué par des eaux usées domestiques.

40|$|The {{study of}} the non-crustacean {{invertebrates}} dwelling on the deep Mediterranean Sea is of interest for different marine science disciplines, being the diversity of species and their distributions largely unexplored. In fact, the present Thesis conducted an effort {{in order to increase}} valid scientific information not only at taxonomical level, but also at the level of community composition and distribution. Detailed data on the reproductive biology and ethology was required for some group of ecological relevance in order to solve some relevant gaps of information. Ten multidisciplinary oceanographic cruises were conducted between October 2008 and April 2013 to sample the deep seafloor of the western Mediterranean Sea. The sampling areas included the Blanes Canyon and its adjacent open slope, the Palamós (also named La Fonera) and Cap de Creus Canyons, sea hills in the Gulf of Valencia and Eivissa Channel, and landslides on the Eivissa Channel. A total of 223 benthic trawls were completed resulting in a total swept area of 10. 3 km². Samples were also observed by means of two ROV’s. Resulting from these ten cruises, this work evidenced and updated species bathymetrical and geographical distributions ranges of non-crustacean invertebrate species by different methodologies (i. e. traditional and technologically advanced sampling). As a result of that effort, new faunistic reports were described: two first records (i. e. Gracilechinus elegans (Düben & Koren, 1844) Dicopia antirrhinum C. Monniot, 1972), three rare species (i. e. Hedingia mediterranea (Bartolini Baldelli, 1914), Penilpidia ludwigi (von Marenzeller, 1893) and Phascolosoma (Phascolosoma) turnerae (Rice, 1985), and eleven extensions of maximum depth range of distribution. This new record for Dicopia antirrhinum increased the lower depth limit of this genus in the Mediterranean Sea from 500 to 1100 m depth. This finding contributes to the knowledge of the poorly investigated Mediterranean deep ascidian fauna, in sharp contrast with the relatively well-known shallow-water Mediterranean ascidians. We also observed that densities and biomass of non-crustacean invertebrates were pointed to be significantly higher in submarine canyons than in surrounding open slopes. These findings suggest submarine canyon habitats of the north-western Mediterranean Sea as hotspots of benthic megafauna communities. The most abundant group in terms of density was the Phylum Echinodermata. A Phylum largely undescribed in deep Mediterranean waters, when compared with the faunistic data already available for the Atlantic. All specimen sampled of this Phylum were classified, described and their bathymetrical ranges re-defined. These results were compared and extended with the previous published literature, checking, validating (or discarding) all available information. The reproductive pattern of the most abundant species of Asteroidea in the present study, Ceramaster grenadensis was studied. The size pattern distribution of show a depth related trend showing smaller sizes at greater depths (dwarfism), as observed in other species of Atlantic Ocean. Additionally, juveniles were sampled at the deepest range of distribution of the species (i. e. 2250 m). Histological analysis of C. grenadensis gonads, revealed a semicontinous reproductive patterns, with a maximum of reproductive activity in autumn (maximum values of Gonadal Index). This finding coincides with some already published study for other deep-sea Mediterranean Echinoderm species such as B. lyrifera. The in situ <b>faunal</b> <b>sampling</b> with video technologies (i. e. Remotely Operated Vehicles; ROVs) showed the occurrence of different species assemblage compositions in different geomorphological habitats such as, submarine canyons, sea hills and landslides. Benthic cnidarian communities were observed in seamount rocky areas while submarine landslides fauna were mainly composed by vagil fauna as fishes and crustaceans. The description of characteristics seascape units might help to estimate taxonomical group in other similar but presently unexplored deep-sea areas. Finally, this study suggests that an increasing effort combining traditional and technologically-new sampling methods is advisable in order to obtain a more complete overview of species inhabiting the different deep-sea continental margins. En el estudio de la presente tesis se pretende realizar una exhaustiva clasificación taxonómica de las especies de invertebrados no-crustáceos muestreados en el margen catalán profundo, así como determinar sus patrones de distribución y su composición faunística. El material utilizado fue recopilado a lo largo de 10 campañas oceanográficas realizadas entre octubre 2008 y abril 2013 en el Mediterráneo occidental en el marco de los Proyecto Nacionales y Europeos PROMETEO, DOSMARES, BIOFUN, PROMARES y EUROLEON. Las áreas de muestreo incluyeron el Cañón de Blanes y su talud adyacente, los cañones de la Fonera y Cap de Creus, dos montañas submarinas ubicadas en el Golfo de Valencia y el Canal de Ibiza, y dos deslizamientos submarinos del Canal de Ibiza. Adicionalmente se realizó una campaña transmediterránea en la cual se muestrearon tres áreas del Mediterráneo, oeste, central y este. Se utilizaron para la recolección de muestras tanto métodos de muestreos tradicionales (artes de arrastre) como nuevas tecnologías de muestreo visual (ROV). Las profundidades muestreadas mediante ROV fueron de entre los 60 m y los 1100 m de profundidad; y entre los 850 m y los 2850 m mediante muestreos tradicionales. Se obtuvieron 5877 individuos distribuidos en 8 Filos, 18 Clases y 69 especies. En la presente Tesis se describe por primera vez en el Mediterráneo la presencia de dos especies: el equinoideo regular Gracilechinus elegans (Düben & Koren, 1844) y la ascidia carnívora Dicopia antirrhinum C. Monniot, 1972. Igualmente se describió la presencia de tres especies consideradas ‘raras’: las holoturias endémicas Hedingia mediterranea (Bartolini Baldelli, 1914) y Penilpidia ludwigi (von Marenzeller, 1893) así como el sipúnculido Phascolosoma (Phascolosoma) turnerae Rice, 1985.

Comparative analyses were made by <b>faunal</b> <b>samples</b> collected inside and outside in two kinds of vegetated beds: a sea grass meadows during the summer period and, an algal mats at winter one. The presence of theses vegetated beds had essentially favoring highest densities of epifaunal organisms by increase of substratum for fixation and feeding, which could to result at decrease of evenness and, consequently, of the diversity of macrofauna inside these beds such as registered at summer survey. Differences in the both evenness and diversity at winter survey as well in the composition and number of species at both times were not observed among habitats.

Comparative analyses were made by <b>faunal</b> <b>samples</b> collected inside and outside in two kinds of vegetated beds: a sea grass meadows during the summer period and, an algal mats at winter one. The presence of theses vegetated beds had essentially favoring highest densities of epifaunal organisms by increase of substratum for fixation and feeding, which could to result at decrease of evenness and, consequently, of the diversity of macrofauna inside these beds such as registered at summer survey. Differences in the both evenness and diversity at winter survey as well in the composition and number of species at both times were not observed among habitats. These results indicate that the increase at structural complexity of habitat promoted by presence of vegetated beds not necessarily favoring the increase of the macrofauna diversity of the estuarine region of the Patos Lagoon...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the diversity and}} distribution of spiders in the mangrove areas in Peninsular Malaysia which is hoped to contribute towards understanding {{the dynamics of the}} mangrove ecosystem. Little research has been done on local spiders and inventory from this habitat is rare. From <b>faunal</b> <b>samples</b> taken along transects from upper to lower zones of Morib mangrove forest and studies on available museum specimens in the Raffles Museum of Biodiversity Research (RMBR), yielded 26 species belonging to 10 family groups. There exist 4 species as new records for Malaysia which are Clubiona meraukensis, Dolomedes mizhoanus, Pardosa zhanjiangensis and Telamonia dimidiata. The jumpers or family Salticidae has an overall wide distribution across all zones sampled. Generally, the spider distribution depended on the zone location and floral diversity. Spider zonation pattern is probably influenced by complex factor combinations rather than one factor which include biotic relationships such as competition and predation...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in mass spectrometry now allow relatively routine measurements of sulphur isotopes (34 S) in small samples (> 10 mg) of tissue from archaeological human, plant, and <b>faunal</b> <b>samples.</b> 34 S values {{of human and}} faunal bone collagen can indicate residence or migration and can provide palaeodietary information. Here we present a review of applications of sulphur isotopes to archaeological materials, and we also present preliminary results {{from one of the}} few controlled feeding experiments undertaken for sulphur isotopes. This study indicates that there is relatively little fractionation (- 1) between diet and body protein (keratin) 34 S values for modern horses on a protein adequate C 3 plant diet. In contrast, horses fed a possible low protein C 4 feed have a diet to hair fractionation of + 4 that could be the result of the input of endogenous sulphur from the recycling of body proteins...|$|R
40|$|Fossil {{remains of}} rodents from Lemudong’o, southwestern Kenya, {{have been studied}} to {{understand}} the taphonomy of the faunal assemblage, and to interpret the paleoenvironment from which the fauna derived. Skeletal representation, breakage patterns, evidence of etching on the incisors, and the body size of the rodents suggest that the material was a predator assemblage that accumulated in situ, and that a small owl, and most probably a barn owl, would have been responsible. The fossil rodents recovered from the site suggest that at around 6 Ma, the environment at Lemudong’o {{and the surrounding area}} was a mosaic of open grasslands/woodlands (dry savanna), riverine forests, and flood plains. Elements of aridity and sandy substrates were also a common feature at Lemudong’o. Overall, the higher numbers of Murinae relative to Gerbillinae in the Lemudong’o <b>faunal</b> <b>sample</b> suggest that the paleoenvironment in the area would have been more mesic than xeric...|$|R
40|$|Lampreys {{were and}} {{continue}} to be an important resource for Native Americans in the Pacific Northwest. Lampreys possess several skeletal structures that are regularly identified in marine mammal and bird stomach contents and fecal samples, suggesting that lamprey elements may preserve in archaeological contexts. However, their remains have not been identified in archaeological <b>faunal</b> <b>samples</b> in the Pacific Northwest. This {{may be due to the}} lack of an adequate 2 ̆ 2 search image 2 ̆ 2 for lamprey remains among faunal analysts and limited use of line screen sampling. Descriptions and photographs of lamprey remains that are most likely to survive in archaeological contexts are presented to increase awareness of lamprey anatomy. Horn-like teeth located around the lamprey oral disc are the largest and most distinctive elements that may be encountered in archaeological samples. Use of standard 1 / 8 in. (3. 2 mm) and 1 / 16 in. (1. 6 mm) mesh will retain elements from mature adult Pacific Lampreys...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Qumran Cave 24 is {{situated}} in the Jordan Rift Valley. Its prehistoric stratigraphy spans from the late Natufian to the Chalcolitic period and these deposits yielded a large quantity of archaeological materials particularly from the Pre-Pottery Neolithic levels. The preservation of organic material was in general very good, due to the dry conditions of the area, and this fact allowed the collection of rich botanical and <b>faunal</b> <b>samples.</b> The study of the bird assemblage, composed of over one thousand specimens, was very inter-esting for {{the wide range of}} species identified, for the frequency of some of them (e. g., the Rock Dove, Columba livia) and for the number and kind of human modifications detected on the bones. The results of the analysis shed some light on the modality and changes in relationship between birds and ancient populations (not considered simply as human ex-ploitation of birds) in the southern Levant, particularly at the beginning of agriculture...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{investigation}} into consumption patterns at the Gallinazo Group archaeological site, from the Early Intermediate Period (200 B. C. to 800 A. D.), on the Peruvian north coast. <b>Faunal</b> <b>samples</b> were recovered from two different but contemporaneous contexts: a civic-ceremonial platform mound and an Architectural Compound in a residential sector. The main objectives were: 1) create a faunal database for the site; 2) assess the nature of faunal resources consumed in these two different contexts; and 3) contribute to the zooarchaeological literature {{on the use of}} consumption patterns to reconstruct aspects of ancient complex societies. For each specimen collected, the species, element, state of fusion, and length were recorded. Differences suggest that the nature of consumption activities varied in both areas of the site. Occupants were exploiting a range of ecological habitats and practiced camelid husbandry, suggesting that increased control and exploitation of their environment was connected to state-emergence...|$|R
40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that Neanderthals exploited birds {{for the use}} of their feathers or claws as personal ornaments in symbolic behaviour is revolutionary as it assigns unprecedented cognitive abilities to these hominins. This inference, however, is based on modest <b>faunal</b> <b>samples</b> and thus may not represent a regular or systematic behaviour. Here we address this issue by looking for evidence of such behaviour across a large temporal and geographical framework. Our analyses try to answer four main questions: 1) does a Neanderthal to raptor-corvid connection exist at a large scale, thus avoiding associations that might be regarded as local in space or time?; 2) did Middle (associated with Neanderthals) and Upper Palaeolithic (associated with modern humans) sites contain a greater range of these species than Late Pleistocene paleontological sites?; 3) is there a taphonomic association between Neanderthals and corvids-raptors at Middle Palaeolithic sites on Gibraltar, specifically Gorham’s, Vanguard and Ibex Caves? and; 4) was the extraction of wing feathers a local phenomenon exclusiv...|$|R

40|$|Investigation {{of human}} {{movement}} {{in the past has}} been a confounding issue in archaeology. Direct measurement of past mobility has recently become feasible, however, through the application of strontium isotope analysis to human skeletal remains. In this study, we examine the question of changes in residence and place of origin among the inhabitants of the landscape of south-central Sweden. We focus specifically on the area known as Falbygden where an extraordinary concentration of megalithic tombs from the Neolithic preserves the skeletal remains of many individuals. Falbygden is also an unusual area in terms of its geology and stands as an island of sedimentary rocks {{in the midst of a}} larger region of igneous and metamorphic formations. This unusual geology is also reflected in the strontium isotope values of Falbygden and its inhabitants. We compare the isotopic ratios in human and <b>faunal</b> <b>samples</b> from Falbygden and the surrounding area and identify non-local individuals. Our study concludes with a discussion of the possible places of origin of non-local individuals and the social mechanisms that may be responsible for their change of residence...|$|R
40|$|Socio-political {{developments}} in the Limpopo Valley are of considerable interest to Iron Age archaeologists and some have suggested a pivotal role for cattle within this context, especially during the Middle Iron Age. In the past, many faunal assemblages from the region were quantified using the Minimum Number of Individuals (MNI) only. In this study, the Cattle Index, which measures the ratio of cattle to sheep/goats in a faunal assemblage, is applied to archaeofauna from the Limpopo Valley, {{as well as to}} other Iron Age samples for which onlyMNIsare available. The resulting Cattle Indices show that wealth was not based on cattle alone in the Limpopo Valley. Most <b>faunal</b> <b>samples</b> from the Early and Middle Iron Ages are dominated by sheep/goats. However, exceptions occur at KwaGandaganda, Mamba, Bosutswe and Nqoma. During the Late Iron Age, most assemblages are dominated by cattle. We consider potential reasons for the identified Early and Middle Iron Age exceptions, and also for variable livestock numbers in general. This research was funded by a grant to S.
