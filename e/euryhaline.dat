5|$|S. iniae {{is highly}} {{pathogenic}} in freshwater, marine, and <b>euryhaline</b> fish, and is highly lethal: outbreaks {{may be associated}} with 30–50% mortality. It is, therefore, one of the foremost economically important pathogens in intensive aquaculture. In 1997, the global economic impact of S.iniae infection to the aquaculture industry was estimated at US$100million (one-tenth of which in the United States). As of 2007, infection had been reported in 27 species of fish, including tilapia (genus Oreochromis and Tilapia), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), Japanese amberjack (Seriola quinqueradiata), red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus), and barramundi (Lates calcarifer, which can be an asymptomatic carrier). Common carp (Cyprinus carpio), channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), and goldfish (Carassius auratus) appear to be resistant. Fish raised in intensive aquaculture operations and subject to environmental stressors (i.e. suboptimal temperature, poor water quality, crowding, handling, etc.) are most prone to S.iniae infection. Wild fish populations located both near and far from aquaculture operations have also proven susceptible to S.iniae infection.|$|E
25|$|The Irrawaddy dolphin (Orcaella brevirostris) is a <b>euryhaline</b> {{species of}} oceanic dolphin found in {{discontinuous}} subpopulations near sea coasts and in estuaries and rivers {{in parts of}} the Bay of Bengal and Southeast Asia.|$|E
25|$|The {{bull shark}} is diadromous, meaning they can swim between salt and fresh water with ease. These fish also are <b>euryhaline</b> fish, {{able to adapt}} {{to a wide range of}} salinities. The bull shark is one of the few {{cartilaginous}} fishes that have been reported in freshwater systems. Many of the <b>euryhaline</b> fish are bony fish such as salmon and tilapia and are not closely related to bull sharks. Evolutionary assumptions can be made to help explain this sort of evolutionary disconnect, one being that the bull shark encountered a population bottleneck that occurred during the last ice age. This bottleneck may have separated the bull shark from the rest of the Elasmobranchii subclass and favored the genes for an osmoregulatory system.|$|E
25|$|The round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) is a <b>euryhaline</b> bottom-dwelling goby of {{the family}} Gobiidae, native to central Eurasia {{including}} the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. Round gobies have established large non-native populations in the Baltic Sea, several major Eurasian rivers, and the North American Great Lakes.|$|E
25|$|This {{species is}} <b>euryhaline,</b> {{establishing}} populations in fresh and brackish water. The optimal salinity is probably near or below 5 ppt, but Potamopyrgus antipodarum {{is capable of}} feeding, growing, and reproducing at salinities of 0–15 ppt and can tolerate 30–35 ppt for short periods of time.|$|E
25|$|Round gobies are <b>euryhaline</b> (salt-tolerant) and {{are found}} in both {{freshwater}} and marine ecosystems. In habits the water with mineralization of 18–24%, presented in fresh waters. Rather common on continental shelves with sandy and rocky bottoms with low silting, on the depth from 1–2 to 10–17 m.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the most}} {{well-known}} species in the river is the Irrawaddy dolphin (Orcaella brevirostris), a <b>euryhaline</b> species of oceanic dolphin with a high and rounded forehead, lacking a beak. It is found in discontinuous sub-populations near sea coasts and in estuaries and rivers {{in parts of the}} Bay of Bengal and South-East Asia.|$|E
25|$|The {{crevalle jack}} lives in both inshore and {{offshore}} habitats, with larger adults preferring deeper waters than juveniles. In the inshore environment, crevalle jack inhabit shallow flats, sandy bays, beaches, seagrass beds, shallow reef complexes and lagoons. The species {{is also known}} to enter brackish waters, with some individuals known to penetrate far upstream; however, like most <b>euryhaline</b> species, they generally do not penetrate very far upriver.|$|E
25|$|Fishes that {{spend time}} in {{estuaries}} (or river mouths) need to be <b>euryhaline</b> (tolerant {{to a range of}} salinities). Estuaries provide an unstable environment for fish, where the salinity changes and the waters are often muddy and turbulent. In warmer climates, estuaries have mangroves around their edges. At times there may be only a few different fish species present in an estuary, but seasonal migrants, including eels, salmonids, and some forage fish such as herrings and sprats increase the diversity in the estuary.|$|E
25|$|The {{level of}} {{salinity}} {{can also be}} quite variable. Low salinities {{can be caused by}} rainwater or river inputs of freshwater. Estuarine species must be especially <b>euryhaline,</b> or able to tolerate a wide range of salinities. High salinities occur in locations with high evaporation rates, such as in salt marshes and high intertidal pools. Shading by plants, especially in the salt marsh, can slow evaporation and thus ameliorate salinity stress. In addition, salt marsh plants tolerate high salinities by several physiological mechanisms, including excreting salt through salt glands and preventing salt uptake into the roots.|$|E
500|$|Populations of {{alligator}} gar {{have been}} extirpated from {{much of their}} historic range {{as a result of}} habitat destruction, indiscriminate culling, and unrestricted harvests. [...] Populations are now located primarily in the southern portions of the United States extending into Mexico. They are considered <b>euryhaline</b> because they can adapt to varying salinities ranging from freshwater lakes and swamps to brackish marshes, estuaries, and bays along the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
500|$|C.maenas {{can live}} in all types of {{protected}} and semi-protected marine and estuarine habitats, including habitats with mud, sand, or rock substrates, submerged aquatic vegetation, and emergent marsh, although soft bottoms are preferred. C.maenas is <b>euryhaline,</b> meaning that it can tolerate {{a wide range of}} salinities (from 4 to 52‰), and survive in temperatures of [...] The wide salinity range allows C.maenas to survive in the lower salinities found in estuaries, and the wide temperature range allows it to survive in extremely cold climates beneath the ice in Winter. A molecular biological study using the COI gene found genetic differentiation between the North Sea and the Bay of Biscay, and even more strongly between the populations in Iceland and the Faroe Islands and those elsewhere. This suggests that C.maenas is unable to cross deeper water.|$|E
500|$|Alligator gar (Atractosteus spatula) are ray-finned <b>euryhaline</b> fish {{related to}} bowfin in the infraclass Holostei (ho'-las-te-i). The fossil record traces their {{existence}} to the Early Cretaceous {{over a hundred}} million years ago. [...] They are the largest species in the gar family, and among the largest freshwater fishes in North America. [...] Gars are {{often referred to as}} [...] "primitive fishes", or [...] "living fossils" [...] because they have retained some morphological characteristics of their earliest ancestors, such as a spiral valve intestine which is also common to the digestive system of sharks, and the ability to breathe both air and water. [...] Their common name was derived from their resemblance to American alligator, particularly their broad snout and long sharp teeth. [...] Anecdotal evidence in several scientific reports suggest that an alligator gar can grow up to [...] in length and weigh as much as however in 2011 the largest alligator gar ever caught and officially recorded was [...] long, weighed , and was [...] around the girth.|$|E
2500|$|Cichlids {{are less}} {{commonly}} found in brackish and saltwater habitats, though many species tolerate brackish water for extended periods; Cichlasoma urophthalmus, for example, is equally at home in freshwater marshes and mangrove swamps, and lives and breeds in saltwater environments such as the mangrove belts around barrier islands. Several species of Tilapia, Sarotherodon, and Oreochromis are <b>euryhaline</b> and can disperse along brackish coastlines between rivers. Only a few cichlids, however, inhabit primarily brackish or salt water, most notably Etroplus maculatus, Etroplus suratensis, and Sarotherodon melanotheron. The perhaps most extreme habitats for cichlids are the warm hypersaline lakes where {{the members of the}} genera Alcolapia and Danakilia are found. Lake Abaeded in Eritrea encompasses the entire distribution of D. dinicolai, and its temperature ranges from [...]|$|E
2500|$|The {{water quality}} of the lake varies widely during various seasons [...] summer, premonsoon, monsoon and postmonsoon [...] as the depth and width of the lake mouth varies causing a dynamic {{situation}} of mixing and circulation of waters. The resultant salinity variation and DO (dissolved oxygen) affects the primary production, plankton, biodiversity and fisheries in this lake. Salinity values vary from zero during the monsoon to about 52,000 ppm (hyper saline) during post and premonsoon seasons. Adjustment to this wide variation is difficult for sessile and sedentary species in the lake. However, <b>euryhaline</b> species still dwell in the lake. The benthic or the bottom habitat of this lagoon is classified into three zones. The southern zone, the first zone, is dominated by sand with some admixture of mud. The second zone at the northern region is wholly muddy. The third zone with sand and mud in equal parts is overgrown with patches of weeds and {{is reported to be}} rich in benthic biodiversity. Toxicity levels of heavy metals such as magnesium, lead, zinc, nickel, cadmium, aluminum and copper and chemicals such as ammonia, sulphate and fluoride in the lake are well within permissible limits.|$|E
50|$|<b>Euryhaline</b> {{organisms are}} able {{to adapt to a}} wide range of salinities. An example of a <b>euryhaline</b> fish is the molly (Poecilia sphenops) which can live in fresh water, {{brackish}} water, or salt water. The green crab (Carcinus maenas) is an example of a <b>euryhaline</b> invertebrate that can live in salt and brackish water. <b>Euryhaline</b> organisms are commonly found in habitats such as estuaries and tide pools where the salinity changes regularly. However, some organisms are <b>euryhaline</b> because their life cycle involves migration between freshwater and marine environments, as is the case with salmon and eels.|$|E

50|$|Chlorella lewinii is a <b>euryhaline,</b> {{unicellular}} microalgae. It is spherical to oval-shaped, is solitary and lacks a mucilaginous envelope.|$|E
50|$|They {{have a wide}} distribution, {{centered}} on Eurasia, and are <b>euryhaline</b> as a lineage, inhabiting fresh to marine waters.|$|E
50|$|Because it is a <b>euryhaline</b> fish, {{living in}} marine, brackish, and {{freshwater}} habitats, {{it can be}} farmed {{in a wide range}} of salinities.|$|E

50|$|A. modesta is a <b>euryhaline</b> species, able to {{tolerate}} {{a wide range}} of salinities. It is nearly always associated with the yellow-green alga Vaucheria litorea on which it feeds in saltmarshes.|$|E
50|$|These frogs are {{remarkable}} for being extremely <b>euryhaline</b> by amphibian standards. Species {{such as the}} crab-eating frog (F. cancrivora) can thrive in brackish water, and its tadpoles can even survive in pure seawater.|$|E
50|$|The Irrawaddy dolphin (Orcaella brevirostris) is a <b>euryhaline</b> {{species of}} oceanic dolphin found in {{discontinuous}} subpopulations near sea coasts and in estuaries and rivers {{in parts of}} the Bay of Bengal and Southeast Asia.|$|E
50|$|The River Thames {{flowing through}} London {{is a classic}} river estuary. The town of Teddington a few miles west of London marks the {{boundary}} between the tidal and non-tidal parts of the Thames, although it is still considered a freshwater river about as far east as Battersea insofar as the average salinity is very low and the fish fauna consists predominantly of freshwater species such as roach, dace, carp, perch, and pike. The Thames Estuary becomes brackish between Battersea and Gravesend, and the diversity of freshwater fish species present is smaller, primarily roach and dace; <b>euryhaline</b> marine species such as flounder, European seabass, mullet, and smelt become much more common. Further east, the salinity increases and the freshwater fish species are completely replaced by <b>euryhaline</b> marine ones, until the river reaches Gravesend, at which point conditions become fully marine and the fish fauna resembles that of the adjacent North Sea and includes both <b>euryhaline</b> and stenohaline marine species. A similar pattern of replacement can be observed with the aquatic plants and invertebrates living in the river.|$|E
50|$|The river {{swimming}} crab, Varuna litterata, is a <b>euryhaline</b> {{species of}} crab. Known from India, East Africa, Australia and Japan. This species {{was recorded in}} a fresh water stream in Coffs Harbour in eastern Australia.|$|E
50|$|Alternatively, fish {{living in}} coastal {{estuaries}} and tide pools are often <b>euryhaline</b> (tolerant {{to changes in}} salinity) as are many species which have life cycle requiring tolerance to both fresh water and seawater environments such as salmon and herring.|$|E
50|$|On {{the basis}} of their habitat, algae can be {{categorized}} as: aquatic (planktonic, benthic, marine, freshwater, lentic, lotic), terrestrial, aerial (subareial), lithophytic, halophytic (or <b>euryhaline),</b> psammon, thermophilic, cryophilic, epibiont (epiphytic, epizoic), endosymbiont (endophytic, endozoic), parasitic, calcifilic or lichenic (phycobiont).|$|E
50|$|The {{opposite}} of <b>euryhaline</b> organisms are stenohaline ones, {{which can only}} survive within a narrow range of salinities. Most freshwater organisms are stenohaline, and will die in seawater, and similarly most marine organisms are stenohaline, and cannot live in fresh water.|$|E
5000|$|When {{found in}} warm waters these {{jellyfish}} flourish. They are mostly <b>euryhaline</b> but low salinities {{may have a}} negative effect on the species. In times of low salinity these jellyfish exhibit loss of their zooxanthellae. Their dispersal patterns are locally patchy.|$|E
50|$|The River Thames {{flowing through}} London {{is a classic}} river estuary, with {{sedimentary}} deposition restricted through manmade embankments.
