5|$|After a large fire at Miss Knox's School (site of the Briarcliff Corporate Campus) in 1912, the department's {{equipment}} was upgraded {{to deal with}} larger fires. The village purchased its first motorized vehicle, an American LaFrance pumper truck. The existing hose-and-chemical wagon was motorized and became the chief's car. In 1914, the Briarcliff Manor Municipal Building was constructed to house the government and fire engines. The likeness of its garage doors {{can be seen in}} the façade of the present restaurant. Later in 1914 the department established sub-stations at Mrs. Whitson's barn on Pleasantville Road and on the Holden farm at Scarborough Road (roughly opposite the current firehouse); these were discontinued in 1921. The first major fire to involve the motorized vehicles was in 1916 at the central business district. In spite of the new equipment, several buildings at the northern end were destroyed. The 1908 hook-and-ladder truck was motorized in 1923 and two years later, the chief's car was replaced by another American LaFrance vehicle. An <b>electric</b> <b>siren</b> was installed in 1928 after a complaint that the previous alarm sounded more like a call to breakfast than an alarm of fire.|$|E
25|$|Forest Grove {{started a}} {{volunteer}} fire department on February 4, 1894, with {{combination of two}} fire companies. The department was created after bucket brigades were determined to be inefficient, and the two fire companies {{spent too much time}} fighting each other. One of the first chiefs was J. G. Lenneville, who was first elected to the post in 1901, and served through at least 1923. In December 1907, the city purchased a hose wagon for $100. The city replaced the fire bell that had been housed at a church and at the Old College Hall at Pacific University with an <b>electric</b> <b>siren</b> in October 1925. A 1907 steamer used by the Portland Fire Bureau was bought by Forest Grove in 1933 for $150, and is still owned by the fire department.|$|E

50|$|The fire department's space {{included}} an equipment room with three garage doors, and a club room with lockers, showers, and recreational furnishings. The department received its first motorized fire engine shortly {{after completion of}} the hall. Its staff also performed the maintenance activities for the building and used the basement as a gymnasium. In 1920 an alarm bell {{at the top of}} the hose tower was replaced with an <b>electric</b> <b>siren</b> and the garage doors were modified because they were too short to accommodate some new firefighting equipment.|$|E

The island itself is interspersed with several buildings and military towers. The highest point of the island is where the light house is located.

The white light is shown by a grey tower flashes white that lasts for 0.5 seconds and eclipses’ for 4.5 seconds and forming with the Fort Point light House a range for crossing the bar for the main ship.

[...] "Back in Time" [...] is a dance-pop song which talks about regret and wanting to revisit the past to fix mistakes, it has been rumored that Scott-Lee wrote the song as a reaction to how Steps broke up as she wrote it before the release of her cancelled album Unleashed.|$|R

[...] In 1902 the fire alarm was placed in a wooden structure at the corner of Brown and Main which fell over entirely in the 1906 earthquake (see below) which led to the bell being hung at the firehouse, and a steam-whistle at the Creamery used for the fire alarm from 1906 until <b>electric</b> <b>sirens</b> came into use in 1931.|$|R

In 1936, the village tradition of the testing of the fire alarm at noon began; it was sounded on each day except Sunday. In the same year, due to a dispute over fire chief elections, the Briarcliff Manor Hook and Ladder Company was formed, separate from the Engine Company. During the 1930s, the department had organized a basketball team which played other departments and the Scarborough company formed a rivalry with the Briarcliff ones.

50|$|The main {{difference}} from most other computing devices is that PLCs are intended-for and therefore tolerant-of more severe conditions (such as dust, moisture, heat, cold), while offering extensive input/output (I/O) {{to connect the}} PLC to sensors and actuators.

PLC output can include elements such as indicator lamps, <b>sirens,</b> <b>electric</b> motors, pneumatic or hydraulic cylinders, magnetic relays, solenoids, or analog outputs. The input/output arrangements may be built into a simple PLC, or the PLC may have external I/O modules attached to a computer network that plugs into the PLC.|$|R

Beginning in the late 50's, the electronic siren began to replace the mechanical siren. It provided several tones (wail and yelp) and a PA option.
