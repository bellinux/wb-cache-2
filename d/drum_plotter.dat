40|$|The WOLF Contouring and Plotting Package {{provides}} the user {{with a complete}} general purpose plotting and contouring capability. This package is a complete system for producing line printer, SC 4020, Gerber, Calcomp, and SD 4060 plots. The package {{has been designed to}} be highly flexible and easy to use. Any plot from a quick simple plot (which requires only one call to the package) to highly sophisticated plots (including motion picture plots) can be easily generated with only a basic knowledge of FORTRAN and the plot commands. Anyone designing a software system that requires plotted output will find that this package offers many advantages over the standard hardware support packages available. The WCPP package is divided into a plot segment and a contour segment. The plot segment can produce output for any combination of line printer, SC 4020, Gerber, Calcomp, and SD 4060 plots. The line printer plots allow the user to have plots available immediately after a job is run at a low cost. Although the resolution of line printer plots is low, the quick results allows the user to judge if a high resolution plot of a particular run is desirable. The SC 4020 and SD 4060 provide high speed high resolution cathode ray plots with film and hard copy output available. The Gerber and Calcomp plotters provide very high quality (of publishable quality) plots of good resolution. Being bed or <b>drum</b> type <b>plotters,</b> the Gerber and Calcomp plotters are usually slow and not suited for large volume plotting. All output for any or all of the plotters can be produced simultaneously. The types of plots supported are: linear, semi-log, log-log, polar, tabular data using the FORTRAN WRITE statement, 3 -D perspective linear, and affine transformations. The labeling facility provides for horizontal labels, vertical labels, diagonal labels, vector characters of a requested size (special character fonts are easily implemented), and rotated letters. The gridding routines label the grid lines according to user specification. Special line features include multiple lines, dashed lines, and tic marks. The contour segment of this package is a collection of subroutines which can be used to produce contour plots and perform related functions. The package can contour any data which can be placed on a grid or data which is regularly spaced, including any general affine or polar grid data. The package includes routines which will grid random data. Contour levels can be specified at any values desired. Input data can be smoothed with undefined points being acceptable where data is unreliable or unknown. Plots which are extremely large or detailed can be automatically output in parts to improve resolution or overcome plotter size limitations. The contouring segment uses the plot segment for actual plotting, thus all the features described for the plotting segment are available to the user of the contouring segment. Included with this package are two data bases for producing world map plots in Mercator projection. One data base provides just continent outlines and another provides continent outlines and national borders in great detail. This package is written in FORTRAN IV and IBM OS ASSEMBLER and has been implemented on an IBM 360 with a central memory requirement of approximately 140 K of 8 bit bytes. The ASSEMBLER routines are basic plotter interface routines. The WCPP package was developed in 1972...|$|R

5000|$|The Calcomp 565 <b>drum</b> <b>plotter,</b> {{introduced}} in 1959, {{was one of}} the first computer graphics output devices sold. The computer could control in 0.01 inch increments the rotation of an 11 inch (280 mm) wide drum and the horizontal movement of a pen holder over the drum. The pen was pressed by a spring against paper scrolling across the drum. A solenoid could lift the pen off the paper. This arrangement allowed line drawings to be made under computer control. Years later Calcomp made model 563 which used a 30" [...] wide drum.|$|E
40|$|A FORTRAN {{program has}} been {{developed}} to fit smooth surfaces 13; to the component parts of an arbitrary aircraft configuration or any three-dimensional geometry. The basic surface element used for this fit is a bi-cubic surface patch. Once the geometry {{has been replaced by}} a set of patch equations, various kinds of calculations which require a three-dimensional mathematical description of the surface can be performed easily. The second part of the code generates orthographic views of the given geometry on a calcomp <b>drum</b> <b>plotter</b> or on a Tektronix screen. 13...|$|E

The system stores, processes and displays data useful to the land manager in the decision making process. Emphasis {{is placed on the}} use of remote sensing as a data source. Data input consists of maps, imagery overlays, and on-site data. Maps and overlays are entered using a digitizer and stored as irregular polygons, lines and points. Processing functions include set intersection, union and difference and area, length and value computations. Data output consists of computer tabulations and overlays prepared on a <b>drum</b> <b>plotter...</b>|$|E

IGFES provides an interactive design tool for structural engineers via pre- and postprocessing of finite element data. The system currently runs on an IBM 360 / 44 OS-MFT system or a PDP 11 / 40 DOS/BATCH system. Graphics devices are supported using an inhouse developed, device independent terminal support package.

40|$|Machine {{processing}} of remotely sensed data in Sweden is at present {{limited to one}} research group. Current activities encompass development of maximum likelihood classification procedures on a general purpose IBM 360 / 75 and later also on a special purpose PDP 11 / 40 with Ramtek GX 100 B Graphical display unit for interactive processing. Our Algorithm is adapted from the interesting modification of this method used by Robert H. Dye of the Bendix Corporation. In a sense this technique amounts to a 2 ̆ 2 dynamic 2 ̆ 2 determination of the optimum information yielding combination of a few wave length bands from {{a larger number of}} available spectral bands. Testing and evaluation of the analysis programs is done in an application to land vegetation mapping and the particular problem wed for these purposes is the identification of clear cut areas in forested regions. One of the output units in our special purpose image processing system is a novel Swedish color ink jet plotter, capable of generation hardcopy imagery in three colors about 10 - 16 gray levels each on plain paper or transparencies. It is a <b>drum</b> <b>plotter</b> with a registration capacity of 3 ⨯ 1024 ⨯ 1536 points in about 120 seconds on an area of about 20 CM ⨯ 28 CM. This project as well as other major remote sensing projects is sponsored in part by the remote sensing committee of the Swedish board of space activities. The research is mainly concentrated to three problem areas of particular interest VIZ land vegetation, sea ice, and oil pollution...|$|E
40|$|Computer-aided {{design is}} the generic {{term for a}} rapidly proliferating set of {{techniques}} which have become mandatory for all who wish to maintain their competitive positions in {{an increasing number of}} industries. CAD practitioners in advanced technology industries such as aerospace and electronics are usually highly sophisticated in computer usage and therefore able to configure their own CAD environments to suit their requirements. Those, however, who are relatively new to computers, are faced with a bewildering set of choices over which they have to make decisions. Should they have a cheap terminal linked to a remote time-sharing bureau? Should they attempt to do their whole design job on a dedicated, medium-sized in-house computer? Or should they invest in a high capability, intelligent terminal backed up by access to a central (or network-distributed) number-crunching and data-bank facility? What graphic facilities should they use? A <b>drum</b> <b>plotter,</b> a storage-tube display, interactive refresh graphics unit, hardware rotation, conic generation, zooming, are all choices that are presented to them and the manufacturers' praise of their own line is often more confusing than helpful. The International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, IIASA, has recently embarked on a World Survey of CAD, one of whose aims has been to provide guidance to would-be users on the establishment of CAD facilities suited to their needs. In this work IIASA has relied heavily on the analysis of the activity phases in CAD, currently being conducted by W. G. 5. 2 (Computer-Aided Design) of IFIP (The International Federation for Information Processing) ...|$|E
