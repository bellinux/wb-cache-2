For <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> <b>propagation</b> near the commonest type of singularity, the point singularity, the relationship between the phase and group-velocities may undergo rapid variations for small changes in direction. This results in shear-waves along rays (propagating at the group-velocity) behaving anomalously, with irregular polarizations and ampli-tude changes as if they were propagating near cusps, although the degree of anisotropy may be too small to cause conventional cusps on the group-velocity wave surfaces.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{deals with}} the <b>propagation</b> <b>of</b> surface waves of an {{assigned}} wavelength on a thermoviscoelastic half-space. It is shown that a unique surface wave of an assigned wavelength, which satisfies the adopted criteria for behaviour at infinity, always exists. This wave is interpreted as a superposition of three dispersive inhomogeneous plane waves. The superposed waves have different <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> <b>propagation</b> and different phase velocities. Their <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> <b>propagation</b> are not parallel to the stress-free surface. The plane of constant amplitude that corresponds {{to each of these}} superposed waves is parallel to the stress-free surface and moves to it with a constant velocity, which is different for each of the superposed waves.

In this paper, estimating the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> wavefront <b>propagation</b> and the slowness for seismic signals which pass through the small-size dense seismic array is described in detail. The earthquake recorder sample adopted from US Geological Survey Parkfield Dense Seismograph Array (UPSAR array) of the U. S is used for analyzing. The results indicate that, the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> wavefront <b>propagation</b> cannot be determined rashly only by the connecting line of the earthquake epicenter to the seismic array.

25|$|In physics, the Faraday effect or Faraday {{rotation}} is a magneto-optical phenomenon—that is, {{an interaction}} between light and a magnetic field in a medium. The Faraday effect causes a rotation of the plane of polarization which is linearly proportional to the component of the magnetic field in the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>propagation.</b> Formally, it is a special case of gyroelectromagnetism obtained when the dielectric permittivity tensor is diagonal.|$|E

25|$|Sound is {{transmitted}} through gases, plasma, and liquids as longitudinal waves, also called compression waves. It requires a medium to propagate. Through solids, however, {{it can be}} transmitted as both longitudinal waves and transverse waves. Longitudinal sound waves are waves of alternating pressure deviations from the equilibrium pressure, causing local regions of compression and rarefaction, while transverse waves (in solids) are waves of alternating shear stress at right angle to the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>propagation.</b>|$|E
25|$|The new indices s = 1, 2, 3 {{label the}} {{polarization}} of the phonons. In the one-dimensional model, the atoms were restricted to moving along the line, so the phonons corresponded to longitudinal waves. In three dimensions, vibration is {{not restricted to}} the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>propagation,</b> and can also occur in the perpendicular planes, like transverse waves.

25|$|In all {{electromagnetic}} radiation, {{the electric}} field is {{perpendicular to the}} <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>propagation,</b> and the electric field direction is the polarization of the wave. For a transmitted radar signal, the polarization can be controlled to yield different effects. Radars use horizontal, vertical, linear, and circular polarization to detect different types of reflections. For example, circular polarization is used to minimize the interference caused by rain. Linear polarization returns usually indicate metal surfaces. Random polarization returns usually indicate a fractal surface, such as rocks or soil, and are used by navigation radars.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe use of seismic {{anisotropy}} {{to image}} upper mantle flow is usually {{based on the}} assumption that the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> fast <b>propagation</b> <b>of</b> seismic waves is the same as the flow direction. Laboratory experiments showed that when melt is present, it is rather the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> slow <b>propagation</b> that aligns with the flow direction. This paper presents a modeling of the effect of melt on the development of lattice preferred orientation (LPO) and its implications for the interpretation of anisotropy. Taking into account strain partitioning associated with melt segregation in the modeling yields a good agreement with experimental results. Implementing strain partitioning in a test flow shows that the effect of melt is mainly local and has a limited effect on seismic anisotropy. Water-induced texture, melt-filled cracks or channelized flow, might better account for seismic observations <b>of</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> fast <b>propagation</b> normal to plate motion on a regional scale...|$|R
25|$|It is {{well known}} that {{electromagnetic}} radiation carries a certain linear momentum in the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>propagation.</b> In addition, however, light carries a certain angular momentum if it is circularly polarized (or partially so). In comparison with lower frequencies such as microwaves, the amount of angular momentum in light, even of pure circular polarization, compared to the same wave's linear momentum (or radiation pressure) is very small and difficult to even measure. However it was utilized in an experiment to achieve speeds of up to 600 million revolutions per minute.|$|E
25|$|For {{longitudinal}} waves such as {{sound waves}} in fluids, {{the direction of}} oscillation is by definition along the direction of travel, so the issue of polarization is not normally even mentioned. On the other hand, sound waves in a bulk solid can be transverse as well as longitudinal, {{for a total of}} three polarization components. In this case, the transverse polarization is associated with the direction of the shear stress and displacement in directions perpendicular to the propagation direction, while the longitudinal polarization describes compression of the solid and vibration along the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>propagation.</b> The differential propagation of transverse and longitudinal polarizations is important in seismology.|$|E

The electric polarization, in the θ direction, is coplanar with the source current (in the Z direction), while the magnetic field is at right angles to that, in the φ direction. It can be seen from these equations, and also in the animation, that the fields at these distances are exactly in phase. Both fields fall according to 1/r, with the power thus falling according to 1/r2 as dictated by the inverse square law.|$|E

30|$|Phenomena of {{reflection}} and refraction of plane harmonic waves at a plane interface between an elastic solid and double-porosity dual-permeability material are investigated. The elastic solid behaves non-dissipatively, while double-porosity dual-permeability materials behave dissipatively to wave propagation {{due to the}} presence of viscosity in pore fluids. All the waves (i.e., incident and reflected) in an elastic medium are considered as homogeneous (i.e., having the same <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> <b>propagation</b> and attenuation), while all the refracted waves in double-porosity dual-permeability materials are inhomogeneous (i.e., having different <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> <b>propagation</b> and attenuation). The coefficients {{of reflection}} and refraction for a given incident wave are obtained as a non-singular system of linear equations. The energy shares of reflected and refracted waves are obtained {{in the form of an}} energy matrix. A numerical example is considered to calculate the partition of incident energy among various reflected and refracted waves. The effect <b>of</b> incident <b>direction</b> on the partition of the incident energy is analyzed with a change in wave frequency, wave-induced fluid-flow, pore-fluid viscosity and double-porosity structure.
