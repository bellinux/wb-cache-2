30|$|The <b>fire</b> <b>atlas</b> {{reflects}} modern {{patterns that}} may differ considerably from historical patterns, especially for dry forests. Tree-ring reconstructions of surface fire at 14 dry forest {{sites in the}} <b>fire</b> <b>atlas</b> recording area averaged 8 fires per century from 1650 to 1900 (range 4 to 14 fires; Heyerdahl et al. 2008). The <b>fire</b> <b>atlas</b> record from the same locations and area sampled had a record of many fewer fires after 1900 (range 0 to 2 fires from 1900 through 2008; Heyerdahl et al. 2008). While these tree-ring data are from sites targeted for frequent fires, the contrast with the <b>fire</b> <b>atlas</b> data suggests that departures from historical fire regimes occurred before 1900 in dry forests and continue to the present.|$|E

30|$|The {{few places}} in the western U.S. that have intact forests, minimal or no {{domestic}} livestock grazing over the last century, and have allowed multiple, naturally-occurring fires to burn relatively unimpeded are remote wilderness areas (Rollins et al. 2001, Collins and Stephens 2007). Illilouette Creek basin in Yosemite National Park and Sugarloaf Creek basin in Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks are two such places. These basins provide a relatively unique opportunity to compare tree-scarring patterns to over 30 years of mapped wildland fire use (WFU) fires, spanning from 1973 to 2005. These fires were mapped by aerial surveys, global positioning system (GPS), or satellite imagery. We obtained the mapped fire perimeters and digital <b>fire</b> <b>atlases</b> (Morgan et al. 2001, Rollins et al. 2001) from fire management personnel in each park. In addition to the <b>fire</b> <b>atlases,</b> we used independently derived remotely sensed estimates of burn severity (Miller and Thode 2007) to verify {{the accuracy of the}} digital <b>fire</b> <b>atlases</b> and characterize severity of WFU fires around collected fire scars (burn severity images were only available for WFU fires that occurred within the Illilouette Creek basin). To our knowledge there has been very little previous work that examines how tree-scarring patterns coincide with both digital <b>fire</b> <b>atlases</b> and burn severity imagery (but see Shapiro-Miller et al. in press). Here we present an analysis that aims to explain observed patterns of tree scarring along with comparisons between fire-scar reconstructed fire extent and fire rotation to that based on digital <b>fire</b> <b>atlases.</b> We intend for these results to advance the discussion on the uncertainties associated with fire-scar reconstructions of historical fire occurrence.|$|R

30|$|Perimeters in <b>fire</b> <b>atlas</b> data simplify reality. Unfortunately, {{unburned}} islands within fire perimeters are not mapped (Kolden and Weisberg 2007), and atlases {{like the}} one from the northern Rockies contain fire perimeters, but not burn severity. Because atlas perimeters do not discern unburned islands, they likely overestimate the area burned by any single fire, although {{the degree to which}} this is true is generally unknown (Kolden et al. 2012). The perimeters are approximate and ground truthing is necessary before relying on them for many applications. Accuracy of most perimeters is unknown and likely varies through time and among management units. For example, Shapiro-Miller et al. (2007) found that the fire perimeters in the northern Rockies <b>fire</b> <b>atlas</b> agreed with fire scar records, and Farris et al. (2010) similarly found that <b>fire</b> <b>atlas</b> and fire scar records were in strong agreement. Yet Kolden and Weisberg (2007) found poor agreement between manually mapped fire perimeters (created through a number of different undocumented methods) and Landsat-derived perimeters, especially in areas of complex topography. <b>Fire</b> <b>atlas</b> data should be regarded with healthy skepticism and supplemented with other sources of information whenever possible.|$|E

Satellite imagery became available in 1974, soon after the prescribed burning program began in 1970 and the wildland fire use program in 1972.

30|$|Notably, fires {{less than}} 405 ha are not {{included}} in the MTBS dataset, which has the potential to censor re-burn and fire size distributions. To address this concern, the MTBS analysis was supplemented with data from a regional <b>fire</b> <b>atlas</b> compiled by Gibson (2005), which was further updated with fire perimeters through 2007 obtained by data-mining regional fire records. This atlas includes fires of all sizes, and was used to examine whether small fires interacted with large fires (and vice versa). Because the perimeters of small fires are not derived systematically and are known to contain errors (Morgan et al. 2001, Lentile et al. 2006), the <b>fire</b> <b>atlas</b> was used only to examine the spatial coincidence of small fires with larger ones, in order to assess the likelihood that small fires have influenced the sizes and shapes of other fires.

30|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} {{a method for}} generating an SMFI using a GIS and fire scar data collected in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa C. Lawson) forests in Washington state, USA, on eastern slopes of the Cascades and in the Selkirk Range. These sites have been previously investigated {{in the context of}} fire history, climate-fire relationships, and topography-fire relationships (Everett et al. 2000, Hessl et al. 2004, McKenzie et al. 2006, Kellog et al. 2008), and Hessl et al. (2007) discussed a GIS approach for estimating fire perimeters using these data. This paper extends the application of GIS to fire scar data using a spatial approach similar to methods described by Baker and Kipfmueller (2001), Moritz (2003), and Wittkuhn and Hamilton (2010). However, Baker and Kipfmueller (2001) used stand-age data and orthophotos to define fire perimeters, and defined fire boundaries based on image properties. Wittkuhn and Hamilton (2010) also describe “digitizing fires” and using existing GIS datasets of fire perimeters. This method is best suited to areas with high-severity, stand-replacing fire regimes. Moritz (2003) used mapped perimeters of modern fires and focused his inquiry on the recent fire regime in a chaparral ecosystem. The method presented in this paper is based on spatially interpolated fire scar point data, and is novel in that it reconstructs spatially continuous two-dimensional estimates of fire frequency. This extends Baker and Kipfmueller’s (2001) and Moritz’s (2003) approaches to regions with frequent low-severity fires. This is significant in that estimating fire extent in low-severity fire regimes has been problematic (Morgan et al. 2001, Rollins et al. 2001, Jordan et al. 2005, Shapiro-Miller et al. 2007). Furthermore, the GIS approach provides data that can supplement statistical methods (MPFI, CMFI) that represent discrete point locations, may be influenced by false negatives, or are scale sensitive, and <b>fire</b> <b>atlas</b> data that may be temporally limited. Collins and Stephens (2007) compared fire scar reconstructions with <b>fire</b> <b>atlas</b> data in the Sierra Nevada, California, USA, and described a tendency for fire scar data to produce longer fire rotations than <b>fire</b> <b>atlas</b> data. However, Fulé et al. (2003) found a strong correspondence between fire scar records and fire atlases, and Shapiro-Miller et al. (2007) found that fire perimeters generated from fire scars were statistically similar to <b>fire</b> <b>atlas</b> records, and that reconstructed perimeters compensated for lapses in <b>fire</b> <b>atlas</b> record-keeping. Farris et al. (2010) suggested that spatial reconstructions based on fire scars may be more useful than previously discussed. After describing the GIS approach, the remainder of this paper focuses on discussing how SMFI differs from statistical methods in the context of sampling design, data characteristics, and the landscape. We conclude by discussing how the SMFI may provide a tool to support management decision-making, much as fire atlases are used to provide spatial data about the more recent past.|$|E
40|$|I used {{archives}} of wildfire perimeters (<b>fire</b> <b>atlases)</b> within a {{geographic information system}} (GIS) to describe and evaluate fire frequency patterns for the 20 th century in the 486, 673 -ha Gila/Aldo Leopold Wilderness Complex (GALWC), New Mexico and the 785, 090 -ha Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness Complex (SBWC) in Idaho and Montana. I addressed questions about changing 20 th century fire frequencies and landscape-scale controls of fire frequency by analyzing <b>fire</b> <b>atlases</b> along with data for topography, vegetation, and climate. Similarities and differences in comparisons between study areas highlight important aspects of fire regimes and strengthen my interpretation and inference. In the GALWC, fire rotations were shortest during the recent wildfire use period (1975 - 1993) and longest during the pre-modern suppression period (1909 - 1946). In the SBWC, fire rotations were shortest during the pre-modern suppression period (1880 - 1934) and longest during the modern suppression period (1935 - 1975). Elevations with the highest fire frequencies differed between study areas. However, forest types found at these elevations are characterized by similar overstory tree species. Steeper northeastern slopes in the GALWC and southwestern slopes in the SBWC burned most frequently. I assert that, in the GALWC, horizontal fuel continuity is a main factor determining fire frequency. In the SBWC, fuel moisture status limits fire frequency. Fires are most frequent in areas where ignitions occur and neither fuel continuity nor fuel moisture are likely to limit fire spread. Three statistical modeling approaches were used to produce maps of reburn probabilities. Log-likelihood modeling provided the most satisfactory results, while logistic regression and classification and regression trees yielded statistically insignificant models. Empirical models contributed to the assertion that fuel continuity limits fire frequency in the GALWC while fuel moisture limits fire frequency in the SBWC. Mapped fire perimeters provide a valuable source of spatial historical information for describing the role of large fires over broad areas. This dissertation enhances scientific knowledge about broad scale changes in fire regimes. Comparisons between areas facilitate identification of unique versus general patterns. Results provide a contemporary baseline for comparison with estimates of Pre-EuroAmerican fire frequencies, and a historical, spatial context for modeling and managing future fire regimes...|$|R
30|$|The SMFI maps {{can provide}} {{managers}} with additional spatial {{information to help}} characterize fire regimes and to visualize fire variability {{in the context of}} the physical landscape. This visualization can provide insights on the relationship between fire and topography, provide direction for further investigation, guide additional sampling efforts, and ultimately inform management. Traditionally, managers have had access to statistical results such as fire intervals, statistical topographic indexes that evaluate fire relative to terrain (Kellogg et al. 2008), or, in the case of historical fires, spatial tools such as <b>fire</b> <b>atlases</b> and remotely sensed imagery. Although these resources are critical to support decision-making on issues such as allocating and dispatching suppression resources, planning thinning and burning operations, and public safety and awareness, spatially explicit data for pre-Euro-American fire regimes has been less accessible in dry ponderosa pine forests characterized by low-severity fire regimes. In this paper, we have demonstrated how GIS-based estimates of fire perimeters and the SMFI approach can supplement existing data sources and have practical management implications in supporting spatial decision-making.|$|R
30|$|Despite these weaknesses, atlas {{data can}} be very useful. These “wall-to-wall” georeferenced {{landscape}} fire histories complement remote sensing, and tree-ring and other fire proxies. While <b>fire</b> <b>atlases</b> typically do not include all small fires, they do capture the larger fires that account {{for the majority of}} fire extent (Shapiro-Miller et al. 2007, Farris et al. 2010) and provide one of the only sources of information about temporal change in fire polygon size distribution prior to the advent of remote sensing from satellite imagery and aerial photography. They are georeferenced, and so can be linked to other georeferenced data such as topography, vegetation type, climate, and weather. For instance, they are useful in evaluating where and why fire regimes change across time and space (Morgan et al. 2001, Rollins et al. 2002). They are also useful for elucidating the causes of temporal and spatial variation in twentieth century fire regimes (e.g., Morgan et al. 2008). They {{can also be used to}} identify sites for studying forest dynamics for conservation and restoration. In many regions, digital polygon fire histories are the only record of the location and extent of fires throughout the twentieth century, a time period that encompasses different fire management practices, multiple forest vegetation types, and multiple land uses, all of which influence fire regimes.|$|R

30|$|We {{stratified}} {{our data}} according to fire frequency derived from <b>fire</b> <b>atlas</b> data; however, {{the accuracy of}} fire atlases are imperfect, especially in areas characterized by low-severity fires, because {{it is difficult to}} map fire perimeters when few of the larger trees are killed (Morgan et al. 2001). It is possible that fire perimeters, especially older fires, weren’t accurately mapped, that some areas within a fire perimeter may not have burned, or that small fires occurred but were not detected or recorded (Morgan et al. 2001). These are simply the realities associated with using historical fire perimeter data as a tool for stratification and sampling. While we attempted to confirm our sampling using historical Landsat imagery, there is no “truth” to confirm that either data source is correct. It is also possible that because of small unrecorded fires or small unburned islands within historical fire perimeters, sample plots were located in areas that burned with a different fire history than that recorded in the <b>fire</b> <b>atlas.</b> It is also worth noting that fire behavior would have varied among sites and across years.|$|E
30|$|Fire atlases {{are rich}} but {{imperfect}} records of fire extent. In the Iron Creek Mesa {{area of the}} GW, some sample plots were located near the boundary of two intersecting fire perimeters. To check the accuracy of these two <b>fire</b> <b>atlas</b> perimeters we used to stratify our sampling, we used Landsat TM images to map burned area perimeters of two fires (1985, 1993) sampled in the GW (Holden et al. 2005). Correspondence between the atlas-derived and imagery-derived fire perimeters was high, especially at the eastern and western edges that defined boundaries between fire treatments (1 x, and 2 x+ burned areas), confirming our sampling stratification for overlapping areas of the 1985 and 1993 fire perimeters. The relatively large number of smaller fires in the SW made a similar assessment of fire perimeter accuracy for that area impractical. However, recent work in the Saguaro Wilderness using randomly sampled fire-scarred trees to estimate 20 th-century fire perimeters confirms that fires in that area, including older fires, were mapped {{with a high degree}} of accuracy in the digital <b>fire</b> <b>atlas</b> (Farris et al., in press).|$|E

Between August 1996 and July 2000, the ATSR fire-counts are used to provide specific locations of emissions and a record of interannual variability throughout the world.

In other words, within each basin we wanted a continuous study area in which part of the area had not been burned by WFU fires, part was burned by one WFU fire, part by two WFU fires, and so on up to four WFU fires for Illilouette basin and three for the Sugarloaf basin. We used the digital <b>fire</b> <b>atlases</b> to designate these study areas. We stratified these study areas by burn frequency (0 to 4 burns) then established a 200 -m grid for stand structure sample plot locations.

Our goal was to sample a minimum of five plots in each burn frequency stratum, and augment that as time and area permitted. In larger strata we sampled up to nine plots. In 2002, we sampled 63 0.05 -ha circular plots between study areas, 24 in Illilouette and 39 in Sugarloaf.

40|$|Topography, vegetation, {{and climate}} act {{together}} {{to determine the}} spatial patterns of fires at landscape scales. Knowledge of landscape-fire-climate relations at these broad scales (1, 000 s ha to 100, 000 s ha) is limited and is largely based on inferences and extrapolations from fire histories reconstructed from finer scales. In this study, we used long time series of fire perimeter data (<b>fire</b> <b>atlases)</b> and data for topography, vegetation, and climate to evaluate relationships between large 20 thcentury fires and landscape characteristics in two contrasting areas: the 486, 673 -ha Gila/Aldo Leopold Wilderness Complex (GALWC) in New Mexico, USA, and the 785, 090 -ha Sel-way-Bitterroot Wilderness Complex (SBWC) in Idaho and Montana, USA. There were important similarities and differences in gradients of topography, vegetation, and climate for areas with different fire frequencies, both within and between study areas. These unique and general relationships, when compared between study areas, highlight important characteristics of fire regimes in the Northern and Southern Rocky Mountains of the Western United States. Results suggest that amount and horizontal continuity of herbaceous fuels limit the frequency and spread of surface fires in the GALWC, while the moisture status of large fuels and crown fuels limits the fre-quency of moderate-to-high severity fires in the SBWC. These empirically described spatial and temporal rela-tionships between fire, landscape attributes, and climate increase understanding of interactions among broad-scale ecosystem processes.

30|$|The {{high degree}} of {{agreement}} between fire-scar reconstructed extent and digital atlas extent for the first WFU fires in each study area (1974 in Illilouette, Figure 2; 1973 in Sugarloaf, Figure 3) is likely attributed to more uniform burning {{as a result of}} greater fuel accumulation during the fire exclusion period (Collins and Stephens 2007). The higher fire-scar reconstructed extent (relative to the atlas extent) for the 1974 Starr King fire in the Illilouette study area {{is a product of the}} convex hull polygons we created around recording fire scars, which tends to over simplify the more complex fire perimeters (Figure 2). For all fires except the first WFU fire in Illilouette, fire-scar reconstructed extent and the theoretical maximum reconstructed extent were less than the digital <b>atlas</b> <b>fire</b> extent (Figure 5). This is not surprising given both the stochastic nature of fire scar formation, and that our fire scar collection was based primarily on gridded plots within strata developed to optimize sampling areas of different burn frequencies, rather than collection intended to maximize area within WFU fire perimeters. What is more surprising is that some fires are completely missed (1977 in Sugarloaf) in the fire-scar record, or only detected at small spatial scales (1974 in Sugarloaf, 1988 in Illilouette). It is very plausible that without the knowledge of fires obtained from <b>fire</b> <b>atlases</b> and burn severity images, several fires between the two study areas would be interpreted as localized in extent, when in fact they were relatively large. Baker and Ehle (2001) refer to fires detected in the tree-ring records at small spatial extents as creating the “small fire problem.” Minnich et al. (2000) made a similar claim, stating that fire scar reconstructions “give undue importance to small fires.” Both of these studies suggest that fires detected at small spatial scales in the tree-ring record inflate estimates of fire frequency. We have shown that in fact, the opposite is true, at least for the Sierra Nevada Jeffrey pine mixed forests that we studied. The estimates of fire rotation based on fire-scar reconstructions are much longer than those based on the digital atlases (Figure 5).|$|R
30|$|<b>Fire</b> <b>atlases,</b> {{also called}} digital polygon fire histories, are {{compilations}} of annual fire perimeter records. On many federal {{lands in the}} western United States, historical fire perimeters have been digitized from hand-drawn maps and from fire incident reports. More recently, they have been inferred from satellite imagery (e.g., the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity project; www.mtbs.gov), infrared sensing, or hand-held global positioning system (GPS) receivers, and integrated into a geographic information system (GIS). These digitized records contain georeferenced fire perimeters; thus, they differ from point records of fire occurrence and size (e.g., those used by Westerling et al. 2006), {{as well as from}} records of annual area burned compiled for national forests or regions (e.g., those used by Littell et al. 2009). When combined with other georeferenced records such as topography and vegetation type, georeferenced fire perimeters can be used to describe fire patterns over all parts of the landscape through time, thus better informing our understanding of what determines those fire patterns (Rollins et al. 2001, 2002). Both ignition and area burned are influenced by complex, multiscale interactions among fuels, climate, weather, topography, and human action (Krawchuk et al. 2009, Parisien and Moritz 2009, Parisien et al. 2011). Characterizing this variation, termed pyrogeography, is critical to understanding both the causes and consequences of fire, and how these vary in response to climate, topography, land use, and vegetation—all of which interact at multiple scales. Parisien and Moritz (2009) lamented the paucity of analyses of the “habitat” of fire across environmental gradients, while highlighting its value in understanding and predicting the response of fire to changing climate and fire management.|$|R
30|$|Uncertainty {{associated}} with fire-scar reconstructions of historical fire occurrence {{has led to}} questioning both estimates of frequency derived from these methods and the inferences on fire regimes drawn from these estimates. Using information from multiple, naturally-occurring fires (referred to as wildland fire use (WFU) fires) in two Sierra Nevada wilderness areas, we identified forest structural, topographic, and fire characteristics influencing fire scarring in trees and conducted direct comparisons of fire-scar reconstructed fire extent and frequency to fire atlas-based estimates of fire extent and frequency. The most important factor influencing the probability of sampled Pinus jeffreyi trees scarring from WFU fires was {{the length of time}} since previous fire. When intervals between successive fires are short, probabilities of scarring were low. Tree basal area and aspect were also significant factors explaining observed pattern of tree scarring. In all WFU fires but one, the reconstructed extent of fires was substantially smaller than the <b>fire</b> <b>atlas</b> extent. As a result, fire-scar reconstructed estimates of fire rotation were much longer than <b>fire</b> <b>atlas</b> fire rotation. This information can provide some necessary insight in interpreting and accounting for uncertainty in fire-scar reconstructions for drier low- to mid-elevation forest types throughout the western United States.|$|E
30|$|The {{existence}} of fires {{after the turn}} of the century is unique for fire history reconstructions in the Sierra Nevada and allows for comparison with the <b>fire</b> <b>atlas</b> (Figure 6). Although samples were not specifically collected to calibrate the <b>fire</b> <b>atlas,</b> Clusters 1, 2, and 5 were within the boundaries of mapped fires. Cluster 1 was within the perimeter of two fires; the first fire occurred in 1914 and then was subsequently re-burned in 1960. Nine out of the 11 samples recorded the 1914 fire but none recorded the 1960 fire. Cluster 2 was within the boundary of a 1926 fire with two samples recording the event. Cluster 5 was also within the 1960 fire, and three out of the five samples recorded this event. The fact that not all samples recorded the fires in the atlas can be testament to the patchy mosaic of fire in this ecosystem.
