40|$|The dynamic {{behavior}} of the bond slip between a <b>deformed</b> <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bar</b> and plain concrete has been experimentally investigated by employing Hopkinson bar techniques. Pullout tests with various specimen types (unconfined, confined, cast-in-place, post-installed etc.) have been performed. Pullout of the steel rebar and splitting of the concrete cylinder have been the failure modes induced. Test results comprise peak pullout forces and complete bond stress-slip diagrams. They clearly show that the dynamic pullout forces and curves are well above the static ones, and that the pullout work of bond failure is considerably greater for the dynamic impact loading. Confinement, provided by a steel tube, leads to improved bonding; peak loads increase up to 2. 5 times. The effects of bond length and concrete strength have also been put into evidence. Finally it has been verified that post-installed rebars, depending upon the particular adhesive employed, can achieve the same bond resistance as the cast-in-place ones. JRC. DG.

40|$|The {{excellent}} {{corrosion resistance}} of discrete steel fibres in concrete {{may be due}} to the small size of fibres since macrocell corrosion with large cathode, small anode effects cannot occur for discrete steel fibres as it would for continuous steel rebar. The paper addresses this hypothesis by presenting the results of experiments into the corrosion behavior in concrete of various lengths (20 mm to 160 mm) and diameters (0. 27 mm to 1. 90 mm) of low carbon steel wires and 12 mm diameter, 300 mm long conventional <b>deformed</b> <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bar.</b> Concrete prisms containing electrodes of different dimensions of steel wire were exposed to wet-dry cycles of sea water spray for 600 days. Corrosion potentials, E-c,E- and polarisation resistance, R-p, of the wires were monitored during the exposure period. The results show that corrosion potentials and polarisation resistance of low carbon steel wires (fibres) are not influenced by the diameter or length of steel wires (fibres). Corrosion resistance of low carbon steel fibres (wires) is superior to that of conventional rebar. Corrosion of both conventional reinforcement and steel fibres (wires) is anodically controlled...|$|E

40|$|The {{object of}} this thesis {{is to examine}} the effect of strain ageing on the tensile and {{fracture}} properties of reinforcing steels and to determine economically feasible methods of reducing strain age embrittlement in reinforcing bar contained in reinforced concrete structures. The effect of titanium and vanadium additions to normal reinforcing steels on strain ageing has been investigated by obtaining the resultant changes in mechanical properties. Both these transition elements have been effective in reducing strain ageing to a negligible level when present in sufficient quantities, while titanium also reduces the asrolled transition temperature and increases the Luder's strain. Examined in detail also is the effect of strain ageing on the mechanical properties of a normal reinforcing steel and a similar titanium-bearing steel after variation of plastic strain, ageing temperature and ageing time. Due to the stabilizing effect of the titanium addition, this steel exhibits superior impact properties over the normal steel when strained and then aged at or below 100 °C. When the ageing temperature is increased above 100 °C, these stabilized characteristics are gradually removed and hence the fracture properties tend to that of the normal steel. A critical study of the existing standards for bends in <b>deformed</b> <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bar</b> shows the necessity for modification of these standards to eliminate the possibility of brittle fracture at bends as a result of strain age embrittlement. Recommendations for these modifications are made from the determination of safe bend diameters obtained using data from field failures at bends...|$|E
40|$|The {{previous}} Grade 275 and Grade 380 reinforcing steels {{have been}} respectively replaced by Grade 300 and Grade 430 steels confirming {{to the new}} standard NZS 3402, released in December 1989. Grade 300 is similar to, but a little stronger than, the previous Grade 275. Grade 430 has a significantly higher yield strength, lower strain hardening rate and is more ductile and readily weldable {{when compared to the}} old Grade 380. This project was carried out to investigate the distribution of mechanical properties for NZS 3402 Grade 300, and the micro-alloyed Grade 430 reinforcing steel manufactured by Pacific Steel Ltd. The investigation was based on data supplied by Pacific Steel Ltd and on data generated from mechanical tests carried out in the Materials Laboratory of the Mechanical Engineering Department, University of Canterbury. Tensile testing was carried out on the supplied material in the as rolled (<b>deformed</b> <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bar)</b> condition and on standard tensile specimens machined from these bars. One machined tensile specimen was pre-strained 5 % and artificially aged to determine a strain ageing index for each cast supplied. For both grades of steel distributions of lower yield strength, tensile strength, elongation at fracture, Luder strain at the yield point, strain hardening parameters n and k, and three parameters measuring strain ageing index were determined. The characteristic yield strength, minimum and maximum yield strength ranges obtained were found to comply with the specified tensile properties in the new specification. Multiple linear regression techniques were used to investigate relationships between the determined mechanical properties and the steels chemical composition as determined by Pacific Steel Ltd. The regression analysis yielded simple linear equations which can be used to predict the mechanical properties of bars from production variations in chemical composition. These equations reveal that the improved properties of Grade 430 reinforcing steel is mainly attributed to the addition of 0. 04 % vanadium.

Excessive amounts of longitudinal and transverse reinforcement (in excess of 2 % reinforcement ratio) are required to provide essentially elastic behavior for the SSE and to resist the design demands. Additionally, conventional single-leg tie reinforcement with 90 ° and 135 ° hooks at alternate ends are required at some locations for seismic detailing.

Wall splice specimens were tested under a four-point loading arrangement with the lapped bars located in the constant moment region. The applied load and specimen deflection were recorded until failure occurred. A numerical analysis was then performed to calculate the maximum resistance of the spliced bars. The specimens with contact lap splices developed the theoretical yield capacity of the <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars.</b> In contrast, the wall splice specimens with non-contact lap splices developed an average tensile resistance of 78 % of the theoretical yield capacity. The difference between the average tensile resistances of the lapped bars in the two splice arrangements was identified as being statistically significant at the 95 % confidence level. On average, the contact and non-contact lap spliced bars in the double pullout specimens developed 8. 47 % and 41. 2 % less tensile resistance, respectively, as compared to the wall splice specimens with the identical splice arrangement.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the topic of}} local bond behaviour in RC structures. The mechanism of bond refers to the composite action between <b>deformed</b> steel <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars</b> and the surrounding concrete. Bond behaviour is an open research topic with a wide scope, particularly because bond {{it is such a}} fundamental concept to structural engineers. However, despite many bond-related research findings having wide applications, the primary contribution of this research is an experimental evaluation of the prominent features of local bond behaviour and the associated implications for the seismic performance of RC structures. The findings presented in this thesis attempt to address some structural engineering recommendations made by the Canterbury Earthquakes Royal Commission following the 2010 - 2011 Canterbury (New Zealand) earthquake sequence. A chapter of this thesis discusses the structural behaviour of flexure-dominated RC wall structures with an insufficient quantity of longitudinal reinforcement, among other in situ conditions, that causes material damage to predominantly occur at a single crack plane. In this particular case, the extent of concrete damage and bond deterioration adjacent to the crack plane will influence the ductility capacity that is effectively provided by the reinforcing steel. As a consequence of these in situ conditions, some lightly reinforced wall buildings in Christchurch lost their structural integrity due to brittle fracture of the longitudinal reinforcement. With these concerning post-earthquake observations in mind, there is the underlying intention that this thesis presents experimental evidence of bond behaviour that allows structural engineers to re-assess their confidence levels for the ability of lightly reinforced concrete structures to achieve the life-safety seismic performance objective the ultimate limit state. Three chapters of this thesis are devoted to the experimental work that was conducted as the main contribution of this research. Critical details of the experimental design, bond testing method and test programme are reported. The bond stress-slip relationship was studied through 75 bond pull-out tests. In order to measure the maximum local bond strength, all bond tests were carried out on <b>deformed</b> <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars</b> that did not yield as the embedded bond length was relatively short. Bond test results have been presented in two separate chapters in which 48 monotonic bond tests and 27 cyclic bond tests are presented. Permutations of the experiments include the loading rate, cyclic loading history, concrete strength (25 to 70 MPa), concrete age, cover thickness, bar diameter (16 and 20 mm), embedded length, and position of the embedded bond region within the specimen (close or far away to the free surface). The parametric study showed that the concrete strength significantly influences the maximum bond strength and that it is reasonable to normalise the bond stress by the square-root of the concrete compressive strength, √(f'c). The generalised monotonic bond behaviour is described within. An important outcome of the research is that the measured bond strength and stiffness was higher than stated by the bond stress-slip relationship in the fib Model Code 2010. To account for these observed differences, an alternative model is proposed for the local monotonic bond stress-slip relationship. Cyclic bond tests showed a significant proportion of the total bond degradation occurs after the loading cycle in the peak bond strength range, which is when bond slip has exceeded 0. 5 mm. Subsequent loading to constant slip values showed a linear relationship between the amount of bond strength degradation and the log of the number of cycles that were applied. To a greater extent, the cyclic bond deterioration depends on the bond slip range, regardless of whether the applied load cycling is half- or fully-reversed. The observed bond deterioration and hysteretic energy dissipated during cyclic loading was found to agree reasonably well between these cyclic tests with different loading protocols. The cyclic bond deterioration was also found to be reasonably consistent exponential damage models found in the literature. This research concluded that the <b>deformed</b> <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars</b> used in NZ construction, embedded in moderate to high strength concrete, are able to develop high local bond stresses that are mobilised by a small amount of local bond slip. Although the relative rib geometry was not varied within this experimental programme, a general conclusion of this thesis is that deformed bars currently available in NZ have a relative rib bearing area that is comparatively higher than the test bars used in previous international research. From the parametric study {{it was found that the}} maximum monotonic bond strength is significant enhanced by dynamic loading rates. Experimental evidence of high bond strength and initial bond stiffness generally suggests that only a small amount of local bond slip that can occur when the deformed test bar was subjected to large tension forces. Minimal bond slip and bond damage limits the effective yielding length that is available for the reinforcing steel to distribute inelastic material strains. Consequently, the potential for brittle fracture of the reinforcement may be a more problematic and widespread issue than is apparent to structural engineers. This research has provided information that improve the reliability of engineering predictions (with respect to ductility capacity) of maximum crack widths and the extent of bond deterioration that might occur in RC structures during seismic actions...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2015 Large {{numbers of}} {{reinforced}} concrete deck girder (RCDG) bridges were built during the highway infrastructure {{boom of the}} 1950 's. The advent of standardized <b>deformed</b> steel <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars</b> during this time allowed for straight bar terminations in flexural tension regions. Designers of the time terminated <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars</b> where {{they were no longer}} required by calculation and did not account for additional demands from the combination of shear and flexure. The design provisions of the time allowed higher shear stresses in the concrete than allowed in standards today which reduced the required quantity of transverse reinforcing steel. In addition, heavier trucks and higher traffic volumes on roadways today have greatly increased the service loading on these bridges. Engineers evaluating these older RCDG bridges often determine unsatisfactory load ratings due to flexural anchorage deficiencies in the girders, especially when the influence of shear is considered. These deficiencies result from inadequate capacity compared to current design standards due to poor cutoff details used in the initial design. Strengthening methods are necessary because comprehensive replacements of the large number of bridges are not economically feasible. Experimental research was conducted to evaluate the behavior of poorly detailed flexural anchorages and to develop methods to strengthen them. Realistic vintage girder specimens were constructed, retrofitted, instrumented, and tested to failure. The specimens reported in this thesis were full-scale inverted-T (IT) beams. Some of the specimens contained straight bar terminations crossing a preformed diagonal crack in the flexural tension region to investigate the influence of shear on the retrofit schemes. Instrumentation focused on measurement of the reinforcing steel stresses surrounding the diagonal crack and along the development length of the cutoff bars. Using results of past research to quantify the behavior of girders with straight-bar flexural anchorages in flexural tension regions, an innovative strengthening technique was developed using either near-surface mounted (NSM) stainless steel or titanium. Results from the NSM strengthening technique demonstrated the ability to delay or prevent flexural anchorage failures, with increased deformation capacities and increased strengths from 17...|$|R
40|$|A {{previously}} completed {{study in}} the field of concrete block construction by Ahmed and Feldman (2012) indicated that, on average, the <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars</b> in non-contact lap splices, where the lapped bars are located in adjacent cells, only develop 71 % of the tensile resistance of spliced bars which are in contact. An experimental program was therefore initiated to design and evaluate remedial measures which can potentially increase the tensile resistance of non-contact lap splices to that of contact lap splice of the same lap length. Implementation of the proposed measures in various field situations was also analyzed. Six unique remedial splice details, along with standard contact and unaltered non-contact lap splices were evaluated and compared. The mitigative details included providing additional confinement, installing knock-out webs, placing splice reinforcement between the lapped bars, and combinations of these aforementioned details. Three replicates of each splice detail were constructed for a total of 24 wall splice specimens. Each wall splice specimen was reinforced with No. 15 Grade 400 <b>deformed</b> steel <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars</b> with 200 mm lap splice lengths at located the midspan. The specimens were tested in a horizontal position under a monotonic, four-point loading geometry. Load and deflection data were collected throughout testing and were subsequently used in an iterative moment-curvature analysis to calculate the maximum tensile resistance of the spliced reinforcement. This was then used to compare the structural performance of each remedial splice detail to the standard contact and non-contact lap splices. The wall splice specimens which contained non-contact lap splices with knock-out webs, s-shaped, and transverse reinforcement in the splice region achieved similar tensile capacities as the wall splice specimens with standard contact lap splices. Industry professionals have indicated that the installation of the remedial measures evaluated in this study would not affect the constructability of masonry assemblages in field situations. The splice detail with knock-out webs confined within the lap splice length was determined to be the most viable procedure as it can be installed to increase the resistance of non-contact lap splices in almost all construction situations. This remedial procedure was able to improve the tensile resistance of the lapped reinforcement by 63 % compared to the wall splice specimens with standard non-contact lap splices...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the research {{presented in this paper}} is to develop a new nondestructive test method to determine the cover thickness of <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars</b> in concrete structures that contain closely arranged <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars.</b> Even though the commercial covermeters based on magnetic and electrical methods are widely used in the detection of the depth and location of <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars,</b> they are not suitable in the case of bars with small spacing. The technique proposed in this paper for detection of the closely arranged <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars</b> makes use of stress waves. The conception of the new test scheme originated {{from the fact that the}} propagation of stress waves follows the shortest travel path dominated by the <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bar</b> under the test point and is not affected by adjacent <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars.</b> Numerical studies were performed to investigate how the travel time of a P-wave propagating through <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars</b> is changed as the test line is moved away from the axis of the <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars.</b> Experimental studies were performed on concrete specimens that contain <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars</b> with close spacing. Results obtained from numerical analysis show that when the test point is not exactly above the steel bar the travel time for a P-wave is increased with an increase in distance from the test line to the <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bar</b> Experimental results show that no matter how close the <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars</b> are placed in concrete specimens, the cover thickness of the bars can be still measured accurately...|$|R
40|$|Several {{strategies}} {{are available to}} the Iowa Department of Transportation (IaDOT) for limiting deterioration due to chloride-induced corrosion of embedded <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars</b> in concrete bridge decks. While the method most commonly used throughout the Midwestern United States is to construct concrete bridge decks with fusion-bonded epoxy-coated <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars,</b> galvanized <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars</b> are an available alternative. Previous studies of the in situ performance of galvanized <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars</b> in service in bridge decks have been limited. IaDOT requested that Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates, Inc.
