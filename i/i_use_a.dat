Probably the first guitarist I was emulating was Scotty Moore, when I was maybe 6 or 7. And he played with a pick, but he also used fingers. And {{a lot of the}} session players, like Chet Atkins, they played with fingers or a pick. Then I listened to a certain amount of light classical guitar playing. And of course later on, when the first wave of rock 'n' roll kind of fell away, folk music was very popular and very influential in my style. So it was really less of a choice than what I fell into. <b>I</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> pick occasionally. I certainly use it more in the studio when {{you want to get a}} certain tone. But it's just the way I came up. I wasn't taught. I just sort of figured things out on my own terms. I guess that was one of the ways that I became comfortable and it just kind of set in.|$|E

[...] "I enjoy an action movie as much as the next person [...] it’s not something that I would like to do solely."

The liner notes read: [...] "My arrangements of [...] Three Gymnopédies comprise ALL the notes of the original piano versions: a most complex process since all the piano sounds must fit comfortably, or uncomfortably, onto the six strings of the guitar." [...] He continues to say: [...] "The present recording is done {{as it is in}} concert, on one classical guitar, without overdubbing. My tempo is a little quicker than when the pieces are played on the piano, due to the shorter resonance time of notes played on the Spanish guitar. Now and then, <b>I</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> 'vibrato' and slides, which, of course, can't be done on the piano but which add warmth of expression to this undeniably charming, exotic and mystic music." ...|$|E

Paolini commented: [...] " [...] did a god-awful amount of research into the subject when I was composing it. I found that it gave the world a much richer feel, a much older feel, using these words that had been around for centuries and centuries. I {{had a lot of}} fun with that." [...] Picking the right names for the characters and places was a process that could take [...] "days, weeks, or even years". Paolini said: [...] "if I have difficulty choosing the correct moniker, <b>I</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> placeholder name until a replacement suggests itself." [...] He added that he was [...] "really lucky" [...] with the name Eragon, [...] "because it's just dragon with one letter changed." [...] Also, Paolini commented that he thought of both parts of the name [...] "Eragon" [...] - [...] "era" [...] and [...] "gone" [...] - as if the name itself changes the era in which the character lives. [...] He thought the name fit the book perfectly, but some of the other names caused him [...] "real headaches".|$|E

2500|$|In woodworking, surforms {{are used}} for rapidly {{removing}} wood from curved surfaces. They remove less wood than a drawknife, so they are easier to control. Even though surforms leave very coarse finishes, the worked areas can be easily smoothed with finer tools, such as files and sanding blocks. Woodworker Sam Maloof described their use in chairmaking: [...] "Once I have roughed out the arm on the bandsaw, <b>I</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> Surform® (Stanley® model No. 295). This tool does about the same job as a spokeshave -- it can take {{off a lot of}} wood very quickly -- but I can use it without worrying about grain direction." ...|$|E

2500|$|During the {{sessions}} for [...] "Sunday Bloody Sunday", Lillywhite encouraged drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. {{to use a}} click track, but Mullen was firmly against the idea. [...] A chance meeting with Andy Newmark (of Sly & the Family Stone) – a drummer who used a click track religiously – changed Mullen's mind. [...] Mullen used the click track to stay in time for other songs on the album. Mullen said of the album in a 1983 interview, [...] "I think the drumming has always been pretty simple, I don't think {{it needs to be}} flashy. For War <b>I</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> click track, something I haven't used before, it's a way of keeping time in my headphones. When I listened to the music in time with the click track I knew I had to bring it down to the real basics. Hopefully for the next LP it will be more complicated, I'll move on. I {{think of it as a}} musical progression for myself because I learned a lot recording this album, just about my own style and that's what I wanted to do. I think there is a definite style on War where there isn't on the previous albums." ...|$|E
2500|$|Chambers married jeweler Irving Williams in 1976 {{and took}} over his Brooklyn jewelry repair {{business}} upon his death in 1978. Donna Chambers Designs was established in 1981 to create and manufacture 14-karat gold and cultured pearl fine jewelry. [...] Later a line of porcelain cameos featuring African American women were added {{as well as a}} line of antique mother-of-pearl Chinese gambling chips further enhanced with pearls. The poker chips, which form the centerpieces of bracelets, earrings and pendants, date from the Ching Dynasty and typically bear family crests or initials {{on one side and a}} drawing engraved with some aspect of Chinese life on the other. Chambers came across the poker chips by accident. [...] "I'm known as the pearl lady....My work has always been of pearl, whether freshwater or cultured. <b>I</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> lot of mother of pearl, abalone, and mabes. I was in Tuscon ... and I did a double take," [...] Chambers said, [...] "I saw these mother-of-pearl, beautiful carved pieces...I picked up a few and made two or three pins with them." [...] The positive reaction to the gambling chip jewelry was so strong that they have become her signature jewelry line. Both Lonnie Anderson and Cissy Houston have purchased pearls from Chambers’ line.|$|E
