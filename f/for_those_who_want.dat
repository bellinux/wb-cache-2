500|$|According to Satoru Iwata, former President of Nintendo, Dragon Quests {{widespread}} {{appeal is}} that it is [...] "made so that anyone can play it...and anyone can enjoy it depending on their different levels and interests." [...] According to him, Dragon Quest is designed for anyone to pick up without needing to read the manual in order to understand it. Ryutaro Ichimura, producer at Square Enix, who has played the game since he was a child, says the Dragon Quest storylines allow players to experience a moving sense of achievement where they take the role of a hero saving the world. Horii believes the ability to appeal to larger audiences of casual gamers, while not alienating the more hardcore gamers, is due to being able to lower the initial hurdle without making it too easy. Iwata and Ichimura believe it is because the games are created in a way that allows both groups to pursue their own goals; casual gamers can enjoy the storyline and battles, but <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>want</b> more there is still content for them to pursue.|$|E
500|$|The school's {{philosophy}} {{is that students}} learn best at their own pace. The original curriculum was a cross between [...] "instruction and home life". The Albany Free School has no firm schedule and does not grade students. The day begins at 8:15a.m. and students are asked {{what they want to}} do each day. Students are grouped by age and present their own plan for each day. They pursue various projects including writing, filmmaking, and studying language or history. The school also offers structured math and reading classes <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>want</b> it. Classes tend to have five to seven students per teacher and the school's teacher–student relationships are close. Teachers report a relative ease in holding students accountable to their stated plans. In 2006, the school had ten teachers, four interns, and a number of parent volunteers for 58 students between the ages of three and fourteen (pre-K to eighth grade). The school has a [...] "Living and Learning" [...] program between 10 a.m. and noon, followed by lunch, which the students make themselves as part of the program. The children play sports until their 3 p.m. class and school ends at 4 p.m.|$|E

[...] Carlos McElfish of GameZone warned that [...] "if you are looking for an innovative and original experience that does justice to the series you’ll have to look elsewhere." [...] Official Xbox Magazine concluded that [...] "this is a game <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>want</b> what Crash has always had to offer – good graphics, jump-and-spin gameplay, and tons of collectible items. Nothing more, nothing less." [...] Hilary Goldstein felt that while Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex was [...] "a fun game for the most part," [...] "it fails in some areas, like proper game balance and correct use of surround sound." [...] Star Dingo of GamePro concluded that [...] "love it or hate it, Wrath of Cortex Xbox is more of more of the same." [...] Electronic Gaming Monthly felt that [...] "save for a few additions to WOC, like some cool hamster-ball levels, it's almost identical to its predecessors." ...|$|E

500|$|Sunset Overdrives {{gameplay}} {{was also}} commended by many reviewers. Prell compared the game favorably to Jet Grind Radio, Saints Row The Third, Infamous, and Ratchet & Clank. He singled out the traversal system, which {{he thought was}} fluid and well-executed. He added that the fast travel system was not useful in this game, since players can {{find a lot of}} fun by simply traveling between different locations in the game's world. He thought that all of the game's systems intertwined with each other, and ultimately made the game a complete and worthwhile experience. Reiner echoed similar thoughts, and considered getting around Sunset City fun for players. He added that the traversal system increased the game's replay value. However, he was disappointed by the game's occasionally repetitive mission design. Sliva and Brown shared similar thoughts, with the latter saying that the game featured too many fetch quests. Patterson disliked the game's traversal; he found that the system was frustrating at times. However, he thought that this problem [...] lessened as players unlocked new moves and skills. Gies felt overwhelmed by the traversal options. He added that Insomniac had successfully created a system that was accessible for ordinary players, while creating challenges <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>want</b> to master the system. However, he noted the camera system may not able to track the movement of the character accurately. He further commended the game's world design, and described it {{as one of the most}} [...] "navigationally sophisticated" [...] worlds he had ever experienced in a game. [...] Bischoff considered the shooting mechanic [...] "loose", but thought that the problem was overshadowed by the game's forgiving aiming and steady difficulty curve. Lucas Sullivan also criticized the mechanic, calling it [...] "inconsistent".|$|E
