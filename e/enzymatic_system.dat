5000|$|The glycine {{cleavage}} system (GCS) is {{also known}} as the glycine decarboxylase complex or GDC. The system is a series of enzymes that are triggered in response to high concentrations of the amino acid glycine. The same set of enzymes is sometimes referred to as glycine synthase when it runs in the reverse direction to form glycine. The glycine cleavage system is composed of four proteins: the T-protein, P-protein, L-protein, and H-protein. They do not form a stable complex, so it is more appropriate to call it a [...] "system" [...] instead of a [...] "complex". The H-protein is responsible for interacting with the three other proteins and acts as a shuttle for some of the intermediate products in glycine decarboxylation. In both animals and plants the glycine cleavage system is loosely attached to the inner membrane of the mitochondria. Mutations in this <b>enzymatic</b> <b>system</b> are linked with glycine encephalopathy.|$|E

40|$|The {{collection}} of papers {{is the result}} of the first year's results of the Project: METABOLISM AND MOLECULAR SYSTEMS FOR THE BIOTRANSFORMATION OF AROMATIC MOLECULES. Aim of the research project is to gain knowledge in microorganisms endowed with the ability of transforming aromatic compounds, and in the genes and enzymes involved in this process. Particular attention is paid to the information acquired for its use in the development of biosynthetic systems for bioremediation and bioconversions. The pathways responsible for the aerobic catabolism of aromatic molecules are generally made up of an upper pathway, where hydroxylation reactions leading to the formation of hydroxylated intermediates occur, and a lower pathway where the aromatic ring of these dihydroxylated molecules are cleaved, and eventually converted, after several enzymatic steps, into intermediates of the Krebs cycle. It goes without saying that the great potential of these systems is related to the acquisition of information about the <b>enzymatic</b> <b>systems</b> involved and the regulation of their corresponding genes. The utilization of these micro-organisms can be expanded and improved by: (i) characterizing new microorganisms and their <b>enzymatic</b> <b>systems</b> to sort out a wide panel of <b>enzymatic</b> <b>systems</b> endowed with different metabolic abilities and different specificity, (ii) elucidating the transcriptional regulation and the molecular determinants responsible for the <b>enzymatic</b> activities in <b>systems</b> that are already known and in those that will be available during the development of the project. Moreover, in order to evaluate the influence of the information gained in developing processes it will be necessary to (iii) validate the development of a small number of applications.

40|$|Abstract Background Oxygen {{deficiency}} in tumor tissue {{is associated with}} a malign phenotype, characterized by high invasiveness, increased metastatic potential and poor prognosis. Hypoxia chambers are the established standard model for in vitro studies on tumor hypoxia. An enzymatic hypoxia system (GOX/CAT) based on the use of glucose oxidase (GOX) and catalase (CAT) that allows induction of stable hypoxia for in vitro approaches more rapidly and with less operating expense has been introduced recently. Aim of this work is to compare the <b>enzymatic</b> <b>system</b> with the established technique of hypoxia chamber in respect of gene expression, glucose metabolism and radioresistance, prior to its application for in vitro investigation of oxygen deficiency. Methods Human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma HNO 97 cells were incubated under normoxic and hypoxic conditions using both hypoxia chamber and the enzymatic model. Gene expression was investigated using Agilent microarray chips and real time PCR analysis. 14 C-fluoro-deoxy-glucose uptake experiments were performed in order to evaluate cellular metabolism. Cell proliferation after photon irradiation was investigated for evaluation of radioresistance under normoxia and hypoxia using both a hypoxia chamber and the <b>enzymatic</b> <b>system.</b> Results The microarray analysis revealed a similar trend in the expression of known HIF- 1 target genes between the two hypoxia systems for HNO 97 cells. Quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated different kinetic patterns in the expression of carbonic anhydrase IX and lysyl oxidase, which might be due to the faster induction of hypoxia by the <b>enzymatic</b> <b>system.</b> 14 C-fluoro-deoxy-glucose uptake assays showed a higher glucose metabolism under hypoxic conditions, especially for the <b>enzymatic</b> <b>system.</b> Proliferation experiments after photon irradiation revealed increased survival rates for the enzymatic model compared to hypoxia chamber and normoxia, indicating enhanced resistance to irradiation. While the GOX/CAT system allows independent investigation of hypoxia and oxidative stress, care must be taken to prevent acidification during longer incubation.
