5|$|From {{the start}} of the production, Atlus staff saw Shin Megami Tensei as a chance to create a game with the company's brand on it. The staff saw it as a remake of the {{previous}} Megami Tensei game; because of this, they knew what was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> the story, and the development went smoothly. The story went through multiple revisions, and many settings were inspired by the staff's personal lives. The character and demon designs were done by Kazuma Kaneko, who used mythical figures and multiple clothing styles in his designs. Reception and sales for the game have been highly positive, and its success helped launch Atlus as a developer and publisher, along with popularizing the Megami Tensei series.|$|E

25|$|The {{prominence}} of failed prophecy also lends {{support to the}} cult theory. NESARA supporters often tell their readers that the NESARA announcement is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> a matter of days. These claims have been made too many times to enumerate, without ever coming to fruition. According to the documentary Waiting For NESARA, the claim was also made prior to March 2003 that George Bush was planning the war with Iraq only to further delay the NESARA announcement. It was prophesied that spiritual beings and UFOs would intervene with Bush's plans and prevent the war.|$|E

Benioff stated, [...] "We had this meeting with George Martin where we're trying {{to get as much}} information as possible out of him, and probably the most shocking revelation he had for us was when he told us the origin of Hodor and how that name came about. I just remember Dan and I looking at each other when he said that and just being like, 'Holy shit.'" [...] Weiss continued, [...] "It {{was just one of the}} saddest and most affecting things. Even sitting in a hotel room having someone tell you this was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> the abstract in some way and that 'hold the door' was the origin of the name Hodor, we just thought that was a really, really heart-breaking idea." ...|$|E
500|$|Durand {{was never}} {{informed}} of his character's arc and only learned more of Keamy's {{importance to the}} plot as he received new scripts; thus, he was thrilled when the role was expanded for his third appearance, in [...] "The Shape of Things to Come", when he kills Alex and Durand compared his excitement to that of [...] "a kid in a candy store." [...] He also stated that [...] "you really don't know what's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> the next episode {{and you get the}} scripts pretty late, so it is pretty secretive and it's kind of exciting that way [...] you're really forced to get in the moment and say the words and play the guy". [...] Durand was initially met with negative reaction from fans on the street for this action and he defended his murderous character by arguing that it was actually more Ben's fault for failing to negotiate with Keamy; later, fans warmed up to Keamy. [...] Despite the antagonist's increasing popularity and fanbase, it became apparent to Durand that fans were hoping for Keamy's death in what promised to be a showdown in the season finale. [...] Throughout his nine-episode run, Keamy never receives an episode in which his backstory is developed through flashbacks and Durand holds this partially responsible for the negative reaction to his character, saying that the audience [...] " [...] really seen anything outside of Keamy's mission, so I think they definitely want him put down." [...] Following the season's conclusion, Durand stated {{that he would not be}} surprised if his character returned in the fifth season and concluding that [...] "Lost was really fun.

2500|$|Time {{and memory}} have {{regularly}} {{been identified as}} two of the principal themes of Resnais's work, at least in his earlier films.

What interests me in the mind is that faculty we have to imagine what is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> our heads, or to remember what has happened".

5000|$|Pessimism is {{a mental}} attitude. Pessimists {{anticipate}} undesirable outcomes from {{a given situation}} which is generally referred to as situational pessimism or believes that undesirable things are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> them <b>in</b> life more than desirable ones. Pessimists also {{tend to focus on}} the negatives of life in general or a given situation. The most common example of this phenomenon is the [...] "Is the glass half empty or half full?"

Throughout history, the pessimistic disposition has had effects on all major areas of thinking.|$|R

2500|$|Later in 1967, as {{a direct}} {{reaction}} to Seale's realistic production, Gerald Freedman directed a performance for Joseph Papp's Shakespeare Festival at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park, Manhattan, starring Jack Hollander as Titus, Olympia Dukakis as Tamora, Moses Gunn as Aaron and Erin Martin as Lavinia. Freedman had seen Seale's production and felt it failed because it worked by [...] "bringing into play our sense of reality in terms of detail and literal time structure." [...] He argued that when presented realistically, the play simply doesn't work, as it raises too many practical question, such as why does Lavinia not bleed to death, why does Marcus not {{take her to the}} hospital immediately, why does Tamora not notice that the pie tastes unusual, exactly how do both Martius and Quintus manage to fall into a hole? Freedman argued that [...] "if one wants to create a fresh emotional response to the violence, blood and multiple mutilations of Titus Andronicus, one must shock the imagination and subconscious with visual images that recall the richness and depth of primitive rituals." [...] As such, the costumes were purposely designed to represent no particular time or place but were instead based on those of the Byzantine Empire and Feudal Japan. Additionally, the violence was stylised; instead of swords and daggers, wands were used and no contact was ever made. The colour scheme was hallucinatory, changing mid-scene. Characters wore classic masks of comedy and tragedy. The slaughter in the final scene was accomplished symbolically by having each character wrapped in a red robe as they died. A narrator was also used (played by Charles Dance), who, prior to each act, would announce what was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> the upcoming act, thus undercutting any sense of realism. The production received generally positive reviews, with Mildred Kuner arguing [...] "Symbolism rather than gory realism was what made this production so stunning." ...|$|E

50|$|Using {{tap water}} (whether {{straight}} from the tap or filtered first) is {{generally considered to be}} better for one's environmental impact than habitually drinking bottled water, because the bottling and distribution of bottled water consumes resources and produces emissions (electricity and oil to make the bottles, diesel fuel to truck the filled bottles through the supply chain, truck exhaust, powerplant emissions, bottle recycling, and so on).
