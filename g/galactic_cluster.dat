5|$|Most {{galaxies in}} the Universe are gravitationally bound {{to a number of}} other galaxies. These form a fractal-like {{hierarchical}} distribution of clustered structures, with the smallest such associations being termed groups. A group of galaxies is {{the most common type of}} <b>galactic</b> <b>cluster,</b> and these formations contain a majority of the galaxies (as well as most of the baryonic mass) in the Universe. To remain gravitationally bound to such a group, each member galaxy must have a sufficiently low velocity to prevent it from escaping (see Virial theorem). If there is insufficient kinetic energy, however, the group may evolve into a smaller number of galaxies through mergers.|$|E

50|$|Many {{of these}} have been {{developed}} recently. For those theories that aim to replace dark matter, the galaxy rotation curve, the Tully-Fisher relation, the faster rotation rate of dwarf galaxies, and the gravitational lensing due to <b>galactic</b> <b>clusters</b> act as constraints.|$|R
40|$|The {{rotational}} velocity curves for clusters of galaxies cannot {{be explained by}} Newtonian gravitation using the baryonic mass nor does MOND succeed in reducing this discrepancy to acceptable differences. The dark matter hypothesis appears to offer a solution; however, non-baryonic dark matter has never been detected. As an alternative approach, quantum celestial mechanics (QCM) predicts that <b>galactic</b> <b>clusters</b> are in quantization states determined solely by the total baryonic mass of the cluster and its total angular momentum. We find excellent agreement with QCM for ten <b>galactic</b> <b>clusters,</b> demonstrating that dark matter is not needed to explain the rotation velocities and providing further support to the hypothesis that all gravitationally bound systems have QCM quantization states...|$|R
2500|$|In 2012, she {{published}} her {{findings from}} a study into the evolution of stars within galaxies which themselves are members of galaxy clusters, using the Gemini North Observatory in Hawaii. [...] The research found that a galaxy's position within the <b>galactic</b> <b>cluster</b> affected stellar evolution within that galaxy: the closer a galaxy is {{to the center of}} a cluster, the sooner it stops forming new stars. The interpretation of this is that near the centre of the cluster, the large number of close galactic neighbours influence each other through gravitation to produce a sea of hot gas, and that hot gas seems to be the limiting factor that constrains new star formation. Mergers of galaxies also play a part: her forecasts of how our own Milky Way galaxy will merge with the Andromeda Galaxy and the two smaller Magellanic Cloud galaxies in several billion years have prompted further new studies into how that will affect the rates of star formation locally.|$|E

40|$|We present {{absorption}} line indices {{measured in the}} integrated spectra of globular clusters both from the Galaxy and from M 31. Our samples include 41 <b>Galactic</b> globular <b>clusters,</b> and more than 300 clusters in M 31. The conversion of instrumental equivalent widths into the Lick system is described, and zero-point uncertainties are provided. Comparison of line indices of old M 31 <b>clusters</b> and <b>Galactic</b> globular <b>clusters</b> suggests an absence of important differences in chemical composition between the two cluster systems. In particular, CN indices in the spectra of M 31 and <b>Galactic</b> <b>clusters</b> are essentially consistent with each other, in disagreement with several previous works. We reanalyze some of the previous data, and conclude that reported CN differences between M 31 and <b>Galactic</b> <b>clusters</b> were mostly due to data calibration uncertainties.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we present {{theoretical}} simulations concerning the luminosity function of cluster WDs, computed under various assumptions about cluster age and IMF. Quantitative evaluations are discussed, {{showing that the}} WD cooling sequence {{can be divided into}} a portion at large luminosity where the distribution depends on cooling times only, and a narrow interval of luminosities {{at the bottom of the}} sequence that gives information about both cluster age and IMF. Detailed theoretical predictions are reported for a range of cluster ages covering the current estimates for the ages of globular and old <b>galactic</b> <b>clusters,</b> discussing theoretical expectations concerning the number ratio of WD to HB stars as a function of both cluster age and IMF.
