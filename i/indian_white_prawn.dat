40|$|This study {{investigated}} changes in landings of all <b>prawns,</b> <b>white</b> <b>prawns</b> (mainly Penaeus merguiensis), mangrove extent, rainfall {{and the area}} of shallow water in western peninsular Malaysia. The most important state for both the landings of all <b>prawns</b> and <b>white</b> <b>prawns</b> was Perak where about 50 % of all prawns and 35 % of <b>white</b> <b>prawns</b> were landed. This is also the state with the largest, and most stable, extent of mangrove forest reserve (40 000 ha) and the largest area of shallow water (< 5 m deep). Juvenile prawns from Perak {{may contribute to the}} landings of the nearby, adjacent states of Penang and Selangor, where the second highest landings for <b>white</b> <b>prawns</b> and total prawns, respectively, were found. The area of shallow water accounted for the greatest proportion of variation in landings of both all <b>prawns</b> and <b>white</b> <b>prawns,</b> and was the most significant variable fitted to multiple regressions of landings and coastal attributes (area of shallow water, mangrove area, length of coastline). Although there was a significant linear relationship between the landings of total prawns and mangrove area in both the 1980 s and 1990 s, {{this was not the case}} for the mangrove-dependent <b>white</b> <b>prawns</b> where a significant relationship was found only for the 1990 s. Furthermore, landings of all <b>prawns</b> and <b>white</b> <b>prawns</b> in Selangor and Johor, where large losses of mangrove forest reserve have been recorded, appear to have been maintained or increased in the 1990 s. The lack of a clear relationship between mangrove loss and prawn landings may be due to the migration of prawns from adjacent areas or that other attributes of mangroves, such as the length of mangrove-water interface, may be more important for the growth and survival of prawn populations than total area of mangroves.

40|$|The {{collection}} of wild breeders of the <b>Indian</b> <b>white</b> <b>prawn</b> Fenneropenaeus indicus from two semi-industrial trawlers fishing in Maputo Bay is assessed {{for the period}} between August and November 1993. The daily mean catch (12 - 21 prawns dayˉ¹) increased until October but monthly yields {{were not significantly different}} (P> 0. 05). The monthly mean mortality ranged between 8 % and 20 % and was similar for males and females. More than 70 % of the catch comprised small (grade B 1 : 20 - 39 g) and medium size (grade B 2 : 40 - 59 g) prawns. While males were exclusively of grade B 1 (99 %), the females were predominantly of grades B 2 and B 3 (60 - 80 g). The {{collection of}} larger breeders (grade B 4 : > 80 g) was low and represented only 1 % of total catches and a maximum of 3 % of females. The net profit of breeders collection increased with size (grade) of prawns, and represented a maximum yield of 114 % for grade B 3. The added value of live prawns exceeded 450 % of the cost to the fisherman, but decreased with size of breeders.

The control and regulation of ovarian maturation by neurosecretory {{elements in the}} eyestalk, brain and thoracic ganglia of Penaeus indicus have been examined. In the X-organ complex of the eyestalk, secretions from type A and B cells are apparently involved in inhibiting ovarian maturation, while {{in the brain and}} thoracic ganglia, secretions from type GN, A and B ce!ls had a stimulatory effect on the ovary. The pyriform C cells were not involved with ovarian maturation. Both unilateral and bilateral eyestalk ablation resulted in precocious maturation of the ovary.

Abnormal behaviour was noticed in bilaterally ablated prawns and strangely few animals moulted with developing ovaries.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the marine {{environment}} in a subtropical estuary and particularly on exploring a suite of easy-to-use, cost effective and environmentally valid biological response tools (biomarkers). The main driving force of the thesis is {{the knowledge of the}} numerous anthropogenic impacts. Today, only scarce information is available in the Espírito Santo Estuary (ESE) in southern Mozambique on the effects of pollutants. Links between behavioural disruption and neurological dysfunction, such as acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition {{has been shown to be}} the most responsive biochemical biomarker at sites influenced by agricultural, urban and industrial activities. In Paper I, the enzymatic inhibition of AChE and butyrylcholineesterase (BChE) was measured in tissues (brain, liver and hepatopancreas) from barred mudskipper fish (Periophthalmus argentilineatus), Jarbua fish (Terapon jarbua), <b>Indian</b> <b>white</b> <b>prawn</b> (Penaeus indicus) and the clam Meretrix meretrix. In general, all species showed a significant decrease in the enzymatic activities. For M. meretrix the inhibition of BChE was most evident. In water of the Infulene River, tributary of ESE, 12 pesticides were found. Besides the contaminants having a direct effect on burrowing behaviour, they also cause a sublethal physiological stress, reducing metabolic activity, growth rate and reproduction. In Paper II, integrated physiological assays were applied by using the scope for growth (SFG) method and condition index (CI) as tools for assessing the metabolic state in M. meretrix from the ESE and Incomati estuary (which is used as a comparison site). Low values of SFG (< 5 J h− 1 g− 1), as well as the low CI (that ranged from 0. 80 ± 0. 02 to 1. 62 ± 0. 10) in both investigated areas show symptoms of stress and impact of pollution as reflected in the clam M. meretrix. These results also show that SFG can be used as a tool to compare bioenergetic responses of clams to impacts of various environmental pollutants. Locomotion is the most studied behaviour because it links fitness-related parameters, such as food seeking and predator avoidance and is also considered as an ecologically valuable individual biomarker of stress. In Paper III, the impaired burrowing activity as a signal of organismal behaviour was tested in two cross-toxicity assays using the clam M. meretrix (bivalvia, family Veneridae). Metals in sediments and clams were also analysed to assess the sediment quality according to international guidelines and human safety for clam consumption and. The burrowing times were different in the two experiments. This finding indicated that the metal contaminated sediments delayed the burrowing time. Based on the concentrations of metals in sediments we concluded that the northern margin of ESE is polluted principally by Cu, Ni, Cd, Co, Cr, Zn, As and Hg. As expected, sediment from the comparison site and those at the southern margin of ESE contained lower levels of these metals. Paper IV presents the more ecologically relevant aspects of the adverse effects of pollutants on benthic communities in ESE and the nearby Incomati estuary. Community indicators, such as species richness, species diversity (H’), evenness (J), dominance, similarity and abundance were used in association with multivariate analyses of assemblage structure to assess the environmental status in three zones (i. e. the upper, middle and lower reaches) of ESE. Ecological groups and ranking of feeding strategies of benthic macrofauna were also used as bioindicators. The results showed clear differences in invertebrate density and population structure between ESE and the comparison estuary, while the three zones in ESE showed negligible differences from each other. The difference between the two estuaries was mainly due to the dominance of distinguished macrobenthic groups; polychaetes were common in ESE, while bivalves and amphipods were highly abundant. in the Incomati estuary. It is recognized that the need of integrative tools to assess ecosystem quality is very important from a scientific point of view, but simple and pragmatic information is also necessary for stakeholders and society to get useful assessments of the impact of human pressure in the estuaries and other coastal ecosystems.
