50|$|In {{aircraft}} design, Dutch roll {{results from}} relatively weaker positive directional stability {{as opposed to}} positive lateral stability. When an aircraft rolls around the longitudinal axis, a sideslip is introduced into the relative wind in the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rolling</b> motion. Strong lateral stability begins to restore the aircraft to level flight. At the same time, somewhat weaker directional stability attempts to correct the sideslip by aligning the aircraft with the perceived relative wind. Since directional stability is weaker than lateral stability for the particular aircraft, the restoring yaw motion lags significantly behind the restoring roll motion. The aircraft passes through level flight as the yawing motion is continuing in the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> the original roll.

40|$|The {{aerodynamics}} of thin, flat-plate {{wings of}} various planforms (rectangular, elliptical and Zimmerman) {{have been studied}} in free-to-roll experiments in a wind tunnel. Non-zero trim angles at low angles of attack, self-induced roll oscillations with increasing angle of attack and even autorotation in some cases were observed. The rectangular wings with round leading-edge had non-zero trim angles at low incidences due to the asymmetric development of the three-dimensional separation bubble at these low Reynolds numbers. With increasing angle of attack, the bubble increases in length and once reattachment is lost, large amplitude roll oscillations develop. The Strouhal number of the roll oscillations is {{of the order of}} 10 (- 2), which is in the same range as those expected for small aircraft experiencing atmospheric gusts. Velocity measurements revealed that variations in the strength of the vortices drove the rolling motion.

40|$|We study 2 -field {{inflation}} models {{based on}} the "large-volume" flux compactification of type IIB string theory. The role of the inflaton is played by a Kähler modulus τ corresponding to a 4 -cycle volume and its axionic partner θ. The freedom associated with the choice of Calabi Yau manifold and the non-perturbative effects defining the potential V(τ, θ) and kinetic parameters of the moduli bring an unavoidable statistical element to theory prior probabilities within the low energy landscape. The further randomness of (τ, θ) initial conditions allows for a large ensemble of trajectories. Features in the ensemble of histories include "roulette tractories", with long-lasting inflations in the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rolling</b> axion, enhanced in number of e-foldings over those restricted to lie in the τ-trough. Asymptotic flatness of the potential makes possible an eternal stochastic self-reproducing inflation.

40|$|Use of a {{high power}} Yb:YAG laser is {{investigated}} for joining advanced high strength steel materials for use in tailor-welded blank (TWB) applications. TWB 2 ̆ 7 s are materials of different chemistry, coating or thicknesses that are joined before metal forming and other operations such as trimming, assembly and painting are carried out. TWB is becoming an important design tool in the automotive industry for reducing weight, improving fuel economy and passenger safety, while reducing the overall costs for the customer. Three advanced high strength steels, TRIP 780, DP 980 and USIBOR, which have many unique properties that are conducive to achieving these objectives, along with mild steel, are used in this work. The objective of this work {{is to ensure that}} high quality welds can be obtained using Yb:YAG lasers which are also becoming popular for metal joining operations, since they produce high quality laser beams that suffer minimal distortion when transported via fiber optic cables. Various power levels and speeds for the laser beam were used during the investigation. Argon gas was consistently used for shielding purposes during the welding process. After the samples were welded, metallographic examination of the fusion and heat-affected zones using optical and scanning electron microscopes were carried out to determine the microstructures as well as weld defects. Optical and scanning electron microscopes were also used to examine the top of welds as well as fracture surfaces. Additionally, cross-weld microhardness evaluations, tensile tests using Instron tester, limited fatigue tests as well as formability evaluations using OSU plane strain evaluation were carried out. The examinations included a 2 -factor full factorial design of experiments to determine the impact of coatings on the surface roughness {{on the top of the}} welds. Tensile strengths of DP 980, TRIP 780 and mild steel materials as well as DP 980 welded to TRIP 780 and mild steel in the rolling direction as well as transverse direction were evaluated. Metallographic examinations determined that most of the fusion zone is martensitic with small regions of bainite and ferrite. High microhardness values of the order of 550 - 600 Hv were noted in most joints, which are attributed to high alloy content of the fusion zone as well as high rates of cooling typical of laser welds. During tensile, fatigue and formability tests, no fractures in the fusion or heat affected zones were observed. Geometric variability evaluations indicated that coatings such as aluminum (in the case of USIBOR) and galvanized zinc (TRIP 780) can affect the variability of the weld zone and the surface roughness on the top of the weld. Excessive variability in the form of weld concavity in the weld zones can lead to fractures in the weld region, even though higher hardness can, to some extent, compensate for these surface irregularities. The 2 -factor design of experiments further confirmed that coatings adversely affect the surface roughness on the top of the welds. Although thickness differentials alone do not make a significant impact on surface roughness, together with coatings, they can have an adverse effect on roughness. Tensile tests in the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>rolling</b> as well as in the transverse direction indicate that TRIP 780 seems weaker in the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>rolling</b> when compared to transverse direction while mild steel is stronger in the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>rolling.</b> Weldability analyses revealed that the typical melting efficiency is on the order of 50 - 70...|$|E

Strengthenings and weakenings were studied with respect to the angle they form with the loaded edge.
