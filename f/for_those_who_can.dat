Gender dysphoria is officially recognized in Iran today, and the Judiciary permits sexual reassignment surgery <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> afford it. In the early 1960s, Ayatollah Khomeini had issued a ruling permitting gender reassignment, which has since been reconfirmed by Ayatollah Khamenei.|$|E
