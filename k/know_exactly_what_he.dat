5|$|As {{the senator}} {{discussed}} their finances, the telecast again showed Pat Nixon, fixedly watching her husband. Pat Nixon later stated that her rapt gaze {{was because she}} did not <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> would say, and wanted to hear. Nixon detailed their assets and liabilities: the mortgaged home in Washington; the similarly mortgaged home in California, then occupied by his parents. The loans from his parents and from Riggs Bank. The borrowed-against life insurance policy on the senator; no insurance on his wife or children. The two-year-old Oldsmobile and the family furniture, and {{that he and his wife}} owned no stocks or bonds.|$|E
500|$|Scott {{chose not}} to show the full Alien {{for most of the}} film, keeping most of its body in shadow {{in order to create a}} sense of terror and heighten suspense. The {{audience}} could thus project their own fears into imagining what the rest of the creature might look like: [...] "Every movement is going to be very slow, very graceful, and the Alien will alter shape so you never really <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> looks like." [...] The Alien has been referred to as [...] "one of the most iconic movie monsters in film history", and its biomechanical appearance and sexual overtones have been frequently noted. Roger Ebert remarked that [...] "Alien uses a tricky device to keep the alien fresh throughout the movie: It evolves the nature and appearance of the creature, so we never know quite what it looks like or what it can do...The first time we get a good look at the alien, as it bursts from the chest of poor Kane (John Hurt). It is unmistakably phallic in shape, and the critic Tim Dirks mentions its 'open, dripping vaginal mouth.|$|E
2500|$|On March 17, 2007, Plame {{testified before}} the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. She was asked how she learned of Novak's {{reference}} to her in his column. Plame told the committee [...] "I found out {{very early in the}} morning when my husband came in and dropped the newspaper on the bed and said, 'He did it'.... We had indications in the week prior that Mr. Novak knew my identity and my true employer. And I of course alerted my superiors at the agency, and I was told, don't worry; we'll take care of it. And it was much to our surprise that we read about this July 14.... I believe, and this is what I've read, that the then-spokesman, Mr. Harlow, spoke directly with Mr. Novak and said something along the lines of, don't go with this; don't do this. I don't <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> said, but he clearly communicated the message that Mr. Novak should not publish my name." ...|$|E
60|$|Sam <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> meant, {{but he kept}} on a look of earnest {{and desperate}} simplicity.|$|R
5000|$|Arthur Hiller was calm, {{quiet and}} <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wanted. He {{never told you}} <b>what</b> to do. <b>He</b> took <b>what</b> you had and very gently focused it. It was such a joy to work with him. actress Jean Byron ...|$|R
50|$|Punkaj Kalraa as Khanna is a ‘know it all-have it all’ Bollywood Biggie. Khanna {{is a smart}} film Director and Producer who <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wants.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I don't <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> says. He told me {{he would}} {{introduce}} me to you, and that you would, he was sure, do your best to put me through." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And Mr. Vavasour {{to perform}} the {{principal}} part,' said Mrs. Coningsby. 'I <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> means. He wants to dance the polka as Petrarch, and find a Laura in every partner.' ...|$|E
60|$|I did not <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> {{had meant}} by his benches; till, shortly after, I overheard {{two of the}} sailors debating, whether mankind would stand or sit at the Last Day.|$|E
60|$|Mose said nothing. He had the {{indifferent}} {{air of a}} man who {{had been}} often to the great metropolis and <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wished to do.|$|R
6000|$|Ben {{looked at}} him for a moment, as if he doubted whether the boy <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was talking about, and then said, [...] "So you still want to go home, do you?" ...|$|R
50|$|He {{is remembered}} as being {{thoroughly}} courageous without being reckless, and {{was successful in}} his amazing feats because he was practically faultless as a pilot, and <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> and his machines could do.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{need not}} have any scruples on Felix's account, Alda; I <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> has done.' I {{want you to tell}} me what is being said-- or you have allowed to be said--about it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|He was sadly {{at a loss}} to <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> {{ought to}} do, but urged Teenie to go in search of Carrots; and when that young gentleman had {{departed}} at full speed he muttered to himself: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should like}} to <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> did see;--whether it was a limb or a bit of his coat. But I think that young lady crept out and saw him {{cleaning}} his pistol. And I think that the old lady had {{a glimpse of the}} mask. I think that they can be made to say so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, never mind; I wish I knew it all," [...] {{answered}} another. [...] "I guess <b>he</b> knows <b>what</b> <b>he</b> is doing." [...] And in this he was right; Theodore Roosevelt <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> {{was trying}} to accomplish.|$|R
6000|$|... "He'll be killed!" [...] cried {{many of the}} ladies. [...] "The horse {{will have}} him under in another moment." [...] But such fears were groundless. Darnell <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was doing, {{and in the end}} the fiery steed had to give in, {{completely}} conquered.|$|R
60|$|Torches in hand, Dave and White Buffalo {{moved forward}} slowly. But the Indian <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was doing, {{and soon he}} and the youth with him were {{at the bottom of}} the hollow in safety. Then Dave ran forward to greet his cousin.|$|R
6000|$|One {{day there}} came into our home {{a strange man}} who spoke in a fashion new to me. He was a middle-aged rather formal individual, dressed in a rough gray suit, and father alluded to him privately as [...] "that English duke." [...] I didn't <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> meant by this, but our visitor's talk gave me a vague notion of [...] "the old country." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{person who}} first {{suggested}} this travelling plan was our old physician, Dr. Mathews. I don't <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> said about it, but I knew he thought I {{had been studying}} too hard, and needed to [...] "let up" [...] for a while. And I'm sure, too, that he was quite positive that I would have no let up as long as I staid in the same town with the professor.|$|E
60|$|He did n't <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> {{meant to}} do, {{but it had}} {{suddenly}} come over him, that he was hiding from the storm, and letting his father meet it alone; for the old man went to his office every day with the regularity of a machine, that would go its usual round until it stopped, while the young man stayed {{at home with the}} women, and let his mother comfort him.|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile Ruby buffeted the billows manfully. He {{was fully}} alive {{to the extreme}} danger of the attempt, but <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> meant to do. He trusted to his {{intimate}} knowledge of every ledge and channel and current, and had calculated his motions to a nicety.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh capitally," [...] said Mr Egerton. [...] "He {{has very}} seldom spoken before and always {{slightly}} though well. He was listened to with mute attention; {{never was a}} better house. I should say made a great impression, though no one <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was after." ...|$|R
50|$|Both sides mistake him {{for someone}} else—an American assassin—and neither side can {{understand}} why Carr is ignoring them. The CIA {{take it as a}} sign of defiance, the Associates perceive him as a cool and collected professional, who <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he's</b> doing and is difficult to predict.|$|R
6000|$|Again {{the woman}} {{appeared}} to reflect [...] "Prosperity {{is apt to}} kill romance," [...] she said. [...] "One is never quite content, you know, and I feel now and then that Shafton scarcely understands me. That is a complaint people appear to find ludicrous, of course, though I really don't see why they should do so. Shafton is conventional and precise. You <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> is going to do, {{and that it will}} be right, but one has longings now and then for something original and intense." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] thought Mrs. Blyth, nodding, to {{show that}} she {{understood}} the signs--"Ah! there's father. I felt sure {{he would be the}} first; and I <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> will do when he gets in. He will admire the pictures more than anybody, and have a better opinion to give of them than anybody else has; but before he can mention a word of it to Valentine, there will be dozens of people in the painting-room, and then he will get taken suddenly nervous, and come up here to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nor do I,--if I mean to {{criminate}} him too. My {{object is}} to let him off. But to enable {{us to do that}} we must <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> knew and what he had done. Shall I tell you what occurred to me when you shook the will out of the book? How would it be if he declared that we had brought it with us? If he had been sharp enough for that, the very fact of our having gone to the book at once would have been evidence against us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is possible," [...] {{continued}} Savine. [...] "One {{notices that}} the man who <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wants and doesn't fool his time away over other things not infrequently gets it. You have not really surprised me. Now--and I want a straight answer--why did you leave the Old Country?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Billy Joel {{captured}} the major images, events, and personalities of this half-century in a three-minute song.... It was pure information overload, {{a song that}} assumed we <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was singing about...What was truly alarming was the realization that we, the listeners, {{for the most part}} understood the references.|$|R
5000|$|He found that, {{when the}} {{appellant}} committed the offence, <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was doing, but accepted in his favour {{that at the}} time he had been intoxicated to some extent. The magistrate took into account the circumstances which prevailed when the appellant committed the offence, addressing the appellant thus: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We shall {{probably}} {{never know how}} much {{he has been in}} love with her, nor what difference it makes. We shall never <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> came back for, nor why he couldn't stand it out there any longer without relief, nor why he scrambled down here all but straight from the station, nor why after all, for the last two hours, he has been roaming the streets. And it doesn't matter, for it's none of our business. But I'm sorry for him--she is going to be sublime," [...] Nick added. The curtain was rising on the tragic climax of the play.|$|E
60|$|Brooke {{realized}} that the warning was probably warranted, but he stood still, stiffening his grasp on the bar, for to vacate the position {{was the last thing}} he contemplated. Barbara Heathcote was in the ranch, and he did not remember that she had also two companions then. Nor did he <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> meant to do, that is, while the stranger eyed him with the same unpleasant steadiness, for it was evident that a very slight contraction of his forefinger would effectually prevent him doing anything. Then while they stood watching each other breathlessly for a second or two a door handle rattled and Brooke heard a rustle of draperies.|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear child, he {{has promised}} ME awfully; I mean lots of things, and not in every case kept his promise to the letter." [...] Mrs. Beale's good humour insisted on taking for granted Mrs. Wix's, to whom her {{attention}} had suddenly grown prodigious. [...] "I dare say he has done the same with you, and not always come to time. But he makes it up in his own way--and it isn't as if we didn't <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> is. There's one thing he is," [...] she went on, [...] "which makes everything else only a question, for us, of tact." [...] They scarce had time to wonder what this was before, as they might have said, it flew straight into their face. [...] "He's as free as I am!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Writing in The New York Times, Gerald Jonas {{noted that}} while the anthology's {{contents}} contradicted its subtitle, being mostly satires and dystopias, [...] "Disch <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> is doing: he points out in a brief introduction that prescriptive Utopias tend {{to be not only}} dull but also silly and repugnant." ...|$|R
60|$|Dick {{began his}} {{punching}} exercise slowly, {{for he had}} not tried it for some time, and was afraid {{he was a little}} stiff. But, it may be added here, there was a punching bag in the barn at the Rovers' farm, so the youth <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was doing.|$|R
5000|$|... "My {{favorite}} was Stanislas Idzikowski, affectionately known as Idzi, a brilliant dancer {{who had been}} with the Diaghilev Ballet. He was diminutive, dapper, and precise, speaking rather good English with a clipped Polish accent. Severe but never unkind, <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> expected of his students and explained clearly how to achieve it." ...|$|R
