5|$|Despite Hong Kong's {{reputation}} of being intensely urbanised, the territory has tried to promote a green environment, and recent <b>growing</b> <b>public</b> concern has prompted the severe restriction of further land reclamation from Victoria Harbour. Awareness of the environment is growing as Hong Kong suffers from increasing pollution compounded by its geography and tall buildings. Approximately 80% of the city's smog originates {{from other parts of}} the Pearl River Delta.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{strictly}} Protestant James I {{wished to}} end the practice, he found himself having to touch {{an increasing number of}} people. The practice spread to Scotland, where James reigned as well as resided before the Union of the Crowns; the Scots started believing that their king, now also king of England, possessed the ability to heal them. Charles I (r. 1625–1649) issued plenty of edicts in an attempt to restrain the <b>growing</b> <b>public</b> demand. On 27 December 1633, he touched 100 people at Holyrood Palace.|$|E

5|$|The Superliner I cars stored {{waste in}} onboard {{retention}} tanks, but then macerated and dumped {{it along the}} tracks once the train had attained a preset speed. This was an improvement on the Hi-Levels, which dumped directly to the tracks. <b>Growing</b> <b>public</b> concern about such dumping led {{to the adoption of}} a full-retention system in the Superliner IIs. They were the first long-distance cars with such a system. The Superliner I cars were retrofitted with a full-retention system in the early 1990s.|$|E
5|$|The {{last year}} of Schubert's life was marked by <b>growing</b> <b>public</b> acclaim for the composer's works, {{but also by the}} gradual {{deterioration}} of his health. On March 26, 1828, together with other musicians in Vienna, Schubert gave a public concert of his own works, which was a great success and earned him a considerable profit. In addition, two new German publishers took an interest in his works, leading to a short period of financial well-being. However, by the time the summer months arrived, Schubert was again short of money and had to cancel some journeys he had previously planned.|$|E
5|$|There {{was also}} a <b>growing</b> <b>public</b> {{awareness}} in the U.S. of military activities in Laos. During October 1969, Senator Stuart Symington (D-MO) chaired hearings of the Subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Security Agreements and Commitments Abroad. The testimony of subpoenaed witnesses revealed the history of U.S. involvement in the covert commitment to Laos. Due to the closed nature of the sessions and its heavily censored transcript, however, {{the nature and extent}} of that commitment was still very little understood by the American public.|$|E

5|$|Michael {{and other}} members of the {{imperial}} family, including Grand Dukes Alexander, George, Nicholas and Dmitri and Grand Duchess Elizabeth, warned of the <b>growing</b> <b>public</b> unrest, and of the perception that Nicholas was governed by his German-born wife Alexandra and the self-styled holy man Rasputin. Nicholas and Alexandra refused to listen. In December 1916, Dmitri and four of his friends killed Rasputin. Michael learned of the murder at Brasovo, where he was spending Christmas with his family. On 28 December, according to the French ambassador, there was a failed attempt to assassinate Alexandra; the lone assailant was caught and hanged the next day. The Duma President Mikhail Rodzianko, Grand Duchess Marie Pavlovna and British ambassador Buchanan joined calls for Alexandra to be removed from influence, but Nicholas still refused to take their advice. Plots and gossip against Nicholas and Alexandra continued to build.|$|E
5|$|The St. Johns River {{is under}} {{consideration}} {{as an additional}} water source to meet <b>growing</b> <b>public</b> water needs. In 2008, the river's Water Management District undertook a Water Supply Impact Study of the proposed water withdrawals and asked the National Research Council to review science aspects of the study as it progressed. This resulted {{in a series of}} four reports that assessed the impact of water withdrawal on river level and flow, reviewed potential impacts on wetland ecosystems, and presented overall perspectives on the Water Management District study. The National Research Council found that, overall, the District performed a competent job in relating predicted environmental responses, including their magnitude and general degree of uncertainty, to the proposed range of water withdrawals. However, the report noted that the District's final report should acknowledge such critical issues as include future sea-level rises, population growth, and urban development. Although the District predicted that changes in water management would increase water levels and flows that exceed the proposed surface water withdrawals, these predictions have high uncertainties.|$|E

5|$|The {{first trial}} series {{consisted}} of three shots. All bombs were dropped and detonated over Malden Island, and exploded high in the atmosphere, rather than being detonated on the ground, {{in order to reduce}} the production of nuclear fallout. British scientists were aware that the Americans had been able to reduce fallout by obtaining most of the bomb yield from fusion instead of fission, but they did not yet know how to do this. Amid <b>growing</b> <b>public</b> concern about the dangers of fallout, particularly from strontium-90 entering the food chain, a committee chaired by Sir Harold Himsworth was asked to look into the matter. Another, in the United States chaired by Detlev Bronk, also investigated. They reported simultaneously on 12 June 1956. While differing on many points, they agreed that levels of strontium-90 were not yet sufficiently high to be of concern.|$|E
5|$|The reforms, {{combined}} with unprecedented amounts of funding from foreign loans, spurred rapid economic growth; but this growth was punctuated by sharp recessions and financial crises in 1994, 1999 (following the earthquake of that year), and 2001; {{resulting in an}} average of 4 percent GDP growth per annum between 1981 and 2003. Lack of additional fiscal reforms, {{combined with}} large and <b>growing</b> <b>public</b> sector deficits and widespread corruption, resulted in high inflation, a weak banking sector and increased macroeconomic volatility. Since the economic crisis of 2001 and the reforms initiated by the finance minister of the time, Kemal Derviş, inflation has dropped to single-digit figures {{for the first time}} in decades (8% in 2005), investor confidence and foreign investment have soared, and unemployment has fallen (10% in 2005).|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, <b>growing</b> <b>public</b> {{opposition}} to the removal of feral horses prompted management strategy changes, and today the herds within the Theodore Roosevelt National Park are managed {{for the purposes of}} historical demonstration. However, in 1986 the park added outside bloodlines with the aim of modifying the appearance of the Nokota. Park management felt that the horses created with the outside bloodlines would sell better at subsequent auctions. The dominant herd stallions were removed and replaced with two feral stallions from Bureau of Land Management Mustang herds, a crossbred Shire stallion, a Quarter Horse stallion and an Arabian stallion. At {{the same time that the}} stallion replacements took place, a large number of horses from the park were rounded up and sold. At the 1986 auction, concerned about the welfare of the Nokota horse, Leo and Frank Kuntz purchased 54 horses, including the dominant stallion, a blue roan. This was in addition to smaller numbers of horses purchased in 1981, 1991 and 1997. After researching the history of the breed, the Kuntzs stated that they had found evidence that the horses in the park were probably related to the remaining horses from the band of 250 Sitting Bull horses, who had been range-bred by the Marquis de Mores, who founded the town of Medora. However, the short-lived Nokota Horse Association claimed that there was no evidence for this claim.|$|E

Journal articles and trade publications encourage academics to introduce blogging in the classroom; however few examples outline the opportunities and challenges that instructors may face during blogging assignments. Using a case study methodology, this paper reports on the professional and personal concerns that students (n = 28) expressed during and after a six-week blog management assignment at a large journalism college in the United States. An awareness of these concerns can prepare other public relations educators for what they may encounter while teaching blogging...|$|R
