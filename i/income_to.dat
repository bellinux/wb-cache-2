5|$|Although Kuala Lumpur is {{touted as}} one of the host cities for the Formula One World Championship, the open-wheel auto racing A1 Grand Prix and the Motorcycle Grand Prix, races are held at the Sepang International Circuit in Sepang in the {{neighbouring}} state of Selangor. The Formula One event contributes significantly to tourist arrivals and tourism <b>income</b> <b>to</b> Kuala Lumpur. This was evident during the Asian financial crisis in 1998. Despite cities around Asia suffering declining tourist arrivals, Kuala Lumpur tourist arrivals increased from 6,210,900 in 1997 to 10,221,600 in 2000, or 64.6% increase in tourist arrivals. In 2015, the Kuala Lumpur Street Circuit was constructed to host the Kuala Lumpur City Grand Prix motor racing event.|$|E

A variety of species remain {{important}} sources of edible oil, thatch, edible seeds and fibre. The leaves of Attalea butyracea and A.maripa are used extensively for thatching. Several species are oil palms, with A.speciosa among the most important economically. Products extracted from A.speciosa were reported to support over 300,000 households in the Brazilian state of Maranhão in 2005, and in 1985 it was estimated to support over 450,000 households throughout the Brazil. Piassava fibres, extracted from the leaf bases of A.funifera, are commercially important, and generated about US$20 million in annual <b>income</b> <b>to</b> Brazilian farmers in 1996.|$|E

Criticism targeted the game's lack of documentation, which some reviewers found made it harder to learn how to play the game. The in-game speed was also criticized for being too slow, which was a crucial issue in the game because time must pass for the player to earn <b>income</b> <b>to</b> purchase new facilities.|$|E

Hannah, became president of the College. He began the largest expansion in the institution's history, {{with the help of the}} 1945 G.I. Bill, which helped World War II veterans to receive an education. One of Hannah's strategies was to build a new dormitory building, enroll enough students to fill it, and use the <b>income</b> <b>to</b> start construction on a new dormitory.

When the same {{situation}} arose two years later with Swindon Town, a two-legged match against that year's Coppa Italia winners, A.S. Roma, was organised by way of compensation. Following the popularity of that event, dubbed the Anglo-Italian League Cup, and as a way to generate <b>income</b> <b>to</b> pay players' wages during the extended close season caused by the 1970 FIFA World Cup, the first Anglo-Italian Cup was inaugurated in 1970.|$|E
5|$|Hughes disliked loans, so he {{financed the}} {{purchase}} {{and development of}} new properties primarily through real estate limited partnerships (RELPs). At first, Public Storage built warehouses and sold them to independent RELPs for a development fee. The company's own RELP, called Public Storage Partners Ltd, was formed in 1975 and closed its first deal for $3 million in investments two years later. Public Storage paid cash to acquire property and build a self-storage facility, then used the property's <b>income</b> <b>to</b> pay investors back and earn a portion as profit.

40|$|We study {{adaptation}} <b>to</b> <b>income</b> and <b>to</b> status using individual panel data on {{the happiness}} of 7812 people living in Germany from 1984 to 2000. Specifically, we estimate a "happiness equation" defined over several lags of income and status and compare the long-run effects. We can (cannot) reject the hypothesis of no adaptation <b>to</b> <b>income</b> (status) during the four years following an income (status) change. In the short-run (current year) a one standard deviation increase in status and 52 percent of one standard deviation in income are associated with similar increases in happiness. However 65 percent of the current year's impact of income on happiness is lost over the following four years whereas the impact of status remains intact, if anything growing over time. We also present different estimates of adaptation across sub-groups. For example, we find that those on the right (left) {{of the political spectrum}} adapt <b>to</b> status (<b>income)</b> but not <b>to</b> <b>income</b> (status). We can reject equal relative adaptation (<b>to</b> <b>income</b> versus status) for these two sub-groups. Happiness Psychology Adaptation <b>to</b> <b>income</b> Adaptation <b>to</b> status...|$|R

He concluded that poor people die younger. This extended into his study in 1829 that reasoned the cause for shorter heights in poorer people was the result of inadequate money to provide proper nutrition. Villermé's work on height is considered the first study in auxological epidemiology.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{there were}} few visible changes within the church. Tkach {{continued}} Armstrong's tradition of traveling abroad, although his emphasis was more on visiting church members and operations than on Armstrong's agenda of visiting world leaders to attempt to witness to them. The church entered a period of rapid growth {{during the early years}} of Tkach's administration. In fact, the membership peaked during his tenure at 126,800 members in 1988. The finances were stable, largely due to the church's teaching that members should tithe, giving a tenth of their gross <b>income</b> <b>to</b> the church. The church magazine, The Plain Truth, continued to serialize the final and most controversial book by Armstrong, Mystery of the Ages. Tkach also continued, at least in public, to promote the church's unique doctrines.|$|E

This is advantageous to a married couple with disparate <b>incomes.</b> <b>To</b> compensate for this, countries may provide a higher tax bracket for the averaged income of a married couple. While income averaging might still benefit a married couple with a stay-at-home spouse, such averaging would cause a married couple with roughly equal personal <b>incomes</b> <b>to</b> pay more total tax than they would as two single persons.

However, he did not seriously consider a career in the performing arts until 1991 when he was persuaded to try comedy while working as a barman at Melbourne's Castle Hotel.
