40|$|An {{embedded}} {{measurement system}} for foot orthosis during gait is proposed. Strain gauge sensors were {{mounted on a}} foot orthosis to give information about strain in the sagittal plane. The ankle angle of the orthosis was fixed and strain characteristics were therefore changed when walking on slopes. With a Fourier series representation of the strain during a gait cycle, <b>ground</b> <b>angle</b> at different walking speeds and inclinations could be estimated with similar accuracy as previous studies using kinematically based estimators. Furthermore, if {{the angle of the}} mechanical foot ankle was changed, the sensing technique still could estimate <b>ground</b> <b>angle</b> without need for recalibration as opposed to kinematical sensors. This indicates that embedded strain sensors can be used for online control of future orthoses with inclination adaptation.

40|$|AbstractThis study investigates an {{instability}} {{that was}} observed during high-speed taxi tests of an experimental flying-wing aircraft. In order {{to resolve the}} reason of instability and probable solution of it, the instability was reproduced in simulations. An analysis revealed the unique stability characteristics of this aircraft. This aircraft has a rigid connection between the nose wheel steering mechanism and an electric servo, which is different from aircraft with a conventional tricycle landing gear system. The analysis based on simulation results {{suggests that there are}} two reasons for the instability. The first reason is a reversal of the lateral velocity of the nose wheel. The second reason is that the moment about the center of gravity created by the lateral friction force from the nose wheel is larger than that from the lateral friction force from the main wheels. These problems were corrected by changing the <b>ground</b> pitch <b>angle.</b> Simulations show that reducing the <b>ground</b> pitch <b>angle</b> can eliminate the instability in high-speed taxi...|$|R

40|$|When {{walking on}} {{inclined}} ground the biological foot adjusts the ankle angle accordingly. Prosthetic foot users have often a {{limited range of}} motion in their ankle which makes walking on hills uncomfortable. This paper describes a system which can autonomously correct the ankle angle to the inclination. The <b>ground</b> <b>angle</b> is estimated using an accelerometer. The angle foot blade to heel is then adjusted with a DC-motor. Since the controller only activates the motor when the foot is lifted and thus not loaded, a small powered system can be used.

40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effect of ground tilt on the lower extremity muscle activity of stroke patients performing squat exercises. [Subjects] Fifteen hemiparetic patients volunteered to participate in this study. [Methods] The subjects performed squat exercises at three different ground tilt angles: 15 ° plantar flexion, a neutral position, and 15 ° dorsiflexion. A surface electromyogram (sEMG) was used to record the electromyographic activities of the leg extensor muscle in the vastus lateralis (VL), vastus medialis (VM), gastrocnemius lateralis (GL), and gastrocnemius medialis (GM). The sEMG activity was analyzed using a one-way repeated measures ANOVA and a post hoc Bonferroni correction. [Results] The results of this study are summa-rized as follows. Significant differences were noted for the VL and the GL when the angle of the ankle joint was between the 15 ° plantar flexion and neutral positions during squat exercises involving the VL and when the angle of the ankle joint was between the neutral position and 15 ° dorsiflexion during squat exercises involving the VM. [Conclusion] In this study, sEMG showed that the VL and GL changed significantly during squat exercises accord-ing to the <b>ground</b> tilt <b>angle</b> of hemiparetic patients. Therefore, squat exercises with different <b>ground</b> tilt <b>angles</b> can be used to improve VL and GL strength...|$|R

40|$|As {{satellites}} become smaller, cheaper, and {{quicker to}} manufacture, constellation systems {{will be an}} increasingly attractive means of meeting mission objectives. Optimizing satellite constellation geometries is therefore a topic of considerable interest. As constellation systems become more achievable, providing coverage to specific regions of the Earth will become more common place. Small countries or companies that are currently unable to afford large and expensive constellation systems will now, or in the near future, {{be able to afford}} their own constellation systems to meet their individual requirements for small coverage regions. The focus of this thesis was to optimize constellation geometries for small coverage regions with the constellation design limited between 1 - 6 satellites in a Walker-delta configuration, at an altitude of 200 - 1500 km, and to provide remote sensing coverage with a minimum <b>ground</b> elevation <b>angle</b> of 60 degrees. Few Pareto-frontiers have been developed and analyzed to show the tradeoffs among various performance metrics, especially for this type of constellation system. The performance metrics focus on geometric coverage and include revisit time, daily visibility time, constellation altitude, <b>ground</b> elevation <b>angle,</b> and the number of satellites. The objective space containing these performance metrics were characterized for 5 different regions at latitudes of 0, 22. 5, 45, 67. 5, and 90 degrees. In addition, the effect of minimum <b>ground</b> elevation <b>angle</b> was studied on the achievable performance of this type of constellation system. Finally, the traditional Walker-delta pattern constraint was relaxed to allow for asymmetrical designs. These designs were compared to see how the Walker-delta pattern performs compared to a more relaxed design space. The goal of this thesis was to provide both a framework as well as obtain and analyze Pareto-frontiers for constellation performance relating to small regional coverage LEO constellation systems. This work provided an in-depth analysis of the trends in both the design and objective space of the obtained Pareto-frontiers. A variation on the εNSGA-II algorithm was utilized along with a MATLAB/STK interface to produce these Pareto-frontiers. The εNSGA-II algorithm is an evolutionary algorithm that was developed by Kalyanmoy Deb to solve complex multi-objective optimization problems. The algorithm used in this study proved to be very efficient at obtaining various Pareto-frontiers. This study was also successful in characterizing the design and solution space surrounding small LEO remote sensing constellation systems providing small regional coverage...|$|R
