5|$|The Eagles' {{defense was}} ranked {{eighth in the}} nation in terms of total defense, {{allowing}} an average of 277 yards per game. The Eagles led the country in interceptions, recording 25 {{during the course of the}} regular season. The Eagles also were ranked among the top 10 in run defense, pass-efficiency defense, and No. 14 in scoring <b>defense.</b> <b>That</b> strong defensive effort was led by linebacker Mark Herzlich, who was selected as the ACC's defensive player of the year for the 2008 season. Herzlich led the Eagles in tackles with 98—fifth among all Division I players—and interceptions, with 6. He was forecast to be a key player during the ACC Championship Game. Defensive tackle B. J. Raji recorded 33 tackles (11 for loss) and a team-high 7 sacks, part of a <b>defense</b> <b>that</b> allowed an average of just 87.3 rushing yards per game.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 1950s, {{reflecting}} {{both the}} threat of possible invasion by the Soviet Union and the realities of nuclear warfare, Swiss military doctrine changed to that of a dynamic (mobile) <b>defense</b> <b>that</b> included missions for the Swiss Air Force outside of its territory, in order to defeat standoff attacks and nuclear threats, including the possibility of defensive employment of air-delivered nuclear weapons. However the inability to field an air force of sufficient capability to carry out such missions led to a return of traditional doctrine.|$|E

As a freshman, he recorded 48 tackles with 2.5 sacks and an interception. In his sophomore year, he added 31 tackles and 3.5 sacks while anchoring a Bulldog <b>defense</b> <b>that</b> ranked {{number one in the}} state in rushing defense and total defense. Mississippi Gulf Coast finished the season with a 12–0 season record and a NJCAA Co-National Championship. Cody was named to the NJCAA All-American first team.|$|E
5|$|Joseph M. Pettit became {{president}} of the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1972. During his 14-year tenure as president, Pettit was credited with turning Georgia Tech into a top-flight research institution. Pettit has also received credit for shifting Georgia Tech back to its roots with regards to providing assistance with economic development within the state of Georgia. In the decades known for the Vietnam War and the launch of Sputnik, research at Georgia Tech and the Georgia Tech Research Institute had become so tied with NASA and the Department of <b>Defense</b> <b>that</b> local industrial development had been largely forgotten.|$|E
5|$|On Carpenter's command, several massive volleys of aimed Spencer repeating rifles hit {{the front}} {{waves of the}} mounted Indians. The volleys {{decimated}} them as if hit by cannon filled with musket balls. A number of warriors, dismounted and using their ponies as bullet breaks, returned fire. Nearly all of these warriors died along with their ponies. Only three warriors made it to within fifty yards of the wagons before their demise. The Indians were so traumatized and demoralized by Carpenter's <b>defense</b> <b>that</b> they did not renew their attack.|$|E

5|$|Though its offense {{performed}} well, it was Virginia Tech's {{special teams}} and <b>defense</b> <b>that</b> earned it the win. Duane Brown's twin blocked kicks {{were the first}} blocks recorded in ACC Championship Game history and were the 116th and 117th blocked kicks recorded at Virginia Tech under head coach Frank Beamer. In addition to the blocks, Tech special teams excelled on punts and kickoffs. Tech punter Brent Bowden finished the day with seven punts {{for a total of}} 324yards. A 54-yard kick in the first quarter was the fourth-longest punt in ACC Championship Game history.|$|E
5|$|To defeat more {{powerful}} monsters and gain experience points efficiently, players can join a party. A regular party {{has room for}} six members. Like in many other games, a well-balanced party will consist of several archetypes- namely a healer, a tank (the party member with high <b>defense</b> <b>that</b> will be the main target of the monster), and the damage dealer. The enmity system comes into play heavily in parties, as players {{try to keep the}} monsters attention off fragile jobs and on the tanks. A well-balanced team working together {{is the only way to}} defeat many of the game's enemies.|$|E
5|$|Another <b>defense</b> <b>that</b> often uses {{color or}} shape to deceive {{potential}} enemies is mimicry. A number of longhorn beetles (family Cerambycidae) bear {{a striking resemblance}} to wasps, which helps them avoid predation even though the beetles are in fact harmless. Batesian and Müllerian mimicry complexes are commonly found in Lepidoptera. Genetic polymorphism and natural selection give rise to otherwise edible species (the mimic) gaining a survival advantage by resembling inedible species (the model). Such a mimicry complex is referred to as Batesian and is most commonly known by the mimicry by the limenitidine viceroy butterfly of the inedible danaine monarch. Later research has discovered that the viceroy is, in fact more toxic than the monarch and this resemblance should be considered as a case of Müllerian mimicry. In Müllerian mimicry, inedible species, usually within a taxonomic order, find it advantageous to resemble each other so as to reduce the sampling rate by predators who need to learn about the insects' inedibility. Taxa from the toxic genus Heliconius form one of the most well known Müllerian complexes.|$|E

5|$|At Denver, Manning again led three scoring {{drives in}} the fourth quarter in a 34–31 shootout win. He {{completed}} 32-of-39 passes for 345 yards and three touchdowns. Following a second straight season with a win at New England, then a home win against Buffalo, the Colts were the NFL's last unbeaten team at 9–0. Their first loss would come in Dallas. Plagued by a run <b>defense</b> <b>that</b> would allow over 100 yards in every game, the Colts were 11–4 heading into their final game. Against Miami, Manning threw for 282 yards, two touchdowns and rushed for another touchdown. The Colts won 27–22, were AFC South division champions, and clinched the third seed in the AFC playoffs. Manning was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week. He ended the regular season with 4,397 passing yards and a league-leading 31 touchdown passes. His passer rating (101.0) was the highest in the league for the third year in a row. Manning helped the offense set an NFL record for third down conversion rate in a season (56.1%).|$|E
5|$|For {{his second}} season, Munnerlyn {{moved up to}} {{starting}} right cornerback after Richard Marshall was not re-signed. In Week 3 against the Cincinnati Bengals, he snagged his first career interception against Carson Palmer. In his first {{start of the season}} in Week 12 against the Cleveland Browns, Munnerlyn stepped in front of a pass from Jake Delhomme intended for Mohamed Massaquoi to pick it off and return it 37 yards for the touchdown. He went on to start five of the last six games of the season for the Panthers. Playing in 16 games with five starts, Munnerlyn recorded 47 tackles and one forced fumble, tied for second on the team with three interceptions (including one returned for a touchdown) and ranked first with 10 passes defensed, contributing to a Panthers <b>defense</b> <b>that</b> ranked seventh in the NFL in average yards per play. He also led the Panthers with a 10.9-yard punt return average on 30 returns for 327 yards with a long of 37 yards and returned two kickoffs for 87 yards.|$|E
5|$|Hayes {{had begun}} his law {{practice}} dealing primarily with commercial issues but won greater prominence in Cincinnati {{as a criminal}} defense attorney, defending several people accused of murder. In one case, he used a form of the insanity <b>defense</b> <b>that</b> saved the accused from the gallows; the woman was instead confined to a mental institution. Hayes also defended slaves who had escaped and were accused under the recently enacted Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. As Cincinnati was just across the Ohio River from Kentucky, a slave state, it was a destination for escaping slaves and many such cases were tried in its courts. A staunch abolitionist, Hayes found his {{work on behalf of}} fugitive slaves personally gratifying as well as politically useful, as it raised his profile in the newly formed Republican Party.|$|E

5|$|In 1964, the ACLU {{opened up}} a major office in Atlanta, Georgia, {{dedicated}} to serving Southern issues. Much of the ACLU's progress in the South was due to Charles Morgan, Jr., the charismatic leader of the Atlanta office. He was responsible for desegregating juries (Whitus v. Georgia), desegregating prisons (Lee v. Washington), and reforming election laws. The ACLU's southern office also defended African-American congressman Julian Bond in Bond v. Floyd, when the Georgia congress refused to formally induct Bond into the legislature. Another widely publicized case defended by Morgan was that of Army doctor Howard Levy, {{who was convicted of}} refusing to train Green Berets. Despite raising the <b>defense</b> <b>that</b> the Green Berets were committing war crimes in Vietnam, Levy lost on appeal in Parker v. Levy, 417 U.S. 733 (1974).|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the previous season the Giants headed into the 1985 season {{with a sense of}} optimism after their successful 1984 campaign and a 5–0 pre-season record. The Giants went 10–6, and Taylor spearheaded a <b>defense</b> <b>that</b> led the NFL in sacks with 68. Taylor had 13. One of the more memorable plays of his career occurred during this season. On a Monday Night Football game against the Redskins, Taylor's sack of Redskins quarterback Joe Theismann inadvertently resulted in a compound fracture of Theismann's right leg. After the sack, a distraught Taylor screamed for paramedics to attend to Theismann. Although this sack ended Theismann's career, Theismann has never blamed Taylor for the injury. Taylor says he has never seen video of the play and never wants to. During {{the first round of the}} playoffs, the Giants defeated the defending champion 49ers 17–3, but lost to the eventual champion Chicago Bears in the second round 21–0.|$|E
5|$|Jack Youngblood {{was born}} in Jacksonville, Florida, the son of Herbert J. and Kay Youngblood. He has two sisters, Paula and Lynn. Youngblood {{attended}} Monticello-Jefferson County High School in Monticello, Florida, graduating in 1967. As an offensive lineman and linebacker, he was a starter on offense and defense and team captain of the state champion Tigers, earning All-State honors in 1966 after recording 70 tackles. He was also All-Big Bend, All-Conference and the Big Bend Linemen of the Year and the Outstanding Lineman for the Tigers that season while leading a <b>defense</b> <b>that</b> shutout seven opponents and allowed ten touchdowns in 12 games, including the state playoffs. He was a four-year letterman in football and also played basketball at M-JC High as well as participating in 4-H, Student Council and Key Club International.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the {{establishment}} of USSOCOM provided its own measure of excitement. A quick solution to manning and basing a brand new unified command was to abolish an existing command. United States Readiness Command (USREDCOM), with an often misunderstood mission, {{did not appear to}} have a viable mission in the post Goldwater-Nichols era, and its Commander in Chief, General James Lindsay, had had some special operations experience. On 23 January 1987, the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommended to the Secretary of <b>Defense</b> <b>that</b> USREDCOM be disestablished to provide billets and facilities for USSOCOM. President Ronald Reagan approved {{the establishment}} of the new command on 13 April 1987. The Department of Defense activated USSOCOM on 16 April 1987 and nominated General Lindsay to be the first Commander in Chief Special Operations Command (USCINCSOC). The Senate accepted him without debate.|$|E
5|$|On December 17, Sony {{canceled}} the New York City premiere. Later that day, other major theater chains including AMC, Cinemark, Cineplex, Regal and Southern Theatres either delayed or canceled screenings of the film. The chains reportedly came {{under pressure from}} the malls where many theaters are located, which feared that the terror threat would harm their holiday sales. They also feared expensive lawsuits {{in the event of an}} attack; Cinemark, for instance, contended that it could not have foreseen the 2012 Aurora shooting, which took place at one of its multiplexes, a <b>defense</b> <b>that</b> would not hold in the event of an attack at a screening of The Interview.|$|E
5|$|Rodman {{remained}} a bench player during the 1988–1989 season, averaging 9.0 points and 9.4 rebounds in 27minutes, yet providing such effective <b>defense</b> <b>that</b> he was voted into the All-Defensive Team, {{the first of}} eight times in his career. He also began seeing more playing time after Adrian Dantley was traded at midseason to Dallas for Mark Aguirre. In that season, the Pistons finally vanquished their playoffs bane by sweeping the Boston Celtics, then winning in six games versus the Chicago Bulls—including scoring champion Michael Jordan—and easily defeating the Lakers 4–0 in the 1989 NBA Finals. Although he was hampered by back spasms, Rodman dominated the boards, grabbing 19 rebounds in Game 3 and providing tough interior defense.|$|E
