She writes it, she comes back. She does a version of it, we talk about it. It's a back and forth until she gets it right. It's a total collaboration.|$|E
500|$|Wotton {{had become}} {{something}} of a public speaker, speaking at various venues including presenting the screening of Protected at the Film Fanatics society at Petersham Bowling Club where he spoke of seeing the film as a boy and how it opened his eyes to the way [...] "things were different on Palm". He went on a tour that included Melbourne on 9 August 2008 at the Solidarity Fiesta at the MUA Auditorium he said .... "I'm not afraid of anything, because...people like you will <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> spread the message, tell the truth."

That would have tarnished the whole thing." [...] According to some sources, Drysdale was the person who convinced Hershiser to take the mound for the tenth inning, saying, [...] "I gave him a kick in the pants and told him to <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> go as far as he can". However, other sources state that Drysdale merely said that if he had known about Hershiser's hesitance to break the record, he would have reassured him, saying [...] "I'd have kicked him right in the rear if I had known that... I'd have told him to get his buns out there and get them." ...|$|E

[...] In early 2013, Lytle elaborated: [...] "I love the idea of making another Grandaddy record, but I wouldn't want it hanging over my head like 'Okay, you made this record, now are you guys going to <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> tour in support of it?'... I'm hoping for this dream scenario where I can make Grandaddy records every so often and not have all this messy stuff that goes along with it.

500|$|... "Initially, {{this was}} {{simply going to}} be an album of piano and voice", Wainwright stated in a May 2007 {{interview}} with The Independent Nick Duerden. That was, however, until he visited Berlin, which influenced the album's lush sound. Wainwright declared, [...] "Basically, a huge wave of German Romanticism descended on the recording process, and almost drowned me." [...] Wainwright cited two reasons for the change in direction and the heightened dramatic flare: the cancer diagnosis received by his mother (folk musician Kate McGarrigle) during the album's genesis, which he found [...] "fueled his creative intensity in some kind of displaced attempt to get her well", and the New York Metropolitan Opera's commissioning Wainwright to write an opera, making Release the Stars a way of training for such a large project. Revealing the overall theme in January 2007, Wainwright declared the album was about opening up and following impulses. [...] "Whether it's the environment, politics or religious warfare", Wainwright stated in an interview with The Japan Times, [...] "it's time to <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> {{be a part of the}} solution, whatever that is." ...|$|E

500|$|During an {{interview}} with Digital Spy, Lewis told Tom Eames that Glassheart has a running theme about [...] "star-crossed lovers that can't be together", {{and so it was}} likely that this idea would feature on the tour. Lewis also cited William Shakespeare as another source of inspiration. She spent the three days of the final tour rehearsals at The Backstage Centre in Purfleet, Essex (UK). The Glassheart Tour was scheduled to visit twenty-one venues across Germany and the United Kingdom. The tour was expected to begin on 15 April in Berlin. The list had expanded from an initial sixteen to include five dates in Germany. Lewis would then proceed with UK dates beginning in Glasgow, including two dates at London's Royal Albert Hall before finishing on 18 May in Plymouth. Speaking about the tour, Lewis said [...] "I can't wait to <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> play my new songs.

Many drivers backed the decision, with Jenson Button saying: [...] "It {{was the right thing}} to do [...] In one respect, maybe if we decided three hours earlier it would have been better for the fans. But we wanted to <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> drive and put on a show. Delaying it every half an hour was the way it had to be." [...] During the waiting period on Saturday, many teams had engaged in tomfoolery in the paddock to entertain the crowds, such as bowling or ballroom dancing between Red Bull teammates Daniel Ricciardo and Daniil Kvyat. Ferrari later condemned the behaviour of their fellow teams, with team principal Maurizio Arrivabene saying: [...] "We are a Formula One team, not the Cirque du Soleil." [...] Kimi Räikkönen backed him, stating: [...] "I think this is F1 and not the circus. The people are obviously not happy when we're not running but we cannot make them happy with whatever we do apart from running." ...|$|E
500|$|Angelina's {{dream is}} to be a {{successful}} singer on the music charts. DeGarmo noted that her father, Angelo, [...] "who thinks his spoiled-brat daughter sings like a choir of angels" [...] puts pressure on Devon Hamilton (Bryton James), a young and upcoming music producer, to show Angelina the ropes of the music industry and make her a success. DeGarmo said: [...] "Unfortunately, she’s not as good a singer as she and her father think she is [...] Angelina is a bit oblivious to reality, but will slowly come to grips with it over the next few weeks. As a singer myself, it’s liberating to get on the set and throw all ego – and notes – aside and surprise people." [...] DeGarmo commented: [...] "It's fantastically hilarious because it puts the poor kid in a horrible predicament!" [...] She said that Angelina was into Top 40 music at first, but: [...] "the writers have her singing the American standards — Judy Garland, that sort of thing. We want the audience to be really familiar with the songs, so they can tell how badly Angie is butchering them." [...] Michael Logan of TV Guide noted that you needed [...] "skill to play a bad singer", to which DeGarmo said that it's harder than people realize: [...] "but it's really liberating to <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> be bad. You just throw your ego to the wind and sing for Jesus." [...] Devon would eventually go on to make Angelina a good singer. Angelina briefly fired Devon for adding rap verses to a song of hers which was soaring on the charts, but he retained the rights of the track.|$|E
5000|$|Looking {{back on the}} season, Nagasu said, [...] "Getting my {{body back}} into shape the injury was tough. I really did not get back into shape until Four Continents, where I did the best I could." [...] Focus had also been an issue; [...] "She was {{thinking}} of some things that didn't go so well before or something that was coming up -- {{all kinds of different}} thoughts instead of <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> doing each thing that was coming along and just doing the program", according to Carroll.|$|R

500|$|The Ramones' {{debut album}} had an outsized effect {{relative}} to its modest sales. According to Generation X bassist Tony James, [...] "Everybody went up three gears {{the day they}} got that first Ramones album. Punk rock—that rama-lama super fast stuff—is totally down to the Ramones. Bands were just playing in an MC5 groove until then." [...] The Ramones' two July 1976 shows, like their debut album, are seen as having {{a significant impact on}} the style of many of the newly formed British punk acts—as one observer put it, [...] "instantly nearly every band speeded up". The Ramones' first British concert, at London's Roundhouse concert hall, was held on July 4, 1976, the United States Bicentennial. The Sex Pistols were playing in Sheffield that evening, supported by the Clash, making their public debut. The next night, members of both bands attended the Ramones' gig at the Dingwall's club. Ramones manager Danny Fields recalls a conversation between Johnny Ramone and Clash bassist Paul Simonon (which he mislocates at the Roundhouse): [...] "Johnny asked him, 'What do you do? Are you in a band?' Paul said, 'Well, we just rehearse. We call ourselves the Clash but we're not good enough.' Johnny said, 'Wait till you see us—we stink, we're lousy, we can't play. Just <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> do it.'" [...] Another band whose members saw the Ramones perform, the Damned, played their first show two days later.

2500|$|Pete Willis of Def Leppard {{was seen}} as another major {{influence}} for Darrell.

I was inspired by him because I was a small young dude {{and he was a}} small young dude, too—and he was out there kickin' ass. He made me want to <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> play.

We'll miss having him on the road with us, but as his brothers and bandmates we respect his decision and are looking forward to <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> playing for the fans.
