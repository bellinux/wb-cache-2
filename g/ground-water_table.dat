40|$|This is {{a report}} of field {{research}} on Karezes in Turpan and Hami in 1988. Both districts are in Xinjiang, China. The research was conducted by the Xingjiang Institute of Biology, Pedology and Desert Research Chinese Academy of Sciences (XIBPDR) and an exploratory party from Japan sponsored by the Japanese Ministry of Education. Much information was obtained on Karezes. For example, how to excavate them, the equantity of ground-water, how to maintain them, how to use their water for fields and present their troubles in Turpan and Hami. This abstract shows the troubles of Karezes, their vitalization and mentions conservation of water-resources in the future. We appreciate Xinjiang Bureau of Water Conservancy (XBWC) for their important information and suggestions. But this briefing is private and the first author takes the responsibility for mistakes. 1. Lowering of the <b>Ground-water</b> <b>Table</b> The biggest problem of the Karezes in Turpan and Hami is lowering of the <b>ground-water</b> <b>table.</b> The Karezes depend on ground-water but many Karezes excavated when the <b>ground-water</b> <b>table</b> was moderate high. Lowering of the <b>ground-water</b> <b>table</b> can not keep this condition and serves poor water resources. The construction of open channels in 1960 - 1970 s to get snow-melt water from the Tien Shan Mts., was possibly due to lowering the <b>ground-water</b> <b>table.</b> Snow-melt water flow in many rivers infiltrates the desert land from the river beds. This infiltration has enriched the ground-water of Turpan and Hami for a long time. But new open channels convey water to fields directly and do not give the river-flow enough time to infiltrate the desert land. The ground-water has thus decreased considerably. Today, thousands of small pump stations pump ground-water for irrigation in Turpan and Hami but they also lower the <b>ground-water</b> <b>table.</b> The <b>ground-water</b> <b>table</b> is thus not available for many Karezes. The great success of agricultural and industrial development in Turpan and Hami is due to water resources development and conservation by those pumps and open channels. But the Karezes are suffering from little water due to modern water facilities. 2. Breakdown of the inner walls of Karez Most outlets of the Karezes are near villages or vegetable fields, i. e. oasis. The soil around an oasis is silty. Silty soil is good for vegetable growth {{but not for the}} structure of Karezes. When silty soil becomes moisture, it becomes loosely. Flow of a Karez gives moisture to the inner wall and makes erosion continuously along the watered lower part of the wall. After a moderate time, the walls become weak and falls down. This situation has continues for a long time. The diameter of a Karez becomes bigger and bigger under a silty soil area. This is very dangerous for the people of a village, because big diameter thins top soil of a Karez near the outlet. In fact, there are many big hole-rows in some villages caused by dropping of top soil. When soil deposits on the bed of a Karez, flow is dammed up leading to greater depth. This causes water loss through infiltration by high water depth pressure. 3. Possibility of Water Pollution The success of agricultural development in Turpan and Hami depends also on popularization of chemical fertilizer. But this may lead to ground-water pollution, because some Karezes get seepage water from vegetable fields. If water contains excess chemical fertilizer, pollution will eventually result. 4. Vitalization To lessen the decrease in ground-water flow, the bureau and farmers try to extend a Karez toward the up-stream to obtain more water but without success in some cases. The basic problem of Karezes is the lowering of ground-water. So, the bureau has recommended farmers to keep their pump stations away from the under-ground way of a Karez. This is good policy to conserve the <b>ground-water</b> <b>table.</b> But to farmers who want to get much water and produce much food, the pump station is more convenient and reliable. Pumping ground-water will be more popular and facilities larger in next ten years possibly. But this may lead to serious problems for Karezes. XBWC is trying to recharge the ground-water by flood flow every year. When heavy rain falls in the Tien Shan Mts., they forecast the time that the flood water will reach the desert. This will lead to good results provided the farmers work here. Vitalization of Karezes depends on recharging the ground-water over a long period. In a short term, extension of their length and protect work for seepage from inner wall of Karez are good policies. In any case, the vitalization must {{be a part of the}} strategy of water resources development and conservation for the Tien Shan Mts., in the near future. 5. Renovation of the Water Delivery System Farmers in the vicinity of an oasis share water from Karezes very strictly. They have a conventional water delivery system for villages and fields. The system is very good, because all farmers can obtain water easily and equally. Only the quantity of water may be inadequate. To improve the system, field research for unit water requirement of crops and vegetables is needed. The results of this research and appropriate improvement of form and dimensions of fields may save water for fallow irrigation. Most delivery channels from Karezes are made by soil. Sometimes a channel breaks and water flows into roads and other places. To prevent spillover and seepage, seal materials for channel beds and walls are needed. Attention should be directed to the fact that when a channel is covered by seal, flow condition change. If the new design discharge for sealed channel is equal to old one, flow velocity will increase causeing water depth to be low. These improvement, research and work have already been started and strongly supported by XIBPDR and XBWC. But the difficulty is not research but money. 6. Observation of Ground-water To vitalize Karezes, we need more precise data on ground-water moving in the desert. LAND-SAT clearly showed the ground-water or soil moisture everywhere on the earth. Unfortunately continuous data are not available on it. We must create an observation system for ground-water and on which the future supply of water for the Karezes will depend. The Tien Shan Mts., await future development of water resources and water power generation. Some Karezes will obtain water from the Tien Shan Mts., as a result. Some inner walls will be sealed to become under-ground reservoirs for excess flood water...|$|E

40|$|Land {{subsidence}} is {{a problem}} in the Dutch peat lands. These lands subside when low <b>ground-water</b> <b>tables</b> are maintained, and result in an increased safety risk, more complex water man-agement and CO 2 production. In order to predict this subsidence Hoogheemraadschap De Stichtse Rijnlanden and the province of Utrecht created the land subsidence model Phoenix. The problem was that this model was not complete. Two improvements that could be made to this model were identified. The first improvement was adding regional differences in land subsi-dence due to for example differences in water management and soil characteristics. An attempt was made to implement these regional differences by identifying historical land and surface wa-ter subsidence, and how they relate. It was found that the average land subsidence in the study area over the past 40 years has been around 7, 7 mm/y, with outliers up to 60 mm/y in Zegveld. The surface water levels on average have subsided less rapid resulting in a decrease in free-board over this same time period. Although regional differences were observed, they cannot be implemented responsibly as they were explained by errors in input data. The second improve-ment was the implementation of the increase in land subsidence due to temperature changes caused by climate change. The impact of climate change, according to scenario W+ of the KNMI, on land subsidence causes the peat soils to subside up to twice as fast in 2200 com-pared to 2000, having the same freeboard and soil characteristics. This climate change impact was added to Phoenix and modelled up to 2200. This run was then compared to a base run. The result was that soils with 30 cm clay had the largest additional land subsidence up to 2, 4 m. The largest percentage difference in land subsidence was observed in soils with 60 cm clay, which may subside up to an additional 270 %...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. The proposed high-level radioactive waste repository site at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, has created a need to understand the, ground-water system at the site. One of the important hydrologic characteristics is a steep gradient on the <b>ground-water</b> <b>table</b> north of the repository site. This study investigates the cause of the steep gradient, based on the possible influence by Paleozoic rocks under the Yucca Mountain area. A quasi-three dimensional, steady-state, finite-difference model of the groundwater flow system of the Yucca Mountain Site and vicinity, was developed using a manual trial-and-error calibration technique to model the <b>ground-water</b> <b>table.</b> The ground-water system in the model was divided into a two layers, which consist of Cenozoic volcanic rocks and Paleozoic carbonate rocks. The carbonate rocks were defined to be a confined aquifer. The model simulates vertical flow from the volcanic rocks to the underlying carbonate rocks in an area where the Eleana Formation, a Paleozoic clastic aquitard, is absent. The model requires a vertical hydrologic connection in a particular region and a large difference in hydraulic heads between the volcanic rocks and the carbonates to create the steep gradient north of the repository site. The regions of different hydraulic gradient on the water-table surface could be simulated by spatial variations of the horizontal hydraulic conductivity in the volcanic rocks...|$|E

40|$|Anaerobic {{microbial}} degradation of aromatic hydrocarbons and {{the occurrence of}} metabolites were studied in detail in the groundwater of the former manufactured gasplant site at Düsseldorf-Flingern especially with respect to changes due to remediation of soil and groundwater. Physico-chemical effects such as variations in <b>ground-water</b> <b>table,</b> processes of transport and sorption as well as {{microbial degradation}} cause a specific distribution and composition of the aromatics in the contaminant plume. The microbial degradation of the monoaromatics under sulfate-reducing conditions was classified as follows: Strongly reactive: Toluene, benzene, 1, 2, 4 -trimethylbenzene, styrene. Medium reactive: Xylenes, 1, 3, 5 -trimethylbenzene, m-ethyltoluene. Hardly reactive: Ethylbenzene, methylstyrenes, 1, 2, 3 -trimethylbenzene. Under nitrate-reducing conditions, benzene appeares to be resistant and ethylbenzene more reactive. Degradation of the aromatics coupled to sulfate-reduction is significantly disturbed probably by diffusion of athmospheric oxygen. Short term addition of nitrate to the groundwater only enhances the transformation of toluene and 1, 2, 4 -trimethylbenzene. Several aromatic acids {{were found in the}} groundwater as intermediates of the microbial degradation and could be attributed to the corresponding aromatic compounds in most cases.

40|$|In the YAHAGI {{drainage}} basin which {{is situated in}} the eastern part of Aichi prefecture, the authors have researched the elements of water requirement for rice field preparation. Main results obtained are as follows, The elements of the water requirement for preparation are evaporation, the depth of flooding water, the saturation of the surface soil, and percolation. In a rough estimate, evaporation is 2 - 3 ㎜, the depth of flooding water is 40 ㎜, the saturation of the surface soil is less than 40 ㎜, percolation is 0 - 200 ㎜. Commonly, the water requirement for preparation is 80 - 120 ㎜ in a ill-drained paddy field, 100 - 150 ㎜ in a well-drained paddy field and 150 - 250 ㎜ in a leaking paddy field. Therefore, these differences are based on the total of the saturation of the surface soil and percolation. The saturation of the surface soil is influenced by the <b>ground-water</b> <b>table.</b> When the groundwater table is lower than 1 m from ground surface, saturation has a maximum quantity of 40 mm.

40|$|Years of {{intensive}} irrigated farming in the Oasis area of Xinjiang in north-western China has caused secondary salinization of vast areas of land {{since the mid}} 1980 s. Soil salinity/sodicity surveys in the area, conducted after the problem surfaced, showed relatively high levels of the sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) in the upper soil layers. In one. study, 92 % of cored soil samples of the affected fields showed SAR values above 5, while 42 % had values above 15. One ameliorative approach, bio-drainage using different desert vegetations, was used to control the high water-tables and reverse the observed salinity/sodicity trends in the border area of the Manas Alluvial Fan. The <b>ground-water</b> <b>table</b> dropped to below 2. 28 m {{in the summer of}} the fifth year, which was sufficient to prevent secondary salinization. A related plot study showed that Lycium barbarum and Puccinellia Chinamponsis consumed large amounts of soil water while leaving most of the salts behind. The salt contents of leaves and young branches were different for different vegetation. Soil profile salt distributions for the deep-rooted and shallow-rooted systems were different in two of the three years after planting.

40|$|International audienceObservations {{indicate}} that groundwater levels are declining {{in many regions}} around the world. Simulating such depletion of groundwater at the global scale still remains a challenge because most global Land Surface Models (LSMs) lack the physical representation of groundwater dynamics in general and well pumping in particular. Here we present an integrated hydrologic model, which explicitly simulates ground-water dynamics and pumping within a global LSM that also accounts for human activities such as irrigation and reservoir operation. The model is used to simulate global water fluxes and storages with a particular focus on groundwater withdrawal and depletion in the High Plains Aquifer (HPA) and Central Valley Aquifer (CVA). Simulated global groundwater withdrawal and depletion for the year 2000 are 570 and 330 km 3 yr 21, respectively; the depletion agrees better with observations than our previous model result without ground-water representation, but may still contain certain uncertainties {{and is on the}} higher side of other estimates. Groundwater withdrawals from the HPA and CVA are 22 and 9 km 3 yr 21, respectively, which are also consistent with the observations of 24 and 13 km 3 yr 21. The model simulates a significant decline in total terrestrial water storage in both regions as caused mainly by groundwater storage depletion. <b>Ground-water</b> <b>table</b> declined by 14 cm yr 21 in the HPA during 2003 – 2010; the rate is even higher (71 cm yr 21) in the CVA.

In a great many instances, observations of vegetative composition, topography and general soil type, aided by aerial photography and local experience, give completely adequate information. Normally, derivation of conclusions from such observations is based on well established principles, and the recognition of general broad classes of the cause of mal-drainage conditions. Such classes may be grouped as; (I) where infiltration capacity of a soil is inadequate to deal with the amount of water supplied to the surface, because of topography, abnormal rainfall, or through inherent inability of the soil to transmit water internally, (II) where the groundwater table rises to a height detrimental to vegetative survival and/or soil structure, or where its presence hinders the function of a free draining subsoil, end (III) where a similar situation exists, due to a perched or elevated <b>ground-water</b> <b>table.</b> The allocation of a particular drainage problem to {{one or more of these}} broad classes is not usually difficult, but identification of causal processes within classes presents quite another problem.

In northwest Europe (as indicated by palaeoecological and geological evidence) climate changed from relatively warm and continental to oceanic. As a consequence, the <b>ground-water</b> <b>table</b> rose considerably in certain low-lying areas in The Netherlands. Archaeological and palaeoecological evidence for the abandonment of such areas in the northern Netherlands is interpreted as {{the effect of a}} rise of the water table and the extension of fens and bogs. Contraction of population and finally migration from these low-lying areas, which had become marginal for occupation, and the earliest colonisation by farming communities of the newly emerged salt marshes in the northern Netherlands around 2550 BP, is interpreted as the consequence of loss of cultivated land. Thermic contraction of ocean water and/or decreased velocity and pressure on the coast by the Gulf Stream may have caused a fall in relative sea-level rise and the emergence of these salt marshes. Evidence for a synchronous climatic change elsewhere in Europe and on other continents around 2650 BP is presented. Temporary aridity in tropical regions and a reduced transport of warmth to the temperate climate regions by atmospheric and/or oceanic circulation systems could explain the observed changes. As yet there is no clear explanation for this climate change and the contemporaneous increase of C- 14 in the atmosphere.

The main objectives of this study were to find how these changes in climate and deposition can change the vegetation of mire ecosystems and the growth of Sphagnumspecies. Two main approaches were applied: re-investigated of two mires previously investigated 40 - 50 years ago and experiment manipulations. The plant species diversity had decreased on one of the two re-investigated mires (Skattlösbergs Stormosse; central Sweden), but the total number of species was unchanged on the other (Åkhultmyren; southern Sweden). On Skattlösbergs Stormosse, an acidification was found in the high pH areas, coinciding with reduction in rich fen species. At Åkhultmyren, there was a similar reduction in pH, but the changes in the plant composition also indicated increased nutrient levels and a drier mire surface. Therwere large changes in species composition on Åkhultmyren. For instance Scheuchzeria palustris had disappeared from the investigated area. Further, the cover of Scots pine (Pinusylvestris) had increased, which can be explained by a changed <b>ground-water</b> <b>table</b> regime. Monitoring of pines growing on a bog over a ten-year period showed that pines growing higher above the ground-war table had higher survival than lower-growing pines. Experimental addition of nitrogen during 3 - 4 years reduced Sphagnum growth in bogs and poor fens repressenting a wide range of ambient nitrogen deposition.

The threshold values of the depth, area size and circularity index appropriate for distinguishing dolines were identified from the maximum overall accuracy obtained by comparison with a true doline map. Our results indicate that the best performance of the proposed methodology for meso-scale karst feature detection was using ALOS/PRISM data with a threshold depth > 2 m; areas > 13, 125 m 2 and circularity indexes > 0. 3 (overall accuracy of 0. 53). The overall correct identification of around half of the true dolines suggests the potential to substantially improve doline identification using higher-resolution LiDAR-generated DEMs...|$|E
40|$|Pauma Valley {{is located}} in a {{widening}} of the San Luis Rey River Valley six miles southeast of Pala in northern San Diego County, California. The area mapped covers approximately 25 square miles. Groundwater investigation was confined to an area of about 15 square miles in the San Luis Rey River Valley and in tributary valleys. Rocks of the Southern California batholith of Cretaceous age and Triassic meta-sediments are exposed throughout the area except along the floors of the stream valleys and alluvial fans, where Quaternary alluvial sediments have been deposited. The crystalline rock types present include gabbro, tonalite, and granodiorite. Pegmatite dikes occur in the gabbros and less commonly in the other igneous rocks. The Elsinore fault zone crosses the northeastern portion of the area. The exposed rocks are distorted in an area as much as one mile wide along the fault zone. The Agua Tibia Mountains were raised about 4000 feet along the fault zone during Quaternary time. Here the Quaternary movement along the Elsinore fault zone was largely of a reverse nature, with some strike-slip motion. Three alluvial fan deposits are present in the San Luis Rey River Valley. One of these, the Agua Tibia fan, was deposited so rapidly that the river was dammed and a lake formed upstream in the river valley. Ground-water is produced chiefly from the flood plain deposits of the San Luis Rey River. The deposits of the Rincon alluvial fan have yielded water in satisfactory amounts, but the Pauma Creek alluvial fan materials should be capable of more than their present groundwater production. The deposits of the Agua Tibia alluvial fan are poorly sorted and relatively impermeable, and do not appear to constitute an attractive aquifer. Ground-water in significant quantity may be moving laterally along the Elsinore fault zone. Locally, the <b>ground-water</b> <b>table</b> was lowered as much as 13 feet in the San Luis Rey River Valley during the period 1940 - 1950. However, the water supply in the lower parts of the river valley will remain adequate unless ground-water production is increased markedly. ...|$|E
40|$|Caves in Corral County, Texas, were {{examined}} {{with regard to}} their lithologic and geomorphic setting, paying particular attention to controls such as stratigraphic variation, topography, jointing, and ground-water flow. In the light of these data, a new classification of caves is proposed based upon the mode of water flow involved in their formation. Influent caves are formed by water flowing from the surface to the <b>ground-water</b> <b>table.</b> Effluent caves are formed by water flowing from the ground-water reservoir to the surface. Conduit caves are formed principally by phreatic flow with little, or no, surface relationship. This classification is extremely useful in identifying the factors involved in speleogenesis when used in conjunction with areal maps of the aforementioned controls. Effluent caves in the lower Glen Rose Formation are localized within a massive, fossiliferous aquifer and oriented generally down-dip, thus substantiating Gardner's (1935) theory of speleogenesis. Influent caves in both the upper and lower Glen Rose Formation are developed in areas with low surface gradient and consequently high infiltration. They develop vertically until the water reaches a suitable calcareous stratum which conducts it away laterally. A later change of conditions may cause further deepening and a series of pits and passages may develop. Conduit caves in the upper Glen Rose Formation appear to be localized within the more calcareous strata because of the high solubility of these layers in contrast to the shales, marls, and dolomites composing the major part of the section. Secondary collapse of the overlying less soluble strata may provide access for additional inflow, but in most cases this can be eliminated as the primary cause of cavern development. Vadose inflow and the mixing effect which Thrailkill (1968) has postulated as causes of increased solution do not seem responsible either. All the conduit caves examined in detail, however, occur in areas of ground-water convergence. It is hypothesized that the abnormally high flow rate and volume due to this convergence is responsible for their development, thus supporting the mechanism proposed by Swinnerton (1932) and Davies (1957). A cursory examination of caves in the Edwards Limestone reveals that effluent caves may also be caused by the overflowing of a perched aquifer into surface valleys. In the Edwards Limestone it also appears that conduit caves may be localized in a horizon which has high permeability, even within a compositionally homogeneous section...|$|E
30|$|Nevertheless, the {{recorded}} range between the pre-dawn plant water potentials and the midday plant water potentials at Namibrand is still surprisingly low (indicated in Fig. 4). Stronger values {{had been expected}} for a site in the Namib Desert, which receives such little precipitation (compare to e.g. Mitlöhner 1998; Gebrehiwot et al. 2005; Gebrekirstos et al. 2006). Thus unexpected soil water access is reflected {{in relation to the}} dune’s volume, but the source is unknown. Access to a deep <b>ground-water</b> <b>table</b> (known by a borehole ca. 4  km south) cannot be considered. Fog precipitation may also not come into account in sufficient extent for the growth of trees in that distance to the sea. Although a few days of fog occur annually and these may support growth of S. sabulicola (Roth-Nebelsick 2012), Schachtschneider and February (2010) state that also riparian trees in hyper-arid environments of the Namib Desert are rather relying on a ‘seasonally fluctuating combination of ground water, shallow soil water and deep soil water’ than on fog precipitation. Thus it might be presumed that the dunes store noteworthy amounts of soil water from precipitation. It may be caused by a water-storing effect of the coarse sand, which allows deep percolation and minimizes runoff and evaporation losses, and thus can be expected to provide storage of plant available water (compare Ganssen 1968; Weidelt 1989; Minnich 1995; Bodnar and Hulshof 2006). According to the author’s own observations, even after a little rainfall of less than 10  mm, the surface dries fast (illustrated in Fig.  2), while water is stored within a few centimetres below the surface for many days and even weeks. The coarse pore system hardly allows any capillary water ascent (Mensching 1990). According to Weidelt (1989), such ‘basic soil moisture’ of sites without any noteworthy capillary ascent, can support a limited stock of perennial grass and potentially even trees, even in extremely arid areas over years. However, since such ‘profile water’ would not explain the observed, elevation-related changes of midday water potential unless situated in deeper layers of the dunes, it could alternatively be assumed that the observations are linked to another underground aquifer in the dune, possibly accumulated from episodic events and a while ago. Such episodic events were observed by Namibrand Nature Reserve authorities e.g. in 2001 and 2011 (seasonal precipitation of 130 and 420  mm, respectively, pers. com.), but may have supported water availability for V. erioloba also a decade ago – considering the age of present individuals. Following these observations, a reasonable water supply may be assumed to be available for deep-rooted trees.|$|E
40|$|A palaeodepositional {{model and}} an {{analysis}} of the diagenetic evolution of the Upper Triassic Snadd Formation in the Barents Sea are here presented. Attention has especially been given to the pedogenic structures dominating the sediments. The interpretations are based on core logging and thin section analyses including three shallow, stratigraphic wells from the south- western Barents Sea area. The data from the Nordkapp Basin represent a sediment succession of only a few meter thicknesses, and the main interpretation is therefore based on data from the Bjarmeland Platform core, which covers the upper 108. 9 m of the Snadd Formation of Carnian to Norian age. Sandstones are mineralogical immature, fine- grained lithic arenites. Main carbonate cements include siderite, calcite and ankerite. Iron carbonates formed early in the diagenetic evolution and a progressive decrease in the Fe- content of the system with time has been evidenced. Kaolinite is a dominating, early diagenetic mineral, and indicates an overall humid climate. Regional interpretations of the Upper Triassic palaeoclimate, are that there was a switch from arid to humid on the Triassic- Jurassic border, and this goes well with the observations made in this study. Alternating sand and mud layers dominate the Upper Triassic strata and are suggested to represent deltaic sequences formed as a consequence of autocyclic switching of lobes on the delta plain. Sedimentary structures indicate a tidally influenced environment, while thin coal deposits and abundance of root structures indicate a transitional to continental setting. In the Bjarmeland Platform core there is a switch from coarsening upward units dominated by tidal structures in the lower portions to dominantly fining upward units with rooted horizons and lack of tidal influence in the upper portion, suggesting a transition from lower delta plain to mid/upper delta plain. The Nordkapp Basin cores bear resemblance to the upper portion of the Bjarmeland Platform succession and a similar setting has been interpreted for these deposits. The depostional model correlates well with former interpretations of a large- scale delta system prograding in a westward direction in Late Triassic. Mottled sediments clearly modified by pedogenic processes are found inbetween smaller fining upward or coarsening upward sand units. The interpreted delta plain environment is a favourable setting for pedogenesis and several micro-textures e. g. carbonate-coated grains, alveolar textures, circumgranular cracking and Microcodium have been identified in the polarization microscope. Coal beds are often associated with dark grey to black carbonaceous mudrocks reflecting high water table and reducing conditions during pedogenesis. The alternations between oxidized ferruginous palaeosols with carbonate concretions and carbonaceous palaeosols most likely reflects variation in ground-water level, caused by avulsion of channels on the delta plain. Oxidized palaeosols probably formed during low-water table while carbonaceous palaeosols were formed during high <b>ground-water</b> <b>table</b> perhaps in small pools on the delta plain. The well- preserved soil profiles indicate subaerial exposure for a sufficient period of time, followed by lack of subsequent erosion. Extensive carbonate cementation at an early stage has probably enhanced the preservation of the soils. </p...|$|E
40|$|This {{technical}} report is a state-of-the-art literature review regarding tyre shreds as a construction material for published material in English, Swedish and Norwegian languages. The main focus {{is to present}} the technical and environmental properties of tyre shreds focusing {{on the use of}} the material as unbound aggregates in foundation and geotechnical engineering applications. The technical properties of tyre shreds are relatively well investigated. In general, methods for determining technical properties for soils have been used in the studies. Compared to conventional soil materials like sand and gravel, tyre shreds are considered to be a lightweight material, bulk density 500 - 900 kg/m 3 depending on compaction and overlaying pressure. The low thermal conductivity, 0. 15 - 0. 30 W/m,K, makes the material interesting for thermal insulation. The permeability is high,about 0. 01 m/s, at overlaying pressures up to at least 200 kPa. Tyre shreds is a relatively weak material, Young’s modulus is approximately 1 MPa depending on overlaying pressure. Poisson’s ratio is typically 0. 3. The stress-strain relationship is non- linear and the material becomes stiffer as the stress increases. The shear strength is high at large strains, effective cohesion intercept 0 - 82 kPa and effective friction angle 15 – 36 º at 20 % strain, and low at smaller strains, effective cohesion intercept 0 - 12 kPa and effective friction angle 19 - 38 º at 10 % strain. The durability of tyre shreds seems not to be a problem in applications where the material is not exposed to UV-radiation or heat. The environmental implications of using tyre shreds in ground engineering applications have here been studied by dividing the results into three different categories; chemical content, leachability and environmental response. Tyre shreds contain compounds that have a pollution potential, e. g. PAH, phenols and zinc. The leachability of most compounds is low under normal conditions in civil engineering applications, i. e. for pH 5 - 8 and water as a leaching agent. Ecotoxicological studies show that tyre leachate causes response in these tests. Compared to the European Unions classification for chemicals these responses are below hazardous limits. However, some other species studied are sensitive to tyre leachate. Field experiences of using tyre shreds shows, up to know, no measurable negative effects in surrounding environment. Tyre shreds have beneficial properties, e. g. low density, high hydraulic conductivity, low thermal conductivity and high shear strength at large strains. There are properties of tyre shreds which differs from soil materials like sand and gravel that must be especially considered in design, e. g. the elastic properties. There are several successful examples of use of tyre shreds in civil engineering applications, e. g. in road embankments, as thermal insulation layer, in lightweight embankments and as draining layers in landfills. There are also examples of not successful projects resulting in useful experiences in design work and limitations of the material. The environmental effects of using tyre shreds needs to be considered. Before use a site-specific evaluation is recommended where both the construction and surrounding environment are considered. Based on today’s knowledge the use of tyre shreds should be limited to above the <b>ground-water</b> <b>table</b> and, if high percolation is expected, to non-sensitive recipients where the potential accumulation of pollutants may not be a problem.

40|$|The Aztec Siltstone (late Devonian) crops out for 150 km {{along the}} Transantarctic Mountains, between the Mawson and Mulock Glaciers of {{southern}} Victoria Land, Antarctica. It is the uppermost {{formation of the}} Taylor Group, the lower of the two subdivisions of the Beacon Supergroup of southern Victoria Land. The formation consists largely of fine to medium-grained sandstone, and greyish red (10 R 4 / 2), grey (N 5), and greenish grey (5 G 6 / 1) siltstone and claystone. Other lithologies include carbonaceous siltstone and claystone, limestone and intraformational conglomerate. Conchostracans, fish fossils, plant fragments, and gypsum lenses are present also. Cross-stratification, horizontal stratification, channelling, and "fining-upwards" cycles indicate deposition from shallow, high sinuosity (tortuous), meandering streams that migrated laterally across a broad alluvial plain. The sandstone beds are laterally accreted channel deposits, whereas the siltstone and claystone beds represent overbank deposition by vertical accretion in the interchannel areas of the floodbasin. Other floodbasin deposits include lacustrinal sediments from pluvial ponds and ox-bow lakes, and palustrinal sediments from the backswamps. Overbank deposition of bed load material formed levees, and stream avulsion and crevassing during flood stage produced crevasse-splay deposits. The sandstone beds are quartzarenites, with detrital grains consisting largely of plutonic quartz; other grains include chert, feldspar, metamorphic quartz and a trace of heavy minerals. Sandstone textures average fine-grained and well sorted, although sandstone with textural inversion is common. Compositional and textural characteristics indicate that the sandstone {{is a product of}} the reworking of older quartzarenite in the source area. Subaerial exposure was a feature of the fine-grained floodbasin sediments; the evidence includes the abundance of mudcracks, and a variety of soil features. The latter include extensive kankar ('calichea') horizons, pseudo- or wavey bedding structures, a compositional and textural similarity to modern soils, vein networks (considered to be a product of deep cracking in the unconsolidated. substratum), burrowing, and root horizons with in some cases associated plant fragments. The kankar ('calichea') suggests that there was a period of prolonged subaerial exposure and soil development which followed the deposition of fine-grained, fine member lithologies of the "fining upwards" cycles. This period was probably in the range 5, 000 to 50, 000 years. The Aztec Siltstone is a typical "variegated" red-bed sequence, containing interbedded red and drab fine-grained lithologies. The fine-grained drab lithologies consist of quartz grains set in a matrix of green illitic and chloritic clay. The colour in the interbedded red and grey siltstone and claystone results from a haematite pigment, which in the red samples is present in a concentration sufficient to completely mask the green colour of the clay matrix. The reddening is believed to have been a penecontemporaneous process that took place in the floodbasin sediments during their prolonged subaerial exposure under a hot and seasonally wet and dry (savanna) climate. The haematitic pigment was derived from the in situ and progressive dehydration of detrital amorphous and poorly crystalline brown hydrated ferric oxide in those sediments which maintained an oxidizing environment and were above the <b>ground-water</b> <b>table</b> during the dehydration process. Sediments which remained in a water-logged state, below the water table, and in association with organic matter, were invariably reduced and lost their iron oxide in solution. Later post-depositional reduction of some red lithologies produced reduction spheres and channels, reduced burrows and vein networks, and the reduced layers immediately underlying the scoured surface at the base of the channel sandstones. Some chemical redistribution of iron contributed to the variegated and mottled horizons of the formation. The mineral composition of adjacent red and drab lithologies is essentially the same except for the haematite constituent. The red average 5. 86 ([delta] = 1. 09) percent total Fe (as Fe 2 O 3), of, which 3. 01 ([delta] = 0. 63) percent is as haematite pigment, 1. 57 percent Fe 2 O 3 is in a combined form (probably as ferric silicates), and 1 14 ([delta] = 0. 57) percent is as FeO. The green average 3. 65 ([delta] = 1. 81) percent total Fe (as Fe 2 O 3) of which approximately 0. 27 percent is as haematite pigment, approximately 1. 4 percent Fe 2 O 3 is in a combined form, and 1. 77 ([delta] = 1. 37) percent is as FeO. In the majority of the green lithologies the free ferric oxide (as haematite or hydrated ferric oxide) was removed in solution during reduction, and at the same time minor amounts of clay matrix were also leached out...|$|E
40|$|In 2010 and 2011 Christchurch, New Zealand {{experienced}} {{a series of}} earthquakes that caused extensive damage across the city, but primarily to the Central Business District (CBD) and eastern suburbs. A major feature of the observed damage was extensive and severe soil liquefaction and associated ground damage, affecting buildings and infrastructure. The behaviour of soil during earthquake loading is a complex phenomena that can be most comprehensively analysed through advanced numerical simulations to aid engineers {{in the design of}} important buildings and critical facilities. These numerical simulations are highly dependent on the capabilities of the constitutive soil model to replicate the salient features of sand behaviour during cyclic loading, including liquefaction and cyclic mobility, such as the Stress-Density model. For robust analyses advanced soil models require extensive testing to derive engineering parameters under varying loading conditions for calibration. Prior to this research project little testing on Christchurch sands had been completed, and none from natural samples containing important features such as fabric and structure of the sand that may be influenced by the unique stress-history of the deposit. This research programme is focussed on the characterisation of Christchurch sands, as typically found in the CBD, to facilitate advanced soil modelling in both res earch and engineering practice - to simulate earthquake loading on proposed foundation design solutions including expensive ground improvement treatments. This has involved the use of a new Gel Push (GP) sampler to obtain undisturbed samples from below the <b>ground-water</b> <b>table.</b> Due to the variable nature of fluvial deposition, samples {{with a wide range of}} soil gradations, and accordingly soil index properties, were obtained from the sampling sites. The quality of the samples is comprehensively examined using available data from the ground investigation and laboratory testing. A meta-quality assessment was considered whereby a each method of evaluation contributed to the final quality index assigned to the specimen. The sampling sites were characterised with available geotechnical field-based test data, primarily the Cone Penetrometer Test (CPT), supported by borehole sampling and shear-wave velocity testing. This characterisation provides a geo- logical context to the sampling sites and samples obtained for element testing. It also facilitated the evaluation of sample quality. The sampling sites were evaluated for liquefaction hazard using the industry standard empirical procedures, and showed good correlation to observations made following the 22 February 2011 earthquake. However, the empirical method over-predicted liquefaction occurrence during the preceding 4 September 2010 event, and under-predicted for the subsequent 13 June 2011 event. The reasons for these discrepancies are discussed. The response of the GP samples to monotonic and cyclic loading was measured in the laboratory through triaxial testing at the University of Canterbury geomechanics laboratory. The undisturbed samples were compared to reconstituted specimens formed in the lab in an attempt to quantify the effect of fabric and structure in the Christchurch sands. Further testing of moist tamped re- constituted specimens (MT) was conducted to define important state parameters and state-dependent properties including the Critical State Line (CSL), and the stress-strain curve for varying state index. To account for the wide-ranging soil gradations, selected representative specimens were used to define four distinct CSL. The input parameters for the Stress-Density Model (S-D) were derived from a suite of tests performed on each representative soil, and with reference to available GP sample data. The results of testing were scrutinised by comparing the data against expected trends. The influence of fabric and structure of the GP samples was observed to result in similar cyclic strength curves at 5 % Double Amplitude (DA) strain criteria, however on close inspection of the test data, clear differences emerged. The natural samples exhibited higher compressibility during initial loading cycles, but thereafter typically exhibited steady growth of plastic strain and excess pore water pressure towards and beyond the strain criteria and initial liquefaction, and no flow was observed. By contrast the reconstituted specimens exhibited a stiffer response during initial loading cycles, but exponential growth in strains and associated excess pore water pressure beyond phase-transformation, and particularly after initial liquefaction where large strains were mobilised in subsequent cycles. These behavioural differences were not well characterised by the cyclic strength curve at 5 % DA strain level, which showed a similar strength for both GP samples and MT specimens. A preliminary calibration of the S-D model for a range of soil gradations is derived from the suite of laboratory test data. Issues encountered include the influence of natural structure on the peak-strength–state index relationship, resulting in much higher peak strengths than typically observed for sands in the literature. For the S-D model this resulted in excessive stiffness to be modelled during cyclic mobility, when the state index becomes large momentarily, causing strain development to halt. This behaviour prevented modelling the observed re- sponse of silty sands to large strains, synonymous with “liquefaction”. Efforts to reduce this effect within the current formulation are proposed as well as future research to address this issue...|$|E
