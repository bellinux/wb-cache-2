5|$|Commercially, apples can {{be stored}} for some months in {{controlled}} atmosphere chambers to delay ethylene-induced ripening. Apples are commonly stored in chambers with higher concentrations {{of carbon dioxide and}} high air filtration. This prevents ethylene concentrations from rising to higher amounts and preventing ripening from occurring too quickly. Ripening continues when the fruit <b>is</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> storage.|$|E
5|$|The tetrafluoride, PrF4, is also known, and is {{produced}} by reacting a mixture of sodium fluoride and praseodymium(III) fluoride with fluorine gas, producing Na2PrF6, following which sodium fluoride <b>is</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the reaction mixture with liquid hydrogen fluoride. Additionally, praseodymium forms a bronze diiodide; like the diiodides of lanthanum, cerium, and gadolinium, it is a praseodymium(III) electride compound.|$|E

5|$|The triad of {{cytomegalovirus}} protease uses histidine as {{both the}} acid and base triad members. Removing the acid histidine results in only a 10-fold activity loss (compared to >10,000-fold when aspartate <b>is</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> chymotrypsin). This triad has been interpreted as a possible way of generating a less active enzyme to control cleavage rate.|$|E
5|$|As {{the episode}} ends, Olivia's {{hallucination}} of Peter points {{out to her}} {{that there is a}} way to tell if she is from the prime universe: by confirming her memories of her niece Ella, who did not survive birth in the parallel universe. During Olivia's final test in the tank, she is again able to cross over to the gift shop in the prime universe. She is able to recall Ella's phone number and calls her, but is brought back to the parallel universe shortly after Ella answers. As she <b>is</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the tank, she lies, telling Walternate the test did not work.|$|E
5|$|During the {{processing}} of bauxite to alumina in the Bayer process, gallium accumulates in the sodium hydroxide liquor. From this it can be extracted {{by a variety of}} methods. The most recent is the use of ion-exchange resin. Achievable extraction efficiencies critically depend on the original concentration in the feed bauxite. At a typical feed concentration of 50 ppm, about 15 % of the contained gallium is extractable. The remainder reports to the red mud and aluminium hydroxide streams. Gallium <b>is</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the ion-exchange resin in solution. Electrolysis then gives gallium metal. For semiconductor use, it is further purified with zone melting or single-crystal extraction from a melt (Czochralski process). Purities of 99.9999% are routinely achieved and commercially available.|$|E

5|$|Francis, {{having heard}} Elizabeth's screams, enters the dungeon. Nicholas confuses Francis for Bartolome, and knocks him unconscious. He straps {{him to a}} stone slab located {{directly}} beneath a huge razor-sharp pendulum. The pendulum {{is attached to a}} clockwork apparatus that causes it to descend fractions of an inch after each swing, ever closer to Francis's torso. Catherine arrives just in time with Maximillian, one of the servants. After a brief struggle with Maximillian, Nicholas falls to his death in the pit. Francis <b>is</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the torture device. As they leave the basement, Catherine vows to seal up the chamber forever. They slam and lock the door shut, unaware that Elizabeth is still alive, gagged and trapped in the iron maiden.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, {{the portion}} of US12 from {{the west side of}} Ann Arbor into Detroit was rerouted from surface streets to new {{stretches}} of freeways running south of Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti. The former route of US12, much of which was known as Plymouth Road, was retained as a trunkline and redesignated M-14. In 1964, a northern bypass connecting US23 with M-153 was completed, and M-14 was rerouted onto the new freeway; the highway still ran through Ann Arbor along routes now designated Bus. US23 and Business Loop I-94. The following year, the freeway was extended to its present western terminus at I-94, and M-14 <b>is</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the business routes and transferred to the expressway.|$|E
5|$|Pollen <b>is</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> flowers {{deliberately}} or incidentally by bumblebees. Incidental removal {{occurs when}} bumblebees {{come in contact}} with the anthers of a flower while collecting nectar. When it enters a flower, the bumblebee's body hairs receive a dusting of pollen from the anthers. In queens and workers this is then groomed into the corbiculae (pollen baskets) on the hind legs where it can be seen as bulging masses that may contain as many as a million pollen grains. Male bumblebees do not have corbiculae and do not purposively collect pollen. Bumblebees are also capable of buzz pollination, in which they dislodge pollen from the anthers by creating a resonant vibration with their flight muscles.|$|E

5|$|Pyroclastic density {{currents}} can also produce ash particles. These are typically produced by lava dome collapse or {{collapse of the}} eruption column. Within pyroclastic {{density currents}} particle abrasion occurs as particles {{interact with each other}} resulting in a reduction in grain size and production of fine grained ash particles. In addition, ash can be produced during secondary fragmentation of pumice fragments, due to the conservation of heat within the flow. These processes produce large quantities of very fine grained ash which <b>is</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> pyroclastic density currents in co-ignimbrite ash plumes.|$|E
5|$|Structural {{effects can}} also be important. The {{difference}} between fumaric acid and maleic acid is a classic example. Fumaric acid is (E)-1,4-but-2-enedioic acid, a trans isomer, whereas maleic acid is the corresponding cis isomer, i.e. (Z)-1,4-but-2-enedioic acid (see cis-trans isomerism). Fumaric acid has pKa values of approximately 3.0 and 4.5. By contrast, maleic acid has pKa values of approximately 1.5 and 6.5. The reason for this large difference is that when one proton <b>is</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the cis isomer (maleic acid) a strong intramolecular hydrogen bond is formed with the nearby remaining carboxyl group. This favors {{the formation of the}} maleate H+, and it opposes the removal of the second proton from that species. In the trans isomer, the two carboxyl groups are always far apart, so hydrogen bonding is not observed.|$|E
5|$|The most clues for {{a minimal}} Sudoku is {{believed}} to be 40, of which only two are known. If any clue <b>is</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> either of these Sudokus, the puzzle would have more than one solution (and thus not be a proper Sudoku). These two Sudokus were discovered in 2014, more than four years after at least one programmer expressed doubts that a 40-clue minimal Sudoku would exist. In the work to find these Sudokus, other high-clue puzzles were catalogued, including more than 6,500,000,000 minimal puzzles with 36-clues. About 2600 minimal Sudokus with 39-clues were also found.|$|E

5|$|When a pawn {{advances}} two squares {{from its}} original square and ends the turn adjacent to a pawn of the opponent's on the same rank, it may be captured by that pawn of the opponent's, {{as if it had}} moved only one square forward. This capture is only legal on the opponent's next move immediately following the first pawn's advance. The diagrams on the right demonstrate an instance of this: if the white pawn moves from a2 to a4, the black pawn on b4 can capture it en passant, moving from b4 to a3 while the white pawn on a4 <b>is</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the board.|$|E
5|$|When the {{protostar}} {{has grown}} {{such that it}} ignites to form a star, the surviving disk <b>is</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the inside outward by photoevaporation, the solar wind, Poynting–Robertson drag and other effects. Thereafter there still may be many protoplanets orbiting the star or each other, but over time many will collide, either to form a single larger planet or release material for other larger protoplanets or planets to absorb. Those objects that have become massive enough will capture most matter in their orbital neighbourhoods to become planets. Protoplanets that have avoided collisions may become natural satellites of planets {{through a process of}} gravitational capture, or remain in belts of other objects to become either dwarf planets or small bodies.|$|E
5|$|Detective Harold Greer is {{initially}} {{in charge of}} the murder investigation, but Rusty has him replaced with his friend Detective Dan Lipranzer, whom he persuades to narrow the inquiry so that his relationship with Carolyn is left out. Rusty soon discovers that Molto is making his own inquiries. Aspects of the crime suggest that the killer knew police evidence-gathering procedures and covered up clues accordingly. Semen found in the victim's body contains only dead sperm. The killer's blood is type A, the same as Rusty's. When Della Guardia wins the election, he and Molto accuse Rusty of the murder and push to get evidence against him. Rusty's fingerprints are found on a beer glass from Carolyn's apartment, and fibers from his carpet at home match those found on her body. Lipranzer <b>is</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the case, and Greer's inquiries uncover the affair.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Nollette sneaks {{into the}} {{cryogenic}} facility and tampers with Grable's storage unit, thawing his remains. Roland {{returns to the}} lab {{and is in the}} process of pushing the prototype engine to mach 15 when Nollette enters. Nollette admits to stealing Grable's work and prepares to shoot Roland, but is distracted by some equations. Roland strikes him with a computer keyboard and drags him into the wind tunnel. The agents arrive in time to convince Roland not to kill Nollette. At the same time, the rising temperatures in the storage unit kill Grable. Roland <b>is</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the care home, to be taken to a psychiatric institute for testing. However, as he leaves he stops to comb his hair in a style reminiscent of his brother, raising the question of whether he is actually free of Grable's control.|$|E
5|$|Sensors {{activate}} audible sirens near each {{entrance of}} the tunnel if a vehicle above the posted height attempts to enter the tunnel. Traffic signals at that entrance will turn red, stopping all traffic. The entrance will remain closed until the vehicle <b>is</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the freeway, sometimes causing severe delays for all traffic. CDOT noted that prior to the retrofit, about 20,000 vehicles per year tripped the alarm. The trucking industry argued {{that many of these}} trucks were under the height requirement but tripped the alarm due to their air suspensions (which can be lowered during their journey through the tunnel) or due to snow and ice atop the trailer. During this time, the trucking industry estimated the number of alarms would drop by as much as 80% if the clearance could be raised even a few inches. Another feature of the retrofit monitors truck weight—a safe speed for each truck on the 7% grades and curves just outside the tunnel is calculated and displayed for each driver.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Mario {{is invited}} to the centennial Star Festival by Princess Peach to {{celebrate}} the comet that passes overhead, Bowser invades the Mushroom Kingdom with a surprise attack in a fleet of airships.
