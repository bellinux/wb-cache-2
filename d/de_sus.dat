5|$|The revolt {{developed}} from local disturbances {{in the first}} half of 1437. The villagers from Daróc, Mákó and Türe (Dorolțu, Macău and Turea) assaulted the abbot of Kolozsmonostor at Bogártelke (Băgara) in March. In Alsó-Fehér County and around Déva (Deva), the serfs gathered into small bands and attacked the noblemen's manors. Peasants from Alparét and Bogáta (Bogata <b>de</b> <b>Sus)</b> were the first to settle on the top of the nearby Mount Bábolna in May or June. Being surrounded by high cliffs and dense forests and crowned by a plateau of about , the mountain was an ideal place for defence. Following the Taborites' military strategy, the rebels established a camp on the flat summit of the mountain.|$|E

25|$|It {{is assumed}} that Roman Dacia possessed {{a large number of}} {{military}} vici, settlements with connections to the entrenched military camps. This hypothesis has not been tested, as few such sites have been surveyed in any detail. However, in the mid-Mureș valley, associated civilian communities have been uncovered next to the auxiliary camps at Orăștioara <b>de</b> <b>Sus,</b> Cigmău, Salinae (modern Ocna Mureș), and Micia. A small amphitheatre was discovered at Micia.|$|E

Then there was a famous Spanish reworking of the French Prose Tristan, Libro del muy esforzado caballero Don Tristán de Leonís y <b>de</b> <b>sus</b> grandes hechos en armas first published in Valladolid in 1501, then republished in Seville in 1511, 1520, 1525, 1528, 1533 and 1534; additionally a second part, Tristan el Joven, was created which dealt with Tristan's son, Tristan of Leonis.|$|E
25|$|Argentine cinema {{has also}} been prominenent since {{the first half of}} the 20th century and today averages over 60 {{full-length}} titles yearly. The industry suffered during the 1976–1983 military dictatorship; but re-emerged to produce the Academy Award winner The Official Story in 1985. A wave of imported U.S. films again damaged the industry in the early 1990s, though it soon recovered, thriving even during the Argentine economic crisis around 2001. Many Argentine movies produced during recent years have been internationally acclaimed, including Nueve reinas (2000), Son of the Bride (2001), El abrazo partido (2004), El otro (2007), the 2010 Foreign Language Academy Award winner El secreto <b>de</b> <b>sus</b> ojos and Wild Tales (2014).|$|E

25|$|Romanian Orthodox monasteries {{and churches}} exist {{throughout}} Romania, but traditionally, few are constructed on a monumental scale. A {{great number of}} wooden churches are still intact in the Carpathian Mountains villages, but {{by far the most}} impressive are the Wooden Churches of Maramureş which push wood building technique to its limits. Byzantine influences can be found in most Romanian church buildings but domestic styles have evolved in different periods of time and in different regions. In Moldavia, a particular style was used {{in the construction of the}} monasteries, of which some of the most important are the churches of northern Moldavia - UNESCO World Heritage Sites, such as those of Moldoviţa, Putna, Suceviţa, or Voroneţ. In Wallachia, Curtea de Argeş Cathedral was built in a Byzantine style with Moorish influences, and a great number of churches show Greek influences, especially those built in the 18th century, such as Stavropoleos Church in central Bucharest. Romania also evolved the distinctive Brâncovenesc style: the monasteries of Snagov and of Sâmbăta <b>de</b> <b>Sus</b> in Transylvania are classical examples.|$|E
500|$|According to {{a record}} in the {{register}} of the Genoese colony in Caffa on the Black See, two Genoese envoys were sent to [...] "Constantino et Petro vayvoda" [...] in 1386. Historians identified Voivode Constantino with Costea, whom {{the list of the}} voivodes of Moldavia, recorded in the Bistrița Monastery, mentioned between Lațcu and Peter. The record in the Caffa register suggests that the two voivodes—Costea and Petru II Muşat—had the same position. The division of the medieval principality into two greater administrative units—Ţara <b>de</b> <b>Sus</b> ("Upper Country") and Ţara de Jos ("Lower Country")—each administered by a high official, the vornic, also implies the former existence of two polities, which were united by the Moldavian monarchs.|$|E

2500|$|The medieval Principality of Moldavia was {{established}} in 1359 and covered the so-called Carpathian–Danube–Dniester area, stretching from Transylvania {{in the west to}} the Dniester River in the east.
