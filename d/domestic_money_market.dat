40|$|The paper {{explores the}} {{measurement}} of monetary condition in Malaysia to augment the existing monetary policy framework. As an open economy, Monetary Condition Index (MCI) and Financial Condition Index (FCI) are applicable to understand the monetary condition especially {{in the era of}} financial deregulation and liberalisation. The results obtained suggest that the index is most useful when the exchange market exhibits stable conditions, and would be a constructive tool in the simultaneous management of the foreign currency and <b>domestic</b> <b>money</b> <b>markets.</b> However, the frequent experience of instability caused by supply and demand shocks with persistent and large inertia in the economy complicates the practical use of MCI and FCI in Malaysia.

40|$|The thesis studies how {{financial}} markets discipline commercial and central banks’ behavior in various ways. In the first part, two papers test {{different aspects of}} market discipline of commercial banks’ risk taking, using a dataset of several hundred banks worldwide. In the first paper, it is shown that the risk-shifting opportunity of shareholders introduced by deposit insurance depends on ownership structure {{and the extent of}} market discipline by uninsured creditors. I find that the effect of shareholder control on risk is convex, and that creditor discipline tempers this effect but has little individual influence on risk. The second paper tests the monitoring dimension of market discipline and formulates a two-step procedure which makes it possible to sidestep the common methodological problem that banks’ ‘true’ risk is unobserved. Results suggest that if the quality of institutions is sufficiently high, some market-based indicators may be more accurate measures of banks’ true risk than a set of commonly used accounting-based benchmark indicators – a possibility effectively precluded by much of previous research. In {{the second part of the}} thesis, three papers study constraints on central bank behavior introduced by {{financial markets}}, using data from a set of small, open European economies during the 1980 s and 1990 s. The first of these papers tests how capital account liberalization and exchange-rate regime constrain monetary policy autonomy. Contrary to traditional theory, the paper finds no autonomy effect of exchange rate flexibility, whereas capital controls provided some (albeit limited) independence from innovations in foreign <b>money</b> <b>market</b> interest rates. The remaining two papers address how deregulation, innovation, and growth in <b>domestic</b> <b>money</b> <b>markets</b> interplay with central banks’ choices of monetary policy operating procedures. The analysis of the European countries suggests that while deregulation and the emergence of short-term financial markets constrained central bank discretion and compelled increased reliance on open market operations, the paths of <b>money</b> <b>market</b> development in different countries were also partially determined by the respective central banks’ decisions. In the final paper, the same framework of analysis is applied to China, which has announced its intention to rely increasingly on market operations in monetary policy.

By developing a parsimonious and empirically stable error-correction model using quarterly observations, the paper finds that inflation is explained by changes in monetary aggregates, real output, foreign inflation, and the exchange rate. Long-run relationships in the money and traded-goods markets are found to exist, but only the disequilibrium from the money market exerts {{a significant impact on}} inflation.

40|$|The limited {{supply of}} {{government}} securities in some industrial countries has important ramifications for the operating techniques used by central banks to implement monetary policy, provide {{credit to the}} financial sector, and also for the assets they hold on their balance sheets. The paper reviews the salient facts regarding industrial central bank balance sheets and operating techniques, and outlines different options for dealing with a limited supply of government securities. The main conclusion is that central banks may wish to consider extending credit using {{a broad range of}} assets as collateral, and engage in outright transactions of securities guaranteed by financial institutions.

40|$|Emerging European {{countries}} have made large strides in developing their local capital markets since the early- 1990 s. However, {{the rate of}} development has been widely disparate across countries and market segments, underpinned by the varying degrees of progress made in key areas such as establishing pricing benchmarks, adopting, implementing and enforcing securities laws and regulations, encouraging the growth of an institutional investor base, and providing adequate trading infrastructure. This paper {{provides an overview of}} the trends in the region''s local capital markets, and examines the main factors that have contributed to their growth and effectiveness to date. It also discusses selected policy responses necessary to further improve the breadth and depth of these markets.

40|$|Monetary policy, {{at least}} in part, {{operates}} through both an interest rate and credit channel. The question arises, therefore, whether monetary policy is a less potent a device in affecting output and inflation in countries that have low levels of credit and where investment and consumption are not financed by borrowing in local currency. This paper employs a Panel Vector Auto Regression approach to examine the empirical evidence in a broad sample of emerging market countries. The data suggests that the effectiveness of changes in policy interest rates in influencing the path of inflation appear to be unrelated {{to the level of}} credit and that, instead, the willingness to allow exchange rate flexibility is a far more important determining factor.

The study noted that the Soludo’s reforms focused on strengthening the financial systems through banking sector consolidation, foreign exchange market stabilization, interest rates restructuring {{and the pursuit of}} stabilization as against structural adjustment policies for monetary and inflationary controls. A review of theoretical qualifications to the Soludo’s reform show that in thoughts, it is rooted in the Classical traditions of Say’s Law, acts monetarist, but expects a Keynesian outcome that money can stimulate expansion in aggregate domestic output. In concluding, the study noted the need to adopt an interest rate operating procedures for monetary policy in addition to moving the economy consciously towards the ‘law of one market and one price’ for the <b>domestic</b> and foreign <b>money</b> <b>markets.</b> ...|$|R
