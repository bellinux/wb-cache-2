40|$|INTRODUCTION: HOE- 140 / <b>Icatibant</b> is a selective, {{competitive}} antagonist to bradykinin (BK) {{against its}} binding to the kinin B 2 receptor. Substitution of five non-proteogeneic amino acid analogues makes <b>icatibant</b> resistant to degradation by metalloproteases of kinin catabolism. <b>Icatibant</b> has clinical applications in inflammatory and vascular leakage conditions {{caused by an}} acute (non-controlled) production of kinins and their accumulation at the endothelium B 2 receptor. The clinical manifestation of vascular leakage, called angioedema (AE), is characterized by edematous attacks of subcutaneous and submucosal tissues, which can cause painful intestinal consequences, and life-threatening complications if affecting the larynx. <b>Icatibant</b> is registered {{for the treatment of}} acute attacks of the hereditary BK-mediated AE, i. e., AE due to C 1 inhibitor deficiency. AREAS COVERED: This review discusses emerging knowledge on the kinin system: kinin pharmacological properties, biochemical characteristics of the contact phase and kinin catabolism proteases. It underlines the responsibility of the kinins in AE initiation and the potency of <b>icatibant</b> to inhibit AE formation by kinin-receptor interactions. EXPERT OPINION: <b>Icatibant</b> antagonist properties protect BK-mediated AE patients against severe attacks, and could be developed for use in inflammatory conditions.

40|$|Background: ACE inhibitor-induced {{angioedema}} is a rare, yet potentially fatal, drug side effect. Considering nearly 40 {{million people}} are taking ACE inhibitors for their anti-hypertensive and renal-protective benefits, {{a significant number of}} patients are at risk for this drug-induced angioedema. This review was performed to evaluate the efficacy of <b>icatibant</b> as treatment for ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema. Strength of evidence was evaluated using the GRADE tool. Method: An exhaustive search of available medical literature was conducted using Medline, PubMed, ISI Web of Science, EBM Reviews Multifile, and CINAHL. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied. At the time of this review, no randomized control trials were published; therefore, this review focuses on case reports. Results: During the exhaustive literature search, only two case reports were found regarding the use of <b>icatibant</b> as treatment for ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema. Both studies included in the review showed substantial reduction in time to complete resolution of symptoms from ACE inhibitor angioedema using <b>icatibant</b> as compared to standard therapy. Only local-site reactions of erythema and pruritus were evident as side-effects from <b>icatibant</b> therapy. Conclusion: Despite the small sample size of the studies, the overall Moderate GRADE outcome, and the limited statistical significance from these observational reports, <b>icatibant</b> appears to dramatically reduce time to: 1) first symptom improvement, and 2) complete symptom resolution of angioedema, as compared to standard therapy.

OBJECTIVE: To assess whether the selective bradykinin receptor- 2 antagonist <b>Icatibant</b> is effective in acute edema attacks of hereditary angioedema. METHODS: In this uncontrolled pilot study, 15 patients with 20 attacks were treated with <b>Icatibant.</b> The attacks were analyzed by using a standardized and validated visual analog scale measurement and compared with historical data of untreated attacks. Plasma bradykinin concentration was measured before and 4 hours after intravenous <b>Icatibant</b> treatment. RESULTS: Symptom intensity decreased within 4 hours after administration of Icatibant; the median time to onset of symptom relief was 1. 50, 1. 42, and 1. 13 hours in the intravenous groups and 0. 58 and 0. 45 hours in the subcutaneous groups, respectively. The median difference in the 10 -cm visual analog scale 4 hours after start of treatment was 4. 11 cm (95 % CI, 1. 72 - 6. 07). Compared with untreated attacks, <b>Icatibant</b> treatment reduced the mean (SD) time to onset of symptom relief by 97 % from 42 +/- 14 to 1. 16 +/- 0. 95 hours (all groups combined).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Attacks of {{hereditary}} angioedema (HAE) are unpredictable and, if {{affecting the}} upper airway, can be lethal. <b>Icatibant</b> {{is used for}} physician- or patient self-administered symptomatic treatment of HAE attacks in adults.

OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the impact of}} timing of <b>icatibant</b> administration on the duration and resolution of HAE type I and II attacks. METHODS: The <b>Icatibant</b> Outcome Survey is an international, prospective, observational study for patients treated with <b>icatibant.</b> Data on timings and outcomes of <b>icatibant</b> treatment for HAE attacks were collected between July 2009 -February 2012. A mixed-model of repeated measures was performed for 426 attacks in 136 HAE type I and II patients. RESULTS: Attack duration was significantly shorter in patients treated < 1 hour of attack onset compared with those treated ≥ 1 hour (6. 1 hours versus 16. 8 hours [p< 0. 001]). Similar significant effects were observed for < 2 hours versus ≥ 2 hours (7. 2 hours versus 20. 2 hours [p< 0. 001]) and < 5 hours versus ≥ 5 hours (8. 0 hours versus 23. 5 hours [p< 0. 001]). Treatment within 1 hour of attack onset also significantly reduced time to attack resolution (5. 8 hours versus 8. 8 hours [p< 0. 05]).

Results: One center in Grenoble contributed 22 patients with HAE-nC 1 INH and {{a family history of}} HAE while 15 centers across France contributed 153 patients with HAE type I and seven patients with HAE type II. Patients with HAE-nC 1 INH compared to HAE type I, respectively, {{were more likely to be}} female (88. 1 % vs. 63. 4 %), older at median age of disease onset (21 years vs. 15 years), and have a greater rate of abdominal (80 % vs. 61 %) and laryngeal (23 % vs. 14 %) attacks. <b>Icatibant</b> was effective in both groups though the median time to resolution of attack was significantly longer in the HAE-nC 1 INH group (20. 0 h, 37 attacks) versus the HAE type I group (14. 0 h, 67 attacks). <b>Icatibant</b> was self-administered for 96. 1 % of attacks in patients with HAE-nC 1 INH and 75. 8 % in patients with HAE type I. No serious adverse side effects related to <b>icatibant</b> were reported. Conclusions: These data help further define the disease characteristics of HAE-nC 1 INH in the French population and extend the limited data reporting the safe and effective use of <b>icatibant</b> in acute treatment of angioedema in French patients diagnosed with HAE-nC 1 INH...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the case of}} a 75 -year-old woman who presented with massive tongue and lip swelling secondary to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced angioedema. An awake fibre-optic intubation was performed because of impending airway obstruction. As there was no improvement in symptoms after 72 hours, the selective bradykinin B 2 receptor antagonist <b>icatibant</b> (Firazyr) was administered and the patient’s trachea was successfully extubated 36 hours later. To our knowledge this is the first documented case of <b>icatibant</b> being used for the treatment of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced angioedema in the United Kingdom and represents a novel therapeutic option in its management...|$|E
40|$|Our {{aim was to}} {{determine}} if antigen challenge stimulates sensory nerves and provokes the release of tachykinins. The involvement of histamine and bradykinin was studied by using specific receptor antagonists. Capsaicin-induced responses were also examined. Experiments were performed in vitro on tracheal and bronchial preparations from ovalbumin-sensitized guinea-pigs. Characterization of ovalbumin-induced contraction, with regard to histamine and bradykinin, was carried out on airway ring preparations in the presence of phosphoramidon. The histamine H 1 receptor antagonist pyrilamine reduced allergen-induced bronchial contractions by about 30 %, whereas the bradykinin B 2 receptor antagonist <b>icatibant</b> (Hoe 140) did not significantly affect the response. Combined treatment with pyrilamine (1 [*]μM) and <b>icatibant</b> (0. 1 [*]μM) reduced the contractions by about 80 %, indicating a synergistic inhibitory action. Tracheal preparations were not significantly affected by treatments, neither were capsaicin-induced contractions. To study the outflow of tachykinins, we used a perfused bronchial-tube preparation, allowing simultaneous measurement of smooth muscle tension and mediator release. Neurokinin A-like immunoreactivity (NKA-LI) and substance P-like immunoreactivity (SP-LI) were determined by radioimmunoassay. The results of the perfusion study showed an increased outflow of NKA-LI into the perfusate in response to ovalbumin (127 % of basal) challenge. SP-LI determined in some of the samples showed a much lower amount (40 to 70 times lower) of SP-LI than NKA-LI. Treatment with <b>icatibant</b> and pyrilamine, separately and in combination, significantly reduced the ovalbumin-induced NKA-LI outflow by 38 %, 26 % and 22 %, respectively. Capsaicin-induced outflow (124 % of basal) was not significantly affected by treatments (<b>icatibant</b> 121 %, pyrilamine 107 % and combined treatment 111 % of basal). However, when pyrilamine was present the increased outflow was not statistically significant. In conclusion, we found that allergen provocation of guinea-pig bronchi caused an increased outflow of NKA-LI that was reduced by treatment with both pyrilamine and <b>icatibant.</b> These findings demonstrate that the allergen-induced release of histamine and bradykinin stimulate sensory nerves and thereby increase outflow of tachykinins that contribute to the allergic reaction...|$|E
40|$|Kinin B 2 {{receptor}} antagonists or tissue kallikrein (t-KK) inhibitors prevent {{oedema formation}} and associated sequelae in caerulein-induced pancreatitis in the rat. We have now further investigated {{the mechanism of}} kinin generation in the pancreas. Kinins were elevated in the pancreatic tissue already before oedema formation became manifest. Peak values (421 ± 59 pmol g− 1 dry wt) were reached at 45 min and remained elevated for at least 2 h; a second increase was observed at 24 h. Pretreatment with the B 2 receptor antagonist <b>icatibant</b> abolished kinin formation, while post-treatment was ineffective. Total kininogen levels were very low in the pancreas of controls, but increased 75 -fold during acute pancreatitis. This increase was absent in rats that were pretreated with <b>icatibant.</b> During pancreatitis, t-KK-like and plasma kallikrein (p-KK) -like activity in the pancreas, as well as trypsinogen activation peptide (TAP) increased significantly. <b>Icatibant</b> pretreatment further augmented t-KK about 100 -fold, while p-KK was significantly attenuated; TAP levels remained unaffected. Endogenous protease inhibitors (α 1 -antitrypsin, α 2 -macroglobulin) were low in normal tissues, but increased 45 - and four-fold, respectively, during pancreatitis. This increase was abolished when oedema formation was prevented by <b>icatibant.</b> In summary, oedema formation is initiated by t-KK; the ensuing plasma protein extravasation supplies further kininogen and active p-KK to the tissue. Concomitantly, endogenous protease inhibitors in the oedema fluid inhibit up to 99 % of active t-KK. Our data thus suggest a complex interaction between kinin action and kinin generation involving positive and negative feedback actions of the inflammatory oedema...|$|E
40|$|Aasia Ghazi, J Andrew GrantUniversity of Texas Medical Branch, Division of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Galveston, TX, USAAbstract: Hereditary {{angioedema}} (HAE) is an autosomal dominant, potentially life-threatening condition, manifesting as recurrent and self-limiting {{episodes of}} facial, laryngeal, genital, or peripheral swelling with abdominal pain secondary to intra-abdominal edema. The estimated prevalence of HAE {{in the general}} population is one individual per 50, 000, with reported ranges from 1 : 10, 000 to 1 : 150, 000, without major sex or ethnic differences. Various treatment options for acute attacks and prophylaxis of HAE are authorized and available in the market, including plasma-derived (Berinert®, Cinryze®, and Cetor®) and recombinant (Rhucin® and Ruconest™) C 1 inhibitors, kallikrein inhibitor-ecallantide (Kalbitor®), and bradykinin B 2 receptor antagonist-icatibant (Firazyr®). Some of these drugs are used only to treat HAE attacks, whereas others are only approved for prophylactic therapies and all of them have improved disease outcomes due to their different mechanisms of action. Bradykinin and its binding to B 2 receptor have been demonstrated to be responsible for most of the symptoms of HAE. Thus <b>icatibant</b> (Firazyr®), a bradykinin B 2 receptor antagonist, has proven to be an effective and more targeted treatment option and has been approved for the treatment of acute attacks of HAE. Rapid and stable relief from symptoms of cutaneous, abdominal, or laryngeal HAE attacks has been demonstrated by 30 mg of <b>icatibant</b> in Phase III clinical trials. Self-resolving mild to moderate local site reactions after subcutaneous injection of <b>icatibant</b> were observed. <b>Icatibant</b> is a new, safe, and effective treatment for acute attacks of HAE. HAE has been reported to result in enormous humanistic burden to patients, affecting both physical and mental health, with a negative impact on education, career, and work productivity, and with substantial economic burdens. The timely and proper use of disease-specific treatments could improve patients&# 39; quality of life, reduce the disease-specific morbidity and mortality, and, last but not least, reduce costs associated with hospitalizations and emergency room visits. Therefore, the paradigm of HAE treatment has the potential to evolve significantly, thereby exponentially improving a patient’s quality of life.
