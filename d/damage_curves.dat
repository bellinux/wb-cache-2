40|$|Abstract: The {{incremental}} {{dynamic analysis}} {{is a powerful}} tool for evaluating the seismic vulnerability and risk of build-ings. It allows calculating the global damage of structures for different PGAs and representing this result by means of <b>damage</b> <b>curves.</b> Such curves are used by many methods to obtain seismic risk scenarios at urban level. Even if the use of this method in a probabilistic environment requires a relevant computational effort, it should be the reference method for seismic risk evaluation. In this article we propose to assess the seismic expected damage by using nonlinear dynamic analysis. We will obtain <b>damage</b> <b>curves</b> by means of the incremental dynamic analysis combined with the damage index of Park & Ang. The uncertainties related to the mechanical properties of the materials and the seismic action will be con-sidered. The probabilistic <b>damage</b> <b>curves</b> obtained can be used to calculate not only seismic risk scenarios at urban level, but also to estimate economic losses...|$|E
40|$|To gain an {{estimate}} of the building damage induced by potentially hazardous events, an engineering methodology based on physical modelling is presented. The method allows the qualitative assessment of the possible overall building damage level derived from the initial damage to discrete structural members. For this, <b>damage</b> <b>curves</b> were derived for various construction types that establish the gradual building damage level in dependence of a structural member damage index. Based on the damage level of structural members subjected to an extreme event, the building <b>damage</b> <b>curves</b> were derived using the iterative load factor method applied to various construction types. To calculate the respective remaining capacity, the initial structural member damage was modeled by modifying the material characteristics in each respective FE model accordingly. The form of the <b>damage</b> <b>curves</b> was validated on detailed and sophisticated hydrocode simulations as well as on experimental results. Compared to other methodologies used today, which establish a building damage level based on empirical data, the method presented here has the advantage that the individual member damages leading to the total building damage are identified and comprehensively calculated during the evaluation process, such that potentially applicable structural enhancement measures can be planned in a targeted and efficient manner...|$|E
40|$|Assessing {{potential}} damage of flood events {{is an important}} component in flood risk management. Determining direct flood damage is commonly done using depth-damage curves, which denote the flood damage that would occur at specific water depths per asset or per land-use class. Many countries have developed flood damage models using depth-damage curves based on analysis of past flood events and on expert judgement. However, the fact that such <b>damage</b> <b>curves</b> are not available for all regions hampers damage assessments in some areas. Moreover, due to different methodologies employed for various damage models in different countries, damage assessments cannot be directly compared with each other, obstructing also supra-national flood damage assessments. To address these problems a globally consistent database of depth-damage curves has been developed. This dataset contains <b>damage</b> <b>curves</b> depicting fractional damage function of water depth as well as maximum damage values for a variety of assets and land use classes. Based on an extensive literature survey concave <b>damage</b> <b>curves</b> have been developed for each continent, while differentiation in flood damage between countries is established by determining maximum damage values at the country scale. These maximum damage values are based on construction cost surveys from multinational construction companies, which provide a coherent set of detailed building cost data across dozens of countries. A consistent set of maximum flood damage values for all countries was computed using statistical regressions with socio-economic World Development Indicators. Further, based on insights from the literature survey, guidance is also given on how the <b>damage</b> <b>curves</b> and maximum damage values can be adjusted for specific local circumstances, such as urban vs. rural locations or use of specific building material. This dataset can be used for consistent supra-national scale flood damage assessments, and guide assessment in countries where no damage model is currently available. JRC.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{program was}} conducted to study the damaging effects of tensile and compressive prestrains on the fatigue life of nickel-base, Inconel 718 superalloy at room temperature. To establish baseline fatigue behavior, virgin specimens with a solid uniform gage section were fatigued to failure under fully-reversed strain-control. Additional specimens were prestrained to 2 percent, 5 percent, and 10 percent (engineering strains) in the tensile direction and to 2 percent (engineering strain) in the compressive direction under stroke-control, and were subsequently fatigued to failure under fully-reversed strain-control. Experimental results are compared with estimates of remaining fatigue lives (after prestraining) using three life prediction approaches: (1) the Linear Damage Rule; (2) the Linear Strain and Life Fraction Rule; and (3) the nonlinear <b>Damage</b> <b>Curve</b> Approach.

40|$|Simple {{procedures}} are given for treating cumulative fatigue damage under complex loading history using either the <b>damage</b> <b>curve</b> concept or the double linear damage rule. A single equation is given {{for use with}} the <b>damage</b> <b>curve</b> approach; each loading event providing a fraction of damage until failure is presumed to occur when the damage sum becomes unity. For the double linear damage rule, analytical expressions are given for determining the two phases of life. The procedure comprises two steps, each similar to the conventional application of the commonly used linear damage rule. Once the sum of cycle ratios based on Phase I lives reaches unity, Phase I is presumed complete, and further loadings are summed as cycle ratios based on Phase II lives. When the Phase II sum attains unity, failure is presumed to occur. It is noted that no physical properties or material constants other than those normally used in a conventional linear damage rule analysis are required for application of {{either of the two}} cumulative damage methods described.

The percentage of leaf area and number of fruits damaged were estimated and those variables were used to construct a <b>damage</b> <b>curve.</b> The plants exposed at infestation levels between 6 and 10 females presented the highest percentages of leaf area consumed (between 27 and 43 %), damage on fruits (between 45 and 100 %), and loss of apical leaves in comparison with the treatments with two and four females/plants. The height, number of internodes, number of leaves and leaflets, number and biomass of fruits were differentially affected by the densities of T. absoluta infestation (P â‰¤ 0. 05).

The main objective of this work is to produce <b>damage</b> <b>curves</b> for roads, railways and detached houses for these towns. However, in the LillestrÃ¸m area, with fewer significant data, <b>damage</b> <b>curves</b> were produced only for roads and railways. A risk analyses was made by connecting a flood frequency analysis, geographical information and cost data from the big flood in 1995. Due {{to the lack of}} sufficient cost data, more focus was given to the uncertainties of the analyses rather than the actual results. The results showed that the expected damage (risk) from flooding for all the detached houses in the Hamar region was 12 million NOK. The expected damage (risk) from flooding railways and roads are 37 375 NOK and 280 800 NOK, respectively. In LillestrÃ¸m the expected damage (risk) from flooding railways and roads was equally to zero, due to the huge flood protection works in this area.

Additionally, the evaluation of the applicability and reliability of the nonlinear static procedures has been performed and, some simple modifications, oriented to improve their use, have been proposed.

40|$|Laser optics {{being used}} in space laser systems are usually exposed to high vacuum {{conditions}} under the absence of air or oxygen. In the past, several space-based laser missions have suffered from anomalous performance loss or even failure after short operation times. To mitigate the risks involved in these long-term operational conditions, a laser damage test bench has been developed and is operated at the German Aerospace Establishment to test laser optics in the IR, VIS, and in the UV spectral range. The testing is performed under application oriented conditions, i. e. under high-vacuum using dry pump systems. The main goal of the test campaign is to identify the critical components {{in terms of their}} laser damage threshold for very high pulse numbers applied per site. Characteristic <b>damage</b> <b>curves</b> according to ISO 11 254 are evaluated for each component under investigation for up to 10 000 shots per site.

40|$|In the {{framework}} of the European SCenarios for tsunami Hazard-induced Emergencies MAnagement (SCHEMA) project (www. schemaproject. org), we empirically developed new tsunami damage functions to be used for quantifying the potential tsunami damage to buildings along European-Mediterranean coasts. Since no sufficient post-tsunami observations exist in the Mediterranean areas, we based our work on data collected by several authors in Banda Aceh (Indonesia) after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. Obviously, special attention has been paid in focusing on Indonesian buildings which present similarities (in structure, construction material, number of storeys) with the building typologies typical of the European-Mediterranean areas. An important part of the work consisted in analyzing, merging, and interpolating the post-disaster observations published by three independent teams in order to obtain the spatial distribution of flow depths necessary to link the flow-depth hazard parameter to the damage level observed on buildings. Then we developed fragility curves (showing the cumulative probability to have, for each flow depth, a damage level equal-to or greater-than a given threshold) and <b>damage</b> <b>curves</b> (giving the expected damage level) for different classes of buildings. It appears that <b>damage</b> <b>curves</b> based on the weighted mean damage level and the maximum flow depth are the most appropriate for producing, under GIS, expected damage maps for different tsunami scenarios...|$|E

The likelihood of damage in 2100 to four representative economic <b>damage</b> <b>curves</b> and four biophysical <b>damage</b> <b>curves</b> according to global mean warming in 2100 is assessed for a range of emissions futures.

By accounting for the range of plausible risks, the benefit of mitigation can be substantial for even small reductions in emissions. Disparate impacts calibrated across multiple metrics can be displayed in a common format, allowing monetary and non-monetary impacts and benefits to be assessed within a single framework.

Theoretical investigation on this problem is complex as it involves non-linear inelastic material properties, effect of time varying strain rates, uncertainties of blast load calculations and the time-dependent structural deformations. Experimental investigation can provide valuable data for locating the damage and establishing the damage criteria. The <b>damage</b> <b>curves</b> generated from the extensive experimental study can provide quick assessment of the structural status. However, such blast experiments always involve safety concern and can be beyond the affordability. Besides this, the correlation of the experimental data with predictive method is difficult since it requires {{a large number of}} tests to generate <b>damage</b> <b>curves.</b> Compared with the theoretical and experimental study, numerical simulation does not involve any safety concern and is cost-effective.

40|$|Due to the {{increased}} occurrence of flooding events in urban areas, many procedures for flood damage quantification have been defined in recent decades. The lack of large databases in most cases is overcome by combining the output of urban drainage models and <b>damage</b> <b>curves</b> linking flooding to expected damage. The application of advanced hydraulic models as diagnostic, design and decision-making support tools has become a standard practice in hydraulic research and application. Flooding damage functions are usually evaluated by a priori estimation of potential damage (based {{on the value of}} exposed goods) or by interpolating real damage data (recorded during historical flooding events). Hydraulic models have undergone continuous advancements, pushed forward by increasing computer capacity. The details of the flooding propagation process on the surface and the details of the interconnections between underground and surface drainage systems have been studied extensively in recent years, resulting in progressively more reliable models. The same level of was advancement has not been reached with regard to <b>damage</b> <b>curves,</b> for which improvements are highly connected to data availability; this remains the main bottleneck in the expected flooding damage estimation. Such functions are usually affected by significant uncertainty intrinsically related to the collected data and to the simplified structure of the adopted functional relationships. The present paper aimed to evaluate this uncertainty by comparing the intrinsic uncertainty connected to the construction of the damage-depth function to the hydraulic model uncertainty. In this way, the paper sought to evaluate the role of hydraulic model detail level in the wider context of flood damage estimation. This paper demonstrated that the use of detailed hydraulic models might not be justified because of the higher computational cost and the significant uncertainty in damage estimation curves.

We characterize optimal cap-and-trade regulation with a price cap and a price floor, and {{compare it to the}} special cases of pure taxation and a simple emissions cap. Innovation shifts the tradeoff between price- and quantity-based instruments towards quantity-based emissions trading schemes. More specifically, an increase in innovation effectiveness lowers the optimal emissions cap, and leads to relaxed price controls unless the slope of the marginal environmental <b>damage</b> <b>curve</b> is small. Because of the decrease in the emissions cap, innovation in abatement technologies can lead to a higher expected carbon price, so as to provide sufficient incentives for private R&D investments. The expected carbon price decreases once innovative technologies are widely used.

40|$|A {{model of}} {{cumulative}} creep-fatigue {{damage has been}} developed {{which is based on}} the use of <b>damage</b> <b>curve</b> equations to describe the evolution of creep-fatigue damage for four basic creep-fatigue cycle types. These cycle types correspond to the four fundamental cycles of the Strain Range Partitioning Life Prediction approach of Manson, Halford, and Hirschberg. A concept referred to as Damage Coupling is introduced to analytically account for the differences {{in the nature of the}} damage introduced by each cycle type. For application of this model, the cumulative creep-fatigue damage behavior of type 316 stainless steel at 816 C has been experimentally established for the two-level loading cases involving fatigue and creep-fatigue, in various permutations. The tests were conducted such that the lower life (high strain) cycling was applied first, for a controlled number of cycles, and the higher life (lower strain) cycling was conducted at the second level, to failure. The proposed model correlated the majority of the observed cumulative creep-fatigue data...|$|R
40|$|Nanosecond {{single and}} {{multiple}} pulse laser damage studies on HfO 2 /SiO 2 high-reflective coatings were performed at 1064 nm. The evolution of LIDT and 100 % damage probability threshold under multiple irradiations revealed that fatigue effects {{were affected by}} both laser fluence and shot numbers. And the <b>damage</b> probability <b>curves</b> exhibiting different behaviors confirmed experimentally that this fatigue effect of the dielectric coatings was due to material modification rather than statistical effects. By using a model assuming Gaussian distribution of defect threshold, the fitting results of LID probability curves indicated the turning point appeared in the <b>damage</b> probability <b>curves</b> under large shot number irradiations was just {{the representation of the}} existence of newly created defects. The thresholds of these newly created defects were exponential decrease with irradiated shot numbers. Besides, a new kind of damage morphologies under multiple shot irradiations were characterized to further expose the fatigue effect caused by cumulative laser-induced material modifications.
