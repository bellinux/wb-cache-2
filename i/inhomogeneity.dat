Input impedance characteristics of low impedance <b>inhomogeneities.</b> Dependences of input impedance active and reactive parts of EC- and traditional <b>inhomogeneities</b> are given.

40|$|We {{suggest the}} {{statistical}} spectral theory of oscillations in quasi-optical cavity resonator filled with random <b>inhomogeneities.</b> It is shown that <b>inhomogeneities</b> in the resonator result in intermode scattering {{leading to the}} shift and broadening of spectral lines.

2500|$|The precessing nuclei {{can also}} {{fall out of}} {{alignment}} with each other (returning the net magnetization vector to a non-precessing field) and stop producing a signal. This is called T2 or transverse relaxation. Because {{of the difference in}} the actual relaxation mechanisms involved (for example, intermolecular versus intramolecular magnetic dipole-dipole interactions [...] ), T1 is usually (except in rare cases) longer than T2 (that is, slower spin-lattice relaxation, for example because of smaller dipole-dipole interaction effects). In practice, the value of T2* which is the actually observed decay time of the observed NMR signal, or free induction decay (to [...] of the initial amplitude immediately after the resonant RF pulse), also depends on the static magnetic field <b>inhomogeneity,</b> which is quite significant. (There is also a smaller but significant contribution to the observed FID shortening from the RF <b>inhomogeneity</b> of the resonant pulse). In the corresponding FT-NMR spectrum—meaning the Fourier transform of the free induction decay—the T2* time is inversely related to the width of the NMR signal in frequency units. Thus, a nucleus with a long T2 relaxation time gives rise to a very sharp NMR peak in the FT-NMR spectrum for a very homogeneous ("well-shimmed") static magnetic field, whereas nuclei with shorter T2 values give rise to broad FT-NMR peaks even when the magnet is shimmed well. Both T1 and T2 depend on the rate of molecular motions as well as the gyromagnetic ratios of both the resonating and their strongly interacting, next-neighbor nuclei that are not at resonance.|$|E
