5000|$|An electrophoretic {{mobility}} shift assay (EMSA) or mobility shift electrophoresis, {{also referred}} as a gel shift assay, gel mobility shift assay, band shift assay, or <b>gel</b> <b>retardation</b> <b>assay,</b> {{is a common}} affinity electrophoresis technique used to study protein-DNA or protein-RNA interactions. This procedure can determine if a protein or mixture of proteins is capable of binding to a given DNA or RNA sequence, and can sometimes indicate if more than one protein molecule {{is involved in the}} binding complex. Gel shift assays are often performed in vitro concurrently with DNase footprinting, primer extension, and promoter-probe experiments when studying transcription initiation, DNA replication, DNA repair or RNA processing and maturation. Although precursors can be found in earlier literature, most current assays are based on methods described by Garner and Revzin [...] and Fried and Crothers.|$|E

We found that upon deletion of a single enhancer element, transcription of the upstream and downstream rRNA gene was reduced by about 50 %. Although removing both flanking enhancers of an rRNA gene led to a further reduction in transcription levels, {{a significant amount of}} transcriptional activity remained, either resulting from the influence of more distantly located enhancer elements or reflecting the basal activity of the polymerase I promoter within the nucleolus. Despite the reduction of transcriptional activity upon enhancer deletion, the activation frequency (proportion of nonnucleosomal to nucleosomal gene copies in a given cell culture) of the tagged rRNA genes was not significantly altered, as determined by the psoralen <b>gel</b> <b>retardation</b> <b>assay.</b> This is a strong indication that, within the nucleolus, the yeast rDNA enhancer functions by increasing transcription rates of active rRNA genes and not by activating silent transcription units...|$|E

In Streptomyces albus, various transcriptional repressors mediate the induction of heat shock genes.

Pi has dual roles, activating replication at low levels and inhibiting replication at high levels. The inhibitory function of pi is counteracted by integration host factor and a specific {{sequence of the}} origin called the enhancer. This 106 -bp DNA segment contains a binding site for DnaA protein (DnaA box 1). In this study, we mutated this site to determine if it was required for the enhancer's function.

40|$|The {{product of}} the {{retinoblastoma}} tumor suppressor gene interacts with the transcription factor E 2 F. Two distinct types of interactions can be detected between the retinoblastoma gene product (Rb) and E 2 F. The first type involves an Rb-binding protein, RBP 60. The Rb/E 2 F complex formed {{in the presence of}} RBP 60 is able to bind DNA and migrates with a distinct mobility in <b>gel</b> <b>retardation</b> <b>assays.</b> The second type of Rb/E 2 F complex is seen in the absence of RBP 60. This second type of Rb/E 2 F complex does not form a band-shift complex in <b>gel</b> <b>retardation</b> <b>assays</b> and its formation results in an apparent inhibition or loss of the DNA binding activity of E 2 F. Using a series of Rb-mutants we show that these two types of Rb/E 2 F complexes depend on common domains of the Rb protein. The T/E 1 A-binding region as well as the carboxyl-terminus of the Rb protein are critical for these two types of Rb/E 2 F interactions. We also show that the retinoblastoma protein represses the E 2 F-dependent transcription, and this Rb-repression of the E 2 F-dependent transcription depends on the ability of Rb to interact with E 2 F. Moreover, the adenovirus E 1 A gene product, which binds Rb, counteracts the Rb-repression and restores E 2 F-dependent transcription...|$|R

Thus, the DNA binding domain was defined to be the region from residue A 80 to the C-terminus. Sequential nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) connectivities and those of medium ranges revealed that the region of residues Q 60 –R 93 in mutant protein H-NS 60 – 137 forms a long stretch of disordered, flexible chain, and also showed that the structure of the C-terminal region (residues A 95 –Q 137) in mutant H-NS 60 – 137 was nearly identical to that of H-NS 91 – 137. 1 H and 15 N chemical shift perturbations induced by complex formation of H-NS 60 – 137 with an oligonucleotide duplex 14 -mer demonstrated that two loop regions, i. e. residues A 80 –K 96 and T 110 –A 117, play an essential role in DNA binding...|$|E
