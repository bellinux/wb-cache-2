Olbermann thanked viewers, producers, and technical staff for his show's eight-year success. However, he did not thank Griffin or NBC News president Steve Capus. Neither Olbermann nor MSNBC divulged {{the reason for the}} cancellation. Many liberal bloggers and commentators blamed the cable operator Comcast for Olbermann's departure, accusing the company of silencing the host for political purposes just days after acquiring NBC Universal on January 18. Statements from MSNBC and Comcast denied this allegation. Media critic <b>Howard</b> <b>Kurtz,</b> former MSNBC anchor David Shuster, and an anonymous NBC executive said that Olbermann's 2010 suspension was a more likely precipitating factor in Countdowns cancellation.|$|E

Six days after, CNN's Reliable Sources featured a discussion of The Colbert Report by host <b>Howard</b> <b>Kurtz,</b> who played a clip of Colbert's definition. On the same day, ABC's Nightline also reported on truthiness, prompting Colbert to respond by saying: [...] "You know what was missing from that piece? Me. Stephen Colbert. But I'm not surprised.

500|$|Additionally, some {{media outlets}} were criticized for lionizing Reagan without paying equal {{attention}} to more controversial decisions made during his administration. Thomas Kunkel, {{dean of the}} University of Maryland, College Park's journalism college, wrote in A magazine that the coverage [...] "would have you believe that Reagan was a cross between Abe Lincoln and Mother Teresa, with an overlay of Mister Rogers." [...] <b>Howard</b> <b>Kurtz,</b> The Washington Posts media columnist, said Reagan was [...] "a far more controversial figure in his time than the largely gushing obits on television would suggest."

500|$|The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune {{covered the}} dinner, but not Colbert's remarks. The wire {{services}} Reuters and the Associated Press each devoted three paragraphs to discuss Colbert's routine in their {{coverage of the}} event, and The Washington Post mentioned Colbert several times throughout its article. The most extensive print coverage came from USA Today, which dedicated more space to Colbert's performance than to President Bush's skit. [...] The day after the dinner, <b>Howard</b> <b>Kurtz</b> played clips of Colbert's performance on his CNN show Reliable Sources. On the Fox News show Fox & Friends, the hosts mentioned Colbert's performance, criticizing him for going [...] "over the line".

500|$|Some media commentators, such as <b>Howard</b> <b>Kurtz</b> and Toby Harnden, criticized {{what they}} {{perceived}} as {{a rush to judgment}} about the shooter's motivation, disputing suggestions that the shooting {{was the result of the}} Tea Party movement or anything in connection to Palin. Paul Krugman wrote an op-ed piece arguing that political rhetoric had become toxic. With renewed calls to tone down political rhetoric after the shooting, Keith Olbermann said, [...] "Violence, or the threat of violence, has no place in our Democracy, and I apologize for and repudiate any act or any thing in my past that may have even inadvertently encouraged violence." [...] Jon Stewart stated that he did not know whether or not the political environment contributed to the shooting, but, [...] "For all the hyperbole and vitriol that's become a part of our political process—when the reality of that rhetoric, when actions match the disturbing nature of words, we haven't lost our capacity to be horrified. ... Maybe it helps us to remember to match our rhetoric with reality more often." ...|$|E
500|$|News of the April {{meetings}} between the senators and the FHLBB officials {{first appeared in}} National Thrift News in September 1987, but was only sporadically covered by the general media {{for the next year}} and a half. In early 1988, The Detroit News ran a story on Riegle's participation, which Riegle responded to on Meet the Press by denying an interceding on Lincoln's behalf, before returning Keating's campaign contributions back to him. In spring 1988, the Los Angeles Times ran a short piece in their business section, but their political reporters did not follow up on it; two isolated, inside page mentions by The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal similarly failed to develop further. As media critic <b>Howard</b> <b>Kurtz</b> would later write, [...] "the saga of Charles Keating took years to penetrate the national consciousness." [...] The political fortunes of the senators involved did not suffer at this time. During the 1988 U.S. presidential election, McCain was mentioned by the press as a vice-presidential running mate for Republican nominee George H. W. Bush, while Glenn was one of the two vice-presidential finalists in Michael Dukakis' selection process, losing out to Lloyd Bentsen.|$|E

500|$|The {{day after}} McCain announced, Bush {{made a show}} of visiting Phoenix and {{displaying}} that he, not McCain, had the endorsement of Arizona Governor Jane Dee Hull and several other prominent local political figures. [...] McCain did have the support {{of the rest of the}} Republican Arizona congressional delegation. [...] Hull would continue to attack McCain during the campaign, and was featured in high-profile Arizona Republic and New York Times stories about McCain's reputation for having a bad temper, with the latter featuring on-the-record criticism from Governor of Michigan John Engler. [...] By early November, stories about McCain's temper problem were frequent enough that Washington Post media critic <b>Howard</b> <b>Kurtz</b> wrote a survey article about them. [...] Some of McCain's opponents, including those in or close to the Senate Republican leadership, intimated that McCain's temper was a sign of mental instability. [...] The notion that this was due to McCain's POW days caused Admiral James Stockdale, a fellow former POW and 1992 vice-presidential candidate for Ross Perot, to write an op-ed piece for The New York Times, [...] "John McCain in the Crucible". In it, Stockdale said that the reverse was true: that the experience of resisting during the POW experience made former POWs more emotionally stable in later life, not less. [...] In early December, McCain released some 1,500pages of his medical and psychiatric records, which showed several psychiatric evaluations over a number of years following his POW release that indicated no signs of lingering mental or emotional difficulty from that period.|$|E
500|$|Others saw no {{intentional}} snub of Colbert by the press. Responding to {{a question}} about why The Washington Posts article about the dinner did not go into any detail about Colbert's speech, Media Backtalk writer <b>Howard</b> <b>Kurtz</b> responded, [...] "The problem in part is one of deadline. The presses were already rolling by the time Colbert came on at 10:30, so the story had to be largely written by then." [...] Asked why television news favored Bush's performance over Colbert's, Elizabeth Fishman, an assistant dean at the Columbia School of Journalism and a former 60 Minutes producer, told MTV that the [...] "quick hit" [...] for television news shows would have been to use footage of Bush standing beside his impersonator. [...] "It's an easier set up for visual effect", she noted. Steve Scully, president of the White House Correspondents' Association (which hosted the dinner) and political editor of C-SPAN (which broadcast the dinner), scoffed at the whole idea of the press intentionally ignoring Colbert: [...] "Bush hit such a home run with Steve Bridges that he got all of the coverage. I think that exceeded expectations. There was no right-wing conspiracy or left-wing conspiracy." [...] Time columnist Ana Marie Cox dismissed allegations of a deliberate media blackout, because Colbert's performance received coverage in The New York Times, The Washington Post, and the major wire services. Fellow commentator Kurtz concurred, noting that the video was carried on C-SPAN and was freely available online; he also played two clips on his own show. [...] "Apparently I didn't get the memo," [...] he said.|$|E

Kurtz {{has been named}} to three committees of the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws by organization president <b>Howard</b> J. Swibel. <b>Kurtz</b> has worked with NCCUSL, a non-profit group whose 300 members review state laws and determine which areas of law should be standardized, since 2001, when Gov. Roy E. Barnes selected {{him to be a}} commissioner representing the state of Georgia. Kurtz will serve on several of NCCUSL’s key committees, the most prestigious being the Joint Editorial Board on Uniform Family Law. The board monitors developments and proposes changes regarding family law-related uniform and model acts generated by the conference. Several of these acts have been extremely influential in the field of family law, including the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act and the Uniform Parentage Act. He will also serve on the Drafting Committee for the Uniform Guardianship Interstate Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act as well as a committee designated to draft a uniform act concerning children who have been relocated due to divorce. Furthermore, he will maintain his position on the Drafting Committee for the Uniform Representation of Children in Abuse and Neglect and Custody Proceedings Act. In addition to working with NCCUSL, Kurtz will continue his work on the executive committee of the Georgia Public Defender Standards Council. Composed of a delegate from each of the state’s 10 judicial districts and one public defender, the council is responsible for creating statewide standards for indigent defense programs and public defenders as well as operating circuit defender offices throughout Georgia. An expert in criminal, family and constitutional law, Kurtz {{has been a member of}} Georgia Law’s faculty since 1975. He has served as the law school’s associate dean for academic and student affairs since 1991 and, in 1994, was named a J. Alton Hosch Professor of Law.
