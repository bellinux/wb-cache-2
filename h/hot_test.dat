50|$|This {{engine was}} {{initially}} slated for completion and testing by 2015. ISRO crossed a major milestone {{in the development}} of CE-20 engine with the successful 640 secs <b>hot</b> <b>test</b> at ISRO Propulsion Complex, Mahendragiri on 19 February 2017. The test demonstrated the repeatability of the engine performance with all its sub systems like thrust chamber, gas generator, turbo pumps and control components for the full duration.

50|$|ISRO {{formally}} {{started the}} Cryogenic Upper Stage Project in 1994. The engine successfully completed the Flight Acceptance <b>Hot</b> <b>Test</b> in 2008, and was integrated with propellant tanks, third-stage structures and associated feed lines {{for the first}} launch. The first flight attempt took place in April 2010 during the GSLV Mk.II D3/GSAT-3 mission. The engine ignited, but the ignition did not sustain as the Fuel Booster Turbo Pump (FBTP) shut down after reaching a speed of about 34,500 rpm 480 milliseconds after ignition, due to the FBTP being starved of Liquid Hydrogen (LH2). On 27th March 2013 the engine was successfully tested under vacuum conditions. The engine performed as expected and was qualified to power the third stage of the GSLV Mk-2 rocket. On 5 January 2014 the cryogenic engine performed successfully and launched the GSAT-14 satellite in the GSLV-D5/GSAT-14 mission.|$|E

40|$|<b>Hot</b> {{structures}} <b>testing</b> {{have been}} going on since the early 1960 's beginning with the Mach 6, X- 15 airplane. Early <b>hot</b> structures <b>test</b> programs at NASA-Ames-Dryden focused on operational testing required to support the X- 15 flight test program, and early hot structures research projects focused on developing lab test techniques to simulate flight thermal profiles. More recent efforts involved numerous large and small <b>hot</b> structures <b>test</b> programs that served to develop test methods and measurement techniques to provide data that promoted the correlation of test data with results from analytical codes. In Nov. 1988 a workshop was sponsored that focused on the correlation of <b>hot</b> structures <b>test</b> data with analysis. Limited material is drawn from the workshop and a more formal documentation is provided of topics that focus on <b>hot</b> structures <b>test</b> techniques used at NASA-Ames-Dryden.

5000|$|The CE-20 is {{the first}} Indian {{cryogenic}} engine to feature a gas-generator cycle. The engine produces a nominal thrust of 200 kN, but has an operating thrust range between 180 kN to 220 kN and can be set to any fixed values between them. The combustion chamber burns liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen at 6 MPa with 5.05 engine mixture ratio. The engine has a thrust-to-weight ratio of 34.7 and a specific impulse of [...] in vacuum. ISRO tested the CE-20 on April 28, 2015 at Mahendragiri test facility and achieved a successful long duration <b>hot</b> <b>test</b> (635 seconds).

The project team for this demonstration included MSE Technology Applications, Inc., Geosafe Corporation, and LANL. The technology demonstration involved {{the performance of}} two large-scale test melts. The first, {{referred to as the}} ''cold'' test, was performed on a simulated absorption bed that contained surrogate contaminants. The cold test was conducted in April 1999. The second demonstration, referred to as the ''hot'' test, took place at LANL's Material Disposal Area (MDA) V in April 2000.

40|$|The {{design of}} an {{efficient}} process flow-sheet requires accurate extraction data for experimental set-up used. Often this data is provided as equilibrium data. Due {{to the small}} hold-up volume compared to the flow rate in centrifugal contactors the time for extraction is often too short to reach equilibrium D-ratios. In this work single stage kinetics experiments {{have been carried out}} to investigate the D-ratio dependence of the flow rate and to compare this with equilibrium batch experiments for a SANEX system based on CyMe 4 -BTBP. The first centrifuge experiment was run with spiked solutions while in the second a genuine actinide/lanthanide fraction from a TODGA process was used. Three different flow rates were tested with each set-up. the results show that even with low flow rates, only around 9 % of the equilibrium D-ratio (Am) was reached for the extraction in the spiked test and around 16 % in the <b>hot</b> <b>test</b> (the difference is due {{to the size of the}} centrifuges).

The seed lots of C. capsularis were differed significantly in pot culture, speed of germination, cold and germination after 48 hours tests. In C. olitorius seed lots differed significantly in laboratory standard germination, pot-culture, hot and cold tests (p = 0. 01). The highest germination of 92 % in C. capsularis and 96 % in C. olitorius were found in laboratory standard germination and the lowest of 11 and 16 % in C. capsularis and C. olitorius respectively for cold test.

40|$|In 1984, the Vacuum Plasma Spray Lab {{was built}} at NASA/Marshall Space Flight Center for {{applying}} durable, protective coatings to turbine blades {{for the space}} shuttle main engine (SSME) high pressure fuel turbopump. Existing turbine blades were cracking and breaking off after five <b>hot</b> fire <b>tests</b> while VPS coated turbine blades showed no wear or cracking after 40 <b>hot</b> fire <b>tests.</b> Following that, a major manufacturing problem of copper coatings peeling off the SSME Titanium Main Fuel Valve Housing was corrected with a tenacious VPS copper coating. A patented VPS process utilizing Functional Gradient Material (FGM) application was developed to build ceramic lined metallic cartridges for space furnace experiments, safely containing gallium arsenide at 1260 degrees centigrade. The VPS/FGM process was then translated to build robust, long life, liquid rocket combustion chambers for the space shuttle main engine. A 5 K (5, 000 Lb. thrust) thruster with the VPS/FGM protective coating experienced 220 <b>hot</b> firing <b>tests</b> in pristine condition with no wear compared to the SSME which showed blanching (surface pulverization) and cooling channel cracks in less than 30 of the same <b>hot</b> firing <b>tests.</b> After 35 of the <b>hot</b> firing <b>tests,</b> the injector face plates disintegrated. The VPS/FGM process was then applied to spraying protective thermal barrier coatings on the face plates which showed 50 % cooler operating temperature, with no wear after 50 <b>hot</b> fire <b>tests.</b> Cooling channels were closed out in two weeks, compared to one year for the SSME. Working up the TRL (Technology Readiness Level) to establish the VPS/FGM process as viable technology, a 40 K thruster was built and is currently being tested.
