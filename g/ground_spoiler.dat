5000|$|During the takeoff roll, the copilot {{tampered}} with the <b>ground</b> <b>spoiler</b> lever, while saying [...] "This is not fitting in smoothly", then forgot to reset {{it to the}} correct position. So, even though the <b>ground</b> <b>spoiler</b> is for use immediately after landing only, the plane had to take off with it extended, generating excessive drags leading to insufficient acceleration and abnormal vibration.|$|E
50|$|On DC-8s, {{spoilers}} {{are used}} after landing only (i.e. <b>ground</b> <b>spoiler).</b> Few methods {{can be used}} to reduce speed in flight (e.g. before landing), such as deploying the thrust reverser of inner engines on both port and starboard side. Other accidents attributed to accidental deployment of <b>ground</b> <b>spoiler</b> in flight have also occurred. As a result, modifications were done to make ground spoilers unable to deploy in flight altogether.|$|E
50|$|There was {{a largely}} {{believed}} {{theory that the}} copilot mistook the <b>ground</b> <b>spoiler</b> lever as the landing gear lever. Not impossible as in our days still happens that flaps retraction is done instead of gear retraction. It may happen with spoilers, too.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} allow the Dash 7 to achieve its {{excellent}} STOL characteristics the aircraft employs many aerodynamic devices. The wing flaps are double slotted and span approximately 75% of {{the trailing edge of}} the wing. In a typical STOL landing flaps will be set to 45° before landing which allows for a slower approach speed (typically 70-85 knots) and steeper descent. Upon touchdown the flaps immediately return to the 25° position which decreases the lift created by the wing thereby increasing braking effectiveness. The aircraft also employs two <b>ground</b> <b>spoilers</b> per wing, and two roll spoilers per wing. The roll spoilers' primary job is to augment the ailerons however upon touchdown all four roll spoilers activate along with all four <b>ground</b> <b>spoilers</b> to spoil much of the lift generated by the wing.|$|R
50|$|Further {{additional}} causes {{were certain}} design {{features of the}} aircraft. Computer logic prevented the activation of both <b>ground</b> <b>spoilers</b> and thrust reversers until a minimum compression load of at least 6.3 tons was sensed on each main landing gear strut, thus preventing the crew from achieving any braking action by the two systems before this condition was met.|$|R
50|$|Only {{when the}} left landing gear touched the runway did the {{automatic}} aircraft systems allow the <b>ground</b> <b>spoilers</b> and engine thrust reversers to operate. Due to the braking distances {{in the heavy}} rain the aircraft could not stop {{before the end of}} the runway. The computer did not actually know the aircraft had landed until it was already 125 meters beyond the halfway point of runway 11.|$|R
50|$|American Airlines Flight 1420 {{took place}} on June 1, 1999. The pilot was Captain Richard Buschmann, {{considered}} an expert pilot with over ten thousand hours of flight time. The First Officer was Michael Origel with under five thousand hours of flight time. The flight was set to land {{at the airport in}} Arkansas but a major thunderstorm was occurring in the area and Captain Buschmann decided to change runways due to the high crosswind and rapid change wind direction. The pilots were overcome with tasks and the stress of the difficult landing, forgetting to arm the automatic <b>ground</b> <b>spoiler</b> and ground braking systems. It was too difficult to recover the aircraft and it slid off the runway and collided with a large steel walkway, resulting in the death of Captain Bucshmann and 10 passengers, with many suffering from severe injuries.|$|E
5000|$|On 4 August 2009, a SATA Internacional Airbus A320-200 {{operating}} flight S4-129 from Lisbon to Ponta Delgada {{bounced off the}} runway then subsequently experienced a severe hard landing of 4.86G, causing damage to the landing gear. Nothing {{was written in the}} aircraft's technical maintenance log, both flight crew and maintenance staff were unable to interpret the hard landing report and despite the damage, the aircraft was not removed from service and flew back to Lisbon in customer service as well as flying an additional 6 sectors. SATA said in a statement [...] that the hard landing/load reports are not a mandatory requirement for the aircraft type and drew attention to the amount of time Airbus took to confirm to them the interpretation of the load report. Both landing gear legs subsequently had to be replaced. In their final report the Portuguese accident investigation authority the Aviation Accidents Prevention and Investigation Department determined that the primary cause of the incident was the ground spoilers deploying in flight after the aircraft had bounced 12 ft off the runway. Contributing factors were the failure of the pilot to go-around after the bounce, the failure of the pilot to release the thrust levers before the first touchdown (which inhibited the ground spoilers deploying) and the pilot providing insufficient flare input. Airbus subsequently introduced a new software standard for the A320 in July 2010 to modify the <b>ground</b> <b>spoiler</b> deployment logic.|$|E
25|$|Captain Peter Hamilton and First Officer Donald Rowland {{had flown}} on various flights {{together}} before, {{and had an}} ongoing discussion on when to arm the <b>ground</b> <b>spoilers.</b> They both agreed they did not like arming them {{at the beginning of}} the final approach, as specified in the checklist, fearing it could lead to an inadvertent spoiler deployment. The captain preferred arming them on the ground, while the copilot preferred arming them during the landing flare.|$|R
50|$|Flight 865 {{was cleared}} for takeoff from Runway 16. Suddenly, {{the crew of the}} McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 {{attempted}} to abort take-off after the failure of the number 3 (right) engine. The abort occurred at speeds nearing V2, and after rotation of the nose. Following the abort, attempts were made to stop the aircraft on the runway by use of brakes, <b>ground</b> <b>spoilers</b> and thrust reversers, but the crew was unable to stop the aircraft within the boundaries of the runway, which exited the airport property. The captain stated that he feared that the aircraft might hit buildings or objects if he did not abort the takeoff.|$|R
50|$|On March 11, 2005, a CRJ-200 {{operating}} as flight 2823 from LaGuardia Airport in New York to Milwaukee, Wisconsin ran off the runway on landing. One of the aircraft's hydraulic systems lost pressure in flight, {{resulting in the}} aircraft's <b>ground</b> <b>spoilers</b> not deploying on landing. Contributing to the incident was a crosswind approaching company and aircraft limits and reduced braking ability on the runway, which was covered with snow at the time. The aircraft suffered substantial damage from colliding with signage and lighting, and was further damaged by the crew's attempt to taxi to the gate. None of the 12 aboard were injured, and the aircraft was repaired.|$|R
5000|$|As {{a result}} of this {{accident}} the Japan Transport Safety Board published its final report on April 26, 2013 in which it made a number of new safety recommendations including that [...] "in order to reduce the occurrence of MD-11 series airplanes‘ severe hard landing and bounce in which an overload is transferred to the MLGs and their supporting structure, the Boeing Company should improve the controllability and maneuver characteristics by improving the LSAS (Longitudinal Stability Augmentation System) functions, reducing the AGS (Auto <b>Ground</b> <b>Spoilers)</b> deployment delay time and other possible means. Possible improvement on LSAS functions may include: a function to limit large nose-down elevator input during touchdown phase, which is a common phenomenon in severe hard landing cases accompanied by structural destruction for MD-11; and a function to assist bounce recovery and go-around in case of bounce. In order to help pilots to conduct recovery operation from large bounces and judge the necessity of go-around, studies should be made to install a visual display and an aural warning system which show gear touchdown status on MD-11 series airplanes." ...|$|R
5000|$|On 20 May 2007, an Air Canada Jazz Bombardier CRJ-100 which {{originated}} in Moncton, New Brunswick, was substantially damaged when its landing gear collapsed after landing at Toronto-Pearson International Airport, ON (YYZ). There were no injuries to any crew or passengers. Flight AC8911 departed Moncton (YQM) on a domestic flight to Toronto. The aircraft landed on runway 6 right with a 90 degree crosswind from the left, gusting from 13 to 23 knots. The aircraft first contacted the runway in a left-wing-down sideslip. The left {{main landing gear}} struck the runway first and the aircraft sustained a sharp lateral side load before bouncing. Once airborne again, the flight and <b>ground</b> <b>spoilers</b> deployed and the aircraft landed hard. Both main landing gear trunnion fittings failed and the landing gear collapsed. The aircraft remained upright, supported by the landing gear struts and wheels. The aircraft slid down the runway and exited via the Delta 3 taxiway, where the passengers deplaned. There was no fire. There were no injuries to the crew; some passengers reported minor injuries {{as a result of}} the hard landing.|$|R
50|$|Lufthansa Flight 2904 {{was cleared}} to land at Okęcie International Airport Runway 11 and was {{informed}} {{of the existence of}} wind shear on the approach.http://www.rvs.uni-bielefeld.de/publications/Incidents/DOCS/ComAndRep/Warsaw/warsaw-report.html To compensate for the crosswind, the pilots attempted to touch down with the aircraft banked slightly to the right. Additionally they landed with a speed about 20 kn faster than usual. According to the manual, this was the correct procedure for the reported weather conditions, but the weather report was not up-to-date. At the moment of touchdown, the assumed crosswind {{turned out to be a}} tailwind. Due to the tailwind of approximately 20 kn and the increased speed, the airplane hit the ground at approximately 170 kn and far beyond the normal touch down point. The aircraft's right gear touched down 770 m from the runway 11 threshold. The left gear touched down 9 seconds later, 1525 m from the threshold. Only when the left gear touched the runway did the <b>ground</b> <b>spoilers</b> and engine thrust reversers start to deploy, these systems depending on oleo strut (shock absorber) compression. The wheel brakes, triggered by wheel rotation being equal to or greater than 72 kn, began to operate about 4 seconds later.|$|R

40|$|A steep {{approach}} {{landing procedure}} utilizes a steeper glide slope, {{greater than the}} conventional 3 -deg glide angle, in order to alleviate noise on the <b>ground.</b> <b>Spoilers</b> are deployed {{to slow down the}} aircraft near to the airport perimeter. Steep approach procedure reduces the noise on the ground by allowing aircraft to fly higher and descend with lower engine ratings than conventional landing approach. In this paper {{for the first time a}} computational aeroacoustic investigation is carried out on a two-dimensional high lift system in a steep approach landing configuration in order to identify the noise impact of a deployed spoiler. The high lift model is at an angle of attack of 5 -deg with the slat and the ap deployed at 30 -deg and 38 -deg respectively. The spoiler is deployed at an angle of 20 -deg. The freestream Mach number is M 1 = 0 : 235, corresponding to a Reynolds number Re = 5 : 47 106. Hybrid methodology involving Computational Fluid Dynamics and Ffowcs-Williams and Hawking integral method is used to predict far field noise. The results so far show that a deployed spoiler drastically changes the flow field around the high lift devices. The slat cove vortex grows in size and the flow separates early from the ap surface forming a much wider wake. Contours of fluctuating pressure show noise radiation from the slat cove region and the spoiler trailing edge...|$|R
5000|$|Out of the Blue - Blue Bird Café fire - On 1 September 1972, {{patrons of}} Montreal’s Blue Bird Café and the Wagon Wheel, {{the country and}} western bar above the café, were celebrating the end of another summer. In the main {{entrance}} to the Wagon Wheel, however, 3 young men, drunk and upset over being refused entry to the bar began a fire on the staircase. With one exit now blocked by fire, victims sought out other means of escape. However, conflicting city regulations had left the Wagon Wheel with too few fire exits. This left only two escape routes, through the kitchen onto a foldaway fire escape, and through {{the window in the}} ladies washroom onto a car parked below. Due to these errors in judgement, 37 people were unable to escape the fire and smoke that night. Fire escape regulations have since been standardised to prevent another disaster of this magnitude. // Air Canada Flight 621 on 5 July 1970 from Montreal to Los Angeles, called the [...] "Champagne Flight" [...] due to its typical fun-loving, holiday crowd, was set to make a scheduled stop in Toronto when disaster struck. A minor misunderstanding in the cockpit over landing procedures caused the first officer to deploy the <b>ground</b> <b>spoilers</b> manually while in the air. The plane nosed downwards and struck the runway briefly before lifting off again. The captain managed to pull the damaged plane around for another attempt at landing, but as he did so the plane began to disintegrate in the air while an explosion blew off the right wing, killing all 100 passengers and 6 crewmembers on board.|$|R

5000|$|The Twin Otter {{incorporated}} [...] "flaperons" [...] that drooped the ailerons {{as part of}} the flaps, {{but these}} {{were not included in the}} Dash 7 due to weight and complexity. Instead, the ailerons were reduced in size to allow more flap area, and were augmented with two sets of roll spoilers, or [...] "spoilerons". The inboard roll spoilers operate at all speeds. while the outboard roll spoilers only operate at speeds less than 130 KIAS to allow for more roll control at slower speeds. Upon touchdown, both the inboard and outboard roll spoilers extend in unison to aid in destroying lift created by the wing. Each wing also includes two <b>ground</b> <b>spoilers</b> which only extend on touchdown. Most of the trailing edge is spanned by a complex, double Fowler flap arrangement for high lift at low speed. During a typical STOL landing, flaps are selected to the 45° position, generating more lift and drag, thus allowing for steeper descents and slower approach speeds. Depending on weight, the VREF speed with flaps at 45° is between 70 and 85 knots. On touchdown, through [...] "squat switches" [...] in the main gear, the flaps automatically retract to the 25° position, thus reducing lift once on the runway and producing better braking performance. The flaps also retract to 25° when engine power is increased during a go-around procedure. The four-engine layout aids lift at low speeds due to the wide span of the propellers blowing air over the wing ("propwash"). When reverse thrust is selected on landing, the props reverse pitch, push air forward, and slow the aircraft very effectively along with the antiskid wheel brakes. More importantly, if an engine fails, the asymmetric thrust is much less than on a twin-engine layout, thereby increasing safety and allowing for a lower minimum control speed with an engine inoperative [...]|$|R
