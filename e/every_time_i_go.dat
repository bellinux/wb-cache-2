500|$|An {{earlier version}} of [...] "Full on Idle", Title TKs eighth track, was {{released}} on the Amps' Pacer in 1995. In a 1997 interview, Deal {{expressed an interest in}} redoing multiple Amps songs, partially because she did not feel Pacer was well recorded. Bryant opined that both versions of [...] "Full on Idle" [...] sound almost the same, but The Village Voices Jessica Grose wrote that the Breeders' rendition is noticeably slower. In Cibula's view, this version contains elements of country music, cumbia, and ska. The Guardians Betty Clarke cited the line [...] "Obey your colorist, bleach it all away" [...] as an example of Title TKs amusing, off-center lyrics. On [...] "Sinister Foxx", Deal repeatedly sings [...] "Has anyone seen the iguana?" [...] She has explained this as being a reference to buying marijuana: [...] "Have you ever bought a bag of weed? You walk in, and the pot dealer's got an empty terrarium ... <b>Every</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> to a pot dealer's house, there's no iguana." [...] Another line, [...] "I'm in beer class every Thursday night", refers to the alcohol awareness classes that Richard Presley attended after being caught driving while drunk. Phares described the song as having a [...] "sexy menace", and Berger compared the drum part to gunshots and door-knocking.|$|E

The {{violence}} we've seen, the looting we've seen, the thuggery we've seen – this is sheer criminality, and let's make no bones about it." [...] Paul Hobbs, London correspondent for One News said that looters are not politically motivated and called the riots [...] "recreational violence". A Manchester rioter said to a BBC correspondent: [...] "Every time I go into town I just think how the shops got smashed up in 2011 by all of us, I just laugh about it <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> back in now." ...|$|E

2500|$|In an October 2007 {{preliminary}} hearing {{for the case}} of Dr. Maurice Wolin, Dr. Wolin's attorney Blair Berk argued that Perverted Justice's founder has a financial incentive to badger suspects. Von Erck testified in the hearing that he is paid an annual salary of $120,000 stemming from Perverted Justice's deal with NBC. Said Berk, [...] "Xavier Von Erck had a problem. He had a television show to get on and a fancy cancer doctor to ensnare in his web, and he wouldn't let it go." [...] The prosecutor in the case, Brian Staebell, stated, [...] "The whole business of this {{preliminary hearing}} has been {{an attack on the}} Petaluma Police Department and Perverted Justice. But <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> back to the chats and I look at how he was grooming this 13-year-old girl." [...] After the hearing, Judge Raima Ballinger held Wolin over for trial, ruling that there was sufficient cause to believe Wolin committed the crime.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout his {{childhood}} in Barcelona, Carreras's father, Josep Carreras i Soler, worked as a traffic policeman. He had originally been a French teacher. However, he had fought on the Republican side during the Spanish Civil War, and when the Franco government came into power in 1939, {{he was no longer}} allowed to teach. His mother, Antonia Coll i Saigi, ran a small hair-dressing salon, where, as a child, Carreras often sang to the customers in return for pocket money. He was very close to his mother, who was convinced that he would one day be a great singer, and her death from cancer when he was 18 affected him greatly. In José Carreras: A Life Story, he said that [...] "even now, <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> on stage, I always, always, have a quick thought for her." [...] In 1971 Carreras married Mercedes Pérez. They had two children: a son, Albert (born in 1972), and a daughter, Julia (born in 1978). The marriage ended in divorce in 1992. In 2006, Carreras married Jutta Jäger, but separated from her in 2011. Carreras's nephew, David Giménez Carreras, is a conductor and Director of the Orquestra Simfònica del Vallès. He has conducted [...] many of Carreras's concerts since the late 1990s as well as his opera performances in Sly at the Gran Teatre del Liceu in June 2000.|$|E

As for my garden, it hurts me <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> into it. I suppose I shouldn't complain about a garden when the farmers' crops are suffering so.

5000|$|Steve Lopez {{arrived in}} Philadelphia in the mid-1980s. Lopez {{said that he}} began {{considering}} writing a novel because [...] "what I saw in the neighborhood that I found so shocking and so unlike what I had seen in my years of reporting in other cities. There were just so many compelling images that I would walk away with <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> into the neighborhood." [...] Lopez said that the novel was, as paraphrased by Douglas J. Keating of the Philadelphia Inquirer, [...] "essentially {{the story of a}} parent in search of a child in danger." [...] Lopez said that his book mainly focused on [...] "adult relationships".|$|R

So I'm thinking, 'OK, it's pretty obvious to me that I've got this that wants to come out before that.'" ...|$|R
40|$|Let’s {{set some}} common ground. College {{students}} are poor. Everyone knows that.

After moving into my first apartment and fighting with my checkbook <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> to the grocery store, I started to dread buying food. I would drag myself into Hy-Vee and the $ 3. 99 per pound strawberries would stare and laugh at me.

6000|$|His {{daughters were}} the {{inevitable}} {{children of his}} life. Queer girls they were! Curiously [...] "spirited" [...] as people phrase it, and curiously limited.

50|$|The {{art studio}} where Tom Hill (my father), Jack Elrod and Barbara Chen worked {{was on the}} second floor, where they had a great view of the Forest. There was also a homesteader, groundskeeper Hubert Hamrick and his family, who lived at Lost Forest and {{maintained}} the ranch and animals. Besides native wildlife which abounded on the Forest, there was riding stables, guinea fowl, caged pigeons, a 10-acre fishing lake and of course, Andy, the great Saint Bernard who appeared as Mark’s companion in the comic strip. I would visit Andy <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> to visit Ed Dodd or to go fishing at the Lost Forest lake. Andy never had the freedom of his fictional counterpart and was kept in a running pen bounded by chain links. Ed’s other dog, Mose, was usually found at his master’s feet as Ed smoked his afternoon pipe. Famous people would visit Lost Forest, such as Marlin Perkins, sharpshooters, big game hunters and newspaper/magazine journalists. Ed Dodd was a personal friend of Daniel Beard, {{one of the founders}} of the Boy Scouts in 1910 and a fellow naturalist and illustrator. They both attended the Art Students League in New York City.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project {{was to create a}} unit of {{materials}} for Data Analysis and Probability that could be used by a 7 th or 8 th grade teacher to teach the Ohio Academic Content Standards in this area. The materials were created using a hands-on activity approach that incorporated technology when appropriate. Each lesson began by listing the Ohio Academic Content Standard, Benchmarks, and Indicators for both grade levels. Next, a rationale was presented to explain why the concept(s) being taught was important. A list of materials/resources for the lesson followed next. After that came a detailed list of procedures that could easily be followed by even a beginning teacher. Finally, details on assessment were included. A set of student worksheets were also included with each lesson. There were many reasons why I chose to do this particular project. The first reason was because I had been to several professional development classes (e. g., Ohio Mathematics Academy Programs, inclusion seminar, behavior management class, TI- 83 training) and each one had advocated for a more hands-on, student-centered approach to learning. <b>Every</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> to one of these classes, I would leave with materials {{and a great deal of}} enthusiasm.
