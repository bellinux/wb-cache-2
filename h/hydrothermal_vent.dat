5|$|A rare but {{important}} terrain feature {{found in the}} abyssal and hadal zones is the <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>vent.</b> In contrast to the approximately 2°C ambient water temperature at these depths, water emerges from these vents at temperatures ranging from 60°C up to as high as 464°C. Due to the high barometric pressure at these depths, water may exist in either its liquid form or as a supercritical fluid at such temperatures.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} soft sediments tend {{to accumulate}} on seamounts, which are typically populated by polychaetes (annelid marine worms) oligochaetes (microdrile worms), and gastropod mollusks (sea slugs). Xenophyophores {{have also been}} found. They tend to gather small particulates and thus form beds, which alters sediment deposition and creates a habitat for smaller animals. Many seamounts also have <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>vent</b> communities, for example Suiyo and Loihi seamounts. This is helped by geochemical exchange between the seamounts and the ocean water.|$|E
5|$|The {{researchers}} were continually met by clouds of sulfide and sulfate. The sudden collapse of Pele's Vents caused a large discharge of hydrothermal material. The presence of certain indicator minerals in the mixture suggested temperatures exceeded 250°C, {{a record for}} an underwater volcano.

Samples from mounds built by discharges from the hydrothermal plumes resembled white smokers.|$|E
2500|$|The Endeavour Segment, {{an active}} rift {{zone of the}} larger Juan de Fuca Ridge on the British Columbia Coast, {{contains}} a group of active black smokers called the Endeavour <b>Hydrothermal</b> <b>Vents,</b> located [...] southwest of Vancouver Island. This group of <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>vents</b> lies [...] below sea level and consists of five hydrothermal fields, known as Sasquatch, Saily Dawg, High Rise, Mothra, and Main Endeavour. Like typical <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>vents,</b> the Endeavour <b>Hydrothermal</b> <b>Vents</b> form when cold seawater seeps into cracks and crevices in the Endeavour Segment where it becomes heated by magma that lies beneath the seafloor. As the water is heated, it rises and seeks a path {{back out into the}} Pacific Ocean through openings in the Endeavour Segment, forming <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>vents.</b> These <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>vents</b> release fluids with temperatures of over 300°C and have been a focus of research by Canadian and international scientists. The manned United States Navy deep-ocean research submersible DSV Alvin and the remotely operated underwater vehicle Jason have done work at the Endeavour <b>Hydrothermal</b> <b>Vents.</b> Joint Canada-United States studies have made use of the Canadian Remotely Operated Platform for Ocean Sciences.

25|$|Individual lamellibranchid tube worms, {{the longer}} of two taxa found at seeps can reach lengths of 3nbsp&m (10nbsp&ft) and live {{hundreds}} of years (Fisher et al., 1997; Bergquist et al., 2000). Growth rates determined from recovered marked tube worms have been variable, ranging from no growth of 13 individuals measured one year to a maximum growth of 9.6nbsp&cm/yr (3.8 in/yr) in a Lamellibrachia individual (MacDonald, 2002). Average growth rate was 2.19nbsp&cm/yr (0.86 in/yr) for the Escarpia-like species and 2.92nbsp&cm/yr (1.15 in/yr) for lamellibrachids. These are slower growth rates than those of their <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>vent</b> relatives, but Lamellibrachia individuals can reach lengths 2–3 {{times that of the}} largest known <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>vent</b> species. Individuals of Lamellibrachia sp. in excess of 3nbsp&m (10nbsp&ft) have been collected on several occasions, representing probable ages in excess of 400 years (Fisher, 1995). Vestimentiferan tube worm spawning is not seasonal and recruitment is episodic.|$|E

50|$|Bacterial mats {{are found}} at ~100 m water depth next to active <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>vents.</b> Phylogenetic {{analysis}} showed that those bacterial mats consisted of bacteria within the genus Sulfurimonas .

5000|$|Some {{hypothesize that}} <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>vents</b> {{may be a}} {{prominent}} source of reverse weathering. For some time, it was posited that terrestrial fluvial input was {{the only source of}} dissolved salts for the ocean.

[...] At these locations, some dissolved salts react with rock and are removed, thus changing the ion composition of the seawater in comparison to the hydrothermal fluid.Some researchers hypothesize that reverse weathering could play a role in the silica cycle at <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>vents.</b> Low temperature <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>vents</b> release silicic acid (DSi) from the Earth's crust, and before it is able to exit the seabed, it cools and precipitates out as clay, such as a smectite.

2500|$|The {{biosphere}} is postulated to have evolved, {{beginning with}} a process of biopoesis (life created naturally from non-living matter, such as simple organic compounds) or biogenesis (life created from living matter), at least some 3.5 billion years ago.

2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, there are {{suggestions}} that surges of activity {{occurred in the}} later stages of the volcanism and associated continental rifting.

This hypothesis is documented {{by the presence of}} extensive intrusive sill complexes and thousands of kilometer-sized <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>vent</b> complexes in sedimentary basins on the mid-Norwegian margin and west of Shetland. [...] Volcanic eruptions of a large magnitude can impact global climate, reducing the amount of solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface, lowering temperatures in the troposphere, and changing atmospheric circulation patterns. [...] Large-scale volcanic activity may last only a few days, but the massive outpouring of gases and ash can influence climate patterns for years.

Its cofactors reveal dependence upon transition metals, ﬂavins, S-adenosyl methionine, coenzyme A, ferredoxin, molybdopterin, corrins and selenium.
