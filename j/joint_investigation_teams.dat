50|$|France prohibits {{trafficking}} {{for sexual}} exploitation through Article 225 of its penal code, which prescribes penalties that are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with those prescribed for rape. In January 2009, the government amended its anti-trafficking law {{to include a}} specific definition of forced labor. The government reported convicting 19 trafficking offenders under its anti-trafficking statute in 2008, {{the most recent year}} for which data was available, compared with 33 convicted trafficking offenders in 2007. The government did not provide an average sentence for these 19 traffickers, but reported the maximum sentence was up to seven years imprisonment. In addition, the government reported convicting an additional 26 trafficking offenders for the forced prostitution of children, with sentences up to seven years. French officials continued to rely largely on anti-pimping provisions of the country’s penal code to prosecute suspected sex trafficking offenses. The government reported 523 prosecutions under its anti-pimping statute in 2008; approximately 16 percent of the original arrests were for trafficking-specific offenses. The Government of France successfully dismantled 40 trafficking rings in France in 2009 and cooperated to dismantle 14 international networks with bilateral partners through <b>joint</b> <b>investigation</b> <b>teams</b> aimed at investigating and prosecuting cases across borders.|$|E

40|$|<b>Joint</b> <b>Investigation</b> <b>Teams</b> (JITs) {{are a new}} {{instrument}} {{in the fight against}} serious transnational crime. The European legal framework and the national implementation of this instrument give rise to several (legal) questions. An analysis of the (European) legal framework on JITs uncovers the particularities regarding the dual legal basis for establishing a JIT and the consequences of deficient and unclear national implementing laws. The implications of the Pupino case with regard to the Framework Decision on JITs cannot be denied, as was confirmed by the Dutch courts in the first JIT case ever brought before them. However, practice shows that a legal framework is not enough to ensure the successful application of the JIT instrument. Based on two case studies, insight is provided into the obstacles to establishing a JIT and into available remedies...|$|E

For most Member States the legal basis to establish JITs became available in 2004. However, as yet, only around 40 JITs have been established. This chapter investigates the gap between political ambition and police practice as regards to JITs. It explores the origins and practicalities of JITs; it questions their feasibility {{in the context of}} European policing and ex¬amines the perceived added value of JITs over ‘traditional’ methods of police cooperation. It argues that the JIT concept was copied from its original use on a domestic level in one of the Member States with little (if any) consideration of the practicalities of police cooperation on EU level.

It presents a broad analysis of comparable police cooperation strategies in two systems: the EU and Australia. The evolution of regulatory trends and cooperation models is analysed for both systems and possible transferable strategies identified. Drawing on interviews with practitioners in the EU and Australia this book highlights {{a number of areas}} where the EU can be compared to a federal system and addresses {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} being a Union or a federation of states with a view to police cooperation practice. Particular topics addressed are the evolution of legal frameworks regulating police cooperation, informal cooperation strategies, <b>Joint</b> <b>Investigation</b> <b>Teams,</b> Europol and regional cooperation. These instruments foster police cooperation, but could be improved with a view to cooperation practice by learning from regulatory techniques and practitioner experiences of the respective other system.

40|$|Bilateral or {{multilateral}} {{criminal investigations}} {{and the need}} to gather evidence abroad is nowadays more and more frequent. However, it is a complex process because of the diversity of legal instruments in force in Spain. To solve the existing problems, it is crucial to develop legislation establishing common rules to issue and execute letters of requests in pursuing of transborder evidence. This new legislation should clearly specify the role of the different legal operators that participate in criminal investigations, judges, public prosecutors and legal clerks, as well as the role of the Ministry of Justice as Central Authority. The multiple international conventions in force in Spain include provisions to request that any evidence obtained abroad be gathered following Spanish procedural formalities required under the Spanish law and jurisprudence to be admissible as evidence. The new legislation should include as an obligation that any Spanish request to other countries incorporate the description of the requirements for the requested evidence to be admissible in Spain. Likewise, it should specify how the parties in the case can participate in the issuing and in the execution procedures. The new legislation should also address the setting up of <b>Joint</b> <b>Investigation</b> <b>Teams,</b> granting full authority for its constitution to the investigating judge and modifying the current law that requires for its establishment an authorization from the Ministry of Justice. Equally, the role of the Spanish public prosecutors in these <b>joint</b> <b>investigation</b> <b>teams</b> should be similar to the role described to them in the Spanish criminal procedures rules. Recent legislation (Law 16 / 2015), does not describe with sufficient clarity the role of liaison magistrates and of the networks on international cooperation in criminal matters. It is necessary a more detailed regulation to incorporate these legal operators that can efficiently facilitate transborder evidence gathering. Similarly, the new legislation should also describe more clearly the powers granted to the Spanish National Member at Eurojust, specifically those related to criminal investigations initiated by another Member State, to the access to Eurojust of the Spanish investigating judge in national investigations and how information of Eurojust investigations are given to the defense counsel [...] ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} {{we will try to}} {{pinpoint}} the responsibilities of states involved in mutual assistance in criminal matters within the EU framework, with respect to the effective enforcement of the European Convention on Human Rights. What responsibilities do the requested and the requesting state have? What are the risks for effective enforcement under the current system of transnational cooperation (based on mutual trust) and how, if at all, are these risks to be countered without undermining the cooperation itself? This analysis is preceded by a more general introduction into the case law of the ECtHR on transnational cooperation. The focus will be on cooperation within the EU, so as {{to be able to take}} into account the special features of cooperation under the EU Treaty.

40|$|It {{is common}} belief that {{organized}} crime has enormous social cost as it removes and squander financial and human resources, creates distortions {{in the common}} free market, influences the legal economy and action of enterprises, strengthens the corruption and violating human rights. Organized crime acts now on a transnational and cross-border basis, exploits for its benefit globalization, the abolition of border controls within the European Union (EU) and the legislative differences between Member States (MS), in order to accrue more and larger profits. For this reason, should be combated with the same approach by the prosecuting authorities of the MS and on a unified basis. The consequences of this phenomenon, largely affect the obligations of the European Union (EU) versus its citizens {{and that is why}} is necessary one coherent political action of institutions for the fight against organized crime, which will have specific and important effects.

40|$|With the 2001 EU Action Plan and the 2005 EU Counterterrorism Strategy, the European Union has {{unfolded}} a roadmap for counter-terrorism {{measures and}} an itinerary of actions to be {{undertaken by the}} Member States. In some respects, the EU strategies, flanked by the Action Plans in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice, {{as well as more}} concrete forms of cooperation such as the adoption of the EU Arrest Warrant, the Member States have been encouraged to use the same conceptual apparatus, to adopt the precautionary logic (pre-terrorism), and to adopt similar organizational models (multi-disciplinary cooperation) and tools (surveillance, public-private cooperation, etc.). This may have led to a level of convergence between the national counter-terrorism approaches, in line with what the Action Plan on Organized Crime in 1997 sought to achieve by demanding from Member States that they would adapt their national structures. The number of policy-impulses that has emanated from the EU Counterterrorism strategy and ensuing policy documents has been rather numerous. Moreover, this article seeks to take stock of whether all proposals have led to the full adoption and implementation of instruments. The article assesses whether the EU strategies have encouraged 'deep integration' between the Member States in terms of a common threat assessment, pooling resources, sharing intelligence, mutual legal assistance in anti-terrorist investigations, creating <b>joint</b> <b>investigation</b> <b>teams</b> and transferring suspects between Member States.

40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Australia and the European Union (EU) have {{different}} structures of governance, histories, and cultures, both entities face remarkably similar problems in relation to police cooperation across borders. Australia is divided in nine different criminal jurisdictions, each of them policed by its own police force. Problems of border crossing, information exchange and joint investigations therefore arise {{similar to those in}} the EU. These problems have intensified in the 20 th century with globalisation and the increased mobility of offenders. Several strategies, both legal and administrative, have necessarily developed to secure inter-state borders. Many of these strategies, like <b>joint</b> <b>investigation</b> <b>teams,</b> common databases and mutual recognition can be compared to solutions developed in the EU. This article will analyse some of the strategies that have been developed in Australia and in the EU to out-balance the lack of borders within them. It will be discussed what the major common impediments to police cooperation are in both entities. As many problems of cross-border policing result from {{the fact that}} law enforcement strategies are purely regional, it will be explored how more advanced cooperation strategies could be harmonised at the EU and Australian Federal levels. The major inhibiting factor in relation to harmonisation of legal frameworks in both entities will be defined as ‘the fear of insignificance’ or the fear of state actors to lose their individual identities in the process of harmonisation...|$|E
40|$|Since the 1990 s, {{transnational}} {{organised crime}} (TOC) {{has emerged as}} a threat to national and international security. As a result, the United Nations implemented the Convention against Transnational Organised Crime (UNTOC) in 2000, which aims to improve international legislation and facilitate cooperation between state parties. This research aims to identify {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the UNTOC and the European Union’s framework, as well as take advantage of a comparative analysis so as to determine whether the international legal system may benefit from elements employed at EU level. Moreover, key challenges facing implementation and monitoring on an international level are addressed. Finally, traditional as well as non-traditional measures to combat organised crime are proposed which may be used so as to strengthen the international legal framework and to overcome weaknesses of the current framework. The above mentioned aims were achieved by conducting doctrinal (‘black letter law’) research, doctrinal research searching secondary authority, socio-legal research (‘law in practice’) and, finally, comparative cross-jurisdictional research. The research found that the fight against TOC has been characterised by the definitional opaqueness of TOC and the complexity intrinsic to law enforcement and judicial cooperation. Nevertheless, the convention provides a solid basis for mutual legal assistance and law-enforcement cooperation. The UNTOC serves as a framework of international legislation and facilitates cooperation between state parties. It does not constitute an operational treaty, which oversees specific crime-fighting activities. As a whole, state parties remain wary of using the UNTOC as it does not provide a clear, elaborate concept upon which states may rely, legislate and train around. New practices and legal innovations, such as the establishment of <b>joint</b> <b>investigation</b> <b>teams</b> or the integration of other fields of law, need to be considered in order to address all facets of TOC, be it cross-border criminality or economic changes. Consequently, an integrated and comprehensive strategy, which takes into account the fluid, globalised nature of criminal networks, as well as their sophisticated tactics, needs to be developed...|$|E
