5|$|King Henry's Articles, {{signed by}} each king since 1573, {{required}} the king {{to call a}} general sejm (lasting six weeks) every two years, and provisions for an extraordinary sejm (Polish: sejm ekstraordynaryjny, nadzwyczajny) that was to last two weeks were also set down in this act. Extraordinary sejms could be called in times of national emergency, for example a sejm deciding whether to call pospolite ruszenie (a <b>general</b> <b>call</b> to arms) {{in response to an}} invasion. The sejm could be extended if all the deputies agreed. No set time of a year was defined, but customarily sejms were called for a time that would not interfere with the supervision of agriculture, which formed the livelihood of most nobility; thus most sejms took place in late fall or early winter.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} 2 September 1870 that the new lieutenant-governor Adams George Archibald arrived and set about the {{establishment}} of civil government. Without an amnesty, and with the Canadian militia beating and intimidating his sympathisers, Riel fled {{to the safety of}} the St. Joseph's mission across the Canada–US border in the Dakota Territory. However the results of the first provincial election in December 1870 were promising for Riel, as many of his supporters came to power. Nevertheless, stress and financial troubles precipitated a serious illness—perhaps a harbinger of his future mental afflictions—that prevented his return to Manitoba until May 1871. The settlement now faced a possible threat, from cross-border Fenian raids coordinated by his former associate William Bernard O'Donoghue. Archibald proclaimed a <b>general</b> <b>call</b> to arms on 4 October. Companies of armed horsemen were raised, including one led by Riel. When Archibald reviewed the troops in St. Boniface, he made the significant gesture of publicly shaking Riel's hand, signaling that a rapprochement had been affected. This was not to be—when this news reached Ontario, Mair and members of the Canada First movement whipped up anti-Riel (and anti-Archibald) sentiment. With Federal elections coming in 1872, Macdonald could ill afford further rift in Quebec-Ontario relations and so he did not offer an amnesty. Instead he quietly arranged for Taché to offer Riel a bribe of $1,000 to remain in voluntary exile. This was supplemented by an additional £600 from Smith for the care of Riel's family.|$|E
25|$|However, when French troops {{occupied}} the Ruhr a month later, the promised general strike did not occur. The German ADGB opposed initiating a general strike.

In November 1923 he resigned as ITUF general secretary.|$|E

25|$|Early in 1843 a <b>general</b> <b>call</b> {{was issued}} in New York City by Brisbane, Greeley, and others, seeking local {{organizations}} of Fourierist groups. This call inspired the {{formation in the}} summer of 1843 of a group calling itself the Albany Branch of the North American Phalanx. About 20 families participated in the official planning of the group, of which about a dozen families formally subscribed to the draft constitution, on August 12, 1843.|$|E
500|$|Toby Creswell {{argues that}} the [...] "Sex Pistols' agenda was inchoate, to say the least. It was a <b>general</b> <b>call</b> to {{rebellion}} that falls apart at the slightest scrutiny." [...] Critic Ian Birch, writing in 1981, called [...] "stupid" [...] {{the claim that the}} Sex Pistols [...] "had any political significance.... If they did anything, they made a lot of people content with being nothing. They certainly didn't inspire the working classes." [...] While the Conservative triumph in 1979 may be taken as evidence for that position, Julien Temple has noted that the scene inspired by the Sex Pistols [...] "wasn't your kind of two-up, two-down working class normal families, most of it. It was {{over the edge of the}} precipice in social terms. They were actually giving a voice to an area of the working class that was almost beyond the pale." [...] Within a year of [...] "Anarchy in the U.K." [...] that voice was being echoed widely: scores if not hundreds of punk bands had formed across the country—groups composed largely of working-class members or middle-class members who rejected their own class values and pursued solidarity with the working class.|$|E

Full conscription was applied in İstanbul for the first time during World War I, and a lasting phraseology describes the Dardanelles Campaign as Turkey having [...] "buried a university in Çanakkale". Non-Muslim Millets (minorities for some sources) were also issued a <b>general</b> <b>call</b> to serve in the military for the first time during World War I {{in the history of the}} Empire; but they did not participate in action and served behind the lines.

2500|$|As {{the grand}} vizier was away on {{campaign}} with the imperial army, {{command of the}} loyalist forces was assigned to Murtaza Pasha, who {{was at that time}} charged with the defense of the eastern frontier with the Safavids, with whom the Ottomans were at peace. He was ordered to assemble the armies of the eastern governors to defeat Abaza Hasan. Simultaneously, the Şeyhülislâm Bolevi Mustafa Efendi issued a fatwa declaring Abaza Hasan to be saʿī bi-l-fesād, or [...] "a formenter of corruption," [...] thus sanctioning the death penalty for him. The Sultan also issued a <b>general</b> <b>call</b> for the populace to take up arms against the rebels, and Köprülü Mehmed was recalled from Transylvania, where he had successfully conquered the fortress town of Yanova (modern Ineu). Upon his return at the beginning of November, salaries were distributed to the imperial troops. All those who failed to appear had their names erased from the muster rolls, amounting to some 7,000 men, or one third of all imperial cavalrymen. Some of the rebel troops sought at this point to rejoin the loyalist side and claim their salaries, causing instability in the rebel ranks. As it were, the formerly rebellious cavalrymen who arrived in Istanbul found only executioners waiting for them.|$|E

2500|$|Carl Wilhelm Christian Hahn {{was born}} in Weingartsgreuth, Upper Franconia as the first son of Johann Michael Hahn (1734–1824), who was court and palace {{gardener}} on the estate of Baron von Seckendorff, later palace gardener for Count Friedrich von Pückler. C. W. Hahn obeyed the <b>general</b> <b>call</b> to arms as early as 1813. He served as a quarter master and in 1816 received his honourable discharge. Afterwards {{he lived with his}} parents in Fürth and, according to Hahn, made up his mind to devote his life to his predilection for natural history, an interest he had had since early childhood and which intensified during his studies in Erlangen. He commenced work on his first ornithological work [...] "Birds from Asia, Africa, America and New Holland". When his [...] "often promised and well earned position" [...] failed to materialize, Hahn undertook what was for that time, in his field, a very unusual step and went freelance. From then on he called himself a natural historian and occasionally also a scholar. On 24 February 1820, having in the meantime qualified as a Dr. Phil. at the University of Erlangen, he married Victoria Francisca Kaltdorff, née Schaefer. His wife, the widow of a doctor of medicine, was about five years older than he, and had three children by her previous marriage. She was at this time without means, but was expecting quite large inheritance from her maternal uncle before long. Their own child Anna Friedericke was born at the end of 1820 or 1821.|$|E
