40|$|An {{environmental}} control system proposed here {{was named the}} decentralized autonomous production management system (DAPMS).

The {{purpose of this study was}} to characterize UV light exposure in nursery and <b>grow</b> <b>rooms</b> in two medical cannabis production facilities using area and personal sampling. Methods: Three different light spectrums were assessed: UV-Broadband (180 to 400 nm), UVA (315 to 400 nm) and blue light (305 to 700 nm). The radiometer hub supported one spectral sensor at a time, therefore the spectrums were assessed consecutively rather than simultaneously. Area surveys were accomplished by consecutively mounting the spectral sensors on a tripod at a fixed height of 1. 6 meters for several minutes per sample. In <b>grow</b> <b>rooms,</b> the tripod was systematically moved to 32 to 37 locations; in nurseries samples were taken from 4 to 6 locations. Personal sampling utilized sensors consecutively mounted on a helmet worn by the worker. In each facility, one worker wore each sensor for 20 minute periods in the <b>grow</b> <b>room.</b> Results: In both area and personal sampling, the ACGIH TLV (American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists, Threshold Limit Value) for UV Broadband exposure was exceeded. For area sampling in <b>grow</b> <b>rooms,</b> 8 of 69 (12 %) samples exceeded the UV Broadband TLV of 0. 003 J/m 2 in under 8 hours, and all (n= 10) area nursery room samples exceeded this TLV. In area <b>grow</b> <b>room</b> and nursery samples, the average number of exposure-minutes resulting in a TLV exceedance was 318 and 61 minutes, respectively. Personal <b>grow</b> <b>room</b> sampling in the UV Broadband spectrum resulted in a mean (SD) effective irradiance of 0. 0001 (3. 807 e- 5) Eff mW/cm 2 over a 20 minute interval. At this mean exposure level, the worker did not exceed the UV Broadband TLV during the 20 minute sample but would be projected to exceed the TLV in 446 minutes (less than 8 hours). No sample from any facility or room type exceeded the ACGIH TLVs for UVA or blue light. Conclusion: While data is limited for the three light spectrums surveyed, the UV Broadband spectrum did have samples that exceeded the ACGIH TLV. Nurseries had more UV Broadband exposure than <b>grow</b> <b>rooms.</b> Additional assessment, particularly personal sampling, is needed to more fully characterize cannabis workers’ exposure to UV light. Further research is needed to establish validated UV light sampling methods, to examine the effectiveness of protective equipment, and to establish employer best practices...|$|R
40|$|White button {{mushrooms}} are fragile and discolor soon after mechanical bruising. This hampers {{the development of}} mechanical harvesting for button mushrooms and causes loss of postharvest quality. The extent of discoloration can be affected by environmental conditions. A factorial design analysis was conducted to screen the effect of factors influencing the bruising sensitivity of button mushrooms, {{and to find out}} a combination of environmental factors generating the largest variation among bruising sensitive and bruising resistant strains. In this way a maximal variation of the trait ‘bruising sensitivity’ can be induced in segregating populations intended to map this trait. Three environmental factors were investigated on four genotypes (strains), i. e., thickness of the casing layer (2. 5 cm and 5 cm), wetness of casing (dry and normal), and relative humidity in the <b>growing</b> <b>room</b> (80 % and 87 %). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that genotype (strain) was a significant factor influencing bruising sensitivity as well as casing thickness. Significant factor interaction effects were observed.

30|$|In {{the present}} study, some {{treatments}} were missed {{due to the}} pollution in substrate such as ink cap growth. Although applying a pasteurization step assumes that the material used was not already heavily contaminated with microorganisms before it was pasteurized, the pasteurization condition can be revised in further studies. Ink cap (Coprinus spp.) fungi appeared on the substrate before mushroom fruiting. Coprinus indicates the presence of free ammonia or conversely a high content of nitrogen in the compost. On the other hand, the appearance of ink cap fungi in the <b>growing</b> <b>room</b> indicates the low quality of substrate due to the disturbance of the fermentation and the substrate’s pasteurization process (Sharma et al. 2007).
