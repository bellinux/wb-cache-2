5|$|The {{details of}} Bede's story, and in {{particular}} of the miraculous nature of Cædmon's poetic inspiration, are not generally accepted by scholars as being entirely accurate, but there seems no good reason to doubt {{the existence of a}} poet named Cædmon. Bede's narrative has to be read {{in the context of the}} Christian belief <b>in</b> <b>miracles,</b> and it shows at the very least that Bede, an educated and intelligent man, believed Cædmon to be an important figure in the history of English intellectual and religious life.|$|E

25|$|I {{think that}} Gould's {{separate}} compartments was a purely political ploy to win middle-of-the-road religious {{people to the}} science camp. But it's a very empty idea.

25|$|Liberal Christians place less {{emphasis}} on miraculous events associated with the life of Jesus than on his teachings. The effort to remove superstitious elements from Christian faith dates to intellectual reformist Christians such as Erasmus and the Deists in the 15th–17th centuries. In the 19th century, self-identified liberal Christians sought to elevate Jesus' humane teachings as a standard for a world civilization freed from cultic traditions and traces of pagan belief in the supernatural. The debate over whether a belief <b>in</b> <b>miracles</b> was mere superstition or essential to accepting the divinity of Christ constituted a crisis within the 19th-century church, for which theological compromises were sought.|$|E

25|$|I find it {{amazing that}} he wrote this in the time period he did. It's very prophetic, {{it seems to be}} in line with a more modern {{understanding}} of Jesus that readers of The Course <b>in</b> <b>Miracles</b> and Marianne Williamson are a large part of vocalizing. But even fundamentalists would enjoy this book… being how it is written from the opinion of 80 different points of view, many of which do proclaim him the Son of God. Ultimately, any view can be thoughtfully stimulating because the people of any opinion have personalities and background given that support why they view Jesus with their perspective. The overall impression I received from this beautiful prose is the beauty and message of Jesus, the devotion, admiration, gratitude and love inspired by him, and the grace which he exuded with confident compassion. And whether he was God, man, a combination of both that we all are potentially, or a combination we can only idolize with an envious self-debasing distorted form of humility, this book shows him to be nothing less than relevant to our comprehension.|$|E
500|$|Fox made no {{promises}} that his efforts {{would lead to}} a cure for cancer, but he closed his letter with the statement: [...] "We need your help. The people in cancer clinics all over the world need people who believe <b>in</b> <b>miracles.</b> I am not a dreamer, and I am not saying that this will initiate any kind of definitive answer or cure to cancer. I believe <b>in</b> <b>miracles.</b> I have to." [...] The Cancer Society was skeptical of his dedication, but agreed to support Fox once he had acquired sponsors and requested he get a medical certificate from a heart specialist stating that he was fit to attempt the run. Fox was diagnosed with left ventricular hypertrophy– an enlarged heart– a condition commonly associated with athletes. Doctors warned Fox of the potential risks he faced, though they did not consider his condition a significant concern. They endorsed his participation when he promised that he would stop immediately if he began to experience any heart problems.|$|E

The first significant exponent of the New Age movement in the U.S. has been cited as Ram Dass. Core works in the propagating New Age ideas included Jane Roberts's Seth series, published from 1972 onward, Helen Schucman's 1975 publication A Course <b>in</b> <b>Miracles,</b> and James Redfield's 1993 work The Celestine Prophecy. A variety of these books were best sellers, with the Seth book series for instance selling over a million copies. Supplementing these books were videos, audiotapes, compact discs and websites. The development of the internet in particular further popularized New Age ideas and made them more widely accessible.|$|E

500|$|Frazer (2004) {{notes that}} while Adams shared many {{perspectives}} with deists, [...] "Adams clearly {{was not a}} deist. Deism rejected any and all supernatural activity and intervention by God; consequently, deists did not believe <b>in</b> <b>miracles</b> or God's providence....Adams, however, did believe <b>in</b> <b>miracles,</b> providence, and, to a certain extent, the Bible as revelation." [...] Frazer further argues that Adams' [...] "theistic rationalism, {{like that of the}} other Founders, was a sort of middle ground between Protestantism and deism." [...] By contrast, David L. Holmes has argued that Adams, beginning as a Congregationalist, ended his days as a Christian Unitarian, accepting central tenets of the Unitarian creed, but also accepting Jesus as the redeemer of humanity and the biblical account of his miracles as true. Like many of his Protestant contemporaries, Adams criticized the claims to universal authority made by the Catholic Church. In 1796, Adams denounced political opponent Thomas Paine's deistic criticisms of Christianity in The Age of Reason, saying, [...] "The Christian religion is, above all the religions that ever prevailed or existed in ancient or modern times, the religion of wisdom, virtue, equity and humanity, let the Blackguard Paine say what he will." ...|$|E
500|$|Other reviewers {{were more}} cautionary; the New York Times wrote that [...] "the {{aim of the}} filmmaker seems unclear, with Magdalena at first celebrated for her humanness and then exalted for her sudden saintliness" [...] and {{describing}} the story as [...] "wearyingly eventful". The Manila Bulletin noted that while the film is about belief (or lack thereof) <b>in</b> <b>miracles,</b> [...] "the effort to explore this issue is not brought into fulfilling fruition. We keep on hoping something else more significant would happen later in the film to invoke the viewers own feelings about faith and an all-seeing, all-merciful God, but this never comes". Although Rosales and Panganiban were praised for their acting, the reviewer {{felt that there was}} [...] "just no combustible chemistry between the two of them".|$|E

Some figures in the New Thought movement were sceptical, challenging the compatibility of New Age and New Thought perspectives. During these decades, Findhorn had become a site of pilgrimage for many New Agers, and greatly expanded in size as people joined the community, with workshops and conferences being held there that brought together New Age thinkers from across the world.|$|E

500|$|Holby City {{has also}} been accused of medical inaccuracies. The British Medical Association denounced a January 2004 episode of the serial which portrayed organ {{donation}} being carried out despite withdrawal of consent by the patient's relatives. Dr Michael Wilks, chairman of the Medical Ethics Committee stated: [...] "This simply would not happen, but its portrayal, even in a drama, is totally irresponsible and risks causing huge damage to the already struggling transplant programme." [...] The British Medical Association later opined that the show was giving viewers an unrealistic impression of resuscitation by typically presenting only two outcomes, death or total recovery. Andrew Thomson, a Dundee GP, deemed this [...] "a terrible distortion of the truth." [...] In a follow-up story for The Times, Vivienne Parry highlighted {{the fact that in}} reality, less than half of patients who require resuscitation survive the initial catastrophe and only a third of those live to leave hospital. At the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) conference in Bournemouth in April 2010, Holby City was accused of fostering unrealistic expectations of the NHS, encouraging patients to believe <b>in</b> <b>miracles</b> and fuelling compensation culture. Accident and Emergency nurse John Hill stated: [...] "In A it is sometimes a fact that sadly we cannot get people through the trauma they have received. Unfortunately, unlike in Holby City, I am a mere mortal and cannot perform miracles. But many relatives believe because of that, you can. And the injury lawyers assure them that if you don't they will get recompense for it." ...|$|E
500|$|Ripley officially {{became a}} {{minister}} at Boston's Purchase Street Church on November 8, 1826, and became {{influential in the}} developing the Unitarian religion. Thest ten years of his tenure there were quiet and uneventful, until March 1836, when Ripley published a long article titled [...] "Schleiermacher as a Theologian" [...] in the Christian Examiner. In it, Ripley praised Schleiermacher's {{attempt to create a}} [...] "religion of the heart" [...] based on intuition and personal communion with God. Later that year, he published a review of British theologian James Martineau's The Rationale of Religious Enquiry in the same publication. In the review, Ripley charged Unitarian church elders with religious intolerance because they forced the literal acceptance of miracles as a requirement for membership in their church. Andrews Norton, a leading theologian of the day, responded publicly and insisted that disbelief <b>in</b> <b>miracles</b> ultimately denied the truth of Christianity. Norton, formerly Ripley's teacher at the Divinity School, had been labeled by many as the [...] "hard-headed Unitarian Pope", and began his public battle with Ripley in the Boston Daily Advertiser on November 5, 1836, in an open letter charging Ripley with academic and professional incompetence. Ripley contended that to insist upon the reality of miracles was to demand material proof of spiritual matters, and that faith needed no such external confirmation; but Norton and the mainstream of Unitarianism found this tantamount to heresy. [...] This dispute laid the groundwork for the separation of a more extreme Transcendentalism from its liberal Unitarian roots. The debate between Norton and Ripley, which earned allies on both sides, continued until 1840.|$|E
