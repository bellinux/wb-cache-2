25|$|The {{calculus}} for {{peak oil}} has {{changed with the}} introduction of unconventional production methods. In particular, the combination of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing has resulted in a significant increase in production from previously uneconomic plays. Analysts expect that $150 billion will be spent on further developing North American tight oil fields in 2015. The large increase in tight oil production {{is one of the reasons}} behind the price drop in late 2014. Certain rock strata contain hydrocarbons but have low permeability and are not thick from a vertical perspective. Conventional vertical wells would be unable to economically retrieve these hydrocarbons. Horizontal drilling, <b>extending</b> <b>horizontally</b> through the strata, permits the well to access a much greater volume of the strata. Hydraulic fracturing creates greater permeability and increases hydrocarbon flow to the wellbore.|$|E

500|$|The quadrupedal Stegosaurus {{is one of}} {{the most}} easily {{identifiable}} dinosaur genera, due to the distinctive double row of kite-shaped plates rising vertically along the rounded back and the two pairs of long spikes <b>extending</b> <b>horizontally</b> near the end of the tail. Although large individuals could grow up to [...] in length and [...] in weight, the various species of Stegosaurus were dwarfed by contemporaries, the giant sauropods. Some form of armor appears to have been necessary, as Stegosaurus species coexisted with large predatory theropod dinosaurs, such as Allosaurus and Ceratosaurus.|$|E

2500|$|Windows Media Center in Windows Vista, {{available}} in the Home Premium and Ultimate editions, has been upgraded significantly, including a considerable overhaul of the user interface. Each button in the main menu, which contains sections such as [...] "Music", [...] "Videos", and [...] "TV", gets encased in a box when selected, and for each selection, a submenu comes up, <b>extending</b> <b>horizontally.</b> When any of the options is selected, the entries for each are presented in a grid-like structure, with each item being identified by album art, {{if it is a}}n audio file, or a thumbnail image if it is a picture, a video or a TV recording, and other related options, such as different views for the music collection if [...] "Music" [...] is selected, extend horizontally {{along the top of the}} grid. Similarly, other items are identified by suggestive artwork. The grid displaying the items is also extended horizontally, and the selected item is enlarged compared to the rest.|$|E
2500|$|Many of the {{original}} companies raised for the war received hand made flags which were presented to them in elaborate ceremonies in their hometown before marching off to war. In {{the first year of}} the war, many of these homemade banners were [...] "1st National Flag" [...] pattern, meaning that they were patterned after the first national flag authorized for the new Confederate Government. The new Confederate Banner, often referred to as the [...] "Stars and Bars", consisted of [...] "a red field, with a white space <b>extending</b> <b>horizontally</b> through the center, equal in width to one third the width of the flag, and red spaces above and below to the same width as the white, the union blue extending down through the white space and stopping in the lower red space, in the center of the union, a circle of white stars corresponding in number with the States of the Confederacy." [...] The white stripe was a convenient place for the flag makers to embellish the flag with some motto or inscription.|$|E
60|$|To {{return to}} {{the shores of the}} Atlantic: the 840 feet plain, {{at the mouth of the}} Santa Cruz, is seen <b>extending</b> <b>horizontally</b> far to the south; and I am {{informed}} by the Officers of the Survey, that bending round the head of Coy Inlet (sixty-five miles southward), it trends inland. Outliers of apparently the same height are seen forty miles farther south, inland of the river Gallegos; and a plain comes down to Cape Gregory (thirty-five miles southward), in the Strait of Magellan, which was estimated at between eight hundred and one thousand feet in height, and which, rising towards the interior, is capped by the boulder formation. South of the Strait of Magellan, there are large outlying masses of apparently the same great tableland, extending at intervals along the eastern coast of Tierra del Fuego: at two places here, 110 miles a part, this plain was found to be 950 and 970 feet in height.|$|E

6000|$|October 5th.--I {{have been}} {{two or three times}} into the cathedral; [...] . the whole {{interior}} is of marble, in alternate lines of black and white, each layer being about eight inches in width and <b>extending</b> <b>horizontally.</b> It looks very curiously, and might remind the spectator of a stuff with horizontal stripes. Nevertheless, the effect is exceedingly rich, these alternate lines stretching away along the walls and round the clustered pillars, seen aloft, and through the arches; everywhere, this inlay of black and white. Every sort of ornament that could be thought of seems to have been crammed into the cathedral in one place or another: gilding, frescos, pictures; a roof of blue, spangled with golden stars; a magnificent wheel-window of old painted glass over the entrance, and another {{at the opposite end of}} the cathedral; statues, some of marble, others of gilded bronze; pulpits of carved marble; a gilded organ; a cornice of marble busts of the popes, extending round the entire church; a pavement, covered all over with a strange kind of mosaic work in various marbles, wrought into marble pictures of sacred subjects; immense clustered pillars supporting the round arches that divide the nave from the side aisles; a clere-story of windows within pointed arches;--it seemed as if the spectator were reading an antique volume written in black-letter of a small character, but conveying a high and solemn meaning. I can find no way of expressing its effect on me, so quaint and venerable as I feel this cathedral to be in its immensity of striped waistcoat, now dingy with five centuries of wear. I ought not to say anything that might detract from the grandeur and sanctity of the blessed edifice, for these attributes are really uninjured by any of the Gothic oddities which I have hinted at.|$|E

5000|$|With {{stationary}} whips {{mounted on}} structures, an artificial [...] "ground plane" [...] consisting of several rods a quarter-wavelength long <b>extending</b> <b>horizontally</b> {{from the base}} of the whip is often used, which increases the low-angle radiation. This type of antenna is called a ground plane antenna. [...] Often the ground plane rods are sloped downward toward the ground, which improves the radiation pattern and increases the normal 36.8 ohm radiation resistance closer to 50 ohms to provide a better impedance match with standard 50 ohm coaxial cable feedline.|$|E
