2500|$|April – The church {{published}} an extensive interview with Oaks and general authority Lance B. Wickman in April {{to clarify the}} church’s stance on homosexuality. In the interview, Wickman states that the church [...] "doesn't counsel against" [...] conversion therapy and that it [...] "may be appropriate" [...] for an individual to use clinical therapy to seek to diminish or eliminate homosexual feelings. However, Oaks states they [...] "can't endorse" [...] the [...] "aversive therapies" [...] recommended {{in the past to}} fix [...] "this affliction" [...] and they [...] "don’t accept responsibility for those abuses" [...] suffered by individuals who had experienced this now disavowed therapy method. On same-sex civil unions and domestic partnerships, Elder Oaks states that giving these couples the same government rights given to a man and woman marriage is [...] "not right" [...] and [...] "not appropriate". He added that a mixed-orientation marriage would be appropriate for a gay member who could [...] "deal with [...] feelings" [...] and [...] "put them in the background" [...] and felt a [...] "great attraction" [...] to someone of the opposite sex. They compared devout homosexual Mormons to those with physical or mental disabilities who will also not be able to marry, and adds that [...] "same-gender attraction did not exist in the pre-earth life and neither will it exist in the next life." [...] As far as family acceptance and inclusion of homosexual children they gave some example conversation lines like, [...] "don’t expect to stay overnight. Don’t expect to be a lengthy house guest. Don’t expect us to take you out and introduce you to our friends, or to <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> in a public situation that would imply our approval of your 'partnership'." [...] He further stated [...] "the Lord’s way is to love the sinner while condemning the sin".|$|E
