As of 2005, about 60% of residents were college graduates and some 25% had earned advanced degrees, giving Manhattan one of the nation's densest concentrations of highly <b>educated</b> <b>people.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{native of}} Chiprovtsi {{and one of}} Bulgaria's most <b>educated</b> <b>people</b> of the 17th century, Parchevich was among {{the leaders of the}} Bulgarian Roman Catholics. His {{numerous}} diplomatic visits to the royal courts of Europe were mostly in an attempt to garner support for an anti-Ottoman uprising in Bulgaria, which he did not live to witness. Nevertheless, his efforts in defending Christianity earned him a noble title from the Austrian emperors, and he took up several important positions within the Roman Catholic ecclesiastical hierarchy.|$|E

5|$|In England, ain't is {{generally}} considered a non-standard or illiterate usage, as it is used by speakers of a lower socio-economic class, or by <b>educated</b> <b>people</b> in an informal manner. In the nineteenth century, ain't was often used by writers to denote regional dialects such as Cockney English. Ain't is a non-standard feature commonly found in mainstream Australian English, and in New Zealand, ain't is a feature of Maori-influenced English. In American English, usage of ain't corresponds to a middle level of education, although {{it is widely believed}} that its use establishes of lack of education or social standing in the speaker.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, ore output was renewed in the region, briefly revitalizing Chiprovtsi {{through the}} influx of young and highly <b>educated</b> <b>people.</b> On 12 September 1968, Chiprovtsi was officially proclaimed a town by the National Assembly of Bulgaria. In Socialist times, the town had a factory that {{produced}} AK-47 magazines and employed about 400 people. After the democratic changes in 1989, mining was discontinued again {{due to a lack}} of funds, the factory was closed and the carpet industry has been in decline as it had lost its firm foreign markets. As a result, the town and the municipality have been experiencing a demographic crisis.|$|E
5|$|In the 2nd century, {{emperors}} and men {{of status}} are often portrayed wearing the pallium, an originally Greek mantle (himation) folded tightly around the body. Women are also {{portrayed in the}} pallium. Tertullian considered the pallium an appropriate garment both for Christians, {{in contrast to the}} toga, and for <b>educated</b> <b>people,</b> since it was associated with philosophers. By the 4th century, the toga had been more or less replaced by the pallium as a garment that embodied social unity.|$|E

Nevertheless, following the death of Copernicus and before Galileo, heliocentrism was relatively uncontroversial; Copernicus's work was used by Pope Gregory XIII to reform the calendar in 1582.|$|E
5|$|Trilingualism {{was perhaps}} not {{uncommon}} among <b>educated</b> <b>people</b> {{who came from}} regions where a language other than Latin or Greek was spoken. The Latin novelist Apuleius also wrote in Greek, and had learned Punic from his mother. The Babatha Archive is a suggestive example of practical multilingualism. These papyri, named for a Jewish woman {{in the province of}} Arabia and dating from 93 to 132 AD, mostly employ Aramaic, the local language, written in Greek characters with Semitic and Latin influences; a petition to the Roman governor, however, was written in Greek.|$|E
5|$|Periyar {{spent over}} fifty years giving speeches, {{propagating}} the realisation {{that everyone is}} an equal citizen and the differences on basis of caste and creeds were man-made to keep the innocent and ignorant as underdogs in the society. Although Periyar's speeches were targeted towards the illiterate and more mundane mass, scores of <b>educated</b> <b>people</b> were also swayed. Periyar viewed reasoning as a special tool. According to him, all were blessed with this tool, but very few used it. Thus Periyar used reasoning, with respect to subjects of social interest, in his presentations to his audiences. Communal differences in Tamil society were {{considered by many to}} be deep-rooted features until Periyar came to the scene.|$|E

5|$|Historians {{disagree}} about who initiated {{the idea of}} organizing a national assembly. Some credit Jonas Basanavičius, while others argue for Jonas Kriaučiūnas. The organizational activities were largely taken on by the Lithuanian Christian Democrats and by Vilniaus žinios, a moderate newspaper owned by Petras Vileišis. Vilniaus žinios was the first legal Lithuanian-language daily newspaper to appear after the Lithuanian press ban was lifted on May 7, 1904; it was quite popular and its circulation soon reached 6,000 copies. On October 31 (October 18 O.S.), 1905 a fifteen-member organizational committee, chairman Jonas Basanavičius and secretary Jonas Kriaučiūnas, was given the task of convening the assembly. They published an appeal or a manifest to the Lithuanian people on November 11 (October 29 O.S.) in Vilniaus žinios. The appeal, signed by the chairman and the secretary, aroused much interest in the public. Invitations were extended to all persons who would be elected as representatives by their communities at volosts, and to all other <b>educated</b> <b>people</b> interested {{in the future of}} the Lithuanian state. At the end of the appeal there was an eight-point agenda to be discussed at the Seimas. It did not include the question of Lithuanian autonomy.|$|E
5|$|The Khmer Rouge leadership, {{with much}} of its {{political}} and military structures shattered by the Vietnamese invasion, was forced to take refuge in Thailand, where it was warmly welcomed by the Thai Government. Despite the overwhelming economic challenges brought by the Khmer Rouge and the accompanying refugees, the Thai Government sheltered and protected the Khmer Rouge at Khao Larn camp in Trat Province. Meanwhile, in Phnom Penh, the new Kampuchean regime tried to rebuild the country’s economic and social life, which was largely destroyed by decades of political upheavals and constant warfare. However, efforts to rebuild the country were severely hampered {{by the lack of}} educated and qualified personnel, as most <b>educated</b> <b>people</b> had either fled the country or had been murdered by the Khmer Rouge regime during the previous four years. By the end of the year, the new regime’s attempts at nation-building were further challenged by several anti-Vietnamese resistance groups operating along the western regions of the country.|$|E
