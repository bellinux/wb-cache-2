5|$|NY18 {{begins at}} a {{junction}} with NY104 south {{of a complex}} <b>grade-separated</b> <b>interchange</b> that includes NY18F, NY104, and the Niagara Scenic Parkway on {{the eastern edge of}} the village of Lewiston. From NY104 east, a right-turn ramp allows access to Creek Road Extension, the first street that modern-day NY18 occupies. NY104 continues north from the ramp, passing over NY18 westbound (which terminates at the merge ramp with NY104 west) on its way to the village while NY18 proceeds to the northeast on Creek Road Extension, bypassing Lewiston to the southeast. After , the highway curves to the north and meets NY104 at an unconventional <b>grade-separated</b> <b>interchange</b> that has a pair of two-way ramps connecting the two state routes. NY18 continues on, passing under NY104 and paralleling the Robert Moses State Parkway as it proceeds north.|$|E
5|$|During the 1990s, the Department of Transportation {{looked into}} the {{expansion}} of NY347 and NY454. The studies suggested that the state would add one additional traffic lane in each direction, giving most of the highway six lanes with eight travel lanes along the concurrency in Hauppauge. The new lanes would also be capable of holding rapid-commute vehicles for the Long Island Rapid Commute. The interchange where Routes 347 and 454 fork in Hauppague is slated to go from an at-grade fork to a <b>grade-separated</b> <b>interchange.</b> The project, which will cost $359 million (2009 USD) {{was scheduled to be}} completed between 2012 and 2015.|$|E
5|$|New York State Route18 (NY18) is an east–west {{state highway}} in western New York in the United States. It runs {{parallel}} to the south shore of Lake Ontario {{for most of its}} length between Niagara County and Monroe County. NY18, which also passes through Orleans County, acts as a northerly alternate to NY104, another east–west route that parallels NY18 to the south on Ridge Road. The western terminus of NY18 is at a complex <b>grade-separated</b> <b>interchange</b> with NY104 outside the village of Lewiston. Its eastern terminus is at a junction with NY104 in an area of Rochester known as Kodak Park.|$|E

50|$|Ring I has {{at least}} two lanes per {{direction}} for its entire length but a speed limit that never exceeds 80 km/h owing to heavy traffic. With {{the introduction of new}} <b>grade-separated</b> <b>interchanges,</b> provisions have been made to increase the speed limits to 70-80 km/h. Eventually, all of the junctions on Ring I will be upgraded to <b>grade-separated</b> <b>interchanges.</b> However, the road was not originally constructed as a motorway, which limits its capacity..|$|R
5|$|SR104 resumes in Edmonds on Main Street {{and crosses}} a BNSF rail line south of Edmonds Station. The highway turns south at an {{intersection}} with SR524 onto Sunset Avenue towards Woodway. The roadway travels southeast along Edmonds Way towards the SnohomishKing county line, intersecting SR524Spur and 5th Street at a <b>grade-separated</b> <b>interchange.</b> Edmonds Way travels through a partial cloverleaf interchange with SR99 before SR104 intersects its spur route, which travels west towards an at-grade signal with SR99. The highway continues east along Ballinger Way to a partial cloverleaf interchange with I-5 southeast of Lake Ballinger. The highway travels southeast into Lake Forest Park, where SR104 ends at SR522 {{on the north}} shore of Lake Washington.|$|E
5|$|The route heads {{through some}} {{residential}} neighborhoods before entering a commercial area with strip malls and some high-rise buildings where White Flint Mall, {{once one of}} the D.C. metropolitan area's largest shopping malls, was located {{on the east side of}} the road. The road comes to an intersection with Old Georgetown Road as well as a <b>grade-separated</b> <b>interchange</b> at Montrose Parkway. The Metro Red Line draws farther east from MD355 before it crosses into Rockville, the county seat of Montgomery County. In Rockville, the road passes more commercial development with a railroad line paralleling the road a short distance to the east. The route intersects MD 911 (First Street) and the Wootton Parkway. MD355 intersects MD 660 (Dodge Street), which is a short connector to MD 28 (Veirs Mill Road) that the route intersects a short distance later.|$|E
25|$|NJDOT has {{proposed}} a realignment of CR 571 in the Penns Neck neighborhood of West Windsor. The various alternatives would have begun near the northern terminus of Route 64 at a new <b>grade-separated</b> <b>interchange</b> {{to provide access to}} the Princeton Junction Station and the existing Washington Road, run north of Penns Neck through the David Sarnoff Research, cross US 1 at a new <b>grade-separated</b> <b>interchange,</b> and return to the existing alignment south of the Millstone River.|$|E

25|$|Planning {{continued}} {{for the northern}} Dutchess stretch, to be built after the war. With the enforced break in construction, and its new authority over the entire road, the commission began to look at ways to improve what had already been built, {{especially in light of}} the road's growing role as a regional artery. The Hawthorne Circle, where the Taconic, Saw Mill River Parkway and NY100 intersected, was the major problem. It had become a magnet for accidents and congestion. A 1944 study recommended it be replaced with a three-level <b>grade-separated</b> <b>interchange.</b>|$|E
25|$|NY100C {{begins at}} an {{interchange}} with NY9A (Saw Mill River Road) {{in the town}} of Greenburgh. The route heads eastward as Grasslands Road, a continuation of County Route303 (CR303, an unsigned route) which heads towards the hamlet of Eastview. Just east of the interchange, NY100C crosses through a commercial park, entering the town of Mount Pleasant for a short distance before paralleling the Greenburgh town line. Along this line, NY100C enters a <b>grade-separated</b> <b>interchange</b> with the Sprain Brook Parkway. A short distance from the interchange, NY100C intersects with NY100 (Bradhurst Avenue) and NY100A (Knollwood Road). This intersection serves as the eastern terminus of NY100C, as Grasslands Roads continues east as NY100.|$|E
25|$|Entering East Farmingdale, NY110 crosses {{over the}} Central Branch of the Long Island Rail Road and enters a large <b>grade-separated</b> <b>interchange</b> with NY109 (Farmingdale Road) {{just west of}} Republic Airport. NY110 {{continues}} north through Babylon as a six-lane boulevard past the runway of Republic Airport, passing a small campus of Molloy College. Entering Airport Plaza, the route continues north into an intersection with the eastern terminus of the western segment of NY24 (Conklin Street). NY110 continues north along Broad Hollow Road, passing the campus of State University of New York at Farmingdale. Just north of the campus, the route leaves the town of Babylon, crossing into the town of Huntington.|$|E
50|$|The {{highway is}} a four-to-six lane controlled-access, tolled {{motorway}} with <b>grade-separated</b> <b>interchanges</b> and intersections built according to modern international standards. Tolling {{of the highway}} is governed by a Tolling Policy.|$|R
5|$|This {{section of}} the route was {{constructed}} through {{a process known as}} twinning in which a second carriageway is built parallel to an existing road. In addition, existing intersections were rebuilt as <b>grade-separated</b> <b>interchanges.</b>|$|R
50|$|VicRoads is {{currently}} planning an upgrade to freeway standard between South Gippsland Freeway and about 1.2 km south of Cranbourne-Frankston Road with full <b>grade-separated</b> <b>interchanges</b> at Glasscocks Road, Thompson Rd, Hall Road and Cranbourne-Frankston Road.|$|R
25|$|Here, NY15 takes part in {{its third}} and final {{concurrency}} as NY253 joins NY15 for one mile (1.6km) across the New York State Thruway (I-90) to Lehigh Station Road, which NY253 follows eastward toward Pittsford. NY15, meanwhile, continues on a northeasterly line toward Rochester, passing by the studios of local television stations, WHAM and WUHF, prior to entering a major commercial district surrounding The Marketplace Mall and Jefferson Road (NY252). Within the district, NY15 crosses a spur of the LAL and intersects NY252 at a <b>grade-separated</b> <b>interchange</b> {{just south of the}} Henrietta–Brighton town line. The route exits Henrietta for Brighton, but the commercial surroundings remain until Crittenden Road, a local east–west arterial linking NY15 to both NY15A and the Monroe Community College campus on the latter route.|$|E
25|$|Route 71 {{begins at}} large <b>grade-separated</b> <b>interchange</b> with New Jersey Route 35 in the {{community}} of Brielle, New Jersey. The route heads northward through Brielle as Union Avenue, passing through the commercial district and residential after the intersection with Harvey Avenue. Route71 continues northward through Brielle as a two-lane highway before beginning a parallel with New Jersey Transit's North Jersey Coast Line. After entering the community of Manasquan, the highway enters a large commercial district and crosses over the Stockton Brook before curving onto Seventh Avenue. After the intersection with Monmouth County Route49 (Sea Girt Avenue), Route71 enters the community of Sea Girt. The route continues north through Sea Girt until the intersection with Monmouth County Route20 (Manasquan Turnpike), where it enters a short portion of Wall Township. There, the route crosses over the North Branch of the Wreck Pond and enters Spring Lake Heights. Route 71 quickly passes the Spring Lake Golf Club and the nearby Spring Lake train station before entering the downtown portions of Spring Lake Heights.|$|E
25|$|Route 71 {{originates}} as an {{alignment of}} State Highway Route 4 in the 1920s, which ran from Absecon in Atlantic County northward to Rahway in Union County. Route 4 remained intact through the 1927 state highway renumbering, when Route 4 was realigned onto the current alignment of Route35 {{most of its}} length. The older alignment from Belmar to Eatontown was re-designated as State Highway Route 4-N by the New Jersey State Highway Department. Route 4-N {{was one of four}} routes that used the -N suffix from the original numbering. Route 35 was designated on the southern portion, but this got reversed, allow the designation to be extended to Brielle. The route remained intact for the next 24 years, until the second state highway renumbering in 1953. Route 35 remained on its basic alignment, but State Highway Route 4-N was renumbered to Route 71. Route 71 has remained virtually unchanged since the 1953 renumbering in terms of its alignment from Brielle to Eatontown. During the time of the proposed Route 33 Freeway from Trenton to Neptune, the intersection with Route 33 in Neptune was to upgraded to a <b>grade-separated</b> <b>interchange,</b> but this portion was never built after being canned in 1967.|$|E
50|$|The northernmost several exits along Route 128, past exit 12, are not <b>grade-separated</b> <b>interchanges.</b> Exit 10 {{is signed}} as the signalized {{intersection}} with Route 127, {{and there are}} two rotaries between that and exit 12 (the Crafts Road interchange).|$|R

500|$|Across {{the county}} line, NY370 enters {{the town of}} Lysander and becomes known as West Genesee Road. It runs across another [...] of rolling {{farmland}} before it begins to parallel the Erie Canal, here part of the Seneca River. At this point, the open fields gradually give way to pockets of residential development as the route approaches the village of Baldwinsville. West of the village limits, NY370 connects to NY31 and NY690 at NY690's continuation of Interstate 690's (I-690) northernmost <b>grade-separated</b> <b>interchange.</b> NY31—which overlaps with NY690 south of the junction—leaves the freeway and joins NY370 for a [...] overlap that takes both routes along the north bank of the canal and into the densely populated village. They remain overlapped through Baldwinsville's central business district, where they meet NY48 at Oswego Street.|$|E
500|$|A <b>grade-separated</b> <b>interchange</b> with Great Eastern Highway {{is located}} [...] {{south-east}} of the Redcliffe Bridge. It is a diamond interchange, {{with an additional}} north-eastbound to south-eastbound loop ramp. Additionally, Great Eastern Highway's intersection with the south-eastbound exit ramp also connects to Brearley Avenue, {{one of the main}} access roads to Perth Airport's domestic terminal. Beyond this interchange, Tonkin Highway, now six lanes and freeway standard, is within 's residential areas. A further [...] takes the highway {{to the edge of the}} suburb of , where it becomes the border between Redcliffe to the south-west and Perth Airport to the north-east. [...] later, the highway approaches the interchange with Dunreath Drive. A dogbone interchange, Dunreath Drive replaced the Brearley Avenue entrance as the main access road from Tonkin Highway to Perth Airport's domestic terminal in 2015.|$|E
500|$|The roadway's median, while {{initially}} {{thought to}} be wide enough, was considered too narrow by 1960. The turnpike commission installed median barriers at curves and high-accident areas starting in the 1950s. In 1960, it began to install [...] of median barrier along the turnpike. Work was completed in December 1965 {{at a cost of}} $5 million. In October 1963, work began on replacing the New Stanton interchange, which required left turns across traffic on the ramps and was frequently congested. The new, <b>grade-separated</b> <b>interchange</b> opened on November 12, 1964 and provided access to I-70 at the western end of the turnpike stretch of I-70/I-76. A new interchange serving I-283 and PA 283 opened at Harrisburg East in 1969. Due to the realignment of US 222 to a four-lane freeway, a new Reading interchange was proposed. This was opened on April 10, 1974.|$|E
50|$|US-91 first joined U.S. Route 89 in Springville {{at one of}} {{the oldest}} <b>grade-separated</b> <b>interchanges</b> in Utah (this portion is now State Route 51). From this {{junction}} to Logan the two highways ran mostly concurrent. This portion is mostly intact as US-89.|$|R

500|$|On May11, 1914, {{the state}} of New York awarded a {{contract}} to rebuild Elsmere Avenue to state highway standards. The project cost $18,489 (equivalent to $ in [...] ), and the reconstructed road {{was added to the}} state highway system on October27, 1914, as unsigned State Highway1184. It did not receive a posted designation until the 1930s, when it was designated NY335. At the time, the route connected to NY32 at Feura Bush Road. In 1959, {{the state of}} New York developed plans for the Delmar Bypass, which would intersect NY335 a short distance north of Feura Bush Road. The Bethlehem Central Board of Education had called for a <b>grade-separated</b> <b>interchange</b> between the highway and NY335 {{to ensure the safety of}} school buses on the latter road, a major bus route; however, the junction was ultimately built as an at-grade intersection.|$|E
500|$|The Rhode Island Department of Transportation (RIDOT) {{has laid}} out {{long-term}} plans for improvements to both the southern and northern termini of Route4. During the1980s and 1990s, RIDOT announced plans to eliminate the three traffic lights along {{the southern end of}} the highway. The department planned to replace the existing signalized US1 and Route4 merge, converting it into a <b>grade-separated</b> <b>interchange</b> with an extensive overpass. This would cut-off access to three local roads that intersect US1 near the signal. The plan also included the replacement of the two other signaled intersections at West Allenton Road and Oak Hill Road with overpasses; the overpass for West Allenton Road is planned to be constructed as a new exit4. In the 1990s, the state purchased and demolished several houses in the region to allow for an expanded Route4 right-of-way in the vicinity of West Allenton Road.|$|E
500|$|The fixed link project also {{includes}} [...] of highway. On Stord, E39 received a new two-lane, limited-access road from Meatjørn to the bridge. This included a new grade separated (two-level) interchange {{in the southern}} part of Leirvik and a culvert—the Digernes Tunnel—immediately before the bridge. In Sveio, the link included [...] of new limited-access road from the tunnel to a <b>grade-separated</b> <b>interchange</b> at Dalshovda. In Bømlo, there was a new road built across the islands of Spissøy and Nautøy—including an intersection on Spissøy. It further consisted of a new section of road from the Bømlo side of Spissøy Bridge at Gassasundet to Røyksund, and from Gassasundet to Grøvle, including a new tunnel through Stokkajuvet. A combined pedestrian and bicycle path runs along the whole section between Stord and Bømlo, with a grass division on the land parts between the road and the path. Underpasses and walls were built with natural stone.|$|E
