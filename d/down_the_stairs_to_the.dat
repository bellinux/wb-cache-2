5|$|Momolo {{came home}} to find the {{apartment}} empty apart from Vitta, Marianna's brother (also called Angelo Padovani), the two policemen and Edgardo himself. At about 20:00 the carabinieri arrived, in two carriages—one for Lucidi and his men, and another in which Agostini would drive Edgardo. Lucidi entered the apartment and took Edgardo from his father's arms, prompting the two policemen who had guarded him to shed tears. Momolo followed the police <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> street, then fainted. Edgardo was passed to Agostini and driven away.|$|E
5|$|Ellen {{encounters}} her possessed {{friend and}} flees into another room, grabbing knives to protect her. Something attempts {{to enter the}} room where Ellen is hiding, and she blindly lashes out with a knife - mistakenly stabbing Scotty who had just returned to the cabin. While horrified, Ellen is then attacked by the possessed Bruce. Ellen manages to trap Bruce outside, stabbing Bruce's hand {{several times in the}} process. The bleeding Scotty tells Ellen to look into the cellar for the gun they brought along. While walking <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cellar, she trips on a broken step and injures herself. After finding the gun, she goes back up stairs and discovers that Scotty had been stabbed to death while she was downstairs. The demonic Bruce then attacks her, but she manages to cut off his hand.|$|E
25|$|Frechette, in her {{harboring}} trial testimony, {{said that}} she told Dillinger {{that the police had}} showed up after speaking to Cummings. Upon hearing Van Meter firing at Coulter, Dillinger opened fire through the door with a Thompson submachine gun, sending Cummings scrambling for cover. Dillinger then stepped out and fired another burst at Cummings. Cummings shot back with a revolver, but quickly ran out of ammunition. He hit Dillinger in the left calf with one of his five shots. He then hastily retreated <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> front entrance. Once Cummings retreated, Dillinger and Frechette hurried down the stairs, exited through the back door and drove away in the Hudson.|$|E
60|$|So {{she came}} holding her dress with one fair rounded arm, and her taper before her, {{tripping}} <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> <b>to</b> greet Esmond.|$|R
60|$|Their {{door opened}} and through our own open door I saw Felicity's white-clad figure flit <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> Aunt Janet's room. From the room she had left came moans and cries.|$|R
6000|$|... "I sha’n’t forget it," [...] ses Isaac, and ’e {{came back}} to the door after ’e’d gone arf-way <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> ask ’em not {{to go out on the}} drink while ’e was away.|$|R
25|$|He {{took the}} {{elevator}} to the executive reception area on the third floor and, as soon as the doors opened, fired at receptionists Sharon Needy, whom he killed, and Angela Bowman, whom he paralyzed with a shot in the back. Searching for Standard Gravure's President, Michael Shea, and other supervisors and managers of the plant, Wesbecker calmly walked through the hallways, deliberately shooting at people. He killed James Husband and injured Forrest Conrad, Paula Warman and John Stein, a bindery supervisor whom he shot in the head and abdomen. Wesbecker then headed <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pressroom, where he killed Paul Sallee and wounded Stanley Hatfield and David Sadenfaden, two electricians from Marine Electric who were working on a broken machine.|$|E
500|$|Already {{skeptical of}} Napolitano's support of [...] "Brasco", Massino was deeply {{disturbed}} by the breach of security when he learned of the agent's true identity. Vitale would later testify {{that this was the}} reason Massino subsequently decided to murder Napolitano as well; as he would later quote Massino, [...] "I have to give him a receipt for the Donnie Brasco situation." [...] In his own testimony, Massino instead claimed Napolitano was targeted for trying to take over the Bonannos himself. On August 17 the former renegade Frank Lino and Steven Cannone drove Napolitano to the house of Ronald Filocomo, a Bonanno family associate, for a meeting. Napolitano was greeted by captain Frank Coppa, then thrown <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> house's basement by Lino and shot to death. [...] Napolitano's body was discovered the following year.|$|E
60|$|The countess hastened <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> courtyard, {{followed}} by Francois and Philip, and received her two unexpected visitors {{as they rode}} across the drawbridge.|$|E
5000|$|On the 16 June 2017 {{episode of}} the The Last Leg on Channel 4, Goma {{appeared}} briefly as Elbow lead singer Guy Garvey was introduced, running <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> cheers from <b>the</b> crowd before the real Garvey appeared.|$|R
60|$|The maid {{turned up}} the gas and then uttered a cry of astonishment. Without waiting to {{question}} the youth she flew out of <b>the</b> room and <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> <b>to</b> return, a few minutes later, with a burly man.|$|R
60|$|Stephen thanked his {{new friend}} for the {{note to the}} bank president, and went slowly <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b> <b>To</b> be keyed up to a battle-pitch, and then to have the battle deferred, is a trial of flesh and spirit.|$|R
60|$|He saw the {{performance}} {{drawing to a}} close. His senses were alert and wilful. He would press his advantages. He followed her and her plain friend <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> street. It was raining.|$|E
60|$|It was Walter {{who broke}} the news, as he came {{tumbling}} <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> berth deck, where Si and Caleb {{were engaged in a}} friendly game of checkers {{on the top of a}} ditty-box.|$|E
60|$|On went her old brown jacket; on went her old brown hat. With a whirl of {{skirts and}} with the {{brilliant}} sparkle still in her eyes, she fluttered {{out the door and}} <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> street.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm all right, young man." [...] Dryfoos {{took his}} hat and stick from him, but he made for the door so uncertainly that Beaton put his hand under his elbow and helped him out, and <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> <b>to</b> his coupe.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will remain}} here," [...] he said, [...] "for the present. Do {{one of you}} take your place in the belfry. Tell Cameron to shout down to you what is passing behind, and do you run {{instantly}} <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> tell me." ...|$|R
60|$|He flew to {{the door}} and called <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> have <b>the</b> dog set free. The spaniel rushed into the room and leaped into his master's outstretched arms. Winterfield {{returned}} his caresses, and kisses him as tenderly as a woman might have kissed her pet.|$|R
60|$|Her disquieting, {{submissive}} smile haunted {{him as he}} roped his way <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> street, {{and then}} the face in the photograph replaced it--the laughing eyes, the wilful, pleasure--loving mouth {{he had seen in}} the school and college pictures of Preston Parr.|$|E
60|$|How-ha grunted, and yielded up the {{obedience}} {{she could}} not withhold; though, as she went <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door, in a tenebrous, glimmering way she wondered that the accident of white skin or swart made master or servant as the case might be.|$|E
6000|$|... "If you please, Madame, {{we will go}} {{down below}} and examine the scene of operations," [...] Monsieur Cavalcadour said; {{and so he was}} marshalled <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> kitchen, which he didn't like to name, and {{appeared}} before the cook in all his splendor.|$|E
6000|$|... "Vy, then, two-and-eightpence," [...] says he. [...] "Go along,--you KNOW it is!" [...] and two-and-eightpence he had; and {{everybody}} applauded Tug, and hissed the cab-boy, and asked Tug {{for something to}} drink. We heard the packet-bell ringing, and all run <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> be in time.|$|R
50|$|Miriam fires Velma, {{who later}} returns to {{discover}} that Charlotte is being drugged. Miriam sees the housekeeper trying to take Charlotte out of the house. The two argue {{at the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b> Velma tries <b>to</b> escape, but knowing that Velma has discovered the drugs, Miriam smashes a chair over her head. Velma falls <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> her death.|$|R
60|$|At {{this moment}} the Squire was heard {{advancing}} <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> shouting <b>to</b> <b>the</b> servants as he came.|$|R
60|$|Her {{exasperation}} {{was somewhat}} increased by {{the expression on}} Trixton Brent's face, which plainly declared that he deemed her last remarks to be the quintessence of tactics; and he obstinately refused, as they went <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> street, to regard the matter as closed.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{dare say}} you are," [...] {{answered}} her aunt, with the dry sound. [...] "Are you ready now? I {{will show you}} the way. The house is very small," [...] continued Lady Barbara, as they went <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground floor; [...] "and this must be your school-room for the present." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{rain was}} pattering on the roof, and as I dressed I had a {{disturbing}} {{vision of the}} long cold ride which lay before me. I hoped the case was not so bad as mother thought. With limbs still numb and weak I stumbled <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sitting room where a faint light shone.|$|E
60|$|Phonny {{was seized}} with so violent a {{convulsion}} of laughter {{at the idea}} of such absurd folly as Beechnut had described, that he tumbled off the bannisters, but fortunately he fell in, towards <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> and was very little hurt. He came <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> Malleville, and as Beechnut returned in a few minutes with the whip, they all went out towards the barn together.|$|R
5000|$|The name Piseinotecus {{comes from}} the Portuguese {{sentence}} [...] "pisei no Teco" [...] (I stepped onto Teco). Teco {{was the name of}} a dog of the zoologists Ernst Marcus and Eveline Du Bois-Reymond Marcus. While {{they were looking for a}} name for the genus, their friend, the zoologist Diva Diniz Corrêa, was visiting them and stated the sentence while coming <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> announce that she had accidentally stepped onto their dog.|$|R
5000|$|Woody {{tries to}} win Claude's {{friendship}} by jokingly saying that Happy was a saw head (funny {{way of saying}} sore head), but gets booted out in the rain. Phoebe comes running <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> rescue <b>the</b> woodpecker, leading Claude to threaten [...] "Phoebe, either that woodpecker goes, or I go!" [...] Phoebe then promptly throws Claude out the door, and tucks Woody into bed with Woody saying [...] "You're a nice lady".|$|R
60|$|The taxi drew {{up at the}} theater. John, with {{a little}} sigh of relief, was already out upon the pavement. Sophy's eyes were still shining at him through her veil, as she walked lightly and {{gracefully}} by his side, but {{he led the way}} in silence <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> box that he had taken for the season.|$|E
6000|$|The smash of the soup-tureen, {{and swift}} descent of the kitchen-maid and soup-ladle <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lower regions. This {{accident}} created a laugh, and rather amused Fitzroy and the company, and caused Funnyman to say, bowing to Rosa, {{that she was}} mistress of herself, though China fall. But she did not heed him, for at that moment another noise commenced, namely, that of-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{confound}} him!" [...] Briggs cried {{under his}} breath, and he shuffled {{out of the}} room and crept noiselessly <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> front door. The door creaked a little in opening, and he left it ajar. The current of cold air that swept up to the companions he had left behind at his room door brought them the noise of his rush down the gravel walk to the gate and a noise there as of fugitive steps on the pavement outside.|$|E
60|$|I start up. She is {{wringing}} her hands. ‘What is wrong?’ I cry, but I {{know before}} she answers. My sister is down {{with one of}} the headaches against which even she cannot fight, and my mother, who bears physical pain {{as if it were a}} comrade, is most woebegone when her daughter is the sufferer. ‘And she winna let me go <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> <b>to</b> make a cup of tea for her,’ she groans.|$|R
50|$|The {{investigation}} {{leads to}} a dead end, so Marc, Amanda and Betty decide to reenact the scene by throwing <b>the</b> Wilhemina mannequin <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> help prove Daniel's innocence. The plan fails because the mannequin is too light, so Marc and Amanda try <b>to</b> push Betty <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> which causes {{all three of them}} to tumble <b>down.</b> Betty discovers <b>the</b> floor was dusty, and remembering that Daniel asked her to clean his dusty coat earlier, concludes that Daniel might be the culprit.|$|R
6000|$|When I {{got back}} that evening, Ada, {{who had been}} rather silent on our way home, came into my room, as she usually did, for a talk, and said, [...] "Agnes, I was going <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> get an ice, and I saw you and Lord Holmeskirk go into the {{conservatory}} together, and you were there when I came up again, and I am quite sure by both your looks {{that he has made}} you an offer. Well?" ...|$|R
