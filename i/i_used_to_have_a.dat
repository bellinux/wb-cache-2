6000|$|This {{brings me}} {{to one of the}} many {{advantages}} that my brier had over all other pipes. It has given me a reputation for gallantry, to which without it I fear I could lay no claim. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> passion for repartee, especially in the society of ladies. But it is with me as with many other men of parts whose wit has ever to be fired by a long fuse: my best things strike me as I wend my way home. This embittered my early days; and not till the pride of youth had been tamed could I stop to lay in a stock of repartee on likely subjects the night before. Then my pipe helped me. It was the apparatus that carried me to my prettiest compliment. Having exposed my pipe in some prominent place where it could hardly escape notice, I took measures for insuring a visit from a lady, young, graceful, accomplished. Or I might have it ready for a chance visitor. On her arrival, I conducted her to a seat near my pipe. It is not good to hurry on to the repartee at once; so I talked for a time of the weather, the theatres, the new novel. I kept my eye on her; and by and by she began to look about her. She observed the strange-looking pipe. Now is the critical moment. It is possible that she may pass it by without remark, in which case all is lost; but experience has shown me that four times out of six she touches it in assumed horror, to pass some humorous remark. Off tumbles the bowl. [...] "Oh," [...] she exclaims, [...] "see what I have done! I am so sorry!" [...] I pull myself together. [...] "Madame," [...] I reply calmly, and bowing low, [...] "what else was to be expected? You came near my pipe--and it lost its head." [...] She blushes, but cannot help being pleased; and I set my pipe for the next visitor. By the help of a note-book, of course, I guarded myself against paying this very neat compliment to any person more than once.

6000|$|It was advertised {{to begin}} at half-past two o'clock of a certain Saturday, and punctually at the stroke of the hour, from my room across a wide court, I heard a sudden {{multiplication}} of sounds and confusion of tongues in the Corso. I was writing to a friend for whom I cared more than for any mere romp; but as the minutes elapsed and the hubbub deepened curiosity {{got the better of}} affection, and I remembered that I was really within eye-shot of an affair the fame of which had ministered to the daydreams of my infancy. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> scrap-book with a coloured print of the starting of the bedizened wild horses, and the use of a library rich in keepsakes and annuals with a frontispiece commonly of a masked lady in a balcony, the heroine of a delightful tale further on. Agitated by these tender memories I descended into the street; but I confess I looked in vain for a masked lady who might serve as a frontispiece, in vain for any object whatever that might adorn a tale. Masked and muffled ladies there were in abundance; but their masks were of ugly wire, perfectly resembling the little covers placed upon strong cheese in German hotels, and their drapery was a shabby water-proof with the hood pulled over their chignons. They were armed with great tin scoops or funnels, with which they solemnly shovelled lime and flour out of bushel-baskets and down on the heads {{of the people in the}} street. They were packed into balconies all the way along the straight vista of the Corso, in which their calcareous shower maintained a dense, gritty, unpalatable fog. The crowd was compact in the street, and the Americans in it were tossing back confetti out of great satchels hung round their necks. It was quite the [...] "you're another" [...] sort of repartee, and less seasoned than I had hoped with the airy mockery tradition hangs about this festival. The scene was striking, in a word; but somehow not as I had dreamed of its being. I stood regardful, I suppose, but with a peculiarly tempting blankness of visage, for in a moment I received half a bushel of flour on my too-philosophic head. Decidedly it was an ignoble form of humour. I shook my ears like an emergent diver, and had a sudden vision of how still and sunny and solemn, how peculiarly and undisturbedly themselves, how secure from any intrusion less sympathetic than one's own, certain outlying parts of Rome must just then be. The Carnival had received its deathblow in my imagination; and it has been ever since but a thin and dusky ghost of pleasure that has flitted at intervals in and out of my consciousness.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know what}} you want to say," [...] she went on; [...] "you want to say that he spoils me, and I don't see why you should hesitate. You {{generally}} say everything you want, and you need n't be afraid of me. He does n't spoil me, simply because I am so bad I can't be spoiled; but that 's of no consequence. I was spoiled ages ago; every one spoiled me--every one except Mrs. Vivian. I was always fond of having everything I want, and I generally managed to get it. I always had lovely clothes; mamma thought that was a kind of a duty. If it was a duty, I don't suppose it counts {{as a part of the}} spoiling. But I was very much indulged, and I know I have everything now. Gordon is a perfect husband; I believe if I were to ask him for a present of his nose, he would cut it off and give it to me. I think I will ask him for a small piece of it some day; it will rather improve him to have an inch or two less. I don't say he 's handsome; but he 's just as good as he can be. Some people say that if you are very fond of a person you always think them handsome; but I don't agree with that at all. I am very fond of Gordon, and yet I am not blinded by affection, as regards his personal appearance. He 's too light for my taste, and too red. And because you think people handsome, it does n't follow that you are fond of them. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> friend who was awfully handsome--the handsomest man I ever saw--and I was perfectly conscious of his defects. But I 'm not conscious of Gordon's, and I don't believe he has got any. He 's so intensely kind; it 's quite pathetic. One would think he had done me an injury in marrying me, and that he wanted to make up for it. If he has done me an injury I have n't discovered it yet, and I don't believe I ever shall. I certainly shall not as long as he lets me order all the clothes I want. I have ordered five dresses this week, and I mean to order two more. When I told Gordon, what do you think he did? He simply kissed me. Well, if that 's not expressive, I don't know what he could have done. He kisses me about seventeen times a day. I suppose it 's very improper for a woman to tell any one how often her husband kisses her; but, as you happen to have seen him do it, I don't suppose you will be scandalized. I know you are not easily scandalized; I am not afraid of you. You are scandalized at my getting so many dresses? Well, I told you I was spoiled--I freely acknowledge it. That 's why I was afraid to tell Gordon--because when I was married I had such a lot of things; I was supposed to have dresses enough to last for a year. But Gordon had n't to pay for them, so there was no harm in my letting him feel that he has a wife. If he thinks I am extravagant, he can easily stop kissing me. You don't think it would be easy to stop? It 's very well, then, for those that have never begun!" ...|$|E

She had drawn Mrs. Gereth to a sofa with a vague instinct of pacifying her and still, after all, gaining time; but it was a position in which her great duped benefactress, portentously patient again during this demonstration, looked far from inviting a [...] "hug." [...] Fleda found herself tricking out the situation with artificial flowers, trying to talk even herself into the fancy that Owen, whose name she now made simple and sweet, might come in upon them at any moment. She felt an immense need to be understood and justified; she averted her face in dread from all that she might have to be forgiven. She pressed on her companion's arm as if to keep her quiet till she should really know, and then, after a minute, she poured out the clear essence of what in happier days had been her [...] "secret." [...] "You mustn't think I don't adore him when I've told him so to his face. I love him so that I'd die for him--I love him so that it's horrible. Don't look at me therefore as if I had not been kind, as if I had not been as tender as if he were dying and my tenderness were what would save him. Look at me as if you believe me, as if you feel what I've been through. Darling Mrs. Gereth, I could kiss the ground he walks on. I haven't a rag of pride; I used to have, but it's gone. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> secret, but every one knows it now, and any one who looks at me can say, I think, what's the matter with me. It's not so very fine, my secret, and the less one really says about it the better; but I want you to have it from me because I was stiff before. I want you to see for yourself that I've been brought as low as a girl can very well be. It serves me right," [...] Fleda laughed, [...] "if I was ever proud and horrid to you! I don't know what you wanted me, in those days at Ricks, to do, but I don't think you can have wanted much more than what I've done. The other day at Maggie's I did things that made me, afterwards, think of you! I don't know what girls may do; but if he doesn't know that there isn't an inch of me that isn't his--!" [...] Fleda sighed as if she couldn't express it; she piled it up, as she would have said; holding Mrs. Gereth with dilated eyes, she seemed to sound her for the effect of these words. [...] "It's idiotic," [...] she wearily smiled; [...] "it's so strange that I'm almost angry for it, and the strangest part of all is that it isn't even happiness. It's anguish--it was from the first; from the first there was a bitterness and a kind of dread. But I owe you every word of the truth. You don't do him justice, either: he's a dear, I assure you he's a dear. I'd trust him to the last breath; I don't think you really know him. He's ever so much cleverer than he makes a show of; he's remarkable in his own shy way. You told me at Ricks that you wanted me to let myself go, and I've 'gone' quite far enough to discover as much as that, as well as all sorts of other delightful things about him. You'll tell me I make myself out worse than I am," [...] said the girl, feeling more and more in her companion's attitude a quality that treated her speech as a desperate rigmarole and even perhaps as a piece of cold immodesty. She wanted to make herself out [...] "bad"--it was a part of her justification; but it suddenly occurred to her that such a picture of her extravagance imputed a want of gallantry to the young man. [...] "I don't care for anything you think," [...] she declared, [...] "because Owen, don't you know, sees me as I am. He's so kind that it makes up for everything!" ...|$|E
40|$|Peace {{negotiations}} with guerrilla groups in Colombia have proceeded {{for more than}} 50 years. It has become clear {{that the only way}} to put an end to the conflict that would conciliate each party is to equally involve in the process the guerrillas, the government, the civilian population, as well as the victims of violence. I have been working on this topic since the 1990 s, when I pursued postgraduate studies in international relations at the Pontifícia Universidad Javeriana. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> great expectations in connection with future professional possibilities until I started to gather more knowledge of the different aspects of peace talks, and I realised how compelling the question of human rights can be. This was the reason why I undertook to examine a neutral community (La India, Santander, Colombia) whose values and experiences are useful and important...|$|R
50|$|He was in Mosaddeq's {{house in}} 1953 coup -which was {{triggered}} by CIA- and broke his leg while he tried to escape there. After the coup he hid from the government for about 2.5 years then {{he was arrested and}} was in prison for about five months. After release he established a private business. He was arrested again in 1957 because Shah who was in power again after the 1953 coup suspected that he was working against the government. He {{became a member of the}} second National front of Iran after release but he was not as active as the past in this new political party as he himself has said “I did not have the Heat that <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> before”. He went to the United States in 1980 one year after the Islamic revolution and lived there for many years before his return to Iran.|$|R

Its effect is {{not quite the same}} every morning, but if this clock’s buzzer were not to wake me more or less on time, I would get another one. The clock {{performs}} a task for me, a task that I set it, but that is part of a much wider context of labour regimes, disciplined bodies, and collective, co-ordinated social life. To be able to wake me in time, the alarm clock as a material object is also part of a much wider regime of clock production, batteries and the calibration of time. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> an alarm clock of a particularly sturdy German make that even checked its time via...|$|R
