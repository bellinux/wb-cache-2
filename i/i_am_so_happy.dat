[...] What will there be between us old codgers, aside of course from happy memories of skiing tours in the long distant past ... Will you come to me mainly to take receipt of the promised gift I have held for you in our cellar—that long cured Westphalian ham, and those patiently waiting bottles of your favorite nectar: Johannisberger 1937? [...] Could these things of the senses end up being all that there is between us? [...] <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>so</b> <b>happy</b> that the moment approaches, but my heart is heavy..." ...|$|E

And kind of even more amazingly emotional releasing {{it into the}} world. everyone is listening + judging + praising or ripping apart my work… words… melodies… sounds...songs… + stories. Some people get it and some dont. It so scary… but its so rewarding too. There is this little 15 year old girl inside of me who is jumping for joy. She's screaming 'We did it christina!!!!

2500|$|In these {{difficult}} times {{the one person}} who continuously provided moral support to Pisemsky was Ivan Turgenev. In 1869 he informed Pisemsky that his One Thousand Souls had been translated into German and enjoyed [...] "great success in Berlin". [...] "So now {{the time has come for}} you to step outside the borders of your motherland and for Aleksey Pisemsky to become a European name," [...] Turgenev wrote on October 9, 1869. [...] "The best Berlin critic, Frenzel, in National Zeitung devoted a whole article to you where he calls your novel 'a rare phenomenon', and I tell you, now you are well known in Germany," [...] wrote Turgenev in another letter, enclosing clips from other papers, too. [...] "The success of One Thousand Souls encourages [...] to start upon the novel Troubled Seas and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>so</b> <b>happy</b> both for you and for Russian literature in general… Critical reviews of One Thousand Souls here in Germany are most favourable, your characters are being compared to those of Dickens, Thackeray, etc, etc", he continued. Julian Schmidt’s large article in Zeitgenossensche [...] Bilder, part of the series devoted to first class European authors, provided for Pisemsky another cause to celebrate, and following Turgenev's advice, in 1875 he visited Schmidt to thank him personally.|$|E

2500|$|His {{reputation}} grew {{with several}} exhibitions in Germany and Switzerland in 1920. He was provided with many subjects to paint {{as he came}} to know the farmers of the area, who were amazed by Kirchner's gramophone. Kirchner writes {{of the people of}} Davos: [...] "The people who live here are proud. The hard work, which is done with great love, the way they treat animals (you very seldom see an animal being mishandled) entitle them to be proud. In most cases, work here has reached the ideal standard of being done with love. You can see it in the movements of their hands. And that, in turn, ennobles the facial expression and imbues all personal contacts with a great delicacy. This is a country in which democracy has become reality. Here a man’s word still counts, and you need have no fears about sleeping with your doors open. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>so</b> <b>happy</b> to be allowed to be here, and through hard work I should like to thank the people for the kindness they have shown me". Kirchner began writing critiques of his own art under the pseudonym of Louis de Marsalle in order to control public opinion of him and free himself of dependence upon the art critics of the day.|$|E

6000|$|He {{took her}} head between her hands, and kissed it, and said: [...] "It shall <b>be</b> done. <b>I</b> trust {{to you to}} do it for me, now and secretly; and to tell him that I would forgive him, if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> <b>happy</b> as to know for what." ...|$|R
