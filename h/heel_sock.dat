50|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1900. In 1992, they {{purchased}} the Nelson Knitting Company of Rockford, Illinois, {{and in the process}} acquired the trademark on the Red <b>Heel</b> <b>socks</b> used to make sock monkeys. Fox River Mills includes instructions for making a sock monkey in every packet of Red <b>Heel</b> <b>socks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The iconic sock monkeys {{made from}} red-heeled socks, {{known today as}} the Rockford Red Heel, emerged at the {{earliest}} in 1932, the year the Nelson Knitting Company added the trademark red heel to its product. In 1932, advertising executive Howard Monk {{came up with an}} idea to change the heel of the brown sock from white to red. The red <b>heeled</b> <b>sock</b> was marketed as [...] "de-tec-tip." [...] Nelson Knitting added the red heel [...] "De-Tec-Tip" [...] to assure its customers that they were buying [...] "original Rockfords" [...] as opposed to the generic [...] "Rockfords". This red heel gave the monkeys their distinctive mouth and during the Great Depression, American crafters first made sock monkeys out of worn-out Rockford Red <b>Heel</b> <b>Socks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Large cowry shells {{such as that}} of a Cypraea tigris {{have been}} used in Europe in the recent past as a darning egg over which <b>sock</b> <b>heels</b> were stretched. The cowry's smooth surface allows the needle to be {{positioned}} under the cloth more easily.|$|R
50|$|Linen stitch {{is a type}} of {{knitting}} stitch {{that creates}} a tightly-knit fabric that resembles woven linen. Tailored garments are especially suited for the linen stitch. It is a durable stitch, and is often used to reinforce the <b>heels</b> of hand-knitted <b>socks.</b> It includes knit and purl stitches, as well as slipped stitches.|$|R
50|$|Cotswold wool is {{exceedingly}} strong, added by knitters to <b>sock</b> <b>heels</b> and toes to give extra strength to socks, and to elbows in hand-knitted sweaters. When worn in the woodlands, one doesn't leave bits of one's sweater in the brush. To the contrary: The brush is often torn from its stalk by the stout-fibered wool.|$|R
50|$|Foot fetishism {{has been}} defined as a {{pronounced}} sexual interest in the feet, mostly female feet. Extensions of this fetish include shoes and tickling. Sigmund Freud considered foot binding as a form of fetishism. For a foot fetishist, points of attraction include the shape and size of feet and toes (e.g., long toes, short toes, painted toenails, high arches, soles etc.), jewelry (e.g., toe rings, anklets, etc.), treatments (such as massaging, washing partner's feet, or painting partner's toenails), state of dress (barefoot, flip flops, sandals, high <b>heels,</b> hosiery, <b>socked</b> feet, etc.), odor, and/or sensory interaction (e.g., rubbing the foot, tickling, smelling, kissing, biting, licking, sucking toes, rubbing genitals on foot, etc.).|$|R
50|$|Large cowry shells {{such as that}} of {{this species}} were used in Europe in the recent past as a frame over which <b>sock</b> <b>heels</b> were {{stretched}} for darning, i.e. instead of using a darning egg. The cowry's smooth surface allows the darning needle to be positioned under the cloth more easily than when using a darning mushroom made of wood.|$|R
50|$|Similar to {{increases}} and decreases, a common use for short rows is in shaping, e.g., in making <b>sock</b> <b>heels</b> or French darts near the bust point. Short rows introduce extra rows ("courses") of knitting, whereas increases introduce extra columns ("wales"). In principle, any shaping possible with other increase/decrease method {{is also possible}} with short rows. However, such shaping is often harder to visualize.|$|R
5|$|On November 17, Yang Shu-chun of Chinese Taipei, was {{abruptly}} disqualified with 12 {{seconds left}} {{in the first round of}} the taekwondo competition, while leading her opponent 9â€“0. She was accused of having installed illegal sensors on the <b>heel</b> of her <b>socks.</b> The event quickly turned into an international incident, with officials, politicians and public opinion from Chinese Taipei, China and South Korea trading accusations of manipulation and fraud.|$|R
5000|$|A darning egg is an egg-shaped tool, made of stone, porcelain, wood, {{or similar}} hard material, which is {{inserted}} into the toe or <b>heel</b> of the <b>sock</b> {{to hold it in}} the proper shape and provide a firm foundation for repairs. When the repairs are finished, the darning egg is removed. A shell of the tiger cowry Cypraea tigris, a popular ornament in Europe and elsewhere, was also sometimes used as a ready-made darning egg.|$|R
50|$|The {{students}} of grades 11th and 12th {{are required to}} have two navy blue stripes on the left sleeve of the shirt/kameez. The boys have to wear black Oxford shoes with black socks. The girls are to wear black ladies shoe having low <b>heels</b> with white <b>socks.</b> The prefects are given a captain badge which they have to wear during the school hours. Students are also required to wear the identity card given by the school authority.|$|R
5000|$|John Nelson's son Franklin {{created a}} machine that knitted a sock without seams in the heel. The {{original}} machine required workers to sew every seam at the <b>heel.</b> The seamless <b>sock</b> saved time and labor costs and it became so popular, companies began to imitate his idea. [...] These seamless work socks were so popular that the market was soon flooded with imitators, and socks of this type were known under the generic term [...] "Rockfords".|$|R
5000|$|A sock puppet is {{a puppet}} {{made from a}} sock or similar garment. The {{puppeteer}} wears the sock on a hand and lower arm {{as if it were}} a glove, with the puppet's mouth being formed by the region between the <b>sock's</b> <b>heel</b> and toe, and the puppeteer's thumb acting as the jaw. The arrangement of the fingers forms the shape of a mouth, which is sometimes padded with a hard piece of felt, often with a tongue glued inside.|$|R
5000|$|Yang {{was facing}} Vietnamese {{opponent}} Vu Thi Hau {{in the first}} round of the flyweight division (under 49 kilogram) of the Asian Games taekwondo competition in Guangzhou, Guangdong, China on November 17, 2010, when she was accused of using the [...] "unauthorized" [...] sensors. During the pre-match testing of equipment, the referee discovered that Yang had two extra sensors on the <b>heels</b> of each <b>sock,</b> which she was asked to remove. She fought without the two additional sensors on her socks.|$|R

The central {{design is}} a dress by Walter Van Beirendonck, {{inspired by the}} colourful clothing of the Hui'an women of Quanzhou, China. The flanking designs are by the German-born fashion designer Bernhard Wilhelm. On the left a jersey sweater with elbows like the <b>heels</b> of a <b>sock,</b> and a skirt with alternating strips of knitted wool and loose threads. On the right the Beefeater wool jacket and Superflyskirt jersey dress.|$|R
5000|$|Since {{knitted fabric}} is {{generally}} elastic, it conforms readily to the wearer's body without shaping. However, some shaping {{may be necessary}} when the knitted fabrics are unusually stiff (e.g., thick cable designs or heavily overstitched designs) or in regions of high curvature (e.g. <b>sock</b> <b>heels).</b> Ironically, shaping is much easier and less obvious with knitted fabrics than with woven cloth. Instead of cutting out wedges and sewing the edges together, knitters can add or subtract stitches; work short rows; or, most subtly of all, change the needle size to produce smaller/larger stitches in the desired [...] "wedge" [...] region.|$|R
5000|$|Darning is {{a sewing}} {{technique}} for repairing holes or worn areas in fabric or knitting using needle and thread alone. It is often done by hand, {{but it is}} also possible to darn with a sewing machine. Hand darning employs the darning stitch, a simple running stitch in which the thread is [...] "woven" [...] in rows along the grain of the fabric, with the stitcher reversing direction {{at the end of each}} row, and then filling in the framework thus created, as if weaving. Darning is a traditional method for repairing fabric damage or holes that do not run along a seam, and where patching is impractical or would create discomfort for the wearer, such as on the <b>heel</b> of a <b>sock.</b>|$|R

[...] And he pointed to my work 'Yes,' they say to one another, these so kind ladies, 'he is a stupid old fellow, he will see not what we do, he will never observe that his <b>sock</b> <b>heels</b> go not in holes any more, he will think his buttons grow out new when they fall, and believe that strings make theirselves.' [...] "Ah! But I haf an eye, and I see much. I haf a heart, and I feel thanks for this. Come, a little lesson then and now, or--no more good fairy works for me and mine." ...|$|R
