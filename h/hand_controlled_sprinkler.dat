These devices were transmitting the decisions to electronic controller devices, which <b>control</b> <b>sprinkler</b> or drip irrigation system. Several moisture sensors were commercially available, such as tensiometers. Some researchers used tensiometers sensors in irrigation scheduling for tomato under drip irrigation system (Mendez-Barroso et al. 2008; Smajstrla and Locascio 1997). They found that the tomato crop during 4  years had a water tension equal to 10  cb.|$|R
40|$|A novel {{device was}} {{developed}} {{that will allow}} laparoscopic surgeons to hand-operate standard electrosurgical equipment, eliminating the use of electrosurgical foot pedals, which typically cause static, unstable and non-neutral body positions. Accordingly, {{the aim of this}} study was to quantitatively and qualitatively determine the optimal ergonomic placement of the novel electrosurgical <b>hand</b> <b>controls</b> integrated into a standard laparoscopic grasper to optimize functionality. Three distinct <b>hand</b> <b>control</b> designs were evaluated by 26 participants during the performance of four basic inanimate laparoscopic electrosurgical tasks. <b>Hand</b> <b>control</b> actuation force and user preference were evaluated for each <b>hand</b> <b>control</b> design. The results indicate that <b>hand</b> <b>control</b> design 1 (CD 1) resulted in the ability to generate significantly greater actuation force for three of the four tasks (P < 0. 05). Additionally, CD 1 was subjectively rated significantly better for comfort and ease-of-use compared to the other two <b>hand</b> <b>control</b> designs (P < 0. 05). As a result, CD 1 was determined to be an advantageous ergonomic design placement for the novel electrosurgical <b>hand</b> <b>controls</b> integrated into a standard laparoscopic grasper.

40|$|Information Technology (IT) {{is a key}} {{component}} of an organisation's business strategy. By leveraging from it, organisations are able to create a sustainable competitive advantage and ultimately enable overall business success. IT has the power to transform an organisation and as a result comes accompanied with a set of issues that challenge the status quo. These issues need to be addressed because good implementation alone will not suffice. By adopting a project management view to the implementation of IT, the structured approach provides a forum within which the transformation can be managed. A number of studies conducted on IT projects indicate that they are prone to failure due to poor management. This research paper seeks to determine the necessary factors that prevail to ensure IT project success. A field study on <b>Controlled</b> <b>Sprinkler</b> Supplies Pty Ltd is the basis for this research. The IT project at <b>Controlled</b> <b>Sprinkler</b> Supplies encompasses the changeover of its Unix based accounting system to a more progressive enterprise business management solution, Navision Software. Both quantitative and qualitative data is collected by means of administering questionnaires, conducting interviews with the project manager and {{the chief executive officer of}} the company, and by observations made by the researcher. An analysis of the data highlights some interesting points. Without a doubt, training plays a major role in the success of a project. In addition, while management support is of paramount importance, clear communication of the vision is not enough. Participation by organisational members should not be overlooked as it enhances ownership and develops champions of the change and the technology. Furthermore, despite the fact that the literature associates organisational change with resistance, this study demonstrates the contrary. This is due to the change agent's hands-on approach and commitment to the project...|$|R

50|$|Foot pedals can be raised, {{relocated}} (for instance swapped {{to be used}} by {{the opposite}} leg) or replaced with hand-controlled devices. The common form of <b>hand</b> <b>controls</b> consists of a push-pull handle mounted below and projecting {{to the side of the}} steering wheel housing. The bar connects by levers to the accelerator and brake pedals, and is typically pivoted so that pushing applies the accelerator while pulling applies the brake. As there is no facility to work a clutch pedal, <b>hand</b> <b>controls</b> must generally be used in cars with automatic transmissions. With one hand continuously engaged working the <b>hand</b> <b>controls,</b> the steering wheel will generally also be fitted with a steering knob to allow one-handed use. More complex fittings may also connect into the electronic circuitry of the vehicle to place indicator and other switches in easy reach of the driver without requiring them to release the <b>hand</b> <b>controls</b> or steering knob. A guard plate may be fitted to prevent inadvertent contact between the driver's feet and the pedals. Extension levers or adapted grips may also be fitted to the parking brake to allow it to be applied by a driver with limited hand or arm strength.|$|R

40|$|Twenty {{subjects}} with lower limb disabilities {{participated in a}} simulator study. The {{purpose of the study}} was to investigate how an Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) system together with two different <b>hand</b> <b>controls</b> for accelerator and brake influenced workload, comfort and driving behaviour and to further develop a method to evaluate vehicle adaptations for drivers with disabilities. The installed ACC system could maintain a constant speed selected and set by the driver and it also adapted speed in order to keep a safe distance to a leading vehicle. Furthermore, it included a stop-and-go function. Two common types of <b>hand</b> <b>controls</b> for accelerator and brake were used. The <b>hand</b> <b>controls</b> were different both with respect to function, single or dual levers, and position, on the steering column or between the front seats. The subjects were all experienced drivers of adapted cars equipped with <b>hand</b> <b>controls.</b> All subjects drove 100 km at two occasions, with and without the ACC system available but with the same <b>hand</b> <b>control.</b> Subjective workload was found to be significantly lower and performance better for the ACC condition. The difference in speed variation between manual and ACC supported driving increased with the distance driven which seems to support the previous finding. The subjects thought they could control both speed and distance to leading vehicles better while the ACC was available. ACC driving did not influence reaction time, speed level, lateral position or variation in lateral position. Headway during car following situations was shorter for the ACC condition compared to manual driving. The ACC was well received, trusted and wanted. It was concluded that the ACC system substantially decreased workload, increased comfort and did not influence safety negatively. The only difference found between the two types of <b>hand</b> <b>controls</b> was that drivers using the dual lever system had less variation in lateral position. The applied evaluation method proved to be useful but needs to be further developed...|$|R
