25|$|The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) {{recommends}} statin {{treatment for}} adults {{with an estimated}} 10 year risk of developing cardiovascular disease that is greater than 10%. Guidelines by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association recommend statin treatment for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults with LDL cholesterol ≥ 190mg/dL or those with diabetes, age 40–75 with LDL-C 70–190mg/dl; or in those with a 10-year risk of developing heart attack or stroke of 7.5% or more. In this latter group, statin assignment was not automatic, but was recommended to occur only after a clinician-patient risk discussion with shared decision making where other risk factors and lifestyle are addressed, the potential for benefit from a statin is weighed against the potential for adverse effects or drug interactions and informed patient preference is elicited. Moreover, if a risk decision was uncertain, factors such as family history, coronary calcium score, ankle-brachial index, and an inflammation test (hs-CRP ≥ 2.0mg/L) were suggested to inform the risk decision. Additional factors {{that could be used}} were an LDL-C ≥ 160 or a very high lifetime risk. However, critics such as Steven E. Nissen say that the AHA/ACC guidelines were not properly validated, overestimate the risk by at least 50%, and recommend statins for patients who will not benefit, based on populations whose observed risk is lower than predicted by the guidelines.

40|$|A recent widely publicised Lancet {{review of}} statin {{efficacy}} and safety data generated more controversy than it resolved. Led by Professor Rory Collins of Oxford University, the review {{claimed that the}} benefits of statins have been underestimated and the risks exaggerated. Claims of statin intolerance in up to 20 % of patients, the review argues, are not supported by largescale evidence from randomised trials. In fact, Collins et al. claim that statin therapy is no less well tolerated than placebo. Collins further claimed that the controversy about statin intolerance and myopathy rates emerged only in the past 2 or 3 years as manufacturers began marketing newer and “very expensive” cholesterol-lowering agents, such as, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK 9) inhibitors for patients classified as statin intolerant. He also pointed out that industry has funded reports on statin intolerance, {{as in the case of}} the <b>European</b> <b>Atherosclerosis</b> <b>Society’s</b> report 2 which, not only had funding from makers of PCSK 9 inhibitors, but also had its meetings coordinated by a commercial entity funded by the manufacturers. peer-reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Background: Impractical use of {{pharmaceuticals}} is {{a serious}} problem of the Russian healthcare system. Implementation of pharmacoeconomic analysis into the logistic technologies of medical organizations may promote the solution of this problem. Aim: To analyze real-practice data on medical therapy of patients with stable ischemic heart disease (IHD) during their hospital stay for transcutaneous coronary stent placement and coronary artery bypass grafting. Materials and methods: With the help of a structured form on medical treatment we extracted and analyzed data from 131 clinical records of patients with stable IHD who were hospitalized in 2014 to the Department of Internal Diseases and Department of Cardiovascular Surgery; 60 were patients after stent placement and 71, after coronary artery bypass grafting. We performed an ABC/VEN analysis of their treatment. Groups of pharmaceuticals for VEN analysis were formed according to the Recommendations of Russian National <b>Atherosclerosis</b> <b>Society</b> on Diagnosis and treatment of chronic IHD (Recommendations of Russian National <b>Atherosclerosis</b> <b>Society,</b> 2013) based on European Society of Cardiology guidelines on the management of stable coronary artery disease (ESC guidelines, 2013). We assessed if the treatment administered corresponded to the current Standard of care to patients with stable IHD – SMP No 2. 01. 216. 0 (Russian Federal Standard, 2007). Results: A mismatch between medical treatment that was performed in the Departments of Internal Diseases and of Cardiovascular Surgery, and that recommended by the Russian Federal Standard (2007), was found. The regimens used include the majority of agents recommended by the Russian National <b>Atherosclerosis</b> <b>Society</b> (2013) and the ESC guidelines (2013). In the Department of Internal Diseases, the mean cost of medical treatment during the whole period of stay in the hospital was 79. 6 rubles. The group A agents (those with cumulative cost percentage = 80 %) were represented by 9 items from the total of 54. There was a low percentage of medicines that were not indicated for this disease (13 agents, or 9. 5 % of the total medical costs), and all of them were administered for the treatment of concomitant disorders. In general, medical treatment performed in the Department of Internal Diseases corresponded to the ESC guidelines (2013). The costs of medical treatment during the whole period of stay in the Department of Cardiovascular Surgery was 10 741. 9 rubles. The group A included 9 agents from the total of 78 used. Sixty eight per cent of costs were related to pharmaceuticals not having compelling indications (solutions, detoxification agents, agents for prevention of gastrointestinal adverse effects), whereas the costs of vitally important drugs were only 12. 3 % of the total and those of necessary drugs (including antibacterials), 19. 7 %. Conclusion: It is obviously necessary to update the current Russian Federal Standard (2007), with inclusion of data corresponding to the worldwide trends and guidelines of the Russian National <b>Atherosclerosis</b> <b>Society</b> (2013), at least for two patient groups: those after coronary stent placement and after coronary artery bypass grafting. The elaboration of criteria for administration of medical treatment and strict compliance with them in the real practice would allow for controlling of medical treatment costs, to prevent polypragmasia and adverse drug reactions.  </p...|$|R

40|$|Recommendations for statin use {{for primary}} {{prevention}} of {{coronary heart disease}} (CHD) are based on estimation of the 10 -year CHD risk.

The proportions of participants classified as high-risk for CHD were 12. 5 % (15. 4 % with extrapolation), 3. 0 %, and 5. 8 %, respectively. Proportions of participants eligible for statins were 9. 2 % (11. 6 % with extrapolation), 13. 7 %, and 16. 7 %, respectively. Assuming full compliance to each guideline, expected relative decreases in CHD deaths in Switzerland over a 10 -year period would be 16. 4 % (17. 5 % with extrapolation), 18. 7 %, and 19. 3 %, respectively; the corresponding numbers needed to treat to prevent 1 CHD death would be 285 (340 with extrapolation), 380, and 440, respectively. In conclusion, the proportion of subjects classified as high risk for CHD varied over a fivefold range across recommendations.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{potential}} for global collaborations to better inform public health policy regarding major non-communicable diseases {{has been successfully}} demonstrated by several large-scale international consortia. However, the true public health impact of familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH), a common genetic disorder associated with premature cardiovascular disease, {{is yet to be}} reliably ascertained using similar approaches. The <b>European</b> <b>Atherosclerosis</b> <b>Society</b> FH Studies Collaboration (EAS FHSC) is a new initiative of international stakeholders which will help establish a global FH registry to generate large-scale, robust data on the burden of FH worldwide. METHODS: The EAS FHSC will maximise the potential exploitation of currently available and future FH data (retrospective and prospective) by bringing together regional/national/international data sources with access to individuals with a clinical and/or genetic diagnosis of heterozygous or homozygous FH. A novel bespoke electronic platform and FH Data Warehouse will be developed to allow secure data sharing, validation, cleaning, pooling, harmonisation and analysis irrespective of the source or format. Standard statistical procedures will allow us to investigate cross-sectional associations, patterns of real-world practice, trends over time, and analyse risk and outcomes (e. g. cardiovascular outcomes, all-cause death), accounting for potential confounders and subgroup effects. CONCLUSIONS: The EAS FHSC represents an excellent opportunity to integrate individual efforts across the world to tackle the global burden of FH. The information garnered from the registry will help reduce gaps in knowledge, inform best practices, assist in clinical trials design, support clinical guidelines and policies development, and ultimately improve the care of FH patients.

40|$|The {{relation}} between serum cholesterol concentrations and {{the incidence of}} coronary heart disease is continuous and curvilinear; there is neither epidemiological nor biological {{evidence to support the}} existence of a threshold value. There is a clinical need, however, for an acceptable definition of action limits and desirable ranges, based on the evidence that raised cholesterol concentrations are causally related to atherosclerotic heart disease. The <b>European</b> <b>Atherosclerosis</b> <b>Society</b> has proposed a set of cut off points, which, together with age and the presence of other risk factors, direct the clinician to an appropriate level of treatment. Because the changes of serum cholesterol during adult life appear unphysiological, these action limits do not require adjustment for age.
