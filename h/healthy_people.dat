40|$|In Japan, the world’s most rapidly aging country, health {{promotion}} services are often provided for elderly people, especially frail {{elderly and disabled}} people.

5|$|In {{the form}} {{trivalent}} chromium, Cr(III), or Cr3+, chromium {{was identified as}} an essential nutrient in the late 1950s and later accepted as a trace element for its roles in the action of insulin, a hormone critical to the metabolism and storage of carbohydrate, fat and protein.

40|$|Introduction & Objective: Psoriasis is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} disease, {{which seems to}} be caused by genetic and immunological factors. Several studies have shown that some hormones so such as prolactin have important {{role in the development of}} this disease. In this study, the se-rum levels of prolactin have been were measured in patients with psoriasis and compared with <b>healthy</b> <b>peoples.</b> Materials & Methods: In this case –control study, we evaluated 24 ages and sex matched pa-tients with psoriasis referring to the department of dermatology of Farshchian hospital in Hamadan during one year (Apr. 2013 -May. 2014) and compared them with healthy individuals. A PASI criterion was used to measure the severity of the disease. In the both groups, serum levels of prolactin and TSH (to discover hypothyroidism and due to hyperprolactinemia) were measured using ELISA method. Results: Serum levels of prolactin in the patients and <b>healthy</b> <b>peoples</b> were 12. 8 ± 9. 1 and 8. 9 ± 3. 6 ng/ml, respectively. In evaluating prolactin the differences between the patients and <b>healthy</b> <b>peoples</b> were significant (P= 0. 04). Conclusion: These results indicate that serum PRL levels may serve as a biological marker of psoriatic disease activity. (Sci J Hamadan Univ Med Sci 2015; 22 (1) : 43 - 47...|$|R

5|$|The {{protein that}} prions {{are made of}} (PrP) is found {{throughout}} the body, even in <b>healthy</b> <b>people</b> and animals.

The normal form of the protein is called PrPC, while the infectious form is called PrPSc— the C refers to 'cellular' PrP, while the Sc refers to 'scrapie', the prototypic prion disease, occurring in sheep. While PrPC is structurally well-defined, PrPSc is certainly polydisperse and defined at a relatively poor level. PrP can be induced to fold into other more-or-less well-defined isoforms in vitro, {{and their relationship to}} the form(s) that are pathogenic in vivo is not yet clear.|$|E
40|$|From the {{perspective}} of disease prevention, the enhancement of cognitive function among the <b>healthy</b> older <b>people</b> has become an important issue in many countries lately. This study aim to investigate the effect of cognitive-based training on the overall cognitive function, memory, attention, executive function, and visual-spatial ability of the <b>healthy</b> older <b>people.</b> Cochrane, PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and CINAHL of selected randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and previous systematic reviews were searched for eligible studies. The population focused on this study were <b>healthy</b> older <b>people</b> who participated in randomized controlled trials that investigated the effectiveness of cognitive-based training. The outcomes including change in overall cognitive function, memory, attention, executive function, and visual-spatial ability. We collected a total of 31 RCTs, {{the results showed that}} cognitive-based training has a moderate effect on overall cognitive function (g = 0. 419; 95 %CI = 0. 205 - 0. 634) and executive function (g = 0. 420; 95 %CI = 0. 239 - 0. 602), and a small effect on the memory (g = 0. 354; 95 %CI = 0. 244 - 0. 465), attention (g = 0. 218; 95 %CI = 0. 125 - 0. 311), and visual-spatial ability (g = 0. 183; 95 %CI = 0. 015 - 0. 352) in <b>healthy</b> older <b>people.</b> Subgroup analysis indicated the intervention characteristics of ≧ 3 times each week (p = 0. 042), ≧ 8 total training weeks (p = 0. 003) and ≧ 24 total training sessions (p = 0. 040) yields a greater effect size. Cognitive-based training is effective for the <b>healthy</b> older <b>people.</b> This improvement can represent a clinically important benefit, provide information about the use of cognitive-based training in <b>healthy</b> older <b>people,</b> and help the <b>healthy</b> older <b>people</b> obtain the greatest possible benefit in health promotion and disease prevention...|$|R

5|$|Unlike most {{strains of}} influenza, H1N1 does not disproportionately infect adults older than 60years; {{this was an}} unusual and {{characteristic}} feature of the H1N1 pandemic.

This manifests itself as increased breathing difficulty and typically occurs 3–6 days after initial onset of flu symptoms. The pneumonia caused by flu can be either direct viral pneumonia or a secondary bacterial pneumonia. In fact, a November 2009 New England Journal of Medicine article recommends that flu patients whose chest X-ray indicates pneumonia receive both antivirals and antibiotics.|$|E
5|$|A vitamin is {{an organic}} {{compound}} and an essential nutrient that an organism requires in limited amounts. An organic chemical compound (or related set of compounds) {{is called a}} vitamin when the organism cannot synthesize the compound in sufficient quantities, {{and it must be}} obtained through the diet; thus, the term vitamin is conditional upon the circumstances and the particular organism. For example, ascorbic acid (one form of vitamin C) is a vitamin for humans, but not for most other animals. Vitamin D is essential only for people who do not have adequate skin exposure to sunlight, as ultraviolet light promotes synthesis in skin cells. Supplementation is important for the treatment of certain health problems, but there is little evidence of nutritional benefit when used by otherwise <b>healthy</b> <b>people.</b>|$|E

Russel Wilder, at the Mayo Clinic, built on this research and coined the term ketogenic diet to describe a diet that produced {{a high level of}} ketone bodies in the blood (ketonemia) through an excess of fat and lack of carbohydrate. Wilder hoped to obtain the benefits of fasting in a dietary therapy that could be maintained indefinitely. His trial on a few epilepsy patients in 1921 was the first use of the ketogenic diet as a treatment for epilepsy.|$|E

5|$|The Nazis used several public {{relations}} tactics {{to convince the}} general population of Germany not to smoke. Well-known health magazines like the Gesundes Volk (<b>Healthy</b> <b>People),</b> Volksgesundheit (People's Health) and Gesundes Leben (Healthy Life) published warnings about the health consequences of smoking and posters showing the harmful effects of tobacco were displayed. Anti-smoking messages were sent to the people in their workplaces, often {{with the help of the}} Hitler-Jugend (HJ) and the Bund Deutscher Mädel (BDM). The anti-smoking campaign undertaken by the Nazis also included health education. In June 1939, a Bureau against the Hazards of Alcohol and Tobacco was formed and the Reichsstelle für Rauschgiftbekämpfung (Reich Office for Drug Control) also helped in the anti-tobacco campaign. Articles advocating nonsmoking were published in the magazines Die Genussgifte (The Recreational Stimulants), Auf der Wacht (On the Guard) and Reine Luft (Clean Air). Out of these magazines, Reine Luft was the main journal of the anti-tobacco movement. Karl Astel's Institute for Tobacco Hazards Research at Jena University purchased and distributed hundreds of reprints from Reine Luft.|$|E
