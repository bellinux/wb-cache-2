40|$|By its presence, silver {{crucian carp}} or chiton (Carassius auratus gibelio Bloch.) makes {{lot of damage}} on fish-farms. By its {{nutrition}} way, the chiton competes with carp, thus reducing its growths and increasing the nutritive coefficient what is unjustified both economically and technologically. The diclinous and hermaphroditic way of procreation influences the spread of this species. After the dissection of an chiton exemplar of 10 - 12 dag in October 1995 in Našice “Ribnjak 1905 ” it was stated that it had 23 % of male fish. Spawn was in the IV. stage of sex maturity according to Kiseljević. The ways of chiton coming and going to particular pounds as well as measures to control it are analyzed in the text. It is recommended to turn full attention to the <b>filling</b> <b>and</b> <b>re-filling</b> of pounds, prevent the coming of wild fish and fill canals and pounds thoroughly...|$|E

50|$|One type of {{subsoiler}} has a torpedo-shaped tip and {{is called}} a mole plough because the tip describes a path much like the burrow that a mole creates. Mole ploughs are used to create tile drainage, with or without tiles or tile line added. A form of this implement (with a single blade), a pipe-and-cable-laying plough, is used to lay buried cables or pipes, without the need to dig a deep trench <b>and</b> <b>re-fill</b> it.|$|R
5000|$|A pipe-and-cable-laying plough or moleplough is a trenchless {{method to}} bury cables or pipes.The {{machinery}} {{is a form}} of a subsoiler with a single blade. It is used to lay buried services of virtually any description, for drainage, water, electricity, telecommunications, gas supply etc.. A coil of the service pipe/cable is mounted on the tractor and is led down a guide behind the blade, and is left buried behind the plough, without the need to dig a deep trench <b>and</b> <b>re-fill</b> it.|$|R

This scheme was widely available in shops across Scotland and led to the colloquial term for an empty: a [...] "glass cheque".

50|$|Teleport Platforms are {{a common}} {{technology}} scattered about the solar system. They are a small, blue-and-cream pad with a simple cross-shaped pattern on the pad itself, and a hologram of a large placard with a dog head-shaped rune that, curiously {{is the same as}} Jaster's Birthmark, hovering over it. Closer inspection reveals two lines of complex lettering near the top. Only platforms on the current world can be used, there is no interplanetary teleport system. They also contain special equipment that instantly heals <b>and</b> <b>re-fills</b> the AP of the party, and a memory-storage device that allows one to save the game. As the name suggests, they allow instant transport between the currently-occupied pad and whichever pad is chosen.|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} progress in electro-statically emptying, <b>and</b> <b>re-filling,</b> quantum dots with individual electrons. Typically the quantum dot {{is defined by}} electrostatic gates on a GaAs/AlGaAs modulation doped heterostructure. We report the filling of such a quantum dot by a single photo-electron, originating from an individual photon. The electrostatic dot can be emptied and reset in a controlled fashion {{before the arrival of}} each photon. The trapped photo-electron is detected by a point contact transistor integrated adjacent to the electrostatic potential trap. Each stored photo-electron causes a persistent negative step in the transistor channel current. Such a controllable, benign, single photo-electron detector could allow for information transfer between flying photon qubits and stored electron qubits. Comment: 4 Pages, 5 Figure...|$|R

50|$|Christiane and her cohorts {{are seen}} losing {{consciousness}} in decrepit lavatory cubicles amidst urine, vomit and blood, injecting in close-ups, cleaning <b>and</b> <b>re-filling</b> syringes {{directly from the}} toilet bowl, vomiting all over themselves and falling asleep {{right on top of}} it. The depiction of young addicts from seemingly normal families was particularly alarming: at the time junkies were still perceived in popular culture as much older, wilder characters, such as those depicted in Dennis Hopper's Easy Rider or in Lou Reed's songs. Christiane turns 14 halfway through the film, the same age as her friend Babsi, who fatally overdoses. Christiane's boyfriend in the film is 15, portrayed by a 14-year-old actor. None of their companions, two of whom also fatally overdose, are older than 16, as reported by end titles recalling the birth and death dates of the real-life individuals portrayed in the movie. The fact that the characters prostitute themselves to obtain drugs, both hetero- and homosexually, at such a young age, revolted audiences.|$|R
