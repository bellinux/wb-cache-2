This plea coincided with a successful coup by the Cairo-based Mamluks against the remaining symbolic Ayyubid leadership in Egypt, with strongman Qutuz officially taking power. Meanwhile, an Ayyubid army was assembled at Birzeh, just north of Damascus to defend the city against the Mongols who were now marching towards northern Syria. Aleppo was soon besieged within a week and in January 1260 it fell to the Mongols. The Great Mosque and the Citadel of Aleppo were razed and most of the inhabitants were killed or sold into slavery. The destruction of Aleppo caused panic <b>in</b> <b>Muslim</b> Syria; The Ayyubid emir of Homs, al-Ashraf Musa, offered to ally with Mongols at the approach of their army and was allowed to continue governance of the city by Hulagu. Hama also capitulated without resisting, but did not join forces with the Mongols. An-Nasir Yusuf opted to flee Damascus to seek protection in Gaza.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from being}} an {{obligatory}} religious duty, the Hajj is seen to have a spiritual merit that provides the Muslims with an opportunity of self-renewal.

After successful pilgrimage, pilgrims can prefix their names with the title 'Al-Hajji', and are held with respect <b>in</b> <b>Muslim</b> society. However, Islamic scholars suggest Hajj should signify a Muslim's religious commitment, and should not be a measurement of their social status. Hajj brings together and unites the Muslims from {{different parts of the world}} irrespective of their race, colour, and culture, which acts as a symbol of equality.|$|E

The relationship between Muslims in Denmark and the broader society was similarly at a low-point, and the conflict came to symbolise the misunderstandings between the Islamic community and the rest of society. In the years since, terrorist plots claiming to be in retaliation for the cartoons have been planned, and some executed, against targets affiliated with newspapers that published the cartoons or Denmark.|$|E
5|$|Despite this failure, Arab {{pressure}} gradually {{began to}} mount, {{especially after the}} sack of Laodicea Combusta in 770. The Byzantines were still capable of major counterstrokes and scored a few victories in the field, but in 782 the Caliphate mobilized its resources and launched a massive invasion under the Abbasid heir-apparent, Harun al-Rashid (r. 786–809), which forced the Empire into conceding a three-year truce and the payment of a heavy tribute. When warfare resumed in 785, and until {{the outbreak of the}} Abbasid civil war following Harun's death in 809, the Abbasids established and maintained a clear military supremacy, although vigorous Byzantine resistance prohibited any plans for outright conquest. Kamacha itself was surrendered to the Arabs by its Armenian garrison in 793, only to be recovered by the Byzantines in the years following Harun's death.

5|$|Following long-standing custom {{for a city}} {{taken by}} storm, the plundering of the city lasted for three days. Over seven {{thousand}} Thessalonians were taken captive to be sold in the slave markets of the Balkans and Anatolia, although many were subsequently ransomed by the Despot of Serbia, Đurađ Branković. The city's monuments suffered heavy damage in the sack, particularly the cathedral of Hagios Demetrios, as soldiers ransacked them for precious objects and hidden treasure. This damage was compounded later when the Sultan ordered that marble sections be stripped from them and taken to his capital, Adrianople, to pave a bath. On the fourth day, Sultan Murad entered the city himself and prayed at the Church of the Acheiropoietos, which became the city's first mosque. The Sultan then restored order and took measures to revive the city, evicting the soldiers from the homes they had occupied and returning them to their owners. According to Anagnostes, 7,000 inhabitants, including himself, were taken captive to be sold as slaves; only 2,000 {{of the population was}} left after the sack, many of which soon converted to Islam. The Sultan soon took measures to repopulate the city. He promised to return their properties to those inhabitants who had fled if they returned, and in some cases even ransomed captives from the sack himself. He also brought <b>in</b> <b>Muslim</b> and Christian settlers from other areas of Macedonia. A great number of empty houses were confiscated and given to the settlers, while most of the main churches were converted to mosques.

5|$|The battle {{began on}} 15 August 636. At dawn both armies {{lined up for}} battle {{less than a mile}} apart.

The battle began as the Byzantine army sent its champions to duel with the Muslim mubarizun. The mubarizun were specially trained swordsmen and lancers, with the objective to slay as many enemy commanders as possible to damage their morale. At midday, after losing a number of commanders in the duels, Vahan ordered a limited attack with a third of his infantry forces to test the strength and strategy of the Muslim army and, using their overwhelming numerical and weaponry superiority, achieve a breakthrough wherever the Muslim battle line was weak. However the Byzantine assault lacked determination; many soldiers of the Imperial Army were unable to press the attack against the Muslim veterans. The fighting was generally moderate, although in some places it was especially intense. Vahan did not reinforce his forward infantry two-thirds of which was kept in reserve with one-third deployed to engage the Muslims, and at sunset both armies broke contact and returned to their respective camps.|$|E

40|$|Background Depression {{presents}} differently <b>in</b> <b>Muslims</b> (Sami & El-Gawad, 1995). Religious {{coping and}} experiential avoidance (EA) are ways {{of coping with}} depression in many populations and religions but how these manifest or interact <b>in</b> <b>Muslims</b> is unknown. The way individuals cope with stressors {{may lead to the}} development of depression (Beck, 1987 b). Positive religious coping (PRC) and acceptance are adaptive forms of coping and correlate with better quality of life (Gardner, Krägeloh and Henning, 2014). Negative religious coping (NRC) and EA are maladaptive forms of coping correlating with depression (Hayes et al., 2004; Pargament Feuille & Burdzy, 2011). Islam fosters acceptance and positive action. An a priori prediction is that well-adjusted, practicing <b>Muslims</b> will engage <b>in</b> PRC and acceptance, whilst those engaging in NRC and EA will display more depressive symptoms. Aims To investigate whether religious coping and EA are implicated in the development of depression <b>in</b> <b>Muslims.</b> To date no study has addressed both constructs together <b>in</b> a <b>Muslim</b> sample. The study aimed to fill this gap and further the understanding of depression <b>in</b> <b>Muslims.</b> Doctoral Thesis: An investigation into whether Dina Bedair experiential avoidance acts as a mediator in the relationship between religious coping and depression <b>in</b> an adult <b>Muslim</b> population iii Method Participants were recruited from a community sample of Arabic-speaking <b>Muslims</b> <b>in</b> the United Kingdom. Data were collected with an Arabic questionnaire pack including EA, religious coping and depression measures. Analysis A cross-sectional, correlation and mediation design was adopted to test the hypotheses. Results NRC moderately, positively correlated with depression. EA strongly positively correlated with depression. PRC was not related to depression. EA mediated the relationship between NRC and depression. Conclusion EA could be a clinical target for depressed Muslims, e. g. using existing therapies like acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT; Hayes & Wilson 1994) or by incorporating Islamic concepts into other therapies like CBT to reduce NRC and increase acceptance. There is a need to develop standardised Arabic measures for use with this population...|$|R
