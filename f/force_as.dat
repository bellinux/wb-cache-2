In addition to the casualties inflicted upon them by North Vietnamese artillery, the civilians were also hit by air strikes from the Republic of Vietnam Air <b>Force.</b> <b>As</b> a result of those huge losses, Route 7 became known as the ‘convoy of tears’.|$|E

5|$|For TypeII supernovae, the {{collapse}} is eventually halted by short-range repulsive neutron-neutron interactions, {{mediated by the}} strong <b>force,</b> <b>as</b> well as by degeneracy pressure of neutrons, at a density {{comparable to that of}} an atomic nucleus. When {{the collapse}} stops, the infalling matter rebounds, producing a shock wave that propagates outward. The energy from this shock dissociates heavy elements within the core. This reduces the energy of the shock, which can stall the explosion within the outer core.|$|E
