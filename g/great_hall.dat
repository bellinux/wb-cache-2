5|$|Inside {{the inner}} ward was the castle's <b>Great</b> <b>Hall</b> and accommodation. Caerphilly was built with fashionable, high-status accommodation, {{similar to that}} built {{around the same time}} in Chepstow Castle. In the medieval period the <b>Great</b> <b>Hall</b> would have been {{subdivided}} with wooden screens, colourful decorations, with rich, detailed carving and warmed by a large, central fireplace. Some carved medieval corbels in the shape of male and female heads survive in the hall today, possibly depicting the royal court in the 1320s, including Edward II, Isabella of France, Hugh Despenser and Eleanor de Clare. To the east of the <b>Great</b> <b>Hall</b> was the castle chapel, positioned above the buttery and pantry. On {{the west side of the}} hall were the castle's private apartments, two solar blocks with luxurious fittings.|$|E
5|$|Jackson and Zach Wamp were spokespersons for the {{changing}} {{the name of}} the main hall of the United States Capitol Visitor Center from the <b>Great</b> <b>Hall</b> to Emancipation Hall.

5|$|Nettlecombe Court is an Elizabethan country mansion, in {{addition}} to earlier-built structures including a late Medieval hall, entrance front, porch, a <b>great</b> <b>hall,</b> and church. A Tudor parlour was added in 1599.

5|$|British Railways {{announced}} a complete rebuild of Euston that could accommodate a fully electrified West Coast Main Line in 1959. Because of the restricted layout of track and tunnels {{at the northern}} end, enlargement could be accomplished only by expanding southwards over the area occupied by the <b>Great</b> <b>Hall</b> and the Arch. Consequently, the London County Council were given notice that the Arch and the <b>Great</b> <b>Hall</b> would be demolished, which was granted on the proviso that the Arch would be restored and re-sited. This was financially unviable as BR estimated it would cost at least £190,000 (now £).|$|E

5|$|Opposite the entrance, {{and running}} across {{the middle of the}} court, was the <b>great</b> <b>hall</b> of the castle, with a grand porch and steps leading up to the first floor, where prestigious guests would have been entertained amongst carved wall-panels and murals. The design of the hall may have {{emulated}} Gaunt's hall at Kenilworth; at the very least, it was a powerful symbol of Thomas's authority and status. The west side of the inner court included the castle kitchen, bakery, well and other service facilities; on the east side was the lord's great chamber and a range of other accommodation for other guests. Behind the <b>great</b> <b>hall</b> was a smaller courtyard or garden. Thomas appears to have built up his new castle in stages, with the curtain wall being built first, with the corner towers added afterwards.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Great</b> <b>Hall</b> is {{furnished}} with mostly 17th century oak furniture, including tables, coffers and wainscot chairs, {{and a great}} dining table, on which stand two blue and white late 17th century Delftware pyramidal tulip vases. One treasure of the home is the Lytes Herbal, a 16th-century botanical volume by noted horticulturist Henry Lyte, who was born and resided at the manor. Lyte's Niewe Herball was published in 1578 and was a translation and elaboration of the Cruydeboeck of Flemish herbalist Rembert Dodoens. The herbal was dedicated to Queen Elizabeth. A copy is displayed in the <b>Great</b> <b>Hall.</b>|$|E

5|$|The <b>Great</b> <b>Hall,</b> {{leading off}} from the corridor, was the most {{important}} communal eating and living room, but by the time Montacute was completed the traditional <b>Great</b> <b>Hall</b> was largely an anachronism. Such halls continued to be built, however, albeit as at Montacute on a smaller scale. For the first few years after its completion, the servants continued to dine in the hall, but the family and honoured guests now ate in the Great Chamber above. The hall now served as a room to receive and also for processions to commence to the grander rooms above.|$|E
5|$|The {{center of}} the {{building}} is occupied by the , 150 seat <b>Great</b> <b>Hall,</b> where the National Assembly convenes. Formerly rectangular, it was renovated into an amphitheater in 2000. Each seat has a microphone, an automatic voting system, plug socket {{and access to the}} National Assembly's computer network. The chair facing the doors to the hall is for the President of the National Assembly. Behind it, a bronze relief of the coat of arms of Slovenia is positioned on the marble wall. The sculptor Marko Pogačnik created the work in 1991 to celebrate independence. There is also a 106-seat gallery for the public and guests to view the <b>Great</b> <b>Hall.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Great</b> <b>Hall's</b> lively {{acoustics}} {{are primarily}} based on Hansen's intuition, {{as he could}} not rely on any studies on architectural acoustics. The room's rectangular shape and proportions, its boxes and sculptures allow early and numerous sound reflections.|$|R

To the south {{of these is the}} library. Behind the <b>great</b> <b>hall</b> is the main staircase. The circular tower at the north-west corner contains the octagonal dining room with a Minton tile floor, two fireplaces, and a vault of eight radial ribs running to a central boss. The room contains an oak sideboard with a carved Green Man. Below the dining room is a wine cellar. On the fifth floor of the circular tower is a room designed for playing rackets, which is approached by a stone spiral staircase.|$|E
5|$|The square Little Stair Tower was the {{entrance}} from the bailey to the withdrawing rooms {{south of the}} <b>great</b> <b>hall.</b> At ground floor level there was a doorway {{in each of the}} tower's faces. Directly south of {{the east side of the}} tower was the castle's chapel. The northern door led to the <b>great</b> <b>hall,</b> and the western door to a cellar under the great chamber. There are only fragmentary remains of the spiral staircase. Above the passageway was a single room, of uncertain purpose: it may have been used as another chapel, a guest room, or an antechamber where guests would wait before being admitted into the earl's presence.|$|E
