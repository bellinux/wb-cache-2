25|$|For {{the first}} two {{unmanned}} launches, eight solid-fuel ullage motors ignited for four seconds to give positive acceleration to the S-II stage, followed by start of the five J-2 engines. For the first seven manned Apollo missions only four ullage motors were used on the S-II, and they were eliminated completely for the final four launches. About 30 seconds after first stage separation, the <b>interstage</b> ring dropped from the second stage. This was done with an inertially fixed attitude so that the <b>interstage,</b> only 1 meter from the outboard J-2 engines, would fall cleanly without contacting them.

25|$|A {{balanced}} regulator {{first stage}} automatically keeps a constant pressure {{difference between the}} <b>interstage</b> pressure and the ambient pressure even as the tank pressure drops with consumption. The balanced regulator design allows the first stage orifice to be as large as needed without incurring performance degradation {{as a result of}} changing tank pressure.|$|E
25|$|Various minor {{accessories}} {{are available}} to fit these hose connectors. These include <b>interstage</b> pressure gauges, which are used to troubleshoot and tune the regulator (not for use underwater), noisemakers, used to attract attention underwater and on the surface, and valves for inflating tires and inflatable boat floats, making the air in a scuba cylinder available for other purposes.|$|E
25|$|This {{does not}} mean that all the {{remaining}} gas is unobtainable from a cylinder; rather that the regulator will deliver some of it less efficiently than the designed work of breathing, and the rest only when the ambient pressure is reduced. In most regulator designs the diver will have to overcome a larger cracking pressure to open the demand valve, and flow rate will be reduced. These effects increase as the <b>interstage</b> pressure decreases. This can provide the diver with a warning that gas supply from that cylinder will immanently cease. However, in at least one regulator design, once the <b>interstage</b> pressure has been sufficiently reduced, the inflatable second stage servo-valve will deflate and effectively lock open the demand valve, allowing the residual gas to escape until the cylinder pressure has dropped to approximately equal the ambient pressure, at which point flow will stop until the ambient pressure is reduced by ascending to shallower depth.|$|E

Building 945 held 30 missiles, while Building 942 held 11 plus a single stage 1. The buildings also held extra stage engines and the <b>interstages.</b> 14 full missiles and one extra second stage had been transferred from Norton Air Force Base to the manufacturer, Martin Marietta, at Martin's Denver, Colorado, facility for refurbishment {{by the end of}} the decade. 13 of the 14 were launched as 23Gs. One missile, B-108, AF Ser. No. 66-4319 (23G-10 the spare for the 23G program), went to the Evergreen Aviation & Space Museum in McMinnville, Oregon. Finally, B-34 Stage 2 was delivered from Norton Air Force Base to Martin Marietta on 28 April 1986, but was not modified to a G, nor was it listed as arriving or being destroyed at the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, it is therefore unaccounted for within the open source public domain. Forty-two B-series missiles remained, 41 full and one first stage at Norton Air Force Base, and the second stage at Martin. Of these 38 and one second stage were stored outside at the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center (AMARC), now known as the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (309 AMARG), adjacent to Davis-Monthan Air Force Base to await final destruction between 2004 and 2008.

40|$|Composite {{materials}} {{are increasingly being}} considered and used for launch-vehicle structures. For shell structures, such as <b>interstages,</b> skirts, and shrouds, honeycomb-core sandwich composites are often selected for their structural efficiency. Therefore, {{it is becoming increasingly}} important to understand the structural response, including buckling, of sandwich composite shell structures. Additionally, small geometric imperfections can significantly influence the buckling response, including considerably reducing the buckling load, of shell structures. Thus, both the response of the theoretically perfect structure and the buckling imperfection sensitivity must be considered during the design of such structures. To address the latter, empirically derived design factors, called buckling knockdown factors (KDFs), were developed by NASA in the 1960 s to account for this buckling imperfection sensitivity during design. However, most of the test-article designs used in the development of these recommendations are not relevant to modern launch-vehicle constructions and material systems, and in particular, no composite test articles were considered. Herein, a two-part study on composite sandwich shells to (1) examine the relationship between the buckling knockdown factor and the areal mass of optimized designs, and (2) to interrogate the imperfection sensitivity of those optimized designs is presented. Four structures from recent NASA launch-vehicle development activities are considered. First, designs optimized for both strength and stability were generated for each of these structures using design optimization software and a range of buckling knockdown factors; {{it was found that the}} designed areal masses varied by between 6. 1 % and 19. 6 % over knockdown factors ranging from 0. 6 to 0. 9. Next, the buckling imperfection sensitivity of the optimized designs is explored using nonlinear finite-element analysis and the as-measured shape of a large-scale composite cylindrical shell. When compared with the current buckling design recommendations, the results suggest that the current recommendations are overly conservative and that the development of new recommendations could reduce the acreage areal mass of many composite sandwich shell designs by between 4 % and 19 %, depending on the structure...|$|R

Osim očitih razlika, u odnosu prema starijim keramičkim proizvodima kasne antike kao i onima iz mlađe faze naseljavanja tog prostora, u prilogu su prikazani i rezultati apsolutnih datacija toga najstarijeg horizonta. In {{the period}} from 1999 to 2008, as part of {{motorway}} construction works, comprehensive archaeological excavations were conducted {{in the part of}} the Prekmurje region between the banks of the Mura River and the town of Murska Sobota. Numerous remains were unearthed that can be associated with the first Slavic settlement {{in the area of the}} Eastern Alps and Northern Adriatic. In Nova Tabla, 189 residential structures from the early Middle Ages were examined. The settlement also contained a group of 11 skeleton graves, unearthed on the south-western margin of Roman tumuli with incineration graves. On the basis of typology and comparison with other related sites, and with the help of numerous radiocarbon dating tests, the Nova Tabla settlement has been divided into two larger cultural and time horizons: Murska Sobota 1 and 2, with <b>interstages</b> of development encompassing {{the period from}} the 6 th until the beginning of the 9 th century. The inventory of pit SO 11 with a fragment of a simply made small jug with a loosely curved mouth can be classified as belonging to the oldest early Slavic settlement remains in Nova Tabla. The reconstructed small pot (Fig. 3) with its slender shaped body, indefinitely shaped mouth, hand-made with a porous undecorated surface, is a good representative of Prague Culture pottery (cf. M. KUNA et al., 2005, 347) and has the recognisable workmanship characteristic of the earthenware of the first Slavic horizon of Murska Sobota 1. Apart from the light non-oxidised burning, the uneven, porous surface of the entire vessel is also typical of this facture. In the Slovenian archaeological context, a porous surface on ceramic vessels and carved, wave-shaped decorative lines are typical of early mediaeval Slavic pottery. Generally, the porosity of the surface is associated with admixtures of plant origin, usually with grains of wheat, which usually get completely burned in the process of baking (G. FUSEK, 1994, 16; M. KUNA et al., 2005, 339). One of the possible ways of achieving a porous surface was adding crushed coal. This method is hard to prove but was successfully carried out as part of an experiment in making Slavic pottery (M. GUŠTIN, 2005, 37; I. BAHOR, 2010). The newcomers’ distinctive pottery with its porous surface remained the only type of pottery over a short period of time. Soon after its appearance, in the first half of the seventh century, the first shaping and technological developments in early Slavic pottery from Nova Tabla and other sites had started...|$|R

40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this study is}} to examine the impact of new trends in {{satellite}} launch activities on the orbital debris environment and collision risk. Starting from the launch of the first artificial satellite in 1957, space borne technology has become an indispensable part of our lives. More than 6, 000 satellites have been launched into Earth orbit. Though the annual number of satellites launched stayed flat for many decades, the trend has recently changed. The satellite market has been undergoing a major evolution with new space companies replacing the traditional approach of deploying a few large, complex and costly satellites with an approach to use a multitude of smaller, less complex and cheaper satellites. This new approach creates a sharp increase in the number of satellites and so the historic trends are no longer representative. As a foundation for this study, a scenario for satellite deployments based on the publicly announced future satellite missions has been developed. These constellation-deploying companies include, but are not limited to, Blacksky, CICERO, EROS, Landmapper, Leosat, Northstar, O 3 b, OmniEarth, OneWeb, Orbcomm, OuterNet, PlanetIQ, Planet Labs, Radarsat, RapidEye Next Generation, Sentinel, Skybox, SpaceX, and Spire. Information such as the annual number of launches, the number of orbital planes to be used by the constellation, as well as apogee, perigee, inclination, spacecraft mass and area were included or approximated. Besides the production of satellites, a widespread ongoing effort to enhance orbital injection capabilities will allow delivery of more spacecraft more accurately into Earth orbits. A long list of companies such as Microcosm, Rocket Lab, Firefly Space Systems, Sierra Nevada Corporation and Arca Space Corporation are developing new launch vehicles dedicated for small satellites. There are other projects which intend to develop <b>interstages</b> with propulsive capabilities which will allow the deployment of satellites into their desired orbits beyond the restrictions of the launch vehicle used. These near future orbital injection technologies are also covered in the developed scenario. Using the above-mentioned background information, this study aims to examine how the orbital debris environment will be affected from the new dynamics of the emerging space markets. We developed a simulation tool that is capable of propagating the objects in a given deployment scenario with variable-sized time-steps as small as one second. Over the course of the run, the software also detects collisions; additional debris objects are then created according to the NASA breakup model and are fed back into the simulation framework. Examining the simulation results, the total number of particles to accumulate in different orbits can be monitored and the number of conjunctions can be tracked to assess the collision risks. The simulation makes it possible to follow the short- and long-term effects of a particular satellite or constellation on the space environment. Likewise, the effects of changes in the debris environment on a particular satellite or constellation can be evaluated. It is authors hope that the results of this paper and further utilization of the developed simulation tool will assist in the investigation of more accurate deorbiting metrics to replace the generic 25 -year disposal guidelines, as well as to guide future launches toward more sustainable and safe orbits...|$|R
25|$|A {{value of}} 10 bar <b>interstage</b> {{pressure}} plus ambient pressure is a suitable estimate for minimum functional pressure for most planning purposes. This value will {{vary with the}} depth, and a regulator that has stopped delivering breathing gas may deliver a little more gas as the ambient pressure decreases, allowing a few more breaths from the cylinder during ascent if the gas is used up during the dive.

Being lucky in misfortune, JCSAT-11 was simply an on-orbit backup and thus it had no operational impact on the fleet. The same day of the launch failure, JSAT placed an order with Lockheed for an identical replacement, JCSAT-12, for launch in 2009.|$|E
25|$|The <b>interstage,</b> which {{connects the}} upper and lower stage for Falcon 9, is a carbon fiber {{aluminum}} core composite structure.

SpaceX uses an all-friction stir welded tank, a technique which minimizes manufacturing defects and reduces cost, according to a NASA spokesperson. The second-stage tank of Falcon9 is simply a shorter version of the first-stage tank and uses most of the same tooling, material and manufacturing techniques. This saves money during vehicle production.|$|E
25|$|The {{arrays of}} {{airfoils}} {{are set in}} rows, usually as pairs: one rotating and one stationary. The rotating airfoils, also known as blades or rotors, accelerate the fluid. The stationary airfoils, also known as stators or vanes, decelerate and redirect the flow direction of the fluid, preparing it for the rotor blades of the next stage. Axial compressors are almost always multi-staged, with the cross-sectional area of the gas passage diminishing along the compressor to maintain an optimum axial Mach number. Beyond about 5 stages or a 4:1 design pressure ratio a compressor will not function unless fitted with features such as stationary vanes with variable angles (known as {{variable inlet guide vanes}} and variable stators), the ability to allow some air to escape part-way along the compressor (known as <b>interstage</b> bleed) and being split into more than one rotating assembly (known as twin spools, for example).|$|E
25|$|Intermediate {{pressure}} creep: This {{is a slow}} leak of {{the first}} stage valve. The effect is for the <b>interstage</b> pressure to rise until either the next breath is drawn, or the pressure exerts more force on the second stage valve than can be resisted by the spring, and the valve opens briefly, often with a popping sound, to relieve the pressure. {{the frequency of the}} popping pressure relief depends on the flow in the second stage, the back pressure, the second stage spring tension and the magnitude of the leak. It may range from occasional loud pops to a constant hiss. Underwater the second stage may be damped by the water and the loud pops may become an intermittent or constant stream of bubbles. This is not usually a catastrophic failure mode, but should be fixed as it will get worse, and it wastes gas.|$|E
25|$|Leakage is {{equivalent}} to a resistor in parallel with the capacitor. Constant exposure to heat can cause dielectric breakdown and excessive leakage, a problem often seen in older vacuum tube circuits, particularly where oiled paper and foil capacitors were used. In many vacuum tube circuits, <b>interstage</b> coupling capacitors are used to conduct a varying signal from the plate of one tube to the grid circuit of the next stage. A leaky capacitor can cause the grid circuit voltage to be raised from its normal bias setting, causing excessive current or signal distortion in the downstream tube. In power amplifiers this can cause the plates to glow red, or current limiting resistors to overheat, even fail. Similar considerations apply to component fabricated solid-state (transistor) amplifiers, but owing to lower heat production {{and the use of}} modern polyester dielectric barriers this once-common problem has become relatively rare.|$|E
25|$|Bailout supply {{pressure}} options: If the <b>interstage</b> pressure for the bailout regulator {{is lower than}} the main {{supply pressure}}, the main supply will override the bailout gas, and continue to flow. This can be a problem if the diver switches to bailout because main supply is contaminated. If on the other hand, bailout pressure is higher than main supply pressure, the bailout gas will override the main gas supply if the valve is opened. This will result in the bailout gas being used up if the valve leaks. The diver should periodically check that bailout pressure is still sufficient {{for the rest of the}} dive, and abort the dive if it is not. For this reason the bailout regulator must be fitted with a submersible pressure gauge to which the diver can refer to check the pressure. This is usually clipped off or tucked into the harness on the left side, where it can be easily reached to read, but is unlikely to snag on anything.|$|E
25|$|United Launch Alliance applies FSW to the Delta II, Delta IV, and Atlas V {{expendable}} launch vehicles, and {{the first}} of these with a friction stir welded <b>Interstage</b> module was launched in 1999. The process is also used for the Space Shuttle external tank, for Ares I and for the Orion Crew Vehicle test article at NASA as well as Falcon 1 and Falcon 9 rockets at SpaceX. The toe nails for ramp of Boeing C-17 Globemaster III cargo aircraft by Advanced Joining Technologies and the cargo barrier beams for the Boeing 747 Large Cargo Freighter were the first commercially produced aircraft parts. FAA approved wings and fuselage panels of the Eclipse 500 aircraft were made at Eclipse Aviation, and this company delivered 259 friction stir welded business jets, before they were forced into Chapter 7 liquidation. Floor panels for Airbus A400M military aircraft are now made by Pfalz Flugzeugwerke and Embraer used FSW for the Legacy 450 and 500 Jets Friction stir welding also is employed for fuselage panels on the Airbus A380. BRÖTJE-Automation uses friction stir welding for gantry production machines developed for the aerospace sector as well as other industrial applications.|$|E
25|$|If a {{regulator}} stage has {{an architecture}} that compensates {{for a change}} of upstream pressure on the moving parts of the valve so that a change in supply pressure does not affect the force required to open the valve, the stage is described as balanced. Upstream and downstream valves, first and second stages, and diaphragm and piston operation can be balanced or unbalanced, and a full description of a stage will specify which of all of these options apply. For example a regulator may have a balanced piston first stage with a balanced downstream second stage. Both balanced and unbalanced piston first stages are fairly common, but most diaphragm first stages are balanced. Balancing the first stage has a greater overall affect on thr performance of a regulator, as the variation in supply pressure from the cylinder is much greater than the variation in <b>interstage</b> pressure, even with an unbalanced first stage. However the second stage operates on very a small pressure differential and is more sensitive to variations in supply pressure. Most top range regulators have at least one balanced stage, {{but it is not clear}} that balancing both stages makes a noticeable difference to performance.|$|E
25|$|The bailout {{block is}} a small {{manifold}} fitted either to the harness where {{it is in a}} convenient but protected position, commonly on the right side on the waist strap, or on the helmet, also usually {{on the right side of}} the temple, with the valve knob to the side to distinguish it from the free-flow or defogging valve which is commonly to the front. The bailout block has a connection for the main gas supply from the umbilical through a non-return valve. This route can not be closed and supplies the helmet demand valve and free flow valve under normal circumstances. The bailout gas from the back mounted cylinder passes through a conventional scuba first stage at the cylinder valve, to the bailout block, where it is normally isolated by the bailout valve. When the diver needs to switch over to bailout gas he simply opens the bailout valve and the gas is supplied to the helmet or mask. As the valve is normally closed, a leak in the first stage regulator seat will cause the <b>interstage</b> pressure to rise, and unless an overpressure relief valve is fitted to the first stage the hose may burst. Aftermarket overpressure valves are available which can be fitted into a standard low-pressure port of most first stages.|$|E
25|$|Attached to the {{cylindrical}} ballistic {{case was}} a natural-uranium liner, the radiation case. The SHRIMP design used an approximately 2.5cm thick uranium radiation case. Its internal surface was lined with ~240 μm thick copper liner made from 0.08 μm thick copper foil, due to copper possessing excellent reflecting properties, increasing the overall albedo of the hohlraum. Hohlraum albedo {{is a very important}} design parameter for any inertial-confinement configuration. A relatively high albedo permits higher <b>interstage</b> coupling due to the more favorable azimuthal and latitudinal angles of reflected radiation. The limiting value of the albedo for high-Z materials is reached when the thickness is 5–10 g/cm, or 0.5–1.0 free paths. Thus, a hohlraum made of uranium much thicker than a free path of uranium would be disadvantageous in terms of bomb weight and use of raw materials. At the same time the angular anisotropy increases as the atomic number of the scatterer material is reduced. Thus the use of copper, or in other devices of gold or aluminium, as hohlraum liners is imperative as the greater the value of Z of the scatterer the greater this absorption probability will be. There are 2 sources of X-rays in the hohlraum; primary's irradiance which is dominant at the beginning and during the pulse rise and the wall which is important during the required radiation temperature's (T) plateau. The primary emits radiation {{in a manner similar to}} a flash bulb, and the secondary needs constant T to properly implode. This constant wall temperature is dictated by the ablation pressure requirements to drive compression which lay on average at about 0.4 keV (out of a range of 0.2 to 2 keV) corresponding to several thousand kelvins. Wall temperature depended on the temperature of the primary's core which peaked at about 5.4 keV during boosted-fission. The final wall-temperature, which corresponds to energy of the wall-reradiated X-rays to the secondary's pusher, also drops due to losses from the hohlraum material itself. Natural uranium nails, lined to the top of their head with copper, attached the radiation case to the ballistic case. The nails were bolted in vertical arrays in a double-shear configuration to better distribute the shear loads. This method of attaching the radiation case to the ballistic case was first used successfully in the Ivy Mike device. The radiation case had a parabolic end, which housed the COBRA primary that was employed to create the conditions needed to start the fusion reaction, and its other end was a cylinder, as also seen in Bravo's declassified film.|$|E

Once the remaining RS-25Ds are used up, they are to be replaced with a cheaper, expendable version, currently designated the RS-25E. This engine may be based on one or both of two single-use variants which were studied in 2005, the RS-25E (referred to as the 'Minimal Change Expendable SSME') and the even more simplified RS-25F (referred to as the 'Low Cost Manufacture Expendable SSME'), both of which were under consideration in 2011.|$|E
2500|$|There is {{very little}} {{information}} in the open literature about the mechanism of the <b>interstage.</b> Its first mention in a U.S. government document formally {{released to the public}} appears to be a caption in a recent graphic promoting the Reliable Replacement Warhead Program. If built, this new design would replace [...] "toxic, brittle material" [...] and [...] "expensive 'special' material" [...] in the <b>interstage.</b> This statement suggests the <b>interstage</b> may contain beryllium to moderate the flux of neutrons from the primary, and perhaps something to absorb and re-radiate the x-rays in a particular manner. There is also some speculation that this <b>interstage</b> material, which may be code-named FOGBANK, might be an aerogel, possibly doped with beryllium and/or other substances.|$|E
