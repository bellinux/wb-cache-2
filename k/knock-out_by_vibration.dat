40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to investigate the correlation between vibration analysis and fault diagnosis. This was achieved <b>by</b> <b>vibration</b> analysis of an electro-pump of marine ship. The vibration analysis was initially run under regular interval during electro-pump life. Some series of tests were then conducted under the operating hours of stone crasher. Vibration data was regularly collected. The overall <b>vibration</b> data produced <b>by</b> <b>vibration</b> analysis was compared with previous data, in order to quantify the effectiveness of the results of vibration condition monitoring technique. Numerical data produced <b>by</b> <b>vibration</b> analysis were compared with vibration spectra in standard condition of healthy machine, in order to quantify the effectiveness of the vibration condition monitoring technique. The results of this paper have given more understanding on the dependent roles of vibration analysis in predicting and diagnosing machine faults...|$|R

5000|$|Fretting {{refers to}} wear and {{sometimes}} corrosion damage at the asperities of contact surfaces. This damage is induced under load {{and in the}} presence of repeated relative surface motion, as induced for example <b>by</b> <b>vibration.</b> The ASM Handbook on Fatigue and Fracture defines fretting as: [...] "A special wear process that occurs at the contact area between two materials under load and subject to minute relative motion <b>by</b> <b>vibration</b> or some other force." [...] Fretting tangibly downgrades the surface layer quality producing increased surface roughness and micropits; which reduces the fatigue strength of the components.|$|R

40|$|A further attempt {{has been}} made to define the {{receptor}} responsible for the inhibition of monosynaptic reflexes <b>by</b> <b>vibration</b> in man. Vibration of the tendo Achillis will produce inhibition of the H reflex even when the muscles of the anterior compartment of the leg are denervated or blocked with local anaesthetic, implying that there are receptors in the posterior compartment capable of producing this effect. However, there is evidence that vibration spreads through the limb. The inhibition is greater when the anterior compartment is innervated indicating that there is a contribution from receptors in this compartment. Stretching the muscles of the posterior compartment alone, or the muscles of the anterior and posterior compartments reciprocally does not influence the inhibition of the monosynaptic reflex <b>by</b> <b>vibration.</b> These observations support the contention that the reduction of the monosynaptic reflex <b>by</b> <b>vibration</b> in man is due to presynaptic inhibition resulting from activation of primary spindle endings...|$|R
