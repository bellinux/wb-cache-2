5|$|Commentators <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> {{the game}} {{was an attempt to}} {{capitalize}} on then-recent, extensive news coverage of the Gulf War, which had focused on the use of advanced, impersonal weapons (such as aircraft and guided missiles) to destroy enemy weapons and installations. Some commentators considered the game's subject matter in bad taste, with one magazine reporting an incident of veterans burning copies of the game.|$|E

One is too much taken up with what one sees and hears in Paris, however firm one may be, and what I am painting here has at least the merit of not resembling anyone...because it will be simply the expression of what I shall <b>have</b> <b>felt,</b> I myself, personally.|$|E
5|$|Grace may <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> {{pleased that}} he had got his man {{but he did not}} get his expenses, for Surrey refused to pay them.

5|$|Lobengula {{refused to}} allow any of the izinDuna to sign the document. Exactly why he did this is not clear. Rudd's {{interpretation}} was that the king considered them to have already been consulted at the day's indaba, and so {{did not think it}} necessary for them to also sign. Keppel-Jones comments that Lobengula might <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> that it would be harder to repudiate the document later if it bore the marks of his izinDuna alongside his own.|$|E
5|$|Much of Alvarado's trial {{focused on}} whether Alvarado was in custody or not during his police interview. According to Thompson v. Keohane, to {{determine}} whether someone is in custody the courts apply a reasonable person test: whether a reasonable person would <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> free to leave or not.|$|E
5|$|Olga Rudge, {{pregnant}} with Pound's child, followed them to Italy. She had {{little interest in}} raising a child, but may <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> that having one would maintain her connection to him. In July 1925 she gave birth to their daughter, Mary. Olga placed the child with a German-speaking peasant woman whose own child had died, and who agreed to raise Mary for 200 lire a month.|$|E
30|$|The affective {{component}} of happiness is measured {{on the basis}} of responses to a series of questions as to how the respondent <b>had</b> <b>felt</b> the day before the questionnaire was administrated. This measure was used in the Gallup World Polls (Gallup, [2009]). Typical questions are whether one <b>had</b> <b>felt</b> ‘depressed’, ‘stressed’ or <b>had</b> <b>felt</b> ‘well rested’ and ‘smiled a lot’ yesterday. Respondents could answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’. We computed an affect balance score per nation, subtracting the percentage of reported negative feelings from the percentage of positive feelings. The variable name in the data file States of Nations is HappinessYesterdayABS_ 2006.08.|$|R

5|$|Overall {{identified}} {{a number of}} reasons why residents opposed self-government. Along with the previously mentioned fear of increases in taxation or decreases in services, he argued that those living in the ACT would <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> that they already had a voice in the governance of the territory, through federal electoral representation. Canberra also had a high proportion of public servants who felt that they were already a part of the government, and knew how to work with the system.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the matches}} were changed {{after they were}} first announced, as several wrestlers left the WWF shortly before the event. Critics have praised the main event and the tag team match that was won by Savage and Perfect. Although the {{remaining}} bouts have received low ratings, critics <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> that those two matches made the event worth watching.|$|E
5|$|Alright, {{the main}} titles. Why the change? As you'll see here, the {{previous}} titles {{were such a}} high school aesthetic. It would <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> silly {{for me to go}} back to college with the same sort of look—the notebook paper. So it felt like we needed to change for college anyway. And in season one when we first did the titles, the network was very clear on wanting to sell it as a high school show rather than a noir show. But once we went to college and had a chance to redo the titles I wanted it to feel noir. For the new theme song, Thomas asked The Dandy Warhols to commission a remix of their original track, which Thomas reported enjoying upon first listening.|$|E

5|$|Campbell was unapologetic. He {{said that}} he {{considered}} it his duty as president to attend the game. Montreal mayor Jean Drapeau was livid at Campbell for attending, and he laid {{the blame for the}} riot on Campbell. A Montreal city councilor wanted Campbell arrested for inciting the riot. Years later, Canadiens player Jean Béliveau stated that, although he disagreed with Campbell's decision to attend the game, as well as feeling Campbell might have been using his appearance to make a statement, he concluded that Campbell may <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> that if he did not attend he could appear to be hiding. He also noted that Campbell's absence might not have made much of a difference.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many of his}} contemporaries, he {{does not}} seem to <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> that his admiration for the pre-Islamic Iranian civilization {{conflicted}} with his Muslim Shiite faith. According to some accounts, he repaired the Imam Husayn Shrine in Karbala, and built a mausoleum of Ali in Najaf, which is today known as the Imam Ali Mosque. He {{is said to have been}} generous to a prominent Shiite theologian, but did not follow a Shiite religious policy and was tolerant to the Sunnis. He even tried to get closer to the Sunnis by giving his daughter in marriage to the caliph, which was a failure because the caliph refused to consummate the marriage.|$|E
5|$|Others {{expressed}} a broader analysis, framing Lépine's actions {{as the result}} of societal changes that had led to increased poverty, powerlessness, individual isolation, and polarization between men and women. Noting Lépine's interest in violent action films, some suggested that violence in the media and in society may have influenced his actions. Following a shooting at Dawson College on September 13, 2006, Globe and Mail columnist Jan Wong controversially suggested that Marc Lépine may <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> alienated from Quebec society as he was the child of an immigrant.|$|E

5|$|Poverty {{may have}} pushed Sien back into prostitution; the home became less happy and Van Gogh may <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> family life was irreconcilable with his artistic development. Sien gave her {{daughter}} to her mother, and baby Willem to her brother. Willem remembered visiting Rotterdam {{when he was about}} 12, when an uncle tried to persuade Sien to marry to legitimise the child. He believed Van Gogh was his father, but the timing of his birth makes this unlikely. Sien drowned herself in the River Scheldt in 1904.|$|E
5|$|Shelby {{had hoped}} {{to be given the}} {{contract}} to produce the Tiger in America, but Rootes was somewhat uneasy about the closeness of his relationship with Ford, so it was decided to build the car in England. The Rootes factory at Ryton did not have the capacity to build the Tiger, so the company contracted the job to Jensen in West Bromwich. Any disappointment Shelby may <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> was tempered by an offer from Rootes to pay him an undisclosed royalty on every Tiger built.|$|E
5|$|The Jackson-Rowe {{friendship}} {{would last}} for several years, {{during which time}} Rowe married and divorced Richard Edelman, a man she claimed to <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> trapped by. Rowe and the musician would both {{talk to each other}} about their unhappy marriages; his with Presley and hers with Edelman, a teacher at Hollywood High School. Like Jackson's first wife, Rowe supported the entertainer when he was accused of child sexual abuse. Jackson kept his friendship with Rowe a secret from his wife, who eventually found out but thought nothing of it; she felt the dermatologist's assistant was not her husband's type because she was not glamorous enough.|$|E
60|$|I cannot {{tell the}} bitter {{disappointment}} that took possession of me when my search {{proved to be}} of so little avail; for I <b>had</b> <b>felt</b> so sure of finding the jewel or some traces of it, and <b>had</b> <b>felt</b> so sure {{of being able to}} secure it again, that I could not bear to give up my search, but continued it after every hope had expired.|$|R

5|$|The Life of Saint Edward {{claims that}} while Godwin was in exile Robert {{tried to persuade}} King Edward to divorce Edith, Godwin's daughter, but Edward refused and instead she {{was sent to a}} nunnery. However, the Life is a hagiography, written soon after Edward's death to show Edward as a saint. Thus it {{stresses}} that Edward voluntarily remained celibate, something unlikely to have been true and not corroborated by any other source. Modern historians <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> it more likely that Edward, at Robert's urging, wished to divorce Edith and remarry in order to have children to succeed him on the English throne, although it is possible that he merely wished to be rid of her, without necessarily wanting a divorce.|$|E
5|$|According to Herodotus, {{both sides}} wished for a decisive battle that would tip {{the war in}} their favor. However, Lazenby {{believed}} that Mardonius' actions during the Plataea campaign were not consistent with an aggressive policy. He interprets the Persian operations during the prelude not as attempts to force the Allies into battle but as attempts to force the Allies into retreat (which indeed became the case). Mardonius may <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> he had little to gain in battle {{and that he could}} simply wait for the Greek alliance to fall apart (as it had nearly done over the winter). There can be little doubt from Herodotus' account that Mardonius was prepared to accept battle on his own terms, however. Regardless of the exact motives, the initial strategic situation allowed both sides to procrastinate, since food supplies were ample for both armies. Under these conditions, the tactical considerations outweighed the strategic need for action.|$|E
5|$|Although Henry had {{announced}} his plans at the November 1399 parliament, {{he did not}} attempt a winter campaign, but continued to hold quasi-negotiations 'in which he must <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> the Scots were profoundly irritating.' At the same time, {{it appears that the}} House of Commons was not keen on the forthcoming war, and, since extravagence had been a major complaint against Henry's predecessor, Henry was probably constrained in requesting a subsidy. At this point, parliament was clearly still opposed to a Scottish war, and may eve have believed a possible French invasion the imperative issue. In June 1400, the king summonsed his Duchy of Lancaster retainers to muster at York, and they in turn brought their personal feudal retinues. At this point, with the invasion being obvious to all, the Scots attempted to re-open negotiations. Although Scottish ambassadors arrived at York to meet the king around 26 June, they returned to Scotland within two weeks.|$|E
