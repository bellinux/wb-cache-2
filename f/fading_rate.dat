40|$|The {{volcanic}} {{origin of}} the sediments from Sulawesi, Indonesia, provides a particular challenge for luminescence dating due to the dim optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) from quartz, and the high anomalous <b>fading</b> <b>rate</b> in the infrared (IR) stimulated luminescence (IRSL) from feldspars. In this study, we present results of dating the sanidine feldspars from 2 samples taken from an archaeological site (Leang Bulu Bettue) in the Maros karsts of South Sulawesi. We tested the post-IR IRSL (pIRIR) procedures {{in order to find}} a stable luminescence signal that is less affected by anomalous fading. It was found that there is a highly variable anomalous <b>fading</b> <b>rate</b> in the IRSL and pIRIR signals for different grains and aliquots, and a low temperature IR stimulation (at 50 ◦C or 100 ◦C) used in a pIRIR procedure cannot completely remove the anomalous fading for the subsequent pIRIR signals. The large uncertainties associated with fading rates prevent the application of fading-correction procedures. We propose a method to obtain reliable De estimates by extrapolation of the relationship between De and laboratory <b>fading</b> <b>rate</b> (g-value). The resultant luminescence ages show consistency with other radiometric age determinations from the site.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, an {{approximate}} maximum-likelihood (ML) receiver for differential space–time block codes is investigated. The receiver {{is derived from}} the ML criterion and is shown to mitigate error floor occurring in a conventional differential receiver very well. Because the receiver employs knowledges of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and <b>fading</b> <b>rate,</b> we study mismatched cases when these parameters are not accurate. It is shown that the receiver is more sensitive to the mismatched parameters when the <b>fading</b> <b>rate</b> is high. Then, a union bound on the bit error probability is derived. The bounds show good agreement with the simulation results at high <b>fading</b> <b>rate</b> and at high SNR. Finally, a modified receiver, denoted as multistage receiver, is proposed to compensate the so-called intrablock interference caused by the time-varying characteristic of the channel within a transmission block. The multistage receiver offers further reduction of error floor of about half order of magnitude as compared with {{an approximate}} ML receiver.

40|$|Feldspar {{thermoluminescence}} fading phenomena {{were investigated}} here by using newly-constructed thermoluminescence spectrometer {{on the basis}} of charge-coupled detector, and thereafter the discussion and explanation on feldspar TL fading mechanism were presented. The experimental results show that the <b>fading</b> <b>rate</b> of feldspar TL depends on both wavelength and stimulated temperature, and normally the feldspar TL in every region of wavelength and temperature shows different traits, namely the low temperature TL (170 degrees C- 190 degrees) fading at the rate of logarithmic function and furthermore the TL of different wavelengths fading at approximately the same rate on the condition of 160 degrees preheating. While the medium and high temperature TLs (290 degrees C- 400 degrees) do not show much thermal fading, their <b>fading</b> <b>rate</b> at room temperature invariably correlates well with their wavelength, namely the longer TL wavelength, the slower TL <b>fading</b> <b>rate.</b> The thermal instability of traps and the quantum-mechanical tunneling effects can explain the above fading phenomena respectively.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the effects of}} applying coatings of an acrylic polymer containing nanoparticles of zinc oxide (ZnO) on the <b>fading</b> <b>rate</b> in artificial sunlight of polyester fabrics dyed with disperse dyes containing anthraquinone and benzopyran chromophores. Factors affecting the transparency and UV absorbance of the coatings are discussed. Removing the UV component of sunlight with ZnO nanoparticles markedly decreased the <b>fading</b> <b>rate</b> of the dyes, provided the polymer/ZnO film was not {{in direct contact with}} the fabric. When the treatment was applied directly to the fabrics, however, the protection against colour fading was different for the two dyes studied. Whereas the rate of colour fading of a benzopyran dye, of relatively low lightfastness, was decreased by the polymer-ZnO film, the treatment increased the <b>fading</b> <b>rate</b> of the dye of higher lightfastness, based on anthraquinone. This effect has been attributed to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) when ZnO is exposed to UV. The effect of decreasing the photoactivity of ZnO by doping with manganese has been examined. For the benzopyran dye, the UV protection was greatly increased, whereas a much smaller improvement was found for the anthraquinone-based dye. <br /...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} an information-theoretic measure for {{the selection of}} effective memory order in time-varying flat-fading (FF) channels in the Jakes-Clarke’s model. The measure is based on how many past realisations of the fading channel actively contribute to an achievable information rate lower bound through the channel. The lower bound signifies the achievable information rate when the receiver {{is equipped with a}} sup-optimal mismatched decoding rule, which would have only been optimal for a finite-state Markov channel (FSMC) with a finite memory order. The sensitivity of the mismatched decoding rule to memory order is used to find the optimum channel memory order for decoding at the receiver side, with a negligible information rate loss. Our case study shows that the FF channel has an effective information-theoretic memory order of M = 1 for the normalised <b>fading</b> <b>rates</b> fDT � 0. 01, where fD is the Doppler spread and T is symbol period. For faster <b>fading</b> <b>rates,</b> the use of first-order models at the receiver incurs a non-negligible information rate loss.

40|$|A {{method for}} coherently {{detecting}} and decoding turbo [...] coded binary {{phase shift keying}} (BPSK) signals transmitted over frequency-flat fading channels is discussed. Estimates of the complex channel gain and variance of the additive noise are derived first from known pilot symbols and an estimation filter. After each iteration of turbo decoding, the channel estimates are refined using information fed back from the decoder. Both hard-decision and soft-decision feedback are considered and compared with three baseline turbo-coded systems: 1) a BPSK system that has perfect channel estimates; 2) a system that uses differential phase shift keying and hence needs no estimates; and 3) a system that performs channel estimation using pilot symbols but has no feedback path from decoder to estimator. Performance can be further improved by borrowing channel estimates from the previously decoded frame.
