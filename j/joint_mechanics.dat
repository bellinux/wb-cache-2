40|$|Military {{personnel}} are commonly afflicted by lower-extremity overuse injuries. Load carriage and muscular fatigue are major stressors during military basic training. Purpose: To examine effects of load carriage and muscular fatigue on lower-extremity <b>joint</b> <b>mechanics</b> during walking. Method: Eighteen men performed the following tasks: unloaded walking, {{walking with a}} 32 -kg load, fatigued walking with a 32 -kg load, and fatigued walking. After the second walking task, muscle fatigue was elicited through a fatiguing protocol consisting of metered step-ups and heel raises with a 16 -kg load. Each walking task was performed at 1. 67 m·s− 1 for 5 min. Walking movement was tracked by a VICON motion capture system at 120 Hz. Ground reaction forces were collected by a tandem force instrumented treadmill (AMTI) at 2, 400 Hz. Lower-extremity <b>joint</b> <b>mechanics</b> were calculated in Visual 3 D. Results: There was no interaction between load carriage and fatigue on lower-extremity <b>joint</b> <b>mechanics</b> (p 3 ̆e. 05). Both load carriage and fatigue led to pronounced alterations of lower-extremity <b>joint</b> <b>mechanics</b> (p 3 ̆c. 05). Load carriage resulted in increases of pelvis anterior tilt, hip and knee flexion at heel contact, and increases of hip, knee, and ankle joint moments and powers during weight acceptance. Muscle fatigue led to decreases of ankle dorsiflexion at heel contact, dorsiflexor moment, and joint power at weight acceptance. In addition, muscle fatigue increased demand for hip extensor moment and power at weight acceptance. Conclusion: Statistically significant changes in lower-extremity <b>joint</b> <b>mechanics</b> during loaded and fatigued walking may expose military personnel to increased risk for overuse injuries...|$|E

The level of activation of the primary agonist was held constant {{but there was a}} small but systematic increase in activation of the other flexor and extensor muscles as stretch amplitude increased. The patterns of change with stretch amplitude in both the <b>joint</b> <b>mechanics</b> and stretch reflex properties were non-linear but systematic and were well described by power relationships that accounted for high proportions of variance. With an increase in stretch amplitude, joint stiffness, viscosity, damping ratio and natural frequency decreased. In parallel with these mechanical changes, the neural reflex coherence increased and the phase advance and gain decreased. Multiple regression analyses partitioned the variation in the <b>joint</b> <b>mechanics</b> that was attributable to the various factors and {{it was found that the}} variation of the mechanics was almost entirely attributable to the variation of the neural reflex gain, which accounted for 93 % of the changes in the stiffness, viscosity and natural frequency and 82 % of the changes in the damping ratio.

Methods: Eight cadaveric specimens were tested with use of robotic technology to apply combined compressive (200 -N) and inversion (4. 5 -Nm) loads to the hindfoot at 0 and 20 of plantar flexion. Contact mechanics at the ankle joint were simultaneously measured. A repeated-measures experiment was designed with use of the intact condition as control, with the other conditions including sectioned anterior talofibular and calcaneofibular ligaments, the Broström and Broström-Gould repairs, and graft reconstruction. Results: Ligament sectioning decreased contact area and caused a medial and anterior shift in the center of pressure with inversion loads relative to those with the intact condition. There were no significant differences in inversion or coupled axial rotation with inversion between the Broström repair and the intact condition; however, medial translation of the center of pressure remained elevated after the Broström repair relative to the intact condition.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the work that}} comprises this thesis was to examine the position-dependent behavior of the human ankle joint dynamics. A series of experiments based on the use of system identification techniques were carried out; the experimental stimulus consisted of small-amplitude, stochastic perturbations of the ankle. The response to this input was modulated by two, experimentally-controlled parameters: tonically-maintained mean joint angles and tonically-maintained triceps surae or tibialis anterior contractions. This permitted the identification of the dynamic response of the torque (passive and active mechanics) and agonist electromyogram (reflex dynamics) for a functionally significant span of mean ankle angles and levels of tonic muscle contractions. The major conclusions of this work were that (1) the position-dependent changes in the passive <b>joint</b> <b>mechanics</b> were large and functionally significant; (2) the active <b>joint</b> <b>mechanics</b> depended entirely on the magnitude of the actively-generated torque with position-dependent changes in the active mechanics being relatively small and variable; and (3) the triceps surae stretch reflexes depended upon the position of the ankle while tibialis anterior stretch reflexes did not.

Our hypothesis was that exercise following a short period of immobilization will cause detrimental changes in insertion site properties compared to cage activity following the same period of immobilization, but that passive shoulder mechanics will not be affected.

Following immobilization, rats were prescribed cage activity or exercise for 12 weeks. Passive shoulder mechanics were determined, and following euthanasia, tendon cross-sectional area and mechanical properties were measured. Exercise following immobilization resulted in significant decreases compared to cage activity in range of motion, tendon stiffness, modulus, percent relaxation, and several parameters from both a structurally based elastic model and a quasi-linear viscoelastic model. Therefore, we conclude that after a short period of immobilization, increased activity is detrimental to both tendon mechanical properties and shoulder <b>joint</b> <b>mechanics,</b> presumably due to increased scar production...|$|E

Results for concurrent validity and reliability were categorized as poor, moderate, or excellent. Twenty articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria with a mean quality assessment score of 66 % (± 10. 4 %). Concurrent validity and/or reliability of eight dynamic MRI techniques were reported, with the knee being the most evaluated joint (seven studies). Moderate to excellent concurrent validity and reliability were reported for seven out of eight dynamic MRI techniques. Cine phase contrast and real-time MRI appeared to be the most valid and reliable techniques to evaluate joint motion, and spin tag for muscle motion. Dynamic MRI techniques are promising for the in vivo evaluation of musculoskeletal mechanics; however results should be evaluated with caution since validity and reliability have not been determined for all joints and muscles, nor for many pathological conditions...|$|R
