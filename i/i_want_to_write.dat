500|$|Cody {{said she}} wanted the film to speak to female {{empowerment}} and explore the complex relationships between best friends. [...] "(Director) Karyn Kusama and I are both outspoken feminists", she said. [...] "We wanted to subvert the classic horror model of women being terrorized. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> roles that service women. I want to tell stories from a female perspective. I want to create good parts for actresses where they're not just accessories to men." [...] Addressing [...] "the male-dominated" [...] horror genre, Cody said [...] "a key reason for writing the film was {{to bring to the}} screen a new way of expressing the intensity of female bonds" [...] and that the adolescent female friendships she experienced were unparalleled in their intensity. She wanted to show the [...] "almost horrific" [...] aspect of such devotion and its relation to parasitism.|$|E
500|$|Matt Pryor {{continued}} {{as part of}} The New Amsterdams, an acoustic alt-country group he had formed in 2000, expanding its sound and solidifying its previously revolving-door lineup. In 2007 he formed The Terrible Twos, a children's band that has released two albums on Vagrant Records. Regarding the decision to make a children's album directly after the split, Pryor said [...] "I {{wanted to do it}} anyway because I have kids and <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> songs for them, but nobody {{is going to be like}} 'this isn't as good as the old stuff.' It's immune to punk criticism." [...] In July 2008, he refocused his efforts on a solo career with the release of Confidence Man, an alt-country release similar in sound to The New Amsterdams. After his second album, May Day, Pryor announced that he would be formally disbanding The New Amsterdams in favor of his solo career, concluding the band's tenure with the release of Outroduction, a B-sides recording.|$|E
500|$|During 1965, Dylan {{composed}} prose, poems, {{and songs}} by typing incessantly. Footage in Dont Look Back of Dylan in his suite at London's Savoy Hotel captures this process. However, Dylan told two interviewers that [...] "Like a Rolling Stone" [...] {{began as a}} long piece of [...] "vomit" [...] (10 pages long according to one account, 20 according to another) that later acquired musical form. Dylan has never publicly spoken of writing any other major composition in this way. In an interview with CBC radio in Montreal, Dylan called {{the creation of the}} song a [...] "breakthrough", explaining that it changed his perception of where he was going in his career. He said that he found himself writing [...] "this long piece of vomit, 20 pages long, and out of it I took 'Like a Rolling Stone' and made it as a single. And I'd never written anything like that before and it suddenly came to me that was what I should do... After writing that I wasn't interested in writing a novel, or a play. I just had too much, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> songs." ...|$|E

500|$|Musician and ambient music pioneer Brian Eno has {{praised the}} album and said, {{regarding}} the song [...] "Soon", that [...] "t {{set a new}} standard for pop. It's the vaguest music ever {{to have been a}} hit." [...] Robert Smith of The Cure discovered Loveless after a period of almost exclusively listening to [...] "disco, or Irish bands like the Dubliners" [...] as a means of avoiding his contemporaries, and said, [...] " [...] was the first band I heard who quite clearly pissed all over us, and their album Loveless is certainly one of my all-time three favourite records. It's the sound of someone [...] who is so driven that they're demented. And the fact that they spent so much time and money on it is so excellent." [...] Billy Corgan of The Smashing Pumpkins told Spin, [...] "It's rare in guitar-based music that somebody does something new [...] At the time, everybody was like, 'How the fuck are they doing this?' And, of course, it's way simpler than anybody would imagine." [...] Trey Anastasio of jam band Phish believed that [...] "Loveless [...] the best album recorded in the '90s", and wanted his band to cover the album in its entirety for a Halloween show. Robert Pollard of indie rock band Guided by Voices acknowledged the album as a source of inspiration, noting, [...] "Sometimes when <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> lyrics, I'll listen to Loveless. Because of the way the vocals are buried, you can almost listen to the songs as if they're instrumental pieces." [...] Loveless has also been said by Jim DeRogatis to have been a considerable influence on British band Radiohead.|$|E

2500|$|His {{letters were}} very informal; {{sometimes}} he would just write {{the name of the}} person and start the letter. He was very humorous and wrote very interesting letters.

2500|$|Anthony Kiedis {{was asked}} in a December 2016 {{interview}} if he ever plans to retire {{and he said that}} he expects to be writing music until the day he dies.

I think about it all the time, there's so many things that I want to sing, melodies, and lyrics. So, if you have people you want to work with for a lifetime, there's no reason you can't write songs until the day you die." ...|$|E

2500|$|After touring {{for nearly}} two years, the Wallflowers took a short break before {{returning}} to the studio to record their third album, (Breach). [...] Dylan approached the songwriting process differently this time than he had for the Wallflowers' two previous albums, explaining that he didn't want to avoid the subject of his personal life, as he had done in the past: [...] "(Breach) was the first record that I realized that it's necessary and I have a right to write about anything that <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> about. [...] I'm not going to dance around these subjects anymore [...] [...] [...] I don't have any interest in writing songs that are defensive or that address anything that don't come naturally to me but I also realized that I needed to stop this nonsense of pretending that hiding any of this information counts to anybody; it just doesn't really matter anymore." ...|$|E
2500|$|Looking back on {{this period}} (in 1926), Milne {{observed}} that when he told his agent {{that he was going}} to write a detective story, he was told that what the country wanted from a [...] "Punch humorist" [...] was a humorous story; when two years later he said he was writing nursery rhymes, his agent and publisher were convinced he should write another detective story; and after another two years, he was being told that writing a detective story would be in the worst of taste given the demand for children's books. He concluded that [...] "the only excuse which I have yet discovered for writing anything is that <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> it; and I should be as proud to be delivered of a Telephone Directory con amore as I should be ashamed to create a Blank Verse Tragedy at the bidding of others." ...|$|E
