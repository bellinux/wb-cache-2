40|$|Isolated wrist drop due {{to stroke}} is {{infrequently}} observed, and often misdiagnosed as peripheral neuropathy. It {{is important to}} make the differential diagnosis correctly because <b>drop</b> <b>hand</b> that results from peripheral pathology requires a completely different treatment strategy than central pathology. In addition, small infarcts are important to identify in order to optimise secondary prophylaxis. In this report, we describe an 83 -year-old man, with isolated <b>drop</b> <b>hand</b> due to acute small cortical infarction in the left precentral gyrus and present this situation {{in light of the}} literature...|$|E
40|$|Background : <b>Drop</b> <b>Hand</b> is {{a symptom}} of the radial nerve {{disorders}} that can lead to the inability of all the wrist extensor muscle group, fingers and forearm supinator. Objective : To investigate the implementation of physiotherapy in reducing pain, increasing range of motion and increase muscle strength in case of a <b>drop</b> <b>hand</b> with modalities Infra Red (IR), Transcutaneus Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) and exercise therapy (TL). Results : After treatment for 6 times the obtained results of the assessment of pain in silent pain T 1 : 0 becomes T 6 : 0, pain motion T 1 : 0 becomes T 6 : 0, tenderness T 1 : 5 to T 6 : 3, increase range of motion S : T 1 : 10 - 0 - 40, became T 6 : - 0 - 15 45, F : T 1 : 10 - 0 - 10, became T 6 : 15 - 0 - 15, an increase in muscle strength of the dorsal flexion T 1 : 3, becomes T 6 : 3. 5, palmar flexion T 1 : 3, becomes T 6 : 3. 5, radial deviation T 1 : 3, into T 6 : 3, ulnar deviation T 1 : 3, into T 6 : 3. Conclusion : Infra Red (IR), Transcutaneus Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) and exercise therapy (TL) can reduce pain, increase range of motion and increase muscle strength...|$|E
40|$|A patient {{presented}} with wrist <b>drop,</b> <b>hand</b> paresthesia, and no apparent history of {{injury to the}} hand. Electrodiagnostic testing suggested a radial nerve lesion between the triceps brachialis and extensor digitorum communis with poor reinnervation. The radial nerve was traced by ultrasound, from the axilla to the forearm, and a small comet-shaped mass was identified over the nerve above the elbow joint line. Magnetic resonance imaging of the affected elbow similarly revealed a nodular lesion along {{the distribution of the}} radial nerve. The patient underwent surgical excision of the lesion; histopathologic examination revealed a traumatic neuroma. Anatomic information from high-resolution ultrasound can complement neurophysiologic findings {{with a high degree of}} accuracy. Because it is inexpensive, noninvasive and dynamic, ultrasound should always be performed as a preliminary screen in patients who present with features of neurologic lesions of the extremities...|$|E
