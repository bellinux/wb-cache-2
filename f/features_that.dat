25|$|Researchers in {{structural}} geology {{are concerned}} with the orientations of planes and lines for a number of reasons. The foliation of a rock is a planar <b>feature</b> <b>that</b> often contains a linear feature called lineation. Similarly, a fault plane is a planar <b>feature</b> <b>that</b> may contain linear features such as slickensides.|$|R
5|$|Other {{security}} features include lithographic print (the resulting background hinders camera counterfeiting), anti-copying line structures, perfect registration, microprinting, asymmetrical serial numbers and windowed security threads (thin ribbons {{woven into the}} paper). Polymer versions of the banknote include two clear windows and other security <b>features</b> <b>that</b> substitute its paper version. Several <b>features</b> <b>that</b> are invisible {{to the naked eye}} appear when both versions of the banknote are exposed under UV light.|$|E
5|$|The bulbous base, large spores, and {{distinctive}} habitat are characteristic <b>features</b> <b>that</b> make this species readily distinguishable from other boletes. It has a coloration and cap texture similar to Boletus flaviporus and B.auriporus, but the spores {{of these species}} are shorter (11–15µm and 11–16µm, respectively).|$|E
5|$|The fossil has {{a number}} of <b>features</b> <b>that</b> suggest a {{relation}} to a group of oryzomyine rodents that includes the South American marsh rat Holochilus, its living relatives Lundomys and Pseudoryzomys, and the extinct Noronhomys and Holochilus primigenus. They share high-crowned (hypsodont) molars and several simplifications of molar morphology, as well as other <b>features</b> <b>that</b> cannot be assessed in Carletonomys, which indicate specializations towards a semiaquatic lifestyle. It shows the most similarity to Noronhomys and Holochilus, so much so that Pardiñas considered placing it in either of these two genera, but its distinctive morphological features justify placement in a separate genus.|$|E

5|$|The name Hale, {{which occurs}} {{throughout}} Britain, {{derives from the}} Anglo-Saxon halh meaning a nook or shelter, as supported by the surrounding area which has natural <b>features</b> <b>that</b> would provide shelter. The 'Barns' element of Hale Barns comes from the Old Tithe Barn.|$|E
5|$|The only genus is Maihuenia, {{with two}} species, {{both of which}} form low-growing mats. It has some <b>features</b> <b>that</b> are {{primitive}} within the cacti. Plants have leaves, and crassulean acid metabolism is wholly absent.|$|E
5|$|The spore sac {{contains}} the gleba, which {{is composed of}} a pseudocolumella, unbranched threads (the capillitium), the spore-bearing cells (basidia) and the spores themselves; all of these microscopic elements have certain characteristic <b>features</b> <b>that</b> help distinguish G.triplex from other superficially similar earthstars.|$|E

5|$|A COBOL {{program is}} split into four divisions: the {{identification}} division, the environment division, the data division and the procedure division. The identification division specifies {{the name and}} type of the source element and is where classes and interfaces are specified. The environment division specifies any program <b>features</b> <b>that</b> depend on the system running it, such as files and character sets. The data division is used to declare variables and parameters. The procedure division contains the program's statements. Each division is sub-divided into sections, which {{are made up of}} paragraphs.|$|E
5|$|All {{specimens}} discovered until 1967 were in coarse-grained sandstone {{that prevented}} preservation of fine details, making interpretation difficult. S.B. Misra's discovery of fossiliferous ash-beds at the Mistaken Point assemblage in Newfoundland changed all {{this as the}} delicate detail preserved by the fine ash allowed the description of <b>features</b> <b>that</b> were previously undiscernible.|$|E
5|$|Although Jean-Jacques Dessalines, {{a pivotal}} {{figure in the}} Haitian Revolution, is barely {{mentioned}} in the novel, the one page dedicated to him emphasizes his connection to African gods while neglecting to mention any of his other <b>features</b> <b>that</b> made him an effective leader. While Dessaline's belief in African gods is highlighted, Henri Christophe's abandonment of the religion is stressed, being identified {{as the reason for}} his downfall.|$|E
5000|$|Cleavage, in {{structural}} geology and petrology, {{describes a}} type of planar rock <b>feature</b> <b>that</b> develops {{as a result of}} deformation and metamorphism. The degree of deformation and metamorphism along with rock type determines the kind of cleavage <b>feature</b> <b>that</b> develops. Generally these structures are formed in fine grained rocks composed of minerals affected by pressure solution.|$|R

5|$|Although {{most of the}} character's {{specifications}} {{could be}} customized, some elements were {{to be determined by}} the game's two character types, Legendary and Dreaded. Choosing a type {{at the beginning of the}} game affected several gameplay and story elements. Each character type had unique <b>features</b> <b>that</b> shaped the way the game was experienced, including how the environment and non-playable characters interacted with the player.|$|E
5|$|An initial demo of {{the game}} was made {{available}} in August 2007 for Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows. This demo included cutscenes to introduce the player to Rapture, the game's tutorial section, and its first levels; the demo also included weapons, plasmids, and tonics {{that would otherwise be}} introduced later in the full title, as to give the player more of the <b>features</b> <b>that</b> would be found in the published game. The Xbox demo was the fastest demo at that time to reach one million downloads on the Xbox Live service. The full game was released for these platforms on August 21, 2007.|$|E
5|$|Another early {{example is}} the 1981 Atari 2600 game Haunted House. Gameplay is typical of future {{survival}} horror titles, as it emphasizes puzzle-solving and evasive action, rather than violence. The game uses monsters commonly featured in horror fiction, such as bats and ghosts, {{each of which has}} unique behaviors. Gameplay also incorporates item collection and inventory management, along with areas that are inaccessible until the appropriate item is found. Because it has several <b>features</b> <b>that</b> have been seen in later survival horror games, some reviewers have retroactively classified this game as the first in the genre.|$|E

Any individual rat may be defined one or more ways by its color, coat, marking, and non-standard body type. This allows for very specific classifications such as a ruby-eyed cinnamon Berkshire rex Dumbo.|$|E
5|$|Banjo-Tooie was {{developed}} by Rare and designed by Gregg Mayles, who previously worked on Banjo-Kazooie. Development of the game started in June 1998. Some <b>features</b> <b>that</b> were originally cut during the development of Banjo-Kazooie, such as some of its worlds and a multiplayer game mode, were instead integrated into Banjo-Tooie. An additional world set in a castle was planned, but due to time constraints, it was scrapped during development and assets from it were used in constructing Cauldron Keep. The game features roughly 150 total characters, including enemies and non-playable characters.|$|E
5|$|Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD, {{introduced}} in 2006, offer high-fidelity audio <b>features</b> <b>that</b> require HDMI for best results. HDMI 1.3 can transport Dolby Digital Plus, Dolby TrueHD, and DTS-HD Master Audio bitstreams in compressed form. This capability allows for an AV receiver {{with the necessary}} decoder to decode the compressed audio stream. The Blu-ray specification does not include video encoded with either deep color or xvYCC; thus, HDMI 1.0 can transfer Blu-ray discs at full video quality.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the dynamic portfolio {{problem of a}} market-maker for a derivative security whose preferences exhibit uncertainty aversion (Knightian uncertainty). The Choquet-expected utility implied by such preference is used to capture the <b>feature</b> <b>that</b> the trader is uncertain about which model should be used. The prices that emerge from the model are similar to standard models and have the <b>feature</b> <b>that</b> as uncertainty is removed, the derivative prices converge to standard prices. However, the optimal changes in the agent's portfolio that results from the option position are quite different than the standard hedge position. It is this <b>feature</b> <b>that</b> links uncertainty with market liquidity. ...|$|R
