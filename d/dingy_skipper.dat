50|$|The {{enclosures}} of {{the land}} in 1808 allowed the local landlords to increase their holdings. Thirty villagers also received land, but some sold on to avoid the compulsory expense of fencing it. Colsterworth...The rector commuted his tythes for 398 acres, in addition to his 11 acres of glebe. The position of Colsterworth on the Great York Road, later the Great North Road, became important as soon as the turnpike road was completed in 1752. It was appointed a post town, and by the mid-19th century had a thriving coaching trade. There were numerous inns - ten at one time. However, the village was bypassed in 1935. The old coaching inns have been transformed into houses or business properties, such as The George House and The Sun Pottery, or demolished completely. The White Lion public house, standing opposite the parish church of St John the Baptist, alone now serves the population. About that time, ironstone workings began. These were closed in the 1970s and the site rehabilitated. Colsterworth also lies one mile to the west of Twyford Wood, which was the site of a Second World War airfield RAF North Witham, and still retains military artefacts, including open runways and a derelict control tower. After the war, the grassed part of the airfield was planted with oaks and conifers. The grassland habitat is home to a regionally important colony of <b>dingy</b> and grizzled <b>skipper</b> butterflies.|$|R

50|$|The {{nature reserve}} is of {{national}} importance due its rare Magnesian limestone geology. The wildflower meadows and grasslands are the favourable habitats for many butterflies, {{such as the}} large skipper, the small skipper and the <b>dingy</b> <b>skipper.</b> Plants include Fragaria vesca (wild strawberry) and Blackstonia perfoliata (yellow-wort). Looking {{to the north and}} east, there are good views of the Cleadon Hills and the North Sea coast.|$|E
50|$|The {{woods of}} the forest are {{important}} for various butterfly species. In the summer, the Ercall Woods which line the hill are a favourite habitat for the speckled wood and during spring when the forest is laden with bluebells, the <b>dingy</b> <b>skipper</b> can arrive in great numbers. The exposed quarries are popular with other butterfly species, including the green hairstreak and wall, which like to bask in sheltered spots.|$|E

Yellowhammer birds, a species on the UK red list of Birds of Conservation Concern, can be seen and heard in the bushes and hedgerows around the scrubland within the reserve.|$|E
50|$|The <b>dingy</b> <b>skipper</b> (Erynnis tages) is a {{butterfly}} of the Hesperiidae family. It ranges from Europe across Asia Minor and Central Asia to the Amur region. Erynnis tages favours open grassy habitats up to 2,000 metres above sea level. The insect flies in two generations from May-June and July-August but in northern regions {{and at the}} high altitudes, {{there is only a}} single generation. Larval host plants in Europe are Eryngium, Lotus, Coronilla, Medicago, Hippocrepis etc.Subspecies are little defined and include E. t. unicolor Freyer, 1852 found in Transcaucasia.|$|E
50|$|Rainworth Water LNR {{was once}} part of Rufford Colliery, which created the spoil heaps that form a bowl around the watercourse. The spoil heaps were {{restored}} after the colliery closure and the planting of thousands of broadleaved trees and other woodland species have stabilised the ground. The Water itself is a wetland habitat consisting of artificial pools, shallows and meanders that appear natural and support dragonflies and damselflies. Marshy areas have developed naturally alongside the watercourse since restoration, as have open grassland and dense scrubland. A colony of <b>Dingy</b> <b>Skipper</b> butterflies, which are rare within Nottinghamshire, inhabits the open grasslands.|$|E
