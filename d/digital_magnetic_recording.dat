The dual peak occurrence of the {{solar activity}} as seen in 2003, during the descending phase of the solar cycle suggests the geo-effective nature of the solar activity following the solar maximum. The most remarkable series of activities were seen during these times. Major flares are invariably followed by an abrupt increase in the solar radiation emissions from the sun.

40|$|Adaptive error-correction {{has been}} {{investigated}} to make more efficient use of the storage capacity of a <b>digital</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>recording</b> channel compared to fixed error-correction, without loss of data reliability. Conventional data storage devices employ a fixed level of error-correction designed to correct worst-case error conditions. Consequently, typical redundancies of between 30 % and 40 % are required to correct these worst-case error conditions. Because these worst-case error conditions occur infrequently this level of redundancy is unnecessary {{for much of the}} time. Adaptive error-correction permits only the necessary level of error-correction, and hence level of redundancy, to be applied according to the prevailing error conditions of the channel. A compact-cassette write-read-write recording system that monitors the <b>digital</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>recording</b> channel, assessing the prevailing error conditions has been developed. Severe bit error rates of up to 7 x 10 - 5 have been introduced to the channel of this system. Using specially developed software Reed-Solomon codes and product codes have been employed under these severe error conditions to determine appropriate error-correction strategies for an adaptive error-correction system. This adaptive error-correction system has been compared to a fixed error-correction system. Results show that potential storage capacity savings of 40 % can be achieved over fixed error-correction under these severe error conditions with no loss in data reliability. Under less severe error rates even greater savings should be obtainable. An adaptive error-correction algorithm to select the appropriate level of error-correction according to the prevailing error conditions has been developed. Also, FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) technology to vary the level of error-correction eliminating the requirement for multiple encoder/decoder hardware {{has been investigated}}. Finally, a microprocessor controlled adaptive error-correction <b>digital</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>recording</b> system incorporating an FPGA has been designed...|$|E

An analysis of current methods and procedures revealed that the greatest improvement in both areas {{can be obtained by}} streamlining data measurement, recording, and reporting. A research and development program for accomplishing this goal is currently near completion. The approach used in this program is to automate the tasks of position measurement and ultrasonic data recording and to use computers for data analysis and reporting. This presentation discusses the automated Search Unit Tracking and Recording (SUTARS) data acquisition system that is being developed.
