The co-operative's revenues from a range of milk and milk products has risen from $73.5m in 2001-2002 to $136m in 2007. The co-operative has 6,000 outlets covering 84 towns in the state. Over 260,000 milk farmers are members of the co-operative. Sudha also sells its products to other Indian states like Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Jharkhand and Delhi.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} why <b>dairy</b> <b>co-operatives</b> in the UK are weak or have had problems historically. The thesis contains necessary background information about the <b>dairy</b> <b>co-operatives</b> and their current scenario. The Milk Marketing Boards (MMBs) were set up in 1933 to ensure the fair milk price to dairy farmers. These boards purchased all milk from farmers and paid an equal milk price. In 1994 these boards were disbanded and Milk Marque came into existence. However, in 2000 Milk Marque was divided into three co-operatives. Two of the successors of Milk Marque in the later stages merged with other <b>dairy</b> <b>co-operatives.</b> One of the successors of Milk Marque, Zenith Milk merged with Milk group to form the Dairy Farmers of Britain (DFOB). However, DFOB collapsed in June 2009. A number of studies on co-operative failures have been carried out worldwide. Each one of these studies raises particular points or reasons. When these reasons emerge it makes the future of any co-operative uncertain or most likely to collapse. However, the reasons mentioned in these studies apply only limitedly to the UK <b>dairy</b> <b>co-operatives.</b> Some unique features have been found which contributed to the demise of the UK <b>dairy</b> <b>co-operatives.</b> Most of the data for this study was collected during a visit to the UK in October and November 2009. The data for empirical findings and analyses was collected through interviews. If looking into the factors behind the weak position of <b>dairy</b> <b>co-operatives</b> in the UK it turns out that the ideal time to form and develop the co-operatives through merger and vertical integration has been lost due to MMBs. Capital constrains restricted the co-operatives from vertical integration. Consequently, <b>dairy</b> <b>co-operatives</b> could not reduce the high transaction costs of farmers. Therefore, these co-operatives perform inefficiently to add value in the business for farmers. Hence, all the <b>dairy</b> <b>co-operatives</b> are comparatively small and weak than dairy plcs in the UK. The marketing mechanism is also not functioning well in the UK. A small number of very large retail chains are enjoying enormous power and making the maximum profit due to poor competition among supermarket in the UK. High value added products are rarely seen in the portfolio of <b>dairy</b> <b>co-operatives.</b> Cultural values have also contributed negatively towards co-operative formation. Divergence of interest between members and management also appears especially on short and long term objectives. ...|$|R

This study reviews the existing status of milk marketing and <b>dairy</b> <b>co-operatives</b> in India and provides recommendations to meet future challenges. The {{results of the study}} indicate that 80 percent of the milk produced by the rural producer is handled by an unorganized sector and the remaining 20 percent is handled by an organized sector. It is found that the <b>dairy</b> <b>co-operatives</b> {{play a vital role in}} alleviating rural poverty by augmenting rural milk production and marketing. Involvement of intermediaries; lack of bargaining power by the producers; and lack of infrastructure facilities for collection, storage, transportation, and processing are the major constraints which affect the prices received by producers in milk marketing. Milk quality, product development, infrastructure support development, and global marketing are found to be future challenges of India’s milk marketing.

In many areas of the Kangayam grassland, progressive farmers plough the Cenchrus-dominated field in alternate years and sow them with seeds of Phaseolus trilobus at 12.5 kg per ha in October and a good crop of legume and grass comes up. Cattle and buffaloes are tethered in such fields. The animals are advanced a few meters every day to get the required intake. This practice continues from mid December till mid January and thereafter the mixed crop is harvested when still green, dried and stored for lean season feeding.|$|R

40|$|Liberalisation in {{the dairy}} {{industry}} in Kenya is currently {{under way in}} several forms. The urban milk market monopoly of the Kenya Co-operative Creameries has been lifted. Clinical veterinary and artificial insemination (AI) services are no longer publicly supported in many areas. Private sector response to these reforms {{was expected to be}} greatest in the high-potential market-oriented dairy zones of Central Province, where the <b>dairy</b> farmers' <b>co-operative</b> societies {{play a central role in}} meeting the needs of dairy producers. A sruvey conducted by the authors measured the changes between 1990 and 1995 in milk marketing and service provision by the <b>dairy</b> <b>co-operatives.</b> Tabular and GIS analyses were used to evaluate the survey data. Dramatic changes in milk market patterns are apparent, in ways unintended by the policy reforms. Most notable has been a large increase in the role of the unregulated raw milk market. This helped increase real milk prices paid to producers by up to 50 percent, but also led to a steepening of the price gradient with distance from urban consumption centres. Large increases were observed in the provision of veterinary and AI services by the <b>dairy</b> farmers' <b>co-operatives</b> societies, whose producer client base and credit facilities may enable them to compete effectively with the independent private secotr. Market liberalisation therefore expanded the role of the raw milk market and the participation of the <b>dairy</b> farmers' <b>co-operative</b> societies in milk marketing and the provision of input services...|$|R

This process is described in the form of six distinct but interwoven episodes: the elimination of the privately-owned creameries, the amalgamation of <b>dairy</b> <b>co-operatives</b> into larger units, internal rationalisation of processing within these units (including the closure of branch creameries), concentration of on-farm milk production and, most recently, internationalisation accompanied by the movement towards privatisation of the largest <b>dairy</b> processing <b>co-operatives.</b> Among the outcomes of these combined processes have been the widespread elimination of dairy farmers from the industry and the reduction of those remaining to the essential status of contract suppliers to large agribusiness enterprises whose primary orientation is now increasingly focused on private shareholders and overseas operations...|$|R
