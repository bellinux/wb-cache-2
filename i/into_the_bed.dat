500|$|Prior to European settlement, Cibolo Creek was {{referred}} to as Xoloton by the Coahuiltecan Indians. [...] The Tonkawa called it Bata Coniquiyoqui, as noted by Father Damian Massanet, who referred to the creek as Santa Crecencia in 1691. It is thought that Coahuila Governor Alonso de Leon had one of the earliest encounters with the creek in 1689 while on the first Spanish entrada to explore the French-claimed lands believed to lie beyond the Nueces River. Records suggest a camp was set up on the creek, identified as Arroyo del Leon, coined from the discovery of a dead mountain lion along the banks. Explorer Domingo Terán de los Ríos named the creek San Ygnacio de Loyola in 1691 during an expedition and Domingo Ramón referred to it as San Xavier in 1716. [...] The first known use of the term Cibolo came from Marqués de San Miguel de Aguayo who identified the stream as Río Cibolo, or Cibolo River, in 1721. Cibolo is a Spanish and Native American term for American bison (buffalo), which used to inhabit the area. The Native Americans are believed to have used the steeply banked bluffs along the creek as hunting grounds, chasing herds of buffalo <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> where the creatures would fall to their deaths.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the most}} {{striking}} disorders of consciousness goes by the name anosognosia, a Greek-derived term meaning unawareness of disease. [...] This is a condition in which patients are disabled in some way, most commonly {{as a result of a}} stroke, but either misunderstand the nature of the problem or deny that there is anything wrong with them. [...] The most frequently occurring form is seen in people who have experienced a stroke damaging the parietal lobe in the right hemisphere of the brain, giving rise to a syndrome known as hemispatial neglect, characterized by an inability to direct action or attention toward objects located to the left with respect to their bodies. [...] Patients with hemispatial neglect are often paralyzed on the right side of the body, but sometimes deny being unable to move. [...] When questioned about the obvious problem, the patient may avoid giving a direct answer, or may give an explanation that doesn't make sense. [...] Patients with hemispatial neglect may also fail to recognize paralyzed parts of their bodies: [...] one frequently mentioned case is of a man who repeatedly tried to throw his own paralyzed right leg out of the bed he was lying in, and when asked what he was doing, complained that somebody had put a dead leg <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> with him. [...] An even more striking type of anosognosia is Anton–Babinski syndrome, a rarely occurring condition in which patients become blind but claim to be able to see normally, and persist in this claim in spite of all evidence to the contrary.|$|E

40|$|The {{transport}} of the dibasic amino acid L-lysine across the serosal pole of the intestinal epithelium {{has been studied}} using the vascularly perfused anuran small intestine. The exit of pre-loaded lysine <b>into</b> <b>the</b> vascular <b>bed</b> was inhibited by L-ornithine (2 mM) and L-arginine (10 mM) when pulsed through the lumen during the wash-out, while 2 -aminoisobutyric acid (AIB), L-histidine, L-citrulline and L-cystine had no effect. Luminal L-leucine and L-alanine at a concentration of 10 mM markedly stimulated the unloading of lysine <b>into</b> <b>the</b> vascular <b>bed</b> and sarcosine, L-proline and beta-alanine also did so to a lesser extent. The instantaneous rate constant for lysine exit <b>into</b> <b>the</b> vascular <b>bed</b> was increased {{by the presence of}} L-arginine, L-ornithine, L-citrulline, L-histidine, AIB, L-leucine and L-alanine at a concentration of 10 mM in <b>the</b> vascular <b>bed.</b> L-proline had no effect. The simultaneously measured efflux of lysine <b>into</b> <b>the</b> lumen was unaffected by the presence of the other amino acids in <b>the</b> vascular <b>bed.</b> <b>The</b> uptake of lysine <b>into</b> <b>the</b> epithelium from <b>the</b> vascular <b>bed</b> was accelerated by L-ornithine and slightly by L-arginine when they were present in the lumen, while L-leucine, L-alanine, beta-alanine, L-proline, L-citrulline, sarcosine, L-histidine and AIB had no effect. The instantaneous rate constant for lysine wash-out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> vascular <b>bed</b> was transiently increased by the presence of L-leucine in <b>the</b> vascular <b>bed</b> at concentrations of 10, 0. 10 and 0. 01 mM. The steady-state transfer of lysine from the lumen to <b>the</b> vascular <b>bed</b> was stimulated in a biphasic manner by 5 mM-leucine in the lumen and by 0. 5 mM-leucine in <b>the</b> vascular <b>bed.</b> <b>The</b> mechanisms for these interactions between lysine transport across the basolateral membrane of the enterocyte and other amino acids are discussed and a possible role for neutral amino acid stimulation of lysine exit is proposed...|$|R

2500|$|By 1142, David had {{withdrawn}} his support, and Cumin resorted to using a forged letter {{of support from}} the papacy in an attempt to get consecrated. Eventually Cumin was deprived of his benefices by Pope Innocent II about 14 March 1143 as well as being excommunicated. Around this time his soldiers were described as by Simeon of Durham as [...] "incessantly making forages; whatever they could lay their hands on they plundered....wherever these men passed it became a wilderness. Their torments were of many and various kinds, difficult to describe and difficult to believe. [...] Men were hung from the walls of their own howses....others...plunged <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> of the river....everywhere throughout the town there were groanss and various kinds of deaths". [...] At the same time, the pope ordered a new election held at York Minster which selected the Dean of York, William of St. Barbara. Cumin, however, still had the support of two of the local magnates, Henry the Earl of Northumbria and Alan the Earl of Richmond, and Cumin garrisoned the priory. In 1144, Cumin negotiated a settlement of the dispute, in which he relinquished his claims to Durham in exchange for lands to endow his nephew Richard. Cumin was imprisoned for a time, but eventually returned to the south of England where he had the support of Gilbert Foliot, then Abbot of Gloucester.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1760s, {{a line of}} spiked chevaux de frise was {{constructed}} across {{the top and bottom}} ends of the Inundation. Ditches twelve feet wide and three feet deep were dug across the Inundation {{on both sides of the}} chevaux de frise so that if the lake ever dried out it would still serve as a barrier. Another barrier {{was constructed}} at the south end of the Inundation, and stakes were driven <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> of the lake to serve as underwater obstacles. An unnamed correspondent for the London Chronicle wrote on 19 April 1762: [...] "thro' the middle [...] we have run chevaux de frize, lined with plates of iron, and studded with iron spikes, one row pointing towards Spain, and the other towards the garrison, to prevent desertion. They are five feet high, sunk in the mud, and the spikes above the water; by clasping your hands together, your fingers extended and the backs up, you will have an exact idea of them. Through this inundation an enemy must march to come near us, for the causeway is narrow, and when the tide is at lowest ebb, thirty men could not march a-breast upon the beach and causeway; upon which point we can bring above 300 cannon and mortars to bear, besides wall-pieces and small arms." [...] Iron hoops and [...] "many other articles to entangle and obstruct an enemy" [...] were also scattered across the bottom of the Inundation.|$|E
