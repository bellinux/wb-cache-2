25|$|Until the 1990s, the {{refrigerants}} {{were often}} chlorofluorocarbons such as R-12 (<b>dichlorodifluoromethane),</b> {{one in a}} class of several refrigerants using the brand name Freon, a trademark of DuPont.

25|$|One widely adopted {{replacement}} refrigerant is the hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) {{known as}} R-134a (1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane). Heat pumps using R-134a replaced R-12 (<b>dichlorodifluoromethane)</b> and have similar thermodynamic properties but with insignificant {{ozone depletion potential}} and a somewhat lower global warming potential. Other substances such as liquid R-717 ammonia are widely used in large-scale systems, or occasionally the less corrosive but more flammable propane or butane, can also be used.|$|E
25|$|Tetrafluoromethane is {{the product}} when any carbon compound, {{including}} carbon itself, is burned {{in an atmosphere of}} fluorine. With hydrocarbons, hydrogen fluoride is a coproduct. It was first reported in 1926. It can also be prepared by the fluorination of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide or phosgene with sulfur tetrafluoride. Commercially it is manufactured by the reaction of hydrogen fluoride with <b>dichlorodifluoromethane</b> or chlorotrifluoromethane; it is also produced during the electrolysis of metal fluorides MF, MF2 using a carbon electrode.|$|E
25|$|Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) {{are fully}} {{halogenated}} paraffin hydrocarbons that contain only carbon, chlorine, and fluorine, produced as volatile derivative of methane, ethane, and propane.

Because CFCs contribute to ozone depletion in the upper atmosphere, the manufacture of such compounds has been phased out under the Montreal Protocol, and they are being replaced with other products such as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) (e.g., R-410A) and R-134a.|$|E

2500|$|... 1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane first {{appeared}} in the early 1990s as a replacement for <b>dichlorodifluoromethane</b> (R-12), which has ozone depleting properties. 1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane has been atmospherically modeled for its impact on depleting ozone and as a contributor to global warming. Research suggests that over the past 10 years the concentration of 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane has increased significantly in the Earth's atmosphere, with a recent study revealing a doubling in atmospheric concentration between 2001 and 2004. It has insignificant ozone [...] depletion potential (ozone layer), significant global warming potential (100-yr GWP = 1430) and negligible acidification potential (acid rain). Because of its high GWP, 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane has been banned from use in the European Union, starting with cars in 2011 and phasing out completely by 2017.|$|E

50|$|<b>Dichlorodifluoromethane</b> (R-12) is a colorless gas usually {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Freon-12, and a {{chlorofluorocarbon}} halomethane (CFC) used as a refrigerant and aerosol spray propellant. Complying with the Montreal Protocol, its manufacture was banned in developed countries (non-article 5 countries) in 1996, and developing countries (article 5 countries) in 2010 due to concerns about its damaging impact to the ozone layer.

50|$|Charles (Boss) Kettering, vice {{president}} of General Motors Research Corporation, was seeking a refrigerant replacement that would be colorless, odorless, tasteless, nontoxic, and nonflammable. He assembled a team that included Thomas Midgley, Jr., Albert Leon Henne, and Robert McNary. From 1930 to 1935, they developed <b>dichlorodifluoromethane</b> (CCl2F2 or R12), trichlorofluoromethane (CCl3F or R11), chlorodifluoromethane (CHClF2 or R22), trichlorotrifluoroethane (CCl2FCClF2 or R113), and dichlorotetrafluoroethane (CClF2CClF2 or R114), through Kinetic Chemicals which was {{a joint venture between}} DuPont and General Motors.|$|E

5000|$|Traditionally {{chlorofluorocarbons}} (CFCs) {{were the}} predominant fluorinated organic chemical.

Brand neutral terminology is to use [...] "R" [...] as the prefix.

50|$|<b>Dichlorodifluoromethane</b> (R-12) was {{the most}} common blend used in {{automobiles}} in the US until 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer manufactured in the US for this type of application, so the only source for air-conditioning repair purposes is the cleaned and purified gas recovered from other air conditioner systems. Several non-ozone-depleting refrigerants have been developed as alternatives, including R-410A. It was first commercially used by Carrier Corp. under the brand name Puron.|$|E

5000|$|HC-12a, {{also called}} ES-12a, OZ-12a, and Hydrocarbon Blend B, is a [...] "drop-in" [...] {{replacement}} refrigerant for Freon-12 {{and to a}} lesser extent, R-134a. HC-12a is a mixture of hydrocarbons, specifically propane (R-290) and isobutane (R-600a), and is therefore considered nearly non-ozone-depleting when compared to <b>dichlorodifluoromethane</b> (R-12, Freon-12) or 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (R-134a). The mixture can be used in refrigeration systems designed for R-12. HC-12a provides better cooling than an R-12 system retrofitted to R-134a, with much greater energy efficiency as well. Unlike R-134a, HC-12a is completely compatible with the hoses and oils used in R-12 systems, making the conversion much easier to accomplish. HC-12a is also patent-free due to its non-synthetic nature.|$|E
