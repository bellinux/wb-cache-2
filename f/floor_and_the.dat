5|$|In {{addition}} to shared avionics and computer technology, the 767 {{uses the same}} auxiliary power unit, electric power systems, and hydraulic parts as the 757. A raised cockpit <b>floor</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> same forward cockpit windows result in similar pilot viewing angles. Related design and functionality allows 767 pilots to obtain a common type rating to operate the 757 and share the same seniority roster with pilots of either aircraft.|$|E

The narrow leat which once diverted water from Brownrigg Well into the gill beside the mine may also be seen, much higher up the fellside.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the end of}} the 19th {{century the}} palace has been home to three of Strasbourg's most {{important}} museums: the Archaeological Museum (Musée archéologique, basement), the Museum of Decorative Arts (Musée des arts décoratifs, ground <b>floor)</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Museum of Fine Arts (Musée des beaux-arts, first and second floor). The municipal art gallery, Galerie Robert Heitz, in a lateral wing of the palace, is used for temporary exhibitions. The Palais Rohan has been listed since 1920 as a Monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture.|$|E
5|$|The {{sandstone}} schoolhouse in {{the churchyard}} {{was built in}} 1628; the school room {{was on the ground}} <b>floor</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> schoolmaster's accommodation was above.

5|$|In 1980 {{the fourth}} bell {{of the ring}} of six was recast, again by the Whitechapel Foundry. By the 1990s the {{internal}} design of the church was beginning to be considered impractical {{for the needs of}} the community, and the interior was remodelled to a design by Robert Potter, with the works carried out in 1999. The west gallery was restored to house the 1852 organ, together with a kitchen and toilet facility, and the north transept was converted into a vestry with a room above it. Underfloor heating was built below a new marble <b>floor</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> chancel step replaced by an ovoid raised marble dais. Meanwhile, Scott's pews were removed altogether and replaced by wooden chairs.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the natural light from the atrium and skylights, the building is further illuminated inside by lightboxes and screens {{that are part of}} the artwork. Other interior details include steel mesh, a central courtyard, panels of stainless steel, pillars with burnished steel, and excerpts from the United States Constitution on the wall. Also, the areas leading into the elevators have clear panels in the <b>floor,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> main staircase is also constructed partly of transparent materials, with the steps made of gray slate. The exterior ribbons of stainless steel also extend into the lobby of the building.|$|E

5|$|Major Kean {{returned}} to {{the ground floor of}} the Chancery and ordered his men to withdraw into a large semicircle at the main entrance to the Chancery. Most of the Marines were inside the Chancery when the crowds outside the Embassy broke through the gates into the compound. The Marines closed and bolted the Chancery door, the elevators were locked by Seabees on the sixth <b>floor</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Marines withdrew up the stairwells locking grill gates behind them. On the ground floor a water tanker was driven through the Chancery door and the crowd began to surge up through the building toward the rooftop. The Marines on the rooftop had sealed the doors and were using Mace to discourage the crowd from trying to break through. Sporadic gunfire from around the Embassy passed over the rooftop.|$|E
5|$|Scully, who doesn't want {{to abandon}} her Christmas plans, follows Mulder {{into the house}} to {{retrieve}} her car keys from him, and {{the door to the}} mansion slams shut. Inside the house, the agents experience strange phenomena: creaks are heard in the ceiling from the upper <b>floor,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> shadow {{in the form of an}} old woman in a nightgown is seen, among other occurrences. Mulder and Scully reluctantly decide to investigate the floor above them. There, they find a massive library storing two corpses that have the same clothes and hairstyles as the agents, along with two gunshot wounds. They decide to go search other rooms, only to find that every door they walk through is the same library room they first entered. They then decide to split up, hoping to find a way out of the room.|$|E
5|$|Several {{types of}} {{irregular}} construction styles {{were incorporated into}} the building that contributed to its mass and strength not being uniform throughout the structure. These differences in strength allowed damage to be concentrated {{in one or more}} areas rather than being distributed equally and reduced the building's ability to sustain the tremors. Two of the irregularities of the building were the end shear walls that stopped below the second <b>floor</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> first floor carrying its load via square support columns. The result of the design was that the first floor was less stiff than the upper floors, and during the earthquake the building sustained uneven damage distribution, a condition that may have led to the complete collapse of the building in a larger earthquake. Because of its failure at the foundation and first floor level, the building was considered a total loss and was ultimately demolished.|$|E

5|$|The Studios on Broadway, {{contains}} seven high-definition studios, {{claimed by}} Peel Media {{to be the}} largest such facility in Europe. The largest studio has an area of , {{making it one of the}} biggest in western Europe. Fitting began in 2010 at a cost of £22million, in time for the BBC's move in summer 2011. The seven studios vary in size; the large studios are on the ground <b>floor,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> smaller studios on the first floor. The larger of the two audio studios, sitting on hydraulic jacks to insulate it from noise generated in the surrounding studios, is dedicated to the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra. The studio block contains offices and the glass-fronted, 16-storey Holiday Inn hotel.|$|E
5|$|The {{circular}} keep {{was turned}} into a Martello tower, a type of Napoleonic artillery fortification. It was now only two storeys tall, although remaining original interior walls and doorways largely survived untouched. It was accessed on the first floor via an unusual sliding drawbridge, which was supported on rails and could retract into the <b>floor,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> different storeys were linked by a spiral staircase. The ground floor of the keep included a brick-built magazine, and the roof, supported by a central pillar running up through the building, held a single, large gun emplacement.|$|E
5|$|The {{library is}} spread over four {{floors of the}} Marine Parade Community Building, with a floor area of 3,500 square metres (37,675 square feet). As {{one of the first}} {{neighbourhood}} libraries, the library's entire second floor is its children's book section, featuring murals, trivia and multimedia tools. The library has more than 150,000 books and 2,500 videos available for loan. There is a café on the ground <b>floor,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> library is fitted with numerous couches and benches for the public's use. Other facilities include multimedia stations, do-it-yourself service stations, and music posts equipped with headphones.|$|E

5|$|The {{monument}} {{is filled}} with ironwork, consisting of its stairs, elevator columns and associated tie beams, none of which supports {{the weight of the}} stonework. It was redesigned in 1958 to reduce congestion and improve the flow of visitors. Originally, visitors entered and exited {{the west side of the}} elevator on the observation floor, causing congestion. So the large landing at the 490-foot level was expanded to a full <b>floor</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> original spiral stair in the northeast corner between the 490- and 500-foot levels was replaced by two spiral stairs in the northeast and southeast corners. Now visitors exit the elevator on the observation floor, then walk down either spiral stair before reboarding the elevator for their trip back down.|$|E
5|$|The statehouse {{was built}} of blue limestone, two stories high. The {{governor}} and the Supreme Court occupied the lower <b>floor,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> legislature occupied the upper floor, with each house in its own wing. The building {{was the site of}} many great events in its history, including a bier for Abraham Lincoln. The building was popular after its construction but by the 1860s Greek Revival architecture had fallen out of style, and the building was beginning to become decrepit. The building's limestone foundation began to fail, and many feared a general structural collapse of the building. In 1867 the ceiling in the chambers of the Indiana House of Representative collapsed. A debate was held in 1873 about how to preserve the building but no solution was found. By the time that Governor James Williams was elected to office, the building was about to be condemned. It was finally demolished in 1877.|$|E
5|$|ABC aired another series {{featuring}} the Hardy Boys, The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries, from 1977 to 1979. The prime time series starred Parker Stevenson and Shaun Cassidy as Frank and Joe Hardy; Pamela Sue Martin and later Janet Louise Johnson played Nancy Drew. During the first season, the series alternated between episodes {{featuring the}} Hardy Boys one week and Nancy Drew the next. The Hardy Boys were cast as young adults (Stevenson and Cassidy were twenty-four and eighteen respectively {{during the filming}} of the first episodes) {{to appeal to a}} prime time television audience. The series featured original plots as well as ones based on Hardy Boys books, among them The Clue of the Screeching Owl, The Disappearing <b>Floor</b> <b>and</b> <b>The</b> Flickering Torch Mystery. The series received an Emmy nomination and featured a number of guest stars, including Kim Cattrall, Ray Milland, Howard Duff, and Ricky Nelson. During the second season, the series format changed to focus more on the Hardy Boys, Nancy Drew appearing mostly in crossover episodes with the brothers; midway through production of the second season, Martin quit and was replaced by Johnson. The series returned for a third season, dropping the Nancy Drew character completely and shortening its title to The Hardy Boys.|$|E
