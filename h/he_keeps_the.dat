5|$|Paul {{offers to}} manage Georgia Brooks' (Saskia Hampele) singing career and gets her to sign over {{the rights to}} her song. Paul then gives the song to Amali Ward, but she decides against {{recording}} it. Paul attempts to sue Georgia, but drops the case when he learns Jack has died. He then asks for his fraud conviction {{to be removed from}} his criminal record, so he can run for mayor. Karl unsuccessfully runs against him. Paul seeks to separate the hotel from the Lassiter's chain to enable him to sack Terese. However, Terese quits her job and Paul threatens to sue her. Lucy persuades Paul to re-hire Terese and <b>he</b> <b>keeps</b> <b>the</b> hotel within the Lassiter's chain. Paul learns Rebecca works for a civic project called Twin Cities and forges Karl's signature on a cover letter to get Rebecca to return. Paul tells Rebecca that he became mayor for her because he still loves her. Paul asks Rebecca to move back to Erinsborough, but she refuses. Paul disapproves when Kate gets back together with Mark Brennan. They reconcile just before she is fatally shot. Paul blames Mark for Kate's death.|$|E
5|$|Wonka announces {{a contest}} whereby {{children}} that find Golden Tickets hidden in five Wonka bars {{will be given}} a tour of the factory and a lifetime supply of chocolate, and one a chance to be presented with an unknown grand prize. Four tickets are quickly found: the greedy and gluttonous Augustus Gloop (Philip Wiegratz) from Düsseldorf; the spoiled and rotten Veruca Salt (Julia Winter) from Buckinghamshire; the competitive and boastful Violet Beauregarde (AnnaSophia Robb) from Atlanta; and the arrogant and aggressive Mike Teavee (Jordan Fry) from Denver. Charlie hopes to find a ticket but his chances are small as money is tight, and the best has to be made of his annual birthday present of one Wonka bar and a bar bought by Grandpa Joe's money, both of which yield no tickets. All hope is seemingly crushed when the last ticket is apparently claimed in Russia. Charlie, on finding some money in the street, just intends to enjoy one chocolate bar when news breaks that the Russian ticket was fake. To Charlie's surprise, he finds the bar he just bought has the real last Golden Ticket. Bystanders attempt to separate him from it, only for the shopkeeper (Oscar James) to see that <b>he</b> <b>keeps</b> <b>the</b> ticket and gets back home with it.|$|E

50|$|The {{strategy}} to maximize his {{chance of getting}} a four-of-a-kind involves keeping any four-of-a-kind that he has. If he has a four-of-a-kind then after the first throw <b>he</b> will <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> other {{if it is a}} 5 and 6, while after the second throw <b>he</b> will <b>keep</b> it if it is a 4, 5 or 6. So that with 22223 <b>he</b> <b>keeps</b> 2222 and will throw the 3. If he does not have a four-of-a-kind, <b>the</b> player should <b>keep</b> any three-of-a-kind or pair that he has and re-roll the other dice. With two pairs <b>he</b> will <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> higher pair. With no pair <b>he</b> will <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> highest die.

Moody's well-known habit of carrying around his own drinks in a private hip flask allows Crouch to take the Polyjuice Potion as needed to sustain the masquerade without raising suspicion.|$|E

25|$|After Voldemort's death, Harry {{uses the}} Elder Wand to repair his own damaged wand, then decides {{to return it}} to Dumbledore's tomb, {{so that when he}} has a natural death, the Elder Wand's power will die with him. In the film, Harry realizes that the Elder Wand is too {{powerful}} to fall into the wrong hands again, so he snaps it in two and throws it off a bridge. He also drops the Resurrection Stone in the Forbidden Forest but decides not to look for it in the hope that no wizard or witch {{will ever be able to}} own all three Hallows. <b>He</b> <b>keeps</b> <b>the</b> Cloak he had inherited, with the thought that he might pass it on to his children someday.|$|E
25|$|In Milan, Proteus finds Valentine in {{love with}} the Duke's daughter, Silvia. Despite being {{in love with}} Julia, Proteus falls {{instantly}} in love with Silvia and vows to win her. Unaware of Proteus' feelings, Valentine tells him the Duke wants Silvia to marry the foppish but wealthy Thurio, against her wishes. Because the Duke suspects that his daughter and Valentine are in love, he locks her nightly in a tower, to which <b>he</b> <b>keeps</b> <b>the</b> only key. However, Valentine tells Proteus that he plans to free her by means of a corded ladder, and together, they will elope. Proteus immediately informs the Duke, who subsequently captures and banishes Valentine. While wandering outside Milan, Valentine runs afoul of a band of outlaws, who claim they are also exiled gentlemen. Valentine lies, saying he was banished for killing a man in a fair fight, and the outlaws elect him their leader.|$|E
25|$|Dumbledore's spirit {{appears to}} Harry {{towards the end}} of the book in a limbo-like King's Cross, after Harry is struck with the Killing Curse which was conjured by Voldemort. During the last book, Harry finds out that he must die because he is a Horcrux. When Voldemort conjures the Killing Curse, Harry does not fight back, which stops him from dying. When they meet again, the boy comforts Dumbledore as he confesses all of his many regrets. Dumbledore then informs Harry of the choice he still has: of moving on to the next life or {{returning}} to his body to face Voldemort one last time. After returning from the mystical King's Cross and defeating Voldemort for good, Harry has a short conversation with Dumbledore's portrait in the Headmaster's office about the fate of each of the three Deathly Hallows. <b>He</b> <b>keeps</b> <b>the</b> Cloak, leaves the Stone in the Forbidden Forest where he dropped it, and returns the Elder Wand to Dumbledore's tomb (from which Voldemort had stolen it). In the epilogue, it is revealed that Harry names his second son Albus Severus Potter after Dumbledore and Snape.|$|E

25|$|As {{earlier with}} Perugino and others, Raphael {{was able to}} {{assimilate}} the influence of Florentine art, whilst keeping his own developing style. Frescos in Perugia of about 1505 show a new monumental quality in the figures which may represent the influence of Fra Bartolomeo, who Vasari says {{was a friend of}} Raphael. But the most striking influence in the work of these years is Leonardo da Vinci, who returned to the city from 1500 to 1506. Raphael's figures begin to take more dynamic and complex positions, and though as yet his painted subjects are still mostly tranquil, he made drawn studies of fighting nude men, one of the obsessions of the period in Florence. Another drawing is a portrait of a young woman that uses the three-quarter length pyramidal composition of the just-completed Mona Lisa, but still looks completely Raphaelesque. Another of Leonardo's compositional inventions, the pyramidal Holy Family, was repeated in a series of works that remain among his most famous easel paintings. There is a drawing by Raphael in the Royal Collection of Leonardo's lost Leda and the Swan, from which he adapted the contrapposto pose of his own Saint Catherine of Alexandria. He also perfects his own version of Leonardo's sfumato modelling, to give subtlety to his painting of flesh, and develops the interplay of glances between his groups, which are much less enigmatic than those of Leonardo. But <b>he</b> <b>keeps</b> <b>the</b> soft clear light of Perugino in his paintings.|$|E
500|$|In polymeters {{typically}} used by Meshuggah, the guitars might play in odd meters such as 5/16 or 17/16, while drums play in 4/4. One particular example of Haake's use of polymeter is 4/4 against 23/16 bimeter, in which <b>he</b> <b>keeps</b> <b>the</b> hi-hat and ride cymbal in 4/4 time but uses the snare and double bass drums in 23/16 time. On [...] "Rational Gaze" [...] (from Nothing), Haake plays simple 4/4 time, hitting the snare on each third beat, for 16 bars. At the same time, the guitars and bass are playing same quarter notes, albeit {{in a different}} time signature; eventually both sides meet up again at the 64th beat. Hagström notes about the polymeters, [...] "We've never really been into the odd time signatures we get accused of using. Everything we do is based around a 4/4 core. It's just that we arrange parts differently around that center {{to make it seem}} like something else is going on." ...|$|E
500|$|Kershaw's {{pitching}} style {{relies on}} deception, movement and changes of velocity. <b>He</b> <b>keeps</b> <b>the</b> ball hidden {{so that it}} is hard for the batter to pick up the ball and has a consistent overhand delivery on all of his pitches, he also consistently lands low on the strikezone below the catcher's knees, causing batters to chase the ball even when the ball is clearly going to hit the dirt. Out of the windup, Kershaw lowers his right foot vertically with a slight pause before moving it forward toward the plate. The motion was described during the 2015 National League Division Series as a [...] "kickstand move" [...] drawing comparison with one setting a kickstand on a bicycle. Out of the stretch, he uses a slide step as it makes it difficult for the base runner at first base to get a read on him. He has stated many times that he has modeled his pitching mechanics after his favorite pitcher growing up, Roger Clemens.|$|E

Jeff Simon of The Buffalo News called the book a [...] "definitive history" [...] of the 2010 Tonight Show conflict. Willa Paskin wrote for New York Magazine that Carter, [...] "spoke with enough people involved in the situation to provide an account so detailed, it even includes re-created conversations and dialogue". Neal Justin of Star Tribune commented on the author's neutrality in his writing style, [...] "The next time network TV executives stumble into an ugly behind-the-scenes battle, they should consider hiring Bill Carter to negotiate.
