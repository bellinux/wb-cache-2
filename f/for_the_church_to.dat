5|$|The {{reign of}} Constantine {{established}} {{a precedent for}} {{the position of the}} emperor as having great influence and ultimate regulatory authority within the religious discussions involving the early Christian councils of that time, e.g., most notably the dispute over Arianism. Constantine himself disliked the risks to societal stability that religious disputes and controversies brought with them, preferring where possible to establish an orthodoxy. His influence over the early Church councils was to enforce doctrine, root out heresy, and uphold ecclesiastical unity; what proper worship and doctrines and dogma consisted of was <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>to</b> determine, {{in the hands of the}} participating bishops.|$|E
25|$|In July 2012, the Presbyterian Church (USA) General Assembly {{decided to}} reject {{divestment}} and instead focus on investment. By a narrow vote of 333-331, the members voted to discard a resolution proposing divestment from Israel. This {{was followed by}} a vote of 369-290, with eight abstentions, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>to</b> pursue positive investment in the territories.|$|E
25|$|Smith {{was troubled}} {{because of the}} number of members joining the church in poverty in Kirtland, Ohio. Revenue was needed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>to</b> publish books and tracts. At this time, Smith and Rigdon were both in {{economic}} distress. Smith and his wife Emma lived on the Morley farm for a period of time.|$|E
50|$|Clifton {{advocated}} {{a role for}} churches in social action, not just in social service, important though the latter is. Such a role should be a non-party role {{and it is not}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>churches</b> <b>to</b> tell believers or members how to cast their vote.|$|R

25|$|Another way <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>to</b> confirm {{its role}} {{was through the}} {{administration}} of the rites. Some churches have decorative schemes which support this role of the church, illustrating the various rites and sacraments. The Church of St John at Tideswell in Derbyshire has a particularly fine set of 20th-century bench-ends by Advent and William Hunstone, showing the rites of Baptism, Confirmation and Ordination.|$|E
25|$|In 1918, {{the church}} began {{some changes in}} its governance. The elders, deacons and {{trustees}} all jointly approved its first annual budget. This paved the way <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>to</b> merge with the Second Dutch Church 20 years later, making them a single organization again after over a century apart, {{now known as the}} First Church in Albany. To accommodate the combined congregations, the old lecture hall was replaced with a new parish house the next year.|$|E
25|$|In the 4th century, the {{emperors}} Diocletian and Constantine {{were able}} {{to slow down the}} process of decline by splitting the empire into a Western part with a capital in Rome and an Eastern part with the capital in Byzantium, or Constantinople (now Istanbul). Whereas Diocletian severely persecuted Christianity, Constantine declared an official end to state-sponsored persecution of Christians in 313 with the Edict of Milan, thus setting the stage <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>to</b> become the state church of the Roman Empire in about 380.|$|E

50|$|Free Indonesia {{provided}} opportunity <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>churches</b> <b>to</b> {{develop and}} grow, though not without struggle. Eventually, with renewed help from Europeans and now also North Americans sent by Mennonite Central Committee {{they were able}} to resurrect one of the mission hospitals and reopen many schools and start others, including one, and later a second, theological school in Pati. <b>The</b> <b>church</b> grew very rapidly, though in a predominately Islamic context. In the nineties the synod suffered from a schism, which after several years was healed. Now the GITJ Synod consists of 100 mature congregations, many congregations in formation and some 40,000 baptized members.|$|R

25|$|Central Bedfordshire Council (then Bedfordshire County Council) {{acquired}} the old church in 1977. The site continued {{to suffer from}} vandalism, as well as fly-tipping, under Council ownership. In 2010, local activism led to plans <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>to</b> acquire a new function. It was proposed to convert it into a bothy to provide overnight accommodation for walkers on the Bedfordshire Greensand Ridge walk, with a full-time warden on site. However, there were concerns that the Council {{would not be able}} to afford the £75,000 that it would have to spend on such a project.|$|E
25|$|The {{reign of}} Constantine {{established}} {{a precedent for}} {{the position of the}} Christian emperor in the Church. Emperors considered themselves responsible to the gods for the spiritual health of their subjects, and after Constantine they had a duty to help the Church define orthodoxy and maintain orthodoxy. The Church generally regarded the definition of doctrine as the responsibility of the bishops; the emperor's role was to enforce doctrine, root out heresy, and uphold ecclesiastical unity. The emperor ensured that God was properly worshiped in his empire; what proper worship (orthodoxy) and doctrines and dogma consisted of was <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>to</b> determine.|$|E
25|$|Wesley himself opened {{schools at}} The Foundery in London, and Kingswood School. A Wesleyan report in 1832 said that <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>to</b> prosper {{the system of}} Sunday schools should be {{augmented}} by day-schools with educated teachers. It was proposed in 1843 that 700 new day-schools be established within seven years. Though a steady increase was achieved, that ambitious target could not be reached, in part limited {{by the number of}} suitably qualified teachers. Most teachers came from one institution in Glasgow. The Wesleyan Education Report for 1844 called for a permanent Wesleyan teacher-training college. The result was the foundation of Westminster Training College at Horseferry Road, Westminster in 1851.|$|E

25|$|The Church of St Nicholas is {{generally}} dated {{to the late}} 12th century, a time when Melnik was ruled by both Byzantium and the Second Bulgarian Empire. There is a single opinion which links {{the building of the}} church with the rule of Prince Boris I of Bulgaria (r. 852–889) and the period shortly after the Christianization of Bulgaria, though the evidence for this is not accepted by most scholars. A second stage of construction followed {{in the first half of}} the 13th century, when the Church of St Nicholas was elevated to the seat of a bishop. In order <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>to</b> better fulfil that purpose, a fence and additional buildings were constructed around it to form a compound.|$|E
25|$|In England and Wales, {{which had}} been {{politically}} united following the Norman invasion of Wales in the Late Medieval period, cunning folk had operated throughout {{the latter part of}} the Medieval and into the Early Modern period. In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, there had been no attempt to illegalise the cunning craft, although private law suits had been brought against some of them by those clients who felt that they had been cheated out of their money. This changed with the Witchcraft Act of 1542, enacted under the reign of Henry VIII, which targeted both witches and cunning folk, and which prescribed the death penalty for such crimes as using invocations and conjurations to locate treasure or to cast a love spell. This law was repealed no later than 1547, under the reign of Henry's son Edward VI, something that the historian Owen Davies believed was due to those in power changing their opinion on the law: they believed that either the death penalty was too harsh for such crimes or that the practice of the cunning craft was a moral issue that was better <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>to</b> deal with in ecclesiastic courts rather than a problem that had to be sorted out by the state.|$|E
500|$|Caversham's Anglican church, St. Peter's, {{is located}} on Hillside Road. Designed by H. F. Hardy, the {{foundation}} stone was laid in 1882. The original design called <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>to</b> have a spire, but because of problems with the tower's foundations (which left the tower leaning [...] from the perpendicular) this was never constructed.|$|E

500|$|From 1952 to 1968, {{the church}} {{membership}} in Tonga had grown from just over 3,000 members {{to more than}} 12,000. The first stake, an organizational unit of multiple local congregations, in Tonga was created in September 1968, allowing <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>to</b> be led by local leaders. By the 1970s, 19 percent of the Tongan population had converted to the LDS Church, [...] "a greater percentage than the Church could claim in any other nation in the world." ...|$|E
500|$|The first LDS {{official}} to enter Jerusalem was apostle Orson Hyde, {{who came in}} 1841 and dedicated the land for the gathering {{of the people of}} Israel, the creation of a Jewish state, and the building of an LDS temple at some future time. After his visit, LDS presence in the city was virtually non-existent. By 1971, the city saw enough LDS visitors <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>to</b> lease a building in East Jerusalem for church services. BYU's study abroad program to Jerusalem, which began in 1968, {{played a key role in}} the growth of LDS visitors to the area. The LDS presence in the area soon grew too large for the leased space to provide adequate space for worship, so the church began looking into building a center for students. [...] In 1972, David B. Galbraith became the director of BYU's program in Jerusalem. [...] He remained in this position until 1987 when the church's First Presidency asked him to organize the BYU Jerusalem Center.|$|E
500|$|One {{commentator}} {{has said}} that Wilfrid [...] "came into conflict with almost every prominent secular and ecclesiastical figure of the age". Hindley, a historian of the Anglo-Saxons, states that [...] "Wilfrid would not win his sainthood through the Christian virtue of humility". The historian Barbara Yorke said of him that [...] "Wilfrid's character was such {{that he seems to}} have been able to attract and infuriate in equal measure". His contemporary, Bede, although a partisan of the Roman dating of Easter, was a monk and always treats Wilfrid a little uneasily, showing some concern about how Wilfrid conducted himself as a clergyman and as a bishop. The historian Eric John feels that it was Wilfrid's devotion to monasticism that led him to believe that the only way <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>to</b> be improved was through monasticism. John traces Wilfrid's many appeals to Rome to his motivation to hold together his monastic empire, rather than to self-interest. John also challenges the belief that Wilfrid was fond of pomp, pointing out that the comparison between the Irish missionaries who walked and Wilfrid who rode ignores the reality that the quickest method of travel in the Middle Ages was on horseback.|$|E

Visiting birders donated more than £3,000 <b>to</b> a {{collection}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>church's</b> restoration. <b>To</b> commemorate <b>the</b> event {{an image of the}} bird was included in a window at St Margaret's.|$|R
50|$|Historically, the ecclesiastical parish of Leyland {{was large}} and {{encompassed}} the townships of Leyland, Euxton, Cuerden, Clayton-le-Woods, Whittle-le-Woods, Hoghton, Withnell, Wheelton, and Heapey. There was likely a Norman <b>church</b> on <b>the</b> site of the present structure. In the 12th century, Warine Bussel, baron of Penwortham, gave <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>to</b> Evesham Abbey in Worcestershire. From the 14th century, vicars were appointed <b>to</b> Leyland <b>church</b> by <b>the</b> abbey.

500|$|In a 1998 Presbyterian Record review, Canadian Christian writer Phil Callaway {{writes that}} What's So Amazing About Grace? made him [...] "thankful afresh for God's grace and {{challenged}} {{to live a}} life reflecting it". Callaway was haunted by Yancey's question, [...] "If grace is so amazing, why don't Christians show more of it?" [...] and expressed his appreciation to the author at the 1998 Christian Booksellers Association convention. When he asked Yancey why he wrote the book, the author answered: [...] "I long <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>to</b> become a culture of grace... A graceful church knows how to welcome failure and rewards vulnerability so that a person automatically thinks of the church when needing help." [...] Yancey asked Callaway if he thought the book would generate controversy, and Callaway said it would. Callaway asked Yancey why his book was so harsh in its description of Christians, and Yancey responded, [...] "I'm picking on Christians because I am one". Yancey said that he knew many gracious Christians and that secular culture was filled with examples of ungrace, including media manipulation of body image and the belief that [...] "there ain't {{no such thing as a}} free lunch", which contradicts the concept of undeserved grace from God as taught in Christianity.|$|E
500|$|With Lisa {{now facing}} a long jail sentence, Marge decides {{to help her}} out. She starts reading Charles Darwin's The Origin of Species and becomes {{addicted}} to it. When the trial resumes, Marge tells Lisa that she now knows a way that she can help her. While Ned is being cross-examined by Clarice, Marge gives Homer a cold beer. Homer, ecstatic at getting a beer, tries to open it unsuccessfully. The more he tries, the more primitive he gets, hooting and banging the bottle on the bench, disrupting the trial. Finally, Ned loses his cool and refers to Homer as a [...] "big monkey-faced gorilla." [...] Clarice then asks Ned to compare {{the picture of the}} [...] "missing link" [...] and Homer shaking the beer over his head, and asks if he truthfully believes Homer cannot be related to apes. Ned cannot and concedes victory to Lisa. Lisa kindly tells Ned that she fully respects religious beliefs, but she just does not think it is proper <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>to</b> dominate the school, the same way that Mr. Flanders and Reverend Lovejoy do not want scientists taking over the church. Ned agrees and offers to take Lisa and his kids out for ice cream.|$|E
500|$|However, Leonard Strong, William T. Noon, Robert Boyle {{and others}} have argued that Joyce, later in life, {{reconciled}} with the faith he rejected earlier in life and that his parting with the faith was succeeded by a not so obvious reunion, and that Ulysses and Finnegans Wake are essentially Catholic expressions. Likewise, Hugh Kenner and T. S. Eliot believed they saw between the lines of Joyce's work the outlook of a serious Christian and that beneath the veneer of the work lies a remnant of Catholic belief and attitude. Kevin Sullivan maintains that, rather than reconciling with the faith, Joyce never left it. Critics holding this view insist that Stephen, the protagonist of the semi-autobiographical A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man as well as Ulysses, is not Joyce. Somewhat cryptically, in an interview after completing Ulysses, {{in response to the}} question [...] "When did you leave the Catholic Church", Joyce answered, [...] "That's <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>to</b> say." [...] Eamonn Hughes maintains that Joyce takes a dialectic approach, both affirming and denying, saying that Stephen's much noted non-serviam is qualified—"I will not serve that which I no longer believe...", and that the non-serviam will always be balanced by Stephen's [...] "I am a servant..." [...] and Molly's [...] "yes". He attended Catholic Mass and Orthodox Sacred Liturgy, especially during Holy Week, purportedly for aesthetic reasons. His sisters noted his Holy Week attendance and that he did not seek to dissuade them. One friend witnessed him cry [...] "secret tears" [...] upon hearing Jesus' words on the cross and another accused him of being a [...] "believer at heart" [...] because of his frequent attendance at church.|$|E
