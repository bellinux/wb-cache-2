Eventually, Atlantis and its people become captured by Brainiac, with Aquaman managing to escape before he is caught with them. He volunteers to assist Black Adam in using the Rock of Eternity to take out Brainiac's defenses, as his trident would act as a suitable conduit to direct the Rock's power.

After his scientists fix the portal, Aquaman uses it to travel to the primary universe from the first game to request their help in stopping Superman once again.|$|E

The studio also believes that such licensed projects are easier to develop. Obsidian considered the making of these sequels as stepping stones towards eventually making original games {{based on their own}} intellectual property. The studio's focus did later shift towards developing their own games, which allowed Obsidian to maximize their creative freedom and escape the constraints imposed by publishers. The studio has used the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter as an indicator to see whether a game or genre is popular or not.|$|E

This offering does nothing to change my opinion. But what the heck do I know? Clearly, the show continues to maintain a large following and the franchise is a license to print money for Nickelodeon." [...] The DVD consists of eight episodes and praised the episodes [...] "Not Normal" [...] and [...] "Gone" [...] by describing them [...] "the best episode on the disc" [...] and [...] "a decent episode", respectively. Also from DVD Verdict, Gordon Sullivan, on the DVD release To SquarePants or Not to SquarePants, said that [...] " [...] a solid collection of SpongeBob SquarePants episodes." [...] He added that [...] "My only serious problem with this set is that it's only eight episodes long; a more complete season-style release would be more efficient.

He then starred in the Jody Hill-directed mall cop comedy Observe and Report, in which he portrayed bipolar mall security guard Ronnie Barnhart. The film opened in theatres on April 10. Critics noted a departure in Rogen's acting style from playing laid-back roles to playing a more sadistic character; Wesley Morris from The Boston Globe opined that [...] "Often with Rogen, his vulnerability makes his coarseness safe...Ronnie is something altogether new for Rogen. Vulnerability never arrives. He's shameless." [...] Later in 2009, Rogen starred in Apatow's third directorial feature, Funny People, with Adam Sandler. Rogen played a young, inexperienced comic while Sandler played a mentor of sorts to his character; the film had more dramatic elements in it than Apatow's previous efforts. Funny People was a commercial failure, coming short of its $75million budget, but has a [...] "fresh" [...] rating on Rotten Tomatoes.|$|E
