50|$|The {{proliferation}} of saloons {{led to a}} movement to turn Mount Greenwood into a “dry area” like the nearby communities of Morgan Park and Beverly. To prevent this, a group of citizens successfully campaign to incorporate Mount <b>Greenwood</b> as a <b>village.</b> Twenty years later, in 1927, the community voted to be annexed into Chicago to receive better services. The promised infrastructure took longer than anticipated to be delivered. Those services finally came nine years later, in 1936, when the Works Progress Administration installed sewers. Residents were still seeking improvements such as curbs into the 1960s. Despite being annexed by Chicago, the area maintained a character similar to nearby blue collar city-suburbs.|$|R
