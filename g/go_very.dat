5|$|After the encounter, Brooke {{returns home}} to comfort his mother at his father's death bed. After his father's death, though Brooke desires {{to return to}} the Orchard, Brooke is forced to stay at the school where his father worked as headmaster, {{retaining}} the post {{until the end of the}} school year. After a brief period, Brooke returns to The Orchard. Meanwhile, Nell's sister Betty becomes a maid at The Orchard and another of Nell's sisters has a still birth. Brooke continues to become closer to Nell, and they covertly go swimming together in Byron's pond, a local swimming hole named after the poet Lord Byron. Afterwards, Brooke departs on a tour advocating for workers' rights, which does not <b>go</b> <b>very</b> well. At the end of the tour, Brooke proposes to Noel Oliver, one of the wealthy girls whom Brooke had been courting during his stay at The Orchard. Upon his return to Grantchester, Brooke also finds himself expelled from The Orchard because of his wanton social life. Brooke then moves next door to another boarding house, the Old Vicarage.|$|E

25|$|The {{origins of}} street rail {{transport}} in the Twin Cities {{are not entirely}} known. Some sources state that it dates back to 1867, when businessman and mayor Dorilus Morrison began building rails in downtown Minneapolis. He quickly joined forces with Colonel William S. King and other Minneapolis businessmen to create the Minneapolis Street Railway. However, the lines didn't <b>go</b> <b>very</b> far and the railway was useless for a time. There are some indications that a streetcar was purchased but never used, collecting dust for several years.|$|E
25|$|To {{the back}} of the church stood the Oldham Corporation Tram Depot. In 1907 the church bought from the Corporation a strip of land between the two {{buildings}} measuring 196 square yards at a cost of £61.5.0. In 1910 the congregation considered whether it might buy the Depot as well but nothing came of this. In 1912 the church committee wrote to the Tramways Manager complaining that the grinding of trams often disturbed worship. The Manager was asked to instruct drivers to <b>go</b> <b>very</b> slowly past the church and to stop ringing the bell at the terminus during service time.|$|E

25|$|The Mutua Madrileña Madrid Open did not <b>go</b> <b>very</b> {{well for}} Nadal. He beat Nikolay Davydenko, {{one of the}} few players to hold a {{positive}} head to head record over Nadal, in straight sets. He then lost to Fernando Verdasco, who he held a 13–0 record against in the third round 7–5 in the third, after blowing a 4–0 final set lead. Nadal stated that he was very unhappy with the new blue-colored clay and threatened not to attend in the future if the surface was not changed back to red clay. Several other players (such as Novak Djokovic) voiced similar criticism.|$|E
500|$|During that {{championship}} season, Speaker {{is credited}} with introducing the platoon system, which attempted to match right-handed batters against left-handed pitchers and vice versa. Sportswriter John B. Sheridan was among the critics of the system, saying, [...] "The specialist in baseball is no good and won't <b>go</b> <b>very</b> far... The whole effect of the system will be to make the players affected half men... It is farewell, a long farewell to all that player's chance of greatness... It destroys young ball players by destroying their most precious quality – {{confidence in their ability}} to hit any pitcher, left or right, alive, dead, or waiting to be born." [...] Baseball Magazine was supportive, pointing out that Speaker had results that backed up his system.|$|E
500|$|Philippe {{was able}} to get an {{emergency}} loan of $250,000 from a Lebanese company, but this did not <b>go</b> <b>very</b> far to completing the work on the project. [...] He got some help in redrawing his budget and a larger loan of $500,000 from a large Paris bank through J. Jay Frankel, a financier on Wall Street. [...] Philippe's investors believed that the re-budgeting and additional loan would complete {{at least half of the}} resort and allow it to open for business, but Philippe continued to make expensive changes in the project such as adding more windows to all of the suites. [...] When it was evident that the project was once again in financial trouble, one of the investors in the property offered Philippe a loan for an additional $750,000, provided that the project would now result in a more modest resort. [...] Philippe was highly insulted and told the investor offering the additional funding, [...] "I have created a Cadillac. [...] You want to put into it a Chevrolet engine." ...|$|E

500|$|During the season, Scott {{played in}} 12 of 13games, {{including}} 11starts, and recorded 1,133rushing yards and eight touchdowns. In {{the first game}} of the 2008 season against Delaware, Scott ran for 197yards in his first career start, which was enough to place sixteenth on the list for school all-time single-game rushing. The following week, underdog Middle Tennessee stunned Maryland, 24–14, but Scott set the game-high for rushing with 123yards. He tallied his career-first rushing touchdown with a 63-yard run on the second play of the game. Scott [...] "dominated early" [...] against 23rd-ranked California with 19carries for 87yards and two touchdowns, but in the third quarter, he suffered a game-ending shoulder injury. His first-half effort helped Maryland take a quick lead and eventually upset California, 35–27. Scott sat out the next game against Eastern Michigan, but returned for the road game at 20th-ranked Clemson. Scott made 23carries but gained only 39yards, a mark that was surpassed by receiver Heyward-Bey on one reverse that gained 76yards to spark a second-half comeback. Head coach Friedgen said:"I told Da'Rel he needed to run a little more north–south. Clemson has such good team speed. If you go east–west on them, you're not going to <b>go</b> <b>very</b> far. I thought he had a couple runs when he tried to bounce it outside. Normally, Da'Rel can do that. Not against this team... I told him this is a game where three yards is a good running play... I don't know if Da'Rel has been in a game like this, playing the whole game that way in a tough environment. He came out in the second half and said 'I'm going to go, coach.' He patted me on the butt. 'Just get me the ball.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|In the {{following}} years {{the role of the}} Angel was more often taken by the leading English contralto Louise Kirkby Lunn, also a celebrated Wagnerian singer (Ortrud, Kundry, Brangane and Fricka), Amneris and Dalilah, and in many ways a successor to Marie Brema, though without her range for a compelling Brünnhilde. In 1903, writing to Brema of her original performance, Elgar wrote 'I have, of course, in memory your fine and intellectual creation of the part; and though I never thought the 'tessitura' suited you well, as the magnificent artist you are, you made it <b>go</b> <b>very</b> finely.' ...|$|E
