As such {{it has always been}} considered a hazardous waste.

50|$|R&D has {{to manage}} the {{following}} functions in order to deliver the requested services:Literature and Patent Research. Provisions {{have to be made}} for a periodic examination of all acquired research results to safeguard Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) and to determine whether patent applications are indicated. Patent research is particularly important for evaluation of the feasibility of taking up R&D for new APIs-for-generics.Process Research has to design new synthetic routes and sequences. Two approaches are feasible. For simple molecules, the “bottom-up” approach is the method of choice. The researcher converts a commercially available starting material and sequentially adds more reagents until the target molecule is synthesized. For more complex molecules, a “top-down” approach, also known as retro synthesis, or de-construction, is chosen. Key fragments of the target molecule are first identified, then synthesized individually, and finally combined to form the desired molecule through convergent synthesis.Process Development focuses on the design of new, efficient, stable, safe, and scalable synthetic routes to a target fine chemical. It represents an essential link between process research and commercial production. The resulting “base process” description provides the necessary data for the determination of preliminary raw material and product specifications, the manufacture of semi commercial quantities in the pilot plant, the assessment of the ecological impact, the regulatory submissions and technology transfer to manufacture at industrial scale, and an estimate of the manufacturing costs in an industrial-scale plant. If the base process is provided by the customer as part of the technology transfer, process, research has to optimize it {{so that it can be}} transferred to the bench-scale laboratory or pilot plant. Furthermore, it has to be adapted to the specific characteristics of available production trains. Bench-scale Laboratory, kg-lab and Pilot Plant Development. Depending on the volume requirements, three different types of equipment are used for process research, development and optimization, namely bench-scale laboratories for gram to 100 gram, kilo-labs for kg to 10 kg and pilot plants for 100 kg to ton quantities. Particularities of laboratory processes that have to be eliminated include the use of large numbers of unit operations, dilute reaction mixtures, vast quantities of solvents for extraction, <b>evaporation</b> <b>to</b> <b>dryness,</b> drying of solutions with hygroscopic salts. Although modern reaction calorimeters consent to foresee the effects of these different conditions to a certain extent, a direct transfer of a process from the laboratory to the industrial scale is not recommended, because of the inherent safety, environmental, and economic risks. In development, the viability of the process on a semi commercial scale has to be demonstrated. Trial quantities of the new fine chemical have to be manufactured for market development, clinical tests, and other requirements. The necessary data have to be generated to enable the engineering department to plan the modifications of the industrial-scale plant and in order to calculate production costs for the expected large-volume requirements. Both equipment and plant layout of the pilot plant reflect those of an industrial multipurpose plant, except for the size of reaction vessels (bench-scale laboratory ~10-60 liters; pilot plant ~100-2500 liters) and the degree of process automation. Before the process is ready for transfer to the industrial-scale plant, the following activities have to be completed: Adaptation of the laboratory process to the constraints of a pilot plant, hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis, execution of demonstration batches. The main differences between laboratory synthesis and industrial scale production are shown in Table 4.|$|E
40|$|It {{is shown}} how ratios of element mass {{fractions}} {{could possibly be}} used as markers for origin determination of biodiesel materials of the 1 st generation. This is a feasibility study on three samples of soya beans, three samples of canola/rape seeds and the six corresponding final biodiesel products. It is underpinned by a careful validation of the measurement procedures developed. Sample digestion was performed with acids in a high pressure asher or a microwave oven depending on samples. Followed, under ultra-clean laboratory conditions, <b>evaporations</b> <b>to</b> <b>dryness</b> of the digests, re-dissolutions of the solid residues in 2 % HNO 3 and, for raw plant materials, a final dilution step with 2 % HNO 3 (1 : 100 and 1 : 1000). Mass fractions of B, Mg, P, S, V, Cu, Sn, Fe and Zn were measured in all samples by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. These elements were selected from preliminary screening results on 105 and 33 m/z values in biodiesel samples at low and medium mass resolutions, respectively. Selection criteria were: measurement signals better than 10 % repeatable and at least 3 {{times larger than the}} standard deviation on procedural blanks; and less than 5 % relative difference between the measured (not corrected for mass discrimination effects) and natural isotope ratios. Efforts were made at reducing procedural blanks and stabilising their reproducibility to 10 - 30 %. Procedure validation consisted in identifying the factors influencing the results, estimating combined uncertainties and assessing trueness from recovery tests on the certified reference material BCR- 191 and simulated biodiesel samples. Recoveries larger than 70 % were obtained for [B], [P], [S], [Cu], [Fe] and [Zn]. Ratios of mass fractions were computed for all possible combinations of results obtained for these elements in all samples. These ratios appeared to be good markers of the biological origin of the raw products of this study, with strong correlations between results from plant samples of the same type, and strong anti-correlations between results from plant samples of the other type (R 2 = between 0. 86 and 0. 96, and from 0. 3 to 0. 7 when the rapeseed sample was involved). The [S]/[Cu] ratio correlated well too between the biodiesels and their corresponding raw plant samples (R 2 = 0. 82 to 0. 97). Relative expanded (k= 2) uncertainties on the ratios of mass fractions were estimated to be no larger than 23 % in the raw plant materials (and up to 33 % for the ratios involving Fe), and 45 % for the [S]/[Cu] ratio in biodiesels.
