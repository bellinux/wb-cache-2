40|$|Two {{approaches}} to solving optimization problems of dynamic systems are well-known. The first approach {{needs to find}} a <b>fixed</b> <b>control</b> (<b>program</b> <b>control)</b> for which the system described by differential equations reaches a predetermined value and minimizes an integral quality criterion. Proposed by L. S. Pontryagin, this method was in essence a further development of general optimization methods for dynamical systems. The second method consists in finding a control function (in {{the form of a}} feedback) guaranteeing that, simultaneously, the zero solution is asymptotically stable and an integral quality criterion attains a minimum value. This method is based on what is called the second Lyapunov method and its founder is N. N. Krasovskii. In the paper, the latter method is applied to linear differential equations and systems with integral quality criteria...|$|R

The associate degree for quality control {{does not have a}} <b>fixed</b> <b>program,</b> which can serve all needs, any more than all engineering degrees have identical programs. The main ideas which would be common to all quality <b>control</b> <b>programs</b> are the concept of economic control of a repetitive process and the concept of developing individual potentialities into individuals who are needed and productive...|$|R
40|$|Crowd-sourcing is {{a recent}} {{framework}} in which human intelligence tasks are outsourced to a crowd of unknown people (”workers”) as an open call (e. g., on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk). Crowd-sourcing has become immensely popular with hoards of employers (”requesters”), who use it to solve {{a wide variety of}} jobs, such as dictation transcription, content screening, etc. In order to achieve quality results, requesters often subdivide a large task into a chain of bite-sized subtasks that are combined into a complex, iterative workflow in which workers check and improve each other’s results. This paper raises an exciting question for AI — could an autonomous agent control these workflows without human intervention, yielding better results than today’s state of the art, a <b>fixed</b> <b>control</b> <b>program?</b> We describe a planner, TURKONTROL, that formulates workflow control as a decision-theoretic optimization problem, trading off the implicit quality of a solution artifact against the cost for workers to achieve it. We lay the mathematical framework to govern the various decisions at each point in a popular class of workflows. Based on our analysis we implement the workflow control algorithm and present experiments demonstrating that TURKONTROL obtains much higher utilities than popular fixed policies...|$|R
