[...] But Moses did not <b>keep</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> mind, but came instead to doubt the wisdom of God's decree, and began to argue with God, saying in [...] "Lord, why have You dealt ill with this people?" [...] For this reason, the Attribute of Justice sought to attack Moses, as [...] says: [...] "And God spoke to Moses" [...] (employing the name of God ( [...] , Elohim) indicative of God's Justice). But when God reflected that Moses only asked this because of Israel's suffering, God retracted and dealt with Moses according to the Attribute of Mercy, as [...] says: [...] "And He said to him: ‘I am the Lord'" [...] (employing the name of God ( [...] , the Tetragrammaton) indicative of God's Mercy). The Midrash viewed the question of Moses in [...] as an application of Ecclesiastes [...] "And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness and folly; for what can the man do who comes after the King? even that which has been already done." [...] The Midrash taught that [...] refers to both Solomon and Moses. The Midrash taught that [...] refers to Solomon, for God gave some commandments for kings, as it says in [...] "Only he shall not multiply horses to himself [...] [...] [...] Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart turn not away; neither silver and gold." [...] Solomon read in [...] that the reason of God's decree was [...] "that his heart turn not away." [...] The Midrash taught that Solomon thus thought to himself that he would multiply his wives but still not allow his heart to turn away. And the Midrash taught that [...] refers to Moses because Moses began to argue with God in [...] "Lord, why have you dealt ill with this people?" [...] On account of this, the Midrash taught that {{at that point the}} wisdom and knowledge of Moses was only (in the words of [...] ) [...] "madness and folly."

And he had, it is said, the most extraordinary power of managing his men. He was always cool and determined; and what he said had to be done, and they knew it; but his way with them was so frank and kind, and he was so ready to be the foremost in daring and enduring, living worse often than his own men, while he was doing every thing for their comfort, that there was nothing they would not do for him, as the event proved--for if those soldiers had not trusted him for life and death, I should not have this grand story to tell.|$|E

Dr. Pearson {{tells us that}} he intends to go down once a fortnight, and has promised to furnish us with the results of his own observations, and his own reports of this very interesting case. If General Mathieson had, {{in the course of his}} military career, ever been struck in the head by a bullet, I should say unhesitatingly that some splinter, possibly very minute, had obtruded into the brain matter; but this has, I learn, not been the case. The only serious injury that he has ever received was when he was terribly torn and nearly killed by a tiger some twenty years ago in India. It may be useful to you, Dr. Leeds, to <b>keep</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> your mind. There can be no doubt that scratches and bites, even of the domestic cat, occasionally give rise to violent inflammations, and probably, indeed I believe it to be the case, those of the great cats of India are still more poisonous. As is the case with the bite of a mad dog, the poison may in some cases remain latent for a considerable time, until some circumstance may arouse it into activity. I would suggest that should any scars caused at that time remain, you should examine them carefully, and ascertain whether there is any sign of inflammatory action there. I grant the improbability of any consequences arising so many years after the event, but at the same time in a case of this kind, where we are perfectly at a loss to explain what we see, it is as well to look for the cause in every direction, however improbable it may appear." ...|$|E
6000|$|These are the {{definite}} {{and direct}} {{expressions of the}} Greek thoughts respecting death and life. But underlying both these, and far more mysterious, dreadful, and yet beautiful, there is the Greek conception of spiritual darkness; of the anger of fate, whether foredoomed or avenging; the root and theme of all Greek tragedy; the anger of the Erinnyes, and Demeter Erinnys, compared to which the anger either of Apollo or Athena is temporary and partial:--and also, while Apollo or Athena only slay, the power of Demeter and the Eumenides is over the whole life; {{so that in the}} stories of Bellerophon, of Hippolytus, of Orestes, of Oedipus, you have an incomparably deeper shadow than any that was possible to the thought of later ages, when the hope of the Resurrection had become definite. And if you <b>keep</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> mind, you will find every name and legend of the oldest history become full of meaning to you. All the mythic accounts of Greek sculpture begin in the legends of the family of Tantalus. The main one is the making of the ivory shoulder of Pelops after Demeter has eaten the shoulder of flesh. With that you have Broteas, the brother of Pelops, carving the first statue of the mother of the gods; and you have his sister, Niobe, weeping herself to stone under the anger of the deities of light. Then Pelops himself, the dark-faced, gives name to the Peloponnesus, which you may therefore read as the [...] "isle of darkness;" [...] but its central city, Sparta, the [...] "sown city," [...] is connected with all the ideas of the earth as life-giving. And from her you have Helen, the representative of light in beauty, and the Fratres Helenæ--"lucida sidera;" [...] and, {{on the other side of}} the hills, the brightness of Argos, with its correlative darkness over the Atreidæ, marked to you by Helios turning away his face from the feast of Thyestes.|$|E
