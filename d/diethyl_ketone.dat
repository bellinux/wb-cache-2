40|$|International audienceThe halonium {{metathesis}} {{reaction of}} ketones and aldehydes {{is difficult to}} harness for three reasons: (1) the interchange of F+ for O is so exothermic that the product ion often decomposes further; (2) the adduct of XF+ to the carbonyl oxygen frequently undergoes side reactions to the virtual exclusion of metathesis; and (3) the metathesis ion is liable to rearrange to a mixture of isomers. Several approaches have been explored to make this reaction a useful source of gaseous fluoroalkyl cations. DFT calculations reinforce the intuition that cyclopentenone should give a good yield of metathesis ions in its ion-molecule reaction with CF 3 +, an expectation that is borne out by experiment. Other approaches have met with less dramatic success. Variation of XF+ gives a number of interesting results, but little improvement over CF 3 +. Deuterium substitution at the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (a-position) does not restrain further decomposition, but deuteration of the next carbon (ß-position) does appear to do so. The isotopic labeling experiments indicate that the prevalent mode of decomposition requires hydrogen shift followed by a 1, 3 -elimination of HF. Observed side reactions of adduct ions include alkene expulsion to yield CF 3 -containing products (such as m/z 125 from the reaction of cycloalkanones with CF 3 +) and direct elimination of HF (as conjectured for the reaction of CFO+ with <b>diethyl</b> <b>ketone,</b> with concurrent loss of CO 2). Structures of ion-molecule reaction products can be reliably inferred only when the expected mechanism yields the minimum energy structure for that molecular formula. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.

40|$|Infrared {{emission}} from nascent {{products of}} the methyl radical recombination reaction has been detected using time-resolved Fourier transform emission spectroscopy. Methyl radicals were generated by 193 nm photolysis of acetone, and at low pressures emission from nascent photofragments (CH 3 and CO) is found to dominate. At higher pressures an additional emission band {{is seen in the}} C-H stretching region, the time dependence of which shows a rapid rise and a slow decay, the latter being dependent on the laser intensity and accurately described by a second-order fit. The emission is assigned to vibrationally excited ethane formed by recombination of methyl radicals, with the decay identified as the recombination rate and the rapid rise as quenching of C 2 H 6 to levels which have no excitation in the emitting mode (the ν 5 C-H stretch). The recombination rate constants were determined from fits to the decays together with measurements of the laser fluence, and agree well with previous determinations. The wavelength dependence of the C 2 H 6 emission spectrum is invariant with time, and is always red-shifted with respect to a room-temperature C 2 H 6 absorption spectrum. This can be rationalised in a model which recognises that formation of vibrationally excited C 2 H 6 is considerably slower than quenching, and from which it is found that the average level of excitation per excited ethane molecule reaches a steady-state value after a short induction period. Similar spectra and kinetics were observed with other methyl radical sources, and emission from the {{products of the}} ethyl radical recombination/disproportionation reaction was also observed when <b>diethyl</b> <b>ketone</b> was photolysed at 193 nm...|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} this work has been the {{kinetics}} of oxidation of oxalic acid and some aliphatic ketones by nitrous acid in aqueous sulphuric and perchloric acid media. Oxidation of oxalic acid by nitrous acid has been studied in solutions containing a mixture of oxalic acid and sodium oxalate over an H concentration 0. 007 to 0. 17 M, at an approximately constant ionic strength 0. 9 M and temperatures 35, 45 and 55 °C. The order of the reaction {{and the effect of}} change of ionic strength on the reaction have been determined. An activation energy for the reaction has been calculated and a mechanism suggested. The ketones, methyl ethyl, methyl n-propyl, methyl iso-propyl, methyl iso-butyl, <b>diethyl</b> <b>ketone</b> and acetone have been used to follow the oxidation of ketones by nitrous acid. Most experiments have been carried out at 25 ° in aqueous perchloric acid solutions (0. 1 to 3 M) at a constant ionic strength of 3. 0 M by addition of sodium perchlorate. Some experiments have been carried out with methyl ethyl ketone in sulphuric acid media. The factors investigated for this reaction have included the effect of temperature on the reaction, from which activation energies have been calculated. The reaction {{has been found to be}} first order with respect to nitrous acid and to the ketone, and the effect of change of ionic strength has been studied. By varying the concentration of perchloric acid at constant initial nitrous acid and ketone concentrations, the variation of the second order velocity constant for the reaction with perchloric acid concentration has been determined. Spectroscopic investigations on the equilibrium between NO and HNO 2 in aqueous perchloric acid from about 30 % to 60 % have been carried out and from the results the concentration of NO+ at very low acidities roughly determined. An estimate of the value for the equilibrium constant at low acidities has been made. Possible mechanisms for the reaction on the basis of these results have been discussed and a plausible mechanism suggested. <p...|$|E
40|$|Five esters, two ketones, {{and three}} amines showing two {{different}} types of large amplitude motions, internal rotation and nitrogen proton tunneling, have been investigated by a combination of molecular beam Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations. The molecular structure was characterized in terms of experimental rotational constants which have been used to validate the results from quantum chemical calculations. The molecular dynamics has been described by the barriers to internal rotation or inversion. These experimental data were supplemented by potential curves and two-dimensional potential energy surfaces obtained by quantum chemical calculations. The esters and ketones were selected for different frame symmetries and different numbers of internal rotors. This large variety of molecules was important since they were also considered as test systems for the three computer programs XIAM, BELGI, and Erham which treat the internal rotation problem with different methods. In comparative studies the range of potential barriers, for which reliable results can be expected, were investigated. The programs BELGI and XIAM were compared for three molecules, ethyl acetate (one rotor, CS), allyl acetate (one rotor, C 1), and methyl propionate (two rotors, CS). XIAM is an user-friendly and extremely fast program. It can be used to fit rotational spectra of molecules with up to three internal rotors of an intermediate or high barrier to almost experimental accuracy. However, the program code needs to be improved for the low barrier case. For ethyl acetate and allyl acetate, where the barrier to internal rotation is on the order of 100 cm- 1, XIAM can fit the A species to experimental accuracy but the predictive power for the E species is not satisfactory. BELGI is also easy to use and has no problem with fitting spectra of molecules with low-barrier internal rotation. In contrast to XIAM, in the case of methyl propionate with a rather high barrier to internal rotation of 800 cm- 1, BELGI has shown problems with correlations between some internal rotation parameters. The XIAM code was also compared with the Erham code in the case of vinyl acetate (one rotor, CS), isopropenyl acetate (two rotors, C 1), and acetone (two equivalent rotors, C 2 v). Erham is very fast, the transitions frequencies can be usually fitted close to experimental accuracy even for the low barrier case. Especially in the case of isopropenyl acetate, where the splitting due to the propenyl methyl group is in the same order of magnitude as the standard deviation obtained from the XIAM fit, Erham was a good choice to check the assignment. However, since Erham is based on an effective Hamiltonian, it is difficult to extract the rotational barrier. The physical meaning of the fitted parameters is less clear than in the other two programs. Methyl acetate has been the only acetate investigated in the microwave region so far. Investigations of four new acetates within this thesis have shown that typically a low barrier on the order of 100 cm- 1 can be expected for the acetyl methyl group. Some higher barriers were found for vinyl acetate (158 cm- 1) and isopropenyl acetate (135 cm- 1). This is probably due to electronic effects which extends from the vinyl double bond to the ester group. Comparison of quantum chemical calculations using different methods and basis sets with the experimental results (rotational constants, angles between the internal axes and the principal axes) have shown, that currently no general purpose method and basis set for esters and ketones exists. This became especially clear in the case of <b>diethyl</b> <b>ketone</b> and methyl propionate. Therefore, the results of this thesis are also considered as reference data for future developments in quantum chemistry. A combination of three interesting effects, nitrogen inversion tunneling, 14 N quadrupole coupling, and high barrier internal rotation was found in two amines, diethyl amine and methyl tert-butyl amine. Nitrogen inversion tunneling in secondary amines has been studied only for dimethyl amine and ethyl methyl amine before. In contrast to previous work, the inversion splittings were described with molecular parameters using the programs spfit and spcat by Pickett in a global fit instead of reporting the splitting of each single rotational transition. For diethyl amine, {{it was the first time}} that the complete 14 N nuclear quadrupole coupling tensor could be determined just from a perturbation due to a near degeneracy of two energy levels without additional information from isotopic substitution. 14 N quadrupole coupling was also studied in triethyl amine, an oblate top molecule with a propeller-like structure. Also in this case, quantum chemical calculations turned out to be very helpful to predict the stable conformers and to give reasonable start values for spectrum assignment, since many possible conformers can be generated by rotating the three ethyl groups...|$|E
