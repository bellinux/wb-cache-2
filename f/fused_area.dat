In many individuals, the hidden surfaces of their legs are bright yellow. When the frog leaps to avoid a predator, these bright-yellow patches are visible, and may help to confuse the predator.Also, the skin on their heads is fused to the skull; if {{the head of an}} adult frog is rubbed (between the eyes), the skin does not move. This special adaptation prevents water loss, since fewer blood vessels occur in the [...] "co-ossified" [...] (<b>fused)</b> <b>area.</b> When handled, Cuban tree frogs secrete a toxic mucus from their skin. In humans, this can cause an allergic reaction or burning sensation to the eyes and nose, and even trigger asthma.|$|E

30|$|Even 12  years after Lenke et al. [12] {{presented}} their new classification system for AIS {{there is still}} significant debate regarding the appropriateness of performing selective spinal fusions [13, 14, 20]. Between 2001 and 2011 only 19  % (30 / 157) of our cohort underwent either a selective thoracic or thoracolumbar/lumbar spinal fusion in the surgical treatment of their idiopathic scoliosis. The fear of well-known complications, such as progression of the non-instrumented curve, adding-on of the <b>fused</b> <b>area</b> of the spine, or coronal decompensation, might be {{a reason for the}} low number of selective spinal fusions. Additionally, newer instrumentation techniques allow for a very high correction rate that may straighten the major curve beyond the non-instrumented curve’s ability to compensate, therefore requiring an “under-correction” of the major curve that might be unattractive for many surgeons [14, 22]. Another reason for the low number of selective spinal fusions in our cohort might be the fact that the mean Cobb angle of the major curve in both groups (A and B) was higher than reported elsewhere in the literature [3, 14]. This might be supported by the geographical situation in South Australia, with many rural patients presenting late with a severely progressed deformity.|$|E
30|$|The {{study of}} Knop et al. (2001) showed a mean maximum {{compressive}} force of 2.72 kN for this device, which exceeds a little the failure load of the MAC cage (Knop et al., 2001). However, the contact {{area of the}} MOSS was 302 mm 2, whereas the NiTi-l and NiTi-s only have a contact area of 30.4 [*]mm 2 and 15.04 [*]mm 2, respectively. The MAC cages thereby, and through their wide and open design, offer a larger space for additional bone grafts. It has been well known that the surface area between graft bed and bone graft {{is one of the}} most important factors for optimal spinal fusion and secondary stability. Interbody graft area should be significantly greater than 30 % of the total endplate area to provide sufficient compressive strength (Closkey et al., 1993; Sukovich, 2004). Many cage designs do not provide such graft area, with the result that the contact area of local bone inside the cage might be insufficient for load transmission (Lee et al., 2010). Furthermore, the study of Lee et al. (2010) determined contact areas of fused local bone inside titanium cages using 3 -dimensional thin-section computed tomography, and discovered that the ratio of <b>fused</b> <b>area</b> of local bone to total graft area inside cages was less than 50 % (Lee et al., 2010). Although a fusion rate of 96.2 % was reported, this indicates that only <[*] 50 % of the exposed graft area inside cages contributes to the compressive strength of the bone fusion. For these reasons, MAC cages could possibly provide an relevant advantage with their small cage contact area and large graft space in comparison with other vertical cages. However, this statement is for the time being based on an assumption and future research should determine which vertical cage design is superior for optimal spinal fusion. Considering the smaller cage contact area and thus larger graft space of the NiTi-s design, this cage type is favoured over the NiTi-l and should be used in further research study’s. The minimal invasive introduction of the MAC cage leaves the posterior longitudinal ligament largely intact and a large surrounded area for impacting the bone graft.|$|E

40|$|The {{secretory}} {{process of}} the mucus-secreting cells in mouse colonic mucosa was studied using the cryofixation method. Secretory granules in the storage phase of the secretory cycle have a less dense homogeneous content bounded by a limiting membrane.

Some cell organelles such as free ribosomes, vesicles, filaments, and even a centriole are occasionally found in these cytoplasmic fragments. Secretory granules are released by an orderly, sequential fission of <b>fused</b> <b>areas</b> of the limiting membrane with the plasmalemma, resulting in a deep invagination of the surface plasma membrane. The cytoplasmic frag-ments contained within large secretory droplets are lost along with the secretory product. Membrane events involved in the process of exocytosis as well as coalescence of secretory granules indicate that two closely apposed membranes form a pentalaminar complex, but its conversion into the trilaminar structure was not detected at any step of membrane fusion and fission.

However, there have been limited reports that correlate the Er:YAG irradiation distance with dental morphology. Purpose: To assess the influence of Er:YAG laser irradiation distance on enamel morphology, by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Methods: Sixty human third molars were employed to obtain discs (congruent to 1 mm thick) that {{were randomly assigned to}} six groups (n = 10). Five groups received Er:YAG laser irradiation (80 mJ/ 2 Hz) for 20 s, according to the irradiation distance: 11, 12, 14, 16, or 17 mm. and the control group was treated with 37 % phosphoric acid for 15 s. The laser-irradiated discs were bisected. One hemi-disc was separated for superficial analysis without subsequent acid etching, and the other one, received the phosphoric acid for 15 s. Samples were prepared for SEM. Results: Laser irradiation at 11 and 12 min provided an evident ablation of enamel, with evident fissures and some <b>fused</b> <b>areas.</b> At 14, 16 and 17 mm the superficial topography was flatter than in the other distances.

Purpose: To evaluate the alterations of radicular dentine (cervical, middle, and apical thirds) irradiated with CO(2) laser at different potencies and irradiation directions. Study Design: Roots of 35 canines were prepared and randomly distributed according to the laser potency: GI: no laser treatment (control) (n = 5); GII, 2 W (n = 10); GIII: 4 W (n = 10); GIV: 6 W (n = 10). Each group (excepting GI) was divided in two subgroups according to the irradiation distance (n = 5) : (A) parallel and (B) perpendicular to the root canal walls. The roots were splited longitudinally and analyzed by scanning electron microscopy in a qualiquatitative way. The scores were submitted to Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn`s tests. Results: No significant statistical differences were observed among root canal thirds (P > 0. 05). The specimens irradiated with 2 W were statistically different (P 0. 05).

This study compares the photocatalytic activity of APS coatings obtained from different powders: two nanostructured TiO 2 powders produced by spray-drying of two TiO 2 nanosuspensions with different solids contents, one spray-dried powder obtained from a suspension comprising a mixture of submicronic and nanometric TiO 2 particles and finally one commercial, nanostructured, TiO 2 spray-dried powder. All powders were characterised by XRD, FEG-ESEM, granule size distribution, and a flowability evaluation. Feedstock powders were then deposited on austenitic stainless steel coupons using APS. Hydrogen or helium was used as secondary plasma gas. Coating microstructure and phase composition were characterised using FEG-ESEM and XRD techniques; coating anatase content was quantified by the Rietveld method. A significant amount of anatase to rutile transformation was found to take place during the plasma spraying process. In general, the coatings had a bimodal microstructure characterised by the presence of completely <b>fused</b> <b>areas</b> in addition to non-molten areas consisting of agglomerates of anatase nanoparticles. Results also showed that anatase content and porosity of the coatings largely depend on the secondary plasma gas nature, {{as well as on the}} characteristics of the feedstock.

An ellipsoid is a closed type of quadric surface that is a higher dimensional analogue of an ellipse If all three radii are equal, the solid body is a sphere; if two radii are equal, the ellipsoid is a spheroid: if a= b =c we have a sphere; if a= b >c we have a oblate spheroid (disk-shaped); if a= b b >c we have a scalene ellipsoid ("three unequal sides"). The points (a, 0, 0), (0,b, 0) and (0, 0,c) lie on the surface and the line segments from the origin to these points are called the semi-principal axes. These correspond to the semi-major axis and semi-minor axis of the appropriate ellipses.

Using silica obtained from a single manufacturer, three forms of pure (undoped) fibre (capillary-, flat-, and photonic crystal fibre (PCF)) and two forms of Ge-doped fibre (capillary- and flat-fibre) were fabricated. The pure fibre samples were exposed to 6 and 21 MeV electrons, the doped fibres to 6 MV photons. The consistent observation of large TL yield enhancement is strongly suggestive of surface-strain defects generation. For 6 MeV irradiations of flat-fibre and PCF, respective TL yields per unit mass of about 12. 0 and 17. 5 {{times that of the}} undoped capillary-fibre have been observed. Similarly, by making a Ge-doped capillary-fibre into flat-fibre, the TL response is found to increase by some 6. 0 times.

Trap centre energies have been estimated and compared for the various fibre samples. Two trap centre types observed in capillary-fibre are also observed in flat-fibte and PCF. An additional trap centre in flat-fibre and one further trap centre in PCF are observed when compared to capillary fibre. These elevated-energy trap centres are linked with strain-generated defects in the collapsed regions of the flat fibre and PCF. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} image fusion plays {{a vital role}} in the image {{processing}} <b>area.</b> <b>Fused</b> images would help in doing many applications in image processing like segmentation, image enhancement and many. In order to improve the effect of fusion visible and infrared image images of the same scene, this paper presents an image fusion method based on lifting wavelet domain. Firstly, the source images are decomposed using lifting wavelet domain transform (LWT). Secondly, a weighted average approach based on normalized Shannon entropy is used to fuse low frequency lifting wavelet coefficients of the visible and infrared images. The fusion rule of local energy maximum is used to combine corresponding high frequency coefficients. After fusing low and high frequency coefficients of the source images, the final fused image is obtained using the inverse LWT. The experiments show that the proposed method provides improved subjective and objectives results as compared to previous image fusion methods such as Laplacian transform and traditional Wavelet transform. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of robots that closely resemble human beings {{enables us to}} investigate many phenomena re-lated to human interactions that could not otherwise be investigated with mechanical-looking robots. This is be-cause more humanlike devices are {{in a better position}} to elicit the kinds of responses people direct at each other. In particular, we cannot ignore the role of appearance in giving us a subjective impression of social presence or intelligence. However, this impression is influenced by behavior and the complex relationship between it and appearance. As Masahiro Mori observed, a humanlike appearance does not necessarily give a positive impres-sion. We propose a hypothesis as to how appearance and behavior are related and map out a plan for an-droid research to investigate this hypothesis. We then examine a study that evaluates the behavior of androids according to the patterns of gaze fixations they elicit in human subjects. Studies such as these, which integrate the {{development of}} androids with the investigation of human behavior, constitute a new research <b>area</b> <b>fusing</b> engineering and science...|$|R
40|$|A modern {{practitioner}} of machine learning must often consider trade-offs between {{accuracy and complexity}} when selecting from available machine learning algorithms. Prediction tasks can range from requiring real-time performance to being largely unconstrained {{in their use of}} computational resources. In each setting, an ideal algorithm utilizes as much of the available computation as possible to provide the most accurate result. This issue is further complicated by applications where the computational constraints are not fixed in advance. In many applications predictions are often needed in time to allow for adaptive behaviors which respond to real-time events. Such constraints often rely on a number of factors at prediction time, making it difficult to select a fixed prediction algorithm a priori. In these situations, an ideal approach is to use an anytime prediction algorithm. Such an algorithm rapidly produces an initial prediction and then continues to refine the result as time allows, producing final results which dynamically improve to fit any computational budget. Our approach uses a greedy, cost-aware extension of boosting which <b>fuses</b> the disparate <b>areas</b> of functional gradient descent and greedy sparse approximation algorithms. By using a cost-greed...|$|R
