It is applicable to the TIG process and can improve the weld depth/width ratio and protect the electrode from oxidation during the welding process. A two pipeline structure is designed in the torch.

In light of these facts, which adds enough confusion and diffusion properties for secure communications, we explore the synchronization phenomena in spatiotemporal semiconductor laser systems. The novel system is used in a two-phase colored image encryption process. The high-dimensional chaotic attractor generated by the system produces a completely randomized chaotic time series, which is ideal in the secure encoding of messages. The scheme thus illustrated is a two-phase encryption method, which provides sufficiently high confusion and diffusion properties of chaotic cryptosystem employed with unique data sets of processed chaotic sequences.

The geomechanical survey of the tunnel face was performed during maintenance downtime and the observed conditions were correlated with the machine performance parameters for that same day. A statistical analysis of the data shows that penetration rate correlates well with a slightly modified RMR index (in wich {{the influence of}} the water conditions and joint orientation were discounted), but the most important factor is by far the partial rating of the RMR classification related to joint spacing only. However in tunnels characterized by greater variability in rock strength and joint conditions, it could be worthwhile using the complete RMR index. Given the toughness of the rock, failure of the cutter bearing and supports were a frequent occurrance during excavation. Owing to this factor the influence of rock quality on the rate of advance was found to be weak and the correlation more scattered. The results obtained for the Varzo tunnel were compared with those relative to other tunnels in granitic rocks and found to be in good agreement.

30|$|The drop modulus is an {{important}} parameter to estimate the post peak behavior of rock mass. It is the slope for the softening stage of rock mass that related to quality of rock mass and confinement stress as increasing {{in the quality of}} rock mass and decreasing in the confinement stress can increase the drop modulus and it is true inversely. One of the most important applications of this parameter is to predict the rock burst, squeezing and etc because the mentioned phenomena are directly related to post peak behavior of rock mass. In this study, a new empirical method is proposed to estimate the drop modulus using the <b>double</b> <b>shield</b> TBM specifications of Karaj–Tehran water conveyance tunnel in Iran. It is estimated based on the penetration rate of TBM, the equivalent thrust per cutter and the torque of TBM. The result shows that there are inverse relations between the drop modulus of rock mass with the penetration rate and the torque of TBM and a direct relation between the drop modulus and the equivalent thrust per cutter. In this study, new power equations are proposed to estimate the drop modulus using the penetration rate and the equivalent thrust per cutter respectively. Also a new linear equation is suggested to estimate the drop modulus using the torque of TBM. Finally, the most useful equation to estimate the drop modulus is achieved using the ratio of the equivalent thrust per cutter to product of TBM penetration rate on torque of TBM because it is a function of three parameters.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Tunnel boring {{machines}} are important tools in underground infrastructure projects. Although being well established equipment, these machinesare based on designsof more than 60 {{years ago and}} are characterized by big dimensions, enormous weight and high power consumption. Commercial aspects should be noted too. The model adopted by the TBM industry requires constant replacement of cutter discs and specific labor skills, usually offered by the same manufacturingcompany. In some cases the cost of replacement parts and technical assistance can be higher than the acquisition cost of an entire machine. These aspects are no longer compatible {{with the concept of}} sustainability that is an important aspect of currentsociety. While the technical characteristics require a large quantity of steel and several inputs, the adoptedmodel is not competitive. One alternative is looking for new technologies that break the old paradigms and allow the development of high performance concepts with lower social and environmental impact. This studydealswith this opportunity by proposing a high performance tunnel boring machine that makes use of high power water jet and diamond wire to compose a <b>double</b> <b>shield</b> cutter head. It works in two stages. In the fristone, an annular cut is executed by hydrodemolition,and in the second one, the diamond wire station slices the rock core. Only with the action of diamond wire is the rock core separated from the rock mass and the removal process is finished. A smart water jet nozzle movement system is described and non circular tunnels can be executed. The new technologies involved requirea different type of backup system, lighter and smaller. The non-existence of mechanical contact between the equipment and the rock mass at theexcavation front allows low power consumption. The advanced rate and primary excavation cost analyses can also be encountered herein. It shows {{that it is possible to}} reach an advanced rate of 174 m/day in soft and porous rock and 0. 64 m/day in hard and non porousrock, whereas the NTNU method indicates only 55 m/day and 13 m/day underrespective conditions. On the other hand, the excavation cost is high for both conditions. One option is to use sand as an abrasive in the water jet process, reducing by half the primary excavation cost. It is reasonable to say that the proposed concept can be considered as an alternative for tunnels in soft rock and high porosity, and needs better performance of the water jet system to become an alternative for hard rock...|$|E
40|$|For {{long and}} deep tunnels as {{currently}} under construction through the Alps, mechanised excavation by using Tunnel Boring Machines (TBMs) may contribute significantly to savings in construction times and costs. Questions are however posed due to the severe ground conditions which in cases are anticipated or encountered along the main tunnel alignment. One of these geological hazards is the stress-induced brittle failure of hard rocks, leading to spalling (formation of rock slabs) and/or rockbursting (violent ejection of rock fragments). This thesis initially deals with brittle failure, both in laboratory tests (uniaxial and/or triaxial) and in tunnelling, with {{a special interest in}} TBM excavation experience. In fact, this failure mode can create a significant hazard for workers immediately behind the shield, as well as gripper problems and machine operation delays. Rock bursting can even lead to TBM jamming. The description of the many models proposed in the current literature for predicting brittle failure around underground openings is given. The rock mass can be considered a continuum, a discontinuum or a hybrid continuum/discontinuum. The most practical and widely used approach is the so-called phenomenological/empirical approach (continuum assumption). Then, the interest is moved to the current state-of-the-art in numerical modelling of the TBM excavation process. It is noted that only axisymmetric or fully threedimensional (3 D) models are capable to study in detail the complex interaction between the rock mass, the tunnel machine and its system components, and the tunnel support. The most advanced and accurate models are the 3 D models. It is seen however that very few fully 3 D models for mechanised deep tunnel excavation have been developed so far and no one refers to spalling conditions. The main scope of this thesis is therefore to present a novel and completely 3 D FEM simulator for mechanized tunnel excavation of deep tunnels in brittle conditions. The main machine and support components are taken into account. The TBM of reference is the technologically advanced <b>Double</b> <b>Shield</b> TBM. The model is conceived in particular for modelling the spalling behaviour of hard rock masses. An elasto-brittle-plastic constitutive law based on the criterion developed by Diederichs has been proposed and successfully validated through the comparison with field data and the results of other codes and criteria. The considered case study is related to the Brenner Base Tunnel excavation on the Italian side, in hard brittle granitic rocks. Two simulations have been carried out. The first one is a design analysis with reference to the spalling hazard along the main tunnel. The second one reproduces an instability problem which occurred during the excavation of the Aicha exploratory tunnel at chainage 6 + 151, due to the presence of a thin granite diaphragm between a subvertical fault and the tunnel wall. The results obtained show that the 3 D model is highly effective in reproducing both the rock mass response (in terms of extent, shape and depth of the failure zones) and its interaction with the TBM system components (confinement effects producing a reduction of the failure zones...|$|E
