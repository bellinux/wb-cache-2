A 2007 World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) report states that the Indus River may run dry for the same reason.|$|E

Human interaction in terms of direct erosion and fire as well as the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>global</b> warming are the major variables that they considered.|$|E
5|$|According to an {{analysis}} by Tim Flannery, the ecosystem of Lord Howe Island is threatened by climate change and global warming, with the reefs at risk from rises in water temperature. The Great Barrier Reef is specifically identified as being at risk to the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>global</b> warming on Australia, and the same analysis applies to the reefs of Lord Howe Island. Cool climate flora and fauna are at risk from rises in temperature, because there is limited scope for migration to higher altitudes.. The first international conference on global artificial photosynthesis as a climate change solution occurred at Lord Howe island in 2011, the papers being published by the Australian Journal of Chemistry.|$|E

40|$|Due to {{the continual}} {{increase}} in competitive pressure from international organisations, {{it has become}} necessary to assess the degree of transformational change within South African organisations to overcome the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>global</b> forces. Transformation was investigated in terms of organizational restructuring and the various work designs that are utilised by organisations {{to deal with the}} <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>global</b> forces. To examine the main problem, three sub-problems were identified. The first sub-problem that had been identified dealt with the extent <b>of</b> which <b>global</b> forces impacted on the business environment. It was investigated by evaluating various economic, technological and sociopolitical forces. From the results it may be concluded that global forces have a large impact on the local business environment. The second sub-problem looked at the degree to which work designs assisted organisations to manage the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>global</b> forces. It was evident that the flexible types of work designs were more readily utilised to optimise productivity and employee moral. Finally, the third sub-problem investigated the various structures that organisations could adopt to deal with the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>global</b> forces. Organisational structures were analysed in terms of customer orientation, fulfilment of company objectives and the types of structures that are used within organisations. The results showed that 75 % of the sample population believed that their organisational structures co-ordinated all activities within their organisations. Feedback on the type of structures that were used by organisations revealed that various types are being used...|$|R
5|$|Fishermen of the Canary Islands had {{to return}} to and remain in port for several days while {{weathering}} the storm, and this disruption was blamed for a 10–15% reduction of the islands' tuna catch. Tropical Storm Delta also had some further-reaching effects. The political opposition Popular Party challenged that the impact of Tropical Storm Delta proved the need for the island to prepare an emergency plan to deal with natural and man-made disasters. Only five of the island's many municipalities had an emergency plan, and there was no coordination across the entire island chain. Delta also served to highlight the islands' aging power grid, prompting the regional director general of industry and energy to consider building another power plant on the archipelago. The storm sparked a vigorous debate on the island about the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>global</b> climate change, how they will affect the islands, and how these effects can be avoided.|$|E
5|$|Marine mammals {{were first}} hunted by {{aboriginal}} peoples {{for food and}} other resources. Many were also the target for commercial industry, leading to {{a sharp decline in}} all populations of exploited species, such as whales and seals. Commercial hunting lead to the extinction of †Steller's sea cow and the †Caribbean monk seal. After commercial hunting ended, some species, such as the gray whale and northern elephant seal, have rebounded in numbers; conversely, other species, such as the North Atlantic right whale, are critically endangered. Other than hunting, marine mammals can be killed as bycatch from fisheries, where they become entangled in fixed netting and drown or starve. Increased ocean traffic causes collisions between fast ocean vessels and large marine mammals. Habitat degradation also threatens marine mammals and their ability to find and catch food. Noise pollution, for example, may adversely affect echolocating mammals, and the ongoing <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>global</b> warming degrade arctic environments.|$|E
5|$|The <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>global</b> {{climate change}} are another element of concern. The extent and {{thickness}} of the pack ice has reached unusually low levels in several recent years. The walrus relies on this ice while giving birth and aggregating in the reproductive period. Thinner pack ice over the Bering Sea has reduced the amount of resting habitat near optimal feeding grounds. This more widely separates lactating females from their calves, increasing nutritional stress for the young and lower reproductive rates. Reduced coastal sea ice has also been implicated in the increase of stampeding deaths crowding the shorelines of the Chukchi Sea between eastern Russia and western Alaska. However, there are insufficient climate data to make reliable predictions on population trends.|$|E
