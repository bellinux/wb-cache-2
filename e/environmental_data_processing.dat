This study compares volunteer and paid processing of social media data originating from climate change discussions on Twitter. The same sample of Twitter messages discussing climate change was offered for processing to the volunteer workers through the Climate Tweet project, and to the paid workers through the Amazon MTurk platform. We found that paid crowdsourcing required the employment of a high redundancy data processing design to obtain quality that was comparable with volunteered processing. Among the methods applied to improve data processing accuracy, limiting the geographical locations of the paid workers appeared the most productive.

40|$|Seasonally managed {{wetlands}} in the Grasslands Basin of California's San Joaquin Valley {{provide food}} and shelter for migratory wildfowl during winter months and sport for waterfowl hunters during the annual duck season. Surface water supply to these wetland contain salt which, when drained to the San Joaquin River during the annual drawdown period, negatively impacts downstream agricultural riparian water diverters. Recent environmental regulation, limiting discharges salinity to the San Joaquin River and primarily targeting agricultural non-point sources, now addresses return flows from seasonally managed wetlands. Real-time water quality management has been advocated {{as a means of}} matching wetland return flows to the assimilative capacity of the San Joaquin River. Past attempts to build environmental monitoring and decision support systems to implement this concept have failed for reasons that are discussed in this paper. These reasons are discussed in the context of more general challenges facing the successful implementation of environmental monitoring, modelling and decision support systems. The paper then provides details of a current research and development project which will ultimately provide wetland managers with the means of matching salt exports with the available assimilative capacity of the San Joaquin River, when fully implemented. Manipulation of the traditional wetland drawdown comes at a potential cost to the sustainability of optimal wetland moist soil plant habitat in these wetlands - hence the project provides appropriate data and a feedback and response mechanism for wetland managers to balance improvements to San Joaquin River quality with internally-generated information on the health of the wetland resource. The author concludes the paper by arguing that the architecture of the current project decision support system, when coupled with recent advances in <b>environmental</b> <b>data</b> acquisition, <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> and information dissemination technology, holds significant promise to address some of the problems described earlier in the paper that have limited past efforts to improve Basin water quality management...|$|R

Since WSN protocols are application specific, the focus {{has been given to}} the routing protocols that might differ depending on the application and network architecture. In this work, novel routing protocols have been proposed which is a cluster-based security protocol is named as Efficient and Secure Routing Protocol (ESRP) for WSN. The goal of ESRP is to provide an energy efficient routing solution with dynamic security features for clustered WSN. During the network formation, a node which is connected to a Personal Computer (PC) has been selected as a sink node. Once the sensor nodes were deployed, the sink node logically segregates the other nodes in a cluster structure and subsequently creates a WSN. This centralized cluster formation method is used to reduce the node level processing burden and avoid multiple communications. In order to ensure reliable data delivery, various security features have been incorporated in the proposed protocol such as Modified Zero-Knowledge Protocol (MZKP), Promiscuous hearing method, Trapping of adversaries and Mine detection. One of the unique features of this ESRP is that it can dynamically decide about the selection of these security methods, based on the residual energy of nodes. Comment: 183 Pages, 52 Figur...|$|R

Here we conducted a weekly to bi-weekly monitoring program on five shallow eutrophic lakes during two years, with the aim of gathering data on total cyanobacterial abundance, as estimated from marker pigments determined by HPLC analysis of phytoplankton extracts. We also determined bloom composition and measured weather and limnological variables. The most frequently identified taxa were Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, Microcystis aeruginosa, Planktothrix agardhii and Anabaena spp. We used the data base composed of a total of 306 observations and an adaptive regression trees method, the boosted regression tree (BRT), to develop predictive models of bloom occurrence and composition, based on <b>environmental</b> conditions. <b>Data</b> <b>processing</b> with BRT enabled the design of satisfactory prediction models of cyanobacterial abundance and of the occurrence of the main taxa.

The proposed scheme Efficient and Secure Routing Protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks through SNR based dynamic Clustering mechanisms (ESRPSDC) can partition the nodes into clusters and select the Cluster Head (CH) among the nodes based on the energy and Non Cluster Head (NCH) nodes join with a specific CH based on SNR Values.
