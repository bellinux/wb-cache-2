The targets of investigations were: Determination of hydraulic conditions in the packed bed, mass balance, reaction on stress loading, analytical identification of rest-COD. Following test methods were used: pressure loss-, tracer- and hold-up measurements, determination of biomass, TOC-, adsorption- and off-gas measurements, GC and MS analytic. Results: Mixing of waterphase is dependent on both water and air velocity and number of corresponding jets. The optimum distribution over the packed bed {{was found to be}} at a velocity of 3 m/h for water and 15 m/h for air. Based on results of these investigations the air/water distribution Tray should be modified in future design of packed bed reactors. Furfural and phenol were first adsorbed from the biofilm and then degraded. Low boiling solvents and hydrocarbons are mainly stipped out with air. The biomass is quickly adapted to stress loading, however, extremely high loads caused anaerobic areas in the reactor. Paraffinic hydrocarbons were significantly faster degraded than aromatic hydrocarbons.

40|$|A new {{application}} of polymer–surfactant aggregates {{has been developed}} to remove dilute metallic anions, such as CrO 4 2  − and Fe(CN) 6 3  −, from aqueous solutions. This process uses anionic polymers, such as poly(sodium 4 -styrenesulfonate) (PSS) or poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), as a back-bone structure onto which cationic surfactants, such as myristyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (MTAB), form micelle-like aggregates. The resulting structures, called polymer–surfactant aggregates (PSAs), {{have the ability to}} remove anions from solutions, and to form larger flocculated aggregates through a process of intermolecular association. The flocculated aggregates can then be separated out from the solution through a settling or coarse filtration step. In the work presented here, the results show that 99 % of 0. 1  mM Fe(CN) 6 3  − and 80 % of 0. 2  mM CrO 4 2  − can be removed at optimum dosages. The change in conductivity with the change in surfactant concentration is plotted to reveal changes {{in the state of the}} system, and to detect the point of formation of the PSAs. The results indicate that the PSAs, which form at surfactant concentrations well below the critical micellar concentration, are responsible for removing the metallic anions. This process is effective for metallic anion removal over a pH range from 4. 5 to 6 and a temperature range from 5 to 50  °C. Furthermore, both salt and organic contaminants do not significantly interfere with the anion removal efficiency. Such a PSA process thus has potential applications for the efficient removal of dilute anions, and metallic anions in particular, during process <b>effluent</b> <b>water</b> <b>treatment...</b>|$|E

40|$|Dilute {{metallic}} ion treatment (< 10 mg/L) {{remains a}} challenge in water purification and resource recovery. A novel and inexpensive treatment process that employs polymerâsurfactant aggregates (PSAs) has been developed and applied to remove and recover dilute metallic ions, such as Cr 3 +, Rh 3 +, Cd 2 +, Fe(CN) 6 3 - and CrO 4 2 -, from industrial process and effluent. At {{the heart of this}} process is a material that comprises a colloidal structure of polymers and surfactants, named a polymerâsurfactant aggregate (PSA), that trap metallic ions. The ion loaded PSAs then coalesce and settle out. The flocs are then treated separately by acid-base wash to recover the ions in a concentrated salt and regenerate the polymer and surfactant. The regenerated polymer and surfactant can then be recycled without a deterioration of removal ability in the next cycle. This process is simple, uses low energy, and generates little material loss or discharge. The thesis is divided into three main parts: fundamentals, cation treatment and anion treatment. First, the mechanism of formation of PSAs and their interactions with metallic ions are investigated using surface tension and electrical conductivity measurements. Both measurements reveal that the PSA is formed by surfactant monomers binding to the oppositely charged polymer chains and forming micelleâlike aggregates via hydrophobic and electrostatic forces. These aggregates, like micelles, can bind to the oppositely charged metallic ions, but the surfactant concentration required is a few orders of magnitude lower than that required for micelle formation. The resulting nano-size PSA has a large surface area to volume ratio, and can effectively treat dilute aqueous streams. Each PSA consists of positive and negative charges. Within a near charge neutralisation range, they can quickly self-flocculate to simultaneously remove metallic ions and settle the flocs out of aqueous solutions. Correlating the removal efficiency of ions with surface tension and electrical conductivity measurements, the results suggest that the PSA is indeed responsible for removing the ions from the streams. Based on the fundamentals, a PSA process consisting of three stages (removal, recovery and recycle) is developed to treat metal cations in dilute streams. At the removal stage, polymer and surfactant (i. e. removal agent) are used to form PSAs and trap 99 % of 0. 1 mM metal ions into flocs. At the recovery stage, a small amount of acid solution is added to leach out 95 % of the trapped metal ions into a concentrated salt, and then using a base solution to completely dissolve and regenerate the removal agent. After that, the removal agent are recycled in the next cycle without the need for any make-up, and little deterioration of removal ability is found. The same three-stage process is also applied to recover dilute metallic anions. As the targeted ions are negatively charged, the charge of polymer and surfactant used and the order of acid-base wash are reversed as compared with the cation treatment process. The PSA process is robust under different conditions, e. g. pH, temperature, salinity and organic contaminants. Such a sustainable process thus has potential applications for the efficient removal and recovery of dilute metallic ions during process <b>effluent</b> <b>water</b> <b>treatment.</b> </p...|$|E

Various methods and processes available for mine <b>water</b> <b>treatment</b> are presented in this chapter, along with an example for using a membrane separation process for mine <b>water</b> <b>treatment.</b> Next, vacuum membrane distillation (VMD) as a thermally driven separation process for separation of a gaseous phase from the entry liquid is described. <b>Treatment</b> of mine <b>water</b> and <b>effluent</b> <b>water</b> using a VMD technology is also evaluated, and <b>effluent</b> <b>water</b> quality is presented. Finally, a sustainability assessment of the proposed treatment technology and its associated technical issues are assessed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Effectiveness of {{drinking}} <b>water</b> <b>treatment,</b> in particular pathogen control during the <b>water</b> <b>treatment</b> process, {{is always a}} major public health concern. In this investigation, the application of PCR-DGGE technology {{to the analysis of}} microbial community structures and dynamics in the drinking <b>water</b> <b>treatment</b> process revealed several dominant microbial populations including: α-Proteobacteria, β-Proteobacteria, γ-Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria Firmicutes and Cyanobacteria. α-Proteobacteria and β-Proteobacteria were the dominant bacteria during the whole process. Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were the dominant bacteria before and after treatment, respectively. Firmicutes showed season-dependent changes in population dynamics. Importantly, γ-Proteobacteria, which is a class of medically important bacteria, was well controlled by the O 3 /biological activated carbon (BAC) treatment, resulting in improved <b>effluent</b> <b>water</b> bio-safety...|$|R
40|$|Currently in Sri Lanka, {{coconut water}} is a waste from Desiccated Coconut (DC) {{industry}} apart from the small quantity used to produce beverage and vinegar. BOD and COD value of coconut water {{were found to be}} 13, 000 - 15, 000 mg/l and 40, 000 mg/l respectively while the <b>effluent</b> <b>water</b> contains 6000 - 10, 000 mg/l and 17, 000 - 20, 000 mg/l respectively [3]. A local DC factory processes around 30, 000 - 50, 000 coconuts per day. It is mandatory to treat the <b>effluent</b> <b>water</b> in a waste <b>water</b> <b>treatment</b> plant {{in order to meet the}} water discharge standards. Value addition is obviously an important and worthwhile option for waste coconut water from the DC mills. Senate Research Gran...|$|R
40|$|A {{sophisticated}} {{water quality}} monitoring program {{was established to}} evaluate virus removal through Denver's 1 -million-gal (ca. 4 -million-liter) /day Direct Potable Reuse Demonstration Plant. As a comparison point for the reuse demonstration plant, Denver's main <b>water</b> <b>treatment</b> facility was also monitored for coliphage organisms. Through the routine monitoring of the main plant, {{it was discovered that}} coliphage organisms were escaping the <b>water</b> <b>treatment</b> processes. Monochloramine residuals and contact times (CT values) required to achieve 99 % inactivation were determined for coliphage organisms entering and leaving this conventional <b>water</b> <b>treatment</b> plant. The coliphage tested in the <b>effluent</b> <b>waters</b> had higher CT values on the average than those of the influent waters. CT values established for some of these coliphages suggest that monochloramine alone is not capable of removing 2 orders of magnitude of these specific organisms in a typical <b>water</b> <b>treatment</b> facility. Electron micrographs revealed one distinct type of phage capable of escaping the <b>water</b> <b>treatment</b> processes and three distinct types of phages in all...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{presence}} of human pharmaceutical compounds in surface waters is an emerging issue in environmental science. Low levels of many active pharmaceutical ingredients are {{detected in the}} aquatic environment {{as a result of}} pharmaco-chemical industrial waste spill-offs in draining water. In the manufacturing of pharmaceutical drug substances azides are used as reagents or when they are generated somehow in the synthesis, {{it may be necessary to}} demonstrate that these impurities are sufficiently removed to levels below an appropriate safety threshold. Sodium azide is an example of an azide for which the environmental exposure limits have been reasonably well characterized. The treatment of waste and industrial water can be conducted by removing dissolved materials and ions in water using membrane separation technology with ultra- and nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. To achieve better <b>effluent</b> <b>water</b> quality, tertiary <b>treatment</b> with activated carbon adsorption is used. To analyze the risk of pharmaceuticals in the environment, a proposed validated methodology by NMR spectroscopy will support the evaluation of the eco-toxicological hazards during the early development process of pharmaceuticals...|$|R
