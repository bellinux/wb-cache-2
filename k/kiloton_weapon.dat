2500|$|Although this variant {{matched the}} {{original}} Improved <b>Kiloton</b> <b>Weapon</b> concept with an added nuclear depth bomb function, and {{was identified as}} the A model, {{it was not the}} first to be deployed, due to the more pressing needs for the strategic B models. [...] At least forty-three were deployed aboard Royal Navy surface vessels of frigate size and larger; for use by embarked helicopters and Ikara systems (where fitted) as an anti-submarine nuclear depth bomb, starting in 1971. [...] Ikara performed a similar function to the U.S. Navy's ASROC missile, which could also carry a nuclear warhead. [...] The addition of a nuclear option to Ikara was intended to significantly improve its kill probability, while providing the escort commander with an instant-response, all-weather, all-conditions weapon to deploy against time-urgent targets. [...] Helicopter-delivered nuclear depth bombs were not always immediately available, due to fuel-state, other taskings, or expended weapons load.|$|E
50|$|The basic plan is {{to provide}} a {{structure}} that is very strong in compression. The actual strength specification must be done individually, based on the nature and probability of the threat. A typical specification for heavy civil defence shelter in Europe during the Cold war was an overhead explosion of a 500 <b>kiloton</b> <b>weapon</b> at the height of 500 meters. Such a weapon would be used to attack soft targets (factories, administrative centres, communications) in the area.|$|E
50|$|The first openly {{reported}} {{observation of}} the unique aspects of high-altitude nuclear EMP occurred during the helium balloon lofted Yucca nuclear test of the Hardtack I series on 28 April 1958. In that test, the electric field measurements from the 1.7 <b>kiloton</b> <b>weapon</b> went off {{the scale of the}} test instruments and was estimated to be about 5 times the oscilloscope limits. The Yucca EMP was initially positive-going whereas low-altitude bursts were negative pulses. Also, the polarization of the Yucca EMP signal was horizontal, whereas low-altitude nuclear EMP was vertically polarized. In spite of these many differences, the unique EMP results were dismissed as a possible wave propagation anomaly.|$|E
5000|$|One {{month after}} the September 11, 2001 attacks, a CIA {{informant}} known as [...] "Dragonfire" [...] reported that al-Qaeda had smuggled a low-yield nuclear weapon into New York City. Although the report {{was found to be}} false, concerns were expressed that a [...] "fizzle bomb" [...] capable of yielding a fraction of the known 10 <b>kiloton</b> <b>weapons</b> could cause “horrific” consequences. A detonation in New York City would mean thousands of civilian casualties.|$|R
5000|$|In 2006, U.S. Joint Forces Command {{explored}} the Department of Homeland Security’s scenario for an unaccounted for, [...] "loose," [...] 10 <b>kiloton</b> nuclear <b>weapon.</b> A number of research questions for further experimentation and resolution were identified.|$|R

50|$|The EMP {{at a fixed}} {{distance}} from an explosion increases at most as the square root of the yield (see the illustration to the right). This means that although a 10 <b>kiloton</b> <b>weapon</b> has only 0.7% of the energy release of the 1.44-megaton Starfish Prime test, the EMP {{will be at least}} 8% as powerful. Since the E1 component of nuclear EMP depends on the prompt gamma ray output, which was only 0.1% of yield in Starfish Prime but can be 0.5% of yield in low yield pure nuclear fission weapons, a 10 kiloton bomb can easily be 5 x 8% = 40% as powerful as the 1.44 megaton Starfish Prime at producing EMP.|$|E

500|$|The Air Council {{decided on}} 7 July 1960 that Project E weapons would {{be phased out}} by December 1962, by which time it was {{anticipated}} {{that there would be}} sufficient British megaton weapons to equip the entire strategic bomber force. [...] Project E weapons were replaced by British Yellow Sun bombs at RAF Honington on 1 July 1961 and Waddington on 30 March 1962. Problems encountered in the development Red Beard bomb meant that the replacement of <b>kiloton</b> <b>weapons</b> took longer. The UK-based Valiants at Honington and Wittering were withdrawn in April and October 1962, and the last Valiants were retired from the V-bomber force in July 1965. The final practice loading at RAF Marham—with the Mark 43s—was in January 1965, and the last US personnel left the base in July.|$|R
50|$|The Mark 18 nuclear bomb, {{also known}} as the SOB or Super Oralloy Bomb, was an American nuclear bomb design which was the highest yield fission bomb {{produced}} by the US. The Mark 18 had a design yield of 500 <b>kilotons.</b> Noted nuclear <b>weapon</b> designer Ted Taylor was the lead designer for the Mark 18.|$|R
