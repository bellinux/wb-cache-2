Here, we study the behavior of an electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) at the integer quantum Hall effect (IQHE) regime at <b>filling</b> <b>factors</b> greater than one. Both the visibility and the drift velocity were measured, and {{were found to be}} highly correlated as function of <b>filling</b> <b>factor.</b> As the <b>filling</b> <b>factor</b> approached unity, the visibility quenched, not to recover for <b>filling</b> <b>factors</b> smaller than unity. Alternatively, the velocity saturated around a minimal value at unity <b>filling</b> <b>factor.</b> We highlight the significant role interactions between the interfering edge and the bulk play, {{as well as that of}} the defining potential at the edge. Shot noise measurements suggest that phase-averaging (due to phase randomization), rather than single particle decoherence, is likely to be the cause of the dephasing in the fractional regime.

25|$|Given their vertical-cavity geometry, VCSOAs are {{resonant}} cavity optical amplifiers that operate with the input/output signal entering/exiting normal to the wafer surface.

These devices are still {{in the early stages of}} research, though promising preamplifier results have been demonstrated. Further extensions to VCSOA technology are the demonstration of wavelength tunable devices. These MEMS-tunable vertical-cavity SOAs utilize a microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) based tuning mechanism for wide and continuous tuning of the peak gain wavelength of the amplifier. SOAs have a more rapid gain response, which is in the order of 1 to 100 ps.|$|E
