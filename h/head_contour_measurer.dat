40|$|Elementary {{geometrical}} shape (EGS) {{models are}} useful in radiostereometric analysis (RSA) on hip stems because tantalum markers attached to the stems can be omitted. In order to create an EGS model of a femoral stem, {{the center of the}} femoral head has to be identified. The contour of the femoral head is recommended to be used. However, the contour of the femoral head cannot be detected exclusively by computer if it is combined with a bipolar head or a metal cup. We therefore hypothesized that the contour of the outer head of bipolar hemiarthroplasty can be included in the EGS model as well as the femoral <b>head</b> <b>contour.</b> We calculated the time required for the detection of the contour, the precision of analysis and the stem micromotion at 2 years using the two different methods in the same picture set and compared the results. The detection of the bipolar <b>head</b> <b>contour</b> was 10 times faster than that of the femoral <b>head</b> <b>contour.</b> The precision for subsidence was 0. 16 mm in EGS RSA with the femoral <b>head</b> <b>contour,</b> and 0. 15 mm with the bipolar <b>head</b> <b>contour</b> (p= 0. 68). The precisions were comparable and clinically acceptable. There {{was no significant difference between}} the results of the 2 -year micromotion with the two different methods. We conclude that this new method is applicable to measure stem micromotion of hemi-arthoplasty with EGS RSA and the method facilitates the Radiostereometric analysis...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Navigated and {{robotized}} Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is advancing {{forward in}} research and treatment. MRI-scans or other medical image data are typically used as navigation source. Unfortunately, scanning time is always short and expensive. For many TMSapplications the underlying brain topology is not necessarily needed. Therefore, we generate the subject’s <b>head</b> <b>contour</b> for a precise stimulation from 3 D laser scans. We use the PowerCrust algorithm generating a smooth contour from laser surface points. The mean error found was 0. 289 with an RMS error of 0. 358 mm and a maximum error of 0. 984 mm comparing MRI-scan to laser scan for a head phantom. Currently, we are working successfully with <b>head</b> <b>contours</b> based on 3 D laser scans for two ongoing TMS studies. During these TMS-experiments, the overall error found for the robotized TMS system using laser scans was < 5 mm. With new and faster laser technologies, {{it will be possible}} to use laser scans as navigation source and for direct head tracking during stimulation when scanner become real time capable. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the ability of}} young infants (3 - and 4 -month-olds) to detect faces in the two-tone images {{often referred to as}} Mooney faces. In Experiment 1, this performance was examined in conditions of high and low visibility of local features and with either {{the presence or absence of}} the outer <b>head</b> <b>contour.</b> We found that regardless of the presence of the outer <b>head</b> <b>contour,</b> infants preferred upright over inverted two-tone face images only when local features were highly visible (Experiment 1 a). We showed that this upright preference disappeared when the contrast polarity of twotone images was reversed (Experiment 1 b), reflecting operation of face-specific mechanisms. In Experiment 2, we investigated whether motion affects infants’ perception of faces in Mooney faces. We found that when the faces appeared to be rigidly moving, infants did show an upright preference in conditions of low visibility of local features (Experiment 2 a). Again the preference disappeared when the contrast polarity of the image was reversed (Experiment 2 b). Together, these results suggest that young infants have the ability to integrate fragmented image features to perceive faces from two-tone face images, especially if they are moving. This suggests that an interaction between motion and form rather than a purely motion-based process (e. g., structure from motion) facilitates infants’ perception of faces in ambiguous two-tone images...|$|R

The method consists of several steps. First, a non-linear diffusion technique is utilized {{to reduce the}} speckle noise. Then, {{based on the assumption}} that cross sectional intensity profiles of skull and femur can be approximated by Gaussian-like curves, a multi-scale and multi-orientation filter bank is designed to extract texton features specific to ultrasound fetal anatomic structure. The extracted texton cues, together with multi-scale local brightness, are then built into a unified framework for boundary detection of ultrasound fetal head and femur. Finally, for fetal head, a direct least square ellipse fitting method is used to construct a closed <b>head</b> <b>contour,</b> whilst, for fetal femur a closed contour is produced by connecting the detected femur boundaries.

Vanathavillu is situated about 18 km, north of Puttalam covering an area of about 80 km 2. It {{is considered to be}} an isolated basin with the boundaries in the north at Kalaoya delta and the other boundaries being impermeable due to faults on the west and the south and an outcrop of basement in the east. The basin consists of two main water bearing strata namely, the upper Moongil Aru formation of quaternary age and a lower Limestone aquifer of Miocene age.

The aquifer parameters and hydrological factors such as recharge and abstraction have been estimated with some degree of uncertainty.

40|$|The {{creation}} of a contour map of the water table in an unconfined aquifer based on head measurements is often {{the first step in}} any hydrogeological study. Geostatistical interpolation methods (e. g. kriging) may provide exact interpolated groundwater levels at the measurement locations, but often fail to represent the hydrogeological flow system. A physically based, numerical groundwater model with spatially variable parameters and inputs is more adequate in representing a flow system. Due to the difficulty in parameterization and solving the inverse problem however, an often considerable difference between calculated and observed heads will remain. In this study the water table interpolation methodology presented by Fasbender et al. (2008), in which the results of a kriging interpolation are combined with information from a drainage network and a Digital Elevation Model (DEM), using the Bayesian Data Fusion framework (Bogaert and Fasbender, 2007), is extended to incorporate information from a tuned analytic element groundwater model. The resulting interpolation is exact at the measurement locations while the shape of the <b>head</b> <b>contours</b> is in accordance with the conceptual information incorporated in the groundwater flow model. The Bayesian Data Fusion methodology is applied to a regional, unconfined aquifer in Central Belgium.
