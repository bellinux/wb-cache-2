Now, you have no claim--special claim, I mean--but for all this, I believe, as I have told you before, that you are the man she ought to marry, and I have been doing everything I can to make her cease considering them, and to consider you. And this is the way she came to give me her reasons for not considering you at all. Now the state of the case is plain before you." ...|$|E

He {{believed}} we could trust Burke to join us, and, with my four black men,--who have really become good sailors,--we would have a crew of seven men altogether, with which we could work a fair-sized brig to Havre or some other French port. Before he went away our business was settled. He agreed to go with me as first mate, to do his best to help me get that gold to France, to consider the whole treasure as mine, because I had discovered it,--I explained the reason to him, as I did to you,--and to accept as regular pay one hundred dollars a day, from then until we should land the cargo in a European port, and then to leave it to me how much more I would give him. I told him {{there were a lot of}} people to be considered, and I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the division as fair as possible, and he said he was willing to trust it to me.|$|E

50|$|On Sunday, January 10, 1954, Thomas Elmer Braniff {{was killed}} in a private plane crash in Louisiana. Tom Braniff along with nine other noted {{businessmen}} from Texas and Louisiana, were on a duck hunting trip sponsored by United Gas Company. The duck hunting trip was conducted near Grand Chernier, Louisiana. The group was traveling aboard a Grumman Mallard twin engine aircraft and encountered severe icing while the return trip home from Grand Chernier.

5000|$|In 2010, the Chapel Hill Public Library was {{initially}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a permanent {{move into the}} mall, taking over Dillard's space, but Dillard's decided to remain in their location and the town rejected the idea of moving the library there, so the library will move into inline space in the mall instead temporarily while an expansion is completed on the current library. The Kidzu Children's Museum will be moving from University Square, on Franklin Street, to the mall in 2013, taking {{the space of the}} Chapel Hill Library. In addition to Kidzu Children's Museum, William Travis Jewelry, Fine Feathers, Peacock Alley (these three moving into different pieces of a former Kerr Drug that had moved out of the mall in 2010) and Glee Kids are all moving from University Square to the mall in 2013.

5000|$|The reason I {{originally}} {{wrote it}} is obviously because I was bitter. The demos were almost all thematically interchangeable with one another. They are all kind of bitter and about a guy {{falling in love with}} a prostitute and stuff. When people call those demos an album, I just think it is a little ridiculous, because if I was to release that, I would be ashamed of myself. There is nothing to it - it's just one subject. I went through something with a girl, and like most immature artist people, you write about it and complain a lot...And that is why I didn't want anyone to hear those (songs from the demo)...I think I did what any writer does - they include themselves in their work to an extent as much as they can, since that is your only real link to humanity - what you experience. So if I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> anything realistic, all I have to go on is what I learned on my own...It is more that every character is a collection of experiences and feelings I have had about people in the past.|$|E
50|$|Lawrence then blackmailed Jennifer into marrying him by {{revealing}} that her former boyfriend, and Carlys younger brother, Frankie Brady, was his prisoner. Lawrence knew she wasnt Katerina (he himself {{had had an}} affair with Katerina years ago) but all he wants is the VL fortune. Jack, who had traveled to Europe with Jennifer and others, is imprisoned the day of the wedding, and was unable to meet with Jennifer as planned near the elevator in Lawrences bedroom. Instead, Lawrence shows up, things got out of control and he raped her. Jack escaped his prison a little too late, and tried to get Jennifer to leave. Traumatized by the rape, and unable to tell him about it because of his own past, she coldly told him she was married and was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it work. Help arrived in the form of Shane, Bo, Carly, Kayla and Julie, who are all trying to either gather evidence about Steves death, or rescue Jennifer and her Gran, Alice Horton, from Lawrences grasp. With her friends and family as support, and an impassioned plea from Jack for her to declare who she really was and who she really loved, he finally convinced her to escape with them.|$|E
5000|$|Shields {{has been}} outspoken about the {{corporate}} {{influence in the}} music industry. He has said that Sony Music Entertainment, upon inheriting My Bloody Valentine from Creation Records, deliberately hid the master tapes of the band's original recordings {{in an attempt to}} delay the release of EP's 1988-1991 (2012). Shields threatened to involve Scotland Yard in the dispute and then said the tapes [...] "magically, suddenly reappeared." [...] He has since called for reorganisation of the record industry, which he has referred to as [...] "sociopathic". As a result, My Bloody Valentine's third album, m b v (2013), was an independent-self release. Reflecting on his decision, Shields said it was [...] "great to release the record without any industry interaction at all, but it also meant that it was a bit too expensive to buy, so we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it cheaper by working with various record companies in the future", though ruling out agreements with major labels. In 2013, following the release of m b v, he accused the organisers of the Mercury Prize of [...] "banning" [...] the album for the nominated shortlist. In an interview with The Guardian, Shields said My Bloody Valentine were [...] "banned by Mercury Prize" [...] due to not having a major digital distribution deal in the United Kingdom. He added [...] "because we're not on Amazon or iTunes ... it's not a real record. Our album's not a real album because it's independent. The corporateness has got to such a point where we've essentially been told that we don't exist." ...|$|E

Miller stated [...] "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> stay in the background and ask questions a fan would ask.
