30|$|Preserved core {{samples were}} {{immersed}} in different fluid mixtures of varying compositions at 60  °C. The samples were sealed {{and left in}} the fluid for 5  days for inert shale and 2  days for reactive shale. The change in weight of the shale samples {{before and after the}} test, linear swelling, and the change of hardness were measured. SEM images of the samples were taken after exposure to characterize morphologic changes on the shale surface. The change in thickness of shale samples used in study was measured before and after the <b>immersion</b> <b>tests</b> using a Vernier caliper. This provides a qualitative measurement of the extent of sample expansion or shrinkage when in contact with the injected fluids. Additionally, change in weight of the shale samples was measured after <b>immersion</b> <b>tests.</b> The results were correlated with the linear swelling test results. In order to study the isolated effect of salt and polyacrylamides separately, <b>immersion</b> <b>tests</b> were performed with salts, polyacrylamides, and no additives.|$|R
40|$|Wind {{turbine blades}} are {{complicated}} objects for inspection {{because they have}} a curved surface, are multi-layered, have variable thickness and are made from anisotropic materials. Ultrasonic contact pulse-echo <b>immersion</b> <b>testing</b> with moving water container has been selected for inspection of wind turbine blades, because this type of the inspection can be performed having access just from the one side of the wind turbine blade. The ultrasonic contact pulse-echo <b>immersion</b> <b>testing</b> technique with two types of ultrasonic transducers mounted into a moving water container was used for investigation of the artificial internal defects in a wind turbine blade. These defects (diameter 81 mm, 49 mm and 19 mm) were made on the internal side of the main spar. The contact pulse-echo <b>immersion</b> <b>testing</b> (using a moving water container) of the wind turbine blade was performed using two different transducers: focused 2. 2 MHz and planar 400 kHz.

5000|$|Other {{measures}} {{can also be}} obtained from the cold pressor such as pain threshold and pain tolerance. [...] This is done by requiring a participant to place their hand in the cold pressor {{for as long as they}} can. Once pain is present, they let the researcher know. Once the pain is unbearable, the participant removes his/her hand. This provides a measure of threshold (first feeling pain) and tolerance (total time minus threshold). This method is the most frequently used application of the cold pressor task. Comparable in terms of pain elicitation is the hot water <b>immersion</b> <b>test,</b> the equivalent to the cold pressor using hot water. The hot water <b>immersion</b> <b>test</b> (HIT) is equally capable of triggering a pain response without the confounding of baroreflex activation.|$|E

Conventional SAFT is well suited for contact testing of homogeneous objects because of the constant sound speed throughout the media, whereas the refraction present in the practically important case of <b>immersion</b> <b>tests</b> has so far prevented a widespread use of SAFT for such data.
