This policy states the general procedures to ensure that an accurate and up-todate PMT is in place prior to recruitment efforts. Policy The supervisor will create or update a PMT for review and approval by the Division of Human Resources. The PMT will set out a <b>job</b> <b>summary,</b> duties and responsibilities, competencies and qualifications (i. e., education, experience, knowledge, skills and abilities) necessary to perform the essential functions of the position. Procedure Basic Responsibilities and Requirements. Whenever a job vacancy occurs, the hiring manager should review and, if necessary due to changes in duties, activities, or requirements, revise an existing PMT or prepare a new PMT, if one does not exist. Additionally, as part of Rensselaer’s ongoing process, the Division of Human Resources periodically can request a manager’s assistance in reviewing their department’s or unit’s PMTs {{to ensure that they}} are accurate, complete, and up-to-date. The Division of Human Resources is available to assist managers in preparing and reviewing PMTs or carrying out these periodic reviews. Whenever possible, the reviewing manager or Division of Human Resources should seek the input of a position’s incumbent in reviewing the PMT’s accuracy and completeness. The Division of Human Resources is responsible for reviewing and approving all new and revised PMTs. Identification of Essential Functions. When preparing or reviewing a PMT, the hiring manager should identify all of the position’s essential functions. In identifying a position’s essential functions, it is important to focus on both the purpose of the position and the importance or significance of a particular function in achieving that purpose. No function should be listed as essential if incumbent employees do not perform the function either as a regular part of the job or an occasional, critical-need basis. If doubt exists {{as to whether or not}} a function is essential, the Division of Human Resources is responsible for advising and assisting the manager and making any final determination as to the essential nature of a particular function...|$|E

Methods: Studies identified from a MEDLINE search through 15 January 2013 and from the reference lists of identified publications were submitted to a systematic review and meta-analysis. Relative risk estimates were extracted from 20 studies published between 1974 and 2010. Most of the retrieved studies involved farm/agricultural <b>jobs.</b> <b>Summary</b> ratio estimates (SR) were calculated according to fixed and random-effect meta-analysis models. Separate analyses were conducted after stratification for study design, exposure parameters, disease definition, geographic location and age at diagnosis. Results: Statistically significant associations were observed for parents potentially exposed to pesticides in occupational settings and the occurrence of brain tumor in their offspring after combining all case-control studies (summary odds ratio [SOR]: 1. 30; 95 %: 1. 11, 1. 53) or all cohort studies (summary rate ratio [SRR]: 1. 53; 95 % CI: 1. 20, 1. 95). Significantly increased risks were seen for prenatal exposure windows, for either exposed parent, for exposure defined as to pesticides {{as well as by}} occupational/industry title, for astroglial brain tumors and after combining case-control studies from North America or cohort studies from Europe. Conclusions: This meta-analysis supports an association between parental occupational exposure to pesticides and brain tumors in children and young adults, and adds to the evidence leading to the recommendation of minimizing (parental) occupational exposure to pesticides. These results must, however, be interpreted with caution because the impact of work-related factors others than pesticide exposure is not known. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

Firms with intangible assets now take advantage of transfer pricing laws to maximize profits without making the investments that would create sustainable growth in Puerto Rico. The fundamental questions then are: First, can the long record of disappointment be ended? Second, can the legislation provided in the 1993 budget transform section 936 into an instrument of public benefit, rather than of private profit? We conclude that the costs of section 936 will continue to outweigh its benefits. Puerto Rico, investment incentives, private, not public benefits...|$|R

A {{better understanding of the}} most suitable platforms which can efficiently run these computations is needed. In this thesis, we attempt to compare four such big data platforms, namely Hadoop, Spark, GPU, and Multicore CPU. We compare these platforms using two prominent data mining algorithms, namely, K-means clustering and K-nearest neighbour classification and discuss specific implementation-level details. We provide several insights into the best possible implementations of these algorithms and systematically compare the benefits and drawbacks of each of these platforms. We conduct experiments by varying data size and parameters to obtain runtime and scalability performances of these platforms. Our experiments show that GPU and Multicore CPU are faster but have certain limitations. On the other hand, Hadoop and Spark are able to handle large scale datasets. We also observe that Spark performs better than Hadoop for both iterative and non-iterative <b>jobs.</b> In <b>summary,</b> we have examined different characteristics of four big data platforms and provided comparative analysis for the cases of two algorithms.

40|$|The thesis {{focuses on}} labour market flexibility, {{security}} and complexity. The research {{is divided into}} three chapters: two of the chapters specifically relate to perceived security, flexibility and job satisfaction, using data from the longitudinal Swiss Household Panel (SHP), while the last investigates labour market programs and their impact on a regional labour market. The first essay analyses perceptions of economic insecurity in Switzerland, during the business cycle between 2008 and 2011. The analysis contributes to depict perceptions of Swiss workers; results show that perceptions of job security tend to be higher among workers with supervisory responsibilities, among permanent workers and among workers who live in regions that are not adversely affected by economic conditions. The second essay focuses on the determinants of perceived <b>job</b> satisfaction, a <b>summary</b> measure reflecting how workers value various job characteristics, paying specific attention to the role of perceived security and temporary contracts. Results indicate that the duration of the contract may be less important if the worker perceives that he is not at risk of unemployment: job stability and perceived security are nonetheless valued in different ways and the lack of job security is a primary source of job dissatisfaction. No significant differences emerge on the estimated effect by gender, while some heterogeneity is evident by age and education. Finally, the third paper, that follows (ACE) models approach, highlights a mechanism of the job search in a regional labour market characterized by a complex environment where firms, worker agents and policies interact in a systemic way. The model allows to approximate quite a number of stylized features of the southern Swiss regional labour market...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{collaborative work}} practices within a large international {{oil and gas}} company (OGC). The work is founded on {{the introduction of a}} new standardised and integrated collaboration infrastructure based on Microsoft SharePoint technology, which was intended to improve knowledge sharing across both disciplinary and geographical boundaries within the company and with external partners. Using a longitudinal case study, the thesis investigates how the introduction of this new solution has been received in different organisational contexts. The work is inspired by social studies of information systems (IS) and seeks to explain the role of the new collaboration infrastructure in an enterprise context with actors and stakeholders that have different interests, experiences and expectations. The focus of the thesis was to investigate how the collaboration infrastructure has been received and has {{become an integral part of}} the users’ daily work. Previous research has shown that the introduction of different information systems does not adequately account for local, established practices and thus results in systems that are not used optimally. In many cases, users have to establish informal practices to work around the limitations of the system. In this research, we investigate this potential divergence between the intended and actual usage of these large information systems. Based on our empirical findings, we argue that in knowledge-intensive, interdisciplinary work such as oil and gas production, an integrated collaboration solution does not ensure knowledge sharing and a collaborative work environment. In fact, such a system plays a surprisingly small role in supporting the daily work. Other factors, such as a strong community, an open and inclusive atmosphere, work locations and expert tools, play significantly stronger roles. The thesis does not exclusively focus on the new collaboration solution that is based on Microsoft SharePoint. Rather, it seeks to understand how workers use available tools and systems to do their jobs. In such a setting, the solution based on Microsoft SharePoint is only one of a number of different tools and systems available to workers. In contrast to other studies that have suggested that work is mostly a local endeavour, we show that knowledge-intensive work requires workers to shift between local and global contexts and that they require systems and tools that can do the same. We identify tactics and strategies that are used by workers to navigate different contexts and systems to collaborate and do their <b>jobs.</b> In <b>summary,</b> this thesis examines socio-technical work practices within a large, heterogeneous organisation and contributes to the research on how information systemsserve as social constructs and should be understood and interpreted. It also provides practical implications for IT professionals and managers who are interested in developing and implementing information systems in complex settings.

The primary {{purposes}} {{of the study were}} to identify the most significant duties of the chief school administrator and to ascertain how the superintendent 2 ̆ 7 s job performance can best be measured. A second major purpose was to develop a recommended model for assessment of the superintendent 2 ̆ 7 s performance. ^ Procedure. The subjects of this study included the Superintendents and Board Chairpersons of 32 school systems in the state of Nebraska with enrollments between 600 and 1400 students. A questionnaire was sent to each participant to obtain his/her assessment of current practices and recommended procedures for evaluating the superintendent 2 ̆ 7 s <b>job</b> performance. ^ <b>Summary,</b> Conclusions and Recommendations. The review of the literature and findings of this study both suggest that there is a growing awareness of the need for formal evaluation of the superintendent 2 ̆ 7 s performance. In an age of increasing accountability the success of any school is highly dependent upon the quality of leadership provided by the school superintendent. As a result a growing number of schools are adopting statements of goals and objectives and establishing job targets for both administrators and teachers {{that can be used to}} measure individual job performance. Clearly a systematic evaluation process is needed to help boards assess the superintendent 2 ̆ 7 s leadership skills and evaluate the superintendent 2 ̆ 7 s attainment of the school 2 ̆ 7 s goals and objectives. ^ While the evidence suggests that most school board members believe some form of administrator evaluation is desirable they have not been able to fully devise and implement a plan or procedure for the formal written evaluation of the superintendent 2 ̆ 7 s performance. At the same time, the responses and comments by both groups revealed a strong interest and mutual support for conducting a formal evaluation of the superintendent 2 ̆ 7 s performance.

This study assessed the relationship of selected personal characteristics, unit-related characteristics, facets of job satisfaction, and career aspirations of academic deans. Six research questions directed this study. Four hundred community college academic deans were randomly assigned as participants and represented all 50 states. The usable response rate from the 400 participants was 50. 5 % (n= 202) representing all 50 states. Demographic data pertaining to gender, age, ethnicity, degree status, tenure in position, gross annual salary, number of hours worked per week, major responsibilities, size of college, location of college, number of full-time and part-time faculty supervised, number of full-time and part-time staff supervised, and career aspirations were collected through use of the IDS. The 1977 Long-Form MSQ was used to measure general, intrinsic, and extrinsic <b>job</b> satisfaction. Appropriate <b>summary</b> statistics, correlations, and regressions were computed to answer all six-research questions. Community college academic deans were neither dissatisfied nor satisfied with an MSQ sample mean score of 3. 828. The findings indicated that 55. 5 % (n= 112) were neither dissatisfied nor satisfied. Only 76 academic deans or 37. 5 % stated that they were satisfied and three deans or 1. 5 % were very satisfied. Ten deans or 5 % reported being dissatisfied and one or 0. 5 % dean reported being very dissatisfied. Only 15 % or 30 deans reported that they had career aspirations to pursue the community college presidency within the next one to ten years. The results also indicated that those academic deans that do not desire to be a community college president are slightly more satisfied than those deans who want to be a president. The results of the survey indicate that academic deans with the lowest job satisfaction score desired to move along the academic leadership pathway, and the deans that were more satisfied wanted to move in another direction or stay a dean...|$|R
40|$|Does coordinated care {{management}} improve {{employment for}} substance-using welfare recipients? Morgenstern J., Hogue A., Dauber S. et al. Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs: 2009, 70, p. 955 – 963. In New York intensive case management coordinating multiple {{sources of support}} helped resolve the substance use problems of welfare applicants, but only among the women – who faced the greatest barriers to working – did this promote employment. Perhaps men would have done better being helped to rapidly enter the <b>job</b> market. <b>Summary</b> Focusing on employment and training outcomes, the featured report complements an earlier report from the same US study which focused on substance use treatment participation and substance use outcomes. The study tested whether relatively intensive case management support helps welfare applicants overcome substance use problems and gain employment. A particular issue was whether welfare recipients who despite recent reforms {{have yet to find}} work can be helped to do so, or whether this caseload faces barriers too great to overcome, even with intensive help. Implemented in New York's Bronx district in partnership with the city's welfare agency, it was designed to be a practical trial which maximised real-world applicability while maintaining research integrity. Participants were 421 substance using single adults and adults with dependent children applying for welfare benefits. They were selected from 1519 such applicants {{on the basis of their}} reporting a substance use problem and being motivated to receive treatment. Initially they had been identified by welfare workers using a short questionnaire which screened applicants for substance use problems. Depending solely on where the next assessment slot was available, the workers transferred substance users for further assessment at one of the two offices in the study. One of the offices offered usual assessment and care services: assessment by an addiction counsellor focused on substance use problems in relation to employability, followed by allocation to a generic welfare worker whose role was to assess eligibility for welfare payments and deal with non-compliance with the welfare system's requirements. They also referred the beneficiary to services, but only during infrequent meetings limited by a large caseload. At the other office, more rounded and detailed assessments were conducted by a multidisciplinary team. After referring applicants to a range of services to meet identified needs, they transferred them to case managers. Their role was to maintain intensive contact with the beneficiary and with the agencies providing them with services, and to ensure that these agencies matched the individual's needs and performed acceptably. In the usual care option, quarterly reassessments focused on welfare system requirements, but in the case management option the focus was on client progress and adjusting the service mix accordingly. All 108 applicants who were in methadone maintenance treatment during the study were already in this treatment at the time they applied for benefits, and generally simply continued. Beyond these existing methadone patients, there were few if any heroin dependent applicants who might benefit from initiating treatment. Welfare case workers had more latitude to initiate or change other sorts of substance use treatments. Diagnostic interviews found that about 6 in 10 of the sample met criteria for substance dependence, mainly in respect of cocaine, alcohol or heroin, and another fifth for substance abuse. Psychological problems and criminal justice involvement were common. About 1 in 6 had some degree of responsibility for dependent children...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Human Movement Science)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. 1. The {{problem and}} {{objective}} of study Workers in physically demanding jobs have, {{over the last}} decade, shown {{a high incidence of}} work-related injuries as well as other related physical disorders (Dempsey & Hashemi, 1999 : 183; Mital & Ramakrishnan, 1999 : 74; WHO, 1999 : 1; Weir & Nielson, 2001 : 128; Cox et al, 2003 : 6). This has been shown to lead to absenteeism, lost work time and poor work quality which in turn give rise to increased costs of yearly worker compensation claims, medical treatment and general loss of production (Ciriello & Snook, 1999 : 149; Mital, 1999 : 246 - 247; Cox et al., 2003 : 6). For example, the World Health Organization indicates that work related injuries and illness kill an estimated 1. 1 million people worldwide every year. This is roughly equal to the number of worldwide deaths due to malaria each year (WHO, 1999 : 1). Research indicates that these types of injuries and/or work disability usually occur when the physical demands of the work tasks exceed the physical work capacity of the worker (Chaffin, 1974 : 251 - 254; Fraser, 1992 : 24; Shrey, 1997 a: 8). Two types of workers are usually pointed out by management in this regard, namely the older workers and females that are exposed to tasks with a high physical demand (Ayoub & Mital, 1989 : 9; Smith & Mustard, 2004 : 755; Sluiter, 2006 : 438). The above-mentioned problem seems to be a global concern (Mital, 1999 : 246; WHO, 1999 : 1) and forces companies to better manage the physical incapacity of workers in physical demanding jobs. The management of the electricity supply company in South Africa (hereafter the company) who realised that this problem was also prevalent in their workforce, developed minimum physical ability task requirements, that represent the physical work demands, for all the physically demanding jobs (Lubbe, 2003 b: 4). These minimum requirements enable the company to determine which workers do not have the physical work capacity to perform their physical work demands and to implement the necessary management process, such as a worksite wellness program, to address the problem. Hence the objective of the study were to determine the: a) role of gender on the physical work capacity profile of workers in the company based on the minimum physical ability task requirements of their job; b) role of age on the physical work capacity profile of workers in the company based on the minimum physical ability task requirements of their job; c) effect of a worksite wellness program on the physical work capacity profile of workers in the company based on the minimum physical ability task requirements of their <b>job.</b> 2. <b>Summary</b> of results a) The physical work capacity of male workers in this population are practically significant greater than that of female workers with the same job-related minimum physical ability task requirements. b) Practically significant more female workers do not have the minimum physical work capacity required by their job, than male workers. c) The physical work capacity of workers in physically demanding jobs within this company declines with aging. d) The age-related decline in physical work capacity for male workers is {{to such an extent that}} from the age of 60, the physical work demands of their job exceed their physical work capacity. e) The age-related decline in physical work capacity for female workers is to such an extent that, in general, the indication is that they will never have the required physical work capacity based on the minimum physical ability task requirements of their job, for it is predicted that from the age of 18, the physical work demands of their job exceed their physical work capacity. f) A worksite wellness program assists workers whose physical work capacity profile does not meet the minimum physical ability task requirements of their job, to regain the required physical work capacity. g) A worksite wellness program provide an alternative option to managing the physical work capacity of their workers, other than ill-health retirement, retrenchments or prolonged sick-leave.

40|$|This report {{argues that}} young Australian job seekers are losing {{out in the}} {{competition}} for scarce <b>jobs.</b> Executive <b>summary</b> During the 2013 election campaign, the major parties professed {{to be concerned about}} employment opportunity. The mantra was jobs, jobs, jobs. This is appropriate in a context where {{growth in the number of}} employed persons has fallen sharply, from 259, 000 in the year to May 2011, to 171, 000 in the year to May 2012 and 126, 900 in the year to May 2013. According to Treasury forecasts, it will fall to around 110, 000 in 2013 - 14, followed by a modest rise to around 150, 000 in 2014 - 15. Yet, the Australian government’s permanent-entry migration program was set at the record high level of 214, 000 in 2012 - 13 and it is encouraging temporary migrants to work in Australia in unprecedented numbers. There are almost no caps on the numberof visas issued in these temporary visa subclasses. However, the desperation of people in job scarce countries to access Australia’s labour market is enormous. One key illustration of the outcome is that the number of WHM visas issued has grown from 185, 480 in 2010 - 11 to 249, 231 in 2012 - 13. As of March 2013, there were 1. 1 million temporary visa holders (not counting New Zealanders) in Australia, most of whom held work rights. This stock is growing rapidly, in part because of the ease with which temporary residents are permitted to switch to another temporary or permanent visa. The incompatibility of this migration policy stance with the stated concern about jobs for locals is jarring. This is because recently-arrived migrants (defined as those arriving in Australia since the beginning of 2011) are dominating the growth in the number of employed persons in Australia. The key statistics are as follows. In the year to May 2013, there was an increase of 168, 000 recently-arrived overseas born migrants aged 15 plus in Australia. Of these, 108, 200 were employed. This is almost as large as the 126, 000 increase in employment in that year. The migration surge would not be an issue if the local working age population was stable or shrinking as some commentators assert. But it is not. Their numbers are growing strongly. It is young local workers who are the main losers in the competition for employment. This is especially the case for those without post-school education, who are seeking less skilled, entry-level jobs. They encounter a weak labour market where a growing share of local workers in the 55 plus age category is staying in the workforce. For example, the share of those aged 60 - 64 in the workforce increased from 39 per cent in May 2003 to 54 per cent in May 2013. Young people also have to compete for less skilled entry level work with an increasing number of job hungry temporary migrants looking for the same work. Currently, around 250, 000 young people leave school and enter the workforce each year. This is about the same number of Working Holiday Maker (WHM) visas issued in 2012 - 13. All these WHMs are aged 30 or less. They include a new breed of WHM, primarily looking for work rather than a holiday supplemented by work. They include large numbers from Taiwan, Ireland and Italy, all leaving economies where employment is difficult to find. The consequence is seriously high unemployment amongst locals aged 15 - 24 (14. 5 per cent for 15 - 19 year olds and 9. 5 per cent for 20 - 24 year olds). In addition, there has been a persistent decline in the labour market participation rates of these cohorts since 2007 (from 59. 4 per cent in May 2007 to 54. 1 per cent in May 2013 for 15 - 19 year olds and from 81. 3 per cent to 78. 1 per cent over the same period for 20 - 24 year olds). While a good thing if they obtain valued skills, many are seeking refuge in low-level training courses because of lack of employment opportunities. Not a word is being heard about these issues from the major political parties. The Coalition, at least, is not responsible, since it does not have its hands on the policy levers. But, it is proposing to make the situation much worse by extending work rights to overseas students who complete vocational training courses. While this study focusses on the plight of young locals, it also contains a technical analysis of the way the official Labour Force Survey (LFS) reports on the Australian labour market. This is relevant to the points made above because the LFS coverage does not include many of the recently-arrived migrant groups under discussion (including the majority of the WHMs). The LFS only includes migrants if they stay in Australia or are estimated to stay in Australia for 12 months of the 16 months after first arrival in Australia. As a consequence, it misses at least 500, 000 recently-arrived migrants, of whom some 250, 000 are likely to be employed. This finding does not significantly affect the conclusions of our inquiry regarding who is losing in the competition for employment. However, it does means that policy elites and commentators alike, tend to underestimate the scale of the recent migrant challenge for local youth who are seeking employment...|$|R

Chi Square (χ 2) criterion was used to verify the hypotheses about the independence of two variables (e. g., gender). The findings of the research indicate that the job satisfaction of physicians anesthesiologists reanimathologists is determined by their own approach to their profession. The approach to the work of anesthesiologists reanimathologists was assessed by the highest points (6) irrespective of gender. Physicians anesthesiologists reanimathologists value their job as the one which requires high professionalism (6. 7), considerable responsibility (6. 59) and also a lot of efforts (6. 02). It was identified that physicians anesthesiologists reanimathologists value responsibility for their actions as the major quality in their job (6. 73); they are satisfied with their relations with co-workers and opportunities for self-development (5. 86) and also for using their abilities (5. 38). Physicians are least satisfied with the feeling of insecurity with regard to the workplace (6. 43), lack of appreciation of their efforts (6. 27) and their salary (6. 09). The majority of the physicians are proud of their profession (6. 02), and if they had to choose it again, they would choose the same profession of a physician anesthesiologist reanimathologist (6. 24), and would also recommend their children to choose this profession (5. 39).
