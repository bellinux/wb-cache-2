40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the process}} on the psychiatric reform, {{with a focus}} on the interdisciplinary work developed by the health professionals from the health service "Dr. Candido Ferreira" in Campinas, Brazil. This is a philanthropic institution which contributes significantly to public mental health network in this city. Even though the service is integrated to the Unified Heath System (SUS), it presents a financial, administrative and managerial independence, which allows implementing some therapeutic experiences and managerial innovations. More specifically, this article focuses on the process of decision making by the interdisciplinary team, involving diagnosis and therapeutic process. Other themes, related to the organization of the service in the process of <b>dehospitalization,</b> are considered, such as the transfer of patients into residences outside the institution, the maintenance of these units, the management of the workshops in the institution which allows a financial income for the patient, {{and the beginning of the}} institution as a three years residence in Psychiatry. The methodological approach of the research is essentially qualitative, drawing from interviews and participant observation, related the professionals from this service...|$|E
40|$|A key {{component}} in the <b>dehospitalization</b> of persons with chronic mental illnesses and their translocation {{to a wide range}} of settings has been the shift from state to federal funding encouraged by the Social Security Administration 2 ̆ 7 s restrictions on funding for institutions for mental diseases (IMDs), usually referred to as the IMD exclusion. The overall effect of the exclusion, which limits federal funding for mentally ill patients receiving care in many settings, including state psychiatric hospitals, has been to create incentives for states to move patients out of state hospitals, which has contributed to homelessness and inappropriate incarceration. The author traces the background and development of the IMD exclusion, starting with the federal government 2 ̆ 7 s actions in the 1840 s ensuring that the states, not the federal government, would continue to fund care for their seriously mentally ill citizens. He also analyzes Congress 2 ̆ 7 many missed opportunities to pass legislation that would have modified, or perhaps even made moot, the IMD exclusion, including the Clinton administration 2 ̆ 7 s efforts at health reform, the quest for parity of insurance coverage for mental illnesses, and the initiation of public-sector managed care. The consequences of the continuation of the IMD exclusion are explored, and the intended fiscal consequences are contrasted with the unintended clinical outcomes...|$|E
40|$|Objective: to {{describe}} the relation between income and mental health {{as well as the}} process of <b>dehospitalization</b> and the family responsibility when taking care of a person with mental disorder and the difficulties through this process and the importance of the State in the promotion of a family’s financial and psychic support and to the role of nursing dealing with family and patients with mental illness. Methods: literature review systematic study using the followings describers: health mental; family; poverty; nursing, as axles of the following contents: family, financial conditions and mental health; poor families coping with mental disorders; the family burden; the importance of the State in the promotion of a family’s financial and psychic support and to the role of nursing dealing with family and patients with mental illness. Results: it’s consent the idea that the State should be the responsible for the guarantee of the social rights of all the citizens; all of the health’s professionals should support the familiars who live with a person with mental disorder teaching them how give the care and giving orientations about the social’s benefices. Conclusion: the humanist action of the nursing and of the others mental heath’s professional is so much important to the family who cooping with mental disorder, because who gives the care needs receive the same care too...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{quality of}} life {{experiences}} of the chronically mentally ill have received increased attention in outcome research lately and constitute a critical outcome of mental health. Aims: This study evaluated the perceived {{quality of life}} of the former psychiatric patients (N = 103) who have been moved from the Psychiatric Hospital of Leros to community hostels (N = 19) in Leros Island. In addition, the residents ’ clinical and social functioning profiles were examined together with the extent of institutional practices by the staff in residents ’ environment. Method: The present research is a cross-sectional study examining the impact of the transformation programmes Leros I and Leros II on the well-being of long-term psychiatric clients following the move. Results: The majority of the residents expressed high levels of satisfaction, in almost all variables of quality of life, except the variable of contact with family relations. The level of psychopathology was very low, while the majority of residents expressed low community and social skills. Finally, the staff (N = 64) allowed in a way, the expression of autonomy in the residents ’ environment. Conclusions: This study suggests that even the most chronic psychiatric population of Greece is able to give valid and reliable responses concerning {{the manner in which they}} perceive their present life. Key words: quality of life, Leros, <b>dehospitalization,</b> community hostels, social functionin...|$|E
40|$|Current {{reforms of}} mental health and {{substance}} abuse services (MHS) emphasize community-based care and the downsizing of psychiatric hospitals. Reductions in acute and semi-acute hospital beds are achieved through shortened stays or by avoiding hospitalization. Understanding the factors that drive the current inpatient treatment provision is essential. We investigated how the MHS service structure (diversity of services and balance of personnel resources) and indicators of service need (mental health index, education, single household, and alcohol sales) correlated with acute and semi-acute inpatient treatment provision. The European Service Mapping Schedule-Revised (ESMS-R) tool was used to classify the adult MHS structure in southern Finland (population 1. 8 million, 18 + years). The diversity of MHS in terms of range of outpatient and day care services or the overall personnel resourcing in inpatient or outpatient services {{was not associated with}} the inpatient treatment provision. In the univariate analyses, sold alcohol was associated with the inpatient treatment provision, while in the multivariate modeling, only a general index for mental health needs was associated with greater hospitalization. In the <b>dehospitalization</b> process, direct resource re-allocation and substituting of inpatient treatment with outpatient care per se is likely insufficient, since inpatient treatment is linked to contextual factors in the population and the health care system. Mental health services reforms require both strategic planning of service system as a whole and detailed understanding of effects of societal components...|$|E
40|$|The last half-century of {{psychiatric}} {{services in the}} United States is examined through developments and trends reported in the 50 years of publication of Psychiatric Services. The journal, earlier named Mental Hospitals and then Hospital and Community Psychiatry, was launched by the American Psychiatric Association in January 1950 and marks its 50 th anniversary this year. The author organizes his review {{of psychiatric}} services largely around the locus of care and treatment because the location of treatment [...] institution versus community [...] has been the battleground for the ideology of care and for the crystallization of policy and legal reform. He uses 2 ̆ 2 <b>dehospitalization</b> 2 ̆ 2 to describe the movement of patients out of state hospitals, rejecting the widely used term 2 ̆ 2 deinstitutionalization 2 ̆ 2 as inappropriate; {{one reason is that}} the term wrongly implies that many settings where patients ended up were not institutional. Also covered in detail, as reflected in the journal, are community care and treatment, economics, patient empowerment, and the interface issues of general hospitals, outpatient commitment, and psychosocial rehabilitation. The author notes that some concepts, such as outpatient commitment and patient empowerment, emerged earlier than now assumed, and that others, like psychosocial rehabilitation, recurred in slightly different forms over time. He concludes that even after 50 years of moving patients out of state hospitals and putting them somewhere else, mental health policymakers and practitioners remain too myopically focused on the locus of care and treatment instead of on the humaneness, effectiveness, and quality of care...|$|E
40|$|Mental {{health is}} an {{integral}} part of health and well-being. Mental health enables people to realize their potential, cope with the stressors of everyday life, and make contributions to society. Mental, neurological and substance use (MNS) disorders constitute 13 % of the global burden of disease. And yet, across all countries, public investment in preventing and treating this cluster of disorders is disproportionately low relative to this disease burden. Health systems have not adequately or sufficiently responded to the burden of MNS disorders: the gap between the need and supply of treatment ranges from 76 % to 85 % in low- and middle-income countries, and from 35 % to 50 % in high-income countries. Mounting evidence underlines the inequitable distribution, poor quality, and inefficient use of scarce resources to address mental health needs. Globally, annual spending on mental health is less than US $ 2 per person in high-income countries and less than US $ 0. 25 per person in low-income countries, with 67 % of these financial resources allocated to stand-alone mental hospitals. Flagrant abuse of human rights and discrimination against people with mental disorders and psychosocial disabilities have been found in such psychiatric institutions. The redirecting of mental health budgets toward community-based services, including the integration of mental health into general health care settings, is needed. To address this state of affairs, this dissertation takes a fresh look at the actions taken to formulate a comprehensive, coordinated response from health and social sectors. It is founded at the nexus of new institutional, world culture, and diffusion of innovation theories. This dissertation employs a mixed methods approach, combining statistical and survey analyses. A mental health policy is an official statement of a government that defines its vision, values, principles, and objectives to improve the mental health of a population. It also outlines the areas of actions, strategies, timeframes, budgets, targets and indicators used to realize the vision and achieve the objectives of the policy. In the first study, I examine the coercive and emulative isomorphic effects on the diffusion of mental health policy across geopolitical borders. Using discrete-time data for 193 countries covering the period from 1950 to 2011, I conduct an event history analysis to examine the influence of WHO accession, foreign aid, and peer influence on mental health policy adoption. The results confirm that the act of adopting mental health policy is partly owed to membership in the World Health Organization, as well as influence of neighbors in the same World Bank and World Health Organization regions. National mental health policy adoption is trumpeted as a milestone for mental health reform. Is mental health policy limited to a rhetorical plane or taken up for pragmatic reasons? The effectiveness of this "upstream" factor could be realized based on examining "downstream" models of deinstitutionalized programming. While mental health policy adoption is treated as an outcome of interest in the first study, it is treated as a predictor in the second study. More specifically, I test the phase of policy adoption as a determinant of psychiatric bed rate changes using panel data for the same 193 countries between 2001 and 2011. The analysis finds that late-adopters of mental health policy are more likely to reduce psychiatric beds in mental hospitals and other biomedical settings than innovators, whereas they are less likely than non-adopters to reduce psychiatric beds in general hospitals. Deinstitutionalization is a much more complex and sophisticated process than reducing <b>dehospitalization,</b> or the reduction of psychiatric beds. It is also about improving the quality of care provided by inpatient facilities while increasing access to care through the development of mental health services in other medical and community settings. However, progress towards mental health reform is often stalled because it is an essentially contested issue in professional and advocacy circles and a highly politicized one among governments. For these reasons, the third study gathers contemporary perspectives on deinstitutionalization from 78 mental health experts. The survey administered assesses their knowledge, attitude, and practices of expanding community-based mental health services and/or downsizing institution-based care. The respondents also attested to the enabling, reinforcing, and constraining factors prevalent in the 42 countries they collectively represent. The qualitative evidence is complementary to the quantitative evidence in that it portrays the contemporary mental health system as being controlled by a nucleus of inpatient care. It further suggests that innovations are made in linking specialty services with primary and social services to support people with mental, neurological, and substance use disorders and their families as they (re) integrate into their communities. Mental health care has branched out in new directions at the turn of the 21 st century. Time and again when governments are in the throes of strengthening their mental health systems, a closer look into the setup of infrastructure, essential medicines, human resources, and civil society involvement becomes necessary. This dissertation demonstrates that deinstitutionalization is a result of mental health policies imposed from the top down by the government. The experience with deinstitutionalizing mental health care also involves grassroots mobilization of social change by citizens, clients, families, and other advocates. In parallel with service reorganization, advances have been made in training lay personnel to offer services to people with MNS disorders. Research and development have made treatment more cost-effective and accessible. Cutting across temporal and geographic borders, tradition and modernity, this dissertation probes into the permeability of mental health policy and unpacks the complexity of deinstitutionalization...|$|E
