40|$|Young adult (N = 96) {{university}} students who varied in their binge drinking history were assessed by electroencephalography (EEG) recording during passive viewing.

The non- and low-binge drinkers exhibited less spectral power than the high-binge drinkers in the delta (0 – 4 Hz) and fast-beta (20 – 35 Hz) bands. Binge drinking appears to be associated with a specific pattern of brain electrical activity in young adults that may reflect the future development of alcoholism...|$|R

5|$|Moltke was {{surrendered}} {{with the}} rest of the High Seas Fleet on 24 November 1918 and interned at Scapa Flow, under the command of Kapitänleutnant Wollante. Believing that the Treaty of Versailles had been signed and his fleet was about to be seized by the British, Rear Admiral von Reuter ordered the scuttling of the High Seas Fleet on 21 June 1919, while the British Grand Fleet was away on exercises. The ship sank <b>in</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> and fifteen minutes. Moltke was raised in 1927 and scrapped at Rosyth in 1929.|$|E

The most powerful earthquake that THSRC has experienced measured 6.4 on the Richter Scale with an epicenter 17km from Jiaxian, Kaohsiung that shook southern Taiwan on 4 March 2010 (甲仙地震).

5|$|The X Corps attack {{involved}} a strike {{on the left}} flank by the 213th Infantry Regiment and 7th Tank Battalion, and on the right flank by the 205th Infantry Regiment and 4th Tank Battalion. The right flanking force arrived late, so the 213th Infantry and the 7th Tank Battalion advanced alone on the north axis. It was thought that the 213th could reach an area in between Chéhéry and Bulson in one hour fifty minutes and the 7th Tank Battalion <b>in</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours.</b> Yet {{it was not until}} 17 hours after the original order to advance to Bulson that the lead French tanks reached the Bulson ridge.

5|$|The {{solution}} to this dilemma was simple but nonetheless ingenious. Late in 1971, an Egyptian officer suggested the use of small, light, gasoline fueled pumps that could be ferried across the canal in inflatable rafts to blast through the sand barrier by hydraulic mining. The suggestion proved worthwhile, and the Egyptian Military ordered some 300 British-made pumps. Tests showed that five of these pumps could remove 1,500 cubic metres of sand in three hours. In 1972 another 150 more powerful German-made pumps were purchased. A combination of three British-made and two German-made pumps {{made it possible to}} clear a passage <b>in</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours.</b>|$|E

5|$|At the time, Ngô Đình Nhu {{was known}} to favor an even harder line against the Buddhists. Nhu was the younger brother of President Diệm and his main confidant, and was {{regarded}} as the real power behind the Ngô family's rule. Nhu had made statements calling for {{the suppression of the}} protests through his English-language newspaper, the Times of Vietnam. There were persistent reports that Nhu was seeking to usurp power from his elder brother and to attack the Buddhists. Nick Turner of Reuters approached Nhu and interviewed him about these rumors. Nhu said that if the Buddhist crisis were not resolved, he would stage a coup, demolish Xá Lợi <b>in</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours,</b> and head a new anti-Buddhist government. The news was promptly published, which the American embassy largely disregarded, purportedly unconvinced as to Nhu's seriousness.|$|E
5|$|Passenger traffic {{started on}} 10 October 1825, after the {{required}} licence was purchased, using the Experiment coach hauled by a horse. The coach was initially timetabled {{to travel from}} Stockton to Darlington <b>in</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours,</b> with a fare of 1s, and made a return journey {{four days a week}} and a one-way journey on Tuesdays and Saturdays. In April 1826 the operation of the coach was contracted for £200 a year; by then the timetabled journey time had been reduced to hours and passengers were allowed to travel on the outside for 9d. A more comfortable coach, Express, started the same month and charged 1s 6d for travel inside. Innkeepers began running coaches, two to Shildon from July, and the Union, which served the Yarm branch from 16 October. There were no stations: in Darlington the coaches picked up passengers near the north road crossing, whereas in Stockton they picked up at different places on the quay. Between 30,000 and 40,000 passengers were carried between July 1826 and June 1827.|$|E
5|$|The fleet {{remained}} in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the Treaty of Versailles. Von Reuter {{believed that the}} British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June 1919, which was the deadline for Germany to have signed the peace treaty. Unaware that the deadline had been extended to the 23rd, Reuter ordered the ships to be sunk at the next opportunity. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships. The ship sank <b>in</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> and fifteen minutes. The task of raising Von der Tann was secured by Ernest Cox's salvage company. During preparation work, three workers were nearly killed when their oxy-acetylene cutters set off a major explosion. The blast tore holes in the still submerged vessel and allowed water into the compartment that had been emptied with compressed air; {{by the time the}} men were rescued, the compartment had refilled almost completely and the men were up to their necks. Nevertheless, the ship was successfully brought up on 7 December 1930, and scrapped at Rosyth by the Alloa Shipbreaking Company between 1931 and 1934.|$|E

5|$|The pitch was slow, and {{the weather}} was cold and showery for the {{traditional}} tour opener against Worcestershire. Worcester attracted a record attendance of 32,000 with takings of more than ₤4000. The hosts elected to bat, and started strongly as a century second-wicket stand took them to 137/1 after 133 minutes. However, the dismissal of Charles Palmer, who top-scored with 85, precipitated a collapse and they lost their last nine wickets <b>in</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> to be all out for 233. Five Australian bowlers shared the wickets, with Johnson taking 3/52. In their sole innings, Australia took the initiative from the outset through a 166-run second-wicket stand between Morris (138) and Bradman (107). This took them to 265/1, before they declared at 462/8 after Miller had hit an unbeaten 50 in faster than even time. Off spinner Peter Jackson took 6/135 for the locals. In their second innings Worcestershire were bowled out by Australia for 212 runs, with 70 minutes to spare. McCool took 4/29 as the spinners took eight of the wickets.|$|E
5|$|The 1904 {{season was}} Bosanquet's best with bat and ball. Although {{he made a}} slow start batting, failing to reach double figures in six of his first nine innings, he was {{immediately}} successful with the ball. He took nine for 107 for MCC against the touring South African team and seven for 83 for I Zingari against Gentlemen of England, going on to take 11 wickets in the latter match. Then for Middlesex, he scored 110 in 85 minutes with 16 fours, in a tied match against the South Africans, and 126 <b>in</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> against Surrey including a five and 16 fours. In the latter match he also took five for 139. This preceded his selection for two Gentlemen v Players matches in six days. In the first at Lord's, he scored nine and 22 and took four wickets in the match. At the Oval, he hit 145 in 210 minutes with two fives and 15 fours. After taking two for 97 in the Players' first innings, he took six for 60 in the second to give the Gentlemen their second victory in a week. In a loss to Lancashire, the eventual 1904 County Championship winners, Bosanquet took six for 99 for Middlesex and in a drawn game against Yorkshire, who {{finished second in the}} table, he scored 141 and took 10 for 248. Immediately following the Yorkshire game, Bosanquet took 12 for 240 in a defeat of Nottinghamshire. After a quiet time in the return game against Lancashire, Bosanquet had a run of three consecutive successful matches. In the first, he took six for 75 against Surrey. In a close victory over Kent, he took five for 23 and eight wickets in the match after scoring 80 runs, and he achieved figures of 14 for 190 in a win against Sussex. In an end of season festival game, Bosanquet took five for 89 for the South against the North. In all first-class matches, Bosanquet achieved the double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets: he scored 1,405 runs at an average of 36.02 and took 132 wickets at an average of 21.62, the only time in his career he passed 100 wickets in a season. He accumulated five fifties and four centuries; with the ball he took 10 or more wickets in four matches and had 14 five wicket hauls.|$|E
