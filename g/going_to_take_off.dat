5|$|The {{books were}} {{relatively}} expensive to print, {{because of the}} Corbould and Finden illustrations, the images for the scientific volumes, {{and the use of}} Spottiswoode's printing house. In order to cut costs, the publishers decided to use small print and narrow margins. An estimated 4,000 copies of the first edition of the early volumes were printed, but the print run would probably have fallen to 2,500 since the sales did not pick up after 1835. As {{it became clear that the}} series was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>off,</b> fewer review copies were sent out and advertisements became smaller. Lardner's interest in the project may also have waned, as he paid less attention to its business dealings. However, some volumes of the Cabinet Cyclopaedia remained in print until 1890.|$|E
500|$|Sparks {{produced}} the album, their first in this genre, {{after it was}} commissioned as a radio musical by Sweden's national broadcasting service, Sveriges Radio. The project was proposed to Sparks by Marie Wennersten of SR Radioteatern, the station's radio drama department. Wennersten had become a Sparks fan after watching the duo perform in Sweden in 2004: [...] "I {{had never seen such}} energy and love from the audience. I thought the Södra Theatre was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> and fly away. I wrote to the Sparks fansite and thanked them for the experience." [...] Wennersten subsequently travelled to Los Angeles as a journalist, to attend and report on another Sparks concert. By that time, the idea of a collaboration had formed in her mind: [...] "I always dreamed of dragging them into the radio world." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1920s, Blanding {{also served as}} the {{president}} of the Lansing Senators, a baseball team that played in the Central League in 1921 and 1922. In May 1921, The Sporting News reported that Blanding [...] "has announced on various and sundry occasions he intends leaving his auto sales-rooms and going out to the lot, where he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> his coat and put the young pitchers of the Lansing team through a course of sprouts." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I know what's {{to be the}} end of it, as far as I am concerned,' replies Mrs Pipchin, 'and that's {{enough for}} me. I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> myself <b>off</b> in a jiffy.' ...|$|R
60|$|The {{resident}} Director gave {{an involuntary}} start, for the doctor, {{in the heat}} of his demonstration, caught it up and laid it across his own, as if he were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> it <b>off,</b> then and there.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm merely amplifying your suggestions, {{only you}} won't {{admit that they}} are yours. And she was your protegee." [...] "And you are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> her <b>off</b> my hands." [...] "I'm not so sure," [...] said Mrs. Maturin.|$|R
60|$|MANGAN [wildly]. Look here: I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> all {{my clothes}} [he begins tearing off his coat].|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> {{the most}} of my clothing," [...] {{answered}} the older brother. [...] "You can carry the things for me--and don't drop them at the ford." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh! Well, as {{a matter}} of fact, you know, I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> my tie. I always do, {{especially}} at night. It's a sort of habit I've got into.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then you'd {{better get}} down on to the wheel-case {{bracings}} with your grip. I don't know how they're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> you <b>off,</b> but I guess they'll shoot her up head to wind and you'll have to jump." ...|$|R
60|$|LADY CHILTERN. I {{will be back}} in a moment. I am only <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> my hat <b>off.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Hugh can wait," [...] he declared, as {{he passed}} his arm through Olive's. [...] "This is my last night on shore for heaven knows how long and I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> Olive <b>off</b> <b>to</b> see my {{photographs}} of the Scorpion. Old Wilcock handed them to me out of his drawer this afternoon." ...|$|R
6000|$|His voice unsteady, Carl said: [...] "Jiminy! it's so hot, Eve! I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> this darn {{shirt and}} collar {{and put on}} a soft shirt. S-say, w-why don't you put on a kimono or something? Be so much cooler." ...|$|E
60|$|Disheartened {{and worn}} out, Albinia {{did not feel}} equal even to <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> her walking things, but {{sat down in the}} drawing-room on the sofa, and tried to silence the girls' {{questions}} and chatter, by desiring Lucy to read aloud.|$|E
6000|$|... "This signifies nothing," [...] says Blue Beard; [...] "you must die"; then, {{taking hold}} of her hair with one hand, and lifting up the sword with the other, he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> her head. The poor lady, turning about to him, and looking at him with dying eyes, desired him to afford her one little moment to {{recollect}} herself.|$|E
6000|$|... "What are you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do, Andy? <b>Take</b> <b>off</b> your coat, roll up your sleeves, {{and grab}} a pick and shovel?" [...] {{questioned}} his twin.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have an {{easy time}} of it now, Karl. Count Eulenfurst is kindly <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> me <b>off</b> and nurse me for a bit; {{and you will have}} to stay here and look after the horses, until I return. It would not be safe for you to {{accompany}} me, arid I think you want a rest as much as I want nursing.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> {{your hand}} <b>off</b> his collar this instant, or get {{yourself}} into trouble," [...] and the merchant from Waterville forced {{his way through}} the throng until he stood by Teddy's side.|$|R
6000|$|My {{new friend}} shook her head. [...] "They sleep," [...] she answered, [...] "in two little outer {{galleries}} at the back, where their beds has always been, {{ever since the}} Charity was founded. It being so very ill-conwenient to me as things is at present, the gentlemen are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> {{a bit of the}} back-yard, and make a slip of a room for 'em there, to sit in before they go to bed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, thank you; don't tease yourself. Mrs. Drew {{will take}} care of us. Never mind; but how bad your head is!' said Amabel, as {{he sat down on the}} sofa, leaning his elbow on his knee, and {{pressing}} his hand very hard on his forehead. 'You must lie down and keep quiet, and never mind us. We only want a little tea. I am just <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> my bonnet, and see what they have done with baby, and then I'll come down. Pray lie still till then. Mind he does, Charlie.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Next {{the tired}} captive {{sat down and}} was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> his buskins, timidly asking leave with his eye, but another silk-and-velvet discomforter went down upon his knees and took the office from him. He made two or three further efforts to help himself, but being {{promptly}} forestalled each time, he finally gave up, {{with a sigh of}} resignation and a murmured [...] "Beshrew me, but I marvel they do not require to breathe for me also!" [...] Slippered, and wrapped in a sumptuous robe, he laid himself down at last to rest, but not to sleep, for his head was too full of thoughts and the room too full of people. He could not dismiss the former, so they stayed; he did not know enough to dismiss the latter, so they stayed also, to his vast regret--and theirs.|$|E
500|$|By November 2009, Franceschi {{described}} {{playing the}} material live as having [...] "become suffocated almost and we've really overplayed some of them". Prior to Slam Dunk Festival 2015, there were rumours that {{the band was}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> perform <b>Take</b> <b>Off</b> Your Colours in its entirety. Franceschi later explained the band would be [...] "extensively paying homage to that with songs" [...] from the album.|$|R
5000|$|Albert's {{allotment}} provided {{something to}} do in his later years. When he feared the Council was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> it <b>off</b> him, the neighbours agreed to help out, although he was furious when Ray Langton carved [...] "Albert rules OK" [...] into his marrow. Further, salad from his allotment {{was the cause of}} a sickness in the street when it was sold at the Corner Shop in 1978.|$|R
5000|$|Morton: (Miserably) [...] "But Lizzie {{they were}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> her leg <b>off</b> without it ... without anything!" [...] (He seems {{on the verge}} of {{hysteria}} himself) [...] "They were just <b>going</b> <b>to</b> strap her down and hack it off!" ...|$|R
6000|$|As {{there had}} been no bid at all, {{everybody}} looked about and grinned at everybody, while I touched little Sophy's face and asked her if she felt faint, or giddy. [...] "Not very, father. It will soon be over." [...] Then turning from the pretty patient eyes, which were opened now, and seeing nothing but grins across my lighted grease-pot, I went on again in my Cheap Jack style. [...] "Where's the butcher?" [...] (My sorrowful eye had just caught sight of a fat young butcher {{on the outside of the}} crowd.) [...] "She says the good luck is the butcher's. Where is he?" [...] Everybody handed on the blushing butcher to the front, and there was a roar, and the butcher felt himself obliged to put his hand in his pocket, and take the lot. The party so picked out, in general, does feel obliged to take the lot--good four times out of six. Then we had another lot, the counterpart of that one, and sold it sixpence cheaper, which is always wery much enjoyed. Then we had the spectacles. It ain't a special profitable lot, but I put 'em on, and I see what the Chancellor of the Exchequer is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> the taxes, and I see what the sweetheart of the young woman in the shawl is doing at home, and I see what the Bishops has got for dinner, and a deal more that seldom fails to fetch 'em 'up in their spirits; and the better their spirits, the better their bids. Then we had the ladies' lot--the teapot, tea-caddy, glass sugar-basin, half-a-dozen spoons, and caudle-cup--and all the time I was making similar excuses to give a look or two and say a word or two to my poor child. It was while the second ladies' lot was holding 'em enchained that I felt her lift herself a little on my shoulder, to look across the dark street. [...] "What troubles you, darling?" [...] "Nothing troubles me, father. I am not at all troubled. But don't I see a pretty churchyard over there?" [...] "Yes, my dear." [...] "Kiss me twice, dear father, and lay me down to rest upon that churchyard grass so soft and green." [...] I staggered back into the cart with her head dropped on my shoulder, and I says to her mother, [...] "Quick. Shut the door! Don't let those laughing people see!" [...] "What's the matter?" [...] she cries. [...] "O woman, woman," [...] I tells her, [...] "you'll never catch my little Sophy by her hair again, for she has flown away from you!" ...|$|E

50|$|A night glow or balloon glow is {{an event}} that is often held as a climax to a hot air balloon festival. The {{balloons}} are set up at sunset in the launch area, an open field, or a football stadium and are inflated {{as if they are}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>off,</b> but instead of being allowed to ascend, they are held down by the ground crew. The propane burners are ignited periodically to keep the balloons inflated with hot air.|$|E
50|$|The L.A.W. {{were able}} to free Captain Atom {{and all of the}} members went their {{separate}} ways. The Blue Beetle decided that he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> some time <b>off</b> from being a super-hero for a while so that he can better understand who he truly is.|$|R
6000|$|But Mr. Travers seemed another man. [...] "I am afraid, d'Alcacer, that you, too, are {{not very}} strong-minded. I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a blanket <b>off</b> this bedstead. [...] ." [...] He flung it hastily over his arm and {{followed}} d'Alcacer closely. [...] "What I suffer mostly from, strange to say, is cold." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is {{very good}} of them, doctor. Please thank Madame Demaine for me. She was in here this morning--at least I suppose it was she--and she did not bother me with thanks, which was a great comfort. You are not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> these {{bandages}} <b>off</b> {{and put them on}} again, I hope?" ...|$|R

50|$|In {{the final}} scene, {{the house is}} ransacked and Lee and Austin are working vigorously on their script. Their mother returns and Lee is first to notice her. She is {{confused}} by her sons' appearances {{and the state of}} her house. Austin tells her that he and Lee are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> into the desert, but Lee says they might have to postpone the trip because he doesn't think Austin is cut out for the desert life-style. Austin responds by attempting to strangle Lee and their mother storms out of the house in disarray. Austin finally lets go of Lee, and is worried for a second that he’s killed his brother. As Austin moves for the door, Lee rises. The two brothers face one another as the lights fade.|$|E

5000|$|Stewart's {{problems}} {{began in}} the bottom of the first when he purposely hit Steve Sax with his first pitch. After retiring Franklin Stubbs, Stewart balked Sax to second. Mickey Hatcher, who hit only one homer all season, then shocked the crowd by hitting a two-run shot off Stewart. Hatcher further excited the Dodger stadium fans by running full speed around the bases. Commentator Joe Garagiola noted, [...] "He ran in like they thought they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> it <b>off</b> the scoreboard! He really circled those bases in a hurry!" [...] and [...] "He's a Saturday Evening Post cover!" ...|$|R
50|$|After {{spending}} 2014 promoting Wanderlust, on 28 January 2015, Ellis-Bextor revealed on her Twitter {{account that}} she had begun working on her sixth studio album, once again with Ed Harcourt.

50|$|In {{the morning}} of 28 May 1987, Rust refueled at Helsinki-Malmi Airport. He told air traffic control that he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Stockholm, and <b>took</b> <b>off</b> at 12:21 p.m. However, {{immediately}} after his final communication with traffic control he turned his plane to the east. Air controllers tried to contact {{him as he was}} moving around the busy Helsinki-Moscow route, but Rust turned off all communications equipment aboard.|$|R
