40|$|Abstract. In {{practical}} {{centrifugal compressor}} fault diagnosis, {{it is very}} difficult to improve the <b>fault</b> <b>recognition</b> rate, especially when the sample sizes are small. To solve this problem, a new <b>fault</b> <b>recognition</b> method based on fuzzy gray relational grade was proposed. Firstly, according to fuzzy set theory, the fuzzy relation coefficient (FRC), fuzzy relation degree (FRD) and fuzzy relative weights (FRW) of all fault features were calculated. Secondly, the gray system theory was used to obtain the gray relational coefficients (GRC). Thirdly, by combining FRW and GRC, two fuzzy gray relation grades (FGRG) were presented, which is the Hamming distance-based fuzzy gray relation grade (HD-FGRG) and the Euclidean distance-based fuzzy gray relation grade (ED-FGRG), respectively. Finally, the <b>fault</b> <b>recognition</b> results were obtained by using the max membership degree principle. The centrifugal compressor fault diagnosis results show that the ED-FGRG method is more effective and accurate than traditional gray relational analysis (T-GRA) method, the weighted gray relational analysis (W-GRA) method, and the entropy weight-based gray relational analysis (EW-GRA) method and the HD-FGRG method...|$|E

Some time ago, each communication link was transmitting a single channel. By using optical fiber, several information channels can be multiplexed in one link. As a consequence, the transmitted information as well as the data rate have increased.

40|$|In {{view of the}} {{problems}} of uneven distribution of reality fault samples and dimension reduction effect of locally linear embedding (LLE) algorithm which is easily affected by neighboring points, an improved local linear embedding algorithm of homogenization distance (HLLE) is developed.

It is helpful to choose effective neighboring points to construct weight matrix for dimension reduction. Because the <b>fault</b> <b>recognition</b> performance improvement of HLLE is limited and unstable, the paper further proposes a new local linear embedding algorithm of supervision and homogenization distance (SHLLE) by adding the supervised learning mechanism. On the basis of homogenization distance, supervised learning increases the category information of sample points so that the same category of sample points will be gathered and the heterogeneous category of sample points will be scattered.

40|$|In {{the field}} of rotor <b>fault</b> pattern <b>recognition,</b> most of {{classical}} pattern recognition methods generally operate in feature vector spaces where different feature values are stacked into one-dimensional (1 D) vector and then processed by the classifiers. In this paper, time-frequency image of rotor vibration signal is represented as a texture feature tensor for the pattern <b>recognition</b> of rotor <b>fault</b> states with the linear support higher-tensor machine (SHTM). Firstly, the adaptive optimal-kernel time-frequency spectrogram visualizes the unique characteristics of rotor fault vibration signal; thus the rotor fault identification is converted into the corresponding time-frequency image (TFI) pattern recognition. Secondly, in order to highlight and preserve the TFI local features, the TFI is divided into some TFI subzones for extracting the hierarchical texture features. Afterwards, to avoid the information loss and distortion caused by stacking multidimensional features into vector, the multidimensional features from the subzones are transformed into a feature tensor which preserves the inherent structure characteristic of TFI. Finally, the feature tensor is input into the SHTM for rotor <b>fault</b> pattern <b>recognition</b> and the corresponding recognition performance is evaluated. The experimental {{results showed that the}} method of classifying time-frequency texture feature tensor can achieve higher recognition rate and better robustness compared to the conventional vector-based classifiers, {{especially in the case of}} small sample size...|$|R
