5000|$|De Lairesse {{was born}} in Liège and was the second son of painter Renier de Lairesse (1597-1667). He studied art under his father and from 1655 under Bertholet Flemalle.

50|$|Parallels {{are used}} in {{machining}} operations, be it milling, drilling, turning or sometimes grinding.

She was the one that received it, and when she activated it she called it Princess Mode, due to the fact it makes her look like a princess like the other two Musketeers.

The project is comprised of three parts: a new curriculum centered around a degree option <b>in</b> <b>VISE</b> to be earned {{as part of the}} Masters or Ph.

Automatic visitor/tourist guide information system, which is designed mainly for privacy of visi-tors. In this RFID based application, which is targeted to reach requirements and aims for particular user group or individual to listen to target within a no familiar or totally unknown area without taking any help out side. Starting from the entrance gate, application guides the user until wherever the user wants to reach and <b>in</b> <b>vise</b> versa direction. During the trip, every user will get information about each spot in selected language. The advantage {{of the system is}} the visitor can get the information repeatedly by selecting the button. The small earphone connected to the RF guide system will give clear information of each spot automatically when the person approaches in to. So every visitor will get information individually...|$|E

Fixed rates in these test exercises as running 30 m, six-minute run, the slope of the torso forward from a sitting position, curl <b>in</b> <b>vise</b> on the bar, 4 x 9 m shuttle run, standing long jump seats. Revealed a low level of physical development and physical fitness of schoolboys (in particular dexterity).

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of acquired resistance to drugs {{is important in}} many areas of therapy. This paper reports on the nature of acute resist-ance developed toward the hypotensive effect of the fibrinolytic enzyme, plasmin. In previous studies, Back et al. (1956) observed the develop-ment of resistance toward the fibrinolytic, fibrinogenolytic and hemodynamic effects of plasmin. Iodine’ 31 -labeled venous clots had been formed in dogs, and the extent of <b>in</b> <b>vise</b> fibrinoly-sis recorded by continuous measurement of changes in radioactivity levels over the throm-bosed areas during plasmin therapy. The following factors suggested themselves as possible mechanisms for the resistance to fibrino-lytic therapy: a) alteration of the clot structure; b) increase in inhibitor (antiplasmin) level; c) antibody formation; and d) increase in detoxifica-tion and/or excretion mechanisms. The resistance toward the fibrinogenolytic and hemodynamic effects may involve any of the above factors except the first. Decreased fibrinolytic effect following repeated plasmin administration was shown to be due, in part, to changes in clot structure (Back et al., 1958). Also observed was a transitory rise in antipiasmin level immediately following plasmin injection (Back and Ambrus, 1957). The inhibitor change, however, was considered insufficient to account for the rapidly developed resistance. Antibody production was excluded since some degree of resistance developed even after a single plasmin injection, and maximal resistance was obtained long before the period of possible anti-‘Supported by grants from the National Insti...|$|E
