2500|$|The <b>downstream</b> <b>section</b> through Nottingham and {{connecting}} to the River Trent remains in use {{as part of}} the Beeston and Nottingham Canal. It was not originally built with a towpath, but in 1976, the Nottinghamshire Leisure Services Committee approved plans to construct one. The work took six years to complete, and was opened by Illtyd Harrington of British Waterways on 9 June 1982, at a ceremony also attended by the Lord Mayor of Nottingham, Peter Burgess. The towpath of the canal through Nottingham city centre forms part of Nottingham's Big Track, a [...] circular car-free cycle route and footpath, which follows the canal from the railway station in Nottingham to the Beeston locks, and then returns via the Trent riverside path.|$|E
2500|$|... "Passerillage with straining" [...] or [...] "late harvest" [...] {{consists}} {{of leaving the}} grapes on the vine to concentrate the sun. The sugar no longer builds up once reaching maturity but the water evaporates which lowers the yield but increases the concentration of sugar. This is {{the oldest and most}} common method. It can be improved by plucking the stems: the winemaker prevents sap reaching the cluster and so it dries faster. The annular incision, long practiced, involves removing a ring of bark on the branch below the clusters, the sweet sap cannot descend and is concentrated in the grapes, while the sap continues to feed the upper branch. Another quick method is to cut a portion of the stem, the grape is dried upstream but the <b>downstream</b> <b>section</b> progresses normally. The blending in the vat or the press of two types of grapes improves the final result ...|$|E

40|$|The floristic {{composition}} and {{spatial distribution of}} algal communities in 97 stations in the Tiber River and its tributaries were studied. A total of 128 taxa were found, belonging mainly to the Chlorophyta, Bacillariophyta and Cyanophyta. Filamentous algae (Cladophora glomerata, Vaucheria geminata, Oedogonium sp. and Spirogyra spp.) were {{the most common and}} abundant species. Melosira varians, Cocconeis pediculus, Gomphonema olivaceum, Cyclotella meneghiniana, Fragilaria crotonensis, Leptolyngbya valderiana and several species of Oscillatoria were also widely distributed but they were not important in terms of biomass. Spatial variations of species richness were found, with the middle and upstream sections showing a wider range of taxa than the <b>downstream</b> <b>sections.</b> Chamaesiphon incrustans and Lemanea fluviatilis were found only in the upstream sections of some watercourses of the basin in fast-flowing, cool, well-oxygenated waters, while Stigeoclonium tenue and Ulva flexuosa was recorded exclusively in <b>downstream</b> <b>sections</b> with slow-flowing, warm and eutrophic waters...|$|R

50|$|The Xin River can {{be divided}} into upstream, {{midstream}} and <b>downstream</b> <b>sections.</b> The upper reaches of river are in mountainous, undulating terrain.

50|$|The brook is {{confined}} {{in a concrete}} or wood channel along the whole of its length, and the water quality is often poor. However, from Lyttleton Playing Fields to the junction with Dollis Brook its route is almost all through local parks. The <b>downstream</b> <b>section</b> is lined by oak, ash and willow trees, providing a good habitat for birds, and grey wagtails often forage at its edge. The brook is a Site of Local Importance for Nature Conservation.|$|E
50|$|The valve {{is housed}} within a bulged {{section of the}} {{penstock}} pipe. The valve mechanism forms a cylindrical body within this pipe, with the water flowing around it. This <b>downstream</b> <b>section</b> of this valve body is conical and free to move axially. When it moves downstream, it seals against a conical surface at the outlet of the valve, closing off the flow. When closed, the valve is held shut by the supply water pressure, providing a good seal.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. —Significant {{reductions}} in juvenile stream salmonid growth {{have been observed}} in association with low summer flow, but underlying mechanisms are poorly understood and predictive power is limited. We conducted a stage-specific analysis {{of the relationship between}} summer flow and the growth of age- 0 Atlantic salmon Salmo salar in two rearing sites in the upper Connecticut River basin, New Hampshire. We contrasted effects of variation in foraging habitat availability and temperature on individual age- 0 Atlantic salmon mass during one high-flow year and two low-flow years and from high- and low-flow sites within years. Overall age- 0 Atlantic salmon mass was positively correlated with the availability of model-predicted favorable foraging locations and negatively correlated with density during the summer. Individual Atlantic salmon mass and the proportion of temperature-predicted maximum mass were lowest during the two low-flow years and were lower in upstream than in <b>downstream</b> <b>sections.</b> Between-year variation in growth was not closely associated with temperature model predictions. However, some of the difference be-tween upstream and <b>downstream</b> <b>sections</b> appeared to be associated with lower summer temper-atures in the upstream section.
