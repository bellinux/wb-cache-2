5|$|Gilsig has {{characterized}} Terri as being emotionally {{still in high}} school, and lacking the skills to make her marriage work. She has explained that Terri feels threatened by her husband's commitment to the glee club, worried that it is pulling him away from her, and will stop at nothing to keep her marriage together. She does not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> Terri will be featured in the series, as she was initially created simply {{as an obstacle to}} come between Will and Emma.|$|E
5|$|I believe {{also two}} things. As I just said, {{there must be}} no imposition. Secondly, for an {{indefinite}} period – I do not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> – I should have, I would have English as an associate, additional language {{which can be used}} not because of facilities and all that... but because I do not wish the people of Non-Hindi areas to feel that certain doors of advance are closed to them because they are forced to correspond – the Government, I mean – in the Hindi language. They can correspond in English. So I could have it as an alternate language as long as people require it and the decision for that – I would leave not to the Hindi-knowing people, but to the non-Hindi-knowing people.|$|E
25|$|Historians do not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> Jesus preached. The {{synoptic}} Gospels {{suggest an}} interval {{of up to}} one year. The Gospel of John mentions three Passovers, and Jesus' ministry is traditionally {{said to have been}} three years long. Others claim that Jesus' ministry apparently lasted one year, possibly two.|$|E

25|$|The {{crew had}} been on reduced-rations {{since the end of}} the first week on the island. Some of the crewmen, noting that there were ample {{supplies}} of water and rum, went to the captain to ask for an increase in their rations, but he chased them off with threats. The men then asked Royal Marine Lieutenant Scott to intercede for them. When Scott presented a petition to Captain Herbert on behalf of the men, Herbert had Scott arrested. The captain then explained to the crew that he did not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> it would be until they could leave the island, and then read them the Articles of War. The next day the captain increased the water ration by one pint per man.|$|E
25|$|Web-based spiders have poor spatial {{appreciation}} and {{get much of}} their information from reading tensions and movement in their web. P. africana, P. fimbraba and P. labiata can use their eight legs and two palps to pluck another spider's web with a virtually unlimited range of movements, using a trial and error method, until it finds and repeats a set of movements that either lures the prey {{out into the open}} or calms the prey while the Portia walks slowly close enough to bite the victim. If the prey stops being controlled by the sequence, the Portia tries new combinations until one works, and then repeats the new sequence. While such hunting shows use of least short-term memory, as of 2011 researchers do not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> a Portia can retain such memories nor whether a Portia may use different trial and error starts for some prey species.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} was filmed {{the weekend of}} February 6, 2010 in Miami, Florida, {{directed}} by TAJ Stansberry. Two clips were filmed, one for the original song {{and one for the}} remix version.

500|$|Well, I didn’t <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> {{the comic}} book series was going to last. I hoped that it would become a success and survive for years and years. But {{at that time in}} my career, it was very early, I had had a lot of books canceled, just because of poor sales. So early on in the book I would move past storylines very quickly. I set up this love {{triangle}} and I resolved that story and moved along within the first [...] issues. But there's a lot of story potential to mine there. One {{of the things that the}} TV show is able to do is to look at {{the comic book}} series with hindsight and go, 'This would probably be something that we could explore more.' And that's what we're going to be doing. So we'll be seeing a lot more of the Lori-Shane-Rick love triangle.|$|E
500|$|Overall, while fan {{reaction}} to her character had previously {{resulted in a}} backlash Gilsig found [...] "tough", she hoped that [...] "Mattress" [...] would be the episode in which [...] "anti-Terri fans joined Team Terri". Asked how she felt about Terri being a 'love to hate' character, Gilsig replied: [...] "As long as you love to hate her, that's OK. It would be a different show if there weren't characters like Terri or Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch), otherwise you'd be at Disneyland. It would be the happiest place on Earth." [...] Gilsig does not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> her character will feature in the series, and has explained [...] "When Terri was created, she was created obviously to be an obstacle between Emma and Will. They needed an obstacle, otherwise there's no show. What's been fun {{about it is that}} she's managed to emerge as a character unto herself with her own complexities." ...|$|E
500|$|Stefani {{initially}} did {{not intend}} to tour to support the album, responding [...] "What tour?" [...] to a question from MTV News in December 2004 regarding a possible tour. She later mentioned several times that she had not originally intended to tour in support of the album, referring to her [...] "illegal tour" [...] and apologizing for her breaking her promise not to tour on stage at the Xcel Energy Center in Saint Paul, Minnesota on November 14 and admitting [...] "I just wanted to make a record. I didn't want to tour, I was too tired, then you guys kept buying the record, and I had to come out and see you guys" [...] on stage at Winnipeg on November 16. In a September interview with MTV News, Stefani said of the tour: [...] "I'm looking forward to it, it's going to be unbelievable. [...] I would love to try to roll a little bit of 'Orange County Girl' in there. We'll see. Anything can happen in rehearsals. I don't even <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> the show can be right now." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{producing}} {{the music for}} Oni, O'Donnell was tasked with composing the music for Bungie's next project, which would be unveiled at E3 2000. After talking with Joseph Staten, O'Donnell decided the music needed to be [...] "big, exciting, and unusual with a classical orchestra touch to give it some weight and stature. We also wanted it {{to have some sort}} of 'ancient' feel to it." [...] O'Donnell came up with the idea of opening the piece with gregorian chant and jotted down the melody in his car. Because he did not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> the presentation would be, O'Donnell created [...] "smushy" [...] opening and closing sections that could be expanded or cut as time required to back up a rhythmic middle section. The music was recorded and sent to New York the same night the piece was finished; the resulting music became the basis for the Halo series' [...] "highly recognizable" [...] signature sound, and what has been called one of the best-known video game themes. The use of the chant in the main theme has been credited with contributing to popular interest in the genre. Halos music used an interactive engine to change music in response to player's actions; this non-linear method has since become widespread. The scores for Halo and its sequel Halo 2 garnered awards such as The Game Developer's Choice Award and Best Original Video Game Soundtrack from Rolling Stone.|$|E
500|$|Fink {{does not}} <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> her {{character}} {{will be featured}} on Glee. When asked about what she likes about her character, Fink said: [...] "I think what I love about Lauren is she's so strong and so confident and {{she knows what she}} wants and I feel very blessed to play a role model for people who have ever felt other or different. I remember how I used to feel watching TV and seeing Sara Rue on Popular because she was an inspiration to me. It's funny because what I love about Lauren is that she's unapologetic and she's confident and she's making Puck work for it and she's not just looking for a roll in the hay. I think that they are very sweet together, there is this vulnerability when they are both such bad asses and you put them together and I think there is something really special there. What I appreciate about Lauren is that she's like I don't need to give it to you, you're going to work for it, and I think that's a great message to send to young girls. I think that he is smitten and she is probably a little smitten too but I think she has enough self esteem not to give everything up for the charming cute boy that's kind of after her." [...] Kevin Fallon, a writer for The Atlantic, reacted favorably to the casting of Fink: [...] "Glee hit the trifecta this year with its three major cast additions. First there were Darren Criss—who's exploded with popularity—and Chord Overstreet. Now there's Ashley Fink's Lauren. And while the tough-only-on-the-outside Lauren can deliciously out-sass Santana Lopez, it's her straight-talking that really has me sold." ...|$|E

2500|$|Due to {{its early}} date of composition, Curtain {{makes no mention}} of Poirot's later cases, in novels {{published}} after World War II. Details are only very occasionally anachronistic (such as the mentions of hanging, which had been abolished in Great Britain in 1965). Christie could not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> she would live nor how popular Poirot would remain. See Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple for further discussion of her views of Poirot. The fifth paragraph in Curtain ("Wounded in the war that for me would always be the war—the war that was wiped out now by a second and more desperate war" [...] says Hastings) marks the passing of time for Hastings, and the long friendship of the two men, as well as making a link to the first Poirot novel.|$|E

2500|$|Kinney {{mentioned}} in a February 2006 {{interview that he}} would be interested in writing new material, but not as Alice in Chains.

We're not trying to replace Layne. We want to play these songs one more time, and if it seems like the right thing to do, it'll happen. I don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> it will go or where it will take us. It's kind of a tribute to Layne and our fans, the people who love these songs.

[...] Hank had been in rehab before, as well as court-mandated detox, and it had never worked. [...] Once Hank was even kicked out of Alcoholics Anonymous because he brought into the meeting a bottle of Mad Dog 20-20 and started drinking it five seconds after the meeting started. [...] Regarding trying to get Hank help for his alcoholism, Howard Stern explained, [...] "People always asked me if we {{tried to get him to}} stop drinking, and I said all the time we did..." [...] Stern also related that there were employees of the show who tried to get Hank into programs.|$|E
