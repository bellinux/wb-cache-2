Burney concluded that while the villagers had possibly encountered a Malagasy hippopotamus, it was also possible that the stories were inaccuratea combination of misidentified animals, old folk traditions, and information the villagers had gathered from modern paleontology.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{publication}} of his bestselling books, Speer donated a considerable amount of money to Jewish charities. According to Siedler, these donations were as high as 80% of his royalties. Speer kept the donations anonymous, both for fear of rejection, and <b>for</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> called a hypocrite.|$|E
5|$|On October26, the Honduran Permanent Contingency Commission {{coordinated with}} {{neighboring}} countries regarding the storm. Officials initially issued {{a state of}} emergency for the offshore islands and five coastal departments, which was later extended {{to the rest of the}} country. The government increased emergency spending and created a National Emergency Commission. Officials advised residents to evacuate in flood-prone areas, although many people stayed <b>for</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> looted. Some left to stay with relatives during the hurricane. Prisoners in Tegucigalpa Central Penitentiary were evacuated to the national stadium.|$|E

5|$|In {{the face}} of a looming crisis in his career, Wills {{admitted}} to throwing in his 1870–71 Australian Cricketers' Guide, and in so doing taunted his enemies to stop him. Nonetheless, he was made Victoria XI captain for the March 1871 intercolonial against New South Wales, held at the Albert Ground. Wills' first innings top score of 39* was offset by his drunken behaviour in the field and his apparent reluctance to bowl <b>for</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> called. Victoria won by 48 runs. Not long after, Wills was no-balled for throwing {{for the first time in}} a club match. Rumour spread that the umpire had conspired against him with the opposing club's owner.|$|E
5|$|On Henry's {{death in}} December 1135, Pain {{attended}} the king's funeral. Pain {{was an early}} supporter of King Stephen, although he was said initially to have been afraid to appear at Stephen's court <b>for</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> confronted by those he had oppressed. Nevertheless, Pain was with the new king by early January 1136, when he witnessed one of Stephen's documents, dated to around 4 January 1136, at Reading. By Easter, both Pain and his brother Eustace had formally submitted to the king. Pain witnessed a royal charter at Oxford in April 1136. The king rewarded the brothers by continuing to appoint them to judicial functions, and confirmed grants made by them to various religious houses.|$|E
5|$|When Cleomenes {{heard about}} the revolt at Argos, he sent his {{stepfather}} with 2,000 men to try and save the situation. Megistonous was killed while assaulting the city, however, and the relief force retreated, leaving the Spartans in the citadel to continue resistance. Cleomenes abandoned his much stronger position at the Isthmus <b>for</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> encircled and left Corinth {{to fall into the}} hands of Antigonus. Cleomenes advanced his troops upon Argos and forced his way into the city, rescuing the men stuck in the citadel. He retreated to Mantinea when he saw Antigonus' army on the plain outside the city.|$|E

5|$|Wiesel was 16 when Buchenwald was liberated by the United States Army in April 1945, {{too late}} for his father, who died after a beating while Wiesel lay silently on the bunk above <b>for</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> beaten too. He moved to Paris {{after the war and}} in 1954 {{completed}} an 862-page manuscript in Yiddish about his experiences, published in Argentina as the 245-page Un di velt hot geshvign ("And the World Remained Silent"). The novelist François Mauriac helped him find a French publisher. Les Éditions de Minuit published 178 pages as La Nuit in 1958, and in 1960 Hill & Wang in New York published a 116-page translation as Night.|$|E
5|$|Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) {{is off to}} Philadelphia to {{interview}} at Jim Halpert's (John Krasinski) new company, Athlead, and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) decides to come along, since office manager Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) is still not back from his sailboat excursion. She asks Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) {{to take care of}} a shipment of pens while she has gone. Pam's lack of specific instructions leaves Erin in a state of indecision over whether she should put the pens away once they arrive. She eventually decides to put them away <b>for</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> called lazy, but as she does so the other office workers teasingly accuse her of trying to take over Pam's job of office administrator in her absence. Mortified, Erin puts the pens back in the shipping box.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Navy {{provided}} the anti-aircraft cruiser HMS Calcutta, 39 destroyers, {{and many other}} craft. The Merchant Navy supplied passenger ferries, hospital ships, and other vessels. Britain's Belgian, Dutch, Canadian, and French allies provided vessels as well. Admiral Ramsay arranged for around a thousand copies {{to be made of}} the required charts, had buoys laid around the Goodwin Sands and down to Dunkirk, and organised the flow of shipping. Larger ships such as destroyers were able to carry about 900 men per trip. The soldiers mostly travelled on the upper decks <b>for</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> trapped below if the ship sank. After the loss on 29 May of 19 British and French navy ships plus three of the larger requisitioned vessels, the Admiralty withdrew their eight best destroyers for the future defence of the country.|$|E
50|$|If {{the tournament}} is {{broadcast}} live when hole-card cameras are in use, the players and/or live audience must be sequestered from the commentators, <b>for</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> information <b>being</b> relayed {{to the players}} at the table.

5|$|When Sierk Coolsma {{opened a}} missionary school in Buitenzorg on 31 May 1869, Lie {{was in the}} first class of ten. Once again {{studying}} in Sundanese, he took similar subjects to his time in Cianjur. Around this time he began studying Dutch. After a government-run school opened in 1872, most of Lie's classmates were ethnic Chinese; the Sundanese students, mostly Muslim, had transferred to the new school <b>for</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> converted to Christianity. In 1873 Coolsma was sent to Sumedang to translate the Bible into Sundanese and was replaced by fellow missionary D. J. van der Linden. Studies resumed in Malay, as van der Linden was unable to speak Sundanese. Lie and his new headmaster soon became close. The two later worked together at van der Linden's school and publishing house and shared an interest in traditional theatre, including wayang (puppets).|$|E
5|$|Riker {{gets up to}} {{date with}} the situation, and decides that while Ramsey and his group are at large and refusing to leave the planet, there is little they can do. Before leaving they find that one of Beata's assistants, Ariel (Patricia McPherson), has married Ramsey, and was {{followed}} by Beata's guards to their camp, where they arrested the survivors and their families. The Away Team attempt to explain to Beata the reason for Ramsey's refusal to leave. Beata and her council reject his reasoning, and threatens to execute them the following day. After failing to convince Ramsey and his group to leave with them, Riker contacts the Enterprise, in hopes to transport Ramsey and his group without their consent (despite it being {{a violation of the}} Prime Directive, and almost certainly an end to his career), but Dr. Crusher (while treating an incapacitated Geordi in the Captain's chair) refuses to allow anyone to beam aboard <b>for</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> infected, but allows Data, as an android, to return. Riker orders Data to take command and get the Enterprise to the Neutral Zone before it's too late.|$|E
5|$|Spotted hyenas feature {{prominently}} in the rituals of certain African cultures. In the Gelede cult of the Yoruba people of Benin and Southwest Nigeria, a spotted hyena mask is used at dawn to signal {{the end of the}} èfè ceremony. As the spotted hyena usually finishes the meals of other carnivores, the animal is associated with the conclusion of all things. Among the Korè cult of the Bambara people in Mali, the belief that spotted hyenas are hermaphrodites appears as an ideal in-between in the ritual domain. The role of the spotted hyena mask in their rituals is often to turn the neophyte into a complete moral being by integrating his male principles with femininity. The Beng people believe that upon finding a freshly killed hyena with its anus inverted, one must plug it back in, <b>for</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> struck down with perpetual laughter. They also view spotted hyena faeces as contaminating, and will evacuate a village if a hyena relieves itself within village boundaries. In Harar, Ethiopia, spotted hyenas are regularly fed by the city's inhabitants, who believe the hyenas' presence keeps devils at bay, and associate mystical properties such as fortune telling to them.|$|E

30|$|The global welfare {{slightly}} decreases {{due to this}} policy. The {{disappearance of}} the direct impact of discrimination on wages within firms negatively affects {{the well-being of the}} majority group and increases the wage of Reds. Consequently, in a democratic system where economic agents maximize their revenues, the government will have no political incentive to reduce discrimination <b>for</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> not <b>being</b> re-elected.|$|R
50|$|Just {{when the}} Luos' case is closed, {{the team is}} {{assigned}} to another complex murder case.

50|$|In 1819 the Royal Navy {{created a}} naval station in West Africa at Freetown. This was {{the capital of}} the first British colony in West Africa, Sierra Leone.

From 1821, the squadron also used Ascension Island as a supply depot, before this moved to Cape Town in 1832.|$|R
25|$|Rwanda {{does not}} {{recognize}} same-sex marriages, civil unions or similar unions. Most gay {{people who have been}} interviewed stated that they are not open about their sexuality to their family <b>for</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> rejected.|$|E
