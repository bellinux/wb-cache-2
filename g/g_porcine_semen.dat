40|$|Results {{obtained}} in fertility and litter size using frozen-thawed <b>porcine</b> <b>semen</b> {{are far from}} those obtained with natural service or artificial insemination of cooled semen. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate freeze-thawing of <b>porcine</b> <b>semen</b> comparing the traditional slow method to a rapid curve of temperature descent, using two cryoprotectants. Six males of proven fertility (n= 6, r= 2) were used. Semen was obtained using the gloved-hand technique and was transported to the laboratory at 17 ºC diluted in Androstar® plus. Samples were centrifuged 15 minutes at 800 g and re-diluted in: a) 5 % dimethylformamide, 11 % lactose, 20 % egg yolk, 0. 5 % Equex or b) 3 % glycerol, 11 % lactose, 20 % egg yolk, 0. 5 % Equex. The semen was frozen in 0. 5 ml straws up to a final concentration of 300 millions sperm /ml using either a modified slow traditional Westendorff curve or a rapid curve. In both cases thawing was carried out at 37 ºC during 1 minute. Kinetic motility parameters were evaluated using a CASA system (ISAS v 1, Proiser®, Spain). Sperm viability and acrosome status were evaluated using the FITC-PNA/PI stain. The results were analyzed using a factorial design (analysis ofvariance) with two factors, with two levels for each one and using the male as a blocking factor. No interaction was observed between the parameters. No significant differences (p> 0. 05) were observed between curves or between cryoprotectants neither in any of the kinetic motility parameters evaluated nor in sperm viability and acrosome status. No significant differences (p> 0. 05) were observed between curves or between cryoprotectants in sperm morphology in thawed <b>porcine</b> <b>semen.</b> Taking into account the results obtained, the rapid curve would be the practical choice as it is, faster and more manageable for fieldwork in any pig farm...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effect of sperm and seminal plasma (SP) on the freezability of <b>porcine</b> <b>semen.</b> Semen of eight commercial males from two farms in the central-western region of Colombia (four boars in each farm) was frozen and tested to select two males with high freezability (MHF) and two with low freezability (MLF), according to the percentage of functionally competent sperm (FCS). Immediately after the collection was completed, the SP and sperm from the males selected were separated by centrifugation to combine the two types of plasma with the two types of sperm, incubate them for three hours and then freeze them. The variables evaluated were: sperm morphology, structural and functional integrity of plasmatic membrane, progressive and total motility, DNA fragmentation, acrosome integrity, capacitated sperm and FCS. The combination of sperm and plasma of MHF recorded the highest value (P< 0. 01) of acrosome integrity (24. 3 ± 0. 082 vs 6. 076 ± 0. 16) when compared to MLF plasma and cells. Membrane structural integrity was higher (P< 0. 01) with MHF (53. 56 ± 0. 0395) than with MLF plasma (47. 49 ± 0. 0419).

40|$|Dilution and {{extension}} of semen longevity {{has been widely}} used in the swine industry to improve reproductive efficiency and genetic progress through artificial insemination. Through the dilution {{and extension}} {{of the life of}} the sperm cell, other organisms such as bacteria are also maintained and can produce a negative impact on sperm cell motility and potential reproductive capacity. Bacterial contamination in <b>porcine</b> <b>semen</b> is a widespread problem in semen collection facilities and routinely testing is essential to determine which organisms are present and the effectiveness of the antimicrobial in the semen diluents (extender). The antibiotics used in <b>porcine</b> <b>semen</b> extenders are generally chosen to be effective against the most common bacterial contaminants, gram-negative bacteria. Two isolates, Achromobacter xylosoxidans (AX) and Ralstonia pickettii (RP), were identified in the water distillation system of a boar stud facility that uses this water to extend the raw semen and found to produce pyometras in sows post-insemination. The effects of these bacteria have not been investigated in <b>porcine</b> <b>semen</b> diluents in long term storage (14 days). The objective of this study was to determine the effects of AX and RP on pH, motility, and progressive motility in culture negative semen samples over a 14 day period in 3 different diluents (BTS: Beltsville Thawing Solution; XC: X-cell; and TXC: Tri-X-cell; IMV USA; Maple Grove, MN, USA) at 16 ??C. Banked isolates of AX and RP were grown on Columbia blood agar for 48 h at 37 ??C. For each isolate, a single colony was selected and transferred to 10 ml of Luria broth and then incubated for 24 h at 37 ??C in 5 % CO 2. The broth cultures were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 5 min. and used to make the final concentrations of approximately 2. 5 x 107 CFUs/ml (AX) and/or 2 x 106 CFUs/ml (RP). There were four treatment groups per extender: AX, RP, AX + RP, and Control (no bacteria added). All samples were incubated at 16 ??C and rotated once daily. Motility and morphology of all samples were viewed using the Computer Automated Semen Analysis Program (SpermVision??, Minitube of America, Verona, WI), and pH were measured daily for each sample. Data from 6 replicates were was analyzed using PROC MIXED (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) with repeated measurements divided into 5 time periods (1 - 2 d; 3 - 5 d; 6 - 8 d; 9 - 11 d; and 12 - 14 d) post-inoculation. Overall, sample pH did not significantly increase over time, but was found to be the highest (p 0. 05) drastically in the semen samples inoculated with RP+AX as compared to AX, RP or Control sample. The motility of the samples remained similar during the first week of incubations, but began dropping during period 4 (9 - 11 days) with the most notable decline during period 5 (12 - 14 days).

SM DNA was also detected in dogs with knee arthritis/degenerative anterior cruciate ligament rupture, in squirrel feces, in <b>porcine</b> <b>semen,</b> in bovine and ovine milk, and from the gastrointestinal tract of laboratory animals. In veterinary medicine, trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole resistant SM strains have been observed from horses, dogs and cats with chronic respiratory disease and urinary tract infections.

Comparison of the G 9 VP 7 gene sequences showed that the <b>porcine</b> <b>G</b> 9 strains were more closely related to human G 9 strains reemerging globally since the mid- 1990 s than to those from the mid- 1980 s.

40|$|Abstract. The oviduct {{plays a role}} in {{successful}} {{animal reproduction}} not only in spermatozoa and ova transport to the fertilization site but also by affording a microenvironment for fertilization and early embryonic development. The sperm reservoir (SR) is restricted in the uterotubal junction (UTJ) and caudal isthmus. Billions of porcine spermatozoa are distributed to the female reproductive tract during/after insemination, and small amounts of them are stored for about 36 – 40 hours in the SR, which maintains sperm viability in the pre-ovulation period through its surface epithelium and production of fluid. The SR regulates the release of spermatozoa so that only a small population moves towards the fertilization site (ampulla) to decrease polyspermy. This review attempts to provide information about the structure and function of the porcine SR, its intraluminal content (hyaluronan, HA), and the influences of HA on porcine spermatozoa in vivo. In pigs, the spermatozoa are stored in a mucous-like fluid within the UTJ and caudal isthmus in the pre-ovulation period. The oviduct fluid contains sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and non-sulfated GAGs, i. e., HA. It {{is interesting to note that}} HA is synthesized by hyaluronan synthase- 3 (HAS- 3), and its receptor, CD 44, is found in the epithelium of the porcine SR site. Additionally, sperm capacitation does not occur in vivo in the SR during the pre- and peri-ovulation periods, but spermatozoa in the SR will attempt to capacitate if exposed to bicarbonate. However, capacitation in the SR will rise in the post-ovulation period, indicating the role of HA in modulating sperm capacitation after ovulation. All data support the understanding that the porcine SR ensures the viability of fertile spermatozoa and maintains the non-capacitated status during the pre-ovulation period. This basic knowledge about the SR is believed to be useful to advance sperm preparation procedures for in vitro fertilization (IVF) and improve the preservation process of <b>porcine</b> <b>semen...</b>|$|R
40|$|Restenosis is {{the main}} {{drawback}} of percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). Recently, drug-eluting stents (DES) were introduced successfully in clinical practice leading to a drop in the post-angioplasty restenosis rate. Nevertheless, safety and efficacy concerns related to the active compounds of such stents still exist. This thesis aimed at the development of a local delivery system, in combination with the cuff-induced mouse model of neointima formation, in order to closely mimic the DES mode-of-action and to further answer to such remaining questions related to this novel technology. Altogether, these comprehensive studies on efficacy and safety of anti-restenotic compounds using a novel developed mouse model of neointimal hyperplasia have resulted in a thorough understanding of the mode-of-action of these anti-restenotic drugs on neointimal hyperplasia inhibition as well as to further assess the potential adverse effects on vessel wall biology and on the (treated) pre-existing underlying atherosclerotic lesions. Especially the discovery of novel anti-restenotic strategies to be used in combination with the DES technology is of specially importance for further preclinical studies in more advance animal models of restenosis (e. <b>g.</b> <b>porcine</b> coronary artery model) as well as directly in the field of interventional cardiology per se.

40|$|Interferon is a {{principal}} component of the host antiviral defense system. In this study, abortive focus formation by Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) in primate cells was accompanied by early interferon induction, while productive focus formation in porcine cells {{was associated with a}} late interferon response. Neutralization antibodies against interferon relieved the restricted infection in primate cells, and increasingly larger foci were generated as treatment with exogenous interferon was delayed, thereby establishing a solid correlation between interferon response and viral dissemination. However, delayed interferon induction in JEV-infected porcine cells occurred in the absence of active inhibition by the virus. We further demonstrated that JEV mediates interferon activation through double-stranded RNA and cytosolic pattern recognition receptors. Immunofluorescence and subcellular fractionation studies revealed that double-stranded RNA is concealed in intracellular membranes at an early phase of infection but eventually appears in the cytosol at later periods, which could then allow detection by cytosolic pattern recognition receptors. Interestingly, cytosolic exposure of double-stranded RNA was delayed in porcine cells compared to primate cells, independent of total double-stranded RNA levels and in correlation with the timing of the interferon response. Furthermore, when double-stranded RNA was artificially introduced into the cytosol of porcine cells, more rapid and robust interferon activation was triggered than in viral infection. Thus, cytosolic exposure of JEV double-stranded RNA is imperative for interferon induction, but in cell lines (e. <b>g.,</b> <b>porcine</b> cells) with delayed emergence of cytosolic double-stranded RNA, the interferon response is late and viral dissemination is consequently enhanced...|$|R

Plasma testosterone levels, measured at 10 -day intervals, were similar among groups of boars throughoutthe study. Body weights among groups were similar during treatment, and testicularweight between treatment {{groups did not differ}} at castration (100 days of age). However, total length of the seminiferous tubule per testis in FSH-treated boars was 59 % greater than in GH-treated animals (2705 vs. 1704 m; p < 0. 05).

Relative mass of spermatocytes and spermatids in GH-treated animals exceeded that in controls by 2. 5 -fold and that in FSH boars by 75 -fold (p = 0. 05). There were no differences in effects of GH + FSH treatment as compared to control treatment; none of the treatments affected any interstitial tissue parameter measured.

There is no prior {{experience with this}} technique in weightlessness, such as on the International Space Station, where sonography is currently the only diagnostic imaging tool. STUDY DESIGN: A ground-based (1 <b>g)</b> <b>porcine</b> model for sonography was developed. We examined both the feasibility and the comparative performance of the FAST examination in parabolic flight. Sonographic detection and fluid behavior were evaluated in four animals during alternating weightlessness (0 g) and hypergravity (1. 8 g) periods. During flight, boluses of fluid were incrementally introduced into the peritoneal cavity. Standardized sonographic windows were recorded. Postflight, the video recordings were divided into 169 20 -second segments for subsequent interpretation by 12 blinded ultrasonography experts. Reviewers first decided whether a video segment was of sufficient diagnostic quality to analyze (determinate). Determinate segments were then analyzed as containing or not containing fluid. A probit regression model compared {{the probability of a}} positive fluid diagnosis to actual fluid levels (0 to 500 mL) under both 0 -g and 1. 8 -g conditions. RESULTS: The in-flight sonographers found real-time scanning and interpretation technically similar to that of terrestrial conditions, as long as restraint was maintained. On blinded review, 80 % of the recorded ultrasound segments were considered determinate. The best sensitivity for diagnosis in 0 g was found to be from the subhepatic space, with probability of a positive fluid diagnosis ranging from 9 % (no fluid) to 51 % (500 mL fluid).

Before porcine grafts can be used clinically, strategies to prevent neural xenograft rejection must be developed. Knowledge on how human T lymphocytes recognize porcine embryonic neural tissue would facilitate the development of such strategies. To investigate the ability of porcine embryonic brain microvascular endothelial cells (PBMEC) to stimulate human T-cell proliferation, PBMEC were immuno-magnetically isolated and cocultured with purified human CD 4 or CD 8 single-positive T cells. PBMEC had a cobblestone-like growth pattern and expressed the endothelial cell markers CD 31 and CD 106. PBMEC stimulated with the supernatant of phytohemagglutinin-activated porcine peripheral blood mononuclear cells or porcine IFN-gamma, but not nonstimulated PBMEC, induced proliferation of both CD 8 and CD 4 T cells as assessed by [H- 3]thymidine incorporation. Flow cytometric analyses showed that the degree of CD 8 and CD 4 T cell proliferation correlated with the expression levels of class I and 11 major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens, respectively. PBMEC expressed a CTLA- 4 /Fc-reactive molecule, most likely CD 86, suggesting that these cells are able to deliver a costimulatory signal to the T cells. Human TNF-alpha, but not human IFN-gamma, induced class I, but not class II, MHC expression on PBMEC.

Escape mutants with an amino acid substitution in antigenic region A (amino acids [aa] 87 to 101) {{resulting in a}} residue identical or chemically similar to those present at the same positions in serotype G 3 strains, at positions 87 for strain A 253 and 96 for strain YM, were significantly more sensitive than the parental strains to neutralization with sera against some serotype G 3 strains. Also, one YM antigenic variant (YM- 5 E 6. 1) acquired reactivity by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with MAbs 159, 57 / 8, and YO- 1 E 2, which react with G 3 strains, {{but not with the}} serotype G 11 parental strain YM. Cross-adsorption studies suggested that the observed cross-neutralization by the G 3 -specific sera was due to the sera containing antibodies reactive with the parental strain plus antibodies reactive with the epitope(s) on the antigenic variant that mimick the serotype G 3 specific one(s). Moreover, antibodies reactive with antigenic region F (aa 235 to 242) of VP 7 might also be involved since cross-reactivity to serotype G 3 was decreased in double mutants carrying an additional mutation, which creates a potential glycosylation site at position 238. Thus, single point mutations can affect the serotype reactivity of <b>G</b> 11 <b>porcine</b> rotavirus strains with both monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies and may explain the origin of rotavirus strains with dual serotype specificity based on sequence divergence of VP 7...|$|R
40|$|The lack {{of human}} donor organs in {{allotransplantation}} {{has led to}} a proposal for the use of animal organs (e. g. pigs) as alternative therapeutic material for humans. Besides immunological problems like rejection and physiological incompatibility of the transplant, one of the major concerns is the transmission of <b>porcine</b> viruses, e. <b>g.</b> <b>porcine</b> circoviruses (PCV), and the existance of a human circovirus that may recombine with porcine circoviruses resulting in a new virus. To assess the risk of a putative new zoonosis, a consensusprimer-PCR has been established to search for a human circovirus and infection studies with human cell-lines were carried out. Circoviruses are characterised by small single-stranded circular DNA genomes and non-enveloped capsids. Porcine Circovirus type 1 and 2 (PCV 1 / 2) belong to the genus Circovirus of the family Circoviridae. While PCV 1 is apathogen, PCV 2 is the etiological agent of Postweaning Multisystemic Wasting Syndrome (PMWS), a new emerging disease in pigs. In this study I established a consensusprimer-PCR to search for a human circovirus; the degenerate primers used in this PCR amplify highly-conserved regions of the rep-gene of all known circoviruses. With this method a new pigeon circovirus (PiCV) could be identified and characterised, while the investigation of 1101 human samples resulted in no detection of a human circovirus. Furthermore, in this thesis PCV susceptibility of human cell-lines was carried out by transfection with religated virus-DNA of PCV and by infection with virus stocks. Infection with PCV 1 and 2 was detected by PCR and indirect immunofluorescence assay. As a result, the transfection and the infection studies both resulted in expression of viral protein in different human cells. In addition, further experiments showed that PCV 2 induces apoptosis in human cells. Experiments analysing the role of viral gene products in induction of apoptosis will be presented in this work...|$|R

40|$|Fecal {{specimens}} from 78 calves {{involved in}} outbreaks of calf diarrhea which occurred in three farms in Victoria, Australia, in 1988 were analyzed for rotaviruses. Thirty-eight samples were positive for group A virus antigen by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and 20 of these contained viral double-stranded RNAs {{that could be}} detected by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Two major electropherotypes could be observed, and a representative isolate of each electropherotype (isolates B- 11 and B- 60) was successfully adapted to grow in MA 104 cells. Sequencing of the VP 7 genes directly from RNA transcripts of fecal and cell culture-adapted viruses demonstrated that no base changes occurred in this gene upon adaptation to growth in MA 104 cells. Sequencing also revealed that the VP 7 protein of B- 60 was closely related to G serotype 6 (G 6) strains, whereas the B- 11 sequence was significantly different from all previously published sequences except the recently reported VP 7 sequences of bovine isolates 61 A and B 223, particularly across the antigenic regions A, B, and C. The other strains most closely related to B- 11 by VP 7 amino acid sequence analysis were <b>G</b> 4 <b>porcine</b> strains BMI- 1 and BEN- 144 and G 8 human strain 69 M. Serotyping of B- 11 and B- 60 gave results that were in good agreement with the sequencing data.

40|$|Background: T cell epitope {{prediction}} {{tools and}} associated vaccine design algorithms have accelerated {{the development of}} vaccines for humans. Predictive tools for swine and other food animals are not as well developed, primarily because the data required to develop the tools are lacking. Here, we overcome a lack of T cell epitope data to construct swine epitope predictors by systematically leveraging available human information. Applying the “pocket profile method”, we use sequence and structural similarities in the binding pockets of human and swine major histocompatibility complex proteins to infer Swine Leukocyte Antigen (SLA) peptide binding preferences. We developed epitope-prediction matrices (PigMatrices), for three SLA class I alleles (SLA- 1 * 0401, 2 * 0401 and 3 * 0401) and one class II allele (SLA-DRB 1 * 0201), based on the binding preferences of the best-matched Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) pocket for each SLA pocket. The contact residues involved in the binding pockets were defined for class I based on crystal structures of either SLA (SLA-specific contacts, Ssc) or HLA supertype alleles (HLA contacts, Hc); for class II, only Hc was possible. Different substitution matrices were evaluated (PAM and BLOSUM) for scoring pocket similarity and identifying the best human match. The accuracy of the PigMatrices was compared to available online swine epitope prediction tools such as PickPocket and NetMHCpan. Results: PigMatrices that used Ssc to define the pocket sequences and PAM 30 to score pocket similarity demonstrated the best predictive performance {{and were able to}} accurately separate binders from random peptides. For SLA- 1 * 0401 and 2 * 0401, PigMatrix achieved area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) of 0. 78 and 0. 73, respectively, which were equivalent or better than PickPocket (0. 76 and 0. 54) and NetMHCpan version 2. 4 (0. 41 and 0. 51) and version 2. 8 (0. 72 and 0. 71). In addition, we developed the first predictive SLA class II matrix, obtaining an AUC of 0. 73 for existing SLA-DRB 1 * 0201 epitopes. Notably, PigMatrix achieved this level of predictive power without training on SLA binding data. Conclusions: Overall, the pocket profile method combined with binding preferences from HLA binding data shows significant promise for developing T cell epitope prediction tools for pigs. When combined with existing vaccine design algorithms, PigMatrix will be useful for developing genome-derived vaccines for a range of pig pathogens for which no effective vaccines currently exist (e. <b>g.</b> <b>porcine</b> reproductive and respiratory syndrome, influenza and porcine epidemic diarrhea) ...|$|R

40|$|On {{the basis}} of {{antigenic}} variability in the VP 7 outer capsid glycoprotein, at least 14 G serotypes exist for group A rotaviruses. Serotypic diversity exists among bovine rotaviruses (BRV), with serotypes G 1, G 6, G 8, and G 10 reported for cattle. Although G 1 and G 8 rotaviruses were originally described for humans, the recent isolation of G 6 and G 10 rotaviruses from humans further emphasizes the serotypic similarity between human and bovine rotaviruses and the possible zoonotic potential of rotaviruses. Results of our previous {{studies have indicated that}} more than 24 % of BRV-positive field samples from diarrheic calves were nonreactive with cDNA probes or monoclonal antibodies to serotypes G 6, G 8, and G 10. In this study, cDNA probes were prepared by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the hyperdivergent regions of the VP 7 genes (nucleotides 51 to 392) from human (G 1, G 2, and <b>G</b> 3) and <b>porcine</b> (<b>G</b> 4, G 5, and G 11) rotaviruses. These probes were used in a dot blot hybridization assay to further characterize the G types of 59 BRV strains (fecal samples from diarrheic calves in Ohio, Nebraska, Washington, and South Dakota) that were nonreactive with cDNA probes to G 6, G 8, and G 10. Rotaviruses belonging to serotypes G 1 (n = 7), G 2 (n = 1), G 3 (n = 2), and G 11 (n = 3) were identified among the BRV field samples. The BRV associated with these G types accounted for 22 % of the samples tested; the other 78 % of these samples remained untypeable with these probes.

40|$|The {{rotavirus}} {{non-structural protein}} NSP 4 has {{been implicated in}} a number of biological functions during the rotavirus cellular cycle and pathogenesis, and has been addressed as a target for vaccine development. The NSP 4 gene has been classified into six genotypes (A-F). A semi-nested triplex PCR was developed for genotyping the major human NSP 4 genotypes (A-C), which are common in human rotavirus strains but are also shared among most mammalian rotavirus strains. A total of 192 previously characterized human strains representing numerous G and P type specificities (such as G 1 P[8], G 1 P[4], G 2 P[4], G 3 P[3], G 3 P[8], G 3 P[9], G 4 P[6], G 4 P[8], G 6 P[4], G 6 P[9], G 6 P[14], G 8 P[10], G 8 P[14], G 9 P[8], G 9 P[11], G 10 P[11], G 12 P[6] and G 12 P[8]) were tested for NSP 4 specificity by the collaborating laboratories. An additional 35 animal strains, including the reference laboratory strains SA 11 (simian, G 3 P[2]), NCDV (bovine, G 6 P[1]), K 9 and CU- 1 (canine, G 3 P[3]), together with 31 field isolates (canine, G 3 P[3]; feline, <b>G</b> 3 P[9]; <b>porcine,</b> <b>G</b> 2 P[23], G 3 P[6], G 4 P[6], G 5 P[6], G 5 P[7], G 5 P[26], G 5 P[27], G 9 P[6] and G 9 P[7]) were also successfully NSP 4 -typed. Four human G 3 P[9] strains and one feline G 3 P[9] strain were found to possess an NSP 4 A genotype, instead of NSP 4 C, suggesting a reassortment event between heterologous strains. Routine NSP 4 genotyping may help to determine the genomic constellation of rotaviruses of man and livestock, and identify interspecies transmission of heterologous strains...|$|R
