5|$|Surface feeders that swim {{often have}} unique bills as well, adapted for their {{specific}} prey. Prions have special bills with filters called lamellae to <b>filter</b> <b>out</b> plankton from mouthfuls of water, and many albatrosses and petrels have hooked bills to snatch fast-moving prey. Gulls have more generalised bills that reflect their more opportunistic lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|The lungs {{also serve}} a {{protective}} role. Several blood-borne substances, {{such as a}} few types of prostaglandins, leukotrienes, serotonin and bradykinin, are excreted through the lungs. Drugs and other substances can be absorbed, modified or excreted in the lungs. The lungs <b>filter</b> <b>out</b> small blood clots from veins and prevent them from entering arteries and causing strokes.|$|E
5|$|Zobel and Carson {{helped to}} {{establish}} the nature of noise in electric circuits, concluding that—contrary to mainstream belief—it is not even theoretically possible to <b>filter</b> <b>out</b> noise entirely and that noise {{will always be a}} limiting factor in what is possible to transmit. Thus, they anticipated the later work of Claude Shannon, who showed how the theoretical information rate of a channel is related to the noise of the channel.|$|E

5|$|Follow-up imaging {{took place}} on July 2, 2009 and August 30, 2010 using the same instruments, as astronomers hoped to reveal this {{companion}} object's proper motion, or the rate that it moves over time. Additional follow-up data was recovered {{in the spring and}} summer of 2010, but large errors in the data's astrometry led the investigating astronomers to disregard it. The observations over the three years was compiled, with the data used to <b>filter</b> <b>out</b> pixelated portions of the images and improve the images' quality. The result suggested not only that the faint object in the image was nearby the star HIP 78530, but that it was a brown dwarf or planet in size. Further study would be needed to prove its true nature.|$|E
5|$|Nemertea use organs called protonephridia to excrete soluble waste products, {{especially}} nitrogenous by-products {{of cellular}} metabolism. In nemertean protonephridia, flame cells which <b>filter</b> <b>out</b> the wastes {{are embedded in}} the front part of the two lateral fluid vessels. The flame cells remove the wastes into two collecting ducts, one on either side, and each duct has one or more nephridiopores through which the wastes exit. Semiterrestrial and freshwater nemerteans have many more flame cells than marines, sometimes thousands. The {{reason may be that}} osmoregulation is more difficult in non-marine environments.|$|E
5|$|Pinnipeds have {{a simple}} stomach that is similar in {{structure}} to terrestrial carnivores. Most species have neither a cecum nor a clear demarcation between the small and large intestines; the large intestine is comparatively short and only slightly wider than the latter. Small intestine lengths range from 8 (California sea lion) to 25 times (elephant seal) the body length. The length of the intestine may be an adaptation to frequent deep diving, as the increased volume of the digestive tract serves as an extended storage compartment for partially digested food during submersion. Pinnipeds {{do not have an}} appendix. As in most marine mammals, the kidneys are divided into small lobes and can effectively absorb water and <b>filter</b> <b>out</b> excess salt.|$|E

5|$|Unfortunately, episode 1 of The Mind of Evil {{contains}} no colour information. In principle, BBC engineers {{were supposed to}} <b>filter</b> <b>out</b> the chroma dots upon telerecording, to create a cleaner and nicer picture. In most cases they {{failed to do so}} properly, allowing the colour recovery process to work. For this one episode, the filter had been correctly applied – so there was no colour to recover. To complete the serial for DVD, the episode was manually colourised by Stuart Humphryes and Peter Crocker – thereby returning the final Pertwee episode to its original colour presentation.|$|E
5|$|Balaenids rely {{on their}} huge heads, {{as opposed to the}} rorquals' throat pleats, to feed effectively. This feeding {{behavior}} allows them to grow very big and bulky, without the necessity for a streamlined body. They have callosities, unlike other whales, {{with the exception of the}} bowhead whale. Rorquals have a higher proportion of muscle tissue and tend to be negatively buoyant, whereas right whales have a higher proportion of blubber and are positively buoyant. Gray whales are easily distinguished from other extant cetaceans by their sleet-gray color, dorsal ridges (knuckles on the back), and their gray-white scars left from parasites. As with the rorquals, their throat pleats increase the capacity of their throats, allowing them to filter larger volumes of water at once. Gray whales are bottom-feeders, meaning they sift through sand to get their food. They usually turn on their sides, scoop up sediment into their mouths and <b>filter</b> <b>out</b> benthic creatures like amphipods, which leave noticeable marks on their heads.|$|E
5|$|Later, between 2009 and 2011, {{another team}} of astronomers {{observed}} WASP-13b and WASP-21b {{to find what}} caused some Hot Jupiters to have anomalously high radii. The RISE photometric camera on the Liverpool Telescope was used to detect further transits. Two partial transits and two full transits were observed during this period, although the quality of both full transits was slightly compromised because of passing cloud cover. The collected observations, along with the JGT observations {{that were used to}} confirm the planet, were scaled to <b>filter</b> <b>out</b> errors such as background noise. The data was then used to re-define WASP-13b's parameters, including its age, mass, radius, and density. The study also noted that a limb darkening effect was present, a characteristic that may affect future atmospheric studies of the planet.|$|E

5|$|The {{brain is}} {{a ring of}} four ganglia, {{positioned}} around the rhynchocoel near its front end. At least a pair of ventral nerve cords connect to the brain and run {{along the length of}} the body. Most nemerteans have various chemoreceptors, and on their heads some species have a number of pigment-cup ocelli. These ocelli can detect light but can not form an image. Nemerteans respire through the skin. They have at least two lateral vessels which are joined at the ends to form a loop, and these and the rhynchocoel are filled with fluid. There is no heart, and the flow of fluid depends on contraction of muscles in the vessels and the body wall. To <b>filter</b> <b>out</b> soluble waste products, flame cells are embedded in the front part of the two lateral fluid vessels, and remove the wastes through a network of pipes to the outside.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of a von Neumann computer depended {{on the availability of}} a suitable memory device on which to store the program. During the Second World War researchers working on the problem of removing the clutter from radar signals had developed a form of delay line memory, the first practical application of which was the mercury delay line, developed by J. Presper Eckert. Radar transmitters send out regular brief pulses of radio energy, the reflections from which are displayed on a CRT screen. As operators are usually interested only in moving targets, it was desirable to <b>filter</b> <b>out</b> any distracting reflections from stationary objects. The filtering was achieved by comparing each received pulse with the previous pulse, and rejecting both if they were identical, leaving a signal containing only the images of any moving objects. To store each received pulse for later comparison it was passed through a transmission line, delaying it by exactly the time between transmitted pulses.|$|E
5|$|The toxins {{found in}} Galerina marginata {{are known as}} amatoxins. Amatoxins belong to a family of bicyclic octapeptide {{derivatives}} composed of an amino acid ring bridged by a sulfur atom and characterized by differences in their side groups; these compounds are responsible for more than 90% of fatal mushroom poisonings in humans. The amatoxins inhibit the enzyme RNA polymerase II, which copies the genetic code of DNA into messenger RNA molecules. The toxin naturally accumulates in liver cells, and the ensuing disruption of metabolism accounts for the severe liver dysfunction cause by amatoxins. Amatoxins also lead to kidney failure because, as the kidneys attempt to <b>filter</b> <b>out</b> poison, it damages the convoluted tubules and reenters the blood to recirculate and cause more damage. Initial symptoms after ingestion include severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea which may last for six to nine hours. Beyond these symptoms, toxins severely affect the liver which results in gastrointestinal bleeding, a coma, kidney failure, or even death, usually within seven days of consumption.|$|E

In 1980, for example, San Jose, California, replaced all street lamps with low pressure sodium lamps, whose light is easier for nearby Lick Observatory to <b>filter</b> <b>out.</b> Similar programs are now in place in Arizona and Hawaii. Such yellow light sources also have significantly less visual skyglow impact, so reduce visual sky brightness and improve star visibility for everyone.|$|E
