25|$|At room {{temperature}} and standard pressure, methane is a colorless, odorless gas.

Methane has a boiling point of −161 °C (−257.8 °F) at a pressure of one atmosphere. As a gas it is flammable over a range of concentrations (5.4–17%) in air at standard pressure.|$|E

In Japan, where space in <b>homes</b> <b>is</b> more limited, N scale is the most popular scale, and HO scale is considered large. Not all modellers select N because they have small spaces; some use N scale to build more complex or more visually expansive models.|$|E

2500|$|The last Sears Modern <b>Homes</b> catalog <b>was</b> {{issued in}} 1940.

Many of these <b>homes</b> <b>were</b> based on models from the 1940 and earlier Sears catalogs but not all were, leading to debate over whether these homes qualify as [...] "Sears Catalog Homes". Because these <b>homes</b> <b>were</b> constructed using pre-cut lumber and plans provided by Sears, these <b>homes</b> <b>are</b> considered to also be [...] "Sears Catalog Homes". Many of these <b>homes</b> <b>were</b> built in Sears planned [...] "Home Club Plan" [...] developments in New Jersey, New York and Ohio. <b>Homes</b> <b>were</b> also built for industrial firms like Bethlehem Steel which purchased and constructed 61 Sears homes in Hellertown, Pennsylvania.|$|R

25|$|Elderspeak can in fact {{contribute}} to decreased comprehension, and can increase confusion. Early social scientists first identified elderspeak and estimated that 20% {{of the communication}} occurring in nursing <b>homes</b> <b>is</b> actually elderspeak (Caporael, 1981). Caretakers of nursing home residents must be particularly careful when using elderspeak. Although elderspeak {{has been shown to}} help older adults with dementia and Alzheimer’s in language comprehension, they are not immune to feeling disrespected when it is used. Resisting care is an ongoing problem with dementia patients, as well as violent behaviour, and residents of nursing homes are more likely to resist care when their nurse uses elderspeak. Care givers may assume that the elder prefers the nurturing of elderspeak but older adults think of it as demeaning. Older adults in both institutional settings and those receiving home care services report that as many as 40% of their caregivers use speech they perceive as demeaning, and 75% of the interactions that elderly people have are with the staff of the nursing homes.|$|E
25|$|The International Council Of Nursing (ICN), {{the largest}} {{international}} health professional {{organization in the}} world, recognizes the shortage of nurses as a growing crisis in the world. This shortage impacts the healthcare of everyone worldwide. One of the many reasons is that nurses who pursue to become nurses do so very late in their lives. This leads to a non-lengthy employment time. A national survey prepared by the Federation of Nurses and Health Professionals in 2001 found that one in five nurses plans to leave the profession within five years because of unsatisfactory working conditions, including low pay, severe under staffing, high stress, physical demands, mandatory overtime, and irregular hours. Approximately 29.8 percent of all nursing jobs are found in hospitals. However, because of administrative cost cutting, increased nurse's workload, and rapid growth of outpatient services, hospital nursing jobs will experience slower than average growth. Employment in home care and nursing <b>homes</b> <b>is</b> expected to grow rapidly. Though more people are living well into their 80s and 90s, many need the kind of long-term care available at a nursing home. Many nurses will also be needed to help staff {{the growing number of}} out-patient facilities, such as HMOs, group medical practices, and ambulatory surgery centers. Nursing specialties will be in great demand. There are, in addition, many part-time employment possibilities.|$|E
500|$|Category5 is {{the highest}} {{category}} of the Saffir–Simpson scale. These storms cause complete roof failure on many residences and industrial buildings, and some complete building failures with small utility buildings blown over or away. Collapse of many wide-span roofs and walls, especially those with no interior supports, is common. Very heavy and irreparable damage to many wood frame structures and total destruction to mobile/manufactured <b>homes</b> <b>is</b> prevalent. Only a few types of structures are capable of surviving intact, and only if located at least [...] inland. They include office, condominium and apartment buildings and hotels that are of solid concrete or steel frame construction, public multi-story concrete parking garages, and residences that are made of either reinforced brick or concrete/cement block and have hipped roofs with slopes of no less than 35degrees from horizontal and no overhangs of any kind, and if the windows are either made of hurricane-resistant safety glass or covered with shutters. Unless all of these requirements are met, the absolute destruction of a structure is certain.|$|E

50|$|In 1988, Colonial Street was {{overhauled}} for Tom Hanks comedy The 'Burbs. The old Leave It to Beaver <b>home</b> <b>was</b> removed, {{as large}} <b>homes</b> <b>were</b> {{required for the}} movie. Following the movie, the <b>homes</b> <b>were</b> rearranged again so Circle Drive was connected once again. In 1996, a new Leave it to Beaver house was built for the 1997 movie (called the Morrison Home), replacing <b>homes</b> that <b>were</b> built for The 'Burbs movie. Also during this time, the Providence <b>home</b> <b>was</b> built (called the Klopeck House Building). Colonial Street remained unchanged until 2004, when Desperate Housewives used the street for its series production, giving it the name Wisteria Lane.

2500|$|A major draw to Northern Michigan is tourism. Real estate, {{especially}} condominiums {{and summer}} <b>homes,</b> <b>is</b> another {{significant source of}} income.

50|$|Catalog <b>homes</b> <b>were</b> {{mail-order}} kits from Sears Roebuck and Company {{and other}} companies. “Kit” <b>homes</b> <b>were</b> delivered by rail and pieced {{together by the}} owner. The reason for the popularity of kit <b>homes</b> <b>was</b> threefold. The <b>homes</b> <b>were</b> fairly easy to finance, the kits supplied all or {{nearly all of the}} supplies needed to build the home and they mimicked nearly every popular style. One significant advantage of the catalog <b>homes</b> <b>was</b> the ease with which they could be added onto. If the house was built between 1900 and 1940 and bears a resemblance to a particular style, but has differences, it still may <b>be</b> a catalog <b>home.</b>|$|R

2500|$|There {{architecture}} in traditional <b>homes</b> <b>is</b> similar to Coast Salish style dwellings called a [...] "longhouse."

50|$|In September 1936, all 25 <b>homes</b> <b>were</b> {{ready for}} occupancy. The <b>homes</b> <b>were</b> very simple.
