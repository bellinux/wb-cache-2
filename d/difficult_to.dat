5|$|Other predators {{attack the}} adults {{while they are}} {{foraging}} or traveling to satellite nests. It is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> {{determine the number of}} adults that are killed away from the nest because they are <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> track. However, it has been observed that the queen's flight to the satellite nest isn't dangerous and does not reduce its survivability.|$|E
5|$|A 15-year-old elephant, Ellie May, had {{acquired}} an undeserved {{reputation for being}} dangerous, which made her extremely <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> sell. Her food costs became <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> justify, but Grayson refused to have her put down. Although he left the zoo in January 1978, Grayson returned frequently to care for Ellie May, the last animal left at the zoo. Eventually Rotterdam Zoo agreed to take her, and plans were made to transport the elephant to the Netherlands. Ellie May refused to budge however, and overnight developed pneumonia and heart failure. Grayson and veterinary surgeon, David Taylor, felt {{that she would not}} recover, and decided to call in a marksman to euthanise her.|$|E

5|$|Although {{tickets for}} the Masters are not expensive, they are very <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> come by. Even the {{practice}} rounds can be <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> get into. Applications for practice round tickets {{have to be made}} nearly a year in advance and the successful applicants are chosen by random ballot. Tickets to the actual tournament are sold only to members of a patrons list, which is closed. A waiting list for the patrons list was opened in 1972 and closed in 1978. It was reopened in 2000 and subsequently closed once again. In 2008, the Masters also began allowing children (between the ages of 8 and 16) to enter on tournament days free if they are accompanied by the patron who is the owner of his or her badge.|$|E
5|$|As a halogen, {{astatine}} {{tends to}} be classified as a nonmetal. It has some marked metallic properties and is sometimes instead classified as either a metalloid or (less often) as a metal. Immediately following its production in 1940, early investigators considered it a metal. In 1949 {{it was called the}} most noble (<b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> reduce) nonmetal as well as being a relatively noble (<b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> oxidize) metal. In 1950 astatine was described as a halogen and (therefore) a reactive nonmetal. In 2013, on the basis of relativistic modelling, astatine was predicted to be a monatomic metal, with a face-centred cubic crystalline structure.|$|E
