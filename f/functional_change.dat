25|$|The {{main feature}} change was support for Microsoft's 64-bit {{operating}} system, however support for Banyan VINES was also dropped from {{this version of}} MDAC. There were several known issues: MDAC 2.7 continued causing connectivity problems on clustered servers running Microsoft SQL Server 6.5 or SQL Server 7.0, with no workaround provided by Microsoft. When creating or configuring ODBC data source names (DSNs) using the Microsoft SQL Server ODBC driver the network library protocol might unexpectedly switch to TCP/IP, even if the DSN was configured to use named pipes. This issue was found by InfoWorld reporter Randall C. Kennedy, who identified that the change was actually made in MDAC 2.6 but was never documented. It was discovered when testing client/server database workloads on a Windows XP computer; InfoWorld claims that although overall server CPU utilization rose by only 8 percent using TCP/IP, context switches per second dropped by more than 150 percent (which is of course impossible because you would then have a negative context switch rate - the drop is either 33% or 60% depending on which planet the author was on {{at the time of}} writing) for a 10-user workload. They were unimpressed that a fundamental <b>functional</b> <b>change</b> to the default behaviour of Net-Lib occurred without more than a passing mention in an unrelated document. Windows XP users also sometimes experienced problems connecting to SQL Server because SQL Server attempts to use certificates it finds on the local computer, however if {{there is more than one}} certificate available it did not know which one to use. When attempting to use Microsoft Analysis Services 2000 RTM, an error would sometimes appear when trying to browse cubes. Microsoft also discovered a problem in Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows Me's setup program which prevented the MDAC installation program from rolling back when it encountered an installation error.|$|E

50|$|Central chromatolysis {{has been}} {{observed}} in spinal anterior horn and motor neurons of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Patients with ALS appear to have significant alterations that occur within the chromatolyzed neuronal cells. These alterations include dense conglomerates of aggregated dark mitochondria and presynaptic vesicles, bundles of neurofilaments, and a marked increase of presynaptic vesicles. Changes to {{the function of the}} motor neurons have also been observed. The most typical <b>functional</b> <b>change</b> in chromatolytic motor neurons is the significant reduction in size of the monosynaptic excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs). These monosynaptic EPSPs also seem to be prolonged in the chromatolyzed cells of ALS patients. This <b>functional</b> <b>change</b> to the anterior horn neurons could result in the elimination of certain excitatory synaptic inputs and thus give rise to the clinical motor function impairment that is characteristic of the ALS disease.|$|E

40|$|Accurate {{quantification}} of {{the contribution}} of environmental variability and <b>functional</b> <b>changes</b> to the interannual variability of net ecosystem production (NEP) and evapotranspiration (ET) in coniferous forests is needed to understand global carbon and water cycling. This study quantified these contributions to the interannual variability of NEP and ET for a subtropical coniferous plantation in southeastern China, {{and the effect of}} drought stress on these contributions was also investigated. NEP and ET were derived from eddy covariance measurements carried out over the period 2003 - 2012. A homogeneity-of-slopes model was adopted to quantify the contribution to the interannual variability of these fluxes. Environmental variability accounted for 71 % and 85. 7 % of the interannual variability of NEP and ET, respectively; however, <b>functional</b> <b>changes</b> accounted for only 11. 3 % and 5. 9 %, respectively. Furthermore, <b>functional</b> <b>changes</b> explained more of the interannual variability of NEP in dry years (16. 3 %) than in wet years (3. 8 %), but there was no obvious change in {{the contribution of}} <b>functional</b> <b>changes</b> to the interannual variability of ET in dry (4. 7 %) or wet (5. 5 %) years. Thus, environmental variability rather than ecosystem <b>functional</b> <b>changes</b> dominated the interannual variability of both ET and NEP. However, different environmental variables controlled the interannual variability of NEP and ET. The results also indicated that, compared with NEP, ET was more resistant to drought stress through the self-regulating mechanisms of this plantation...|$|R

5000|$|Many {{studies that}} have {{demonstrated}} a role of the motor system in semantic processing of action language {{have been used as}} evidence for a shared neural network between action and language comprehension processes. For example, facilitated activity in language comprehension areas, evidence of semantic priming, with movement of a body part that is associated with the action word has also been used as evidence for this shared neural network. A more specific method for identifying whether certain areas of the brain are necessary for a cognitive task is to demonstrate impaired performance of said task following a <b>functional</b> <b>change</b> to the brain area of interest. [...] A <b>functional</b> <b>change</b> may involve a lesion, or altered excitability through stimulation, or utilization of the area for another task. According to this theory, there is only a finite amount of neural real-estate available for each task. If two tasks share a neural network, there will be competition for the associated neural substrates, and the performance of each task will be inhibited when performed simultaneously. Using this theory, proponents of the bi-directional hypothesis have postulated that performance of verbal working memory of action words would be impaired by movement of the concordant body part. This has been demonstrated with the selective impairment of memorization of arm and leg words when coupled with arm and leg movements, respectively. This implies that the neural network for verbal working memory is specifically tied to the motor systems associated with the body part implied with the word. This semantic topography has been suggested to provide evidence that action language shares a neural network with sensorimotor systems, thereby supporting the bi-directional hypthesis of language and action.|$|E

5000|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that {{official}} microblogging has become a sophisticated e-government effort for social management, especially for local governments and state units. It has led to a gradual change in local government's social governance strategy and <b>functional</b> <b>change</b> from being a service provider to a 'service predictor'. The latter requires enhanced capabilities to deliver individualized services and institute state surveillance via commercial service providers. In doing so, government units are experimenting with ways of interaction and negotiation with the microblogging public and service providers in their attempt to improve social management and political legitimacy. Interestingly enough, this negotiation process also exposes and/or creates inter-governmental tensions, since local governments in China consist of distinct units with their own particular preferences and operation procedures.|$|E
5000|$|In {{an effort}} to address the unmet need for {{standard}} methods {{in the development of}} treatments of cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia, representatives from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), NIMH, the pharmaceutical industry, and academia, formed the Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) project. [...] The MATRICS group and FDA representatives concluded that cognitive improvements alone, as measured by standardized neuropsychological assessments, were not a sufficient demonstration of drug efficacy to enable an indication for cognitive impairments associated with schizophrenia. The approval of new treatments for cognitive impairments would also require evidence that the cognitive improvements are clinically meaningful. Thus, clinical trials of cognitive enhancing compounds in schizophrenia must demonstrate improvement on a standard cognitive measure and improvement on a co-primary measure indicating that those cognitive improvements have a meaningful impact on skills used in real-world functioning. There are many indicators of real-world functioning in schizophrenia, such as the patientâ€™s ability to hold employment, live independently, and maintain social relationships, but detecting changes may take longer to emerge than the duration of a typical clinical trial. Furthermore, real-world <b>functional</b> <b>change</b> is dependent upon a variety of circumstances unrelated to treatment, such as changes in the patientâ€™s broader milieu. The MATRICS group thus recommended that clinical meaningfulness could be demonstrated through the use of tools measuring the potential to demonstrate real-world functional improvements associated with cognitive change rather than having to demonstrate actual <b>functional</b> <b>change.</b> The MATRICS group made no firm recommendations regarding which measure or measures should be used to provide evidence of a clinically meaningful effect as none of the existing instruments were viewed as sufficiently reliable, valid, and sensitive to treatment interventions during a clinical trial. To meet this need, the VRFCAT was designed to reliably assess functional capacity {{within the context of a}} simulated real-world environment.|$|E
