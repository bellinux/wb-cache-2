5|$|Over the {{following}} year, Japan also proceeded with its expansion plans. The Invasion of French Indochina on 22 September 1940 (which by then {{was controlled by}} the collaborating government of Vichy France), and Japan's ongoing bloody conflict with China, put a severe strain on American-Japanese relations. On 26 July 1940, the United States had passed the <b>Export</b> <b>Control</b> Act, cutting oil, iron and steel exports to Japan. This containment policy was Washington's warning to Japan that any further military expansion would result in further sanctions. However, such US moves were interpreted by Japan's militaristic leaders as signals {{that they needed to}} take radical measures to improve the Empire's situation, thereby driving Japan closer to Germany.|$|E
5|$|Dick Clark, a Democratic Senator from Iowa, {{discovered}} the operation during a fact-finding mission in Africa, but Seymour Hersh, {{a reporter for}} The New York Times, revealed IA Feature to the public on 13 December 1975. Clark proposed {{an amendment to the}} Arms <b>Export</b> <b>Control</b> Act, barring aid to private groups engaged in military or paramilitary operations in Angola. The Senate passed the bill, voting 54–22 on 19 December 1975, and the House of Representatives passed the bill, voting 323–99 on 27 January 1976. Ford signed the bill into law on 9 February 1976. Even after the Clark Amendment became law, then-Director of Central Intelligence, George H. W. Bush, refused to concede that all U.S. aid to Angola had ceased. According to foreign affairs analyst Jane Hunter, Israel stepped in as a proxy arms supplier for South Africa after the Clark Amendment took effect. Israel and South Africa established a longstanding military alliance, in which Israel provided weapons and training, as well as conducting joint military exercises.|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, most of Iran's weapons {{before the}} Islamic {{revolution}} were {{imported from the}} United States and Europe. Between 1971 and 1975, the Shah went on a buying spree, ordering $8 billion in weapons from the United States alone. This alarmed the United States Congress, which strengthened a 1968 law on arms exports in 1976 and renamed it the Arms <b>Export</b> <b>Control</b> Act. Still, the United States continued to sell large amounts of weapons to Iran until the 1979 Islamic Revolution.|$|E
40|$|Countries {{sometimes}} use <b>export</b> <b>controls</b> on {{raw materials}} to encourage domestic processing. The motivation is usually to assure raw materials at low prices for domestic industries, although <b>exports</b> are sometimes <b>controlled</b> {{in an attempt}} to increase export earnings (by promoting exports of higher value-added processed goods rather than raw materials). The problem is, <b>export</b> <b>controls</b> hurt raw material producers and cause economic distortions that result in net losses to the country. The impact of raw material <b>export</b> <b>controls</b> on total <b>export</b> earnings is ambiguous: the decline in raw material export when production is discouraged by lower prices may outweigh the effect of increased exports of processed goods. The author develops a simple partial equilibrium model of <b>export</b> <b>controls</b> on raw material to investigate the impact of export restrictions and to estimate the potential magnitude of the transfers between groups and the net costs of the export-control regimes. The author's estimates of the magnitude of transfers and costs of <b>export</b> <b>controls</b> on raw cashmere (in Mongolia) and wood production (in Romania) indicate that the transfers and costs may be substantial. The author finds that (under reasonable assumptions about elasticities of supply) <b>export</b> <b>controls</b> can transfer significant profits from the raw materials producers to the processing industries, causing significant net losses to the economy and a substantial net decrease in export earnings. Quantitative <b>export</b> <b>controls</b> will be even more distortive if processing industries have any monopsony (single-buyers) power. This is quite likely in developing countries with small industrial bases - or in economies in transition, where central planning has left a legacy of very large firms in highly concentrated industries. With monopsony power in the processing industry, both output and exports of final products can be reduced by quantitative <b>export</b> <b>controls</b> on raw material inputs. The quantitative control bestows effective monopsony power on the processing firm and encourages it to exploit this monopsony power by reducing output. If the raw materials could be freely exported, processors {{would not be able to}} effectively exercise monopsony power.

25|$|University {{interpretation}} and up-to-date understanding of <b>export</b> <b>control</b> regulations {{and willingness to}} seek opinions from the U.S. State Department affect the research that can be conducted on their campuses; for example, the University of Michigan successfully obtained an opinion from the Department of State stating that satellite development work on an (at the time) ITAR-controlled satellite being conducted by a student group containing both U.S. and non-U.S. citizens was considered fundamental research and was allowed to proceed. In contrast, as of March 2016, Stanford's <b>Export</b> <b>Control</b> Officer maintains that all satellite systems are controlled defense articles under the ITAR (despite their reclassification under the EAR in 2014) and, based on NASA criteria for automatic designation of a research project as fundamental research, does not consider projects above TRL 4 to be fundamental research, limiting the activities of laboratories and project-based groups on campus. This and similar policies are particularly damaging to international students studying aerospace engineering or related fields at U.S. universities, as opportunities to gain practical experience in their studies through internships are, due to licensing requirements, typically not offered to them at U.S. aerospace companies, and on-campus projects, when allowed, offer an alternate route for developing skills like those obtained through internships and co-op programs.|$|E

40|$|The article {{undertakes}} {{a generic}} {{examination of the}} global change in understanding <b>export</b> <b>controls</b> {{with the end of}} the Cold War and in the wake of new threats of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) proliferation to and by non-state actors. These have necessitated a more inclusive approach to <b>export</b> <b>controls.</b> India, which until now has been outside such regimes, has a special significance since it is a major user, producer and trader of dual-use items and technologies. The article links the global changes with a simultaneous transformation in India’s perception of <b>export</b> <b>controls.</b> It contrasts India’s past and present approaches to <b>export</b> <b>controls,</b> identifies measures towards their better institutionalisation, highlights imple-mentation challenges unique to the Indian environment and suggests measures to overcome these challenges. The article also argues that while <b>export</b> <b>controls</b> ensure trade with security, they have limited value as tools of non-proliferation, which in order to be sustainable, must not only dry up supply sources but also mitigate demand.
