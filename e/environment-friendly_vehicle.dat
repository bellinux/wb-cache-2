However, it also emits a greater amount of PM (particulate matter) and NOx than emissions from vehicles using other types of fuels. Therefore, the DME (Dimethyl Ether), an oxygen containing fuel draws attention as an alternative fuel for light oil {{that can be used for}} diesel engines since it generates very little smoke. But to develop and compare performance of an electric controlled common-rail DME engine, engine tests requires optimized injection conditions at required engine RPM and engine torque. These injection conditions cannot be set freely and the data configuration through the experimentally repeated application requires much time as well as a significant amount of errors and effort. The object of this study is to configure the basic injection map using the results of the DME engine experiments performed so far. For this, in this study, the functionalization of the required equations were performed along with the basic review of the factors that had influence on the data map. Through this, the information on the injection pressure, injection amount, injection duration, injection timing, etc. under certai...|$|E

This Directive states that European carmakers have to prominently display their vehicles’ carbon emissions rate on advertisement or commercial brochures. Based on an experiment conducted on {{a representative sample of}} French consumers, the authors show that this obligation, far from guiding consumers’ choice toward <b>environment-friendly</b> <b>vehicles,</b> is ineffective, and even counterproductive, among non-expert consumers. They show that the display of environmental information should rather take a colored A-G scale to guide non-expert consumers towards sustainable consumption behaviors. The authors finally discuss implications for public policy makers...|$|R

The fundamental idea is to view individual stakeholders and decisions as components of an integrated logistics system. This implies the coordination of shippers, carriers, and movements as well as the consolidation of loads of several customers and carriers into the same <b>environment-friendly</b> <b>vehicles.</b> City Logistics explicitly aims to optimize such advanced urban transportation systems. We focus on a challenging City Logistics planning issue, the integrated short-term scheduling of operations and management of resources, for the general case involving a two-tier distribution facility structure. We investigate the main issues related to the problem, introduce a new problem class, propose both a general model and formulations for the main system components, and identify promising solution avenues...|$|R

With so many current vehicles could damage the air cleaner in nature, caused by the combustion of residual Fuel (Fuel oil) the vehicles that emit fumes. Therefore it needs an alternative <b>environment-friendly</b> <b>vehicles</b> with electric bicycles. Electric vehicles currently using permanent magnet motors as their motive. On this research the drivers of electric vehicles use the induction generator who has the advantages i. e. a constant round of and excitation does not need another motor as a driving force. This vehicle is also installed on a system power savings, power saving methods is improved significantly. One of them is MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking) used in induction generators. MPPT design is modelled using Matlab/Simulink software. The Matlab simulation has manage to obtain 55. 04 volts of MPPT. While the generator output voltage without using the MPPT is amount of 40. 84 volts. By using perturb and observe algorithm, it is possible to search the optimum power of generator...|$|R
40|$|All {{over the}} world there are several {{countries}} where airships are being used for military and civilian purposes. The rebirth of this mean of transportation, capable of easily overcoming some deficiencies of the conventional ones, brings medium and long term economic benefits. In addition, they offer different services at lower costs, and they also may stimulate new commercial and industrial activities and even new transactional routes. The background of airship technology comes from the XVIII century. Since then, all those years were of scientific and empirical knowledge. Now, they {{form the basis for}} a sustainable future in emerging technologies, making the return of airships possible. This revived interest in airship technology brings a multitude of technical concepts resulting from interdisciplinary research. Consequently, the state of art of airships presents new research which paves the way for the reappearance of renewed horizons with regards to the use of airships. Companies are focused on the research, development and testing of new airship concepts and designs too. Nowadays, airships are being studied for commercial transport {{in different parts of the}} globe, from Canada, Brazil, Peru, to Australia. India, for example, has studies about the connection to remote areas with poor surface infrastructure which only can be reached by air or walking. This way, it's expected that airships will become a competitive mean of transport to link areas served by deficient transport infrastructures. Taking the principles of sustainable development of air transport, airships are the most <b>environment-friendly</b> <b>vehicles</b> with lower fuel consumption and with higher endurance. Therefore, as a result, they are paving the way for new markets. This work examines these technological improvements and the economic feasibility of the use of airships in certain market niches. Mainly, this work makes use of a study concerning the viability of the use of airships within Portuguese Tourism and Urban Logistic activity sectors. This paper is organized as follows: firstly, state of the art reviews about airships technological characteristics: operational constraints, operation scenarios, and international and national legislation. Secondly, improvement of two case studies within the Portuguese territory (touristic flights and urban logistic activity) : operational parameters evaluation and operating cost estimation. And thirdly, some insights and challenges of research that is still in progress...|$|R
40|$|Speeding is a {{widespread}} social problem. It affects road safety, higher vehicle speeds also contribute to increased greenhouse gas emissions, fuel consumption and noise and to adverse impacts on quality of life. Different researchers, organizations and road safety visions noted that co-ordinated actions taken by the res-ponsible authorities can bring about an immediate and durable response {{to the problem of}} speeding and so can reduce rapidly the number of fatalities and injuries, and to reduce environ-mental pollution and energy consumption. Speed management can help achieve appropriate speeds, taking into account mobility and economic needs as well as safety and environmental requirements. A coherent consistent policy will produce better results than a series of isolated measures. The speed management should consist the following elements: Better information and education is needed. Assessments of appropriate speed for all types of roads and a review of existing speed limits in relation to accident risk based on road function, presence of vulnerable road users, traffic composition, and road design and roadside characteristics. Infrastructure improvements, which are aimed at achieving safe, ""self explaining” roads; these should guide drivers in choosing the appropriate speed. People drive with a certain vehicle. These vehicles could have a higher mass, engine power and speed than which is needed (e. g. SUV). These cars could provide a higher feeling of security to the drivers but will have influence on the safety feelings of other (vulnerable) road users. Governments should discourage drivers to buy “bigger cars” and encourage manufactures to produce <b>environment-friendly</b> <b>vehicles</b> and cars with an appropriate mass, power en speed ratio. Intelligent Transport Systems could help to provide a better qua-lity of life. Active Cruise Control and Intelligent Speed Adaptation are systems that are beneficial in relation to speed control. ISA was frequently tested and demonstrated in many cars but until today no further steps in {{a widespread}} implementation strategy was achieved. Enforcement is the last step of the chain of speed management. Both traditional police enforcement and automated speed control, including the use of mobile cameras are needed to complement the other speed management measures in order to achieve their full effect. Speed enforcement activities are best repeated frequently, at irregular intervals and with different intensities. Higher intensities generally result in larger effects...|$|R

In {{the recent}} years, growing public {{concern has been}} given both on the energy problem and on the environment problem resulted from dramatically increased vehicles equipped with Internal Combustion Engine (ICE).

This has led to the emergence of <b>environment-friendly</b> and energy-saving <b>vehicles</b> such as the Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) that is usually equipped with one or more additional electric motors and the associated power battery compared with the Conventional vehicles (CVs) propelled solely by the ICE. The key point of an HEV is to design a proper Energy Management Strategy (EMS) that decides how to split the demanded power between the engine and the motor (battery). As the most important and expensive part of an HEV, it is important to take into account battery states, such as battery State of Charge (SOC) and battery ageing, aiming at maintain the optimality of the achieved EMS, as well as prolonging the battery life. In this dissertation, an HEV of parallel structure, which is equipped with a Lithiumion battery is considered. This dissertation is focused on accounting for battery related items, i. e. battery SOC and SOH indicated by battery parameters, in the EMS developments leading to a kind of fault tolerant EMS. Some brief introduction on the control methods and realization approaches involved in this work is presented first, followed by two big parts: the first part is focused on the battery modeling and estimation, while the second part is concerned by the vehicle modeling and few kinds of EMS development methods.
