5|$|The villa {{was soon}} cleared of enemy troops once more, and when Frost {{returned}} to the beach, {{he found that the}} machine-gun nest had been destroyed by the mis-dropped troops of 'Nelson'; avoiding other enemy positions, they had reached the beach and attacked the machine-gun post from the flank. By this time it was 02:15 {{but there was no sign}} of the naval force that was to evacuate the airborne troops. Frost ordered 'Nelson' to guard the inland approaches to the beach and then fired off an <b>emergency</b> <b>signal</b> flare; soon after that the naval force was seen approaching. The original plan for the operation had called for two landing craft at a time to land on the beach, but this had never been satisfactorily achieved during training; instead, all six landing craft landed at the same time, with the covering troops in the landing craft opening fire on German soldiers gathering at the top of the cliff.|$|E
25|$|A diver who has {{deployed}} a Delayed Surface Marker Buoy (DSMB) {{at the end}} of a dive may use a pre-arranged {{colour code}} to indicate if there is a problem. In some circles a yellow DSMB is considered an <b>emergency</b> <b>signal,</b> and red means OK. In most circles a second DSMB deployed on the same line will indicate a problem. A DSMB can also be used to carry up a slate with a message, but this is unlikely to be noticed unless a special arrangement has been made.|$|E
25|$|Small {{and highly}} agile {{paramilitary}} mobile teams {{spread out over}} the countryside to meet with locals and gather information about the Taliban and al-Qa'ida. During that time, one of the teams was approached in a village and asked by a young man for help in retrieving his teenage sister. He explained that a senior Taliban official had taken her as a wife and had sharply restricted the time she could spend with her family. The team gave the man a small hand-held tracking device to pass along to his sister, with instructions for her to activate it when the Taliban leader returned home. The team responded to her <b>emergency</b> <b>signal,</b> capturing the senior Taliban official and rescuing the sister.

The missile hit {{the right side of}} the ship, exploding below the galley in the electrician's mess deck at 10.45 pm (PKT). This led to an explosion in the first boiler room. Subsequently the ship lost propulsion, and was flooded with smoke. An <b>emergency</b> <b>signal</b> that read: [...] "Enemy aircraft attacked in position 020 FF 20. No. 1 boiler hit. Ship stopped", was sent to Pakistan Naval Headquarters (PNHQ). Due to the chaos created by the explosion, the signal contained the wrong coordinates of the ship's position. This delayed rescue teams from reaching its location. Observing that the ship was still afloat, Nirghat fired its second missile hitting Khaibar in the second boiler room on the ship's starboard side, eventually sinking the ship and killing 222 sailors.|$|E

Continuous exposure to high noise levels for people riding motorcycles has a potential risk of damaging hearing and degrading the quality of audio. This thesis develops the audio-integrated active noise control (AIANC) system for motorcycle helmets to cancel the harmful noise and preserve the quality of audio. The effects of the motorcycle noise on the music and speech signals were studied. Experimental setup with real ambience of a person riding a motorcycle, wearing an ANC helmet, and listening to audio under noisy conditions was built. The behavior of the AIANC system for real motorcycle noise was verified using the computer simulations and real-time experiments with different sinusoids and recorded motorcycle noise at different speeds. Both simulations and experiments show the feasibility of using the AIANC system for motorcycle helmets and preserving the quality of audio signals. The AIANC system also preserves the <b>emergency</b> <b>signals</b> by bypassing the <b>emergency</b> <b>signals.</b> The characteristics of different siren signals were studied and the performance for preserving <b>emergency</b> <b>signals</b> was verified using real-time experiment. This work pioneered and explored ANC for motorcycle helmets at Northern Illinois University...|$|R

40|$|Dedicated to Prof. Dr. -Ing. habil. Helmut Fleischer on the {{occasion}} of his 65 th birthday In Germany, reference time signals from an atomic clock are distributed via a long-wave radio station called DCF 77. As a rule, both radio clocks and wrist watches set their actual time as well as the switching between summer and winter time using the DCF 77. Apart from this service which started in the 1970 ties, more recently studies are underway how to use the spare bits of the time code for civil protection <b>emergency</b> <b>signals.</b> A possible realization could be that <b>emergency</b> <b>signals</b> are radiated from smoke detectors. In the framework of such a scenario, the suitability of different pure tone <b>signals</b> as <b>emergency</b> <b>signals</b> was studied in psychoacoustic experiments. The effects of different durations and repetition rates were assessed using the methods of random access as well as semantic differential. For the selection of the signals, the hearing ability in an ageing population was also taken into consideration. Moreover, signals were tailored in such a way to minimize possible confusions with other signals from alarm clocks, smoke detectors etc. In the lecture, signals will be presented acoustically: on the one hand, signals which are most suitable for the intended purpose, {{and on the other hand}} signals which are less appropriate...|$|R
