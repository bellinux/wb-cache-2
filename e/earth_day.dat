5000|$|... == <b>Earth</b> Overshoot <b>Day</b> == Previously {{known as}} Ecological Debt <b>Day,</b> <b>Earth</b> Overshoot <b>Day</b> {{is the day}} when {{humanity}} has exhausted nature's budget for the year. For {{the rest of the}} year, society operates in ecological overshoot by drawing down local resource stocks and accumulating carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The first <b>Earth</b> Overshoot <b>Day</b> was December 19, 1987. In 2014, <b>Earth</b> Overshoot <b>Day</b> was August 19. The <b>Earth</b> Overshoot <b>Day</b> in 2015 was on August 13 and on August 8 in 2016.. In 2017, <b>Earth</b> Overshoot <b>Day</b> landed on August 2.

5|$|Grič Tunnel was not {{mentioned}} again in media until 1993, when {{it served as}} the site of the Under City Rave, one of the first raves in Croatia, which was organized by the staff of the TV show Top DJ Mag, and featured DJs from as far as Germany and the UK. At the time, the tunnel was under ownership of the Museum of Contemporary Art. The event was attended by over 3,000 people, far more than the organisers planned for and the tunnel infrastructure allowed for. In 1994, it was part of an exhibition celebrating <b>Earth</b> <b>Day.</b> During the Croatian War of Independence (1991–95), the tunnel saw some use in its intended capacity as an air raid shelter. During this time, temporary toilets were built at the Radić Street exit.|$|E

40|$|The rover {{proposed}} in the mission Chandrayaan- 2, to primarily carry out in-situ scientific experiments on Moon surface, is planned to land near lunar south pole where the number of sunlit days (nights) vary with different lunar site latitudes. Extent of lunar night/s can be from 15 <b>earth</b> <b>days</b> (at 60 o south latitude landing site) to 20 <b>earth</b> <b>days</b> at 88 o south latitude. Thus, rover solar panel will be undergoing a continuous cold lunar night spanning 20 <b>earth</b> <b>days</b> unlike 72 minutes of peak eclipse duration for geosynchronous Earth orbit (GEO) spacecrafts.

5|$|In {{the final}} part, titled Payback, Atwood {{examines}} ecological debt. She recounts {{the journey of}} Scrooge in A Christmas Carol but placed in a modern setting. The modern-day Scrooge is visited by the spirits of <b>Earth</b> <b>Day.</b> In the past Scrooge witnesses debts to nature being repaid through animal and human sacrifices and through pestilence in over-crowded or unsustainable populations. In the present Scrooge witnesses current unsustainable practices, over-fishing and deforestation, creating a debt to nature being repaid through effects on the climate and impacts on people. Finally, in the future, Scrooge is shown two versions: one, an eco-friendly human society balanced with environmental systems, and the other, a dystopian future with a disaster affecting the fuel or food resources {{in such a way}} that hyperinflation sets in and renders money useless.|$|E
5|$|The March for Science Portland (also {{known as}} the March for Science PDX and Portland March for Science) was a protest held in Portland, Oregon.

5|$|Nixon was a late {{convert to}} the {{conservation}} movement. Environmental policy {{had not been}} a significant issue in the 1968 election; the candidates were rarely asked for their views on the subject. He saw that the first <b>Earth</b> <b>Day</b> in April 1970 presaged a wave of voter interest on the subject, and sought to use that to his benefit; in June he announced the formation of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Nixon broke new ground by discussing environment policy in his State of the Union speech; other initiatives supported by Nixon included the Clean Air Act of 1970 and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA); the National Environmental Policy Act required environmental impact statements for many Federal projects. Nixon vetoed the Clean Water Act of 1972—objecting not to the policy goals of the legislation but to the amount of money to be spent on them, which he deemed excessive. After Congress overrode his veto, Nixon impounded the funds he deemed unjustifiable.|$|E

5000|$|At {{the top of}} {{the clouds}} the wind speed on Venus reaches up to 95 m/s, {{circling}} the planet approximately every four <b>Earth</b> <b>days</b> in a phenomenon known as [...] "super-rotation". Colonies floating in this region could therefore have a much shorter day length by remaining untethered to the ground and moving with the atmosphere, compared to the usual 243 <b>Earth</b> <b>days</b> it takes for the planet to rotate. Allowing a colony to move freely would also reduce structural stress from the wind.|$|R

50|$|At {{specific}} {{points on}} Mercury's surface, an observer {{would be able}} to see the Sun rise part way, then reverse and set before rising again, all within the same Mercurian day. This apparent retrograde motion of the Sun occurs because, from approximately four <b>Earth</b> <b>days</b> before perihelion until approximately four <b>Earth</b> <b>days</b> after it, Mercury's angular orbital speed exceeds its angular rotational velocity. Mercury's elliptical orbit is farther from circular than that of any other planet in the Solar System, resulting in a substantially higher orbital speed near perihelion.|$|R
