500|$|In February 2011, McGuinness {{said that}} the album was almost {{complete}} and had a tentative release date of May 2011, although he noted that Songs of Ascent {{was no longer the}} likely title. The Songs of Ascent project ultimately did not come to fruition and has not been released; its evolution and apparent abandonment are examined in the book The Greatest Albums You'll Never Hear. Bassist Adam Clayton said, [...] "We thought there was more material left over from No Line... we now feel a long way from that material." [...] The dance-centric album was ultimately aborted as well; Clayton said, [...] "The work we did with RedOne was very, very exciting. But again, I'm not sure it was the essence of what U2 is good at... we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> we do best and we have to focus on that, and the work we did with Danger Mouse came closest to that." [...] Guetta clarified that he was not involved in the dance project and had only discussed a possible collaboration with Bono.|$|E
500|$|By 2008, Cuomo had reconsidered the album, saying: [...] "Pinkertons great. It's super-deep, brave, and authentic. Listening to it, I {{can tell}} that I was really going for it when I wrote and {{recorded}} {{a lot of those}} songs." [...] In 2010, Bell told The Aquarian Weekly: [...] "Pinkerton has definitely taken {{on a life of its}} own and became more successful and more accepted ... As an artist, you just <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> you believe in at the time, whether it’s accepted or not. You just have to keep going with it." [...] In 2015, following the Pinkerton reissue and the [...] "Memories" [...] tour, in which Weezer performed Blue and Pinkerton in their entirety, Cuomo said:The experience of learning those songs again, singing them every night, working on them with the guys, and then being in a relatively small venue with 1,000 of the most hardcore Weezer fans and hearing them sing every syllable, seeing them air-drum all the fills—it was such an amazing experience and so different from what we'd been doing the years before that ... So it was a great feeling of validation from the fans, for this album that was so personal to me and had been such a source of pain for years.|$|E
500|$|The {{importance}} of rehearsal to Monteux was shown when, in 1923, Diaghilev {{asked him to}} conduct Stravinsky's new Les noces with no rehearsal, as the composer would already have conducted the first performance, Monteux following on from there. Monteux told the impresario [...] "Stravinsky, 'e can do what 'e like, but I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> ze composer 'as written." [...] Monteux's self-effacing approach to scores led to occasional adverse comment; the music critic of The Nation, B. H. Haggin, while admitting that Monteux was generally {{regarded as one of}} the giants of conducting, wrote of his [...] "repeatedly demonstrated musical mediocrity". [...] Other American writers have taken a different view. In 1957 Carleton Smith wrote, [...] "His approach to all music is that of the master-craftsman. ... Seeing him at work, modest and quiet, it is difficult to realize that he is a bigger box office attraction at the Metropolitan Opera House than any prima donna ... that he is the only conductor regularly invited to take charge of America's 'big three'– the Boston, Philadelphia and New York Philharmonic orchestras." [...] In his 1967 book The Great Conductors, Harold C. Schonberg wrote of Monteux, [...] " [...] conductor of international stature, a conductor admired and loved all over the world. The word 'loved' is used advisedly." [...] Elsewhere, Schonberg wrote of Monteux's [...] "passion and charisma". When asked in a radio interview to describe himself (as a conductor) in one word, Monteux replied, [...] "Damned professional".|$|E

2500|$|In early May 2010, Russian {{special forces}} retook a Russian oil tanker {{that had been}} hijacked by 11 pirates. One died in the assault, and a week later Russian {{military}} officials reported that the remainder were freed due to weaknesses in international law but died before reaching the Somali coast. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev had announced the day the ship was retaken that [...] "We'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> our forefathers did when they met the pirates" [...] until a suitable way of prosecuting them was available.|$|E
2500|$|On 2 December 2007, Bale was {{substituted}} after sustaining {{an injury}} {{resulting from a}} tackle from Fabrice Muamba in the league fixture against Birmingham City. A scan revealed that Bale had suffered ligament damage to his right ankle, consigning him to an extended period on the sidelines. Bale had exploratory surgery on 11 December 2007. By February 2008, {{it became clear that}} Bale was to miss {{the rest of the season}} through injury. Sporting Director, Damien Comolli said, [...] "Even if the examination reveals that Gareth's foot is stable, the decision has been taken to bring him back slowly to ensure he does not get a repeat of the injury or suffer any further damage. Gareth is obviously disappointed to be sidelined for this length of time but he is still young and we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> is best for him in the long run." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 6 May 2010, the Russian {{destroyer}} Marshal Shaposhnikov {{arrived and}} fired two warning shots. The rescue operation then began when Marshal Shaposhnikov {{opened fire on}} the pirates with its cannons. Under the cover of this fire, a helicopter from the ship landed on the hijacked ship's deck and inserted Naval Infantry commandos on board, who quickly rescued the hijacked vessel. The entire crew escaped unharmed. One pirate was killed and [...] 10 detained during the operation. Later, the pirates were set adrift in an inflatable boat – without weapons or navigation equipment – some [...] from the coast. According to sources within the Russian Ministry of Defense, they did not reach the coast and likely died at sea. The pirates' disappearance has raised speculation {{that they were in}} fact executed by the Russian commandos, particularly in the light of Russian President Dmitri Medvedev's comments that [...] "We'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> our forefathers did when they met the pirates".|$|E

2500|$|Several scholars, {{including}} Elizabeth Drake, Scott F. Johnson and Maureen A. MacFarlane, {{have observed}} that some courts have moved away from Rowleys [...] "some educational benefit" [...] standard and have instead adopted a heightened [...] "meaningful educational benefit" [...] standard. Some commentators, such as Charlene K. Quade, argue that this [...] "expanded reading" [...] of Rowley reflects [...] "sound" [...] policy. Similarly, Scott F. Johnson {{has argued that the}} [...] "some educational benefit" [...] standard should be disfavored because it leads to [...] "a system where schools do not necessarily <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> is best for the child", though Johnson recommends pursuing legislative revisions rather than further reinterpretations of Rowley. On the other hand, some commentators, such as Terry Jean Seligmann, have argued that courts interpreting Rowley should give [...] "due weight" [...] to administrative determinations made by school boards and that courts should generally defer to the judgment of these administrators.|$|E
