The amorphous precipitates result from the further polymerization of hydroxo-linked iron octahedra and charge stabilized aggregation of the resulting iron complexes in solution.

The results of 10 day leaches showed that, when using electrochemical bioleaching in an ORP range of 400 to 430 mV, copper recovery reaches about 80 % which is 3. 9, 1. 5 and 1. 17 times higher than that achieved in abiotic electrochemical leaching, conventional bioleaching, and electrochemical bioleaching at 440 – 480 mV ORP, respectively.

Mineralogical analysis of the solid residues of electrochemical leaching in both, biotic and abiotic media, showed the formation of chalcocite and covellite minerals on the surface of not leached chalcopyrite. It is postulated that the reduction of refractory chalcopyrite to more soluble minerals such as chalcocite and covellite is achieved through both, electron transfer upon electrode contact and by ferrous reduction at the low ORP of the slurry.

A vertical shaft of almost 5 meters by side is the access to the tunnel: it goes 14 meters deep, and the entrance leads to a nearly 100 meters long corridor that ends {{in a series of}} underground galleries in the rock. After archaeologists broke ground at the entrance of the tunnel a staircase and ladders that would allow easy access to the subterranean site were installed. Works advanced a painstaking pace very slowly and carefully. Excavating was done manually, with spades. Nearly 1,000 tons of soil and debris were removed from the tunnel.

It contains mainly sulphur, iron <b>jarosites,</b> unleached base metals and platinum group metals (PGMs), which makes the treatment of SLC necessary. The SLC is currently toll-refined at Umicore’s Hoboken smelter and refinery to recover revenue from entrapped valuable metals. This method of treatment results in excessively high costs due to high transport and toll refining expenses as well as penalties. Thus, an in-house method of treatment by Anglo Platinum itself would prove beneficial in that it would eliminate these excessive costs and also provide a method of treatment {{in the event of}} residues exporting becoming banned or strongly penalised in future. Therefore, a method for treating SLC in-house is investigated. The first stage of the proposed treatment method involves a pyrometallurgical process where the removal of amphoterics by oxidative fuming, followed by reduction to recover base metals from the slag takes place. The PGMs are reported mainly to the metal alloy phase along with the base metals during this process. The project discussed in this report deals with the treatment of this furnace alloy which is referred to as Cu alloy. The Cu alloy is used to produce anodes to be applied to an electrorefining application for the recovery of Cu as a Cu cathode and PGMs in the form of anode slimes.

The results indicate that stream water was affected by acid mine drainage from the Dabaoshan mine at least to a distance of 25 km downstream of the mine water discharge point. It appears that H+ generated from sulfide oxidation in the waste rock dumps was readily available for exporting. The amount of H+ being discharged into the receiving stream depended on the volume of out-flowing waters. However, there was a lag time for the discharges of the metals. This {{may be attributed to}} the slower release of metals, relative to H+, because it might take more time for the dissolution of heavy metal-bearing compounds, particularly the sparsely soluble <b>jarosites.</b> Fe, Zn and Al were the major metals of potential toxicity contained in the AMD-affected stream water, followed by Mn, Cu, Pb, As, Cd and Ni. The concentrations of these metals in the water decreased rapidly down the stream.

Toxicity tests show that the AMD-affected stream water at 3. 5 km downstream of the discharge point was highly toxic to the test organism.

40|$|As one of {{the most}} {{abundant}} elements on earth, iron is nearly always present in metal concentrates. This is specifically true for zinc sulphide concentrates, which can contain up to 18 % iron (marmatite). Today more than half of these concentrates are treated in hydrometallurgical- or combined hydrometallurgical¬pyrometallurgical circuits. In hydrometallurgical circuits, iron is solubilised (either in a roast-Ieach-, a direct leach- or bacterial leach circuit) along with zinc and must be removed from the zinc¬rich solution before the electrowinning- or solvent extraction step. Various iron removal processes were developed to address the iron problem in hydrometallurgical circuits. The better known of these include the jarosite-, goethite- and hematite processes also used in the zinc industry. Zincor (Zinc Corporation of South Africa) patented an iron removal process (Zincor Process), which was generally considered to be very similar to the so-called "para-goethite" iron removal process used only in two other zinc smelters notably Porto Vesme (Italy) and Pasminco Hobart (Tasmania). However, since the Zincor Process was patented in 1976, various changes have been made such as a change from a batch parallel to a continuous series process, a change in precipitation pH-profile and the introduction of a pH controlled acid wash in the second tank. The introduction of a weak acid leach step and vacuum belt filters at Zincor's residue treatment plant in the near future and an iron removal process that is not clearly understood, necessitated this further study of the Zincor iron removal process. The study has been conducted in three parts. The first part of the study has focused on the characterisation of the Zincor iron residue and the Zincor process. The second part of the study has been concerned with the definition of an optimum operating window in terms of the filterability of the residue and the third part investigated the use of neutralisation reagents other than zinc calcine to control the pH during iron precipitation. The distribution of iron in the Zincor iron precipitate, which usually contains between 35 % and 40 % iron, {{has been found to be}} as follows: approximately 45 % as schwertmannite, 5 % as ferrihydrite, 20 % as <b>jarosites,</b> 25 % as franklinite, trace amounts of pyrite as well as 5 % of an unknown phase. This confirmed that goethite is not present in the Zincor iron residue and that iron is mainly removed in the form of amorphous intermediate iron phases such as schwertmannite and ferrihydrite. Of these two phases, schwertmannite was the least expected as most work up until now were done on samples taken from natural environments. The following description of the conditions that promote iron removal, mainly as schwertmannite, is viewed as an expansion of the available literature data, which was gathered at ambient conditions. In terms of the main operating parameters, optimum filterability was achieved under the following conditions: pH of 3. 0, temperature as high as possible (70 °C) and at least 25 kg/m 3 seeding. A retention time of at least 4 hours at a pH of 3. 0 and 60 °C was required, which decreased by more than 50 % at a temperature of 70 °C. As these conditions mainly impact on the soluble zinc loss encountered during iron removal, an effort was made to further reduce the insoluble zinc loss, which is the inherent weakness in the Zincor process, and similar processes where zinc calcine is used for pH control, by investigating the use of alternative neutralisation reagents. This study showed that iron can be successfully removed with Ca(OH) 2, a basic zinc sulphate and zinc oxide mixture as well as chemically precipitated CaC 03 produced in the paper and pulp industry. Of these alternatives, CaC 03 appeared to be the most promising, with filtration rates an order of magnitude higher than the zinc oxide options (calcine and basic zinc sulphate mixture), due to better overall economics than with the use of Ca(OH) 2. Utilisation CaC 03 as an alternative neutralisation agent might increase the overall zinc recovery figure at Zincor by up to 1. 5 %. Based on the findings, it can be concluded that the Zincor process in its current form has a very distinct character compared to what was historically considered to be the very similar patented para-goethite iron removal process, as practiced at the Porto Vesme and the Pasminco Hobart hydrometallurgical zinc plants.

40|$|Secondary leach {{concentrate}} (SLC) is {{an important}} bleed stream for minor elements from Anglo Platinumâs Base Metal Refinery (BMR) which produces copper nickel and cobalt sulphate. It contains mainly sulphur, iron <b>jarosites,</b> unleached base metals and platinum group metals (PGMs), which makes the treatment of SLC necessary. The SLC is currently toll-refined at Umicoreâs Hoboken smelter and refinery to recover revenue from entrapped valuable metals. This method of treatment results in excessively high costs due to high transport and toll refining expenses as well as penalties. Thus, an in-house method of treatment by Anglo Platinum itself would prove beneficial in that it would eliminate these excessive costs and also provide a method of treatment {{in the event of}} residues exporting becoming banned or strongly penalised in future. Therefore, a method for treating SLC in-house is investigated. The first stage of the proposed treatment method involves a pyrometallurgical process where the removal of amphoterics by oxidative fuming, followed by reduction to recover base metals from the slag takes place. The PGMs are reported mainly to the metal alloy phase along with the base metals during this process. The project discussed in this report deals with the treatment of this furnace alloy which is referred to as Cu alloy. The Cu alloy is used to produce anodes to be applied to an electrorefining application for the recovery of Cu as a Cu cathode and PGMs in the form of anode slimes. Spent electrolyte from the BMR copper electrowinning section adjusted to specific pH and Cu concentration is used as electrolyte to which dissolvable metals (such as Ni and Fe) are recovered. The purpose of the process is to recover PGMs to anode slimes with a composition suitable to be blended with the final concentrate that is sent to the Precious Metals Refinery (PMR). The performance of this process on the Cu alloy provided is investigated and the anode slimes produced are characterised in order to propose further methods of purification before blending with PMR feed. The typical energy consumption, cathodic current efficiency, anodic copper dissolution rate and deportment of elements (especially PGMs) are determined. The effects of various operating parameters on the performance are also investigated in order to propose operating conditions. The operating parameters that are investigated are current density, Cu and H 2 SO 4 concentrations in electrolyte and the use of an additive. A preliminary process design based on knowledge and experience gained during the literature review and test work is given. -PAGE 3 OF 181 The major technical factors in electrorefining are the cathode purity, the production rate and the specific energy consumption. These factors are influenced primarily by anode quality, electrolyte conditions and cathode current density. Design considerations and typical design parameters for other industrial Cu electrorefining applications are studied as well as possible further treatment of anode slimes for the concentration of PGMs. A total of eleven experiments were performed with a variety combinations of Cu concentration (30, 40 and 50 g/l), H 2 SO 4 concentration (110, 130, 160 and 190 g/l) and current density (100, 125, 150, 250, 300 A/m 2). In each experiment only one parameter was changed while all others were kept constant at the base-case setting of 40 g/l Cu, 160 g/l H 2 SO 4, and 125 A/m 2. The testwork showed that electrolytic refining of the Cu alloy, produced by a two stage pyrometallurgical treatment of current SLC, produces a highly concentrated PGM residue at an overall SLC mass reduction of 99. 3 %, with excellent PGM recovery to the anode slimes material. The different operating parameters that were tested successfully, all showed very good repeatability and greater than 99 % PGM recovery from the Cu alloy, which would result in an overall recovery of 98 % from SLC. Very little or none of the base metals that were supplied by the anode or the electrolyte feed reported to the anode slimes. The typical operating conditions (cell potential, current efficiency, anodic Cu dissolution and element deportment) that were observed correlated well with literature and the theoretically calculated values. The characteristics of the anode slimes produced stayed relatively similar throughout the different operating parameters and strong confidence can be placed in the production thereof and the recovery of the PGMs. The characteristics of the spent electrolyte and the Cu cathodes were also found to be suitable for integration in the BMR circuit. The anode slimes composition was 20 to 30 % PGMs, 20 to 30 % base metals, 15 to 20 % Ag, As, Te, Se, Pb and 2 to 5 % Al, Si, Sb, Bi, Zn and Sn. The blending of these slimes with typical PMR feed will result in a new PMR feed where the Pt grade of the feed to PMR is reduced by 4 to 5. 5 %, the Cu grade increased by 2 to 4 % and the Ni content reduced by Â± 4 %. Other concerns are the increase of As, Te, and Pb by between 0. 5 and 1 %. -PAGE 4 OF 181 The PGM-rich (> 60 %) phase in the anode slimes is a mostly amorphous matrix phase containing mostly palladium and other PGMs, arsenic and tellurium [Pd 73 As 6 Te 21] with small amounts of Cu. Anode slimes produced from electrorefining can either be subjected to an additional process step to remove Ag, Pb and base metals before it is blended with the final concentrate (FICO) as feed for PMR, or it can be sent to the metallics section in PMR which includes a roast and a leach stage. The treatment of the anode slimes depends {{on the nature of the}} slimes. A preliminary process design was performed with proposed design parameters of electrolyte concentrations of 40 g/l Cu and 160 g/l H 2 SO 4 at 65 Â°C and a current density of 200 A/m 2. The process consists out of seven cells in series with 55 anode cathode pairs in parallel per cell. The process has a maximum capacity of 127 t/m of anode material which allows 56 days of downtime per year if the current SLC produced (6600 t/a) is treated. The maximum capacity for Cu production is 1349 t/a and anode slimes 50. 3 t/m. The power consumption per kg of anode dissolved will be 0. 175 kWh/kg...|$|R
