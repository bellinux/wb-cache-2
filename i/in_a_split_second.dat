Those of bigfin reef squids can range in diameter from 350 to 560μm (in {{contrast to the}} typical 1μm for humans). In life, these giant axons are used by the squids to coordinate escape jetting behaviour, enabling the squid to contract its muscles <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>split</b> <b>second</b> directly from the brain.|$|E
25|$|As flight speed {{increases}} supersonically {{the shock}} system is initially external. For the SR-71 this was until about M1.6 to M1.8 and M2 for the XB-70. The intake {{is said to}} be unstarted. Further increase in speed produces supersonic speeds inside the duct with a plane shock near the throat. The intake {{is said to be}} started. Upstream or downstream disturbances, such as gusts/atmospheric temperature gradients and engine airflow changes, both intentional and unintentional(from surging), tend to cause the shock to be expelled almost instantaneously. Expulsion of the shock, known as an unstart, causes all the supersonic compression to take place externally through a single plane shock. The intake has changed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>split</b> <b>second</b> from its most efficient configuration with most of its supersonic compression taking place inside the duct to the least efficient as shown by the large loss in pressure recovery, from about 80% to about 20% at M3 flight speeds. There is a large drop in intake pressure and loss in thrust together with temporary loss of control of the aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Led by General Crassus (Jay Simon), the Romans {{attack the}} city with Talos, a bronze giant. However, The Spartan is able to destroy Talos with catapults. That night, Ares instructs him to {{infiltrate}} the Roman camp and recover the Blades of Athena, lost since the Trojan War. Accompanied by Castor, The Spartan is successful, and during the raid, they encounter Electra (Julia Innocenti), Queen of the Amazons, who was captured whilst tracking the Romans through Greece. Imprisoned in the camp, she had killed her guard and was escaping when she met Castor and The Spartan, who now has the Blades of Athena. Once back in Sparta, she demands to speak to Leonidas, telling him the Romans have built an incredibly powerful weapon, capable of obliterating the entire city. She is proven correct when Crassus reveals a weapon powered by an imprisoned Medusa, with the capability of turning entire phalanxes to stone <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>split</b> <b>second.</b> The Spartan fights his way to Medusa, and destroys the weapon, also killing Crassus and taking his sword and magical shield.|$|E

It is therefore important for the organization to ensure speedy recovery of the disaster’s impact such as the assets <b>in</b> <b>an</b> effort to ensure the business survival and facilitating societal and economic recovery. Therefore this paper examines the state of knowledge in relation to the asset management recovery especially after the disaster. Following to that, this paper will discuss the literatures involves in asset management recovery such as disaster management and business continuity plan (BCP). Towards the end, this paper suggests that the effect of lack of planning in asset management recovery will lead to an untold damage towards the community, organization as well as the business, taking months or even years to rectify. In some cases, businesses are shut down for goods due to loss data as well as other emerge problems cause by the disaster...|$|R

25|$|The {{main point}} of {{contention}} in the umpiring of the 1974–75 Ashes series was the intimidatory bowling of the Australian fast bowlers Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson. There were a few other issues, though there were the usual cases of batsmen being given out or not out despite the differing opinions of the players and umpire. At the time, umpires had no recourse to slow motion replays and had to {{make decisions based on}} what they saw <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>split</b> <b>second,</b> with {{the benefit of the doubt}} always going to the batsman. As a result it was not uncommon for umpires to make mistakes, which over the course of a long series tended to cancel each other out. The best an umpire could do was to make an honest judgement based on what he saw. Tom Brooks and Robin Bailhache were the umpires in all six Tests, but were junior for so important a series. Brooks having made his debut in the 1970–71 Ashes series and Bailhache in the First Test at Brisbane. Unusually for Australian umpires of the time Brooks had played First Class Cricket – he had been a lively fast-medium bowler – and as a result was more able to connect with the Test players, and was more forgiving of short-pitched deliveries which he saw as a natural part of the game. This helped England in 1970–71 when they had the fast bowlers John Snow and Bob Willis, but proved fatal for their batsmen in 1974–75.|$|E

50|$|Most {{commentators}} {{agree that}} the timekeepers erred with respect to Rule 10.4.1; that is, the siren did not continue to sound until it was formally acknowledged by an umpire. Acknowledgement of the siren requires {{any one of the}} three field umpires to raise both arms into the air and blow the whistle. There remains some doubt as to whether any of the three umpires did hear the siren, but in any event, none chose to bring play to an end as required by Rule 10.4.2. This rule is not well known by football fans and clearly states that the umpires are the sole judge of when a quarter ends. However, generally this is <b>in</b> terms of <b>a</b> <b>split</b> <b>second</b> decision as to whether a mark or kick occurred before or after the siren sounded, rather than the 25 seconds difference in this case.|$|R

2500|$|The tympanic reflex {{helps prevent}} {{damage to the}} inner ear by {{muffling}} the transmission of vibrations from the tympanic membrane to the oval window. [...] The reflex has a response time of 40 milliseconds, not fast enough to protect the ear from sudden loud noises such as an explosion or gunshot. [...] Thus, the reflex most likely developed to protect early humans from loud thunder claps which do not happen <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>split</b> <b>second.</b> [...] The reflex works by contracting {{the muscles of the}} inner ear, the tensor tympani and the stapedius. [...] This pulls the manubrium of the malleus inwards and tightens it. This tightening prevents the vibrations from disturbing the perilymph. Withdrawal from drugs such as benzodiazepines had been known to cause tonic tensor tympani syndrome (TTTS) during withdrawal. The tympanic reflex will also activate when loud vibrations are generated by the person themselves. The tensor tympani can often be observed vibrating while shouting at an increased volume, dampening the sound somewhat.|$|E
2500|$|The England team disputed several umpiring {{decisions}} in the 1970–71 Ashes series, Ray Illingworth, Geoffrey Boycott and John Snow in particular. After the series Boycott and Snow were called to a disciplinary hearing at Lords over their behaviour, and Illingworth and Snow never toured again. Only three umpires were used; Lou Rowan, who was most involved in the controversy, and his colleagues Tom Brooks and Max O'Connell who both debuted as Test umpires in the series. At the time, umpires had no recourse to slow motion replays and had to {{make decisions based on}} what they saw <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>split</b> <b>second,</b> with {{the benefit of the doubt}} always going to the batsman.

40|$|As agile methodologies {{advance in}} process {{maturity}} {{we find that}} most of their practices such as Test-Driven Development, refactoring, and pair programming (specifically for Extreme Programming) are becoming {{the order of the}} day <b>in</b> <b>a</b> number of organizations that were traditionally sceptical about agile development. Without implying that Microsoft has ever been against agile development it is interesting to note that they now have a very comprehensive set of tools for agile development under the MSF for Agile set. Published literature has a lot of empirical evidence on the gains of using pair programming for development teams and even for teaching programming. However, the remaining challenges relate to the use of pair programming in distributed development environments. Hence, a gap still exists in determining the feasibility (especially with regards to data security) of doing pair programming for virtual teams and also developing appropriate tools for such practices. I suppose the lack of appropriate tools for such activities could have delayed the comprehensive adoption of this kind of practice. In today's globally connected world where the world network can be traversed on <b>a</b> hand-held device <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>split</b> of <b>a</b> <b>second,</b> it is worth investigating what sort of tools could be securely used for virtual pair programming. Such an investigation becomes more valuable especially if we consider the ever growing complexities of all sorts of viral attacks on our data and the apparent growth of other evils such as terrorism. This paper investigates the prevalence, effectiveness and security issues of using online collaboration tools such as NetBeans, VI, Google docs, and some open source tools such as RSS Dashboard and many others to implement virtual pair programming...|$|R

2500|$|A {{number of}} {{commentators}} have remarked upon Rajneesh's charisma. Comparing Rajneesh with Gurdjieff, Anthony Storr wrote that Rajneesh was [...] "personally extremely impressive", noting that [...] "many {{of those who}} visited {{him for the first}} time felt that their most intimate feelings were instantly understood, that they were accepted and unequivocally welcomed rather than judged. [...] seemed to radiate energy and to awaken hidden possibilities in those who came into contact with him". Many sannyasins have stated that hearing Rajneesh speak, they [...] "fell in love with him." [...] Susan J. Palmer noted that even critics attested to the power of his presence. James S. Gordon, a psychiatrist and researcher, recalls inexplicably finding himself laughing like a child, hugging strangers and having tears of gratitude in his eyes after a glance by Rajneesh from within his passing Rolls-Royce. Frances FitzGerald concluded upon listening to Rajneesh in person that he was a brilliant lecturer, and expressed surprise at his talent as a comedian, which had not been apparent from reading his books, as well as the hypnotic quality of his talks, which had a profound effect on his audience. Hugh Milne (Swami Shivamurti), an ex-devotee who between 1973 and 1982 worked closely with Rajneesh as leader of the Poona Ashram Guard and as his personal bodyguard, noted that their first meeting left him with a sense that far more than words had passed between them: [...] "There is no invasion of privacy, no alarm, but it is as if his soul is slowly slipping inside mine, and <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>split</b> <b>second</b> transferring vital information."
