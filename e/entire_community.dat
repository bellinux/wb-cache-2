5|$|Nearly all {{structures}} {{within an}} 800-metre (half-mile) radius, including the <b>entire</b> <b>community</b> of Richmond, were obliterated. A pressure wave snapped trees, bent iron rails, demolished buildings, grounded vessels, and scattered fragments of Mont-Blanc for kilometres. Hardly {{a window in}} the city proper survived the blast. Across the harbour, in Dartmouth, there was also widespread damage. A tsunami created by the blast wiped out the community of Mi'kmaq First Nations people {{who had lived in}} the Tufts Cove area for generations.|$|E

5|$|World War II {{dramatically}} {{changed the}} lives of Gibraltarians. The decision to enforce mass evacuation {{in order to increase}} the strength of the Rock with more military and naval personnel meant that most Gibraltarians (some for up to ten years) had nowhere to call 'home'. Only those civilians with essential jobs were allowed to stay but it gave the <b>entire</b> <b>community</b> a sense of being 'British' by sharing in the war effort.|$|E

30|$|A major gap in our {{understanding}} of climate change and mobility relates to the relocation of <b>entire</b> <b>communities</b> (with exceptions including Bronen 2011). Other studies, particularly related to development-induced relocations and resettlements, highlight some key challenges of relocating <b>entire</b> <b>communities</b> (Asthana 1996; Cernea 1997; Scudder 2012). The overwhelming sense is that relocations are “rarely considered successful by those who move” (McAdam 2015, p. 32). We must take heed of this and learn from past mistakes.|$|R

5|$|After its {{unexpected}} redevelopment over Oklahoma, widespread {{damage was}} also reported there. Several communities in central Oklahoma were flooded {{due to the}} heavy rainfall. Watonga, Kingfisher and Geary were the hardest-hit communities, where many houses and buildings were inundated. The weather forced the cancellation of the Hydro Fair as the carnival rides were not safe in heavy rain and high wind. Winds in Watonga gusted as high as 82mph (131km/h), which damaged numerous trees and power lines and heavily damaged mobile homes. The <b>entire</b> <b>community</b> lost power, as did about 15,000 customers in total in the Oklahoma City metropolitan area. A section of Interstate 40 was also closed for a while.|$|E
5|$|This {{emphasis}} on improvisation was essential due traditional {{role of the}} music as entertainment for the <b>entire</b> <b>community.</b> Listeners in the audience expected players to surprise and astound them by playing in their own unique style, and by incorporating improvisation to make newer versions of the piece. If a player simply imitated a preceding player, playing patterns without any improvisation, the audience members would believe she/he to be repetitious and mundane. This also explains why set performance pieces for musical productions are different in some respect—young men/women would be practicing before an event, therefore rarely relying on improvisations.|$|E
5|$|Amulets and idols {{fashioned}} from assorted natural materials have occupied an important place among many ethnic groups of Madagascar for centuries. Ody, personal amulets believed to protect or allocate powers to the wearer, were commonplace objects possessed by anyone from slave children to kings. The name sampy {{was given to}} those amulets that, while physically indistinguishable from ody, were distinct in that their powers extended over an <b>entire</b> <b>community.</b> The sampy were often personifiedcomplete with a distinct personalityand offered their own house with guardians dedicated to their service. Ralambo amassed twelve of the most reputed and powerful sampy from neighboring communities. He furthermore transformed {{the nature of the}} relationship between sampy and ruler: whereas previously the sampy had been seen as tools at the disposal of community leaders, under Ralambo they became divine protectors of the leader's sovereignty and the integrity of the state which would be preserved through their power on the condition that the line of sovereigns ensured the sampy were shown the respect due to them. By collecting the twelve greatest sampytwelve being a sacred number in Merina cosmologyand transforming their nature, Ralambo strengthened the supernatural power and legitimacy of the royal line of Imerina.|$|E

5|$|Mr Knight of Cannington {{alerted the}} nuns {{to the sale}} of Taunton Lodge, and they raised the £3,150 {{required}} to purchase it. They completed the purchase in early May 1807, after some minor quibbles with the Coles family. When the abbess visited the Lodge prior to the purchase, she had identified that it would require £1,000 worth of improvements {{in addition to the}} money already spent on its acquisition. The plans included extending the existing building to gain a staircase and some dormitories for the school girls, and the addition of a new wing that would include a chapel, infirmary, four cells, and rooms for the male chaplain and servants. The new building was begun in March 1808, and by June of that year, the <b>entire</b> <b>community</b> had moved from Winchester, despite the work being ongoing. The shell of the new body was completed by the autumn of 1808, but the work was delayed {{due to a lack of}} finances as £1,908 had already been spent on altering the old building. This cost did not include the erection of the new wing, thus the constructions costs were already far surpassing the original estimate.|$|E
5|$|The {{final vote}} {{has come under}} much {{criticism}} because of the relatively {{small percentage of the}} 9000-strong IAU membership who participated. Besides the fact that most members do not attend the General Assemblies, this lack was also due to the timing of the vote: the final vote was taken {{on the last day of}} the 10-day event, after many participants had left or were preparing to leave. The claim is that only 424 astronomers were present for the vote, which is less than 5% of the <b>entire</b> <b>community</b> of astronomers. However, sampling 400 representative members out of a population of 9,000 statistically yields a result with good accuracy (confidence interval better than 5%). There is also the issue of the many astronomers who were unable or who chose not to make the trip to Prague and, thus, cast no vote. Astronomer Marla Geha has clarified that not all members of the Union were needed to vote on the classification issue: only those whose work is directly related to planetary studies.|$|E
5|$|The first {{church on}} {{this site was}} {{established}} by Cwyllog, a female saint, in the 6th century, although the exact date is unknown. She {{was one of the}} daughters of St Caw, a king in northern Britain who lost his lands and sought safety with his family in Anglesey, where the ruler Maelgwn Gwynedd gave him land. There was a church here {{at the time of the}} Norwich Taxation in 1254, and the present walls may date from around 1200. In the 13th century, the church was under the control of the Augustinian canons of the priory at Penmon, on the east of Anglesey, with the priory gaining the income from the tithes paid to the church. The priory gradually diminished in size and importance, and in 1522 the prior and two canons (the <b>entire</b> <b>community,</b> at that stage) affixed their signature to the lease of Llangywllog church to Richard Bulkeley (a member of a prominent family from the Anglesey town of Beaumaris) for the period of 100 years at an annual rent of £1.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Reliable {{maps of the}} {{geographical}} distribution, number of infected individuals and burden estimates of schistosomiasis are essential tools to plan, monitor and evaluate control programmes. Large-scale disease mapping and prediction efforts rely on compiled historical survey data obtained from the peer-reviewed literature and unpublished reports. Schistosomiasis surveys usually focus on school-aged children, whereas some surveys include <b>entire</b> <b>communities.</b> However, data are often reported for non-standard age groups or entire study populations. Existing geostatistical models ignore either the age-dependence of the disease risk or omit surveys considered too heterogeneous. Methods We developed Bayesian geostatistical models and analysed existing schistosomiasis prevalence data by estimating alignment factors to relate surveys on individuals aged ≤ 20 years with surveys on individuals aged > 20 years and <b>entire</b> <b>communities.</b> Schistosomiasis prevalence data for 11 countries in the eastern African region were extracted from an open-access global database pertaining to neglected tropical diseases. We assumed that alignment factors were constant for the whole region or a specific country. Results Regional alignment factors indicated {{that the risk of}} a Schistosoma haematobium infection in individuals aged > 20 years and in <b>entire</b> <b>communities</b> is smaller than in individuals ≤ 20 years, 0. 83 and 0. 91, respectively. Country-specific alignment factors varied from 0. 79 (Ethiopia) to 1. 06 (Zambia) for community-based surveys. For S. mansoni, the regional alignment factor for <b>entire</b> <b>communities</b> was 0. 96 with country-specific factors ranging from 0. 84 (Burundi) to 1. 13 (Uganda). Conclusions The proposed approach could be used to align inherent age-heterogeneity between school-based and community-based schistosomiasis surveys to render compiled data for risk mapping and prediction more accurate. </p...|$|R
