5|$|In 'Nothing Really Matters' and 'The Power of Good-Bye', I {{want people}} to have a visceral and {{emotional}} reaction to things, rather than to have in their mind where all my stuff comes from. With the songs, I {{wanted to say that}} <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>matter</b> really what you think or do, just think by yourself, and not judge and dissect others. You know if I see a bug crawling across the floor and it inspired me to write the most incredible love poem, I don't {{want people to}} be thinking about their relationship, and then think of my bug crawling across the floor. It's then that the power of good-bye becomes better than the power of acceptance.|$|E
5|$|The Bearded Man {{demands that}} Fassl kill Fain, beating him {{up when he}} doesn't comply. As she tends to Fassl, Fain first sees the Bearded Man in his place. While staking out Fain's house, the agents see the Bearded Man flee. Doggett pursues the Bearded Man while Reyes finds Fain alive. In the pursuit, Reyes falls through into a sewer, where she finds {{the remains of the}} Bearded Man's victims. After a {{struggle}} with the Bearded Man who is holding Doggett at knife point, Reyes shoots. The Bearded Man falls into the water and Doggett goes after him, only to pull up Fassl, much to his confusion. Reyes tries to remind him that <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>matter</b> as long as the case is solved.|$|E

60|$|This slight {{deviation}} {{added some}} ten miles to Davidson's round trip, but as that was sixteen hundred miles <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>matter</b> much.|$|R
25|$|Note that <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>matter</b> {{in which}} {{direction}} one passes the circularly polarized light.|$|E
25|$|In this {{postulate}} <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>matter</b> {{in which}} unit the angle is measured {{as long as}} each angle is measured in the same unit.|$|E
25|$|As a {{consequence}} of the law of sines, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>matter</b> which side and opposite angle are taken: the result will be the same.|$|E

60|$|It was a {{habit of}} his to talk to himself. In the present case <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>matter,</b> as {{there was no one}} else within earshot.|$|R
60|$|Never, I thought, would I forget Vaughn Steele's eyes. <b>It</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>matter</b> that <b>it</b> was dark; I saw {{the fixed}} gleam, then the leaping, shadowy light.|$|R
25|$|Today {{students}} may enroll in any nation, although the nations still preserve their geographic names. In most cases <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>matter</b> what nation one enrolls in, but different nations offer different activities for interested students.|$|E
25|$|By analogy, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>matter</b> {{that one}} cannot {{experience}} another's subjective sensations. Unless talk of such subjective experience is learned through public experience the actual content is irrelevant; {{all we can}} discuss is what is available in our public language.|$|E
25|$|Only {{the effect}} of the {{disposition}} need be considered. <b>It</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>matter</b> whether the debtor made the disposition deliberately to favour one of his creditors, or recklessly, without regard for its consequences. The debtor’s state of mind in making the disposition is irrelevant.|$|E
60|$|She strolled on, more scornful and {{helpless}} than ever. Apparently <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>matter</b> what one said to Lady Pippinworth; her pout kept {{it within the}} proprieties.|$|R
50|$|The Sparks had a 28-4 record (.875), {{good enough}} to receive home-court {{advantage}} over the Sting (18-14). <b>It</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>matter,</b> however, as the Sparks swept the Sting.|$|R
50|$|The Comets had a 27-5 record (.844), {{good enough}} to receive home-court {{advantage}} over the Liberty (20-12). <b>It</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>matter,</b> however, as the Comets swept the Liberty.|$|R
25|$|Since {{only the}} {{connection}} information is relevant, {{the shape of}} pictorial representations of a graph may be distorted in any way, without changing the graph itself. Only the existence (or absence) of an edge between each pair of nodes is significant. For example, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>matter</b> whether the edges drawn are straight or curved, or whether one node is {{to the left or}} right of another.|$|E
25|$|Each curve may {{pass through}} itself during this motion, {{but the two}} curves must remain {{separated}} throughout. This is formalized as regular homotopy, which further requires that each curve be an immersion, not just any map. However, this added condition {{does not change the}} definition of linking number (<b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>matter</b> if the curves are required to always be immersions or not), which is an example of an h-principle (homotopy-principle), meaning that geometry reduces to topology.|$|E
25|$|When {{using this}} convention, in {{contrast}} to the other convention, the defined handedness of the wave matches the handedness of the screw type nature of the field in space. Specifically, if one freezes a right-handed wave in time, when one curls the fingers of one’s right hand around the helix, the thumb will point in the direction which the helix progresses given that sense of rotation. Note that it is the nature of all screws and helices that <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>matter</b> in which direction you point your thumb when determining its handedness.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, {{for that}} purpose <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>n't</b> <b>matter</b> which of us should marry her. If it had been I," [...] he added, [...] "she would have made you accept it." ...|$|R
25|$|Transient (state) {{loneliness}} {{is temporary}} in nature, caused by {{something in the}} environment, and is easily relieved. Chronic (trait) loneliness is more permanent, caused by the person, and is not easily relieved. For example, {{when a person is}} sick and cannot socialize with friends would be a case of transient loneliness. Once the person got better it would be easy for them to alleviate their loneliness. A person who feels lonely regardless of if they are at a family gathering, with friends, or alone is experiencing chronic loneliness. <b>It</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>matter</b> {{what goes on in the}} surrounding environment, the experience of loneliness is always there.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} day, Frank {{confesses to}} having {{had an affair}} with a female assistant at his office, hoping to reconcile with April. To his surprise, April responds apathetically and tells him <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>matter</b> as her love for him has gone, which he does not believe. The Givings come over for dinner, and Frank announces to the guests that their plans have changed, as April is pregnant. John harshly lambasts Frank for crushing April's hope as well as his acceptance of his circumstances. Angered, Frank nearly attacks John, and the Givings hurry out. Afterwards, Frank and April have a severe verbal altercation, after which April flees the house.|$|E
25|$|The {{nitrate ion}} (NO3−), for instance, must form a double bond between {{nitrogen}} {{and one of}} the oxygens to satisfy the octet rule for nitrogen. However, because the molecule is symmetrical, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>matter</b> which of the oxygens forms the double bond. In this case, there are three possible resonance structures. Expressing resonance when drawing Lewis structures may be done either by drawing each of the possible resonance forms and placing double-headed arrows between them or by using dashed lines to represent the partial bonds (although the latter is a good representation of the resonance hybrid which is not, formally speaking, a Lewis structure).|$|E
60|$|But <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>matter</b> so much--there {{were three}} now. They {{set up a}} game round the lamp-post, till the others rushed up, yelling. Then the play went fast and furious.|$|R
60|$|The {{twilight}} {{was fading}} {{as she left}} the office. She turned northward, choosing a broad, ill-lighted road. <b>It</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>matter</b> which way she took. She wanted to think; or, rather, to dream.|$|R
60|$|St. Vincent <b>did</b> <b>not</b> know, {{though he}} confessed to feeling stiff and sore all over. And <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>matter,</b> anyway. He had killed neither Borg nor his wife, that much he did know.|$|R
25|$|A {{total of}} 33 {{different}} manifestations of Avalokitasvara are described, including female manifestations, all {{to suit the}} minds of various beings. Chapter 25 consists of both a prose and a verse section. This earliest source often circulates separately as its own sūtra, called the Avalokitasvara Sūtra (Ch. 觀世音經), and is commonly recited or chanted at Buddhist temples in East Asia. The Lotus Sutra and its thirty-three manifestations of Guanyin, of which seven are female manifestations, {{is known to have}} been very popular in Chinese Buddhism as early as in the Sui and Tang dynasties. Additionally, Tan Chung notes that according to the doctrines of the Mahāyāna sūtras themselves, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>matter</b> whether Guanyin is male, female, or genderless, as the ultimate reality is in emptiness (Skt. śūnyatā).|$|E
25|$|There {{is also a}} {{so-called}} VRDP protocol used in the VirtualBox virtual machine implementation by Oracle. This protocol is compatible with all RDP clients, such as that provided with Windows but, unlike the original RDP protocol, can be configured to accept unencrypted and password unprotected connections, which {{may be useful in}} secure and trusted networks, such as home or office LANs. By default, Microsoft's RDP server refuses connections to user accounts with empty passwords (but this can be changed with the Group Policy Editor). External and guest authorization options are provided by VRDP as well. <b>It</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>matter</b> which operating system is installed as a guest because VRDP is implemented on the virtual machine (host) level, not in the guest system. The proprietary VirtualBox Extension Pack is required.|$|E
25|$|Self-verification motives operate for {{different}} {{dimensions of the}} self-concept and in many different situations. Men and women are equally inclined to display this tendency, and <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>matter</b> whether the self-views refer to characteristics that are relatively immutable (e.g., intelligence) or changeable (e.g., diligence), or whether the self-views happen to be highly specific (e.g., athletic) or global (e.g., low self-esteem, worthlessness). Furthermore, when people chose negative partners over positive ones, it is not merely {{in an effort to}} avoid interacting with positive evaluators (that is, out of a concern that they might disappoint such positive evaluators). Rather, people chose self-verifying, negative partners even when the alternative is participating in a different experiment. Finally, recent work has shown that people work to verify self-views associated with group memberships. For example, women seek evaluations that confirm their belief that they possess qualities associated with being a woman.|$|E
50|$|A {{disciple of}} Hillel, Yochanan ben Zakai, {{was one of}} the most passionate voices for peace. He preached that <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>matter</b> who ruled Judea, what mattered was who ruled an individual's heart.|$|R
50|$|And {{that was}} {{effectively}} {{the end of}} the match. Both Garry Birtles and Robertson missed good chances in the second half, but <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>matter,</b> as Malmö FF never looked likely to score.|$|R
