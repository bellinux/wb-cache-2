40|$|The {{need for}} {{experimental}} and analytical modeling {{in the field}} of deep water offshore anchoring technologies is high. Suction caisson and drag embedment anchors (DEA) are common anchors used for mooring structures in deep water. The installation process of drag embedment anchors has been highly empirical, employing a trial and error methodology. In the past decade analytical methods have been derived for modeling DEA installation trajectories. However, obtaining calibration data for these models has not been economical. The development of a small scale experimental apparatus, known as the Laponite Tank, was developed for this thesis. The Laponite Tank provides a quick and economical means of measuring DEA trajectories, visually. The experimental data can then be used for calibrating models. The installation process of suctions caissons has benefited from from a more rational approach. Nevertheless, these methods require refinement <b>and</b> <b>removal</b> methodology requires development. In this thesis, an algorithm for modeling suction caisson installation in clay has been presented. An analytical method and modeling algorithm for removal processes of suction caissons in clay was also developed. The <b>installation</b> <b>and</b> <b>removal</b> models were calibrated to field data. These analytical and experimental studies can provide a better understanding of installation of drag embedment anchors <b>and</b> the <b>installation</b> <b>and</b> <b>removal</b> of suction caissons...|$|R

50|$|A superbolt, or multi-jackbolt {{tensioner}} is {{an alternative}} type of fastener that retrofits or replaces existing nuts, bolts, or studs. Tension in the bolt is developed by torquing individual jackbolts, which are threaded through {{the body of the}} nut and push against a hardened washer. Because of this, the amount of torque required to achieve a given preload is reduced. <b>Installation</b> <b>and</b> <b>removal</b> of any size tensioner is achieved with hand tools, which can be advantageous when dealing with large diameter bolting applications.|$|R
