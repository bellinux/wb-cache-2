2500|$|A related {{constraint}} {{is imposed}} by the relative timescales seen in some bursts between the short-timescale variability and the total length of the GRB. Often this variability timescale is far shorter than the total burst length. For example, in bursts as long as 100 seconds, {{the majority of the}} energy can be released in short episodes less than 1 second long. If the GRB were due to matter moving towards Earth (as the relativistic motion argument enforces), it is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> it would release its energy in such brief interludes. The generally accepted explanation for this is that these bursts involve the collision of multiple shells traveling at slightly different velocities; so-called [...] "internal shocks". The collision of two thin shells flash-heats the matter, converting enormous amounts of kinetic energy into the ...|$|E

One strong argument is that Lansdowne, Secretary of State for War, did not believe the Boers were preparing for war, and also believed that if Britain were to send large numbers of troops, it would strike too aggressive a posture and so prevent a negotiated settlement being reached or even encourage a Boer attack.|$|R

30|$|First of all, {{it must be}} {{said that}} we had to repeat the {{national}} survey after interviewers reported that respondents found some questions <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand.</b> This is <b>why</b> we needed to clarify, for example, the difference between greenhouse gasses and local air pollutants, and between land consumption and the occupation of urban space; moreover, we had to add some practical examples to explain what we meant by ‘waste generated by mobility’. It remains that some respondents could have responded superficially, without signalling to the interviewer that they did not completely understand the question. 13 This is a problem which could be managed only by direct contact with citizens: ex-ante, through focus groups aimed at reaching a shared terminology; ex-post, through structured arena, where citizens could deliberate on the results emerging from the survey.|$|R

In 1990, Carol Downer, founder of the Los Angeles FWHC and leader in the women’s health movement, responded to the controversy: “Most of the criticisms I’ve heard revolve around hierarchy… I might say it was the difference between being organized and disorganized… It’s <b>hard</b> for me <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> anyone who goes into a political arena doesn’t want to be as organized as they can possibly be… if you really are serious about what you are doing.

6000|$|I never {{understood}} {{how it was}} that Gordon’s mission of peace [...] became one of war. But we knew the nobleness of his philanthropy, [...] and we trusted him to the uttermost, as it was our duty to do. He [...] never informed us that he had himself changed {{the character of the}} [...] mission. It seemed strange that one who bore in his hands a [...] charter of liberation should be besieged and threatened; but we [...] took everything for granted in his favour, and against his [...] enemies; and we could hardly do otherwise. Our obligations in this [...] respect were greatly enhanced by the long interruption of [...] telegraphic communication. It was our duty to believe that, if we [...] could only know what he was prevented from saying to us, [...] contradictions would be reconciled, and language of excess [...] accounted for. We now know from the letters of Mr. Power that when [...] he was at Khartoum with Colonel de Coetlogon before Gordon’s [...] arrival, a retreat on Berber had been actually ordered; it was [...] regarded no doubt as a serious work of time, because it involved [...] the removal of an Egyptian population;(327) but it was deemed [...] feasible, and Power expresses no doubt of its accomplishment.(328) [...] As far as, amidst its inconsistencies, a construction can be put [...] on Gordon’s language, it is to the effect that there was a [...] population and a force attached to him, which he could not remove [...] and would not leave.(329) But De Coetlogon did not regard this [...] removal as impracticable, and was actually setting about it. Why [...] Gordon did not prosecute it, why we hear no more of it from Power [...] after Gordon’s arrival, is a mystery. Instructed by results we now [...] perceive that Gordon’s title as governor-general might naturally [...] be interpreted by the tribes in the light of much of the language [...] used by him, which did not savour of liberation and evacuation, [...] but of powers of government over the Soudan; powers to be used [...] benevolently, but still powers of government. Why the Mahdi did [...] not accept him is not <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand,</b> but <b>why</b> was he not [...] accepted by those local sultans, whom it was the basis of his [...] declared policy to re-invest with their ancient powers, in spite [...] of Egypt and of the Mahdi alike? Was he not in short interpreted [...] as associated with the work of Hicks, and did he not himself give [...] probable colour to this interpretation? It must be borne in mind [...] that on other matters of the gravest importance—on the use of [...] Turkish force—on the use of British force—on the employment of [...] Zobeir—Gordon announced within a very short time contradictory [...] views, and never seemed to feel that there was any need of [...] explanation, in order to account for the contradictions. There is [...] every presumption, as well as every sign, that like fluctuation [...] and inconsistency crept into his words and acts as to the [...] liberation of the country; and this, if it was so, could not but [...] produce ruinous effects. Upon the whole, it seems probable that [...] Gordon, perhaps insensibly to himself, and certainly without our [...] concurrence, altered the character of his mission, and worked in a [...] considerable degree against our intentions and instructions.|$|R

60|$|If the {{preceding}} analysis, or something resembling it, be not the correct {{account of the}} notion of justice; if justice be totally independent of utility, and be a standard per se, which the mind can recognize by simple introspection of itself; it is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> that internal oracle is so ambiguous, and why so many things appear either just or unjust, according to the light in which they are regarded. We are continually informed that Utility is an uncertain standard, which every different person interprets differently, and that there is no safety but in the immutable, ineffaceable, and unmistakeable dictates of Justice, which carry their evidence in themselves, and are independent of the fluctuations of opinion. One would suppose from this that on questions of justice there could be no controversy; that if we take that for our rule, its application to any given case could leave us in as little doubt as a mathematical demonstration. So far is this from being the fact, that there is as much difference of opinion, and as fierce discussion, about what is just, as about what is useful to society. Not only have different nations and individuals different notions of justice, but, in the mind of one and the same individual, justice is not some one rule, principle, or maxim, but many, which do not always coincide in their dictates, and in choosing between which, he is guided either by some extraneous standard, or by his own personal predilections.|$|E
