He was also appointed Officer of the Belgian Order of Leopold.|$|E
5|$|As a spouse, surgeon, and mother, Meredith has cited {{a number}} times {{that she did}} not want to be like either of her parents: her father had {{followed}} her mother around pathetically before leaving to be happy, while her mother valued her career over her family. Meredith is frequently conflicted trying to balance between the two, and fears her family are hindering her medical aspirations, as much as she fears becoming like her mother whenever she's tempted to choose surgery over family. Meredith and Cristina <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> rift when Cristina confirms Meredith's fears by stating that Meredith's skills have fallen behind Cristina's due to her familial obligations taking her away from OR time.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, McKellen, {{at the age}} of 18, won a {{scholarship}} to St Catharine's College, Cambridge, where he read English literature. He has since been made an Honorary Fellow of the College. While at Cambridge, McKellen {{was a member of the}} Marlowe Society, where he appeared in 23 plays over the course of 3 years. At that young age he was already giving performances that have since become legendary such as his Justice Shallow in Henry IV alongside Trevor Nunn and Derek Jacobi (March 1959), Cymbeline (as Posthumus, opposite Margaret Drabble as Imogen) and Doctor Faustus. During this period McKellen had already been directed by Peter Hall, John Barton and Dadie Rylands all of whom would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> impact on McKellen's future career.|$|E

5|$|Because {{of their}} large size, {{elephants}} <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> {{impact on their}} environments and are considered keystone species. Their habit of uprooting trees and undergrowth can transform savannah into grasslands; when they dig for water during drought, they create waterholes {{that can be used}} by other animals. They can enlarge waterholes when they bathe and wallow in them. At Mount Elgon, elephants excavate caves that are used by ungulates, hyraxes, bats, birds and insects. Elephants are important seed dispersers; African forest elephants ingest and defecate seeds, with either no effect or a positive effect on germination. The seeds are typically dispersed in large amounts over great distances. In Asian forests, large seeds require giant herbivores like elephants and rhinoceros for transport and dispersal. This ecological niche cannot be filled by the next largest herbivore, the tapir. Because most of the food elephants eat goes undigested, their dung can provide food for other animals, such as dung beetles and monkeys. Elephants can {{have a negative impact on}} ecosystems. At Murchison Falls National Park in Uganda, the overabundance of elephants has threatened several species of small birds that depend on woodlands. Their weight can compact the soil, which causes the rain to run off, leading to erosion.|$|E
5|$|In past Zelda titles, {{the team}} had made {{numerous}} new fields for player exploration, but this time they limited the number of overworlds to three and expanded their content so players {{would be able to}} full appreciate them through repeated visits. The team also created the world based on their experiences with Twilight Princess: feeling that the overworld and dungeons were too large with puzzles too thinly dispersed, the team both sought to compact areas and have environmental puzzles in the overworld. The biggest difficulty was ensuring that players could reach areas quickly while still discovering new features and puzzles. The creation of the Skyloft overworld was due to difficulties connecting the three Surface-based overworlds with each other due to drastically contrasting environments. The sky was initially going to be presented similar to the course selection screen from the Super Mario series, but this was changed to an overworld with its own quests and population so Link had a place where he could prepare for his adventures. An initial idea, when jumping down from the sky seemed unlikely to be approved, was to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> tower acting as a central hub, with the height at which Link jumped lengthening the duration of his free fall. Once the concept of traveling from the sky had been chosen instead, the Loftwing mounts were created so it looked and felt more rational to players. These overlapping gameplay mechanics triggered the creation of Skyloft, along with elements of the early game such as the Knight Academy. The continual movements and routines of Skyloft's people were modeled after similar time-driven mechanics from , with similar links between character-specific side quests and the main narrative. Despite the aerial element, the mechanics necessary for free navigation meant a Loftwing racing minigame could not be implemented.|$|E

25|$|Ocean {{currents}} can {{transport water}} {{over thousands of}} kilometres, and may bring water with different temperature and salinity into a region. Some ocean currents <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> effect on local climate, for instance the warm water of the North Atlantic drift moderates the climate of the north west coast of Europe.

25|$|Though {{the creek}} has little {{military}} value, it holds immense economic gain. Much {{of the region}} is rich in oil and gas below the sea bed, and control over the creek would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> bearing on the energy potential of each nation. Also once the boundaries are defined, it would help in {{the determination of the}} maritime boundaries which are drawn as an extension of onshore reference points. Maritime boundaries also help in determining the limits of Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) and continental shelves. EEZs extend to 200nautical miles (370km) and can be subjected to commercial exploitation.|$|E
25|$|Powered flight {{has evolved}} {{unambiguously}} only four times—birds, bats, pterosaurs, and insects. In contrast to gliding, which has evolved more frequently but typically {{gives rise to}} {{only a handful of}} species, all three extant groups of powered flyers <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> number of species, suggesting that flight is a very successful strategy once evolved. Bats, after rodents, have the most species of any mammalian order, about 20% of all mammalian species. Birds have the most species of any class of terrestrial vertebrates. Finally, insects (most of which fly {{at some point in their}} life cycle) have more species than all other animal groups combined.|$|E
25|$|Prakash Thakur, the {{chairman}} of the People for Environment Horticulture & Livelihood of Himachal Pradesh, announcing his support for retail reforms claimed FDI is expected to roll out produce storage centers that will increase market access, reduce the number of middlemen and enhance returns to farmers.

25|$|In {{spite of}} their limited {{lifespan}} and discography, The Faith were a seminal influence on the early hardcore punk movement in Washington, D.C. Their songs not only stand up {{with the best of}} D.C. hardcore, but with hardcore as a whole. After breaking up in 1983, the members from The Faith continued to shape the sound of D.C. punk in their later projects. Nearly all of their membership moved on to either Embrace or Rites of Spring. An often under-appreciated D.C. band, They went in two years from being one of the most pissed off and aggro early hardcore bands to introducing a melodic element that would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> influence on the future of D.C. punk.|$|E
25|$|In 1910 Wilson became Director of Military Operations at the British War Office. As DMO Wilson {{headed a}} staff of 33, divided into five sections: MO1 was “Strategic & Colonial”, MO2 “European, MO3 “Asiatic”, {{and the others were}} “Geographic” and “Miscellaneous”. He was {{initially}} impressed only by the mapping section (and one of his first acts was to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> map of the Franco–German frontier hung on his office wall). He soon restructured the sections into MO1 (responsible for the forces of the Crown, including those in India; the Territorial Army was deemed part of Home Defence and answered to the Director of Military Training), MO2 (France and Russia) and MO3 (the Triple Alliance).|$|E
25|$|Mars' {{atmosphere}} is so thin and wispy that solar heating {{of dust and}} ice in the atmosphere - not heating of the atmospheric gases - is more important in driving weather. Small, suspended particles of dust and water ice - aerosols - intercept 20–30% of incoming sunlight, even under relatively clear conditions. So variations in the amounts of these aerosols <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> influence on climate. CRISM has taken three major kinds of measurements of dust and ice in the atmosphere: targeted observations whose repeated views of the surface provide a sensitive estimate of aerosol abundance; special global grids of targeted observations every couple of months designed especially to track spatial and seasonal variations; and scans across the planet's limb to show how dust and ice vary with height above the surface.|$|E

25|$|Tomari is very {{athletic}} and competitive, so {{in high school}} she joined the track and field club. In contrast to Hazumu and Yasuna who are not athletes and rather feminine, Tomari is a tomboy who does not often partake in traditionally feminine things such as clothing, shopping, or cosmetics. In her entire life, Tomari never wore a yukata during the annual summer festival, and has to borrow on old one from her mother when she finally does wear one during the summer festival shortly after Hazumu's transformation. At least two of Tomari's female friends on the track team consider her very masculine, and like her cool character; one of these friends even says that if Tomari were a boy that she would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> crush on her. Unlike Yasuna, Tomari {{has a lot of}} difficulty when it comes to her affection towards Hazumu, but still ends up with her.|$|E
25|$|After the 1973 general {{election}} Fine Gael {{came to power}} in a coalition government with the Labour Party with Liam Cosgrave as Taoiseach. FitzGerald hoped that he would take over as Minister for Finance, particularly after a good performance in a pre-election debate with the then Minister for Finance George Colley. However the position went to Richie Ryan, with FitzGerald becoming Minister for Foreign Affairs. It was a case of history repeating itself as FitzGerald's father had held that post in a government led by Liam Cosgrave's father W. T. Cosgrave fifty years earlier. His appointment to Iveagh House (the headquarters of the Department of Foreign Affairs) would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> effect on FitzGerald's own career and the future of Fine Gael. Cosgrave was suspicious of FitzGerald's liberal ideas and believed that he had designs on the leadership. During his period at Foreign Affairs, Fitzgerald developed a good relationship with Liam Cosgrave and all the tension that had existed between them in opposition disappeared.|$|E
25|$|Chad is devastated when Lexie reveals she has {{cancer and}} Stefano is murdered. Chad is furious {{to learn that}} Will is a suspect and after Melanie tries to defend Will, they <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> fight, and she presumably skips town. Chad mourns Lexie's passing all alone. It is {{revealed}} that Melanie had been kidnapped; the couple is reunited underground as the tunnels beneath Salem collapse. Chad attacks Melanie's captor, Andrew (Caleb Hunt) but he manages to escape before the collapse. Chad overhears Andrew's deathbed confession about Gabi's involvement in the kidnapping and confronts her. However, he agrees to keep the secret to protect Melanie and warns Gabi {{to stay away from}} Melanie. Chad also kicks Gabi out of his apartment and backs out of their modeling gig. Chad proposes to Melanie hoping to keep her safe from Nick Fallon. Chad attacks Nick when he mistakenly believes Nick hurt Melanie again. Unable to forgive Chad for his angry outburst, Melanie calls off the engagement and skips town. Chad briefly reunites with Abigail and exacts revenge on Gabi when he reveals at her wedding to Nick that Will is the father of her unborn child. Abigail dumps Chad forcing Lexie's brother, Cameron Davis (Nathan Owens) to come to her aid. Chad and Abigail eventually patch things up when they learn Cameron has been moonlighting as a stripper. She agrees to a date, but later backs out. Chad is touched when Will and Gabi name their baby Arianna after Grace. Chad is mistakenly led to believe he has a brain tumor, and lies to Cameron about his diagnosis to keep him away from Abigail. Chad and Abigail consummate their relationship only for Chad to get shot at EJ and Sami Brady's engagement party. Though he survives, Abigail dumps him after she discovers his lie about the tumor. On October 30, 2013, Stefano accompanies Chad to Boston for a surgery to repair damage from the bullet.|$|E
