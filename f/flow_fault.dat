Hail Creek Mine already possessed a P&H 4100 XPC DC electric rope shovel that had been in operation for approximately two years. To date there had been little work done on evaluating the operation of the 4100 DC electric rope shovel, and no work had been done into investigating the intended operation of the 4100 AC shovel.

40|$|This {{research}} is part of an overall effort to develop an evaluator of fault detection and diagnostics (FDD) tools of vapor compression systems (Yuill and Braun, 2012). The evaluator needs a large database of performance data of systems under both faulted and non-faulted conditions. The types of faults include non-standard charging, heat exchanger fouling, compressor <b>flow</b> <b>fault,</b> liquid line restriction and presence of non-condensable. However, conducting experiments to build the database is expensive and time-consuming. Empirical modeling may induce data outside the applicability domain of the model in the database. Forward modeling of vapor compression systems requires many details of the systems that may be unavailable. It may also require multiple tuning methods with experimental data for accuracy. Consequently, inverse modeling, where parameters of models are trained from experimental data directly without detailed knowledge of systems, is chosen to construct the models and to generate the database in this project. ^ Although models have been developed for simulating faulted impacts on vapor compression systems, they are not quick enough to generate the database and do not cover all faults studied by the evaluator (Rossi, 1997; Harms, 2002; Shen, 2006). These models also require detailed specification of the systems in addition to the tuning of heat transfer coefficients and other models for accurate simulation. However, inverse modeling approaches need less knowledge of the system than the empirical approach and fewer tuning procedures and less time to build than the forward approach. It is also capable to simulate all the faults investigated by the evaluator and satisfies the needs of the evaluator. ^ Data from eleven cooling systems tested by different parties were collected. These systems were tested under various types of faults such as non-standard charging, heat exchanger fouling, compressor <b>flow</b> <b>fault,</b> liquid line restriction and presence of non-condensables. Semi-empirical component models were developed with data filtering to avoid predicting unrealistic outcomes. Weighted parameter estimation was carried out during the training process to reduce the effect of imbalanced test matrices on the coefficients. The leverage of the parameter estimation result and the range of training data were also studied to define the applicability domain of the models. Component models were joined together to form a system model. A quasi-Newton method and a constrained optimization algorithm were used to solve the system model with good speed and robustness. An existing charge tuning method was modified to increase the accuracy of charge inventory estimation. The final simulation results were validated with experimental data by comparing estimated performance variables with the experimental data and predicted changes of performance with the measured changes of performance with fault level. The validated simulation was used to study the impacts of different faults on different types of sample systems (an fixed orifice (FXO) system, an FXO system with an accumulator and a thermostatic expansion valve (TXV) system) by plotting the change of coefficient of performance, evaporator heat transfer rate, compressor power consumption and SHR with increasing fault level. ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{reviews the}} data {{concerning}} the fracture network and the hydraulic characteristics of faults in an active zone of the Gulf of Corinth. Pressure gap measured through fault planes shows that in this area the active normal faults (Aigion, Helike) act, at least temporarily and locally, as transversal seal. The analysis of the carbonate cements in the fractures on both the hangingwall and the footwall of the faults also suggests that they have acted as local seals during the whole fault zone evolution. However, the pressure and {{the characteristics of the}} water samples measured in the wells indicate that meteoric water circulates from the highest part of the relief to the coast, which means it goes through the fault zones.

Then laboratory thin section observations have been done to recognize the different fault rocks characterizing the fault zone components.

40|$|With the {{continuous}} {{decline in the}} price of second-generation (2 G) high temperature superconducting (HTS) tapes, the 2 G HTS cables are a promising candidate to significantly improve the electrical power transmission capacity and efficiency. In order to make the HTS cable competitive to its counterparts in the power market, much ongoing research work have made considerable contributions to the HTS cable design. In this thesis, the challenges of electrical issues of superconducting power cable using 2 G HTS tapes have been addressed. The specific contributions of the thesis include: the influence of anisotropic characteristics of 2 G HTS is investigated in order to increase critical current of HTS cable; For improvement of transmission efficiency and safety, the homogenization of HTS cable current distribution is achieved considering the influence of contact resistances and HTS layer inductances; AC loss of HTS cable is obtained through experimental measurement for cooling system design; and the impact of HTS cable on power grids is analysed for safe integration of HTS cable into grids. This thesis starts with a literature review of superconductivity and developments of 2 G HTS cable. Following the literature review is the critical current investigation of HTS cable considering the anisotropy of 2 G HTS tape. 2 G HTS tapes were placed in a highly uniform electromagnetic field and the in-field critical currents were measured with various magnitudes and orientations of the magnetic field. The anisotropic characteristics of 2 G HTS tape were determined by non-linear curve fitting using measured in-field critical currents and further implemented into the HTS cable finite element method (FEM) modelling. The modelling results indicate that the gap distances among the tapes in the HTS cable affect the critical current of the HTS cable due to the anisotropic characteristics. In order to investigate the critical current of HTS cable with respect to gap distances, an HTS cable circuit model with adjustable gap distances among the parallel placed HTS tapes was designed and built. Extensive experimental and FEM modelling were performed and the results indicate that the minimized gap distance among the neighboring HTS tapes can be beneficial to increase the overall cable critical current. With DC transporting current, the homogenization of current distribution of HTS cable is achieved by controlling the contact resistances. A 1. 5 m long prototype HTS cable consisted of two HTS layers was fabricated and tested as a further investigation of the HTS cable circuit model. The magnitude of the contact resistance related to each HTS layer was measured to quantitatively calculate the current distribution. It is found that only a few micro-ohms difference of contract resistances can still cause severe imbalanced current distribution. The FEM modelling work was carried out to obtain the balanced current distribution by varying the contact resistances. With AC transporting current, the inductances of HTS layers in the cable also pose a significant influence on current distribution issues. An optimal algorithm was developed to achieve homogeneous current distribution by optimal design of the cable diameter, pitch angle and winding direction. Another short prototype cable wound with two HTS layers was built according to the optimal design and the current distribution was experimentally measured between the two layers. It is found out that the optimal algorithm is effective to homogenize the AC current distribution. A reliable AC loss measurement was carried out on the 1. 5 m long prototype HTS cable in order to quantify the AC loss of the HTS cable for cooling system design. The experimental measurement method is based on the electrical four probe method adopting a compensation coil to cancel the large inductive component of the cable. The HTS cable with long geometry is easily influenced by the surrounding electromagnetic field so that the measured AC loss signal can be influenced. In order to overcome this problem, a symmetrical current return path was utilized in order to eliminate the electromagnetic interface surrounding the HTS cable. The AC loss measurement results are stable and low-noise for a set of AC frequencies, which proves the accuracy of the measurement technique. Finally, a new superconductor component in PSCAD/EMTDC (Power System Computer Aided Design/Electromagnetic Transients including DC) was developed in order to investigate the impact of the HTS cable integrated into the meshed power network. The superconductor component developed in PSCAS/EMTDC takes into account the heat exchange with the HTS cable cryogenic envelope and the detailed configuration of YBCO HTS tape so that HTS cable model is able to accurately predict the power <b>flow,</b> <b>fault</b> current level and grid losses of the power grid with HTS cables...|$|E

In this study, numerical simulation was applied to investigate hydrothermal fluid flow in the Wabamun Group, Parkland field, NE. B. C., Canada. Numerical results indicate that faults {{play a critical role in}} controlling hydrothermal fluid <b>flow.</b> <b>Faults</b> provide fluid pathways connecting the basement of the basin with the overlying sedimentary layers. Upwelling fluid <b>flow</b> via <b>faults</b> brings reactants and heat from underlying strata to shallow formations for diagenetic reactions (e. g. dolomitization and/or chertification) or forming ore deposits. Fault properties, such as permeability, dip angle and depth of penetration, control the hydrothermal fluid flow patterns and magnitudes. The salinity distribution of formation water, permeability configuration of host rock, regional heat regime and regional fluid flow are also important factors affecting hot and brine fluid flow and accompanying heat and mass distribution. High salinity fluids in problem domain restrict the upwelling of hot fluid flow driven by buoyancy force. If the salinity of fluids in the modeled domain is high enough, and the resulting brine gravity is strong enough, the cold seawater will enter the system via faults mixing with the ascending hot brines along the faults from the deep basin.

30|$|The {{degree to}} which a fault zone is {{stressed}} is an indicator of the potential of that fault to act as a conduit for fluid <b>flow.</b> <b>Faults</b> subject to conditions close to failure are described as critically stressed and are conducive to fluid flow. (Sibson 1994, 1996; Barton et al. 1995; Morris et al. 1996; Ito and Zoback 2000; Townend and Zoback 2000; Zoback and Townend 2001; Micklethwaite et al. 2015). The stress state of faults can be described in terms of slip tendency (Morris et al. 1996) and dilation tendency (Ferrill et al. 1999). These are quantitative indicators of the resolved shear and normal stresses on faults and therefore allow evaluation of the relative variation in stress state along a single fault and between individual faults. An important caveat is that slip and dilation tendencies do not incorporate frictional fault strength and therefore do not indicate the complete stress state of a fault. In the tectonically active western USA, we assume that most Neogene faults will be relatively near a critically stressed state, such that slip and dilation tendencies serve as appropriate proxies for the stress state as it pertains to the fluid flow potential of a fault.|$|R

Impact depends upon number, size, type {{and location of}} DER in the distribution system. Moreover, as the location of DER in distribution system varies, the configuration of distribution systems also changes. Generally, the distribution systems are radial in nature and over current based protection schemes are set for unidirectional <b>flow</b> of <b>fault</b> currents. Penetration of DER usually causes meshed configuration of distribution systems and on majority of distribution feeders, <b>fault</b> current <b>flows</b> in both the directions [4].

Moreover, there is a requirement of additional number of direction over current relays.

In addition to these requirements, the impact may also reach to upstream transmission lines connected with downstream DER connected distribution systems. Under such operational conditions, the distance relays installed on the transmission line may result in underreact operation [8].|$|R
