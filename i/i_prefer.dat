25|$|I can do either, but <b>I</b> <b>prefer</b> the first.|$|E
25|$|I {{continue}} to get further away from the usual painter's tools such as easel, palette, brushes, etc. <b>I</b> <b>prefer</b> sticks, trowels, knives and dripping fluid paint or a heavy impasto with sand, broken glass or other foreign matter added.|$|E
25|$|I am now {{quite happy}} to be {{breaking}} up. Things getting much too big and uncontrollable. All along we've wanted to keep our hands on everything, so nothing happened that we didn't want to. With international and multi-format/multi-territorial shit, that's proving elusive. <b>I</b> <b>prefer</b> to cut it off rather than have it turn into another Gross Rock Spectacle.|$|E
50|$|<b>Id</b> <b>prefer</b> (it) if you didnt {{mention this}} to anyone.|$|R

25|$|My {{painting}} {{does not}} come from the easel. <b>I</b> <b>prefer</b> to tack the unstretched canvas to the hard wall or the floor. I need the resistance of a hard surface. On the floor I am more at ease. I feel nearer, more part of the painting, since this way I can walk around it, work from the four sides and literally be in the painting.|$|E
25|$|Dispositions {{are also}} {{importantly}} public and hence observable. If <b>I</b> <b>prefer</b> brie to Camembert but keep this fact secret— never showing my preference, scrupulously giving no evidence from which my preference may be observed or deduced — then the preference remains strictly private. It may be aptly called a preference, {{but it is}} not a disposition in Bourdieu's sense and arguably not in the everyday sense either. A disposition performs, enacts a preference; however trivial, even when disputing the relative merits of cheeses, a disposition is a public declaration of where one stands, what one's allegiances are.|$|E
25|$|But {{my family}} {{acquired}} {{in the time of}} my father a plot of land upper than Mart Moura. It is called Marg el-Dayr and it belonged to the family Mousa. Its conversion into an orchard caused the cleaning of an oratory in decline devoted to Saint Augustine. Would it be rather there the place of celebration of the synod? <b>I</b> <b>prefer</b> to believe it because the place in question is on the border of the famous village of Bqoufa, also ruined, but from which we know that the prelates of the family Rizzi are originated, prelates who led our Church in those times with three successive patriarchs.|$|E

25|$|The {{cultural}} invasion {{is like a}} leafy tree {{which prevents}} us from seeing our own sun, sky and stars. Therefore {{in order to be}} able to see the sky above our heads, our task is to cut this tree off at the roots. US imperialism understands very well the magic of communication through music and persists in filling our young people with all sorts of commercial tripe. With professional expertise they have taken certain measures: first, the commercialization of the so-called 'protest music'; second, the creation of 'idols' of protest music who obey the same rules and suffer from the same constraints as the other idols of the consumer music industry – they last a little while and then disappear. Meanwhile they are useful in neutralizing the innate spirit of rebellion of young people. The term 'protest song' is no longer valid because it is ambiguous and has been misused. <b>I</b> <b>prefer</b> the term 'revolutionary song'.|$|E
500|$|... ("Even {{if we were}} {{descended from}} Jews ten times over, and even though I may be, in principle, {{completely}} in favour of equal rights for Hebrews, in social life <b>I</b> <b>prefer</b> Christians...") which could be read to imply that she was of Jewish ancestry.|$|E
500|$|... "I {{want to make}} a {{profound}} and continuous study of this ancient nation. The enthusiasm brought me by the study of their monuments, their power and knowledge filling me with admiration, all of this will grow further as I acquire new notions. Of all the people that <b>I</b> <b>prefer,</b> I shall say that none is as important to my heart as the Egyptians." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{took the}} upper road. In certain moods <b>I</b> <b>preferred</b> {{it to the}} path along the cliff. I walked fast. The {{exercise}} was soothing.|$|R
60|$|Don Jose. Pardon me, sir. It has {{not been}} presented. With this doubt in my mind, <b>I</b> <b>preferred</b> to submit it first to you.|$|R

500|$|The Joker {{serves as}} an {{unreliable}} narrator. He admits to his own uncertainty, as he has disparate memories of the single event ("Sometimes I remember it one way, sometimes another... If I'm {{going to have a}} past, <b>I</b> <b>prefer</b> it to be multiple choice!"), accentuating the comic's depiction of [...] "a world unraveling toward relentless urban violence and moral nihilism..." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{forming the}} Beau Brummels with lead vocalist Sal Valentino, Elliott {{wanted to create}} {{simplified}} music that had mainstream appeal. He noted that [...] "Laugh, Laugh" [...] had a [...] "very complex chord structure, but instead of using the major seventh chords and the passing chords that <b>I</b> <b>prefer,</b> I wrote the song in flat major and minor keys using a simplified tonal structure." ...|$|E
500|$|Ben Bard as Mr. Brun, {{the leader}} of the Palladists, who is {{determined}} to have Jacqueline killed for her transgression of their secrecy rules. He proclaims his convictions to Satan {{at the end of the}} film, asking Jason and Dr. Judd, [...] "Who knows what is wrong or right? If <b>I</b> <b>prefer</b> to believe in Satanic majesty and power, who can deny me? What proof can you bring that good is superior to evil?" ...|$|E

60|$|After all, <b>I</b> <b>preferred</b> this enigmatical {{young man}} to his celebrated compatriot, the great Peter Ivanovitch. But I saw no reason for being {{particularly}} gracious.|$|R
30|$|The videos overall were useful. They {{explained}} the chain {{rule in the}} same way {{over a long period of}} time which <b>I</b> <b>preferred.</b> All three were useful.|$|R
500|$|Critics {{have given}} [...] "Bye Bye Nerdie" [...] {{generally}} positive reviews. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented that [...] "While this isn’t saying much, 'Nerdie' provides one of Season 12’s better shows. Both plots work well, though <b>I</b> <b>prefer</b> the childproofing side of things; it peters {{out at the}} end, but it has some good bits. The episode keeps us interested and entertained." [...] Mac McEntire of DVD Verdict cited the scene in which the children imagine {{what kind of person}} the new student is as the greatest moment in the episode.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the various}} changes from real-life events, Abagnale {{believed}} Spielberg {{was the only}} filmmaker who [...] "could do this film justice". However, Abagnale had little involvement with the film. In November 2001, he had [...] "never met nor spoken to Steven Spielberg and I have not read the script. <b>I</b> <b>prefer</b> not to. I understand that they now portray my father in a better light, as he really was. Steven Spielberg has told the screenplay writer (Jeff Nathanson) that he wants complete accuracy in the relationships and actual scams that I perpetrated", Abagnale reported. [...] "I hope {{in the end the}} movie will be entertaining, exciting, funny and bring home an important message about family, childhood and divorce".|$|E
500|$|I'm {{not sure}} how that will play out. The geneticists, if you read their papers, have long been using code words. They sort of dropped the term [...] "race" [...] about 1980 or earlier, and instead you see code words like [...] "population" [...] or [...] "population structure." [...] Now that they're able to define race in genetic terms they tend to use other words, like [...] "continental groups" [...] or [...] "continent of origin," [...] which does, indeed, {{correspond}} to the everyday conception of race. When I'm writing <b>I</b> <b>prefer</b> {{to use the word}} race because that's the word that everyone understands. It's a word with baggage, but it's not necessarily a malign word.|$|E

500|$|Zakuani was {{eligible}} {{to play for}} both Congo and England. He considers London his hometown but still sees himself as Congolese. Of his five siblings, , his older brother Gabriel Zakuani plays for English club Northampton Town {{and is a member}} of the Congolese national team. He might have been able to play for the United States if granted citizenship. He expressed interest in representing the Congolese national team early in his professional career, but considered his chances of playing for England [...] "a long shot". Later in his career, he expressed interest in playing for the United States, saying, [...] "of the three, <b>I</b> <b>prefer</b> the States as this is where I made my name as a player".|$|E
500|$|The {{house is}} a frame structure, covered with white wooden clapboards, {{anchored}} to a stone foundation. The Priestleys built their home out of wood, dried in trenches on the site, because no stone or brick was available in the area. Joseph wrote {{a detailed description of}} the drying process, concluding: [...] "A house constructed with such boards <b>I</b> <b>prefer</b> to one of brick and stone". This may have prompted journalist William Cobbett to caustically label the house a [...] "shed" [...] in one of his political tirades against Joseph. The central section of the house has a slate gable roof with a railing-enclosed deck. The house has [...] "three internal gable end chimneys, one for the main kitchen", and one each at the north and south ends of the central section.|$|E
500|$|Though {{a number}} of backstories have been given, a {{definitive}} one {{has not yet been}} established for the Joker. An unreliable narrator, the character is uncertain of who he was before and how he became the Joker: [...] "Sometimes I remember it one way, sometimes another... if I'm going to have a past, <b>I</b> <b>prefer</b> it to be multiple choice!" [...] A story about the Joker's origin appeared in Detective Comics #168 (February 1951), nearly a decade after the character's debut. Here, the character is a laboratory worker who becomes the Red Hood (a masked criminal) to steal a million dollars from his employer and retire. He falls into a vat of chemical waste when his heist is thwarted by Batman, emerging with bleached white skin, red lips, green hair and a permanent grin.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will go with}} Mr. Carvel, my friends," [...] {{he cried}} at once. And he invited me into the house whilst he ordered his coach. <b>I</b> <b>preferred</b> to remain outside.|$|R
