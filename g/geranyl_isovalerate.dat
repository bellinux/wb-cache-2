40|$|The hydrodistilled {{aerial parts}} oil of Pycnocycla spinosa var. spinosa was {{analyzed}} by GC and GC/MS. Thirty three components were identified. <b>Geranyl</b> <b>isovalerate</b> (14. 9 %), caryophyllene oxide (10. 6 %), &# 945;-eudesmol (9. 2 %) &szlig;-citronellol (7. 2 %), elemicin (6. 8 %), r-cymene (4. 7 %), citronellyl acetate (4. 3 %), and &# 945;-cadinol (3. 3 %) were found as major components...|$|E
40|$|Water-distilled {{essential}} oil from aerial parts of Ferula ovina (Boiss.) Boiss. growing wild at the vegetative stage in Isfahan province Iran was analyzed by GC/MS. Forty-three compounds consisting 86. 7 % {{of the total}} components were identified in the oil which was obtained in 1. 0 % (v/w) yield. Among them, carvacrol (9. 0 %), alpha-pinene (8. 2 %), <b>geranyl</b> <b>isovalerate</b> (7. 2 %) and geranyl propionate (7. 0 %) were the major components...|$|E
40|$|Water-distilled {{essential}} oils from aerial parts of Tanacetum chiliophyllum (Fisch. & Mey.) Schultz Bip. var. monocephalum Grierson from Turkey {{were analyzed by}} GC and GC/MS. The flower and stem oils were characterized by camphor (17. 3 %, 10. 4 %), 1, 8 -cineole (8. 3 %, 2. 5 %) and unknown compounds M + 218 (6. 6 %, 10. 4 %), M + 220 (Stem: 9. 2 %). Root oil was characterized with hexadecanoic acid (37. 5 %), alismol (6. 3 %), <b>geranyl</b> <b>isovalerate</b> (5. 3 %). Antibacterial activity of the flower and stem oils were evaluated on Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus epidermis, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, and Meticillin resistant S. aureus microorganisms by using a micro-dilution assay. Flower oil inhibited the growth of Bacillus cereus with the MIC 62. 5 Âµg/mL which was 2 fold less concentration than the positive control chloramphenicol. Both flower and stem oils showed relative toxicity to Vibrio fischeri in the TLC- bioluminescence assay...|$|E
40|$|By {{naturally}} occurring gene-transformation Ri-plasmids of Agrobacterium rhizogenes have been {{integrated into the}} plant genome of Chamomillo recutita, thereby inducing the formation of hairy roots. Clones with the best biosynthetic potential were multiplied for phytochemical investigations. The amounts of terpenoid and polyene compounds in the genetically transformed cultures were compared with those in in-vivo plants. In Hungary a wild chamomile population was found which contained significant amount of (-) -alpha-bisabolol in the oil from the inflorescence. We used biotechnological methods to preserve the genome of this wild type. Transformed chamomile root cultures were obtained by infection of sterile organized cultures with Agrobacterium rhizogenes strains #A- 4,# 15834, and #R- 1601. Hairy roots freed from bacteria were cultivated on solid medium and then in liquid, hormone-free, B 5 and MS media. The qualitative and quantitative composition of the essential oil was examined by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. The volatile compounds were identified by comparing their retention times with those of authentic standards and of essential oils of known composition, and by peak enrichment. Confirmation of identity was achieved by comparison of mass spectra with those {{reported in the literature}} and those of reference compounds. The amount of each component {{as a percentage of the}} total was determined by area normalization. GC and GC-MS studies showed that genetically transformed chamomile cultures generated the terpenoid and polyene compounds most characteristic of the parent plant. The main components of hairy root cultures were trans-beta-farnesene, alpha-farnesene, <b>geranyl</b> <b>isovalerate,</b> and cedrol. We identified beta-selinene as a new component of the genetically transformed cultures...|$|E
