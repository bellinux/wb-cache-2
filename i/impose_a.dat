5|$|A {{drawback}} {{of carrying}} WE.177 on external pylons was a limitation due to aerodynamic heating of the bomb's casing.

5|$|Calhoun's {{ideas on}} the {{concurrent}} majority are illustrated in A Disquisition on Government. The Disquisition is a 100-page essay on Calhoun's definitive and comprehensive ideas on government, which he worked on intermittently for six years until its 1849 completion. It systematically presents his arguments that a numerical majority in any government will typically <b>impose</b> <b>a</b> despotism over a minority unless some way is devised to secure the assent of all classes, sections, and interests and, similarly, that innate human depravity would debase government in a democracy.|$|E
5|$|Chad {{has more}} than 200 {{distinct}} ethnic groups, which create diverse social structures. The colonial administration and independent governments have attempted to <b>impose</b> <b>a</b> national society, but for most Chadians the local or regional society remains the most important influence outside the immediate family. Nevertheless, Chad's peoples may be classified according to the geographical region in which they live.|$|E
5|$|However, Thio Li-ann {{believes}} that it is undesirable that {{the law does not}} <b>impose</b> <b>a</b> timeframe for the calling of by-elections. If a by-election is not called promptly upon a parliamentary seat falling vacant, the electors in the GRC in question will be represented to a lesser extent. This is particularly pertinent where more than one MP vacates his or her seat or when the seat vacated is that of a minority candidate. Should the latter situation arise, the rationale behind the GRC scheme – to guarantee minority representation in Parliament – would be defeated.|$|E

5|$|In December 2001, {{a series}} of deposit runs began to have a severe impact {{on the health of}} the banking system, leading the Argentine {{authorities}} to <b>impose</b> <b>a</b> partial deposit freeze. With Argentina no longer in compliance with the conditions of the expanded IMF-supported program, the IMF decided to suspend disbursements. At the end of December, in a climate of severe political and social unrest, the country partially defaulted on its international obligations; in January 2002, it formally abandoned the convertibility regime.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} argued, however, that {{there exists a}} problem if a {{government}} minister simply needs to state that a national security interest {{is involved in a}} matter, upon which the rules of natural justice are immediately compromised. Thio Li-ann has commented that when important constitutional rights such as the freedom to religion are curtailed by legislation, it may be advisable for the court to <b>impose</b> <b>a</b> duty on a public authority to give reasons establishing that an order imposed by the authority is objectively valid.|$|E
