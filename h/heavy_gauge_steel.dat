40|$|Light <b>gauge</b> <b>steel</b> {{frame wall}} systems are {{commonly}} used in industrial and commercial buildings, {{and there is a}} need for simple fire design rules to predict their load capacities and fire resistance ratings. During fire events, the light <b>gauge</b> <b>steel</b> frame wall studs are subjected to non-uniform temperature distributions that cause thermal bowing, neutral axis shift and magnification effects and thus resulting in a combined axial compression and bending action on the studs. In this research, a series of full-scale fire tests was conducted first to evaluate the performance of light <b>gauge</b> <b>steel</b> frame wall systems with eight different wall configurations under standard fire conditions. Finite element models of light <b>gauge</b> <b>steel</b> frame walls were then developed, analysed under transient and steady-state conditions and validated using full-scale fire tests. Using the results from fire tests and finite element analyses, a detailed investigation was undertaken into the prediction of axial compression strength and failure times of light <b>gauge</b> <b>steel</b> frame wall studs in standard fires using the available fire design rules based on Australian, American and European standards. The results from both fire tests and finite element analyses were used to investigate the ability of these fire design rules to include the complex effects of non-uniform temperature distributions and their accuracy in predicting the axial compression strength of wall studs and the failure times. Suitable modifications were then proposed to the fire design rules.

40|$|AbstractThe axial {{compressive}} strength capacity of concrete-filled light <b>gauge</b> <b>steel</b> composite columns was assessed through an experimental program involving twelve long and fourteen stub columns with width-to-thickness ratio of 125 for the encasing steel section. A comparison between concrete-only and confined stub columns {{demonstrated that the}} stub column experiences an increase of strength of up to 16 % due to confinement. The {{compressive strength}} contribution of the light <b>gauge</b> <b>steel</b> section was limited by local buckling. Specifically, the steel-only stub column sections lacking the concrete core experienced, on average, approximately 33 % of its full compressive strength. The full-scale composite columns illustrated that the axial compressive strength capacity was controlled by end bearing capacity and local buckling of the light <b>gauge</b> <b>steel.</b> The axial compression strength capacity of the full-scale composite columns was satisfactorily predicted based on end bearing resistance of the concrete core and local strains in the light <b>gauge</b> <b>steel.</b> Furthermore, the 33 % strength contribution established from the steel-only sections provided a satisfactory lower bound estimate for the calculation of axial compressive strength...|$|R

Only with the construction of the road were non-First Nations allowed on this land. A lookout exists on the lower eastern plateau at an elevation of 300 m, providing a view of Thunder Bay and the city’s harbour. A small memorial commemorates Aboriginal people that fought in wars. There is a path on the eastern face of the mountain {{that can be used for}} hiking. Plants on the mountain include red and sugar maple and poison ivy (animikiibag—“thunder-leaf” in the Ojibwe language). The top of the mountain has glacial erratics and jack pines. A small grove of yellow birch grows just south of the entrance gate. A small, unmaintained trail can be used to reach the top from the lookout via the north face, with a <b>heavy</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>steel</b> cable that can be used for support.

40|$|The use of <b>heavy</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>steel</b> sheets for {{structural}} applications very often requires {{a combination of}} high yield strength and adequate toughness. The most cost effective way to realize a high yield strength and a high ductility in a low alloyed steel is grain refinement. In industrial practice, this refinement is realized by controlled processing. This process consists of controlling the slab reheating temperature, applying {{a large amount of}} hot deformation below the nonrecrystallization temperature (T-nr) and accelerated cooling. A better knowledge of T-nr could optimize the process and the best mechanical properties could be reached against the lowest cost. T-nr can be raised by the addition of microalloying elements such as Nb. Nb can retard the static recrystallization of austenite at low temperatures either by solute drag or by precipitation pinning. In this study, the recrystallization behavior of five Nb-microalloyed model alloys with various Nb contents, was evaluated by double hit compression tests. Further, the precipitation state of the materials was investigated experimentally by Inductively Couples Mass Spectroscopy and X-ray Diffraction. The construction of recrystallization-time-temperature diagrams and precipitation-time-temperature diagrams showed that both mechanisms, i. e. recrystallization and precipitation, strongly influence each other...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Brittle crack {{arrestability}} {{is extremely}} important in welded joints of <b>heavy</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>steel</b> plates used in large container ships. Recently, much attention {{has been focused on}} potential crack propagation along welds using large heat input. This paper examines the application of a T-joint to the strength deck structure of container ships to enhance crack arrestability. The crack arrest toughness, Kca, for crack arrest was varied. The ESSO test of T-joint components showed that brittle crack was arrested at the T-joint if the steel plate used for the flange had a high Kca value in the range from 4900 to 7300 N/mm 3 / 2. FE-analysis of the stress intensity factor K indicated that brittle crack propagation was arrested under the condition that the K-value at the running crack tip was less than the Kca of the material. In the T-joint, it was noted that the K-value around the area of the deepest point of the crack decreased and was finally less than the Kca of the flange plate when the brittle crack penetrated suddenly into the flange plate to a 10 mm depth. This phenomenon shows the advantage of using a T-joint for brittle crack arrest in the flange plates of strength deck structures...|$|E
40|$|The use of <b>heavy</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>steel</b> sheets for {{structural}} applications often requires {{a combination of}} high yield strength and adequate toughness. The most cost effective way to achieve high yield strength and high ductility in low alloyed steels is through grain refinement. In industrial practice, such refinement is commonly obtained by thermomechanical controlled processing (TMCP). This approach comprises slab reheating to well defined temperatures, {{a large amount of}} hot deformation below the non-recrystallisation temperature T-nr and accelerated cooling. In practice, the T-nr is generally raised by the addition of microalloying elements such as Nb and Ti. As these elements contribute substantially to the alloying costs, optimisation of their use allows for a decrease in production cost. Better understanding of the T-nr assists in tuning the rolling process so that optimum mechanical properties can be produced. One area of importance is to recognise that the concept of the T-nr was originally developed for reversing mills and the production of plate steels. Methods of defining and determining it must be modified {{if it is to be}} applied to strip mills and their associated short interpass times. The main goal of this review is to provide a concise and complete overview of the current understanding of the fundamental mechanisms that control the T-nr and to address the different methods that can be used to determine it...|$|E
