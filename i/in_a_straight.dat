5|$|Based on the {{arrangement}} of effects in New England, meteorologist William C. Redfield deduced that the wind field and center of tropical cyclones are circular; previously the winds {{were believed to be}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> line.|$|E
5|$|Green rosellas are {{generally}} encountered in pairs or small groups, though young birds may gather {{in groups of}} 20 or more outside the breeding season. They sometimes share the company of eastern rosellas. They fly <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> line, making rapid shallow wingbeats and gliding briefly in between.|$|E
5|$|In 2016 Djokovic {{collected}} {{his sixth}} Australian Open title <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> sets victory over Murray. He followed up this solid run of form {{with a record}} setting fifth Indian Wells and record equaling sixth Miami masters titles.|$|E
50|$|Olympic Snatch - A {{style of}} Snatch {{in which the}} {{backswing}} is eliminated and the bell moves <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>straighter</b> path up and down, often employed once the lifter’s forearms have fatigued {{at the end of}} a set.|$|R
50|$|In 1847 the London and South Western Railway {{opened its}} line between Bishopstoke in Hampshire and Milford station at Salisbury, {{following}} {{the route of}} the canal but <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>straighter</b> line. The railway remains open as part of the Wessex Main Line from Salisbury to Southampton.|$|R
50|$|To {{further reduce}} latency, new {{technologies}} are being employed. Wireless data transmission technology can offer speed advantages over the best cabling options, as signals can travel faster through air than fiber. Wireless transmission can also allow data to move <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>straighter,</b> more direct path than cabling routes.|$|R
5|$|Linear motions (or {{translatory}} motions), which {{move in a}} {{line between}} two points. Rectilinear motion is motion <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> line between two points, whereas curvilinear motion is motion following a curved path.|$|E
5|$|Many Americans {{are living}} {{complicated}} lives now– {{few of us}} have moved through life <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> line. I think {{many of us would}} benefit from trying to gather and synthesize the difficult political lessons we've learned over the course of our lives.|$|E
5|$|That {{road was}} built {{due to the}} threat of American attack to provide quick access from Fort Erie, and, like other {{military}} roads in Upper Canada (e.g. Dundas Street or Yonge Street), it travelled <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> line, in this case parallel to the Lake Erie shoreline.|$|E
50|$|The pier's {{construction}} {{took over}} 40 years (1854-1895). In 1898 the original curved design proved inadequate against a great storm and the centre section was destroyed. The pier was rebuilt <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>straighter</b> line and completed <b>in</b> 1909. <b>A</b> companion pier at South Shields protects the southern {{flank of the}} river mouth.|$|R

5000|$|Surgical {{treatment}} is recommended {{in cases of}} progressive fibrosis when interincisor distance becomes less than 2 cm. (Multiple release incisions deep to mucosa, submucosa and fibrotic tissue and suturing the gap or dehiscence so created by mucosal graft obtained from tongue and Z-plasty. In this procedure multiple deep z-shaped incisions are made into fibrotic tissue and then sutured <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>straighter</b> fashion.) ...|$|R
5|$|A worm whose ruleset {{begins with}} 0 {{continues}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> line forever. This is a trivial case, {{so it is}} usually stipulated that the worm must turn when it encounters a point with only uneaten gridlines. Furthermore, to avoid mirror-image symmetrical duplicates, the worm's first turn must be a right hand turn. A worm dies if it returns to its origin a third time, because there are then no untraversed edges available. Only the origin can be lethal to the worm.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of {{increased}} sales of hybrid electric vehicles in several countries, {{some members of the}} blind community have raised concerns about the noise reduction when those vehicles operate in all-electric mode, as blind people or the visually impaired consider the noise of combustion engines a helpful aid while crossing streets and feel quiet hybrids could pose an unexpected hazard. Although a 2009 study found no statistically significant difference in pedestrian crashes involving quiet hybrid vehicles when compared to noisier vehicles when both types of vehicles were travelling <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> line, it found a doubling of hybrid vehicle pedestrian crashes when reversing or parking etc. at slow speeds.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of its decommissioning, Highway44 began at a {{junction}} with Highway15 (Christian Street) {{on the west side of}} Almonte. It crossed the Mississippi River, where it became Main Street and passed through the central portion of the town. In the eastern edge of Almonte, it was known Ottawa Street until Appleton Sideroad, where it became March Road and continued eastward <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> line through farmland in the Ottawa Valley. It also passed through several forests as well as south of Greensmere Golf and Country Club before meeting what was then Highway17 at an intersection but is now an interchange with Highway417 (Exit155).|$|E

25|$|As an object's {{speed or}} {{momentum}} increases, arcs tend to flatten out in moving ahead and broaden in turns. <b>In</b> baseball, <b>a</b> fastball {{would tend to}} move <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>straighter</b> line than other pitches; while a figure skater moving at top speed {{would be unable to}} turn as sharply as a slower skater, and would need to cover more ground to complete the turn.|$|R
5|$|Despite the Serb {{being the}} {{favourite}} {{to win the}} title throughout the Championships, Murray overcame Djokovic <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> sets match that lasted over three hours, {{to become the first}} British winner of the men's singles title since Fred Perry in 1936, the first Scot of either sex to win a Wimbledon singles title since Harold Mahony in 1896, and to extend his winning streak on grass to 18 matches. With the win, he also became only the second man in the open era after Rafael Nadal to hold the Olympic singles gold medal and Wimbledon title simultaneously.|$|E
5|$|Flies tend to fly <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> line {{then make}} a rapid change in {{direction}} before continuing on a different straight path. The directional changes are called saccades and typically involve an angle of 90°, being achieved in 50 milliseconds. They are initiated by visual stimuli as the fly observes an object, nerves then activate steering muscles in the thorax that cause a small change in wing stroke which generate sufficient torque to turn. Detecting this within four or five wingbeats, the halteres trigger a counter-turn and the fly heads off in a new direction.|$|E
5|$|Galileo {{put forward}} the basic {{principle}} of relativity, {{that the laws}} of physics are the same in any system that is moving at a constant speed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> line, regardless of its particular speed or direction. Hence, there is no absolute motion or absolute rest. This principle provided the basic framework for Newton's laws of motion and is central to Einstein's special theory of relativity.|$|E
50|$|The male of {{the eastern}} form is even whiter in summer than the western bird, but as a rule may be {{distinguished}} by the line which extends across {{the base of the}} bill. Black-throated individuals of this race have a greater amount of black on the throat and face than on the western birds, and the black generally terminates more abruptly or <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>straighter</b> line.|$|R

5|$|In 1975, {{the first}} year of pipelaying, Alyeska set a goal of {{completing}} 45 percent of the 800-mile route. This would not be laid <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> line, since it was expected that river crossings would take longer to complete than portions of the pipeline on dry land. Work on the pumping stations and the Valdez Marine Terminal, which had begun in the fall of 1974, also was expected to take longer than laying pipe. Conversely, work on those two projects could proceed during the winter, when pipelaying could not take place due to the frozen ground.|$|E
5|$|In 2009 Kuznetsova {{joined the}} group again. She played against China in the quarterfinal and won in the singles over {{opponent}} Yan Zi, and in the doubles, together with Dementieva, over Sun Tiantian and Yan Zi, after losing the first set. Russia won against China <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> 5–0 final scoreline. Russia lost to Italy in the semifinal. Kuznetsova was the only winner, defeating Pennetta.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} shown that the couple created by gravity and the ground {{reaction}} forces is necessary for a bicycle to turn at all. On a custom built bicycle with spring-loaded outriggers that exactly cancel this couple, so that the bicycle and rider may assume any lean angle when traveling <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> line, riders find it impossible to make a turn. As soon as the wheels deviate from a straight path, the bicycle and rider begin to lean in the opposite direction, {{and the only way to}} right them is to steer back onto the straight path.|$|E

5|$|SR 11 {{continues}} {{north toward}} Ashtabula, meeting interchanges for SR 82 and an access {{road to the}} Youngstown-Warren Regional Airport. Urban areas transition back into rural areas here. It later intersects SR 305 and SR 5 at diamond interchanges near Cortland. The route then enters Ashtabula County, and travels <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> line, passing through US 322, a rest area, US 6, and SR 307. Mostly forests and fields are between the highway. The route slowly bends northwest, and meets I-90 at a cloverleaf interchange. The route crosses over Ashtabula River, and bypasses Ashtabula. It ends at SR 531, part of the Lake Erie Circle Tour, at a stop sign.|$|E
5|$|The Fish minigame {{involves}} manipulating a fish {{to collect}} every coin in its tank. The fish moves <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> diagonal line, and the player can alter this line by placing bubbles at certain marked points, reflecting it {{in a different}} direction. In the Japanese version of Last Specter, the Fish minigame is instead based on trying to create words by feeding them to fish, who alter them in specific patterns.|$|E
5|$|The {{strategy}} {{appears to}} work equally well in insects and in vertebrates. Simulations show that motion camouflage {{results in a}} more efficient pursuit path than classical pursuit (i.e. the motion camouflage path is shorter), whether the target flies <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> line or chooses a chaotic path. Further, where classical pursuit requires the attacker to fly faster than the target, the motion camouflaged attacker can sometimes capture the target despite flying more slowly than it.|$|E
