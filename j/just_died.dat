He reinstitutes the Stark Expo to continue his father Howard's legacy.|$|E
5|$|Learning {{from his}} father, Favre became fluent in the {{languages}} of French, English, Spanish, and the Muskogean languages including Choctaw and Chickasaw. The lands along the Gulf coast were held by the British {{for nearly two decades}} following the 1763 Treaty of Paris, but their ability to maintain control diminished during that time. On September 3, 1783 the British ceded their lands in both East and West Florida to Spain under the Treaty of Versailles. Favre's father had <b>just</b> <b>died</b> the year before this treaty, and Simon Favre followed his father's career, also inheriting his father's plantation on the Pearl River, though continuing to reside in Mobile near his mother.|$|E

5|$|In Priyadas' biography, Tulsidas is {{attributed}} {{with the power}} of working miracles. In one such miracle, he is believed to have brought back a dead Brahmin to life. While the Brahmin was being taken for cremation, his widow bowed down to Tulsidas on the way who addressed her as Saubhagyavati (a woman whose husband is alive). The widow told Tulsidas her husband had <b>just</b> <b>died,</b> so his words could not be true. Tulsidas said that the word has passed his lips and so he would restore the dead man to life. He asked everybody present to close their eyes and uttered the name of lord Rama, on doing which the dead Brahmin was raised back to life.|$|E

5|$|She often {{bears the}} brunt of Victor's temper due to muddled misunderstandings and {{in part due to}} her aloof nature. One such {{occasion}} saw Victor asking her to pick up a suit of his from the dry-cleaners, only for her to return with a gorilla costume. Another occasion saw her persuading Victor to take on a dog whose owner had <b>just</b> <b>died.</b> Victor spent time building a kennel in the garden and when Mrs Warboys arrives with the dog, she forgets to mention that the dog is stuffed - much to Victor and Margaret's consternation. On another occasion she won a competition where the prize was either to earn £500 or to have a life-size waxwork model made of herself, which had to be delivered to the Meldrews' house; she chose the waxwork. As it turned out, she hated it as much as Victor and Margaret did, and the waxwork ended up in the dustbin.|$|E
5|$|The {{remains of}} the French army had {{completely}} evacuated Russian territory by December 1812 but their defeat sparked anti-French sentiments in Germany and Prussia joined the Russians, forming a Sixth Coalition. Hostilities thus continued in early 1813 but Nansouty's wound did not yet allow {{him to return to}} action, so he was offered the prestigious position of Colonel-General of dragoons (16 January), in replacement of General Louis Baraguey d'Hilliers, who had <b>just</b> <b>died</b> of exhaustion. Nansouty's wound was very serious but he had been very lucky: the bullet that pierced his knee only tore through flesh, leaving his kneecap intact. Having missed {{the first part of the}} campaign, General Nansouty was recalled to a field command once his knee wound was cured, towards mid-1813. He accepted to take the helm of the Guard cavalry, with a complement of 5,000 sabres, and including Guyot's Grenadiers-à-cheval, Letort's Dragons, Lefebvre-Desnouettes Chasseurs-à-cheval and Édouard Colbert's Chevau-légers lanciers.|$|E
5|$|During {{his first}} session in Congress, Jennings {{had a small}} {{portrait}} of himself made, which he later gave to Ann Gilmore Hay, {{the daughter of a}} prominent Charlestown politician, whom he had recently begun courting. Hay was born in Harrodsburg, Kentucky, in 1792. Her family moved to Clark County in Indiana Territory, and settled in Charlestown. Jennings first met her when he was campaigning for Congress in 1809. After his first session in Congress ended, Jennings returned to Indiana Territory and married eighteen-year-old Ann on August 8, 1811. Ann's father had <b>just</b> <b>died</b> leaving her with no family or means of support. Following his reelection to Congress in 1811, the couple returned to Washington, where she remained briefly, before traveling to Pennsylvania to live with Jennings's sister, Ann Mitchell, {{for the remainder of the}} session. Jennings's wife suffered from ill health, which deteriorated after he became governor of Indiana in 1816, and she died after a protected illness in 1826. Later that year Jennings married Clarissa Barbee, who had come from Kentucky to teach at the Charlestown seminary. Jennings had no children from either marriage.|$|E

5|$|Jill, a {{manicurist}} {{working to}} support her family, befriends the wealthy Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper), who hires her as a personal assistant. However, things turn sour when Jill has an affair with Kay's neglected husband who didn't love her, Phillip Chancellor II (Donnelly Rhodes). Jill ends up pregnant, and Phillip divorces Kay in the Dominican Republic. Kay offered to drive him home from the airport, but ends up running the car over a cliff, killing him. On his death bed, he invalidly married Jill. Kay offered Jill $1 million for her baby, which she declined. She gave birth to Phillip Chancellor III (eventually portrayed by Thom Bierdz) in 1976. She romances David Mallory, who was the recipient of her late father Bill's eye cornea. However, she never loved him. He proposed, but she declines after Liz warned her of a loveless marriage. She {{had an affair with}} Derek Thurston (Joe Ladue) and later romanced Stuart Brooks (Robert Colbert), whose wife Jennifer had <b>just</b> <b>died.</b> He was really in love with her mother Liz, but Jill tricked him into marriage following a one-night stand. He left her after she faked a pregnancy and miscarriage. Jill wanted to reunite with Derek, who marries Katherine after she promised him a salon and a $100,000 trust for Jill's son. Derek's ex-wife Suzanne Lynch (Ellen Weston) arrives in town and wanted him back. Kay was briefly presumed dead and finding himself free of Suzanne and Kay, Derek planned to marry Jill. Kay showed up alive at the wedding and reclaimed her life with Derek.|$|E

25|$|The last {{record of}} a living Domhnall comes from 1297, and the {{earliest}} record of his son Gartnait as Mormaer is from 1305, creating the range of Domhnall's possible year of death to somewhere in between these two points. However, a document dating to 1302, containing terms of reconciliation between Edward I and Robert, stipulates that Robert should act as warden of Gartnait, implying that Domhnall had <b>just</b> <b>died.</b>|$|E

So, with eleven of Budoc's other disciples, he set up a small monastery on the Île de Tibidy, at the mouth of the Faou. However it was so inhospitable that after three years, he miraculously opened a passage through the sea to found another abbey on the opposite bank of the Landévennec estuary.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not known}} what led Ferdinando to recruit Cristofori. The Prince {{traveled}} to Venice in 1688 to attend the Carnival, so he may have met Cristofori passing through Padua on his way home. Ferdinando {{was looking for a}} new technician {{to take care of his}} many musical instruments, the previous incumbent having <b>just</b> <b>died.</b> However, it seems possible that the Prince wanted to hire Cristofori not just as his technician, but specifically as an innovator in musical instruments. It would be surprising if Cristofori at age 33 had not already shown the inventiveness for which he later became famous.|$|E
