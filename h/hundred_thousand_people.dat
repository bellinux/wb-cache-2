25|$|The 1993 Arusha Accords {{attempted}} {{to offer a}} diplomatic solution to both the RPA threat and the internal tensions, {{but it was not}} implemented. Ethnic tensions became even greater following the murder of Burundian President Melchior Ndadaye, a Hutu, in October 1993, an event that sparked the Burundian Civil War in which large numbers of both Hutus and Tutsis were killed. Hutu militants, known as Interahamwe, and elements in the government in Rwanda began to plan a genocide to rid the country of the Tutsis. The assassinations of Habyarimana and Cyprien Ntaryamira on 6 April 1994 became the pretext {{for the start of the}} Rwandan Genocide, which resulted in the deaths of several <b>hundred</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>people,</b> mostly Tutsi, over the next three months.

500|$|According to Gould, [...] "The nation {{experienced}} {{a wave of}} genuine grief at the news of McKinley's passing." [...] The stock market, faced with sudden uncertainty, suffered a steep decline—almost unnoticed in the mourning. The nation focused its attention on the casket that made its way by train, first to Washington, where it first lay in the East Room of the Executive Mansion, and then in state in the Capitol, and then was taken to Canton. A <b>hundred</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>people</b> passed by the open casket in the Capitol Rotunda, many having waited hours in the rain; in Canton, an equal number did the same at the Stark County Courthouse on September 18. The following day, a funeral service {{was held at the}} First Methodist Church; the casket was then sealed and taken to the McKinley house, where relatives paid their final respects. It was then transported to the receiving vault at West Lawn Cemetery in Canton, to await the construction of the memorial to McKinley already being planned.|$|E
500|$|In October {{that year}} Morris sold The Anvil—by then selling about 3,560copies monthly—for £1,250, plus a £200 annual {{contract}} {{to continue as}} editor. [...] Morris wanted to produce a comic the pages {{of which would be}} filled with role models whose behaviour and moral outlook he felt was socially desirable. [...] Foreigners would not be depicted as either enemies or villains, and at least one child in any group of children would be from an ethnic minority. [...] Religious values would not be imposed upon the reader, although their underlying moral tones would be made obvious on each page. [...] These were innovative but somewhat risky ideas, as nothing similar existed in the market, [...] and Hulton therefore commissioned extensive research into the new comic, which by then, inspired by the design of her church lectern, had been christened Eagle by Hampson's wife. [...] Layout and typography were designed by Morris's friend, Ruari McLean, assisted by Charles Green, and faced with an initial print run of 1million copies, Aintree printer Eric Bemrose designed and built a new ten-unit rotogravure machine in about twelve weeks. [...] The comic was heavily publicised before its release; copies were mailed direct to several <b>hundred</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>people</b> who worked with children, and a [...] "Hunt the Eagle" [...] scheme was launched, whereby large papier-mâché golden eagles were set on top of several Humber Hawk cars, and toured across the UK. [...] Those who spotted an eagle were offered tokens worth 3d, which could be exchanged at newsagents for a free copy of Eagle.|$|E
