While in hospital he applied for nine months' leave to return to Australia and complete his pharmaceutical studies. He had passed the <b>Intermediate</b> <b>Examination</b> before leaving Australia but not the Final Examination. This was granted, and he embarked for home on the transport HMAT Persic on 21 December 1917. He passed the Final Examination, and was registered as a pharmacist on 10 July 1918. He never returned to the front, and his AIF appointment was terminated on 9 August 1918.|$|E

25|$|He {{applied for}} a grant to study art at the Regent Street Polytechnic, but was {{initially}} turned down, so he read meters for a gas company {{during the day and}} took art classes in the evening. He finally got his grant and studied full-time from 1949 to 1952, completing the two-year <b>Intermediate</b> <b>Examination</b> in six months before specialising in illustration and lithography. His teachers included illustrators Stuart Tresilian and Nigel Lambourne, and lithographer Henry Trivick. He also worked as a life model, and on one such occasion in 1949 his demonstration of the functions of the muscles of the back attracted the eye of Renate Meyer, a fellow student who had left Germany with her family in 1933. They married in 1952 and four children.|$|E
2500|$|In 1904, Reilly {{was invited}} to succeed Simpson as Roscoe Professor of Architecture at Liverpool. He held the post for 29 years, {{retiring}} in 1933. In 1904 he was lecturing to classes of 11 students, mostly drawn from Liverpool and its environs. He built up the annual intake over the years of his tenure; The Times obituarist wrote [...] "In the ten years up to the 1914–18 war he made the Liverpool School of Architecture a thriving and influential institution to which students would come from {{the ends of the}} earth". Reilly lengthened the course to five years, and secured for his students exemption from the RIBA's <b>intermediate</b> <b>examination,</b> and later (1920) from its final examination also. He founded the degrees of Bachelor and Master of Architecture.|$|E
60|$|Lewisham for {{the first}} time in his life began to fancy he had {{conversational}} powers. She resolved to stir up his ambitions--an easy task. She thought he had exceptional gifts and that she might serve to direct them; she certainly developed his vanity. She had matriculated at the London University and they took the <b>Intermediate</b> <b>Examination</b> in Science together in July--she a little unwisely--which served, as almost anything will serve in such cases, as a further link between them. She failed, which in no way diminished Lewisham's regard for her. On the examination days they discoursed about Friendship in general, and things like that, down the Burlington Arcade during the lunch time--Burlington Arcade undisguisedly amused by her learned dinginess and his red tie--and among other things that were said she reproached him for not reading poetry. When they parted in Piccadilly, after the examination, they agreed to write, about poetry and themselves, during the holidays, and then she lent him, with a touch of hesitation, Rossetti's poems. He began to forget what had at first been very evident to him, that she was two or three years older than he.|$|E

6000|$|A {{few words}} may, perhaps be said {{with respect to}} the design of this volume. It is manifestly {{modelled}} upon the syllabus of the <b>Intermediate</b> <b>Examination</b> in Science of London University. That syllabus, as at present constituted, appears to me to afford considerable scope for fairly efficient biological study. The four types dealt with in this book are extremely convenient for developing the methods of comparative anatomy and morphological embryology. Without any extensive reference to related organisms, these four forms, and especially the three vertebrata, may be made to explain and illustrate one another in a way that cannot fail to be educational in the truest sense. After dealing with the rabbit, therefore, as an organic mechanism, our sections upon the frog and dog-fish, and upon development, are simply statements of differences, and a commentary, as it were, upon the anatomy of the mammalian type. In the concluding chapter, a few suggestions of the most elementary ideas of it is hoped to make this first part of our biological course complete in itself, and of some real and permanent value to the student. And the writer is convinced that not only is a constant insistence upon resemblances and differences, and their import, intellectually the most valuable, but also the most interesting, and therefore the easiest, way of studying animal anatomy. That chaotic and breathless cramming of terms misunderstood, tabulated statements, formulated [...] "tips," [...] and lists of names, in which so many students, in spite of advice, waste their youth is, I sincerely hope, as impossible with this book as it is useless for the purposes of a London candidate. On the other hand, our chief endeavour has been to render the matter of the book clear, connected, progressive, and easily assimilable. In the second part Plants, Unicellular Organisms, and Invertebrata will be dealt with, in a wider and less detailed view of the entire biological province.|$|E
