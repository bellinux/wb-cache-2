40|$|Maintenance {{of female}} sexual {{identity}} in Drosophila melanogaster involves an autoregulatory loop {{in which the}} protein Sex-lethal (SXL) promotes skipping of exon 3 from its own pre-mRNA. We have used transient transfection of Drosophila Schneider cells to analyze the role of exon 3 splice sites in regulation. Our results indicate that exon 3 repression requires competition between the 5 ′ splice sites of exons 2 and 3 but is independent of their relative strength. Two 3 ′ splice site AG's precede exon 3. We report here that, while the distal site plays {{a critical role in}} defining the exon, the proximal site is preferentially used for the actual splicing reaction, arguing for a switch in 3 ′ splice site recognition between exon definition and splicing catalysis. Remarkably, the presence of the two 3 ′ splice sites is important for the efficient regulation by SXL, suggesting that SXL interferes with molecular events occurring between <b>initial</b> <b>splice</b> site communication across the exon and the splice site pairing that leads to intron removal...|$|E
40|$|The bovine syncytial virus, {{a member}} of the {{retroviral}} subfamily Spumavirinae, causes a persistent, asymptomatic infection in cattle. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the viral genome revealed two overlapping reading frames in the 3 ' region, traditionally occupied by accessory-function genes in other complex retroviruses. In order to analyze the transcripts from the accessory-gene region, we designed oligonucleotide primers complementary to sequences within the 5 ' and 3 ' long terminal repeats (LTRs) for use with the PCR. Southern blot analysis of amplification products revealed eight major cDNA bands. Eleven distinct cDNA clones were subsequently isolated and characterized. The <b>initial</b> <b>splice</b> donor in each clone is located 49 bp downstream from the mRNA cap site in the 5 ' LTR. The primary splice acceptor site was located 17 bp upstream from the proximal 3 ' open reading frame known as BF-ORF 1. A second major splice acceptor was localized to a region upstream of the second open reading frame, BF-ORF 2. Clones were identified which spliced directly to each of these sites. Additional splice donor and acceptor sites within BF-ORF 1 and BF-ORF 2 and the 3 ' LTR were variously used to generate a complex array of multiply spliced transcripts. Each of these transcripts remained in frame and coded for a potential protein product...|$|E
40|$|The {{transcription}} map of simian parvovirus (SPV), an Erythrovirus {{similar to}} Parvovirus B 19, was investigated. RNA was extracted from tissues of experimentally infected cynomolgus macaques {{and subjected to}} reverse transcription-PCR with SPV-specific primers. The PCR products were cloned and sequenced to identify splice junctions. A total of 14 distinct sequences were identified as putative partial transcripts. Of these, 13 were spliced; a single unspliced transcript putatively encoded NS 1. Sequence analysis revealed that spliced partial transcripts may encode portions of open reading frames for the major capsid proteins VP 1 and VP 2 and smaller, unknown proteins. These unspliced and spliced transcripts and putative proteins encoded by SPV {{were similar to those}} of B 19. <b>Initial</b> <b>splice</b> junctions at nucleotides 279 and 333 were analogous to those at nucleotides 406 and 441, respectively, in B 19. Seven of the 10 splices identified had typical GT/AG donor/acceptor junctions. The splice sites were confirmed by Northern blotting and autoradiography. In contrast to B 19, which has a maximum of two splices per transcript, up to three splices were observed in SPV transcripts. A spliced transcript putatively encoding a truncated version of NS 1, as seen with minute virus of mice and adeno-associated virus 2, was also observed. The findings indicate that that the splicing pattern of transcripts of SPV and B 19 is similar, but SPV also has coding strategies in common with other parvoviruses...|$|E
40|$|The {{majority}} of mammalian pre-mRNAs contains multiple introns that are excised prior to export and translation. After intron excision, ligated exon intermediates participate in subsequent intron excisions. However, exon ligation generates an exon of increased size, {{a feature of}} pre-mRNA splicing that can interfere with downstream splicing events. These considerations {{raise the question of}} whether unique mechanisms exist that permit efficient removal of introns neighboring ligated exons. Kinetic analyses of multiple intron-containing pre-mRNAs revealed that splicing is more efficient following an initial intron removal event, suggesting that either the recruitment of the exon junction complex (EJC) to ligated exons increases the efficiency of multiple intron excisions or that the <b>initial</b> definition of <b>splice</b> sites is sufficient to permit efficient splicing of introns neighboring ligated exons. Knockdown experiments show that the deposition of the EJC does not affect subsequent splicing kinetics. Instead, spliceosomal components that are not involved in the <b>initial</b> <b>splicing</b> event remain associated with the pre-mRNA to ensure efficient removal of neighboring introns. Thus, ligated exons do not require redefinition, providing an additional kinetic advantage for exon defined splice sites. Copyright © 2010 RNA Society...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of alternative splicing in drug and biomarker discovery is best understood through several example genes. For most genes, the identification, detection and particularly quantification of isoforms in different tissues and conditions {{remain to be}} carried out. As a result, the focus in drug and biomarker development is increasingly on high-throughput studies of alternative <b>splicing.</b> <b>Initial</b> strategies for the parallel analysis of alternative splicing by microarrays have been recently published. The design specificities and goals of alternative splicing microarrays, in terms of identification and quantification of multiple mRNAs from one gene, are promoting the development of novel methods of analysis.

40|$|Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 342 {{recovered}} exceptional Paleogene {{to early}} Neogene sedimentary archives from clay-rich sediments {{in the northwest}} Atlantic Ocean. These archives present an opportunity to study Cenozoic climate in a highly sensitive region at often unprecedented resolution. Such studies require continuous records in the depth and time domains. Using records from multiple adjacent drilled holes, intervals within consecutive cores are typically spliced into a single composite record on board the JOIDES Resolution using high-resolution physical property data sets acquired before the cores are split. The highly dynamic nature of the sediment drifts drilled during Expedition 342 and the modest amplitude of variance in the physical property records {{made it possible to}} construct only highly tentative <b>initial</b> working <b>splices,</b> which require extensive postcruise follow-up work. Postcruise, high-resolution X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) core scanning data enabled the construction of a preliminary composite depth scale and splice. Here we present the revised composite depth scale and splice for IODP Site U 1406, predominantly constructed using detailed hole-to-hole correlations of revisions of the initial XRF data set, and of newly generated high-resolution XRF data. The revised composite depth scale and splice serve as a reference framework for future research on Site U 1406 sediments...|$|R
40|$|Schizosaccharomyces pombe pre-mRNAs are {{generally}} multi-intronic and share certain features with pre-mRNAs from Drosophila melanogaster, in which <b>initial</b> <b>splice</b> site pairing can occur via either exon or intron definition. Here, we present three lines of evidence suggesting that, despite these similarities, fission yeast splicing {{is most likely}} restricted to intron definition. First, mutating either or both splice sites flanking an internal exon in the S. pombe cdc 2 gene produced almost exclusively intron retention, {{in contrast to the}} exon skipping observed in vertebrates. Second, we were unable to induce skipping of the internal microexon in fission yeast cgs 2, whereas the default splicing pathway excludes extremely small exons in mammals. Because nearly quantitative removal of the downstream intron in cgs 2 could be achieved by expanding the microexon, we propose that its retention is due to steric occlusion. Third, several cryptic 5 ′ junctions in the second intron of fission yeast cdc 2 are located within the intron, in contrast to their generally exonic locations in metazoa. The effects of expanding and contracting this intron are as predicted by intron definition; in fact, even highly deviant 5 ′ junctions can compete effectively with the standard 5 ′ splice site if they are closer to the 3 ′ splicing signals. Taken together, our data suggest that pairing of splice sites in S. pombe most likely occurs exclusively across introns in a manner that favors excision of the smallest segment possible...|$|E
30|$|Continuous {{sedimentary}} {{records are}} required to apply cyclostratigraphy to sedimentary sequences. IODP expedition 346 drilled two or more holes at sites U 1425 and U 1430, from which a continuous Miocene–Pliocene stratigraphic record, or splice, was assembled for each site. During the expedition, the cores at each site were stratigraphically correlated onboard using physical properties such as natural gamma radiation (NGR), gamma ray attenuation (GRA), and color reflectance (Tada et al. 2015 b, 2015 c). On the shore, core photographs were examined to identify small faults and disturbances {{that could not have}} been identified in the physical property profiles. The <b>initial</b> <b>splice</b> was revised on the basis of several new tie points within core intervals corresponding to lithological units I and III to correct miscorrelations and avoid intervals containing sponge plugs and other discontinuities (detailed in Irino et al. 2018). This study adopted the revised splices, in which the updated core composite depth below sea floor (CCSF-D) {{is referred to as the}} revised CCSF-D in this paper, and all core depths referred to hereafter are revised CCSF-D depths. The revised CCSF-D for site U 1425 is CCSF-D patched rev 20170309 in Irino et al. (2018), and the revised CCSF-D for site U 1430 is CCSF-D patched rev 20160113 in Irino et al. (2018). To check the validity of these revised splices, we correlated the revised composite NGR data with the hostile standard gamma ray (HSGR) logging data from sites U 1425 and U 1430. Downhole logs are unaffected by core expansion because they were acquired in situ, and their records are perfectly continuous with depth. For this reason, core-log integration helps in identifying miscorrelations that may be present (e.g., deMenocal et al. 1992; Lofi et al. 2016).|$|E
40|$|Splicing {{language}} {{is the language}} which results from a splicing system. Splicing system was first introduced by Tom Head in 1987 as the mathematical model of systems of restriction enzymes acting on <b>initial</b> DNA molecules. <b>Splicing</b> languages {{are closely related to}} automata theory. Simple splicing systems can be recognized by SH-automata diagrams due to the regularity of splicing languages. SH-automaton defines exactly one language which is the language generated by the simple splicing system. In this paper, the concept of firm and maximal firm subwords are introduced. Some examples are then given to illustrate the maximal firm subwords of a word in a simple splicing system. Taking the SH-automata concept, which is a short compact way of encoding normal non-deterministic automata in the special case of SH systems, the maximal firm subwords of the initial words of an SH systems serve as the labels for the associated SH-automaton. Some examples which will show the maximal firm subwords of the words in the initial set I, the regular expression for the language generated by the given splicing system and the simplest non-deterministic automaton that recognizes the corresponding splicing system are also given. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{perception}} of Korean's three-way voiceless stop contrast {{depends on the}} combination of a number of acoustic properties including closure duration, f 0, VOT and spectral slope. Production studies indicate that these same properties systematically vary according to a stop's position in the hierarchical prosodic structure of an utterance. This study investigated interactions between prosodic structure and the recognition of tense, lax and aspirated stops by using stimuli that contained stops produced at one position in the prosodic hierarchy cross-spliced into utterances at a different prosodic level. The results of the experiment showed that recognition of tense and aspirated stops remained high regardless of the degree of mismatch between the underlying prosodic position of a segment and the domain into which it was inserted. Misrecognition rates were higher for cross-spliced lax stops, and underlying Utterance and Intonation Phrase <b>initial</b> lax stops <b>spliced</b> into the syllable level were perceived as aspirated by a majority of listeners. These findings are interpreted in terms of Cho & Keating's (2001) study of domain-initial strengthening and the acoustic overlap that is observed between stop manner and prosodic position. These results are taken as preliminary evidence that could support Cho & Keating's (2001) suggestion that prosodically conditioned acoustic differences aid listeners in discerning intended phrasings...|$|R
50|$|Spliceosomes {{are a major}} {{component}} of an integral step in eukaryotic precursor messenger RNA maturation. A mistake in even a single nucleotide can be devastating to the cell, and a reliable, repeatable method of RNA processing is necessary to ensure cell survival. The spliceosome is a large, protein-RNA complex that consists of five small nuclear RNAs (U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6) and over 150 proteins. The snRNAs, along with their associated proteins, form ribonucleoprotein complexes (snRNPs), which bind to specific sequences on the pre-mRNA substrate. This intricate process results in two sequential transesterification reactions. These reactions will produce a free lariat intron and ligate two exons to form a mature mRNA. There are two separate classes of spliceosomes. The major class, which is far more abundant in eukaryotic cells, splices primarily U2-type introns. The <b>initial</b> step of <b>splicing</b> is the bonding of the U1 snRNP and its associated proteins to the 5’ splice end to the hnRNA. This creates the commitment complex which will constrain the hnRNA to the splicing pathway. Then, U2 snRNP is recruited to the spliceosome binding site and forms complex A. U2 snRNP changes the conformation of the hnRNA-snRNP complex, exposing the nucleotide favorably for splicing. Following the conformation change, the U4/U5/U6 tri-snRNP complex binds to complex A to form the structure known as complex B. After rearrangement, complex C is formed, and the spliceosome is active for catalysis. In addition to this main spliceosome complex, there exists a much less common (~1%) minor spliceosome. This complex comprises U11, U12, U4atac, U6atac and U5 snRNPs. These snRNPs are functional analogs of the snRNPs used in the major spliceosome. The minor spliceosome splices U-12 type introns. The two types of introns mainly differ in their splicing sites: U2-type introns have GT-AG 5’ and 3’ splice sites while U12-type introns have AT-AC at their 5’ and 3’ ends. The minor spliceosome carries out its function through a different pathway from the major spliceosome.|$|R
