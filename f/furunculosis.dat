50|$|Hospital <b>furunculosis</b> is a {{cutaneous}} {{condition that}} can be epidemic in the hospital setting, characterized histopathologically by a deep abscess with both lymphocytes and neutrophils.|$|E
5000|$|Transmission of <b>furunculosis</b> mainly occurs through fish-to-fish contact by {{the skin}} or by ingestion. Rainbow trout {{have been found}} to carry A. salmonicida up to two years after initial {{infection}} without re-exposure. Chemically immunosuppressed fish compared with temperature-stressed fish had a 73% mortality as opposed to a 33% mortality rate, respectively. Naturally occurring trout infections consisted of a 5-6% mortality rate per week with an 85% rate in untreated populations. Some clinical <b>furunculosis</b> survivors of an infected trout population became A. salmonicida carriers.When comparing <b>furunculosis</b> epidemics with depressed oxygen levels, when oxygen concentrations were decreased to less than 5 mg/l, A. salmonicida concentrations increased. While observing chum salmon in a density of 14.7 fish per square meter, 12.4% were infected with A. salmonicida, whereas, densities at 4.9 fish per square meter were infection-free. [...] Additionally, A. salmonicida concentrations were considerably elevated in water with low dissolved oxygen (6-7 mg/l), compared to water with higher dissolved oxygen (10 mg/l). High density-low oxygen water resulted in survival rates that were roughly 40% less than in those consisting of low density-high oxygen conditions.|$|E

50|$|Aeromonas salmonicida is a {{pathogenic}} bacterium that severely impacts salmonid populations and other species. It was first {{discovered in a}} Bavarian brown trout hatchery by Emmerich and Weibel in 1894. Aeromonas salmonicida's ability to infect a variety of hosts, multiply, and adapt, make it a prime virulent bacterium. A. salmonicida is an etiological agent for <b>furunculosis,</b> a disease that causes septicemia, haemorrhages, muscle lesions, inflammation of the lower intestine, spleen enlargement, and death in freshwater fish populations. It is found worldwide {{with the exception of}} South America. The major route of contamination is poor water quality; however, it can also be associated stress factors such as overcrowding, high temperatures, and trauma. Spawning and smolting fish are prime victims of <b>furunculosis</b> due to their immunocompromised state of being.|$|E

50|$|Usually, {{the cause}} is {{bacteria}} such as staphylococci that are present on the skin. Bacterial colonisation begins in the hair follicles and can cause local cellulitis and inflammation. Myiasis caused by the tumbu fly in Africa usually presents with cutaneous furuncles. Risk factors for <b>furunculosis</b> include bacterial carriage in the nostrils, diabetes mellitus, obesity, lymphoproliferative neoplasms, malnutrition, and use of immunosuppressive drugs.|$|E
50|$|<b>Furunculosis</b> is {{classified}} into four categories based on severity: acute, subacute, chronic, or latent. When fish are infected, they become listless and weak until they die. Other characteristics observed include anorexia and lethargic movement, {{and they may}} exhibit a darkened pigment. Deep or shallow ulcers, exophthalmia, bloody spots, distended abdomen, and petechia {{at the base of}} the fin may also occur. Internally, the infected fish may suffer from gastroenteritis, hemorrhagic septicemia, edematous kidney, and an enlarged spleen. The liver may appear pale in color and the spleen may be darkened. The peritoneal cavity may also be bloody and inflamed.|$|E
50|$|Boils are bumpy, red, pus-filled lumps {{around a}} hair {{follicle}} that are tender, warm, and very painful. They range from pea-sized to golf ball-sized. A yellow or white {{point at the}} center of the lump can be seen when the boil is ready to drain or discharge pus. In a severe infection, an individual may experience fever, swollen lymph nodes, and fatigue. A recurring boil is called chronic <b>furunculosis.</b> Skin infections tend to be recurrent in many patients and often spread to other family members. Systemic factors that lower resistance commonly are detectable, including: diabetes, obesity, and hematologic disorders. Boils can be caused by other skin conditions that cause the person to scratch and damage the skin.|$|E

40|$|Staphylococcus aureus is a {{major cause}} of skin and soft tissue infections, such as furuncles, carbuncles, and abscesses, but it also {{frequently}} colonizes the human skin and mucosa without causing clinical symptoms. Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) is a pore-forming toxin that has been associated with soft tissue infections and necrotizing pneumonia. We have compared the genotypes, virulence gene repertoires, and phage patterns of 74 <b>furunculosis</b> isolates with those of 108 control strains from healthy nasal carriers. The large majority of <b>furunculosis</b> strains were methicillin sensitive. Clonal cluster (CC) 121 (CC 121) and CC 22 accounted for 70 % of the <b>furunculosis</b> strains but for only 8 % of the nasal isolates. The PVL-encoding genes luk-PV were detected in 85 % of <b>furunculosis</b> strains, while their prevalence among colonizing S. aureus strains was below 1 %. luk-PV genes were distributed over several lineages (CCs 5, 8, 22, 30, and 121 and sequence type 59). Even within the same lineages, luk-PV-positive phages characterized <b>furunculosis</b> strains, while their luk-PV-negative variants were frequent among nasal strains. The very tight epidemiological linkage between luk-PV and <b>furunculosis,</b> which could be separated from the genetic background of the S. aureus strain {{as well as from the}} gene makeup of the luk-PV-transducing phage, lends support to the notion of an important role for PVL in human <b>furunculosis.</b> These results make a case for the determination of luk-PV in recurrent soft tissue infections with methicillin-sensitive as well as methicillin-resistant S. aureus...|$|E

Chemotactic response to zymosan-activated serum and background neutrophil motility was comparable among the three groups. The increased neutrophil chemotactic response of patients with active infection to bacterial factors, but not zymosan-activated serum, may represent a specific neutrophil response to products of infecting organisms.

40|$|Aeromonas salmonicida is the causative {{organism}} of fish <b>furunculosis,</b> a serious communi-cable disease affecting primarily Salmonidae and notifiable under the United Kingdom Diseases of Fish Act, 1937.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Isolated {{lymphedema}} of {{the penis}} is extremely rare: combined {{involvement of the}} scrotum and penis is the norm. <b>Furunculosis</b> as a cause is not, to our knowledge, previously reported. We present a case of isolated penile lymphedema that responded to excision of lymphedematous tissue and reconstruction with flaps. Case presentation A 32 -year-old Arab man presented with a three-year history of a gradually increasing, painless penile swelling. Our patient's main complaint was non-erectile sexual dysfunction. The swelling was preceded by at least three prior episodes of severe <b>furunculosis</b> at the penile root. He had no other contributory past medical or family history. On examination there was gross penile enlargement, maximally at the mid shaft, associated with thickened skin at the sites of prior <b>furunculosis.</b> The glans and scrotum were normal. Both testes were palpable. Serology for filariasis, and urinary tract ultrasound and computed tomography scan were normal. The clinical diagnosis was lymphedema following recurrent penile <b>furunculosis.</b> At operation the lymphedematous tissues were removed. Closure of the penile shaft was accomplished by bilateral advancement of flaps from {{both ends of the}} penis. He resumed normal sexual activity one month after surgery. At 12 months, he had a good cosmetic result, with no signs of recurrence. Conclusions <b>Furunculosis</b> at the penile root may result in lymphedema confined to the penile shaft, sparing the scrotum.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Furunculosis,</b> {{a disease}} caused with gram {{negative}} bacteria Aeromonas salmonicida produces heavy losses in aquaculture. Vaccination against <b>furunculosis</b> reduces mortality of Atlantic salmon but fails to eradicate infection. Factors that determine high individual variation of vaccination efficiency remain unknown. We used gene expression analyses {{to search for}} the correlates of vaccine protection against <b>furunculosis</b> in Atlantic salmon. Results Naïve and vaccinated fish were challenged by co-habitance. Fish with symptoms of <b>furunculosis</b> at the onset of mass mortality (LR - low resistance) and survivors (HR - high resistance) were sampled. Hepatic gene expression was analyzed with microarray (SFA 2. 0 - immunochip) and real-time qPCR. Comparison of LR and HR indicated changes associated with the protection and results obtained with naïve fish were used to find and filter the vaccine-independent responses. Genes involved in recruitment and migration of immune cells changed expression in both directions with greater magnitude in LR. Induction of the regulators of immune responses was either equal (NFkB) or greater (Jun) in LR. Expression levels of proteasome components and extracellular proteases were higher in LR while protease inhibitors were up-regulated in HR. Differences in chaperones and protein adaptors, scavengers of reactive oxygen species and genes for proteins of iron metabolism suggested cellular and oxidative stress in LR. Reduced levels of free iron and heme can be predicted in LR by gene expression profiles with no protection against pathogen. The level of complement regulation was greater in HR, which showed up-regulation of the components of membrane attack complex and the complement proteins that protect the host against the auto-immune damages. HR fish was also characterized with up-regulation of genes for proteins involved in the protection of extracellular matrix, lipid metabolism and clearance of endogenous and exogenous toxic compounds. A number of genes with marked expression difference between HR and LR can be considered as positive and negative correlates of vaccine protection against <b>furunculosis.</b> Conclusion Efficiency of vaccination against <b>furunculosis</b> depends largely on the ability of host to neutralize the negative impacts of immune responses combined with efficient clearance and prevention of tissue damages. </p...|$|E
