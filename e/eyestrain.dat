5|$|When Tomoyo After was ported to the PlayStation 2 (PS2), {{improvements}} to the game were included. This edition's scenario was expanded by the original staff after {{the removal of the}} adult content consisting of sex scenes. Yūto Tonokawa wrote some of the additional story for Takafumi and Kanako. With the added scenario and visuals combined, the PS2 edition is 1.5 times longer than the Windows edition. In the original version, the entire cast excluding Tomoya Okazaki, had full voice acting; this was not changed for the PlayStation 2 version. Added support was included so as to make the visuals on the television sharper than in the past with visual novels played on a consumer console rather than on a computer screen. The PS2 version also reduced flickering of the picture, reducing <b>eyestrain.</b>|$|E
25|$|Carl Fisher {{was born}} in Greensburg, Indiana, nine {{years after the end}} of the American Civil War, the son of Albert H. and Ida Graham Fisher. Apparently {{suffering}} from alcoholism, a problem which would also plague Carl later in life, his father left the family when Fisher was a child. Suffering from severe astigmatism, it was difficult for Carl to pay attention in school, as uncorrected astigmatism can cause headaches or <b>eyestrain,</b> and blur vision at all distances. He quit school when he was twelve years old to help support his family.|$|E
25|$|Proper {{protection}} such as {{welding goggles}} should be worn at all times, including {{to protect the}} eyes against glare and flying sparks. Special safety eyewear must be used—both to protect the welder {{and to provide a}} clear view through the yellow-orange flare given off by the incandescing flux. In the 1940s cobalt melters’ glasses were borrowed from steel foundries and were still available until the 1980s. However, the lack of protection from impact, ultra-violet, infrared and blue light caused severe <b>eyestrain</b> and eye damage. Didymium eyewear, developed for glassblowers in the 1960s, was also borrowed—until many complained of eye problems from excessive infrared, blue light, and insufficient shading. Today very good eye protection can be found designed especially for gas-welding aluminum that cuts the sodium orange flare completely and provides the necessary protection from ultraviolet, infrared, blue light and impact, according to ANSI Z87-1989 safety standards for a Special Purpose Lens.|$|E
500|$|GamePro {{considered}} the gun [...] "well-designed" [...] and [...] "fairly good-looking", though they {{wrote that the}} gun's options buttons were inconvenient and that the Menacer's lengthy recalibrations before play sessions without Accu-Sight were tedious. Mean Machines wrote that the gun's shades of gray clashed with the glossy black console. Several reviewers called the binocular scope addition unhelpful. Paul Mellerick of Mega found the manual sights an <b>eyestrain</b> and the gun [...] "deadly accurate" [...] as long as players used the Accu-Sight mode. Still, as of January 1993, Mega felt that the Menacer's future success was doubtless. Jaz of Mean Machines had low expectations for the Menacer, which he compared to the shortcomings of previous light guns: high price, short-lived novelty, and dearth of games. Gus of Mean Machines wrote that [...] "Sega hasn't learned the lessons" [...] from the Super Scope's [...] "fairly naff" [...] release in the magazine's January 1993 Menacer review, calling the light gun a [...] "samey-looking, samey-playing piece of hardware, with some redundant add-ons" [...] with mediocre launch titles. He added that the Menacer was less tiring to use than the Super Scope, praised the Menacer's infrared, and criticized the gun's lack of available software.|$|E
2500|$|Photosensitive {{epilepsy}} - This is an epileptic {{reaction to}} flashing lights in susceptible persons, which can range in severity from an unusual feeling or involuntary twitch to a generalized seizure. [...] This epileptogenic response can {{be triggered by}} lights flashing in the frequency range of 10–20Hz, regardless of color. [...] While individual light sources used on emergency vehicles generally have much lower flash rates than this, the Loughborough study suggests that such possibilities be minimized. [...] It also notes that emergency workers may report distraction and <b>eyestrain</b> unrelated to epilepsy from working under the lights.|$|E

50|$|Some {{viewers have}} complained of headaches, {{seizures}} and <b>eyestrain</b> after watching 3D films. There {{have been several}} warnings, especially for the elderly. Motion sickness, {{in addition to other}} health concerns, is more easily induced by 3D presentations.|$|E
50|$|Parkinson {{returned}} from Washington {{to become the}} Secretary of the Department in 1977. Whilst head of the department, he suffered severe <b>eyestrain.</b> In 1979, he left his Secretary role {{to return to the}} United States as Australian Ambassador once again.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1960s, Pickett Brand {{developed}} the [...] "Eye Saver Yellow" [...] slide rule, which was produced {{with a specific}} yellow color (Angstrom 5600) that reflects long-wavelength rays and promotes optimum eye-ease to help prevent <b>eyestrain</b> and improve visual accuracy.|$|E
50|$|Extracts from rue {{have been}} used to treat <b>eyestrain,</b> sore eyes, and as insect repellent. Rue has been used {{internally}} as an antispasmodic, as a treatment for menstrual problems, as an abortifacient, and as a sedative.Ruta graveolens and Ruta chalepensis are often confused in scientific literature.|$|E
50|$|Herbalists use {{eyebright}} as a poultice with {{or without}} concurrent administration of a tea for the redness, swelling, and visual disturbances caused by blepharitis and conjunctivitis. The herb is also used for <b>eyestrain</b> and to relieve inflammation caused by colds, coughs, sinus infections, sore throats and hay fever.|$|E
5000|$|Convergence insufficiency. Patients who {{experience}} <b>eyestrain,</b> [...] "tired" [...] eyes, or diplopia (double vision) while reading or performing other near work, {{and who have}} convergence insufficiency may benefit from orthoptic treatment. Patients whose outward drift occurs at distance rather than at near distance are less ideal candidates for treatment.|$|E
50|$|Some {{viewers have}} complained of {{headaches}} and <b>eyestrain</b> after watching 3D films. Motion sickness, {{in addition to}} other health concerns, are more easily induced by 3D presentations. One published study shows that of those who watch 3D films, nearly 55% experience varying levels of headaches, nausea and disorientation.|$|E
50|$|Astigmatism {{is a type}} of {{refractive}} error in which the eye does not focus light evenly on the retina. This results in distorted or blurred vision at all distances. Other symptoms can include <b>eyestrain,</b> headaches, and trouble driving at night. If it occurs early in life it can result in amblyopia.|$|E
50|$|However, images {{optimized}} {{for a small}} screen viewed from a short distance will show excessive parallax when viewed with more ortho methods, such as a projected image or a head mounted display, possibly causing <b>eyestrain</b> and headaches, or doubling, so pictures {{optimized for}} this viewing method may not be usable with other methods.|$|E
50|$|Video screens have {{a design}} process for user interface. Video screens can cause <b>eyestrain</b> from {{prolonged}} viewing. Cathode ray tubes are what {{are used to}} display the information on your computer. These send off radiation. This is a concern that has been taken into account when designing better computer screens for user interface.|$|E
5000|$|At first glance, each {{is tempted}} by the {{establishment}} of relations of direct causation between working conditions and health consequences or effectiveness. A noisy situation makes deaf, carrying heavy loads of produce musculoskeletal disorder, bad lighting, <b>eyestrain,</b> etc.. Unfortunately, this approach has important limitations: protection against noise may prohibit access to the machine, etc. ...|$|E
50|$|The Cybook Gen1 was Bookeen's only product until 2006/2007, {{when they}} began {{exploring}} E-ink screens. At the time, E-Ink screens were a new technology and claimed to have a near paper-like appearance that did not cause <b>eyestrain.</b> In late 2007 Bookeen began selling the Cybook Gen3, their first eBook reader to use an E-Ink screen.|$|E
50|$|Presbyopia is a {{condition}} associated with aging of the eye that results in progressively worsening ability to focus clearly on close objects. Symptoms include difficulty reading small print, having to hold reading material farther away, headaches, and <b>eyestrain.</b> Different people will have different degrees of problems. Other types of refractive errors may exist {{at the same time}} as presbyopia.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{symptoms}} {{most people}} notice are difficulty reading fine print, particularly in low light conditions, <b>eyestrain</b> when reading for long periods, blurring of near objects or temporarily blurred vision when changing the viewing distance. Many extreme presbyopes complain that their arms have become [...] "too short" [...] to hold reading material {{at a comfortable}} distance.|$|E
50|$|Surveys of {{the victims}} (in 1998 and 2001) showed that many were still {{suffering}} from post-traumatic stress disorder. In one survey, twenty percent of 837 respondents complained that they felt insecure whenever riding a train, while ten percent answered that they tried to avoid any nerve-attack related news. Over sixty percent reported chronic <b>eyestrain</b> and said their vision had worsened.|$|E
50|$|For {{those with}} large degrees of anisometropia, {{spectacle}} correction may cause {{the person to}} experience a difference in image magnification between the two eyes (aniseikonia) which could also prevent the development of good binocular vision. This can {{make it very difficult}} to wear glasses without symptoms such as headaches and <b>eyestrain.</b> However, the earlier the condition is treated, the easier it is to adjust to glasses.|$|E
50|$|According to the US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, {{computer}} vision syndrome affects about 90% {{of the people}} who spend three hours or more a day at a computer.Another study in Malaysia was conducted on 795 university students aged between 18 and 25. The students experienced headaches along with <b>eyestrain,</b> with 89.9% of the students surveyed feeling any type of symptom of CVS.|$|E
50|$|To avoid <b>eyestrain</b> and distortion, {{each of the}} two 2D images {{should be}} {{presented}} to the viewer so that any object at infinite distance is perceived by the eye as being straight ahead, the viewer's eyes being neither crossed nor diverging. When the picture contains no object at infinite distance, such as a horizon or a cloud, the pictures should be spaced correspondingly closer together.|$|E
5000|$|Frequent use of blue {{light-emitting}} devices {{has also}} been linked to cataracts and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Computer vision syndrome, or digital <b>eyestrain,</b> has been identified by the American Optometric Association {{as a cause of}} headaches, blurred vision, and muscle pain. The Mayo Clinic states that [...] "people who look at screens two or more hours every day are at greatest risk of this condition." ...|$|E
