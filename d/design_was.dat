5|$|Early {{contributions}} to design management show how different design disciplines were coordinated to achieve business objectives at a corporate level, and demonstrate the early understanding of design as a competitive force. In that context, <b>design</b> <b>was</b> merely {{understood as an}} aesthetic function, and the management of <b>design</b> <b>was</b> {{at the level of}} project planning.|$|E
5|$|His first {{project for}} Webb and Knapp was an {{apartment}} building with funding from the Housing Act of 1949. Pei's <b>design</b> <b>was</b> based on a circular tower with concentric rings. The areas closest to the supporting pillar handled utilities and circulation; the apartments themselves were located toward the outer edge. Zeckendorf loved the design and even showed it off to Le Corbusier when they met. The cost of such an unusual <b>design</b> <b>was</b> too high, however, and the building never moved beyond the model stage.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} U-type, column-orthogonal and nearly column-orthogonal designs. Nearly column-orthogonal <b>designs</b> <b>are</b> very useful {{in cases where}} column-orthogonal <b>designs</b> <b>are</b> not known. New <b>designs</b> <b>are</b> {{obtained}} which are suitable for screening experiments. In certain cases, the constructed <b>designs</b> <b>are</b> shown to be optimal {{with respect to their}} aliased structure. The aliased structures, of U-type, column-orthogonal and nearly column-orthogonal <b>designs,</b> <b>are</b> calculated and presented in closed form. This fact makes the new approach innovating and enables the construction of <b>designs</b> that <b>are</b> different from the designs constructed in the literature. An extended multiplication theorem and new infinite families of column-orthogonal <b>designs</b> <b>are</b> presented using periodic Golay pairs...|$|R
40|$|The STEP {{electronic}} system <b>design</b> <b>is</b> discussed. The {{purpose of the}} <b>design</b> <b>is</b> outlined. The {{electronic system}} <b>design</b> <b>is</b> summarized and it is found that: an effective conceptual system <b>design</b> <b>is</b> developed; the <b>design</b> represents {{a unique set of}} capabilities; makes efficient use of available orbiter resources; the system capabilities exceed identified potential experiment needs...|$|R
40|$|A {{class of}} {{efficient}} and economical response surface <b>designs</b> that can <b>be</b> constructed using known <b>designs</b> <b>is</b> introduced. The proposed class of <b>designs</b> <b>is</b> {{a modification of}} the Central Composite Designs, in which the axial points of the traditional central composite <b>design</b> <b>are</b> replaced by some edge points of the hypercube that circumscribes the sphere of zero center and radius a. An algorithm {{for the construction of}} these <b>designs</b> <b>is</b> developed and applied. The constructed <b>designs</b> <b>are</b> suitable for sequential experimentation and have higherD-values than those of known composite designs. The properties of the constructed <b>designs</b> <b>are</b> further discussed and evaluated in terms of rotatability, blocking, and D-optimality under the full second-order mode...|$|R
5|$|In 2003, {{under the}} code name Project 28, the Indian Navy placed {{an order for}} four ASW corvettes. The corvette's <b>design</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} planned {{to be based on}} the Russian corvette Project 2038.2, however the basic <b>design</b> <b>was</b> later provided by the Indian Navy's Directorate of Naval Design, followed by the detailed design by GRSE. The design includes many stealth ship features, including reductions in acoustic signature and vibration of the vessels.|$|E
5|$|Longacre's <b>design</b> <b>was</b> {{based on}} his two-cent pieces, and symbolizes the {{strength}} of a unified America. The nickel proved difficult to strike and the reverse, or tails, <b>design</b> <b>was</b> modified in 1867. Even so, production difficulties continued, causing many minor varieties which are collected today. Minting of the Shield nickel for circulation was suspended in 1876 for a period of over two years due to a glut of low-denomination coinage and it was struck in only small quantities until 1882. The following year, the coin was replaced by Charles E. Barber's Liberty head design.|$|E
5|$|Most {{noticeable}} of the N3 <b>design</b> <b>was</b> {{the concentration}} of the main battery forward of the bridge and machinery spaces. A related feature of the <b>design</b> <b>was</b> the tower bridge structure behind the first two gun turrets. This provided a better and more stable foundation for fire-control equipment, greatly improved accommodation and protection from the weather.|$|E
50|$|The {{probability}} of a 2&times;2 table under the first study <b>design</b> <b>is</b> given by the multinomial distribution; the second study <b>design</b> <b>is</b> given by the product of two independent binomial distributions; the third <b>design</b> <b>is</b> given by the hypergeometric distribution.|$|R
40|$|Abstract A {{supersaturated}} <b>design</b> <b>is</b> {{essentially a}} factorial design with the equal oc-currence of levels property and no fully aliased factors {{in which the}} number of main ef-fects {{is greater than the}} number of runs. It has received much recent interest because of its potential in factor screening experiments. A packing <b>design</b> <b>is</b> an important object in combinatorial design theory. In this paper, a strong link between the two apparently un-related kinds of <b>designs</b> <b>is</b> shown. Several criteria for comparing supersaturated <b>designs</b> <b>are</b> proposed, their properties and connections with other existing criteria are discussed. A combinatorial approach, called the packing method, for constructing optimal supersatu-rated <b>designs</b> <b>is</b> presented, and properties of the resulting <b>designs</b> <b>are</b> also investigated. Comparisons between the new designs and other existing <b>designs</b> <b>are</b> given, which show that our construction method and the newly constructed designs have good properties...|$|R
40|$|A-optimality of block {{designs for}} control versus test {{comparisons}} in diallel crosses is investigated. A sufficient condition for <b>designs</b> to <b>be</b> A-optimal is derived.

Fundamental issues such as region of interest and scaling of <b>design</b> variables <b>are</b> discussed. Then the construction of projection <b>designs</b> <b>are</b> illustrated...|$|R
40|$|A robust {{process is}} a process that is {{insensitive}} to changes in uncontrollable variables. In this article a class of <b>designs</b> that can <b>be</b> used to achieve a robust process is proposed. These new <b>designs</b> <b>are</b> similar in structure to classical central composite <b>designs,</b> but they <b>are</b> of mixed resolution. That <b>is,</b> the new <b>designs</b> <b>are</b> at least Resolution V among the signal factors and are at least Resolution I 11 among the noise factors. A catalog of the new designs, known as composite mixed-resolution (CMR) <b>designs,</b> <b>is</b> included for the practitioner. A comparison of the sizes of robustness designs shows that many CMR <b>designs</b> <b>are</b> superior to or competitive with the corresponding Taguchi designs. The response surface models associated with these two classes of robustness <b>designs</b> <b>are</b> also compared. D efficiencies and G efficiencies of the CMR <b>designs</b> <b>are</b> included...|$|R

Later versions included the Y-1560, which had 72 detonators; the Y-1561, which had 32; and the Y-1562, which had 132. There were also the Y-1563 and Y-1564, which were practice bombs with no detonators at all. The final wartime Y-1561 <b>design</b> <b>was</b> assembled with just 90 bolts.|$|E

50|$|Since the {{optimality}} {{criterion of}} most optimal <b>designs</b> <b>is</b> {{based on some}} function of the information matrix, the 'optimality' of a given <b>design</b> <b>is</b> model dependent: While an optimal <b>design</b> <b>is</b> best for that model, its performance may deteriorate on other models. On other models, an optimal <b>design</b> can <b>be</b> either better or worse than a non-optimal <b>design.</b> Therefore, it <b>is</b> important to benchmark the performance of designs under alternative models.|$|R
