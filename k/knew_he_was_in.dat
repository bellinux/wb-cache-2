5|$|Later, Judge Donnelly {{is nearly}} killed when {{she sits on}} a needle filled with {{potassium}} chloride at her home; she is saved when Stabler and Benson rush her to the hospital. O'Halloran tells Stabler and Benson that a mosquito sucked the blood from the killer {{as he or she}} was rigging Zimmer's car, and that the DNA from the blood will likely implicate Harrison. As the DNA is later being processed, however, O'Halloran is stabbed and killed by someone in the forensics lab. Stabler arrives and sees on the computer screen that the DNA matches Stuckey just before Stuckey knocks him out from behind. Stuckey then answers Elliot's phone when Benson calls to say that Stabler went out for lunch and forgot his phone. He then ties Stabler to a chair and starts torturing him. Stuckey admits he killed the woman at Coney Island in order to frame Harrison, and that he attacked Zimmer and Donnelly for embarrassing him. Benson arrives and is held at gunpoint by Stuckey, but she convinces Stuckey that she, too, hates Stabler and is in love with Stuckey. While Benson kisses Stuckey to distract him, Stabler kicks him from behind, allowing Benson to knock Stuckey out and free Stabler. When Stabler asks how Benson <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> trouble, Benson says that Stuckey told her he went out for sushi, which she knows that Stabler hates.|$|E
500|$|It {{was pretty}} bad {{back there in}} them days... The niggers was pretty bad over there in Boley, you know... Charley and them, they throwed this nigger and his mother in jail, both of them, {{the boy and the}} woman. And that night, why they stuck out and hung , they hung them niggers that killed that sheriff... I just kind of laughed [...] I knew darn well that rascal [...] was– I <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> on it.|$|E
500|$|A {{group of}} white vigilantes, {{who had become}} a mob by this time, seized Sam Carter, a local {{blacksmith}} and teamster who worked in a turpentine still. They tortured Carter into admitting that he had hidden the escaped chain gang prisoner. Carter led the group to the spot in the woods where {{he said he had}} taken Hunter, but the dogs were unable to pick up a scent. To the surprise of many witnesses, someone fatally shot Carter in the face. The group hung Carter's mutilated body from a tree as a symbol to other black men in the area. Some in the mob took souvenirs of his clothes. Survivors suggest that John Bradley fled to Rosewood because he <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> trouble and had gone to the home of Aaron Carrier, a fellow veteran and Mason. Carrier and Carter, another Mason, covered Bradley {{in the back of a}} wagon. [...] Carter took Bradley to a nearby river, let him out of the wagon, then returned home to be met by the mob; they had reached him led by dogs following Bradley's scent.|$|E

6000|$|... "He will!" [...] {{the lady}} answered. [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> heaven!" [...] Then she piteously cried, [...] "But O, my darling boy, my darling boy!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{it is not}} simple," [...] {{said the}} earl, [...] "because we do not <b>know</b> which basket <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>in.</b> We <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> one of them, but that is all we do know. You see now, I reckon, that I was right; it takes three funerals, {{there is no other}} way." ...|$|R
2500|$|Green's {{performances}} {{earned him}} a re-match with Beyer – who was still the reigning super-middleweight world champion. The second meeting with Beyer occurred at Zwickau in Germany on 12 March 2005. Green <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> trouble by the tenth round when Fenech told him [...] "You won't win this fight if you don't knock him out", and came back strongly – knocking Beyer to the canvas for a mandatory eight count in the final round. Despite the late effort, Beyer was awarded a majority points win {{on two of the}} three cards, with one judge scoring the bout as a draw. Green praised his opponent after the fight by saying [...] "Markus Beyer was the better man tonight" [...] and [...] "He came back so well since the last time we fought ... that is a sign of a champion." [...] Green's Perth-based manager Wayne Loxley said [...] "We must move forward after tonight's fight, ... We'll offer $2 million to bring Markus Beyer to Perth." ...|$|E
2500|$|Elliott, later {{speaking}} about the session, said [...] "The technique I used on this man was {{to get him to}} completely relax. I got him started counting by ones, twos, threes, etc., to a hundred and then backwards. I had established in his mind that I was his friend. He <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> very serious trouble and he knew he was innocent. When he went under, he was counting by threes backward. He was completely relaxed. The critical stage is the next state when you say the subject is cataleptic. The longer you keep them in the state of catalepsy, the deeper they sink into the third state. I kept him ten minutes in this state of catalepsy. He {{was in a state of}} extreme exhaustion. Sweat was on his face. Observing that even Bill [...] was still somewhat skeptical of hypnosis, whether or not the man was truly hypnotized or faking, I resorted to a fail safe demonstration. Through suggestion, I removed all feeling, reflex actions, etc., from the subject's right arm and stuck a burning cigarette to his arm--absolutely no reaction. Bill was thoroughly convinced." ...|$|E
60|$|McCan, however, {{steadily}} coughed worse, {{and from}} his groans and howls they <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> delirium. Once, Smoke made as if to throw the robes back, but Labiskwee clung to him tightly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{and if he}} {{lets you}} off then we'll <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> earnest," [...] chimed in Cecily. [...] "But if he still says you must go that'll <b>be</b> a sign <b>he</b> doesn't believe it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't <b>know.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> {{here once}} before, {{two or three}} weeks ago asking about the {{different}} hunting lodges and lumber camps in this vicinity. He didn't give any name, and he didn't say what his business was." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Fairly sure. Of course, {{we might}} have been mistaken. But we <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> Crumville--Laura <b>was</b> sure of that--and it would be just like him to sneak up to our place to see what he could do to annoy or injure us." ...|$|R
60|$|The well mouth {{cleared away}} its mist again, {{and he saw}} more clearly. Part {{of the time he}} <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> bed staring at the ceiling. Part of the time the well mouth {{remained}} closed in with clouds.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps I'd better answer," [...] {{she said}} sweetly. [...] "I {{was sure of}} Arthur, and that means {{a good deal more}} than that I <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> love with me--I don't suppose you heard that he'd {{proposed}} to me once before?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I really believe," [...] {{said his}} wife, with her mind {{taken off the}} point by the {{attractiveness}} of a surmise which had just occurred to her, [...] "that Mrs. Pasmer {{would be capable of}} following him down if she <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> Washington." ...|$|E
25|$|Sir Donald Bradman (hereinafter to {{be named}} Bradman or The Don), must be called the most masterful and {{prolific}} maker of runs the game has so far <b>known.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was,</b> <b>in</b> short, a great batsman. Critics have argued that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> mechanical. So is a majestically flying aeroplane.|$|R
6000|$|... "One {{more but}} him I shall not tell about, for I <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> earnest and really suffered, though I was as kind as I {{knew how to}} <b>be.</b> I'm young <b>in</b> these things yet, so I grieved for him, and treat his love with the tenderest respect." ...|$|R
6000|$|Her voice fell {{nearly to}} a whisper. [...] "Mr. Brumley," [...] she said, [...] "when I {{came back to}} him--you <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> bed here--instead of scolding me--he cried. He cried like a vexed child. He put his face into the pillow--just misery.... I'd never seen him cry--at least only once--long ago...." ...|$|R
60|$|He was adroit {{enough to}} make his call short, and withdrew, leaving a very {{pleasant}} impression in her mind. She felt distinctly less lonely, now that she <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> the city, {{and she was still}} at the window musing about him when Haney returned, bringing his father with him.|$|E
60|$|Thus by {{elimination}} he soon rid {{the matter}} of the more unlikely theories, and was reduced--though aversely--to the less assailable one that the bottle contained a message to himself. Ida <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> Coralio; she must have launched the bottle while the yacht was passing and the wind blowing fairly toward the shore.|$|E
6000|$|... "I reckon Davenport <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> {{the wrong}} {{when he made}} that dirty remark," [...] came from Nick Ogilvie. [...] "Why, in these parts many a man would have shot him down for those words. I don't wonder your father flew into him. He should have been licked until he was a fit subject for the hospital." ...|$|E
50|$|Logan awakens on Earth-616 in New York City. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> {{not sure}} how <b>he</b> has <b>been</b> relocated, but <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> the past. <b>He</b> decides to prevent his post-apocalyptic future. His first target is a minor villain Black Butcher who in his future stole Scotty Logan's {{baseball}} cap. Logan easily kills him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps not, mother; {{but it is}} best to be on {{the safe}} side. Anyhow, I shall be glad to know that she is with you. Young Jackson will be away, for I <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> one of Stuart's troops of horse, though I have never {{happened}} to run against him since the war began." ...|$|R
5000|$|Preparing {{to return}} to France Bodington {{discussed}} the situation with Maurice Buckmaster and left a note on record at SOE Headquarters dated 23 June 1943 concerning Dericourt, [...] "we <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> contact with the Germans and also how and why" [...] (suggesting that <b>he</b> may have <b>been</b> feeding the Germans with false intelligence provided by London.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{looks to}} me, sir, {{as if he}} <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> danger and kept his knife handy," [...] said the mate. [...] "However, we can't help the poor beggar now. I can't make out these things that are lashed to the wall. They seem to be idols and weapons and curios of all sorts done up in old sacking." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The vicar <b>knew.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> our confidence. He {{would tell}} you that she was an angel upon earth. That was why he telegraphed to me and I returned. What was my baggage or Africa to me when I learned that such a fate had come upon my darling? There you have the missing clue to my action, Mr. Holmes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I said Mr Tadpole {{gave us a}} {{majority}} of fifteen," [...] said Lady Firebrace. [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> error; because I had happened to see Lord Melbourne's own list, made {{up to the last}} hour; and which gave the government {{a majority}} of sixty. It was only shown to three members of the cabinet," [...] she added in a tone of triumphant mystery.|$|E
60|$|Ham's {{face grew}} pale again, {{and if the}} truth <b>were</b> <b>known</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{trembling}} <b>in</b> his shoes.|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} after his release, he retracted {{what he said}} during interrogation, including having heard Bin Laden speak. He claims to have been beaten and sexually humiliated during interrogations, and to have <b>been</b> hung <b>in</b> the strappado position. His father has said: [...] "They have said <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> Afghanistan in 1998 studying chemicals at the terrorists' base but I <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> London." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He <b>is</b> <b>in</b> prison. I <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> prison," [...] said Linda. [...] "I wish I {{were there}} too;--so I do, or dead. I'd rather be dead." [...] Then Madame Staubach, having perhaps heard the lock {{of the front}} door when it was closed, came into the kitchen. [...] "Linda," [...] she said, [...] "I am waiting for you." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{so doing}} {{he lost his}} balance and went under, horribly, suffocating in the foul earthy water, {{struggling}} madly for a few moments. At last, after what seemed an eternity, he got his footing, rose again {{into the air and}} looked around. He gasped, and <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> the world. Then he looked at the water. She had risen near him. He grasped her clothing, and drawing her nearer, turned to take his way to land again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I--er--I didn't mean--er--anything against Harrison," [...] {{answered}} Felix Merwell, hastily. [...] "I think Endicott is deceiving him, that's all. But {{it is not}} his fault. I--er--suppose, though, I'll have to let {{the matter}} drop. Just the same, I think some of my cattle slipped into that drove." [...] And there the matter rested. Mr. Merwell <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> the wrong, {{but he was too}} mean a man to acknowledge it. Truly, father and son were equally despicable.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I wish we had. I {{can hardly}} hold on.' The Squire could not repress a groan now and then, and Tupcombe <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> great pain. 'I wish I was underground--that's {{the place for}} such fools as I! I'd gladly be there {{if it were not}} for Mistress Betty. He's coming on to King's-Hintock to-morrow--he won't put it off any longer; he'll set out and reach there to-morrow night, without {{stopping}} at Falls; and he'll take her unawares, and I want to be there before him.' ...|$|E
50|$|Robinau de Villebon’s {{importance}} in history occurred {{after his return}} to New France about 1681 and his deployment to Acadia in about 1685 to assist governor François-Marie Perrot and, subsequently, governor Louis-Alexandre des Friches de Meneval. It <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> France when William Phips captured Port Royal, Acadia {{in the spring of}} 1690. Phips took prisoners including de Meneval to Boston.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dick Grenville? I did not <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> town. Go {{home and}} tell your father John Oxenham will come and keep him company. There, off with you!

50|$|Paul Angiers (fl. 1749), was an English engraver, of whom little <b>is</b> <b>known.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> London about 1749, and {{was taught}} by John Tinney. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> chiefly {{employed}} by the booksellers, and etched some neat plates. According to Heineken he died when about thirty. His best plates are Roman Ruins, after Pannini, 1749; a landscape after Moucheron, 1755: and Dead Game, after Huet, 1757.|$|R
