40|$|Abstract. As {{a result}} of years of {{developing}} the breeding programme for creating novel sweet cherry cultivars in the Fruit Growing Institute (FGI), Plovdiv, a reach <b>hybrid</b> <b>fund</b> from first and second hybrid generation is created. Of the selected and propagated hybrids at a more advanced stage of testing are 11 hybrids along with three new cultivars of the FGI Plovdiv ('Kossara', 'Rosalina' and 'Trakiiska hrushtyalka') grafted on three rootstocks were tested for sensitivity to causers of economically important fungal diseases in sweet cherry - cherry leaf spot (Blumeriella jaapii (Rehm) Arx), shothole blight (Stigmina carpophila (Lev.) Ellis) and brown rot (Monilinia fructigena (G. Wint) Honey). The degree of infestation under field conditions is reported by determining the index of attack on leaves and fruit, using the formula of McKinney. As the most sensitive elites are outlined elite El. 17 - 31 (to cherry leaf spot) and elite El. 17 - 136 (to shothole blight). The cultivars 'Kossara' and 'Trakiiska hrushtyalka' exhibit an average resistance to the three diseases, as the values for the index of infestation are lower or {{similar to those of}} standard cultivars 'Van' and 'Bing', while 'Rosalina' demonstrated sensitivity to shothole blight and brown rot.

40|$|Chapter Introduction and Objectives]: It is now {{common in}} most parts of the world for investors to invest through mutual funds that pool in money from investors and invest on their behalf. The global asset {{management}} industry has grown to 55 trillion. This chapter provides an overview of the types of schemes available to investors. We also compare mutual funds with another type of funds called exchange traded funds. This chapter has the following objectives: • Provide an overview of the types of schemes of mutual funds • Compare exchange traded funds with mutual funds • List out the advantages and disadvantages of exchange traded funds vis-a-vis mutual funds Mutual funds offer individual investor an opportunity to diversify investment and provide professional money management often with affordable minimum investment amounts. A mutual fund is a security that pools money from investors to purchase stocks, bonds, or other securities for its portfolio. As a result, investors then typically own a portion of a portfolio that includes many more stocks and bonds than they could afford to purchase individually. Investors purchase shares of the portfolio - the value of which increase or decrease based on the value of the investments it holds. The fund distributes any income it receives from stock dividends or bond interest to the shareholders, along with any capital gains from the sale of securities. A diversified portfolio with a variety of investments may reduce the impact of one poor performing investment by offsetting it with another that may perform well during the same time period. Therefore, the overall performance of the investments in a mutual fund's portfolio has the potential to provide better returns over the long term.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{highlights the}} financial models used by Community Development Finance Institutions (CDFIs) in the UK.

Although {{a few of}} the larger ones are banks, the vast majority are loan <b>funds,</b> often with <b>hybrid</b> <b>funding</b> models involving a mixture of grants and loans for on-lending. The resilience of the financial models is examined, firstly with a survey of experts on funding and risk issues, followed by financial modelling of three risk scenarios that were considered likely by the experts. The modelling suggests that for a typical CDFI lending to businesses or civil society organisations, significant increases in bad debt write-off rates would have a larger impact than cuts in revenue funding or delays in capital funding. The dissertation concludes that funding should focus on the rationales for supporting CDFIs: cost-effective job creation and addressing market failure...|$|R

40|$|We {{explore the}} {{benefits}} of intergenerational risk-sharing through both private funded pensions and via the public debt. We use a multi-period overlapping generation model with a pay-as-you-go pension pillar, a funded pension pillar and a government. Shocks are smoothed via the public debt and variations in the indexation of pension entitlements and pension contributions. The intensity of these adjustments increases when the pension funding ratio or public debt gets closer to their boundaries. The best-performing pension arrangement is a <b>hybrid</b> <b>funded</b> scheme in which both contributions and entitlement indexation are simultaneously deployed as stabilisation instruments. We find that contribution and indexation adjustment policies are substitutes {{and the same is}} the case for contribution and tax adjustment policies. By contrast, indexation and tax adjustment policies are complements. We compare different taxation regimes and conclude that a regime in which pension benefits are taxed, while contributions are paid before taxes, is preferred to a regime in which contributions are paid after taxes, but benefits are untaxed...|$|R

More important, the average fund manager engages in significant reallocation across asset classes in the two days before and (partly) reverses his trades in the two days after a large number of announcements. Further, managers that hold a greater proportion of their funds in stocks and make greater efforts to time the stock market using private information about the macroeconomic announcements earn over 400 basis points higher return per year. The opposite holds for those that hold more cash. Finally, funds that more aggressively attempt to time the market using private information tend to have higher turnover and expense ratios...|$|R

40|$|Psychometrics {{questions}} {{the use of}} dichotomous decisions. For these reasons, De Los Reyes and Wang (2012) favour a continuous funding decision system, in which the funded percentage of a requested grant sum is coupled to the ratings that a proposal receives in the ex ante peer evaluation. In contrast to the ‘winner takes all’ philosophy in a dichotomous funding decision system, a continuous system takes the low reliability of peer review ratings into account. Funding decisions are mostly based on peer review rating systems that have rather low inter-rater reliability. This article aims to use psychometrics to simulate the two funding decision systems, to compare them to the funding decision system implemented by a real funding organization, and with this, to investigate {{for the first time}} the effects of measurement errors on funding decisions. We used peer review data from the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) (N[*]=[*] 8, 496 proposals), which obviously implements a <b>hybrid</b> <b>funding</b> decision system. The approval rate at FWF is 44. 5 %; our findings show that the approval rate would be 32. 1 % using a purely dichotomous system and 58. 4 % using a continuous funding decision system. As the funded percentage of a proposal’s requested grant sum increases with increasing mean ex ante peer evaluation of a proposal (r[*]=[*] 0. 23), the FWF also shows elements of a continuous funding decision system. Relative to a continuous system, a dichotomous system reduces the approval probability of a proposal overall. This is even the case for high-quality proposals (approval probability[*] ∼ 0. 70) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{case studies}} {{of the use of}} innovative <b>hybrid</b> <b>funding</b> instruments-which have features of debt and equity issued by UK companies in the Euromarket. It considers why these instruments were developed and how they utilise the 'grey areas' in accounting and tax regulations to achieve what managers perceive to be the main benefits of each. One of the major influences on the choice of funding instruments for a number of companies involved in acquisitions in the late 1980 s was their accounting and tax treatment. the search was for cost effective finance which at the same time contributed a premium to blunt the purchased goodwill write-off. Group reserves have no legal significance but goodwill write-offs can have consequences for a group constrained by borrowing restrictions (based on its balance sheet figures). the concern with the shape of the balance sheet and the ratios calculated using these figures, combined with perceived beliefs about the tax advantages of borrowing {{led to the development of}} the Euroconvertible Preference Share issues by subsidiary companies in 1989. the tax authorities removed the attraction of this instrument to issuers. However, the innovative process continued and similar accounting and tax explanations influenced the design of another major category of hybrid-the Convertible Capital Bond. Accounting regulators have reacted to this hybrid by producing new guidelines which have removed its benefits and therefore its attraction to companies. Nonetheless, the process of innovation continues and a new instrument-the Irredeemable Convertible Bond-has been developed. Copyright Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 1995. ...|$|R
