Customers of the SD50 also had the option of either HT-C trucks (identified with a hydraulic shock {{on the side of the}} middle axle of each truck) or the earlier Flexicoil trucks, which only Conrail opted for. Some investigators implicated the HT-C truck in derailments in Amtrak's SDP40F locomotive fleet and Conrail chose to order SD40-2s and their first order of SD50s with the earlier Flexicoil C truck. The controversy surrounding the HT-C truck was eventually disproved, and Conrail's second order of SD50s as well as their SD60 variants were all HT-C equipped.|$|E

30|$|We {{conducted}} {{series of}} experiments and obtained quantitative results about the shoulder joint contact force for lever propulsion on three different <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> of the lever propulsion mechanism.

For our trials we developed a special mechatronic wheelchair simulator that allowed simulation of different <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> of the lever propulsion mechanism. Further, we examined {{the effect of the}} <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> of lever-propulsion mechanism on the shoulder joint contact force.

50|$|Gear {{trains are}} usually {{formed by the}} meshing {{engagement}} {{of two or more}} gears on a frame to form a transmission.

5000|$|If two planar rigid {{bodies are}} in contact, and each body {{has its own}} {{distinct}} centre of rotation, then the relative centre of rotation between the bodies has to lie somewhere on the line connecting the two centres. As a result, since pure rolling can only exist when the centre of rotation is {{at the point of}} contact (as seen above with the wheel on the road), it is only when the point of contact goes through the line connecting the two rotation centres that pure rolling can be achieved. This is known in involute gear design as the pitch point, where there is no relative sliding between the gears. In fact, the <b>gearing</b> <b>ratio</b> between the two rotating parts is found by the ratio of the two distances to the relative centre.

5000|$|There {{is also a}} {{transmission}} called a torque converter, or CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission).

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{ascertain}} if <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> selection would have an effect on peak power and time to peak power production in elite Bicycle Motocross (BMX) cyclists. Eight male elite BMX riders volunteered for the study. Each rider performed three, 10 -s maximal sprints on an Olympic standard indoor BMX track. The riders' bicycles were fitted with a portable SRM power meter. Each rider performed the three sprints using <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> of 41 / 16, 43 / 16 and 45 / 16 tooth.
