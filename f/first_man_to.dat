5000|$|Exegesis narrates that Idris {{was among}} [...] "the <b>first</b> <b>men</b> <b>to</b> use the pen {{as well as}} being one of the <b>first</b> <b>men</b> <b>to</b> observe the {{movement}} of the stars and set out scientific weights and measures." [...] These attributes remain consistent with the identification of Enoch with Idris, as these attributes make it clear that Idris would have most probably lived during the Generations of Adam, the same era during which Enoch lived. Ibn Arabi described Idris as the [...] "prophet of the philosophers" [...] and a number of works were attributed to him. Some scholars wrote commentaries on these supposed works, all while Idris was also credited with several inventions, including the art of making garments.|$|R
