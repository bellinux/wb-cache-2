5|$|In April, 3rd Battalion {{participated in}} a series of bloody engagements near Khe Sanh known as The Hill Fights. Activity near Khe Sanh had {{increased}} dramatically that spring and on 24 April, Bravo Company 1st Battalion 9th Marines was engaged by elements of the PAVN 18th Regiment dug in on Hills 881 North, 881 South, and 861. 3rd Battalion, then a hybrid unit with companies from multiple battalions, was sent to assist. 3rd Battalion's commander, LtCol Gary Wilder, believed he was only facing a small PAVN unit and counterattacked. Throughout the 25th, 3rd Battalion launched a series of piecemeal attacks on the hills, only to be repulsed with heavy losses. The 3rd Marine Division committed its reserve to the fighting and took Hill 861 on 26 April. On the night of 29 April, the PAVN replaced the battered 18th Regiment with the fresh 95th Regiment. The following day the Marines dropped 250 bombs and more than 1300 artillery rounds on Hill 881. Mike Company was allowed by the PAVN to advance partially up the hill before opening fire. By the end of the battle, 46 Marines from the battalion were killed, half of them <b>from</b> <b>Mike</b> Company.|$|E

Another 31 were wounded, including PFC Craig Swartz who was wounded three times and received three purple hearts for his service. PAVN losses numbered at least 139, with another 60 graves discovered by 3rd Battalion Marines three days later. That same month a platoon <b>from</b> <b>Mike</b> Company observed and damaged two PAVN PT-76 tanks near Alpha 3, one of only three times they were encountered during the Vietnam War before 1972. On 6 March, Mike Company blundered into the 27th Regiment of the PAVN 325th Division and had one-third of the company put out of action in an all-night engagement, including 14 Marines killed.|$|E

On May 10, 2015, one day after regaining the title for his second reign, Rockstar Spud invoked Option C, and was defeated by then champion Kurt Angle. On the July 5, 2016 episode of Impact Wrestling, World Heavyweight Champion Lashley offered a winner take all match to X Division Champion Eddie Edwards in lieu of Edwards invoking Option C.

5|$|The Bears {{struggled}} {{early in}} the preseason-opening game, starting with the Dolphins scoring on the opening drive with Ryan Tannehill's two-yard touchdown pass to Jarvis Landry, concluding a 14-play, 85-yard drive. On the first offensive play, tackle Jordan Mills was penalized for a false start, and after four plays, the Bears punted; Chicago would not score until {{early in the}} second quarter with Robbie Gould's 48-yard field goal. The Dolphins responded to the field goal with Caleb Sturgis' 31-yard field goal later in the quarter. With 1:02 left in the first half, backup quarterback Jimmy Clausen attempted to lead a two-minute drill, and the offense reached the Dolphins' 16-yard line, but with no timeouts and wide receiver Josh Bellamy being unable to get out of bounds, the clock ran out. Early in the second half, cornerback Sherrick McManis pulled the ball away <b>from</b> <b>Mike</b> Gillislee, and recovered at the Dolphins' 37, which led to Gould's 23-yard field goal; after Miami punted, Gould narrowed the margin by one point with a 21-yard kick. On the Dolphins' next play, McLeod Bethel-Thompson was intercepted by linebacker John Timu; seven plays later, runningback Ka'Deem Carey scored on a one-yard touchdown run to give the Bears the lead, followed by Clausen's two-point conversion pass to wide receiver A. J. Cruz. In the fourth quarter, Bethel-Thompson was intercepted by linebacker Sam Acho on the Miami 13, which led to Gould kicking a 27-yard field goal; later in the quarter, the Bears increased their lead with runningback Senorise Perry's 54-yard touchdown run, making the score 27–10. After the Dolphins turned the ball over on downs and the Bears punted, the game concluded with Miami's Josh Freeman being intercepted by defensive back Malcolm Bronson.|$|E
5|$|On the Packers' first drive, Rodgers {{failed to}} {{recognize}} the Bears' zone defense, having expected a man-to-man defense, and Shea McClellin escaped Don Barclay's block and, along with Isaiah Frey, pulled Rodgers down, who landed {{on his shoulder and}} injured his left collarbone, and was replaced by Seneca Wallace {{for the remainder of the}} game. Afterwards, Mason Crosby kicked the 30-yard field goal to give the Packers the lead. On Chicago's first drive, McCown escaped pressure <b>from</b> <b>Mike</b> Neal and threw towards Brandon Marshall for the 7–3 lead. Once the Packers got the ball back, Wallace's pass for Jordy Nelson was tipped and intercepted by Julius Peppers, and was returned 14 yards to Green Bay's 45-yard line, but after the Bears failed to convert on third down, Adam Podlesh's punt was blocked by Jamari Lattimore. Eventually, James Starks ran 32 yards for the touchdown. However, the Bears traveled 60 yards on two plays, and Forté scored on the 1-yard run. The Bears ended the first half with Robbie Gould's 24-yard field goal to expand the lead to 17–10. In the third quarter, the Packers forced the Bears to punt, and Lacy ran 56 yards to the Bears' 1, and scored on the ensuing play. On the eventual kickoff, the Packers successfully attempted a surprise onside kick, which was recovered by Lattimore. Crosby kicked a 23-yarder on the drive. On the Bears' next drive, McCown threw a six-yard pass to Alshon Jeffery, whose size kept the ball from being knocked away by Davon House. After both teams exchanged punts in the fourth quarter, on the Bears' next drive, began attempting to run out the clock. On 4th and 1 at the Bears' 32 with 7:50 remaining, Forté ran three yards for the conversion and continuing the drive, which ended with Gould's 27-yard field goal. The drive lasted 18 plays and took up 8:58, leaving only 50 seconds remaining in the game. Despite a 15-yard pass by Wallace to Nelson, sacks by Corey Wootton and McClellin ended the game with a 27–20 victory for the Bears.|$|E
