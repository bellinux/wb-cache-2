40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{assess the}} {{distribution}} of indoor nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) concentrations <b>in</b> <b>homes</b> located <b>in</b> differing environments, and to investigate the influence of factors such as automobile exhaust on the indoor environment. METHODS: The concentrations of indoor NO 2 over 24 hours were measured in both the heating and non-heating periods <b>in</b> <b>homes</b> of pupils from nine elementary schools in Chiba, Japan. Information on factors that could influence indoor environments was collected by questionnaire. RESULTS: Indoor NO 2 concentrations during the heating period were higher <b>in</b> <b>homes</b> with unvented heaters than <b>in</b> <b>homes</b> with vented heaters, although the concentrations varied greatly among homes {{primarily because of the}} type of heating device used. During the non-heating period, indoor NO 2 concentrations were significantly higher <b>in</b> <b>homes</b> adjacent to trunk roads than <b>in</b> <b>homes</b> located <b>in</b> other areas. Multiple regression analysis showed that indoor NO 2 concentrations were associated with atmospheric NO 2 <b>in</b> <b>homes</b> with vented heaters during the heating period, and <b>in</b> <b>homes</b> <b>in</b> areas other than on the roadside during the non-heating period. In areas other than the roadside, cigarette smoking in indoor environments also significantly contributed to indoor NO 2. The average concentrations of indoor NO 2 <b>in</b> the <b>homes</b> of pupils attending each school were significantly related to the atmospheric NO 2 in areas other than the roadside. However, the relation between indoor and atmospheric NO 2 concentrations was not significant in roadside areas. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that indoor NO 2 concentrations are related to the atmospheric NO 2 and type of heating appliances, and are also affected by automobile exhaust <b>in</b> <b>homes</b> located <b>in</b> roadside areas...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: About half of {{the world}} 2 ̆ 7 s {{population}} is exposed to smoke from burning biomass fuels at home. The high airborne particulate levels <b>in</b> these <b>homes</b> and the health burden of exposure to this smoke are well described. Burning unprocessed biological material such as wood and dried animal dung may also produce high indoor endotoxin concentrations. OBJECTIVE: In this study we measured airborne endotoxin levels <b>in</b> <b>homes</b> burning different biomass fuels. METHODS: Air sampling was carried out <b>in</b> <b>homes</b> burning wood or dried animal dung in Nepal (n = 31) and wood, charcoal, or crop residues in Malawi (n = 38). Filters were analyzed for endotoxin content expressed as airborne endotoxin concentration and endotoxin per mass of airborne particulate. RESULTS: Airborne endotoxin concentrations were high. Averaged over 24 hr <b>in</b> Malawian <b>homes,</b> median concentrations of total inhalable endotoxin were 24 endotoxin units (EU) /m(3) <b>in</b> charcoal-burning <b>homes</b> and 40 EU/m(3) <b>in</b> wood-burning <b>homes.</b> Short cooking-time samples collected in Nepal produced median values of 43 EU/m(3) <b>in</b> wood-burning <b>homes</b> and 365 EU/m(3) <b>in</b> dung-burning <b>homes,</b> suggesting increasing endotoxin levels with decreasing energy levels in unprocessed solid fuels. CONCLUSIONS: Airborne endotoxin concentrations <b>in</b> <b>homes</b> burning biomass fuels are orders of magnitude higher than those found <b>in</b> <b>homes</b> <b>in</b> developed countries where endotoxin exposure has been linked to respiratory illness in children. There is a need for work to identify the determinants of these high concentrations, interventions to reduce exposure, and health studies {{to examine the effects of}} these sustained, near-occupational levels of exposure experienced from early life...|$|R
