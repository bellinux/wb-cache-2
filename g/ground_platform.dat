It was a stablemate of the Škoda 21cm Kanone 39 and used {{virtually the same}} mounting and transport arrangements. It used an interrupted screw breech with a deBange obturator to provide the gas seal with bagged propellant. The carriage revolved on a ball-race firing platform {{that had to be}} dug-in before firing, a task that took six to eight hours to accomplish. It broke down into three loads for transport, the barrel, carriage and the <b>ground</b> <b>platform.</b> A modified version entered service in 1942 as the H 39/40 although the changes merely simplified production. A total of eighteen were delivered to Germany.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Unmanned ground {{platforms}} {{are increasingly}} used to perform tasks under {{direct threat to}} the operator’s life and health. Separating an operator from a controlled machine places high demands to its steering system. The requirement of reliability put to such platforms in terms of potential threats makes their steering systems being very precise controlled and tested at the stage of construction. The key element in the steering process of unmanned ground platforms are surroundings display systems which determine the success of conducting rescue operations.

40|$|Despite {{fluorescent}} {{photodynamic therapy}} (fluorescent-PDT) dyes are promising theranostic agents, current approaches unfortunately involve crucial shortcomings (such as, narrow absorption bands, high cost, low bio-compatibility and specificity, low dual efficiency) making difficult their clinical translation. Particularly, efficient fluorescent-PDT agents triggered under white-light, with potential application in topic solar treatments, are scarce. Here, {{we describe the}} rational development of a novel fluorescent-PDT molecular biomaterial based on BODIPY building blocks able to sustain, simultaneously, synthetic accessibility, high fluorescence and phototoxicity within a broad spectral window, biocompatibility, including low dark toxicity and high cell permeability with selective accumulation in lysosomes and, what is more important, excellent efficient activity triggered under white light. These all-in-one combined properties make the new dye a valuable <b>ground</b> <b>platform</b> {{for the development of}} future smarter theranostic agents...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the status and}} progress of the ongoing work directed towards {{the development and implementation}} of autonomous navigation algorithms for Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAV).

This paper contains a description of the methodology along with initial results from both simulations and experiments that demonstrate the ability to navigate around corners from start to goal positions as well as mapping realistic corridor environments using a <b>ground</b> <b>platform.</b> A notable advantage of the current methodology is the separation between the MAV’s model and the navigation algorithm, which makes them suitable for various rotary wing (and other) platforms...|$|E
