The survey responses show that more than 50 % of the firms employ financial hedges and that transaction <b>exposure</b> is more frequently hedged than translation <b>exposure.</b> We find that the likelihood of using financial hedges is increasing with firm size and <b>exposure</b> and that liquidity constraints are important in explaining transaction <b>exposure</b> hedging.

5|$|Beryllium is {{a health}} and safety issue for workers. Exposure to {{beryllium}} in the workplace {{can lead to a}} sensitization immune response and can over time develop chronic beryllium disease (CBD). The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States researches these effects in collaboration with a major manufacturer of beryllium products.

NIOSH also conducts genetic research on sensitization and CBD, independently of this collaboration.

40|$|BACKGROUND. <b>Exposure</b> to {{environmental}} tobacco smoke (ETS) {{has been identified as}} a risk factor for chronic disease among nonsmokers. Results of epidemiological surveys suggest that the majority of nonsmokers have regular ETS <b>exposure.</b> However, {{little is known about the}} topography of <b>exposure.</b> METHODS. An <b>exposure</b> diary was used by 186 nonsmokers to self-monitor ETS <b>exposure</b> over a 7 -day period. Subjects also completed a questionnaire that assessed their patterns of ETS <b>exposure.</b> RESULTS. The primary source of ETS <b>exposure</b> was the workplace, except when there was a smoker in the household, in which case the household was the primary source. The presence of a smoker in the household resulted in higher levels of <b>exposure</b> both at work and in other locations when compared with subjects without household <b>exposure.</b> Subjects' assessments of <b>exposure</b> on the questionnaire were consistently lower than their self-monitored levels. This finding suggests that general <b>exposure</b> ratings underestimate <b>exposure.</b> CONCLUSIONS. This study provides a new understanding of the patterns of ETS <b>exposure</b> and may help guide the development of policies and interventions designed to reduce ETS <b>exposure...</b>|$|R
40|$|Cosmogenic <b>exposure</b> dating {{has greatly}} {{enhanced}} {{our ability to}} define glacial chronologies spanning several global cold periods, and glacial boulder <b>exposure</b> ages are now routinely used to constrain deglaciation ages. However, <b>exposure</b> dating involves assumptions about the geological history of the sample {{that are difficult to}} test and yet may {{have a profound effect on}} the inferred age. Two principal geological factors yield erroneous inferred ages: <b>exposure</b> prior to glaciation (yielding <b>exposure</b> ages that are too old) and incomplete <b>exposure</b> due to post-depositional shielding (yielding <b>exposure</b> ages that are too young). Here we show that incomplete <b>exposure</b> is more important than prior <b>exposure,</b> using datasets of glacial boulder 10 Be <b>exposure</b> ages from theTibetan Plateau (1420 boulders), Northern Hemisphere palaeo-ice sheets (631 boulders), and present-day glaciers (208 boulders). No boulders from present-day glaciers and few boulders from the palaeo-ice sheets have <b>exposure</b> ages significantly older than independently known deglaciation ages, indicating that prior <b>exposure</b> is of limited significance. Further, while a simple post-depositional landform degradation model can predict the <b>exposure</b> age distribution of boulders from the Tibetan Plateau, a prior <b>exposure</b> model fails, indicating that incomplete <b>exposure</b> is important. The large global dataset demonstrates that, in the absence of other evidence, glacial boulder <b>exposure</b> ages should be viewed as minimum limiting deglaciation ages...|$|R

Scientists involved in the HDF observations pioneered a technique called 'drizzling', in which the pointing of the telescope was varied minutely between sets of <b>exposures.</b> Each pixel on the WFPC2 CCD chips recorded an area of sky 0.09 arcseconds across, but by changing the direction in which the telescope was pointing by less than that between <b>exposures,</b> the resulting images were combined using sophisticated image-processing techniques to yield a final angular resolution better than this value. The HDF images produced at each wavelength had final pixel sizes of 0.03985 arcseconds.|$|E
