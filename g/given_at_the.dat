For {{almost two years}} {{he was unable to}} work, and it was only later in the 1930s that he returned to the concert scene. In 1936, he conducted his first opera at Covent Garden, Gustave Charpentier's Louise.

In 1988, baseball historian and statistician Bill James chose Pierce as having had the tenth greatest career value among left-handers, ahead of six Hall of Famers.|$|E
5|$|With Grisélidis and Cendrillon complete, {{though still}} {{awaiting}} performance, Massenet {{began work on}} Sapho, based on a novel by Daudet about the love of an innocent young man from {{the country for a}} worldly-wise Parisienne.

His next work staged there was Cendrillon, his version of the Cinderella story, which was well received in May 1899.|$|E
5|$|At {{the close}} of the 1991 season, a {{proposal}} was tabled {{for the establishment of a}} new league that would bring more money into the game overall. The Founder Members Agreement, signed on 17 July 1991 by the game's top-flight clubs, established the basic principles for setting up the FA Premier League. The newly formed top division would have commercial independence from The Football Association and the Football League, giving the FA Premier League licence to negotiate its own broadcast and sponsorship agreements. The argument <b>given</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time was that the extra income would allow English clubs to compete with teams across Europe. Although Dyke played a significant role in the creation of the Premier League, Dyke and ITV would lose out in the bidding for broadcast rights as BSkyB won with a bid of £304million over five years with the BBC awarded the highlights package broadcast on Match of the Day.|$|E

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Civil War, Breckinridge quickly became an ardent supporter of the Union, not for its position against slavery, but for the sake of preserving the Union. He used his position as editor of the Danville Quarterly Review to advocate his position. He called for harsh measures against secession, and in time, accepted President Lincoln's immediate emancipation of slaves. He was chosen as the temporary chair of the 1864 Republican National Convention that re-nominated Lincoln for president, and his pro-Union speech was hailed by freshman Representative James G. Blaine {{as one of the most}} inspiring <b>given</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> event.|$|E
5|$|By 1860, Smith {{was doing}} very well; {{he had moved}} to Leonard Street within the Fifth Ward and had a mansion built by white workmen. His total real {{property}} was worth $25,000. His household included a live-in servant, Catherine Grelis from Ireland. Listed as a separate household at his address were Sara D. Williams, 57, and Mary Hertell (should be Hewlitt, as above), 50. (These were likely the same Sara and Mary as in the 1850 census, although their ages did not change.) No one on this census page had a racial designation. By the conventions of the time, this means that they were classified as white by the census enumerator; totals of white persons only are <b>given</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bottom of the page.|$|E

With four laps remaining, Michael McDowell's engine failed, {{prompting}} the second caution to be <b>given.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> restart, Matt Kenseth was the leader, but he was passed by Busch one lap later. Busch remained in the first position to win the first Gatorade Duel. There were two cautions and 20 lead changes among nine drivers during the first race.|$|E
