40|$|Information {{holographic}} storage {{is a very}} promising technique due to its high theoretical capacity. One of the key factors in developing <b>holographic</b> <b>memories</b> {{is the need for}} a suitable recording material which must have certain specific characteristics. In particular, in order to achieve a high storage density it is necessary to work with great thicknesses. One of the essential requirements for <b>holographic</b> <b>memories</b> to be competitive is that the material must have a thickness of 500 μm or more, but {{it is not easy to}} find such thicknesses with the photopolymers currently available. In this study, we develop a method of preparing layers of a polyvinyl alcohol/acrylamide based photopolymer approximately 1 mm thick. Optimization of this material makes it possible to obtain good results for the main holographic parameters; diffraction efficiency 70 % and energetic sensitivity 50 mJ/cm 2.

50|$|His {{ideas are}} said to be rooted in the post-quantic Physics promulgated by {{physicist}} David Bohm, with the theory of holokinesis, which states that reality is undivided. It is also based in Karl Pribram’s theory of <b>holographic</b> <b>memory,</b> which states that memory is distributed throughout the brain and not in specific zones or engrams, and in Bell’s mathematical theorem.|$|E
5000|$|A {{holographic}} {{model can}} also account for other features of memory that more traditional models cannot. The Hopfield memory model has an early memory saturation point before which memory retrieval drastically slows and becomes unreliable. On the other hand, <b>holographic</b> <b>memory</b> models have much larger theoretical storage capacities. Holographic models can also demonstrate associative memory, store complex connections between different concepts, and resemble forgetting through [...] "lossy storage." ...|$|E

40|$|The maximum {{capacity}} of a block-oriented, random-access memory is determined primarily by the geometrical parameters of the lenses required to create a Fourier transform of a spatial bit pattern and to image the reconstructed bits onto a photodetector array.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{interesting}} applications of photopolymers is as holographic recording materials for <b>holographic</b> <b>memories.</b> One of the basic requirements for this application is that the recording material thickness must be 500 µm or thicker. In recent years many 2 -dimensional models have been proposed for the analysis of photopolymers. Good agreement between theoretical simulations and experimental results has been obtained for layers thinner than 200 µm. The attenuation of the light inside the material by Beer’s law results in an attenuation of the index profile inside the material and in some cases the effective optical thickness of the material is lower than the physical thickness. This is an important and fundamental limitation in achieving high capacity <b>holographic</b> <b>memories</b> using photopolymers and cannot be analyzed using 2 -D diffusion models. In this paper a model is proposed to describe the behavior of the photopolymers in 3 -D. This model is applied to simulate the formation of profiles in depth for different photopolymer viscosities and different intensity attenuations inside the material...|$|R
50|$|While Pribram {{originally}} developed the holonomic brain theory as an analogy for certain brain processes, several papers (including some more recent ones by Pribram himself) {{have proposed that}} the similarity between hologram and certain brain functions {{is more than just}} metaphorical, but actually structural. Others still maintain that the relationship is only analogical. Several {{studies have shown that the}} same series of operations used in <b>holographic</b> <b>memory</b> models are performed in certain processes concerning temporal memory and optomotor responses. This indicates at least the possibility of the existence of neurological structures with certain holonomic properties. Other studies have demonstrated the possibility that biophoton emission (biological electrical signals that are converted to weak electromagnetic waves in the visible range) may be a necessary condition for the electric activity in the brain to store holographic images. These may play a role in cell communication and certain brain processes including sleep, but further studies are needed to strengthen current ones. Other studies have shown the correlation between more advanced cognitive function and homeothermy. Taking holographic brain models into account, this temperature regulation would reduce distortion of the signal waves, an important condition for holographic systems.|$|E
50|$|Barrie Gilbert (born in 1937 in Bournemouth, England) is an English-American inventor. He is {{well known}} for his {{invention}} of numerous analog circuit concepts, holding over 100 patents worldwide, and for the discovery of the Translinear Principle. His name is attributed to a class of related topologies loosely referred to as the Gilbert cell, one of which is a mixer - a key frequency translation device - used in every modern wireless communication device. A similar topology, for use as a synchronous demodulator, was invented by Howard Jones in 1963. During the 1950s he pursued an interest in solid-state devices while at Mullard, working on the development of early transistors, and later, the first-generation planar ICs. After some pioneering development of sampling oscillography he emigrated to the United States in 1964 to pursue this interest at Tektronix, Beaverton, Oregon, where he developed the first electronic knob-readout system and other advances in instrumentation. He returned to England in 1970, where he was Group Leader at Plessey Research Laboratories, managing a team developing a <b>holographic</b> <b>memory,</b> OCR systems and integrated circuits (ICs) for communications applications. From 1972-1977 he consulted for Analog Devices Inc., Beaverton, OR, designing several ICs embodying novel nonlinear concepts. He returned to the USA and Tektronix in 1977 to pursue HF ICs and process development.|$|E
5000|$|Hagen Arnold (Christopher George) is an American spy in {{the year}} 2118. The geopolitical climate of Earth has changed {{significantly}} over the years with Sino-Asia (China) being the only other superpower and enemy of the United States. Overpopulation is a looming issue. On a covert mission to Sino-Asia, Arnold {{sends a message to}} his handlers in the U. S. stating that [...] "The West will be destroyed in fourteen days". He then takes an anti-torture drug that renders him an amnesiac. Hagen is safely brought back to the USA and placed in cryogenic preservation until the government can devise a way to get the information out of him. With the key to discovering the secret weapon the Sino-Asians were working on locked inside his mind the American scientists resort to using a <b>holographic</b> <b>memory</b> reading device that can see inside his mind while he is asleep. The scientists also create an elaborate historical reenactment of the 1960s (Arnold has a history degree centered on this tumultuous decade) as a means to create a role-playing mechanism that may coax the information {{to the surface of the}} unsuspecting Arnold. To keep his suspicions down in the 1960s mock-up, they also create a 1960s personality matrix to implant in his mind. He is led to believe he is a criminal hiding out at a farmhouse and cannot leave lest he be arrested.|$|E
40|$|Large {{thickness}} {{is required}} in holographic recording materials {{to be used as}} <b>holographic</b> <b>memories.</b> Photopolymers have proved to be a good alternative to construct <b>holographic</b> <b>memories.</b> Nevertheless, modeling the behavior of thick layers poses some problems due to high absorption of the dye, as discussed in previous papers. In this study, the gratings stored in photopolymers based on polyvinylalcohol/acrylamide (PVA/AA) are analyzed considering the attenuation of light in depth. This is done by fitting the theoretical results, predicted by a model that considers this effect, to the experimental results obtained using diffraction gratings recorded in PVA/AA based photopolymer. In order to determine the diffraction efficiency at the first Bragg angle, an algorithm based on the rigorous coupled wave theory is used. Also, the characteristics of the gratings obtained using different recording intensities are analyzed, and the effective optical thickness is seen to increase as the intensity is increased.

40|$|In {{recent years}} the {{development}} of new <b>holographic</b> <b>memories</b> based in photopolymers have a great goal. A new commercial <b>holographic</b> <b>memories</b> has been optimized by Aprilis and Inphase. The advantages of this type of materials to store information are well know: their high capacity and their fast random access. In the behaviour of this type of material two important factors determinate the quality of the material, the capacity and the energetic sensitivity. The base of the high capacity of the <b>holographic</b> <b>memories</b> is the high Bragg’s angular selectivity. The narrow curve of the angular scan are obtained when the effective optical thickness of material is high and permits record many holograms turning the plate only 3 °. Others important factors are the dye and monomer concentration, high values of the concentrations origins high values of the index modulation (higher stored capacity, better energetic sensitivity and large dynamic range) but in when the dye and monomer concentrations are high all the light is absorbed in the first 200 μm of the material and the effective optical thickness of the grating recorded decrease (decrease the stored capacity) and the values of the noise are high in this case. In this work this attenuation of the index modulation in depth is having into account using rigorous couple wave theory to obtain the limit of the effective optical thickness for each composition of photopolymer. The optimal composition to obtain high stored capacity, high index modulation, good energetic sensitivity, high dynamic range and low noise are found.

40|$|Optically Reconfigurable Gate Arrays (ORGAs) {{offer the}} {{possibility}} of providing a virtual gate count that is much larger than those of currently available VLSIs by exploiting the large storage capacity of a <b>holographic</b> <b>memory.</b> The first ORGA was developed to achieve rapid reconfiguration {{and a number of}} reconfiguration contexts; it consisted of a gate array VLSI, a <b>holographic</b> <b>memory,</b> and a laser diode array. The ORGA achieved a 16 µs to 20 µsreconfigura tion period that was faster than that of FPGAs, with 100 reconfiguration contexts. However, the ORGA requires the gate array to halt during reconfiguration. Therefore, the ORGA can not be reconfigured frequently because of the associated reconfiguration overhead. On the other hand, new ORGA-VLSIs that have less than 10 ns reconfiguration capability without any related overhead have already been fabricated. However, to date, a multi-holographic reconfiguration system that is suitable for such rapidly reconfigurable ORGA-VLSIs without any overhead has never been developed. For such realization, this paper proposes a four-context ORGA architecture and a multi-context <b>holographic</b> <b>memory</b> recording system used for it. In addition, experimentally demonstrated results of recording a <b>holographic</b> <b>memory</b> and reconfiguring an ORGA-VLSI are described. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Optically {{reconfigurable}} gate arrays, which consist simply of a <b>holographic</b> <b>memory,</b> a {{laser diode}} ar-ray, and a gate array VLSI, have a perfect parallel programmable capability. Even if a gate array VLSI includes defective areas, the perfect parallel programmable capability allows perfectly avoidance of those defective areas; instead, the remaining area on the gate array is used. Therefore, the architecture enables fabrication of large die VLSI chips and even wafer scale integrations using the latest processes with a high fraction of defects. Moreover, <b>holographic</b> <b>memory</b> is well-known to have high defect-tolerance because each bit of a reconfiguration context {{can be stored in}} the entire <b>holographic</b> <b>memory</b> and the damage of some component rarely affects its diffraction pattern or reconfiguration context. Therefore, the architecture has a high manufacturing-defect tolerance. In this paper, the high manufacturing-defect tolerance of optically programmable architectures is clarified using a single context prototype optically programmable architecture, which combines a liquid crystal spatial light modulator as a <b>holographic</b> <b>memory,</b> a He-Ne laser, and a perfectly parallel optically programmable gate-array VLSI.
