25|$|Years {{after the}} conference, people {{ascribed}} {{a large amount}} of significance to it. According to Paul Berg and Maxine Singer in 1995, the conference marked the beginning of an exceptional era for both science and the public discussion of science policy. The guidelines devised by the conference enabled scientists to conduct experiments with recombinant DNA technology, which by 1995 dominated biological research. This research, in turn, increased knowledge about fundamental life processes, such as the cell cycle. Additionally, the conference along with public debates on recombinant DNA, increased public interest in biomedical research and molecular genetics. For this reason, by 1995, genetics and its vocabulary had {{become a part of the}} daily press and television news. This, in turn, stimulated knowledgeable public discussion about some of the social, political and environmental issues that emerged from <b>genetic</b> <b>medicine</b> and the use of genetically modified plants in agriculture. Another significant outcome of the conference was the precedent it set about how to respond to changes in scientific knowledge. According to the conference, the proper response to new scientific knowledge was to develop guidelines that governed how to regulate it.|$|E

For example, patents have been obtained but the patents are being ignored by provincial health systems in Canada.

Only a single mutation has been patented in Myriad's lone European-wide patent, although some patents remain under review of an opposition proceeding.

40|$|During {{the decade}} since {{the launch of}} Arthritis Research, the {{application}} of gene therapy to the rheumatic diseases has experienced the same vicissitudes as the field of gene therapy as a whole. There have been conceptual and technological advances {{and an increase in}} the number of clinical trials. However, funding has been unreliable and a small number of high-profile deaths in human trials, including one in an arthritis gene therapy trial, have provided ammunition to skeptics. Nevertheless, steady progress has been made in a number of applications, including rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, Sjögren syndrome, and lupus. Clinical trials in rheumatoid arthritis have progressed to phase II and have provided the first glimpses of possible efficacy. Two phase I protocols for osteoarthritis are under way. Proof of principle has been demonstrated in animal models of Sjögren syndrome and lupus.

40|$|Clinical {{trials are}} {{underway}} {{to demonstrate that}} antisense oligomers (AOs) can redirect dystrophin gene transcript splicing to excise selected exons, and thereby remove protein truncating mutations that would otherwise lead to Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Due to the widespread and complex nature of dystrophin gene expression, DMD is a great challenge to any therapy. However, characterization of the gene structure in Becker MD patients presenting with mild phenotypes, indicate that substantial portions of the dystrophin gene can be lost with relatively minor consequences, and some in-frame deletions may only be identified late in life. It as been confirmed that {{over half of the}} 79 exons are redundant, when lost in particular combinations. While 10 - 12 AOs should restore the reading- frame in the more common genomic deletion hotspots, scores of AOs will be needed to by-pass the many different protein-truncating mutations spread across the gene. The immediate challenges are (i) to establish effective dosage regimens, (ii) gain acceptance for these personalized <b>genetic</b> <b>medicines</b> as class-specific compounds, (iii) extend the treatment to all potentially amenable mutations in the dystrophin gene and (iv) apply this platform to other acquired and genetic conditions...|$|R
