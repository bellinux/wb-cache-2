2500|$|Stratigraphy {{shows that}} the lake bed has totally dried up at least 100 times since its {{formation}} (18,000–14,000 BC). During recent history the lake's complete disappearance has been documented in considerable detail on several occasions, e.g. in 1740–1742, 1811–1813, and most recently in 1866, when the private diary of a local, Gottlieb Wenzel, noted that he crossed {{the bed of the}} lake on 4 June without soiling his boots. Parts of the lake bed were claimed for agriculture; wheat and turnips were being planted. However, in 1871 the lake began to return and by the spring of 1876 it had already reassumed its usual size. The last (brief and partial) vanishing took place during the summer of 1949 when {{the northern part of the}} lake bed (to the approximate latitude of Podersdorf) fell dry for a few weeks. Each time the drying-up of the lake bed caused major environmental disruptions because the <b>humidifying</b> and temperature buffering effect of the large water body was absent, and because the winds blew large amounts of salty dust into the surrounding villages. On earlier occasions the lake was sometimes referred to as a [...] "swamp", suggesting a very low water level with an expansion of reeds throughout the lake bed. Two records dated to 1318 and 1324, respectively mention a [...] "river", implying that at this time the lake might have been reduced to a central body of water running from north to south.|$|E

Pattern recognition and multivariate analysis of the electronic nose data has enabled to easily separate the garlic cultivars, to clearly discriminate the lyophilized or oven-dried specimen and the non <b>humidified</b> samples from the <b>humidified</b> powders maintaining, in every case, the cultivars identification. The humidification of lyophilized powders has shown a sharp separation of cultivars, otherwise, in the <b>humidified</b> oven-dried powders, their identification resulted less precise.

40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at www. springerlink. comBackground: It has previously been shown that the insufflation of <b>humidified</b> gas during laparoscopy results in less postoperative pain than is observed following the use of dry gas. Experimental evidence also suggests that dry gas insufflation during thoracoscopy results in greater structural injury to the pleura than occurs {{with the use of}} <b>humidified</b> gas. The present study was designed to determine the effect of <b>humidified</b> gas insufflation on postoperative pain following thoracoscopic procedures. Methods: Forty consecutive patients were prospectively randomized. Twenty patients were insufflated with <b>humidified</b> carbon dioxide (CO 2), and 20 control patients received standard dry CO 2. Results: The patients' analogue pain score was significantly lower following <b>humidified</b> gas insufflation compared to dry gas insufflation when assessed at 6 h postoperatively, {{as well as on the}} 1 st, 2 nd, 3 rd, and 14 th postoperative days. The postoperative morphine consumption was lower in the <b>humidified</b> group than it was in the control group. The incidence of respiratory complications was identical for both groups. Conclusion: The use of <b>humidified</b> gas appears to reduce postoperative pain but not the rate of respiratory complications. W. G. Mouton, M. Naef, J. R. Bessell, K. T. Otten, H. E. Wagner and G.

40|$|We {{conducted}} a randomized controlled trial during laparoscopic cholecystectomy {{to determine the}} extent of heat preservation and postoperative pain reduction using <b>humidified</b> carbon dioxide (CO 2) gas insufflation instead of standard dry insufflation gas. Forty consecutive patients were randomized. Twenty patients received <b>humidified</b> CO 2, and 20 control patients received standard CO 2 insufflation. A sample of 16 patients from each group was evaluated for postoperative pain levels. No adverse effects from the humidification of insufflated gas were observed. There was no significant difference in core body temperature between the two groups for this brief operation. Pain, as assessed by the Analogue Pain Score (APS) was significantly less for the group with <b>humidified</b> gas insufflation than for the control group at 6 h postoperatively as well as on the 1 st, 2 nd, and 3 rd postoperative day and at follow-up 10 days after the operation. In the <b>humidified</b> group, the mean time to return to normal activities was significantly less- 5. 9 days, as compared to 10. 9 days in the control group.

The croup score of children managed in an emergency setting with mild to moderate croup probably does not improve greatly with inhalation of <b>humidified</b> air.
