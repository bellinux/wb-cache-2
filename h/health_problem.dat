40|$|Background With an ageing {{society and}} {{increasing}} retirement ages, {{it is important}} to understand how employability can be promoted in older workers with <b>health</b> <b>problems.</b> The current study aimed to determine whether (1) different chronic <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> predict transitions from paid employment to disability benefits, unemployment and early retirement, and (2) how work-related factors modify these associations. Methods Self-report questionnaire data was used from the Dutch longitudinal Study on Transitions in Employment, Ability and Motivation with 3  years of follow-up (2010 – 2013), among employees aged 45 – 64  years (N= 8149). The influence of baseline chronic <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> and work-related factors on transitions from paid employment to disability benefits, unemployment and early retirement during follow-up was estimated in a competing risks proportional hazards model. Relative excess risk of transitions due to the interaction between chronic <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> and work-related factors was assessed. Results Severe headache, diabetes mellitus and musculoskeletal, respiratory, digestive and psychological <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> predicted an increased risk of disability benefits (HR range 1. 78 – 2. 79). Circulatory (HR= 1. 35) and psychological <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> (HR= 2. 58) predicted unemployment, and musculoskeletal (HR= 1. 23) and psychological <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> (HR= 1. 57) predicted early retirement. Work-related factors did not modify the influence of <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> on unemployment or early retirement. Psychosocial work-related factors, especially autonomy, modified the influence of <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> on disability benefits. Specifically, among workers with <b>health</b> <b>problems,</b> higher autonomy, higher support and lower psychological job demands reduced the risk of disability benefits by 82 %, 49 %, and 11 %, respectively. Conclusions All <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> affected disability benefits to a similar extent, but psychological <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> especially predicted unemployment and early retirement.

40|$|Objectives This study {{aimed to}} assess the {{influence}} of chronic <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> on work ability and productivity at work among older employees using different methodological approaches {{in the analysis of}} longitudinal studies. Methods Data from employees, aged 45 - 64, of the longitudinal Study on Transitions in Employment, Ability and Motivation was used (N= 8411). Using three annual online questionnaires, we assessed the presence of seven chronic <b>health</b> <b>problems,</b> work ability (scale 0 - 10), and productivity at work (scale 0 - 10). Three linear regression generalized estimating equations were used. The time-lag model analyzed the relation of <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> with work ability and productivity at work after one year; the autoregressive model adjusted for work ability and productivity in the preceding year; and the third model assessed the relation of incidence and recovery with changes in work ability and productivity at work within the same year. Results Workers with <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> had lower work ability at one-year follow-up than workers without these <b>health</b> <b>problems,</b> varying from a 2. 0 % reduction with diabetes mellitus to a 9. 5 % reduction with psychological <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> relative to the overall mean (time-lag). Work ability of persons with <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> decreased slightly more during one-year follow-up than that of persons without these <b>health</b> <b>problems,</b> ranging from 1. 4 % with circulatory to 5. 9 % with psychological <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> (autoregressive). Incidence related to larger decreases in work ability, from 0. 6 % with diabetes mellitus to 19. 0 % with psychological <b>health</b> <b>problems,</b> than recovery related to changes in work ability, from a 1. 8 % decrease with circulatory to an 8. 5 % increase with psychological <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> (incidence-recovery). Only workers with musculoskeletal and psychological <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> had lower productivity at work at one-year follow-up than workers without those <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> (1. 2 % and 5. 6 %, respectively, time-lag). Conclusions All methodological approaches indicated that chronic <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> were associated with decreased work ability and, to a much lesser extent, lower productivity at work. The choice for a particular methodological approach considerably influenced the strength of the associations, with the incidence of <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> resulting in the largest decreases in work ability and productivity at work...|$|R

Methods : Face to face interviews were conducted by trained interviewers to ascertain experiences of harassment. Interviews were carried out with 112 individuals with mental <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> and with 104 individuals from the general population. Results: Sixty-one per cent of people with mental <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> reported experiencing harassment, nearly ten times more frequently {{than those in the}} general population (7 %). Among the people with mental <b>health</b> <b>problems,</b> being female, having higher levels of education, or being unemployed were significantly associated with experiencing harassment.

40|$|Introduction 	Current {{research}} {{findings in the}} field of intellectual disabilities (ID) regarding the relationship between mental <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> and challenging behavior are inconclusive and/or contradictory. The aim {{of this study was to}} further investigate the putative association between these two, highly prevalent phenomena, in people with ID and specifically to explore the hypothesis that challenging behaviors may be behavioral equivalents of mental <b>health</b> <b>problems.</b> Methods 	A sample of 160 adults accessing secondary care ID health services were assessed using five validated measures. These included ratings of severity of disability, mental <b>health</b> <b>problems,</b> Autism behaviors, physical <b>health</b> <b>problems,</b> and four different aspects of challenging behavior. In conjunction with demographic information, four multiple regression analyses were undertaken to examine the interaction between mental <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> (moderated by severity of disability) and ratings of overall challenging behavior, aggression, self-injurious behavior, and stereotypy. In each case; age, gender, Autism, and physical <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> were included as covariates. Results 	There was a statistically significant association between mental <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> and ratings of overall challenging behavior, as well as the moderating effect of severity of disability. Importantly, the positive association between mental <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> and challenging behavior was only significant at more severe levels of disability. Conclusions 	These findings support the 'behavioral equivalents' hypothesis for mental <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> and challenging behaviors. However, further longitudinal research is required before this hypothesis can be considered unequivocally supported...|$|R

40|$|A high {{prevalence}} of mental <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> (i. e. depression and/or anxiety) {{has been found}} in medical students in comparison with the general population. Therefore, the objective was first to study the prevalence and 1 -year incidence of symptoms of depression, anxiety and any mental <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> among Dutch medical students and, second, to study which study-related and personal factors present a risk of these mental <b>health</b> <b>problems.</b> A 1 -year prospective longitudinal study was performed among medical students of two medical faculties in the Netherlands (n= 951). <b>Health</b> <b>problems</b> and study-related and personal factors were measured with an online questionnaire. Mental <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> were assessed by depression and/or anxiety symptoms (BSI-DEP and BSI-ANG). Univariate and multivariate hierarchical logistic regression analyses were performed to examine which of the study-related and personal factors predict mental <b>health</b> <b>problems.</b> At follow-up, 36 %, 28 % and 48 % of the medical students reported symptoms of depression, anxiety and mental <b>health</b> <b>problems,</b> respectively.

40|$|Background. People {{with severe}} or {{profound}} intellectual and motor disabilities (SPIMD) experience multimorbidity and have complex health needs. Multimorbidity increases mortality, decreases functioning, and negatively influences quality of life. Information regarding patterns of multimorbidity {{in people with}} SPIMD may lead to proactive prevention, specifically detection and treatment of physical <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> {{at an early stage}} and prevention of secondary complications. Aim: The aim {{of this study was to}} explore patterns of multimorbidity in individuals with SPIMD. Methods and procedures: Data from medical records and care plans on reported physical <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> of 99 adults with SPIMD were analysed. To explore the co-occurrence of physical <b>health</b> <b>problems,</b> cross tabulations and a 5 -set Venn Diagram were used. Outcomes and results: The most common combination of two physical <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> comprise the most prevalent physical <b>health</b> <b>problems,</b> which included visual impairment, constipation, epilepsy, spasticity, and scoliosis. These five issues occurred as a multimorbidity combination in 37 % of the participants. In 56 % of the participants a multimorbidity combination of four <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> emerged, namely constipation, visual impairment, epilepsy, and spasticity. Conclusions and implications: People experiencing SPIMD have interrelated <b>health</b> <b>problems.</b> As a consequence, a broad variety of potential interactions between physical <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> and their treatments may occur. Identifying multimorbidity patterns can provide guidance for accurate monitoring of persistent <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> and, early detection of secondary complications.

40|$|The {{relation}} between maternal depressive symptoms and children’s mental <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> {{has been well}} established. However, prior studies have predominantly focused on maternal reports of children’s mental <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> and on parenting behavior, as a broad and unilateral concept. This cross-sectional study examined specific observed mother–child interaction behaviors through which maternal depressive symptoms are assumed to affect children’s mental <b>health</b> <b>problems.</b> We expected higher rates of maternal depressive symptoms to predict higher rates of children’s mental <b>health</b> <b>problems,</b> and we expected this relation to be mediated by low maternal warmth and high maternal psychological control. The sample consisted of 111 mother–child dyads referred for treatment. The mother–child interaction behaviors were coded according to the observed mother–child interaction tasks. Children’s mental <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> were assessed using both maternal reports and children’s self-reports. As expected, {{the results showed that}} maternal depressive symptoms were strongly related to maternal reports of children’s internalizing and externalizing mental <b>health</b> <b>problems.</b> Surprisingly, maternal depressive symptoms were unrelated to children’s self-reported depressive symptoms. Furthermore, mother–child interactions did not mediate the {{relation between}} maternal depressive symptoms and child mental <b>health</b> <b>problems.</b> Maternal depressive symptoms were associated with high maternal warmth, and high psychological control was associated with high levels of mother-reported externalizing mental <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> in children.

Furthermore, we expect that immigrants who use or have been using cannabis experience more mental <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> than native participants who use or have been using cannabis and immigrants who have never used cannabis. Methods: Participants were 11, 100 Dutch secondary school children aged 10 to 25 years, who all filled out a questionnaire containing the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). This questionnaire assesses psychosocial adjustment of children and adolescents. Ethnicity was determined by country of birth. Cannabis use was divided into three categories, ‘never used cannabis’, ‘used cannabis once in their live’ and ‘used cannabis in the four weeks prior to the study’. Total SDQ score was used as a measure for experiencing mental <b>health</b> <b>problems.</b> Results: As expected, both cannabis use and ethnicity were associated with mental <b>health</b> <b>problems.</b> However, an interaction between cannabis use and ethnicity on mental <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> was not found. After controlling for social economic status, severe life events, use of hard drugs and alcohol and smoking, ethnicity was no longer associated with mental <b>health</b> <b>problems.</b> The influence of cannabis use remained.
