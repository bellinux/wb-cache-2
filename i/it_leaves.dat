5|$|In {{the darkest}} night of hate and {{intolerance}} we see impossible love stories conquering what our governments and societies declare is legally 'allowed' to be love... It is for love that transcends the romantic conception {{of man and}} woman and stretches out into the impossibilities of the cosmos. <b>It</b> <b>leaves</b> room for failure but hopes for success.|$|E

This section of highway runs through mostly wooded terrain as <b>it</b> <b>leaves</b> Woodbury for Cornwall.|$|E

5|$|According to the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT), NY324 {{begins at}} NY384 in eastern Niagara Falls. NY324 heads south, {{overlapping}} with I-190 (the Niagara Section of the New York State Thruway) across the North Grand Island Bridge to Grand Island, where <b>it</b> <b>leaves</b> the expressway at exit20.

South of exit20, the official and signed routings are identical.|$|E
5|$|Larrys Creek is in {{a narrow}} valley formed by {{mountains}} and hills, with steep to moderate slopes. The channel pattern is regular, with a dendritic drainage pattern. South of its source, the creek turns to flow southwest along {{the northern edge of}} Green Mountain, turns south into the State Game Lands at Buckhorn Mountain, and flows south along the western edge of Coal Mountain. The only named peak on the west bank of Larrys Creek itself is Harris Point, where <b>it</b> <b>leaves</b> the dissected Allegheny Plateau.|$|E
5|$|NY31A {{begins at}} a four-way {{intersection}} {{in the southern}} portion of the village of Medina. At this junction, NY31 travels {{to the west and}} to the north (eastbound), NY63 travels to the north and to the south, and NY31A travels to the east as Maple Ridge Road. <b>It</b> <b>leaves</b> the village shortly afterward, entering a rural area of Orleans County dominated by open fields. The route heads due east to Millville, a small hamlet situated at the junction of NY31A and East Shelby Road in northeastern Shelby. At {{the eastern edge of the}} community, NY31A meets West County House Road, the former routing of NY31A toward Knowlesville.|$|E

5|$|NY33 {{becomes a}} two-lane route once again as it heads out into Alden and {{eventually}} joins another state-maintained street radiating {{out from the}} city, Walden Avenue, unsigned NY952Q. NY33 and the Genesee Street name take over Walden's straight, slightly north-trending course as <b>it</b> <b>leaves</b> Erie County for Genesee County. In the latter, it intersects with NY77 {{in the center of}} the first community it encounters, the small village of Corfu. At the Batavia town line, it becomes Pearl Street, a name it keeps until it reaches NY98 within the city of Batavia.|$|E
5|$|Near the {{southern}} edge of Rockefeller State Park Preserve, NY448 turns east and enters Kykuit, the estate of the Rockefeller family. At the hamlet of Pocantico Hills, the highway intersects with Lake Road and turns to the northeast, passing through more residential areas as <b>it</b> <b>leaves</b> the estate. NY448 passes the Pocantico Hills Central School on its way, continuing northeast towards Phelps Way (NY117). The road continues through a vacant area and heads northward into Mount Pleasant, where NY448 terminates at an intersection with NY117. Bedford Road continues east of this point as part of NY117.|$|E

Its official version is in French, {{in line with}} the Metre Convention. <b>It</b> <b>leaves</b> some scope for local interpretation, particularly regarding names and terms in different languages, so for example the United States' National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has produced a version of the CGPM document (NIST SP 330) which clarifies local interpretation for English-language publications that use American English and another document (NIST SP 811) that gives general guidance for the use of SI in the United States and conversion factors between SI and customary units.|$|E
5|$|The ink sac of an octopus {{is located}} under the {{digestive}} gland. A gland {{attached to the}} sac produces the ink, and the sac stores it. The sac is {{close enough to the}} funnel for the octopus to shoot out the ink with a water jet. Before <b>it</b> <b>leaves</b> the funnel, the ink passes through glands which mix it with mucus, creating a thick, dark blob which allows the animal to escape from a predator. The main pigment in the ink is melanin, which gives it its black colour. Cirrate octopuses lack the ink sac.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} terminus of NY42's southern segment {{marks the}} small hamlet of Big Indian, after which Esopus Creek crosses {{for the last}} time, turning south to its source at Winnisook Lake. The road begins a sustained climb {{over the next two}} miles paralleling an Esopus tributary, Birch Creek, up to Pine Hill. At the road to Belleayre Ski Center, in Highmount, the last junction before <b>it</b> <b>leaves</b> the Catskill Park and enters Delaware County, it is for the first time signed as a north–south route.|$|E

The route heads northeast through a mix of agricultural and residential areas before turning east in a patch of woodland and passing more farm fields and residences. MD 313 turns northeast into wooded residential areas and enters Millington, where it becomes Sassafras Street.|$|E
5|$|Bambi is a {{roe deer}} fawn {{born in a}} thicket to a young doe in late spring one year. Over {{the course of the}} summer, his mother teaches him about the various {{inhabitants}} of the forest and the ways deer live. When she feels he is old enough, she takes him to the meadow which he learns is both a wonderful but also dangerous place as <b>it</b> <b>leaves</b> the deer exposed and in the open. After some initial fear over his mother's caution, Bambi enjoys the experience. On a subsequent trip, Bambi meets his Aunt Ena, and her twin fawns Faline and Gobo. They quickly become friends and share what they have learned about the forest. While they are playing, they encounter princes, male deer, for the first time. After the stags leave, the fawns learn that those were their fathers, but that the fathers rarely stay with or speak to the females and young.|$|E
5|$|Briar Creek begins where Knob Mountain, Huntington Mountain, and Lee Mountain meet {{in western}} Briar Creek Township. It flows east {{for a short}} {{distance}} before turning south through a gap in Lee Mountain, briefly descending quite steeply. The course levels out as <b>it</b> <b>leaves</b> the mountain behind and begins flowing through a valley after a short distance. It flows under Pennsylvania Route 93, leaving the valley behind. Soon afterwards, the stream picks up the tributary West Branch Briar Creek and turns southeast. After some distance, it enters the community of Briar Creek {{and picks up the}} tributary East Branch Briar Creek. The stream then turns southwest and reaches its confluence with the Susquehanna River near French Island.|$|E
