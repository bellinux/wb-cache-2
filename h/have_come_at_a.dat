5|$|Bunning's {{perfect game}} {{occurred}} in the 1964 season, during which the Phillies finished {{at the top and}} the Mets finished bottom. Pitcher Jim Bunning, in his first season with the Phillies, entered play on June 21 with a 6–2 record on the season. He was opposed on the mound by Tracy Stallard for the Mets in the first game of a doubleheader. Through the first four innings, Bunning totaled four strikeouts through twelve batters. In the fifth inning, Phillies second baseman Tony Taylor preserved the perfect game with his strong defensive play. A diving catch and a throw from the knees kept Mets catcher Jesse Gonder off of the bases. Bunning also made plays at the plate, hitting a double and driving in two runs in the sixth inning. By the end of the game, even the Mets fans were cheering Bunning's effort; he had only reached a three-ball count on two batters, and retired shortstop Charley Smith on a pop-out, and pinch-hitters George Altman and John Stephenson on strikeouts, to complete the perfect game. Bunning, who at the time had seven children, said that his game, pitched on Father's Day, could not <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> more appropriate time. He remarked that his slider was his best pitch, just like the no-hitter I pitched for Detroit six years ago. Bunning became the first pitcher to throw a winning no-hitter in both leagues, and posted the first regular-season perfect game since Charlie Robertson in 1922 (Don Larsen's prior perfect game was in the 1956 World Series). The Phillies also won the second game of the doubleheader, 8–2, behind Rick Wise.|$|E
25|$|From Moscow's {{point of}} view, the coup could not <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> worse time. The {{government}} crisis in Prague lasted from 20 to 27 February, just when Western foreign ministers were meeting in London. From the West's perspective, the coup {{was an example}} of Communism in its most unacceptable form; Moscow seemed to the West bent on ruthless expansion and the suppression of freedom.|$|E
25|$|Bunning, who at {{the time}} had seven children, said that his game, pitched on Father's Day (although Father's Day did not officially become a holiday until 1972), could not <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> more {{appropriate}} time. He remarked that his slider was his best pitch, just like the no-hitter I pitched for Detroit six years ago. Bunning posted the first regular-season perfect game since Charlie Robertson in 1922 (Don Larsen's perfect game was in the 1956 World Series). The Phillies also won the second game of the doubleheader, 8–2, behind Rick Wise, who earned his first major league victory in his first start.|$|E

25|$|The {{return trip}} to Brazil in 2014 could not <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> worse {{time from the}} Club's perspective, having been placed under a {{transfer}} embargo for taking out a loan of £100,000 from the PFA on 3 June. On 15 August, City paid of the PFA loan and lifted the transfer embargo that came with it. Later that day, City announced Graham Cummins as their first signing of the summer. On 21 August, Christian Ribeiro became City's second and final summer signing. City were later able to permanently sign loanees Ryan Harley, David Noble and Alex Nicholls; whilst also adding Clinton Morrison and Tom McCready to the squad.|$|E
25|$|Sadly, the {{conditions}} of Ælfgifu's return to fortune remain unclear. It would have been important to know, for instance, how and what on terms she came to hold the estates mentioned in her will. Those at Newnham Murren and Linslade were previously granted to her by King Edgar and now returned to the royal family, but {{it is impossible to}} determine which of the other estates were part of her dower property and which were inherited or acquired otherwise. As noted earlier, a case has been made for Princes Risborough as having been passed on through the maternal line. If the other holdings were likewise her own, the rehabilitation of her position may <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> great price, one which considerably enriched the royal family with land north of the Thames.|$|E

Halfpenny told What's on TV that [...] "it couldn't <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> worse time" [...] because Amy is on her final chance with Val and Eric. Cain is unsympathetic, angry - while Amy is scared. Hordley said Cain wants to keep it [...] "low-key - to get rid and then move on." [...] He attempts to force her to abort the baby. Amy agrees because she isn't [...] "very bright" [...] and thinks it will be the [...] "easier option." [...] When she sees her ultrasound scan, Amy cannot go ahead with the abortion due to her own upbringing. Amy's left in a terrified frame of mind when Victoria tells her about Cain's violent past.|$|E

500|$|In November 2009, it was {{reported}} that Stanton would reprise her role as Jill. Digital Spy forum members had previously pointed out that her return was hinted at in a photo on the official EastEnders website and in a feature ("Script Peek") where Phil is quoted as saying, [...] "I know exactly what makes her tick" [...] before adding [...] "I've wriggled off her hook so many times. She's already picturing me standing in the dock" [...] in the 29 December episode. Marsden returned to investigate the murder of Archie Mitchell. A source told Digital Spy, [...] "Marsden has a score to settle with Phil. She was never far behind Phil when he put a foot out of place all those years ago and she's back with a vengeance...With so many people in the frame for Archie's murder, Marsden has a difficult job on her hands if she wants to pin it on Phil." [...] Of her return she said, [...] "It came completely out of the blue, and knocked me for six."...I really thought Marsden was no more. It was a really great surprise because I’d just finished a year’s run at the National Theatre, appearing in a new play called England People Very Nice – so it couldn’t <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> better time." [...] She returned on 28 December 2009.|$|E
500|$|Quisling {{began to}} {{familiarise}} {{himself with the}} international fascist movement, attending the 1934 Montreux Fascist conference in December. For his party, the association with Italian fascism could not <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> worse time, so soon after headlines of illegal Italian incursions into Abyssinia. On his return trip from Montreux, he met Nazi ideologue and foreign policy theorist Alfred Rosenberg, and though he preferred to see his own policies as a synthesis of Italian fascism and German Nazism, {{by the time of}} the 1936 elections, Quisling had in part become the [...] "Norwegian Hitler" [...] that his opponents had long accused him of being. Part of this was due to his hardening anti-Semitic stance, associating Judaism with Marxism, liberalism and, increasingly, anything else he found objectionable, and part as a result of Nasjonal Samling's growing similarity to the German Nazi Party. Despite receiving an unexpected boost when the Norwegian government acceded to Soviet demands to arrest Leon Trotsky, the party's election campaign never gained momentum. Although Quisling sincerely believed he had the support of around 100,000 voters, and declared to his party that they would win an absolute minimum of ten seats, Nasjonal Samling managed to poll just 26,577, fewer than in 1933 when they had fielded candidates in only half the districts. Under this pressure, the party split in two, with Hjort leading the breakaway group; although fewer than fifty members left immediately, many more drifted away during 1937.|$|E
2500|$|Toyokuni {{was highly}} prolific, and, by 1800, the Utagawa school had supplanted the Katsukawa {{as the major}} {{producers}} of kabuki-e. His success appears to <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> price, however, as {{the consensus is that}} the quality of his later work [...] "shows a marked decline," [...] and even [...] "degenerated frequently into sheer grotesquerie." [...] Some also contend Toyokuni's talent was [...] "predominantly imitative," [...] more the product of study than [...] "intuitive genius." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although Sills' voice type was {{characterized}} as a [...] "lyric coloratura", she took a number of heavier spinto and dramatic coloratura roles more associated with heavier voices as she grew older, including Bellini's Norma, Donizetti's Lucrezia Borgia (with Susanne Marsee as Orsini) and the latter composer's [...] "Three Queens", Anna Bolena, Maria Stuarda and Elisabetta in Roberto Devereux (opposite Plácido Domingo in the title part). She was admired in those roles for transcending the lightness of her voice with dramatic interpretation, although it may <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> cost: Sills later commented that Roberto Devereux shortened her career by at least four years.|$|E
2500|$|Holland and Smith had {{difficulties}} in casting {{the role of}} Dr Legg, as they had problems finding an actor of the right age, intelligence, and class, who could also play a Jewish professional man. Jewish actor Leonard Fenton was suggested by the writer Bill Lyons and took {{a great interest in}} the role. Holland and Smith thought that he would be perfect and he was subsequently cast as Dr Legg. Fenton has since revealed that the character was based on him. He has commented, [...] "It wasn't easy raising a family on theatre wages, so EastEnders couldn't <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> better time. It was the first time I had played myself on television. I'm normally a character actor, but Dr Legg was based on me." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1998, George and Moss {{put their}} {{differences}} aside {{and the band}} reunited to do a reunion tour, kicking off with a performance on VH1 Storytellers. George said about the reunion, [...] "Culture Club's reunion couldn't <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> better time for rock", adding that, [...] "It's a nostalgia trip, there's no way of avoiding that." [...] The tour was a major success. Greatest Moments, a compilation album based around the Storytellers performance, was released, and went platinum in UK. It included new songs such as [...] "I Just Wanna Be Loved", which hit UK No.4. However, their new-found success was short-lived and their fifth studio album, Don't Mind If I Do, released in 1999, peaked at No.64 in the UK. It included minor UK hits in [...] "Your Kisses Are Charity" [...] (UK No.25) and [...] "Cold Shoulder" [...] (UK No.43).|$|E

2500|$|In 1995, {{following}} a spell {{in a drug}} rehab clinic, which first alerted the public to her drug problem, Westbrook was reintroduced into EastEnders by executive producer Corinne Hollingworth. She has commented, [...] "the call from the producers couldn't <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> more opportune moment for me. The soap was suffering from poor ratings and so they decided, as they normally do, to bring some familiar faces back onto the Square. The producers were aware of my addiction by now [...] but they had also read that I was now clean [...] once I assured them that I was well [...] they invited me back for another year." [...] The character's [...] "dramatic" [...] return to EastEnders aired on 25 July 1995 and began when her screen brothers traced Sam to Spain and she ended up in bed with [...] "bad boy" [...] David Wicks (Michael French). Several cast changes had occurred since Westbrook had last been in the soap, including a recast of her screen mother Peggy, who was now played by Barbara Windsor. As well as her former friends, Westbrook has revealed that she became particularly close to Windsor, who she says [...] "instantly took me under her wing", and Martine McCutcheon, who played Tiffany Raymond.|$|E
2500|$|Sarah Ellis from Inside Soap {{wrote that}} Daniel's arrival could not <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> better time for Paul, who was grieving for his {{recently}} deceased niece Kate. Phillipps said that Daniel {{was excited to}} spend time with Paul and believed that he could help him with his grief. He continued, [...] "I think Daniel is really happy to just be settled for a while because he is road-tripping. Paul has been grieving over Kate's death, so they are a really good match for each other right now. Their relationship is really strong." [...] Dennis asked for Paul and Daniel's first scene to be rewritten as he wanted to establish their strong relationship from the beginning. The original script saw Paul failing to recognise his nephew. Dennis took his worries to the writers who agreed to change the scenes. Phillipps stated that Paul and Daniel have [...] "a great uncle and nephew relationship" [...] and thought they were a good pairing, as they both wanted to be good influences on each other. He explained that Daniel initially believed his uncle was beloved by the community, but he slowly realised {{that a lot of people}} do not like Paul. Daniel decided to stay in Erinsborough and try and redeem his uncle. He told Ellis, [...] "Daniel finds it bizarre that Paul isn't well liked, because he is all about the love!" ...|$|E
