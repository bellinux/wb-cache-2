This great buoy contained various appropriate articles, which had been hermetically sealed up in it before it left Sardis, where it was manufactured. All the documents, books, coins, and other articles which are usually placed in the corner-stones of important buildings were put <b>in</b> <b>this,</b> <b>together</b> {{with the names of}} the persons who had gone on this perilous expedition and those who had been its projectors and promoters.

[...] He drew her closer, kissed her again, held her {{as he would have}} held a child in a paroxysm, {{soothing}} her silently till it could abate. Her vehemence had brought with it tears; she dried them as she disengaged herself. The next moment, however, she resumed, attacking him again: [...] "For a public man she'd be the perfect companion.
