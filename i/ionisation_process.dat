Measurements on the other CVD diamond sample resulted in ionisation efficiencies of ~ 2 % for H and up to 12 % for O.

Instead of the normally observed elastic scattering of X-rays when they hit an atom, which generates a scattered wave of the same energy but with a shift in phase, X-ray radiation near the absorption edge of an atom creates a partial <b>ionisation</b> <b>process.</b> Some new X-ray radiation is generated from the inner electron shells of the atoms. The X-ray radiation already being scattered is interfered with by the new radiation, both amplitude and phase being altered.

Whereas {{the real part is}} either positive or negative, the imaginary is always positive, resulting in an addition to the phase angle.|$|E
50|$|The Q-machine plasma {{is created}} at a plate {{that has been}} heated to about 2000 K and hence is called the hot plate. Electrons are emitted by the hot plate through {{thermionic}} emission, and ions are created through contact ionization of atoms of alkali metals that have low ionisation potentials. The hot plate is made of a metal that has a large work function and can withstand high temperatures, e.g. tungsten or rhenium. The alkali metal is boiled in an oven {{that is designed to}} direct a beam of alkaline metal vapour onto the hot plate. A high value of the hot plate work function and a low ionisation potential of the metal makes for a low potential barrier for an electron in the alkaline metal to overcome, thus making the <b>ionisation</b> <b>process</b> more efficient. Sometimes barium is used instead of an alkaline metal due to its excellent spectroscopic properties. The fractional ionization of a Q-machine plasma can approach unity, which can be orders of magnitude greater than that predicted by the Saha ionization equation.

Key questions for the first experiments with this new type of light source are linked to light – matter interaction and <b>ionisation</b> <b>processes.</b> This paper gives an overview of the ultrafast ionisation dynamics and electron emission of pure and doped rare gas clusters illuminated with intense short-wavelength pulses by summarizing the findings of recent years work at FLASH. Atomic clusters are ideal for investigating the light – matter interaction because their size can be tuned from the molecular to the bulk regime thus allowing to distinguish between intra and interatomic <b>processes.</b> The <b>ionisation</b> <b>processes</b> turned out to be strongly wavelength dependent. Plasma absorption, while dominant at 13 eV becomes insignificant at photon energies above 40 eV. The cluster ionisation and disintegration proceeds in several steps on a time scale from fs to ps. Insight into the involved processes can be obtained with ion and electron spectroscopy. The high intensity of FLASH pulses opens the door for a new imaging approach to study nanoparticles.

The helium (e, 2 e) {{experimental results}} presented recently by the Manchester group have been obtained over an exceptionally wide range of scattering angles, and have provided the first opportunity to derive multipole angular correlation information in a direct way. This type of analysis has been applied to measurements symmetric in both scattering angle and outgoing electron energy obtained at incident energies from 10 to 50 eV above threshold. A significant result is that the lower incident energies give rise to the highest multipole components.
