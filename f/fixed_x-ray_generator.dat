40|$|Abstract- The {{high-density}} LSI packages such as BGA (ball grid array) and CSP (chip scale package) {{are widely}} used in the electrical products. Solder bump is used as an electrical junction of these packages, and they cannot be observed from outside. X-ray fluoroscopy is used as inspection method. It cannot evaluate the shape of solder bump correctly because information is compressed along the ray. The oblique CT is considered as a method for accurately examining {{the shape of the}} solder bump. Conventional oblique CT still has the speed and mechanical constraint, and it cannot be introduced into the soldering line. In this paper, we propose the novel oblique CT system that can non-destructively obtain the 3 D shape of solder bump at a high-speed. This system obtains the projection images from various directions using the rotational transfer of flat panel detector and the <b>fixed</b> mounted open-type <b>X-ray</b> <b>generator</b> that has a wide radiation angle, and reconstructs 3 D image using the 3 D FBP (Filtered Back Projection) method. In addition, we have developed the reconstruction acceleration unit for oblique CT, and thus the 3 D image is obtained in the real time. In our experiments, we evaluated the solder joints of BGA mounted substrate. The result demonstrated that the proposed system obtained the information that was able to determine the good or defective situation in soldering. This system is the world's first CT system, which can be introduced into the soldering line, and it is operated by more than 20 domestic and foreign factories now. I...|$|R

Finally, the use of EDXRF related to archaeometric research (pigments in ancient paintings and major elements in the metal alloys) is emphasised.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{characteristics}} of triple GEM detectors {{have been studied}} systematically by using cosmic ray muons. The minimum ionizing particle (MIP) spectra has been taken for different GEM voltage setting. Efficiency of GEM detector has been measured for cosmic ray.

40|$|Abstract. A {{simple and}} fairly {{inexpensive}} total reflection X-ray fluorescence (TXRF) spectrometer has been designed, constructed and realized. The spectrometer {{is capable of}} ultra-trace multielement analysis as well as performs surface characterization of thin films. The TXRF setup comprises of an <b>X-ray</b> <b>generator,</b> a slit-collimator arrangement, a monochromator/cutoff-stage, a sample reflector stage and an X-r y detection system. The glancing angle of incidence on the two reflectors is implemented using a sine-bar mechanism that enables precise angle adjustments. An energy dispersive detector and a GM counter are employed for measuring respectively the fluorescence intensities and the direct X-ray beam intensity. A Cu-target <b>X-ray</b> <b>generator</b> with its line focus window is used as an excitation source. The spectrometer is quite portable with its compact design and use of a peltier cooled solid state detector for energy dispersive detection.
