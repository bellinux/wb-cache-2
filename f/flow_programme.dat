On the other hand, expectations of future improvements in macroeconomic variables and trend appreciation of the currency may undermine the relationship between interest rates, exchange rates and economic fundamentals, making the economy vulnerable to sudden changes in market sentiments regarding the timing and path to Eurozone accession. Recent developments in Hungary illustrate the impact of changing expectations on exchange rate and interest rate volatility. Two lessons {{can be drawn from}} the Hungarian experience. First, benign market sentiment and easier access to finance does not imply less pressure to correct macroeconomic imbalances in the long run.

Kikuyu foggage (standing hay) could {{play an important role}} in a fodder <b>flow</b> <b>programme</b> to sustain dry ewes during late winter after their lambs have been weaned in mid-winter. The potential of kikuyu foggage to supply in the feed requirements of dry ewes was evaluated over four winter periods. The foggage was obtained by closing off the kikuyu to grazing during either late January or late February. The foggage was grazed for eight weeks, from mid-July to mid-September, using either strip or continuous grazing systems. Closing off date did not significantly influence the chemical composition of the material on offer. The ewes in the different treatments lost between 4. 7 and 10. 3 % of their initial body weight over the grazing period. In vitro digestible organic matter (IVDOM) of the foggage declined as winter progressed and was positively correlated with the body weight loss of the ewes. Foggage utilization varied between 36. 7 and 43. 5 %, indicating a high proportion of fodder wastage. The body weight loss of the dry ewes during the grazing period suggested that kikuyu foggage in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands was unable to sustain the body weight of the dry ewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{commitment}} {{to understanding the}} implications of a 1. 5 °C global temperature warming limit has contributed to a growing realisation that transformative adaptation is necessary to avoid catastrophic environmental and social consequences. This is particularly the case in urban settlements where disconnection from the systems that support life is pervasive and injustice and inequality play out daily. This paper argues {{that in order to}} transform towards thriving social-ecological systems, transformative capacity needs to be strengthened. The paper builds on the rich literature of adaptive capacity, alongside concepts of transformation that are drawn from resilience theory, organisational change, and developmental psychology. Reconnection to life-support systems, agency, and social cohesion are put forward as three foundational aspects of transformative capacity. A transdisciplinary case study of the <b>FLOW</b> <b>programme</b> in the Bergrivier Municipality, South Africa, is used to explore how transformative capacity has been built in practice. The case study explores an innovative programme that works with unemployed urban youth, alongside the exploration and introduction of a community currency in the informal business sector, and strengthening cross-scalar interaction between the local municipality and youth.

The deliverables agreed for the project were: • validating EMAPS through simulations of known problems and experimental and ﬁeld data concerning slug ﬂow • introducing numerical enhancements to EMAPS • decreasing computation times in EMAPS • using multi-dimensional methods to investigate slug ﬂow The outcome of the current project has been a combination of new product development (1 D multiphase code EMAPS) and a methodological innovation (use of 2 D CFD for channel simulations of slugs). These are: • New computing framework composed of: – Upgraded version of 1 D code EMAPS – Numerical enhancements with velocity proﬁle coeﬃcients – Validation with wave growth problem – Parallelisation of all models and sources in EMAPS – Testing suite for all sequential and parallel cases – Versioning control (SVN) and automatic testing upon code submission. • Use of 2 D CFD VOF for channel simulation with: – Special initialisation techniques to allow transient simulations – Validation with wave growth problem – Mathematical perturbation analysis – Simulations of 92 experimental slug ﬂow cases The cost of uptake of the above tools is relatively small compared to the beneﬁts that are expected to follow, regarding predictions of hydrodynamic slugging.

40|$|The rapid {{increase}} in the magnitude of anthelmintic resistance towards commercial chemical anthelmintics, calls for alternative methods to complement treatment or replace anthelmintics. During {{the last two decades}} more and more calls have been made for a holistic management solution. Recent studies on breeding for resistant animals and bioactive forages highlight the potential of these to contribute towards parasite control. For this study, gastrointestinal infection in a merino flock was investigated by means of faecal egg counts (FEC). The level of parasite infection in weaned merino lambs in their first summer could be linked to weather conditions. Anthelmintic resistance in the flock was quantified and compared to the resistance level some years earlier. Within the flock, 18 % of the ewes appeared to be resistant with consistently (P< 0. 05) lower FEC {{than the rest of the}} flock. Lespedeza cuneata, a tannin-containing legume, is, according to scientific literature, one of the promising bioactive forages. Depending on the level of condensed tannin (CT), ruminant digestion can be complemented or compromised by the tannins. Small plot trials were conducted to establish production criteria for L. cuneata, currently lacking in South Africa. The grand mean dry mass (DM) yield for the first growing season, (characterized by above normal rainfall), was 8. 3 t ha- 1, compared to the 2. 56 t ha- 1 for the second growing season, (characterized by below normal rainfall). Highly significant differences (P< 0. 001) were measured between the yields produced under different cutting frequencies (6, 8 and 12 weeks) and cutting heights (5 cm and 15 cm). Except for crude protein levels, ADF (acid detergent fibre) and NDF (neutral detergent fibre) analysis of the complete plant indicated a less acceptable nutritional quality. Since sheep selected leaves during grazing, separated leaf samples were analysed. Chemical feed analyses of leaves were more favourable, compared to feed analysis of the whole plant. The condensed tannin (CT) content of leaves increased significantly (P< 0. 05) with increased moisture stress and varied between 24. 5 and 122 g kg- 1 DM over the growing seasons. Different dried herbage diets were offered to Merino ewes in a follow-up trial to evaluate the anthelmintic properties of the forage. The leaf portion of Lespedeza cuneata hay and Medicago sativa hay was offered ad libitum to confined sheep. Lespedeza cuneata is a tannin rich legume, while Medicago sativa, known for its very low tannin content, was used as control. FEC were significantly (P< 0. 05) lower in the Lespedeza group after 35 days. To determine the influence of condensed tannin (CT) level on the hatch efficacy of Haemonchus contortus eggs, acetone leaf extracts of L. cuneata plants with different condensed tannin contents (73. 5, 88, 102 and 122 g kg- 1 DM) were tested in an in vitro assay on H. contortus eggs. Concentrations of between 0. 63 and 20 mg ml- 1 were used in the assay. Concentrations higher than 10 mg ml- 1 led to complete inhibition of egg hatching with all the plant extracts regardless of CT content. A typical dose related response of the extracts of plants with very high tannin content was found, but not with plant extracts containing lower tannin concentrations. The results of the study indicate that L. cuneata can be incorporated in a fodder <b>flow</b> <b>programme</b> as an alternative or complementary strategy to other methods, to manage the detrimental effect of gastrointestinal parasites in sheep.

40|$|In part A a {{non-singular}} {{connection matrix}} {{is used to}} combine the self and mutual impedance matrix {{of a group of}} mutually coupled elements with a network bus impedance matrix; the resulting impedance matrix is then reduced by eliminating rows and columns if necessary, to give the bus impedance matrix of the interconnected network. The self impedances of the mutually coupled group of elements are added to the network bus impedance matrix {{in the same way as}} uncoupled elements, then the mutual impedances Are added followed by matrix reduction. By considering examples of the connection matrix applied to adding a single element, then to adding groups of uncoupled and coupled elements to a network, rules are devised for combining the celf impedances of branch and loop elements and group mutual imped-ances with the network bus impedance matrix. From the bus impedance matrix of power system sequence networks fault parameters are derived by simple arithmetic operations. It is shown that rules for adding a group of mutually coupled loop elements can be applied to modify a bus impedance matrix when element self and mutual impedances are changed. The derivation of an equivalent network from the bus impedance matrix is noted; the addition of two network bus impedance matrixes is considered and shown to be a special case of the more general problem of adding a self and mutual impedance matrix to a bus impedance matrix. A numerical example involving the calculation and modification of the bus impedance matrix, deriving an equivalent circuit and adding bus impedance matrixes is included. An outline of a digital computer power system short circuit programme which calculates fault parameters from the bus impedance matrix derived from randomly ordered lists of network element self and mutual impedances is given. The inverse of the connection matrix discussed in part A is used in part B to combine a network bus admittance matrix with the self and mutual admittance matrix of a group of mutually coupled elements. From this the Well known method of forming the bus admit-tance matrix from uncoupled element self admittances follows and is extended to cover self and mutual admittances of coupled elements. For a group of mutually coupled elements, the diagonal terms of the group admittance matrix are added to the bus admittance matrix in the same way as self admittances of uncoupled elements while the off-diagonal terms are added in a matrix operation either before or after the diagonal terms. A relationship is indicated between the admit-tance connection matrix and the group element bus incidence matrix. Although the presence of mutual coupling results in some loss of spal-sity, it is shown that for power systems the bus admittance matrix still has a large proportion of zero terms. By eliminating terms below the main diagonal in an optimal order, a "factored inverse" of the admittance matrix is derived which has considerably fewer non-zero terms than the corresponding bus impedance matrix. Terms of the Impedance matrix can be obtained from the inverse as required. The numerical calculation of the bus admittance matrix of a power system zero sequence network is set out and derivation of fault impedance and current distribution factors included. A digital computer programme using the bus admittance matrix and factored inverse method for power system short circuit studies is described and a tabulation indicates the affect on computer storage requirements of the optimal factoring procedure. In part C Newton's method of power system load flow calculation using Gaussian elimination to solve the voltage correction equations is discussed. The network and problem parameters are specified in rectangular cartesian co-ordinates. As the voltage correction equation matrix has the same form as the bus admittance matrix, a preferred order for the Gaussian elimination which preserves sparsity is devised by analogy with network reduction. A digital computer load <b>flow</b> <b>programme</b> is outlined and a tab-ulation included which shows that, for typical power system networks, the preferred elimination order retains sparsity in the matrix. Algol listings of the digital computer short circuit and load flow programmes are included in the supplement with data and corresponding calculated results for power system studies...|$|E

40|$|Introduction The {{success and}} growth of {{electronic}} these and dissertations (ETDs) has been noted according to literature sources. A number of universities are encouraging and have in place work <b>flow</b> <b>programmes</b> for the submission of theses and dissertations in digital format. The University of Johannesburg (UJ), one of the largest, multi-campus, residential universities in South Africa, has set its goals to achieve the highest distinction in scholarship and research within the higher education context through the role out of its new generation of scholars. This is clearly defined within the the Postgraduate Centre (PGC) ’s purpose and aims to: • coordinate, extend and enhance the postgraduate support systems; • assist the University in attracting, training and delivering quality postgraduate students; and • {{increase the number of}} postgraduate students (masters and doctoral). Aims and Objectives This presentation explores the new University of Johannesburg’s ETDs submission work flow since the merger of the three legacy institutions, formerly Rand Afrikaans University (RAU), Technikon Witwatersrand (TWR) and Vista University. It also investigates the contribution to research by postgraduate students, past and current. The presentation will further examine the ETDs scholarly communication model being applied through the merger of the vocational, technical and research discourses of the new university as it re-invents itself as a masters and doctoral granting university. The role of stakeholders in the ETDs work-flow will also be explored and evaluated in order to explain the implementation and management of submissions of ETDs into UJDigispace, an open access repository, which was established in 2009. The responsibility of managing and preserving ETDs at UJ sits with the University library and faculties. There are a number of issues {{that needs to be addressed}} before these research outputs are made visible through networks and the Internet. Therefore the paper will further argue that, a project plan which maps out objectives, outputs, processes, responsibilities, time frames and resource requirements for submission and management of ETDs be established. Data Sources and Methodology The study forms part of an investigation and strategy to establish a solid ETD submission manual at UJ. Data for this case study will be obtained through interviews of various stakeholders identified by the author. These include inter alia, the faculty research co-ordinators, theses and dissertation supervisors, library staff responsible for ETDs, information literacy, and computer literacy at the library and E-learning instructors at the Centre for Technology Assisted Learning. Desktop research will also form part of the data sources. The research will combine the qualitative and quantitative methods to capitalize strength on each approach and offset their different weaknesses. Conclusion The paper will address how UJ can go about with the implementation of its ETD workflow that would promote, stimulate and prepare postgraduate students for academic excellence, support thesis supervisory work and research writing that adhere to international standards of referencing. The overall outcomes are aimed at the university’s ETDs contributing to the global knowledge ecology, fostering its prestige and recognition. It is also high time all South African universities contribute to the International ‘Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations’ (NDLTD).

40|$|There is {{a demand}} for a whole field {{velocimetry}} technique which offers the capability of rapid characterisation of complex engineering flow fields. This thesis describes a research programme aimed at {{the development of a}} reliable Doppler global velocimeter, suited to the measurement of such <b>flows.</b> The <b>programme</b> of work undertaken is discussed with reference both to research undertaken elsewhere and to previous work on the system at Oxford. While much of the underlying technology required for the construction of an accurate and reliable velocimeter has already been studied in Oxford and elsewhere, little attention has been paid by previous workers to the examination of the impact of data processing techniques on attainable flow measurement accuracy. In the present work, a number of image processing methods have been utilised for Doppler global velocimetry data processing. Those methods are described here, together with a theoretical analysis of their expected performance when applied to Doppler global velocimetry data. The expected error resulting from image processing considerations and also from the physical characteristics of the Doppler global velocimetry hardware are quantified {{in such a way that}} error estimates may be computed for real measured data frames. The results of the application of the velocimeter to the simple test case of measuring a velocity component of a rotating disc are presented. The velocimeter was subsequently applied to the measurement of a free jet flow and to a transonic flow field in a convergent-divergent nozzle. Correlations with accepted velocity field values were undertaken, and compared to the expected error previously determined. The choice of image processing algorithms was found to be of great importance in terms of Doppler global velocimetry measurement accuracy...|$|R
5|$|The rise of Fascism in {{particular}} frequently encouraged greater state involvement. In Italy, {{between the end}} of the war and 1923 local groups and organisations had established their own local memorials in villages and towns. Not all villages agreed that memorials were appropriate, either for political or religious reasons. With the Fascist revolution, this process became more centralised; veteran groups were assimilated by the Fascist government in 1926, and a systematic attempt to construct suitable national and local memorials followed. In Germany, the political and economic chaos of the immediate post-war years discouraged the construction of civic war memorials and comparatively few civic memorials in their larger towns, mainly due to the shortage of funds in the inter-war German economy and political disagreements between local groups as to what to commemorate and how. Those memorials that were constructed were often built instead by local movements, representing particular factional interests. It was only after the rise of the German Nazi party to power in 1933 that substantial funding began to <b>flow</b> into construction <b>programmes,</b> controlled from Berlin.|$|R
50|$|Designed by Lambie-Nairn, the bug idents {{featured}} green moving bugs {{that contained}} the BBC logo {{as well as}} purple, textured 'C'. The bugs could split into others, and would often be depicted either fighting amongst themselves, or as being split or separated multiple times. In-vision was still used, with TC9 being used for links on BBC One and Two, and the CBBC channel using TC2, however the set was changed to vivid backgrounds with blob shapes on, often with the idents playing in the background. Promotions also changed so branding only occurred at the end, at which a wavy blue banner at the bottom would <b>flow</b> it with <b>programme</b> details on, usually with a blob looking in {{from the side of}} the screen. The new channel also had a DOG featuring the BBC logo, with a Blob containing the 'C' only in front. The DOG was not used on terrestrial links, although a clock was occasionally added for morning links, either on its own or located inside a static blob.|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY Fifty one {{infants who}} were oxygen {{dependent}} after treatment for neonatal respiratory disease {{were entered into}} a study programme where 100 % oxygen was delivered at low flow through a nasal catheter. Thirty five (69 %) of the infants were discharged home and the remainder were either discharged to a convalescent hospital or back to their peripheral referring hospital. Excluding repeat admissions for monitoring or {{for the treatment of}} acute infections, 2760 hospital days (79 days/patient) were saved, representing a financial saving of $ 11 990 (£ 6500) per treated infant. A home low <b>flow</b> oxygen therapy <b>programme</b> has benefits to the infant/parent relationship, provides a more constant flow of oxygen than conventional methods, and the early hospital discharge represents a considerable financial saving. Modern treatment of newborn infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) has resulted in a notable decrease in mortality. L Although improved methods of mechanical ventilation have contributed to this achievement, up to 20 % of the ventilated survivors have residual lung disease or broncho...|$|R
