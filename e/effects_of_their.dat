5|$|Many {{saltwater}} fish manufacture {{large amounts of}} trimethylamine oxide {{to protect them from}} the high osmotic <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> environment; conversion of this compound to dimethylamine is responsible for the early odour in unfresh {{saltwater fish}}. In animals, free radical nitric oxide (derived from an amino acid), serves as an important regulatory molecule for circulation.|$|E

5|$|Although {{bicycles}} and motorcycles can {{appear to be}} simple mechanisms with only four major moving parts (frame, fork, and two wheels), these parts are arranged {{in a way that}} makes them complicated to analyze. While it is an observable fact that bikes can be ridden even when the gyroscopic <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> wheels are canceled out, the hypothesis that the gyroscopic effects of the wheels are what keep a bike upright is common in print and online.|$|E

5|$|In {{distinguishing}} {{the police}} characters from other television detectives, Simon {{makes the point}} that even the best police of The Wire are motivated not by a desire to protect and serve, but by the intellectual vanity of believing they are smarter than the criminals they are chasing. However, while many of the police do exhibit altruistic qualities, many officers portrayed on the show are incompetent, brutal, self-aggrandizing, or hamstrung by bureaucracy and politics. The criminals are not always motivated by profit or a desire to harm others; many are trapped in their existence and all have human qualities. Even so, The Wire does not minimize or gloss over the horrific <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> actions.|$|E
5|$|In {{front of}} Marlborough {{the rest of}} the van had mixed success. HMS Bellerophon and HMS Leviathan were both still {{suffering}} the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> exertions earlier in the week and did not breach the enemy line. Instead they pulled along the near side of Éole and America respectively and brought them to close gunnery duels. Rear-Admiral Thomas Pasley of Bellerophon was an early casualty, losing a leg in the opening exchanges. HMS Royal Sovereign, Graves's flagship, was less successful due to a miscalculation of distance that resulted in her pulling up too far from the French line and coming under heavy fire from her opponent Terrible. In the time it took to engage Terrible more closely, Royal Sovereign suffered a severe pounding and Admiral Graves was badly wounded.|$|E
5|$|Cynthia {{knew her}} husband took drugs like Preludin, and {{regularly}} smoked cannabis but {{thought of them}} as not being very dangerous. On 27 March 1965, {{at a dinner party}} given by a dentist, John Riley, the Lennons, Harrison, and Boyd were given LSD without their knowledge. Although told not to leave the house, Harrison drove them to various nightclubs, with Riley following them by taxi. At the Ad Lib club, they thought the lift up to the club was on fire and started screaming, before finally crawling out of the lift for which Mick Jagger, Marianne Faithfull, and Starr were waiting. Harrison later drove them back home in Boyd's Mini Cooper at no more than 10mph, as he was also feeling the effects of the drug. They stayed up all night at Kenwood, experiencing the full <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> first LSD trip.|$|E

5|$|However, Rodes beat Schurz to Oak Hill, so the XI Corps {{division}} {{was forced to}} take up positions in the broad plain north of the town, below and {{to the east of}} Oak Hill. They linked up with the I Corps reserve division of Brig. Gen. John C. Robinson, whose two brigades had been sent forward by Doubleday when he heard about Ewell's arrival. Howard's defensive line was not a particularly strong one in the north. He was soon outnumbered (his XI Corps, still suffering the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> defeat at the Battle of Chancellorsville, had only 8,700 effectives), and the terrain his men occupied in the north was poorly selected for defense. He held out some hope that reinforcements from Slocum's XII Corps would arrive up the Baltimore Pike in time to make a difference.|$|E
5|$|Many SCI {{patients}} have received misinformation about the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> injury on their sexual function {{and benefit from}} education about it. Although sexual education shortly after injury {{is known to be}} helpful and desired, it is frequently missing in rehabilitation settings; a common complaint from those who go through rehabilitation programs is that they offer insufficient information about sexuality. Longer-term education and counseling on sex after discharge from a hospital setting are especially important, yet sexuality {{is one of the most}} often neglected areas in long-term SCI rehabilitation, particularly for women. Care providers may refrain from addressing the topic because they feel intimidated or unequipped to handle it. Clinicians must be circumspect in bringing up sexual matters since people may be uncomfortable with or unready for the subject. Many patients wait for providers to broach the topic even if they do want the information.|$|E

40|$|International audienceMany OECD {{countries}} are reforming their pension systems. We investigate how pension eligibility affects labor supply in couples. Inspired by a theoretical framework, we measure how the sharp {{change in the}} pension eligibility of both partners affects labor force participation. We find that both partners leave the labor force as they become eligible for a pension. The <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> own pension eligibility is 12 percentage points for women and 28 percentage points for men. Women also reduce their labor force participation by 2 to 3 percentage points as their partner reaches pension eligibility. For men, the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> partner’s eligibility is smaller and {{not significantly different from}} zero. For women and men with low education, the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> own eligibility is strong. Regardless of education level, the partner eligibility effect is strong in homogamous couples. Studying joint labor supply, we find that pension eligibility reduces labor supply in couples by 44 percentage points, approximately 4 percentage points more than in a model that ignores partner eligibility effects...|$|R

25|$|Despite {{significant}} efforts L.amboinesis remains {{difficult to}} culture in captivity, though adults will regularly spawn eggs. The cycle from spawning to adult form takes approximately 6 months {{during which time}} {{the vast majority of}} larvae die. As such most shrimps sold in the aquarium industry are wild-caught, this has led to concern about the negative <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> removal on natural reefs though there is currently no evidence of an effect.|$|E
25|$|For the {{advantage}} due to DNA repair, {{there is an}} immediate large benefit of removing DNA damage by recombinational DNA repair during meiosis, since this removal allows greater survival of progeny with undamaged DNA. The advantage of complementation to each sexual partner is avoidance of the bad <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> deleterious recessive genes in progeny by the masking effect of normal dominant genes contributed by the other partner.|$|E
25|$|In some countries, {{there has}} been a move toward harm {{reduction}} by health services, where the use of illicit drugs is neither condoned nor promoted, but services and support are provided to ensure users have adequate factual information readily available, and that the negative <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> use be minimized. Such is the case of Portuguese drug policy of decriminalization, which achieved its primary goal of reducing the adverse health effects of drug abuse.|$|E

25|$|People {{with cancer}} {{undergoing}} chemotherapy are often given dexamethasone to counteract certain side <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> antitumor treatments. Dexamethasone {{can increase the}} antiemetic effect of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, such as ondansetron. The exact mechanism of this interaction is not well-defined, {{but it has been}} theorized that this effect may be due to, among many other causes, inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, anti-inflammatory effects, immunosuppressive effects, decreased release of endogenous opioids, or a combination of the aforementioned.|$|E

Pendulum Monsters have an additional description box which may list a Pendulum Effect that applies while they are in a Pendulum Zone.|$|E
