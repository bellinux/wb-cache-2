25|$|Beginning {{with the}} model year 1999, an {{increasing}} number of vehicles in the world are manufactured with engines that can run on any fuel from 0% ethanol up to 100% ethanol without modification. Many cars and light trucks (a class containing minivans, SUVs and pickup trucks) are designed to be flexible-fuel vehicles using ethanol blends up to 85% (E85) in North America and Europe, and up to 100% (E100) in Brazil. In older model years, their engine systems contained alcohol sensors in the fuel and/or oxygen sensors in the exhaust that provide input to the engine control computer to adjust the fuel injection to achieve stochiometric (no residual fuel or free oxygen in the exhaust) air-to-fuel ratio for any <b>fuel</b> <b>mix.</b> In newer models, the alcohol sensors have been removed, with the computer using only oxygen and airflow sensor feedback to estimate alcohol content. The engine control computer can also adjust (advance) the ignition timing to achieve a higher output without pre-ignition when it predicts that higher alcohol percentages are present in the fuel being burned. This method is backed up by advanced knock sensors – used in most high performance gasoline engines regardless of whether they are designed to use ethanol or not – that detect pre-ignition and detonation.|$|E

2500|$|In general, results differ vastly {{dependent}} on the region considered, due to difference in energy sources to produce electricity that fuels electric vehicles. When considering only CO2 emissions, {{it is noted that}} production of electric cars generate about twice as much emissions as that of internal combustion cars. However, emissions of CO2 during operation are much larger (on average) than during production. For electric cars, emissions caused during operation depend on energy sources used to produce electricity and thus vary a lot geographically. Studies suggest that when taking into account bot production and operation, electric cars would cause more emissions in economies where production of electricity is not clean, e.g., it is mostly coal based.. For this reason, some studies found that driving electric cars is less environmentally damaging in western US states than in eastern ones, where less electricity is produced using cleaner sources. Similarly, in countries like India, Australia or China, where large portion of electricity is produced by using coal, driving electric vehicles would cause larger environmental damage than driving petrol vehicles. When justifying use of electric cars over petrol cars, these kinds of studies do not provide sufficiently clear results. Environmental impact is calculated based on <b>fuel</b> <b>mix</b> used to produce electricity that powers electric cars. However, when a gas vehicle is replaced by an equivalent electric vehicle, additional power must be installed in electrical grid. This additional capacity would normally not be based on the same ratios of energy sources ("clean" [...] versus fossil fuels) than the current capacity. Only when additional electricity production capacity installed to switch from petrol to electric vehicles would predominantly consist of clean sources, switch to electric vehicles could reduce environmental damage. Another common problem in methodology used in comparative studies is that it only focuses on specific kinds of environmental impact. While some studies focus only on emission of gas pollutants over life cycle or only on greenhouse gas emissions such as CO2, comparison should also account for other environmental impacts such as pollutants released otherwise during production and operation or ingredients that can not be effectively recycled. [...] Examples include use of lighter high performing metals, lithium batteries and more rare metals in electric cars, which all have high environmental impact.|$|E

40|$|The lateral fuel {{dispersion}} in {{a large-scale}} (1. 44 m(2) in cross section) bubbling fluidized bed operated under ambient conditions {{has been investigated}} by means of particle tracking with video recording and subsequent digital image analysis. Wood chips and bark pellets were used as tracer particles. Characterization of the <b>fuel</b> <b>mixing</b> pattern was made by single tracer particle tracking while tracking of batches of tracer particles was applied to quantify the <b>fuel</b> <b>mixing</b> through lateral dispersion coefficients. The experimental technique shows good repeatability and dispersion coefficients {{are found to be}} in the order of 10 (- 3) m(2) /s. The lateral transport of the wood chips is observed to occur mainly while these are submerged in the dense bed. Increased fluidization velocity accentuates this pattern, i. e. the share of time spent in the dense bed increases. Only for the wood chips the fluidization velocity was found to have an influence on the lateral dispersion coefficient, which is due to that these are of larger size and lower density than the bark particles. Diffusion-type modeling of the horizontal fuel dispersion is discussed, concluding that such an approach is not suitable in cases with low lateral <b>fuel</b> <b>mixing</b> rate or with a characteristic mixing length in the same order as the lateral length scale of the bed.

40|$|Operational conditions, {{such as the}} {{fluidization}} {{velocity and}} the solids cross-flow, affect the degree of char conversion in a fluidized bed by influencing the different mechanisms related to the <b>fuel</b> <b>mixing.</b> Char conversion is influenced by <b>fuel</b> <b>mixing</b> in both the lateral direction (affecting the fuel residence time) and the axial direction (affecting the char gasification rate). In the present work, this effect is investigated {{through a combination of}} dedicated experiments in a cold unit, in which the effect of the excess velocity on the char segregation is quantified, and validated mathematical modelling. The case of indirect gasification of wood pellets in the Chalmers 2 – 4 -MW indirect gasifier is used to exemplify the findings. The experimental investigation shows that char segregation strongly decreases as the excess velocity is increased over a certain threshold. The larger the char particle, the higher is the threshold fluidization velocity above which the char particle becomes immersed in the dense bed. The model shows that the degree of char conversion in the gasification chamber of an indirect gasifier decreases strongly as the fluidization velocity is increased, due to the decrease in the fuel residence time caused by enhanced lateral mixing. Neglecting the effect of <b>fuel</b> axial <b>mixing</b> on the gasification rate results in modelled char conversion degrees up to 1. 3 times higher than when axial mixing is accounted for. This impact of <b>fuel</b> axial <b>mixing</b> increases with the solids cross-flow.
