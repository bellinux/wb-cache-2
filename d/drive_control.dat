25|$|Service on the Yonge route {{would be}} handled by new rolling stock, and the TTC was {{particularly}} interested in the Chicago series 6000 cars, which used trucks, wheels, motors, and <b>drive</b> <b>control</b> technologies that had been developed and perfected on PCC streetcars. However, the United States {{was in the midst of}} the Korean War at the time, which had caused a substantial increase in metal prices, thus making the PCC cars too expensive. Instead, in November 1951, an order was placed with the Gloucester Railway Carriage and Wagon Company in England for 104 cars for $7,800,000 including spare parts.|$|E
500|$|In variable-torque {{applications}} {{suited for}} Volts-per-Hertz (V/Hz) <b>drive</b> <b>control,</b> AC motor characteristics {{require that the}} voltage magnitude of the inverter's output to the motor be adjusted to match the required load torque in a linear V/Hz relationship. For example, for 460V, 60Hz motors, this linear V/Hz relationship is [...] 460/60 = 7.67V/Hz. While suitable in wide-ranging applications, V/Hz control is sub-optimal in high-performance applications involving low speed or demanding, dynamic speed regulation, positioning, and reversing load requirements. Some V/Hz control drives can also operate in quadratic V/Hz mode or can even be programmed to suit special multi-point V/Hz paths.|$|E

2500|$|In May 2013 {{there was}} a recall of WKs with the Quadra-Drive II and Quadra-Trac II systems. This {{followed}} cases of cars rolling away due the transfer case moving into neutral of its own accord, and the owner not having applied the parking brake. The recall revised the Final <b>Drive</b> <b>Control</b> Module (FDCM) software. However, following the recall there were widespread reports on enthusiast web sites [...] of both the neutral and low ratio modes of the transfer case ceasing to function, and a survey showed that fewer than 10% of respondents had experienced no issues with the recall. Attempting to resolve these issues, some dealers subsequently replaced the transfer case actuator, FDCM, and even the transfer case itself, often at customer expense and usually to no avail.|$|E

40|$|Main {{purpose of}} the paper is to present high-response {{hydraulic}} linear <b>drive,</b> which is <b>controlled</b> with new digital piezo valve and where the new position transducer is integrated {{as a part of}} hydraulic cylinder. Hydraulic digital piezo valve with main static and dynamic characteristics as well as its functionality is presented in detail. The main static and dynamic characteristics of dygital piezo valve which influence directly on the linear drive performance are high resolution of the volume flow rate and high resposne of the valve. Beside valve characteristics the new integrated position transducer, the digital controller and control method, presented in the paper, have major impact on linear drive preformance. At the end of the paper the step response and position resolution of the hydraulic linear <b>drive</b> <b>controlled</b> with the new digital valve is compared with the results of reference hydraulic <b>drive</b> <b>controlled</b> with high response proportional valve...|$|R

40|$|Classical {{control charts}} for {{monitoring}} the mean {{are based on}} the assumption of normality. When normality fails, these control charts are no longer valid and serious errors often arise. Data <b>driven</b> <b>control</b> charts, which choose between the normal chart, a parametric one and a nonparametric chart, have recently been proposed to solve the problem. They also correct for estimation errors due to estimation of the parameters involved or, in the nonparametric chart, for estimation of the appropriate quantiles of the distribution. In many cases these data <b>driven</b> <b>control</b> charts are performing very well. However, when the data point towards the nonparametric chart no satisfactory solution is obtained unless the number of Phase I observations is very large. The problem is that accurate estimation of an extreme quantile in a nonparametric way needs a huge number of observations. Replacing the nonparametric individual chart by a nonparametric chart for grouped observations does the job. These improved data <b>driven</b> <b>control</b> charts are presented here. Ready-made formulas are given, which make implementation of the charts quite straightforward. An application on real data clearly shows the improvement: estimation of extreme quantiles is replaced by estimation of ordinary quantiles, which can be done in an accurate way for common sample sizes...|$|R
