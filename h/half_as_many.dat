5|$|The Eurasian {{nuthatch}} (Sitta europaea) {{is a small}} passerine bird {{found throughout}} temperate Asia and in Europe.

This article follows the 2013 Handbook of the Birds of the World Alive treatment, which has more recognised forms than the 1996 Tits, Nuthatches and Treecreepers.

But, only one game, the finale against the Pittsburgh Steelers, attracted a larger crowd than could have been accommodated at Vanderbilt. Although 50,677 people showed up, the crowd appeared to be composed of at least <b>half,</b> and <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> three-fourths, Steeler fans.

25|$|Holistic and {{interdisciplinary}} {{approaches to}} the study of human disease have revealed a reciprocal relationship between humans and parasites.

Infectious diseases can be either chronic or acute, and epidemic or endemic, impacting the population in any given community to different extents. Thus, human-mediated disturbance can either increase or decrease species diversity in a landscape, causing a corresponding change in pathogenic diversity.|$|E
