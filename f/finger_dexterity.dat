25|$|For many {{children}} with CP, parents are {{heavily involved in}} self-care activities. Self-care activities, such as bathing, dressing, grooming, can be difficult for children with CP as self-care depends primarily on use of the upper limbs. For those living with CP, impaired upper limb function affects almost 50% of children and is considered the main factor contributing to decreased activity and participation. As the hands are used for many self-care tasks, sensory and motor impairments of the hands make daily self-care more difficult. Motor impairments cause more problems than sensory impairments. The most common impairment is that of <b>finger</b> <b>dexterity,</b> which {{is the ability to}} manipulate small objects with the fingers.

40|$|Background: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the impact of task oriented physical activity to improve hand motor control in stroke patients by comparing with motor learning and motor strategy. Methods: A total of 20 patients who are post-stroke patients suffered a left brain hemisphere were recruited for the study.

Results: In the experimental group the mean performance time of all tasks for wrist, hand and lift of toys improved significantly (p< 5) and no decline in quality of arm function was observed. In control group, the mean performance time of five patients is not improved significantly (p< 5) and the lift of toys and the quality of arm function was not significantly improved.

40|$|With the {{increase}} {{number of companies}} focusing on commercializing Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR) and wearable devices, {{the need for a}} hand based input mechanism is becoming essential {{in order to make the}} experience natural, seamless and immersive. Hand pose estimation has progressed drastically in recent years due to the introduction of commodity depth cameras. Hand pose estimation based on vision is still a challenging problem due to its complexity from self-occlusion (between fingers), close similarity between <b>fingers,</b> <b>dexterity</b> of the hands, speed of the pose and the high dimension of the hand kinematic parameters. Articulated hand pose estimation is still an open problem and under intensive research from both academia and industry. The 2 approaches used for hand pose estimation are: discriminative and generative. Generative approach is a model based that tries to fit a hand model to the observed data. Discriminative approach is appearance based, usually implemented with machine learning (ML) and require a large amount of training data. Recent hand pose estimation uses hybrid approach by combining both discriminative and generative methods into a single hand pipeline. In this paper, we focus on reviewing recent progress of hand pose estimation from depth sensor. We will survey discriminative methods, generative methods and hybrid methods.

40|$|Background: Charcot Marie Tooth type 1 a (CMT 1 a) is a {{primarily}} demyelinating neuropathy, {{characterized by}} slowly progressive muscle weakness, atrophy, and sensory loss, and is most pronounced in both feet and hands. There is increasing evidence that muscle weakness {{is determined by}} motor axonal dysfunction. Objective: To investigate in patients with CMT 1 a whether motor axon loss, as estimated with motor unit number estimation (MUNE) and compound muscle action potential (CMAP), is related to hand function and manual dexterity. Methods: Hand function, manual dexterity, and axon loss were studied in 48 patients with proven CMT 1 a. Using high-density surface EMG on the thenar muscles, MUNE was determined and CMAPs were measured. Results: Pinch strength, clawing of the <b>fingers,</b> and manual <b>dexterity</b> correlated significantly with MUNE and CMAP (amplitude and area), while sensory impairments did not. Grip strength correlated significantly with CMAP amplitude but did not become significant with MUNE and CMAP area.

Conclusions: Motor axon loss {{is likely to be}} the major cause of hand dysfunction and impaired manual dexterity in Charcot Marie Tooth type 1 a (CMT 1 a).

But I must say that I have never heard such a pianist before...First, he does not play at all in the style you and I strive for. And just as I did not judge him on that basis, I imagine that when you hear him, you too will be compelled to ignore all matters of principle, and probably will end up doing just as I did. For your principles would not be the proper standard to apply. What he plays is expression in the older sense of the word, nothing else; but such power of expression I have never heard before. You will disagree with his tempis as much as I did. You will also note that he often seems to give primacy to sharp contrasts at the expense of form, the latter appearing to get lost. I say appearing to; for then, in its own way, his music surprisingly regains its form, makes sense, establishes its own boundaries. The sound he brings out of the piano is unheard of, or at least I have never heard anything like it. He himself seems not to know how he produces these novel and quite incredible sounds - although he appears to be a man of intelligence and not just some flaccid dreamer. And such fullness of tone, achieved without ever becoming rough, I have never before encountered. For me, and probably for you too, it's really too much fullness, but as a whole it displays incredible novelty and persuasiveness. And above all he's only 33 years old, so he's still got several stages of development before him, from which one may expect great things, given his point of departure... it is amazing what he plays and how he plays it.

40|$|Background One of {{the main}} {{problems}} of chronic stroke patients is the inability to move the fingers separately despite the passing of {{an extended period of}} time since the onset of the disease. Dexterity is a fine motor skill that allows one to manipulate objects through voluntary movement. Objectives The aim of this study was to compare the fine motor skills of patients with chronic stroke to those of healthy controls. Patients and Methods This analytic and descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out randomly on 50 patients with chronic stroke with a mean age of 57. 8 years suffering for 46 - 72 months and on 50 healthy people with a mean age of 51. 16 years. Patients did not receive any intervention before or after one week of assessment. The function of both hands of each patient was measured with the nine-holepegtest (NHPT) and the box and block test (BBT). Results The results showed that the mean variation of speed in the BBT test (standard deviation [SD]) in the left hands of the patients (recessive limb) was 57. 8 (12. 75), greater than in their right hand (dominant limb) (54. 76 [8. 67]). The rate of speed in healthy people’s right hands was 68. 58 (8. 31), greater than in their left hands (63. 5 [8. 54]). In addition, the results of the NHPT showed that the stroke patients needed more time to manipulate the objects than the healthy ones. For the NHPT, the mean (SD) of the right hand (dominant limb) patients (4. 89) and healthy controls 36. 7 (14. 5) 21. 98, mean (SD) of the left hand (dominant limb) patients (4. 45) and 30. 4 in healthy subjects (4. 09) 24. 18 respectively.
