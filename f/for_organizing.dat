The 19th century saw a large {{increase in the number}} of chiefs of police, reaching sixteen by the middle of the century.

From 1859 the municipalities would finance the wages of the deputies and constables, which made it difficult for the police to use those forces outside the municipal borders. The first organized education of police officers started in Christiania in 1889.|$|E
