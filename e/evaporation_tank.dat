Comparisons were made between numerous evaporation tanks (pans) and a 20 m(2) <b>evaporation</b> <b>tank.</b> Based on 6 years of evaporation data collected at Nansihu Lake Evaporation Station in Shandong Province, China, the following {{results have been}} obtained. First, {{conversion coefficients}} varied according to the evaporator type. The average yearly conversion coefficient was only 0. 60 for phi 20 evaporator (an evaporation pan with a diameter of 20 cm), whereas it was about 1. 07 for the E 601 's pan, whose rim was about 7. 5 cm above ground. Second, the conversion coefficient changes within a year had the same pattern among the evaporators evaluated. The monthly conversion coefficients had the minimum values in March or April, then increased with time, and reached their maximum values in August or September. After September, the conversion coefficients varied in different directions with time. Third, the conversion coefficients changed from year to year, but their variations between maximum and minimum values were between 0. 06 and 0. 16. Fourth, the installation modes, structures, and composition of the evaporators affected the evaporation amount. Fifth, the conversion coefficients at Nansihu and Yucheng stations for the same evaporator did not show a distinct difference. The E 601 evaporator has almost the same conversion coefficients at six of seven stations spanning almost 20 degrees in latitude from northern to southern China. Sixth, the yearly evaporation from a 100 m(2) <b>evaporation</b> <b>tank</b> was almost {{the same as that}} from the 20 m(2) evaporation tanks; however, the differences still existed in any given month.

White colored materials were found to satisfy the requirement that both these parameters be as large as possible. Experiments were conducted using covers of foamed wax, lightweight concrete, white butyl rubber, and styrofoam. A variety of shapes and sizes were tested. Cover radiative properties were again noted to be most important, and thin covers proved to be slightly more efficient than thick insulated covers of the same size. Evaporation reduction was found to be proportional to the percent of surface area covered, the constant of proportionality depending upon the color and type of material used. For the white, impermeable materials tested, the constant of proportionality was near unity. It was also noted that reduction in evaporation and reduction in net radiation, as compared to an open tank, were highly correlated. Evaluation of two Dalton-type expressions, the Bowen ratio method and the combination method, for predicting evaporation from an open water surface, showed the combination method to be better under conditions of this experiment. Based on this finding, a modified combination method was derived. This modified equation proved valid for predicting evaporation from a partially covered body of water.

The studied factors were four irrigation sheets, based on the <b>evaporation</b> of <b>tank</b> class "A" (30, 60, 90 and 120 % of the <b>evaporation</b> of the <b>tank)</b> and four salinity levels in the irrigation water (0, 1; 5, 0; 10, 0 and 15, 0 dS. m- 1). The experimental design was entirely random with subdivided portions and regression analysis with answer surface. The number of feminine flowers grows with the increment of the irrigation amount, reducing the negative effect of the applied saline levels. The relationship flower / picked fruit reduces with the increase of the saline levels, while the interaction of the largest irrigation sheets with the smallest saline levels results in a growth in the number of flowers emitted by picked fruits. The production in biomass of the fruits grows positively with the increase of the irrigation sheets and it reduces with the increase of the saline levels and the interaction of the smaller saline levels with the largest irrigation sheets produce the largest weights of registered fruits.

ECC utilizes a more dilute OA solution (2 wt%) and an oxalate destruction technology using ozonolysis with or without the application of ultraviolet (UV) light. SRNL conducted tests of the ECC process using actual SRS waste material from Tanks 5 F and 12 H.

40|$|This report uses readily {{available}} historical information to better define the volume, chemical composition, and Cs- 137 /Sr- 90 amounts for leaks {{that have occurred}} in the past for tanks SX- 108, SX- 109, SX- 111, and SX- 112. In particular a Historical Leak Model (HLM) is developed that is a month by month reconciliation of tank levels, fill records, and calculated boil-off rates for these tanks. The HLM analysis is an independent leak estimate that reconstructs the tank thermal histories thereby deriving each tank`s evaporative volume loss and by difference, its unaccounted losses as well. The HLM analysis was meant to demonstrate the viability of its approach, not necessarily to establish the HLM leak estimates as being definitive. Past leak estimates for these tanks have invariably resorted to soil wetting arguments but the extent of soil contaminated by each leak has always been highly uncertain. There is also a great deal of uncertainty with the HLM that was not quantified in this report, but will be addressed later. These four tanks (among others) were used from 1956 to 1975 for storage of high-level waste from the Redox process at Hanford. During their operation, tank waste temperatures were often as high as 150 C (300 F), but were more typically around 130 C. The primary tank cooling was by <b>evaporation</b> of <b>tank</b> waste and therefore periodic replacement of lost volume with water was necessary to maintain each tank`s inventory. This active reflux of waste resulted in very substantial turnovers in tank inventory as well as significant structural degradation of these tanks. As a result of the loss of structural integrity, each of these tanks leaked during their active periods of operation. Unfortunately, the large turnover in tank volume associated with their reflux cooling has made a determination of leak volumes very difficult. During much of these tanks operational histories, inventory losses because of evaporative cooling could have effectively masked any volume loss due to leak. However, careful comparison with reported tank levels during certain periods clearly show unaccounted volume losses for many tanks. As a result of the HLM analysis, SX- 108, SX- 109, SX- 111, and SX- 112 all show clear evidence of unaccounted volume losses during the period 1958 to 1975. Likewise, the HLM does not show similar unaccounted volume losses for tank SX- 105, a tank with no reported leak history, verifying that the HLM is consistent with SX- 105 not leaking. These unaccounted volume losses establish the leak start date and rate, and when propagated over time show that SX- 108 lost 203 kgal followed by SX- 109 at 111. SX- 111 at 55, and SX- 112 at 44 kgal. 0664 These leak volumes represent maximum or upper bounds estimates of each leak and are in total volume about six times the previous leak estimates...|$|R

During the startup of W- 030 system, the ventilation system will be operating in bypass mode. In bypass made of operation, the system is capable of supplying 1000 cfm total flow for all four AWF doubleshell tanks. The design of the W- 030 system {{is based on the}} assumption that both the recirculation loop of the primary ventilation system and the secondary ventilation which provides cooling would be operating. However, during the startup neither the recirculation system nor the secondary ventilation system will be operating. A minimum flow of 100 cfm is required to prevent any flammable gas associated risk. The remaining 600 cfm flow can be divided among the four tanks as necessary to keep the peak sludge temperatures below the operating temperature limit. For the purpose of determining the minimum flow required for cooling each tank, the thermal hydraulic analysis is performed to predict the peak sludge temperatures in AY/AZ tanks under different ventilation flows. The heat load for AZ farm tanks is taken from characterization reports and for the AY farm tanks, the heat load was estimated by thermal analysis using the measured waste temperatures and the waste liquid <b>evaporation</b> rates. The <b>tank</b> 241 -AZ- 101 and the tank 241 -AZ- 102 have heat loads of 241, 600 and 199, 500 Btu/hr respectively. The tank 241 -AY- 101 and tank 241 -AY- 102 have heat loads of 41, 000 and 33, 000 Btu/hr respectively. Using the ambient meteorological conditions of temperature and relative humidity for the air and tank, some soil surface and the sludge levels reported in recent documents, the peak sludge and supernatant temperatures were predicted for various primary ventilation flows ranging from 100 to 400 cfm for AZ tanks and 100 and 150 cfm for AY tanks.

40|$|Open filters (with low {{pressure}} drop) have potential for energy efficient reduction of particulate matter (PM) from internal combustion engines {{and for some}} applications, open substrates may even suffice. However, the PM from internal combustion engines is prone to changes (via changes in gas composition and temperature) and it is therefore very challenging to characterize. The modelling of these systems is also challenging due to the variability in size-dependent heterogeneous properties. The capture efficiency of PM in open substrates (bare cordierite and alumina-coated cordierite monoliths) has been investigated using PM from a real engine under various flow conditions (varying residence times and temperatures) and sampling settings (dilution ratios) using a DMS 500 from Cambustion [1]. However, the capture efficiency was affected by removal of volatiles (hydrocarbons) influencing both size and numbers. In order to quantify these effects, a conceptual model has been implemented {{that can be used}} as an in-situ analyser of the PM properties. By applying sigmoidal functions to describe the distribution between pure solids (soot) and semi volatiles (soot cores with HC outer shell), an empirical but physically sound model was achieved. The number of parameters was relatively low (8 parameters) but experimental data was not very rich and a significant parameter correlation was observed. The results show how exhaust treatment (heating and/or dilution) changes the characteristics of the PM and how the model could be used to describe the experiments [...] In the current work, modelling issues are described. The capture efficiency is modelled as one single channel, discretized using tanks-in-series. In each <b>tank,</b> <b>evaporation</b> of hydrocarbons makes the particles shrink, which affects the diffusivity and hence the capture to the walls. Furthermore, the methodology for parameter estimation is elaborated, and a user-defined Jacobian is applied to make the optimisation problem more stable. This situation (with many correlated parameters) is also common for heterogeneous catalysis modelling, which makes the methodology interesting also for a wider audience. The obtained HC characteristic is also implemented in CFD simulations where more realistic flow conditions are investigated and the impact of the fast evaporation process is assessed. In the development of more detailed and accurate chemical kinetics for the reactions of diesel and gasoline particulate matter in filters, {{it will be necessary to}} also be able to predict the time-resolved properties of the particles collected in the filter (i. e. reactivity, amount of adsorbed hydrocarbons, etc.). The important implication of this work is therefore that such models can be constructed with the aid of carefully gathered data from experiments on open substrates...|$|R

PorÃm na regiÃo Nordeste hÃ um grande desafio aos produtores e pesquisadores, devido principalmente Ãs temperaturas e evapotranspiraÃÃes elevadas e a baixa pluviosidade. Outro desafio Ã a busca por uma agricultura menos dependente de insumos minerais. Os biofertilizantes apresentam-se como uma importante ferramenta para a produÃÃo vegetal, sendo gerados a partir de produtos naturais obtidos da fermentaÃÃo de materiais orgÃnicos. Em consequÃncia, o objetivo deste trabalho foi de avaliar os efeitos de lÃminas de irrigaÃÃo e doses de biofertilizante bovino de fermentaÃÃo anaerÃbica, sob ambiente protegido do tipo telado, nas condiÃÃes climÃticas de Fortaleza, CearÃ. Para isso, o experimento foi conduzido na EstaÃÃo AgrometeorolÃgica da Universidade Federal do CearÃ (UFC), em Fortaleza, no perÃodo de setembro a dezembro de 2012, sob ambiente protegido do tipo telado. O delineamento {{experimental}} foi em blocos casualizados em esquema de parcelas subdivididas, em que as lÃminas de irrigaÃÃo foram aplicadas via gotejamento (equivalentes a 33, 3; 66, 6; 100; 133, 3; 166, 6 % da evaporaÃÃo medida no tanque classe A, ECA), constituÃndo as parcelas. As quatro doses de biofertilizante bovino (125; 250; 375 e 500 ml semana-Â planta-Â) foram as subparcelas, com quatro repetiÃÃes. Foram avaliadas as trocas gasosas (fotossÃntese, condutÃncia estomÃtica, transpiraÃÃo e concentraÃÃo interna de CO 2; aos 40 e 110 DAT), a biomassa (matÃria seca da raiz, da parte aÃrea e total), as variÃveis de colheita (diÃmetro, comprimento, nÃmero, massa mÃdia dos frutos e produtividade) e de pÃs-colheita (sÃlido solÃveis totais, pH, acidez titulÃvel e relaÃÃo sÃlido solÃveis/acidez titulÃvel). A dose de 375 mL semana-Â planta-Â apresenta-se como a melhor dosagem para a cultura do morangueiro no litoral cearense. As funÃÃes geradas para a maioria das variÃveis em funÃÃo das lÃminas de irrigaÃÃo foram polinomiais quadrÃticas, sendo as lÃminas Ãtimas prÃximas a 100 % da ECA. A lÃmina de irrigaÃÃo equivalente a 126, 92 % da ECA e a dose de biofertilizante de 375 mL semana-Â planta-Â proporciona o maior desenvolvimento da biomassa. Recomenda-se para uma mÃxima produÃÃo, uma lÃmina de irrigaÃÃo equivalente a 101, 35 % da ECA e uma dose de biofertilizante de 375 mL semana-Â planta-Â. The {{fruit of}} the strawberry (Fragaria x anamassa Duch.) Is enjoyed all over the world, with planting accomplished in several regions, a fact that occurs the existence of cultivars adapted to different climates. But in the Northeast {{there is a big}} challenge for producers and researchers, mainly due to high temperatures and evapotranspiration and low rainfall. Another challenge is the search for a less dependent on mineral inputs agriculture. Biofertilizers are presented as an important tool for crop production, being generated from natural product obtained from the fermentation of organic materials. In consequence, the aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effects of irrigation and levels of bovine biofertilizer anaerobic fermentation under protected environment of the screenhouse type, in the climatic conditions in Fortaleza, CearÃ. For this, the experiment was conducted in weather station at the Federal University of CearÃ, Fortaleza, from August to December 2012, protected under the greenhouse type environment. Experimental design was a randomized complete block in a split-plot design in that the irrigation was applied through drip (equivalent to 33. 3, 66. 6, 100, 133. 3, 166. 6 % of class A <b>evaporation</b> measured in <b>tank,</b> ECA), constituted the main plots. The four levels of cattle biofertilizer (125, 250, 375 and 500 ml plant-Â week-Â) were the subplots with four replications. Were evaluated gas exchange (photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, transpiration, and internal CO 2 concentration; at 40 and 110 DAT), the biomass (dry matter of the roots, shoot and total), the variables of harvest (diameter, length, number,average fruit weight and yield) and postharvest (total soluble solid, pH, titratable acidity and soluble solid ratio / acidity). The dose of 375 mL plant-Â week-Â is presented as the best dosage for strawberry culture in CearÃ. The functions generated for most variables depending on irrigation were quadratic polynomial, with the best irrigation depths near in the 100 % of ECA. The irrigation depths equivalent to 126. 92 % of ECA and bovine biofertilizer dose of 375 mL plant-Â week-Â, provides further development of biomass. It is recommended for maximum production a irrigation depths equivalent to 101. 35 % of ECA and a bovine biofertilizer dose of 375 mL plant-Â week-Â...|$|R
