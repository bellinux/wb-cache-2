50|$|The {{willingness}} of the colonies to take matters to secular courts has also resulted in internal religious disputes being brought before the court. Two of these cases have come by appeal before the Supreme Court of Canada: Hofer v. Hofer (1970) and Lakeside Colony of Hutterian Brethren v. Hofer (1992).Hofer v. Hofer involved several expelled members of the Interlake Colony in Manitoba who sought {{a share of the}} communal property. The Supreme Court of Canada ruled that according to the religious tenets of the Hutterites the Hutterites have no individual property and therefore the former members cannot be entitled to a share of the Hutterite colony goods. In the case of Lakeside Colony of Hutterian Brethren v. Hofer, Daniel Hofer Sr. of Lakeside Colony challenged the right of the Hutterian Brethren Church to expel him and other members. The igniting issue focused on who owned the rights to a patented <b>hog</b> <b>feeder.</b> The Board of Managers of the Colony had ruled that Hofer did not own the patent of the <b>hog</b> <b>feeder</b> in question and should stop producing the item. Hofer refused to submit to what he considered an injustice and also refused to obey the colony's order of expulsion. In response Jacob Kleinsasser of Crystal Spring Colony, elder of the Schmiedleut group of Hutterites, tried to use the state to enforce the expulsion order. Daniel Hofer Sr. initially lost the case. Hofer also lost his first appeal but finally won on an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada who overturned the expulsion.The outcome of these two cases has strongly influenced the outcome of similar cases in Canada. When some members of The Nine sued their former colony in Manitoba in 2008 over lost wages and injuries the case was never even heard in court.|$|E

40|$|The final {{implementation}} of Mandatory Country-of-Origin Labeling has caused some U. S. packing plants and finishing operations to discontinue using Canadian live <b>hogs</b> and <b>feeder</b> pigs in their operations thereby reducing trade. Using {{a system of}} simultaneous equations representing U. S. import demand and U. S. price, this thesis estimates the reduction in trade and any possible price effects in both live <b>hogs</b> and <b>feeder</b> pigs associated with the {{implementation of}} the final rule of Mandatory Country of Origin Labeling in the United States. 	It was found that the implementation of Mandatory Country of Origin Labeling reduced the trade of live hogs between the United States and Canada by 37. 8 percent. The reduction in feeder pigs was 24. 1 percent. It was also found that the implementation of Mandatory Country of Origin Labeling had no effect on the price of both live <b>hogs</b> and <b>feeder</b> pigs in the U. S. market...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} fatten pigs {{economically}} {{it is necessary}} to feed a large amount of concentrates in the form of grain and protein supplements. Corn is the grain usually employed. When the price of corn becomes very high in relation to other feeds, <b>hog</b> <b>feeders</b> look about for a substitute. In recent times corn has been high in price, and occasionally impossible to purchase. This was the situation a year ago when a purchase of Foxtail Millet seed was made to replace corn. With this seed on hand it was thought advisable to carryon a feeding trial to compare it with corn in efficiency, as the state might be in a position sometime to grow considerable millet.

40|$|Country of Origin Labelling (COOL) {{regulation}} {{has been}} applied in the United States meat sector since October 2008. The industry must label beef, lamb and pork (ground meat and muscle cuts) sold through retail outlets according to its country of origin. The labelling requirements create differentiation at the retail level and may impose additional costs on producers, processors and retailers in the U. S. and elsewhere. The purpose of this analysis is to investigate whether there has been structural change in U. S. import demand for Canadian hog/pork products. Given that COOL {{has been in place}} for a limited period of time, we implement statistical procedures that are robust to structural change occurring {{at the end of the}} sample. We find evidence that COOL has impacted U. S. /Canada slaughter hog trade flows. While Canadian <b>feeder</b> <b>hog</b> prices appear to have declined concurrently with the introduction of COOL, statistical hypothesis testing found little evidence of structural change for <b>feeder</b> <b>hog</b> trade flows that could be associated with COOL.

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} effect of {{contract}} provisrons in attracting hedgers to a futures market. The new pork bellies futures contract initiated in 1961 resulted in very light trading during the first 18 months. Six pro-visions of the contract which caused dissatisfaction among traders were those dealing with shrinkage allowance, limitations on storage time, grades and standards, transportation allowance, methods of storage protection, and delivery time. After these provisions were revised in 1962 and 1963 {{in such a way}} as to bring them into closer correspondence with trade practices, hedger utilization increased rapidly and steadily. D URING the past several years, new futures contracts have been es-tablished for many commodities not previously traded on futures exchanges. The apparent success of two of these contracts, the live-beef contract and the frozen-pork-belly contract, has focused attention on the possibilities for successful contracts in other commodities, for example, live <b>hogs,</b> lambs, <b>feeder</b> cattle. Traditionally, most economists have be-lieved that commodities should possess certain inherent characteristics i...|$|R

40|$|A whole-farm {{simulation}} model {{is used to}} analyze the impacts of PST adoption on representative farms in Missouri and Indiana. Farmers who do not adopt experience lower average annual net cash farm incomes than adopters. Lower feed prices and/or an average PST/feed response decrease the incentive to adopt.

40|$|Regression {{analysis}} was used to determine the ability of a number of biological parameters to predict economic efficiency. Detailed feed, financial, and production records were maintained by a random sample of eighteen Prince Edward Island (PEI) swine producers (each producing over 1000 market hogs per year). Relative economic efficiency of the operations was measured using return to management and labor (RML). Of the routinely monitored biological parameters, RML on PEI farrow-finish operations was best predicted (R 2 = 64. 8 %) by: marketed per square meter per year (p = 0. 008) and marketed per sow per year (p = 0. 096). Regression of fixed costs revealed that biological parameters had limited ability to predict fixed costs per hog on farrow-finish operations (R 2 = 30. 7 %). The only parameter contributing to the prediction of the fixed cost component of RML was <b>feeder</b> <b>hog</b> density (p = 0. 077). The variable cost component of RML on farrow-finish operations was predicted (R 2 = 94. 3 %) by feed cost per kg gain (p = 0. 000), and marketed per sow per year (p = 0. 044). The routinely recorded biological parameters on feeder farms had only limited ability to predict RML in this study (R 2 = 43. 7 %). The only parameter of any importance was marketed per square meter per year (p = 0. 106). Prediction of the fixed cost component of RML on feeder farms (R 2 = 67. 4 %) was best realized by measuring <b>feeder</b> <b>hog</b> density (p = 0. 045). The variable cost component of RML on feeder farms was reasonably well predicted (R 2 = 74. 7 %) by feed cost per kg gain (p = 0. 012). Although this parameter is difficult to monitor from records currently maintained on most farms, it points out the need to monitor feed consumption on swine farms.

40|$|The {{information}} {{presented in this}} report represents data collected from farming and ranching operations in the southern two tiers of counties in Nebraska. This study {{was based on a}} random sample of 15 1 southern Nebraska farms that have annually-planted crop acreage. Information was obtained for the 1997 crop year. This data set {{is referred to as the}} MSU/UNL survey data. From the MSU/UNL survey data, the average size of the farming operations in the survey, in 1997, was 1, 3 16 acres. Of these, 856 acres were planted to annual crops, and the remaining 460 acres included 61 acres in fallow, 29 acres in hay, 287 acres in range and pasture, 28 acres in CRP, and 55 acres in other uses. Operation size was largest in the west, due mostly to a large number of range and pasture land acres per operator. Average farm size decreased in the east as range and pasture land acres and acres fallowed per farm both decreased. Acreage planted to annual crops was similar from east to west. Irrigated and dryland grain corn was the predominant crop grown in the survey area. Other major crops included soybeans, sorghum, and winter wheat. An estimated 44 percent of the respondents 2 Ì† 7 cropland acreage was dedicated to corn production. Other annual crops included soybean (21 percent of cropland acreage), sorghum (10 percent of cropland acreage), winter wheat (12 percent of cropland acreage), and minor crops (4 percent of cropland acreage) with most of the remaining cropland in fallow. The distribution of these crops varied across the southern tier of Nebraska counties. Winter wheat was most common in the west and soybean was more prevalent in the east. About 65 percent of total cropland acreage reported was dryland while the remaining 35 percent was irrigated. Significantly more irrigation takes place in the central area. Two-thirds of the operations surveyed reported some type of livestock enterprise. Cattle were the most common type of livestock reported, followed by hogs and sheep. Breeding cattle numbers were greater than feeder cattle numbers. Dairy cattle were rarely reported except in the eastern counties. Producers in the central and eastern counties also reported <b>hog</b> production, with <b>feeder</b> <b>hogs</b> greatly outnumbering breeding animals. Comparisons of acres planted and crop yields from the MSU/UNL survey data to data collected by Nebraska Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), for the same year, show little differences.

40|$|Management {{programs}} aimed at white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) production often {{include the use of}} feeders, either to deliver supplemental feed or bait. However, much of the feed placed into deer feeders is consumed by non-target species, such as feral hogs (Sus scrofa). Our objectives were to compare three exclusion fence designs at deer feeders for their ability to restrict feral hog visitation and enable white-tailed deer visitation. Our high fence design consisted of 86 cm high graduated paneling. Our medium fence design consisted of 76 cm high, 10 Â´ 10 cm paneling. Our low height design consisted of 51 cm high, 10 Â´ 10 cm paneling. We placed deer feeders 3 Ì†e 1. 5 km apart and monitored feeders with motion-sensing digital photography during the summer and winter. We compared the percent change in visitation index by fence design and season. We found feral hog percent change in visitation index varied by treatment, with our low fence design restricting feral hog visitation less than the medium and high fence designs. Given the cost of materials and the effectiveness of the exclusion fences, we recommend using an 86 cm high exclusion fence for feral <b>hogs</b> around deer <b>feeders.</b> However, we caution that our data and recommendations are from short-term seasonal trials...|$|R
