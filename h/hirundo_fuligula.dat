5000|$|The {{rock martin}} was {{formally}} described in 1842 as <b>Hirundo</b> <b>fuligula</b> by German physician, explorer and zoologist Martin Lichtenstein and {{was moved to}} the new genus Ptyonoprogne by German ornithologist Heinrich Gustav Reichenbach in 1850. Its nearest relatives are the three other members of the genus, the pale crag martin, P. obsoleta of north Africa, the dusky crag martin P. concolor of southern Asia and the Eurasian crag martin P. rupestris. The genus name is derived from the Ancient Greek ptuon (πτύον), [...] "a fan", referring to the shape of the opened tail, and Procne (Πρόκνη), a mythological girl who was turned into a swallow. The specific name fuligula means [...] "sooty-throated", from Latin fuligo [...] "soot" [...] and gula [...] "throat".|$|E
