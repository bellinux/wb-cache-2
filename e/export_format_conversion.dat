40|$|Three-dimensional (3 D) {{printing}} is {{a rapidly}} evolving technology with several potential {{applications in the}} diagnosis and management of cardiac disease. Recently, 3 D printing (i. e. rapid prototyping) derived from 3 D transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) has become possible. Due to the multiple steps involved and the specific equipment required for each step, it might be difficult to start implementing echocardiography-derived 3 D printing in a clinical setting. In this review, we {{provide an overview of}} this process, including its logistics and organization of tools and materials, 3 D TEE image acquisition strategies, data <b>export,</b> <b>format</b> <b>conversion,</b> segmentation, and printing. Generation of patient-specific models of cardiac anatomy from echocardiographic data is a feasible, practical application of 3 D printing technology...|$|E

40|$|Prior {{research}} indicates that a scalable video codec based on adaptive <b>format</b> <b>conversion</b> (AFC) information may be ideally suited {{to meet the demands}} of the migration path for high-definition television. Most scalable coding schemes use a single <b>format</b> <b>conversion</b> technique and encode residual information in the enhancement layer. Adaptive <b>format</b> <b>conversion</b> is different in that it employs more than one conversion technique. AFC partitions a video sequence into small blocks and selects the <b>format</b> <b>conversion</b> filter with the best performance in each block. Research shows that the bandwidth required for this type of enhancement information is small, yet the improvement in video quality is significant. This thesis focuses on the migration from 10801 to 1080 P using adaptive deinterlacing. Two main questions are answered. First, how does adaptive <b>format</b> <b>conversion</b> perform when the base layer video is compressed in a manner typical to high-definition television? It was found that when the interlaced base layer was compressed to 0. 3 bpp, the mean base layer PSNR was 32 dB and the PSNR improvement due to the enhancement layer was as high as 4 dB. Second, what i...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the workshop question: Can data {{generated from the}} infancy of the digital age be ingestible by software today? We have prototyped a set of e-services that serve {{as a framework for}} understanding content preservation, automation and computational requirements on preservation of electronic records. The framework consists of e-services for (a) finding file <b>format</b> <b>conversion</b> software, (b) executing file <b>format</b> <b>conversions</b> using available software, and (c) evaluating information loss across conversions. While the target audience for the technology is the US National Archives, these basic e-services are of interest to any manager of electronic records and to all citizens trying to keep their files current with the rapidly changing information technology. The novelty of the framework is in organizing the information about file <b>format</b> <b>conversions,</b> providing services about file <b>format</b> <b>conversion</b> paths, in prototyping a general architecture for reusing existing third-party software with import/export capabilities, and in evaluating information loss due to file <b>format</b> <b>conversions.</b> The impact of these e-services is in the widely accessible conversion software registry (CSR), conversion engine (Polyglot) and comparison engine (Versus) which can increase the productivity of the digital preservation community and other users of digital files...|$|R

40|$|Scalable coding {{techniques}} {{can be used}} to efficiently provide multicast video service and involve transmitting a single independently coded base layer and one or more depen-dently coded enhancement layers. Clients can decode the base layer bitstream and none, {{some or all of the}} enhancement layer bitstreams to obtain video quality commensurate with their available resources. In many scalable coding algorithms, residual coding infor-mation is the only type of data that is coded in the enhancement layers. However, since the transmitter has access to the original sequence, it can adaptively select different <b>format</b> <b>conversion</b> methods for different regions in an intelligent manner. This adaptive <b>format</b> <b>conversion</b> information can then be transmitted as enhancement data to assist processing at the decoder. The use of adaptive <b>format</b> <b>conversion</b> has not been studied in detail and this thesis examines when and how it can be used for scalable video compression. A new scalable codec is developed in this thesis that can utilize adaptive <b>format</b> <b>conversion</b> information and/or residual coding information as enhancement data.

40|$|We {{investigate}} return-to-zero (RZ) to non-return-to-zero (NRZ) <b>format</b> <b>conversion</b> {{by means}} of the linear time-invariant system theory. It is shown that the problem of converting random RZ stream to NRZ stream can be reduced to constructing an appropriate transfer function for the linear filter. This approach is then used to propose novel optimally-designed single fiber Bragg grating (FBG) filter scheme for RZ-OOK/DPSK/DQPSK to NRZ-OOK/DPSK/DQPSK <b>format</b> <b>conversion.</b> The spectral response of the FBG is designed according to the optical spectra of the algebraic difference between isolated NRZ and RZ pulses, and the filter order is optimized for the maximum Q-factor of the output NRZ signals. Experimental results as well as simulations show that such an optimallydesigned FBG can successfully perform RZ-OOK/DPSK/DQPSK to NRZOOK/ DPSK/DQPSK <b>format</b> <b>conversion...</b>|$|R
