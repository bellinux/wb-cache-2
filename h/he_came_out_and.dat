2500|$|Music {{historian}} Richard Grudens {{writes that}} Kathryn Crosby cheerfully reviewed the chapter about her beloved Bing and his inspiration, Al Jolson[...] [...]where Bing had written, [...] "His chief attribute {{was the sort}} of electricity he generated when he sang. Nobody in those days did that. When <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> started to sing, he just elevated that audience immediately. Within the first eight bars he had them {{in the palm of his}} hand." [...] In Crosby's Pop Chronicles interview, he fondly recalled seeing Jolson perform and praised his [...] "electric delivery".|$|E
2500|$|After [...] "The Fightin' Side of Me" [...] was released, instead, Haggard later commented to the Wall Street Journal, [...] "People are narrow-minded. Down South {{they might}} have called me a nigger lover." [...] In a 2001 interview, Haggard stated that Nelson, who was also head of the country {{division}} at Capitol at the time, never interfered with his music, but [...] "this one time <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> said, 'Merle, I don't believe the world is ready for this yet.' ... And {{he might have been}} right. I might've canceled out where I was headed in my career." ...|$|E

2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of his 66th and final Test in 1996, the two teams – India and England – formed a [...] "guard of honour" [...] as <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> he received a standing ovation from the crowd. Bird, an emotional man, was in tears. [...] His eyes had to clear quickly, though, because two minutes later - and ironically, given his reputation as a [...] "not outer" [...] - he had to give England captain Mike Atherton out LBW in the first over. [...] Two years later, in 1998, he stood in his last county match.|$|E
2500|$|Queer Nation in Houston {{was active}} from the {{beginning}} of 1991 through late 1994. [...] On July 13, 1991, the group held a major demonstration to protest police response to the July 4 gay-bashing murder of Paul Broussard; that demonstration involved between 1200 and 2000 individuals who seized the intersection of Montrose Boulevard and Westheimer Street at the heart of Houston's gay neighborhood. [...] Other actions by the group included a march in the suburban town that was the home of Broussard's killers, seizing the rotunda of Houston City Hall after another murder, protesting the Houston Post's firing of columnist Juan Palomo after <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> protesting discrimination against HIV-positive nurse Brian Bradley. [...] The group also took the lead in organizing LGBT and HIV/AIDS protests at the 1992 Republican National Convention in Houston.|$|E
2500|$|Croll {{chose to}} skip the Preakness Stakes on May 21 and instead entered Holy Bull in the prestigious Metropolitan Handicap, popularly known as the Met Mile, against older horses on May 30. The field {{included}} the 1993 Belmont Stakes winner Colonial Affair, multiple stakes winner Devil His Due and the fast improving Cherokee Run, who {{would go on to}} be named the champion sprinter of 1994. In one of his best performances, Holy Bull quickly took the lead and drew off to win by [...] lengths, earning a Beyer Speed Figure of 122. [...] "I still can't explain the Derby," [...] said Smith. [...] "But today <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> showed what he is, like he always does [...] – except for the first Saturday in May.

2500|$|The {{observation}} that large primates, including especially the great apes, that predominantly move quadrupedally on dry land, tend {{to switch to}} bipedal locomotion in waist deep water, {{has led to the}} idea that the origin of human bipedalism may have been influenced by waterside environments. [...] This idea, labelled [...] "the wading hypothesis", was originally suggested by the Oxford marine biologist Alister Hardy who said: [...] "It seems to me likely that Man learnt to stand erect first in water and then, as his balance improved, he found he became better equipped for standing up on the shore when <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> indeed also for running." [...] It was then promoted by Elaine Morgan, as part of the aquatic ape hypothesis, who cited bipedalism among a cluster of other human traits unique among primates, including voluntary control of breathing, hairlessness and subcutaneous fat. [...] The [...] "aquatic ape hypothesis", as originally formulated, has not been accepted or considered a serious theory within the anthropological scholarly community. Others, however, have sought to promote wading as a factor in the origin of human bipedalism without referring to further ("aquatic ape" [...] related) factors. Since 2000 Carsten Niemitz has published a series of papers and a book on a variant of the wading hypothesis, which he calls the [...] "amphibian generalist theory" [...] (...) [...]|$|E
2500|$|When matters quieted down, Frank Grouard and [...] asked American Horse {{again if}} they {{would come out of}} the hole before any more were shot, telling them they would be safe if they surrendered. “After a few minutes deliberation, the chief, American Horse, a fine looking, broad-chested Sioux, with a {{handsome}} face and a neck like a bull, showed himself {{at the mouth of the}} cave, presenting the butt end of his rifle toward the General. He had just been shot in the abdomen, and said in his native language, that he would yield if the lives of the warriors who fought with him were spared. Chief American Horse had been shot through the bowels and was holding his entrails in his hands as <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> presented the butt end of his rifle to General Crook. [...] Pourier recalled that he first saw American Horse kneeling with a gun in his hand, in a hole on the side of the ravine that he had scooped out with a butcher knife. Two of the squaws were also wounded. [...] Eleven were killed in the hole. Grouard recognized Chief American Horse, “but you would not have thought he was shot from his appearance and his looks, except for the paleness of his face. [...] He came marching out of that death trap as straight as an arrow. [...] Holding out one of his blood-stained hands he shook hands with me.” [...] When Chief American Horse presented the butt end of his rifle, General Crook, who took the proffered rifle, instructed Grouard to ask his name. [...] The Indian replied in Lakota, “American Horse.” [...] Some of the soldiers who lost their comrades in the skirmish shouted, “No quarter!’, but not a man was base enough to attempt shooting down the disabled chief. Crook hesitated for a minute and then said,‘Two or three Sioux, more or less, can make no difference. [...] I can yet use them to good advantage. [...] "Tell the chief,“ he said turning to Grouard, [...] "that neither he nor his young men will be harmed further.” [...] “This message having been interpreted to Chief American Horse, he beckoned to his surviving followers, and two strapping Indians, with their long, but quick and graceful stride, followed him out of the gully. [...] The chieftain’s intestines protruded from his wound, but a squaw, his wife perhaps, tied her shawl around the injured part, and then the poor, fearless savage, never uttering a complaint, walked slowly to a little camp fire, occupied by his people about 20 yards away, and sat down among the women and children.” ...|$|E

50|$|Ivan {{sleeps in}} the shade of a tree then awakens, alerted to the {{presence}} of policemen with rifles.

60|$|Here a new guest had entered; {{and this}} was no other than Mr. Wolfe, who was soberly eating a chicken and salad, with a modest pint of wine. Harry was in high spirits.
