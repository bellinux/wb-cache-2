They dubbed it Pep Auto Supply Company after noticing a shipment of Pep Valve <b>grinding</b> <b>compound</b> on the shelves.|$|E

5000|$|In pharmacology, trituration {{can also}} {{refer to the}} process of <b>grinding</b> one <b>compound</b> into another to dilute one of the ingredients, add volume for {{processing}} and handling, or to mask undesirable qualities. For example, the amount of hormone in a dose of Levonorgestrel formulated as a progestogen-only contraceptive is only 30µg, which is far too small to handle. In a typical product, the drug is triturated with c. 1700 times its mass of sugar before being compressed and coated to produce the final tablet.|$|R
40|$|Two new cocrystals of {{theophylline}} {{were prepared}} by liquid assisted <b>grinding.</b> While <b>compound</b> 1 (theophylline: 4 -aminosalicylic acid 2 : 1) {{was characterized by}} single crystal X-ray diffraction, the crystal structure of compound 2 (theophylline: 4 -aminobenzoic acid 1 : 1) was determined by combining X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), solid-state NMR and DFT calculations. The use of 1 D/ 2 D 1 H high-resolution solid-state NMR techniques provided structural insight on local length scales revealing internuclear proximities and relative orientations between {{the building blocks of}} compound 2, thus providing information on the type of hydrogen bond synthons formed. DFT calculations were also employed to generate meaningful structures and calculate NMR 1 H and 13 C chemical shifts to further validate the XRPD model. Compound 2 shows an unusual structure, in which the amino groups do not participate in hydrogen bonds, while compound 1 exhibits an extended hydrogen-bonding network, in which planar subunits can be recognized...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In cement industry, many {{grinding}} up systems are on operating now. The tradition process of tube mill grinding system is high energy consumption, so it’s low efficiency, {{especially in the}} final cement grinding process. The value and advantage of slag is recognized more and more, but it’s difficult to be grinded up. Furthermore, the disadvantage and shortages to <b>grind</b> up clinker <b>compounded</b> with slag to produce cement are obvious and adopted. The best process is to grind up slag, clinker separately. Then, these two kinds of powder are compounded by a mixer. Hereby, it introduces a design of the process to grind up clinker, slag by one roller mill. ...|$|R
5|$|Carbon {{black is}} used as the black pigment in {{printing}} ink, artist's oil paint and water colours, carbon paper, automotive finishes, India ink and laser printer toner. Carbon black is also used as a filler in rubber products such as tyres and in plastic compounds. Activated charcoal {{is used as}} an absorbent and adsorbent in filter material in applications as diverse as gas masks, water purification, and kitchen extractor hoods, and in medicine to absorb toxins, poisons, or gases from the digestive system. Carbon is used in chemical reduction at high temperatures. Coke is used to reduce iron ore into iron (smelting). Case hardening of steel is achieved by heating finished steel components in carbon powder. Carbides of silicon, tungsten, boron and titanium, are among the hardest known materials, and are used as abrasives in cutting and <b>grinding</b> tools. Carbon <b>compounds</b> make {{up most of the}} materials used in clothing, such as natural and synthetic textiles and leather, and almost all of the interior surfaces in the built environment other than glass, stone and metal.|$|R
40|$|German Federation of Materials Science and Engineering (BV MatWerk); German Research Foundation (DFG); National Natural Science Foundation of China (Microscale <b>grinding</b> and micromilling-grinding <b>compound</b> {{machining}} process) [52075064]The {{influence of}} polymer wrapped two neighbouring single-walled nanotubes' (SWNTs) dispersion on their load transfer is investigated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The {{influence of the}} SWNTs' position, the polymer chain length and the temperature on the interaction force between the two neighbouring SWNTs are systematically studied. There are four main findings from our simulations: (I) The dispersion angle dominates the amplitude and the interaction force evolution with or without polymer during the pulling process of two SWNTs. (2) The chain length {{does not affect the}} two SWNTs' interaction force within a short separation distance, the so called "Force enhancing point". The enhanced load effect of the polymer takes place after the load displacement goes across this point. (3) The temperature has a minor influence on the maximum pull force, while the increased temperature greatly decreases the pullout energy. (4) Based on the detailed analysis of the separation process, the self-repairing function of the system is found. The present results provide a guidance for understanding the load transfer of SWNT dispersion in phononic devices. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
