Part of this reservoir still exists near the racecourse, but it no longer contains water. Some of this hydrologic work was used to feed factories in the valley. The gardens that remain were watered by a completely different system based on an aqueduct coming from the area around Senlis.In the 18th century a mineral water source was discovered in the valley and a garden pavilion was built between 1725 and 1728 to allow the public to come drink from it.

40|$|A {{pilot study}} has been {{performed}} to ascertain the baseline hydrochemistry of both shallow (springs) and deep (borehole) groundwaters of the Millstone Grit and Coal Measures. In terms of major ion composition {{the majority of the}} shallow groundwaters in the two formations are rather similar (typically Ca/Mg-SO 42 -/HCO 3 -). The deep groundwaters show more variability. In some boreholes, marked seasonal temperature fluctuations and chemical compositions similar to shallow groundwaters indicate short residence times. In contrast, several boreholes inthe Coal Measures indicate highly reducing conditions, evidenced by sulphate reduction and spectacular methane xsolution at two sites in Sheffield. Some deep Coal Measures groundwaters show elevated chloride concentrations compared with shallow waters, which may indicate the influ-ence of deep formation brines, while others yield sodium bicarbonate waters indicative of cation exchange. At the other extreme, highly oxidizing conditions, e. g. in broken ground at the Mare Tor landslip, promote pyrite oxidation and yield acidic, <b>ferruginous</b> <b>waters</b> with high contents of heavy metals including uranium and thorium.

40|$|Precambrian Banded Iron Formation (BIF) {{deposition}} was conventionally {{attributed to}} the precipitation of iron-oxides resulting from the abiotic reaction of ferrous iron (Fe(II)) with photosynthetically-produced oxygen. Earliest traces of oxygen date from 2. 7 Ga, thus raising questions as to what may have caused BIF precipitation before oxygenic photosynthesis evolved. The discovery of anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria thriving through the oxidation of Fe(II) has provided support for a biological origin for some BIFs, but despite reports suggesting that anoxygenic phototrophs may oxidize Fe(II) in the environment, a model ecosystem of an ancient ocean where they are demonstrably active was lacking. Here we show that anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria contribute to Fe(II) oxidation {{in the water column}} of the ferruginous sulfate-poor, meromictic lake La Cruz (Spain). We observed in-situ photoferrotrophic activity through stimulation of phototrophic carbon uptake in the presence of Fe(II), and determined light-dependent Fe(II) -oxidation by the natural chemocline microbiota. Moreover, a photoferrotrophic bacterium most closely related to Chlorobium ferrooxidans was enriched from the <b>ferruginous</b> <b>water</b> column. Our study for the first time demonstrates a direct link between anoxygenic photoferrotrophy and the anoxic precipitation of Fe(III) -oxides in a <b>ferruginous</b> <b>water</b> column, providing a plausible mechanism for the bacterial origin of BIF’s before the advent of free oxygen...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of complex decision support model {{systems for the}} analysis of regional water policies for regions with intense socio-economic development effecting and being affected by the water resources system is of increasing importance. One of the most illustrative examples are regions with open-pit lignite mining. Such model systems have to be based on appropriate submodels e. g. for water quality processes. The paper describes submodel for groundwater and surface water quality with special regard to open-pit lignite mining regions. We consider the discharge of acid <b>ferruginous</b> <b>water</b> into rivers as having the most important impact on water quality in open-pit lignite mining areas. One goal of the model system is the choice of the necessary degree of purification for mine water treatment plants, taking into account self-purification in rivers and remaining pits as well as the water quality demand of down-stream water users. Based on comprehensive water quality models, the {{development of}} which is described in the paper, the possibilities for the derivation of reduced models are described. Those model have been elaborated for groundwater, as the source of pollution, mine water treatment plants as control units, river sections with an intake of acid <b>ferruginous</b> <b>water,</b> and remaining pits, which can also serve as effective control units. Related with each other, these models form the complex system model, a system of differential equations. They were numerically solved. The computer program is included in the paper...|$|E

The heat is delivered to a water-based thermal store providing central heating for apartment complexes and contributing to domestic hot water. It is demonstrated, via hydrochemical analysis and speciation modelling of the Fife minewater, {{that the success of}} the schemes is due to lack of contact between minewater and the atmosphere (thus limiting degassing of CO 2 and absorption of O 2).

40|$|Iron-rich (ferruginous) ocean {{chemistry}} prevailed {{throughout most}} of Earth’s early history. Before the evolution and proliferation of oxygenic photosynthesis, biological production in the ferruginous oceans was likely driven by photoferrotrophic bacteria that oxidize ferrous iron {Fe(II) } to harness energy from sunlight, and fix inorganic carbon into biomass. Photoferrotrophs may thus have fuelled Earth’s early biosphere providing energy to drive microbial growth and evolution over billions of years. Yet, photoferrotrophic activity has remained largely elusive on the modern Earth, leaving models for early biological production untested and imperative ecological context {{for the evolution of}} life missing. Here, we show that an active community of pelagic photoferrotrophs comprises up to 30 % of the total microbial community in illuminated <b>ferruginous</b> <b>waters</b> of Kabuno Bay (KB), East Africa (DR Congo). These photoferrotrophs produce oxidized iron {Fe(III) } and biomass, and support a diverse pelagic microbial community including heterotrophic Fe(III) -reducers, sulfate reducers, fermenters and methanogens. At modest light levels, rates of photoferrotrophy in KB exceed those predicted for early Earth primary production, and are sufficient to generate Earth’s largest sedimentary iron ore deposits. Fe cycling, however, is efficient, and complex microbial community interactions likely regulate Fe(III) and organic matter export from the photic zon...|$|R
40|$|Eukaryotic life {{expanded}} {{during the}} Proterozoic eon 1, 2. 5 to 0. 542 billion years ago, {{against a background}} of fluctuating ocean chemistry 2 - 4. After about 1. 8 billion years ago, the global ocean is thought to have been characterized by oxygenated surface waters, with anoxic and sulphidic waters in middle depths along productive continental margins and anoxic and iron-containing (<b>ferruginous)</b> deeper <b>waters</b> 5 - 7. The spatial extent of sulphidic waters probably varied through time 5, 6, but this surface-to-deep redox structure is suggested to have persisted until the first Neoproterozoic glaciation about 717 million years ago 8 - 11. Here we report an analysis of ocean redox conditions throughout the Proterozoic using new and existing iron speciation and sulphur isotope data from multiple cores and outcrops. We find a global transition from sulphidic to <b>ferruginous</b> mid-depth <b>waters</b> in the earliest Neoproterozoic, coincident with the amalgamation of the supercontinent Rodinia at low latitudes. We suggest that ferruginous conditions were initiated by an increase in the oceanic influx of highly reactive iron relative to sulphate, driven by a change in weathering regime and the uptake of sulphate by extensive continental evaporites on Rodinia. We proposethat this transition essentially detoxified oceanmargin settings, allowing for expanded opportunities for eukaryote diversification followingaprolonged evolutionary stasis before one billion years ago...|$|R
40|$|The ca. 1. 8 Ga Duck Creek Formation, Western Australia, {{preserves}} 1000 m of carbonates {{and minor}} iron formation that accumulated along a late Paleoproterozoic ocean margin. Two upward-deepening stratigraphic packages are preserved, each characterized by peritidal precipitates {{at the base}} and iron formation and carbonate turbidites in its upper part. Consistent with recent studies of Neoarchean basins, carbon isotope ratios of Duck Creek carbonates show no evidence for a strong isotopic depth gradient, but carbonate minerals in iron formations can be markedly depleted in ^(13) C. In contrast, oxygen isotopes covary strongly with depth; δ^(18) O values as positive as 2 ‰ VPDB in peritidal facies systematically decline to values of − 6 to − 16 ‰ in basinal rocks, reflecting, we posit, the timing of diagenetic closure. The Duck Creek Formation contains microfossils {{similar to those of}} the Gunflint Formation, Canada; they are restricted to early diagenetic cherts developed in basinal facies, strengthening the hypothesis that such fossils capture communities driven by iron metabolism. Indeed, X-ray diffraction data indicate that the Duck Creek basin was ferruginous throughout its history. The persistence of <b>ferruginous</b> <b>waters</b> and iron formation deposition in Western Australia for at least several tens of millions of years after the transition to sulfidic conditions in Laurentia suggests that the late Paleoproterozoic expansion of sulfidic subsurface waters was globally asynchronous. ...|$|R
40|$|This study explores Mn {{biogeochemistry}} in a stratified, ferruginous lake, {{a modern}} analogue to ferruginous oceans. Intense Mn cycling {{occurs in the}} chemocline where Mn is recycled at least 15 times before sedimentation. The product of biologically catalyzed Mn oxidation in Lake Matano is birnessite. Although there is evidence for abiotic Mn reduction with Fe(II), Mn reduction likely occurs {{through a variety of}} pathways. The flux of Fe(II) is insufficient to balance the reduction of Mn at 125 m depth in the water column, and Mn reduction could be a significant contributor to CH 4 oxidation. By combining results from synchrotron-based X-ray fluorescence and X-ray spectroscopy, extractions of sinking particles, and reaction transport modeling, we find the kinetics of Mn reduction in the lake's reducing waters are sufficiently rapid to preclude the deposition of Mn oxides from the water column to the sediments underlying <b>ferruginous</b> <b>water.</b> This has strong implications for the interpretation of the sedimentary Mn record...|$|E
40|$|A {{significant}} body {{of evidence}} suggests that the marine environment remained largely anoxic throughout most of the Precambrian. In contrast, the oxygenation history of terrestrial aquatic environments has received little attention, despite the significance of such settings for early eukaryote evolution. To address this, we provide here a geochemical and isotopic assessment of sediments from the late Mesoproterozoic Nonesuch Formation of central North America. We utilize rhenium-osmium (Re-Os) geochronology to yield a depositional age of 1078 ± 24 Ma, while Os isotope compositions support existing evidence for a lacustrine setting. Fe-S-C systematics suggest that the Nonesuch Formation was deposited from an anoxic Fe-rich (<b>ferruginous)</b> <b>water</b> column. Thus, similar to the marine realm, anoxia persisted in terrestrial aquatic environments in the Middle to Late Proterozoic, but sulfidic water column conditions were not ubiquitous. Our data suggest that oxygenation of the terrestrial realm was not pervasive at this time and may not have preceded oxygenation of the marine environment, signifying a major requirement for further investigation of links between the oxygenation state of terrestrial aquatic environments and eukaryote evolution...|$|E
40|$|The {{rates of}} Fe(II) {{oxidation}} and precipitation from groundwater are highly pH dependent. Elevated levels of dissolved CO 2 can depress pH and cause difficulty in removing dissolved Fe and associated metals during treatment of <b>ferruginous</b> <b>water.</b> This paper demonstrates interdependent changes in pH, dissolved inorganic C species, and Fe(II) oxidation rates that occur {{as a result of}} the removal (degassing) of CO 2 during aeration of waters discharged from abandoned coal mines. The results of field monitoring of aeration cascades at a treatment facility as well as batchwise aeration experiments conducted using net alkaline and net acidic waters in the UK are combined with geochemical modelling to demonstrate the spatial and temporal evolution of the discharge water chemistry. The aeration cascades removed approximately 67 % of the dissolved CO 2 initially present but varying the design did not affect the concentration of Fe(II) leaving the treatment ponds. Continued removal of the residual CO 2 by mechanical aeration increased pH by as much as 2 units and resulted in large increases in the rates of Fe(II) {{oxidation and precipitation}}. Effective exsolution of CO 2 led to a reduction in the required lime dose for removal of remaining Fe(II), a very important factor with regard to increasing the sustainability of treatment practices. An important ancillary finding for passive treatment is that varying the design of the cascades had little impact on the rate of CO 2 removal at the flow rates measured...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} major physico-chemical processes {{during the}} passive treatment of ferruginous circumneutral drainage from abandoned coal mines in the UK. Data collected {{over several years}} of studies on mine water treatment systems shed {{new light on the}} relative importance of hydraulics, settling velocity, Fe(II) oxidation rates and cascade aeration, which, in turn, informs the design of future systems. This paper demonstrates that (1) the complex settling behaviour of Fe(III) precipitates may be described by a first-order volumetric process and that settling rate is different for different mine waters; (2) the hydraulic efficiency (ratio of time to peak tracer concentration to nominal residence time) of the settling ponds studied was widely variable at low flow rates in comparison to constructed wetlands; (3) aeration cascades contribute dissolved oxygen and lead to a rise in pH due to CO 2 degassing, which are very important in reducing the required time for iron oxidation and removal; (4) for at least 10 of the 30 sites examined, modelling of the rates of Fe(II) oxidation and particulate settling reveals that removal of iron is primarily dependent on settling rate; and (5) that substantial increases in pH can be brought about by forced aeration of mine water over several hours. Findings of this study apply to the majority of coal mine water treatment sites in the UK and may have broader application to other <b>ferruginous</b> <b>waters</b> with circumneutral pH or after treatment to increase pH...|$|R
40|$|Careful {{evaluation}} of the local geochemical conditions in past marine settings can provide a window to the average redox state of the global ocean during episodes of extensive organic-carbon deposition. These comparisons aid in identifying the interplay between climate and biotic feedbacks contributing to and resulting from these events. Well-documented examples are known from the Mesozoic Era, which is characterized by episodes of widespread organic-carbon deposition known as Oceanic Anoxic Events (OAEs). This organic-carbon burial typically leads to coeval positive carbon-isotope excursions. Geochemical data are presented here for several palaeoredox proxies (Cr/Ti, V, Mo, Zn, Mn, Fe speciation, I/Ca and sulfur isotopes) from a section exposed at Furlo in the Marche–Umbrian Apennines of Italy that spans the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary. Here, OAE 2 is represented by a ~ 1 -m thick radiolarian-rich millimetre-laminated organic-rich shale known locally as the Bonarelli Level. Iron speciation data for thin organic-rich intervals observed below the Bonarelli Level imply a local redox shift going into the OAE, with ferruginous conditions (i. e., anoxic with dissolved ferrous iron) transiently developed prior to the event and euxinia (i. e., anoxic and sulfidic bottom waters) throughout the event itself. Pre-OAE enrichments of elements sensitive to anoxic water columns were due to initial development of locally <b>ferruginous</b> bottom <b>waters</b> as a precursor to the event. However, the greater global expanse of dysoxic to euxinic conditions during the OAE greatly reduced redox-sensitive trace-metal concentrations in seawater. Carbonate I/Ca ratios were generally low, suggesting locally reduced bottom water oxygen conditions preceding the event and relatively increased O 2 concentrations post-event. Combined, the Furlo geochemical data suggest a redox-stratified water column with oxic surface waters and a shallow chemocline overlying locally <b>ferruginous</b> bottom <b>waters</b> preceding the event, globally widespread euxinic bottom waters during the OAE, followed by chemocline shallowing but sustained local redox stratification following the event...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to present data from a novel vertical flow mine water treatment system, demonstrate how these data can be used to generate sizing formulae for this technology, and present a comparison between the size of system based on these formulae and those of conventionally designed passive systems. The paper focuses on passive treatment of circum-neutral <b>ferruginous</b> mine <b>waters</b> bearing up to 50 mg l− 1 of iron in either ferrous or ferric form. The Vertical Flow Reactor (VFR) operates by passing mine water down through an accreting bed of ochre, the ochre bed being responsible for the intensification of iron removal by self-filtration and/or autocatalytic iron oxidation and precipitation. Key to the design and operation of the VFR system is the decrease in permeability in this ochre bed over time. The paper demonstrates that the VFR system can remove iron at many times the 10 g/m 2 /day removal rate – an often employed figure for the sizing of aerobic settling ponds and wetlands. The paper demonstrates that VFRs are viable and novel passive treatment system for mine waters with a smaller footprint than conventional systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{continuous}} late Ediacaran - early Cambrian deep-water successions of South China archive {{the complete}} evolution of seawater chemical {{conditions in the}} deep ocean during this critical time interval. However, the geochemical data from these poorly fossiliferous and condensed successions lack high-resolution stratigraphic constraints, hampering their interpretation for the spatio-temporal evolution of the sweater chemistry in this time interval. In this study, we report a new SIMS and CA-ID-TIMS zircon U-Pb age 545. 76 ± 0. 66 Ma (total uncertainty) for an ash bed at the lower Liuchapo Formation in the deep-water Longbizui section in western Hunan Province. The new age suggests that the lower and the middle-upper parts of the Liuchapo Formation in the deep water facies can be correlated with the lower Dengying Formation and the upper Dengying - lower Zhujiaqing formations in the shallow water facies, respectively. This correlation implies that the correlative horizon of the Ediacaran-Cambrian boundary in the deep water facies in South China is likely located near {{the base of a}} widespread negative δ 13 Corg excursion at the upper Liuchapo Formation. Based on our new geochronological framework, the compilations of Fe-speciation, Mo, and U data indicate that the deep ocean was characterized by widespread anoxic, <b>ferruginous</b> <b>water,</b> with intermittent euxinic water impinged on the middle-lower slope in Ediacaran-Cambrian transition, and significant oxygenation events occurred in 533 – 520 Ma.

40|$|Nitrogen {{limitation}} {{during the}} Proterozoic has been inferred {{from the great}} expanse of ocean anoxia under low-O 2 atmospheres, which could have promoted NO 3 − reduction to N 2 and fixed N loss from the ocean. The deep oceans were Fe rich (ferruginous) during much of this time, yet the dynamics of N cycling under such conditions remain entirely conceptual, as analogue environments are rare today. Here we use incubation experiments {{to show that a}} modern ferruginous basin, Kabuno Bay in East Africa, supports high rates of NO 3 − reduction. Although 60 % of this NO 3 − is reduced to N 2 through canonical denitrification, a large fraction (40 %) is reduced to NH 4 +, leading to N retention rather than loss. We also find that NO 3 − reduction is Fe dependent, demonstrating that such reactions occur in natural <b>ferruginous</b> <b>water</b> columns. Numerical modelling of ferruginous upwelling systems, informed by our results from Kabuno Bay, demonstrates that NO 3 − reduction to NH 4 + could have enhanced biological production, fuelling sulfate reduction and the development of mid-water euxinia overlying ferruginous deep oceans. This NO 3 − reduction to NH 4 + could also have partly offset a negative feedback on biological production that accompanies oxygenation of the surface ocean. Our results indicate that N loss in ferruginous upwelling systems may not have kept pace with global N fixation at marine phosphorous concentrations (0. 04 – 0. 13 [*]μM) indicated by the rock record. We therefore suggest that global marine biological production under ferruginous ocean conditions in the Proterozoic eon may thus have been P not N limited.

40|$|Photoferrotrophy, {{the process}} by which {{inorganic}} carbon is fixed into organic matter using light as an energy source and reduced iron [Fe(II) ] as an electron donor, has been proposed as one of the oldest photoautotrophic metabolisms on Earth. Under the iron-rich (ferruginous) but sulfide poor conditions dominating the Archean ocean, this type of metabolism could have accounted for most of the primary production in the photic zone. Here we review the current knowledge of biogeochemical, microbial and phylogenetic aspects of photoferrotrophy, and evaluate the ecological significance of this process in ancient and modern environments. From the ferruginous conditions that prevailed during most of the Archean, the ancient ocean evolved toward euxinic (anoxic and sulfide rich) conditions and, finally, much after the advent of oxygenic photosynthesis, to a predominantly oxic environment. Under these new conditions photoferrotrophs lost importance as primary producers, and now photoferrotrophy remains as a vestige of a formerly relevant photosynthetic process. Apart from the geological record and other biogeochemical markers, modern environments resembling the redox conditions of these ancient oceans can offer insights into the past significance of photoferrotrophy and help to explain how this metabolism operated as an important source of organic carbon for the early biosphere. Iron-rich meromictic (permanently stratified) lakes can be considered as modern analogs of the ancient Archean ocean, as they present anoxic <b>ferruginous</b> <b>water</b> columns where light can still be available at the chemocline, thus offering suitable niches for photoferrotrophs. A few bacterial strains of purple bacteria as well as of green sulfur bacteria have been shown to possess photoferrotrophic capacities, and hence, could thrive in these modern Archean ocean analogs. Studies addressing the occurrence and the biogeochemical significance of photoferrotrophy in ferruginous environments have been conducted so far in lakes Matano, Pavin, La Cruz, and the Kabuno Bay of Lake Kivu. To date, only in the latter two lakes a biogeochemical role of photoferrotrophs has been confirmed. In this review we critically summarize the current knowledge on iron-driven photosynthesis, as a remains of ancient Earth biogeochemistry...|$|E

40|$|During the Cretaceous greenhouse, {{episodes of}} {{widespread}} ocean deoxygenation {{were associated with}} globally occurring events of black shale deposition. Possibly the most pronounced of these oceanic anoxic events (OAE’s) was the Cenomanian-Turonian OAE 2 (~ 94 Ma). However, although certain redox sensitive trace metals tend to be preferentially sequestered in sediments deposited under anoxic conditions, with Mo drawdown being specifically prone to euxinic settings, these elements are generally somewhat depleted in sediments deposited during OAE 2. To understand the driving factors responsible for this depleted trace metal drawdown, we have studied a low latitude section from the proto-North Atlantic Ocean (Tarfaya S 57), where existing biomarker and iron-sulphur data point to a dominantly euxinic water column, with periodic transitions to <b>ferruginous</b> (Fe-rich) <b>water</b> column conditions. We utilise a variety of redox proxies (Fe-speciation, redox sensitive trace metals and Mo isotopes), which, in combination, allows us to evaluate the detailed nature of ocean redox conditions and hence controls on trace metal drawdown. The results suggest that seawater δ 98 Mo values may have ranged between ~ 0. 6 and 1. 1 ‰ during OAE 2, likely connected {{to changes in the}} local Mo reservoir as a consequence of low and probably heterogeneous concentrations of Mo in the ocean. The very low Mo/TOC ratios at Tarfaya and elsewhere in the proto-North Atlantic may support a model in which deep-water circulation was partially restricted within and between the North Atlantic and other ocean basins. We propose that the combination of a low and possibly heterogeneous δ 98 Mo of seawater Mo, together with low Mo/TOC ratios, points to a large decrease in the global oceanic Mo reservoir during OAE 2, reflecting a major global scale increase in Mo drawdown under persistent euxinic conditions...|$|R

40|$|The {{deposition}} of Banded Iron Formation (BIF) during the Archean and Paleoproterozoic is conventionally {{attributed to the}} precipitation of iron-oxides resulting from the abiotic reaction of ferrous iron (Fe(II)) with oxygen (Cloud, 1968). Oxygenic photosynthesis, however, appeared only around 2. 7 Ga (Des Marais, 2000; Kump, 2008; Godfrey & Falkowski, 2009), thus raising questions as to what may have caused BIF precipitation before that time. The discovery of anoxygenic phototrophs thriving through the oxidation of Fe(II) (Widdel et al., 1993; Heisinget al., 1999) has provided support for a bacterial origin for early BIFs (Konhauseret al., 2002; Kappler et al., 20051). Despite reports of anoxygenic phototrophs that may oxidise Fe(II) in the environment (Crowe et al., 2008), a model ecosystem where photoferrotrophs are demonstrably active is still lacking (Svermann & Anbar, 2009; Johnston et al., 2009). Therefore, the ferruginous meromictic lake La Cruz (Spain) that sustains dense populations of purple and green anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria despite low sulfate and sulfide concentrations was investigated. First, the system was characterized by a physico-chemical analysis of its water column and sediments. Then we focuses on the chemocline compartment where iron oxides {{were found to be}} produced. On the one hand, We performed in situ 14 C-bicarbonate incubations to detect any stimulation of autotrophy by Fe(II) addition, while on the other hand ex situ incubations were carried out with the same natural sample to detect any Fe(II) oxidation by Lake La Cruz microbiota. In parallel, we have done enrichment cultures targeting anaerobic iron oxidizing metabolisms. In the second chapter, we show direct evidences of a photoferrotrophic activity in the ferruginous meromictic lake La Cruz (Spain) that sustains dense populations of purple and green anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria despite low sulfate and sulfide concentrations. We observed in situ photoferrotrophic activity through stimulation of phototrophic carbon uptake in the presence of Fe(II), and quantified light-dependent Fe(II) -oxidation by the natural chemocline microbiota to assess their potential quantitative contribution to ancient BIF formation. In addition, a green photoferrotrophic bacterial consortium was enriched for the first time from a <b>ferruginous</b> <b>water</b> column. This new model ecosystem will allow testing current concepts on ancient primary productivity and its interactions with the iron- and sulphur cycles and may help to refine paleoenvironmental proxies. In the third chapter, our results indicate, for the first time, that nitrate-dependent chemoautotrophic iron-oxidation occurred within Lake La Cruz chemocline. The organisms responsible for this Fe(II) -oxidation demonstrated, in optimized conditions, that their Fe(II) -oxidation rate was sufficiant to oxidize the totality of the dissolved Fe(II) arriving in the chemocline compartment (21. 6 - 38. 4 μmol Fe(II) I - 1 d - 1 and 0. 174 - 1. 393 μmol Fe(II) - 1 d - 1 respectively). MPN counts for anaerobic nitrate-dependent iron-oxidizers in other stratified water columns suggest that this metabolism is more widespread than previously thought. In addition, those results support a possible participation of such metabolism to BIFs formation during the Neoarchean, once nitrates were made available after the apparition of oxygenic photosynthesis. In the forth chapter, the results from this study combined with those of previous studies allowed us to establish a biogeochemical model, including all the metabolisms thought to have existed in the Late Archean Ocean. Thus, Lake La Cruz illustrates how those microorganisms could have driven and shaped biogeochemical cycles during this period. Accordingly, the water column of Lake La Cruz may represent an ecotone between the two main Neoarchean Ocean compartments and, consequently, be a good model system, or samples source, for studying metabolic activity interactions in experimental conditions that reflect theoretical models of the Archean Ocean...|$|E

Comparisons are drawn between existing iron(II) oxidation and iron removal studies and new knowledge is developed in the area of iron(III) settling behaviour, iron removal rate-limiting steps and methods to examine the treatability of <b>ferruginous</b> circumneutral mine <b>water.</b> Measured iron(II) oxidation rates are shown to be higher in this study than previous authors’ work, which is likely to be due to higher concentrations of particulate iron(III) present in the mine water that acts to catalyse the oxidation reaction. The iron(III) settling rate constant is shown to be proportional to the initial total iron concentration, however it is also seemingly effected by the concentration of magnesium and calcium present in the mine water. Rates of total iron removal are shown to be in general linearly proportional to the initial total iron concentration due to the acidity of the mine water, and oxidation and settling rate limiting steps, however some data does lie off of the trendline, meaning {{that it would not be}} suitable to be used to predict final total iron concentrations. Additionally a small study on modelling of the settling lagoons to predict the outlet iron concentrations based upon the inlet conditions and hydraulics of the lagoon was conducted and compared to existing settling lagoon formulae to ascertain which was the most accurate in terms of correctly predicting the outlet iron concentrations...|$|R
40|$|The first {{appearance}} of skeletal metazoans {{in the late}} Ediacaran (~ 550 million years ago; Ma) {{has been linked to}} the widespread development of oxygenated oceanic conditions, but a precise spatial and temporal reconstruction of their evolution has not been resolved. Here we consider the evolution of ocean chemistry from ~ 550 to ~ 541 Ma across shelf-to-basin transects in the Zaris and Witputs Sub-Basins of the Nama Group, Namibia. New carbon isotope data capture the final stages of the Shuram/Wonoka deep negative C-isotope excursion, and these are complemented with a reconstruction of water column redox dynamics utilising Fe-S-C systematics and the distribution of skeletal and soft-bodied metazoans. Combined, these inter-basinal datasets provide insight into the potential role of ocean redox chemistry during this pivotal interval of major biological innovation. The strongly negative d 13 C values in the lower parts of the sections reflect both a secular, global change in the C-isotopic composition of Ediacaran seawater, as well as the influence of 'local' basinal effects as shown by the most negative d 13 C values occurring in the transition from distal to proximal ramp settings. Critical, though, is that the transition to positive d 13 C values postdates the appearance of calcified metazoans, indicating that the onset of biomineralization did not occur under post-excursion conditions. Significantly, we find that anoxic and <b>ferruginous</b> deeper <b>water</b> column conditions were prevalent during and after the transition to positive d 13 C that marks the end of the Shuram/Wonoka excursion. Thus, if the C isotope trend reflects the transition to global-scale oxygenation {{in the aftermath of the}} oxidation of a large-scale, isotopically light organic carbon pool, it was not sufficient to fully oxygenate the deep ocean. Both sub-basins reveal highly dynamic redox structures, where shallow, inner ramp settings experienced transient oxygenation. Anoxic conditions were caused either by episodic upwelling of deeper anoxic waters or higher rates of productivity. These settings supported short-lived and monospecific skeletal metazoan communities. By contrast, microbial (thrombolite) reefs, found in deeper inner- and mid-ramp settings, supported more biodiverse communities with complex ecologies and large skeletal metazoans. These long-lived reef communities, as well as Ediacaran soft-bodied biotas, are found particularly within transgressive systems, where oxygenation was persistent. We suggest that a mid-ramp position enabled physical ventilation mechanisms for shallow water column oxygenation to operate during flooding and transgressive sea-level rise. Our data support a prominent role for oxygen, and for stable oxygenated conditions in particular, in controlling both the distribution and ecology of Ediacaran skeletal metazoan communities...|$|R
50|$|The Municipality of Aguilar had {{its early}} {{beginnings}} as cattle ranch {{founded by the}} Spaniards. The place was known then as Sitio Balubad, which was then still part {{of the town of}} Binalatongan (now San Carlos). On the western part were the Zambales Mountains with thick forests and verdant foliage. It was hunter's paradise with deer roaming here and there with an occasional wild boar making an appearance. The grass in the plains were succulent fare for fattening cattle and the water from the brooks and streams clear and sparkling.On the eastern part was the Agno River. At that time, there were no roads were yet established. There were footpaths which eventually roads providing access from one place to another. The river arteries constituted the main mode of transportation in the interior towns. Through these river systems, boats sailed from the Ilocos provinces in the North southwards to Dagupan, Calasiao, Lingayen and sometimes even as far as San Isidro De Labrador, Salasa, Aguilar and Camiling. Worth noting was the fossiliferous river bank in Camiling useful in making lime, while mineral <b>waters</b> consisting of <b>ferruginous</b> and alkaline <b>waters</b> were and are still found in Aguilar and Mangatarem.As a thriving place for cattle and bountiful rice harvests, it was natural for Aguilar to attract people from other towns to stay and settle in the place.The early settlers prospered and lived in peace and contentment. When the Spaniards in Lingayen heard of this flourishing village, they sent Spanish explorers through the town of Salasa to visit the place. Some Spanish soldiers and priest were left to organize a pueblo. In time, the clamor to convert the settlement into a town became popular. A petition was therefore, filed with the principales or municipal officials of Binalatongan to convert the village into a town. The petition was finally favorably endorsed.|$|R
40|$|Genistein and {{daidzein}} are plant-derived compounds called phytoestrogens, {{and they}} are found in high concentrations in legumes, primarily soy. Phytoestrogens function as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in animals when assimilated in high doses. Changed secondary sex characteristics and reduced fertility have been observed in fish due to these endocrine disrupting abilities of phytoestrogens. The role of phytoestrogens as environmental contaminants is highly relevant because of the growing soy-based biofuel industry. This thesis examines {{the extent to which}} genistein and daidzein adsorb onto goethite nanoparticles (-FeO(OH)). The goethite simulates sediment consisting of iron particles and suspended solids in water. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the fate of genistein and daidzein when they are discharged in <b>water</b> bodies with <b>ferruginous</b> sediments, and whether they get removed from the aqueous phase or stay dissolved. Standard batch adsorption experiments were carried out for genistein and daidzein onto goethite, and adsorption isotherms and sorption edges were made from the results. Furthermore the specific surface area (SSATEM) of the goethite nanoparticles was calculated using TEM-pictures, and the pKa values for goethite were found and calculated from standard potentiometric titrations. SSATEM of the goethite nanoparticles was found to be 248 m 2 /g ± 90 m 2 /g, while the specific surface area determined through BET-analysis, SSABET, was measured to 118. 5 m 2 /g ± 2. 6 m 2 /g. Furthermore the pKa values for goethite were calculated at pH 6. 73 and 10. 34, and the pH of point zero charge, pHpzc, was found at 8. 3. The isotherm and sorption edge results showed that adsorption of genistein and daidzein onto goethite is pH-dependent and also independent of the adsorbate concentrations at these relatively low environmental relevant concentrations. For genistein, the adsorption decreased constantly with increasing pH. The highest adsorption capacity was at pH 4. 7 with a KD at 0. 00431 L/m 2 and a percent mass adsorbed at 84 %. At pH higher than 7. 4, the adsorption capacity started decreasing rapidly, to a minimum of 17 % mass adsorbed and a KD of 0. 000168 L/m 2 at pH 9. 7. Daidzein was only removed to a limited degree and had an adsorption maxima at pH 7. 4, with 27 % mass adsorbed and a KD at 0. 000307 L/m 2. KD and the percent mass adsorbed were slightly lower from pH 4. 7 to 7. 4. The minimum adsorption capacity for daidzein was found at pH 9. 7, with a KD of 4. 66691 E- 06 L/m 2 and only 1 % mass adsorbed. Hydrophobic interactions or surface complexations were suggested as the adsorption mechanisms at low pH for both genistein and daidzein. Electrostatic repulsion was proposed to be the reason for the drop in adsorption capacity at higher pH, when the compounds get deprotonated. Applying the results to determine the fate of phytoestrogens in the environment, it is clear that genistein will be removed by adsorption {{to a greater extent than}} daidzein, when released to <b>ferruginous</b> natural <b>waters.</b> The removal of the phytoestrogens from the water phase through adsorption is significantly higher at low pH compared to high pH values, and thus the adsorption mechanism is more relevant for low pH waters...|$|R
