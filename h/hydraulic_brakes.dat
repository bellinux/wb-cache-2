5|$|The {{airframe}} is of semi-monocoque structure constructed {{primarily of}} aluminium alloys. High strength steel and titanium alloys are partially adopted in some critical areas. The airframe {{is designed for}} a service life of 4,000 flight hours or 25 years, the first overhaul being due at 1,200 flight hours. Block 2 JF-17s incorporate greater use of composite materials in the airframe to reduce weight. The retractable undercarriage has a tricycle arrangement with a single steerable nose-wheel and two main undercarriages. The <b>hydraulic</b> <b>brakes</b> have an automatic anti-skid system. The position {{and shape of the}} inlets is designed to give the required airflow to the jet engine during manoeuvres involving high angles of attack.|$|E
5|$|The Duesenberg Model A was {{the first}} {{automobile}} in series production to have <b>hydraulic</b> <b>brakes</b> and the first automobile in series production in the United States with a straight-eight engine. Officially known as the Duesenberg Straight Eight, the Model A was first shown in late 1920 in New York City. Production was delayed by substantial changes {{to the design of}} the car, including a change in the engine valvetrain from horizontal overhead valves to an overhead camshaft; also during this time, the company had moved its headquarters and factory from New Jersey to Indiana. The Model A was manufactured in Indianapolis, Indiana, from 1921 to 1925 by the Duesenberg Automobiles and Motors Company and from 1925 to 1926 at the same factory by the restructured Duesenberg Motor Company. The successors to the company began referring to the car as the Model A when the Model J was introduced.|$|E

40|$|Abstract：The {{full power}} <b>hydraulic</b> <b>brake</b> system has several {{advantages}} over traditional brake actuation systems. These systems {{are capable of}} supplying fluid {{to a range of}} very small and large volume service brakes with actuation that is faster than air/hydraulic brake systems. Implementation of full power <b>hydraulic</b> <b>brake</b> system in off-road vehicles calls for good understanding of its dynamic characteristics. In this paper, we consider the problem of dynamic modeling of the brake system and develop a dynamic model for a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>brake</b> valve. First, the dynamic characteristics of full power <b>hydraulic</b> <b>brake</b> system are analyzed theoretically. The effects of varying design parameters (brake valve, accumulator and so on) and the different operating conditions are then analyzed. Second, we investigate the dynamic characteristics of a full power <b>hydraulic</b> <b>brake</b> system using a test bench, which is a loader brake system specifically designed for one construction Machinery Company. Finally, based on the experimental results, the mathematical models are amended and verified. The result shows that the model-calculated data agree well with tested data. The dynamic behavior of hydraulic valve can be well predicted with the model. The simplified models {{can be applied to the}} studies of full power <b>hydraulic</b> <b>brake</b> system dynamics...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- The bogie of {{monorail}} vehicles applies {{rubber wheel}} system not steel wheel system. In addition, The {{structure of the}} bogie is very complicated because vehicle operates on the elevated road and vehicle drives with wrapping the guide way. When the monorail vehicle applies air brake system, lower device of vehicle may be complex and some devices may be limited. On the other hand, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>brake</b> equipment is compact and not weighing. Braking force is also outstanding compared with air <b>brake</b> so the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>brake</b> equipment is suitable for monorail vehicle.

25|$|The Roadmaster was {{introduced}} {{in a year when}} Buick's valve-in-head straight-eight engines were heavily revised. Buick reduced the number of engines from four sizes to two: a 233-cubic-inch, 93-horsepower job for the Special, and a big, 320.2-cubic inch, 120-horsepower engine for the other series. (To put the size and power of Buick’s larger straight-eight engine in context, compare it to the new 322-cubic-inch mono-block 120 horsepower V-8 that Cadillac introduced that year.) In addition to this major engineering change 1936 was also the year Buick adopted an all steel turret top and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>brakes.</b> Coil springs were in the front.|$|E
25|$|Cars 380-387 were {{originally}} delivered with experimental <b>hydraulic</b> <b>braking</b> systems. While the cars had these braking systems, {{they could not}} be operated with other R44s.

25|$|All was {{not well}} financially and the {{receiver}} was called in 1935, but the company was bought by Alan P. Good, who just outbid Rolls-Royce. He also persuaded W. O. Bentley to leave Rolls-Royce and join Lagonda as designer along with many of his racing department staff. The 4.5-litre range now became the LG45 with lower but heavier bodies and also available in LG45R Rapide form. The LG45 came in three versions known as Sanction 1, 2 and 3 each with more Bentley touches to the engine. In 1938 the LG6 with independent front suspension by torsion bar and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>brakes</b> came in.|$|E
25|$|In normal {{operation}} for locomotive/carriage trains, on descending and level running, {{the train is}} normally braked (service braking) using the locomotive. This uses compression braking – the energy is absorbed by using the cylinders as pumps, then dumping the pressure, similar to a Jake brake – on steam locomotives, hydraulic braking on the diesel locomotives. The diesel-electric railcars were service braked using <b>hydraulic</b> <b>brakes</b> and dynamic braking, during which power was dissipated in roof-mounted resistors, creating a distinct heat shimmer when the vehicles were descending and shortly afterwards. The hand brakes are used to bring a train to a complete stand from low speed, and as a parking brake.|$|E
25|$|The PT-22 {{fuel system}} {{consists}} of a single tank mounted forward of the front cockpit. Fuel is gravity fed to the carburetor.

The wing flaps are mechanically operated from a lever located {{on the left side}} of each cockpit. Adjustable elevator trim is provided via an elevator trim tab controllable from a handwheel mounted {{on the left side of}} each cockpit. In its original configuration, the aircraft was not equipped with an electrical system. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>brakes</b> are provided for each wheel, controllable via the rudder pedals in each cockpit.|$|E

25|$|The Sparviero had an all wood, low mounted {{cantilever}} wing of isosceles trapezoidal plan, {{built around a}} single spar and covered with stressed plywood skin, with differential ailerons and trailing edge flaps. The fuselage was a ply skinned wooden monocoque, built in two sections which bolted together just aft of the wings. The forward part held the cabin, which seated four in two pairs, with access via two wide doors over the wings. The roof line of the cabin continued aft into that of the rear fuselage. The Sparviero was initially powered by a 250hp (187kW) Hirth inverted V-8 air-cooled engine, though it was the intention to replace this with a 260hp (194kW) Lycoming horizontally opposed engine in production models and the prototype received one later. Fuel was fed from three tanks, two in the wings {{and one in the}} fuselage. The tail unit was conventional, with the tailplane just above the fuselage. The latter tapered in height rearwards and the fin merged into it with a dorsal fillet. The empennage construction was {{similar to that of the}} wing, except that the control surfaces were fabric covered. The tricycle undercarriage was retractable and fitted with <b>hydraulic</b> <b>brakes.</b>|$|E
25|$|The vintage era {{lasted from}} the end of World War I (1918), through to the Wall Street Crash at the end of 1929. During this period the front-engined car came to {{dominate}} with closed bodies and standardised controls becoming the norm. In 1919, 90% of cars sold were open; by 1929, 90% were closed. Development of the internal combustion engine continued at a rapid pace, with multi-valve and overhead camshaft engines produced at the high end, and V8, V12, and even V16 engines conceived for the ultra-rich. Also in 1919, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>brakes</b> were invented by Malcolm Loughead (co-founder of Lockheed); they were adopted by Duesenberg for their 1921 Model A. Three years later, Hermann Rieseler of Vulcan Motor invented the first automatic transmission, which had two-speed planetary gearbox, torque converter, and lockup clutch; it never entered production. (Its like would only become an available option in 1940.) Just {{at the end of the}} vintage era, tempered glass (now standard equipment in side windows) was invented in France. In this era the revolutionary ponton design of cars without fully articulated fenders, running boards and other non-compact ledge elements was introduced in small series but mass production of such cars was started much later (after WWII).|$|E
