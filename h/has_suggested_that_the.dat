Some economists <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe be reformed.

5|$|James Hutchison Cockburn, a {{historian}} of Dunblane's medieval bishops, assumed that Walter's surname {{derived from the}} town of Coventry in England. D. E. R.

5|$|Advocates {{for higher}} levels of {{selection}} (such as Richard Lewontin, David Sloan Wilson, and Elliott Sober) {{suggest that there are}} many phenomena (including altruism) that gene-based selection cannot satisfactorily explain. The philosopher Mary Midgley, with whom Dawkins clashed in print concerning The Selfish Gene, has criticised gene selection, memetics, and sociobiology as being excessively reductionist; she <b>has</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> popularity of Dawkins's work is due to factors in the Zeitgeist such as the increased individualism of the Thatcher/Reagan decades.|$|E

5|$|Hume <b>has</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Mascarene parrots have {{a common}} origin in the {{radiation}} of the Psittaculini tribe, basing this theory on morphological features {{and the fact that}} Psittacula parrots have managed to colonise many isolated islands in the Indian Ocean. The Psittaculini may have invaded the area several times, as many of the species were so specialised that they may have evolved significantly on hotspot islands before the Mascarenes emerged from the sea.|$|E
5|$|It is {{generally}} read as being set in India, though it gives no {{details of the}} actual situation. Some research <b>has</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> poem was written with a specific incident in mind, the execution of one Private Flaxman of The Leicestershire Regiment, at Lucknow in 1887. A number of details of this execution correspond to the occasion described by Kipling in the poem, and he later used a story {{similar to that of}} Flaxman's as a basis for the story Black Jack.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not clear}} to what extent, if any, the Hell Fire Club made use of the building. The author Michael Fewer <b>has</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{remoteness}} of Mount Pelier's location is why there are almost no verifiable accounts of the activities that went on there. However, numerous (and very doubtful) stories surrounding the building {{have become part of}} local folklore, some of which have spread to a wider audience through publication in the nineteenth century in books such as Robert Chambers' Book of Days (1864) and in The Gentleman's Magazine (1731–1922).|$|E

Morphological {{examination}} <b>has</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> bluespotted ribbontail ray is {{more closely related to}} the amphi-American Himantura (H. pacifica and H. schmardae) and the river stingrays (Potamotrygonidae) than to the congeneric blotched fantail ray (T. meyeni), which is closer to Dasyatis and Indo-Pacific Himantura.|$|E
5|$|R. s. sondaicus, the {{nominate}} subspecies, {{known as}} the Indonesian Javan rhinoceros, once lived on Java and Sumatra. The population is now confined to as more than 63 animals in the wild, Ujung Kulon National Park on the western tip of the island of Java. One researcher <b>has</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Javan rhino on Sumatra belonged to a distinct subspecies, R. s. floweri, {{but this is not}} widely accepted.|$|E
5|$|The {{most recent}} {{surveys of the}} ship {{indicate}} that the ship was modified late in her career and have lent support {{to the idea that}} the Mary Rose was altered too much to be properly seaworthy.

5|$|The oldest graves are to {{the north}} of the church, which is unusual: ordinarily the {{southern}} part of the churchyard would be used first for burials, with the northern part remaining unconsecrated unless and until extra space for graves was required. The path between the road and the church has sunken, which may partly be explained by the medieval custom of burying the dead on top of each other. One author <b>has</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> mound alongside the path might indicate that the church is located in the site of a Bronze Age settlement.|$|E
5|$|This {{thumb is}} {{typically}} {{interpreted as a}} close-quarter stiletto-like weapon against predators, although it could also {{have been used to}} break into seeds and fruits, or against other Iguanodon. One author <b>has</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> spike was attached to a venom gland, but this has not been accepted, as the spike was not hollow, nor were there any grooves on the spike for conducting venom.|$|E
5|$|Although Dawkins {{invented the}} term meme, {{he has not}} claimed that the idea was entirely novel, {{and there have been}} other {{expressions}} for similar ideas in the past. For instance, John Laurent <b>has</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> term may have derived from the work of the little-known German biologist Richard Semon. In 1904, Semon published Die Mneme (which appeared in English in 1924 as The Mneme). This book discusses the cultural transmission of experiences, with insights parallel to those of Dawkins. Laurent also found the term mneme used in Maurice Maeterlinck's The Life of the White Ant (1926), and has highlighted the similarities to Dawkins's concept.|$|E

5|$|Although cholangiocarcinoma {{is known}} to have the {{histological}} and molecular features of an adenocarcinoma of epithelial cells lining the biliary tract, the actual cell of origin is unknown. Recent evidence <b>has</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> initial transformed cell that generates the primary tumor may arise from a pluripotent hepatic stem cell. Cholangiocarcinoma is thought to develop through a series of stages - from early hyperplasia and metaplasia, through dysplasia, to the development of frank carcinoma - in a process similar to that seen in the development of colon cancer. Chronic inflammation and obstruction of the bile ducts, and the resulting impaired bile flow, are thought {{to play a role in}} this progression.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, more recent work <b>has</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> regular {{army of the}} 2nd century was {{considerably}} larger than the c. 300,000 traditionally assumed. This is because the 2nd-century auxilia were not just equal in numbers to the legions as in the early 1st century, but some 50% larger. The army of the Principate probably reached a peak of nearly 450,000 (excluding fleets and foederati) {{at the end of}} the 2nd century. Furthermore, the evidence is that the actual strength of 2nd-century units was typically much closer to official (c. 85%) than 4th century units.|$|E
5|$|Folklorist Gary R. Varner <b>has</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{origin of}} the belief in water horses that preyed on and devoured humans may be a {{reflection}} of the human sacrifices once made to appease the gods of water. The association with horses may have its roots in horse sacrifices performed in ancient Scandinavia. Stories of malevolent water spirits served the practical purpose of keeping children away from perilous areas of water, and of warning adolescent women to be wary of attractive young strangers. The stories were also used to enforce moral standards, as they implied that the creatures took retribution for bad behaviour carried out on Sundays. The intervention of demons and spirits was possibly a way to rationalise the drowning of children and adults who had accidentally fallen into deep, fast flowing or turbulent water.|$|E
