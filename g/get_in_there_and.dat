Gillian Anderson was {{very pleased with the}} scene. She later noted that [...] "I happened to be in good shape at the time and was just raring to <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> be taking those half-naked nurses out with some karate chops." [...] David Duchovny was not as exuberant; when showed the script and directed to [...] "be impressed with [...] karate skills", he responded that [...] "But I have no arms. I've lost my arms. Why would I care about Scully's karate?" [...] Dean Haglund later called the sequence [...] "one of the great fight scenes, ever".|$|E

[...] "You and Me" [...] was first released via digital download on January 28, 2005. It was then solicited to mainstream radio on March 15, 2005. An extended wedding version of the song was released on July 26, 2005.|$|E

500|$|The 1992 Hooters 500, {{the final}} {{race of the}} 1992 season, is {{considered}} one of the most eventful races in NASCAR history. It was the final race for Richard Petty and the first for Jeff Gordon. Sixdrivers were close enough in the points standings to win the championship that day. Allison led second-place Kulwicki by 30 points, Bill Elliott by 40, Harry Gant by 97, and Kyle Petty by 98 and needed to finish sixth or better to clinch the championship. Kulwicki received approval from NASCAR and Ford to change the [...] "Thunderbird" [...] lettering on his bumper for the race to [...] "underbird" [...] because he felt like the underdog in the contention for the championship. During Kulwicki's first pit stop, the first gear in the car's transmission broke. Andrews said, [...] "We had to leave pit road in fourth gear, because we had broken metal parts in there, and only by leaving it in fourth are you not going to move metal around as much. We could only hope that the loose piece of metal didn't <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> break the gears in half. We had three or fourpit stops after it broke. I held my breath all day long." [...] Allison was racing in sixthplace, closely behind Ernie Irvan, when Irvan's tire blew with 73 (of 328) laps left in the event. As a result, Allison ran into the side of Irvan's spinning car and his car was too damaged to continue. Kulwicki and Elliott were left to duel for the title. While leading late in the race, Andrews calculated the exact lap for his final pit stop so that Kulwicki would be guaranteed to lead the most laps and would gain fivebonus points. Kulwicki made his final pit stop only after leading enough laps to guarantee the bonus points. To save time, the pit crew did a fuel-only pit stop. Not changing tires allowed them to be available to push the car to prevent it from stalling, since the car had to start moving in a higher gear. Because the team's fuel man hurried to add the gasoline during the quick stop, he did not add the desired amount into the tank. As a result, Kulwicki had to conserve fuel to ensure that his car was still running at the end of the race. Elliott won the race and Kulwicki stretched his fuel to finish second. Kulwicki won the 1992 Winston Cup Championship by maintaining his 10-point lead over Elliott. He celebrated the championship with his second Polish victory lap. Always conscious of his appearance for potential sponsors, Kulwicki combed his hair, making a national television audience wait for him to emerge from his car.|$|E

His next fight (on November 1 {{of the same}} year) was {{in his hometown of}} Grand Rapids against WBC #1-ranked contender Phillip N'dou, whose record was 31–1 with 30 KOs. During the run-up to the fight Nelson Mandela invited N'dou to his office for a pep talk before his departure for the U.S., advising him to [...] "keep Mayweather on the outside with the jab, work the body and the head will become available". South African president Thabo Mbeki, in a note, said he had [...] "full confidence" [...] N'dou would put on a performance to make all South Africans proud and would return home with the WBC belt.

60|$|One day I was {{listening}} to some conversation upon this subject when an American student said that for some time he had been under sentence for a slight breach of the peace and had promised the constable that he would presently find an unoccupied day and betake himself to prison. I asked the young gentleman to do me the kindness {{to go to jail}} as soon as he conveniently could, so that I might try to <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> visit him, and see what college captivity was like. He said he would appoint the very first day he could spare.|$|E
60|$|His {{confinement}} was {{to endure}} twenty-four hours. He shortly chose his day, {{and sent me}} word. I started immediately. When I reached the University Place, I saw two gentlemen talking together, and, as they had portfolios under their arms, I judged they were tutors or elderly students; so I asked them in English {{to show me the}} college jail. I had learned to take it for granted that anybody in Germany who knows anything, knows English, so I had stopped afflicting people with my German. These gentlemen seemed a trifle amused--and a trifle confused, too--but one of them said he would walk around the corner with me and show me the place. He asked me why I wanted to <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> I said to see a friend--and for curiosity. He doubted if I would be admitted, but volunteered to put in a word or two for me with the custodian.|$|E

Reasoning further upon the description of the supposed murderer as given by the servants, and placarded broadcast in every town in England, I came to the conclusion that the police couldn't yet have discovered the existence of these negatives: for some of them must surely have photographed my face, however little in focus; while the printed descriptions mentioned only the man's back, as the servants saw him escaping from the window. The papers said the room was being kept closed till the inquest, for inspection in due time by the coroner's jury. I made up my mind at once.
