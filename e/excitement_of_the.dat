5|$|Around {{the time}} of the {{armistice}} which ended the war, Baker's engagement with Scott was broken off; Scott then began a relationship with an American diplomat in Paris, Philander Cable. Missing his fiancee and the <b>excitement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war, he felt directionless; he dreaded going back to work in an office and considered himself a sportsman rather than a businessman. Though he was scheduled to return to the United States in December, Baker requested and was refused an extension of his time in France.|$|E
5|$|Helmuth Raithel (9 April 190712 September 1990) was a German {{officer who}} held the rank of SS-Standartenführer (colonel) in the Waffen-SS during World War II. While still at school, Raithel was {{swept up in the}} <b>excitement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Munich Beer Hall Putsch of 9 November 1923 led by Adolf Hitler, and was {{subsequently}} awarded the coveted Blood Order, even though he was {{not a member of the}} Nazi Party. He joined the Reichswehr (interwar German Army) in 1926. After World War II broke out he fought in the invasion of Greece in summer 1941, then against the Soviet Red Army in northern Finland before transferring to the Waffen-SS in 1943.|$|E
5|$|The story, {{expanded}} {{from that of}} the concept album, centers on three disaffected young men, Johnny, Will and Tunny. Johnny and Tunny flee a stifling suburban lifestyle and parental restrictions, while Will stays home to work out his relationship with his pregnant girlfriend, Heather. The former pair look for meaning in life and try out the freedom and <b>excitement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city. Tunny quickly gives up on life in the city, joins the military and is shipped off to war. Johnny turns to drugs and finds a part of himself that he grows to dislike, has a relationship and experiences lost love.|$|E

5|$|A second prototype, {{completed}} {{near the}} end of 1978, had only about eight rooms, a single dragon, and two objects, and Robinett recognized that the game, though demonstrating what he had set out to do, was boring. He put the game aside for a few months and came back with additional ideas to improve the game, finishing it by June 1979. Two changes that Robinett added were the possibility of being eaten by the dragon, as well as the means to reset the avatar if this should happen, and the addition of the sword object, which could kill the dragon. Robinett found the various possibilities that arose from this combination of elements improved the <b>excitement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game, and subsequently made three dragons, reusing the same code for the behavior of all three. The magnet was created to work around a potential situation where the player could drop an object into a wall space and make it irretrievable.|$|E
5|$|Seventeen {{hours after}} lifting off at sunrise in Japan, the men {{began to see}} the sun rise again over the Yukon—it was a very short day for them, and none had been able to sleep for the <b>excitement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trip, the {{stimulant}} benzedrine, and the penetrating cold. Crossing into Canada, the headwinds grew stronger still, and a load of hard rime ice and clear ice was visible on the wings. Though the B-29s had been delivered to the war front complete with deicing equipment, such gear had been removed months before to reduce weight and therefore increase combat range and speed. The ice load picked up in the night would have to be endured until it melted off at lower altitudes.|$|E
5|$|As Nelson's professional, Constantine was {{immediately}} successful. Although he produced better figures in subsequent years, he considered {{his first season}} at Nelson the most enjoyable of his life, owing to the freedom and <b>excitement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cricket. In nine years at the club he scored 6,363 runs {{at an average of}} 37.65 and took 776 wickets at 9.50. His highest score was 192, and his best bowling figures were ten wickets for ten runs. In each season except for 1932, he averaged over 30 with the bat and in 1933 he scored 1,000 runs at an average of over 50. He took over 70 wickets every season and his bowling average never rose above 11.30; in five seasons, he averaged under ten runs per wicket. In 1933 he took 96 wickets, his highest seasonal aggregate, and had he not missed two games to play for the West Indies touring team, would likely have completed the cricketer's double (1,000 runs and 100 wickets), an unprecedented feat in the league.|$|E

25|$|The {{percussion}} {{section of}} the band has been using Pearl percussion for several years. In 2014, {{a decision was made}} to experiment with metal drum carriers. Drum carriers had been used {{for a number of years}} by tenor drum players, however the bass drums and snares continued to use cloth sling harnesses. Through a large amount of experimentation, metal carriers made their debut midway through the 2014 season for halftime and parade use only. The snares and basses are still carried by traditional sling for pregame, due to the visuals done with the drums that add to the <b>excitement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ramp entrance.|$|E
25|$|International Settlement's club acts, {{with their}} can-can dancers and old-fashioned chorus girls, {{were unable to}} compete with the {{incredible}} talent and <b>excitement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> emerging Broadway scene, and by the early 1960s their popularity had fallen below a critical level. But despite the brilliance and innovation of Broadway's entertainment scene of the 1950s and 1960s, its live entertainment clubs would also lose their popularity with time. As of the first decade in the 21st century, Broadway had lost its standup comedy clubs and its live music clubs, only to be replaced by cocktail lounges with recorded music. However, some live music clubs still operate in other areas of North Beach.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> origin <b>of</b> surfing {{was most}} likely started in New Guinea. It was a sport full of culture, fun, and adventure.

25|$|After two hours, {{the whale}} was slowly and gently lifted onto a barge by a crane near Albert Bridge. By this stage there were {{thousands}} of people watching the situation develop from the banks of the river, and the images were seen across the world. The <b>excitement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previous day had disappeared, and there was now serious concern that the whale would be unable to survive for much longer. As the barge rushed along the Thames towards the sea, news channels provided non-stop coverage of the journey. It reached the Thames Barrier at approximately 5:00 pm. Later, despite the darkness, it was reported that crowds were lining the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge {{to catch a glimpse of}} the barge.|$|E

One, a maiden of no ordinary beauty, a daughter of Dr. Matthew Griffith, an Anglican clergyman, expelled from the City of London, hearing her father abused and maltreated (he was wounded but not mortally), gave back angry words to his reviler. The incensed soldier, maddened with the <b>excitement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hour, struck her on the head, killing her. Six of the ten priests in the House were slain, and the four others held for the gallows.|$|E
25|$|After {{interviewing}} 31 dogmen {{and attending}} 14 dog fights in the Southern United States, Evans, Gauthier, and Forsyth theorized on what attracts men to dog fights. In their study, Evans, et al., discussed dog fighting's attractiveness {{in terms of}} masculinity and class immobility. In the United States, masculinity embodies the qualities of strength, aggression, competition, and striving for success. By embodying these characteristics, a man can gain honor and status in his society. Yet, working class occupations, unlike middle or upper class occupations, provide limited opportunities to validate this culturally accepted definition of masculinity. So, working class men look for alternative ways to validate their masculinity and obtain honor and status. One {{way to do this}} is through dogfighting. This is supported by the Evans, et al. findings: the majority of committed dogmen were mostly drawn from the working class, while the middle and upper classes were barely represented. Men from middle and upper classes have opportunities to express their masculinity through their occupations; dog fighting, therefore, is just a hobby for them while it plays a central role in the lives of working class men. Those from the higher classes are drawn in by the thrill and <b>excitement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fight.|$|E

50|$|Distinct vocalizations {{are used}} {{depending}} on whether they are for inter-group communication of extra-group communication. For inter-group communication, a short distance call is used, while for an extra-group communication call, a loud, shrill long distance call is used. Specific vocalizations are used when an adult buffy-headed marmoset discovers a source of food with others. Younger ones respond by running towards the calling marmoset, while expressing vocalizations <b>of</b> <b>excitement.</b> <b>The</b> dominant female will sometimes also express these vocalizations <b>of</b> <b>excitement.</b> If <b>the</b> food is not given, the female and younger marmosets will stay near the adult buffy-headed marmoset while conveying short vocalizations, to display their presence and express a need for food.|$|R

[...] The setting was unique and memorable, showing seedy café life in Paris, and the <b>excitement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pamplona festival, with a middle section devoted to descriptions of a fishing trip in the Pyrenees.
