50|$|Under the new {{homestead}} law, settlers began {{purchasing the}} “even-numbered” sections {{from the state}} {{for the benefit of}} the Common School Fund in 1883. In conjunction with the introduction of the fence, these settlers began owning land that was previously controlled by the large cattle outfits, and this eventually led to the Fence Cutting Wars. This acreage was sold by the state on a first-come, first-served basis with the county advertising the availability of land, which resulted in extremely long lines at the county clerks' offices and increased the likelihood that the desired acreage would not be available. As a result of Common School Fund process, W.R. McEntire, while in Dallas, sent representatives from Tom Green County to acquire as much land as possible and to keep others out of the line until the desired acreage was obtained. North Carolinian James Jefferson Lafayott Glass came to the county in 1883 and signed on with the Sterling Brothers’ Half Circle <b>S</b> <b>outfit.</b> He later homesteaded acreage along the Lacy Creek.|$|R
40|$|Looking back at {{the history}} of Japanese textiles, the {{beginning}} seems to be braiding and/or netting fibers made from tree bark or tall grass (Jomon period - approximately C 13 th - C 10 th BC.). Weaving seems to appear after the mid-Jomon period. Silk was brought into Japan in the late-Jomon to the Yayoi period (600 BC- 200 AD), {{and for a long time}} its use was restricted to the upper class. During the Momoyama period (1573 - 1603) cotton seeds were introduced and cotton grown in Japan. By the mid-Edo period (1603 - 1868) cotton cultivation had spread over the southern part of Japan, and cotton became available to commoners. According to Kunio Yanagida, until cotton became known to the ordinary people in the 17 th century, they wore cloth made form bast fibers, such as hemp, ramie, kaju (paper mulberry), liden, wisteria, etc. Garments made from tree or grass fibre have been used to protect ordinary people for a few thousand years. Many stories have been told about the brilliant silk fabrics of japan but little is known about bast fibre cloth.

50|$|Following five {{successful}} {{months at}} Rouvas' self-owned The S Club, Rouvas opted {{to move the}} show to Thessaloniki. This is Rouvas third consecutive summer series at Politia; he had first performed there with Peggy Zina in 2008, and continued his own performances in 2009 while also on a national tour, although this performance was not an extension of his Athens STARZ shows. Originally, the premiere date was announced as 7 May. The media speculated that due to further perfecting technical developments of the show it would finally premiere one week later, although the crew themselves did not actually comment on this. This was materialized when the show premiered on 14 May. Originally set for a six-week engagement, Rouvas told ANT1 News that they would also {{be present in the}} city in August, bringing the total amount of shows to more than 24. The show was similar to The S Club shows, however, some changes were made: the Greek The X Factor contestant Eleftheria Eleftheriou was taken out of the program and rapper Gifted was replaced with Giorgos Axas. The deejay was also changed to Antonis Dimitriadis, who is the house deejay at Politia. Additionally, Rouvas performed in an entirely different wardrobe than his <b>S</b> Club <b>outfits.</b>|$|R
40|$|My thesis exposes {{users to}} interpretive ballet, using {{many aspects of}} {{computer}} graphics design, including 3 D animation, interaction and graphical user interface design. The interactive work consists of dragging and dropping pre-rendered animated ballet moves to create a sequenced dance performance. The target audience is young girls, ages 7 - 13, {{who are interested in}} interpretive dance and/or ballet. As ballet consists of precise movement, my animation focuses more on interpretive dance movements that imply ballet, rather than mimic the actual precision of ballet moves. The model used for this project was constructed on a grant from the National Center for Women in Technology. The design portion was changed to make the project more believable. The model 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> casual <b>outfit</b> was changed to ballet tutu. The tennis shoes were changed into ballet slippers. The hair was changed into ballet bun. The pink tutu and leotard were given to the model because most young girl-ballerinas wear pink. The new transformation made her more believable as a ballet dancer. This Interactive Interpretive Ballet project successfully combines and uses many aspects of computer graphics design, including 3 D animation, Interaction and graphical user interface design. The objective is to publish Interactive Interpretative Ballet on an interactive website, allowing users to view Interactive works...|$|R
50|$|Assigned to TE 95.20 on 11 October, Lewis and RoK PC 706 {{carried out}} anti-{{shipping}} patrols between Wonsan and Hungnam and warned neutral shipping such as Japanese fishing boats {{out of the}} coastal defense zone. Two nights later, Lewis took fire from a radar-controlled enemy gun battery, observing 28 air bursts and 56 water splashes during the duel, some of which exploded as close as 20 yd while others bracketed the evading destroyer escort out to 12,000 yd. In return, the destroyer escort fired 178 high explosive and 36 white phosphorus rounds, observing one direct hit on a gun emplacement followed by a secondary explosion and fire. The following day, 14 October, Lewis spotted five sampans off Cha Ho and drove them ashore with radar-directed long range gunnery. A week later, on 21 October 1952, Lewis came {{to the aid of}} two RoK minesweepers under fire in Wonsan harbor. As she approached, at least four enemy batteries opened up on the destroyer escort. Lewis returned fire and laid down a smoke screen to cover the minesweepers retreat. Shortly thereafter the destroyer escort took two 75 mm shell hits, the first plowed into the forward fire room and pierced the No. 1 boiler - killing six fire and boilermen outright and mortally wounding a seventh; <b>Fireman</b> Milton <b>S.</b> Wheeler was awarded the Silver Star for carrying several of his injured shipmates to safety during this attack.

40|$|Marketers {{incorporate}} young, attractive, {{and thin}} models in advertisements to help catch {{the attention of}} the viewer and showcase the product on display. Recently, there has been an increase in the use of dangerously thin models in media images. There is an association between exposure to idealized body images in advertisements and eating disorders (Botta, 1999; Harrison 2 ̆ 6 Cantor, 1997; Stice, Schupak-Neuberg, Shaw, 2 ̆ 6 Stein, 1994; Tiggermann 2 ̆ 6 Pickering, 1996). Even though most women do not develop eating disorders, overexposure to exceptionally thin, attractive models may help young women develop negative body image (Thorton 2 ̆ 6 Moore, 1993). Given the possible negative effects of over-exposure to thin, beautiful models, it is important to explore whether female models who are not so thin are effective or deficient as apparel advertising stimuli. Consumer responses to plus-size versus thin models has not been widely studied. As the United States population continues to become more diverse, marketers and advertisers may want to incorporate models of various sizes to appeal to broader target markets. This study focused on college-aged women 2 ̆ 7 s attitudes and perceptions of both plus-size and thin fashion models in advertisements. Advertising stimuli were developed by digitally manipulating body size of three plus size models copied from an internet retail site and pretested for attractiveness. A thin version of each model was prepared, and a size manipulation check was conducted. Experimental data was collected from a random sample of 228 women at a Midwest university. The college-aged, female participants were contacted via university e-mail. The participants were asked to go to a website to view a full-color photograph of a fashion model that appeared to be {{about the same age as}} the participants. Participants were randomly assigned to view one of the six model stimuli, either thin or plus size, resulting in a 3 (model) x 2 (size) research design. Questionnaire items were answered on the website. The size of the model only affected one research variable, beliefs about the model 2 ̆ 7 s appearance. In contrast to expectations, participants felt that plus-size models were more attractive, appealing, credible, and eye-catching. Participants perceived the same level of similarity to both plus-size and thin models in terms of overall life style and appearance and the shape of specific body parts. Model size had no effect on perceived likeability and fashionability, and no effect on intention to purchase the model 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>outfit.</b> Covariate analysis with participant weight and BMI did not change direction of results. However, when body satisfaction was accounted for through covariance, there was a significant effect of size treatment on perceived similarity to the model 2 ̆ 7 s specific body parts in that participants felt more similar to the plus size model. This exploratory study provides insight into a relatively unexplored area of apparel advertising. Findings from this study provide support for incorporating models of various sizes in apparel advertisements...|$|R

An <b>outfit</b> <b>s</b> age, style, and method of production bespoke, wholesale bespoke, or off-the-peg offered a visible pronouncement on an individual s, particularly a male s, place in the social and economic order. In the decades that have followed, as style of dress has become increasingly informal and designer labels have overtaken design, this means of identification has become less reliable and the home-grown industry that provided the garments less economically viable. In Well Suited, Katrina Honeyman provides a volume that not only details the rise and demise of the Leeds men s and boys wholesale tailored clothing industry but, in addition, compensates for the paucity of historiographical studies of the industry that created garments from cloth (p. 1).

40|$|ABSTRACT: The US army single fuel forward policy {{mandates}} that deployed vehicles must refuel with aviation fuel JP- 8, {{and when that}} is not available, are permitted to use diesel. The US army is expected to use JP- 8 till year 2025. There is a known torque and fuel economy penalty associated with the operation of a diesel engine with JP- 8 fuel due to its lower density and viscosity, but few experimental studies suggest that kerosene-based fuels {{have the potential for}} lowering exhaust emissions (especially particulate matter) compared to typical distillate fuels such as diesel # 2. However, studies so far were typically focused on quantifying effects of simply replacing the regular diesel fuel with JP- 8, rather than fully investigating the reasons behind the observed differences. This research evaluates the effect of using JP- 8 fuel in a heavy duty diesel engine on fuel injection, combustion, performance and emissions, and subsequently utilizes the obtained insight to propose engine calibration capable of minimizing the possible penalties. Test experiments were carried out on a Detroit Diesel Corporation (DDC) <b>S</b> 60 engine <b>outfitted</b> with EGR. The results indicate that torque and fuel economy of diesel fuel can be matched without smoke or NOx penalty by increasing the duration of injection to compensate for lower density. The lower cetane number of JP- 8 led to higher ignition delay and increased premixed combustion, but adjusting of injection timing to keep the ignition timing unchanged had a minor effect. Under almost all conditions, JP- 8 led to lower NOx and PM emissions and shifted the NOx-PM tradeoff favorably...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Investigating {{the impact}} of jet fuel on diesel engine {{performance}} and emissions {{is very important for}} military vehicles, due to the US Army Single Fuel Forward Policy mandating that deployed vehicles must refuel with aviation fuel JP- 8. There is a known torque and fuel economy penalty associated with the operation of a diesel engine with JP- 8 fuel, due to its lower density and viscosity.
