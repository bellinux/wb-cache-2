5|$|American crows succumb {{easily to}} West Nile virus infection. This was {{originally}} a mosquito-borne African virus causing encephalitis in humans and livestock since about 1000 AD, and was accidentally introduced to North America in 1999, apparently by an infected air traveller who got {{bitten by a}} mosquito after arrival. It is estimated that the American crow population <b>has</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>by</b> up to 45% since 1999. Despite this decline, the crow is considered a species of least concern.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers {{characterize}} the morphology of a globular cluster {{by means of}} standard radii. These are the core radius (r'c), the half-light radius (r'h), and the tidal (or Jacobi) radius (r't). The overall luminosity of the cluster steadily decreases with distance from the core, and the core radius is the distance at which the apparent surface luminosity <b>has</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>by</b> half. A comparable quantity is the half-light radius, or {{the distance from the}} core within which half the total luminosity from the cluster is received. This is typically larger than the core radius.|$|E

25|$|The last {{expression}} {{shows that}} the feedback amplifier still has a single-time-constant behavior, but the corner frequency is now increased by the improvement factor (1 + β A0), and the gain at zero frequency <b>has</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>by</b> exactly the same factor. This behavior is called the gain–bandwidth tradeoff. In Figure 2, (1 + β A0) = 103, so AFB(0) = 105 / 103 = 100 V/V, and fC increases to 104 × 103 = 107 Hz.|$|E
25|$|Subsidence, or {{the gradual}} sinking of landforms, is another result of water scarcity. The U.S. Geological Survey {{estimates}} that subsidence has affected more than 17,000 square miles in 45 U.S. states, 80 {{percent of it}} due to groundwater usage. In some areas east of Houston, Texas the land <b>has</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>by</b> more than nine feet due to subsidence. Brownwood, a subdivision near Baytown, Texas, was abandoned due to frequent flooding caused by subsidence and has since {{become part of the}} Baytown Nature Center.|$|E
25|$|California cities, a {{destination}} for black migrants from 1940 to 1970, have changed as well. The state has lost black migrants {{for the first time}} in three decades. San Francisco has had the largest decrease in black population, 23 percent from 1990 to 2000, but Oakland, Los Angeles and San Diego also have had losses. In Los Angeles, the percentage of population that is black <b>has</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>by</b> half to 9.9% since 1970, a proportion that also reflects recent increased Hispanic and Asian immigration.|$|E

500|$|After the Trinity and Lewiston Dams were complete, the Bureau of Reclamation did not {{adhere to}} the water export limits set in the project's authorization, {{diverting}} 72percent of the total river flow {{and as much as}} 90percent at certain times. [...] On the main stem, dam construction has greatly reduced the capacity of the river to wash away excess sediment. The annual chinook salmon run <b>has</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>by</b> almost 80percent since the 1950s. In 2002, 65,000 adult salmon perished in a fish kill on the lower Trinity and Klamath rivers (the fish were mostly of Trinity stock).|$|E
500|$|The {{hydrological}} regime {{of the basin}} and Popovo Polje {{is determined by the}} flow of the Trebišnjica—a losing stream disappearing underground in the polje. The groundwater is distributed to a number of springs. Some of them are headwaters of watercourses discharging into the Neretva River to the northwest of the polje, or appearing as vruljas (submarine springs) or as headwaters of the Ombla river. Flow rate of the Ombla River, measured at the Komolac water intake plant, ranges from [...] per second, averaging [...] per second. The average <b>has</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>by</b> about [...] per second since completion of Trebišnjica Hydroelectric Power Plant and the concreting of the Trebišnjica's river bed. On the other hand, the minimum discharge was not affected by the river engineering works.|$|E

2500|$|For example, if {{a company}} has {{announced}} some bad news and its share price <b>has</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>by</b> 25%, but its CDS spread has remained unchanged, then an investor might expect the CDS spread to increase relative to the share price. [...] Therefore, a basic strategy would be to go long on the CDS spread (by buying CDS protection) while simultaneously hedging oneself by buying the underlying stock. [...] This technique would benefit {{in the event of}} the CDS spread widening relative to the equity price, but would lose money if the company's CDS spread tightened relative to its equity.|$|E
2500|$|The American Academy of Family Physicians {{predicts a}} {{shortage}} of 40,000 primary care doctors (including family practice, internal medicine, pediatrics and obstetrics/gynecology) by 2020. The number of medical students choosing the primary care specialty <b>has</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>by</b> 52% since 1997. Currently, only 2% of medical school graduates choose primary care as a career. An amendment to the Senate health bill includes $2 billion in funds over 10 years to create 2,000 new residency training slots geared toward primary care medicine and general surgery. Writing in Forbes, a physician argued {{that this is a}} [...] "tiny band-aid at best," [...] advocating full loan repayments and guaranteed positions upon graduation.|$|E
2500|$|Since the {{industrial}} revolution began, {{it is estimated that}} surface ocean pH <b>has</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>by</b> slightly more than 0.1 units on the logarithmic scale of pH, representing about a 29% increase in [...] It is expected to drop by a further 0.3 to 0.5 pH units (an additional doubling to tripling of today's post-industrial acid concentrations) by 2100 as the oceans absorb more anthropogenic , the impacts being most severe for coral reefs and the Southern Ocean. These changes are predicted to continue rapidly as the oceans take up more anthropogenic [...] from the atmosphere. The degree of change to ocean chemistry, including ocean pH, will depend on the mitigation and emissions pathways society takes.|$|E

2500|$|Since decoupling, the {{temperature}} of the background radiation <b>has</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>by</b> a factor of roughly 1,100 due to the expansion of the universe. As the universe expands, the CMB photons are redshifted, causing them to decrease in energy.
