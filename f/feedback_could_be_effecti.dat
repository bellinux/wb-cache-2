40|$|Intraspecific plant-soil {{feedback}} {{is a relationship}} in which plant affects {{the composition of the}} soil and such modified soil affects growth of the same plant species. This relationship and its intensity may be linked with plant dominance and invasiveness. Dominant species can alter the composition of the soil in their favor and thus show positive intraspecific plant-soil feedback. As the invasive species are commonly being dominant in their new environment, it can be expected that intraspecific positive plant-soil <b>feedback</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> an important factor allowing the invasive species to achieve their dominant position and become invasive. To test if the existence of positive intraspecific <b>feedback</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> a general mechanism underlying plant invasiveness I compared intraspecific plant-soil feedback in a group of invasive and introduced, but non-invasive, plants in the Czech Republic. I did this using a preselected set of 34 species - 17 invasive and 17 non-invasive. For realization of the project I used the method of two-phase experiment. The first phase is called soil conditioning - influencing of soil by the plant.

50|$|The {{technique}} was developed at EMI/Abbey Road Studios {{in the late}} 1950s, by EMI engineer Gwynne Stock. It involved delaying the recorded (dry) signal, sending it into the studio's echo chamber using a tape machine. The dry signal (without delay) was also sent to the chamber via the tape machine's replay head. The resulting sound {{was picked up by}} two condenser microphones. These microphones then fed the wet signal back to the recording console. The amount of <b>feedback</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> controlled allowing multiple delays to be sent to the reverb chamber, which could lengthen the effect's decay time.|$|R
50|$|Williamson {{eliminated}} all transformers {{except the}} output transformer (unavoidable for matching the high valve impedance {{to the low}} loudspeaker impedance) by using capacitor coupling between stages, and a split-load valve voltage amplifier stage ("phase splitter"), again capacitor-coupled, to provide antiphase signal inputs to the symmetrical push-pull output stages. There was thus a single signal transformer in the circuit; with careful design of the transformer and the feedback network significant negative <b>feedback</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> used {{before the onset of}} instability.

40|$|The {{terrestrial}} biosphere {{is a key}} regulator of atmospheric chemistry and climate. During past periods of climate change, vegetation cover and interactions between the {{terrestrial biosphere}} and atmosphere changed within decades. Modern observations show a similar responsiveness of terrestrial biogeochemistry to anthropogenically forced climate change and air pollution. Although interactions between the carbon cycle and climate have been a central focus, other biogeochemical <b>feedbacks</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> as important in modulating future climate change. Total positive radiative forcings resulting from feedbacks between the terrestrial biosphere and the atmosphere are estimated to reach up to 0. 9 or 1. 5 W m- 2 K- 1 {{towards the end of}} the twenty-first century, depending on the extent to which interactions with the nitrogen cycle stimulate or limit carbon sequestration. This substantially reduces and potentially even eliminates the cooling effect owing to carbon dioxide fertilization of the terrestrial biota. The overall magnitude of the biogeochemical <b>feedbacks</b> <b>could</b> potentially <b>be</b> similar to that of feedbacks in the physical climate system, but there are large uncertainties in the magnitude of individual estimates and in accounting for synergies between these effects. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.
