5|$|The modern law of {{criminal}} damage is mostly {{contained in the}} Criminal Damage Act 1971, which redefines or creates several offences protecting property rights. The Act provides a comprehensive structure covering merely preparatory acts to the most serious offences of arson and causing damage with intent to endanger life. As such, punishments vary from a <b>fixed</b> <b>penalty</b> to life imprisonment, and the court may order payment of compensation to a victim.|$|E

Following Leicestershire's match against Loughborough MCCU, bowler Charlie Shreck was found guilty of using obscene language or gestures.

25|$|Cole has had {{a couple}} of minor brushes with the police. On 4 March 2009 he was held after {{swearing}} in front of a police officer outside a South Kensington nightclub. He was taken to a police station and issued with an £80 <b>Fixed</b> <b>Penalty</b> Notice before being released. On 4 January 2010, Cole was convicted of a speeding offence committed on 17 November 2009. He was recorded exceeding the speed limit by doing 104mph in a 50mph zone on the A3 road in Kingston upon Thames, a residential stretch. His defence at Kingston Magistrates Court, opposing the charge in his absence, argued unsuccessfully that the police speed gun was faulty. Cole also claimed that his actions were excuseable because he was trying to evade the paparazzi. On 29 January he was fined £1000 and disqualified from driving for four months.|$|E
2500|$|United Kingdom - Leaving litter is {{an offence}} under the Environmental Protection Act 1990. This was {{extended}} by the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005 under section 18. It carries a maximum penalty of £2500 upon conviction. However, many local authorities issue <b>fixed</b> <b>penalty</b> notices under section 88 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. Often incorrectly known as [...] "on the spot fines", {{they do not}} have to be issued on the spot. Nor are they a fine.

40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} {{we set out}} the welfare {{economics}} based case for imposing cartel penalties on the cartel overcharge {{rather than on the}} more conventional bases of revenue or profits (illegal gains). To do this we undertake a systematic comparison of a penalty based on the cartel overcharge with three other <b>penalty</b> regimes: <b>fixed</b> <b>penalties,</b> penalties based on revenue, and penalties based on profits. Our analysis is the first to compare these regimes in terms of their impact on both (i) the prices charged by those cartels that do form and (ii) the number of stable cartels that form (deterrence). We show that the class of penalties based on profits is identical to the class of <b>fixed</b> <b>penalties</b> in all welfare-relevant respects. For the other three types of penalty we show that, for those cartels that do form, penalties based on the overcharge produce lower prices than those based on profit) while penalties based on revenue produce the highest prices. Further, in conjunction with the above result, our analysis of cartel stability (and thus deterrence), shows that penalties based on the overcharge out-perform those based on profits, which in turn out-perform those based on revenue in terms of their impact on each of the following welfare criteria: (a) average overcharge, (b) average consumer surplus, and (c) average total welfare...|$|R

5000|$|A second view {{puts the}} date of {{enactment}} at around 200 B.C. On {{this line of reasoning}} the Lex was enacted as a response to heavy inflation following the second Punic war, and was thus necessitated by a need to eschew an assessment of damages based on <b>fixed</b> <b>penalties.</b> However {{it has been suggested that}} the Romans may well have required the flexible assessment of damages offered by the Lex, or at least the third chapter, before this date.|$|R

50|$|In the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, heroin {{received}} a 10-to-1 ratio. Defendants responsible for 100 grams of heroin {{were subject to}} a five-year mandatory minimum, but defendants responsible for 1000 grams were subject to a ten-year mandatory minimum sentence. However, the Act imposed a 100-to-1 ratio for powder to crack cocaine. The same five-year mandatory minimum sentence applies to defendants who are held responsible for either 500 grams of powder cocaine or 5 grams of crack. The ten-year mandatory minimum applied to defendants responsible for either 5000 grams of powder cocaine or 50 grams of crack. The Sentencing Commission followed this approach when <b>fixing</b> <b>penalties</b> for powder and crack cocaine, even as it relied on empirical evidence culled from actual sentences imposed in other kinds of criminal cases to formulate the new Sentencing Guidelines.|$|R
