5|$|Meanwhile, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) and Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) {{decide not}} to get {{together}} officially until he breaks up with Jessica (Eleanor Seigler). On {{their way back to}} Scranton, they stop at Jessica's family's log cabin, where they encounter a bunch of Jessica's friends having a bachelorette party and drinking. Andy and Erin decide to bail, but Jessica returns from <b>her</b> <b>morning</b> run. After staying a while, Andy asks Jessica into the kitchen where she deduces that he is breaking up with her. Erin is surprised however when Jessica said that Andy told her he did not think Erin was relationship material. Andy does not deny saying that, instead opting to claim that he is gay and leaves awkwardly with Erin. In the car, Andy says he made those comments about Erin because he was with Jessica before Erin falls asleep. Andy decides to head back to the cabin to tell Jessica and her party that he broke up with her because he wanted to be with Erin and that she is relationship material, while Erin overhears. Jessica and her party chase Andy and Erin back to the car. Erin passionately kisses Andy inside the car while the party throws cake at them, prompting a quick getaway.|$|E
25|$|Lexington {{sailed to}} raid Kwajalein on 4 December. <b>Her</b> <b>morning</b> strike {{destroyed}} the , damaged two cruisers, {{and accounted for}} 30 enemy aircraft. Her gunners splashed two of the enemy torpedo planes that attacked at midday, but were ordered not to open fire at night as Admiral Charles Pownall then in command believed it would give their position away (he was later replaced).|$|E
25|$|When Ruetten {{returned}} {{home in the}} evening, he found his garage door open and broken glass on the driveway. In addition, Ruetten discovered that the BMW he had bought for Rasmussen as an engagement gift was missing. Because of <b>her</b> <b>morning</b> plans, he found it strange that Rasmussen would have later gone out without letting him know. The house's answering machine had not been activated, despite both of them usually activating it when leaving the house unoccupied.|$|E
60|$|What was Albinia's consternation! Her moment's petulance had undone <b>her</b> <b>morning's</b> work.|$|R

25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1735, the Duchess of Bedford started {{experiencing}} symptoms of what she believed was her third pregnancy. Whether or not <b>her</b> <b>morning</b> sickness {{was the result of}} a pregnancy is uncertain, but it soon became apparent that the Duchess had contracted tuberculosis. The illness progressed rapidly, and the Duchess was drastically losing rather than gaining weight. The Dowager Duchess insisted that her granddaughter be moved to Southampton House in Bloomsbury Square. She died there intestate on 27 September 1735, aged 25 and leaving no surviving issue.|$|E
25|$|Marie Antoinette had {{a marked}} {{influence}} on French fashion {{beginning in the}} 1780s. Around this time, {{she had begun to}} rebel against the structure of court life. She abolished <b>her</b> <b>morning</b> toilette and often escaped to the Petit Trianon with increasing frequency, leading to criticism of her exclusivity by cutting off the traditional right of the aristocracy to their monarch. Marie Antoinette found refuge from the stresses of the rigidity of court life and the scrutiny of the public eye, the ailing health of her children, and her sense of powerlessness in her marriage by carrying out a pseudo-country life in her newly constructed hameau. She and an elite circle of friends would dress in peasant clothing and straw hats and retreat to the hameau. It was out of this practice that her style of dress evolved.|$|E
500|$|<b>Her</b> <b>morning</b> ablutions {{included}} washing herself unassisted with a flannel {{rather than}} taking a shower ("an odd invention"), and applying first soap, then olive oil and powder to her face. She washed her own glass and cutlery before proceeding to lunch. She enjoyed daube (braised beef) but was not keen on boiled fish. After the meal she smoked a Dunhill cigarette (formerly a cigar, a habit she had acquired from her husband) and drank {{a small amount of}} Port wine. She enjoyed chocolate (and at the age of 112 received a delivery of 800 kilogrammes after challenging a TV presenter â€“ this was then distributed to care homes), and made herself daily a fruit salad based on banana slices and squeezed orange.|$|E

60|$|They {{walked through}} the grounds, crossed the river on the stepping-stones and found Ingua just {{finishing}} <b>her</b> <b>morning's</b> work. The child greeted them eagerly.|$|R
60|$|The slight {{streak of}} {{contempt}} in this hasty reply offended Dorothea. She {{was all the}} more susceptible about Mr. Casaubon because of <b>her</b> <b>morning's</b> trouble.|$|R

2500|$|... wears {{her hair}} parted {{in the center}} and brushed into puffs over each ear. <b>Her</b> <b>morning</b> dress has wide pagoda sleeves and is worn over undersleeves or engageantes. [...] The high {{neckline}} is set off with a white collar. American, 1857.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Her</b> <b>morning</b> {{exercises}} were famous. In her memoir, de Wolfe {{wrote that}} her daily regimen at age 70 included yoga, standing on her head, and walking on her hands. [...] "I have a regular exercise routine {{founded on the}} Yogi method," [...] Elsie said, [...] "introduced to me by Anne Vanderbilt and her daughter, Princess Murat. I stand on my head (and) I can turn cart wheels. Or I walk upside-down on my hands." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Why did {{you choose}} that plaintive thing, all about love, despair, and death? It quite breaks one's heart to hear it," [...] said Prue, pausing in a mental {{estimate}} of <b>her</b> <b>morning's</b> shopping.|$|R
60|$|She {{threw down}} her {{modelling}} tools with a fretful gesture and then nervily began to destroy <b>her</b> <b>morning's</b> work, patting the clay aimlessly {{here and there}} until once more it became a shapeless mass.|$|R
2500|$|Thorvard {{took his}} men and began tying {{up all the}} men from the other camp [...] in a sneak attack while they were still sleeping. [...] Freydis had each man killed on the spot if they belonged to Finnbogi and Helgi's crew. [...] Soon only the 5 women were left alive, but no man would dare kill them. [...] In {{response}} Freydis says, [...] "Hand me an axe." [...] She made quick work of slaying the women and she became very pleased with how well <b>her</b> <b>morning</b> had gone. [...] She told all involved that anyone who speaks a word of the events would be killed. [...] The plan was to say that the brothers chose to stay behind in Vinland while Freydis returned to Greenland.|$|E
2500|$|Slim buys a {{house and}} changes her name to Erin Ann Shleeter. Although their future looks bright after a visit from Joe, Mitch's friend tracks them down, passing the {{information}} on to Mitch. Mitch comes to the area, and hides in Slim's house. As she is going about <b>her</b> <b>morning</b> routine, to her horror, Mitch suddenly appears from the shadows in her hallway, saying he wants Slim back, promising [...] "it will be different." [...] When she refuses, he attacks, waking Gracie, who runs to help her mother, and jerks on his hair. [...] Mitch flings Gracie to the floor, which creates a diversion, and allows an opportunity for Slim to retaliate with pepper spray. Snatching up Gracie, as Mitch rolls {{on the floor in}} pain, she is prepared for a fast get-away, having an escape plan. A car chase ensues between Slim and Robbie (Noah Wyle, revealed earlier as Mitch's [...] "wing man" [...] during the encounter at the diner years before) while Gracie screams in the background. Realizing she cannot live her life in fear, Slim goes into hiding in San Francisco, hires a woman who looks like her to keep her cover, and sends Gracie away to Hawaii with her best friend Ginny {{to get her out of}} harm's way. She prepares herself with a self-defense trainer (Bruce A. Young) who teaches her Krav Maga, since self-defense is not murder. During her training, he gives Slim the final lesson - if Mitch knocks her down, she is to hold on to his voice and awaken when he is about to attack or kick her. She returns to Los Angeles, breaks into Mitch's new home and waits for him there to return home from work, after hiding his guns and blocking the phone connections, so he cannot call the police. When he arrives, Slim makes her presence known once he realizes someone's there. She approaches him to begin fighting, but when he says he cannot hit her, she asks him why he could do it before when she was defenseless. She provokes him, and in the ensuing fight, Slim uses her new skills, beating Mitch until he becomes unconscious. After an opportunity to kill him with an object, she cannot bear to do it and throws the object away. She calls Ginny saying she cannot kill him, and while on the phone Mitch hits her from behind with a lamp. Slim puts into practice what she learned in her training and trips, beats and kicks him in the chest and sends him off a balcony to his death. She calls the police, who rule her actions as self-defense.|$|E

60|$|Mrs Kelly was {{somewhat}} quieted by her son's guarantee, and, muttering that she couldn't {{afford to be}} wasting <b>her</b> <b>mornings</b> in that way, diligently commenced weighing out innumerable three-halfporths of brown sugar, and Martin went about his own business.|$|R

60|$|The {{little town}} of Versailles had scarce opened its eyes to the new day when the clink of a horse's hoofs on her cobble stones roused her from <b>her</b> <b>morning</b> sleep.|$|E
6000|$|After that {{it became}} the daily program for Patsy to spend <b>her</b> <b>mornings</b> in Aunt Jane's little garden, and {{although}} they sometimes clashed, and, as Phibbs told Beth, [...] "had dreadful fights," [...] they both enjoyed these hours very much.|$|R
50|$|At {{the age of}} 19, Pe'er {{joined the}} Israeli {{military}}, as military service is mandatory in Israel.

6000|$|Miss Churton moved {{towards the}} door, then paused and spoke coldly: [...] "Do you wish me to understand, mother, that Miss Affleck is to devote <b>her</b> <b>mornings</b> to you, and that I shall {{only have the}} late hours to teach her in?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You'd {{be having}} company last night, sir?" [...] Mrs. Hollings remarked inquisitively. Mrs. Hollings was an elderly widow, who devoted {{two hours of}} <b>her</b> <b>morning</b> to {{cleaning}} my rooms and preparing my breakfast.|$|E

60|$|Sir Roland of Provence {{remained}} in suspense whether to be a novice or an irrevocably pledged Hospitalier. The latter was most probable; and when Adeline's feelings had been minutely analysed, Miss Conway {{discovered that she}} had better not show <b>her</b> <b>morning's</b> work to <b>her</b> sisters.|$|R
60|$|Mounting the stairs, whose old oak {{banisters}} {{on either}} side were a real joy, {{she felt she was}} stupid to let vague, sordid rumours, which, after all, affected her but indirectly, disturb <b>her</b> <b>morning's</b> work. And entering Stephen's dressing-room she stood looking at his boots.|$|R
60|$|His mortified {{face was}} {{recognised}} by the landlady, returning from <b>her</b> <b>morning's</b> {{visit to the}} shops. The gentleman looked, she thought, {{as if he had}} received bad news! She not unnaturally connected his appearance with her lodger. Tapping on the girl's door, and receiving no answer, she went in.|$|R
