5|$|This former quarry has undulating {{calcareous}} grassland which is grazed by rabbits and cattle. It has a rich variety of flora, including sheep's <b>fescue,</b> dwarf thistle, mouse-ear hawkweed, wild thyme and common rock-rose. There are many bryophytes and lichens.|$|E
5|$|The Itcha Range area {{is home to}} a {{grassland}} ecosystem that has not been found elsewhere in southern or central British Columbia. It is dominated by communities of Altai <b>fescue</b> and lichen. Extensive and diverse alpine and subalpine vegetation is also present in the area, some species of which are at the northernmost or southernmost of their range.|$|E

5|$|Very uneven meadow with mounds {{formed by}} the yellow meadow ant Lasius flavus, fox earths, and spoil dumped during former gravel works. Grasses {{especially}} false oat-grass, Yorkshire fog; also cock's-foot, common bent and sheep's <b>fescue.</b> Herbs include common vetch, meadow vetchling, white clover, yarrow, ribwort plantain.|$|E
5|$|Native grasses {{thrive in}} many parts of the {{monument}} despite competition from medusahead rye, Dalmatian toadflax, cheatgrass, and other invasive species. Bunchgrasses in the park include basin wildrye, Idaho <b>fescue,</b> Thurber's needlegrass, Indian ricegrass, and bottlebrush squirreltail, among others. Native grasses that form sod in parts of the monument include Sandberg's bluegrass and other bluegrass species. Reed canary grass, if mowed, also forms sod along stream banks.|$|E
5|$|Plant use of {{endophytic}} {{fungi in}} defense {{is a very}} common phenomenon. Most plants have endophytes, microbial organisms that live within them. While some cause disease, others protect plants from herbivores and pathogenic microbes. Endophytes can help the plant by producing toxins harmful to other organisms that would attack the plant, such as alkaloid producing fungi which are common in grasses such as tall <b>fescue</b> (Festuca arundinacea).|$|E
50|$|The larvae feed on {{the roots}} and stem bases of various grasses, {{including}} meadowgrasses, <b>fescues,</b> slimstem reedgrass, and wavy hairgrass.|$|R

5|$|Russian olive and {{tamarisk}} or salt cedar trees now {{dominate the}} Jordan River floodplain where willow trees and cottonwood trees would {{once have been}} found. Plant species such as foxtail barley, saltgrass, rabbitbrush, cattails and other reeds are still found in small pockets along the river. Exotic pasture grasses such as orchard grass, bluegrass, redtop bentgrass, quackgrass, wheatgrass and <b>fescue</b> have become the common species of grass. The vulnerable flower, Ute's Ladies'-tresses, {{can also be found}} along the river.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the site {{is made up of}} species-rich grassland (subcommunity MG5c), which comprises three dominant species of grass and several other grass species at lower abundances. The dominant species are Red <b>Fescue</b> (Festuca rubra), Common Bent (Agrostis capillaris) and Yorkshire Fog (Holcus lanatus). The less abundant species of grass include, Crested Dog's-tail (Cynosurus cristatus), Heath-grass (Danthonia decumbens) and Cocksfoot (Dactylis glomerata). The subcommunity also has many broad-leaved herbs including Common Knapweed (Centaurea nigra), Tormentil (Potentilla erecta), Devils-bit scabious (Succisa pratensis) and Betony (Stachys officinalis).|$|E
5|$|Grasses such as sea {{couch grass}} and sea poa grass are {{important}} in the driest areas of the marshes, and on the coastal dunes, where marram grass, sand couch-grass, lyme-grass and red <b>fescue</b> help to bind the sand. Sea holly and sand sedge are other specialists of this arid habitat, and petalwort is a nationally rare bryophyte found on damper dunes. Bird's-foot trefoil, pyramidal orchid, bee orchid and carline thistle flower on the dunes, and Holkham's Corsican pines shelter creeping lady's tresses and yellow bird's nest orchids. The shingle ridges on Scolt Head Island and from Blakeney Point east to Salthouse attract biting stonecrop, sea campion, yellow horned poppy, sea thrift and sea beet. Sea barley is a scarcer species of this habitat.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{larval food}} plants are bents (various Agrostis species), <b>fescues</b> (various Festuca species) and meadow-grasses (various Poa species). Common couch (Elymus repens) is also used.|$|R

In 1973, working under Professor Alexey Konstantinovich Skvortsov he defended his PhD thesis, titled [...] "Systematics <b>fescues</b> group Intravaginales Hack. section Festuca European part of Russia and the Caucasus." [...] Subsequently, Alexeev was going to create a monograph of <b>fescues</b> worldwide. According to his requests herbarium specimens were sent to Moscow from London, New York, Paris, Copenhagen, Geneva, Washington and other botanical repositories.|$|R

5|$|Grasses such as sea {{couch grass}} and sea poa grass are {{important}} in the driest areas of the marshes, and on the coastal dunes, where marram grass, sand couch-grass, lyme-grass and red <b>fescue</b> help to bind the sand. Sea holly and sand sedge are other specialists of this arid habitat, and petalwort is a nationally rare bryophyte found on damper dunes. Bird's-foot trefoil, pyramidal orchid, bee orchid, lesser centaury and carline thistle flower on the more stable dunes, where the rare Jersey cudweed and grey hair-grass are also found. The narrow 5-km (3-mi) belt of pines shelters creeping lady's tresses and yellow bird's nest.|$|E
5|$|Grassland on the Helvellyn range {{has been}} heavily overgrazed for many years, yet it {{supports}} {{a diversity of}} acid grassland species including sheep's <b>fescue</b> (Festuca ovina) on the summit ridge, matgrass (Nardus stricta) on the middle slopes, and fescue-bent swards on the lower slopes. The Nardus grasslands are the haunt of the scarce mountain ringlet butterfly (Erebia epiphron), the only alpine species of butterfly found in Britain. Acidic flushes (areas of water seepage) with their carpets of sphagnum mosses are common. Less common are basic flushes, which support a greater diversity of species.|$|E
5|$|Roxy Ann Peak's high {{biodiversity}} {{is due to}} {{its wide}} range of elevations and its location between the Cascade, Klamath, and Eastern Cascade ecoregions. The lower slopes of the peak support chaparral, oak savanna, and open grassland. Scattered California black oak, Oregon white oak, and Pacific madrone trees grow in these areas, as do sclerophyllous shrubs such as birchleaf mountain mahogany, sticky whiteleaf manzanita, buckbrush, antelope bitterbrush, and Pacific poison oak. Common grasses include blue wildrye and prairie Junegrass. Wildflowers including Southern Oregon buttercup, common yarrow, and Tolmie star-tulip also grow in these regions. At higher elevations, the vegetation transitions to mixed coniferous forest, dominated by Douglas fir, ponderosa pine, incense cedar, western juniper, and Pacific madrone trees. Shrubs such as common snowberry, bearbrush, greenleaf manzanita, sticky whiteleaf manzanita, deerbrush, and Pacific poison oak make up the understory of the forest, along with herbaceous plants such as creeping snowberry and Idaho <b>fescue.</b>|$|E

5|$|The highest {{elevation}} forests contain whitebark pine, Engelmann spruce, subalpine fir, and limber pine, including the largest individual whitebark pine in North America. Based on tree ring chronologies, {{some of the}} whitebark pines {{are believed to be}} 700 to 1000 or more years old. The {{highest elevation}} forests typically have understories of grasses and forbs that are resistant to freezing at any point of the growing season. Willows, alders, cottonwoods, and sedges are found in riparian areas. Ponderosa pine occupy the dry, lower elevations near {{the western edge of the}} forest and historically persisted due to the occurrence of frequent non-lethal fires. Ponderosa pine forest understories typically consist of perennial grasses such as Idaho <b>fescue</b> and bluebunch wheatgrass. In the slightly moister ponderosa pine forests grasses such as pinegrass are found with a cover of shrubs including white spirea, common snowberry, and mallow ninebark.|$|E
25|$|Herbage grass {{varieties}} bred {{and introduced}} to UK agriculture include Hatchmere Perennial Ryegrass in 1899, Ellesmere Perennialized Italian Ryegrass (1907), Pickmere Perennial Ryegrass (1932), Delamere Cocksfoot (1936), Oakmere Timothy (1940), Flaxmere (1952), Gartons Tall <b>Fescue</b> (1955), Marbury Meadow <b>Fescue</b> (1957), Barmere Timothy (1958).|$|E
25|$|Twenty {{acres of}} fields around {{the centre of}} the hamlet of Little Langdale were {{designated}} a SSSI in 1989 as one of the only four remaining meadows of SSSI quality in South Cumbria. The habitat varies from floodplain near the Brathay to higher, dryer haymeadow with both being home {{to a wide variety of}} herb, grass and flower species. Grasses found in these meadows include sweet vernal-grass, wood-crane's-bill, common bent, crested dog's tail, red <b>fescue,</b> meadow <b>fescue,</b> Yorkshire-fog, smooth meadow-grass, rough meadow-grass, cock's-foot, soft brome and perennial rye-grass. Perhaps the rarest species found there is the globe-flower.|$|E

25|$|The {{area is a}} {{haven for}} seabirds such as fulmar, petrel, cormorant, shag, redshank, {{guillemot}} and razorbill, while the weathered rock formations host a number of plants including sea spleenwort, hare's-foot trefoil, vernal squill, sea <b>fescue</b> and frog orchid.|$|E
25|$|The {{area near}} the cave {{entrance}} is dominated by Western juniper and Ponderosa pine with big sagebrush, bitterbrush, mountain mahogany, rabbitbrush, and a veriety of desert grasses as the main ground cover. Common grasses in this area include Idaho <b>fescue,</b> bunch grass, and bluebunch wheatgrass.|$|E
25|$|Extensive {{cultivation}} has disturbed the habitats of some birds which {{nest and}} {{feed on the}} <b>fescue</b> grassland. However, the horned lark and meadowlark have managed {{to adapt to the}} new conditions. Song sparrow, vesper sparrow, and American goldfinch can often be seen in open areas.|$|E
50|$|They are {{characterized}} by bunch-like growth habits. Lolium is native to Europe, Asia and northern Africa, {{as well as being}} cultivated and naturalized in Australia, the Americas, and various oceanic islands. Ryegrasses are naturally diploid, with 2n = 14, and are closely related to the <b>fescues</b> (Festuca).|$|R
40|$|Red thread {{occurs in}} the spring and fall during humid periods when the air {{temperatures}} are between 16 Â°C and 24 Â°C (60 Â°F and 75 Â°F). The disease is especially severe on slow-growing nitrogen-deficient turf. Bluegrasses (Poa spp.), <b>fescues</b> (Festuca spp.), ryegrasses (Lolium spp.), and bentgrasses (Agrostis spp.) can be affected. Fine-leaved <b>fescues</b> and some ryegrasses are particularly susceptible. The first noticeable symptoms are water-soaked patches of grass in the spring. Infected grass blades soon die and fade to a bleach-tan color when dry. Infected leaf blades are often interspersed with healthy unaffected leaf blades giving the grass a ragged appearance (Fig. 1). In severe cases, most leaf blades may be killed and diseased grass looks scorched or yellowed in irregularly-shaped or circular patches Symptoms and Signs Figure 2 : A close-up of the "Red Threads " (provided by Dr...|$|R
