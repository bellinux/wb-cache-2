25|$|However, it is {{a simple}} {{accounting}} error to think, that the gross profit share of value-added is equal to true business profit, or that constant capital invested in physical assets (<b>fixed</b> <b>equipment</b> and inventories) represents the capital that an enterprise owns, other than a fund to pay wages, or that profits from product sales are the only net income the corporation has. That can be verified from any corporate balance sheet. If an enterprise borrows or leases capital for production, rather than investing its own, this affects the cost of capital that is tied up at any particular time. How the profitability of capital is accounted for, depends very much on who owns the capital, as distinct from who borrows it, or who uses it. So the rate of profit concept which Marx uses in his theoretical analysis of capitalist production (i.e. S/(C+V)) differs from the actual business concept of the rate of profit, because it disregards all sorts of financial and ownership issues, and because it concerns only part of the total circuit of capital.|$|E
