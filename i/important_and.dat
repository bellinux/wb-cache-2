The frog is the most <b>important</b> <b>and</b> is represented in the numbers from one (ata) to twenty (gueta) five times, because the Muisca didn't have hieroglpyhs for the numbers 11 to 19, so used the numerals one to nine again in combination with ten; fifteen was thus ten-and-five; qhicħâ hɣcſcâ.|$|E

5|$|Dazzle {{was adopted}} by the Admiralty in the UK, and then by the United States Navy, with little evaluation. Each ship's dazzle pattern was unique to avoid making classes of ships {{instantly}} recognisable to the enemy.

5|$|In {{the sources}} {{considered}} so far, Troilus' only narrative function is his death.
