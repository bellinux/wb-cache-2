25|$|In {{spite of}} solid and {{consistent}} ratings, Leave It to Beaver never {{climbed into the}} Nielsen's top-30 though similar sitcoms of the period like <b>Father</b> <b>Knows</b> <b>Best,</b> The Donna Reed Show, The Real McCoys, and Dennis the Menace managed to do so.|$|E
25|$|A {{comparison}} of how children {{interact with their}} brothers and sisters on such 1950s situation comedy television programs as Leave It To Beaver and <b>Father</b> <b>Knows</b> <b>Best</b> with those on such 1980s programs as The Cosby Show and Family Ties found that children interacted more positively in the early period but were important and central – if more conflictual – to the main story action in the 1980s.|$|E

25|$|ABC's initial {{coverage}} of the incident was very disorganized. Cochran, ABC's primary news anchor, was on his lunch break when word of the assassination attempt first broke and the network had to call {{him back to the}} studio. Silverman was the voice accompanying ABC's first bulletin, broadcast during a rerun episode of <b>Father</b> <b>Knows</b> <b>Best</b> that was airing on a majority of the network's affiliates in the Mountain Time Zone at the time; the surviving videotape of ABC's initial bulletins appears to have been recorded by then-affiliate KTVK in Phoenix, as it contains the interruption of <b>Father</b> <b>Knows</b> <b>Best.</b> The first on-camera report was given by Goddard in the network's news studio, which was too far away from the teletype machines. Goddard then moved to the newsroom and was joined by the returning Cochran, and the technical crew began constructing an impromptu news set around them (ABC did not have studio space ready for such an occasion; NBC had a flash studio in its newsroom and CBS' reports came directly from their own newsroom as they had since they launched an evening newscast earlier in 1963). Cochran and Goddard were forced to stand and awkwardly hold microphones and headsets so they could report the information.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to other popular comedies {{of the era}} (such as <b>Father</b> <b>Knows</b> <b>Best,</b> Leave It to Beaver, and The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet), which depicted their characters in comfortable, middle class suburban environments, the set design for The Honeymooners reflected the blue collar existence of its characters. The Kramdens lived in a small, painfully sparsely furnished two-room apartment (the main set) in a tenement building at least four stories high (the Kramdens were {{on the third floor}} and the Nortons' were one floor above them), badly aired and with insufficient lighting. They used the single main room as the kitchen, dining and living room. It consisted of a functional table and chairs, a plain chest of drawers, a curtainless window with a view of a fire escape, a noisy sink, and an outdated icebox. The Kramdens' bedroom never was seen, although in the episode about Ed Norton's sleepwalking the Nortons' bedroom is. One of the few other sitcoms about a blue collar family was The Life of Riley, whose first season (1949–50) had featured Jackie Gleason in the lead role, although veteran movie actor William Bendix, who had originated the role of Chester A. Riley on the radio show, thereafter took over the role on television.|$|E
500|$|The Simpsons {{takes place}} in the fictional American town of Springfield in an unknown and impossible-to-determine U.S. state. The show is {{intentionally}} evasive in regard to Springfield's location. Springfield's geography, and that of its surroundings, contains coastlines, deserts, vast farmland, tall mountains, or whatever the story or joke requires. Groening has said that Springfield has much in common with Portland, Oregon, the city where he grew up. The name [...] "Springfield" [...] is a common one in America and appears in 22 states. Groening has said that he named it after Springfield, Oregon, and the fictitious Springfield which was the setting of the series <b>Father</b> <b>Knows</b> <b>Best.</b> He [...] "figured out that Springfield {{was one of the most}} common names for a city in the U.S. In anticipation of the success of the show, I thought, 'This will be cool; everyone will think it's their Springfield.' And they do." [...] An astronomer and fan of the show, Phil Plait, humorously noticed that The Simpsons could be set in Australia, because the moon in Springfield faces the wrong way to be an American location.|$|E

All the children felt their existences were restricted within the confines of their house. Encarna (the mother) reasoned with the children, telling them that their <b>father</b> <b>knew</b> what is <b>best</b> for them and was simply protecting them from the wickedness of the outside world. The comfort and luxury of the house, she insisted, should be good enough to spend their extra time. The children thought otherwise and demanded their mother to persuade their father to grant them more freedom and to live life without his lingering presence.|$|R
500|$|Filming for {{the pilot}} was {{initially}} intended {{to take place in}} an actual Los Angeles neighborhood until the production team realized the difficulties that would ensue. [...] Instead they chose Colonial Street, a backlot street set at Universal Studios Hollywood. The house sets on Colonial Street had been used in numerous film and television productions as early as 1946. Many of the sets, whose styles ranged from contemporary to Victorian to ranch, were remodeled to create a uniform neighborhood. Cherry and production designer Thomas A. Walsh wanted the street to recall the Eisenhower era and convey traditional American values, but appear modern at the same time. Walsh viewed episodes of <b>Father</b> <b>Knows</b> <b>Best,</b> My Three Sons, and Leave It to Beaver, among other television series, to capture the visual style of classic conservative America. Walsh commented, [...] "We were trying to honor that sensibility {{and at the same time}} create an everyplace that was neither a red state nor a blue state." [...] Instead, Walsh insisted that the street was in [...] "kind of a pink state. We're somewhere in the middle of America's soul." [...] Refurbishments of the house sets, which included building interior rooms, cost around $700,000. While Walsh strove for a visually unified look for the street as a whole, he carefully designed the interior of each home to reflect the tastes and budgets of the characters.|$|E

40|$|This essay {{argues that}} Harper Lee’s {{unexpected}} but welcomed second novel, Go Set a Watchman, {{is both a}} fitting and a disappointing sequel to her beloved debut, To Kill a Mockingbird. It is fitting because it confirms that Atticus Finch, the knowing father of the first novel, despite his noble defense of a falsely accused Black man in the Depression Era South, never was, on closer inspection, much of a Progressive, even on matters of race. That, for many of his admirers, has proved hugely, almost Oedipally, disappointing. But what fits equally well, and disappoints even more, is his adoring daughter Scout’s coming of age. Though twenty-six in the second novel and re-settled in New York City, she {{is still very much}} a child of the segregated South. In her second novel as much as in her first, Harper Lee has her heroine learn that, on the things that really matter, her <b>father</b> ultimately <b>knows</b> <b>best.</b> The second novel’s very late arrival thus reminds us of what history has long since taught: “With all deliberate speed” will prove far too fast a pace for some very respectable Southern white folks, both real and imagined...|$|R

2500|$|In 1957, the radio, {{film and}} {{television}} writers Joe Connelly and Bob Mosher developed a concept for a TV show about childhood and family life featuring a fictional suburban couple and their children.

2500|$|At that time, As the World Turns was {{the runaway}} top-rated daytime show, and ABC and NBC made no {{concerted effort to}} compete with CBS in the time slot; as a result, the other {{television}} networks weren't {{on the air in}} the Eastern and Central Time Zones. Various programs were being broadcast through their affiliate stations. From their main headquarters in New York, WABC-TV's first bulletin came from Ed Silverman at 1:42p.m. EST, also interrupting a rerun of <b>Father</b> <b>Knows</b> <b>Best</b> in the Mountain Time Zone on the ABC-TV network; ABC-TV was not feeding programming to its affiliates in the Pacific Time Zone at that hour. Three minutes later, Don Pardo broke into WNBC-TV's local rerun of Bachelor Father with the news, saying (reading AP bulletin) 'PRESIDENT KENNEDY WAS SHOT TODAY JUST AS HIS MOTORCADE LEFT DOWNTOWN DALLAS. MRS. KENNEDY JUMPED UP AND GRABBED MR. KENNEDY. SHE CRIED 'OH NO!' THE MOTORCADE SPED ON.'

At 1:53p.m. (EST), NBC broke into programming with a NBC Network bumper slide and Chet Huntley, Bill Ryan, and Frank McGee informing the viewers what was going on as it happened. However, NBC's camera was not ready and the coverage was limited to audio-only reports as CBS' coverage had been to that point.
