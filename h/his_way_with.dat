5|$|Thalaba {{travels to}} the land of Aloadin, who owns a great garden paradise, and he is invited to feast with the people, but he is unwilling to imbibe alcohol or be taken in by the dancing women that seek to entice him. The temptations {{overwhelm}} him {{to the point where he}} can no longer tolerate them and he flees. Shortly after leaving, he discovers one of the women being attacked by a man wanting to have <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>with</b> her. It is revealed that the woman was Oneiza, who was captured, and that Aloadin was a sorcerer. After saving Oneiza, Thalaba is determined to stop the sorcerer and he ends up killing him. Following this, they are praised by a Sultan that Aloadin wanted to kill, and Thalaba decides to marry Oneiza. Before they can finish their marriage, she dies and Thalaba is left to mourn over her grave. While mourning, a spirit that appears to be Oneiza begins to haunt Thalaba and claim that God disapproves of the young warrior. However, Moath comes and is able to recognise the spirit as a vampire. After killing the vampire, the real Oneiza comes to guide Thalaba onwards.|$|E

25|$|Mercury {{might have}} helped on the musical {{arrangements}} {{based on the fact}} that (as it has been recalled by former bassists and the band themselves) they were in a more collaborative period in the pre-studio days and he was usually the one getting <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>with</b> structural ideas. While it is highly possible that he contributed ideas to the song (the modulation types and the expanded form are closer to his style than to May's), the bottom line is that even in that case Mercury would be more a co-arranger than a co-writer per se (like George Martin on The Beatles' songs).|$|E

25|$|Beginning {{with the}} five works of Chrétien de Troyes, Gawain became a very popular figure in French chivalric romances in the later 12th century. Chrétien uses Gawain as a major {{character}} and establishes some characteristics that pervade later depictions, including his unparalleled courteousness and <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>with</b> women. His romances set the pattern often followed in later works in which Gawain serves as an ally to the protagonist and a model of knighthood to whom others are compared. However, in Chrétien's later romances, especially Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart and Perceval, the Story of the Grail, the title heroes prove morally superior to Gawain, who follows the rules of courtliness to the letter rather than the spirit.|$|E
25|$|On {{the evening}} of 16 May, Navarro {{launched}} a sortie against the French siege lines in which Dugommier was wounded. The Spanish soldiers nearly caught the French army commander, but he was rescued by a body of grenadiers from the 28th Demi-brigade. The French finally pushed their adversaries back into the forts. On 23 May Dugommier ordered an attack on Fort Saint-Elme which failed due to poor coordination. The garrison asked for surrender terms, but the French conditions were too harsh, so the defenders slipped away to Collioure and Port-Vendres. The French siege guns quickly reduced Port-Vendres and its garrison retreated to Collioure. On 24 May Navarro received news that Admiral Federico Carlos Gravina y Nápoli was on <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>with</b> a fleet to evacuate his troops.|$|E

The mother sends Chanie on <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>with</b> dried moose meat and tells him to turn right at the tracks to head back to the school. The girl gives him a glass jar that holds seven matches. Chanie leaves the cabin, resolved to find his two friends and their uncle. However, when he reunites with them, the uncle tells him he cannot stay and that he must return to the school. He tells Chanie he can beat the impending bad weather if he travels quickly.|$|E

25|$|General MacArthur {{wanted to}} fight <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>with</b> Allied troops to {{liberate}} Java in 1944–45 but was ordered not to by the joint chiefs and President Roosevelt. The Japanese occupation thus officially ended with Japanese surrender in the Pacific and two days later Sukarno declared Indonesian Independence. However Indonesian forces would spend {{the next four years}} fighting the Dutch for independence. American restraint from fighting their way into Java certainly saved many Japanese, Javanese, Dutch and American lives. On the other hand, Indonesian independence would have likely been achieved more swiftly and smoothly had MacArthur had his way and American troops occupied Java. A later UN report stated that four million people died in Indonesia {{as a result of the}} Japanese occupation. About 2.4 million people died in Java from famine during 1944–45.|$|E

Meanwhile, the Witch-king confronts Gandalf, who is joined by the party in the fight. During the battle, they hear the horns of the Rohirrim, and the Witch-king flees. The party head to the citadel {{at the top of}} the city, where they witness the death of the insane Denethor at the hands of Gandalf. They then learn that Aragorn is on <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>with</b> the Army of the Dead. The battle moves to the Pelennor Fields as the Rohirrim charge the Mordor army. The Witch-king attacks Théoden, and Éowyn comes to his aid. The party join her as she fights and they are able to defeat him. Soon thereafter Aragorn arrives with the Army of the Dead, who wipe out the Mordor army.|$|E
25|$|The bishop's reeve in the {{southern}} Grisons, Benedikt Fontana, {{was forced to leave}} his seat on the Fürstenburg at Burgeis in the Vinschgau. He had called repeatedly to have strong troops sent to interfere with the preparations of the Habsburg army. The Three Leagues finally complied and assembled an army of about 6,300 men at Zuoz and marched to the Val Müstair. They knew that their time was running out, because they had news of Maximilian being on <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>with</b> reinforcements. But the Letzi seemed an insurmountable barrier. The Habsburg army numbered some 12,000 men, of which 2,000 manned the fortifications themselves, while another 1,200 covered the flanks. Castle Rotund at Taufers in front of the barrier was also manned with Habsburg troops, and 200 men guarded the bridge at Marengo behind the Letzi. The rest of the Habsburg army camped at the villages in the Vinschgau.|$|E

Yuuko tries to cover for her daughters and pleads with him to take her instead. He {{considers}} this and tells Yuuko he might spare her daughters if she can prove her worth. Yuuko gives him a very long blowjob while her two daughters watch. When Kimura seems pleased at her performance, Yuuko thinks she has won her daughters' freedom. Instead, Kimura reveals that he will never change his mind {{and that they are}} all there to stay. Yuuko breaks down in the end, Manaka breaks next and finally Aoi as well. The game ends with the ominous title card that as a new day starts the Kiryu family horror has 'only just begun'.|$|E
25|$|Naaman, the {{commander}} of the army of the king of Aram, was a great warrior, but he was a leper. The girl who waited on Naaman's wife was an Israelite whom the Arameans had taken captive, and she told Naaman's wife that if Naaman went to Elisha in Samaria, then Elisha would cure Naaman of his leprosy. Naaman told his lord the king of Aram what the girl said, and the king of Aram sent Naaman on <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>with</b> a letter to the king of Israel. Naaman departed, taking with him ten talents of silver, 6,000 pieces of gold, and ten changes of clothes. Naaman brought the king of Israel the letter, which asked the king of Israel to cure Naaman of his leprosy. When the king of Israel read the letter, he rent his clothes and complained that he was not God with power over life and death, but the king of Aram must have been seeking some pretext to attack Israel.|$|E
500|$|... "Lovers in Japan" [...] {{received}} high commendations from critics. Alexis Petridis of The Guardian {{review of}} the album, wrote: [...] "Chris Martin's melodies... shine: even his loudest detractor could hardly deny <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>with</b> a tune as evidenced here by '42' and 'Lovers in Japan'." [...] Evan Sawdey of PopMatters remarked that the song is [...] "stunning, jaw-dropping highlight". He added that [...] "Martin pounds away at a bouncy toy-piano melody... leading into a chorus where guitarist Jonny Buckland gets to unleash {{what might be the}} catchiest guitar riff he's written... (and yes, he absolutely bathes in the moment)." [...] Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle described [...] "Lovers in Japan" [...] as a [...] "joyous, romantic anthem that combines wistful rock riffs and gorgeous piano". He also wrote that the song is one of [...] "the disc's best moments".|$|E

2500|$|After {{the end of}} Roman rule in Britain, {{the area}} was at the {{southern}} edge of the Welsh kingdom of Ergyng. [...] The only evidence of continuing settlement at Monmouth is a record of a 7th-century church, at an unknown location within the town, dedicated to the Welsh saint Cadoc. [...] In 1056, the area was devastated by the Welsh prince Gruffydd ap Llywelyn, on <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>with</b> an army of Welsh, Saxons and Danes to defeat Ralph, Earl of Hereford and sack the Saxon burh at Hereford, [...] to the north.|$|E
2500|$|There {{is ample}} {{reason to believe}} that, if the other two {{divisions}} had fought with the tenacity of Elbert’s command, things might have turned out differently, especially since General Andrew Williamson was on <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>with</b> 1200 men and General Griffith Rutherford was coming with 800 men to reinforce the army at Brier. [...] As it was, General Lincoln’s plan to win control of the South and bring the war to an end resulted in disaster. General Ashe was later accused of cowardice for leaving the field of battle while Elbert was still engaged, but since nothing could be proved, a court of inquiry found Ashe only guilty of gross neglect.|$|E

2500|$|The poem {{is divided}} into twelve [...] "books". Its first half {{describes}} how the evil priest Kehama is able to gain significant amounts of demonic power in a quest to become a god. This is interrupted when his son Arvalan is killed after attempting to have <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>with</b> Kailyal, a peasant girl. After {{the death of his}} son, Kehama begins to wage war upon Yamen, the god of death, and curses Ladurlad, his son's killer. However, the curse allows Ladurlad the ability to become a hero of significant strength, and he uses that power to work with the Hindu gods in a quest to defeat Kehama and ensure the safety of Kailyal. Eventually, Ladurlad is able to defeat Kehama and is freed from his curse.|$|E
2500|$|Production {{started for}} the 1963 model year and ended in 1967. Introducing a new name, [...] "Sting Ray", the 1963 model was the first year for a Corvette coupé and it {{featured}} a distinctive tapering rear deck (a feature that later reappeared on the 1971 [...] "Boattail" [...] Buick Riviera) with, for 1963 only, a split rear window. The Sting Ray featured hidden headlamps, non-functional hood vents, and an independent rear suspension. Corvette chief engineer Zora Arkus-Duntov never liked the split rear window because it blocked rear vision, but Mitchell thought {{it to be a}} key part of the entire design. Maximum power for 1963 was [...] and was raised to [...] in 1964. Options included electronic ignition, the breakerless magnetic pulse-triggered Delcotronic first offered on some 1963 Pontiac models. On 1964 models the decorative hood vents were eliminated and Duntov, the Corvette's chief engineer, got <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>with</b> the split rear window changed to a full width window.|$|E
2500|$|Alcibiades {{thought at}} the time that Socrates really only wanted him sexually, and by letting Socrates have <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>with</b> him he would entice Socrates to teach him {{everything}} he knew (217a). Yet Socrates made no move, and Alcibiades began to pursue Socrates [...] "as if I were the lover and he my young prey!" [...] (217c). When Socrates continually rebuffed him, Alcibiades began to view Socrates as the only true and worthy lover he had ever had. So he told Socrates that it seemed to him now that nothing could be more important than becoming the best man he could be, and Socrates was best fit to help him reach that aim (218c-d). Socrates responded that if he did have this power, why would he exchange his true (inner) beauty for the image of beauty that Alcibiades would provide. Furthermore, Alcibiades might be wrong and Socrates may be of no use to him (218e-219a). Alcibiades spent the night sleeping beside Socrates yet, to the deep humiliation of Alcibiades, Socrates made no sexual attempt (219b-d).|$|E
