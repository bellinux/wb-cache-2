40|$|Today, the Late Glacial interstadials Bølling and Allerød, {{originally}} {{defined in}} northern Europe, are often applied as chronozones in different palaeoclimate contexts across the Northern Hemisphere. The scientific community in both palaeoclimate research and archaeology often disregards {{the fact that}} the Meiendorf interstadial has long been identified as preceding the Bølling-Allerød sequence, and that there are lots of difficulties with the synchronization of the Oldest Dryas-Bølling-Older Dryas-sequence. Synchronization of important Central European high-resolution pollen records with the Greenland GRIP ice core demonstrates a strong climatic gradient from the South to the North of Europe over the entire Late Glacial. Therefore, the northern European interstadials (Meiendorf, Bølling, Allerød) cannot serve universally as Late Glacial chronozones with reference to their characteristic pollen compositions, even though they are of greatest importance for the understanding of the regional vegetational history. The Greenland ice cores offer continous climate information over the entire Late Glacial and may serve as chronostratigraphical type sections. In the close future, detailed synchronization of terrestrial sequences with the Greenland ice core records will be achieved, using high-precision radiocarbon calibration based on Late Glacial <b>dendrochronologies...</b>|$|R
40|$|An {{on-going}} inter-comparison programme {{which is}} focused on assessing and establishing consensus protocols to be applied in the identification, selection and sub-sampling of materials for subsequent 14 C analysis is described. The outcome of the programme will provide a detailed quantification of the uncertainties associated with 14 C measurements including the issues of accuracy and precision. Such projects have become recognised as a fundamental aspect of continuing laboratory quality assurance schemes, providing a mechanism for the harmonisation of measurements and for demonstrating the traceability of results. The design of this study and its rationale are described. In summary, a suite of core samples has been defined which will {{be made available to}} both AMS and radiometric laboratories. These core materials are representative of routinely dated material and their ages span the full range of the applied 14 C time-scale. Two of the samples are of wood from the German and Irish <b>dendrochronologies,</b> thus providing a direct connection to the master dendrochronological calibration curve. Further samples link this new inter-comparison to past studies. Sample size and precision have been identified as being of paramount importance in defining dating confidence, and so several core samples have been identified for more in-depth study of these practical issues. In addition to the core samples, optional samples have been identified and prepared specifically for either AMS and/or radiometric laboratories. For AMS laboratories, these include bone, textile, leather and parchment samples. Participation in the study requires a commitment to a minimum of 10 core analyses, with results to be returned within a year. ...|$|R

40|$|This report {{addresses}} the following questions: a) is the diameter growth {{described by the}} standard ring width anomaly (SRWA) of Psudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco trees related to precipitation (P), pan evaporation (E), evapotranspiration (Et), runoff (Q), and soil moisture content (q) derived from a water balance model?; b) is the SRWA associated with synoptic climate events such as El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) ?, and c) are P, Et and q related to ENSO, PDO and AMO events? The SRWA for three <b>dendrochronologies</b> (Las Bayas and Banderas in Durango and El Gato in Zacatecas) from 1665 to 2001 addressed these questions. Instrumental measurements of P and E (1947 - 2007) and, using parameterized sub-models for the rainfall interception of Gash model (I) and Et, a mass balance approach evaluated Q and q for a forest site near El Salto, Durango, Mexico. SRWA oscillations of several timescales had spectral peaks every 2 - 3; 3 - 7; and 9 - 12 years. The ENSO indices explained most of the total SRWA variation for all three chronologies (1990 - 2001). For the short (1990 - 2001) and middle-term (1945 - 2001) seasonal data, the SRWA variability was only linked to q. The strength of the relationship weakened as {{the length of the}} time series increased, indicating that other variables control tree growth as well.

40|$|AbstractReconstructing {{regional}} to hemispheric-scale climate variability {{requires the}} application of spatially representative and climatically sensitive proxy archives. Large spatial networks of <b>dendrochronologies</b> have facilitated the reconstruction of atmospheric variability and inferred variability in the Atlantic Ocean system.

In this study we present the first analyses of a network of absolutely-dated annually-resolved growth increment width chronologies from the marine bivalves Glycymeris glycymeris and Arctica islandica. The network contains eight chronologies spanning > 500 km along the western British continental shelf from the southern Irish Sea to North West Scotland. Correlation analysis of the individual chronologies and a suite of climate indices, including the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), Central England surface air temperature (CET), northeast Atlantic sea surface temperatures (SST's) and the winter North Atlantic Oscillation (wNAO), demonstrates that, despite the large geographical distances been sites and the heterogeneous nature of the marine environment, the increment width variability in these series contains an element of coherence likely driven by a common response to changing environmental forcing. A nested Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to construct five composite series which explain between 31 % and 74 % of the variance across the individual chronologies. Linear regression analyses indicate that the composite series explain up to 41 % of the variance in Northeast Atlantic SSTs over the calibration period (1975 – 2000). Calibration verification (reduction of error [RE] and coefficient of efficiency [CE]) statistics indicate that the composite series contains significant skill at reconstructing multi-decadal northeast Atlantic SST variability over the past two centuries (1805 – 2010).

5|$|Two recent discoveries {{indicate}} probable {{very early}} settlements near the Thames in the London area. In 1999, {{the remains of}} a Bronze Age bridge were found on the foreshore north of Vauxhall Bridge. This bridge either crossed the Thames, or gave access to a now lost island in the river. <b>Dendrochronology</b> dated the timbers to ca. 1500 BC. In 2010 the foundations of a large timber structure, dated to ca. 4500 BC, were found on the Thames foreshore, south of Vauxhall Bridge. The function of the mesolithic structure is not known. Both structures are on the south bank, at a natural crossing point where the River Effra flows into the River Thames.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, <b>dendrochronology</b> of wood {{samples from}} Chetro Ketl {{provided}} information on species selected, season of cutting, wood modification and use, {{as well as}} an estimate of the number of trees required to build the great house. Trees were harvested for construction at Chetro Ketl annually, which contrasts with the sporadic patterns found at other sites in the canyon. Whereas a late summer and early fall harvesting time has been documented at other Chacoan sites, the tree felling for Chetro Ketl was undertaken primarily during the spring and early summer. This may indicate that enough in-house labor was available during the farming season, or that specialized groups of Chacoans were dedicated to tree felling irrespective of the agriculture cycle, when most others were busy with field preparation and planting. One particularly well sampled room suggests that wood was cut during the relatively short span of a couple of weeks per season.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} at least four {{successive}} mansion houses at Holnicote. Limited information is available about the early buildings. One is known to have been built between 1493 and 1521, based on <b>dendrochronology</b> from surviving timbers. The Grade II* listed gatehouse and attached cottage were built together with a new house in the early 17th century. Following the purchase of the estate by the Blackford family in 1705, a new mansion house was built {{on the site of the}} previous structure. Only the stable block from that building survives. The house was destroyed by fire in 1779. The Acland family re-built it as a thatched hunting lodge, which was also destroyed by fire in 1851, and replaced in 1861. A kitchen extension was added in 1874. The lodge was built in the 19th century. The estate includes several cottages including Rose Bower and the 17th-century Butlers Cottage. An 18th-century Flemish bond red brick granary also exists on the estate.|$|E
40|$|The first {{objective}} of this thesis was {{to predict the future}} success of selected tree species under low (B 1, 550 CO 2 ppm) and moderate (A 1 B, 720 CO 2 ppm) climate change scenarios as defined in the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES). This was accomplished through the creation of radial-growth forecasts for eastern hemlock (Tsuga Canadensis (L.) Carr.), sugar maple (Acer saccharum L.), white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench.) Voss), and white pine (Pinus strobus L.) in the Grand River Watershed of Ontario, Canada. The forecasts were founded on historic growth-climate relationships between standardized regional <b>dendrochronologies</b> for each species and past climate data from the Guelph OAC weather station. These species-specific growth-climate relationships were then extended to 2100 using modeled climate data from the Third Generation Coupled Global Climate Model (CGCM 3) to project radial-growth under both emissions scenarios. Results indicated that eastern hemlock radial-growth will remain stable throughout the 21 st-century, sugar maple and white spruce growth will start to decline, and white pine growth will increase. While the radial-growth forecasts were limited by the length of the past climate data, the accuracy of the modeled climate data, and the number and type of variables used in the forecast model, the results were statically significant and strongly supported in the literature. The second thesis objective was to assess the potential impact of the radial-growth forecasts on environmental planning policy and forest management strategy in the Grand River Watershed. Examples of how the forecasts could influence basic management strategies in the watershed were provided to display the conceptual linkages between the results and policy formulation. Next, the radial-growth forecasts were presented to four forest managers working in the watershed to gage the practical implications, perceptions and limitations of the radial-growth forecasting method. While the managers found the radial-growth forecasts interesting, they also noted that the results were of limited use since they could not account for other factors important to the future success of the study species, such as seedling dispersal and establishment rates, as well as the potential effects of pathogens, insects and invasive species. Therefore, it was recommended that future research should work to extrapolate the results of the radial-growth forecasts to other tree species and types in the region, as well as incorporate more variables into the models, so that more accurate and applicable growth projections could be constructed in the watershed...|$|R

25|$|Florence Hawley {{was born}} in Cananea Sonora, Mexico where her father was chief chemist for a copper mine. In 1913, after the {{outbreak}} of the Mexican Revolution, her family moved to Miami, Arizona. She was introduced to archaeology at a young age from her father during his excavating of ruins around their home in southern Arizona. In 1936 Florence married archaeologist Donovan Senter; together they had a daughter named Andrea. In 1950, after a divorce from Senter, she married Bruce Ellis who was a historian. Their marriage lasted until {{the time of his death}} in 1985. She began teaching at the University of Arizona in 1929, where she was introduced to <b>dendrochronology</b> in a class taught by A. E. Douglass. She began teaching at the University of New Mexico fall of 1934 until she retired in 1971. It is possible that more professional anthropologists in the United States were taught by Hawley than by any other member of the profession. Even after her retirement she remained active in field research up until her death in 1991. She continued to write and excavate. She was passionate about her work and even after a broken hip returned to the field during her recuperation to supervise. She broke new ground in her research by developing and applying innovative techniques of chemical analysis, <b>dendrochronology,</b> ethnohistory, and Ethnoarchaeology.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dendrochronology</b> (tree ring) studies {{conducted}} on the oldest bald cypress trees growing in Reelfoot Lake found evidence of the 1811–1812 series {{in the form of}} fractures followed by rapid growth after their inundation, whereas cores taken from old bald cypress trees in the St. Francis sunklands showed slowed growth in the half century that followed 1812. These were interpreted as clear signals of the 1811–1812 earthquake series in tree rings. Because the tree ring record in Reelfoot Lake and the St. Francis sunk lands extend back to AD 1682 and AD 1321, respectively, Van Arsdale et al. interpreted the lack of similar signals elsewhere in the chronology as evidence against large New Madrid earthquakes between those years and 1811.|$|E

Several monuments were removed by Rev. Granville Leveson-Gower in 1818 and some restoration occurred in 1884; it was re-seated and repaved in 1889.

25|$|Florence Hawley (September 17, 1906-1991) {{was one of}} {{the first}} anthropologists to work {{extensively}} on <b>dendrochronology,</b> or tree-ring dating. She conducted archaeological and ethnographic research in the Southwestern United States; and undertook some of the first dendrochronological research in eastern North America in the mid 20th century, examining samples from a number of archaeological sites. She was also highly regarded as a passionate teacher who pushed her students toward greatness by encouraging them to think for themselves and work hard for what they wanted to achieve.

25|$|Florence Hawley {{applied the}} {{training}} she received from A. E. Douglass’s <b>dendrochronology</b> class to {{tree ring analysis}} in the Chaco Canyon excavations where she worked with the University of New Mexico field program in the summers of 1929, 1930, and 1931. She conducted ceramic analyses with materials from Chetro Ketl and other sites in the area, and her ceramic chronologies were independently confirmed by tree ring dates. From the Late 1950s through the 1960s she directed a summer archaeological field schools through the University of New Mexico. One {{of the most prominent}} discoveries was that of San Gabriel de Yunge, the first Spanish Capital of New Mexico, which dated from 1600, found near San Juan Pueblo. Her work on <b>dendrochronology</b> helped provides a baseline for southwestern chronologies and her work constituted a technical expertise which is still largely in demand. Hawley also conducted dendrochronological research in eastern North America, conducting some of the first such work in the region. She began her tree-ring research in the Midwest around the 1933 - 1934 academic year. She collected tree - ring specimens or inspected samples of archaeological wood from the University of Chicago’s excavations in southern Illinois. In 1937, she continued her Midwestern dendrochronological fieldwork and collected 1000 living-tree specimens in eight different states in an effort to identify the climate signal recorded by trees across the Midwest. In 1941, Hawley published Tree-Ring Analysis and Dating in the Mississippi Drainage where she presented the major problems she and her team faced: they were working with new species, they were working across a huge area, there was a shortage in old growth timber because of the extensive tree cutting, and the wood was not preserved well because of the damp mound sediments.|$|E
25|$|The {{constancy}} of {{the decay}} rates of isotopes is well supported in science. Evidence for this constancy includes the correspondences of date estimates taken from different radioactive isotopes {{as well as}} correspondences with non-radiometric dating techniques such as <b>dendrochronology,</b> ice core dating, and historical records. Although scientists have noted slight increases in the decay rate for isotopes subject to extreme pressures, those differences were too small to significantly impact date estimates. The constancy of the decay rates is also governed by first principles in quantum mechanics, wherein any deviation in the rate would require {{a change in the}} fundamental constants. According to these principles, a change in the fundamental constants could not influence different elements uniformly, and a comparison between each of the elements' resulting unique chronological timescales would then give inconsistent time estimates.|$|E
