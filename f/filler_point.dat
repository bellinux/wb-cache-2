The D/F loop was moved aft to sit between frames three and four on the fuselage spine and a small circular plate above the footstep on the port side of the fuselage was deleted. The rudder was fitted as standard with a Flettner tab and two fixed tabs although some rare examples were not fitted with the fixed tabs. All K-4s were to be fitted with a long retractable tail wheel (...) with two small clamshell doors covering the recess when the tail-wheel was retracted.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel metadata extraction (MDE) system for automatically detecting edited words, <b>fillers,</b> and self-interruption <b>points</b> in conversational speech. Our edit word detection sub-system combines a Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG) noisy channel model, a statistical syntactic language model, and a MaxEnt reranker. Hand-built, deterministic rules {{are used to}} detect <b>fillers.</b> Self-interruption <b>points</b> are explicitly determined by detected fillers and edited words. We have evaluated our system for these three tasks on two types of input: manually annotated words and automatically recognized speech-to-text tokens. In all six cases, our system has improved the state-of-the-art, as measured in a recent blind evaluation. 1...|$|R
40|$|Polymer electrolytes, {{which are}} {{ubiquitous}} and indispensable in all electrochemical devices, {{have been investigated}} and a study to explore their performance characteristics on salt type and salt concentration and different binary solvents has been performed. LiBETI salt exhibits less variation with change in molar concentration {{and is expected to}} form less ion pair formation. It has been realized that though the addition of inert ceramic fillers, i. e. fumed silica, enhances the mechanical integrity but decreases conductivity marginally in the LiIm, LiBETI and LiBF 4 based salt. This decrease in conductivity is due to their more interaction with the PMMA as established by FTIR. Moreover these electrolytes were found to be exhibited high conductivity (>mS/cm) to warrant their practical applications. The glass transition temperature increases with the addition of <b>fillers</b> <b>pointing</b> towards the lower mobility of Li+ ions and these electrolytes also exhibit high-thermal stability...|$|R

So, exploiting the geometry of oblique images support by vanishing points, well be able to pass from 2 D to 3 D, obtaining camera self-calibration, as well as virtual 3 D models, which can be geo-referenced over a real environment generated automatically through Digital Elevation Models (DEM) with ortophoto. Finally, in order to complete the 3 D scene, sv 3 DVision allows adding independents geo-referenced elements as: simple geometries (urban furniture), backgrounds and different visual effects. Therefore, through sv 3 DVision and GeoVRML, well achieve object uniqueness exploiting representation and analysis capabilities, as well as the integration under the same environment of metric rigor and visual quality...|$|R
30|$|Smith ([1990]) defines {{attitude}} toward reading as “a state of mind, accompanied by feelings and emotions that make reading {{more or less}} probable” (p. 215). Fitzgibbons ([2004]), who anchors Alexander and <b>Filler’s</b> ([1976]) <b>points</b> of view on this matter, defines reading attitude as the feelings students have about reading. These feelings, he says, are {{important in terms of}} leading students to avoid or approach different reading situations. Thames and Reeves-Kazelskis ([1992]) point out that reading attitude {{is one of the major}} factors explaining the degree of student willingness to engage in reading activities. As such, it can be said that, for students, reading attitude is the willingness to take part in reading, with that willingness arising out of their feelings about this activity.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} system for {{modeling}} disfluency in conversational speech: repairs, <b>fillers,</b> and self-interruption <b>points</b> (IPs).

5000|$|The process {{differs from}} {{diffusion}} bonding in which diffusion {{occurs when a}} melting point repressant element from an interlayer moves into lattice and grain boundaries of the substrates at the bonding temperature. Solid state diffusional processes lead to a change of composition at the bond interface and the dissimilar interlayer melts at a lower temperature than the parent materials. Thus {{a thin layer of}} liquid spreads along the interface to form a joint at a lower temperature than the melting point of either of the parent materials. This method differs from brazing in that it is [...] "isothermally solidifying". While holding the temperature above the <b>filler</b> metal melting <b>point,</b> interdiffusion shifts the composition away from eutectic, so solidification occurs at the process temperature. If sufficient interdiffusion occurs, the joint will remain solid and strong well above the original melt process temperature. This is why it is termed [...] "transient liquid phase." [...] The liquid solidifies before cooling.|$|R

The choline chloride/glycerol was added with the different content of surfactant (hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide). The choline chloride/glycerol-hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide was introduced into high-density polyethylene/agar biocomposites through melt mixing. The mechanical testing {{results indicated that}} the impact strength and tensile extension of the biocomposites increased with the introduction of the choline chloride/glycerol-hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide. The scanning electron microscope, differential scanning calorimetry and thermal gravimetric analysis results exhibited that significant {{decrease in the number of}} agar <b>fillers</b> pull-out, melting <b>point</b> and thermal decomposition temperatures of the biocomposites are also due to the choline chloride/glycerol-hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide. The Fourier transform infrared spectra and X-ray diffractometer patterns of the biocomposites introduced with the choline chloride/glycerol-hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide demonstrate the presence of physical interactions, which contributes to the increase of compatibility between both high-density polyethylene and agar. In conclusion, high-density polyethylene/agar biocomposites could be compatibilized with eutectic-based ionic liquid containing surfactant, choline chloride/glycerol-hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide.

40|$|Extensive {{damage on}} the road E 4 along the {{northeast}} coast of Sweden {{in the winter of}} 2007 / 2008, probably caused by the mild climate with plenty of moisture and many freeze-thaw fluctuations, brought up the issue of the need for specific requirements for the filler used in asphalt production. Aggregate from this area is sometimes very mica-rich and/or contains other "sensitive" minerals. The project aims to examine the methods that are relevant for the filler according to product standard EN 13043 "Aggregates for bituminous mixtures and surface treatments for roads, airfields and other trafficked areas". Ten different filler materials have been included in this study. Nine of these were taken from quarries along the north coast of Sweden (in some cases from inland areas), while the tenth is a reference material from a quarry in the county Östergötland. All materials are tested for a number of different properties. The test methods used are primarily from the product standard EN 13 043, while {{the purpose of this study}} is to assess the quality of <b>filler</b> from the <b>point</b> of suitability for asphalt. The materials consist of sorting 0 / 2, 0 / 4 mm and/or filler (mostly < 0, 063 mm) and were sieved to test fractions in the laboratory, which in most cases was 0 - 0, 125 mm. Most results in this study fall into the lowest of the listed classes for each method in the product standard EN 13043. The reason is probably that the Swedish bedrock generally does not contain the kind of sensitive fine material, type swelling clay minerals, etc., which are common on the continent, and the standard is likely to be suited for...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{synchrotron}} radiation {{has become an}} essential tool to investigate the properties {{of a wide range}} of materials. The highly energetic X-ray beam delivers high flux, short acquisition times and high penetration into the material. The present work focuses on using synchrotron tomography and X-ray diffraction to study multi-metal matrix (3 MC) composites during in-situ loading. 3 MCs were produced via a process in which SiC fibres are coated with a primary matrix of Ti and then infiltrated with a low melting <b>point</b> <b>filler</b> material as secondary matrix. Two different filler materials Ag 28 Cu and Zr 26 Ti 25 Ni were used as secondary matrix. During the consolidation process, intermetallic phases form in the matrix. These intermetallic phases and their stress state are expected to critically influence the mechanical properties of 3 MCs. Beamline I 12 at the Diamond Light Source (UK) provides the capability to conduct high resolution tomography (CT) and X-ray diffraction during in-situ loading. CT was used to investigate the microstructure, to locate the origin of appearing cracks and to follow their dissemination during loading. The CT measurements reveal that cracks occur in the brittle zones of the matrix far below the ultimate tensile strength of the composite material. In the case of Ag 28 Cu, cracks appear in the brittle intermetallic transition zone between primary matrix and AgCu secondary matrix. In the case of Zr 26 Ti 25 Ni, cracks are located mainly in the secondary matrix. The aim of the XRD measurements was to determine the internal stresses in the different constituents of the 3 MC. Strains in the α-Ti phase follow the expected linear dependency when applying a tensile load. In contrast, the strain in other phases remains unchanged indicating that no load is transferred to these phases. ...|$|R
40|$|This CD/digital {{album is}} the {{culmination}} of practice-led research, released internationally on Scottish independent label Armellodie Records on the 6 th May 2013. The research explicitly addresses potential defining characteristics and the status of contemporary alt-folksong and its roles in the articulation of place through a collection of twelve original songs. The work approaches the term ‘place’ from the direction of subjectivity and the performance of identity as they relate to geographic experience. The album takes the perspective of a re-/dis-located, subject. Subsequently, a diasporic neurosis concerning home and authenticity leads to a focus on aspects of place related to past (Shetland), heritage (Ireland), present (Cornwall), and ‘in between’. Songs have been composed iteratively alongside written/read/listened research, and through field trips and recordings, carried out over roughly 50 locations. The album draws on theories of Popular Music and Postmodernism, but also looks to ethnomusicology of Folksong, and interviews with practitioners, characterising the relationship between traditional music and contemporary alt-folk. There is particular focus here on the use of autobiography, assessing the value of such a songwriting method, and aspects of musical ‘meaning’. Furthermore the album investigates, aesthetically and ideologically, the use of production/recording technologies as themselves significant sources of meaning. As such, different formats and fidelities are used throughout. The Album has been widely (and universally positively) reviewed, and was described by the Scottish Herald as ‘rewriting the rules of the genre and making beautifully melancholic music’. It also received four star reviews in the Irish Times and The Skinny, nine out of ten from Neon <b>Filler,</b> and eight <b>point</b> five from With Guitars. This album contributes to the growing body of popular music research and practice and usefully situates itself culturally in the interesting ground between contemporary song and the chronology of traditional music...|$|R
