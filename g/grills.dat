5|$|The true {{number of}} cases of carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning is unknown, since many non-lethal exposures go undetected.

This is due to increased domestic use of gas furnaces, gas or kerosene space heaters, and kitchen stoves during the winter months, which if faulty and/or used without adequate ventilation, may produce excessive carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide detection and poisoning also increases during power outages, when electric heating and cooking appliances become inoperative and residents may temporarily resort to fuel-burning space heaters, stoves, and <b>grills</b> (some of which are safe only for outdoor use but nonetheless are errantly burned indoors).|$|E
