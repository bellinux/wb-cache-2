5|$|Approaches to {{the design}} of {{genome-wide}} RNAi libraries can require more sophistication than the design of a single siRNA for a defined set of experimental conditions. Artificial neural networks are frequently used to design siRNA libraries and to predict their likely efficiency at gene knockdown. Mass genomic screening is widely seen as a promising method for <b>genome</b> <b>annotation</b> and has triggered the development of high-throughput screening methods based on microarrays. However, the utility of these screens and the ability of techniques developed on model organisms to generalize to even closely related species has been questioned, for example from C. elegans to related parasitic nematodes.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} {{are some of the}} gene count estimates of human X chromosome. Because researchers use different approaches to <b>genome</b> <b>annotation</b> their predictions of the number of genes on each chromosome varies (for technical details, see gene prediction). Among various projects, the collaborative consensus coding sequence project (CCDS) takes an extremely conservative strategy. So CCDS's gene number prediction represents a lower bound on the total number of human protein-coding genes.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, {{the basic}} level of {{annotation}} is using BLAST for finding similarities, and then annotating genomes based on homologues. More recently, additional information {{is added to}} the annotation platform. The additional information allows manual annotators to deconvolute discrepancies between genes that are given the same annotation. Some databases use genome context information, similarity scores, experimental data, and integrations of other resources to provide genome annotations through their Subsystems approach. Other databases (e.g. Ensembl) rely on both curated data sources as well as a range of software tools in their automated <b>genome</b> <b>annotation</b> pipeline. Structural annotation consists of the identification of genomic elements, primarily ORFs and their localisation, or gene structure. Functional annotation consists of attaching biological information to genomic elements.|$|E
40|$|Background Complete and {{accurate}} <b>annotation</b> of sequenced <b>genomes</b> is {{of paramount importance}} to their utility and analysis. Differences in gene prediction pipelines mean that <b>genome</b> <b>annotations</b> for a species can differ considerably in {{the quality and quantity of}} their predicted genes. Furthermore, genes that are present in genome sequences sometimes fail to be detected by computational gene prediction methods. Erroneously unannotated genes can lead to oversights and inaccurate assertions in biological investigations, especially for smaller-scale genome projects, which rely heavily on computational prediction. Results Here we present OrthoFiller, a tool designed to address the problem of finding and adding such missing genes to <b>genome</b> <b>annotations.</b> OrthoFiller leverages information from multiple related species to identify those genes whose existence can be verified through comparison with known gene families, but which have not been predicted. By simulating missing gene annotations in real sequence datasets from both plants and fungi we demonstrate the accuracy and utility of OrthoFiller for finding missing genes and improving <b>genome</b> <b>annotations.</b> Furthermore, we show that applying OrthoFiller to existing “complete” <b>genome</b> <b>annotations</b> can identify and correct substantial numbers of erroneously missing genes in these two sets of species. Conclusions We show that significant improvements in the completeness of <b>genome</b> <b>annotations</b> can be made by leveraging information from multiple species...|$|R

25|$|Chromosomes {{in humans}} {{can be divided}} into two types: autosomes (body chromosome(s)) and {{allosome}} (sex chromosome(s)). Certain genetic traits are linked to a person's sex and are passed on through the sex chromosomes. The autosomes contain the rest of the genetic hereditary information. All act in the same way during cell division. Human cells have 23 pairs of chromosomes (22 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes), giving a total of 46 per cell. In addition to these, human cells have many hundreds of copies of the mitochondrial genome. Sequencing of the human genome has provided {{a great deal of information}} about each of the chromosomes. Below is a table compiling statistics for the chromosomes, based on the Sanger Institute's human genome information in the Vertebrate <b>Genome</b> <b>Annotation</b> (VEGA) database. Number of genes is an estimate, as it is in part based on gene predictions. Total chromosome length is an estimate as well, based on the estimated size of unsequenced heterochromatin regions.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} {{identifying}} {{the boundaries between}} genes and other features in a raw DNA sequence is called <b>genome</b> <b>annotation</b> {{and is in the}} domain of bioinformatics. While expert biologists make the best annotators, their work proceeds slowly, and computer programs are increasingly used to meet the high-throughput demands of genome sequencing projects. Beginning in 2008, a new technology known as RNA-seq was introduced that allowed scientists to directly sequence the messenger RNA in cells. This replaced previous methods of annotation, which relied on inherent properties of the DNA sequence, with direct measurement, which was much more accurate. Today, annotation of the human genome and other genomes relies primarily on deep sequencing of the transcripts in every human tissue using RNA-seq. These experiments have revealed that over 90% of genes contain at least one and usually several alternative splice variants, in which the exons are combined in different ways to produce 2 or more gene products from the same locus.|$|E

40|$|Motivation: High-throughput {{nucleotide}} sequencing technologies provide {{large amounts of}} quantitative genomic data at nucleotide resolution, which are important for {{the present and future}} biomedical researches; for example differential analysis of base-level RNA expression data will improve our understanding of transcriptome, including both coding and non-coding genes.
