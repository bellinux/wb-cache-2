Most of these studies have used indirect measures of exposure and generally dealt inadequately with confounding.

40|$|With {{the continual}} {{improvement}} in our quality of life, <b>indoor</b> <b>air</b> quality {{has become an}} important area of concern in the 21 st century. <b>Indoor</b> <b>air</b> quality is affected by many factors including the type and running conditions of indoor pollution sources, ventilation conditions, as well as indoor activities.

25|$|<b>Indoor</b> <b>air</b> <b>{{pollution}}</b> {{and poor}} urban air quality {{are listed as}} two of the world's worst toxic pollution problems in the 2008 Blacksmith Institute World's Worst Polluted Places report. According to the 2014 World Health Organization report, air pollution in 2012 caused the deaths of around 7 million people worldwide, an estimate roughly echoed by one from the International Energy Agency.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, {{the poorest}} fifth receive 0.1% of the world's {{lighting}} but pay {{a fifth of}} total spending on light, accounting for 25 to 30 percent of their income. <b>Indoor</b> <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> from burning fuels kills 2 million, with almost half the deaths from pneumonia in children under 5. Fuel from Bamboo burns more cleanly and also matures much faster than wood, thus also reducing deforestation. Additionally, using solar panels is promoted as being cheaper over the products' lifetime even if upfront costs are higher. Thus, payment schemes such as lend-to-own programs are promoted and up to 14% of Kenyan households use solar as their primary energy source.|$|E
25|$|Women’s {{health is}} also put {{at a higher}} level of risk as a result of being {{confined}} to certain traditional responsibilities, such as cooking and water collection. Being confined to unpaid domestic labor not only reduces women's opportunities to education and formal job employment (both of which can indirectly contribute to better health in the long run), but also potentially expose women to higher risk of health issues. For instance, in developing regions where solid fuels are used for cooking, women are exposed to a higher level of <b>indoor</b> <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> due to extended periods of cooking and preparing meals for the family. Breathing air tainted by the burning of solid fuels is estimated to be responsible for 641,000 of the 1.3 million deaths of women worldwide each year due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD).|$|E

25|$|Houseplants {{together}} with the medium {{in which they are}} grown can reduce components of <b>indoor</b> <b>air</b> <b>pollution,</b> particularly volatile organic compounds (VOC) such as benzene, toluene, and xylene. Plants remove CO2 and release oxygen and water, although the quantitative impact for house plants is small. Most of the effect is attributed to the growing medium alone, but even this effect has finite limits associated with the type and quantity of medium and the flow of air through the medium. The effect of house plants on VOC concentrations was investigated in one study, done in a static chamber, by NASA for possible use in space colonies. The results showed that the removal of the challenge chemicals was roughly equivalent to that provided by the ventilation that occurred in a very energy efficient dwelling with a very low ventilation rate, an air exchange rate of about 1/10 per hour. Therefore, air leakage in most homes, and in non-residential buildings too, will generally remove the chemicals faster than the researchers reported for the plants tested by NASA. The most effective household plants reportedly included aloe vera, English ivy, and Boston fern for removing chemicals and biological compounds.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{facilitate}} rational development on the efficient new ventilation system with new detectors against the health problems caused by VOC in residential buildings, authors studied to clarify the actual IAQ conditions around occupied area.

In this paper, investigated results for indoor thermal environment, ventilation and indoor chemical pollutants are described. In this study, an interesting decreased trend of average concentration of formaldehyde was found.

40|$|The {{interior}} decoration {{materials and the}} new furniture using formaldehyde, ammonia, and other poisonous substances are known as the main sources of <b>indoor</b> <b>air</b> <b>pollutions.</b> However, {{it is still a}} big challenge to estimate accurately the overall air quality by using the current measuring tools. Accordingly, the region-dot fusion (RDF) algorithm is proposed to evaluate the air quality in this paper. For the conversion from a region to a dot, the region-dot function is firstly defined as the summation of the belief function and the weighted width of the belief interval. In the RDF algorithm, the belief intervals of the two sensors with the basic probability functions are calculated based on the measurements of formaldehyde sensor and ammonia sensor. Then, the belief intervals are converted to the specific values. After the computation of collision degree and combination, the pollution level represented by a belief interval with the maximum probability is selected as the outcome of fusion decision. Compared with the weighted fusion algorithm and D-S evidence reasoning method, it is experimentally proved that the RDF algorithm can improve the separability of the belief intervals of the belief functions. Also, the evidence collision degree is decreased dramatically...|$|R
