5|$|Section 1254(1) {{represents}} {{the far more}} common route: certiorari, the source of nearly all the Supreme Court's current docket. Section 1254(2) represents a less common route: certification. Pursuant to § 1254(2), the Supreme Court heard 72 certified question cases between 1927 and 1936; 20 between 1937 and 1946; and only four between 1947 and 2010. In modern jurisprudence, § 1254(2) certification <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>very</b> rare. For example, when the en banc Fifth Circuit attempted to certify a question in 2009 (also a rare occurrence), the Supreme Court summarily declined to consider the case. Certified questions are also governed by Supreme Court Rule 19.|$|E

5|$|She uses unnamed famous scientists, Aleister Crowley and Yūsuke Santamaria {{as models}} for several of her characters. Characters are also based on her editor and the Tim Campi Design silver {{accessory}} brand. Hoshino collaborated with Kata Kizaki, {{the author of the}} novel adaptations, to create the character Bak Chan. The role of Miranda Lotto changed, and was ultimately lengthened, after Hoshino realized the similarities the two shared. Hoshino comically comments that Allen's hair <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>very</b> similar to the Super Saiyan, a transformation from Dragon Ball, in which the character's hair becomes spiky. Towards the beginning of D.Gray-mans publication, Hoshino stated that Allen, Kanda, and Cross Marian are the hardest characters to draw while the Millennium Earl and Hevlaska are the easiest.|$|E
5|$|A few villagers from Munneswaram village filed {{a case in}} the Chilaw {{district}} {{courts to}} prevent the land grab of temple properties by outsiders. The case resulted in the British colonial government accepting temple properties as belonging to a newly created temple trust. The trust came {{under the control of}} one Cumaraswamy Kurukal from Colombo. His family maintains the hereditary priestly position of the Siva temple, and controls all temple properties. A Tamil family from Munneswaram village controls the priestly position of the Kali temple. The Siva temple was renovated in 1875 by the personal efforts of Cumaraswamy Kurukal. Improvements were effected again in 1919 and 1963 through public support from Tamil Hindus from Colombo and Jaffna. The temple <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>very</b> popular amongst the Sinhalese and they make up over 78% of the pilgrims to both the Siva and Kali temples.|$|E
5|$|Since it {{is easier}} for a snake's tongue to fulfill its {{olfactory}} function under water, its action is short compared to that of terrestrial snake species. Only the forked tips protrude from the mouth through a divided notch {{in the middle of the}} rostral scale. The nostrils have valves consisting of a specialized spongy tissue to exclude water, and the windpipe can be drawn up to where the short nasal passage opens into the roof of the mouth. This is an important adaptation for an animal that must surface to breathe, but may have its head partially submerged when doing so. The lung <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>very</b> large and extends almost the entire length of the body, although the rear portion is thought to have developed to aid buoyancy rather than to exchange gases. The extended lung possibly also serves to store air for dives.|$|E

25|$|Dhammakaya {{meditation}} is {{an approach}} to Buddhist meditation developed and taught by the Thai meditation teacher Luang Pu Sodh Candasaro {{in the early twentieth}} century.

It also links to the Punjab region, where the Anarkali suit is similar to the anga and the Peshwaz worn in Jammu.|$|E
25|$|The American manual {{approach}} to docking allows greater initial flexibility and less complexity. The downside to {{this mode of}} operation is that each mission becomes unique and requires specialised training and planning, making the process more labour-intensive and expensive. The Russians pursued an automated methodology that used the crew in override or monitoring roles. Although the initial development costs were high, the system <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>very</b> reliable with standardisations that provide significant cost benefits in repetitive routine operations. An automated approach could allow assembly of modules orbiting other worlds prior to crew arrival.|$|E
