5|$|In the novel, the Afro-Caribbean slave {{population}} violently {{react to}} the oppressive regime imposed on them by the <b>French</b> <b>colonials.</b> The end result of this armed reaction {{is the emergence of}} a brutal regime in which the oppressed become the oppressors.

Carpentier's perspective on the Haitian revolution is revealed in the way that he portrays the cyclical nature of reactionary violence.|$|R
