The King's behaviour and his relationship with Wallis made him unpopular with the Conservative-led British government, as well as distressing <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> brother, the Duke of York. The British media remained deferential to the monarchy, and no stories of the affair were reported in the domestic press, but foreign media widely reported their relationship.|$|E

5|$|Adud al-Dawla, {{in order}} to {{maintain}} peace, established marriage ties with several rulers; his daughter was married to the Abbasid caliph at-Ta'i, while another was married to the Samanids and the Ziyarid ruler Bisutun. Adud al-Dawla himself had several wives, which included; the daughter of Bisutun; the daughter of Manadhar, an Justanid king; and the daughter of Siyahgil, an Giilite king. From these wives, Adud al-Dawla had several sons; Abu'l-Husain Ahmad and Abu Tahir Firuzshah, from the daughter of Manadhar; Abu Kalijar Marzuban, from the daughter of Siyahgil; and Shirdil Abu'l-Fawaris, from a Turkic concubine. Adud al-Dawla also had a younger son named Baha' al-Dawla. Abu'l-Husain Ahmad was supported by <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> uncle Fuladh ibn Manadhar as the heir of the Buyid Empire.

5|$|In 1934, Abbe {{moved to}} Kyoto with <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> sister Toyoka {{so that he}} could attend Busen, {{training}} in both the judo and kendo programmes. Abbe learned kendo under the direction of Busen's head sword instructor, Kinnosuke Ogawa, a master who held the rank of 10th dan. He recalled that his instructor, at the age of 75 years, was so skilled that he could not be touched by any of the students or younger instructors. Every Saturday afternoon at Busen, following tradition, judo tournaments were held. Abbe fought five opponents in succession with each contest lasting five minutes, and he won all or almost all of these matches. In his first year at Busen, he was promoted to 4th dan in judo. In the autumn of his second year there, he was promoted to 5th dan, by which time he was reported to have been fighting 20 opponents in succession.|$|E
5|$|Some recent historians paint a more {{favourable}} {{picture of}} the emperor's rule. For example, Martijn Icks, in Images of Elagabalus (2008; republished as The Crimes of Elagabalus in 2012), doubts {{the reliability of the}} ancient sources and argues that it was the emperor's unorthodox religious policies that alienated the power elite of Rome, to the point that his grandmother saw fit to eliminate him and replace him with his cousin. Leonardo de Arrizabalaga y Prado, in The Emperor Elagabalus: Fact or Fiction? (2008), is also critical of the ancient historians and speculates that neither religion nor sexuality {{played a role in the}} fall of the young emperor. He was simply the loser in a power struggle within the imperial family; the loyalty of the Praetorian Guards was up for sale, and Julia Maesa had the resources to outmaneuver and outbribe her grandson. In this version of events, once Elagabalus, <b>his</b> <b>mother,</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> immediate circle had been murdered, a campaign of character assassination began, resulting in a grotesque caricature that has persisted to the present day. Historians have not only kept the tradition alive, but often embellished it, reflecting their own bias against effeminacy, religious zealotry and other traits with which Elagabalus is commonly identified.|$|E
5|$|William McEwan {{opened the}} Fountain Brewery in Fountainbridge, then a suburb on the {{outskirts}} of Edinburgh, in 1856, using £2,000 loaned by <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> uncle. The area and the brewery are named after the spring waters from the vicinity, which, in addition to its proximity to the Caledonian railway line and the Union Canal, determined the location of the brewery. McEwan had employed geologists to identify the prime location for a supply of well water. Beforehand, McEwan had engaged in industrial espionage at Bass and Allsopp's breweries in order to learn techniques and assay costs. After establishing a market share in the industrial regions of the Scottish lowlands, from the early 1860s McEwan built up a successful colonial export trade by exploiting his family's shipowning connections. It was during this time that McEwan's India Pale Ale, the beer that was the foundation for much of the company's reputation, was first labelled Export.|$|E
