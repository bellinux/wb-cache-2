5|$|Babe {{is invited}} {{to return to work}} by Linda and is pleased when Abi is sacked after making an error. Babe visits Sylvie, who now lives with Tina, and belittles her. Later in the evening, Babe is locked in the Vic's kitchen freezer by an unknown assailant, {{although}} Linda and Whitney discover Babe and she makes a quick recovery. Linda accuses Claudette of being the culprit so Claudette exposes Babe's blackmailer secret to her. Mick and Linda are mortified, but forgive Babe. She later informs her family that Sylvie locked her in the freezer, but it transpires that Abi is the culprit and Babe realises this, but wants to readmit Sylvie into a care home. Linda later demands Babe return the money to the Cokers to avoid police interference, but Babe neglects the task so Mick warns her. She tries to earn the money by gambling and blackmailing Abi, but she mocks Babe's desperation. Linda issues Babe with a final warning so Babe decides to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank,</b> however she is delayed by Lee. Linda grows tired and evicts Babe, despite her returning all of the money. They later have a heart-to-heart where Babe explains that the money was placed into a bank account for Linda's infant son, Ollie Carter (Charlie) and says how she is cruel because it makes her feel better. Linda subsequently allows Babe to move back into the Vic.|$|E
25|$|On 1 August 2007, Frank E. Peters {{was convicted}} after {{a jury trial}} of six charges in Buffalo, New York in the United States. The charges {{included}} conspiracy, fraudulently inflating the value of security to a bank, bank fraud, mail fraud and wire fraud. Peters was the President of World Auto Parts, a company located in Buffalo in the late 1990s and in 2000. The company had a $10,500,000 revolving line of credit with the Chase Manhattan Bank, which was secured against {{the assets of the}} company. Peters was convicted of conspiring and causing false reports to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> about the value of the security and hiding from the bank the true (and dire) state of financial affairs of the company. Peters was also convicted by the jury for his role in a scheme to divert valuable assets from the bank, which involved returning cheques payable to World Auto Parts to customers, asking that these cheques be redrafted to ITEC, a company that Peters had formed without the Chase Manhattan Bank's knowledge.|$|E
25|$|Continuing with relationships, Ivy {{is still}} with Dixon but returns from Australia with her old {{childhood}} friend, Oscar, who seems to make Dixon uncomfortable. Oscar has hidden motives for revenge on Laurel, Ivy's mother, who he believes is responsible for his mother's suicide. He and Laurel have been sleeping together secretly throughout the summer, and the next step of his plan is to sleep with Ivy as well. When he succeeds, taking her virginity, both of them find out, leaving Ivy upset with her mother. Dixon breaks up with Ivy out of fear after finding out from his ex-girlfriend Sasha {{that he may be}} HIV positive, though he later tests negative (Oscar had bribed Sasha to tell Dixon this in order to make him leave Ivy so that he could make a move). Dixon and Ivy get back together, but Dixon then finds out that Oscar took Ivy's virginity on the night she and Dixon had argued and the two break up again. Naomi starts to fall for Oscar, even though Ivy has warned her of his actions. When he offers to be her boyfriend, she declines. However, unluckily for Naomi, Mr. Cannon is waiting for her in her hotel room when she returns from Adrianna's Christmas party. Mr. Cannon holds Naomi hostage and invites Silver to come over. Once she arrives, Mr. Cannon ties her up as well and tells the girls of his plan to prove his innocence and <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> to drain Naomi's trust fund. Silver and Naomi gang up and attack Mr. Cannon. Naomi wants to slit his throat but Silver talks her out of it and calls the police.|$|E

500|$|On April 2, 1987, {{a meeting}} with Gray was held in DeConcini's Capitol office, with Senators Cranston, Glenn, and McCain also in attendance. The {{senators}} requested that no staff be present. DeConcini started the meeting with a mention of [...] "our friend at Lincoln". Gray told the assembled senators {{that he did not}} know the particular details of the status of Lincoln Savings and Loan, and that the senators would have to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> regulators in San Francisco that had oversight jurisdiction for the bank. Gray did offer to set up a meeting between those regulators and the senators.|$|E
500|$|Mulder then wakes, unharmed, to {{find that}} his {{waterbed}} has sprung a leak, his alarm clock is broken, {{and he needs to}} pay his landlord for water damage. To do so, he is forced to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank,</b> instead of going to the meeting with his partner Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) and various other FBI officials. When he arrives, the same gunman, named Bernard, arrives and nervously attempts to rob the bank, shooting Mulder in the process. [...] The teller sets off the bank's silent alarm and police cars come rushing to the scene. Scully arrives and once again attempts to help her partner as he lies dying, but events go the same way - the police rush the building, Bernard detonates the bomb, and everybody dies.|$|E
500|$|Laich {{played in}} all 82 {{games for the}} Capitals during the 2007â€“08 season, and set career highs in goals, assists and points. His 21 goals ranked third overall on the team. He led the Capitals with two short handed goals, and played in his 200th career regular season game. After a two-goal game against the Atlanta Thrashers, Laich summed up his {{philosophy}} towards scoring: [...] "If you want money, <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank.</b> If you want bread, go to the bakery. If you want goals, go to the net." [...] During the playoffs, Laich had a five-game point streak in the Eastern Conference quarter-finals against the Philadelphia Flyers. This tied him for the longest point streak during {{the first round of}} the playoffs. As a restricted free agent after the season, Laich signed a three-year deal with the team on July 9, 2008.|$|E

40|$|Consider the {{following}} two {{ways of thinking about}} ambiguity. According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> first way, let's call it the orthodox view, the ambiguity of a sentence is a function of there being more than one possible representation of the form of that sentence. So, on the orthodox view, an utterance of Every man loves some woman admits two distinct logical forms. For example, these: (1) [Every x: man(x) ][Some y: woman(y) ][x loves y] (2) [Some y: woman(y) ][Every x: man(x) ][x loves y] Similarly, according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> orthodox view, the ambiguity of John <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> is due <b>to</b> there being two distinct lexical items for bank, and therefore to there being two different forms possible for <b>the</b> sentence John <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank,</b> depending on which lexical entry for bank is inserted. On the alternative way of thinking about ambiguity, let's call it the heretical view, matters are handled differently. Ambiguities may not depend on there being a plurality of possible forms so much as on the underspecification of form. If I say John <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank,</b> I do not have two distinct lexical entries for <b>the</b> noun <b>bank,</b> but a singl...|$|R
