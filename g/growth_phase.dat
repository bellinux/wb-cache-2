5|$|Paleontologist Gregory Erickson {{and colleagues}} {{have studied the}} growth and life history of tyrannosaurids. Analysis of bone {{histology}} can determine the age of a specimen when it died. Growth rates can be examined when the age of various individuals are plotted against their size on a graph. Erickson has shown that after a long time as juveniles, tyrannosaurs underwent tremendous growth spurts for about four years midway through their lives. After the rapid <b>growth</b> <b>phase</b> ended with sexual maturity, growth slowed down considerably in adult animals. A tyrannosaurid growth curve is S-shaped, with the maximum growth rate of individuals around 14 years of age.|$|E
5|$|The Dry Island bonebed {{discovered}} by Barnum Brown {{and his crew}} contains the remains of 26 Albertosaurus, the most individuals found in one locality of any large Cretaceous theropod, and the second-most of any large theropod dinosaur behind the Allosaurus assemblage at the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry in Utah. The group seems to be composed of one very old adult; eight adults between 17 and 23 years old; seven sub-adults undergoing their rapid growth phases at between 12 and 16 years old; and six juveniles {{between the ages of}} 2 and 11 years, who had not yet reached the <b>growth</b> <b>phase.</b>|$|E
5|$|The end of {{the rapid}} <b>growth</b> <b>phase</b> {{suggests}} the onset of sexual maturity in Albertosaurus, although growth continued at a slower rate throughout the animals' lives. Sexual maturation while still actively growing {{appears to be a}} shared trait among small and large dinosaurs as well as in large mammals, such as humans and elephants. This pattern of relatively early sexual maturation differs strikingly from the pattern in birds, which delay their sexual maturity until after they have finished growing.|$|E
30|$|Results A {{total of}} 641 {{proteins}} were detected, and among these, 483 were in both exponential and stationary <b>growth</b> <b>phases,</b> whereas 506 and 618 proteins were detected {{only during the}} exponential and stationary <b>growth</b> <b>phases,</b> respectively. Proteins were manually grouped into 25 metabolic pathway categories. Among the 641 identified proteins, 117 had a significant effect, and among these, 11 were in both exponential and stationary <b>growth</b> <b>phases,</b> whereas 68 and 60 proteins were detected only during the exponential and stationary <b>growth</b> <b>phases,</b> respectively. Considerable differences were also observed in protein abundances between the untreated and treated cells.

40|$|It {{has long}} been noted that batch {{cultures}} inoculated with resting bacteria exhibit a progression of <b>growth</b> <b>phases</b> traditionally labeled lag, exponential, pre-stationary and stationary. However, a detailed molecular description of the mechanisms controlling the transitions between these phases is lacking. A core circuit, formed by a subset of regulatory interactions involving five global transcription factors (FIS, HNS, IHF, RpoS and GadX), has been identified by correlating information from the well- established transcriptional regulatory network of Escherichia coli and genome-wide expression data from cultures in these different <b>growth</b> <b>phases.</b> We propose a functional role for this circuit in controlling progression through these phases. Two alternative hypotheses for controlling the transition between the <b>growth</b> <b>phases</b> are first, a continuous graded adjustment to changing environmental conditions, and second, a discontinuous hysteretic switch at critical thresholds between <b>growth</b> <b>phases.</b> We formulate a simple mathematical model of the core circuit, consisting of differential equations based on the power-law formalism, and show by mathematical and computer-assisted analysis that there are critical conditions among {{the parameters of the}} model that can lead to hysteretic switch behavior, which – if validated experimentally – would suggest that the transitions between different <b>growth</b> <b>phases</b> might be analogous to cellular differentiation.

5|$|The {{incubation}} period between contraction {{and the first}} obvious symptoms of the disease is around 12 days. Once inhaled, variola major virus invades the oropharyngeal (mouth and throat) or the respiratory mucosa, migrates to regional lymph nodes, and begins to multiply. In the initial <b>growth</b> <b>phase</b> the virus seems to move from cell to cell, but around the 12th day, lysis of many infected cells occurs and the virus {{is found in the}} bloodstream in large numbers (this is called viremia), and a second wave of multiplication occurs in the spleen, bone marrow, and lymph nodes.|$|E
5|$|The {{nucleotide}} sequence of chromosomes of Azotobacter vinelandii, strain AvOP, is partially determined. This chromosome is a circular DNA molecule which contains 5,342,073 nucleotide pairs and 5,043 genes, of which 4,988 encode proteins. The fraction of guanine + cytosine pairs is 65 mole percent. The number of chromosomes in the cells and the DNA content increases upon aging, {{and in the}} stationary <b>growth</b> <b>phase,</b> cultures may contain more than 100 copies of a chromosome per cell. The original DNA content (one copy) is restored when replanting the culture into a fresh medium. In addition to chromosomal DNA, Azotobacter can contain plasmids.|$|E
5|$|By tabulating {{the number}} of {{specimens}} of each age group, Erickson and his colleagues were able to draw conclusions about life history in a population of Albertosaurus. Their analysis showed that while juveniles were rare in the fossil record, subadults in the rapid <b>growth</b> <b>phase</b> and adults were far more common. While this {{could be due to}} preservation or collection biases, Erickson hypothesized that the difference was due to low mortality among juveniles over a certain size, which is also seen in some modern large mammals like elephants. This low mortality may have resulted from a lack of predation, since tyrannosaurs surpassed all contemporaneous predators in size by the age of two. Paleontologists have not found enough Daspletosaurus remains for a similar analysis, but Erickson notes that the same general trend seems to apply.|$|E
30|$|In general, enzymes {{involved}} in butyrate synthesis were detected in higher amounts for both <b>growth</b> <b>phases</b> in high glycerol cultures, except for acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (CBY_ 3258), which showed lower expression levels in both exponential and stationary <b>growth</b> <b>phases</b> in high initial glycerol concentration cultures.

5000|$|Diauxie is a Greek word {{coined by}} Jacques Monod to mean two <b>growth</b> <b>phases.</b> The word {{is used in}} English in cell biology to {{describe}} the <b>growth</b> <b>phases</b> of a microorganism in batch culture as it metabolizes a mixture of two sugars. Rather than metabolizing the two available sugars simultaneously, microbial cells commonly consume them in a sequential pattern, resulting in two separate <b>growth</b> <b>phases.</b> [...] During the first phase, cells preferentially metabolize the sugar on which it can grow faster (often glucose but not always). Only after the first sugar has been exhausted do the cells switch to the second.

Erickson only examined Daspletosaurus from the Dinosaur Park Formation, but these specimens show the same pattern. Compared to albertosaurines, Daspletosaurus showed a faster growth rate during the rapid growth period due to its higher adult weight. The maximum growth rate in Daspletosaurus was 180kilograms (400lb) per year, based on a mass estimate of 1800kilograms (2tons) in adults. Other authors have suggested higher adult weights for Daspletosaurus; this would change {{the magnitude of the}} growth rate but not the overall pattern.|$|E
5|$|Stems mainly {{provide support}} to the leaves and {{reproductive}} structures, but can store water in succulent plants such as cacti, food as in potato tubers, or reproduce vegetatively as in the stolons of strawberry plants or {{in the process of}} layering. Leaves gather sunlight and carry out photosynthesis. Large, flat, flexible, green leaves are called foliage leaves. Gymnosperms, such as conifers, cycads, Ginkgo, and gnetophytes are seed-producing plants with open seeds. Angiosperms are seed-producing plants that produce flowers and have enclosed seeds. Woody plants, such as azaleas and oaks, undergo a secondary <b>growth</b> <b>phase</b> resulting in two additional types of tissues: wood (secondary xylem) and bark (secondary phloem and cork). All gymnosperms and many angiosperms are woody plants. Some plants reproduce sexually, some asexually, and some via both means.|$|E
5|$|By tabulating {{the number}} of {{specimens}} of each age group, Erickson and his colleagues were able to draw conclusions about life history in tyranosauridae populations. Their analysis showed that while juveniles were rare in the fossil record, subadults in the rapid <b>growth</b> <b>phase</b> and adults were far more common. Over half of the known T. rex specimens appear to have died within six years of reaching sexual maturity, a pattern that is also seen in other tyrannosaurs and in some large, long-lived birds and mammals today. These species are characterized by high infant mortality rates, followed by relatively low mortality among juveniles. Mortality increases again following sexual maturity, {{partly due to the}} stresses of reproduction. While this could be due to preservation or collection biases, Erickson hypothesized that the difference was due to low mortality among juveniles over a certain size, which is also seen in some modern large mammals, like elephants. This low mortality may have resulted from a lack of predation, since tyrannosaurs surpassed all contemporaneous predators in size by the age of two.

40|$|Abstract During {{substorm}} <b>growth</b> <b>phases,</b> magnetic reconnection at the magnetopause extracts ~ 1015 J {{from the}} solar wind which is then stored in the magnetotail lobes. Plasma sheet pressure increases to balance magnetic flux density increases in the lobes. Here we examine plasma sheet pressure, density, and temperature during substorm <b>growth</b> <b>phases</b> using 9 years of Cluster data (> 316, 000 data points). We show that plasma sheet pressure and temperature are higher during <b>growth</b> <b>phases</b> with higher solar wind driving, whereas the density is approximately constant. We also show a weak correlation between plasma sheet temperature before onset and theminimum SuperMAG AL (SML) auroral index in the subsequent substorm.

Currie claims this as evidence of pack behavior. Other scientists are skeptical, observing that the animals may have been driven together by drought, flood or for other reasons.|$|E
5|$|A {{hypothesis}} of Albertosaurus life history postulates that hatchlings died in large numbers, {{but have not}} been preserved in the fossil record due to their small size and fragile construction. After just two years, juveniles were larger than any other predator in the region aside from adult Albertosaurus, and more fleet of foot than most of their prey animals. This resulted in a dramatic decrease in their mortality rate and a corresponding rarity of fossil remains. Mortality rates doubled at age twelve, perhaps {{the result of the}} physiological demands of the rapid <b>growth</b> <b>phase,</b> and then doubled again with the onset of sexual maturity between the ages of fourteen and sixteen. This elevated mortality rate continued throughout adulthood, perhaps due to the high physiological demands of procreation, including stress and injuries received during intraspecific competition for mates and resources, and eventually, the ever-increasing effects of senescence. The higher mortality rate in adults may explain their more common preservation. Very large animals were rare because few individuals survived long enough to attain such sizes. High infant mortality rates, followed by reduced mortality among juveniles and a sudden increase in mortality after sexual maturity, with very few animals reaching maximum size, is a pattern observed in many modern large mammals, including elephants, African buffalo, and rhinoceros. The same pattern is also seen in other tyrannosaurids. The comparison with modern animals and other tyrannosaurids lends support to this life history hypothesis, but bias in the fossil record may still play a large role, especially since more than two-thirds of all Albertosaurus specimens are known from one locality.|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of reduced impact logging were evaluated on the <b>growth</b> <b>phases</b> of a terra firme {{forest in the}} Paragominas region, state of Pará, that was logged considering two intensities of timber harvesting. Data were collected in 36 permanent sample plots (0. 25 ha) randomly distributed among treatments (T 1 – Logged forest, harvesting the stem of commercial trees; T 2 – Logged forest, harvesting the stem and coarse woody debris) and control (T 0 unlogged forest). Three <b>growth</b> <b>phases</b> of the forest were considered: mature (DBH > 40 cm); building forest (10 cm 10 cm). The homogeneity of variances of sub-plots between treatments, <b>growth</b> <b>phases</b> and years was tested by the Bonferroni test, according to the statistics of Bartlett and Levene. An {{analysis of variance was}} applied on the number of sub-plots by phases, years and treatments at a 0. 005 significance level. The Tukey test was applied for analyzing the interaction between the phases and years. Before logging the percentage of <b>growth</b> <b>phases</b> were: 57. 0 % building forest, 38. 9 % mature forest and 4. 1 % canopy gaps. Logging reduced the areas of mature forest and building forest, increasing the number of canopy gaps, but this increase had no statistical difference. One year after logging the area of mature forest (38. 4 %) and building forest (53. 1 %) increased while the areas of gaps (8. 4 %) decreased. Three years after logging the percentage of mature forest (37. 1 %), building forest (57. 9 %) and gaps (5. 0 %) were similar to those found before logging.
