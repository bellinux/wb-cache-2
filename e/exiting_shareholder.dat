40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of share {{repurchase}} through transferable put rights (TPRs) on shareholder wealth and corporate control. Transferable put rights make the put option, which is implicit in a tender offer, marketable. Shareholders who do not tender their shares increase their proportional ownership of the firm and extract some of the gains of the tender offer from <b>exiting</b> <b>shareholders.</b> Finally, TPRs improve tax efficiency by ensuring that only shareholders who have the highest tax bases will tender...|$|R

Kwong Lee Bank Berhad was renamed Malayan United Bank Berhad on 2 February 1983. Subsequently it was renamed MUI Bank Bhd. Under the MUI banner the bank grew from 11 branches (including Singapore) to 35 branches.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{compares the}} dutch auction and {{transferable}} put rights (TPRs) share repurchase mechanisms {{to the traditional}} fixed-price tender offer in terms of efficiency, wealth transfers, and corporate control. Using Monte Carlo simulations, it is shown that both alternative mechanisms reduce the deadweight losses from inefficient tendering by ensuring that shareholders with the lowest reservation prices are bought out first. The TPR mechanism is further distinguished because it provides greater wealth gains to nontendering and smaller gains to <b>exiting</b> <b>shareholders.</b> The dutch auction mechanism has an efficiency advantage over the TPR {{because it can be}} designed to eliminate the possibility of undersubscription and, furthermore, is also a more effective takeover deterrent...|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} theoretical literature {{argues that}} the threat of exit can be an e¤ective governance device when the blockholder is a principal. However, many blockholders are money managers. Di¤erent types of money managers care to di¤erent degrees about investor ows. We show that when blockholders are su ¢ ciently ow-motivated, exit will fail as a disciplining device, while if they are su ¢ ciently pro 8 ̆ 5 t-motivated, it is e¤ective. This generates testable implications across di¤erent classes of funds. We show {{that the threat of}} <b>exit</b> complements <b>shareholder</b> voice, and thus provide an explanation for the observed variation in how di¤erent types of funds use voice. ...|$|R
50|$|Drag-along right (DAR) is a {{legal concept}} in {{corporate}} law. The right assures that if the majority shareholder sells their stake, minority holders are forced to join the deal. This right protects majority shareholders. A drag-along right gives the investing shareholder the right to force the other investor(s) to exit, should the investing <b>shareholder</b> <b>exit,</b> again, usually on the same price and terms. Drag-along rights are fairly standard terms in a stock purchase agreement. Drag-along rights typically terminate upon an initial public offering.|$|R
50|$|The {{partnership}} between EABL and SAB Miller in Tanzania went through turbulence in 2009, EABL claiming {{breach of contract}} by Tanzania Breweries (TBL) that led to low quality of EABL’s drinks that were produced by TBL and restriction of some of Diageo’s and EABL brands to enter the Tanzanian market. This led to EABL’s acquisition of 51% of Serengeti Breweries Limited (SBL) and <b>exit</b> from TBL's <b>shareholder</b> structure through a $71.5 million successful secondary offer on the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange in 2011. SAB Miller sold it stake Kenya Breweries to East African Breweries.|$|R

40|$|In this Essay, I {{challenge}} the conventional corporate law wisdom that unhappy mutual fund investors paying high fees don’t need litigation or regulation {{to protect their}} interests because they should simply exit a fund and reinvest elsewhere. The exit solution, advanced by Professors John Morley and Quinn Curtis in Taking Exit Rights Seriously provided an elegantly simply {{solution to the problem}} of unhappy indirect investors (e. g., mutual fund investors) given that they are often low-dollar, low-incentive, rationally-apathetic investors facing enormous information asymmetries and collective action problems. According to their view, competition produced by exit, or the threat of exit, is the key to mitigating high fees in the mutual fund market. But what if some mutual fund investors are stuck and exit is, for them, an empty option? Such is the case for citizen shareholders who are the fastest growing group of new securities investors: those who enter the securities market through self-directed, defined contribution retirement plans such as a 401 (k) —and who invest heavily in mutual funds and other securities. Drawing upon more recent scholarship by Ian Ayres and Quinn Curtis, Beyond Diversification, showing the continuing problem of high mutual fund fees, I examine the implications of hindered <b>exit</b> for citizen <b>shareholders.</b> Investing through defined contribution plans (i) adds investment costs; (ii) distorts competitive forces through limited exit options, conflicts of interests and share classes; (iii) fractures oversight liability; and (iv) introduces unique switching costs. These differences create a competitive disadvantage for retirement investors who are relatively locked-in with diluted exit rights. Thus, for citizen <b>shareholders,</b> <b>exit</b> and competition are not the hoped-for panacea. This Essay redirects corporate law scholarship’s attention to these unsophisticated, passive, and apathetic, but also socially and financially important, investors. Elusive exit suggests the need to reexamine regulatory and litigation strategies to better serve citizen shareholders...|$|R
40|$|NoThe authors present {{findings}} from the initial phase of an ongoing externally funded research project into senior executive perceptions {{of the impact of}} capital taxation upon unquoted companies incorporated in the United Kingdom. Open-ended interviews were conducted with the senior executives of six unquoted companies which are also multigenerational family businesses. The interviews guided the executives to explore the history of their company; the values and aspirations of the founding or owning family(ies); the impact of capital taxation regimes, previous and current, both on ownership and on management succession; and strategies being pursued. Using content analysis to identify key themes, the authors suggest that their findings indicate that capital taxation may have a major impact both on ownership and on management succession as well as on succession planning. However, the current capital tax regime in the United Kingdom is perceived to be more favourable than that of previous regimes and vis-aé-vis the regimes currently operating in most European countries. Capital taxation is not thought to influence strategic or operational decisions either positively or negatively. Companies use taxation-planning devices, frequently involving trusts, {{in order to reduce the}} actual burden of capital taxation falling upon individual shareholders at ownership succession. The present capital taxation regime, which includes gift relief and business asset taper relief within capital gains tax, and 100 % business property relief within inheritance tax, eases succession planning.
