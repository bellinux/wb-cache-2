40|$|This thesis {{provides}} {{an examination of}} the impact of the switch by news readers from print newspapers to news Web sites and other digital news media. The method is qualitative research in the form of a series of in-person interviews with top level <b>editors</b> <b>at</b> nine <b>large</b> national and regional U. S. newspapers.

40|$|Editorial {{peer review}} {{has often been}} blamed for the {{stifling}} of truly innovative scientific ideas but we hear little complaint from the authors of those works of great innovative significance that were immediately welcomed by funders, reviewers, <b>editors,</b> and scientists <b>at</b> <b>large.</b> We have no useful data, but if peer review indeed suppresses the new, {{this may be due}} to the underlying tension between creative ideas and the need for journals and grant giving bodies to ensure some basic level of quality control. Editors and funders have an interest in innovation, and must constantly remind themselves of this.
