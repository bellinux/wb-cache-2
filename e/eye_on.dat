In Albertosaurus, Gorgosaurus and Daspletosaurus, there is a prominent horn in front of each <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> the lacrimal bone. The lacrimal horn is absent in Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus, which instead have a crescent-shaped crest behind each <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> the postorbital bone.

In any event, Fuller remained chief justice throughout Roosevelt's presidency.|$|E

Shortly thereafter, the guards put up signs declaring that if other escape {{attempts were}} made, tenprisoners would be executed for every escapee.
