Two studies comparing <b>desirudin</b> with enoxaparin (a LMWH) or unfractionated heparin have been performed. In both studies <b>desirudin</b> {{was considered to be}} superior in preventing VTE. <b>Desirudin</b> also reduced the rate of proximal deep vein thrombosis. Bleeding rates were similar with <b>desirudin</b> and heparin.|$|E
50|$|It is {{difficult}} to extract large amounts of hirudin from natural sources, so a method for producing and purifying this protein using recombinant biotechnology has been developed. This {{has led to the}} development and marketing of a number of hirudin-based anticoagulant pharmaceutical products, such as lepirudin (Refludan), hirudin derived from Hansenula (Thrombexx, Extrauma) and <b>desirudin</b> (Revasc/Iprivask). Several other direct thrombin inhibitors are derived chemically from hirudin.|$|E
50|$|Hirudin {{derivatives}} are all bivalent DTIs, they block {{both the}} active site and exosite 1 in an irreversible 1:1 stoichiometric complex. The active site is the binding {{site for the}} globular amino-terminal domain and exosite 1 is the binding site for the acidic carboxy-terminal domain of hirudin. Native hirudin, a 65-amino-acid polypeptide, is produced in the parapharyngeal glands of medicinal leeches. Hirudins today are produced by recombinant biotechnology using yeast. These recombinant hirudins lack a sulfate group at Tyr-63 and are therefore called desulfatohirudins. They have a 10-fold lower binding affinity to thrombin compared to native hirudin, but remain a highly specific inhibitor of thrombin and have an inhibition constant for thrombin in the picomolar range. Renal clearance and degradation account {{for the most part}} for the systemic clearance of desulfatohirudins and there is accumulation of the drug in patients with renal insufficiency. These drugs should not be used in patients with impaired renal function, since there is no specific antidote available to reverse the effects. Hirudins are given parenteraly, usually by intravenous injection. 80% of hirudin is distributed in the extravascular compartment and only 20% is found in the plasma. The most common desulfatohirudins today are lepirudin and <b>desirudin.</b>|$|E
50|$|Anticoagulation {{therapy has}} a long history. In 1884 John Berry Haycraft {{described}} a substance found in the saliva of leeches, Hirudo medicinalis, that had anticoagulant effects. He named the substance ‘Hirudine’ from the Latin name. Interestingly the use of medicinal leeches can be dated back {{all the way to}} ancient Egypt. In the early 20th century Jay McLean, L. Emmet Holt Jr. and William Henry Howell discovered the anticoagulant heparin, which they isolated from the liver (hepar). Heparin {{remains one of the most}} effective anticoagulants and is still used today, although it has its disadvantages, such as requiring intravenous administration and having a variable dose-response curve due to substantial protein binding. In the 1980s low molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) were developed. They are derived from heparin by enzymatic or chemical depolymerization and have better pharmacokinetic properties compared to heparin. In 1955 the first clinical use of warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist, was reported. Warfarin was originally used as a rat poison in 1948 and thought to be unsafe for humans, but an unsuccessful suicide attempt suggested that it was relatively safe for humans. Vitamin K antagonists are the most commonly used oral anticoagulants today and warfarin was the 11th most prescribed drug in the United States in 1999 and is actually the most widely prescribed oral anticoagulant worldwide. Warfarin has its disadvantages though, just like heparin, such as a narrow therapeutic index and multiple food and drug interactions and it requires routine anticoagulation monitoring and dose adjustment. Since both heparin and warfarin have their downsides the search for alternative anticoagulants has been ongoing and DTIs are proving to be worthy competitors. The first DTI was actually hirudin, which became more easily available with genetic engineering. It is now available in a recombinant form as lepirudin (Refludan) and <b>desirudin</b> (Revasc, Iprivask). Development of other DTIs followed with the hirudin analog, bivalirudin, and then the small molecular DTIs. However, such DTIs were also having side effects such as bleeding complications and liver toxicity, and their long-term effects were in doubt.|$|E
40|$|Deep vein {{thrombosis}} {{is a serious}} complication of orthopaedic surgery {{and can lead to}} pulmonary embolism and long term post-thrombotic syndrome. A simulation model based on both epidemiological data and data from clinical trials was used to compare the long term cost effectiveness of standard prophylaxis with subcutaneous unfractionated heparin with that of <b>desirudin</b> (recombinant hirudin), in patients undergoing elective hip replacement. The analysis, which was performed before the price of <b>desirudin</b> was set, showed that prophylactic treatment with <b>desirudin</b> saved 4. 5 life-years per 100 patients treated, compared with unfractionated heparin. <b>Desirudin</b> prophylaxis was dominant up to a total drug cost of 4400 Swedish kronor (SEK) per treatment. The results were robust against changes in the parameters used in several sensitivity analyses. This study showed that prophylactic therapy with <b>desirudin</b> compared with unfractionated heparin was more cost effective and potentially cost saving under a wide range of assumptions concerning the future price of <b>desirudin</b> in preventing deep {{vein thrombosis}} following elective hip surgery.

40|$|Objectives: This {{prospective}} pharmacoeconomic study {{analyses and}} discusses the cost effectiveness (expressed as cost per life-year gained) of <b>desirudin</b> {{in comparison with}} a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), enoxaparin, as prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in total hip replacement. Methods: The cost effectiveness was analysed {{on the basis of}} results from a clinical trial that compared the recombinant hirudin, <b>desirudin,</b> with the LMWH, enoxaparin. The trial results regarding the incidence of DVT are included together with epidemiological data in a decision tree, simulating long term cost effectiveness of patients undergoing elective hip replacement. The model includes Markov processes simulating patients up to the age of 85 years, including the costs of DVT-related long term complications. Results: The average total thrombosis-related cost per patient under prophylactic therapy with enoxaparin is 7022 Swedish kronor (SEK) compared with SEK 7497 when using <b>desirudin</b> (1998 values). The total costs with <b>desirudin</b> are 7 % higher. Prophylaxis with <b>desirudin</b> in those patients undergoing elective hip replacement surgery adds, on average, 7 days of life per patient when compared with treatment using enoxaparin. This is equivalent to 1. 91 additional years of life per 100 patients treated. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of prophylaxis with <b>desirudin</b> in patients undergoing elective hip replacement surgery is SEK 24 864 per life-year gained in comparison with enoxaparin. Conclusion: The present study demonstrates that prophylactic therapy with <b>desirudin</b> is a cost-effective approach for the prevention of DVT in patients undergoing total hip replacement.

40|$|<b>Desirudin,</b> a subcutaneously (SC) {{administered}} direct thrombin inhibitor, {{is indicated}} for prevention of venous thromboembolic events (VTEs) after total joint replacement surgery. DESIR-ABLE (multicenter trial of <b>desirudin</b> for the prophylaxis of thrombosis: {{an alternative to}} heparin-based anticoagulation) was a multicenter, open-label, single-arm study of hospitalized patients requiring VTE protection designed to extend the safety profile for <b>desirudin</b> to include a broad population of perioperative/critically ill patients. The primary end point was major bleeding. A total of 516 patients undergoing major surgery (378, 73 %) or who were medically ill with prolonged immobility (138, 27 %) were enrolled at 19 centers and received <b>desirudin</b> 15 mg Q 12 H. Many patients had high-risk features for bleeding and thrombosis such as thrombocytopenia ( 35, n 145), and renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 60 mL/min, n 292). There were no major bleeds and no VTE-related deaths in this study. The DESIR-ABLE demonstrated the safety of <b>desirudin</b> in critically ill perioperative and med-ical patients.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Specific {{inhibition}} of thrombin {{is a new}} method {{for the prevention of}} postoperative deep-vein thrombosis. The objective of this multicenter, random-ized, double-blind study was to compare the efficacy and safety of <b>desirudin</b> (Revasc, CGP 39393; fifteen milligrams two times a day) with that of unfractionated heparin (5000 international units three times a day) in patients having a primary elective total hip replace-ment. The medications were administered subcutane-ously, starting preoperatively and continuing for eight to eleven days. The primary end point was a confirmed thromboembolic event during the treatment period. The presence of deep-vein thrombosis was evaluated with bilateral venograms, which were centrally assessed by two independent radiologists...|$|E
40|$|Pulmonary {{embolism}} is {{a potentially}} fatal disorder with a lethality rateof 30 % when not treated. A quick diagnosis is fundamental. Treatmentreduces mortality and morbidity, and improves {{quality of life}} by reducingthe probability of thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension and postthromboticsyndrome events. Standard treatment for patients withpulmonary embolism is full anticoagulation with non-fractionated orlow molecular weight heparin, associated with oral anticoagulation withwarfarin. Exceptions include patients with absolute contraindicationsfor anticoagulation, who may be submitted to insertion of an inferiorvena cava filter or to surgical or catheter embolectomy. Patients withhemodynamic instability are the primary candidates for thrombolytictherapy. New drugs have been developed and studied, such as directthrombin inhibitors (lepirudin, <b>desirudin,</b> bivalirudin, melagratan,ximelagratan, argatroban, and dabigratan) and selective factor Xainhibitors mediated by antithrombin III, represented by fondaparinux.

40|$|Despite {{important}} {{advances in}} the treatment of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and venous thromboembolism (VTE), these conditions continue to exact a heavy toll. Cardiovascular diseases, including the ACS components unstable angina, non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, are leading causes of death and morbidity in developed countries. VTE affects approximately 1 in 1000 people each year in the United States. Although antithrombotic therapy is the cornerstone of treatment for both conditions, the choice of agent has become increasingly complex. For decades, aspirin, heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin, and vitamin K antagonists, such as warfarin, were the only options available. In the past few years, however, {{advances in the}} understanding of the coagulation cascade have transformed drug development in the field of cardiology.

40|$|Introdution: Atherothrombosis and venous {{thromboembolism}} are {{the leading}} causes of morbidity and mortality. Anticoagulant therapy is crucial to decrease these factors by preventing the clotting of blood. Objective: Describe {{some of the new}} anticoagulant drugs, introduced in an attempt to overcome the limitations of traditional anticoagulant drugs (heparins, warfarin and acenocumarol). Method: Narrative literature review of relevant scientific articles published between 2006 and 2012. Results: A new strategy for the design of new antithrombotic drugs is based on selective inhibition of a specific coagulation factor, with potential to be more effective, safe and easy to use. These include direct thrombin inhibitors (dabigatran, bivalirudin, <b>desirudin,</b> lepirudin and argatroban) and factor Xa inhibitors (otamixaban, rivaroxaban, o apixaban, edoxaban and fondaparinux). Also, a new vitamin K antagonist has been developed, tecarfarin. This does not present the same limitations as the other, which is due essencially to the fact that is not metabolized by CYP 450 enzymes. Conclusion: Anticoagulant therapy has been the target of an intense review so that its use in the clinical practice becomes indeed innovative and revolutionary. Currently, in Portugal, only fondaparinux, the dabigatran etexilate and rivaroxaban have been approved and commercialized...|$|E
40|$|International audienceINDICATIONS: Direct inhibitors of thrombin, such as hirudin, are {{directed}} against the active site and the recognition site of thrombin. Because of their low-molecular-weight, they can inactivate thrombin bound to fibrin. Prevention of thromboembolic complications in patients undergoing primary total hip or knee replacement is now an authorized indication of <b>desirudin</b> in France. The recommended treatment for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is lepirudin {{when there is a}} clinically evident thrombosis and danaparoid sodium, a mixture of anticoagulant glycosaminoglycans in an antithrombotic prophylaxis setting. LMWH: Low-molecular weight heparins are not yet authorized in France for the treatment of pulmonary embolism. However, deep venous thrombosis can be securely treated with one daily fixed dose of nadroparin or tinzaparin. ORAL ANTICOAGULATION: The duration of anticoagulation therapy in patients with venous thromboembolism remains controversial. Three to six months of therapy is recommended after a first episode of venous thromboembolism; the shorter regimen may be chosen when there is an identifiable and transient risk factor, and the longer when the thrombosis is idiopathic. In the context of primary prevention of ischaemic heart disease low intensity oral anticoagulation could be recommended in men at high risk...|$|E
40|$|Leeches are {{hermaphroditic}} and hematophagous annelids. One important medical species, Hirudo medicinalis, {{comes from}} hirudiniculture {{of fresh water}} pools. Thanks to their three mandibles with some 300 teeth on their anterior muscular sucker, they easily grab to tissues and by secreting their saliva containing numerous powerful enzymes, such as hyaluronidase, collagenase and inhibitors of platelet aggregation and coagulation, like hirudin, allow blood sucking. Once they are full of blood (upto 15 g of blood), they detach themselves from their prey. Used ever since the 18 th Egyptian Dynasty, leeches became famous during {{the first part of}} the XIX th century, thanks to a French physician, François Joseph Victor Broussais, known to his adversaries as the "vampire of medicine", for treating various conditions such as phlebotomy, laryngitis, ocular problems, obesity, mental disorders, etc. Overfishing, therapeutic failures and most particularly, the emergence of hygiene, brought the decline of living leeches. In 1884, an extract of leeches was obtained - hirudin and henceforth used. Nowadays, leeches are still used in microsurgery to enhance the venous circulation in finger reimplantation or skin flap transposition. Hirudin is synthesized through recombinant DNA technology and molecules such as lepirudin and <b>desirudin</b> are available on the market as anticoagulant.

40|$|Direct thrombin-inhibitors {{inactivate}} {{not only}} free but also fibrin-bound thrombin. The group of parenteral direct thrombin-inhibitors includes the recombinant hirudins lepirudin and <b>desirudin,</b> the synthetic hirudin bivalirudin, {{and the small}} molecule argatroban. All these compounds do not interact with PF 4 /heparin-antibodies. Therefore, argatroban as well as bivalirudin are currently used to treat heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). The oral direct thrombin-inhibitor dabigatran etexilate is already licensed in many countries {{for the treatment of}} non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Dabigatran etexilate reveals a stable and predictable effect that allows a medication without dose adjustment or monitoring. The substance shows only few interactions with other drugs but strong inhibitors of p-glycoprotein can increase plasma levels of dabigatran substantially. After oral intake, the prodrug dabigatran etexilate is cleaved by esterase-mediated hydrolyses to the active compound dabigatran. Elimination of dabigatran is predominantly renal. Safety and efficacy of dabigatran etexilate were tested in an extensive clinical study program. Non-inferiority compared to current standard treatments was shown for prophylaxis of venous thromboembolic events after total knee and hip replacement, for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, and for treatment of acute venous thromboembolism. In daily practice, Dabigatran etexilate competes against the new direct factor Xa-inhibitors. In the absence of direct comparative clinical trials, it is not yet clear if one class of substances has distinct advantages over the other...|$|E
40|$|Background and Objective: Hirudin is an {{anticoagulant}} polypeptide secreted {{from the}} salivary glands of leeches. Recombinant hirudin {{is a strong}} anticoagulant agent in arterial and venous thrombosis. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of inserting protein A signal peptide sequence of pEZZ 18 plasmid on expression and secretion of the recombinant hirudin in E. coli. Methods: the synthetic hirudin gene was amplified by PCR using specific primers. First, the gene was purified and cloned into PTG 19 -T cloning vector, and then it was subcloned into pEZZ 18 expression vector by SalI / SacI enzymatic digestion and finally transformed into E. coli JM 107. After the expression of recombinant hirudin protein, different cellular fractions were isolated and analyzed on SDS-PAGE and further confirmed by Western blotting. Results: PCR product (522 bp) was first subcloned into the T-Vector (replicating vector) and then successfully subcloned into the pEZZ 18 (expression vector). Cloning and subclonig were confirmed by enzymatic digestion and Colony PCR. After the expression and isolation of fractions, the presence of hirudin (about 29 kDa) in different cell fractions due to the effects of signal peptide was observed in SDS-PAGE and finally confirmed by Western blotting. Conclusion: The gene of anticoagulant hirudin protein (<b>desirudin)</b> was cloned into the pEZZ 18 vector containing Protein A signal peptide sequence and later transformed into E. coli JM 107.
