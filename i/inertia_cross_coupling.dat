The symmetric <b>cross</b> <b>coupled</b> low pass ΣΔ modulator, enhances performance and stability when compared to conventional noise shaping sigma delta modulators and achieves up to 2 Nth order noise shaping from N-path <b>cross</b> <b>coupling</b> with better in-band noise rejection without sacrificing conversion rate and bandwidth. Here, over-loading levels of symmetric <b>cross</b> <b>coupled</b> ΣΔ modulatorsare predicted and compared with time domain simulations for sinusoidal signals.

40|$|Multiloop pilot/vehicle {{analysis}} {{is applied to}} the problem of determining crossfeed techniques which may be employed by pilots in minimizing the effects of vehicle <b>cross</b> <b>coupling.</b> As used here, <b>cross</b> <b>coupling</b> refers to unwanted vehicle motion which occurs in one control axis or loop as the result of pilot control actuation in another control axis or loop. The minimization or elimination of such <b>cross</b> <b>coupling</b> can contribute significantly to the 'workload' associated with tasks like nap-of-the-earth helicopter flight. In contrast, situations arise in which pilot's may use vehicle <b>cross</b> <b>coupling</b> to improve performance by coordinating two control actuations in the control of a single response variable. A crossfeed model is developed based upon simple control system design principles and configured in a manner amenable to pilot pursuit or precognitive control activity. A handling qualities theory developed to analyze single loop tasks {{is applied to the}} multiloop problem. The crossfeed model is applied to five different vehicles/configurations ranging from helicopters to fighter aircraft.

In Chapter One presents {{a brief overview of}} previously reported molecular cages, the concept of expanded ligands, applications of ruthenium polypyridyl complexes and how they are used for building large structures. Chapter Two covers investigations into the synthesis of bromo functionalized and boronic acid functionalized ruthenium(II) mononuclear complexes with pendent pyridine sites. The functionalized ruthenium(II) complexes are suitable for Sonogashira <b>cross</b> <b>coupling</b> reaction and Suzuki <b>cross</b> <b>coupling</b> reaction.

40|$|Abstract—An ultra {{wide band}} (UWB) band-pass filter (BPF) {{utilizing}} one modified composite-right/left-handed (CRLH) unit cell is proposed. By introducing the capacitive <b>cross</b> <b>coupling</b> {{to the traditional}} CRLH structure, the phase shift in the right-handed pass-band can be controlled, meanwhile, the <b>cross</b> <b>coupling</b> has negligible effect on the left-handed pass-band. The appropriate <b>cross</b> <b>coupling</b> can create three controllable transmission zeros. Thus, an UWB BPF with high selectivity is developed using only one unit cell, which leads to low insertion loss (less than 1. 35 dB) and compact size (0. 47 λ 0 × 0. 28 λ 0). The fabricated filter exhibits a rejection level higher than 20 dB at the stop-band from 11. 95 – 16 GHz and flat group delay across the pass-band. 1...|$|R
