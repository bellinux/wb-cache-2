500|$|Steiger was so {{devoted to}} his craft that during the 1970s he turned to many foreign productions, {{especially}} in Italy, to obtain the sort of roles he desired, but often clashed with directors over his method acting techniques. In {{one of his last}} interviews, Steiger said: [...] "What is the greatest thing an artist in any profession can give to a person?—that would be a constructive, warm memory. Because that gets into your brain and therefore <b>into</b> <b>your</b> <b>life,</b> so to speak. And that's it, when somebody says to me 'I'll never forget', that's worth more to me than five Academy Awards, I'm in that person's life".|$|E

Following the second chorus, Grande sings the hook, [...] "All girls wanna be like that/Bad girls underneath, like that/You know how I'm feeling inside" [...] accompanied by an electronic riff reminiscent of trap music. A reviewer from Sputnikmusic noted that the track's lyrics are [...] "a cross between sexually charged and fully empowering." [...] Commenting about the lyrical content of [...] "Dangerous Woman", Grande stated: [...] "This song is about an empowered woman who meets another person that brings out a different side of her. It's her decision to put her fears aside and explore these new feelings. It's about letting someone <b>into</b> <b>your</b> <b>life</b> in an intimate and vulnerable way and not letting that take away from your independence and strength." ...|$|E

40|$|This {{study of}} the {{dynamics}} of spiritual leadership will focus on your personal development as a leader in three areas: life maturing, inner life maturing, and ministry maturing. The primary methodology for this course will be a biographical; a heuristic model will be used for a life-history approach to understanding spiritual influence. Our goal is to capture principles of spiritual formation in our own lives in order to become more effective leaders and mentors. Because spiritual gifts, life experiences, and personality uniquely equip us to serve God, we do not all develop the same way at the same time. However, the study of patterns of development can yield principles for application to mentoring. This study will leave you with a greater awareness of God at work in <b>your</b> <b>life.</b> To some degree, this will be a practicum in the providence of God with an emphasis on the implications for spiritual formation and mentoring. Course Objectives 1. To increase your spiritual influence to the honor of God. 2. To develop the ability to draw spiritual principles from life experiences. 3. To gain new insights <b>into</b> <b>your</b> own <b>life</b> story and see how God is working in <b>your</b> <b>life.</b> 4. To become a mentor and spiritual guide for others...|$|R
