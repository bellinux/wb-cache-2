On March 11, 2008, <b>David</b> <b>Axelrod</b> demanded that Clinton sever ties with Geraldine Ferraro, a top Clinton fundraiser and 1984 Democratic vice-presidential nominee, who said publicly that Obama was a major presidential contender only because he is a black man. Obama widened his lead over Clinton in the overall delegate count when he was declared the winner of the March 4 Texas caucuses on March 12, 2008. Obama and Clinton would both statistically tie McCain in a general election matchup, according to a CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll released March 18, 2008. The National Archives on March 19, 2008, released more than 11,000 pages of Clinton's schedule when she was first lady. Obama's campaign had pushed for release of the documents, arguing that their review was necessary to make a full evaluation of Clinton's experience as first lady.

500|$|In 1968, <b>David</b> <b>Axelrod</b> gained {{national}} fame for {{his controversial}} mass composition Mass in F Minor, {{which he wrote}} in a contemporary rock vein for the Electric Prunes. Axelrod, who was challenged by what he described as a [...] "new breed of record buyer ... more sophisticated in his thinking", was one of several Los Angeles-based musical eccentrics during the late 1960s who expanded on the mid-1960s studio experiments of Brian Wilson and George Martin. After his success with the Electric Prunes, he was asked to record a similar album by Capitol Records, for whom he worked as a staff producer and songwriter. Axelrod wanted to further capitalize on the experimental climate of popular music at the time and chose to adapt works by English poet William Blake on an album.|$|E
500|$|Obama {{later said}} he got [...] "my rear end handed to me" [...] in his loss to Rush and {{acknowledged}} his own hubris. However, many analysts believe that Obama's loss helped him to learn from his mistakes, which enabled him to run more successful campaigns in 2004 and 2008. [...] Obama {{was seen as a}} stiff policy wonk, and he used the experience to hone his ability to connect with voters. [...] According to Chicago City Council member Toni Preckwinkle, an early Obama supporter, Obama [...] "took a hard look at himself after that campaign and became a much better campaigner, more at ease on the campaign trail." [...] He put more effort into his campaign, hiring <b>David</b> <b>Axelrod</b> as his chief political strategist.

The song was sampled by R&B trio City High for their 2001 hit [...] "What Would You Do". It was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group in 2001 for Dre and Snoop. The award, however, went to Dre and Eminem for [...] "Forgot About Dre". The edit released for radio and music channels was heavily edited and had many re-recorded lines and muted censors as well as some removing the [...] "smoke weed every day" [...] part which Nate Dogg says at the very end.

500|$|Under {{instructions}} from the Obama campaign, Biden kept his speeches succinct and tried to avoid off-hand remarks, such as one about Obama's being tested by a foreign power soon after taking office, which had attracted negative attention. Privately, Obama was frustrated by Biden's remarks, saying [...] "How many times is Biden gonna say something stupid?" [...] Obama campaign staffers referred to Biden blunders as [...] "Joe bombs" [...] and kept Biden uninformed about strategy discussions, which in turn irked Biden. Relations between the two campaigns became strained for a month, until Biden apologized on a call to Obama and the two built a stronger partnership. Publicly, Obama strategist <b>David</b> <b>Axelrod</b> said that any unexpected comments had been outweighed by Biden's high popularity ratings. [...] Nationally, Biden had a 60percent favorability rating in a Pew Research Center poll, compared to Palin's 44percent.|$|E

However, the original group disbanded by 1968 when they proved unable to record the innovative and complex arrangements by <b>David</b> <b>Axelrod</b> on the albums Mass in F Minor and Release of an Oath. Both albums were released under the band's name, the rights to which were owned by their record producer David Hassinger, but were largely performed by other musicians.
