Increasingly both <b>general</b> <b>waste</b> and recycling options are provided. Local councils pick the waste up and take it to reuse or recycling. However, there are issues with this approach. If the bins are not regularly emptied, then overfilling of bins occurs and can increase litter indirectly. Some local authorities will only take responsibility for rubbish that is placed in the bins, which means that litter remains a problem. People may blame a lack of well-placed bins for their littering. Hazardous materials may be incorrectly disposed of in the bins and they can encourage dumpster diving.|$|E

40|$|Background and purpose: Hospitals {{and health-care}} centers {{are the major}} sources of {{hazardous}} waste generation. Hospital wastes should be collected and disposed under certain conditions. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate hospitals waste generation in Gorgan, Iran. Materials and methods: The study was performed in 8 hospitals including 3 educational hospitals and 5 non-educational hospitals in Gorgan, 2014. Waste generation was investigated in 4 consecutive months, three times a week. Weighting was performed 384 times (48 times in each hospital). Mann-Whitney and nonparametric correlation test were used for data analysis. Results: The results showed 40. 27 hazardous and 59. 73 <b>general</b> <b>wastes</b> were generated in hospitals. The mean rates of <b>waste</b> <b>general</b> and hazardous generation were 2. 63 and 1. 03 kg/bed/day, respectively. These rates in educational and non-educational hospitals were 3. 75 and 1. 96 kg/bed/day, respectively. Conclusion: Generation of hazardous waste was found to be high in Gorgan hospitals. Also, the educational hospitals generated more waste than non-educational hospitals. Therefore, necessary measures should be taken to reduce the generation of waste, especially hazardous waste. © 2015, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences. All rights reserved...|$|R

6000|$|... 90. Of course {{all good}} poetry, {{descriptive}} of rural life, is essentially pastoral, or {{has the effect}} of the pastoral on the minds of men living in cities; but the class of poetry which I mean, and which you probably understand by the term pastoral, is that in which a farmer's girl is spoken of as a [...] "nymph," [...] and a farmer's boy as a [...] "swain," [...] and in which, throughout, a ridiculous and unnatural refinement is supposed to exist in rural life, merely because the poet himself has neither had the courage to endure its hardships, nor the wit to conceive its realities. If you examine the literature of the 17th and 18th centuries you will find that nearly all its expressions, having reference to the country, show something of this kind; either a foolish sentimentality, or a morbid fear, both of course coupled with the most curious ignorance. You will find all its descriptive expressions at once vague and monotonous. Brooks are always [...] "purling;" [...] birds always [...] "warbling;" [...] mountains always [...] "lift their horrid peaks above the clouds;" [...] vales always [...] "are lost in the shadow of gloomy woods;" [...] a few more distinct ideas about hay-making and curds and cream, acquired in the neighborhood of Richmond Bridge, serving to give an occasional appearance of freshness to the catalogue of the sublime and beautiful which descended from poet to poet; while a few true pieces of pastoral, like the [...] "Vicar of Wakefield," [...] and Walton's [...] "Angler," [...] relieved the <b>general</b> <b>waste</b> of dullness. Even in these better productions, nothing is more remarkable than the general conception of the country merely as a series of green fields, and the combined ignorance and dread of more sublime scenery; of which the mysteries and dangers were enhanced by the difficulties of traveling at the period. Thus in Walton's [...] "Angler," [...] you have a meeting of two friends, one a Derbyshire man, the other a lowland traveler, who is as much alarmed, and uses nearly as many expressions of astonishment, at having to go down a steep hill and ford a brook, as a traveler uses now at crossing the glacier of the Col du Géant. I am not sure whether the difficulties which, until late years, have lain in the way of peaceful and convenient traveling, ought not to have great weight assigned to them among the other causes of the temper of the period; but be that as it may, if you will examine the whole range of its literature--keeping this point in view--I am well persuaded that you will be struck most forcibly by the strange deadness to the higher sources of landscape sublimity which is mingled with the morbid pastoralism. The love of fresh air and green grass forced itself upon the animal natures of men; but that of the sublimer features of scenery had no place in minds whose chief powers had been repressed by the formalisms of the age. And although in the second-rate writers continually, and in the first-rate ones occasionally, you find an affectation of interest in mountains, clouds, and forests, yet whenever they write from their heart, you will find an utter absence of feeling respecting anything beyond gardens and grass. Examine, for instance, the novels of Smollett, Fielding, and Sterne, the comedies of Molière, and the writings of Johnson and Addison, and I do not think you will find a single expression of true delight in sublime nature in any one of them. Perhaps Sterne's [...] "Sentimental Journey," [...] in its total absence of sentiment on any subject but humanity, and its entire want of notice of anything at Geneva, which might not as well have been seen at Coxwold, is the most striking instance I could give you; and if you compare with this negation of feeling on one side, the interludes of Molière, in which shepherds and shepherdesses are introduced in court dress, you will have a very accurate conception of the general spirit of the age.|$|E
