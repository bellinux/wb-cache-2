25|$|Below an {{extremely}} high temperature, electroweak symmetry breaking causes the electroweak interaction to manifest {{in part as}} the short-ranged weak force, which is carried by massive gauge bosons. This symmetry breaking is required for atoms and other structures to form, {{as well as for}} nuclear reactions in stars, such as our Sun. However, it is not yet clear how symmetry breaking happens in nature. The Higgs field may provide a mechanism for this observed symmetry breaking. Further measurements will be needed to validate whether the Standard Model <b>is</b> <b>correct</b> <b>in</b> its approach and if it can be made more exact.|$|E
25|$|The {{variance}} between Massorah and Septuagint {{texts in}} this numeration is likely enough {{due to a}} gradual neglect of the original poetic form of the Psalms; such neglect was occasioned by liturgical uses and carelessness of copyists. It is generally admitted that Pss. 9 and 10 were originally a single acrostic poem; they have been wrongly separated by Massorah, rightly united by the Septuagint and Vulgate. Pss. 42 and 43 are shown by identity of subject (yearning for the house of Jahweh), of metrical structure and of refrain (cf. Heb. Ps. 42:6, 12; 43:5), to be three strophes of {{one and the same}} poem. The Hebrew text <b>is</b> <b>correct</b> <b>in</b> counting as one Ps. 146 and Ps. 147. Later liturgical usage would seem to have split up these and several other psalms. Zenner combines into what he deems were the original choral odes: Pss. 1, 2, 3, 4; 6 + 13; 9 + 10; 19, 20, 21; 56 + 57; 69 + 70; 114 + 115; 148, 149, 150. A choral ode would seem to have been the original form of Pss. 14 and 70. The two strophes and the epode are Ps. 14; the two antistrophes are Ps. 70. It is noteworthy that, on the breaking up of the original ode, each portion crept twice into the Psalter: Ps. 14 = 53, Ps. 70 = 40:14–18. Other such duplicated portions of psalms are Ps. 108:2–6 = Ps. 57:8–12; Ps. 108:7–14 = Ps. 60:7–14; Ps. 71:1–3 = Ps. 31:2–4. This loss of the original form of some of the psalms is allowed by the Biblical Commission (1 May 1910) to have been due to liturgical practices, neglect by copyists, or other causes.|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, Darryl Weaver {{attempts}} to browbeat Skinner, threatening to light {{one of the}} toxic cigarettes. As Weaver {{attempts to}} leave the building, Skinner shoots Weaver's shoulder and the pane of glass behind him, leaving him injured and covered in glass.

She <b>is</b> <b>correct</b> <b>in</b> her solution, noting that Weaver’s nicotine tolerance didn’t allow the tobacco beetles to develop in his lungs. Scully administers nicotine to Mulder, who in turn recovers, albeit with a sore throat, as well as a minor addiction to nicotine, which drives him to buy a pack of Morley cigarettes for himself. [...] Chided by Scully, he throws them out, but then stares at them pensively after she leaves.|$|E
500|$|The contradictions {{may be seen}} clearly by calculating dates by {{different}} methods from the various sources. [...] The first event in West Saxon history, the date {{of which can be}} regarded as reasonably certain, is the baptism of Cynegils, which occurred in the late 630s, perhaps as late as 640. The Chronicle dates Cerdic's arrival to 495, but adding up the lengths of the reigns as given in the West Saxon Genealogical Regnal List, leads to the conclusion that Cerdic's reign might have started in 532, a difference of 37 years. [...] Neither 495 nor 532 may be treated as reliable, however, the latter date relies on the presumption that the Regnal List <b>is</b> <b>correct</b> <b>in</b> presenting the Kings of Wessex as having succeeded one another, with no omitted kings, no joint kingships, and that the durations of the reigns are correct as given. None of these presumptions may be made safely.|$|E

500|$|According to Lord Scarman, Zamir {{limited the}} scope of {{judicial}} review to the Wednesbury principle – in other words, the court will not intervene to quash a decision of a statutory authority unless it can be shown that the authority acted unreasonably. He held that although the principle <b>is</b> <b>correct</b> <b>in</b> appropriate circumstances, [...] "it cannot extend to interference with liberty unless Parliament has unequivocably enacted that it should". He emphasized that if Parliament wished to exclude judicial review of the exercise of a power that restrained liberty, [...] "it must make its meaning crystal clear". On the facts, since Parliament had not clearly expressed any intention to exclude judicial review of discretion exercised by the immigration authorities, the statutory provision in question fell within the precedent fact category. Ultimately, Khera's appeal was allowed as the authorities had not successfully demonstrated that he had obtained permission to enter the UK by deception. Conversely, since Khawaja had clearly deceived an immigration officer concerning his marital status, his appeal was dismissed.|$|E
