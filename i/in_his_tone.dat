25|$|Strauss's next opera was Elektra (1909), {{which took}} {{his use of}} dissonance even further, in {{particular}} with the Elektra chord. Elektra {{was also the first}} opera in which Strauss collaborated with the poet Hugo von Hofmannsthal. The two subsequently worked together on numerous occasions. For his later works with Hofmannsthal, Strauss moderated his harmonic language: he used a more lush, melodic late-Romantic style based on Wagnerian chromatic harmonies that he had used <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>tone</b> poems, with much less dissonance, and exhibiting immense virtuosity in orchestral writing and tone color. This resulted in operas such as Der Rosenkavalier (1911) having great public success. Strauss continued to produce operas at regular intervals until 1942. With Hofmannsthal he created Ariadne auf Naxos (1912), Die Frau ohne Schatten (1919), Die ägyptische Helena (1928), and Arabella (1933). For Intermezzo (1924) Strauss provided his own libretto. Die schweigsame Frau (1935), was composed with Stefan Zweig as librettist; Friedenstag (1935–6) and Daphne (1937) both had a libretto by Joseph Gregor and Stefan Zweig; and Die Liebe der Danae (1940) was with Joseph Gregor. Strauss's final opera, Capriccio (1942), had a libretto by Clemens Krauss, although the genesis for it came from Stefan Zweig and Joseph Gregor.|$|E
500|$|In November 1997 at {{a conference}} in Princeton University Hata was confronted by Iris Chang, author of the book The Rape of Nanking, who asked him why he doubted the {{testimony}} of Japanese POWs who had stated that hundreds of thousands of Chinese were killed in the atrocity. When Hata replied that torture and coercion of Japanese POWs made their testimony unreliable Chang walked out and the audience became unruly, shouting Hata down and yelling insults at him. The moderator Perry Link barely kept the situation under control. In the wake of this incident, similar disruptions by Chinese students who disagreed with his death toll estimate prevented Hata from speaking at a number of universities that he visited. Bob Wakabayashi of York University argues that Hata became more strident <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>tone</b> following these attacks, once calling it the [...] "Nanking industry" [...] in comparison with Norman Finkelstein's [...] "Holocaust industry". In the 1980s Hata had stated that the death toll was 38,000 to 42,000 while holding out the possibility that it might have been as high as 60,000, but when he wrote the second edition of Nankin Jiken in 2007 he indicated that 42,000 massacred was the maximum possible and that the true number might have been lower.|$|E
500|$|... "The Don" [...] {{received}} universal acclaim {{from music}} critics, with Nas's lyrics drawing particular praise. Rico Barrino of Artistdirect praised Nas's rapping as {{being able to}} impress in different contexts, calling his lyrics [...] "both catchy and commanding" [...] and noted his [...] "precise, potent lyrical poetry honed by 20 years in the game". Writing for MTV News, Rob Markman called the production [...] "a sonic departure" [...] from Nas' previous work, but complimented his lyrics as [...] "vintage" [...] and pointed out {{the consistency of the}} lyrical quality throughout the song. In his review of [...] "The Don" [...] for About.com, Henry Adaso described the song as [...] "the type of lyrical exercise Nas only throws down once or twice per album", and that songs such as [...] "The Don" [...] gave a case for Nas' inclusion [...] "as one of hip-hop's all-time greats", also picking up on his [...] "assured" [...] boasts and the [...] "quiet confidence" [...] enveloped <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>tone.</b> Adaso also expressed a positive response towards the song's production, expressing his surprise that having three different producers working on the song had not led to a [...] "case of too many cooks in the kitchen", writing that [...] "instead, we get a cohesive, hard-hitting, face-melting, reggae-tinged beat". A reviewer of the song for DJBooth wrote of Nas' performance as [...] "at turns wistful, threatening and braggadocious", and praised the production's [...] "compulsively head-noddable groove". In their review of Life Is Good, Sputnikmusic recommended [...] "The Don" [...] to first-time listeners of Nas, stating to be an exhibition of Nas' [...] "incredible lyrical structures" [...] and [...] "how rapidly this guy can punch out the syllables". They also noted it as a [...] "change of pace" [...] from the more downtempo material on Life Is Good. In his review of Life Is Good for Prefix Magazine, Charlie Kaplan called [...] "The Don" [...] the album's [...] "clear highlight" [...] and felt it a fitting tribute to Heavy D's life and work, writing that it [...] "raises a glass to the recently departed overweight lover with a vivid tour of New York rap's classic soundscapes". For the chart week dated July 28, 2012, [...] "The Don" [...] debuted on the UK Singles Chart at number 196.|$|E

2500|$|In October 2003, {{while in}} the UK to promote her film In the Cut, Meg Ryan made a {{controversial}} appearance on Parkinson, which resulted in negative publicity. The press accused both Ryan and Parkinson of being rude to one another. Ryan gave a few one-word answers, and after she acknowledged that she wasn't comfortable with the interview, Parkinson {{asked her what she}} would do if she were in his position now. She replied that she would [...] "just wrap it up". Parkinson later revealed to the press that he felt her behaviour to his earlier guests, Trinny Woodall and Susannah Constantine, whom she turned her back on, was [...] "unforgivable". Ryan also commented that Parkinson was a [...] "nut" [...] and said that she was [...] "offended" [...] by him as he was like a [...] "disapproving father" [...] <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>tone.</b> A 2006 survey of British TV viewers, her behaviour on the show was voted the third [...] "most shocking" [...] TV chat show moment ever.|$|E
2500|$|Like Cream, Rush {{followed}} {{the model of}} a [...] "power trio", with Lee both playing bass and singing. Lee's vocals produced a distinctive, [...] "countertenor" [...] falsetto, and resonant sound. [...] Lee possessed a three-octave vocal range, from baritone through tenor, alto, and mezzo-soprano pitch ranges, although it has significantly decreased with age. Lee's playing style is widely regarded for his use of high treble and very hard playing of the strings, and for utilizing the bass as a lead instrument, often contrapuntal to Lifeson's guitar. In the 1970s and early 1980s, Lee mostly used a Rickenbacker 4001 bass, with a very noticeable grit <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>tone.</b> During the band's [...] "synth era" [...] in the mid-1980s, Lee used Steinberger and later Wal basses, with the latter having more of a [...] "jazzy" [...] tone, according to Lee. From 1993's Counterparts onward, Lee began using the Fender Jazz Bass almost exclusively, returning to his trademark high treble sound. Lee had first used the Jazz Bass during the recording of [...] Moving Pictures, on songs such as [...] "Tom Sawyer." ...|$|E
2500|$|Archibald now {{believes}} in a [...] "purposeful cause of universal action" [...] seemingly over and above, yet directing, {{the concerns of}} humans and their endeavors. Despite all of the political scheming and brave actions of individual adventurers, the force of fate lies underneath every event. Interestingly, Archibald Hunter is much more optimistic <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>tone</b> {{about the presence of}} fate than some characters in other novels of this genre and era who have had to confront the shortcomings of science or order in the natural world in the face of fate. H.G. Wells' Edward Prendick in The Island of Dr. Moreau, for example, sees a life without meaning once he observes the disorder caused by Moreau's science. Stoker's own Van Helsing from Dracula questions his medical knowledge once he realizes that he is dealing with an evil that cannot be cured by any medical remedy. Archibald does not seem to see the supernatural or fate as working against him—most of his immediate problems spring from political tensions and other human beings. Although Stoker takes advantage of the ominous effect that can be derived from invoking fate and supernatural forces, fate is ultimately portrayed as a force over and above the flaws of individuals and as something that can make amends for foolish human errors. The kidnappers are drowned, Don Bernardino regains his honor in death, and the mysterious Seer, Gormala, meets her end near the same bay where she first met Archibald Hunter, lending a sense of justice and closure to {{what could have been a}} dark story.|$|E
