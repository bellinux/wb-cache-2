500|$|Although the {{division}} of labour inherent in prescriptive technologies is usually associated with the industrial revolution, Franklin points out that such production methods have been used since ancient times. Chinese bronze casting before 1200 BC for example, required a tightly controlled and closely supervised production process {{as well as a}} strict division of labour. Franklin writes that when she studied Chinese bronze casting as a metallurgist, [...] "the extraordinary social meaning of prescriptive technologies dawned on me. <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> what they meant, not just in terms of casting bronze but in terms of discipline and planning, of organization and command." ...|$|E
500|$|In March it was {{announced}} that Carlsen had split from Kasparov and would no longer use him as a trainer, although this was put into different context by Carlsen himself {{in an interview with the}} German magazine Der Spiegel, in which he stated that they would remain in contact and he would continue to attend training sessions with Kasparov. In 2011, Carlsen said: [...] "Thanks to [...] <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> a whole class of positions better.... Kasparov gave me a great deal of practical help." [...] In 2012, when asked what he learnt from working with Kasparov, Carlsen answered: [...] "Complex positions. That was the most important thing." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{turning point}} in the book occurs when Rita {{falls in love with a}} gambler named L. D. Tolbrook, who seduces Rita and {{introduces}} her to prostitution. Her mother's hospitalization and death of her brother Bailey's wife drives Rita to her mother's home. She leaves her young son with a caretaker, Big Mary, but when she returns for him, she finds that Big Mary had disappeared with Clyde. She tries to elicit help from Tolbrook, who puts her in her place when she finds him at his home and requests that he help her find her son. She finally realizes that he had been taking advantage of her, but is able to trace Big Mary and Clyde to Bakersfield, California, and has an emotional reunion with her son. She writes, [...] "In the plowed farmyard near Bakersfield, <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> that uniqueness of the person. He was three and I was nineteen, and never again would I think of him as a beautiful appendage of myself".|$|E
60|$|ANA. [horror {{creeping}} upon her] <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand.</b> These are devils, mocking me. I {{had better}} pray.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] said Greythorpe, [...] "now <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand.</b> If <b>I</b> am not indiscreet in {{mentioning}} it, I {{thought my}} old friend was rather in disgrace with you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Are you not a thief?" [...] she asked. [...] "I {{have been}} told that nearly all very rich men are thieves. <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> that it may be so." ...|$|R
500|$|When Madonna {{was five}} years old, in 1963, her mother, Madonna Ciccone, {{died of breast cancer}} at the age of30. Months before this, Madonna noticed changes in her mother's {{behavior}} and personality from the attentive homemaker she was, but did not understand the reasons. Mrs. Ciccone, at a loss to explain her dire medical condition, would often begin to cry when questioned by Madonna, at which point Madonna would respond by wrapping her arms around her mother tenderly. [...] "I remember feeling stronger than she was", Madonna recalled, [...] "I was so little and yet I felt like she was the child." [...] Madonna later acknowledged that she had not grasped the concept of her mother dying. [...] "There was so much left unsaid, so many untangled and unresolved emotions, of remorse, guilt, loss, anger, confusion.... I saw my mother, looking very beautiful and lying as if she were asleep in an open casket. Then I noticed that my mother's mouth looked funny. It took me some time to realize that it had been sewn up. In that awful moment, <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> what I had lost forever. The final image of my mother, at once peaceful yet grotesque, haunts me today also." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "all of {{the forces}} of life and nature became exposed to my view. A {{thousand}} things which hitherto I had accepted in simple faith as facts, were pregnant as new meanings. <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> that the whole earth and sea, and airâ€”all of that of which human beings generally ordinarily take cognizance, is but a film or crust which hides the deeper moving power or forces".|$|E
2500|$|I couldn't {{believe my}} ears. As I went back over {{each step of}} the operation, <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> what must have happened. For years Israeli {{reprisal}} raids had never succeeded in doing more than blowing up a few outlying buildings, if that. Expecting the same, some Arab families must have stayed in their houses rather than running away. In those big stone houses [...] some could easily have hidden in the cellars and back rooms, keeping quiet when the paratroopers went in to check and yell out a warning. The result was this tragedy that had happened.|$|E
6000|$|... "I think <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> it," [...] {{said the}} earl, [...] "and I'll {{give you a}} bit of advice. You come down and spend your Christmas with me at Guestwick." ...|$|R
60|$|What will Stella say <b>to</b> this? Anyhow, <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> her {{interest}} in Penrose now. He {{is one of a}} company of heroes. I am already anxious to hear more of him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Vanborough," [...] she said, [...] "you {{offered to}} take me to my {{carriage}} just now. <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> that <b>I</b> had better have accepted the offer at once. Give me your arm." ...|$|R
60|$|Then indeed <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand.</b> What a {{woman of}} resource! She watched me closely behind the {{feathers}} of her fan.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the position. I ceased my laboured reasoning, {{struggled}} to my feet, and, standing over him, laid {{my hand on}} his shoulder.|$|E
60|$|Pleasant, was it not? It was not. <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> what a shipwrecked sailor {{must feel}} {{when he finds}} there's {{something}} gone wrong with the life belt.|$|E
6000|$|... "It isn't {{right for}} any one to 'serve' as weird a ball as you do," [...] she protested. [...] "It's like playing with loaded dice. <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> why you were not renowned as a scholar." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't at first, but I do now. <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> her, and, besides, I feel {{in myself}} {{certain things that}} are in her, though I think I am more like the Wetherfords. My father's family home was in Maryland." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The wrappered life-discipline! One {{comes to}} that at last. <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> Jane Austen and chintz covers and decency and {{refinement}} {{and all the rest}} of it. One puts gloves on one's greedy fingers. One learns to sit up...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed!" [...] said I. And {{from that}} moment <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> Pepton's hopes {{in regard to the}} {{grandmother}} of those children who should point to the eagle.|$|E
60|$|I was stunned. <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> how {{a general}} must feel {{when he has}} ordered a {{regiment}} to charge and has been told that it isn't in the mood.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the {{influences}} {{that had gone}} towards the making--or marring--of Barbara's character. I had never guessed he had cared for anything beyond money {{and the making of}} money.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he commented, [...] "in {{that case}} I guess it's quite a pity we didn't, but <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the thing. This {{is the young}} lady who told us the trail. She must have taken a shorter way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand!</b> This is why {{you wanted}} to learn to manage a canoe and train {{yourself}} to walking through the bush. But it's a ridiculous undertaking. Your father, who found it, could not locate the ore again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, ay, <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand.</b> The girl {{is a good}} girl, my worthy friend; but she is a soldier's {{daughter}} and a sailor's niece, and {{ought not to be}} too tame or too tender in a gale. Does she show any fear?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And did it?" [...] I asked eagerly, for now <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> that by bearing himself {{friendly}} toward Horry Sims, Pierre {{had succeeded}} where otherwise the chances were {{he must have}} failed.|$|E
60|$|I {{ignored the}} reproach in her eyes, as I {{had every right}} to do. But <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the reason of her {{nervousness}} and her best clothes, and I prayed for Grooton's return.|$|E
6000|$|While Peterkin ran on in {{this style}} my faculties became quite clear again, and <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> my position. [...] "What {{do you mean by}} saying I half-choked you, Peterkin?" [...] said I.|$|E
6000|$|... "You poor thing. <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand.</b> <b>I</b> {{will help}} you, {{and so will}} my brother. He is already {{interested}} in you. He is just the one to advise with you. If any one can help you he can. He is so keen-eyed, so strong." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I believe <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> you, now, Tuscarora, and am glad I have a {{chief and}} a warrior in my house, {{instead of a}} poor miserable outcast. Shall I have the {{pleasure}} of filling you a glass in honour of our old campaigns?" ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{protested that}} he was mistaken. [...] "It {{is the only way}} to get close to these wild people. <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> them as <b>I</b> sit here beside this fire. What do you suppose Two Horns is {{thinking}} about as he sits over there smoking?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> Mr. Aaron Woodward's true character. Like Duncan, he was {{not only}} a bully, but also a brute. Words having failed, he was now evidently going to see what {{physical}} force could accomplish.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the Man from Solano, {{and said}} it was. He {{returned}} his watch to his pocket, toyed playfully with the chain, and remarked, [...] "Kinder makes a man look fash'nable and wealthy, don't it?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> him--I saw the end towards {{which his}} {{extraordinary}} disclosure was now tending. He waited a moment, watching me earnestly--watching till he had evidently guessed what was passing {{in my mind}} before he resumed.|$|E
6000|$|... "And he's big! So {{big that}} he makes other men look small! I was {{disturbed}} when I saw him, bruised and muddy, that day at the marsh; but <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>I</b> was ridiculous. He fought the smith because he was accountable for his men." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How much I may care I {{shall not}} trouble myself {{to explain to}} you. I {{certainly}} shall not endeavour to serve her after that fashion. <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> why you have come, and can only beg {{you to believe that}} you have come in vain." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's because I was cornered that time. It wasn't as before. It was worse, ever so much. I wished I {{could die}} of my fright--and yet it's only now that <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> what a horror {{it might have}} been. Yes, only now, since we--" ...|$|R
