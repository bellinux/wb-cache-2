I {{try to take}} {{characters}} that I think are challenging and a little complicated and hopefully really smart and thoughtful and compassionate. I think Michael is all those things. He {{seems to have a}} lot of bad luck." [...] He defends Michael's behavior in season two, saying [...] " [...] keeps stepping into more trouble than he actually asked for". Cynthia Littleton of Variety described Michael as [...] "one of the most interesting of the Oceanic 815-ers: flawed, tortured, hard to read, volatile, fighting his innate talents, his own worst enemy, at times, and at others, a totally stand-up guy." [...] IGN's Chris Carabott calls Michael a [...] "natural" [...] father. Michael is known for frequently shouting [...] "Walt!", [...] "Where's my son!" [...] and [...] "Have you seen my boy?".|$|E
500|$|Eminem {{responded to}} Cannon's {{comments}} sarcastically, clarifying that {{the song was}} really [...] "wishing the couple the best", {{and that it was}} a misunderstanding. In an interview with BBC Radio, Eminem clarified that although contained a [...] "harsh" [...] line, he meant well: [...] "There's a line on there that was a little harsh. It's a harsh line. But it's like this, the way I look at it, I had no idea he was gonna take it like he took it. I had no idea Nick Cannon was gonna start wildin' out on me. No pun intended." [...] He later commented that he respected Cannon for his comment, and that he expected him to stand up for his wife: [...] "I didn't read his blog or anything. But it is what it is. He's supposed to defend his wife, and <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> do that. But {{at the end of the}} day, it's a line I said – it's a song. What I actually meant to say is, I wish them the best. That's what I meant to say. That's the whole message of the record." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{decision}} {{proved to}} be controversial. The following week, the Greens, who had polled 11.5% of the vote at the 1995 election, had suggested they may not preference Mooney due to his pro-development stance and previous clashes with the environmental movement, especially over the Nelly Bay resort development on Magnetic Island, and Davies, who was directing all calls to the Sydney promoter Harry M. Miller, {{announced that he had}} a story that would [...] "rock the Goss Government" [...] when it was told. On 21 December, Davies hit out directly at Goss, accusing him of breaking a promise made to him before he entered politics, saying, [...] "It was a package he was offering me. He made a commitment to me and <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> abide by that commitment." [...] He asserted the claims he would be bankrupted by the legal case were [...] "uninformed", and that the case was public knowledge before he was appointed to the Ministry. He announced on 9 January 1996 that he would run as an independent, and told the media he had been discussing with Liz Cunningham about [...] "how two independents could work together {{for the benefit of the}} people of Queensland".|$|E

5000|$|The {{official}} reporter, Andrew Brock, {{said about}} the incidents (in a letter to Albert Gyldensparre): [...] "May God in heaven aid him (Heins) oto carry on his government better than his predecessors, which <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> do, as he has shown himself only as an honest and upright man." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It is mere {{waste of}} time," [...] I continued, [...] "to regret the {{excellent}} education which your daughter has misused." [...] Making that reply, I {{was tempted to}} add another word of truth. All education is {{at the mercy of}} two powerful counter-influences: the influence of temperament, and the influence of circumstances. But this was philosophy. How could <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> submit to philosophy? [...] "What we know of Miss Helena," [...] I went on, [...] "must be enough for us.

5000|$|After Tyson's {{controversial}} {{fight with}} Evander Holyfield on June 28, 1997 which saw Tyson get disqualified {{in the third}} round after twice biting Holyfield's ears, the Nevada Athletic Commission fined Tyson $3 million and revoked his boxing license. Tyson's ban would ultimately last a total of 15 months and 10 days with it finally ending after a five-man committee voted in favor of reinstating Tyson by a vote of 4-1 on October 18, 1998. After much speculation over who Tyson would face in his return bout, it was officially announced that Tyson would face former IBF Heavyweight champion Francois Botha on January 16, 1999. Despite his long layoff, Tyson was forthright about his chances of collecting a victory over Botha by way of knockout. On one occasion, Tyson stated [...] "I am going right at <b>him</b> and <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> go down cold. <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> die." [...] The comment would cause some controversy, with some in the boxing world claiming that Tyson had gone too far. Botha also was confident that he could defeat Tyson, claiming that he would earn the victory by way of [...] "seventh round knockout".|$|R

6000|$|... 'His first {{proceeding}} {{was to ask}} me {{the number}} and names of my hunters.

5000|$|Townsend was quoted: [...] "Finn {{deserved}} {{to be in the}} Lions conversation before the games against Racing but he’s playing with lots of confidence and parts of his game have got really strong {{over the last couple of}} years.
