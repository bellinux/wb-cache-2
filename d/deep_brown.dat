5|$|Elemental iodine is {{slightly}} soluble in water, with one gram dissolving in 3450ml at 20°C and 1280ml at 50°C; potassium iodide may {{be added to}} increase solubility via formation of triiodide ions, among other polyiodides. Nonpolar solvents such as hexane and carbon tetrachloride provide a higher solubility. Polar solutions, such as aqueous solutions, are brown, reflecting the role of these solvents as Lewis bases; on the other hand, nonpolar solutions are violet, the color of iodine vapour. Charge-transfer complexes form when iodine is dissolved in polar solvents, hence changing the colour. Iodine is violet when dissolved in carbon tetrachloride and saturated hydrocarbons but <b>deep</b> <b>brown</b> in alcohols and amines, solvents that form charge-transfer adducts.|$|E
5|$|The overall {{colouration}} of Caloboletus calopus, {{with its}} pale cap, yellow pores and red stipe, is not shared {{with any other}} bolete. Large pale specimens resemble Suillellus luridus, and the cap of Rubroboletus satanas is a similar colour but this species has red pores. Fruit bodies in poor condition could be confused with Xerocomellus chrysenteron but the stipes of this species are not reticulated. Edible species such as B.edulis lack a red stipe. It closely resembles the similarly inedible C.radicans, which lacks the redness on the stipe. Like C.calopus, the western North American species C.rubripes also has a bitter taste, similarly coloured cap, and yellowish pores that bruise blue, but it lacks reticulation on its reddish stipe. Found in northwestern North America, B.coniferarum lacks reddish or pinkish colouration in its yellow reticulate stipe, and has a darker, olive-grey to <b>deep</b> <b>brown</b> cap.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{most other}} marine mammals, the sea otter has no blubber and relies on its {{exceptionally}} thick fur to keep warm. With up to 150,000 {{strands of hair}} per square centimeter (nearly one million per sqin), its fur is the densest of any animal. The fur consists of long, waterproof guard hairs and short underfur; the guard hairs keep the dense underfur layer dry. Cold water is kept completely away from the skin and heat loss is limited. The fur is thick year-round, as it is shed and replaced gradually {{rather than in a}} distinct molting season. As the ability of the guard hairs to repel water depends on utmost cleanliness, the sea otter has the ability to reach and groom the fur on any part of its body, taking advantage of its loose skin and an unusually supple skeleton. The coloration of the pelage is usually <b>deep</b> <b>brown</b> with silver-gray speckles, but it can range from yellowish or grayish brown to almost black. In adults, the head, throat, and chest are lighter in color {{than the rest of the}} body.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 110 mm. It {{is similar to}} Ambulyx substrigilis but the submarginal line of the forewing upperside is running closer to the margin. Females are <b>deeper</b> <b>brown</b> than males.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 56-70 mm. It is {{very similar}} in color to Hippotion boerhaviae, but the upperside {{of the body and}} forewings is <b>deeper</b> <b>brown.</b> The hindwing upperside has an orange-pink tornal patch.|$|R
5|$|P. m. saturatus, {{described}} by Leonhard Hess Stejneger in 1885, breeds in Sakhalin, the Kuril Islands, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. It is <b>deeper</b> <b>brown</b> than the nominate subspecies {{and has a}} larger bill.|$|R
5|$|The three {{subspecies}} {{also differ}} in their colour. A. m. angolensis has a brown to tawny coat, with thick, dark brown stripes on the face extending two-thirds down to the snout. While the lateral stripe is nearly black, the stripe on the rump is dark brown. The medium brown forehead patch extends to eye level and is separated from the bright white face by a dark brown border. A brown spot is seen on the nose. A. m. hofmeyri is a light fawn, with thin, dark brown face stripes. The stripes on the flanks are dark brown to black, and the posterior stripes are moderately brown. The forehead patch, dark brown or fawn, extends beyond {{the level of the}} eyes and mixes with the white of the face without any clear barriers. The nose may have a pale smudge. A. m. marsupialis is a rich chestnut brown, with thin, light face stripes. The stripe near the rump is well-marked, and that on the flanks is <b>deep</b> <b>brown.</b> The forehead is brown, fawn, or white, the patch not extending beyond the eyes and having no sharp boundaries. The nose is white or marked with brown.|$|E

25|$|The {{immature}} plumage {{is reminiscent}} of that of the great black hawk (Buteogallus urubitinga). Its upperparts are <b>deep</b> <b>brown,</b> sometimes almost black, and it has no light wing patch. The underside is white or light buff with heavy dark streaks on the breast and dark bars on the belly and thighs. It does not acquire the full adult plumage until 4–5 years old.|$|E

5000|$|The Chorley cake is {{significantly}} less sweet than its Eccles cousin, and is commonly eaten {{with a light}} spread of butter on top, and sometimes a slice of Lancashire cheese on the side. A Chorley cake is made using currants, sandwiched between two layers of unsweetened shortcrust pastry, whereas an Eccles Cake uses flaky puff pastry, which after baking is normally a <b>deeper</b> <b>brown</b> in colour.|$|R

"While {{listening}} to the murmuring leaves he stood, More than a mile immersed within the wood, At once the wind was laid; the whispering sound Was dumb; a rising earthquake rocked the ground; With <b>deeper</b> <b>brown</b> the grove was overspread, A sudden horror seized his giddy head, And his ears tingled, and his colour fled, Nature was in alarm; some danger nigh Seemed threatened, though unseen to mortal eye." ...|$|R
25|$|A Mongolian spot, {{also known}} as Mongolian blue spot, {{congenital}} dermal melanocytosis, and dermal melanocytosis is a benign, flat, congenital birthmark with wavy borders and irregular shape. In 1883 it was described and named after Mongolians by Erwin Bälz, a German anthropologist based in Japan. It normally disappears {{three to five years}} after birth and almost always by puberty. The most common color is blue, although they can be blue-gray, blue-black or <b>deep</b> <b>brown.</b>|$|E
500|$|The darkening of {{the colour}} {{relies on the}} ammonia {{reacting}} with tannins in the wood. [...] The process is most usually applied to white oak as this wood has a high tannin content. [...] Red oak may turn greenish rather than <b>deep</b> <b>brown.</b> [...] Other species may not darken so noticeably as white oak, or at all, depending on the tannin content. [...] The effect of fuming can be enhanced in non-tannic woods by applying a coat of tannic acid to the surface before fuming.|$|E
500|$|Black walnut (Juglans nigra) {{is used by}} Cherokee {{artists to}} produce a <b>deep</b> <b>brown</b> {{approaching}} black. Today black walnut is primarily used to dye baskets but {{has been used in}} the past for fabrics and deerhide. Juniper, Juniperus monosperma, ashes provide brown and yellow dyes for Navajo people, as do the hulls of wild walnuts (Juglans major). [...] Khaki, which translates a Hindustani word signifying [...] "soil-coloured", was introduced into British uniforms in India, which were dyed locally with a dye prepared from the native mazari palm Nannorrhops.|$|E

500|$|Aside {{from the}} vibrissae, the walrus is sparsely covered with fur and appears bald. Its skin is highly {{wrinkled}} and thick, up to [...] {{around the neck}} and shoulders of males. The blubber layer beneath is up to [...] thick. Young walruses are <b>deep</b> <b>brown</b> and grow paler and more cinnamon-colored as they age. Old males, in particular, become nearly pink. Because skin blood vessels constrict in cold water, the walrus can appear almost white when swimming. As a secondary sexual characteristic, males also acquire significant nodules, called [...] "bosses", particularly around the neck and shoulders.|$|E
500|$|The Virgin Islands dwarf sphaero has a <b>deep</b> <b>brown</b> colour on {{its upper}} side, {{often with a}} speckling of darker scales. On average, it {{measures}} [...] from its snout to its vent, and is nearly {{as small as a}} U.S. dime. At most, it weighs [...] There are several stripes or bars of lighter colouration behind the eyes and {{at the top of the}} neck that help distinguish it. There are no differences in colouration between males and females, although females are slightly larger in size. Its tail will regenerate when broken off. Little is known about its population size or its biology.|$|E
500|$|The fisher's fur {{changes with}} {{the season and}} differs {{slightly}} between sexes. Males have coarser coats than females. In the early winter, the coats are dense and glossy, ranging from [...] on the chest to [...] on the back. The color ranges from <b>deep</b> <b>brown</b> to black, although {{it appears to be}} much blacker in the winter when contrasted with white snow. From the face to the shoulders, fur can be hoary-gold or silver due to tricolored guard hairs. The underside of a fisher is almost completely brown except for randomly placed patches of white or cream-colored fur. In the summer, the fur color is more variable and may lighten considerably. Fishers undergo moulting starting in late summer and finishing by November or December.|$|E

500|$|The cap is <b>deep</b> <b>brown</b> to reddish-brown, later fading to tan with age, and it {{does not}} bruise with handling. The cap surface is smooth, and, {{depending}} on the moisture in the environment, may range from sticky to the touch to slimy. Depending on its maturity, the cap shape may range from spherical to broadly convex. The cap diameter measures , and the cap cuticle can be peeled from the surface. The tubes are yellow, becoming olive-green with age, and they have an attachment to the stipe that ranges from [...] (with most of the tube fused to the stipe) to decurrent (with the tubes broadly attached, but running somewhat {{down the length of the}} stipe). They are typically up to [...] deep, and there are about 1–2 tube mouths (pores) per millimeter. The pores are pale yellow, round, 1–2mm wide, and do not change color when bruised.|$|E
500|$|Typically, {{the species}} has a <b>deep</b> <b>brown</b> {{colouration}} on the dorsal side and legs, {{often with a}} scattering or a fine pattern of interconnected darker scales. The species has a preocular transverse bar (a line of coloured scales {{in front of the}} eyes {{at the base of the}} snout), although this can be hard to see in some individuals. Along each side and directly behind the eyes, a narrow, dark-edged, yellow-brown postocular stripe crosses the temple and fades out near the base of the head. In the occipital region, on top of the head behind the eyes, an almost oval-shaped, dark-edged, yellow-brown bar stretches from one side of the head to the other and sometimes connects with the postocular stripes. The dark brown scales on the dorsal side cross over to the ventral side (underside) and fade out, although many scales retain dark edges. The ventral side is light grey or cream. The tail is mostly yellowish-brown with occasional clusters or short lines of darker scales. The gular (throat) pattern has faint to bold lines of light scales running [...]|$|E
500|$|The cap ranges {{in shape}} from hemispheric to broadly convex, {{and has a}} {{diameter}} of [...] The cap color is <b>deep</b> <b>brown</b> in mature specimens and lighter shades of brown in younger mushrooms. Young specimens have a sticky layer of gluten on the cap that dries out in maturity. The edge of the cap is rolled inwards in young specimens. The flesh of the cap is whitish and does not change color when bruised or cut. The tubes {{on the underside of}} the cap are light yellow to bright orange-yellow; the tube mouths are usually less than 1mm wide. The stipe is usually between [...] long, less frequently reaching up to [...] It is either the same width throughout or slightly larger (bulbous) at the base. The color of the upper portion of the stipe is pale to light yellow, while the lower portion may be light brown or covered with streaks of glutinous material like that on the cap. The stipe surface is covered with fine glands that are initially slightly darker than the color of the stipe surface, but deepen to brown or nearly black after drying. The color of the spore print was not determined from the initial collections, but is thought to be yellow-brown to brown based on the accumulated spore deposit seen on the surface of the caps of neighboring fruit bodies.|$|E
50|$|The {{forewings}} are <b>deep</b> smoky <b>brown</b> with blackish cross lines. The hindwings are pale smoky with a quite prominent, oblique, postmedian line.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 38-43.5 mm. Adults {{from southern}} California have dull greyish tan forewings with a grainy appearance. In central and northern California and Oregon, it is dull <b>deeper</b> <b>brown,</b> sometimes with some reddish tones surrounding the dark-filled reniform and orbicular spots. Most adults {{are much less}} contrasting than Aseptis fumeola and lack its contrasting black-outlined spots, patchy dark shading, and reddish postreniform patch.Adults are on wing in midsummer. Adults are on wing from early May to August.|$|R
50|$|Male {{students}} wear a plain beige-coloured {{shirt with}} beige pants. Female students wear a beige-coloured blouse with beige skirt. The former uniform, which {{was of a}} <b>deeper</b> <b>brown,</b> was completely phased out in 2008. The collar pin, which bears the college insignia, is worn on the left collar of shirt. Dark brown blazers and school ties are worn on special occasions. The attire for PE is a college T-shirt with blue and white shoulder stripes and black shorts which bear the school initials.|$|R
500|$|Fur colour varies greatly {{and changes}} with age. Unlike the fur of the striped and brown hyena, {{that of the}} spotted hyena {{consists}} of spots rather than stripes and is much shorter, lacking the well defined spinal mane of the former two species. The base colour generally is a pale greyish-brown or yellowish-grey on which an irregular pattern of roundish spots is superimposed {{on the back and}} hind quarters. The spots, which are of variable distinction, may be reddish, <b>deep</b> <b>brown</b> or almost blackish. The spots vary in size, even on single individuals, but are commonly [...] in diameter. A less distinct spot pattern is present on the legs and belly but not on the throat and chest. A set of five, pale and barely distinct bands replace the spots on the back and sides of the neck. A broad, medial band is present {{on the back of the}} neck, and is lengthened into a forward facing crest. The crest is mostly reddish-brown in colour. The crown and upper part of the face is brownish, save for a white band above both eyes, though the front of the eyes, the area around the rhinarium, the lips and the back portion of the chin are all blackish. The limbs are spotted, though the feet vary in colour, from light brown to blackish. The fur is relatively sparse and consists of two hair types; moderately fine underfur (measuring [...] ) and long, stout bristle hairs (...) [...] European Paleolithic rock art depicting the species indicates that the Eurasian populations retained the spots of their modern-day African counterparts.|$|E

2500|$|Tourmaline has {{a variety}} of colors. Usually, iron-rich tourmalines are black to bluish-black to <b>deep</b> <b>brown,</b> while magnesium-rich {{varieties}} are brown to yellow, and lithium-rich tourmalines are almost any color: blue, green, red, yellow, pink, etc. [...] Rarely, it is colorless. Bi-colored and multicolored crystals are common, reflecting variations of fluid chemistry during crystallization. Crystals may be green at one end and pink at the other, or green on the outside and pink inside; this type is called watermelon tourmaline. Some forms of tourmaline are dichroic, in that they change color when viewed from different directions.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 13 mm. The forewings are ferruginous-brown {{with a very}} oblique indistinct darker streak from near {{the base of the}} costa to below the fold and a spot of deeper suffusion on the costa at one-third. The plical and first discal stigmata are <b>deeper</b> <b>brown,</b> faintly edged whitish posteriorly, the plical very obliquely anterior, the second discal dark fuscous, finely pale-edged. There are three costal and two terminal whitish dots towards the apex, the apical edge blackish between these. The hindwings are dark fuscous.|$|R
