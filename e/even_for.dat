5|$|Airborne {{volcanic}} ash can reflect the Sun's rays back into space and thereby contribute to cooling the planet. Dips in earth temperatures {{have been observed}} after large volcano eruptions such as Mount Agung in Bali that erupted in 1963, El Chichon (Mexico) 1983, Ruiz (Colombia) 1985, and Pinatubo (Philippines) 1991. But <b>even</b> <b>for</b> major eruptions, the ash clouds remain only for relatively short periods.|$|E

5|$|Crassus' {{defeat at}} Carrhae {{was one of}} the worst {{military}} defeats of Roman history. Parthia's victory cemented its reputation as a formidable if not equal power with Rome. With his camp followers, war captives, and precious Roman booty, Surena traveled some 700km (430mi) back to Seleucia where his victory was celebrated. However, fearing his ambitions <b>even</b> <b>for</b> the Arsacid throne, Orodes had Surena executed shortly thereafter.|$|E

5|$|Meats {{were more}} {{expensive}} than plant foods. Though rich in protein, the calorie-to-weight ratio of meat was {{less than that of}} plant food. Meat could be up to four times as expensive as bread. Fish was up to 16 times as costly, and was expensive <b>even</b> <b>for</b> coastal populations. This meant that fasts could mean an especially meager diet for those who could not afford alternatives to meat and animal products like milk and eggs. It was only after the Black Death had eradicated up to half of the European population that meat became more common <b>even</b> <b>for</b> poorer people. The drastic reduction in many populated areas resulted in a labor shortage, meaning that wages dramatically increased. It also left vast areas of farmland untended, making them available for pasture and putting more meat on the market.|$|E

5|$|There have {{probably}} been many such eruptions during Earth's history beyond those shown in these lists.

5|$|About 260 {{models of}} lorry were produced, which were fitted with 35 types of engine, 20 {{different}} gearboxes, and 15 to 20 types of cabin. Many {{of the models}} were produced in small numbers, with 116 types only being represented by one or two units. Most of the differences came from special wheelbases that always needed approval from the authorities. In many cases, it is impossible <b>even</b> <b>for</b> experts to identify different models and years of production. There were 66 types of bus chassis produced, {{and the number of}} different body types built on them by various coach builders and operators is unknown.|$|E
