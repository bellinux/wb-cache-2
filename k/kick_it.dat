5|$|Carlisle is an {{ambassador}} for the <b>Kick</b> <b>It</b> Out scheme, which campaigns for inclusion and equality in football. He is also {{currently on the}} Management Committee of the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA), and it was announced on 17 November 2010 that Carlisle would succeed Chris Powell {{as the chairman of}} the PFA. As part of his work with the PFA, he collects the views of his fellow professionals and reports back to the committee. He also visits local schools to give talks to the students. Carlisle was among those who criticised FIFA president Sepp Blatter following his comments in November 2011 that racism was no longer a problem in football. In February 2012, he was part of a PFA delegation that met with British Prime Minister David Cameron to discuss the issues of racism and homophobia in the sport.|$|E
5|$|The {{three types}} of {{scrimmage}} kicks are place kicks, drop kicks, and punts. Only place kicks and drop kicks can score points. The place kick is the standard method used to score points, because the pointy shape of the football {{makes it difficult to}} reliably drop kick. Once the ball has been kicked from a scrimmage <b>kick,</b> <b>it</b> can be advanced by the kicking team only if it is caught or recovered behind the line of scrimmage. If it is touched or recovered by the kicking team beyond this line, it becomes dead at the spot where it was touched. The kicking team is prohibited from interfering with the receiver's opportunity to catch the ball, and the receiving team has the option of signaling for a fair catch. This prohibits the defense from blocking into or tackling the receiver, but the play ends as soon as the ball is caught and the ball may not be advanced.|$|E
50|$|One {{point is}} scored at a time. Points are scored {{when the ball}} passes through a goal by running it, {{throwing}} <b>it,</b> or <b>kicking</b> <b>it.</b> If the ball is thrown or <b>kicked</b> <b>it</b> must pass between the goal markers and be received by the team trying to score.|$|R
2500|$|Another {{contemporary}} match report {{clearly shows}} that by 1870, ball passing was {{a feature of the}} Engineers style: [...] "Lieut. Creswell, who having brought it up the side then <b>kicked</b> <b>it</b> into the middle to another of his side, who <b>kicked</b> <b>it</b> through the posts the minute before time was called" ...|$|R

5|$|The Kansas City Chiefs {{credited}} {{their defense}} with the win after holding the Buccaneers to 14 yards rushing. The Buccaneers managed only 2 first downs and 34 yards of total offense before exploding for three {{touchdowns in the}} final ten minutes. The Buccaneers were mistake-prone and ineffective throughout the first three quarters. Ken Stone was penalized for roughing on a missed field goal in the first quarter, {{with the result that}} the Chiefs got a second chance to <b>kick</b> <b>it.</b> The special teams allowed Henry Marshall to return a punt 59 yards, setting up the Chiefs’ second touchdown. They got 14 first downs and 162 yards in the final 15 minutes, scoring on an Essex Johnson run and passes from Steve Spurrier to Johnny McKay and Jack Novak. Coach McKay felt that the difference was that the team did not begin giving effort until the fourth quarter. McKay also felt that the Chiefs left themselves vulnerable by trying to run up the score. Bert Cooper, filling in at linebacker for an injured Steve Reese, was consistently exploited in the passing game. McKay later threatened to fire players who he felt were giving a slack effort, specifically referring to a Chiefs kickoff that rolled {{all the way to the}} 4-yard line, with no Buccaneers trying to recover it. Spectators booed the team, and one threw a dead bird at Spurrier as he returned to the locker room after the game. Buccaneer defenders found some consolation in having held the AFC’s top offensive team to only 13 points. Defensive end Council Rudolph played, despite the death of his father the previous evening.|$|E

5000|$|They may opt {{to play a}} tap kick. A tap kick {{is played}} when the team feel they would benefit more from keeping {{possession}} of the ball rather than <b>kicking</b> <b>it</b> downfield. To play a tap kick, the player either places {{the ball on the}} ground and <b>kicks</b> <b>it</b> a small distance, or punts it back into his own hands. The ball must travel a visible distance.|$|R
25|$|Chicago's first {{touchdown}} {{resulted on}} a New York punt attempt {{from their own}} 12, forcing Sean Landeta to make the kick three yards into his goal line. As Landeta dropped the ball to <b>kick</b> <b>it,</b> the wind altered the ball's descent and caused it to go {{off the side of}} his foot. As a result, the ball went right into the ground and bounced a short distance before reserve safety Shaun Gayle picked it up and returned the -7 yard punt five yards for a touchdown. Gayle's run was the shortest punt return touchdown in NFL history.|$|E
25|$|Pop's 2003 album Skull Ring {{featured}} collaborators Sum 41, Green Day, Peaches, and The Trolls, {{as well as}} Ron and Scott Asheton, reuniting {{the three}} surviving founding members of the Stooges {{for the first time}} since 1974. Pop made a guest appearance on Peaches's song <b>Kick</b> <b>It</b> as well as the video. Also in 2003, his first full-length biography was published. Gimme Danger – The Story of Iggy Pop was written by Joe Ambrose; Pop did not collaborate on the biography or publicly endorse it. Having enjoyed working with the Ashetons on Skull Ring, Pop reformed the Stooges with bassist Mike Watt (formerly of the Minutemen) filling in for the late Dave Alexander, and Fun House saxophonist Steve Mackay rejoining the lineup. They have toured regularly since 2004. That year, Pop opened Madonna's Reinvention World Tour in Dublin.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} {{international}} game, Scotland against England on 30 November 1872, England played with seven or eight forwards in a 1–1–8 or 1–2–7 formation, and Scotland with six, in a 2–2–6 formation. For England, one player would remain in defence, picking up loose balls, {{and one or two}} players would hang around midfield and kick the ball upfield for the other players to chase. The English style of play at the time was all about individual excellence and English players were renowned for their dribbling skills. Players would attempt to take the ball forward as far as possible and only when they could proceed no further, would they <b>kick</b> <b>it</b> ahead for someone else to chase. Scotland surprised England by actually passing the ball among players. The Scottish outfield players were organised into pairs and each player would always attempt to pass the ball to his assigned partner. Ironically, with so much attention given to attacking play, the game ended in a 0–0 draw.|$|E

25|$|In 1989, Manchester-based Nigel Martin-Smith {{sought to}} create a British male vocal singing group {{modelled}} on New Kids on the Block. Martin-Smith's vision, however, was a teen-orientated group that would appeal {{to more than one}} demographic segment of the music industry. Martin-Smith was introduced to young singer-songwriter Gary Barlow, who had been performing in clubs since the age of 15. Impressed with Barlow's catalogue of self-written material, Martin-Smith decided to build his new-look boy band around Barlow's musical abilities. A campaign to audition young men with abilities in dancing and singing followed and took place in Manchester and other surrounding cities in 1990. At 22, Howard Donald was one of the oldest to audition, but he was chosen after he got time off work as a vehicle painter to continue the process. Prior to auditioning, Jason Orange had appeared as a breakdancer on the popular television programme The Hit Man and Her. Martin-Smith also selected 18-year-old bank employee Mark Owen and finally 16-year-old Robbie Williams to round out the group, which initially went by the name <b>Kick</b> <b>It.</b>|$|E
25|$|When {{the ball}} crosses the {{sideline}} during general play a line-out is formed {{with the team}} that did not put the ball into touch throwing it in, unless it was kicked into touch from a penalty kick, {{in which case the}} team kicking to touch throws in. If the ball is kicked directly (does not bounce first) over the sideline by a team member who is outside his 22-metre line, the line-out is formed on the sideline perpendicular to where that player kicked it. The same rule applies if the ball is moved (passed, knocked, kicked or run) back inside the 22 by a player from the same team as the kicker. Once a tackle, scrum, line-out, ruck or maul occurs inside the 22 or the ball is moved there by the opposition a player can <b>kick</b> <b>it</b> directly into touch with the line-out forming where the ball crossed the sideline. If the ball bounces before crossing the sideline or is carried across by a player the line-out is formed where the ball crossed the line. However, a line-out can never take place within five metres of the ingoal area, and is always moved back to a mark five metres out.|$|E

500|$|Roguelikes {{generally}} have complex interacting systems {{that allow the}} player to complete certain goals in multiple ways, creating emergent gameplay. For example, {{to get through a}} locked door, the player may attempt to pick the lock, <b>kick</b> <b>it</b> down, burn down the door, or even tunnel around it, depending on their current situation and inventory. A common phrase associated with NetHack is [...] "The Dev Team Thinks of Everything" [...] in that the developers seem to have anticipated every possible combination of actions that a player may attempt to try in their gameplay strategy, such as using gloves to protect one's character while wielding the corpse of a cockatrice as a weapon to petrify enemies by its touch.|$|E

5000|$|As for modal logic, the {{inference}} rules modus ponens and necessitation suffice also for dynamic logic {{as the only}} primitive rules it needs, as noted above. However, as usual in logic, many more rules {{can be derived from}} these {{with the help of the}} axioms. An example instance of such a derived rule in dynamic logic is that if kicking a broken TV once can't possibly fix <b>it,</b> then repeatedly <b>kicking</b> <b>it</b> can't possibly fix it either. Writing [...] for the action of kicking the TV, and [...] for the proposition that the TV is broken, dynamic logic expresses this inference as , having as premise [...] and as conclusion [...] The meaning of [...] is that it is guaranteed that after <b>kicking</b> the TV, <b>it</b> is broken. Hence the premise [...] means that if the TV is broken, then after <b>kicking</b> <b>it</b> once it will still be broken. [...] denotes the action of kicking the TV zero or more times. Hence the conclusion [...] means that if the TV is broken, then after <b>kicking</b> <b>it</b> zero or more times it will still be broken. For if not, then after the second-to-last kick the TV would be in a state where <b>kicking</b> <b>it</b> once more would fix it, which the premise claims can never happen under any circumstances.|$|R

[...] He stated that his method of composing a new song might involve [...] "whistling, playing around with the notes, or at a club.

[...] Naohisa Morota handled the sound programming, and Kageyama described his contributions as [...] "profound" [...] and helpful in one of his goals in making the tracks sound more like a live performance than just compositions. The Famicom version uses a variation of Sunsoft's FME-7 memory management controller known as [...] "SUNSOFT 5B", which, in addition to the functionality provided by the stock FME-7, features a Yamaha YM2149 PSG audio chip to provide three additional channels for music and sound.
