Captain Gregorie came up with him, stopped, and took the wounded man up behind him.

She guessed too surely what it was, but said not a word, while her husband leaped his horse through a gap in the garden wall in order to reach the road by a short cut. <b>Double-weighted</b> thus, the horse did not run so well as before. Considine was frequently obliged to check his pace and look back.|$|E

50|$|A {{mechanical}} metronome uses {{an adjustable}} {{weight on the}} end of an inverted pendulum rod to control tempo. The weight slides up the pendulum rod to decrease tempo, or down to increase tempo. (This mechanism is also called a <b>double-weighted</b> pendulum, because there is a second, fixed weight {{on the other side of}} the pendulum pivot, inside the metronome case.) The pendulum swings back and forth in tempo, while a mechanism inside the metronome produces a clicking sound with each oscillation. Mechanical metronomes don't need a battery, but run from a spring-wound clock escapement.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} extensions, to weighted and <b>double-weighted</b> digraphs, of the author's {{earlier work}} on building and analyzing energy-demand signed digraphs. Several weighted and <b>double-weighted</b> digraphs are built {{to provide a}} test of the construction methodology, to provide {{a test of the}} methods of analysis of such digraphs, and to illustrate the type of analysis one can make using such digraphs as models of complex systems. The digraphs are constructed {{within the context of the}} transportation system of a hypothetical metropolitan area, similar to the County of San Diego, California. The digraphs are used to compare fuel consumption and air pollution under two scenarios: the nominal case, where clean air standards are met by some retrofitting of cars with smog control devices; and the bus case, where cars are banned and an expensive wide-ranging bus system is introduced. It is concluded that weighted and <b>double-weighted</b> digraphs can be constructed relatively inexpensively and that at least weighted, and probably <b>double-weighted,</b> digraphs can be used at an early stage of a policy-making task to set directions for further research. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{continuous}} {{family of}} excess Gibbs free energy expressions is derived {{based on the}} <b>double-weighted</b> power mean mixture model and concepts from cubic equations of state. This family has two types of parameters: The model form is determined by two power indices, whereas the matrix of binary coefficients characterizes pure component behavior and binary interactions. It is shown that the Porter, Margules, and Wassiljewa composition dependence are but special forms of this more general expression. In particular, the Wassiljewa Gibbs free energy form {{turns out to have}} the same composition dependence as the nonrandom two-liquid (NRTL) equation.

40|$|The {{normalization}} of high-throughput sequencing data from different sequencing conditions {{is a critical}} step of the entire high-throughput data analysis and processing. Normalization {{is important for the}} identification of gene structures and differentially expressed genes, which has great impact on the accuracy and reliability of downstream analysis procedures. Here, we propose a <b>double-weighted</b> normalization method for high-throughput sequencing data generated by RNA-seq, and present a p-value weighted method to detect differential expression from normalized data. This normalization method not only considers the overall expression level of all genes in a library, but also considers the impact of each individual gene. Experimental results show that our method can effectively normalize high-throughput data under different conditions to provide highly confident data for the downstream analysis of differential expression.

40|$|To date {{empirical}} {{studies of the}} economic effects of changes in state corporate income tax apportionment policies have used only highly aggregated, state-level data.  This study uses data at the individual firm level, which is provided by a population of corporate income tax returns from the State of Georgia over the period 1992 – 2002, to evaluate the economic development and revenue aspects of increasing the sales factor weight (and uniformly lowering the weights on payroll and property) in state corporate income tax apportionment formulas.   Looking at the firm level, we find elasticities sufficiently large to lead to substantial impact on local sales (- 6. 5 percent), payroll (2. 0 percent) and property (2. 1 percent) following a move to <b>double-weighted</b> sales.   For the average firm, increases in Georgia payroll and property were $ 37, 110 and $ 190, 829, respectively, while the decrease in Georgia sales for the average firm was $ 634, 367.   Based on 1994 figures (the year prior to double-weighting), this amounts to state-wide increases in payroll and property of $ 0. 6 billion and $ 3. 1 billion, respectively, {{and a decrease in}} gross receipts of approximately $ 10. 4 billion.

40|$|AbstractEnglish {{physical}} activity guidance now recognises a double weighting of vigorous over moderate activity; 1 min of vigorous activity {{is the same}} as two ‘equivalent’ minutes of moderate activity. In addition, concerns of over-estimation of occupational PA led to newly applied measurement methods for this domain. Vigorous activity is associated with higher socio-economic position and occupational PA has the opposite association, so these changes may increase inequalities. We profiled adults' total and domain-specific ‘equivalent minutes’ of weekly PA in England 2012, and investigated inequalities in PA participation, accounting for the new weighting of vigorous PA, and new measurements of occupational PA. Nationally representative cross-sectional survey data on the self-reported PA of 8158 adults was used to produce a profile of the domain and duration of weekly ‘equivalent minutes’ of PA. Vigorous PA was <b>double-weighted</b> compared to moderate PA, and the percentage contribution from each PA domain quantified, stratified by gender and activity status and split by socio-demographic variables. Women, older adults, and adults without qualifications, from deprived areas, with worse employment conditions, or living in the North of England were significantly less likely to meet MVPA guidance. Type of activity was also socially patterned, particularly sport participation, which contributed a higher percentage of PA in adults of higher socioeconomic status. For active men, sporting activity was the most prevalent domain, and sports and walking for active women. In England, there are important socio-demographic differences in how adults participate in PA, and in percentage meeting public health guidance...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. P. P. A., Public Policy and Administration) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2013. In an {{environment}} of high unemployment and deep budget deficits for the state, California passed the Clean Jobs Act ??? also known as Proposition 39 ??? in November 2012. Proposition 39 changed the corporate tax structure for multi-state businesses from a choice between a <b>double-weighted</b> sales formula and a single-sales formula to just a single-sales formula. The change in tax structure is projected to generate 1. 1 billion annually in tax revenue for California. Proposition 39 dedicates half the revenue {{for the first five}} years to the creation of clean energy jobs in California. This paper examined four funding alternatives for how the state could spend the money to meet the policy goals of Proposition 39. In this thesis, I examined four allocation proposals, which are Governor Jerry Brown???s, Senate Bill 39, Assembly Bill 39, and Assembly Bill 239. Schools are the primary recipient in all four proposals. I analyzed each of these proposals using a qualitative criteria alternative matrix. The criteria in the analysis were Job Creation, Energy Demand Reduction, Administration, and Equity. The analysis criteria were weighted equally. Assembly Bill 39 was the best scoring alternative for how to allocate Proposition 39 revenue. Assembly Bill 39 allocates money to projects at K- 12 schools {{based on the number of}} jobs created and the amount of energy demand reduction, which most closely matches the policy goals of Proposition 39. Ultimately, the responsibility of government is to the people of California, and Assembly Bill 39 creates the most public value for all Californians. Public Policy and Administratio...|$|E
40|$|The primary {{objectives}} of the study are to present a comprehensive summary of the historical, legal, and political aspects of state corporate taxation and to conduct an empirical analysis of formulary apportionment. The empirical section of the study addresses the issue of apportionment formula fairness. Five research questions are investigated [...] {{using a variety of}} multiple regression and descriptive statistics techniques [...] by observing the reported values of income, receipts, property, and payroll for 252 large corporations, operating in widely diverse industries, for the period 1977 through 1981. The study reports the following results: (1) The standard UDITPA factors of property, payroll, and receipts, taken as a set, significantly reflect income-generating processes. The explanatory power of each individual factor is highly significant, but the multicollinearity among the factors results in considerable redundancy when the factors are viewed simultaneously. (2) These factors are very stable over time. (3) The relative importance of these factors is disparate. An optimal weighting of the factors, based on the multiple regression results, would assign approximately equal weight to the property and receipts factors and a negative weighting to the payroll factor. (4) The factors, although stable over time, are not stable across industries. The income functions of different industries vary considerably, both in terms of factor dependency and factor weighting. (5) Of the eleven practical alternative apportionment formulas tested, the most appropriate, in terms of the least degree of misapportionment, varied from industry to industry. (6) Three-factor apportionment formulas generally outperformed single-factor and two-factor formulas. (7) Apportionment formulas which <b>double-weighted</b> the receipts factor consistently resulted in a higher degree of misapportionment than those formulas which equally weighted this factor. (8) Formulas which measured the property factor as undepreciated historical cost consistently outperformed those formulas which measured this factor in terms of depreciated value. (9) Formulas which measured the payroll factor in number of employees consistently outperformed alternate formulas which measured this factor in dollars of compensation. ...|$|E
