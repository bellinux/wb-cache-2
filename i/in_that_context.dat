He preached to his monks {{that the way to}} God's grace was through a life of simplicity, asceticism, sanctity, and contemplation, which was also the doctrine of the hermits and monks known as the Desert Fathers. In addition, Symeon placed great emphasis on putting oneself under the complete guidance of a spiritual father.|$|E

In this paper we introduce and study a new family of test statistics for composite likelihood: Composite ϕ-divergence test statistics for solving the problem of testing a simple null hypothesis or a composite null hypothesis. To do that we introduce and study the asymptotic distribution of the restricted maximum composite likelihood estimate...|$|R

Consequently, the theorem is directly applicable to time-dependent signals and is normally formulated <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>context.</b> However, the sampling theorem can be extended in a straightforward way to functions of arbitrarily many variables. Grayscale images, for example, are often represented as two-dimensional arrays (or matrices) of real numbers representing the relative intensities of pixels (picture elements) located at the intersections of row and column sample locations. As a result, images require two independent variables, or indices, to specify each pixel uniquely—one for the row, {{and one for the}} column.|$|E
