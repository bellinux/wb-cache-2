30|$|Still, {{even though}} both {{approaches}} give us different results {{in terms of the}} efficiency of the market and the final distribution of costs that it would generate, they are useful in understanding the difficulties the EU is having in coordinating a response to the Syrian crisis. Both approaches conclude that a majority of countries lose with respect to an uncoordinated solution, at least given the initial <b>distribution</b> of <b>quotas</b> that has been proposed by the European Union. There are very few countries, mostly Germany and Sweden, that would actually benefit from a coordinated solution even if this was globally efficient as in our simulation presented in Table  2. This suggests that the initial <b>distribution</b> of <b>quotas</b> would need to be adjusted {{to make sure that all}} the Member States, or at least a majority of them, benefit from the coordinated policy.

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} burden-sharing of {{a common}} 'ceiling' for total emissions of CO 2 {{for a group of}} countries. The <b>distribution</b> of <b>quotas</b> is assumed {{to be based on the}} anticipated emissions in each country after a uniform carbon tax is imposed. A 'fair' burden can be defined as the resulting reduction in NNP. Over time, however, this would lead to an unfair <b>distribution</b> unless the <b>quotas</b> were adjusted or compensated according to the changes in NNP. However, in practice, NNP turns out as rather imperfect measure of welfare. Thus, to achieve a fair sharing of burden over time, a more comprehensive macro-economic analysis of the participating countries would be necessary. A particular attention should then be given to differences in the utilization of natural resources and the openness of the economies. Also other costs and benefits resulting from the measures should be examined. These include the effect on total governmental revenues as a result of the carbon tax...|$|R
30|$|Figure  1 {{shows that}} rules 1 to 4 {{give rise to}} similar <b>distributions</b> of <b>quotas,</b> based mostly on {{economic}} strength and population, which are typically highly correlated. Rules 6 and 7 are a bit different {{as long as they}} are based on actual applications and refugees accepted by the countries. In this sense, they can be seen as having an inertia component, which can alternatively be interpreted as either maintaining the status quo or else as reflecting revealed preferences on the part of Member States.|$|R
30|$|In this case, only {{a quarter}} of the initial <b>distribution</b> of <b>quotas</b> would be traded. The reason is that the {{differences}} in preferences are not as extreme as in Table  1. The difference between the most refugee-friendly country (Sweden) and the less refugee-friendly one (Hungary) is less than 8 to 1, compared to 166 to 1 (Germany vs. the UK) in Table  1. Given that there would be fewer trades, the total cost reduction with respect to the initial EU quotas is smaller than in Table  1, just 27 percent instead of 62 percent.|$|R

40|$|The paper aims to {{investigate}} land conversion {{as a result}} of urban-rural transformation in the Chinese context. Theoretical analysis and empirical study of the Bohai Rim region find strong connections between the land conversion rates and urban-rural transformation intensity in the period 2000 - 2010. Rapid land conversion normally takes place in counties/districts of low initial level of urban-rural transformation. However, places of high initial socioeconomic level and low transformation intensity would experience slow land conversion. The different land conversion rates in relation to urban-rural transformation intensity are mainly attributed to the China's land <b>quotas</b> <b>distribution</b> system which is subjective and administrative. The study highlights the implementation of land <b>quotas</b> <b>distribution</b> system based on differences to improve the land distribution efficiency and achieve balanced regional development in China.

50|$|In 1948 Israel officially {{became a}} state. The Kingdom of Jordan assumed {{control of the}} water {{resources}} of the Judea and Samaria Mountains. They retained control over the region until the Six-Day War in 1967. Additional wells drilled during this period and the maximum water supply in the region reached 66 MCM/Y. Only four of 708 Palestinian towns, however, were connected to the water supply at the time. In 1965 an additional 350 wells were drilled, supplying a total of 41 MCM/Y.In the Israeli War of Independence (1948) the Jewish Army destroyed the Rutenburg electric plant in trying to prevent the exclusive Arab control of both the Jordan and Yarmouk Rivers. As a direct result the Jordanian Government and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency commission the MacDonald Plan, which resembled the Ionides Plan (1939) in limiting {{the waters of the}} Jordan River Basin to the Jordan River Valley. It also called for a diversion of the Yarmouk River for storage in Lake Tiberias to be used to support agricultural developments {{on both sides of the}} Jordan River. Jordan and Syria backed the Bunger Plan, which proposed a dam of the Yarmouk River and the creation of two hydroelectric power plants to supply electricity to Jordan and Syria. In 1953, shortly after construction had started, increased pressure from the U.S. forced Jordan and Syria to abandon their plans. The Eisenhower Administration sent Eric Johnston as a special envoy. The Johnston Plan implemented the policies of a Tennessee Valley Authority study conducted by Chales Main - the Main Plan - that included water <b>distribution</b> <b>quotas</b> of the Jordan River Basin. Although neither side accepted the plan, it has been used as the basis for many subsequent water conflict negotiations.|$|R

40|$|International {{agreements}} {{are necessary to}} achieve significant reductions of emissions of CO 2 and other greenhouse gases. Traditional agreements of the type "uniform percent reductions" have two disadvantages: in the first place, {{it would probably be}} difficult to get a sufficiently large participation in such an agreement, since it gives a distribution of costs of reducing emissions which may differ strongly from the advantages the countries have from avoiding climatic changes. In the second place, agreements of this type are generally not efficient. An international CO 2 tar and tradeable CO 2 quotas are two alternative schemes which have several common features, and which both are (almost) efficient under reasonable conditions.

40|$|Developing {{countries}} are demanding {{a greater role}} in the current round of multilateral trade negotiations than they received in previous rounds. Agriculture remains an important sector for most developing countries and this sector could yet be a stumbling block in the current negotiations. Avoiding an impasse requires an analysis of the potential gains and losses from further trade liberalisation. Since the Uruguay Round, analysis of trade liberalisation has been made more complex by the introduction of the tariff rate quota system of regulating access to agricultural markets. The Agricultural Trade Policy Simulation Model (ATPSM) is a static, multi-commodity, multi-region, partial equilibrium trade model that takes into account the <b>distribution</b> of <b>quota</b> rent and differences in bound and applied tariff rates. The estimated annual static welfare gains from a continuation of Uruguay Round agricultural trade liberalisation are relatively modest, at around US$ 9 billion.

40|$|In Norway the Eurasian beaver Castor fiber {{harvest is}} quota-regulated. Once the annual quota for each {{municipality}} {{has been determined}} it is distributed to landowner-organized beaver management units. Municipal wildlife managers can choose between two distributional models: the traditional “areal model” whereby each management unit receives its portion of the municipal quota based on the relative area of beaver habitat within the township that it contains, or the more recently developed “linear model” based on the relative length of beaver-utilized shoreline it contains. The linear model was developed {{in an attempt to}} increase the precision of the <b>quota</b> <b>distribution</b> process and is {{based on the fact that}} beaver occupy landscapes in a linear fashion along strips of shoreline rather than exploiting extensive areas. The assumption was that the linear model would provide a more precise and just method of distributing the municipal quota among landowners. Here we test the hypothesis that the length of beaverutilized shoreline is a better predictor of beaver colony density than the area of beaver habitat on 13 beaver management units of typical size (794 – 2200 hectares) in Bø Township, Norway, during 2 years. As hypothesized, the number of beaver occupied sites on management units correlated significantly (p≤ 0. 001) with the length of beaver-utilized shoreline, but not with the area of beaver habitat. Therefore municipalities should employ the linear model when a precise <b>distribution</b> of <b>quotas</b> is necessary. The density of Eurasian beaver colonies at the landscape scale (> 100 km 2) in south-central Scandinavia averages approximately 1 occupied site per 4 km 2. This figure can be employed by municipal wildlife managers to estimate the colony density in their townships, and to calculate municipal quotas, when more precise census information is lacking. </span...|$|R
40|$|The current {{allocation}} {{of decision making}} in the International Monetary Fund (IMF), determined largely by the <b>distribution</b> of members' <b>quotas,</b> has failed {{to keep up with}} the changing world economy. The situation undermines the Fund's relevance and legitimacy in promoting global growth and economic and financial stability. A new simplified and transparent formula to guide the <b>distribution</b> of Fund <b>quotas</b> is key to IMF reform. The authors offer four recommendations to advance IMF quota reform: (1) The IMF executive board should complete its work on the new IMF quota formula by the 2007 annual meeting [...] rather than spring 2008 [...] to ensure that the other necessary elements of a reform package can be completed by spring 2008 and ratified by the IMF governors at their annual meeting in fall 2008. (2) The new quota formula should follow the recommendations of the quota formula review group (QFRG), deleting an "openness" measure from the formula. The openness variable has no economic or financial justification, and the traditional measures are biased. (3) The traditional industrial countries should agree to a target of limiting their quota shares to 60 percent of their GDP shares to facilitate the further redistribution of quota shares toward the nonindustrial countries. (4) A reasonable benchmark would be an increase in the size of the Fund (total quotas) by at least 50 percent to implement the redistribution of quota and voting shares under the new quota formula. ...|$|R
2500|$|A common {{criticism}} of the CFP is its centralised, top-down approach to management; although Member States {{are responsible for the}} policy's implementation and enforcement, the EU adopts sole competence in the creation of proposals and the making of decisions. The Commission is not exclusively responsible for the setting of total allowable catches. These are proposed by the commission but ultimately determined by the Council of Ministers.

Although Member States hold some responsibilities, such as the <b>distribution</b> of <b>quotas,</b> it is argued that the EU retains too much authority over fisheries management. Furthermore, critics maintain that the organisation is ill-suited to the task of fisheries management as it lacks sufficient understanding of fisheries, and is too far removed from the realities of the industry to set accurate TACs and quotas.

40|$|A key {{objective}} of the European Union's Common Fisheries Policy reforms is the elimination of discards {{and a reduction in}} unwanted catches. Combining a discard ban with catch quotas, where all fish, independent of size, count towards quotas could create economic incentives for more selective fishing, reducing unwanted catches. We use fishing activities data from English North Sea otter trawlers to examine the impact of these measures on this fleet. Initial impacts depend on the scale of increase and <b>distribution</b> of <b>quotas</b> and are unevenly distributed, depending on catch and discard characteristics of vessels. Selective fishing will be rewarded as vessels that currently have low discards could increase catches and profits. Fishing by less selective vessels will be curtailed, reducing profits by 1 – 14 %. This could be partially mitigated through reducing regulated catches but will require changes to fishing patterns as using currently available selective fishing gears may impact on profitability. So, catch quotas and a discard ban create strong incentives for more selective fishing practices, but also for non-compliance with full documentation of catches. A high level of monitoring and enforcement will be required to ensure that fishers improve profitability through more selective fishing practices rather than illegal discarding...|$|R
