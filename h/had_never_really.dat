5|$|In 1258, Henry faced {{a revolt}} among the English barons. Anger had grown {{about the way}} the King's {{officials}} were raising funds, the influence of the Poitevins at court and his unpopular Sicilian policy; even the English Church had grievances over its treatment by the King. The Welsh were still in open revolt, and now allied themselves with Scotland. Henry was also critically short of money; although he still had some reserves of gold and silver, they were totally insufficient to cover his potential expenditures, including the campaign for Sicily and his debts to the Papacy. Critics suggested darkly that he <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> intended to join the crusades, and was simply intending to profit from the crusading tithes. To compound the situation, the harvests in England failed. Within Henry's court there was a strong feeling that the King would be unable to lead the country through these problems.|$|E

25|$|However, {{the land}} was {{restored}} to a native magnate, Ailin's son Ailín, and recognized as a Mormaer (comes). The reasons for this are unknown. Perhaps the crown <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> controlled it; or perhaps, as Neville suggests (p.15), the frontier region of Lennox lost its importance after the defeat and death of Somhairle mac Gille Bhrigdhe. Part of the reason was undoubtedly the promotion of David to the Earldom of Huntingdon.|$|E

25|$|We are now {{left with}} two sons from Antonio's first {{marriage}} {{who worked in}} the family shop: Omobono and Franceso. As Omobono had left the dwelling aged eighteen in search of new employment possibilities in Naples, he left Antonio to pay for much of his living expenses. In this sense, his father <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> forgiven him for leaving home. Just as Paolo, he would inherit six violins. That was all that was written on the will for him. As For Francesco, who was named his father's successor, he would inherit the rest of his father's belongings, the rest of the estate. This included all of the wood tools, stencils, finished violins, patterns, not to mention, his father's reputation.|$|E
25|$|Although there <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> been peace, the War of the Ring {{started in}} Rohan when Saruman's troops crossed the Fords of Isen. Théodred, {{the son of}} the King Théoden, had mustered his forces on the fords to launch a {{surprise}} attack against the enemy. On 23 February TA 3019 he attacked the vanguard of the orcs marching out of Isengard. Reinforcements were quickly sent from Isengard however, and Théodred ordered a retreat. His forces retreated to an island in the fords, but they were soon surrounded and he was killed. Grimbold managed to hold the island, but would not have succeeded if Elfhelm had not come with reinforcements from Helm's Deep. Thus the first battle of the Fords of Isen ended in defeat for the Rohirrim.|$|E

Many English professors in attendance were upset by his remarks; one elderly professor reportedly approached him, said: [...] "How dare you!", and stormed away. Another suggested that Achebe had [...] "no sense of humour", but several days later Achebe was approached by a third professor, who told him: [...] "I now realize that I <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> read Heart of Darkness although I have taught it for years." [...] Although the lecture angered many of his colleagues, he was nevertheless presented later in 1975 with an honorary doctorate from the University of Stirling and the Lotus Prize for Afro-Asian Writers.|$|E
500|$|The film (and {{subsequent}} novel) were memoirs {{written by}} Herman Raucher; they detailed {{the events in}} his life {{over the course of}} the summer he spent on Nantucket Island in 1942 when he was fourteen years old. Originally, the film was meant to be a tribute to his friend Oscar [...] "Oscy" [...] Seltzer, an Army medic killed in the Korean War. Seltzer was shot dead on a battlefield in Korea whilst attending to a wounded man; this happened on Raucher's birthday, and consequently, Raucher has not celebrated a birthday since. During the course of writing the screenplay, Raucher came to the realization that despite growing up with Oscy and having bonded with him through their formative years, the two <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> had any meaningful conversations or gotten to know one another on a more personal level.|$|E
500|$|When {{the third}} edition was {{published}} in 1845, Balzac {{was in love with}} his own creation. He had written two years earlier to Hańska: [...] "There's no doubt about it – it is a magnificent poem. I <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> read it before.… The passion is sublime, and I now understand why you have a cherished and special devotion to this book.… All in all, I am very pleased with it." [...] In a preface to the third edition, he described his plans for a part of La Comédie Humaine called Scènes de la vie militaire (Scenes from Military Life). In addition to Les Chouans with its focus on guerrilla combat, he planned another called Les Vendéans about the earlier full-scale civil war. Although in 1844 he discussed traveling to western France to write the book, it was never written.|$|E

500|$|Cunningham sees A Handful of Dust as a {{forerunner of}} Waugh's later, avowedly Catholic novels. In keeping with Waugh's dismissive {{attitude}} to the Church of England, Anglicanism is shown as a farce (Mr Tendril the vicar's sermons), or a nullity (Tony's admission that he <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> {{thought much about}} God). Instead, Christianity is evoked by presenting the awfulness of life without it; according to the writer and critic Frank Kermode, [...] "he callousness of incident and the coldness of tone work by suggesting the positive and rational declaration of the Faith". The reader, Stannard says, [...] "is never allowed to forget man's primal bestiality... God is the key that has been thrown away in this purely secular world". John Raymond in the New Statesman refers to Waugh's [...] "unique type of moral vision", and calls the novel a [...] "powerful twentieth century sermon on the breakdown of a Christian marriage".|$|E
500|$|Cody {{stated that}} when writing the script, she was [...] "simultaneously {{trying to pay}} tribute to some of the {{conventions}} that we've already seen in horror, yet, at the same time, kind of turn them on their ear". One of her influences from the 1980s horror genre was the film The Lost Boys. She wanted to [...] "honor that, and at the same time, [...] <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> seen this particular subgenre done with girls and [...] tried to do a little of both". Despite this, she said she had noticed that [...] "the last survivor standing in the typical horror film is a woman" [...] and that because of this she feels [...] "horror has always had kind of a feminist angle to it in a weird way and, at the same time, it's kind of delightfully exploitative". Jennifer's Body could play on both of these aspects.|$|E
500|$|Scholarship {{since the}} 1970s {{has tended to}} move away from a pure study of iconography, instead {{emphasizing}} the paintings' and artists' relation to the social history of their time. According to Craig Harbison, [...] "Social history was becoming increasingly important. Panofsky <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> talked about what kind of people these were." [...] Harbison sees the works as objects of devotion with a [...] "prayer book mentality" [...] available to middle-class burghers who had the means and the inclination to commission devotional objects. Most recent scholarship is moving away from the focus on religious iconography; instead, it investigates how a viewer is meant to experience a piece, as with donor paintings that were meant to elicit the feeling of a religious vision. James Marrow thinks the painters wanted to evoke specific responses, which are often hinted at by the figures' emotions in the paintings.|$|E

500|$|Best {{decided to}} leave show business, {{and by the time}} of Hunter Davies' {{authorised}} Beatles' biography in 1968, he was not willing to talk about his Beatles association. Years later he stated in his autobiography, [...] "the Beatles themselves certainly never held out a helping hand and only contributed to the destruction with their readily printed gossip that I <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> been a Beatle, that I didn't smile, that I was unsociable and definitely not a good mixer. There was not a single friendly word from any one of them". This culminated in a Beatles' interview published in Playboy magazine in February 1965 in which Lennon stated that [...] "Ringo used to fill in sometimes if our drummer was ill. With his periodic illness." [...] Starr added: [...] "He took little pills to make him ill." [...] Best sued the Beatles for defamation of character, eventually winning an out-of-court settlement for much less than the $18 million he had sought.|$|E
500|$|Within the storyline, {{just two}} months after the wedding, Pauline's {{marriage}} is shown to sour after she discovers Joe's criminal past. Their relationship steadily deteriorates throughout the year, and in December 2006 Pauline ends the marriage—removing her wedding ring and informing Joe that he [...] "was half the man that Arthur had been, that she <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> loved him and that their sex life was a sham." [...] The resulting row sees Joe insult Pauline's family—suggesting that her [...] "perfect marriage" [...] with Arthur was [...] "nothing but a fantasy" [...] and branding Mark [...] "diseased", Michelle a [...] "scrubber" [...] and Arthur a [...] "con"—to which Pauline responds by smashing a plate over his head. Wendy Richard commented, [...] "It was not just the memory of Arthur that stopped the marriage to Joe being a success. He was proven to be a weak and untruthful man. That is what caused the marriage to be a non-starter. Pauline was not mean to Joe, he used her... and lied to her." ...|$|E
500|$|For obZen, Haake {{returned}} to the drum kit most notably with his performance on the song [...] "Bleed". In an interview for Gravemusic.com, Haake stated, [...] " [...] was a big effort for me to learn, I {{had to find a}} totally new approach to playing the double bass drums {{to be able to do}} that stuff. I <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> done anything like that before like the fast bursts that go all the way through the song basically. So I actually spent as much time practicing that track alone as I did with all of the other tracks combined. It's kind of a big feat to change your approach like that and I'm glad we were able to nail it for the album. For a while though we didn't even know if it was going to make it to the album." [...] Hagström also stated, [...] "obZen is one of the most highly technical offerings the band has ever put to tape". Revolver magazine confirms this statement: [...] "At first listen, obZen seems less challenging to the listener than some of the band's other records, and most of the songs flow smoothly from one syncopated passage to the next. However, careful examination reveals that the material is some of the group's most complicated".|$|E

500|$|Several critics {{called it}} a {{highlight}} of This Is What the Truth Feels Like. According to Pitchfork Jillian Mapes, [...] "Make Me Like You" [...] was the album's [...] "only... song that really works". Carolyn Menyes of Music Times said that of the two songs which [...] "capture... the earliest stage of a relationship" [...] (the other was [...] "Send Me a Picture"), [...] "Make Me Like You" [...] was [...] "more exciting". Ryan Middleton, also from Music Times, wrote that its [...] "solid production" [...] gave him a [...] "temporary earworm". Exclaim!s Gregory Adams praised Stefani's [...] "signature pipes" [...] in the chorus, and Amanda Dykan of AltWire wrote that the singer <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> been away. Although Adam R. Holz of Plugged In appreciated the song's [...] "honest lyrics", Lindsay Zoladz of Vulture found them [...] "irrepressibly" [...] and [...] "convincingly teenage". In The Michigan Daily, Christian Kennedy called them [...] "catchy without leaning towards the tepidity of much of today's pop music" [...] and they suited the song's [...] "well-oiled production". Mesfin Fekadu, a critic for The National, wrote that the single [...] "don't feel connected to Stefani – it's as if another pop star could sing the track and you wouldn't notice the difference"; Fekadu found the song [...] "disappointing for a singer who is usually a standout on the pop music scene".|$|E
500|$|It took [...] "fifteen man-years" [...] {{and three}} actual {{years to develop}} the game. [...] In a 2006 interview, lead {{designer}} Johnson said, [...] "I <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> designed a game before ... It's funny {{looking back on it}} now—just by happenstance I ended up creating a very open ended system where players could go anywhere and do whatever and a story sort of unfolded." [...] Ybarra stated that the game was almost cancelled more than once, and came out about a year behind schedule. Johnson was guided by Archon designer Paul Reiche III during development. Reiche advised him to draft a [...] "story network" [...] that would highlight all the most important points of the story and list the in-game objects necessary to advance from one to the next. The designers rewrote the script multiple times. The group designed what they called a [...] "fractal generator", which took six man-years to develop and allowed them {{to increase the number of}} planets in the game from 50 to 800. The game was one of the earliest to use procedurally generated content for planets and everything on them. The techniques used created a type of roguelike environment on each planet, with the contents randomly distributed. The story network was also one of the earliest examples of a sandbox game design. They created a separate ecosystem generator over the course of two man-years of work. The alien names were created by randomly combining syllables until they had names they liked, and their code for simulating communications was rewritten four times before completion.|$|E
500|$|Paramount CEO Sherry Lansing revived studio {{interest}} in 1998. Schroeder, who shepherded Tim Burton's Edward Scissorhands as a studio executive at 20th Century Fox in 1990, suggested that Burton direct the film. Francis Ford Coppola's minimal production duties came from American Zoetrope; Burton only {{became aware of}} Coppola's involvement during the editing process when he was sent a copy of Sleepy Hollows trailer and saw Coppola's name on it. Burton, coming off the troubled production of Superman Lives, was hired to direct in June 1998. [...] "I <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> done something that {{was more of a}} horror film," [...] he explained, [...] "and it's funny, because {{those are the kind of}} movies that I like probably more than any other genre." [...] His {{interest in}} directing a horror film influenced by his love for Hammer Film Productions and Black Sunday—particularly the supernatural feel they evoked as a result of being filmed primarily on sound stages. As a result, Sleepy Hollow is a homage to various Hammer Film Productions, including Dr. Jekyll and Sister Hyde, and other films such as Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein, various Roger Corman horror films, Jason and the Argonauts, and Scream Blacula Scream. The image of the Headless Horseman had fascinated Burton during his apprenticeship as a Disney animator at CalArts in the early 1980s. [...] "One of my teachers had worked on the Disney version as one of the layout artists on the chase, and he brought in some layouts from it, so that was exciting. It was one of the things that maybe shaped what I like to do." [...] Burton worked with Walker on rewrites, but Rudin suggested that Tom Stoppard rewrite the script to add to the comical aspects of Ichabod's bumbling mannerisms, and emphasize the character's romance with Katrina. His work went uncredited through the WGA screenwriting credit system.|$|E
