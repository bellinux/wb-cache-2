25|$|Autoreactive B {{cells can}} accidentally emerge during somatic {{hypermutation}} and migrate into the <b>germinal</b> <b>center</b> light zone. Autoreactive B cells, maturated coincidentally, normally {{do not receive}} survival signals by antigen planted on follicular dendritic cells and perish by apoptosis. In the case of clearance deficiency, apoptotic nuclear debris accumulates in the light zone of GC and gets attached to FDC. This serves as a germinal centre survival signal for autoreactive B-cells. After migration into the mantle zone, autoreactive B cells require further survival signals from autoreactive helper T cells, which promote the maturation of autoantibody-producing plasma cells and B memory cells. In the presence of autoreactive T cells, a chronic autoimmune disease may be the consequence.|$|E

40|$|During routine {{assessment}} of the hormonal phenotype of breast carcinomas, we detected expression of the estrogen receptor (ER) in the <b>germinal</b> <b>centers</b> of reactive lymphoid follicles surrounding malignant foci. To confirm and extend this finding, we compared ER-α, progesterone receptor (PR), and androgen receptor (AR) immunostaining in hyperplastic or metastatic lymph nodes obtained from patients with various pathology, disease location, gender and age. Irrespective of these parameters, we found that: 1) ER-α-positive cells were located prevalently in <b>germinal</b> <b>centers,</b> 2) the PR was weakly expressed by cells within and surrounding <b>germinal</b> <b>centers,</b> and 3) the androgen receptor was undetectable.

To examine how immune complexes reach <b>germinal</b> <b>centers,</b> where FDC are located, we injected mice with anti- 2, 4 -dinitrophenyl (DNP) antibodies complexed to DNP-myoglobin-coated gold particles. The distribution of the particles in spleens or draining lymph nodes was then determined with the electron microscope. The vast majority of the particles were cell bound. Shortly after injection they were phagocytized by macrophages or fixed on lymphocytes. The latter were found even in the corona of lymph follicles but not in <b>germinal</b> <b>centers.</b> Already 30 min after injection, FDC in contact with the corona were faintly positive but were negative in the center.

50|$|Within {{germinal}} centers, B cells proliferate and mutate {{the genetic}} region coding for their surface antibody (also known as immunoglobulin). The process is called somatic hypermutation and {{is responsible for}} introducing spontaneous mutations with a frequency of about 1 in every 1600 cell division (a relatively high frequency considering the low mutation frequency of other cells of the body being 1 in 106 cell divisions). Then after gaining a set number of mutations, <b>germinal</b> <b>center</b> B cells are subjected to a round of selection by TFH cells. B cell clones that have mutated and gained higher affinity surface immunoglobulin that better recognize antigen receive cellular contact-dependent survival signals from interacting with their cognate TFH cells {{and go on to}} one of three fates: (i) differentiate into plasma cells that have improved affinity towards antigen (therefore more efficient than their earlier the generation of plasma cells in clearing the infection), (ii) affinity matured memory B cells, or (iii) retained in the <b>germinal</b> <b>center</b> to re-enter another round of mutative replication and TFH cell-dependent selection. Therefore, as an infection proceeds, memory B cells selected in the later stages of a <b>germinal</b> <b>center</b> response are found to have accumulated the highest numbers of immunoglobulin mutation events with superior affinity towards their targeted antigen. Conversely, {{during the course of a}} <b>germinal</b> <b>center</b> reaction, low affinity or potentially auto-reactive <b>germinal</b> <b>center</b> B cell clones, or those that have gained non-functional mutations are out-competed by higher affinity clones and eventually undergo cellular apoptosis.|$|E
50|$|In 2000, Stanford {{researchers}} published {{results in}} Nature, utilizing expression profiling techniques to stratify DLBCL to two subtypes: <b>germinal</b> <b>center</b> B-like DLBCL and activated B-like DLBCL. The authors developed custom microarrays termed “lymphochips” {{that were used}} to query expression of 17,856 genes preferentially expressed in lymphoid cells and those with roles in cancer or immunology for 96 lymphocyte samples. The hierarchical clustering algorithm identified a subset of tumors that would have been labeled DLBCLs by traditional histological methods; however, the expression profiles of these tumors were heterogeneous. When the tumors were re-clustered based on expression of <b>germinal</b> <b>center</b> B-cell genes, a second group of genes characteristic of activated B-cells emerged and were oppositely regulated compared to the first set of genes. Based on these expression patterns, the heterogeneous DLBCL cluster was subclassified to the <b>germinal</b> <b>center</b> B-like DLBCL and activated B-like DLBCL. The distinction of these groups is significant in terms of patient overall survival: the probability of survival for patients with <b>germinal</b> <b>center</b> B-like DLBCLs over 10 years was about 80% while those with activated B-like DLBCLs was lowered to about 40% over a shorter eight-year period.|$|E

Rapid proliferation of blast cells in the <b>germinal</b> <b>centers</b> develops later than the peak of the primary response and coincides with development of primed cells after exposure to antigen (7, 8).

It is therefore important to determine the life history and immunological properties of the cell types arising in the white pulp after intravenous injection of antigen...|$|R
