The cumulative energy consumption was monitored during fibrillation. The degree of polymerization (DP) and water retention value (WRV) of the resultant cellulose fibrils were deter-mined as measures of the degree of fibrillation, which was also visualized by scanning electron microscopy, field emission-scanning electron microscopy, and transmis-sion electron microscopy imaging. A higher rotating speed than 1500  rpm did not improve the fibrillation judged by DP and WRV measurements. Solid loading has an insig-nificant effect on fibrillation in a wide range. The energy consumption (E) was determined {{as a function of the}} DP and WRV. The optimal grinding conditions were between 1200 and 1500  rpm at 2. 0 %– 2. 2 % solid loading...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In general, {{control of}} metal dust from {{hand-held}} disk grinders {{is difficult because}} such respirable dust tends to disperse in every direction around the grinding wheel and cannot be captured effectively by a conventional exhaust hood. The author described {{the application of a}} custom-made tool-mounted local exhaust ventilation (LEV) system attached to a hand-held <b>disk</b> <b>grinder,</b> and by laboratory experiments assessed its effectiveness at dust control. The effectiveness of the LEV for dust control was assessed by determining the respirable dust concentration around the grinding wheel during metal surface grinding with and without the use of the LEV. It was shown that the average respirable grinding dust concentration decreased from 7. 73 mg/m 3 with the LEV off to 4. 87 mg/m 3 with the LEV on, a mean dust generation reduction of about 37 %.

Manual tools may include a welding or {{chipping}} hammer, {{which has a}} pointed tip on one end to break up large chunks of slag efficiently, or wire brushes. Power tools include angle <b>grinders</b> with <b>grinder</b> <b>disks</b> or wire brush wheels.|$|R
50|$|With {{developments}} in abrasive coating, the sheet material could withstand greater forces and speeds. This allowed {{the production of}} flapwheels for use with high speed angle <b>grinders.</b> These <b>disks</b> were different in format: flatter, like the original rigid angle <b>grinder</b> <b>disks,</b> and with the flaps arranged in a densely overlapped layout rather than radial. The extra lifetime this gave to the disk allowed their use for stock removal and metal shaping, not just finishing and polishing.|$|R
2500|$|The most {{essential}} robot peripheral {{is the end}} effector, or end-of-arm-tooling (EOT). Common examples of end effectors include welding devices (such as MIG-welding guns, spot-welders, etc.), spray guns and also grinding and deburring devices (such as pneumatic <b>disk</b> or belt <b>grinders,</b> burrs, etc.), and grippers (devices that can grasp an object, usually electromechanical or pneumatic). Another common means of picking up an object is by vacuum. End effectors are frequently highly complex, made to match the handled product and often capable of picking up an array of products at one time. [...] They may utilize various sensors to aid the robot system in locating, handling, and positioning products.|$|R
40|$|One of improtant {{steps in}} {{secondary}} coffee processing that influence on final product quality such as consistency and uniformity is milling process. Usually, Indonesian smallholder used "lumpang" for milling coffee roasted beans to coffee powder product which caused {{the final product}} not uniformed and consistent, and low productivity. Milling process of coffee roasted beans {{can be done by}} disk mill type mechanical grinder which is used by smallholder for milling several cereals. Indonesian Coffee and Cocoa Research Institute have developed disk mill type grinding machine for milling coffee roasted beans. Objective of this research is to find performance of disk mill type grinding machine for size reducing process of Robusta roasted beans from several size dried beans and roasting level treatments. Robusta dried beans which are taken from dry processing method have 13 — 14 % moisture content (wet basis), 680 — 685 kg/m 3 density, and classified in 3 sizes level. The result showed that the disk mill type of grinding machine could be used for milling Robusta roasted beans. Machine hascapacity 31 — 54 kg/h on 5, 310 — 5, 610 rpm axle rotation and depend on roasting level. Other technical parameters were 91 — 98 % process efficientcy, 19 — 31 ml/ kg fuel consumption, 0. 3 — 1 % slips, 50 — 55 % particles had diameter less than 230 mesh and 38 — 44 % particles had diameter bigger than 100 mesh, 32 — 38 % lightness was increased, 0. 6 — 12. 6 % density was decreased, and solubility of coffee powder between 28 — 30 %. Cost milling process per kilogram of Robusta roasted beans which light roast on capacity 30 kg/hour was Rp 362. 9.
