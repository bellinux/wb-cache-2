In this work, we have analyzed from theoretical perspective a new proposed microring resonator structure based on the wafer-bonding technique which implies the vertical coupling between the <b>passive</b> <b>bus</b> waveguide and the active ring resonator. We have investigated the possibility to obtain the monomode operation of the active ring waveguide for certain ring radius values by the selective attenuations of the higher order modes and the obtaining of the desired coupling efficiency by varying the technological parameters like the layers thickness, etching depth, bus waveguide width and the offset (misalignment between the ring and the bus waveguide). Depending on the fabrication method, the misalignment between the ring resonator and the bus waveguide may vary within a significant range. Therefore, we considered a much wider bus waveguide in the coupling region in order to minimise the effects of misalignment...|$|R

40|$|Classes of {{performance}} measures {{expressed in terms}} of H_ 2 -norms have been recently introduced to quantify the response of coupled dynamical systems to external perturbations. For the specific case of electric power networks, these measures quantify for instance the primary effort control to restore synchrony, the amount of additional power that is ohmically dissipated during the transient following the perturbation or, more conceptually, the coherence of the synchronous state. So far, investigations of these performance measures have been restricted to nodal perturbations. Here, we go beyond earlier works and consider the equally important, but so far neglected case of line perturbations. We consider a network-reduced power system, where a Kron reduction has eliminated passive buses. Identifying the effect that a line fault in the physical network has on the Kron-reduced network, we find that performance metrics depend on whether the faulted line connects two passive, two active buses or one active to one <b>passive</b> <b>bus.</b> In all cases, performance metrics depend quadratically on the original load on the faulted line times a topology dependent factor. Our theoretical formalism being restricted to Dirac-δ perturbations, we investigate numerically the validity of our results for finite-time line faults.
