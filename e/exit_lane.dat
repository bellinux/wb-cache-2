In April 2007, WMATA began testing the use of credit cards to pay for parking at six Metro stations, avoiding the need to pay for parking with SmarTrip cards at those stations. The sites are Anacostia on the Green Line, Shady Grove on the Red Line, Vienna and New Carrollton on the Orange Line, and Franconia-Springfield and Largo Town Center on the Blue Line.

500|$|By lap 59, Verstappen on {{the fast}} super-soft tyres was chasing Lotus driver Romain Grosjean for tenth position, with Verstappen making several {{attempts}} to pass over the following laps. At the beginning of lap 64, coming into turn one, Verstappen crashed {{into the back of}} the Lotus, sending him flying into the barriers. While he was able to walk away from the accident without injuries, a [...] "Virtual Safety Car" [...] condition was called by the race director to allow marshals to safely recover the damaged car. This was the first time a Virtual Safety Car had been used in Formula One. Shortly thereafter, the regular safety car was sent out on track. Lewis Hamilton, who had been leading the race by almost twenty seconds, was pitted apparently with the intention of returning him to the track ahead of his pursuers. The Mercedes pitwall crew, however, miscalculated the gap allowing Rosberg to take the lead while Hamilton emerged from the pit <b>exit</b> <b>lane</b> marginally behind Vettel who had stayed out under the safety car behind Rosberg. With the safety car coming into the pit lane on lap 70 of 78, Rosberg retained the lead unchallenged going on to win the Monaco Grand Prix for a third consecutive time whereas Hamilton finished third, unable to overtake Vettel for second position. Daniel Ricciardo had also made a pit stop under the safety car, and on fresh tyres he was able to pass Kimi Räikkönen in controversial circumstances. His teammate Kvyat then let him past in order to give him the chance to try and pass third-placed Hamilton. When Ricciardo was unable to overtake, he handed fourth place back to Kvyat. Ricciardo set the fastest lap of the race in the process. Jenson Button finished eighth, scoring four championship points for himself and the McLaren team, the first points for the renewed McLaren-Honda partnership since their return at the start of the 2015 season.|$|E

50|$|Fitch {{barriers}} are {{often found in}} a triangular arrangement {{at the end of}} a guard rail between a highway and an <b>exit</b> <b>lane</b> (the area known as the gore), along the most probable line of impact. The barriers in front contain the least sand, with each successive barrel containing more, so that when a vehicle collides with the barrels they shatter, the kinetic energy is dissipated by scattering the sand and the vehicle decelerates smoothly instead of violently striking a solid obstruction, reducing the risk of injury to the occupants.|$|E

5000|$|In 2005, the British Columbia provincial {{government}} introduced an infrastructure plan {{known as the}} [...] "Gateway Program". As part of that program, the Trans Canada highway through the Cassiar Connector was increased to three lanes in each direction. These lanes were intended to be used primarily for dedicated entry and <b>exit</b> <b>lanes.</b> Because the tunnel was originally designed to have three lanes in each direction, expansion was not necessary.|$|R
40|$|This {{fact sheet}} {{discusses}} {{the safety of}} motorway tunnels in the Netherlands. Broadly speaking, it is not certain whether crashes in the Netherlands are relatively more frequent in tunnels than on open road stretches. However, there are certain factors that increase the risk in tunnels, such as {{the proximity of the}} tunnel wall, limited sight distance, merging or <b>exit</b> <b>lanes</b> in or near the tunnel and great differences in lighting at the entrance and exit. Road safety in tunnels can be improved by creating emergency lanes which increase the distance to the tunnel wall, by limiting the gradient percentage, thus minimizing speed differences (separate lanes for heavy traffic are an alternative), and creating wide layouts in horizontal bends where these cannot be avoided. In addition, tunnel entrances and exits must be carefully designed: the lighting must be of a high quality, and, if there are no emergency <b>lanes,</b> <b>exit</b> <b>lanes</b> and weaving sections should be avoided {{in the vicinity of the}} tunnel as well as inside the tunnel. Furthermore, tunnels should be equipped with high-quality outlet systems for fluids...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the factors}} in the {{creation}} of a vital central business district (CBD) is the location and accessibility of its parking facilities. A parking facilit y brings an increase in traffic volume and directs traffic onto adjacent local streets. If parking portals are designed properly, a parking facility will have negligible effect on the adjacent street network. If, however, the parking portals are not designed properly, the resulting traffic congestion will have a significant effect on the local streets: If there are not enough entry or <b>exit</b> <b>lanes</b> available during the peak operating hours, vehicles will be stored on the local streets and also within the parking <b>exit</b> <b>lanes.</b> The capacity at these portals is also reduced by frictional factors that are inherent in the design. This article reports on research to determine the types of parking gate controls that are available and the minimum number of lanes required to operate a parking lot or parking structure in a CBD. In comparing various parking studies with manufacturer’s specifications and recommendations, it was found that the projected volumes for each portal usually exceeded the design volumes for the type of controls selected...|$|R
5000|$|The bridge has a {{total length}} of 4,672 ft, {{including}} a 930 ft pontoon section {{that can be}} retracted under the fixed bridge to allow the largest battleships and aircraft carriers to pass.

50|$|The {{bridge is}} notorious amongst many for daily backups {{stretching}} {{a few miles}} (several kilometers). Most traffic stems from the I-10/I-110 junction. Eastbound traffic is reduced from three lanes to one through lane and an <b>exit</b> <b>lane</b> to Washington Street around a sharp curve. Traffic must be cautious as traffic from I-110 South may cross all lanes of traffic to exit at Washington street, only 1/4 mi away. Because of this junction and lack of shoulders along the entire bridge, traffic usually backs up to, at least, the LA 415 exit (Exit 151) and for 3 mi along LA 1 northbound.|$|E
50|$|The 38 mi of I-70 between Washington and New Stanton is a sub-standard {{section of}} the highway. This section of I-70 used to be PA 71. It is {{characterized}} by sharp curves, limited sight distance, narrow shoulders, and lack of merge lanes at interchanges. Traffic on clover leaf ramps must weave in the right through lane of traffic {{due to the lack}} of a third lane for entering and exiting traffic. Other on and off ramps effectively function as right-in/right-out interchanges, forcing vehicles to weave in and out of the <b>exit</b> <b>lane.</b> The speed limit on this stretch is 55 mph.|$|E

40|$|Building {{multistory}} car parks presents one of {{the possible}} solutions for a problem with finding available parking spaces in urban parts of the city, caused by the everyday growth in cars and needs for parking lots. The field of construction and building a multistory car park is not yet developed in Slovenia, therefore {{anyone who wants to}} start constructing that type of a structure is left on its own. Main {{purpose of this paper is}} to collect and process knowledge in field of constructing traffic elements and leading traffic flows in parking structures, that can help introduce architect and other planners with the basic problems regarding this field. The quality of multistory car parks is defined by level of service they offer. Level of service is graded with letters from A to D, where A offers the best comfort for users and their cars, meanwhile D offers lowest acceptable comfort. Basing on these grades, maximum and minimum dimensions and values are recommended for construction and traffic elements. This paper also presents equations for delays, queues and number of required entry and <b>exit</b> <b>lanes.</b> Values of parameters such as service rates at the entries and <b>exits</b> <b>lanes</b> were additionally measured in three multistory car parks in the city of Ljubljana, based on which the average values were determined and can be used in planning new parking structures...|$|R
