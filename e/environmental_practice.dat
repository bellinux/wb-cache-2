[...] Clinicians assess the sleep hygiene of people who present with insomnia and other conditions, such as depression, and offer recommendations based on the assessment. [...] Sleep hygiene recommendations include establishing a regular sleep schedule, using naps with care, not exercising physically or mentally too close to bedtime, limiting worry, limiting exposure to light in the hours before sleep, getting out of bed if sleep does not come, not using bed for anything but sleep and sex, avoiding alcohol as well as nicotine, caffeine, and other stimulants in the hours before bedtime, and having a peaceful, comfortable and dark sleep environment.|$|E

30|$|The {{systematic}} {{literature study}} {{provides information on}} what has been published about <b>environmental</b> <b>practices</b> {{as a part of}} offerings or requirements of green logistics services. Due to the relatively scarce results from the literature search, additional literature within the field of green logistics helps to structure and enrich the findings. The findings from the home pages are then used to possibly widen the picture of offerings and requirements by adding more specific <b>environmental</b> <b>practices</b> within each of the general practices. Finally, the four cases, that include one relationship between an LSP and a shipper each, provide insights into <b>environmental</b> <b>practices</b> in specific buyer–supplier relationships. Whereas the home page scan potentially offers wide range of <b>environmental</b> <b>practices,</b> due to companies’ willingness to promote their environmental image, the cases offer insight into the relational perspective of the inclusion of <b>environmental</b> <b>practices.</b> Thus, although the cases could include similar <b>environmental</b> <b>practices</b> as found in the home page scan, the LSP–shipper cases could potentially include additional <b>environmental</b> <b>practices</b> relevant for the specific relationships.|$|R

Betts, for the Doctor of Philosophy Degree in Business Administration defended December 14, 2011, 10 : 00 a. m. 108 Rehn Hall at Southern Illinois University Carbondale. TITLE: THE ROLE OF COMPETITIVE CAPABILITIES AND STAKEHOLDER PRESSURE IN THE ADOPTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL PRACTICES AND IMPACT ON BUSINESS PERFORMANCE MAJOR PROFESSOR: Dr. Suresh Tadisina This paper {{examines}} the underlying effect of manufacturing plants 2 ̆ 7 competitive capabilities and their adoption of <b>environmental</b> <b>practices.</b> A Natural Resource Based View (NRBV) theoretical approach was utilized {{to develop and}} test a set of hypotheses surrounding how manufacturing plants with specific competitive capabilities would have a greater likelihood of implementing sets of <b>environmental</b> <b>practices</b> with similar underlying resources and capabilities. Further analysis evaluated how the influence of stakeholder pressures moderated the relationship between competitive capabilities {{and the degree of}} adoption of <b>environmental</b> manufacturing <b>practices.</b> Multiple regression results indicate quality and cost competitive capabilities are positively significantly associated with the adoption of specific <b>environmental</b> <b>practices.</b> Further analysis indicates stakeholder pressures do not moderate the relationship between competitive capabilities and the degree of adoption of <b>environmental</b> <b>practices.</b> Unique sets of stakeholder pressures are independent predictors for each set of <b>environmental</b> <b>practices.</b> ANOVA analysis indicates competitive process flexibility capability and product design <b>environmental</b> <b>practices</b> and competitive product innovation capability and product design <b>environmental</b> <b>practices</b> positively significantly impact business performance. This study contributes to the literature by providing insights into competitive capabilities which link to the degree of adoption of specific <b>environmental</b> <b>practices</b> and insights into synergies which may exist between competitive capabilities and <b>environmental</b> <b>practices</b> and their effects on business performance...|$|R

40|$|With the {{emergence}} of environmental protection as a global issue, implementing <b>environmental</b> <b>practices</b> for sustaining green supply chain management (GSCM) has {{received a lot of}} attention.

Finally, it investigates the relationship between <b>environmental</b> <b>practices</b> and performance in order to sustain green supply chains. Based on 272 survey responses from supply and purchase managers, our research results support the positive impact of integration with suppliers and the negative impact of supply disruption risk on the adoption of <b>environmental</b> <b>practices.</b> Furthermore, they provide empirical evidence that <b>environmental</b> <b>practices</b> and integration with suppliers are positively associated with performance, while supply disruption risk is negatively associated with performance.

40|$|Purpose: Although it {{has been}} {{suggested}} that shippers’ demands regarding <b>environmental</b> <b>practices</b> appear to have an impact on the environmental work of LSPs, limited attention has been given to <b>environmental</b> <b>practices</b> in the relationships between LSPs and shippers. The purpose of this paper is to explore how dependencies between LSPs and shippers can influence the way in which <b>environmental</b> <b>practices</b> are coordinated in the relationships between them. Design/methodology/approach: Four dyadic case studies, each consisting of one LSP and one shipper, provide the empirical basis for this paper. Findings: Two types of dependencies are suggested as having an influence over the coordination of <b>environmental</b> <b>practices</b> in LSP-shipper relationships: dependence between LSPs and shippers as such; and dependence with regard to specific <b>environmental</b> <b>practices.</b> In addition, the environmental ambition of the actors is found to be of relevance when LSPs and shippers coordinate <b>environmental</b> <b>practices</b> between them. Based on these parameters, different coordination mechanisms for <b>environmental</b> <b>practices</b> in LSP-shipper relationships are discussed. Research limitations/implications: The research is limited to four cases in a Swedish context. Additional cases might provide other insights into LSP-shipper relationships and thereby lead to modifications of the proposed conceptual framework. Practical implications: The results can help both LSPs and shippers improve their work with <b>environmental</b> <b>practices</b> through the use of the appropriate coordination mechanisms in their inter-organisational relationships. Originality/value: Contrary to previous research, which mainly takes one party’s perspective, this paper takes a dyadic approach and thereby adds valuable knowledge to the inter-organisational aspects of LSPs’ environmental work.

30|$|The {{importance}} of environmental consideration for companies is mounting. This applies particularly well to logistics service providers (LSPs) {{who will have}} a possibility to compete by being greener than their competitors by offering services that include different green practices. As their customers {{play a vital role}} with regard {{to the extent to which}} LSPs can include <b>environmental</b> <b>practices</b> in their business, the interface between these actors is of interest. The purpose of this article is to describe and explain how <b>environmental</b> <b>practices</b> are reflected in offerings and requirements on the logistics market. A systematic literature review of what has been published on <b>environmental</b> <b>practices</b> as parts of offerings and requirements was complemented by a wider literature review. Empirical data were collected through a home page scan and a case study of four LSP–shipper dyads. With a starting point in stakeholder theory, the different data sets were analysed separately as well as combined, and similarities and differences were discussed. The findings point to differences in the way that LSPs and shippers offer and require <b>environmental</b> <b>practices</b> on their home pages and reasons for this are suggested to be due to their different types of stakeholders. Further, the <b>environmental</b> <b>practices</b> in relationships between LSP and shippers are often more relationship specific than practices on home pages. Based on the combined findings of the data sets, a classification of <b>environmental</b> <b>practices</b> as reflected in offerings and requirements on the logistics market is proposed. The article is mainly based on companies’ practices in Sweden and thereby provides a possibility to extend the research into other countries as well. By taking two perspectives, the findings from this research can have implications both for purchasing and marketing of logistic services. The paper suggests which <b>environmental</b> <b>practices</b> that LSPs and shippers can offer or require in different stages of their business relationships. Contrary to most research within green logistics, this paper takes a business perspective on <b>environmental</b> <b>practices.</b> Further, the dual perspective of LSPs and shippers taken in this paper offers novel insight into how <b>environmental</b> <b>practices</b> can be included at different stages of LSP–shipper relationships.|$|R
40|$|Spillover {{effects are}} treated as the {{influence}} of knowledge and innovation diffusion on an economic activity, but their analysis related to <b>environmental</b> <b>practices</b> within firms is still quite scarce. This study investigates the effect of <b>environmental</b> <b>practices</b> and related spillovers on productivity and efficiency in agri-food firms located in Southeast Spain. The low investment {{in research and development}} actions in comparison with the industrial sector, together with the relatively recent application of environmental requirements and the heterogeneity of environmental controls within firms have led to important changes in the organisation and management of their productive activity. These features are especially related to the implications that location and clustering factors have on environmental knowledge and innovation diffusion. Taking <b>environmental</b> management <b>practices</b> as knowledge of capital, we propose a specific analysis that evaluates the impacts of both environmental investment and spillover on the production function. The results indicate the relationship between productivity improvement and <b>environmental</b> <b>practices,</b> also showing the presence of positive spillovers. In a second-stage analysis, the incidence of environmental variables on the individual technical efficiency of firms is also determined. On the whole, the empirical analysis provides evidence of the links between <b>environmental</b> <b>practices</b> spillovers and economic performance. <b>Environmental</b> <b>practices</b> Spillovers Productivity Efficiency Food firms...|$|R
