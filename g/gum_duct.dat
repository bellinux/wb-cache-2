5000|$|Baling wire is {{sometimes}} {{used in an}} informal, make-do manner as an easy fix. It is frequently referred to {{as one of the}} basic repair materials. Typical uses range from supporting loose mufflers to patching chain-link fences. Common phrases often include baling wire as an ad hoc, fix-anything material, alongside chewing <b>gum,</b> <b>duct</b> tape, and the cable tie.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{carnivorous}} {{plants have}} glands that produce secretionscapable of digesting insects and small animals. These glandsoccur on leaf parts modified as insect-trapping structures. Inthe sundews ( [...] Drosera [...] ) the traps bear stalked glands, calledtentacles. When an insect {{lights on the}} leaf, the tentacles benddown and cover the victim with a mucilaginous secretion, theenzymes of which digest the insect. See insectivorous plants. Resin ducts are canals lined with secretory cells that releaseresins into the canal. Resin ducts are common in gymnospermsand occur in various tissues of roots, stems, leaves, andreproductive structures. Gum ducts are similar to resin ducts and may contain resins,oils, and gums. Usually, the term <b>gum</b> <b>duct</b> is used withreference to the dicotyledons, although gum ducts also mayoccur in the gymnosperms.Oil ducts are intercellular canals whose secretory cells produceoils or similar substances. Such ducts may be seen, forexample, {{in various parts of}} the plant of the carrot family(Umbelliferae).Laticifers are cells or systems of cells containing latex, a milkyor clear, colored or colorless liquid. Latex occurs underpressure and exudes from the plant when the latter is cut.|$|E
40|$|Estudou-se a ocorrência de canais secretores de goma nos orgãos vegetativos de Vochysia thyrsoidea Pohl, planta nativa dos cerrados do Brasil Central. Nos estágios iniciais do desenvolvimento, a espécie possui uma tuberosidade formada pelo hipocótilo e pela parte {{superior}} da raiz principal. O xilema secundário da parte hipocotilar da tuberosidade apresenta áreas parenquimáticas e canais secretores de goma. Discute-se a possível relação ontogenética entre as áreas parenquimáticas e os canais de goma. Questiona-se a origem traumática dos canais. The {{occurrence of}} <b>gum</b> <b>ducts</b> in the vegetative organs of Vochysia thyrsoidea Pohl, a native plant from the "cerrado" vegetation of central Brazil was studied. This species presents a swollen structure, which forms from the hypocotyl {{and the upper}} part of the primary root during the early stages of development. The secondary xylem of the hypocotyl part of the swollen structure shows the presence of both parenchymatic zones and <b>gum</b> <b>ducts.</b> The possible ontogenetic relationship between the parenchymatic zones and the <b>gum</b> <b>ducts</b> is discussed in this paper. The traumatic origin of the <b>gum</b> <b>ducts</b> is questioned...|$|R
40|$|The leprosis disease shows a viral {{etiology}} and the citrus leprosis virus is considered its etiologic agent. The disease may show {{two types of}} cytopatologic symptom caused by two virus: nuclear (CiLV-N) and cytoplasmic (CiLV-C) types. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the morpho-anatomical differences in the lesions caused by leprosis virus-cytoplasmic and nuclear types in Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck 'Pêra'. Leaf and fruit lesions were collected in Piracicaba/São Paulo (cytoplasmic type) and Monte Alegre do Sul/São Paulo and Amparo/São Paulo (nuclear type). The lesions were photographed and then fixed in Karnovsky solution, dehydrated in a graded ethylic series, embedded in hydroxy-ethyl methacrylate resin (Leica Historesin), sectioned (5 &# 956;m thick), stained and mounted in synthetic resin. The digital images were acquired in a microscope with digital video camera. Leaf and fruit lesions caused by the two viruses were morphologically distinct. Only the lesion caused by CiLV-N virus presented three well-defined regions. In both lesions there was the accumulation of lipidic substances in necrotic areas that were surrounded by cells with amorphous or droplets protein. Only leaf and fruit lesions caused by CiLV-N virus exhibited traumatic <b>gum</b> <b>ducts</b> in the vascular bundles...|$|R

A doença leprose dos citros tem etiologia viral sendo o citrus leprosis virus seu agente etiológico. Demonstrou-se que há dois vírus distintos que causam sintomas de leprose em ci-tros: citoplasmático (CiLV-C) e o nuclear (CiLV-N). O objetivo desse estudo foi comparar as diferenças morfo-anatômicas nas lesões causadas por CiLV-C e por CiLV-N em laranjeira doce (Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck) 'Pêra'. As lesões foliares e dos frutos foram coletadas em Piracicaba/SP (tipo citoplas-mático) e em Monte Alegre do Sul/SP e Amparo/SP (tipo nuclear). As lesões foram fotografadas e em seguida fixadas em solução Karnovsky, desidratadas em série etílica, incluídas em historesina e secionadas em micrótomo rotativo. As lâminas foram coradas, analisadas e fotografadas. As lesões foliares e do fruto causadas pelos dois vírus eram morfologicamente distintas. Somente a lesão causada por CiLV-N apresentou três regiões bem definidas. Em ambas as lesões ocorreu acúmulo de substâncias lipídicas nas áreas necrosadas que se achavam envoltas por células com conteúdo protéico amorfo ou em gotas. Somente as lesões da folha e do fruto causadas pelo CiLV-N exibiram ductos traumáticos gomosos nos feixes vasculares...|$|R
50|$|The family, Araliaceae, {{to which}} the Polyscias genus {{including}} Ming aralia belongs, {{gives rise to a}} multitude of trees or shrubs that contain <b>gum</b> and resin <b>ducts.</b> As a whole, the family contains plants that have leaves of alternate, palmately or pinnately compound or simple, with stipules. The inflorescences are generally umbellate, and often arranges in compound umbels, caouttules, panicles or races. They possess flowers of smaller size than the dioecious which are bisexual or unisexual.This family also includes a multitude of popular house plants, including English ivy, as well as the herb ginseng. Araliaceae is known as the ginseng family, which is where the traits of the Ming Aralia spice and medical herb originate. Plants of this family can be found throughout the Neotropics, for the greater part in mountainous regions and much less in the lowlands.|$|R
5|$|Making {{up about}} 2 {{percent of cases}} of paralytic polio, bulbar polio occurs when {{poliovirus}} invades and destroys nerves within the bulbar region of the brain stem. The bulbar region is a white matter pathway that connects the cerebral cortex to the brain stem. The destruction of these nerves weakens the muscles supplied by the cranial nerves, producing symptoms of encephalitis, and causes difficulty breathing, speaking and swallowing. Critical nerves affected are the glossopharyngeal nerve (which partially controls swallowing and functions in the throat, tongue movement, and taste), the vagus nerve (which sends signals to the heart, intestines, and lungs), and the accessory nerve (which controls upper neck movement). Due to the effect on swallowing, secretions of mucus may build up in the airway, causing suffocation. Other signs and symptoms include facial weakness (caused by destruction of the trigeminal nerve and facial nerve, which innervate the cheeks, tear <b>ducts,</b> <b>gums,</b> and muscles of the face, among other structures), double vision, difficulty in chewing, and abnormal respiratory rate, depth, and rhythm (which may lead to respiratory arrest). Pulmonary edema and shock are also possible and may be fatal.|$|R
