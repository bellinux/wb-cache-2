5|$|Most {{data about}} the {{encounter}} were acquired using photographic observations by cameras of the European Fireball Network. It was the first event of this type recorded by cameras from two distant locations, at Červená hora and Svratouch (both in the present-day Czech Republic), which enabled the calculation of the meteoroid's orbital characteristics by geometrical methods. Both were equipped with all-sky <b>fisheye</b> objectives.|$|E
5|$|Enter the Voids {{post-production}} process lasted {{more than}} a year. Work on the digital effects was led by Pierre Buffin of BUF Compagnie. Every scene in the film includes computer-generated imagery (CGI)—even the flashback scenes, where the backdrops were digitally altered. Studio scenes, helicopter shots, and CGI were forged together in the hovering sequences with the intention that the viewer should be unable to determine which is which. For shots from high altitudes, the team started with helicopter footage from video, and then created computer models of the neighbourhoods with textures from photographs. Neon lights, reflections, and dark areas were consistently accentuated. Flickers were created through a mixture of motion blur, chromatic aberration, and focus effects. For scenes seen as through a <b>fisheye</b> lens, the team recreated the sets digitally and progressively increased the environments' reflection values along with the lens effect.|$|E
5|$|As Sonic Team {{was working}} on Nights into Dreams, Sega tasked the U.S.-based Sega Technical Institute (STI) with {{developing}} {{what would have been}} the first fully 3D entry in its popular Sonic the Hedgehog series. The game, Sonic X-treme, was moved to the Saturn after several prototypes for other hardware (including the 32X) were discarded. It featured a <b>fisheye</b> lens camera system that rotated levels with Sonic's movement. After Nakayama ordered the game be reworked around the engine created for its boss battles, the developers were forced to work between 16 and 20 hours a day to meet their December 1996 deadline. Weeks of development time proved fruitless after Stolar rescinded STI's access to Sonic Team's Nights into Dreams engine following an ultimatum by Nights programmer Yuji Naka. After programmer Ofer Alon quit and designers Chris Senn and Chris Coffin became ill, the project was cancelled in early 1997. Sonic Team started work on an original 3D Sonic title for the Saturn, but development was shifted to the Dreamcast and the game became Sonic Adventure. STI was disbanded in 1996 as a result of changes in management at Sega of America.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{receiving}} financing {{from other}} sources, including Saul Zaentz (who agreed {{to distribute the}} soundtrack album on his Fantasy Records label), the budget was tight enough to exclude pencil tests, so Bakshi had to test the animation by flipping an animator's drawings in his hand before they were inked and painted. When a cameraman realized that the cels for the desert scenes were not wide enough and revealed the transparency, Bakshi painted a cactus to cover the mistake. Very few storyboards were used. Bakshi and Vita walked around the Lower East Side, Washington Square Park, Chinatown and Harlem, taking moody snapshots. Artist Ira Turek inked the outlines of these photographs onto cels with a Rapidograph, the technical pen preferred by Crumb, giving the film's backgrounds a stylized realism virtually unprecedented in animation. The tones of the watercolor backgrounds were influenced {{by the work of}} Ashcan School painters such as George Luks and John French Sloan. Among other unusual techniques, bent and <b>fisheye</b> camera perspectives were used to portray the way the film's hippies and hoodlums viewed the city. Many scenes featured documentary recordings of real conversations in place of scripted dialogue—this too would become a signature of Bakshi's.|$|E

5000|$|As {{with other}} post-colonial populations, Trinidad's society {{represents}} {{a culture of}} resistance {{in response to the}} tyranny of slavery and colonialism in general. Although this expression of resistance is prevalent and observable in daily life, it is especially evident during Carnival and its performances where large audiences are in attendance. According to Nadia Johnson, [...] "the performativity of Trinidad's carnival becomes an outward expression of Calvary Hill's need to transform their social conditions. The characters respond to and resist their social conditions through their individual performances during the carnival season: <b>Fisheye's</b> steel band performance, Aldrick's dragon dance, and Philo's calypsos". If transformation of identity is the goal, then it is critical to assess which performances are effective in contributing to the transformation.|$|R
40|$|As a community, human-computer {{information}} and interface designers {{have tended to}} avoid use of <b>fisheyes,</b> and multi-scale presentations with their attendant distortion because of concern about how this distortion may lead to confusion and misinterpretation.

Is the lack of use in computer presentations because thus far in our computational uses of distortion we have failed to provide adequate support that allows people to comprehend {{the manner in which}} the information is being presented? We describe a study about relative difficulty in reading distortions that investigates the effect of the use viewing cues such as the cartographic grid and shading on people’s ability to interpret distortions.

This model encompasses the classical radial distortion model [4], <b>fisheyes</b> and most central or non-central catadioptric cameras. Calibration consists in the estimation of the distortion center, the opening angles of all viewing cones and their optical centers. We present two approaches of computing a full calibration from dense correspondences of a single or multiple planes with known Euclidean structure. The first one is based on a geometric constraint linking viewing cones and their intersections with the calibration plane (conic sections). The second approach is an homography-based method.

40|$|ABSTRACT. In gigacycle fatigue regime (Very High Cycle Regime, Nf> 107 cycles), {{the cracks}} can {{nucleate}} on inclusions, “supergrains”, pores …which {{leads to a}} fish-eye propagation around the defect. The initiation from an inclusion or other defect is closed to the total life, perhaps much more than 99 % of the life in many cases. The integration of the Paris law allows one to predict the number of cycles at crack initiation. As the crack initiation appears, a short crack around the defect propagates followed by a long crack. In all cases, a cyclic plastic zone around the crack exists, and the recording of the surface temperature of the sample during the test must allow to follow the crack propagation and {{to determine the number}} of cycles at the crack initiation. A thermo-mechanical model was developed. It allows the determination of the temperature field evolution in the specimen and shows a good correlation with the experiments. In this study, several fish-eyes from various materials (normalized steels, quenched and tempered steels, aluminium alloys) are observed by Scanning Electron Microscope, and the fractographic results are analyzed in accordance with the mechanical and thermo-mechanical model. These analysis suggest a mechanism for <b>fisheyes</b> formation...|$|R

40|$|Large {{works on}} paper, in {{particular}} ones that covered walls, were {{new in the}} realm of printed works of art during {{the early decades of the}} sixteenth century. Following in the footsteps of wall hangings and tapestries of the late medieval period, wallpaper became a new concept in the Renaissance. Although wallpaper has generally fallen in and out of favor in the past several decades, it recently has been experiencing its own renaissance with visual artists. At the Rhode Island School of Design, a 2003 exhibition entitled On the Wall: Wallpaper by Contemporary Artists featured wallpaper with a variety of patterns and designs, from <b>fisheyes</b> to photo-realist landscapes. Over the centuries wallpaper 2 ̆ 7 s popularity has also waxed and waned. In the final years of Albrecht Dürer’s life, thirty years after his Apocalypse series of 1498 changed how woodcuts were perceived in terms of size and importance, Dürer 2 ̆ 7 s pupil Sebald Beham rethought what a woodcut print might be and what it could show. This included its use as wallpaper. Where Dürer broke new ground in the exploration ofthe larger, full-page size for visual image alone and the role of the woodcut designer as publisher, Beham explored subject matter new for the woodcut technique and for large-sized woodcuts; subject matter that had sometimes been executed in engraving before, but never in woodcut in large format, and thereby expanded the audience for large independent woodcuts, including wallpaper prints. I will explore in this essay the use of such woodcuts, and their audiences and sizes. Later I will focus on one of Beham’s large woodcuts that was used as wallpaper, showing that the taste for such domestic decoration links the half millenium between the Northern Renaissance and the recent wallpaper revival...|$|R

Hendrix wanted [...] "something psychedelic", so he requested Ferris because he appreciated the photographer's sleeve-work on the Hollies' June 1967 release Evolution. During {{a meeting with the}} band, Ferris told Hendrix that he wanted to hear more of their music from which to draw inspiration. They accommodated his request by allowing him to attend several sessions for their second album, Axis: Bold as Love. Ferris brought home tapes from the sessions, which along with Are You Experienced he listened to intently. His first impression of the music was that it was [...] "so far out that it seemed to come from outer space", which inspired him to develop a backstory about a [...] "group travelling through space in a Biosphere on their way to bring their unworldly space music to earth." [...] With this concept in mind, he took color photographs of the band at Kew Gardens in London, using a <b>fisheye</b> lens which was then popular in Mod sub-culture. Ferris used what Egan described as [...] "an infrared technique of his own invention which combined color reversal with heat signature", further enhancing the exotic nature of the image. Ferris was an experienced fashion photographer, and his interest in the finer details of his covers led him to choose the band's wardrobe. After seeing Hendrix with his hair combed away from the scalp, Ferris requested that he wear it that way during the photo shoot. Hendrix's girlfriend, Kathy Etchingham, trimmed his hair to improve its symmetry, forming an afro that became the basis of a homogenized Experience image. Redding and Mitchell liked Hendrix's new hairstyle, so Ferris hired a hairdresser to style their hair in a similar fashion. After purchasing clothing for Redding and Mitchell at the boutiques on King's Road—Hendrix wore clothes from his wardrobe, including a psychedelic jacket with a pair of eyes printed on the front which had been given to him by a fan—the Experience travelled to Kew Gardens. In an effort to focus on Hendrix's hands, Ferris shot the band at a low angle. The daylight faded soon after their arrival at the garden, so they returned the following day for a second shoot, which was not needed; the image selected for the US cover of Are You Experienced was the first shot taken the previous day. Ferris chose the cover's yellow background and its surreal lettering, and he intended for a textured gatefold jacket that Reprise, as a cost-saving measure, did not approve.|$|E
