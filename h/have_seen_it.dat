5|$|Because of its {{distinctive}} course, the Brabant Revolution had been extensively used in historical comparisons with the French Revolution. Some historians, following Henri Pirenne, <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> {{as a key}} moment {{in the formation of}} a Belgian nation-state, and an influence on the Belgian Revolution of 1830.|$|E
5|$|Noronhomys vespuccii, {{also known}} as Vespucci's rodent, is an extinct rat species from the islands of Fernando de Noronha off northeastern Brazil. Italian {{explorer}} Amerigo Vespucci may <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> {{on a visit to}} Fernando de Noronha in 1503, but it subsequently became extinct, perhaps because of the exotic rats and mice introduced by the first explorers of the island. Numerous but fragmentary fossil remains of the animal, of uncertain but probably Holocene age, were discovered in 1973 and described in 1999.|$|E
5|$|The pose of Musidora {{is based}} on that of the Aphrodite of Cnidus and the Venus de' Medici. It is {{possible}} that Etty was also familiar with Thomas Gainsborough's Musidora, which shares similar elements. Gainsborough's Musidora, his only large nude, was never exhibited in his lifetime and remained in private hands until 1847, but Etty was familiar with its then-owner Robert Vernon and may <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> in his collection.|$|E
60|$|I POINTED to {{the writing}} in the sketch book, and looked at my mother. I was not mistaken. She <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it,</b> as I <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it.</b> But she refused to {{acknowledge}} that anything had happened to alarm her--plainly as I could detect it in her face.|$|R

5|$|Two of the statues, both in Arkansas, are {{individually}} {{listed on}} the National Register of Historic Places; one in Helena and one in Fort Smith. Installed in cemeteries, town squares, and parks, outside museums, on courthouse lawns, and countless other places, the design {{is said to be}} the most-viewed example of outdoor statuary in the U.S. (after the Statue of Liberty) although many people do not even realize they <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5|$|Other proffered {{explanations}} are the possible {{appearance of a}} displaced iceberg; the fear of running aground while becalmed, and a sudden seaquake. Hydrographical evidence suggests that an iceberg drifting so far south was improbable, and had it done so other ships would <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it.</b> Begg gives more consideration to a theory that Mary Celeste, while becalmed, began drifting towards the Dollabarat reef off Santa Maria Island. The theory supposes that Briggs, fearing his ship would run aground, launched the yawl {{in the hope of}} reaching land. The wind could then have picked up and blown Mary Celeste away from the reef, while the rising seas swamped and sank the yawl. The weakness of this theory is that if the ship had been becalmed, all sails would have been set to catch any available breeze, yet the ship was found with many of its sails furled.|$|E
25|$|International activists {{involved}} in the Occupy Movement <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> stall due a lack of synergy {{to work with other}} alternative movements calling for change. The biggest criticism is that the movement is without depth, without a lasting vision of an alternative future.|$|E
60|$|On a Sunday {{afternoon}} of late autumn {{they walked down}} to Lake Minniemashie. Ray {{said that he would}} like to <b>see</b> the ocean; <b>it</b> must be a grand sight; it must be much grander than a lake, even a great big lake. Vida <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it,</b> she stated modestly; she <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> on a summer trip to Cape Cod.|$|R

25|$|Nelson {{also wrote}} in a private letter to Lady Hamilton about 'the Nelson touch, which we say is {{warranted}} never to fail'. Seen in this context {{it is easy to}} see why some <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> as a private sexual joke between the two lovers (a little touch of Nelson in the night).|$|E
25|$|The Forth and Clyde Canal {{passes through}} {{this part of}} the city, and at one stage formed {{a vital part of the}} local economy. It was for many years {{polluted}} and largely unused after the decline of heavy industry, but recent efforts to regenerate and re-open the canal to navigation <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> rejuvenated.|$|E
25|$|To {{encourage}} {{innovation and}} avoid foreign intellectual property China {{has been developing}} indigenous technical standards. One example is the TD-SCDMA 3G standard. Critics <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> as costly and delaying 3G introduction while supporters argue that it has increased technical abilities and experience which has increased Chinese competitiveness regarding 4G. Long-Term Evolution Time-Division Duplex is being implemented as China's indigenous 4G standard.|$|E

60|$|She <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> young, and growing, she <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> {{strong and}} grown, and before her old eyes had time or {{strength}} {{to see any}} more, she died. She would have tried, and who knows but she might have kept it young and strong, with her old fingers, her trembling kisses--a little longer; alas! not even Aunt Ann could fight with Nature.|$|R
60|$|It was {{a startling}} likeness, and {{necessarily}} had a startling look. The painter hadn't made the scar, but I made it; {{and there it}} was, coming and going; now confined to the upper lip as I <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> at dinner, and now showing the whole extent of the wound inflicted by the hammer, as I <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> when she was passionate.|$|R
25|$|Outside {{commentators}} {{have also been}} critical of the decision, since it might discourage whistleblowers. In addition to echoing Stevens' concerns, they <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> as abandoning any concern for the truth, imposing a heavy burden on a plaintiff, relying on an overly narrow conception of the public's interest, and possibly discouraging people from entering public service. The decision resulted in a lower court changing its ruling in a high-profile case involving controversial academic Leonard Jeffries.|$|E
25|$|A {{point of}} ongoing {{controversy}} about courtly love is {{to what extent}} it was sexual. All courtly love was erotic to some degree, and not purely platonic—the troubadours speak of the physical beauty of their ladies and the feelings and desires the ladies arouse in them. However, {{it is unclear what}} a poet should do: live a life of perpetual desire channeling his energies to higher ends, or physically consummate. Scholars <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> both ways.|$|E
25|$|The ISTHA and the Toll Highway System in Illinois have {{undergone}} much criticism since the 1980s. Construction of the North–South Tollway (I-355) was delayed, in part, {{due to a}} dispute with the Morton Arboretum in Lisle, Illinois. Original plans for this toll highway would <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> constructed {{through the middle of}} land belonging to the Arboretum, and closer to the existing Illinois Route 53. Construction on other projects has also been delayed, mostly through protests by area residents.|$|E

25|$|Also {{noteworthy}} is {{the so-called}} First Swedish Crusade, which, according to several 15th-century sources, took place in 1150. The crusade is only known from later legends that presented the expedition (if it ever took place) as a Christian mission, headed by a saint king to baptize heathens. However, {{it seems to have}} followed the exceptionally edgy 1140s with both the Yem and Swedes fighting against Novgorod. Some historians <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> as a direct reaction to the failed Yem expedition in 1149, associating it with the co-operation mentioned by the Pope 20 years later.|$|E
25|$|Scholars have {{increasingly}} explored Ruth in ways which {{allow it to}} address contemporary issues. Feminists, for example, have recast the story {{as one of the}} dignity of labour and female self-sufficiency, and even as a model for lesbian relations, while others have seen in it a celebration of the relationship between strong and resourceful women. Others have criticised it for its underlying, and potentially exploitative, acceptance of a system of patriarchy in which a woman's worth can only be measured through marriage and child-bearing. Others again <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> as a book that champions outcast and oppressed peoples.|$|E
25|$|For the Aztecs {{the playing}} of the ballgame also had {{religious}} significance, {{but where the}} 16th-century K´iche´ Maya saw the game as a battle between the lords of the underworld and their earthly adversaries, their Aztec contemporaries may <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> as a battle of the sun, personified by Huitzilopochtli, {{against the forces of}} night, led by the moon and the stars, and represented by the goddess Coyolxauhqui and Coatlicue's sons the 400 Huitznahuah. But apart from holding important ritual and mythical meaning, the ballgame for the Aztecs was a sport and a pastime played for fun, although in general the Aztec game was a prerogative of the nobles.|$|E

25|$|Titus Andronicus is by {{no means}} the most brutal of Shakespeare's plays. More people die in Richard III. King Lear is a much more cruel play. In the whole Shakespearean {{repertory}} I can find no scene so revolting as Cordelia's death. In reading, the cruelties of Titus can seem ridiculous. But I <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> on the stage and found it a moving experience. Why? In watching Titus Andronicus we come to understand – perhaps more than by looking at any other Shakespeare play – the nature of his genius: he gave an inner awareness to passions; cruelty ceased to be merely physical. Shakespeare discovered the moral hell. He discovered heaven as well. But he remained on earth.|$|E
25|$|In March 2008, {{construction}} commenced on a 36km section (22 miles) of the M7 route between Castletown, County Laois and Nenagh, tying {{into the}} Portlaoise-Castletown scheme mentioned above at the Borris-in-Ossory junction. It runs between junctions 21 and 24 on the N7-M7 corridor. This scheme was originally planned to proceed as a High Quality Dual Carriageway (HQDC), which would <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> built {{to many of}} the same engineering standard as a motorway, with a design speed of 120km/h, however a Statutory Instrument was passed on 17 July 2008, re-designating this and many other new HQDC schemes as motorway. Consequently, when this scheme was complete, it opened with full motorway regulations on 22 December 2010.|$|E
25|$|In {{popular culture}} and UFO {{conspiracy}} theories, men in black (MIB) are supposed men dressed in black suits who claim to be government agents who harass or threaten UFO witnesses to keep them quiet about what they <b>have</b> <b>seen.</b> <b>It</b> is sometimes implied {{that they may be}} aliens themselves. The term is also frequently used to describe mysterious men working for unknown organizations, as well as various branches of government allegedly designed to protect secrets or perform other strange activities. The term is generic, used for any unusual, threatening or strangely behaved individual whose appearance on the scene can be linked in some fashion with a UFO sighting. Several alleged encounters with the men in black have been reported by UFO researchers and enthusiasts.|$|E
