5000|$|GLX: 1294cc G1A, 1360cc TU3, and 1580cc XU5 engines, {{all with}} 5 speed {{gearboxes}} and all with 5-doors. Standard equipment includes a digital clock, a tachometer, a sliding glass moonroof, sports style seats (similar to those fitted to the 205 XS), rear wash/wipe, door bump strips, <b>intermittent</b> <b>wipe,</b> {{and a small}} boot spoiler. The 1.6 model also added central locking and front electric windows to the list. Post facelift 1.3 models and the 1.4 model also have central locking. Curiously, if the GLX was ordered in white, and later burgundy red, the bumpers were body coloured, with a contrasting trim strip, red with the white bumpers and silver with the burgundy ones. After the facelift the bumpers also gained a pair of fog lights. A reflective strip panel was also on the options list, that replaced the louvred panel that sits between the rear lights.|$|E
5000|$|XL, GL: 1294cc G1A, 1580cc XU5, and 1905cc XUD engines (with D suffix), {{all with}} 5 speed gearboxes, X with three doors and G with 5. The L model was {{available}} throughout the 309's production, varying differently from early to late cars. The early cars came with some standard features, such as better seat coverings than the E model, a {{clock on the}} dashboard, door bump strips, <b>intermittent</b> <b>wipe,</b> a glovebox door (as opposed to the X/GE's glovebox hole), 50/50 split/fold rear seats, full size wheel covers and a rear wash/wipe. A three speed automatic option was available with the XU5 engined GL. Later in the production run, the XL model was dropped, and a 1769 cc XUD turbo diesel engine {{was added to the}} L range, to become GLDTurbo, which featured alloy wheels (from the Peugeot 205 1.6 GTI), uprated GTI specification suspension, and a pair of front fog lights. Options on this also included central locking, electric front windows and the Peugeot vacuum operated moonroof, essentially a large glass sliding sunroof.|$|E
50|$|Aug 1980: Introduction of the Maxi 2 {{range in}} 1750 L, 1750 HL and 1750 HLS variations. All models feature new {{revisions}} including new bumpers incorporating indicators (front) and reversing lights (rear), new side repeaters, full cover plastic wheel trims and broader side moulding inserts. Inside the instrument bezels were now in matt black, the switchgear was also again revised, the headlight switch was {{now on the}} steering column {{and there was a}} choke warning light. The L replaced the previous Base model and added LM/MW push button radio, nylon trim, door bins, laminated windscreen and walnut veneer dashboard. The HL gained <b>intermittent</b> screen <b>wipe,</b> velour seats, tinted glass and extra sound insulation. The HLS gained a burr walnut veneer dashboard. However, LHD export Maxi 2s were still referred to as 'Austin' Maxis in sales literature, only one version being available, the single carburettor HL, though unlike the UK spec cars it did not feature a radio as standard.|$|R
