5|$|The film's idea {{originated}} in the late 1990s in screenwriter K. V. Vijayendra Prasad mind. At that time, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>joking</b> about a housefly seeking revenge on a human {{in a conversation with}} his son S. S. Rajamouli. Prasad later developed the idea as a script for an English-language film set in 1830s America, in which an African-American boy dies in an attempt to free his family from slavery and is reincarnated as a fly. After completing Maryada Ramanna (2010), Rajamouli reconsidered the concept after thinking of directing a film that was distinct from any other. He decided to make Eega a bilingual film in Telugu and Tamil– each scene including speech was filmed twice, once for each language. The Tamil version, titled Naan Ee, was Rajamouli's directorial debut in Tamil cinema. The film was presented by Daggubati Suresh Babu of Suresh Productions.|$|E

He originally claimed the number of murders was closer to 70, but then recanted his statement, claiming <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>joking</b> and had not committed any murders.|$|E
25|$|A {{controversy}} {{arose in}} 1989 following an address by Yusuf {{to students at}} London's Kingston University, where {{he was asked about}} the fatwa calling for the killing of Salman Rushdie, author of the novel The Satanic Verses. Yusuf made a series of comments that appeared to show his support for the fatwa. He released a statement the following day denying that he supported vigilantism, and claiming that he had merely recounted the legal Islamic punishment for blasphemy. In a 2006 BBC interview, he displayed a newspaper clipping from that period, with quotes from his statement. Subsequent comments made by him in 1989 on a British television programme were also seen as being in support of the fatwa. In a statement in the FAQ section of one of his websites, Yusuf asserted that while he regretted the comments, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>joking</b> and that the show was improperly edited. In the years since these comments, he has repeatedly denied ever calling for the death of Rushdie or supporting the fatwa.|$|E

50|$|Diego Portales here {{is portrayed}} by the actor Carlos Concha, who {{perfectly}} reflects {{both of the}} hero's sides. He portrays his kind side when <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>joking</b> with Necochea or with his family. And his more ruthless side is when his family is already dead.|$|R
500|$|Resistance: Fall of Man {{has been}} highly {{successful}} despite the controversy, and {{has resulted in}} the production of multiple products, including three sequels titled Resistance 2, Resistance 3 and [...] Resistance developer, Ted Price, commented that there would be more [...] "churches, mosques, and synagogues" [...] in Resistance 2 before its release. While it was not known whether <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>joking,</b> he admitted to being Episcopalian, and considers the Church of England to be the [...] "mother ship". However, Sony pledged to not include the Cathedral in another game.|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Durst {{announced}} that the band's third studio album would be titled Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water. The press thought <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>joking</b> about this title. The album title is intended {{to sound like a}} fictional band; the phrase [...] "Chocolate Starfish" [...] refers to the human anus, and Durst himself, who has frequently been called an [...] "asshole". Borland contributed {{the other half of the}} album's title when the band was standing around at a truck stop, looking at bottles of flavored water, and Borland joked that the truck stop didn't have hot dog or meat-flavored water.|$|E
500|$|Nonetheless, Kemper has {{continued}} to display potentially threatening behavior. [...] On one occasion, when Douglas' colleague Robert Ressler was in a cell alone with Kemper, Kemper—who at the time weighed —noticed the apprehension in Ressler after he had pressed a hidden button repeatedly to call a guard to open the cell yet not received a response and told him [...] "Relax. They're changing the shift," [...] but remarked: [...] "If I went apeshit in here, you'd be {{in a lot of}} trouble, wouldn't you? I could screw your head off and place it on the table to greet the guard." [...] Ressler verbally sparred with Kemper until the guard arrived, ultimately leaving unharmed with Kemper displaying no physical aggression. Kemper also stated afterwards that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>joking,</b> but Ressler never entered a cell alone again with Kemper and it became FBI policy to interview serial killers in pairs.|$|E

500|$|The couple put {{together}} an act and began booking it at small midwestern theaters. When an offer came for an engagement in Harwich Port, Massachusetts, some 2,000 miles from Kansas City, they were pleased to get it because of its proximity to their ultimate goal, the vaudeville houses of New York City. [...] To get to Massachusetts they bought a used car and borrowed five dollars from Edna's mother, {{but by the time}} they arrived in St. Louis they had only fifty cents. [...] Skelton asked Edna to collect empty cigarette packs; she thought <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>joking,</b> but did as he asked. [...] He then spent their fifty cents on bars of soap, which they cut into small cubes and wrapped with the tinfoil from the cigarette packs. [...] By selling their products for fifty cents each as fog remover for eyeglasses, the Skeltons were able to afford a hotel room every night as they worked their way to Harwich Port.|$|E
500|$|In North Carolina, Jerry Blanchard {{was indicted}} for {{threatening}} to kill Obama during a July 15, 2008 breakfast at a Waffle House. He allegedly called Obama the [...] "Antichrist" [...] at the breakfast, and made similar threats against Obama later at a hotel. Blanchard {{was placed in}} custody {{despite the fact that}} no evidence surfaced that he planned to go through with an assassination attempt. Later that same month in Florida, Raymond H. Geisel was charged with making threatening statements against Obama during a bail-bonds training class on July 31. Geisel also threatened to put a bullet in the head of then-President Bush, although Geisel later claimed <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>joking.</b> He was found to be in possession of ammunition, body armor, a combat-style hatchet, tear gas, a loaded 9mm handgun and four loaded magazines. Geisel said he collected firearms, and was only using the gun for his bail-bonds course. Geisel remained in custody for a month.|$|E
500|$|The Rhoads' letter created one of {{the first}} crises for James Beverley, newly {{appointed}} as the acting Governor of Puerto Rico. He said the letter was a [...] "confession of murder" [...] and [...] "a libel against the people of Puerto Rico", and ordered an investigation, one of his first acts. Beverley said of Rhoads that [...] "he was just a damned fool, ... a good doctor, but not very strong mentally on anything else." [...] Rhoads, already back in New York, released an official response to the media and the governor. He insisted that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>joking</b> in his letter, which was intended to be confidential, calling it a [...] "fantastic and playful composition written entirely for my own diversion and intended as a parody on supposed attitudes of some American minds in Porto Rico," [...] explaining that nothing [...] "was ever intended to mean other than the opposite of what was stated." [...] Rhoads offered to return to clear things up, but never did. The governor's inquiry concluded that Rhoads did not commit the acts included in his letter, nor any other crimes.|$|E

6000|$|She {{scarcely}} understood him; {{it seemed}} a question whether <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>joking</b> or not. Why should a man who struck her as having a great fund of reserve suddenly bring himself to be so confidential? This was his affair, however, and his confidences were interesting. [...] "I don't see why you should have renounced," [...] {{she said in a}} moment.|$|R

500|$|On February 8, 2015, at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards, West {{walked on}} stage as Beck was {{accepting}} his award for Album of the Year {{and then walked}} off stage, leaving the audience to think <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>joking.</b> After the awards show, West stated {{in an interview that}} he was not joking and that [...] "Beck needs to respect artistry, he should have given his award to Beyoncé". On February 26, 2015, he publicly apologized to Beck on Twitter. On August 30, 2015, West was presented with the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award at the MTV Video Music Awards. In his acceptance speech, he stated, [...] "Y'all might be thinking right now, 'I wonder did he smoke something before he came out here?' And the answer is: 'Yes, I rolled up a little something. I knocked the edge off.'" [...] At the end of his speech, he announced, [...] "I have decided in 2020 to run for president." [...] At the 2016 MTV Video Music Awards West was given four minutes to do [...] "whatever he wanted". He chose to debut his new music video for Fade, but first, delivered a speech in which he discussed recent shootings in Chicago, why he included Ray J and Donald Trump in his Famous video, the Taylor Swift situation, his love of Beyoncé and Steve Jobs amongst others.|$|E
500|$|As a commander, General Nansouty is {{reported}} to have been a man of spirit but also to have had an excessive inclination towards sarcasm, which was damaging to his reputation and made him a number of enemies. His few months spent in Spain in 1808, where he commanded the orderly officers of the Emperor and the aides-de-camp of the senior generals of the General Staff, seem to have acquired him an unwanted reputation for mockery on the service, to such a point that one of his subordinates reported that [...] "no one ever knew when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>joking</b> and when he was serious." [...] When it came to military matters though, Nansouty's posture became extremely imposing, concise and tough. A perfectionist, with a keen eye and impeccable knowledge of his arm, he was shocked whenever he saw his cavalry manoeuvres mishandled and then he became sarcastic, at times even insulting his subordinates. However, whenever he went too far with his reprimands, he was noticeably displeased with himself and remorseful, trying to offer reparation to the person he had insulted. This behaviour seems to have been recurrent. His mood seems to have been particularly bad during his last days of service, in 1814, after he had received a number of light wounds {{in a short period of}} time, and foremost, after he had fallen out with the Emperor. During this period, he severely mistreated one of his squadron commanders for not executing his order fast enough, and even sacked his chief of staff, Colonel de la Loyère, for a minor fault.|$|E
2500|$|In 1987, Thomas {{was asked}} if he agreed with Dennis Rodman's {{comments}} on Larry Bird, and reinforced that if Bird were black he [...] "would be just another good guy" [...] instead of being portrayed as the league's best player.

Berlusconi insisted that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>joking,</b> but accused Schulz and others to be [...] "bad-willing tourists of democracy". This incident caused a brief cooling of Italy's relationship with Germany.|$|E
2500|$|At the London Live Earth concert on July 7, 2007, {{which was}} {{broadcast}} {{live on the}} BBC, before introducing the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Rock called the crowd [...] "motherfuckers" [...] and [...] "shit" [...] after a brief sigh when he said <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>joking.</b> Due to the broadcast being at 5:45pm Rock was immediately cut off, and the BBC made several apologies for {{his use of the}} word [...] "motherfucker." ...|$|E
2500|$|At one {{performance}} in late 2006, a fan named Crystal Hoyt {{jumped on the}} stage and took over Hickerson’s microphone, thus becoming a member of the band until she parted ways with them in early 2011. Not long after Hoyt joined them, Toby Keith showed up at one of their original performances on [...] "The Billy Block Show" [...] at a club called 12th & Porter. When Billy Block told them that Toby Keith was there wanting to talk with them, they at first thought <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>joking.</b>|$|E
60|$|There hangs {{upon the}} wall of his modest {{apartment}} in New York a narrow, irregular photograph ingeniously framed, of himself standing side by side with a young German girl, who, in the estimation of his compatriots, is by no means stylish and only passably good-looking. When <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>joked</b> by his friends about the post of honor given to this production, and questioned as to the lady, he remains silent.

Anselmo commented on the YouTube video, writing: In an interview with Eddie Trunk on Sirius XM on December 15, 2016, Anselmo claimed he was being taunted throughout the show by [...] "two or three little hecklers" [...] who were standing near the stage. He stated that the hecklers called him all sorts of names throughout the show, {{and by the end}} he said he'd lost his patience. On the show Anselmo said, [...] "When people start screaming 'racist' {{over and over and over}} and over again at me, what I did was show them exactly what [...] the ugliest possible thing I could think of at the time was." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the third}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), in chapter [...] as Lot {{was sitting at}} the gate of Sodom in the evening, the two angels arrived, and Lot greeted them and bowed low to the ground. Lot invited the angels to spend the night at his house and bathe their feet, but they said that they would spend the night in the square. Lot urged them strongly, so they went to his house, and he {{prepared}} a feast for them and baked unleavened bread, and they ate. Before they had retired for the night, all the men of Sodom gathered about the house shouting to Lot to bring his visitors out so that they might be intimate with them. Lot went outside the entrance, shutting the door behind him, and begged the men of Sodom not commit such a wrong. Lot offered the men his two virgin daughters for them to do with as they pleased, if they would not do anything to his guests, but they disparaged Lot as one who had come as an alien and now sought to rule them, and they pressed threateningly against him and the door. But the visitors stretched out their hands and pulled Lot back into the house and shut the door and struck the people with blindness so that they were unable to find the entrance. The visitors directed Lot to bring what family he had out of the city, for they were about to destroy the place, because the outcry against its inhabitants had become so great. So Lot told his sons-in-law that they needed {{to get out of the}} place because God was about to destroy it, but Lot's sons-in-law thought that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>joking.</b> As dawn broke, the angels urged Lot to flee with his wife and two remaining daughters, but still he delayed. So out of God's mercy, the men seized Lot, his wife, and daughters by the hand and brought them out of the city, telling them to flee for their lives and not to stop or look back anywhere in the plain. But Lot asked them whether he might flee to a little village nearby. The third reading ( [...] , aliyah) ends here.|$|E
