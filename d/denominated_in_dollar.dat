50|$|The U.S. {{financial}} system was once closed, but the United States soon {{changed into a}} part of the interconnected global network. The international migration of saving funds redefined the global economic outlook and reshaped the structure.Since the 1980s, the international {{financial system}} has developed a new set of risk management techniques and new advanced financial instruments, and these efforts have led to various ways of success. Among them, asset securitization has been a great source of funding for the global financial revolution, which can significantly reduce the scope of global investment and split the stakes into a wide range of revenue sources. But the financial process of asset itself had a new problem. Asset securitization has allowed widespread funding to induce widespread changes in the economy, allowing widespread financing to take place, but it has spread to a huge problem if it suffers from itself. Asset securitization provided another major vulnerability to today's financial systems. The banks that lend loans do not cling to the danger of borrowers taking loans. The lender no longer needs to cling to compensate for its efforts to avoid danger in any case, as it is divided into the risk of loan. However, it is not only possible to talk about asset securitization as in black and white. If we ban asset securitization, the overall lending of the U.S. and the China will severely decline and the economy will shrink greatly.Since 1980, there has been a significant increase in global capital.Therefore, foreign investment in the United States has been increased. And it was good for U.S. The notion that the U.S. economy depends on foreign capital may sound dangerous. But the situation is not that serious. The savings fund is still based on the U.S. dollar, as its size is so large that only two kinds of the assets <b>denominated</b> <b>in</b> <b>dollar</b> and Euro assets are properly invested to cover the large amounts of capital. What European policymakers do not want to face the world's excessive saving funds is flowing in to Europe and it makes Euro more valuable. Because it means that Europe's product lower position in the world's market. The dollar is still an essential commodity for the commodity, currency, and derivatives of the world. The value of the dollar, which reflects inflation, is too high compared to other Asian currencies. It is necessary to implement coordinated efforts to resolve the exchange rate gap. But if the U.S. financial system fails to restore trust or if the Federal fails to respond to inflation expectations, the debate will end and the dollar will fall into turmoil.The Asian central bank will not deliberately carry out anything that could undermine the dollar as well as the sale of U.S. treasuries. That is because they are degrading the entire value of the enormous dollar they hold.The United States should maintain its position as an attractive target for investment, and its fiscal imbalances should be resolved quickly.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the interplay between}} individual borrowers’ choices for liability denomination and the optimal monetary policy. If the monetary authority cares about preventing bankruptcy and most liabilities are <b>denominated</b> <b>in</b> <b>dollars,</b> it will stabilize the exchange rate {{at the expense of}} higher volatility in the interest rate and vice-versa if most liabilities are <b>denominated</b> <b>in</b> local currency. That can generate multiplicity of equilibria in the liability composition. If an individual borrower expects the others to borrow <b>in</b> <b>dollars</b> (pesos) he or she will expect the monetary policy to be tailored for that liability denomina-tion and as a result would find it optimal to borrow <b>in</b> <b>dollars</b> (pesos) as well. If the monetary authority has a strong enough preference for exchange rate (interest rate) stability the equilibrium becomes unique with the liabilities <b>denominated</b> <b>in</b> <b>dollars</b> (pesos). ∗The authors are grateful to Roberto Chang, Federico Sturzenegger and seminar par-ticipants at the Original Sin Pre-Conference and Lacea 2002 for helpful comments.

50|$|Cash in {{the colonies}} was <b>denominated</b> <b>in</b> pounds, shillings, and pence.

40|$|A unique {{data set}} on the {{informal}} loan market in a coca-growing region of Bolivia is used to explore {{the hypothesis that the}} dollarization of this market is related to the coca industry.

40|$|It {{will not}} come as news to anyone that the US dominates the world {{economically}} and militarily. But the exact mechanisms by which American hegemony has been established and maintained are perhaps less well understood than they might be. One tool used to great effect has been the dollar, but its efficacy has recently been under threat since Europe introduced the euro. The dollar is the de facto world reserve currency: the US currency accounts for approximately two thirds of all official exchange reserves. More than four-fifths of all foreign exchange transactions and half of all world exports are <b>denominated</b> <b>in</b> <b>dollars.</b> <b>In</b> addition, all IMF loans are <b>denominated</b> <b>in</b> <b>dollars.</b> But the more dollars there are circulating outside the US, or invested by foreign owners in American assets, the more {{the rest of the}} world has had to provide the US with goods and services in exchange for these dollars.
