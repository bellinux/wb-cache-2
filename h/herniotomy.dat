40|$|Background: <b>Herniotomy</b> is {{a common}} {{operation}} done by pediatric surgeons. Recent {{studies have shown that}} high ligation in herniation in adult is not necessary, but this method was not fully evaluated in children. We compared non-ligation with high-ligation sac in <b>herniotomy</b> in terms of surgical complications and duration. Materials and Methods: This randomized controlled trial study was done on 104 children with inguinal hernia at Al-Zahra Hospital, Isfahan, Iran, between 2011 and 2013. Patients were equally randomized to undergo <b>herniotomy</b> with ligation of sac at the internal ring level or to undergo <b>herniotomy</b> without sac ligation. Patients were followed up just after the operation, and in the 1 st, 6 th, and 12 th weeks postoperation to discover early (scrotal hematoma, edema, wound infection, and postoperation fever) and late (adhesion and recurrence) complications. Also, duration of operation was recorded for each group. Results: The incidence of early complications (nine cases in high-ligation and eight cases in non-ligation group) was the same in both groups (P = 0. 402). No late complication was observed in any group. The mean duration of operation in high-ligation group (18. 84 ± 5. 47 min) was significantly shorter than non-ligation group (21. 46 ± 9. 03 min) (P < 0. 001). Conclusion: Complications are the same in <b>herniotomy</b> with or without ligation of the sac, but the duration of the non-ligation procedure is shorter than that of high-ligation.

30|$|Emergency {{laparotomy}} and diverting enterostomy for an intestinal perforation in ELBW infants {{are associated}} with a substantial risk of complications related to the stoma because of their extreme prematurity. The key factors associated with a successful abdominal surgery in ELBW infants include a less invasive procedure and better management of a stoma. Suturing for a stoma in the intestine requires a longer operation and meticulous technique to avoid penetration of the extremely thin bowel wall in ELBW. Cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive has been used to seal wounds in accident and emergency departments, and to cover surgical wounds in the eyes and during plastic surgery, including in the pediatric population (Farion et al. 2002; Singer and Thode 2004). In the field of pediatrics, there is a randomized controlled study that cyanoacrylate tissue adhesives is as alternative to subcuticular suture for pediatric <b>herniotomies</b> (Ong et al. 2002). Recently cyanoacrylate adhesives are applied to circumcision for boys (Voznesensky et al. 2015), to congenital cardiac surgery as skin adhesive and bronchopleural fistula in neonates (Vida et al. 2015; Saleemi et al. 2013).|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} suggests that virtual reality (VR) may supplement conventional training in laparoscopy. It may prove useful {{in the selection of}} surgical trainees in terms of their dexterity and spatial awareness skills in the near future. Current VR training solutions provide levels of realism and in some instances, haptic feedback, but they are cumbersome by being tethered and not ergonomically close to the actual surgical instruments for weight and freedom of use factors. In addition, they are expensive hence making them less accessible to departments than conventional box trainers. The box trainers in comparison, although more economical, lack tangible feedback and realism for handling delicate tissue structures. We have previously reported on the development of a modified digitally enhanced surgical instrument for laparoscopic training, named the Parkar Tool. This tool contains wireless accelerometer and gyroscopic sensors integrated into actual laparoscopic instruments. By design, it alleviates the need for both tethered and physically different shaped tools thereby enhancing the realism when performing surgical procedures. Additionally the software (Valhalla) has the ability to digitally record surgical motions, thereby enabling it to remotely capture surgical training data to analyse and objectively evaluate performance. We have adapted and further developed our initial single training tool method as used with a laparoscopic pyloromyotomy scenario, to an enhanced method using multiple Parkar wireless tools simultaneously, for use in several different case scenarios. This allows the use and measurement of right and left handed dexterity with the benefit of using several tasks of differing complexity. The development of a 3 D tissue-surface deformations solution written in OpenGL gives us several different virtual surgical training scenario approximations to use with the instruments. The trainee can start with learning simple tasks e. g. incising tissue, grasping, squeezing and stretching tissue, to more complex procedures such as suturing, <b>herniotomies,</b> bowel anastomoses, as well as the original pyloromyotomy as used in the first model...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Inguinal <b>herniotomy</b> is {{a common}} {{surgical}} procedure in Nigeria and may sometimes require hospital admission. In most low-income countries, bed spaces are inadequate and waiting lists for surgery long. We reviewed morbidity and mortality of <b>herniotomy</b> cases operated under inhalational anaesthesia and managed as day-cases in our hospital between 2004 and 2006. Materials and Methods: Relevant data was extracted from the medical records of all the children that had <b>herniotomy</b> surgery under inhalational anaesthesia in our hospital during the period. The data included the demography, side of swelling, post operative complications and time required for full recovery from anaesthesia. Results: A total of 181 patients were operated within the period, with a male to female ratio of 19. 1 : 1. The hernia was right sided in 138, (76. 2 %) and bilateral in 6. 1 %.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Bilateral surgery {{has been}} largely {{advocated}} in premature boys with unilateral inguinal hernia owing to {{the high incidence of}} contralateral patent processus vaginalis. Recently, the potential morbidity of <b>herniotomy</b> in low birth-weight babies and the progress in pediatric anesthesia questioned this attitude. This study aims to evaluate the incidence of contralateral metachronous hernia in a large series of premature boys and to compare the morbidity of preventive versus elective surgery. METHODS: This retrospective multicenter analysis of 964 premature boys presenting with unilateral inguinal hernia operated from 1998 to 2012 included 557 infants who benefited from a unilateral <b>herniotomy</b> and 407 from a bilateral <b>herniotomy</b> (median follow-up 12 months). RESULTS: Contralateral metachronous hernia after unilateral surgery occurred in 11 % (n= 60) without significant difference according to the initial symptomatic side (9. 5 % on right vs 13 % on left, p> 0. 05). Postoperative morbidity on the contralateral side was higher after preventive surgery than elective surgery with metachronous hernia (2. 45 % versus 0. 9 %, p= 0. 05) especially for secondary cryptorchidism (1 % vs 0 %, p= 0. 03). Despite the risk of metachronous incarcerated hernia, elective surgery did not increase the rate of testicular hypotrophy on the opposite side (0. 7 %, vs 0. 7 %, p> 0. 05). CONCLUSION: Systematic bilateral <b>herniotomy</b> is unnecessary in almost 90 % of patients and has a significant morbidity. Secondary surgery for metachronous hernia does not increase the risk of testicular lesion and even reduces the risk of secondary cryptorchidism. These results, along with the risk of hypofertility reported after bilateral surgery, may justify treating only the symptomatic side in premature boys...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: There is {{currently}} no consensus about closing or otherwise of the spermatic fascia at <b>herniotomy</b> in children. This stems {{from lack of}} evidence to justify either stand, and most literatures are silent on this. This study {{is an effort to}} evaluate the place of closure of the spermatic fascia at hernia repair. Aim: To determine if there is advantage in closing the spermatic fascia over leaving it open during <b>herniotomy</b> in children. Materials and Methods: Cases of inguinoscrotal hernia repaired by the same surgeon between July 2009 and June 2011 were randomly grouped into two; spermatic fascia closed (SC) and spermatic fascia open (SO) groups. They were assessed for operation duration, wound infection, scrotal hematoma, and scrotal edema post repair. The Data obtained was collated and analyzed using the SPSS 17. 0. Results: Seventy-six male children with unilateral complete inguinoscrotal hernia were included in this study. The overall mean duration of operation was 32. 9 min (SD = 5. 7); range 21 - 52 min. There was hematoma formation in 7 (17. 9 %) of the SC group and 9 (24. 3 %) of the SO group (P = 0. 5). Scrotal edema occurred in 24 (64. 8 %) of the SO and 18 (46. 2 %) of the SC group (P = 0. 3).

Before The Introduction Of This Policy (In The First Five Years), 39 % Of Incarcerated Cases Resulted In Emergency Operation. In 1985, After Its Introduction, No Emergency Surgery Was Required. The Move Towards More Vigorous Attempts At Reduction Allowing Surgery To Be Done Electively Was Supported By Two Observations. First, The Complication Rate Of Emergency <b>Herniotomy</b> (25. 6 %) Was Higher Than That Of Elective <b>Herniotomy</b> (6. 5 %). Second, In 43 Emergency Herniotomies, Non-Viable Content (Ovary) Was Found Only Once. In Retrospect, Most Emergency Herniotomies Were Unnecessary. In General, Surgical Treatment Of The Patients In This Series Could Be Considered Satisfactory. However, Better Results Were Achieved By Experienced Surgeons, Particularly Those In Specialty Practice. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
