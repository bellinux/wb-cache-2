5|$|A few {{survivors}} from Damocles' group {{escaped from}} the city and went to Flamininus' camp. They suggested to Flamininus that, if <b>he</b> <b>moved</b> <b>his</b> camp closer to the city gates, the Argives would revolt against the Spartans.|$|E
5|$|Daurises, {{who seems}} to have had the largest army, {{initially}} took his army to the Hellespont. There, he systematically besieged and took the cities of Dardanus, Abydos, Percote, Lampsacus and Paesus, each in a single day according to Herodotus. However, when he heard that the Carians were revolting, <b>he</b> <b>moved</b> <b>his</b> army southwards to attempt to crush this new rebellion. This places the timing of the Carian revolt to early 497 BC.|$|E
5|$|His first {{business}} {{experience was}} in the bond department of Continental Illinois National Bank, where he worked days while attending the Booth School of Business MBA program at night. He then moved to BancOhio National Bank, a regional bank in Columbus, Ohio, that was acquired in 1984 by National City Bank. Corzine worked at BancOhio until 1975 when <b>he</b> <b>moved</b> <b>his</b> family to New Jersey and {{was hired as a}} bond trader for Goldman Sachs.|$|E

5|$|After {{meeting with}} Caine and Forte, White {{was taken to}} the grill {{restaurant}} at the Hyde Park Hotel. Forte was interested if White could transfer the Michelin stars from Harveys; White was open to this since Raymond Blanc had previously transferred two stars to Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons when <b>he</b> <b>moved</b> <b>his</b> restaurant from Summertown, Oxford. Following the agreement of Michelin, White left Harveys in July 1993; The Restaurant was opened at the Hyde Park Hotel less than two months later, on 14 September. The interior was decorated with paintings from White's own collection.|$|E
5|$|After the United States Army Corps of Engineers {{took over}} the Manhattan Project, it gave {{responsibility}} for the detailed design and construction of the reactors to DuPont. Wheeler {{became part of the}} DuPont design staff. He worked closely with its engineers, commuting between Chicago and Wilmington, Delaware, where DuPont had its headquarters. <b>He</b> <b>moved</b> <b>his</b> family to Wilmington in March 1943. DuPont's task was not just to build nuclear reactors, but an entire plutonium production complex at the Hanford Site in Washington. As work progressed, Wheeler relocated his family again in July 1944, this time to Richland, Washington, where he worked in the scientific buildings known as the 300 area.|$|E
5|$|Bakshi's frustrations {{with his}} failing {{marriage}} {{and the state of}} the planet further drove his need to animate. In 1959, <b>he</b> <b>moved</b> <b>his</b> desk to join the rest of the animators; after asking Rasinski for material to animate, he received layouts of two scenes: a hat floating on water and Deputy Dawg, the lead character of one of Terrytoons' syndicated television series, running. Despite threats of repercussion from the animators' union, Rasinski fought to keep Bakshi as a layout artist. Bakshi began to see Rasinski as a father figure; Rasinski, childless, was happy to serve as Bakshi's mentor.|$|E

5|$|Guiscard, however, {{had been}} {{informed}} of Alexios' arrival by his scouts {{and on the}} night of October 17, <b>he</b> <b>moved</b> <b>his</b> army from the peninsula to the mainland. Upon learning of Guiscard's move, Alexios revised his battle plan. He split his army into three divisions, with the left wing under the command of Gregory Pakourianos, the right wing under the command of Nikephoros Melissenos, and himself in command of the centre. Guiscard formed his battle line opposite Alexios's, with the right wing under the command of the Count of Giovinazzo, the left under Bohemond and Guiscard facing Alexios in the centre.|$|E
5|$|Inglis {{resumed his}} legal studies, {{completing}} them in 1920. He also became {{married to his}} fiancée, Agnes, and the couple had two children. Now a solicitor, <b>he</b> <b>moved</b> <b>his</b> young family to Timaru and established a legal practice there. He remained involved with the Territorial Force, and in 1926 was commander of 1st Battalion, Canterbury Regiment, with the rank of lieutenant colonel. Promoted to colonel in 1931, he commanded 3rd New Zealand Infantry Brigade before retiring from the Territorial Force in 1936. As a long serving member of the territorials, {{he was awarded the}} Efficiency Decoration. In 1935, he was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal.|$|E
5|$|Linnaeus felt Uppsala was {{too noisy}} and unhealthy, so he bought two farms in 1758: Hammarby and Sävja. The next year, {{he bought a}} {{neighbouring}} farm, Edeby. He spent the summers with his family at Hammarby; initially it only had a small one-storey house, but in 1762 a new, larger main building was added. In Hammarby, Linnaeus made a garden where he could grow plants {{that could not be}} grown in the Botanical Garden in Uppsala. He began constructing a museum on a hill behind Hammarby in 1766, where <b>he</b> <b>moved</b> <b>his</b> library and collection of plants. A fire that destroyed about one third of Uppsala and had threatened his residence there necessitated the move.|$|E

5|$|On December 12, 1980, McLaughlin {{was traded}} to the Minnesota Twins in {{exchange}} for Willie Norwood. McLaughlin played with the Twins during spring training in 1981. However, on March 31, Minnesota released him. In the 1981 and 1982 seasons, McLaughlin played in the Mexican League. <b>He</b> <b>moved</b> <b>his</b> primary residence to Hermosillo during his two-year stint in Mexico. In August 1982, he joined the Spokane Indians, who were Triple-A affiliates of the California Angels at the time. With the Indians that season, McLaughlin went 1–0 with a 1.26 ERA, and nine strikeouts in six games, one of which was a start.|$|E
5|$|Within a few months, Ueshiba {{was back}} in Ayabe, having {{decided to become a}} {{full-time}} student of Ōmoto-kyō. In 1920 <b>he</b> <b>moved</b> <b>his</b> entire family, including his mother, to the Ōmoto compound; {{at the same time he}} also purchased enough rice to feed himself and his family for several years. That same year, Deguchi asked Ueshiba to become the group's martial arts instructor, and a dojo—the first of several that Ueshiba was to lead—was constructed on the centre's grounds. Ueshiba also taught Takeda's Daitō-ryū in neighbouring Hyōgo Prefecture during this period. His second son, Kuniharu, was born in 1920 in Ayabe, but died from illness the same year, along with three-year-old Takemori.|$|E
5|$|After {{turning down}} offers from IBM and the Brookhaven National Laboratory, Segrè {{returned}} to Berkeley in 1952. <b>He</b> <b>moved</b> <b>his</b> family from Berkeley to nearby Lafayette, California, in 1955. Working with Chamberlain and others, he began {{searching for the}} antiproton, a subatomic antiparticle of the proton. The antiparticle of the electron, the positron had been predicted by Paul Dirac in 1931 and then discovered by Carl D. Anderson in 1932. By analogy, it was now expected {{that there would be}} an antiparticle corresponding to the proton, but no one had found one, and even in 1955 some scientists doubted that they existed. Using Lawrence's Bevatron set to 6GeV, they managed to detect conclusive evidence of antiprotons. Chamberlain and Segrè were awarded the 1959 Nobel Prize in Physics for their discovery. This was controversial, because Clyde Wiegand and Thomas Ypsilantis were co-authors of the same article, but did not share the prize.|$|E

5|$|Business {{and family}} {{commitments}} kept Rush busy {{for the next}} few years. <b>He</b> <b>moved</b> <b>his</b> home up-river from Maclean to Grafton, the effective 'capital' of the Clarence River district. Rush purchased a hotel and an adjacent store, and a riverside villa which he named 'Clarence House'. Rush took an active part in a great many community and sporting organisations. He was a founder of the Grafton Rowing Club and was several times an office-holder of the Clarence River Jockey Club. He continued to promote and take part in local regattas. One of these was the Clarence River Aquatic Carnival, held on 10 March 1883. The Carnival attracted thousands of spectators. The main event was Rush vs Laycock for a stake of £1000 and the Championship of Australia, which Laycock won convincingly. At a banquet later that week, Rush announced his retirement from professional sculling, but in December of that year, he rowed Trickett on the Parramatta River for a stake of £400, and lost convincingly. The newspapers praised Rush for his valour, but hinted that it was high time he retired.|$|E
5|$|In August 1868 Parry and {{his family}} arrived in England, where he began a three-year study at the Royal Academy of Music under William Sterndale Bennett and Manuel Garcia. During his last year of study at the Royal Academy, Parry {{appeared}} before Queen Victoria three times, each time by her special request. The Queen made another request of Parry each time he appeared: that he perform only works he had composed. In 1871, Bennett convinced Parry to enter University of Cambridge for a degree in music. While at Cambridge, Parry became the first Welshman to take both the MusB and MusD there. After earning his Bachelor's degree, Parry {{and his family}} returned to Danville, where he operated a school of music {{for the next three}} years. When Aberystwyth University established a chair for music, it was offered to Parry; <b>he</b> <b>moved</b> <b>his</b> family back to Wales, becoming the university's first Professor of Music.|$|E
5|$|Jo Elizabeth Stafford {{was born}} in Coalinga, California, in 1917, to Grover Cleveland Stafford and Anna Stafford (née York)a second cousin of World War I hero Sergeant Alvin York. She was the third of four children. Both her parents enjoyed singing and sharing music with their family. Stafford's father hoped {{for success in the}} California oil fields when <b>he</b> <b>moved</b> <b>his</b> family from Gainesboro, Tennessee, but worked in a {{succession}} of unrelated jobs. Her mother was an accomplished banjo player, playing and singing many of the folk songs which influenced Stafford's later career. Anna insisted that her children should take piano lessons, but Jo was the only one among her sisters who took a keen interest in it, and through this she learned to read music.|$|E

5|$|MacArthur's {{primary concern}} was the capture of the port of Manila and the airbase at Clark Field, which were {{required}} to support future operations. He urged his commanders on. On 25 January 1945, <b>he</b> <b>moved</b> <b>his</b> advanced headquarters forward to Hacienda Luisita, closer to the front than Krueger's. He ordered the 1st Cavalry Division to conduct a rapid advance on Manila. It reached the northern outskirts of Manila on 3 February, but, unknown to the Americans, Rear Admiral Sanji Iwabuchi had decided to defend Manila to the death. The Battle of Manila raged {{for the next three}} weeks. To spare the civilian population, MacArthur prohibited the use of air strikes, but thousands of civilians died in the crossfire or Japanese massacres. He also refused to restrict the traffic of civilians who clogged the roads in and out of Manila, placing humanitarian concerns above military ones except in emergencies. For his part in the capture of Manila, MacArthur was awarded his third Distinguished Service Cross.|$|E
5|$|Ralambo's many {{enduring}} {{and significant}} {{political and cultural}} achievements of his reign have earned him a heroic and near mythical status among the greatest ancient sovereigns of Merina history. Ralambo {{was the first to}} assign the name of Imerina ("Land of the Merina people") to the central highland territories where he ruled. <b>He</b> <b>moved</b> <b>his</b> capital from Alasora to Ambohidrabiby, location of the former capital of his maternal grandfather King Rabiby. The first sub-divisions of the andriana noble caste were created when Ralambo split it into four ranks. He introduced the traditions of circumcision and family intermarriage (such as between parent and step-child, or between half-siblings) among Merina nobles, these practices having already existed among certain other Malagasy ethnic groups. The practice of sanctifying deceased Merina sovereigns is also believed to have originated with this king.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{discharge}} from the NZEF, Hart resumed legal work in his Carterton practice. However, within a few months, <b>he</b> <b>moved</b> <b>his</b> family to Masterton and established a new law firm. He became involved with the charity organisation Rotary International {{and set up the}} Masterton chapter of Rotary in 1925. He maintained an association with the military; after an initial spell in the reserve of officers, he resumed his involvement with the Territorial Force and served as commander of the 2nd (Wellington) Infantry Brigade for several years. He was eventually returned to the reserve of officers in 1925. To acknowledge his long military career, he was awarded the Colonial Auxiliary Forces Officers' Decoration (VD) and appointed honorary colonel of his old Territorial Force unit, the Hawkes' Bay Regiment (formerly 17th (Ruahine) Regiment). He retired from the military in 1930.|$|E
