5|$|David is revived {{and walks}} to the frozen Fairy statue, which collapses when he touches it. The Mecha use David’s {{memories}} to reconstruct the Swinton home and explain to him that they cannot make him human. However, David insists that they recreate Monica from DNA <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> of hair. The Mecha warn David that the clone can only live for a day, and that the process cannot be repeated. David spends the next day with Monica and Teddy. Before she drifts off to sleep, Monica tells David she has always loved him. Teddy climbs onto the bed and watches the two lie peacefully together.|$|E
5|$|The canal was a centre for boatbuilding between 1858, when Richard Dunston {{moved his}} yard to Thorne from Torksey, and 1984 when the yard closed. Dunston's company were pioneers {{in the use}} of welded {{construction}} and innovative tug propulsion systems. The operation was always restricted by the size of Keadby Lock, although vessels longer than the lock could pass through when the river was level with the canal and both sets of gates could be opened. The largest ship to be built required Dunston's to build a dam across the canal, as the canal company feared that it might get stuck <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lock,</b> resulting in flooding and draining of the canal.|$|E
5|$|A railway from Grantham to Sleaford {{opened in}} 1857. This was {{extended}} to Boston in 1859, and so offered direct competition to the navigation. The decline was rapid. Income fell from £981 in 1858 to £168 in 1868, and the share price dropped from £40 to £10 between 1860 and 1863. The company was trading at a loss by 1871, and although an Act of Abandonment was obtained on 17 June 1878, the navigation did not actually close until 14 May 1881, which was also {{the date of the}} final meeting of the proprietors. The Act required the company to fill in the three locks nearest to Sleaford, but there were special provisions for the remaining structures. The next three were on a stretch of river bordered by land belonging to Haverholme Priory, and were to be put into good order and handed over to Murray Finch Hatton, earl of Winchilsea & Nottingham, who owned the Priory. He could then maintain or abandon them, but was required to construct sluices if he chose to abandon them. The final lock was to be handed over to the commissioners of the River Witham, once it was in good order, and they could remove the gates and fill <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> if they chose to do so.|$|E

25|$|The 1828 design {{originally}} {{filled the}} lock chamber {{through the use}} of culverts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> masonry. The wicket, i.e. large paddle valve, hidden in the masonry recess where the upper gate fit in, would be opened, and water would flow through the lock masonry to three openings <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> chamber. Both sides of the lock had these, so there would be a total of 2 wickets, and 6 openings. The upper gate is above the breast wall. Most of the wicket openings in the upper gate recess have been closed with masonry, but one wicket at Violettes Lock is still intact as of 2013 (see photo). Note that modern replacement gates in locks 1-23, have the wickets in the gates, since the original wickets <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> masonry are inoperable. This system of routing water through the masonry was abandoned due the tendency for debris to clog the opening.|$|E

30|$|The Godson- 3 B 1500 {{can use the}} {{mechanism}} of a cache <b>lock.</b> When <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> window is configured, the cache blocks that are located <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>locked</b> L 3 cache space cannot be replaced until they are updated manually. For computation-intensive applications, many data need to be accessed and computed multiple times. Cache missing brings numerous extra overheads, which notably influence the performance. It can be even more fatal, especially for platforms with a random cache replacement policy. <b>The</b> <b>lock</b> mechanism can keep frequently required data stored <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>locked</b> cache, which can greatly reduce the influence of cache missing for computation-intensive applications and enhance the application performance.|$|R
2500|$|On September 3, 1914, when Grahamona {{passed through}} <b>the</b> Oregon City <b>locks,</b> {{fortunately}} with little freight aboard, {{there was only}} 19 inches of water <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>locks,</b> and Grahamona drew 18 inches of water at the time. [...] The water {{was reported to have}} been at an unusually low level, which was compounded by the use of water to power the electric turbines at the power plant at Willamette Falls. [...] It was reported that some water would be diverted from the turbines to raise <b>the</b> level <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>locks</b> by 4 or 5 inches.|$|R
25|$|Having the wickets in the gates, {{particularly}} if the gates are above the breast wall, means that the water pouring in could swamp some boats <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lock.</b> Filling the lock through culverts eliminated that problem, as well as putting the lock gate below the breast wall.|$|E
25|$|On the Erie Canal, some loaded boats {{needed a}} swell {{to get out}} of the lock, {{particularly}} lumber boats, being top heavy, would list to one side and get stuck <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lock,</b> and needed a swell to get them out. Some lockkeepers would give a swell to anyone to help them on the way, but some would ask for money for the swell.|$|E
25|$|The 1830 design {{eliminated}} {{the use of}} culverts in the masonry, and the upper gate is below the breast wall. The advantage {{here is that the}} lock can fill faster with the wickets being in the gate, but will not swamp a boat <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> chamber. In the 1830 design locks, the upper and lower gates are both the same height. The majority of locks on the C canal are to this specification.|$|E

25|$|Locks 58-71 are {{composite}} locks. Because {{there was}} a scarcity of good building stone in the upper Potomac, they made those locks of rubble and undressed inferior stone. Since the stone was undressed, that made a rougher surface, so {{the interior of the}} lock had to be lined with wood so as not to damage the boats <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lock.</b> The wood sheathing had to be replaced from time to time. Originally kyanized wood was used.|$|E
25|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> back, {{as in many}} folding knives, a {{stop pin}} acting on the top (or behind) the blade {{prevents}} it from rotating clockwise. A hook on the tang of the blade engages with a hook on the rocker bar which prevents the blade rotating counter-clockwise. The rocker bar is held in position by a torsion bar. To release the knife the rocker bar is pushed downwards as indicated and pivots around the rocker pin, lifting the hook and freeing the blade.|$|E
25|$|If {{the lock}} were empty, the boat {{would have had}} to wait 5 to 10 minutes while the lock was filled. For a boat {{travelling}} upstream, the process is reversed; the boat enters the empty lock, and then the chamber is filled by opening a valve that allows water to enter the chamber from the upper level. The whole operation will usually take between 10 and 20 minutes, {{depending on the size of}} the lock and whether the water <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> was originally set at the boat's level.|$|E

30|$|The {{algorithm}} mainly {{discusses the}} multiplications of M-by-k_ 0 blockA and k_ 0 -by-N blockB. First, blockB is divided with dimensions of k_ 0 × n_ 0. The processor gives the blockB {{access to the}} L 3 cache with normal memory access instructions. At the same time, TransDMA is configured to preload the first m_ 0 -by-k_ 0 blockA to <b>the</b> <b>locked</b> L 3 cache. Then, blockB, which is stored at <b>the</b> <b>locked</b> L 3 cache, is successively multiplied by many m_ 0 -by-k_ 0 blockAs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>locked</b> L 3 cache. The outer-loop is responsible for data transfer of blockA and blockB from the memory to <b>the</b> <b>locked</b> L 3 cache. The middle-loop performs an average distribution of blockB <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>locked</b> L 3 cache to four threads <b>in</b> <b>the</b> node. Each thread calculates the corresponding k_ 0 -by-(n_ 0 / 4) blockB.|$|R
25|$|On horse-drawn and mule-drawn canals, {{snubbing}} posts {{were used}} to slow or stop a boat <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lock.</b> A 200-ton boat moving at a few miles an hour could destroy the lock gate. To prevent this, a rope was wound around the snubbing post as the boat entered the lock. Pulling on the rope slowed the boat, due to the friction of the rope against the post. A rope 2½ inches (6.3cm) in diameter and about 60 feet (18 meters) long was typically used on the Erie Canal to snub a boat in a lock.|$|E
25|$|Locks were {{typically}} 100 feet long, 15 feet wide, and 16 feet deep, and the lifts averaged about 8 feet (between 6 and 10). Inside {{dimensions of the}} lock, for the boat, are over 90', for instance Lock 28 (Point of Rocks) is 90' 9", whereas typical freight boats were 92' long (including the rudder), making it necessary to turn the rudder to the side to fit <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lock.</b> Lock 36, however, was known among boatmen for being troublesome, since it had a usable length of 89 feet 11 inches, being the only lock less than 90 feet in length. Locks were often whitewashed to facilitate low light (i.e., at dawn or dusk) visibility.|$|E

30|$|They {{concluded}} that the maximal subsidence found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> specimens was mainly reversible or elastic and depended on the fixation technique with <b>the</b> <b>locked</b> plate group having a significantly higher maximal subsidence. The amount of irreversible or plastic deformation did not differ between the two fixation methods. The authors felt that this difference was {{due to a lack}} of interfragmentary compression <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>locked</b> plate group. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>locked</b> plate group <b>the</b> meta-diaphyseal gap remained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> specimens. The authors also stated that the higher amount of reversible motion may be desirable because this micromotion may enhance fracture callus formation. It was {{concluded that}} <b>the</b> <b>locked</b> plates had similar amounts of plastic deformation compared to a dual plating construct with less soft tissue stripping and therefore might be a better construct <b>in</b> <b>the</b> treatment of these complex fractures.|$|R

25|$|The {{first public}} police {{telephones}} in Britain {{were introduced in}} Glasgow in 1891. These tall, hexagonal, cast-iron boxes were painted red and had large gas lanterns fixed to the roof, {{as well as a}} mechanism which enabled the central police station to light the lanterns as signals to police officers in the vicinity to call the station for instructions. As with Chicago's boxes, the original intent was that trusted members of the public would be allowed access to the telephone in case of emergency using a special key that was registered to them, which would remain trapped <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> until released by a master key carried by a policeman. A newer, rectangular type of cast-iron police box was introduced in Glasgow in 1912, but with the signal light now powered by electricity rather than gas, and access to the telephone now restricted solely to the police.|$|E

Twenty-five shots had been fired, mostly at close range. In what order the family was killed is not known. A telephone was lying on one of the kitchen surfaces with its receiver off the hook, next to several [...]22 shells.

500|$|The {{most notable}} {{omissions}} {{from the team}} were Dan Carter, Richard Loe, and Reuben Thorne.
