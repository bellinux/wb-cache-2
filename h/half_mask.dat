The divers swim with a <b>half</b> <b>mask</b> and fins and are supplied with air from an industrial low-pressure air compressor on the boat through plastic tubes. There is no reduction valve; the diver holds the hose end in his mouth with no demand valve or mouthpiece and allows excess air to spill out between the lips.|$|E

40|$|Background: In {{the work}} environment, {{apart from the}} noise, {{employees}} may be exposed to other harmful factors. Therefore, they wear hearing protectors and other personal protective equipment. The aim {{of the study was}} to determine whether simultaneous use of earmuffs and respiratory protective devices affects the attenuation of earmuffs. Material and Methods: The study was conducted in laboratory conditions using the subjective REAT (Real Ear Attenuation at Threshold) and objective MIRE (Microphone in Real Ear) methods. The REAT method was used to measure sound attenuation of earmuffs, while MIRE was used to determine changes in attenuation of earmuffs due to the use of other personal protective equipment. Results: The study showed reduction in attenuation of earmuffs due to the use of a full face mask up to 20 dB. Using a full face mask causes that attenuation of earmuffs in the low frequency range is close to zero. Reduction in attenuation due to the use of <b>half</b> <b>masks</b> for complete with particle filters (<b>half</b> <b>masks)</b> is 3 – 15 dB. Simultaneous use of earmuffs and filtering <b>half</b> <b>masks</b> makes small changes in attenuation not exceeding 3 dB. Conclusions: The study showed that full face masks give the greatest reduction in attenuation of earmuffs. On the other hand, the least reduction is observed in the case of filtering <b>half</b> <b>masks.</b> There is a significant difference between the reduction in attenuation of earmuffs worn with <b>half</b> <b>masks</b> for complete with particle filters because they may be equipped with different kind of the head strap.

25|$|A diving mask (also <b>half</b> <b>mask,</b> {{dive mask}} or scuba mask) is {{an item of}} diving {{equipment}} that allows underwater divers, including, scuba divers, free-divers, and snorkelers to see clearly underwater. Surface supplied divers usually use a full face mask or diving helmet, but in some systems the <b>half</b> <b>mask</b> may be used. When the human eye is {{in direct contact with}} water as opposed to air, its normal environment, light entering the eye is refracted by a different angle and the eye is unable to focus the light. By providing an air space in front of the eyes, light enters normally and the eye is able to focus correctly.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{improvement}} in diver safety provided by the more secure attachment of the breathing apparatus to the diver's face, some models of full face mask can fail catastrophically if the faceplate is broken or detached from the skirt, as there is then no way to breathe from the mask. This can be mitigated by carrying a standard secondary second stage, and preferably also a spare <b>half</b> <b>mask.</b>|$|E

25|$|Compressor diving is {{a method}} of surface-supplied diving used in some {{tropical}} sea areas including the Philippines and the Caribbean. The divers swim with a <b>half</b> <b>mask</b> covering the eyes-and-nose and (often home-made) fins and are supplied air from the boat by plastic hoses from an industrial low-pressure air compressor of the type commonly used to supply jackhammers. There is no reduction valve; the diver holds the hose end in his mouth with no demand valve or mouthpiece. Excess air spills out through the lips.|$|E
25|$|Breathing from {{a demand}} valve is the {{fundamental}} and definitive skill of scuba diving, {{and it must be}} done correctly to make effective use of a limited air supply, and to avoid drowning. Most recreational scuba diving is done with a <b>half</b> <b>mask</b> and the demand valve is held in the mouth, gripped by the teeth, and sealed by the lips. The air is breathed through the mouth, and the diver must be able to seal off the nasal passages from the pharynx so that breathing remains possible with a flooded or dislodged mask.|$|E

2500|$|If the {{facepiece}} of the respirator is tight-fitting one (elastomeric quarter or <b>half</b> <b>masks,</b> filtering facepieces, or full-face masks), efficiency decreases due to leakage of unfiltered {{air through}} {{the gaps between}} the mask and face.

25|$|Most {{recreational}} {{scuba diving}} is done using a <b>half</b> <b>mask</b> which covers the diver's eyes and nose, and a mouthpiece {{to supply the}} breathing gas from the demand valve or rebreather. Inhaling from a regulator's mouthpiece becomes second nature very quickly. The other common arrangement is a full face mask which covers the eyes, nose and mouth, and often allows the diver to breathe through the nose. Professional scuba divers {{are more likely to}} use full face masks, which protect the diver's airway if the diver loses consciousness.|$|E
25|$|A {{full-face}} mask encloses both {{mouth and}} nose, which {{reduces the risk}} of the diver losing the air supply compared to a <b>half</b> <b>mask</b> and demand valve. Some models require a bailout block to provide alternative breathing gas supply from the umbilical and bailout cylinder, but are not suitable for accepting an alternative air supply from a rescue diver, while a few models accept a secondary demand valve which can be plugged into an accessory port (Draeger, Apeks and Ocean Reef). The unique Kirby Morgan 48 SuperMask has a removable DV pod which can be unclipped to allow the diver to breathe from a standard scuba demand valve with mouthpiece.|$|E
25|$|A <b>half</b> <b>mask</b> is not {{directly}} connected to the scuba air supply. the only available source of air to displace {{the water in the}} case of a leak or flood is through the diver's nose. The procedure involves exhaling through the nose into the mask until the water has all been displaced by air. During this process, the air must be prevented from escaping at a high point, or the water will not be expelled. If the mask does not fit in such a way that this happens automatically, it must be sealed at the high point by the diver pressing it against the face.|$|E

25|$|Several {{types of}} {{full-face}} mask exist, and {{the procedure for}} clearing them depends on the construction. They will automatically drain through the exhaust port of the demand valve provided the water can get to it, {{but this is not}} always possible, and in models which use an internal mouthpiece, the procedure is the same as with a <b>half</b> <b>mask.</b> Models which use an oral/nasal internal seal will usually drain to the demand valve or an additional drain valve at a low point when the diver's face is roughly upright or face down, and these will clear during normal breathing for small leaks, and may be cleared of major flooding by using the purge button on the demand valve to fill the mask with air.|$|E
25|$|The {{methods of}} {{clearing}} differ between the <b>half</b> <b>mask,</b> which covers {{the eyes and}} nose, and the full-face mask, which also covers the mouth. If the mask has a purge valve and the strap tension is correct, the diver holds the head so that the valve is at the lowest point and exhales through the nose. If the mask is a good fit on the diver's face and the strap is correctly placed, exhaling through the nose will usually drive water out along the bottom edge of the skirt. It {{may be necessary to}} press {{the upper part of the}} mask against the face to improve the seal if the diver is rolled to one side. If the fit is not perfect, or the strap is too low, contact pressure of the top edge against the forehead may be insufficient to maintain a seal when the head is upright.|$|E
25|$|These studies gave {{information}} about the real effectiveness of respiratory protective equipment; of their unreliability, and studies have shown some circumstances affect and may affect {{the effectiveness of the}} protection. Biomonitoring revealed the final result of the use of respirators - real, actual reduction of harmful substances entering the body. The studies have become the basis for the development of national legislation in the developed countries, which governs the selection and organization of the use of respirators by the employer. Specifically, as the lowest values of protection factors of constant wear <b>half</b> <b>mask</b> reaching 1.6 (and reaches 1, when unstable worn), it shall not be used when the air pollution exceeds 10 PEL in the US. And as the lowest values of protection factors of constant wear full face mask reaching 11, it shall not be used when the air pollution exceeds 40 OEL in the UK.|$|E

500|$|In {{the primary}} {{continuity}} of the comic books comprising the Marvel Universe, college-student Gwen Stacy was the girlfriend of Peter Parker, whom she was unaware was also Spider-Man. This primary version of Gwen Stacy was killed in The Amazing Spider-Man #121 (June 1973). The concept of an alternate-universe, spider-powered Gwen Stacy was first conceptualized by longtime Spider-Man writer Dan Slott for the [...] "Spider-Verse" [...] story arc across multiple series. Slott had suggested [...] "Gwen Stacy as a Spider-Woman" [...] to Spider-Man editor Nick Lowe, who then approached Jason Latour to write a series based on that character. Latour was concerned about restoring Gwen Stacy to life in even an alternate-universe form, given the canonical consequences of her death more than 40 years earlier, but eventually conceded, and approached Robbi Rodriguez to design the character. Latour prompted Rodriguez to keep her mysterious and to avoid anything that would prematurely reveal her identity, saying that she [...] "should feel like anyone could be under that mask." [...] Slott previously had envisioned a costume based on her clothing in the two-part death story, [...] "The Night Gwen Stacy Died" [...] (1973), except red and blue with web patterns and a <b>half</b> <b>mask.</b> She would also have had a trench coat {{that would have been}} red with webs.
