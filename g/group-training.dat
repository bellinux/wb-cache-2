The paper shows that the principle significantly improves important properties of education systems and harmonizes them with fundamental factors of trainees’ memory...|$|E
40|$|Here {{we present}} a {{collection}} of advanced data-mining techniques that allows the semantics of individual concepts to be decoded from single trials of EEG data. Neural activity was recorded while participants silently named images of mammals and tools, and category could be detected in single trials with an accuracy well above chance, both when considering data from single participants, and when <b>group-training</b> across participants. The pattern of classiﬁcations made by the algorithm conﬁrmed that the neural patterns identiﬁed are due to conceptual category, and not any {{of a series of}} processing-related confounds. The time intervals, frequency bands and scalp locations that proved most informative for prediction permit physiological interpretation: the widespread activation shortly after appearance of the stimulus (from 100 ms) is consistent both with accounts of multi-pass processing, and distributed representations of categories. These methods provide a new alternative to fMRI for ﬁne-grained investigations of the conceptual lexicon...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} which kind of physical activity could be useful to inmate populations to improve their health status and fitness levels. A repeated measure design was used to evaluate the effects of two different training protocols on subjects in a state of detention, tested pre- and post-experimental protocol. Seventy-five male subjects were enrolled in the studyand randomly allocated to three groups: the cardiovascular plus resistance training protocol group (CRT) (n = 25; mean age 30. 9 ± 8. 9 years),the high-intensity strength training protocol group (HIST) (n = 25; mean age 33. 9 ± 6. 8 years), and a control group (C) (n = 25; mean age 32. 9 ± 8. 9 years) receiving no treatment. All subjects underwent a clinical assessmentandfitness tests. MANOVA revealed significant multivariate effects on group (p < 0. 01) and <b>group-training</b> interaction (p < 0. 05). CRT protocol resulted the most effective protocol to reach the best outcome in fitness tests. Both CRT and HIST protocols produced significant gains in the functional capacity (cardio-respiratory capacity and cardiovascular disease risk decrease) o...|$|E
40|$|In the {{experiments}} reported {{here we have}} developed a new <b>group-training</b> protocol for assessing long-term memory for habituation in Caenorhabditis elegans. We have replicated {{all of the major}} findings of the original single-worm protocol using the new protocol: (1) distributed training produced long-term retention of training, massed training did not; (2) distributed training at long interstimulus intervals (ISIs) produced long-term retention, short ISIs did not; and (3) long-term memory for distributed training is protein synthesis-dependent as it could be blocked by heat shock during the inter-block interval. In addition, we have shown that long-term memory for habituation is graded, depending on the number of blocks of stimuli in training. The inter-block interval must be > 40 min for long-term retention of training to occur. Finally, we have tested long-term memory for habituation training in a strain of worms with a mutation in a vesicular glutamate transporter in the sensory neurons that transduce tap (eat- 4). The results from these eat- 4 worms indicate that glutamate release from the sensory neurons has {{an important role in the}} formation of long-term memory for habituation...|$|E
40|$|Achieving {{a clearer}} picture of categorial distinctions in the brain is {{essential}} for our understanding of the conceptual lexicon, but much more fine-grained investigations are required in order for this evidence to contribute to lexical research. Here we present a collection of advanced data-mining techniques that allows the category of individual concepts to be decoded from single trials of EEG data. Neural activity was recorded while participants silently named images of mammals and tools, and category could be detected in single trials with an accuracy well above chance, both when considering data from single participants, and when <b>group-training</b> across participants. By aggregating across all trials, single concepts could be correctly assigned to their category with an accuracy of 98 %. The pattern of classifications made by the algorithm confirmed that the neural patterns identified are due to conceptual category, and not any of a series of processing-related confounds. The time intervals, frequency bands and scalp locations that proved most informative for prediction permit physiological interpretation: the widespread activation shortly after appearance of the stimulus (from 100. ms) is consistent both with accounts of multi-pass processing, and distributed representations of categories. These methods provide an alternative to fMRI for fine-grained, large-scale investigations of the conceptual lexicon. © 2010 Elsevier Inc...|$|E

40|$|Background and objectives: Anxiety and Depressive {{disorders}} {{represent an}} important public health problem, which involves {{not only the}} mental health services, but the General Practice as well. This paper examines models of Collaboration between General Practice and Community Mental Health Services developed in Italy. Methods: Different Consultation -Liaison activities are presented. For every Collaboration model advantages and disadvantage are discussed. Results: The structured Consultation Liaison Service is based on supplying diagnostic consultation and therapeutic interventions in support of General Practitioners (GPs). The service could be based in either a Community Mental Health Centre (CMHC) or externally. Diagnostic evaluation can be followed by brief and focal therapeutic interventions, {{in support of the}} GP's therapeutic plan. The spontaneous collaboration in small centres are frequent in rural areas where the contained dimensions of the services and the direct acquaintance between psychiatrists and GPs encourage the personalization of the collaboration. The model of Liaison and <b>Group-Training</b> focuses on direct contact between consultant and GPs. In the course of regular meetings, the consultant gives the GPs supervision and education, and they can discuss the therapeutic plans for patients requiring specialist intervention. Conclusion: The empiric classification presented should be considered an attempt to represent a complex reality. Every service, in fact, carries out activities that are necessarily wider than abstract typologies and that overlap with other models' activities...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{explore the}} role of online {{communities}} {{from the perspective of}} breast cancer survivors who are facilitators of face-to-face support groups. Methods: Seventy-three attendees (73 % response rate) of a Canadian support <b>group-training</b> program completed a questionnaire examining when and why they used online communities. A purposive sample of 12 respondents was interviewed on how they used them in comparison to traditional supportive care. Survey responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics, and interview transcripts using a descriptive interpretive approach. Results: Online communities were used by 31. 5 %, mostly during treatment (73. 9 %), daily or weekly (91. 3 %), primarily for information (91. 3 %) and symptom management (69. 6 %) and less for emotional support (47. 8 %). Reasons for non-use were lack of need (48. 0 %), self-efficacy (30. 0 %), trust (24. 0 %), and awareness (20. 0 %). Respondents used online communities to address unmet needs during periods of stress and uncertainty. A multi-theory framework helps to explain the conditions influencing their use. Conclusion: Online communities have the potential to fill gaps in supportive care by addressing the unmet needs of a subgroup of breast cancer survivors. Further research is required among typical cancer survivors. Practice implications: Online communities could play an important role as a supplemental resource for a sub-group of breast cancer survivors.

40|$|Employees with {{a chronic}} {{physical}} condition may be hampered in job performance due to physical or cognitive limitations, pain, fatigue, psychosocial barriers, or because medical treatment interferes with work. This study investigates {{the effect of}} a <b>group-training</b> program aimed at job maintenance. Essential elements of the program are exploration of work-related problems, communication at the workplace, and {{the development and implementation of}} solutions. Participants with chronic physical diseases were randomly assigned to the intervention (N= 64) or the control group (N= 58). Participants were eligible for the study if they had a chronic physical disease, paid employment, experienced work-related problems, and were not on long-term 100 % sick leave. Primary outcome measures were self-efficacy in solving work- and disease-related problems (14 - 70), job dissatisfaction (0 - 100), fatigue (20 - 140) and job maintenance measured at 4 -, 8 -, 12 - and 24 -month follow-up. We used GLM repeated measures for the analysis. After 24 months, loss to follow-up was 5. 7 % (7 / 122). Self-efficacy increased and fatigue decreased significantly more in the experimental than the control group [10 versus 4 points (P= 0. 000) and 19 versus 8 points (P= 0. 032), respectively]. Job satisfaction increased more in the experimental group but not significantly [6 versus 0 points (P= 0. 698) ]. Job maintenance was 87 % in the experimental and 91 % in the control group, which was not a significant difference. Many participants in the control group also undertook actions to solve work-related problems. Empowerment training increases self-efficacy and helps to reduce fatigue complaints, which in the long term could lead to more job maintenance. Better understanding of ways to deal with work-related problems is needed to develop more efficient support for employees with a chronic diseas...|$|E
40|$|Ankara : Faculty of Humanities and Letters and The Institute of Economics and Social Sciences of Bilkent University, 1993. Thesis (Master's) [...] Bilkent University, 1993. Includes bibliographical refences. It {{is common}} {{knowledge}} among composition researchers that different composition readers judge the same compositions differently due to certain reader variables. This controversial issue {{leads to a}} further problem, which is best termed as the reader reliability and unreliability dichotomy. While {{it is assumed that}} some ccatposition rater background characteristics influence reader reliability, few studies have investigated the relationships between rater background characteristics and reader reliability. This research study explored the relationships between composition teacher-rater background characteristics and reader reliability at the Eastern Mediterranean University Preparatory School in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. A background information questionnaire consisting of fourteen items was first developed, and then administered to 47 teacher-raters who had scored an EFL composition achievement test consisting of one prompt. The research participants scored a total number of 1191 student compositions. The arrangement of the scoring process was such that two teachers independently scored a subset of about 30 compositions using a twenty-point analytic scale. The researcher was also provided with the composition assessment record prior to the administration of the questionnaire. The two sets of scores cissigned to the compositions in each subset were correlated in order to identify the reliable and the xmreliable readers within pairs. At this point, the dependent reliability variable was created so that it could be regressed with the independent background characteristics variables. One of the 14 independent variables — participation in reader <b>group-training</b> sessions before scoring English composition examination papers — was excluded from the stxody, and the analysis was done with 13 independent variables. This variable was excluded because all of the raters' responses were "yes" to this background characteristic. The analysis did not yield any statistically significant relationships between the depaident variable and the independent variables group. Therefore, the alternative hypothesis stating that there are EFL canrposition teacher-rater background characteristics related to reader reliability was rejected, and the null hypothesis stating that there are no EFL corrposition teacher-rater background characteristics related to reader reliability had to be accepted. Only one rater out of the 47 raters was identified ëis unreliable. However, it is believed that factors other than background characteristics, such as fatigue, physical distractions, or subconscious rebellious behavior against the testing administrators affected his/her reading performance. This conclusion was supported by some collected data and insitu observations. Ağazade, Ali SıdkıM. S...|$|E
40|$|Heart failure (HF) is an {{increasing}} health care problem worldwide, and a multidisciplinary approach with a general practitioner (GP) {{in the health care}} team is considered optimal. HF management has improved substantially over the last two decades, mainly for patients with HF with a reduced ejection fraction. Earlier studies have shown that HF management in primary care is far from optimal, with under prescription of guideline recommended drug treatment. Secondly, most of these studies performed in primary care included patients with a GP’s diagnosis of HF, and thus in a substantial number without a confirmatory echocardiogram, thus more likely including many false-positive HF cases. Thirdly HF and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are both common in the elderly, and often coexist. Thirty primary-care practices (PCPs), including urban, suburban, and rural practices, located in the vicinity of Utrecht in {{the central part of the}} Netherlands participated in cluster randomized trial. The study was executed between November 2010 and March 2013. The 30 PCPs were allocated randomly to the intervention group or the care-as-usual (control) group. The GPs from the 15 PCPs allocated to the intervention group underwent a half-day <b>group-training</b> session on the diagnosis and drug treatment of HF based on recommendations of the most recent ESC HF guidelines. The primary outcome was the use of guideline-recommended HF medication in patients with HF at 6 months. Secondary outcomes were health status at 12 months and mortality and hospitalizations at 28 months. An expert panel composed of two cardiologists and a GP with expertise in HF determined the presence or absence of HF (definite HF, possibly HF, or no HF) of the 683 eligible patients. In total 17. 3 % patients had no HF according to the panel, and 19. 2 % persons possibly HF, leaving 434 with definite HF. A half-day training program of GPs does not improve HF drug prescriptions in patients with established HF. Around one out of six patients with a GP’s diagnosis of HF is misclassified, and such overdiagnosis brings the risk of inappropriate patient management. Two-hundredandthirty-sixpatients out of the 434 withestablishedHFwereinvitedforspirometry. And 106 participantswere able to undergo spirometry. Prescription of evidence-based HF drugs in patients with HFrEF did not change significantly between baseline and T 1 comparing the intervention and control group. There was no statistically significant or clinically important differences in the eight domains of the SF- 36 scale (Quality of life) between the intervention and control groups for patients with either HFrEF or HFpEF. Survival during 28 months did not significantly differ between the intervention and control groups for either HFrEF or HFpEF. A half-day training program of GPs does not improve HF drug prescriptions in patients with established HF. Around one out of six patients with a GP’s diagnosis of HF is misclassified, and such overdiagnosis brings the risk of inappropriate patient management. COPD is common inpatients with HF, both HFrEF and HFpEF, and remains undetected in the majority of patients...|$|E
