Once again Captain Wilkes was able to provide this necessity, but not before testing Captain Gale on his sailing and navigation skills.

500|$|Poltava {{was built}} by the Admiralty Shipyard at Saint Petersburg. She was laid down on 16 June 1909 and {{launched}} on 23 July 1911. At the end of October 1914 she was struck by her sister [...] which jammed her <b>kedge</b> <b>anchor,</b> damaged her hull and delayed her trials to late November 1914. She entered service on 30 December 1914 when she reached Helsinki and {{was assigned to the}} First Battleship Brigade of the Baltic Fleet. However, gunnery and torpedo trials had to be postponed until mid-1915 because of the thick winter ice. She was the only ship of the class to perform a full-power speed trial, which she did in November 1915. She played a passive part in World War I as her role was to prevent the Germans from breaking into the Gulf of Finland, something the Germans never even tried. She ran aground in June 1916, but suffered little damage. Her crew participated in the February Revolution of 1917. She, and most of the Baltic Fleet, evacuated Helsingfors between 12 and 17 March 1918 despite the winter ice in the Gulf of Finland. Due to a shortage of crew she was placed into long-term conservation at Petrograd in October 1918.|$|E
50|$|The {{outfitting}} of HMS Investigator {{in early}} 1801 {{prior to her}} departure from the United Kingdom for Terra Australis included five bower, two stream and two <b>kedge</b> <b>anchors.</b> An additional bower anchor was included in stores sent to Port Jackson.|$|R
50|$|As Master Commandant MacDonough {{awaited the}} arrival of the enemy, he dropped <b>kedge</b> <b>anchors</b> and {{arranged}} spring lines, which afforded his ships maximum maneuverability. He then had the crews practice turning their ships so that alternately starboard and port guns would face south.|$|R
50|$|Macdonough {{ordered the}} bow anchor cut, and hauled in the <b>kedge</b> <b>anchors</b> he had laid out earlier to spin Saratoga around. This allowed Saratoga to bring its {{undamaged}} port battery into action. Confiance {{was unable to}} return the fire. The frigate's surviving Lieutenant, James Robertson, tried to haul in on the springs to his only anchor to make a similar manoeuvre, but succeeded only in presenting the vulnerable stern to the American fire. Helpless, Confiance could only surrender. Macdonough hauled in further on his <b>kedge</b> <b>anchors</b> to bring his broadside to bear on HMS Linnet. Pring sent a boat to Confiance, to find that Downie was dead and the Confiance had struck its colours. The Linnet also could only surrender, after being battered almost into sinking. The British gunboats withdrew, unmolested.|$|R
2500|$|Operation Biting, between 2728 February (also {{known as}} the Bruneval Raid), {{targeted}} a German coastal radar installation atop [...] cliffs. The raiding party itself was dropped by parachute at night and following the raid was taken back to England by sea. The naval force under Commander F. N. Cook, Royal Australian Navy, departed earlier, during {{the afternoon of the}} 27th, for the journey across the Channel. Motor Gun Boats (MGBs) towed LCAs across the Channel (LCA crews manned their craft during such tows) and carried detachments from No. 12 Commando who would provide fire support for the raiding party when they reached the evacuation beach. To accomplish this task each LCA had sandbags laid down its decks as parapets for Boys anti-tank rifles and Bren guns fitted with high volume drum magazines. When close to the coast the commandos climbed into the LCAs, the crews cast off, and the craft made for the beach under their own power. Meanwhile, on land, having accomplished their objectives the airborne raiders withdrew through a gully in the cliffs to the evacuation beach. By this time, it was 02:15, a sea mist prevented the naval force from seeing paratrooper's signals to evacuate them. The raiders fired off an emergency Very light seen by three LCA crews who soon approached accompanied by three MGBs. The original plan for the operation had called for two LCAs to land on the beach at a time, but this had never been satisfactorily achieved during the training manoeuvres. Instead, as the other three LCAs caught up, all six landed at the same time. One, LCA 125, dropped its <b>kedge</b> <b>anchor</b> just prior to beaching, but the anchor line played out and ran off the drum. Troops in the landing craft opened fire on German troops gathering by the top of the cliff. With all the craft beached at once, and enemy fire causing considerable confusion on the beach, some LCAs left over-crowded, whilst others left half-empty. The coxswain of LCA 125 was able to reverse his engines quickly and prevent the craft from being stranded. The entire raiding force was taken off the beach and soon transferred to MGBs for more comfortable transport back to England. Communications had failed; the naval force had received no signals apart from the Very light, and had spent much of the time hiding from a German naval patrol that had nearly discovered them. The journey back to Britain was uneventful, with the MGBs, LCAs in tow, being escorted by four destroyers and a flight of Spitfires. This raid with its dramatic embarkation from the base of a cliff occupied by enemy soldiers demonstrated the need for deck armour on LCA. Production of new craft soon incorporated 1/4inch armour for the decks over the hold and the stoker's position.|$|E

500|$|For {{the next}} four months, Cook charted the coast of Australia, heading {{generally}} northward. Just before 11pm on 11 June 1770, the ship struck a reef, today called Endeavour Reef, within the Great Barrier Reef system. The sails were immediately taken down, a <b>kedging</b> <b>anchor</b> set and an unsuccessful {{attempt was made to}} drag the ship back to open water. The reef Endeavour had struck rose so steeply from the seabed that although the ship was hard aground, Cook measured depths up to [...] less than one ship's length away.|$|R
2500|$|Titanics rudder was so large—at [...] {{high and}} [...] long, {{weighing}} over 100 tons—that it required steering engines to move it. Two steam-powered steering engines were installed though only one was used {{at any one}} time, with the other one kept in reserve. They were connected to the short tiller through stiff springs, to isolate the steering engines from any shocks in heavy seas or during fast changes of direction. As a last resort, the tiller could be moved by ropes connected to two steam capstans. The capstans were also used to raise and lower the ship's five anchors (one port, one starboard, one in the centreline and two <b>kedging</b> <b>anchors).</b>|$|R
60|$|After a {{time the}} patron signalled, a small anchor plunged, the boat came alongside, and Kit helped a fresh crew to put the <b>kedge</b> <b>anchor</b> on board. To carry it ahead was easier than towing, but {{when they got back}} they must break out the other anchor and then heave Cayman up to the kedge. To heave by hand was fastest, and for a few minutes the row of men, singing hoarsely, {{strained}} and swung. Then the singing stopped, their bodies got upright and went no farther back. The veins stood out on their brown foreheads, but the rope would not come in. They hung on, tense and rigid, unwilling to own that they were beaten.|$|E
60|$|A {{few moments}} later the flare, burning low, {{scorched}} Grahame's fingers and he flung it over the rail. It fell with a hiss into the creek and bewildering darkness shut down. There was now no guide but the strain on the helm, and Grahame began {{to be afraid of}} breaking out the anchor. For a time the splash of oars continued, telling of the tense struggle that went on in the gloom, but it stopped suddenly and he knew the men were beaten. Ringing off the engines, he ran forward with a deckhand to drop the <b>kedge</b> <b>anchor.</b> It was heavy, an arm was foul of something, and they could not drag it clear, until a dim object appeared close by.|$|E
60|$|In {{the morning}} we had breakfast and were at work by daylight. I found a light <b>kedge</b> <b>anchor</b> in the fore-hold, where such things were kept; and with a deal of {{exertion}} got it on deck and into the boat. With a long running-line coiled down in the stem, I rowed well out into our little cove and dropped the anchor into the water. There was no wind, the tide was high, and the schooner floated. Casting off the shore-lines, I kedged her out by main strength (the windlass being broken), till she rode nearly up {{and down to the}} small anchor—too small to hold her in any breeze. So I lowered the big starboard anchor, giving plenty of slack; and by afternoon I was at work on the windlass.|$|E
60|$|Six large {{boxes were}} then passed {{up and put}} apart from the others. Then {{followed}} eight or ten coils of rope, a quantity of chain, some <b>kedge</b> <b>anchors,</b> a number of blocks, five rolls of canvas, and some heavy bags that, by the sound they made when they were laid down, Cyril judged to contain metal articles of some sort. Then the other goods were lowered into the hold and the hatches replaced. The work had scarcely concluded when the boat again came alongside, this time with four men on board. Scarcely a word was spoken as the goods were transferred to the boat.|$|R

5000|$|At this {{critical}} moment, Macdonough ordered the bow anchor cut, and he hauled in the <b>kedge</b> <b>anchors</b> he had laid out earlier to spin Saratoga around. This allowed Saratoga to bring its undamaged port battery into action. The British flagship withered {{in the face}} of the renewed American fire, with one shot smashing a gaping 7-foot hole in her hull below the waterline. The Confiance began to list badly to starboard. Below decks, crewman scrambled to move weight to the port side in hopes of keeping the damaged planking above water. Likewise, men scurried to move her already amassing wounded to prevent them from being drowned by the rising water. Mr. Cox, the ship's carpenter, was later praised for having [...] "drove in sixteen large shot plugs under the water line" [...] during the action. The vessel's surviving Lieutenant, James Robertson, tried to haul in on the springs to his only remaining anchor that hadn't been shot away to make a similar maneuver, but succeeded only in presenting the vulnerable stern to the American fire. Helpless, and now being raked by fresh broadsides from the American ship, Confiance could only surrender. She was forced to strike after a fierce two-hour-and-five-minute gun duel, during most of which she had been engaged with Macdonough's flagship. The last vestige of the British Squadron, HMS Linnet, itself barely a floating hulk, continued to fire defiantly for an additional fifteen minutes following the flagship's surrender. Macdonough simply hauled in further on his <b>kedge</b> <b>anchors</b> to bring his broadside to bear on the Linnet, which also could only surrender, after being pummeled almost to the point of sinking.|$|R
60|$|A light <b>kedge</b> <b>anchor</b> was dropped, and as {{this was}} done a patter of musketry broke out from the hill above them. Their action showed that {{the arrival of the}} {{brigantine}} was no matter of chance, but that she was there expressly with the intention of attacking the pirates' stronghold, and those who had been watching her, therefore, saw that any further attempt at concealment was useless. In the night the canvas band had been taken down, as there was no longer any reason for concealing the identity of the brigantine. The musketry fire only lasted for a minute, for suddenly a roar of battle broke out within a hundred yards of the mouth of the entrance. The sailors burst into a loud cheer. It was evident that the landing-party had met with complete success so far, and had approached the batteries unobserved, and that a hand-to-hand fight was going on.|$|E
60|$|It would {{obviously}} be useless {{to go back}} with rations that would barely suffice for the march: Vane still had food enough to keep life in one man for a little while. On the other hand, {{it would not be}} a long sail to Comox with a strong northerly wind; and if the sloop would face the sea that was running he might return with assistance before his comrade's scanty store was exhausted. Getting out the mildewed chart, he laid off his course, carefully trimmed and lighted the binnacle lamp, and going up on deck hauled in the <b>kedge</b> <b>anchor.</b> He could not break the main one out, though he worked savagely with a tackle, and deciding to slip it, he managed to lash three reefs in the mainsail and hoist it with the peak left down. Then he sat down to gather breath--for the work had been cruelly heavy--before he let the cable run and hoisted the jib.|$|E
60|$|According to a tradition, a bell {{had been}} once hung upon this rock by an abbot of Arbroath, {91a} ‘and being taken {{down by a}} sea-pirate, a year {{thereafter}} he perished upon the same rock, with ship and goods, in the righteous judgment of God.’ From {{the days of the}} abbot and the sea-pirate no man had set foot upon the Inchcape, save fishers from the neighbouring coast, or perhaps—for a moment, before the surges swallowed them—the unfortunate victims of shipwreck. The fishers approached the rock with an extreme timidity; but their harvest appears to have been great, and the adventure no more perilous than lucrative. In 1800, on the occasion of my grandfather’s first landing, and during the two or three hours which the ebb-tide and the smooth water allowed them to pass upon its shelves, his crew collected upwards of two hundredweight of old metal: pieces of a <b>kedge</b> <b>anchor</b> and a cabin stove, crowbars, a hinge and lock of a door, a ship’s marking-iron, a piece of a ship’s caboose, a soldier’s bayonet, a cannon ball, several pieces of money, a shoe-buckle, and the like.

50|$|Hull {{found himself}} becalmed, but he acted on a {{suggestion}} from Charles Morris. He ordered {{the crew to}} put boats over the side to tow the ship out of range, using <b>kedge</b> <b>anchors</b> to draw the ship forward and wetting the sails {{to take advantage of}} every breath of wind. The British ships soon imitated the tactic of kedging and remained in pursuit. The resulting 57-hour chase in the July heat forced the crew of Constitution to employ myriad tactics to outrun the squadron, finally pumping overboard 2300 gal of drinking water. Cannon fire was exchanged several times, though the British attempts fell short or overshot their mark, including an attempted broadside from Belvidera. On 19 July, Constitution pulled far enough ahead of the British that they abandoned the pursuit.|$|R
50|$|The {{steam engine}} offered the {{prospect}} of tactical advantage against sail-powered warships. In a calm, sailing ships depended on the manpower of their crews to tow the ship from the boats, or to <b>kedge</b> with <b>anchors.</b> Demologos, with steam, might have found it easy to outmaneuver a ship-of-the-line in calm weather.|$|R

60|$|The floe was {{bearing down}} on them, and in the distance, half hidden by the fog, a taller mass seemed to have {{stranded}} on the reef, for the spray was leaping about it {{and there was a}} great splash as a heavy block fell off. Moran glanced at the floe and ran forward. Jimmy joined him and they hurriedly got the chain cable in; then, with Bethune’s help, they reefed the mainsail and stowed the folding ladder and pumps below, but they had a struggle to lift the <b>kedge</b> <b>anchor.</b> It seemed to have fouled some waterlogged timber below; but they would not sacrifice it by slipping the warp, because they knew it might {{be a long time before}} they could come back. When they finally broke it out Bethune had already hoisted the mainsail. There was no time to lose, for the fog was getting thicker in spite of the rising wind, and a glimmering mass of ice had crept up threateningly close. Moreover, the light was going and the sea getting up. Hurriedly setting a small jib, they stood out for open sea.|$|E

Placed right in the fairway of two navigations, and one of these the entrance to the only harbour of refuge between the Downs and the Moray Firth, it breathed abroad along the whole coast an atmosphere of terror and perplexity; and no ship sailed that part of the North Sea at night, but what the ears of those on board would be strained to catch the roaring of the seas on the Bell Rock.|$|E
