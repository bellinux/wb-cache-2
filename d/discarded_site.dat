It {{has been a}} vital working waterway of Seattle for over 100 years. The Duwamish Waterway is the larger of two MIC's (manufacturing and industrial center) in Seattle and is a crucial job base for the region by employing more than 100, 000 people. The Duwamish Waterway is an interracial part in Seattle's economy by supporting commercial navigation, employment, and commerce.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Environmental Science) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007 The {{rehabilitation}} of degraded soils, {{such as those}} associated with post-mining sites, requires knowledge of the soil ecosystem and its physical, chemical, and biological composition in order for rehabilitation efforts to fulfil the long-term goal of reconstructing a stable ecosystem for rehabilitated mine soil. This study addresses the need for appropriate assessment criteria to determine the progress of rehabilitation and subsequently the success of management practices. Significant contributions made by this investigation included the establishment of minimum and maximum values for microbial community measurements from two case studies of rehabilitated coal <b>discard</b> <b>sites.</b> Furthermore, it was shown {{that there was no}} relationship between changes in microbial community function and structure and the rehabilitation age of the sites. Following this, the considerable impact of management practices on microbial communities was illustrated. The first part of the study investigated the temporal changes in microbial community function and structure in a chronosequence of rehabilitated coal <b>discard</b> <b>sites</b> aged 1 to 11 years. The most important observation made during the investigation of the microbial communities in the different aged soil covers of the rehabilitated coal <b>discard</b> <b>sites,</b> was that there was no relationship between rehabilitation age and microbial activity or abundance of certain microbial groups. What was responsible for a clear differentiation between sites and a shift in microbial community attributes was the management practices applied. A comparison of two chronosequences of rehabilitated coal <b>discard</b> <b>sites</b> was achieved by an application of the 'space-for-time' hypothesis. Sites of different ages and at separate locations ('space') were identified to obtain a chronosequence of ages ('time'). The two chronosequences included sites aged 1 to 11 years (chronosequence A) and 6 to 17 years (chronosequence B), respectively. Sites in the same chronosequence were managed identically, while there was a distinct difference in management practices applied to each chronosequence. The long-term effect of the different management regimes on the soil microbial community function and structure was investigated. Again, there was no relationship between rehabilitation age and microbial community measurements. Fluctuations of selected microbial properties occurred in both chronosequences and similar temporal trends existed over the rehabilitation periods. However, the less intensively managed chronosequence (8) seemed more stable (less fluctuation occurred) over the rehabilitation period than the more intensively managed chronosequence (A). It was therefore concluded that the microbial communities in the less managed sites maintained their functional and structural integrity within bounds in the absence of management inputs or disturbance. While there was similarity in the trends over time for individual microbial community measurements, the seemingly more stable conditions in chronosequence 6 are important in terms of the goal of rehabilitation.

40|$|Abstract. Microbial {{properties}} {{have been}} reported to be useful indicators of soil quality and could possibly serve as assessment criteria of successful rehabilitation of ecologically disturbed areas. During this study, the application value of microbial enumeration techniques and enzymatic assays as a measure of the progress of rehabilitation of coal <b>discard</b> <b>sites</b> was evaluated. Each site was analysed for physical and chemical characteristics of the topsoil; vegetation cover; potential enzymatic activities (dehydrogenase, ß-glucosidase, urease, acid and alkaline phosphatase) and quantification of aerobic oligotrophic and copiotrophic bacteria and fungi (selective enumeration). The relationship between soil properties, vegetation cover and microbial properties was analysed using multivariate ordination techniques. Although the <b>discard</b> <b>sites</b> had different rehabilitation ages (1 – 8 years), no statistically significant difference existed between these sites based on physical and chemical characteristics or selective enumeration (p> 0. 05). Differentiation was possible based on enzymatic activities, where sites with relatively higher vegetation cover and organic carbon content had a positive association with enzymatic activities. Organic carbon content correlated significantly with β-glucosidase (r = 0. 80, p< 0. 05), urease (r = 0. 96, p< 0. 05), acid phosphatase (r = 0. 76, p< 0. 05), dehydrogenase (r = 0. 69, p< 0. 10) and microbial biomass (r = 0. 73, p< 0. 10).

40|$|Thesis (M. Environmental Science) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. Mining {{activities}} {{cause severe}} disturbance {{to the soil}} environment in terms of soil quality and productivity and are of serious concern worldwide. Under South African legislation, developers are required to ecologically rehabilitate damaged environments. The application of agronomic approaches for the rehabilitation of coal <b>discard</b> <b>sites</b> has failed dismally in the arid areas of southern Africa. It is obvious that compliance with mitigation and rehabilitation requirements cannot be enforced without {{a thorough understanding of}} the ecological principles that ensure ecological stability and subsequent sustainability of soil ecosystems. Soil micro organisms are crucial role-players in the processes that make energy and nutrients available for recycling in the soil ecosystem. Poor management practices and other negative impacts on soil ecosystems affect both the physical and chemical properties of soil, as well as the functional and structural properties of soil microbial communities. Disturbances of soil ecosystems that impact on the normal functioning of microbial communities are potentially detrimental to soil formation, energy transfers, nutrient cycling, plant reestablishment and long-term stability. In this regard, an extensive overview of soil properties and processes indicated that the use of microbiological and biochemical soil properties, such as microbial biomass, enzymatic activity and the analysis of microbial community structure by the quantification of specific signature lipid biomarkers are useful as indicators of soil ecological stress or restoration properties because they are more responsive to small changes than physical and chemical characteristics. In this study, the relationship between the physical and chemical characteristics and different biological indicators of soil quality in the topsoil covers of seven coal <b>discard</b> <b>sites</b> under rehabilitation in South Africa, as well as three reference sites was investigated. Through the assimilation of basic quantitative data and the assessment of certain physical, chemical and biological properties of the topsoil covers obtained from the various coal <b>discard</b> <b>sites</b> as well as the reference sites, the relative success or progress of rehabilitation and the possible correlation between the biological indicators of soil quality and the establishment of self sustaining vegetation covers was determined. Results from soil physical and chemical analyses and percentage vegetation cover were correlated with the results obtained for the functional and structural diversity of microbial communities at the various sites. All results were investigated through statistical and multivariate analysis and the most prominent physical and chemical parameters that influence the biological and biochemical properties of the soil and possibly the establishment of self-sustainable vegetation cover on these mine-tailing sites were identified. Results obtained from this study indicated no significant difference (p> 0. 05) between the various <b>discard</b> <b>sites</b> based on conventional microbiological enumeration techniques. However, significant differences (p< 0. 05) could be observed between the three reference sites. All enzymatic activities assayed for the rehabilitation sites, with the exception of urease and alkaline phosphatase displayed a strong, positive association with the organic carbon content (%C). Ammonium concentration had a weak association with all the enzymes studied and pH only showed a negative association with acid phosphatase activity. A positive association was observed between the viable microbial biomass, vegetation cover and the organic carbon content, ammonium, nitrate and phosphorus concentrations of the soil. The various rehabilitation and reference sites could be differentiated based on the microbial community structure as determined by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis. It is hypothesised that the microbial community structure of the Hendrina site is not sustainable when classified along an r-K gradient and that the high percentage of vegetation cover and high levels of estimated viable microbial biomass are an artificial reflection of the current management practices being employed at this site. Results obtained during this study, suggest that an absence or low percentage of vegetation cover and associated lower organic matter content of the soil have a significant negative impact on soil biochemical properties (enzymatic activity) as well as microbial population size. Furthermore, prevailing environmental physico-chemical and management characteristics significantly influences the vegetation cover and subsequently the microbial community structure. The results indicate that the microbial ecosystems in the coal <b>discard</b> <b>sites</b> could become more stable and ecologically self-regulating, provided effective management to enhance the organic carbon content of the soil. This could enhance nutrient cycling, resulting in changes of soil structure and eventually an improved soil quality which could facilitate the establishment of self sustaining vegetation cover. Results obtained during this study suggest that a polyphasic assessment of physical and chemical properties; microbial activities by enzymatic analysis; the characterisation of microbial community structure by analysis of phospholipid fatty acids; and the multifactorial analysis of the data obtained can be used as complementary assessment criteria for the evaluation of the trend of rehabilitation of mine tailings and <b>discard</b> <b>sites.</b> Strategic management criteria are recommended based on the soil quality environmental sustainability indices to facilitate the establishment of self sustainable vegetation covers. The contribution of this research to soil ecology is significant with regards to the intensive investigation and explanation of characteristics and processes that drive ecological rehabilitation and determine the quality of the soil environment. The multidisciplinary approach that is proposed could, furthermore, assist in the successful rehabilitation and establishment of self-sustaining vegetation covers at industrially disturbed areas, as well as assist in improving degraded soil quality associated with both intensive and informal agriculture. Additionally, this approach could negate the negative social and environmental impacts frequently associated with these activities. Master...|$|R

A large piece of chert (also called a core) would first be heated and then bone is struck with a round hammerstone (made of volcanic rock) against the core, using indirect percussion fragments were chipped off to make prismatic chert blades. A hammerstone (probably imported from the Guatemalan highlands) was also found nearby the chert fragments. The stone was identified as being a hammerstone because of its smooth and rounded from use and fits comfortably in the hand and has scratches and chips from use. The uncovering of these related artifacts suggests possibly a tool manufacturing area or a <b>discard</b> <b>site.</b>|$|R

In this investigation, space-for-time substitution was applied to two chronosequences of coal <b>discard</b> <b>sites</b> to determine the applicability of this approach to show the long-term effect of rehabilitation age on microbial communities.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of the spatial and temporal patterns of low flows {{as well as their}} generation mechanisms over large geographic regions can provide valuable insights and understanding for climate change impacts, regional frequency analysis, risk assessment of extreme events, and decision-making regarding allowable withdrawals. The goal {{of this paper is to}} examine nonstationarity in low flow generation across the eastern US and explore the potential anthropogenic influences or climate drivers. We use nonparametric tests to identify abrupt and gradual changes in time series of low flows and their timing for 508 USGS streamflow gauging sites in the eastern US with more than 50 years of daily data, to systematically distinguish the effects of human intervention from those of climate variability. A time series decomposition algorithm was applied to 1 -day, 7 -day, 30 -day, and 90 -day annual low flow time series that combines the Box–Ljung test for detection of autocorrelation, the Pettitt test for abrupt step changes and the Mann–Kendall test for monotonic trends. Examination of the USGS notes for each site showed that many of the sites with step changes and around half of the sites with an increasing trend have been documented as having some kind of regulation. Sites with decreasing or no trend are less likely to have documented influences on flows. Overall, a general pattern of increasing low flows in the northeast and decreasing low flows in the southeast is evident over a common time period (1951 – 2005), even when <b>discarding</b> <b>sites</b> with significant autocorrelation, documented regulation or other human impacts. The north–south pattern of trends is consistent with changes in antecedent precipitation. The main exception is along the mid-Atlantic coastal aquifer system from eastern Virginia northwards, where low flows have decreased despite increasing precipitation, and suggests that declining groundwater levels due to pumping may have contributed to decreased low flows. For most sites, the majority of low flows occur in one season in the late summer to fall, as driven by the lower precipitation and higher evaporative demand in this season, but this is complicated in many regions because of the presence of a secondary low flow season in the winter for sites in the extreme northeast and in the spring for sites in Florida. Trends in low flow timing are generally undetectable, although abrupt step changes appear to be associated with regulation...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{interaction}} of numerous factors affecting economic productivity in England’s 17 th-century tobacco trade with its Chesapeake colonies, particularly {{with an eye to}} transatlantic shipping. This is achieved here {{through the use of a}} network inspired analytical framework to provide an assessment of a range of elements surrounding the trade over the course of the 17 th century, how these elements interacted, and the degree to which they affected the overall productivity tobacco market. Data used to these means include the extant body of relevant literature, historical documentation, archaeological data, and a case study of an archaeological site near St. Mary’s City, Maryland, USA investigated for the purpose of this thesis. The tobacco economy is examined and analysed based on various inputs, along with various social and political factors. Settlement patterning is studied through geo-spatial archaeological data from Maryland to identify possible causes for the shift in the tobacco collection model from a plantation-front based system to a central warehouse model. Through this, it is argued that the dominant driver for this change was a spread of plantations to more inland sites owing to population growth as the dominant cause. Shipbuilding is scrutinised to identify trends in ship technology and construction methods, showing changes to be both purpose and resource driven. Passenger journals and logbooks are used to examine changes in sailing route throughout the 17 th century from England to the Chesapeake, resulting in the identification of a previously unknown route of ocean passage in common usage in the latter half of the 17 th century. This change provided generally faster crossings on a less hazardous route, necessitated largely by political and social causes. Making use of these same voyage accounts as a data source, a quantitative study of English merchant ship performance in terms of velocity made good and windward sailing capabilities is provided. Results of this study indicate that advances in ocean crossing times were largely route dependent, with little if any advance in sailing speed over this period. Lastly, the examination of a submerged ballast cluster has provided insights into possible focusses of maritime archaeology in the Chesapeake region. To date, no vessels dating to the early colonial period have been located in the region despite heavy maritime traffic in this era. Ballast <b>discard</b> <b>sites</b> dating to this period are a common yet virtually unexamined site type for this area, and should be afforded additional attention. In sum, this thesis provides a detailed overview of the function of the English-Chesapeake tobacco trade, resulting in a series of network-based models of interaction examining foreign and domestic politics, crew size and mariner wages, tobacco production, the tobacco market, product collection models, sailing routes, hull and sail efficiency, ship construction, time spent at sea, and time spent in port. These are assessed on a temporal scale, allowing for summary of the function of the tobacco economy at various points throughout the 17 th century and into the 18 th century...|$|R

The excavated evidence provides important evidence for the evolution of monastic plans in the Christian West in this period. The excavations have also provided some evidence for the econonmic base of such sites, and demonstrated their international contacts, mainly due to the exotic pottery from buildings at Jarrow. The excavation of the successor monasteries  some of the ruined buildings of which still survive at Jarrow  has made it possible to consider the local economies of the sites through a period of 1100 years. Changing uses of maritime and regional resources can be demonstrated from the finds, and the cemeteries of the two sites have provided useful long-term demographic evidence from the Early Christian period to the 19 th century.

Selection for yield was defined as performance superior to the best check in each location. Selection for disease reaction was based on an index derived from the Standard Evaluation System for Rice for diseases of regional importance. Locations varies 10 – 15 percent in their selection coincidence with the region for both yield and disease selection criteria applied independently. Peer-reviewe...|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} paleomagnetic and rock-magnetic study of Miocene {{volcanic}} rocks from the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. A total of 32 sites (238 oriented samples) {{were collected from}} three localities: Queretaro, Guadalajara and Los Altos de Jalisco basaltic plateaux, which span from 11 to 7. 5 Ma. Several rock-magnetic experiments were carried out {{in order to identify}} the magnetic carriers and to obtain information about their paleomagnetic stability. Microscopic observation of polished sections shows that the main magnetic mineral is Ti-poor titanomagnetite associated with exsolved ilmenite. Continuous susceptibility measurements with temperature yield in most cases reasonably reversible curves with Curie points close to that of magnetite. Judging from the ratios of hysteresis parameters, it seems that all samples fall in the pseudo-single domain (PSD) grain size region, probably indicating a mixture of multidomain (MD) and a significant amount of single domain (SD) grains. Based on our paleomagnetic and available radiometric data, it seems that the volcanic units have been emplaced during a relatively short time span of 1 to 2 My at each locality. The mean paleomagnetic directions obtained from each locality differ significantly from that expected for the Middle Miocene. The mean paleomagnetic direction calculated from 28 <b>sites</b> <b>discarding</b> those of intermediate polarity is I = 32. 46 ◦, D = 341. 2 ◦, k = 7. 2 and α 95 = 11. 6 ◦.

40|$|Background/question/methods: Diet {{studies are}} crucial in {{understanding}} species ecology; however, {{they are often}} limited in that very few provide detailed accounts of prey species consumed, particularly for bats. Traditionally, bat dietary studies relied upon morphological identification of prey remains in stomach contents, faeces or from remains <b>discarded</b> under feeding <b>sites.</b> Analysis of faecal matter is preferred as this non-invasive method explicitly captures the proportions of protein ingested from different types of prey. Recent advances in molecular technology, such as high-throughput sequencing (HTS), enable detailed prey identification from faecal samples to genus and species. Within the context of south-western Australia’s biodiversity hotspot, {{we were the first}} Australian study to utilise HTS, comparing dietary preferences of eight species of bat, including two endemic species. Results/conclusions: Unsurprisingly, preliminary analyses show that Lepidoptera are an important dietary component, with faecal samples from all species containing Lepidoptera. Diptera was the second most prolific prey overall, although not found as prey for all bat species. Diptera has rarely been mentioned as a dietary component for these bat species, likely as soft-bodied Diptera are not detected when morphologically teasing apart faeces. HTS provides an unprecedented level of detail into the study of bat dietary preferences and dramatically adds to our current knowledge of bat ecology. In addition, it provides an opportunity to comprehensively sample invertebrates inhabiting this biodiversity hotspot...|$|R
40|$|The {{issue of}} fission source {{convergence}} in Monte Carlo eigenvalue calculations {{is of interest}} {{because of the potential}} consequences of erroneous criticality safety calculations. In this work, the authors compare two different techniques to improve the source convergence behavior of standard Monte Carlo calculations applied to challenging source convergence problems. The first method, super-history powering, attempts to avoid <b>discarding</b> important fission <b>sites</b> between generations by delaying stochastic sampling of the fission site bank until after several generations of multiplication. The second method, stratified sampling of the fission site bank, explicitly keeps the important sites even if conventional sampling would have eliminated them. The test problems are variants of Whitesides' Criticality of the World problem in which the fission site phase space was intentionally undersampled in order to induce marginally intolerable variability in local fission site populations. Three variants of the problem were studied, each with a different degree of coupling between fissionable pieces. Both the superhistory powering method and the stratified sampling method were shown to improve convergence behavior, although stratified sampling is more robust for the extreme case of no coupling. Neither algorithm completely eliminates the loss of the most important fissionable piece, and if coupling is absent, the lost piece cannot be recovered unless its sites from earlier generations have been retained. Finally, criteria for measuring source convergence reliability are proposed and applied to the test problems...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Many consensus-based and Position Weight Matrix-based {{methods for}} {{recognizing}} transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) {{are not well}} suited to the variability in the lengths of binding sites. Besides, many methods <b>discard</b> known binding <b>sites</b> while building the model. Moreover, the impact of Information Content (IC) and the positional dependence of nucleotides within an aligned set of TFBS has not been well researched for modeling variable-length binding sites. In this paper, we propose ML-Consensus (Mixed-Length Consensus) : a consensus model for variable-length TFBS which does not exclude any reported binding sites. Methods We consider Pairwise Score (PS) {{as a measure of}} positional dependence of nucleotides within an alignment of TFBS. We investigate how the prediction accuracy of ML-Consensus is affected by the incorporation of IC and PS with a particular binding site alignment strategy. We perform cross-validations for datasets of six species from the TRANSFAC public database, and analyze the results using ROC curves and the Wilcoxon matched-pair signed-ranks test. Results We observe that the incorporation of IC and PS in ML-Consensus results in statistically significant improvement in the prediction accuracy of the model. Moreover, the existence of a core region among the known binding sites (of any length) is witnessed by the pairwise coexistence of nucleotides within the core length. Conclusions These observations suggest the possibility of an efficient multiple sequence alignment algorithm for aligning TFBS, accommodating known binding sites of any length, for optimal (or near-optimal) TFBS prediction. However, designing such an algorithm is a matter of further investigation. </p...|$|R
40|$|The Bayshore Homes {{site was}} {{occupied}} intermittently {{over a period}} of approximately twelve hundred years, with the two main occupation periods being CE 150 - 550 and CE 900 - 1350. During those lengthy occupations a substantial amount of plain and decorated pottery was <b>discarded</b> at the <b>site.</b> A portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) spectrometer was utilized to analyze the elemental composition of 133 sherds, both decorated and plain. The resulting elemental composition data were then analyzed using multivariate statistics in an attempt to discern discrete clay sources that may have been exploited by inhabitants of the Bayshore Homes site. Principal component analysis (PCA) and discriminant function analysis (DA) were employed to identify three discrete clay sources exploited in the production of pottery. The results of the statistical analyses were then used to answer two basic, yet pertinent, questions about the Bayshore pottery: 1) Were the same clay sources exploited during both occupation periods? 2) Were the same clay sources exploited for both decorated and plain pottery? The results of the statistical analyses indicate that the same clay sources were exploited for both occupation periods, though evidence suggests that the dominant clay source in use did change over time. The results also imply that the same clay sources were utilized in the production of plain and decorated pottery, which suggests that at least some portion of the decorated pottery excavated from the Bayshore site was produced locally, and not obtained through trade. Finally, the results of this research demonstrate that pXRF is a useful tool for preliminary differentiation of clay sources in Florida...|$|R

These values are consistent with those predicted by the latitude-dependent variation model of McFadden et al. (1991) for the last 5 Myr. The interesting feature of the paleomagnetic record obtained here is the occurrence of an intermediate polarity at 671 ± 13 ka which may correspond the worldwide observed Delta excursion at about 680 – 690 ka. This gives the volcanic evidence of this event. Two independent lava flows dated as 362 ± 13 and 354 ± 5 ka respectively, yield transitional paleodirections as well, probably corresponding to the Levantine excursion.|$|R

Site GNL Quintero 1 (GNLQ 1), {{located in}} Quintero Bay (32 S, Central Chile) {{constitutes}} {{the first evidence}} of a drowned terrestrial site on the continental West Coast of South America covered by sea-level rise after the Last Glacial Maximum. The site currently lies 650 m offshore and 13 m underwater, covers an area of w 64 m 2 and contains several discrete exposed and shallow-buried bone deposits. Through underwater archaeology survey and test excavations, {{a significant amount of}} animal bone assigned to the Late Pleistocene was successfully recovered and analyzed. After recovery and prior to the analyses, the bones were subjected to conservation and stabilization treatments, resulting in good preservation of the material. Taxonomic analyses (NISP 224) revealed high taxonomic diversity of extinct fauna (Camelidae, Cervidae, Artiodactyla, Equidae, Mylodontidae, Canidae, Rodentia and Xenarthra). The sample represents a continental faunal assemblage belonging to a drowned terrestrial context, probably related to an estuarine-lagoon environment. Taphonomic analysis allowed macroscopic identification of natural marks (punctures) associated with large and small size carnivores. The bones also show abrasion related to the action of marine sands along with colour alterations. By applying Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) micrographs and Energy-Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) to fossil bones, marks and colour alterations were identified. Marks indicated rodent gnawing and trampling, while colour alterations were attributed to diagenesis processes, <b>discarding</b> thermal treatment. <b>Site</b> GNLQ 1 is identified as having very high potential, for it provides the first evidence for a submerged palaeolandscape viable for human occupation and movement along the Pacific Coast of South America during the Late Pleistocene.
