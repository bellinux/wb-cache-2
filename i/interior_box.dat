60|$|Now {{that the}} old Countess, and perhaps Barnes, were away, the barrier between Clive and this family seemed to be withdrawn. The young folks who loved him were free {{to see him as}} often as he would come. They were going to Baden: would he come too? Baden was on the road to Switzerland, he might journey to Strasbourg, Basle, and so on. Clive was glad enough to go with his cousins, and travel in the orbit of such a lovely girl as Ethel Newcome. J. J. {{performed}} the second part always when Clive was present: and so they all travelled to Coblentz, Mayence, and Frankfort together, making the journey which everybody knows, and sketching the mountains and castles we all of us have sketched. Ethel's beauty made all the passengers on all the steamers look round and admire. Clive was proud of being in the suite of such a lovely person. The family travelled with a pair of those carriages which used to thunder along the Continental roads a dozen years since, and from <b>interior,</b> <b>box,</b> and rumble discharge a dozen English people at hotel gates.|$|E

50|$|The floors {{consisted}} of 4 in lightweight concrete slabs laid on a fluted steel deck. A grid of lightweight bridging trusses and main trusses supported the floors with shear {{connections to the}} concrete slab for composite action. The trusses had a span of 60 ft in the long-span areas and 35 ft in the short-span area. The trusses connected to the perimeter at alternate columns, and were therefore on 6.8 ft centers.

5000|$|The hollow {{part of the}} <b>interior</b> <b>box</b> {{encloses}} five rayon balls (similar to cotton balls) {{which are}} {{in contact with the}} wick.

Printed {{on the bottom of the}} felt (in modern Zippos, not on older models [...] ) are the words, [...] "LIFT TO FILL," [...] to indicate one must lift the felt away from the [...] "cotton" [...] in order to refuel it. The fuel, light petroleum distillate or synthetic isoparaffinic hydrocarbon (commonly referred to as lighter fluid or naphtha), is poured into the rayon balls (sometimes called the [...] "cotton," [...] or the [...] "batting"), which absorbs it. It also contains a tube that holds a short, cylindrical flint. The tube has an interior spring and exterior cap-screw that keeps the flint in constant contact with the exterior flint-wheel. Spinning this rough-surfaced wheel against flint results in a spark that ignites the fluid in the wick.|$|E

In the original script, in the scene where the Doctor opens the TARDIS doors and discovers only a police <b>box</b> <b>interior,</b> the police <b>box</b> fell apart. This was changed for reasons of cost, and Cornell has stated that he thinks the change is an improvement. Cornell also states that the character of Pete Tyler is based on his own father, who attempted many different jobs and schemes (including, like Pete, selling health drinks) before eventually finding success running a betting shop. Pete's line [...] "I'm your dad, it's my job for it to be my fault" [...] is taken from something Cornell's father once said to him. Originally Pete was to take a swig of wine before sacrificing himself, but this was removed because a correlation between alcohol and bravery was not thought to be a positive message.|$|R

50|$|The {{church was}} built in 1817 by the Methodist Society of Athens, founded in 1801. The society {{was part of a}} local circuit of Methodist congregations, and this was the first church built to serve them. When built, the <b>interior</b> {{included}} <b>box</b> pews, and a high pulpit with sounding board {{at the north end of}} the building. By the late 1850s, the center of Athens had migrated from this area to the northeast, including the construction of a new Methodist church. This building was then altered, removing the box pews and pulpit, and adding the second floor as an assembly hall for town meetings. In 1924 a local organization was formed to maintain the building, but was hampered by funding and only achieved limited repairs. The town formally took over the building in 1951, and continued to use it for town meetings into the 1970s.|$|R
