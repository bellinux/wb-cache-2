500|$|Tom Wilson {{became more}} {{enthusiastic}} as the sessions continued. In {{the middle of}} the week of recording, Zappa told him, [...] "I would like to rent $500 worth of percussion equipment for a session that starts at midnight on Friday and <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> all the freaks from Sunset Boulevard into the studio to do something special." [...] Wilson agreed. The material was worked into [...] "The Return of the Son of Monster Magnet". In a November 1967 radio interview (posthumously included as part of the 2006 MOFO album), Zappa is heard complaining that the version of [...] "Monster Magnet" [...] released on Freak Out! was in fact an unfinished piece; the percussion track was intended to serve as the foundation for an even more complex piece, but MGM refused to approve the studio time needed to record the intended overdubs that would have completed the composition, and so it was released (to Zappa's great dissatisfaction) in this unfinished form.|$|E
2500|$|In the post-fight {{interview}} Mayweather said, [...] "My last training day, I hurt my {{rotator cuff}} {{in my left}} shoulder, so I couldn't use my jab the way I want to. My left wasn't as strong as I wanted it to be, but I didn't want to have no excuses, you know, like other champions, you know, when they get hurt they won't even show up to the fight. I get hurt I keep fighting, you know, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> the fans a victory".|$|E
2500|$|Peterson {{believed}} he was a player that a franchise could build around. In an interview with IGN following the NFL Draft, he said, [...] "I'm a player who is coming in with the determination to turn a team around. I want to help my team get to the playoffs, win...and run wild. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> people to the stands. I want {{people to come to}} the game to see what I can do next. Things like that can change the whole attitude of an organization. I want to win." [...] He later told the Star Tribune in an interview, [...] "I want to be the best player to ever play this game." [...] Nearly three months after being drafted, he was signed by the Vikings on July 29, 2007. His contract was worth $40.5 million over five years, with $17 million guaranteed.|$|E

2500|$|Among {{the things}} being {{discussed}} at the meetings was the pressing issue of recruitment. A West Point graduate, Ulysses was {{the only man in}} town with professional military training, and was elected to preside over the meeting. When Ulysses was given command of the 21st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment, a regiment composed of unruly volunteers, Jesse expressed disappointment in a letter to him, feeling that Ulysses' talent and efforts would have been better used commanding regular army troops. In a reply letter to his father Ulysses attempted to abate Jesse's criticism maintaining, [...] "You ask if I should not like to go in the regular army. I should not. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> my children (recruits) up to useful employment, and in the army the chance is poor", stressing the point that he was more concerned about the war than he was a career.|$|E
2500|$|The New York Times {{reported}} that, {{within days}} of the speech, some religious groups and institutions of higher learning were [...] "especially enthusiastic" [...] about Obama's call for a racial dialogue. According to the Times, [...] "Universities were moving to incorporate the issues Mr. Obama raised into classroom discussions and course work, and churches were trying to find ways to do the same in sermons and Bible studies." [...] Rev. Troy Benton—lead pastor at a church outside Atlanta—said that he did not [...] "see how you can be an African-American preacher and not {{try to figure out how}} to have something to say this Sunday (March 23, 2008), even though it's Easter." [...] Rev. James A. Forbes was to preach the Trinity United Church of Christ Easter service which Rev. Wright had preached in the past, telling the Times: [...] "It is nighttime in America, and <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> a word of encouragement." ...|$|E
2500|$|Due to {{limitations}} in computer technology, especially regarding attempts {{to capture the}} complexity of a human form, many basic principles of animation used in traditionally animated movies had been absent from earlier CGI films; but technological advancements have {{made it easier to}} blend the two, combining the strengths of each style. Keane stated repeatedly he was trying to make the computer [...] "bend its knee to the artist" [...] instead of having the computer dictate the artistic style and look of the film. By making the computer become as [...] "pliable as the pencil", Keane's vision of a [...] "three-dimensional drawing" [...] seemed within reach, with the artist controlling the technology. Many of the techniques and tools that were required to give the film the quality Keane demanded did not exist when the project was started, and Walt Disney Animation Studios had to create them on their own. Keane said, [...] "There’s no photoreal hair. I want luscious hair, and we are inventing new ways of doing that. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> the warmth and intuitive feel of hand-drawn to CGI." ...|$|E

Phenomenon occurring not just in the lifes of dancers but artists in general. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> it closer <b>to</b> all of us- human beings because after all we all use it in our everyday lifes. The work is conceived from a teachers view, with regards to all potential students, offering them practical movement qualities, they should cover.

2500|$|Reinhart's {{style has}} been noted for its {{infusion}} of mainstream pop with elements of retro-pop and traditional jazz. Her performances on Idol were often critically praised for their jazzy and bluesy elements built upon a Joplin-esque rock foundation. Reinhart's debut album was also distinguished for its fusion of various musical genres, such as pop, R, rock and roll, and soul into a combination that {{has been described as}} [...] "timeless and irresistibly fresh." [...] Reinhart has crafted her music to reflect [...] "that raw musicianship that means so much to me." [...] Of her first album she describes [...] "it wasn't about trying so hard; it was all about pure feeling and energy. To me that's the important stuff. That's what <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> back into music today." [...] Jason Scott of Popdust noted Reinhart for the [...] "slinky way she delivers a lyric... an unfettered, daring confidence masked with a wink and a smile." [...] In a review for Better, he also opined that [...] "her framework has always been the jazz standards of the ’30s and ’40s with a lacquered coat of ’60s disco, with a bit of soul painted on for equal measure." [...] Zach Dionne for Fuse described Reinhart as a [...] "soulful, jazzy, altogether genre-defying singer-songwriter." [...] Of Reinhart's style, Atwood Magazine noted [...] "from the [...] bluesy rocker-chick during her Idol era to her more pop-driven Motown vibe in her first album Listen Up! to her current jazz-funk fusion sound on her latest album Better, Reinhart has proven time and time again that she is no jack-of-all-trades, but the master and supreme innovator of each one." ...|$|E
