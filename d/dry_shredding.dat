Their flesh was most excellent eating--half-way between meat and fish: I had it several times. The difficulty of shooting them was, that the falcons and spurwing-plovers would hover round the pit, when the crocodiles invariably took to the water. Their sight and hearing were good, but their scent indifferent. I generally got a shot or two at daybreak after sleeping in the pit." ...|$|R

The <b>dried</b> <b>shredded</b> mushroom which was used as P. ostreatus spawn source {{is a product of}} mushroom production at the same unit. The dried mushroom fruit was placed in shredding machine before soaking in clean water to 50 % moisture content for the field trial. The wheat straw substrate was hammer-milled and soaked in clean water that was mixed with formalin (2 parts water: 1 part formalin) for 24  h to eliminate wild fungus spores and bacteria. The substrate was then squeezed of its excess water to achieve 50 % residual moisture content.

40|$|In {{the first}} phase of our studies of the {{contaminants}} and their levels in curbside-collected poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) subjected to a recycling process, we analysed the washed and <b>dried,</b> <b>shredded</b> PET (flake). Of the semi-volatile contaminants found, 26 were below the US FDA threshold of 215 ppb and six were above. Additionally, it was found that surface levels of contaminants far exceeded average concentrations in the bulk of the flake, raising questions about the appropriateness of sampling procedures. In this second phase (again using dichloromethane Soxhlet extractions for the most part), we examined contaminant levels after the flake was subjected to vacuum extrusion, to complete the recycling process. Initially amorphous, extruded pellets were annealed to introduce crystallinity and allow grinding, in order to examine the effect of particle size. Much reduced concentrations of contaminants were found (all 300 - 425 µm and > 425 - 700 µm), approximately 8 h were required for the unground annealed pellets...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim was to}} {{determine}} which contaminants were present in washed and <b>dried</b> <b>shredded</b> poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET, flake) obtained from curbside collection and whether the concentrations were above the US FDA threshold of 215 ppb. Thirty-two semi-volatile contaminants were extracted from the treated flake by Soxhlet extraction using dichloromethane as a PET swelling solvent and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used for identification and quantification. Soxhlet extraction of flake ground to 0 - 300 &# 956;m was effectively completed in 24 h, whereas sonication reduced the extraction time to 3 h. In contrast, Soxhlet extractions of flake ground to a larger particle size range (300 - 425 &# 956;m) were completed in 4 h, possibly due to less aggregation in the extraction thimble. The levels of 26 contaminants were below 215 ppb, but six were not. Dodecanoic acid was present at about 1200 ppb, 2 -butoxyethanol was approximately 1000 ppb, limonene, benzophenone and methyl salicylate were above 800 ppb, and 2 -methylnaphthalene near 215 ppb...|$|R
