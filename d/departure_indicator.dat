50|$|As well as {{platform}} accommodation, a new mechanical <b>departure</b> <b>indicator</b> was provided, {{and there}} were spacious new offices for the LSWR headquarters. The new roof over platforms 1 to 15 was built, with its bays transverse to the tracks; the roof over what became platforms 16 to 21 retained the longitudinal roof built in 1885, making the Windsor line station obviously different. The last of the new platforms was commissioned on 28 February 1915. The new station was formally opened by HM Queen Mary on 21 March 1922; {{the cost of the}} reconstruction had been Â£2,269,354.|$|E
40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} to develop a {{distance}} to line crossing (DLC) based computation of time to line crossing (TLC). Different computation methods with increasing complexity are provided. A discussion develops the influence of assumptions generally assumed for approximation. A sensitivity analysis with respect to the vehicle parameters and positioning is performed. For TLC computation, both straight and curved vehicle paths are considered. The road curvature being another important variable considered in the proposed computations, an observer for its estimation is then proposed. An evaluation over a digitalized test track is first performed. Real data is then collected through an experiment carried out in test tracks with our equipped prototype vehicle. Based on these real data, the TLC is then computed with the theoretical proposed methods. Obtained results outlined the necessity to take into consideration vehicle dynamics in order to use the TLC as a lane <b>departure</b> <b>indicator...</b>|$|E

50|$|The London, Chatham and Dover Railway {{built the}} station on a brick viaduct in 1863. It has two entrances, one on Elephant Road and one {{connected}} to the upper level of the Elephant and Castle shopping centre. There is a <b>departures</b> <b>indicator</b> in the shopping centre as well as separate platform indicators in the ticket hall. There are four platforms, two being on the island between the lines. The station is not directly {{connected to the}} London Underground station. To change from the Underground {{it is necessary to}} leave the Underground station (the Northern Line exit is nearer), pass through the ticket barrier and then walk either through or round the shopping centre. Four staircases provide the only access to the platforms, as there are no lifts or escalators.|$|R

40|$|Vegetation {{and climate}} {{interact}} at different spatio-temporal scales. As a consequence, analyses of inter-relationships between vegetation and climate must be scale-dependent and site- specific. In this dissertation, multi-temporal satellite data {{are used to}} examine climate-vegetation relationships at different scales in order to detect the most important changes occurring in the landscape surface as related to inter-annual climate variability. Patterns {{have been identified as}} forms of spatial variation, processes have been studied as climate-vegetation relationships, and change has been (statistically) evaluated as significant <b>departures</b> from <b>indicators</b> of reference. ^ Several research questions have been addressed in this dissertation. This resulted in (a) the application of change-vector analysis for characterization of inter-annual land cover changes in the conterminous United States; (b) deriving measures of seasonal and interannual variation in vegetation activity from remotely-sensed observations; (c) and the analysis of inter-annual changes in the onset of greenness as a function of thermal variables and water budget. ^ Changes occurring in the landscape can be basically of two types: (a) Archetypes or similar inter-annual changes that are repeated every year and that occur at local scales (i. e., for specific land cover types); and (b) Anomalous deviations from archetypes or inter-annual changes that produce regional vegetation responses. Several seasonal measures can be used for inter-annual comparisons of satellite imagery. The total variability contained in satellite imagery can be reduced to three forms of temporal and spatial variation interpretable as seasonal vegetation signals. Different combinations of water-use and energy variables determine the different onset dates in the growing seasons, i. e., there is no a single factor responsible for triggering photosynthetic activity. Generally, thermal variables (such as growing degree-days and surface temperatures) are more important than water use variables to determine the onset dates. ...|$|R
50|$|One of {{the later}} books Burgh {{published}} was on the indicator diagram, since the early 20th century named pressure volume diagram or PV diagram. This was the first (and only) book solely devoted to the indicator diagram, its theoretical background, and its applications. This type of diagram was developed late 18th century in the workshop of Boulton and Watt by James Watt and his employee John Southern (1758-1815). It was used to improve the efficiency of engines, and kept a trade secret until the 1830s. In the 1850s William John Macquorn Rankine in 1859/1866 {{was one of the}} first to give a detailed description of the device. According to Miller (2011): A detailed and influential treatment of the indicator within the framework of a newly developing âengineering scienceâ was given by W. J. Macquorn Rankine, in his A Manual of the Steam Engine (1859). Rankine not only reconceptualized the indicator diagram as what he called the âdiagram of energyâ, but also offered a substantial scientific account of how <b>departures</b> of real <b>indicator</b> diagrams from the ideal could be linked to operating characteristics of engines and of the indicator itself.|$|R
5000|$|Geese {{are large}} birds {{belong to the}} family of the Anatidae, {{subfamily}} of the Anserinae, and the tribe of the Anserini. The geese in the genus Anser have a Holarctic distribution, and include the grey geese. White geese sometimes are sometimes included in Anser, and sometimes described as being in the genus Chen, and their breeding areas are in subarctic areas of North America and around the Bering Strait. The black geese are in the genus Branta and occur in the Palearctic ecozone: they are called [...] "black" [...] due to the coloring of their legs, bills, and parts of their plumage, which are black or dark grey. The family Anatidae includes ducks and swans. Unless domestic, geese are generally migratory, traveling lengthy distances in between their summer habitats in the north and their winter habitats in the south. In China, geese have been domesticated for thousands of years: these have been primarily been bred from the wild species Anser cygnoides, and are also known as the Swan Goose or the Chinese Goose. True geese are difficult to differentiate into genus or species based on anatomical differences other than coloration, especially if the geese occur, as they often do in poetry, in the distance, flying, and perhaps even more heard than seen: but, the genus and species identification is not generally of importance in Chinese poetry, although whether the goose is wild or domestic is of importance. Geese are social animals, and tend to appear in flocks of many individuals; and, as they tend to pair up to mate, which as part of the process often includes a flying duet, with the male chasing the female through the air; and, often the flock will contain many breeding pairs. One of the distinctive features of flying flocks of geese is their typical [...] "V" [...] or wedge-shaped formation, and the loud vocalizations which accompany them on their flight. A lone goose is somewhat of an anomaly in nature. Geese and their eggs have been used for food, their feathers for thermal insulation and other purposes, and their arrivals and <b>departures</b> as seasonal <b>indicators.</b> Human interactions with geese have often included hunting wild geese with projectile weapons, raising and breeding domestic geese, or observing, and perhaps depicting them in paint or poetry.|$|R
40|$|Beginning in the 1990 s, {{sustainability}} indicators have rapidly {{been developed}} in different political contexts to measure progress towards reaching sustainable development. Previous research has largely focused on developing models and criteria for defining indicators {{in order to identify}} scientifically sound systems. However, sustainability indicators represent more than pure aggregated data; they represent values. This thesis takes its <b>departure</b> in seeing <b>indicators</b> as socially constructed, and aims to explore the role(s) indicators play in governance for local sustainable development. The traditional environmental policy discourse characterised by rationality and efficiency became challenged in the 1990 s by the Agenda 21 discourse, emphasizing the need for citizen participation for environmental governance. Notions of efficiency and participation are, however, often in conflict since achieving participation is time consuming and efficiency requires results within short time frames. Thus, a tension in governance is created which is especially apparent at the local level and in politics relating to sustinable development. In this study, Sweden is seen as an extreme case in terms of implementing sustainable development policies. Swedish local authorities have been at the international forefront in developing sustainability indicators. Here, the work surrounding seven different sustainability indicator systems in three Swedish municipalities is analysed. The overall research question relates to the tension in governance: Are the sustinability indicators driven primarily by efficiency or participatory claims? The analytical framework combines two different, yet linked theoretical approaches: an institutional approach, which captures the organizational arrangements of the indicator systems; and a discourse inspired approach, shedding light on underlying notions and âproblemâ representations embedded in the indicator systems. Interviews with politicians and local officers and written material serve as the main empirical sources. The analysis shows that local sustainability indicators vary to a great extent regarding their scope, which implies that sustainable development is interpreted differently depending on the local context. In general, goals linked to âsoftâ issues like democracy, awareness raising and learning tend to be less indicated than âhardâ issues such as pure natural scientific measures. Oftenmost, participation is interpreted in its âweakâ form, that is stakeholders and citizens are being informed about political decisions taken or are invitated to attend meetings. Many politicians express concern abut participatory methods that aim for empowering citizens, claiming that this is in conflict with the idea of representative democracy. Surprisingly, the more participatory driven indicator systems have not become established in the municipal organisation despite the involvement of many different stakeholders in the developing process. In contrast, the more efficiency driven systems, have been internally anchored but involved very few external stakeholdes in the process. These latter systems are therefore most likely to be used and implemented. In general, politiciansâ trust in expert knowledge in policy making is high {{and it is difficult to}} involve citizens in that process. Also, because work with sustainable development issues in general, and indicators in particular, is largely seen as projects rather than processes, the efficiency ideal prevails in local policy making â maybe not in rhetoric, but certainly in practice...|$|R
