5|$|Gandhi also campaigned hard {{going from}} one rural corner of the Indian subcontinent to another. He used {{terminology}} and phrases such as Rama-rajya from Ramayana, Prahlada as a paradigmatic icon, and such cultural symbols as another <b>facet</b> <b>of</b> swaraj and satyagraha. These ideas sounded strange outside India, during his lifetime, but they readily and deeply resonated with the culture and historic values of his people.|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe study <b>facets</b> <b>of</b> the k-partition polytope Pk,n, the {{convex hull}} of edges cut by r-partitions of a {{complete}} graph for r ⩽ k, k ⩾ 3. We generalize the hypermetric and cycle inequalities (see Deza and Laurent, 1992) from the cut polytope to Pk,n, k ⩾ 3. We give some sufficient conditions under which these are facet defining. We show the anti-web inequality introduced by Deza and Laurent (1992) to be facet defining for Pk,n, k ⩾ 3. We also give lifting procedures for constructing <b>facets</b> <b>of</b> Pk,r from <b>facets</b> <b>of</b> Pk,n for r ⩾ n + 1 and <b>facets</b> <b>of</b> Pk,r from <b>facets</b> <b>of</b> Pk− 1,n for r ⩾ n + 1...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{was done with}} the aim of identifying and determining <b>facets</b> in network <b>of</b> correlated relationships of inside and outside field of Islamic Ethic Thesaurus using content analysis method. The research society consisted of 3316 published terms in Islamic Ethic Thesaurus which have correlated relationship together. The method of data collecting was documentary (Library). According to the findings Personality Facet, with 23 lateral and subset facets and 78. 55 percent usage, has the most usage in correlated relationships of Islamic Ethic Thesaurus. The Space Facet without subset facet and 0. 05 percent usage, has the minimum usage in correlated relationships of Islamic Ethic Thesaurus. Thus, {{it can be said that}} ‘Personality’ Facet has the most frequency, and ‘Space’ Facet has the minimum frequency between <b>facets</b> <b>of</b> network of correlated relationships in concepts of inside and outside field of Islamic Ethic Thesaurus. In this study according to the requirements of Islamic Ethic Thesaurus 6 facets were described which include <b>facets</b> <b>of</b> love and friendship, <b>facets</b> <b>of</b> foundation/basis, <b>facets</b> <b>of</b> pests and damages, <b>facets</b> <b>of</b> internal characteristics/sense, <b>facets</b> <b>of</b> signs and symptoms, and <b>facets</b> <b>of</b> ranks and grade...|$|R

In recent years, this sectarianism has declined significantly, {{and is no longer}} a commonly acknowledged <b>facet</b> <b>of</b> life in St. John's. St. John's is the seat of the Roman Catholic Archbishop of St. John's, and the Anglican Bishop of Eastern Newfoundland and Labrador. All major Christian sects showed a decline from 2001–2011 with a large increase in those with no religion from 3.9% to 11.1%.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} <b>facet</b> <b>of</b> the British and American frontier was {{a system}} of forts built by the military. The forts provided safe shelter for soldiers and explorers on the frontier and a base of operations for expeditions, both military and commercial. The first forts in the area had been French, particularly Fort Beauharnois, built during the 18th century and later abandoned because of the French and Indian War with the British. British Fort Charlotte at Grand Portage became essential to the fur trade protecting and supplying British traders {{as well as the}} area natives. This British fort operated in the area (illegally) until 1803, even after the area's becoming recognized as part of the United States. Other French and British fortifications, such as Fort St. Charles, had existed in the region but had been abandoned much earlier.|$|E
5|$|The {{events of}} the early morning of June 28, 1969 were not the first {{instances}} of homosexuals fighting back against police in New York City and elsewhere. Not only had the Mattachine Society been active in major cities such as Los Angeles and Chicago, but similarly marginalized people started the riot at Compton's Cafeteria in 1966, and another riot responded to a raid on Los Angeles' Black Cat Tavern in 1967. However, several circumstances were in place that made the Stonewall riots memorable. The location of the raid was a factor: it was {{across the street from}} The Village Voice offices, and the narrow crooked streets gave the rioters advantage over the police. Many of the participants and residents of Greenwich Village were involved in political organizations that were effectively able to mobilize a large and cohesive gay community {{in the weeks and months}} after the rebellion. The most significant <b>facet</b> <b>of</b> the Stonewall riots, however, was the commemoration of them in Christopher Street Liberation Day, which grew into the annual Gay Pride events around the world.|$|E

40|$|AbstractPrior work on {{the cycle}} polytopes P(M) of binary matroids M has almost {{exclusively}} concentrated on regular matroids. Yet almost all binary matroids are nonregular, and almost nothing is known about their cycle polytopes. In this paper we introduce a class of binary matroids Lk,k⩾ 1, the complete binary matroids of order k. We show that the <b>facets</b> <b>of</b> the cycle polytopes P(Lk) have a rather simple description which {{may be used to}} deduce easily some, and in principle all, <b>facets</b> <b>of</b> the cycle polytopes of general binary matroids M. For this reason we call the polytopes P(Lk) master polytopes. Specifically, we describe two methods by which <b>facets</b> <b>of</b> P(M) can be deduced from the <b>facets</b> <b>of</b> certain master polytopes. One method produces a complete description of P(M) but is not computationally efficient. The other one produces a subset <b>of</b> the <b>facets</b> <b>of</b> P(M) by an efficient lifting procedure...|$|R

5|$|The Stonesfield Slate {{material}} {{contains no}} neck vertebrae; {{but a single}} broken anterior cervical vertebra is known from the New Park Quarry, specimen BMNH R9674. The breakage reveals large internal air chambers. The vertebra is also otherwise heavily pneumatised, with large pleurocoels, pneumatic excavations, on its sides. The rear <b>facet</b> <b>of</b> the centrum is strongly concave. The neck ribs are short. The front dorsal vertebrae are slightly opisthocoelous, with convex front centrum facets and concave rear centrum facets. They are also deeply keeled, with the ridge on the underside representing about 50% of the total centrum height. The front dorsals perhaps have a pleurocoel above the diapophysis, the lower rib joint process. The rear dorsal vertebrae, according to Benson, are not pneumatised. They are slightly amphicoelous, with hollow centrum facets. They have secondary joint processes, forming a hyposphene–hypantrum complex, the hyposphene having a triangular transverse cross-section. The height of the dorsal spines of the rear dorsals is unknown, but a high spine on a tail vertebra of the New Park Quarry material, specimen BMNH R9677, suggests {{the presence of a}} crest on the hip area. The spines of the five vertebrae of the sacrum form a supraneural plate, fused at the top. The undersides of the sacral vertebrae are rounded but the second sacral is keeled; normally it is the third or fourth sacral having a ridge. The sacral vertebrae seem not to be pneumatised but have excavations at their sides. The tail vertebrae are slightly amphicoelous, with hollow centrum facets on both the front and rear side. They have excavations at their sides and a longitudinal groove on the underside. The neural spines of the tail basis are transversely thin and tall, representing {{more than half of the}} total vertebral height.|$|E
