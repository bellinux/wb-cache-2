She was laid down on 1 November 1902, {{launched}} on 29 August 1903, and completed in October 1905, too late {{to participate in the}} Russo-Japanese War. Together with the battleship , she helped to suppress the Sveaborg Rebellion in 1906. Slava was assigned to a training squadron for new officers fresh from the Naval College that was formed after the Rebellion as part of the post-Tsushima naval reforms. On one of her training cruises to the Mediterranean, her crewmen rescued survivors during the 1908 Messina earthquake and the ship took casualties to Naples <b>for</b> <b>medical</b> <b>care.</b> She had a serious boiler accident in August 1910 and was towed by Tsesarevich to Gibraltar for temporary repairs before sailing to Toulon for repairs that required nearly a year to complete.

5|$|The {{following}} year, {{bilateral relations}} between Thailand and Cambodia became strained due to overlapping claims {{on the land}} area surrounding Preah Vihear Temple. Sihanouk issued a communique in July 2008 emphasizing the Khmer architecture of the temple as well as ICJ's 1962 ruling of the temple in favour of Cambodia. In August 2009 Sihanouk stated that he would stop posting messages on his personal website as he was getting old, {{making it difficult for}} him to keep up with his personal duties. Between 2009 and 2011, Sihanouk {{spent most of his time}} in Beijing <b>for</b> <b>medical</b> <b>care.</b> He made a final public appearance in Phnom Penh on his 89th birthday and 20th anniversary of the Paris Peace Accords on 30October 2011.

5|$|Many of the {{hospitals}} in Enugu are privately run. The UNTH and the National Orthopaedic Hospital are {{among some of}} the government controlled hospitals in the city. The medical equipment for the UNTH was upgraded in 2009 as well as parts of the hospital which were renovated in the same year. Most hospitals in the city suffer from a poor standard of medical facilities available to them; many of the city's citizens travel abroad <b>for</b> <b>medical</b> <b>care.</b> However, hospitals have been aided by foreign organisations and by Enugu's community at home and abroad who have donated medicine and other medical equipment. The most developed government hospital in Enugu is the Park Lane Hospital. The governor has said that the state has bought some ambulance service vehicles in March 2010. Enugu State has established free medical care for pregnant women and for all children under 5 years of age in the state. The child healthcare programme, founded under the District Health System (DHS), was added to the states 2008 budget. Enugu State has a HIV/AIDS prevalence of 6.5%, one of the highest in the country.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} the battle the American wounded were loaded onto wagons and carried back to Fort Harrison <b>for</b> <b>medical</b> <b>care.</b> Most of the militia was {{released}} from duty on November 9 and returned home, {{but many of the}} long-time soldiers remained in the area a bit longer. In his initial report to Secretary William Eustis, Harrison informed him of a battle having occurred near the Tippecanoe River, giving the battle the river's name; he added that he feared an imminent reprisal. The first dispatch did not make clear which side had won the conflict, and the secretary interpreted it as a defeat. The follow-up dispatch made the United States victory clear, and the defeat of Tecumseh's confederacy became more certain when no second attack occurred. Eustis replied with a lengthy note demanding to know why Harrison had not taken adequate precautions in fortifying his camp. Harrison replied that he had considered the position strong enough without fortification. This dispute was the catalyst of a disagreement between Harrison and the Department of War; as a result, he resigned from the army in 1814.|$|E
