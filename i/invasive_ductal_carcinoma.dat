40|$|Background: While Snail is a zinc-finger {{transcription}} factor that triggers the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, {{it has also}} been reported to be indirectly regulated by estrogen receptor a (ERa) and {{to be involved in the}} transcriptional repression of the aromatase gene. The aim of the present study was to examine the role of Snail expression in node-negative <b>invasive</b> <b>ductal</b> <b>carcinomas.</b> Methods: We analyzed Snail mRNA expression levels in 86 node-negative <b>invasive</b> <b>ductal</b> <b>carcinomas</b> by real-time quantitative RT–PCR and studied whether Snail mRNA expression correlates with clinicopathological factors. Results: No correlation was found between Snail mRNA expression and ERa protein expression levels. However, we observed that none of the 34 patients showing low Snail mRNA expression developed distant metastasis while 6 of 52 (12 %) showing high expression of Snail mRNA did. The level of Snail mRNA expression was not found to be significantly correlated with clinico-pathological factors. No inverse correlation was found between the Snail and aromatase mRNA expression levels in our series. Conclusion: Our data show that low expression of Snail mRNA is a good prognostic factor in node-negative <b>invasive</b> <b>ductal</b> <b>carcinomas.</b> Snail expression is suggested to be involved in distant metastasis in node-negative <b>invasive</b> <b>ductal</b> <b>carcinomas.</b> Key words: Snail – estrogen receptor – E-cadherin – breast cancer – aromatas...|$|R

40|$|ARID 1 A (AT-rich {{interactive}} domain 1 A) {{has recently}} {{been identified as a}} tumor suppressor gene. Its mRNA expression is significantly low in many breast cancers; this is often associated with more aggressive phenotypes. However, the underlying molecular mechanism for its low expression has not been fully understood. This study was undertaken to evaluate the contribution of gene copy number variation, mutations, promoter methylation and histone modification to ARID 1 A’s low expression. 38 pairs of breast <b>invasive</b> <b>ductal</b> <b>carcinomas</b> and their normal breast tissue counterparts from the same patients were randomly selected for gene expression and copy number variation detection. Promoter methylation and histone modification levels were evaluated by MeDIP-qPCR and ChIP-qPCR, respectively. PCR product Sanger sequencing was carried out to detect the exon mutation rate. Twenty-two out of 38 <b>invasive</b> <b>ductal</b> <b>carcinomas</b> in the study (57. 9 %) revealed ARID 1 A mRNA low expression by realtime RT-PCR. The relative promoter methylation level was, significantly higher in ARID 1 A mRNA low expression group compared with its high expression group (p, 0. 001). In the low expression group, nineteen out of 22 <b>invasive</b> <b>ductal</b> <b>carcinomas</b> (86. 4 %) exhibited ARID 1 A promoter hypermthylation. In addition, the promoter hypermethylation was accompanied with repressive histone modification (H 3 K 27 Me 3).

40|$|International audienceGerm-line {{alterations}} of BRCA 1 {{are responsible}} for about 50 % of familial breast cancers. Although its biological function(s) {{has not yet been}} fully determined, {{it has been suggested that}} it may act as a tumor suppressor gene in breast and ovarian cancers. In sporadic breast cancers alterations of BRCA 1 have not been detected and in vitro experiments have indicated that BRCA 1 negatively regulates cellular proliferation. The present study was designed to identify and quantify, the BRCA 1 mRNA levels, in normal and neoplasic human breast tissue. BRCA 1 mRNA molecules were quanti®ed using competitive reverse transcriptase PCR assays. DNA methylation patterns of this gene have been analysed by Southern blot experiments using methylation sensitive restriction enzymes. We found that BRCA 1 mRNA levels were signi®cantly lower in sporadic breast cancers (37 cases analysed, 24 cases of <b>invasive</b> <b>ductal</b> <b>carcinomas</b> not otherwise speci®ed (NOS), two lobular carcinomas in situ two medullary carcinomas, four invasive lobular carcinomas, two invasive mucinous <b>carcinomas</b> and three <b>invasive</b> <b>ductal</b> <b>carcinomas</b> with predominantly in situ component) compared with normal breast tissues (P= 0. 0003). This down-regulation of BRCA 1 is observed in all histologic types analysed.

40|$|Expression of c-erbB 3 protein was {{investigated}} in 104 primary breast carcinomas comprising nine comedo <b>ductal</b> <b>carcinoma</b> in situ (DCIS), 91 <b>invasive</b> <b>ductal</b> <b>carcinomas</b> and four <b>invasive</b> lobular carcinomas using two monoclonal antibodies, RTJ 1 and RTJ 2. Of the 91 <b>invasive</b> <b>ductal</b> <b>carcinomas,</b> seven contained the comedo DCIS component adjacent to the invasive component. An immunohistochemical technique {{was used to evaluate}} the association between expression of c-erbB 3 and clinical parameters and tumour markers such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), c-erbB 2, cathepsin-D and p 53 in archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumour tissues. Our results indicated that RTJ 1 and RTJ 2 gave identical staining patterns and concordant results. It was found that the overexpression of c-erbB 3 protein was observed in 67 % (6 / 9) of comedo DCIS, 52 % (44 / 84) of <b>invasive</b> <b>ductal</b> <b>carcinomas,</b> 71 % (5 / 7) of carcinomas containing both the in situ and invasive lesions and 25 % (1 / 4) of invasive lobular carcinomas. A significant relationship (P < 0. 05) was observed between strong immunoreactivity of c-erbB 3 protein and histological grade, EGFR and cathepsin-D, but not with expression of c-erbB 2, p 53, oestrogen receptor status, lymph node metastases or age of patient. However, we noted that a high percentage of oestrogen receptor-negative tumours (59 %), lymph node-positive tumours (63 %) and c-erbB 2 (63 %) were strongly positive for c-erbB 3 protein. We have also documented that a high percentage of EGFR (67 %), c-erbB 2 (67 %), p 53 (75 %) and cathepsin-D-positive DCIS (60 %) were strongly positive for c-erbB 3.

Methods Immunohistochemical analysis was performed to evaluate the ASK 1 protein expression and the correlation between ASK 1, claudin- 6 and clinicopathological features in 85 samples of breast <b>invasive</b> <b>ductal</b> <b>carcinomas</b> (IDC). Western blotting and RT-PCR was carried out to examine the expression of ASK 1 and claudin- 6 in MCF- 7 cell clones transfected with claudin- 6.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Aberrant {{expression}} of individual matrix metalloproteinases {{has been associated}} with poor prognosis in various human carcinomas. The current study aimed at defining an RNA expression profile of various MMPs in breast cancer and correlating their expression with clinicopathological parameters. METHODS: The RNA expression patterns of 6 MMPs (MMP 2, MMP 8, MMP 9, MMP 10, MMP 11, MMP 13) were determined in 25 breast carcinomas using quantitative RT-PCR and correlated with clinicopathological parameters, including menopausal status, tumor size and grade, and lymph node involvement. RESULTS: We observed high MMP 2 levels more frequently in premenopausal than in postmenopausal women (p= 0. 02). Analysis of luminal A type <b>invasive</b> <b>ductal</b> <b>carcinomas</b> (19 / 25), revealed an even stronger association of MMP 2 with menopausal status (p= 0. 005). Within this subgroup, we also found a correlation between MMP 11 and menopausal status (p= 0. 02). No correlation was found between MMP expressions and other clinicopathological parameters. In co-expression analyses MMP 2 -MMP 10 and MMP 8 -MMP 9 showed a weak correlation of their expression. CONCLUSIONS: Although this is a pilot study, our findings indicate that luminal A <b>invasive</b> <b>ductal</b> <b>carcinomas</b> commonly express high MMP 2 and MMP 11 levels in premenopausal breast cancer patients and suggest a co-regulation of MMP 2 -MMP 10 and MMP 8 -MMP 9. status: publishe...|$|R
