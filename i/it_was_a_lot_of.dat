Popjustice saw the music video in progress on October 22, 2008, in the edit they reported that the music video was produced on a green screen, but the concept of the video was to be Aguilera in an edit suite pressing various flashing buttons, editing what was her own music video. Aguilera herself discussed the production of the video, saying [...] "I really enjoyed making the video for 'Keeps Gettin' Better', being an artist who likes to play around with different looks, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> fun to portray various characters within the same shoot."

I would drop the stick down and go, [...] "I can't do it!" [...] And she would {{encourage}} me. She's so supportive. We did a month, and then the day before the cameras turned on, we would go through the moves a couple of times so we wouldn't hurt each other. There were a few times we clipped each other. I remember getting her in the stomach really bad one time, and she nearly cut my ear off at one point. It was fun. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> fun, but we were exhausted as well." ...|$|E
500|$|Mulan {{served as}} Wen's first voice-acting role. In an {{interview}} with IGN, the actress elaborated on the recording process, specifically {{the fact that she}} was required to record the majority of the character's dialogue in isolation, saying, [...] "I just loved the story so much and identified so much with the character of Mulan it was easy for me. I loved using my imagination. I felt like I was a little kid again, being silly with an imaginary sword and riding on an imaginary horse and talking to an imaginary dragon. So <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> fun for me." [...] In spite of the fact that, throughout the film, Mulan shares several intimate scenes with her guardian, a miniature Chinese dragon named Mushu who is voiced by American actor and comedian Eddie Murphy, Wen and her co-star never actually encountered each other while working on Mulan due to the fact that they recorded their respective dialogue at separate times in separate locations.|$|E

In August, Ice {{performed}} at the 2011 Gathering of the Juggalos, where it was officially announced that he had signed with Psychopathic Records. His sixth studio album, WTF, was released on August 19 through Radium Records. While the record featured an array of different styles, like other recent Vanilla Ice albums, it also featured Ice's return to Electronica, with songs like [...] "Turn It Up", [...] "Rock Star Party", [...] "Nightmare Disco" [...] and [...] "Cadillac Ninjas". On the new record and its numerous musical genres, Ice was quoted saying [...] "It's like techno hip-hop. European.

Describing the character, Natasha Norton from AfterEllen stated [...] "She comes across at first as a touch flighty, as if she can't quite make up her mind as to who she wants to be, but it soon becomes abundantly clear that Lana's carefully constructed façade has a purpose." [...] Following her arrival in Erinsborough, Lana befriended Serena Bishop (Lara Sacher). They both learned that they had been taken advantage of by [...] "sleazy" [...] photographer Chris Cousens (Simon Mallory). Serena's cousin, Sky, took an instant dislike to Lana. Sky had learned that Lana had flirted with her boyfriend, leaving her [...] "less than impressed". During a game of basketball, Sky began feuding with Lana, and they started a brawl on the court. Of filming the fight, Neval stated, [...] "We wanted to make it look spontaneous, and really gritty and brawly. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> fun learning how to choreograph a fight and how {{to be aware of the}} other actor and not actually hurt them." ...|$|E

Its steampunk-like, retro-futuristic weapons were created by the weapon designer Simon Boucherie and Wirkola, who said they wanted Hansel and Gretel's weapons {{to look as if}} the characters hand-made them. Wirkola stated he [...] "just wanted this crazy, mashed-up world where you can’t pinpoint where it is, or when it is" [...] and the modern elements are there to [...] "add to the fun and tone of the film." [...] He said, [...] "We wanted the movie to feel timeless and for the movie to feel like a fairy tale, but still grounded. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> fun coming up with the different weapon designs and ways of killing witches.

500|$|Gillian Anderson's {{character}} Dana Scully {{would not}} be available, since the writing staff had decided before the episode was written that she would spend {{most of her time}} in the hospital. As the writing staff had a hard time coming up with a story, Spotnitz saw {{this as an opportunity to}} further evolve Doggett, the new character introduced at the beginning of the eighth season. In order to fill Anderson's void, two recurring groups of characters were brought in: Walter Skinner and The Lone Gunmen. Spotnitz noted that, [...] "we were eager to get Skinner out from behind the desk, and we were always looking for opportunities to get him out of that office and get him into the field." [...] Mitch Pileggi, who portrayed Walter Skinner, was pleased with the final product. He later complimented the work of Robert Patrick, who played Doggett, saying, [...] "It was a big hole when Mulder was gone, but I thought that Robert came in and did a wonderful job. He brought a really good energy to the set, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> fun getting to know and work with him." [...] In addition, Spotnitz was also eager to use The Lone Gunmen in the episode, since this the episode would mark their first scene together with Doggett. [...] Robert Patrick called the episode his [...] "favorite episode," [...] because the writers saw a chance to really create a [...] "vulnerable" [...] moment for the his character, John Doggett.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally mixed critical reception. The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin {{found the}} episode less enjoyable than [...] "Lee Marvin vs. Derek Jeter". He explained {{that when he}} first learned that the show would tackle the Jay Leno and Conan O'Brien situation [...] "I {{felt a surge of}} excitement and optimism. I thought the writers would come up with a smart new angle to attack the imbroglio", but after the airing he noted the janitor plot only hampered the episode. Rabin, however, enjoyed Tracy's actions in the episode, commenting that it [...] "provided a showcase for some great Tracy Morgan non-sequiturs". Emily Exton of Entertainment Weekly also found [...] "Khonani" [...] the weaker of the two episodes, and also believed that the [...] "late-night jokes felt tired". Television columnist Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger disliked the episode, and as a result he noted in his recap that he would remove 30 Rock from the rotation of shows for which he always did detailed reviews. Willa Paskin of New York magazine wrote had the show make reference to the Leno and O'Brien debacle a few months ago [...] "this would have been a cutting-edge satire... Now, not so much." [...] Jason Hughes of TV Squad remarked that the writing in [...] "Khonani" [...] was sharp, though added that [...] "for some reason" [...] the episode [...] "didn't ring nearly as sharp or funny as many others. I think <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> unfulfilled potential." [...] Sean Gandert of Paste magazine deemed this episode disappointing, but proclaimed [...] "it was still entertaining enough." ...|$|E

Like maybe her wound is going to fester – like The Hound." [...] She continued, [...] "There was this constant spectrum of conversation with Mark Mylod during the chase of about how petrified she needs to look, but also how safe she is. Arya's been very lucky with the people she's encountered so far. The whole time she was with The Hound she took a back seat because he was really good. So I wanted her to look like she was struggling." [...] Williams also stated that she gave input on how the scene should take place, stating [...] "I didn't want the chase stunt to be unnecessary or superhuman. I got on set {{and they were going to}} have Arya rolling around, and diving, and I was like, [...] "That looks amazing, but no." [...] I'd be like, [...] "Why would she run over there? She'd just duck under here and just get out." [...] It doesn’t look quite as cinematic, maybe, but they'll have to find something else if they want cinematic. And I felt awful because the job of the stunt guys is to make everything look as crazy and cool as possible. But I know Arya now. In the beginning <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> guesswork and now I've figured her out." ...|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Greg Hernandez, Mills explained: [...] "I {{knew that she was}} going to be a trouble maker but actually knowing the writers and the producers, I knew that the character would be rounded and have dimension and that was really fun for me to play. It wasn’t one-note all the time, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> different colors." [...] Television personality Julie Chen said, [...] "The women of Knots, Michele Lee, Joan Van Ark, and Donna Mills have been compared to earth, wind, and fire, with Donna Mills bringing the heat as Abby, the conniving vixen that everybody loved to hate." [...] According to Mills, many people were wary of meeting her in person because they assumed she would be like Abby. She said, [...] "They were very trepedacious about what I was going to do." [...] Mike Celizic of NBC said that her character was [...] "the archetypal predatory female", while Meredith Vieira said [...] "even the bad girl could show a tender side every once in a while", in reference to her daughter's on-screen drug addiction. It was this very storyline that showed Abby at her most vulnerable and human, a story which audiences recall as perhaps one of her most desperate and motherly of moments. In addition to that, Abby also helped Val get her kidnapped babies back, even though she was blamed she said she [...] "could never do a thing like that to anyone". When Karen and Mack began to have some problems in their marriage and Karen distanced herself from Mack, Abby confronted Karen aggressively and told her she was wrong for doing so to him.|$|E

[...] At the New York City screening of the DVD, Beyoncé further explained that she was completely [...] "hands-on", deciding which moments made the final cut and which ones wound up on the cutting-room floor, stating, [...] "It was hard work.
