40|$|Field {{operations}} in Alfisols and related soils require timeliness and precision {{for the early}} establishment of a crop in the rainy season. Animal-drawn, multipurpose wheeled tool carriers (WTCs) {{have been found to}} be the most appropriate machinery for this purpose. Three designs discussed in this paper covered 1 ha in 3 - 4 hours for different tillage operations, and could be drawn by a pair of oxen of average size. A WTC fitted with a planter-and-fertilizer applicator, consisting of an <b>inclined</b> <b>plate</b> for <b>seed</b> metering and 1416 oscillating mechanisms for fertilizer metering and a double-shoe furrow opener, gave excellent results in sowing various crops, and covered 1 ha in 4 - 5 hours with an average draft of 1530 N (156 kgf) for four rows. A rolling crust breaker, developed to enhance seedling emergence through the surface crust, gave good results. Intensive primary tillage of Alfisols showed advantages in the early stages of crop growth, but they tended to disappear late in the season. Results of tillage studies conducted for 4 years indicate a need for further research to find out the comparative advantages of different intensities of primary tillage during the cropping season and off-season...|$|R
40|$|A new <b>inclined</b> <b>plates</b> extractor-separator is {{developed}} for operation with immiscible liquids in which extraction and separation is achieved in one unit contrary to mixer settlers. The <b>inclined</b> <b>plates</b> extractor-separator combines turbulent jets for contacting, and an <b>inclined</b> <b>plate</b> {{for separation of}} the two phases. The <b>inclined</b> <b>plates</b> extractor-separator {{does not have any}} moving part inside the vessel. This feature makes it free from the mechanical problems associated with conventional apparatus. The proposed <b>inclined</b> <b>plates</b> extractor-separator was operated in batch mode under various operating conditions to evaluate its performance on the basis of extraction efficiency. Water (light phase) was used as solvent to extract ethyl acetate from a heavy phase pool of tetrachloroethylene and ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate content was analysed using chromatography. A hydrodynamic study was carried out using high speed photography to understand the mechanisms occurring during mass transfer across the two phases. Furthermore, {{it was found that the}} proposed <b>inclined</b> <b>plate</b> extractor-separator reduces the overall operating time by 67 % and consumes only 13 % of the power in comparison to a mixer-settler.

50|$|Another design variation, which {{improves}} {{the efficiency of}} the separation unit is the way the effluent enters the lamella clarifier. Standard clarifier design has the effluent entering {{at the bottom of the}} <b>inclined</b> <b>plates,</b> colliding with the sludge sliding down the plates. This mixing region renders the bottom 20% of the <b>inclined</b> <b>plates</b> unusable for settling. By designing the lamella clarifier so that the effluent enters the <b>inclined</b> <b>plates</b> without interfering with the downward slurry flow the capacity of the lamella clarifier can be improved by 25%.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{inserting}} <b>inclined</b> <b>plates</b> {{and using a}} polyelectrolyte on {{the improvement of the}} turbidity removal efficiency (TRE) in an upflow settling tank treating raw water from a river have been examined experimentally in a laboratory-scale setup. The <b>inclined</b> <b>plates</b> in the upper zone of the conventional upflow settling tank increased the hydraulic capacity and simultaneously improved the TRE. The maximum increase in the hydraulic capacity was 330 % and it was combined by a 7. 4 % improvement in the TRE. In comparison with the polyelectrolyte, the <b>inclined</b> <b>plates</b> decreased the variability in the TRE despite the increase in the surface overflow rate (SOR). The <b>inclined</b> <b>plates</b> enabled the operation at a higher upflow velocity and increased the TRE of the alum with polyelectrolyte-treated water by 6. 0 and 3. 0 % at SOR of 1. 0 and 3. 3 m 3 m 2 h- 1, respectively. The results indicated that the TRE of alum with <b>inclined</b> <b>plates</b> was almost identical to that of alum with polyelectrolyte though the numerical values were statistically different based on Tukey's multiple comparisons test at a 95 % confidence interval.

50|$|Typical lamella {{clarifier}} design {{consists of a}} series of <b>inclined</b> <b>plates</b> inside a vessel, see first figure. The untreated feed water stream enters {{from the top of the}} vessel and flows down a feed channel underneath the <b>inclined</b> <b>plates.</b> Water then flows up inside the clarifier between the <b>inclined</b> <b>plates.</b> During this time solids settle onto the plates and eventually fall to the bottom of the vessel. The route a particle takes will be dependent upon the flow rate of the suspension and the settling rate of the particle and can be seen in the second figure. At the bottom of the vessel a hopper or funnel collects these particles as sludge. Sludge may be continuously or intermittently discharged. Above the <b>inclined</b> <b>plates</b> all particles have settled and clarified water is produced which is drawn off into an outlet channel. The clarified water exits the system in an outlet stream.|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the total suspended solids (TSS) removal efficiency of a modified sedimentation tank to that of a conventional tank The experimental tank was designed for flow to pass over a series of <b>inclined</b> <b>plates.</b> It had a much shallower flow through zone and the <b>inclined</b> <b>plates</b> were situated just below this zone. The <b>inclined</b> <b>plates</b> were added to provide a quiescent settling zone for the falling particles and to act as a barrier to prevent scour of settled particles. A conventional horizontal flow sedimentation tank was also used in this study. The two designs were run in parallel and a highly concentrated clay suspension was passed through both tanks. The TSS concentrations of both the influence and effluent streams were measured. The response of both designs to different parameters such as sampling time, depth over the <b>inclined</b> <b>plates,</b> flowrate, <b>inclined</b> <b>plates</b> spacing and inlet TSS concentration was observed. The tank with the <b>inclined</b> <b>plates</b> (at the smallest spacing) proved to have an equal to slightly high removal efficiency and a slightly better reaction to the change of parameters. This tank also proved to have less dead volume than the control tank. Since the reduction in flow through volume proved to be as good and slightly better than the control tank the concept deserves further research. It has the potential to permit considerable tank depth reductions while retaining efficiency...|$|R

An ultrasonic sensor scanning method is developed based on this algorithm for the recognition of an <b>inclined</b> <b>plate</b> and to obtain the localization of the ultrasonic sensor relative to the <b>inclined</b> <b>plate</b> reference frame. The ultrasonic sensor scanning method is then leveraged for the omni-directional localization of a mobile robot, where the ultrasonic sensors are installed on a mobile robot and follow the spin of the robot, the <b>inclined</b> <b>plate</b> is recognized and the position and posture of the robot are acquired with respect to the coordinate system of the <b>inclined</b> <b>plate,</b> realizing the localization of the robot.

40|$|A {{significant}} increase in the particle sedimentation rate can be achieved by introducing <b>inclined</b> <b>plates</b> into conventional fluidised beds. In turn, high suspension densities are possible at fluidisation velocities in excess of the particle terminal velocity. The installation of the <b>inclined</b> <b>plates,</b> however, alters the dynamic characteristics of the fluidised bed, in particular, impacting upon the expansion behaviour of the suspension. In the present work a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) approach was employed to investigate the influence of <b>inclined</b> <b>plates</b> on the expansion behaviour of solids suspensions in liquid fluidised beds. The model is based on the solution of the Eulerian mpltiphase equations for up to two different particle sizes with a continuous phase of water. The momentum equations treat hindered settling behaviour via the inclusion of a volume fraction dependent drag law. The computational model was validated against our experimental data and compared with the predictions of a kinematic model developed in one of our earlier works. In general the predictions made by both the CFD and the kinematic models were found to be in good agreement with the experimental results. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
5000|$|The main {{advantage}} of lamella clarifiers over other clarifying systems {{is the large}} effective settling area caused {{by the use of}} <b>inclined</b> <b>plates,</b> which improves the operating conditions of the clarifiers in a number of ways. The unit is more compact usually requiring only 65-80 % of the area of clarifiers operating without <b>inclined</b> <b>plates.</b> [...] Therefore, where site footprint constraints are of concern a lamella clarifier system is preferred. The reduced required area allows the possibility for the clarifiers to be located and operated inside, reducing some of the common problems of algae growth, clogging due to blowing debris accumulation and odour control, that occur when the machinery is outdoors. Operation within an enclosed space also allows for a better control of operating temperature and pressure conditions. The <b>inclined</b> <b>plates</b> mean the clarifier can operate with overflow rates 2 to 4 times that of traditional clarifiers which allow a greater influent flow rate and thus a more time efficient clarification process. Lamella clarifiers also offer a simple design without requiring the use of chemicals. They are therefore able to act as pre-treatment for delicate membrane processes. Where necessary flocculants may be added to promote efficiency.|$|R

50|$|One {{variation}} on the standard design of a lamella clarifier being developed {{is the way the}} effluent is collected {{at the top of the}} <b>inclined</b> <b>plates.</b> Rather than the effluent flowing over the top of the <b>inclined</b> <b>plates</b> to the outlet channel it flows through orifices at the top of the plates. This design allows for more consistent back pressure in the channels between the plates and hence a more consistent flow profile develops. Obviously this design only works for relatively clean effluent streams as the orifices would quickly become blocked with deposits which would severely reduce the efficiency of the unit. Another new design includes an adjustable upper portion of the vessel so that vessel height can be changed. This height adjustment is relative to a deflector, which directs the inlet stream. This design intended to be used for decanting storm water.|$|R

40|$|Liquid films flowing {{down the}} {{underside}} of <b>inclined</b> <b>plates</b> {{are subject to the}} interaction between the hydrodynamic and the Rayleigh-Taylor (R-T) instabilities causing a patterned and wavy topology at the free surface. The R-T instability results from the denser liquid film being located above a less dense ambient gas, and deforming into an array of droplets, which eventually drip if no saturation mechanism arises. Such saturation mechanism can actually be provided by a fluid motion along the <b>inclined</b> <b>plate.</b> Using a weighted integral boundary layer model, this study examines the critical inclination angle, measured from the vertical, that separates regimes of absolute and convective instability. If the instability is of absolute type, growing perturbations stay localized in space potentially leading to dripping. If the instability is of convective type, growing perturbations move downwards the <b>inclined</b> <b>plate,</b> forming waves and eventually, but not necessarily, droplets. Remarkably, there is a minimum value of the critical angle below which a regime of absolute instability cannot exist. This minimum angle decreases with viscosity: It is about 85 ° for water, about 70 ° for silicon oil 20 times more viscous than water, and reaches a limiting value for liquid with a viscosity larger than about 1000 times the one of water. It results that for any fluid, absolute dripping can only exist for inclination angle (taken from the vertical) larger than 57. 4 °. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
