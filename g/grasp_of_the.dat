5|$|In {{his book}} King Solomon's Ring, Konrad Lorenz {{described}} and analysed the complex social interactions {{in a western}} jackdaw flock that lived around his house in Altenberg, Austria. He ringed them for identification and caged them in the winter to prevent their annual migration. He found that the birds have a linear hierarchical group structure, with higher-ranked individuals dominating lower-ranked birds, and pair-bonded birds sharing the same rank. Young males establish their individual status before pairing with females. Upon pairing, the female assumes the same social position as her partner. Unmated females are the lowest members in the pecking order, and are the last {{to have access to}} food and shelter. Lorenz noted one case in which a male, absent during the dominance struggles and pair bondings, returned to the flock, became the dominant male, and chose one of two unpaired females for a mate. This female immediately assumed a dominant position in the social hierarchy and demonstrated this by pecking others. According to Lorenz, the most significant factor in social behaviour was the immediate and intuitive <b>grasp</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new hierarchy by each of the western jackdaws in the flock.|$|E
5|$|On {{the grand}} {{strategic}} level Marlborough had a rare <b>grasp</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> broad issues involved, {{and was able}} {{from the start of}} the Spanish Succession war to see the conflict in its entirety. He was one of the few influences working towards genuine unity within the Grand Alliance, but the extension of the war aims to include the replacement of PhilipV as King of Spain was a fatal mistake. Marlborough stands accused – possibly for political and diplomatic reasons – of not pressing his private doubts about reinforcing failure. Spain proved a continuous drain of men and resources, and ultimately hampered his chances of complete success in Flanders, the war's main theatre. The Allies did come close to a complete victory on several occasions, but the increasingly severe conditions imposed upon LouisXIV forestalled an early end to hostilities. Although the Duke lost his political influence in the latter stages of the war he still possessed vast prestige abroad, yet his failure to communicate his innermost convictions to his allies or political masters means he must bear some responsibility for the continuance of the war beyond its logical conclusion.|$|E
30|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel cluster-tube self-adaptive robot hand (CTSA Hand). The CTSA Hand {{consists}} of a base, a motor, a transmission mechanism, multiple elastic tendons, {{and a group of}} sliding-tube assemblies. Each sliding-tube assembly is composed of a sliding tube, a guide rod, two springs and a hinge. When the hand grasping an object, the object pushes some sliding tubes to different positions according to <b>the</b> surface shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> object, the motor pulls the tendons tight to cluster tubes. The CTSA Hand can realize self-adaptive <b>grasping</b> <b>of</b> objects of different sizes and shapes. The CTSA Hand can grasp multiple objects simultaneously because <b>the</b> <b>grasping</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hand acts as many grippers in different directions and heights. <b>The</b> <b>grasping</b> forces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hand are adjusted by a closed-loop control system with potentiometer. Experimental results show that the CTSA Hand has <b>the</b> features <b>of</b> highly self-adaption and large grasping forces when grasping various objects.|$|R
