As a basic framework for defining the sector, the United Nations' International Standard Industrial Classification categorises health care as generally consisting of hospital activities, medical and <b>dental</b> <b>practice</b> <b>activities,</b> and [...] "other human health activities". The last class involves activities of, or under the supervision of, nurses, midwives, physiotherapists, scientific or diagnostic laboratories, pathology clinics, residential health facilities, patient advocates, or other allied health professions, e.g. {{in the field of}} optometry, hydrotherapy, medical massage, yoga therapy, music therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, chiropody, homeopathy, chiropractics, acupuncture, etc.|$|E
40|$|Background and Overview. Computers are {{becoming}} {{an integral part}} of the practice of dentistry. Smaller, smarter and more ergonomic computing devices will support an increasing proportion of <b>dental</b> <b>practice</b> <b>activities.</b> Technology will make practice management more efficient, mainly by reducing transactional overhead. Educational software and intelligent assistants will increasingly support the needs for decision making in clinical practice. Research will benefit from automated tools for data acquisition, management and analysis. Conclusions. Dentistry must actively shape the application of technology. It can do this by developing a cadre of experts in dental informatics, relying on sound research principles, effectively disseminating best practices and developing strategic objectives for the implementation of technology. Clinical Implications. Computer technology is an essential ingredient for state-of-the-art patient care. Dentists must stay current with this rapidly developing field to make appropriate choices in their use of technology...|$|E
40|$|Objective:  Many {{students}} have paid employment while studying. In the Netherlands, the Individual Health Care Professions Act (IHCP Act) allows dental hygiene {{students to work}} under certain conditions in a dental practice. The aim {{of the study was}} to determine how many dental hygiene {{students have}} part-time job employment in dental practice and which professional tasks they carry out. We also asked the dental hygiene students their opinion of the IHCP Act. Methods:  All the enrolled dental hygiene students (n = 341) at a School of Health in the Netherlands received a questionnaire by email. Results:  The response was 52 % (176 students). Of the responding students, 75 % had paid employment in addition to their study. A proportion of the students (35 %) worked in a dental practice. The median number of hours worked per week was eight. Study year, age and prior education were positively related to working part-time in <b>dental</b> <b>practice.</b> <b>Activities</b> frequently performed were giving oral hygiene instruction, fluoride applications, scaling and root planning, providing chair side assistance and giving local anaesthesia. Although the self-reported knowledge about the IHCP Act was high, almost half of the students expressed the need for more detailed legal information. Conclusions:  Many dental hygiene students work in a dental practice, taking over a number of tasks usually performed by the dentist. More information in the dental hygiene curriculum about the requirements of the IHCP Act seems desirable...|$|E

Direct observation of practice characteristics, procedures performed, and how procedure and nonprocedure time was utilized during patient visits was recorded using a modified Davis Observation Code that classified patient contact time into 24 behavioral categories. Dentist, hygienist, and patient characteristics were gathered by questionnaire. The most common nonprocedure behaviors observed for dentists were chatting, evaluation feedback, history taking, and answering patient questions. Hygienists added preventive counseling. We distinguish between preventive procedures and counseling in actual dental offices that {{are members of a}} practice-based research network. Almost a third of the dentist&rsquo;s and half of the hygienist&rsquo;s patient contact time is utilized for nonprocedure behaviors during patient encounters.

40|$|Objective:  In the Netherlands, the Individual Health Care Professions Act (IHCP Act) allows dental students, amongst other non-qualified individuals, to {{work under}} certain {{conditions}} in a dental practice. The aim {{of the study was}} to determine how many dental students have part-time employment in dental practice and which professional tasks they carry out. We also asked the dental students their opinion about the IHCP Act. Material and methods:  All the enrolled dental students at the Academic Centre for Dentistry Amsterdam (ACTA) in the Netherlands received a questionnaire by e-mail. Within 1 month, two reminders were sent. Results:  The response was 44 % (427 students). Of the responding students, 71 % had paid employment in addition to their study. Twenty-five per cent of all students worked in a dental practice, usually 8 h a week. Study year and age were positively related to working part-time in <b>dental</b> <b>practice.</b> <b>Activities</b> frequently performed were providing chair side assistance, giving oral hygiene instruction, fluoride applications, scaling and root planning.

40|$|Received: 29 September 2015 Objective: To examine age, {{period and}} cohort factors of dentists in {{relation}} to diagnostic, preventive and total dental services over time in Australia. Method: The Longitudinal Study of Dentists' <b>Practice</b> <b>Activity</b> (LSDPA) was designed to monitor <b>dental</b> <b>practice</b> <b>activity</b> and service provision in Australia. Participating dentists were sampled randomly from the dental registers in Australia from 1983 to 1984, and dental services provision was collected by mailed questionnaire with a log of dental services provided over one or two typical days. The data collection has been repeated every 5 years until 2009 - 2010. Sample supplementation of newly registered dentists occurred at successive waves. This study focused on diagnostic, preventive and total services. The time trends in the mean rates of the services were described using a standard cohort table, and negative binomial regression was applied to estimate age, period and cohort effects. Results: The response rates were 73 %, 75 %, 74 %, 71 %, 76 % and 67 % in 1983, 1988, 1993, 1998, 2003 and 2009, respectively. The mean rates of diagnostic, preventive and total services increased between 1983 and 2009 across all age groups. The period effect showed {{a higher rate of}} diagnostic (rate ratios [RR]: 1. 21 in 1993 to 1. 80 in 2009), preventive (RR: 1. 19 in 1988 to 1. 85 in 2009) and the total service (RR: 1. 08 in 1988 to 1. 39 in 2009) over time, compared with the reference group of 1983. Older cohorts had a lower rate, and the younger cohorts had a higher rate of diagnostic, preventive and the total number of services over the study period. The highest rate of diagnostic (RR= 2. 53), preventive (RR= 2. 44) and the total service (RR= 1. 52) was in those aged 25 - 29 years in 1983 compared with the reference group of 30 - 34 years in 1983. Conclusions: Trends in dental services provision can be associated with age, period and cohort effects. The study found the rate of diagnostic, preventive and total services increased over time. Meanwhile, an increasing rate of diagnostic, preventive and the total services was observed when moving from older cohorts to younger cohorts among Australian dentists suggesting a sustained shift towards these services into the future.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to perform an {{estimation}} of the <b>dental</b> <b>practice</b> production process. This estimation provides information on the contributions of each input to dental production and the type of returns to scale exhibited by <b>dental</b> <b>practices.</b> Previous studies in this area have presented contradictory results and conclusions concerning input contributions and returns to scale. In addition, these studies have been based on data sets where the individual dentist, not the <b>dental</b> <b>practice,</b> is the unit of observation. The present study uses data collected on a <b>dental</b> <b>practice</b> basis and estimates a <b>dental</b> <b>practice</b> production function and the reduced form direct cost function, and indirect cost, revenue, and profit functions. ^ Estimation of the production function was performed using both patient visits and gross billings as measures of output. Dentist hours, staff hours, and operatories per practice were the input measures. Staff hours represents the grouping of all non-dentist labor inputs into one category. ^ The estimation results of the <b>dental</b> <b>practice</b> production function found that <b>dental</b> <b>practices</b> exhibit constant returns to scale. A test was performed to determine if there were statistically significant differences between the estimated coefficients of solo and nonsolo practices. The test found no significant differences. This study also found a systematic variation across estimated coefficients when patient visits and gross billings were used as output measures. The coefficient of dentist hours is higher with patient visits as output, while the coefficient of staff hours is always higher with gross billings. The present study presents an explanation for this variation based on the more frequent occurrence of multiple service visits as more staff are employed. These results have implications for public and private policy regarding the organization and use of inputs in the dental production process. ^ Estimation of the reduced forms presented reasonable results only for the direct cost function, which indicated that <b>dental</b> <b>practices</b> exhibit increasing returns to scale. These results are not conclusive, but demonstrate the uncertainty that exists in dental production research and the need for further investigation of alternative methods. ...|$|R
