Given the existing relationship of sharing technologies and innovations, Mitsubishi accepted Hyundai's request to share a platform, internal configuration, and most importantly, an engine. As Hyundai was an official sponsor of 1988 Seoul Olympics, it used this opportunity to notify all the executives and important people about their new car, the Grandeur. Because of its Mitsubishi basis and good quality, it became very popular in Korea.|$|E

25|$|Type I IFNs form {{a family}} of several proteins: in humans, there are 13 α subtypes, 1 β subtype, 1 ω subtype and other less studied subtypes (κ and ε). IFNα2 was the first subtype to be {{characterized}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>eighties.</b> As a result, IFNα2 was widely used in basic research to elucidate biological activities, structure and mechanism of action of type I IFNs. IFNα2 {{was also the first}} IFN to be produced by the pharmaceutical industry for use as a drug. Thereby, IFNα2 is the best known type I IFN subtype. The properties of IFNα2 are widely shared by the other type I IFNs, although subtle differences exist.|$|E
25|$|Kelly's {{career is}} {{remarkable}} {{in that it}} spanned the eras of several legends of the Tour de France, from Eddy Merckx through to Miguel Indurain.

25|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>eighties,</b> An Bord Pleanála finally granted {{permission}} for its wings to be demolished. In 1981, it {{was stripped of}} its wings. These constituted {{seventy percent of the}} house. The essential conditions that called for the restoration {{of the rest of the}} house were subsequently ignored. When the wings were demolished, nothing was done to prop up the remainder of the house. Despite this, the building was still structurally safe. The Corporation had argued that the proposed development was unsuitable for the area. Once Roches had completed their Department Store, the conservationists had no legal leg to stand on, since permission to demolish the house was effective once permission to develop the site had been granted. They became unwilling to negotiate with the conservationists. Roches declared that Frescati was beyond restoration. Marie Avis Walker pointed out that the British Embassy in Merrion Square, which had been gutted by fire, had been restored.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{response}} for [...] "Oh Father" [...] was generally positive. J.

Rooksby believed that the [...] "psychobabble" [...] phrases of feeling good about oneself in the song, {{would have made it}} extremely popular <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>Eighties.</b> He added that [...] "Oh Father" [...] was the most compassionate and generous moment in Madonna's musical career and the track might have inspired the exploration of childhood in the music of contemporary artists like Kate Bush and Tori Amos, in particular Bush's song [...] "The Fog" [...] from her 1989 studio album, The Sensual World, and Amos' [...] "Winter" [...] from the 1992 effort, Little Earthquakes. [...] Author Leslie C. Dunn wrote in her book Embodied Voices, that the autobiographical nature of the song brought forth a new side of Madonna. Sharing the same view, Freya Jarman-Ivens, {{one of the authors of}} Madonna's Drowned Worlds, declared [...] "Oh Father" [...] as a powerful statement regarding father-daughter relationships. Allen Metz, author of The Madonna Companion, described the song as a [...] "stark ballad with a serious string arrangement". O'Brien felt that the strings were dramatic and pretentious. She described Madonna's singing as consisting of [...] "Courtney Love-style rasp" [...] and adding that Madonna [...] "attacks the song with personal passion".|$|E
