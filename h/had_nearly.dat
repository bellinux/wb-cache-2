5|$|The {{blue whale}} rose from {{relative}} obscurity in the 1970s, {{after the release}} of the Songs of the Humpback Whale.

Environmentalists developed the image of a lonely blue whale singing out in an empty ocean, since whalers <b>had</b> <b>nearly</b> hunted the species to extinction.|$|E

5|$|As {{with nearly}} all primates, strepsirrhines {{typically}} reside in tropical rainforests.

Several species of lemur are found in drier, seasonal forests, including the spiny forest on {{the southern tip of}} the island, although the lemur communities in these regions are not as rich.|$|E
5|$|By mid-November, the Germans <b>had</b> <b>nearly</b> taken Stalingrad in bitter street {{fighting}} {{when the}} Soviets began their second winter counter-offensive, starting with an encirclement of German forces at Stalingrad and {{an assault on}} the Rzhev salient near Moscow, though the latter failed disastrously. By early February 1943, the German Army had taken tremendous losses; German troops at Stalingrad had been forced to surrender, and the front-line had been pushed back beyond its position before the summer offensive. In mid-February, after the Soviet push had tapered off, the Germans launched another attack on Kharkov, creating a salient in their front line around the Russian city of Kursk.|$|E

5|$|In 1809, Sharp {{was elected}} to {{represent}} Warren County in the Kentucky House of Representatives.

5|$|In 1849, a {{few years}} before his death in 1852, Mantell {{realised}} that iguanodonts were not heavy, pachyderm-like animals, as Owen was putting forward, but had slender forelimbs; however, his passing left him unable to participate {{in the creation of the}} Crystal Palace dinosaur sculptures, and so Owen's vision of the dinosaurs became that seen by the public for decades. With Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins, he <b>had</b> <b>nearly</b> two dozen lifesize sculptures of various prehistoric animals built out of concrete sculpted over a steel and brick framework; two iguanodonts (based on the Mantellodon specimen), one standing and one resting on its belly, were included. Before the sculpture of the standing iguanodont was completed, he held a banquet for twenty inside it.|$|E
5|$|Jaco Van Dormael {{was born}} in Ixelles. Belgium, on 9 February 1957 to a Belgian couple. Van Dormael was raised in Germany until age seven, when his family {{returned}} to Belgium.

This trauma accounts for the recurring themes in his films, which explore the worlds of people with mental and physical disabilities.|$|E
