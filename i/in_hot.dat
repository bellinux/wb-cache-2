5|$|All cacti {{have some}} adaptations to promote {{efficient}} water use. Most cacti—opuntias and cactoids—specialize in surviving <b>in</b> <b>hot</b> and dry environments (i.e. they are xerophytes), {{but the first}} ancestors of modern cacti were already adapted to periods of intermittent drought. A small number of cactus species in the tribes Hylocereeae and Rhipsalideae have become adapted to life as climbers or epiphytes, often in tropical forests, where water conservation is less important.|$|E
5|$|As a result, most geysers form {{in places}} where there is {{volcanic}} rhyolite rock which dissolves <b>in</b> <b>hot</b> water and forms mineral deposits called siliceous sinter, or geyserite, along {{the inside of the}} plumbing systems which are very slender. Over time, these deposits strengthen the channel walls by cementing the rock together tightly, thus enabling the geyser to persist, as mentioned in the previous section.|$|E

5|$|Palladium is a soft silver-white {{metal that}} resembles {{platinum}}. It {{is the least}} dense and has the lowest melting point of the platinum group metals. It is soft and ductile when annealed and is greatly increased in strength and hardness when cold-worked. Palladium dissolves slowly in concentrated nitric acid, <b>in</b> <b>hot,</b> concentrated sulfuric acid, and when finely ground, in hydrochloric acid. It dissolves readily at room temperature in aqua regia.|$|E

5|$|Boletus edulis is {{well suited}} to drying—its flavour intensifies, it is easily reconstituted, and its {{resulting}} texture is pleasant. Reconstitution is done by soaking <b>in</b> <b>hot,</b> but not boiling, water for about twenty minutes; the water used is infused with the mushroom aroma and it too {{can be used in}} subsequent cooking. Dried porcini have more protein than most other commonly consumed vegetables apart from soybeans. Some of this content is indigestible, though digestibility is improved with cooking.|$|E
5|$|Carl von Sickingen {{researched}} platinum {{extensively in}} 1772.

Franz Karl Achard made the first platinum crucible in 1784. He worked with the platinum by fusing it with arsenic, then later volatilizing the arsenic.|$|E
