5|$|The third (and final) {{practice}} session {{started with a}} morning sleet shower and Anthony Davidson in Toyota's No. 5 entry drove off the circuit at Luffield turn. Davidson later aquaplaned backwards off the track and into the Chapel corner <b>gravel</b> <b>trap.</b> The session was stopped to allow the stricken Toyota to be extracted from the <b>gravel</b> <b>trap</b> and and {{it was able to}} return to the pit lane with assistance from a recovery crane, allowing on-track action to recommence. Sleet later turned to snow necessitating track officials to stop the session for the second time. Driver adviser Yannick Dalmas was asked to assess the track's condition during the stoppage and gave feedback that prompted the session's premature end with half an hour remaining. Eleven cars took to the track but nobody recorded a timed lap. Tincknell completed the most out-laps of any driver in the session with three.|$|E
5|$|The drivers took to {{the track}} at 09;30 Central European Summer Time (UTC+2) for a 30-minute warm-up session. It took place in dry weather conditions. Both Williams drivers {{maintained}} their good place from qualifying; Ralf Schumacher had the fastest time, 1:42.621. Montoya finished with the second fastest time. Coulthard was third quickest, and Michael Schumacher completed the top four, one-tenth of a second behind Ralf Schumacher. Alonso spun at the Sudkurve corner and skated across the <b>gravel</b> <b>trap</b> towards the tyre barriers.|$|E
5|$|As dusk {{began to}} fall on the drying track, the No. 8 Peugeot {{suffered}} from rear wheel hub failures which required two lengthy visits to the garage. This allowed the No. 1 Audi to take over second place. Jacques Villeneuve's No. 7 Peugeot also lost time, which dropped it to two laps behind the No. 2 Audi. The No. 1 Audi had its own brief moment when the No. 63 Corvette clipped the Audi's rear end. The Corvette was forced to take evasive action through the Dunlop Chicane's <b>gravel</b> <b>trap,</b> and the Audi required replacement rear bodywork on its next pit stop.|$|E

50|$|Thompson led the warm-up {{session on}} Sunday morning. Ng ended his session stuck {{in one of}} the <b>gravel</b> <b>traps</b> while Tarquini had a minor {{collision}} with a tyre wall which ended his running.|$|R
50|$|Because run-off {{areas and}} their {{associated}} safety devices (i.e. <b>gravel</b> <b>traps,</b> air fences, tire walls, etc.) are a primary safety feature of tracks, they hold enormous economic sway over the track, a consideration {{that is not}} lost on designers of new tracks and existing tracks' renovation projects.|$|R
5|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, {{which took place}} in dry weather conditions for most of the 90-minute period and became wet when rain fell in the closing stages which prevented any drivers from improving on their fastest times, Brendon Hartley in Porsche's No. 1 car set an early lap time of one minute and 39.655 seconds which remained the fastest time {{for the remainder of the}} session. He was 1.6 seconds quicker than Romain Dumas in the team's No. 2 entry, who in turn, was two-tenths of a second faster than Loïc Duval in the No. 8 Audi. A LMGTE car impacted Dumas, causing him to spin into the turn seven <b>gravel</b> <b>trap,</b> and sustained damage to his car's right-rear tyre, causing the deployment of a full course yellow flag. He was extracted from the <b>gravel</b> <b>trap</b> and drove back to the pit lane for car repairs. Jonny Kane in the No. 36 Signatech Alpine was the fastest driver in LMP2 with a time of one minute and 49.632 seconds set in the session's closing minutes, nearly one-tenth of a second in front of Jakes. LMGTE Pro was led by James Calado in the No. 51 AF Corse Ferrari 488 GTE, while Carroll's Gulf Racing car was fastest in LMGTE Am, despite driving off the track in the session's closing minutes.|$|E
5|$|Rosberg {{was again}} fastest {{in the second}} session on Friday afternoon, setting his fastest time of 1:07.967 in the early minutes. This {{benchmark}} would stand {{for the rest of}} the session as heavy rain arrived at the circuit eight minutes in. Several drivers slid off the track as they tried to return to the pitlane, where they would remain for half an hour until the rain eased off. Ricciardo was the first to head out again on the intermediate tyres, slowly followed by the rest of the field. With under twenty minutes remaining, the track had dried out enough to use slick tyres. Behind Rosberg and Hamilton, Nico Hülkenberg set the third-fastest time, ahead of Vettel, who spun out into the <b>gravel</b> <b>trap</b> in turn 2 late in the session.|$|E
5|$|Vettel {{continued}} {{to open his}} lead on Kovalainen; by lapeight it stood at 6.3seconds. Both Räikkönen and Hamilton passed Fisichella in separate manoeuvres over the next twolaps. Hamilton took 11thposition from Räikkönen on lap11, outbraking the Ferrari at turnfour. Fisichella collided with Coulthard twolaps later. As {{a result of the}} contact, the Force India's front wing broke loose and lodged under the car. Consequently, Fisichella lost control at turnnine, spinning into the <b>gravel</b> <b>trap</b> and retiring. Massa overtook Rosberg for fourth on the same lap, beginning a close fight where both drivers repeatedly exchanged positions over the next threelaps. Massa eventually consolidated fourth position on lap15. Hamilton passed Heidfeld, Glock, Kubica and Alonso in separate manoeuvres, to sit in seventh by lap19.|$|E
50|$|The Dunlop chicane was {{modified}} slightly {{in order to}} slow speeds again but also accommodate larger <b>gravel</b> <b>traps</b> as runoff area {{for the protection of}} motorcycle riders using the Bugatti Circuit. Frenchman Sébastien Enjolras lost his life in a pre-qualifying accident in his Welter Racing WR LM97-Peugeot.|$|R
50|$|The circuit {{is still}} {{considered}} as a low category venue, with many corners being unsafe {{due to the lack}} of <b>gravel</b> <b>traps,</b> armco and poor surface. The frequent accidents of cars and especially motorbikes that led to serious injuries further hurt the reputation of the Lithuanian race track.|$|R
50|$|It was a Chevrolet 1-2-3-4 in free {{practice}} {{two with}} defending champion Yvan Muller leading Huff, Bueno and Menu. Oriola had a near-miss when his SUNRED car went {{through one of}} the <b>gravel</b> <b>traps,</b> while technical problems stopped Marchy Lee at the pit exit in his DeTeam KK Motorsport BMW 320 TC.|$|R
5|$|Continuing with Jaguar in 2004, Webber {{qualified}} sixth for {{the first}} race of the season, the , but faced his second consecutive retirement from his home race, this time {{as a result of}} a gearbox failure. At the following race, the , Webber produced the best qualifying performance of his career up to that point by splitting the dominant Ferraris to line up second on the grid. The race was less rewarding with a near-stall at the start meaning he was well outside the top 10 by the time the cars reached turn 1. An aggressive lap saw him move up to ninth place but during an exciting battle with Ralf Schumacher, they collided, forcing Webber to pit with damage to his front wing and tyre. In his desperation to make up for the lost time, Webber exceeded the pitlane speed limit and was handed a drive-through penalty which left him even further behind. More frustration eventually led to the end of his race as he spun into the <b>gravel</b> <b>trap</b> on the outside of the final corner on lap 23.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, Button set the quickest lap of the day, a 1:28.280, which was nearly one {{tenth of a}} second quicker than Webber. Vettel was third fastest followed by Hamilton in fourth. Alonso was fifth. Both Mercedes cars were slower in the session with Rosberg sixth and Schumacher seventh. Kubica, Petrov and Massa followed in the top ten. Webber stopped outside the exit of turn two with an engine failure and engaged in an argument with marshals on preventing the car from moving backwards. In the final practice session, Vettel was fastest {{with a time of}} 1:27.086. This made him three tenths of a second faster than Rosberg in second place. Hamilton set the third quickest lap despite spinning sideways into the turn eight <b>gravel</b> <b>trap.</b> He was ahead of Webber who was afflicted with a throttle problem, Kubica and Alonso. Schumacher, Button, Massa and Petrov completed the top ten ahead of qualifying.|$|E
5|$|The final {{practice}} {{was held on}} a dry race track which allowed for faster lap times. Lotterer set the quickest time of the weekend so far at 1:57.368 recorded in the session's final minute, and was 0.011 seconds faster than the second-fastest car of Hülkenberg. Jani was a further five-tenths of a second behind in third place, and was narrowly faster than teammate Hartley in fourth. Sam Bird was the fastest LMP2 driver in the No. 26 G-Drive Racing car {{with a time of}} 2:08.415, four-tenths ahead of Matthew Howson's KCMG Oreca. Toni Vilander recorded the quickest LMGTE Pro time ahead of Fernando Rees in the No. 97 Aston Martin, while Pedro Lamy, driving the British marque's No. 98 car, was the fastest driver in LMGTE Am. A brief full course yellow flag was displayed when Bachler's back-end collided with the Pouhon corner tyre barrier, while Turner avoided going into the Les Combes wall and was temporarily beached in the turn's <b>gravel</b> <b>trap.</b> Both drivers returned to the track and continued.|$|E
50|$|The half-mile oval {{is unique}} in that instead of a {{traditional}} guardrail around {{the outside of the}} track, it uses <b>gravel</b> <b>traps</b> similar to road courses. Hillenburg said this is for economical reasons, as a car sliding into a sand trap will not damage a car as much as hitting a wall.|$|R
50|$|Run-off {{areas are}} an {{important}} safety feature of modern motorsports parks and road courses. In fact, they are arguably {{the most important factor}} since they are the basis for several other safety features, such as <b>gravel</b> <b>traps</b> and air fences, which could not be placed anywhere or would be ineffective without a proper run-off area.|$|R
50|$|Muller led Pepe Oriola {{at the end}} of {{the first}} test session on Friday which saw a number of red flags. Souza spun his China Dragon Racing Chevrolet at turn eight, Mikhail Kozlovskiy was the next to get stuck in the gravel while Norbert Michelisz put his Zengő Motorsport Honda also ended his session in the <b>gravel</b> <b>traps.</b>|$|R
5|$|The weather {{remained}} hot and dry for the Saturday practice sessions. Michael Schumacher was {{the quickest}} {{driver in the}} third practice session, {{with a time of}} 1:39.937. Barrichello was second quickest, almost half a second slower than Michael Schumacher. The two Williams drivers were third and fourth; Ralf Schumacher ahead of Montoya. Coulthard secured the fifth fastest time, two-tenths of a second faster than teammate Häkkinen in sixth. Heidfeld, Villeneuve, Irvine and Kimi Räikkönen rounded out the top ten. Benetton driver Jenson Button did not set a time. In the final practice session, Ralf Schumacher was the quickest driver with a lap of 1:39.188, almost three-tenths of a second ahead of Montoya. Michael Schumacher was unable to improve his time from the previous session and was third fastest. He was ahead of Häkkinen in fourth, Heidfeld was fifth and Barrichello sixth. Irvine was seventh and Panis eighth. Coulthard, who beached his McLaren in the Agip corner <b>gravel</b> <b>trap,</b> took ninth and Trulli completed the top ten ahead of qualifying.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton began lapping fastest, {{recording}} a 1:32.869 on lap38, {{more than a}} second faster than first-placed Vettel. Lap45 saw three drivers set consecutive new fastest laps; Kubica's 1:32.366 was beaten by Webber with a 1:32.014s. They were then superseded by Räikkönen, who set a 1:31.691. On lap49 Webber attempted to pass Hamilton at the first chicane, but the two cars touched wheels. Webber was forced down the escape road, and when he emerged in front of Hamilton, he returned the position. Räikkönen continued {{to move through the}} field; he passed Coulthard and Piquet in separate manoeuvres to take ninthposition. Nakajima attempted to pass Coulthard into turnnine, but succeeded only in turning into the Red Bull RB4, sending it into the <b>gravel</b> <b>trap.</b> Coulthard pitted for a new front wing, which dropped him to 17th. Vettel crossed the finish line on lap53 by 12.5seconds over Kovalainen, becoming the youngest driver in Formula One history to win a Grand Prix. The one-stop strategies used by Kubica and Alonso paid off as they finished in third and fourth, respectively. Heidfeld, Massa, Hamilton and Webber rounded out the top eight. Räikkönen finished in ninthposition, setting the fastest laptime of 1:28.047 on the final lap.|$|E
5|$|Ralf Schumacher {{opened a}} gap of 6.1 seconds over Barrichello by his {{one and only}} pit stop on lap 35 and rejoined in fourth. de la Rosa was the last {{one-stop}} driver to pit on lap 36 from fifth, which he maintained upon rejoining the track. Michael Schumacher made his second pit stop on lap 40, and dropped behind Ralf Schumacher. Montoya moved back into the lead position when Barrichello made a pit stop on lap 41 and rejoined right behind Ralf Schumacher. At the completion of lap 42, with the scheduled pit stops completed, the order was Montoya, Ralf Schumacher, Barrichello, Michael Schumacher, de la Rosa, Villeneuve, Räikkönen, Alesi, Panis, Fisichella, Heidfeld, Bernoldi, Enge, Alonso and Yoong. Further down the field, Enge passed Bernoldi for twelfth on lap 43. Barrichello ran in the slipstream of Ralf Schumacher down the start/finish straight and Schumacher cut the Variante Goodyear chicane after attempting to defend his position, allowing Barrichello to take over second on lap 47. Yoong retired from the race on the same lap after he spun his car into a <b>gravel</b> <b>trap.</b> Bernoldi became the final retirement of the race when his car developed a crankshaft sensor problem on the same lap.|$|E
50|$|The circuit {{has five}} {{grandstand}} areas (Main Grandstand, West Grandstand, North Grandstand, South Grandstand and Marina Grandstand (aka Support)) {{and part of}} its pit lane exit runs underneath the track. It also houses a team building behind the pit building, Media Center, Dragster Track, VIP Tower and Ferrari World Theme Park. Additionally, one of the <b>gravel</b> <b>traps</b> runs underneath the West grandstand.|$|R
2500|$|Over {{the winter}} of 2002/03, the Dingle Dell chicane was reprofiled and removed. The {{motorcycle}} racing governing body (FIM) requested the change ahead of the World Superbike Championship visit in August, but it also allowed the installation of extra <b>gravel</b> <b>traps</b> should the CART [...] be switched from the Indy Circuit to the Grand Prix configuration. Shortly after completion, Barry Sheene died, so the new complex was renamed the Sheene Curve.|$|R
5000|$|The barrier {{received}} its first road course usage when Watkins Glen International adopted the SAFER barrier for key {{sections of the}} circuit, most notably in the bus stop chicane and Turn 11 for 2010. International road and street track adoption for the SAFER barrier has progressed gradually. Typically they are installed on high speed cornering sections, where space for runoff areas or <b>gravel</b> <b>traps</b> is limited and side impacts are of concern. Notable uses include: ...|$|R
5|$|Wurz locked his brakes {{going into}} turn 15, {{causing him to}} beach his car in the <b>gravel</b> <b>trap</b> and retired on lap 36. Button became the first driver to pit twice on lap 39. Coulthard {{replicated}} his manoeuvre into turn five on Michael Schumacher on lap 40, with the later pushed {{to the side of}} the track by Coulthard who took the lead. Michael Schumacher's right front wheel made slight contact with Coulthard's left front tyre in the process. Michael Schumacher then immediately withstood Häkkinen's attempts to overtake him. Frentzen and de la Rosa became the next two drivers to make pit stops on the same lap. Michael Schumacher and Häkkinen made pit stops for the second time on lap 43 and both emerged in third and fourth respectively. Barrichello's pit stop on the 44th lap saw him drop to fifth after his team had issues with fitting his right front tyre. Coulthard and Ralf Schumacher made pit stops over the next two laps. At the completition of lap 48, with the frontrunners completing their pit stops, the order was Coulthard, Michael Schumacher, Häkkinen, Barrichello, Villeneuve, Trulli, Ralf Schumacher, Frentzen, Button, Fisichella, Salo, Diniz, Heidfeld, Irvine, Alesi and Gené.|$|E
5|$|Fernando Alonso's luck finally ran out in Japan; {{having spent}} most of the season {{profiting}} from poor results from his rivals when he needed them the most, Alonso was the victim of a dramatic first corner clash, spinning out when he made contact with Kimi Räikkönen and paving the way for his championship rivals to make considerable inroads into his twenty-nine-point championship lead. Mark Webber was also caught up in the opening lap melee when he was hit by Romain Grosjean; Webber was forced to pit straight away, while Grosjean was given a ten-second stop-go penalty for causing yet another first lap incident. Bruno Senna also ran afoul of the stewards, hitting Nico Rosberg whilst trying to avoid Grosjean and Webber and earning a drive-through penalty for his troubles while Rosberg retired on the spot. Sergio Pérez added his name to the growing list of early retirements when he slid off at the hairpin under brakes and into the <b>gravel</b> <b>trap</b> whilst trying to force his way past a struggling Lewis Hamilton. Sebastian Vettel won the race from pole position, having led every lap of the race and setting the fastest lap time in the process to complete his second Grand Chelem. Felipe Massa finished second, his first podium result since the 2010 Korean Grand Prix, whilst Kamui Kobayashi claimed the first podium of his career – and the first podium for a Japanese driver at the Suzuka Circuit since Aguri Suzuki finished third in 1990 – after withstanding late pressure from Jenson Button.|$|E
5|$|Graves, {{who fell}} to second in class, went into Rivage's <b>gravel</b> <b>trap</b> with a left-front brake failure, {{causing him to}} retire. Toyota retired their No. 6 entry from the race because of an engine failure caused by an {{electrical}} fault. Smoke bellowed from the rear-end of Nakajima's Toyota upon leaving La Source and he {{went back into the}} pit lane where his mechanics worked on rectifying the problem allowing Oliver Jarvis in the No. 8 Audi to inherit the lead. Webber drove straight at the Bus Stop chicane, spun, and drove into the pit lane. Stefan Mücke, who was affected by turbocharger issues, lost control of the No. 66 Ford after one of his rear tyres was punctured, and narrowly avoided going airborne. The vehicle made heavy contact with the left-hand side barriers at Raidillon, heavily damaging the front-end and removing both of its doors, as well as littering debris onto the circuit. His car stopped in the centre of the track, causing the No. 2 Porsche to swerve to avoid hitting the vehicle, and the safety car was deployed to allow marshals to repair the heavily damaged tyre barrier. Drivers were instructed to steer onto the right-hand side of the track at Eau Rouge because the stranded car blocked the turn. Mücke was transported to the track's medical centre and later taken to the local hospital for a precautionary check-up because of bruising.|$|E
50|$|Safety {{has also}} been a point of {{difference}} between the two. While a road course usually has abundant run-off areas, <b>gravel</b> <b>traps,</b> and tire barriers, oval tracks usually have a concrete retaining wall separating the track from the fans. Innovations have been made to change this, however. The SAFER barrier was created to provide a less dangerous alternative to a traditional concrete wall. The barrier can be retrofitted onto an existing wall or may take the place of a concrete wall completely.|$|R
50|$|The {{track is}} known for its {{distinctive}} black and blue runoff areas known as the Blue Zone. The runoff surface consists of a mixture of asphalt and tungsten, used instead of <b>gravel</b> <b>traps,</b> as common at other circuits. A second, deeper run-off area is the Red Zone, with a more abrasive surface designed to maximize tyre grip and hence minimize braking distance, although at the cost of extreme tyre wear. The final safeguard consists of Tecpro barriers, a modern improvement on tyre barriers.|$|R
5000|$|Throughout {{the decades}} of {{organized}} professional automobile racing, track owners and sanctioning bodies were constantly developing and attempting to utilize various devices to protect drivers and spectators {{in the event of}} a crash. Tire barriers, water and sand barrels, Styrofoam blocks, <b>gravel</b> <b>traps,</b> guardrails, earth embankments, and other various low-cost devices were implemented, with a varying level of success and usefulness. In most cases, the devices were practical for road and street courses, but impractical, or particularly inappropriate for oval tracks.|$|R
5|$|In LMP2, Rast used {{intermediate}} tyres {{before making}} a pit stop for full wet tyres and recorded a lap time of two minutes and 7.374 seconds which gave him and co-driver Roman Rusinov a pole-setting two-lap average time of two minutes and 8.479 seconds. The two drivers were 1.1 seconds faster than the second-place class qualifier, the No. 31 Extreme Speed Motorsports Ligier JS P2 of Pipo Derani and Chris Cumming. Derani set the category's fastest individual lap which was 0.059 second's faster than Rast. The No. 43 RGR Sport team qualified in third with both SMP Racing cars rounding out the top five LMP2 qualifiers. Sam Bird and Davide Rigon, competing in the No. 71 AF Corse Ferrari, were the fastest LMGTE Pro drivers with a two-lap average time of two minutes and 12.440 seconds. They qualified 1.3 seconds in front of Richard Lietz and Michael Christensen in Dempsey-Proton Racing's No. 77 Porsche. Mücke and Pla in Ford Chip Ganassi Racing's No. 66 car took third despite Pla going into the Stowe corner <b>gravel</b> <b>trap</b> late in the session. Their sister No. 67 GT and the KCMG Porsche rounded out the top five class qualifiers. Calado recorded a time of two minutes and 11.589 seconds, and, after Bruni got into the car, {{he was unable to}} record a lap time and returned to a pit lane with an engine bay technical issue and started {{from the back of the}} overall field. Bachler and Khaled Al Qubaisi took the pole position in LMGTE Am, their first in the series, 2.297 seconds ahead of the second-place qualifier, KCMG's No. 78 car. Paolo Ruberti in Larbre Competition's No. 50 Chevrolet Corvette C7.R held the class pole position in the early part of the session but the team fell to third following the handover to co-driver Yutaka Yamagishi.|$|E
5|$|Initial weather {{forecasts}} predicted rain for the Thursday qualifying sessions, but {{it failed}} to materialise. The teams had two full sessions of clear but hot and humid conditions. Nick Tandy's Porsche led the session with a three minutes and 18.862 seconds lap, but remained in third position on the provisional grid. Audi No. 7 {{was the only other}} car to put in an improved lap time amongst the top ten cars. TDS Racing was the fastest LMP2 car in the session with a three minutes and 40.441 seconds yet still over two seconds behind the pole time of KCMG. The LMGTE categories also remained much the same, as Aston Martin still occupied the top four qualifying positions. Twice the session was stopped for heavy accidents, first for the No. 55 AF Corse Ferrari of Duncan Cameron who became stuck in a <b>gravel</b> <b>trap</b> for about fifteen minutes. The second stoppage occurred when Jan Magnussen suffered a mechanical failure in his No. 63 Chevrolet Corvette C7.R and hit the barriers twice in the Porsche Curves. Repairs to the barriers forced the cancellation of the remainder of the session, although half an hour was added to the final qualifying session. Magnussen was transported to the track's medical centre for a check-up and later released by the race organiser's medical staff. The Corvette was unable to be repaired and the team was forced to withdraw from the race because they did not bring a spare chassis to Le Mans.|$|E
5|$|Montoya {{made his}} pit stop on lap 22. However, his pit stop proved problematic: the signal lights at his pit box stopped working, causing the Williams refuller {{to switch to}} the fuel rig for Ralf Schumacher and Montoya {{remained}} stationary for 20 seconds longer than usual. Montoya was also fuelled for longer than his team planned. Ralf Schumacher thus inherited the lead with Michael Schumacher behind him and Montoya re-emerged in fourth place. One lap later, Michael Schumacher took his pit stop and he {{came out with a}} fuel pressure problem which meant he pulled {{to the side of the}} main straight and retired. Burti spun off and beached his car in the <b>gravel</b> <b>trap</b> at Nordkurve on the same lap. Ralf Schumacher made his pit stop on lap 24 and rejoined with a 10-second advantage. Villeneuve, Button and Alonso all followed Ralf Schumacher into the pit lane on the same lap. Alonso encountered a problem when leaving his pit box: the Minardi refuelling valve had a problem, and his car's afterburner remained on, though the flames extinguished themselves when Alonso accelerated out of the pit lane. Montoya pulled over to the side of the track on lap 25, with smoke billowing from his engine, and retired. Fisichella made a pit stop from fourth on lap 26 and re-emerged in fifth behind Villeneuve. Marques retired from the race with a gearbox problem on the same lap. Coulthard made a pit stop on lap 27 and immediately became the race's next retirement when he acclerated away from his pit box with a blown engine. The resulting event meant he pulled to the side of the circuit. Panis made his pit stop on lap 31 and came out behind Button and Alesi. Barrichello became the final driver to make a scheduled pit stop on the 32nd lap.|$|E
50|$|The circuit {{is located}} two hours drive from Sydney and about one hour from Canberra, and is {{positioned}} on Braidwood Road, 10 km south of Goulburn on 130 acre of cleared land. There are no trees or natural obstacles near the track. Safety is paramount and ripple strips, tyre walls and <b>gravel</b> <b>traps</b> have been positioned {{so as to}} make Wakefield a very safe circuit on which to run any type of racecar, production car or motorcycle. The track was resurfaced by its new owners, Winton Motor Raceway, in late 2007.|$|R
50|$|The {{event was}} the first to feature the revised SuperSprint race format, which was {{introduced}} for the 2016 season. A single 120 km race was held on Saturday, with drivers required to make a pit stop to change tyres. The 120 km race replaces the pair of 60 km races which had been held on the Saturday of SuperSprint events in 2015. It was also the first event held at the circuit following upgrades which had taken place across December 2015 and January 2016, which included the installation of new concrete barriers {{on the inside of the}} circuit and the reconditioning of the <b>gravel</b> <b>traps.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In {{the safety}} {{conscious}} {{years following the}} death of Ayrton Senna in 1994 (albeit at a different track), the three main long curves were [...] "squeezed" [...] in order to install larger <b>gravel</b> <b>traps,</b> shortening the lap to 5.770 km. [...] In 1997 the stands were reworked to expand capacity to 51,000. In 2000, the chicane on the main straight was altered, changing from a double left-right chicane to a single right-left chicane in an attempt to reduce the frequent accidents at the starts due to the conformation of the braking area, although it is still deemed unsafe in terms of motorcycle racing. The second chicane was also re-profiled. In the Formula 1 Grand Prix of the same year, the first to use these new chicanes, a fire marshal, Paolo Gislimberti, was killed by flying debris after a big pileup at the second chicane.|$|R
