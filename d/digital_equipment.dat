5|$|In 1980, {{an expert}} system called XCON was {{completed}} at CMU for the <b>Digital</b> <b>Equipment</b> Corporation. It {{was an enormous}} success: it was saving the company 40 million dollars annually by 1986. Corporations around the world began to develop and deploy expert systems and by 1985 they were spending over a billion dollars on AI, most of it to in-house AI departments. An industry grew up to support them, including hardware companies like Symbolics and Lisp Machines and software companies such as IntelliCorp and Aion.|$|E

5|$|A major {{planning}} {{issue was}} {{the need for a}} minicomputer at the station. NDRE argued that it was fully capable of delivering such a system, but NTNF instead wanted to minimize risk by buying the PDP-8 from <b>Digital</b> <b>Equipment</b> Corporation in the United States. However, NDRE was awarded the contract, in part because of NTNF's obligation to support Norwegian technology and in part because NDRE agreed to purchase a suitable foreign computer if they could not successfully manufacture one themselves. A new minicomputer, SAM-2, was built at NDRE and completed in April 1967. It was the first computer built in Europe and among the first three in the world which used integrated circuits. SAM-2 was so successful that the developers established Norsk Data to commercialize the technology.|$|E
5|$|That July, the RTC {{took out}} a $385,000 {{mortgage}} on the Theatre from two banks, the Rondout Savings Bank and the Ulster Savings Bank. After being run by the Cacchios for 61years, the RTC assumed ownership of the Theatre on August19, 2010. Announcing its intent to show {{the same kind of}} movies that the Theatre screened during the Cacchio's tenure, the group also agreed to continue exhibiting live acts, continue participating in the Woodstock Film Festival, renovate the building, and add <b>digital</b> <b>equipment.</b> The second and third floors may be renovated and used for offices, and as space for rehearsals and performances.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Lunar Lander {{game was}} a 1969 text-based game called Lunar, or alternately the Lunar Landing Game. It was originally {{written in the}} FOCAL programming language for the <b>Digital</b> <b>Equipment</b> Corporation (DEC) PDP-8 minicomputer by Jim Storer while a student at Lexington High School {{in the fall of}} 1969. Storer submitted the game to the DEC users' newsletter, which distributed the source code to readers. Other versions of the concept were written soon after: a version called Rocket was written in BASIC by Eric Peters at DEC, and a third version, LEM, was written by William Labaree II in BASIC, among others.|$|E

5|$|For NTNF, the {{establishment}} brought by an organizational change. While it had previously also conducted space research, {{the operations of}} installations had been placed with FFI. As FFI was {{a branch of the}} military, this structure could not be used in Svalbard. Thus NTNF had to organize an operative branch for the ground station. The responsibility for operating the telecommunications facilities was awarded to the Norwegian Telecommunications Administration. The ground station needed a computer. FFI offered to deliver a Simulation for Automatic Machinery, while the alternative was to purchase a PDP-8 computer from <b>Digital</b> <b>Equipment</b> Corporation. As NTNF was responsible for the country's technological development, they chose to award the contract to FFI on the condition that they pay for a PDP-8 if they were not able to deliver a computer themselves.|$|E
5|$|Hamurabi is a text-based {{strategy}} {{video game}} {{of land and}} resource management first developed by Doug Dyment in 1968. It was developed by Dyment at <b>Digital</b> <b>Equipment</b> Corporation as The Sumer Game before {{the rise of the}} commercial video game industry in the early history of video games as a computer game for fellow employee Richard Merrill's newly invented FOCAL programming language. The game consists of ten rounds wherein the player, as the ancient Babylonian king Hammurabi, manages how much of their grain to spend on crops for the next round, feeding their people, and purchasing additional land, while dealing with random variations in crop yields and plagues. The Sumer Game was possibly inspired by the 1966 The Sumerian Game, a much more in-depth text-based economic simulation intended for children.|$|E
5|$|By the 1960s, {{improvements}} in computing {{technology and the}} early development of relatively cheaper mainframe computers, which would later be termed minicomputers, led to the loosening of restrictions regarding programming access to the computers. At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), access to the TX-0 experimental computer was opened to students and employees of the university. This in turn {{led to the development}} of programs that in addition to highlighting the power of the computer also contained an entertainment aspect. The games created for the TX-0 by the small programming community at MIT included Tic-Tac-Toe, which used a light pen to play a simple game of noughts and crosses against the computer, and Mouse in the Maze, which let players set up a maze for a mouse to run through. When the <b>Digital</b> <b>Equipment</b> Corporation (DEC) PDP-1 computer was installed at MIT in 1961, the community built a video game to showcase its abilities, Spacewar, which then became the first known video game to spread beyond a single computer installation as it was copied and recreated on other PDP-1 systems and later on other mainframe computers.|$|E
