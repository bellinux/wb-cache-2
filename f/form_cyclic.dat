25|$|Si–C {{bonds are}} {{commonly}} formed in three ways. In the laboratory, preparation is often {{carried out in}} small quantities by reacting tetrachlorosilane with organolithium, Grignard, or organoaluminium reagents, or by catalytic addition of Si–H across C=C double bonds. The second route has the drawback of not being applicable to the most important silanes, the methyl and phenyl silanes. Organosilanes are made industrially by directly reacting alkyl or aryl halides with silicon with 10% by weight metallic copper as a catalyst. Standard organic reactions suffice to produce many derivatives; the resulting organosilanes are often significantly more reactive than their carbon congeners, readily undergoing hydrolysis, ammonolysis, alcoholysis, and condensation to <b>form</b> <b>cyclic</b> oligomers or linear polymers.|$|E
25|$|The nodes of {{this network}} can {{represent}} genes, proteins, mRNAs, protein/protein complexes or cellular processes. Nodes that are depicted as lying along vertical lines {{are associated with}} the cell/environment interfaces, while the others are free-floating and can diffuse. Edges between nodes represent interactions between the nodes, that can correspond to individual molecular reactions between DNA, mRNA, miRNA, proteins or molecular processes through which the products of one gene affect those of another, though the lack of experimentally obtained information often implies that some reactions are not modeled at such a fine level of detail. These interactions can be inductive (usually represented by arrowheads or the + sign), with an increase in the concentration of one leading to an increase in the other, inhibitory (represented with filled circles, blunt arrows or the minus sign), with an increase in one leading to a decrease in the other, or dual, when depending of the circumstances the regulator can activate or inhibit the target node. The nodes can regulate themselves directly or indirectly, creating feedback loops, which <b>form</b> <b>cyclic</b> chains of dependencies in the topological network. The network structure is an abstraction of the system's molecular or chemical dynamics, describing the manifold ways in which one substance affects all the others to which it is connected. In practice, such GRNs are inferred from the biological literature on a given system and represent a distillation of the collective knowledge about a set of related biochemical reactions. To speed up the manual curation of GRNs, some recent efforts try to use text mining, curated databases, network inference from massive data, model checking and other information extraction technologies for this purpose.|$|E

40|$|A simple three step {{synthesis}} {{was developed}} to provide six novel modular sensors, consisting of three para sensors, and three meta sensors with naphthalene, anthracene and pyrene fluorophores.
