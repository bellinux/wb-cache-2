40|$|Pancreatic A {{cells of}} several {{vertebrate}} species (rat, mouse, pig, hamster, rabbit, dog, guinea pig, <b>hen,</b> <b>pigeon,</b> newt and crucian carp) selectively fluoresced after staining the fresh frozen cryostat {{sections of the}} pancreas with 1 % o-phthalaldehyde (Carbiochem) in physiologic saline (dissolved at 58 #{ 176 }C). The pertinent cells could be identified as A cells in the same sections observed under dark field illumination or phosphotungstic acid-hema-toxylin staining. The histamine assay and some experiments using reserpine, compound 48 / 80 and cobaltous chloride indicated that the fluorogenic material is neither histamine, catecholamine nor tryptamine. This o-phthalaldehyde stain is a simple, rapid and specific method to disclose A cells of the pancreatic islet, although the nature of responsible sub-stance is yet unknown. o-Phthalaldehyde (OPT) has been extensively em) loyed for the histochemical detection of histamine in fresh tissues, fresh frozen cryostat, frozen-dried paraffin and cold ethanol-fixed l) ar-affin sections.

Six different exteroceptive stimuli were successively correlated, within a single session, with blocks of 10 reinforcement presentations. Following this training, a non-contingent reinforcement procedure was instated with inter-reinforcement intervals of 5, 15, 30, 60, 120, and 240 sec.

50|$|Much {{was done}} in getting the French {{settlers}} established. Allotments were laid out for them {{to the west of}} the stream where they had landed, in what is now known as the French town. As enough open land on the foreshore could not be found at all, the six Germans were allotted sections on the next bay to the west, now known as Takamatua, but until 1915 was called German Bay. The total area of the land taken up under the Nanto-Bordelaise Company at this time was 107 acre. Although they had no animals, the colonists were able to plant and prepare their gardens. In the following year de Belligny obtained four working bullocks from Sydney. Vegetable seeds and a number of young fruit trees — apples, pears, mulberry and nuts — as well as grape vines, had survived the voyage from France. Although Lavaud mentions that the ‘menagerie’ placed on board the Aube at Brest included not only the cattle, but geese, turkey cocks and <b>hens,</b> <b>pigeons</b> and even rabbits, it is not clear whether any of these survived.|$|R

50|$|Beritashvili’s work in {{the last}} decade of his life was devoted to memory research. Using {{multiple}} variations of this investigation, Beritashvili studied the mnemonic capabilities of various vertebrates from fish to microcephalic and normal children, the effect of restricted sensory input, and the removal of various portions of the CNS in animals. He distinguished three types of vertebrate memory: image-driven memory, emotional memory, and conditioned-reflex memory. In his experiments, image-driven memory was investigated by the method of delayed responses during free movement. Together with his collaborators, Beritashvili carried out fundamental research on the phylogeny of the image-driven memory and found that particularly in fish, amphibians and reptiles, only short-term memory images are formed, but in birds (<b>hens,</b> <b>pigeons)</b> long-term memory images also exist. In the phylogenetic development from fish to monkey, short-term memory extends from several seconds in fish to some dozens of minutes in higher vertebrates. Long-term memory extends from several minutes in birds to several months in dogs and monkeys. According to Beritashvili, image-driven memory in all vertebrates is a result of forebrain activity; with the development of the cortex, image-driven memory becomes its most important function. For instance, the associative areas of the proreal fissure and temporal lobe {{play a key role in}} the retention of the images of recognized objects. Beritashvili considered the substrate of image-driven memory to be located in the neural circuits between the proreal fissure, the visual cortex, the inferior temporal cortex, and the hippocampus.|$|R

50|$|Many of the {{products}} here are from Europe, Asia {{and the rest of}} the Americas. Of particular note is the wide variety of meat products found. Fresh meat from many different animals, both from Mexico and abroad can be found. These meats include those from iguanas, skunks, deer, rabbit, suckling pigs, goat, wild boar and lowland paca. One very unusual specialty is lion meat, from animals raised for those purpose in Zumpango and sells for about 850 pesos per kilo. Fresh meats are from both Mexican and international sources, primarily Central America and the United States, with the most popular being rabbit, venison, wild boar and crocodile. Poultry includes Cornish <b>hens,</b> duck, <b>pigeon,</b> goose, turkey, doves as well as the eggs from various types of birds. The market also has some of the finest seafood selections in the city, both Mexican and imported, including caviar that sells for more than 6,000 pesos a kilo.|$|R
50|$|Not all Quimbanda {{practitioners}} use animal sacrifices, {{and their}} use is according {{to the level of}} the spirits. There is no animal sacrifice used for crowned Exus. In certain rituals with Kiumbas (aspiring to become Exus), devotees offer sacrificial <b>pigeons,</b> <b>hens,</b> roosters, goats, sheep, and bulls to help a spirit progress in power and capability. Other rituals use animal sacrifices to enlist the help of a spirit to carry out a deed. Adherents defend the practice because they believe that there is no worse animal sacrifice then in slaughterhouses, since those animals are believed to suffer more than at a proper Quimbanda ritual.|$|R

50|$|Kolathur is {{also known}} for the largest export of {{colorful}} tropical fish, aquarium fish feed, aquariums, glass and stone aquarium gravel. Pet animals other than fish are also available in Aquarium Street, They include Love Birds, Hamsters, <b>pigeons,</b> <b>hens</b> etc. Kolathur was once a hub for fish breeding too,now due to the high ground rates fish farms are converted into residential houses and flats and the farms and ponds are transferred to Gummudipondi.It was Mr. Ashok who was instrumental in breeding ornamental fishes, as he started imparting his knowledge to his friends who started fish breeding farms. Then a few enterprising people started breeding varieties of fishes in the 1980s in the sprawling backyards of their homes.The main reason was that the area was endowed with abundant fresh ground water sources {{and there was the}} perennial ‘Retteri' lake. Moreover, as ornamental fishes breed in different types of water and the water available at Kolathur has a balanced pH (Potential Hydrogen) value of 6 to 7.8, the business thrived.At present, there are around 80 shops dealing in ornamental fishes, aquariums and fish accessories spread out on School Road and Mada Streets in Kolathur.|$|R
