500|$|... "Greatest Hits" [...] {{marked the}} first {{appearance}} for married couple Rose and Bernard since the late second season and fans welcomed the recurring characters' return. [...] The writers cited the actors' other projects {{as a reason for}} their absence. [...] Additionally, it was feared that fans would complain if they appeared, when many actors with star billing had received limited screentime in the early third season. [...] The writers also commented that {{they do not want to}} have the couple on the show if they are <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> standing in the background; they want to have Rose and Bernard in the show with interesting storylines.|$|E

500|$|Speaking on his collaborations {{with the}} producers, Songz {{said that on}} Ready, [...] "we're {{breaking}} down every song, every hook, every chorus, every bridge, and we're making sure every song is the best song it could be. This album isn't <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a compilation of songs, but a classic body of work." [...] The album only contained three guest features with Drake, Gucci Mane and Soulja Boy Tell 'Em. Songz {{wanted to keep the}} amount of features very limited, and stated that [...] "anybody else I add {{is going to be very}} special". American rapper Fabolous was added as a guest feature on the track, titled [...] "Say Aah".|$|E
500|$|... "Empty Orchestra" [...] {{follows a}} {{relatively}} simple narrative of co-workers on a night out, telling several interweaved stories through body language, muffled conversations and relevant song lyrics. Phil Harrison, writing for The Guardian, characterised the episode as [...] "a study in communication breakdown; how people use booze, loud music and enforced jollity to fill the gaps between them". Possibilities for macabre developments are seeded in the early episode, but, contrary to viewer expectations, these possibilities are cut off; for example, Duane's [...] "pills" [...] are merely Tic Tacs, and Roger's list—as revealed in his [...] "David Brentish" [...] speech—has no sinister purpose. Viewer expectations (and possible criticisms) are anticipated by Pemberton's Roger saying [...] "it's not <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> one song after another, is it?" ...|$|E
500|$|Regarding the band's reunion, Lytle noted, [...] "The bargain I {{made myself}} {{regarding}} the 'brief reunion and couple of shows' situation was that I wasn't gonna {{talk too much}} about it. I was just gonna stew on it, and then do it. That's {{the good thing about}} festivals. No need for me to sell anything here. Get in, rock out, get paid, get out. There are <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a few shows. Festival-type thingies. Perhaps the odd 'warm up gig' in someone's hair salon or something. Money was a motivating factor (resurfacing my indoor tennis court, oil change for my 4×4 Ferrari) but the idea of playing and hanging out with each other is something all of the guys are pretty stoked about." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gerlach has {{strongly}} supported Schuylkill Valley commuter rail. At {{one point he}} said of the Bush administration's plan to cut federal money for construction costs from 80 percent to 50 percent: [...] "There's <b>just</b> not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> enough state and local funds to do the project.

He confirmed he would reprise his Broadway role as St. Jimmy. In November 2016, Armstrong stated that the film is [...] "going to be a lot different from the musical. It's kind of, more surreal but I think there’s going to be parts of it that might offend people – which is good. I think it's a good time to offend people. I think there's <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a lot of imagery that we couldn't pull off in the musical in the stage version. You know, I don’t want to give away too much, but it will be shocking in a way which makes you think." ...|$|E
500|$|Holloman {{made his}} major league debut on April 14 in a relief appearance. He made in three {{additional}} relief appearances afterward, allowing five runs in 5⅓ innings through his first four games. As a result, Holloman asked Marion for a start, claiming {{he was better}} in that role, {{and if he was}} <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used as a relief pitcher, he should be sold to another team. Marion gave in, and put him in for a home game on May 6 against the Philadelphia Athletics. On a rainy night before a crowd of 2,473 at Sportsman's Park, Holloman threw a no-hitter in his first major league start. He had two hits as a batter, and recorded three strikeouts en route to the 6–0 victory. [...] In his autobiography, Browns owner Bill Veeck called Holloman's no-hitter [...] "the quaintest no-hitter {{in the history of the}} game," [...] saying that his pitches were [...] "belted" [...] all night but he was saved by luck and outstanding defense.|$|E
500|$|However, Scott instead {{contacted}} Lindelof {{and asked}} him to review Spaihts's script. Within the hour, a messenger delivered the script to Lindelof and informed him that he would wait outside to return it as soon as Lindelof had finished reading it. Lindelof was unaware of what Scott and the producers liked about the existing script, and informed them that he found the general concept appealing, but that the story relied too heavily on elements of the Alien films, such as the Alien creatures' life-cycle. As a direct prequel to Alien, the story was shaped to lead into that film's story, and to recreate the familiar cues of that series, and Scott wanted to avoid repeating his previous accomplishments. Lindelof said, [...] "If the ending to [...] is <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the room that John Hurt walks into that's full of [...] eggs , there's nothing interesting in that, because we know where it's going to end. Good stories, you don't know where they're going to end." [...] "A true prequel should essentially precede the events of the original film, but be about something entirely different, feature different characters, have an entirely different theme, although it takes place in that same world." ...|$|E

500|$|Most of {{the lyrics}} on Experimental Jet Set deal with {{political}} and personal topics. Gordon explained that the song [...] "Bull in the Heather" [...] is about [...] "using passiveness {{as a form of}} rebellion—like, I'm not going to participate in your male-dominated culture, so I'm <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> passive." [...] Similarly, the song [...] "Androgynous Mind" [...] addresses traditional gender roles, while [...] "Self-Obsessed and Sexxee" [...] is an observation on an anonymous riot grrrl. Moore explained that the latter is not about Courtney Love of Hole or Kathleen Hanna of Bikini Kill; it is about [...] "being attracted to somebody who's obviously out of control with self-obsession in the high-profile alternative-rock world." [...] The track [...] "Quest for the Cup" [...] deals with a person who desires more than it is needed. The opening track, [...] "Winner's Blues", alludes to the pressure of fame and has been described as an acoustic and sad lullaby. The song was originally intended to be an outtake designated for the compilation DGC Rarities Vol. 1, but the band ultimately decided to include it in the album at the last minute during the mixing sessions. Another outtake, [...] "Compilation Blues", was instead included on the compilation.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{produced}} by Al Jean and Mike Reiss, who had served as showrunners of seasons three and four. They returned to the show to produce this and several other episodes while under contract with The Walt Disney Company. The episode was written by Reid Harrison and directed by Steven Dean Moore. It {{had one of the}} longest episode gaps between its conception to the time it was finished. The idea was first conceived at a story retreat. Jean found a copy of TV Guide while in the bathroom, with The X-Files on the cover. Feeling a crossover would be a good idea, he came back into the room, told Reiss his idea, and the pair pitched it. None of the other staff wanted to do it, so Reiss and Jean decided to do it themselves. Before the episode was produced, the script was sent to Chris Carter, the creator of The X-Files, who said that it was an [...] "honor" [...] to be satirized by The Simpsons. Jean was worried that the episode was not funny, as at the table reading {{there were only a few}} of the writers present and as such, the script got no laughs at all. It took a long time to come up with an ending, and an explanation for the alien. Originally, it was <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> left as a mystery. Mulder and Scully's office was designed to be exactly the same as the one used in The X-Files. After it had been finished, Fox sent the episode out for a critical review, which was [...] "really great". The scene with the [...] "Homer is a dope" [...] T-shirts originally had an extra line: [...] "I told you, we're sold out!", thus filling in the plot error in the actual episode in which Homer asks for some T-shirts, despite just being told that they were sold out. The scene after Homer's first encounter with the alien, in which he runs through a field writing [...] "Yahhh!" [...] in the grass, was written by David M. Stern, and added in after the original read through.|$|E

I rarely get to play [...] one-on-one ... But when I play him (on defense), it's <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> me down there.

5000|$|Steve Juon of RapReviews.com {{gave the}} album a 7.5 out of 10, saying, [...] "It's {{hard not to}} {{recommend}} Paranoid Castle to everybody reading except for one thing: it's <b>just</b> not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> boom bap enough for some or macho enough for others."

2500|$|Masters {{attempted}} to keep Nova Studios afloat by finally producing sound films. [...] Masters {{had refused to}} make films with synchronous sound until 1983—long after most other gay pornographic studios had not only begun using dialogue synched to the actor's lip movements but also had moved from film to video. Masters' friend, William Higgins, had been recording sound for his films (but not using it) since 1978, and Falcon Studios released their first sound film in 1979. [...] "I hated sound at this time. [...] Because of my experience with Greek Lightning, partially, and I said, 'What will sound do for these films except make them ludicrous?' Because {{the kind of people}} we use in these films can't talk, can't act, have no background—they can't do any of these things, and it's <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> absurd to make them say things when they aren't going to say them well." ...|$|E

Recording was completed to the satisfaction of both band and label in February 2010. The following month, it was confirmed that the band would be playing Open'er Festival in Poland as well as the Reading and Leeds Festivals in the UK. They headlined the BBC Radio 1/NME Stage.
