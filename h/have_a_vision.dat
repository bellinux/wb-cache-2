As she and Sonia watch from the rooftop that Ajay proposed to her on, they <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>vision</b> of the boys running in the fields, singing happily and victoriously throwing their shirts in the air, acting as if they are celebrating life itself, as if the ebb of their once-there vitality still reverberates in the places where they once used to go, and a wave of melancholy comes over the two surviving women.|$|E
5|$|Boone {{runs through}} the jungle, and locates Shannon tied to a tree. Boone frees her and they run away from the {{pursuing}} monster. The monster takes Shannon, and a distraught Boone later finds her mutilated body by a creek, watching her die. That night Boone returns to the camp and tries to kill Locke, screaming that he had killed his sister, but Locke reveals that Shannon is alive. The paste caused Boone to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>vision</b> that, according to Locke, is crucial to his experience on the island. Boone says seeing Shannon dead made him feel relieved. Locke says to come with him, and the two disappear into the jungle.|$|E

25|$|On 29 March 2016, the KES 56 billion (USD 560 Million) Greenfield Terminal Project was {{terminated}} by Kenya Airports Authority because the contractor failed to secure funds thus ending Kenya's dream {{of having the}} largest terminal in Africa. It however {{remains to be seen}} whether future administrations like the Grand Coalition Government of 2008-2013 will re-activate the project which is necessary for Nairobi and Kenya's future aviation needs in the 2020s, 2030's and beyond.

500|$|Ken Adam, an Academy Award-winning {{production}} designer, {{was hired}} to design the film. Adam did a number of concept renderings of various settings, including a geometric chamber where Spock would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>vision</b> of his own death, a giant crystalline [...] "space brain", various Enterprise interiors, including a hangar deck and an [...] "open" [...] saucer interior with tubes connecting various platforms–a design concept he later executed for the space station interior in the James Bond film Moonraker. He also sketched exterior configurations for the starship {{which was to be}} refitted after nearly being destroyed by a black hole in the opening scenes.|$|E
500|$|Éowyn {{was to have}} {{a greater}} role in {{defending}} the refugees in the Glittering Caves from Uruk-hai intruders, while in Osgiliath, Faramir was to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>vision</b> of Frodo becoming like Gollum, with Frodo and Sam having an extended fight sequence. Filmed for The Return of the King were two scenes present in the book; Sam using the Phial of Galadriel to pass the Watchers at Cirith Ungol, and further epilogue footage, with endings for Legolas and Gimli, Éowyn and Faramir's wedding and Aragorn's death and funeral. Sauron was to fight Aragorn at the Black Gate, but with Jackson deciding the scene was inappropriate, a computer-generated Troll was used instead. To give context for Wormtongue killing Saruman, and Legolas in turn killing Wormtongue, it was to be revealed Wormtongue poisoned Théodred. The final scene cut was Aragorn having his armour fitted for the Battle of the Black Gate by the trilogy's armourers, which was the final scene filmed during principal photography. Peter Jackson has stated {{that he would like to}} include some of these unused scenes in a future [...] "Ultimate Edition" [...] home video release, also including out-takes.|$|E
500|$|Dick's {{story was}} first optioned by {{producer}} and writer Gary Goldman in 1992. [...] He created the initial script {{for the film}} with Ron Shusett and Robert Goethals (uncredited). It {{was supposed to be}} a sequel to the 1990 Dick adaptation Total Recall, which starred Arnold Schwarzenegger. Novelist Jon Cohen was hired in 1997 to adapt the story for a potential film version that would have been directed by Dutch filmmaker Jan de Bont. Meanwhile, Cruise and Spielberg, who met and became friends on the set of Cruise's film Risky Business in 1983, had been looking to collaborate for ten years. Spielberg was set to direct Cruise in Rain Man, but left to make Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Cruise read Cohen's script, and passed it onto Spielberg, who felt it needed some work. Spielberg was not directly involved in the writing of the script; however, he was allowed to decide whether the picture's screenplay was ready to be filmed. When Cohen submitted an acceptable revision, he called Cruise and said, [...] "Yeah, I'll do this version of the script." [...] In that version, Witwer creates a false disk which shows Anderton killing him. When Anderton sees the clip, his belief in the infallibility of the precogs' visions convinces him it is true, therefore the precogs <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>vision</b> of him killing Witwer. At the end, Anderton shoots Witwer and one of the brother precogs finishes him off, because Witwer had slain his twin. Spielberg was attracted to the story because as both a mystery and a movie set 50 years in the future, it allowed him to do [...] "a blending of genres" [...] which intrigued him.|$|E

2500|$|Kerouac's early writing, {{particularly}} {{his first novel}} The Town and the City, was more conventional, and bore the strong influence of Thomas Wolfe. [...] The technique Kerouac developed that later made him famous was heavily influenced by Jazz, especially Bebop, and later, Buddhism, {{as well as the}} famous Joan Anderson letter written by Neal Cassady. The Diamond Sutra was the most important Buddhist text for Kerouac, and [...] "probably one of the three or four most influential things he ever read". In 1955, he began an intensive study of this sutra, in a repeating weekly cycle, devoting one day to each of the six Pāramitās, and the seventh to the concluding passage on [...] Samādhi. [...] This was his sole reading on Desolation Peak, and he hoped by this means to condition his mind to [...] emptiness, and possibly to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>vision.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Scottish {{government}} and pro-independence campaigners {{said that a}} democratic deficit existed in Scotland because the UK was a unitary state {{that did not have}} a codified constitution. The SNP also described the unelected House of Lords as an [...] "affront to democracy". The [...] "democratic deficit" [...] label has sometimes been used to refer to the period between the 1979 and 1997 UK general elections, during which the Labour Party held a majority of Scottish seats but the Conservative Party governed the whole of the UK. Alex Salmond said in September 2013 that instances such as this amounted to a lack of democracy, and that [...] "the people who live and work in Scotland are the people most likely to make the right choices for Scotland". In January 2012, Patrick Harvie said: [...] "Greens <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>vision</b> of a more radical democracy in Scotland, with far greater levels of discussion and decision making at community level." [...] The Scottish Government intended that an independent Scotland should have a written constitution which [...] "expresses our values, embeds the rights of our citizens and sets out clearly how our institutions of state interact with each other and serve the people".|$|E

2500|$|Amerie gained {{even more}} {{recognition}} from garnering her first acting {{role in the}} 2004 film First Daughter with Katie Holmes and directed by Forrest Whittaker. The film was not commercially appreciated, possibly due to its development being pushed back several years. Also, in 2004, Amerie began working on her sophomore album, Touch, in early 2004. As with All I Have, the album Executive Produced by Ameriie and Lenny Nicholson it was co-written and produced by friend Rich Harrison, who contributed seven (new) tracks to the record; additional productions came from Lil Jon, Bryce Wilson, Red Spyda, and Dre & Vidal. Unlike on her first album, Amerie co-wrote every track but one, [...] "Come with Me", which Harrison wrote. She also assumed more creative control over the visual imagery accompanying the album, such as videos and artwork"I feel like when you do a record, you <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>vision</b> in your mind {{and you want to}} carry it across—and it doesn't end with the studio", she has said. In January 2005, Amerie released the lead single, titled [...] "1 Thing". The dance-pop song, which sampled The Meters's 1970 funk recording [...] "Oh, Calcutta!", became Amerie's biggest hit to date. In the United States, it peaked at number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 and topped the Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs chart. The RIAA awarded a gold certification to its digital download in October 2005, and another gold certification to its ringtone release in June 2006. The song was a top five hit in the UK, where it became one of the year's best-selling singles, and attained top ten and top twenty positions across continental Europe.|$|E
