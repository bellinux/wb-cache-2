Instead, valid operations are equivalence, set membership, and other set-related operations.|$|R

Such an approach provides method universality and independence of assumptions about the nature of processes that take place in ITS and allows control loops to form control actions taking into account the dynamics of quality defining processes. ?????????? ?????? ????????? ?????????????? ??????????? ??????? ?????????? ?????????????-???????????????????? ????????

We also determined indices of relative importance, diversity of trophic spectra and feeding. Forty two dietary components from five taxa were apparent: fishes, crustaceans, mollusks, cnidarians and chaetognaths.
