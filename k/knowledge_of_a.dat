5|$|Brown is {{credited}} {{with a number of}} American football innovations. He was the first coach to use game film to scout opponents, hire a full-time staff of assistants, and test players on their <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> playbook. He invented the modern face mask, the taxi squad and the draw play. He also played a role in breaking professional football's color barrier, bringing some of the first African-Americans to play pro football in the modern era onto his teams. Despite these accomplishments, Brown was not universally liked. He was strict and controlling, which often brought him into conflict with players who wanted a greater say in play-calling. These disputes, combined with Brown's failure to consult Modell on major personnel decisions, led to his firing as the Browns' coach in 1963.|$|E
5|$|In 1902, Czech chemist Bohuslav Brauner {{found out}} that the {{differences}} in properties between neodymium and samarium were the largest between any two consecutive lanthanides in the sequence then known; as a conclusion, he suggested there was an element with intermediate properties between them. This prediction was supported in 1914 by Henry Moseley who, having discovered that atomic number was an experimentally measurable property of elements, found that a few atomic numbers had no known corresponding elements: the gaps were 43, 61, 72, 75, 85, and 87. With the <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gap in the periodic table several groups started to search for the predicted element among other rare earths in the natural environment.|$|E
5|$|In a 1904 {{novel by}} Charles Whistler {{entitled}} A Prince of Cornwall Glastonbury {{in the days}} of Ine of Wessex is portrayed. It is also a setting in the Warlord Chronicles, a trilogy of books about Arthurian Britain written by Bernard Cornwell. Modern fiction has also used Glastonbury as a setting including The Age of Misrule series of books by Mark Chadbourn in which the Watchmen appear, a group selected from Anglican priests in and around Glastonbury to safeguard <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gate to the Otherworld on top of Glastonbury Tor. John Cowper Powys's novel A Glastonbury Romance is set in Glastonbury and is concerned with the Grail.|$|E

5|$|Keith {{finds out}} that Selma might have {{disappeared}} {{to get away from}} her husband. Veronica shows Wallace the Roman numerals, and they deduce that it is a date, and Veronica learns that a sorority house member died on that day. Veronica confronts a sorority girl about the dead member, and she implies that others believe that something happened to her. After finding out that leaving her husband after ten years would be beneficial to Selma, Veronica and Keith break into the Roses’ house and find Selma on the couch. Selma tells the pair why she has “disappeared”: Mr. Rose is trying to scam her for more money and has blackmailed her with <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> lesbian affair with her dog walker.|$|E
5|$|Securely {{attached}} {{children are}} {{best able to}} explore when they have the <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> secure base (their caregiver) to return to in times of need. When assistance is given, this bolsters the sense of security and also, assuming the parent's assistance is helpful, educates the child in {{how to cope with}} the same problem in the future. Therefore, secure attachment {{can be seen as the}} most adaptive attachment style. According to some psychological researchers, a child becomes securely attached when the parent is available and able to meet the needs of the child in a responsive and appropriate manner. At infancy and early childhood, if parents are caring and attentive towards their children, those children will be more prone to secure attachment.|$|E
5|$|Biogeographical {{patterns}} and range distributions are explained or predicted through <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> species' traits and niche requirements. Species have functional traits that are uniquely {{adapted to the}} ecological niche. A trait is a measurable property, phenotype, or characteristic of an organism that may influence its survival. Genes {{play an important role}} in the interplay of development and environmental expression of traits. Resident species evolve traits that are fitted to the selection pressures of their local environment. This tends to afford them a competitive advantage and discourages similarly adapted species from having an overlapping geographic range. The competitive exclusion principle states that two species cannot coexist indefinitely by living off the same limiting resource; one will always out-compete the other. When similarly adapted species overlap geographically, closer inspection reveals subtle ecological differences in their habitat or dietary requirements. Some models and empirical studies, however, suggest that disturbances can stabilize the co-evolution and shared niche occupancy of similar species inhabiting species-rich communities. The habitat plus the niche is called the ecotope, which is defined as the full range of environmental and biological variables affecting an entire species.|$|E
40|$|Frank Jackson’s famous Knowledge Argument {{moves from}} the premise that {{complete}} physical knowledge about experiences is not complete knowledge about experiences to the falsity of physicalism. Some physicalists (e. g., John Perry) have countered by arguing that what Jackson’s Mary, the perfect scientist who acquires all physical knowledge about experiencing red while being locked in a monochromatic room, lacks before experiencing red is merely <b>a</b> piece <b>of</b> recognitional <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> identity, and that since lacking <b>a</b> piece <b>of</b> recognitional <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> identity does not entail lacking any pieces <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> worldly facts, physicalism is safe. I will argue that what Mary lacks in her room is not merely <b>a</b> piece <b>of</b> recognitional <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> identity and that some physicalists have failed to see this because <b>of</b> <b>a</b> failure to appreciate that Mary’s epistemic progress when she first experiences red has two different stages. While the second epistemic stage can perhaps be plausibly considered as acquiring merely <b>a</b> piece <b>of</b> recognitional <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> identity, {{there is good reason}} to think that the first epistemic stage cannot be thus considered...|$|R

5|$|Students of Confucian {{studies were}} {{potential}} {{candidates for the}} imperial examinations, the graduates {{of which could be}} appointed as state bureaucrats in the local, provincial, and central government. There were two types of exams that were given, mingjing ('illuminating the classics examination') and jinshi ('presented scholar examination'). The mingjing was based upon the Confucian classics and tested the student's <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> broad variety of texts. The jinshi tested a student's literary abilities in writing essay-style responses to questions on matters of governance and politics, as well as their skills in composing poetry. Candidates were also judged on their skills of deportment, appearance, speech, and level of skill in calligraphy, all of which were subjective criteria that allowed the already wealthy members of society to be chosen over ones of more modest means who were unable to be educated in rhetoric or fanciful writing skills. There was a disproportionate number of civil officials coming from aristocratic as opposed to non-aristocratic families. The exams were open to all male subjects whose fathers were not of the artisan or merchant classes, although having wealth or noble status was not a prerequisite in receiving a recommendation. In order to promote widespread Confucian education, the Tang government established state-run schools and issued standard versions of the Five Classics with selected commentaries.|$|E

50|$|After {{ruling out}} the {{possibility}} <b>of</b> analytic <b>a</b> posteriori propositions, and explaining how we can obtain <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> analytic <b>a</b> priori propositions, Kant also explains how we can obtain <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> synthetic <b>a</b> posteriori propositions. That leaves only the question <b>of</b> how <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> synthetic <b>a</b> priori propositions is possible. This question is exceedingly important, Kant maintains, because all important metaphysical <b>knowledge</b> is <b>of</b> synthetic <b>a</b> priori propositions. If {{it is impossible to}} determine which synthetic a priori propositions are true, he argues, then metaphysics as a discipline is impossible. The remainder of the Critique of Pure Reason is devoted to examining whether and how <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> synthetic <b>a</b> priori propositions is possible.|$|R
