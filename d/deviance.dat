5|$|Criminologists analyse the nature, causes, {{and control}} of {{criminal}} activity, drawing upon methods across sociology, psychology, and the behavioural sciences. The sociology of <b>deviance</b> focuses on actions or behaviours that violate norms, including both formally enacted rules (e.g., crime) and informal violations of cultural norms. It is the remit of sociologists to study why these norms exist; how they change over time; {{and how they are}} enforced. The concept of social disorganization is when the broader social systems leads to violations of norms. For instance, Robert K. Merton produced a typology of <b>deviance,</b> which includes both individual and system level causal explanations of <b>deviance.</b>|$|E

5|$|Durkheim {{believed}} {{there was more to}} suicide than extremely personal individual life circumstances: for example, a loss of a job, divorce, or bankruptcy. Instead, he took suicide and explained it as a social fact instead of a result of one’s circumstances. Durkheim believed that suicide was an instance of social <b>deviance.</b> Social <b>deviance</b> being any transgression of socially established norms. He created a normative theory of suicide focusing on the conditions of group life. The four different types of suicide that he proposed are egoistic, altruistic, anomic, and fatalistic. He began by plotting social regulation on the x-axis of his chart, and social integration on the y-axis. Egoistic suicide corresponds to a low level of social integration. When one is not well integrated into a social group it can lead to a feeling that he or she has not made a difference in anyone’s lives. On the other hand, too much social integration would be altruistic suicide. This occurs when a group dominates the life of an individual to a degree where they feel meaningless to society. Anomic suicide occurs when one has an insufficient amount of social regulation. This stems from the sociological term anomie meaning a sense of aimlessness or despair that arises from the inability to reasonably expect life to be predictable. Lastly, there is fatalistic suicide, which results from too much social regulation. An example of this would be when one follows the same routine day after day. This leads to he or she believing there is nothing good to look forward to. Durkheim suggested this was the most popular form of suicide for prisoners.|$|E
5|$|Ian McCormick diagnoses the {{pamphlet}} as representing a gradual change in European {{discourse on the}} character of the sodomite: previous publications had discussed sexual <b>deviance</b> (conceived in contemporary terms) as a general evil; with Satan's Harvest Home a new attention was brought to the individual character of persons who committed sodomy. He argues that 'before the seventeenth century, sodomy was not even precisely differentiated from its demonic associations with werewolves, heretics, sorcerers, and the like. Increasingly, however, it came to be linked with pride, excess of diet, idleness, and contempt of the poor.' The pamphlet's equation of effeminacy with homosexuality is identified by Michael Kimmel as distinctive for the period.|$|E
5|$|Playford, used to {{cooperating}} with Labor leaders more than attacking them, sensed Dunstan's promise and, predicting {{that one day}} Dunstan {{would be at the}} helm, attempted to establish bonds. So, after a late session of parliament at night, Playford would give Dunstan a lift home in his car. As Dunstan's home was situated on George Street, Norwood, it was only a small <b>deviance</b> from Playford's normal route to his home in Norton Summit. The topics that the two discussed were not ever completely revealed, yet Playford, according to Dunstan, would talk to him in a paternalistic manner. The two built up somewhat of a relationship and developed a respect for each other, but due to the strength of their respective views (Playford was a liberal conservative, Dunstan a libertarian socialist), did not establish the same type of bond that Playford had with earlier Laborites.|$|E

40|$|Sport betting is {{a lucrative}} {{business}} for bookmakers, for the lucky (or wise) punters, {{but also for}} governments and for sport. While not new or even recent, the <b>deviances</b> linked to sport betting, primarily match-fixing, have gained increased media exposure in the past decade. This exploratory study is a qualitative content analysis of the press coverage of sport betting-related <b>deviances</b> in football in two countries (UK and France), using in each case two leading national publications {{over a period of}} five years. Data analysis indicates a mounting coverage of sport betting scandals, with teams, players and criminals increasingly framed as culprits, while authorities and federations primarily assume a positive role. As for the origin of sport betting <b>deviances,</b> French newspapers tend to blame the system (in an abstract way); British newspapers, in contrast, focus more on individual weaknesses, notably greed. This article contributed to the growing body of literature on the importance of these <b>deviances</b> and on the way they are perceived by sport organizations, legislators and the public at large...|$|R
40|$|The {{automatic}} processing of <b>deviances</b> from the temporal {{context of the}} visual environment has become an important topic in visual cognitive sciences, which is often investigated using the visual mismatch negativity (vMMN). This event-related potential (ERP) component is elicited by an irregular stimulus (e. g., a red disc) presented {{in a series of}} stimuli (e. g., green discs) comprising a temporal regularity (e. g., colour repetition). We determined the influence of lower- vs. upper-hemifield presentation of the irregular stimulus on the vMMN while using whole-field stimulus displays controlling for sustained shifts in spatial attention. <b>Deviances</b> presented in the lower hemifield elicited a larger vMMN than the ones presented in the upper hemifield at a latency of 200 – 280 ms. However, this asymmetry was preceded by deviance-related hemifield effects already emerging at an earlier latency (110 – 150 ms), where upper-hemifield <b>deviances</b> elicited a positive potential but lower-hemifield <b>deviances</b> did not. With variable resolution electromagnetic tomography (VARETA) early deviance-related activity was localised to retinotopically organised regions of the visual cortex (BA 17 / 18) and vMMN-sources were localised to the middle/superior occipital gyrus, to higher areas along the temporal visual stream, but also to BA 17 / 18. We argue that the upper/lower-hemifield vMMN asymmetry relies at least partially on the hemifield-dependent differential sensitivity of early deviance-related activity generated in retinotopically organised regions of the visual cortex. However, a superior {{automatic processing}} of <b>deviances</b> presented in the lower visual hemifield may also contribute to the effect...|$|R
5|$|The desecration of the {{two most}} sacred sites of Merina royalty {{represented}} a calculated political move intended to establish the political and cultural superiority of the French colonial power. In the popular view, the link between Ambohimanga and the ancestors (Andrianampoinimerina in particular) rendered the royal city an even more potent symbol and source of legitimate power than the capital of Antananarivo, which was seen as having become a locus of corrupt politics and <b>deviance</b> from ancestral tradition. Believing that the presence of the ancestors within the tombs sanctified the earth upon which the rova was built, Menalamba resistance fighters would come to Ambohimanga to collect handfuls of dirt {{from the base of the}} tombs to carry with them in their offensives against the French; the French authority intended by the removal of the sovereigns' bodies from the tombs to undermine the fighters' confidence and solidarity. Although the tombs were desecrated and the Menalamba fighters were ultimately defeated, Ambohimanga has retained its sacred character. The royal tombs were reconstructed in 2008 by the government of Madagascar under the Ravalomanana administration. During the 1995 fire that destroyed the tombs and other structures at the Rova of Antananarivo, the lamba-wrapped remains of only one sovereign—Ranavalona III—could be saved from the flames. The queen has since been re-interred in the royal tombs at Ambohimanga.|$|E

We investigate whether holistic scores could mask <b>deviances</b> in how underlying descriptors are interpreted and applied by the raters, as such <b>deviances</b> could compromise rating validity. We conducted a study with six raters, comparing a holistic approach with a combined approach whereby an analytic score for each descriptor was collected complementary to the holistic judgements. The results confirmed the initial hypothesis that holistic scores may mask <b>deviances</b> in how descriptors are applied. To monitor rating quality and enhance rating validity, we therefore recommend a complementary approach combining holistic scores with analytic, descriptor-focused scores. We illustrate the applicability of this approach by a successful implementation during rater training. Our findings contribute towards enhancing rater consistency and improving rating validity...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} divided in two parts: Part I {{provides}} an overview of the basic and clinical QEEG research fields, and is specifically aimed at addressing issues regarding the clinical application of QEEG in childhood disorders. Specific brain oscillations and event related potentials (ERP) have been found to reflect meaningful states, behaviors, and cognitive processes. Clinical studies on neuropsychiatric disorders have demonstrated differences in certain QEEG parameters in clinical populations compared to control groups, however, results have been inconsistent across studies. Studies searching for disorder-specific QEEG profiles in childhood disorders have demonstrated impressive classification accuracies in sorting patients from control groups. But the clinical application of QEEG metrics faces several issues, such as heterogeneity and comorbidity. Part II presents a multiple case study of 14 children referred to a neuropsychiatric unit for observation. QEEG analysis was conducted for each individual and provided a wide range of EEG measures that were compared to a normative database. All <b>deviances</b> were analyzed in relation to reported symptoms and problems, and performance measures. Results revealed significant <b>deviances</b> in two or more QEEG parameters for all of the participants, and furthermore, certain problem areas were found to correlate with spectral <b>deviances</b> in the alpha- and theta-bands. A discussion of the results particularly in relation to issues regarding clinical application of QEEG is provided, and suggests that the heterogeneity in childhood disorders are reflected in heterogeneity in the electrophysiological patterns associated with different symptom complexes, and interpretations of <b>deviances</b> faces similar biases as traditional diagnostics. </p...|$|R

40|$|Although {{our brain}} is not predestined for reading, as {{alphabetic}} scripts exist for around 3000 years, {{the vast majority}} of the population learns to read fluently, presumably by reorganizing the already established visual and language brain network. However, 3 to 7 % of the children do not learn to read fluently, and they develop dyslexia. According to the multiple deficit model of Pennington (2006) the aetiology of developmental dyslexia is multifactorial. Hence, developmental dyslexia is thought to result from impairments at different levels, i. e. the genetic, neurobiological, environmental and cognitive level, and from the interactions between these levels. Previous neuroimaging studies gained insights into the neural correlates of mature reading, showing that reading generally involves a widespread network of distinct regions in the left hemisphere of the brain. To date, it remains unclear how the brain reorganizes throughout the first stages of reading acquisition, and whether <b>deviances</b> in children with (a familial risk for) dyslexia are present prior to reading onset or emerge during reading acquisition. By three longitudinal studies (Chapters 2, 3, 5) and one methodological oriented study (Chapter 4), the main anatomical region considered to host phonemic representations, i. e. the planum temporale, and the most relevant white matter pathways are studied in relation to reading and to different levels of the multiple deficit model. In the first study (Chapter 2), we investigated planum temporale surface area in pre-readers and in adolescents. The results revealed atypical lateralization of the planum temporale in relation to a family history of dyslexia, rather than to the (later) reading level. In the second study (Chapter 3), we applied diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to investigate previously reported white matter anomalies in adults with dyslexia, in a longitudinal sample of pre-readers and early readers. We demonstrated that white matter <b>deviances</b> in the dorsal arcuate fasciculus are dynamic and precede reading acquisition, and moreover, ventral white matter <b>deviances</b> were detected in relation to a family history of dyslexia. The latter <b>deviances</b> were stable over time. Finally, we aimed at investigating reading induced structural brain changes, especially with regard to phonological processing and orthographic knowledge. Therefore, the higher order non-tensor Spherical Deconvolution (SD) model was applied. The results revealed that the relation between dorsal white matter and phonological processing precedes reading acquisition, and this relation is specific to the arcuate fasciculus (Chapter 4). The specialization of ventral white matter for orthographic knowledge, especially in the left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, emerges throughout the early stages of reading acquisition (Chapter 5). The results obtained within this doctoral dissertation are further discussed in a general discussion (Chapter 6). In sum, we demonstrate that neuroanatomical <b>deviances</b> can precede reading acquisition and that neural reorganization parallels the initial stages of reading development. While some <b>deviances</b> seem to relate to the emergence of developmental dyslexia, other <b>deviances</b> are merely related to a familial risk for dyslexia. These results emphasize the complex aetiology of developmental dyslexia. status: publishe...|$|R

25|$|Interestingly, {{fundamentally}} novel {{approaches for}} model choice that incorporate quality control {{as an integral}} {{step in the process}} have recently been proposed. ABC allows, by construction, estimation of the discrepancies between the observed data and the model predictions, with respect to a comprehensive set of statistics. These statistics are not necessarily the same as those used in the acceptance criterion. The resulting discrepancy distributions have been used for selecting models that are in agreement with many aspects of the data simultaneously, and model inconsistency is detected from conflicting and co-dependent summaries. Another quality-control-based method for model selection employs ABC to approximate the effective number of model parameters and the <b>deviance</b> of the posterior predictive distributions of summaries and parameters. The <b>deviance</b> information criterion is then used as measure of model fit. It has also been shown that the models preferred based on this criterion can conflict with those supported by Bayes factors. For this reason, it is useful to combine different methods for model selection to obtain correct conclusions.|$|E
