40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2014 This thesis {{argues that}} {{in the second half}} of the 19 th century, the Iraqi provinces of the Ottoman Empire {{constituted}} a frontier of imperial contestation between the Ottoman and British empires. The Ottoman Empire sought establish political hegemony over these far-flung provinces through military conquest and a program of developmentalist and colonialist policies in order to defend against the expansion of British strategic interests in the Persian Gulf. Simultaneously, a network of British commercial and diplomatic interests in Iraq sought to create conditions favorable to British economic expansion into this region, adopting strategies of "informal empire. " This contestation is visible <b>in</b> repeated <b>disputes</b> over <b>matters</b> of commercial shipping and the public health policies of quarantine in the face of plague and cholera.
