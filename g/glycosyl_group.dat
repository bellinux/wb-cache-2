It was found that UDP-gal, but not UDP-GlcNAc, also served as a sugar donor primarily through catalysis by UGT 2 B 7, although at a significantly reduced catalytic rate. These three UDP-sugars showed pH-dependent kinetics and ap-peared to compete with each other, with IC 50 values parallel to their respective apparent Km values. In contrast, only UDP-GlcA served as the sugar donor for the conjugation of diclofenac, a known UGT 2 B 7 substrate, with an apparent Km for UDP-GlcA of 96 17 M. UDP-Glc and UDP-gal, two futile sugar donors for diclofenac, were found to competitively inhibit the glucuronidation of this aglycone. Different from the case with Compound A, UDP-Glc and UDP-gal displayed Ki values of 2054 108 M and 1277 149 M,> 10 -fold greater than the Km for UDP-GlcA, indicating that these two nucleotide sugars were also capable of binding to the enzyme but with a lower affinity. The findings {{of this study indicate that}} the selectivity of UGT 2 B 7 toward UDP-sugars is aglycone-dependent. With Compound A as the acceptor substrate, human UGT 2 B 7 becomes more accommodative in {{the transfer of the}} <b>glycosyl</b> <b>group</b> from UDP-sugars beyond UDP-GlcA. The mecha-nism may involve enzyme conformational changes associated with Compound A binding to the enzyme. The UDP-glycosyltransferases are members of a superfamily of enzymes that catalyze the covalent conjugation of a variety of agly-cone substrates (acceptors) with the glycosyl moiety of UDP-sugars (donors) to form a glycosidic bond.

In nature, their occurence appears to be confined to selected lactic acid bacteria, notably those from the genus Lactobacillus. L. leichmannii possess two distinct nucleoside deoxyribosyltransf erases: N-deoxyribosyltransf erase -I, which mediates {{the transfer of}} the <b>glycosyl</b> <b>group</b> between purine bases exclusively, and N-deoxyribosyltransferase- 11 which catalyses {{the transfer of the}} 2 -deoxyribose sugar to and from purine and pyrimidine bases. These enzymes are capable of accepting a wide number of heterocyclic base analogues as substrates and the necessary structural requirements for a competent acceptor have been defined. Similarly, it has been established that the Ndeoxyribosyltran sf erase enzymes possess relatively little tolerance towards substrates with modified sugar moieties. The transfer reaction proceeds via an enzyme -substitution or ping-pong. bi-bi mechanism and kinetic and radiolabelling experiments provide reasonable support for the existence of a covalent glycosyl intermediate.

The relationships between the colour and the hydroxylation degree of the B ring and the pH have been studied for the first time on rutinosides. The peel extract showed much more colour stability than the jelly extract at all the pH values studied. The replacement of the 3 ′-OH with a <b>glycosyl</b> <b>group</b> increased the stability of the colour to pH changes, although this substitution yields a less colourful (higher L ∗ and lower View the MathML source) compound (Dp 3 -rut- 3 ′-glc), having both hypsochromic and hypochromic shifts relative to the non-glycosylated molecule (Dp 3 -rut).

The highest in vitro antioxidant activity determined by DPPH radical scavenging was achieved with rutin hydrolyzed by hesperidinase. Rutin was predominantly bioconverted into quercetin- 3 -glucoside. There was no statistical difference between xanthine oxidase inhibition by rutin before and after hydrolysis. However, in vitro inhibitory activity against ten human tumor cell lines showed that hydrolyzed rutin exerted a more potent antiproliferative effect than quercetin and rutin on various cancer cell lines, specially glioma, and ovarian and breast adenocarcinomas.

MaBGA displayed its maximum activity at pH 6. 0 and 60 °C, and maintained at least 90 % of its initial activity over the pH range of 5. 0 – 8. 0 after incubating for 1 h. It also exhibited considerable thermal stability, which retained 76 % of its initial activity after incubating at 50 °C for 6 h.

With the aid of homology modeling and molecular docking, we proposed a reasonable explanation for the linkage selectivity of MaBGA from a structural perspective.

40|$|Glycosphingolipid {{fragmentation}} {{behavior was}} investigated by combining results from {{analysis of a}} series of negative ion tandem mass spectra and molecular modeling. Fragmentation patterns extracted from 75 tandem mass spectra of mainly acidic glycosphingolipid species (gangliosides) suggest prominent cleavage of the glycosidic bonds with retention of the glycosidic oxygen atom by the species formed from the reducing end (B and Y ion formation). Dominant product ions arise from dissociation of sialic acids glycosidic bonds whereas product ions resulting from cleavage of other glycosidic bonds are less abundant. Potential energy surfaces and unimolecular reaction rates of several low-energy fragmentation pathways leading to cleavage of glycosidic bonds were estimated in order to explain observed dissociation patterns. Glycosidic bond cleavage in both neutral (unsubstituted <b>glycosyl</b> <b>group)</b> and acidic glycosphingolipids was the outcome of the charge-directed intramolecular nucleophilic substitution (SN 2) mechanism. According to the suggested mechanism, the nucleophile in a form of carboxylate or oxyanion attacks the carbon at position one of the sugar ring, simultaneously breaking the glycosidic bond and yielding an epoxide. For gangliosides, unimolecular reaction rates suggest that dominant product ions related to the cleavage of sialic acid glycosidic bonds are formed via direct dissociation channels. On the other hand, low abundant product ions related to the dissociation of other glycosidic bonds {{are more likely to be}} the result of sequential dissociation. Although results from this study mainly contribute to the understanding of glycosphingolipid fragmentation chemistry, some mechanistic findings regarding cleavage of the glycosidic bond may be applicable to other glycoconjugates...|$|E

Peptide mass fingerprinting of in-gel tryptic digests (using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) in reflectron mode with alpha-cyano- 4 -hydroxycinnamic acid as the matrix) identified 10 forms of K-casein with isoelectric point (pl) values from 4. 47 to 5. 81, but could not distinguish between them. MALDI-TOF MS in linear mode, using sinapinic acid as the matrix, revealed a large tryptic peptide (mass > 5990 Da) derived from the C-terminus that contained all the known sites of genetic variance, phosphorylation and glycosylation.

Among them, galactoliposomes that can be recognized by the asialoglycoprotein receptors (ASGPR) expressed by the hepatocyte (Rigopoulou et al. 2012) are the most extensively developed, and are considered to be promising non-viral vectors for target-specific treatment of hepatic diseases (Sliedregt et al. 1999; Zhao et al. 2011; Symens et al. 2012; Hu et al. 2013; Jain et al. 2012). Monosaccharides are linked to each other or with an aglycon in either the α- or β-configuration (at the anomeric carbon) to form cell-surface ‘antennas’, such as glycoproteins or glycolipids, that transmit signals between cells (Varki 1993; Bertozzi and Kiessling 2001; Seeberger 2005; Hart and Copeland 2010). These anomeric counterparts may, however, possess different physiochemical attributes, thereby leading to a diversification of biological function. In addition, some synthetic anomeric glycolipids have shown distinct pharmacological properties (He et al. 2011). Despite the fruitful results obtained in the investigation of glycolipid-based liposomal transfection (Ueno et al. 2007), to our knowledge, investigations on the properties of anomeric galacto-liposomes have been elusive.|$|E
40|$|EndoSe from Streptococcus equi subsp. equi is {{an enzyme}} hydrolyzing <b>glycosyl</b> <b>groups</b> on IgG, {{analogous}} to EndoS from Strepto-coccus pyogenes. We here {{show that the}} activity of EndoSe leads to an antiphagocytic function and may thus be a contributory factor to immune evasion of S. equi. Despite the damaging effect that EndoSe has on IgG, antibodies against EndoSe can neutral-ize its function. Antibodies against EndoSe restored the opsonic activity of specific opsonizing antibodies. Mice infected with either S. equi subsp. equi or subsp. zooepidemicus or S. pyogenes could be protected by vaccination with EndoSe. It is speculated that EndoSe could be a suitable vaccine candidate against streptococcal infections. EndoS is a glycosyl hydrolase from Streptococcus pyogenes,which can hydrolyze the glycan on the IgG Fc region (4, 5, 7). For IgG, there is a conserved asparagine residue (position 297 in human IgG), which {{is known to be}} linked to glucans in different species. The N-linked sugars that are attached to IgG have a com-mon biantenna core structure, consisting of two N-acetylglucos-amines (GlcNAc) and three mannoses. The Fc region is recog-nized by Fc receptors on phagocytic cells and is also required for complement activation. The intactness of the Fc region is required for recognition (16), and the hydrolysis by EndoS of the glyca...|$|R
40|$|Flavobacteria are {{a poorly}} {{understood}} and speciated group of commensal bacteria and opportunistic pathogens. The psychrotroph Flavobacterium psychrophilum is the etiological agent of rainbow trout fry syndrome and bacterial cold water disease, septicemic diseases that heavily impact salmonids. Consequently, two verified but geographically diverse isolates were characterized phenotypically and biochemically. A facile typing system was devised which readily discriminated between {{closely related species}} and was verified against a pool of recent prospective isolates. F. psychrophilum {{was found to be}} enveloped in a loosely attached, strongly antigenic outer layer comprised of a predominant, highly immunogenic, low-molecular-mass carbohydrate antigen as well as several protein antigens. Surface-exposed antigens were visualized by a combination of immunoflourescence microscopy, immunogold transmission, and thin-section electron microscopy and were discriminated by Western blotting using rabbit antisera, by selective extraction with EDTA-polymyxin B agarose beads, and by extrinsic labeling of amines with sulfo–N-hydoxysuccinimide–biotin and <b>glycosyl</b> <b>groups</b> with biotin hydrazide. The predominant ∼ 16 kDa antigen was identified as low-molecular-mass lipopolysaccharide (LPS), whereas high-molecular-mass LPS containing O antigen was not as prevalent on whole cells but was abundant in culture supernatants. Rainbow trout convalescent antisera recognized both molecular mass classes of LPS as well as a predominant ∼ 20 -kDa protein. This study represents the first description at the molecular level of the surface characteristics and potential vaccine targets of confirmed F. psychrophilum strains...|$|R
40|$|We have {{compared}} the intraleukocytic survival of isogenic strains of Salmonella typhimurium, whose outer membrane lipopolysaccharide differed in O antigen and lipid A composition and whose susceptibility to nonoxidative antimicrobial granule proteins of human polymorphonuclear neutrophilis (PMN) could be established. We {{found that the}} order {{of resistance to the}} bactericidal activity of intact PMN of the three bacterial strains utilized closely resembled their ordered resistance to the purified human cationic antimicrobial 57, 000 -dalton protein (CAP 57). LT- 2, a smooth wild-type strain, was far more resistant than SH 9178, its rough (Rb LPS) mutant. It was most significant that SH 7426, a polymyxin B-resistant pmrA mutant of SH 9178, not only was substantially more resistant to CAP 57 and to intraphagocytic killing than SH 9178 but also came close to being as resistant as LT- 2. These experiments confirm earlier work that showed the importance of the <b>glycosyl</b> <b>groups</b> of O antigens of S. typhimurium for their resistance to O 2 -independent antimicrobial phagocytosis by PMN. The surprising result was that a rough strain, very susceptible to bactericide, became substantially more resistant when a mutation led to its lipid A phosphoryl groups being 100 % substituted with amino pentoses. Yet unresolved is whether the protection is due to the loss of negative charges on the lipid A, the substitution of sugar molecules in vulnerable loci in the outer membrane, or both...|$|R
