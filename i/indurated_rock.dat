40|$|We use seismic {{reflection}} and refraction data to determine crustal structure, to map a fore-arc basin containing 12 km of sediment, and to image the subduction thrust at 35 km depth. Seismic reflection megasequences within the basin are correlated with onshore geology: megasequence X, Late Cretaceous and Paleogene marine passive margin sediments; megasequence Y, a similar to 10, 000 km(3) submarine landslide emplaced during subduction initiation at 22 Ma; and megasequence Z, a Neogene subduction margin megasequence. The Moho lies at 17 km beneath the basin center and at 35 km {{at the southern}} margin. Beneath the western basin margin, we interpret reflective units as deformed Gondwana fore-arc sediment that was thrust in Cretaceous time over oceanic crust 7 km thick. Raukumara Basin has normal faults at its western margin and is uplifted along its eastern and southern margins. Raukumara Basin represents a rigid fore-arc block > 150 km long, which contrasts with widespread faulting and large Neogene vertical axis rotations farther south. Taper of {{the western edge of}} allochthonous unit Y and westward thickening and downlap of immediately overlying strata suggest westward or northwestward paleoslope and emplacement direction rather than southwestward, as proposed for the correlative onshore allochthon. Spatial correlation between rock uplift of the eastern and southern basin margins with the intersection between Moho and subduction thrust leads us to suggest that crustal underplating is modulated by fore-arc crustal thickness. The trench slope has many small extensional faults and lacks coherent internal reflections, suggesting collapse of <b>indurated</b> <b>rock,</b> rather than accretion of > 1 km of sediment from the downgoing plate. The lack of volcanic intrusion east of the active arc, and stratigraphic evidence for the broadening of East Cape Ridge with time, suggests net fore-arc accretion since 22 Ma. We propose a cyclical fore-arc kinematic: rock moves down a subduction channel to near the base of the crust, where underplating drives rock uplift, oversteepens the trench slope, and causes collapse toward the trench and subduction channel. Cyclical rock particle paths led to persistent trench slope subsidence during net accretion. Existing global estimates of fore-arc loss are systematically too high because they assume vertical particle paths. Citation: Sutherland, R., et al.

However, laboratory simulation of natural reactions under controlled conditions facilitates identification of specific factors which may contribute {{to changes in the}} physical behaviour of weathered rocks. Experiments in which the Carboniferous Edale Shale was reacted with sulphuric acid of a concentration commensurate with that generated under natural conditions showed that the acid composition was markedly altered. Furthermore, the acid composition became qualitatively similar to that observed in a natural shale weathering system by Vear & Curtis (1981). Natural reactions may thus be reproduced in the laboratory. The influence of pore solution composition on the residual shear strength and plasticity properties of Edale Shale were investigated using KNO, NaN 03, acid and groundwater from a major landslip at Mam Tor, Derbyshire. These engineering properties were found to be sensitive to porewater composition and concentration. The effects of physical breakdown on rock properties are less easy to assess because standard techniques for measuring grain size distributions, particularly the < 2 m size fraction are unreliable for <b>indurated</b> <b>rocks.</b> A statistical correlation between the < 2 m fraction and the Si 02 /A 1203 ratio was found to give a better estimate of the amount of fine material present in a sample. Using this method it was determined that rapid physical weathering does not reduce consolidated material to its fundamental grain size. In addition, residual shear strength and plasticity were found to be independent of the state of physical breakdown and are apparently influenced more strongly by mineralogy. The implications of these investigations to slope stability are considered for the case of a major rotational landslip at Mam Tor, Derbyshire. Finally, a model is proposed in which weathering is divided into distinct components, each capable of separate investigation...|$|R
40|$|In weakly indurated, nannofossil-rich, deep-sea carbonates {{compressional wave}} {{velocity}} {{is up to}} twice as fast parallel to bedding than normal to it. It {{has been suggested that}} this anisotropy is due to alignment of calcite c-axes perpendicular to the shields of coccoliths and shield deposition parallel to bedding. This hypothesis was tested by measuring the preferred orientation (fabric) of calcite c-axes in acoustic anisotropic, calcareous DSDP sediment samples by X-ray goniometry, and {{it was found that the}} maximum c-axis concentrations are by far too low to explain the anisotropies. The X-ray method is subject to a number of uncertainties due to preparatory and technical shortcomings in weakly <b>indurated</b> <b>rocks.</b> The most serious weaknesses are: sample preparation, volume of measured sample (fraction of a mm 3), beam defocusing and background intensity corrections, combination of incomplete pole figures, and necessity of recalculation of the c-axis orientations from other crystallographic directions. Goniometry using thermal neutrons overcomes most of these difficulties, but it is time consuming. We test the interferences made about velocity anisotropy by X-ray studies about the concentration of c-axes in deep-sea carbonates by employing neutron texture goniometry to eight DSDP samples comprising mostly nannofossil material. Fabric and sonic velocity were determined directly on the core specimens, thus from the same rock volume and requiring no preparation. The c-axis orientation is obtained directly from the [0006] calcite diffraction peak without corrections. The fabrics are clearly defined, but weak (1. 1 to 1. 86 times uniform) with the maximum about normal to bedding. They have crudely orthorhombic symmetry, but are not axisymmetric around the bedding normal. The observed c-axis intensities, although higher than determined by the X-ray method on other samples, are by far too low to explain the observed acoustic anisotropies...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the effective stress in <b>indurated</b> clay <b>rock</b> theoretically and experimentally. A stress concept {{is derived from}} the analysis of the microstructure and of the pore water in the highly-indurated Callovo-Oxfordian and Opalinus clay rocks, and subsequently validated by various experiments performed on these claystones. The concept suggests that the interparticle or effective stress in a dense clay–water system is transferred through both the adsorbed interparticle pore water in narrow pores and the solid–solid contact between non-clay mineral grains. The experiments show that the adsorbed pore water in the claystones is capable of bearing deviatoric effective stresses up to the failure strength. The applied stresses are for the most part or even totally transferred by the bound pore water, i. e. the swelling pressure in the interparticle bound pore water is almost equivalent to the effective stress. This stress concept provides a reasonable view {{to the nature of the}} effective stress in argillaceous rock and forms the fundamental basis for studies of the hydro-mechanical properties and processes in clay formations...|$|R

The impacts of ground shaking were notably {{felt in the}} central and western portions of the island that are underlain by poorly indurated sandstones and limestones. To identify areas that are prone to earthquake-triggered landslide hazards, we evaluated geologic and geomorphologic data, and utilized the semi-quantitative Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and geographic information system (GIS). A susceptibility rating or weight influence was assigned to each factor that affects landslide occurrences such as lithology, peak ground acceleration (PGA), slope angle, slope aspect, distance from fault, and road and drainage network. Geospatial analysis of the predisposing factors enabled the zonation of maps into areas of low, moderate, and high susceptibility to landslides. The strong influence of lithologic characteristics on slope failures is further revealed as areas with high susceptibility to landslides generally situate at the western portion of Bohol Island where poorly <b>indurated</b> sedimentary <b>rocks</b> underlie the terrain. This study demonstrates the usefulness of AHP and GIS in the rapid and efficient identification of areas that are potentially at risk from the impacts of attendant geological hazards such as landslides. 1...|$|R
40|$|Two {{examples}} of carbonate-beach rock formation {{have been studied}} in Tunisia and on the Bahamas. It appears evident that cementation takes place under a cover of sediment where the carbonate grains are immobilized and where primary cements are precipitated in a marine or fresh-water, phreatic or vadose environment close to the water table. Oblique beach stratification and keystone vugs (typical for the swash zone) are thus preserved. Coastal erosion exposes this preferentially cemented layer, and marine cementation in the intertidal zone further <b>indurates</b> the <b>rock.</b> Wave action often washes away the underlying non-consolidated sediment. This causes the beach rock to break into blokes which (by gravity) may glide into the subtidal zone. Except for secondary marine vadose cements, all cements types found in beach rocks also occur in other environments. The identification of ancient beach rocks should therefore not be based on cementation criteria only, but also on sedimentary structures and on stratigraphic context. Davaud Eric, Strasser André.

40|$|Carbonate rocks can be {{classified}} in terms of those properties relating to the pore system of lithified sediments, so-called ‘petrophysical rock types’, or ‘depositional rock types’ which are categorized based on characteristics directly reflecting their original depositional environment. Whereas petrophysical rock types are typically used to identify and distribute rock bodies within a reservoir with similar flow characteristics, depositional rock types ignore pore types and capture sedimentary structures, lithology and fossils. Both classification systems are extensively used to describe reservoir rocks, but the degree of plurality between them remains poorly understood and is the motivation for this study. To examine the degree of congruency between the two classification schemes, a field assessment was conducted for a 175 km 2 area situated offshore Al Ruwais, northern Qatar, encompassing depositional environments spanning supratidal, intertidal, shallow subtidal and open marine conditions. A total of 350 surficial sediment samples were collected along 24 shore-normal transects. Each sample was assigned a ‘petrophysical rock type’ class based on analysis of sedimentary texture (grain size and sorting). ‘Depositional rock type’ classes, by contrast, were defined with reference to faunal content and, in turn, classes of mineralogy were delimited by weighting this content against the mineralogy of each faunal category. Of course, the samples studied correspond to unconsolidated sediments and not to <b>indurated</b> <b>rocks.</b> However, considering only primary porosity and permeability preservation, {{it is reasonable to}} assume that the classified sediments would become petrophysical rock types and depositional rock types when consolidated, following their primary grain size, sorting and grain type distribution. Therefore, the term ‘rock type’ is retained here for ease of terminology but, for clarity, these are sediment samples. The discrete samples were interpolated into continuous surfaces describing the distribution of depositional rock types, petrophysical rock types and mineralogy, and spatial correspondence between those surfaces was statistically evaluated. In order to link these parameters with environment of deposition, their correlation with water depth (as audited from airborne light detection and ranging) and ecological habitat (mapped from DigitalGlobe satellite imagery) was also assessed. The data reveal that spatial distributions of sedimentary faunal, petrographic and mineralogical properties do not show exactly congruent patterns. Other meaningful trends do exist, however. For example, the occurrence of certain depositional rock types is indicative of particular petrophysical rock types, and vice versa. Further, connections between petrophysical rock types and mineralogy are emphasized and offer insight as to how the evolution of matrix porosity might be predicted via diagenetic models tuned to specific sediment textures. Useful relationships are also identified between the occurrence of petrophysical rock types and depositional rock types, and both ecological habitat and water depth. The potential of such dualities is two-fold. Firstly, they can be applied to more realistically distribute petrophysical rock types and depositional rock types by environment of deposition in reservoir models and, secondly, the use of modern carbonate systems as subsurface analogues might be enhanced...|$|R
40|$|Geological {{repositories}} {{have been}} considered a feasible option worldwide for storing high-level nuclear waste. Clay rock {{is one of the}} rock types under consideration for such purposes, because of its favorable features to prevent radionuclide transport from the repository. Coupled hydromechanical processes have an important impact on the performance of a clay repository, and establishing constitutive relationships for modeling such processes are essential. In this study, we propose several constitutive relationships for elastic deformation in <b>indurated</b> clay <b>rocks</b> based on three recently developed concepts. First, when applying Hooke's law in clay rocks, true strain (rock volume change divided by the current rock volume), rather than engineering strain (rock volume change divided by unstressed rock volume), should be used, except when the degree of deformation is very small. In the latter case, the two strains will be practically identical. Second, because of its inherent heterogeneity, clay rock can be divided into two parts, a hard part and a soft part, with the hard part subject to a relatively small degree of deformation compared with the soft part. Third, for swelling rock like clay, effective stress needs to be generalized to include an additional term resulting from the swelling process. To evaluate our theoretical development, we analyze uniaxial test data for core samples of Opalinus clay and laboratory measurements of single fractures within macro-cracked Callovo-Oxfordian argillite samples subject to both confinement and water reduced swelling. The results from this evaluation indicate that our constitutive relationships can adequately represent the data and explain the related observations...|$|R

40|$|Knowledge of the {{mechanisms}} and controls of ice stream flow {{is fundamental to}} understanding ice discharge from large ice sheets. Here, we utilise an extensive (9950 km 2) marine geophysical dataset (comprising multibeam swath bathymetry, sub-bottom and seismic profiles) to describe the geomorphological signature of a 265 km-long, 65 km-wide palaeo-ice stream in the western Amundsen Sea Embayment, West Antarctica. We show that substrate was a dominant control on the ice streams relict bedform morphology. Data illustrate a large convergent streaming system, which drained through a cross-shelf trough at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), and probably during past glaciations. The sea-floor geomorphic imprint of the ice stream comprises more than 4000 elements, which have been digitised and mapped in a GIS. These include mega-scale glacial lineations (MSGLs), drumlins, meltwater channels, and grounding zone wedges. Bed roughness analysis and seismic profiles show that the former ice substrate was characterised by regions of rugged acoustic basement on the inner shelf (consisting of bedrock or <b>indurated</b> sedimentary <b>rocks)</b> and relatively smooth, truncated sedimentary strata, on the mid-to-outer shelf. A landsystem interpretation of the superimposed bed signature reveals a strong correlation to the substrate type, which can be sub-divided into five landsystem components: (1) a meltwater assemblage, (2) a composite ice sheet assemblage, (3) a sub-ice stream footprint group, (4) grounding line retreat morphology, and (5) a pro-marginal deglacial group. The MSGLs record a simple snapshot of the sole of the ice stream flowing over sediments, {{towards the end of}} the last glaciation, and although they are masked by iceberg ploughmarks on the outer shelf, we infer an extensive ice sheet in this sector at the LGM. By contrast, detailed landform mapping of the inner shelf convergence zone demonstrates overprinting, preservation and a time-transgressive history for the inner shelf landform groups, implying that bedforms, when viewed together, cannot be considered part of a single down-flow continuum, as suggested previously. Variability among inner shelf bedform types, their geometry and elongation also reveals information about local, complex basal-ice conditions and dynamics, not apparent at the scale of regional morphological studies, and which heavily influenced the bedform imprint. Thus, while we believe the analysis of a complete morphological dataset is a robust method for interpreting broad and localised palaeo-ice flow characteristics from bed signatures, we suggest that direct inferences about the dynamics and velocity of former ice streams, from limited bedform information, should be treated with caution...|$|R
40|$|Typescript. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Hawaii at Manoa, 1974. Bibliography: leaves 155 - 164. viii, 164 leaves ill., mapSedimentary phosphorites sampled {{from the}} sea floor off the coasts of Peru and Chile have been {{investigated}} to establish their ages and mode of formation. Uranium-series disequilibrium studies verify that phosphate deposits are currently forming in that area. The distribution of radiometric ages over the past 150, 000 years implies that phosphate deposition was episodic rather than continuous during the late Pleistocene. Radiometric ages correlate well with periods of high eustatic stands of the sea. The fractionation of uranium isotopes between oxidation states (IV) and (VI) in these relatively young phosphorites is low as compared with that in older deposits. The relative amount of U(IV) contained in phosphate deposits {{appears to be a}} function of the extent of the reducing environment during deposition and how much, if any, of the uranium had been oxidized since incorporation into the apatite structure. The bulk chemical and mineralogical compositions of the phosphate rocks reflect varying degrees of dilution of the phosphatic material, apatite, by other authigenic minerals and various allogenic components. Electron probe microanalysis shows that the composition of the phosphate rocks is complex, i. e., the rocks are derived from more than one phase, even within extremely small areas. Examination with the scanning electron microscope (SEM) of freshly fractured surfaces of phosphate rocks and small pellets from associated diatomaceous ooze suggests that the apatite was authigenic and had formed as a direct chemical precipitate rather than by replacement. Some surfaces of siliceous biogenic materials appear to act as sites for apatite nucleation. The model of phosphorite formation hypothesized here involves inorganic precipitation of apatite within anoxic pore waters and subsequent concentration of the apatite by physical processes. Oxidation of organic materials (mainly diatoms) during SO 42 - reduction is the main source of dissolved phosphate. Apatite precipitation is favored by the high phosphate concentration in the interstitial waters, especially where the sediments have been deposited in highly oxygen-deficient waters, and by diagenetic reactions which remove interfering Mg 2 + ions within the sediments. The common association of apatite with Mg-bearing phases (chlorite, sepiolite, dolomite) within the sediments from the Peru shelf supports the view that reactions resulting in Mg 2 + depletion in pore waters are essential for apatite precipitation. Reactions such as dolomitization, replacement of Fe 3 + by Mg 2 + in clays (Drever, 1971), and the authigenic formation of Mg-si 1 icates are proposed as the most likely controls of the Mg 2 + content in anoxic pore waters from this region. The concentration of apatite into <b>indurated</b> phosphate <b>rocks</b> is brought about by winnowing and reworking processes, possibly in response to a change in the sedimentary environment caused by eustatic sea-level fluctuations or tectonic movements...|$|R
40|$|The Las Vegas {{ground-water}} basin {{as described}} in this report includes {{the southern part of}} Indian Spring Valley, Three Lakes Valley, the northern half of Ivanpah Valley, and Las Vegas Valley. These valleys in part are inferred to form a hydrologic unit that includes an area of about 3, 000 square miles {{in the southern part of}} Clark County, Nev. The valleys forming the Las Vegas ground-water basin are broad structural depressions surrounded by mountains. The climate of the region is arid, and precipitation in the basin lowlands rarely exceeds 5 inches per year. Drainage is interior except for occasional Hood runoff and waste from the industrial plants at Henderson; the occasional flood runoff and waste flow through the Las Vegas Wash to Lake Mead. The mountain ranges are composed of <b>indurated</b> <b>rocks</b> that impede the movement of ground water from the basin and form the boundary of the ground-water reservoir. The valley fill that forms the principal ground-water reservoir is composed of a thick sequence ranging from Miocene (?) through Recent in age. Most of the ground water is in a large leaky artesian system comprising four principal zones of aquifers—the deep, middle, and shallow zones of artesian aquifers and the near-surface zone of water-table aquifers. To facilitate quantitative analyses of recharge, discharge, and yield, the aquifers have been divided arbitrarily into an artesian system, which includes the three principal artesian aquifers, and the near-surface water-table system. Natural recharge to the artesian system is from precipitation in the mountainswithin the drainage area of the basin. As ground water moves from areas ofrecharge toward areas of discharge in the lower parts of Las Vegas Valley, itbecomes confined between relatively impermeable beds. Nearly imperviousbarriers caused by faulting of the valley fill impede the lateral movement of the ground water. Artesian pressure causes the water to leak upward along thefaults into shallow aquifers. The average annual natural recharge to the Las Vegas artesian system was estimated by the following methods: (1) Estimation of consumptive use by phreatophytes under natural conditions prior to ground-water development; (2) estimation of ground-water underflow to the Las Vegas area during a period of near-stability in the ground-water reservoir; and (3) study of the relationship between precipitation and recharge during periods of equilibrium in the ground-water reservoir. Estimates of the natural recharge based on these methods suggest that the average annual natural recharge to the basin is on the order of 25, 000 acre-feet. The total draft on the artesian aquifers in 1955 was approximately 48, 000 acre-feet, of which about 42, 000 acre-feet was from wells and springs and about 6, 000 acre-feet was from upward leakage. Therefore, overdraft on the artesian reservoir in 1955 was about 23, 000 acre-feet. Recharge to the near-surface reservoir in 1955 was derived from upward leakage from the underlying artesian aquifers and by infiltration of waste water. The total estimated recharge to the near-surface reservoir in 1955 was about 25, 000 acre-feet. The draft on the near-surface reservoir in 1955 was about 25, 000 acre-feet, of which about 24, 000 acre-feet was discharged by phreatophytes and about 1, 000 acre-feet was discharged by wells. During this study, the near-surface reservoir was in a state of approximate dynamic equilibrium. The above data indicate that the overdraft on the entire Las Vegas ground-water basin in 1955 was approximately equal to the overdraft on the artesian aquifers—that is, about 23, 000 acre-feet. As the artesian heads continue to decline in Las Vegas Valley, the quantity ofground water lost through upward leakage and subsequent transpiration willdecrease. Conditions of optimum development of the artesian system will beachieved when the artesian heads have been lowered to about 50 feet below land surface, because most of the upward leakage that is currently discharged by phreatophytes will have been eliminated. At the present rate of decline of the artesian head and with the present distribution and amount of withdrawals, the artesian head will be lowered sufficiently to prevent most natural discharge in the Las Vegas area in about 40 years and in the Paradise Valley area in about 75 years. The maximum sustained yield that can be developed from the artesian aquifers when the artesian head has been lowered below the root zone of phreatophytes will be limited to the approximate average annual natural recharge to the artesian system plus the amount of nonconsumptively used ground water and imported water which becomes available for reuse through downward leakage or artificial recharge. The accumulated annual discharge from the Las Vegas artesian aquifers hasexceeded the accumulated recharge since the development of the first successful well in 1906, and as a result the artesian pressure has declined almost uninterruptedly from year to year since that time. The artesian head in selected observation wells in the vicinity of Las Vegas and Paradise Valley declined about 30 feet between 1941 and 1956. During this time the approximate cumulative overdraft amounted to about 300, 000 acre-feet. The amount of overdraft per foot of lowering of artesian head within the area of approximately 40 square miles represented by the observation wells during this period was about 10, 000 acre-feet. The chemical quality of the ground water in Las Vegas Valley is, in general,better in the northern than in the southern part of the valley. In the northernpart of the valley, water from the shallow and middle zones of aquifers is of better quality than water in the deep zone of aquifers. As the ground water migrates southward into the Paradise Valley and the Whitney-Pittman areas, the water in the middle and shallow zones becomes more mineralized than the water in the deep zone of aquifers. The lowering of artesian head in the Las Vegas area between 1935 and 1950 has caused about 180 millimeters of local land subsidence in the vicinity of the Bonanza Street underpass, where the sediments are predominantly clay and silt. In the western part of the valley, where the sediments are predominantly sand and gravel, subsidence during the same period of time was negligible...|$|R
40|$|The Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) has {{observed}} a high-silica {{material in the}} dark regions of Mars that is spectrally similar to obsidian glass and may have a volcanic origin. An alternate interpretation is that the spectrally amorphous material consists of clay minerals or some other secondary material, formed by chemical alteration of surface rocks. The regions where this material is observed (e. g., Acidalia Planitia) have relatively high spectral contrast, suggesting that the high-silica material exists as coarse particulates, indurated soils or cements, within <b>rocks,</b> or as <b>indurated</b> coatings on <b>rock</b> surfaces. The geologic interpretation of this spectral result has major implications for understanding magmatic evolution and weathering processes on Mars. One of the complications in interpreting spectral observations of glasses and clay minerals is that both are structurally and compositionally complex. In this study, we perform a detailed spectroscopic analysis of indurated smectite clay minerals and relate their thermal emission spectral features to structural and crystal chemical properties. We examine the spectral {{similarities and differences between}} smectite clay minerals and obsidian glass from a structural-chemical perspective, and make further mineralogical interpretations from previous TES results. The results suggest that neither smectite clays nor any clay mineral with similar structural and chemical properties can adequately explain TES observations of high-silica materials in some martian dark regions. If the spectrally amorphous materials observed by TES do represent an alteration product, then these materials are likely to be poorly crystalline aluminosilicates. While all clay minerals have Si/O ratios ≤ 0. 4, the position of the emissivity minimum at Mars suggests a Si/O ratio of 0. 4 - 0. 5. The spectral observation could be explained by the existence of a silica-rich alteration product, such as Al- or Fe-bearing opal, an intimate physical mixture of relatively pure silica and other aluminosilicates (such as clay minerals or clay precursors), or certain zeolites. The chemical alteration of basaltic rocks on Mars to phyllosilicate-poor, silica-rich alteration products provides a geologically reasonable and consistent explanation for the global TES surface mineralogical results. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.
