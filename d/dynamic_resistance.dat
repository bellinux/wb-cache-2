5000|$|The {{quiescent}} current {{has to be}} constant to ensure constant collector voltages at common mode. This requirement is not so important {{in the case of}} a differential output since the two collector voltages will vary simultaneously but their difference (the output voltage) will not vary. But {{in the case of a}} single-ended output, it is extremely important to keep a constant current since the output collector voltage will vary. Thus the higher the resistance of the current source , the lower (better) is the common mode gain [...] The constant current needed can be produced by connecting an element (resistor) with very high resistance between the shared emitter node and the supply rail (negative for NPN and positive for PNP transistors) but this will require high supply voltage. That is why, in more sophisticated designs, an element with high differential (<b>dynamic)</b> <b>resistance</b> approximating a constant current source/sink is substituted for the “long tail” (Figure 3).

With the need for the use of thinner sheet, the dent resistance became one of the major concern in th design of exterior panels in automotive industry. Many studies have been carried out for the dent resistance by experiment or quasi-static numerical simulation. In this study, the dent formation behavior is investigated by dynamic finite element analysis using ABAQUS. Dent formation may be affected by many factors such as sheet thickness, material properties, pre-strain, and sheet curvature. The effect of these factors on dent resistance is investigated. From the analysis following three conclusions are derived. First, dent resistance become hard as the sheet curvature radius increases. Second, <b>dynamic</b> dent <b>resistance</b> is mainly affected by bending stress rather than tensile stress. Third, the pre-strain itself do not give any guidance for <b>dynamic</b> dent <b>resistance</b> and <b>dynamic</b> dent <b>resistance</b> have to be decided considering the strain hardening and thickness reduction together.
