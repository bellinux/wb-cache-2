40|$|Many {{graduate}} {{medical education}} (GME) programs {{have started to}} consider and adopt entrustable professional activities (EPAs) in their competency frameworks. Do EPAs also {{have a place in}} undergraduate medical education (UME) ? In this Perspective article, the authors discuss arguments in favor of the use of EPAs in UME. A competency framework that aligns UME and GME outcome expectations would allow for better integration across the educational continuum. The EPA approach would be consistent with what is known about progressive skill development. The key principles underlying EPAs, workplace learning and trust, are generalizable and would also be applicable to UME learners. Lastly, EPAs could increase transparency in the workplace regarding student abilities and help ensure safe and quality patient care. The authors also outline what UME EPAs might look like, suggesting core, specialty-specific, and elective EPAs related to core clinical residency entry expectations and learner interest. UME EPAs would be defined as essential health care activities with which one would expect to entrust a resident at the beginning of residency to perform without direct supervision. Finally, the authors recommend a refinement and expansion of the <b>entrustment</b> <b>and</b> <b>supervision</b> scale previously developed for GME to better incorporate the supervision expectations for UME learners. They suggest that EPAs could be operationalized for UME if UME-specific EPAs were developed and the entrustment scale were expanded...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Entrustable Professional Activities (EPAs) are {{increasingly}} {{used as a}} focus for assessment in graduate medical education (GME). However, a consistent approach to guide EPA design is currently lacking, in particular concerning the actual content (knowledge, skills and attitude required for specific tasks) for EPAs. This paper describes a comprehensive five stage approach, which was used to develop two specialty-specific EPAs in emergency medicine focused on {{the first year of}} GME. METHODS: The five stage approach was used to gain consensus on the task, content and entrustment scale for two specialty-specific EPAs in emergency medicine. The participants consisted of twelve clinical supervisors working in the emergency department. The five stages were: 1) Selecting the EPA topic; 2) Developing the EPA content by collecting data from participants using focus group and individual interviews; 3) Drafting the EPAs based on analysis of collected data; 4) Seeking feedback on the draft EPAs from the participants and other stakeholders; 5) Refining and finalising the EPAs based on feedback. RESULTS: Two specialty-specific EPAs were developed using the five stage approach. The participants reached consensus on the specific tasks and criteria for performance for the two EPAs. They also agreed that both day-to-day (ad hoc) and formal (summative) entrustment decisions were put into practice through the intensity of supervision provided to PGY 1 doctors. As a result, a three level <b>entrustment</b> <b>and</b> <b>supervision</b> scale consisting of direct active, indirect active, passive was developed reflecting the shift in the intensity of supervision from close supervision to minimal supervision. CONCLUSIONS: The five stage approach described in this paper was used successfully to develop two specialty-specific EPAs in emergency medicine along with a three level entrustment scale. We propose that the five stage approach is transferable to a range of medical training contexts to design specialty-specific EPAs...|$|E
50|$|Negligence in {{employment}} encompasses several causes {{of action in}} tort law that arise where an employer is held liable for the tortious acts of an employee because that employer was negligent in providing the employee {{with the ability to}} engage in a particular act.

40|$|As residents, we {{constantly}} {{strive to}} independently manage our patients and develop care plans, while {{the role of}} the attending faculty varies between complete <b>supervision</b> <b>and</b> control, to allowing complete autonomy. This concept of attending physicians allowing appropriate autonomy so that residents can develop independence in their practice has been termed <b>entrustment.</b> Patients' <b>and</b> instructors' <b>entrustment</b> of responsibility reflects upon one's preparedness to assume professional responsibility after graduation. Over the past several months, we have been reflecting on our experiences working in the emergency department and how different faculty members entrust residents during each shift. Some experiences have been incredible as we develop our styles of practice, while others have been incredibly frustrating and soured the learning environment. As third‐year residents, we studied the factors that allow faculty to foster an appropriate amount of <b>entrustment</b> <b>and</b> conducted discussions with multiple residents on this topic. We have found several themes of how this can be done well and share these ideas with a goal of improving autonomy for emergency medicine residents...|$|R

The {{first part of the}} thesis situates Italian feminism in relation to the more familiar French and Anglo-American contexts in order to consider its distinctiveness. The main body of the study then considers the historical and political emergence of contemporary Italian feminism, the elaboration of a social-symbolic practice called "entrustment" ("affidamento"), beginning in 1983, and the hegemony achieved by the theory of sexual difference amongst the majority of feminist groups. Here, I develop the central argument of the thesis: it is the elaboration of entrustment which has first occasioned contemporary Italian feminism, as a whole, to engage with a theory of sexual difference adapted to the highly politicised Italian context. The last section of the thesis critically evaluates <b>entrustment</b> <b>and</b> the symbolic order of the Mother created by it, and considers the debates surrounding such a social-symbolic practice.

50|$|Negligence in {{employment}} differs from negligent entrustment in two key respects. First, negligent employment {{requires that the}} injury {{was caused by the}} actual employment of the party. By comparison, a party can be held liable for negligently entrusting something to any person, whether that person is an employee or not. Second, an employee can be found liable for negligent hiring, retention, supervision or training even without provision of any dangerous instrumentality to the employee. However, where an employer hires an unqualified person to engage in the use of a dangerous instrumentality, as in the above example with the bus driver, the employer may be liable for both negligent <b>entrustment</b> <b>and</b> negligent hiring.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose for}} doing this {{research}} was to study the law regarding negligent hiring, retention, <b>supervision,</b> <b>and</b> <b>entrustment,</b> <b>and</b> to apply the principles found to campus recreation programs. ^ The elements of an action for negligent hiring and retention are essentially the same; each requires {{the establishment of an}} employment relationship. Negligent <b>supervision</b> <b>and</b> <b>entrustment</b> are separate torts and do not require an employment relationship. All four causes of action require that the plaintiff plead and prove a duty, breach of that duty, proximate cause of the breach resulting in injury, and actual injury, elements common to all negligence actions. Courts have established minimum standards expected of employers which assist them in avoiding liability for negligent hiring and retention. Employers must generally obtain an application form, conduct an interview, and check references at the minimum. If a position entails frequent contact with the public, access to customers 2 ̆ 7 homes, working with minors or the infirm, or use of a dangerous instrumentality (vehicle, weapon, etc.), an employer is expected to do more than the minimum required. Criminal background check, previous employment verification, education background check, and other duties may be deemed essential. ^ For campus recreation administrators, this research has many implications. First, because many students are hired, each candidate should complete an application and be interviewed (telephone or personal). Those working with children or handling money should have their backgrounds checked more thoroughly. Although not common practice, professional applicants should be required to complete an application form as well. A waiver or release should be part of every application form. The waiver should permit background investigation while also providing liability protection for both the employer and the reference. ^ Administrators should recognize employment-process warning signs. Warning signs include gaps in employment history, and incomplete application information. Administrators should also recognize their potential personal liability for their employment-related decisions. ...|$|R

Secondly, To know the concept of coordination <b>and</b> <b>supervision</b> ideally in preventing and combating corruption in Indonesia.

40|$|In {{the context}} of Connexions and an {{inclusion}} agenda, practice for careers advisers (now called personal advisers) has changed. Those working intensively with the 'harder-to-help' appear to need support <b>and</b> <b>supervision.</b> For most (at practitioner, manager and the professional institute level) this is a novel practice and the meanings/perspectives on what it is, and what it can do, are not shared. The study explored these views using a qualitative approach {{with the intention of}} foregrounding differences and similarities. Following dissemination of the findings, the aim is to enhance the effectiveness of any models put into place. In exploring the formation of a discourse on support <b>and</b> <b>supervision</b> in the field of career guidance, the study evaluated the usefulness of discourse theory. Through the use of discourse theory the study also examined the need for support <b>and</b> <b>supervision.</b> Ten personal advisers, three line managers and three representatives of the professional and training body were interviewed. Analysis employed the techniques of a grounded, thematic approach that searched for the most important themes for each group. Three main themes emerged from that analysis: - the need for a structured process - managing stress and avoiding burn out - time constraints within a bigger picture of constant change. Although there were many similar views about the purpose of support <b>and</b> <b>supervision,</b> there were differences in emphasis between the groups. For personal advisers the central purpose was to 'manage stress and avoid burn out': support <b>and</b> <b>supervision</b> was viewed as offering a restorative space within, at times, a stressful work environment. While line line managers and representatives of the professional community also talked about this, their views about purpose brought to the fore other aspects. Line managers viewed monitoring of performance as a central function of support <b>and</b> <b>supervision.</b> For the professional representatives the purpose of support <b>and</b> <b>supervision</b> was to 'enhance professional development within the bigger picture of organisational change'. Both groups made use of a professional discourse that placed the needs of the client at the centre of the purpose of support <b>and</b> <b>supervision.</b> They also viewed support <b>and</b> <b>supervision</b> through a lens that must consider accountability and use of the resources of time and personnel: for line managers this was the primary focus of their talk about support <b>and</b> <b>supervision.</b> Foucault's concept of 'productive power' was used in the examination of these differences. The central story for the personal advisers was the need for a restorative space to manage stress and avoid burn out. This discourse on the purpose of support <b>and</b> <b>supervision</b> was positioned above the function of benefiting work with clients. The study concludes that this discourse needs to be heard and not silenced by other more powerful views on the purpose of support <b>and</b> <b>supervision...</b>|$|R
