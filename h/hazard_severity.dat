50|$|The {{fire danger}} in the foothills is very high. Almost all of the cities that the hills go through are cities for which CAL FIRE has made {{recommendations}} on Very High Fire <b>Hazard</b> <b>Severity</b> Zones. There {{have been a number}} of wild fires in the foothills of the San Gabriel Valley, that is part of the area's natural environment. Global warming has occurred rapidly over the course of the past half-century. In California, less precipitation will occur as snow, meaning that less water is able to be stored in the snow-pack, and that dry summers could see even less water availability. Summertime peak temperatures will increase in many places. Fire “seasons” may become even longer. The declaration of fire season in California is actually a change in preparedness levels for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. When weather patterns in an area of the state become warm and dry, and vegetation (fuels) are at a low moisture content point, Emergency response dispatch levels are typically increased, facilities are staffed 24 hours a day and additional firefighters are hired. When cooling weather, rain and snow are sufficient to reduce the fire threat, CAL FIRE then reduces its preparedness levels by releasing additional firefighters, closing some of the stations, and repositioning aircraft.|$|E
50|$|DO-178B {{alone is}} not {{intended}} to guarantee software safety aspects. Safety attributes in the design and as implemented as functionality must receive additional mandatory system safety tasks to drive and show objective evidence of meeting explicit safety requirements. Typically IEEE STD-1228-1994 Software Safety Plans are allocated and software safety analyses tasks are accomplished in sequential steps (requirements analysis, top level design analysis, detailed design analysis, code level analysis, test analysis and change analysis). These software safety tasks and artifacts are integral supporting parts of the process for <b>hazard</b> <b>severity</b> and DAL determination to be documented in system safety assessments (SSA). The certification authorities require and DO-178B specifies the correct DAL be established using these comprehensive analyses methods to establish the software level A-E. Any software that commands, controls, and monitors safety-critical functions should receive the highest DAL - Level A. It is the software safety analyses that drive the system safety assessments that determine the DAL that drives the appropriate level of rigor in DO-178B. The system safety assessments combined with methods such as SAE ARP 4754A determine the after mitigation DAL and may allow reduction of the DO-178B software level objectives to be satisfied if redundancy, design safety features and other architectural forms of hazard mitigation are in requirements driven by the safety analyses. Therefore, DO-178B central theme is design assurance and verification after the prerequisite safety requirements have been established.|$|E

30|$|Thinning without {{subsequent}} slash reduction {{has been}} shown in simulation studies to be less effective than prescribed fire in reducing potential wildland fire behavior (van Wagtendonk 1996, Stephens 1998, Agee and Skinner 2005, Stephens and Moghaddas 2005). This study indicated that thinning, without slash reduction because of the helicopter yarding method used, increased surface fire behavior and brought stands close to historic basal area levels. The slash left after logging, plus smaller trees that were not logged, were treated after the thinning with a lop and scatter method. This expensive additional cost might not occur after every thinning operation, but can aid subsequent survival of residual trees (Agee and Skinner 2005). However, addition of dead fuels from thinning or insect outbreaks (Hummel and Agee 2003), or removal by prescribed fire, does not simply translate into altered fire <b>hazard</b> or <b>severity.</b> Fuelbed depth, surface-area-to-volume ratios, and distribution of loading by size class are fuel model parameters in addition to total loading that will affect fire behavior.|$|R

40|$|Bird {{aircraft}} collisions (bird strikes) are {{a recognized}} safety hazard and land uses that attract birds hazardous to aircraft {{should be avoided}} on and near airports. Many airfields contain large areas of anthropogenic grassland habitats, often dominated by cool season grasses. Land managed as native warm season grasses (NWSG) potentially could increase bird strike hazards on and near airports by attracting hazardous birds and harboring small mammals that are prey for hazardous raptors. We investigated bird and small mammal communities at three NWSG areas and three adjacent on airfield grassland areas in western Ohio, U. S. A. to determine whether NWSG increased bird strike hazards. Species specific differences in bird abundance and density were evident between the two landcover types, presumably the result of differences in plant community characteristics. Seven species of birds were found exclusively in NWSG or airfield grasslands. Birds of species categorized as ‘moderate’ to ‘extremely high’ in regard to <b>hazard</b> (<b>severity)</b> level to aircraft accounted for only 6 % and 2 % of all birds observed in airfield grasslands and NWSG areas, respectively. Small mammal capture success was approximately three times higher in NWSG areas, although raptor abundance did not differ between the two landcover types.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} interplay between the {{operational}} and financial facets of capacity investment. We consider the capacity choice problem of a firm with limited liquidity and whose access to external capital markets is hampered by moral hazard. The firm must therefore not only calibrate its capacity investment and the corresponding funding needs, but also optimize its sourcing of funds. Importantly, the set of available sources of funds is derived endogenously and includes standard financial claims (debt, equity, etc.). We find that when higher demand realizations are more indicative of high effort, debt financing is optimal for any given capacity level. In this case, the optimal capacity is never below the efficient capacity level but sometimes strictly above that level. Further, the optimal capacity level increases with the moral <b>hazard</b> problem's <b>severity</b> and decreases with the firm's internal funds. This runs counter to the newsvendor logic and to the common intuition that by raising the cost of external capital and hence the unit capacity cost, financial market frictions should lower the optimal capacity level. We trace the value of increasing capacity beyond the efficient level to a bonus effect and a demand elicitation effect. Both stem from the risk of unmet demand, which is characteristic of capacity decisions under uncertainty...|$|R

In developing countries, mortality rates are significantly higher when compared to other countries. In Brazil, official data show 23. 4 fatalities per 100, 000 inhabitants, compared to 10. 6 in the United States and 6. 0 in Canada (Global Status Report on Road Safety, 2015). Driving requires specific motor and cognitive skills, such hazard perception. The Hazard Perception Test (HPT) assesses a drivers 2 ̆ 7 ability to identify or anticipate dangerous situations in traffic (Horswill 2 ̆ 6 McKenna, 2004) and taps into different cognitive processes, such as speed to detect the hazard, judgment of <b>hazard</b> <b>severity,</b> and decision-making. The HPT has been directly associated with the risk of collision (Darby et al, 2009; McKenna 2 ̆ 6 Horswill, 1999; Quimby et al, 1986; Wells et al, 2008). Many countries, such as Australia and Great Britain, have made hazard perception a regular component of the driving test. In Brazil, however, candidates undergo an exam that has the characteristics of a clinical screening and does not assess context-specific cognitive abilities. Thus, there is a clear demand for clinical procedures with greater diagnostic sensitivity that address fundamental abilities such as hazard perception.

40|$|A Coastal Risk Assessment Framework (CRAF) {{provides}} {{two levels}} of coastal risk and vulnerability assessment, by combining information on the spatially variable hazard and exposure. In Phase 1, areas of greatest risk or `hotspots' are identified. In Phase 2, these hotspots are then analysed in greater detail to identify both direct and indirect extreme event impacts. This approach {{was applied to the}} barrier coastline of North Norfolk, eastern England. The CRAF identified high risk coastal hotspots on the basis of both hazard impacts (swash regime (tide + surge + wave runup) and overwash/terrestrial inundation regimes) from a 1 in 115 year return period storm and a range of land use, infrastructure, economic and social vulnerability indicators. Hazard extents and <b>hazard</b> <b>severity,</b> in some locations modified by the presence of intertidal saltmarsh, were calculated for 45, 1 - 2 km wide sections along the topographically complex coast. When combined with five exposure indicators, eight hotspots were identified along the 45 km long frontage. In a 2 nd phase, two of these hotspots, one a chain of small villages (Brancaster/Brancaster Staithe/Burnham Deepdale) and one a small town (Wells-next-the-Sea), were compared in more detail using a suite of coastal inundation and impact assessment models to determine both direct and indirect impacts. Hazards at this higher resolution were calculated using the 1 D process-based XBeach model and the 2 D LISFLOOD inundation model. Vulnerability to the hazards was calculated using the INDRA (Integrated Disruption Assessment) model with comparison of the two hotspots {{through the use of a}} Multi Criteria Analysis (MCA).

40|$|A {{research}} report {{submitted to the}} Faculty of Science, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Environmental Science Johannesburg, November 2012. Acid rock drainage (ARD) and dust are potential consequences of gold and uranium mine residue deposits (MRDs) on the Witwatersrand basin. Urbanisation has taken place around mines and, with the curtailing of mining activities and clearing of land previously covered by MRDs, there is pressure to use this land for residential, industrial and agricultural purposes. However, mining companies historically {{were not required to}} provide pollution control measures and there is evidence for contamination of land and water. Thus, {{there is a need to}} prioritise contamination sources for mitigation and to understand the extent of contamination and potential risks associated with different categories of land-use on mining land. The aim of my study was to conduct a first-order risk assessment to aid in identifying vulnerable land use in the vicinity of gold and uranium mining, and prioritising MRDs, including footprints, for mitigation. To achieve this I constructed a Geographical Information System (GIS) using publicly available spatial data, and then tested the usefulness of historical aerial photographs and remote sensing imagery for mapping MRDs and impacts of MRD origin under Highveld conditions (i. e. a seasonal climate with summer rainfall and annual evapotranspiration of > 2. 5 times mean annual precipitation). The Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality (EMM; 1923 km 2) is an area of extensive historical mining with major urbanisation, while retaining areas for agricultural land use; thus it was selected as a representative study site. I used a numerical rating scheme, which combined a number of parameters in two separate stages to calculate a risk index. The first stage involved the classification of hazards associated with MRDs while the second involved an assessment of land use vulnerability based on exposure pathways and proximity. Historical aerial photographs (1938, 1964 and 2003) and the Chamber of Mines (CoM) Dump Indexes were used to identify and classify MRDs in terms of basic geotechnical properties, current status and historical failure. Multi-spectral data, acquired over two years (2002 and 2003) in two seasons (spring and summer) by the TERRA satellite’s Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) sensor, were used to compile thematic images, indicating potential contamination of surrounding land. It was intended that a zone of influence could be distinguished for each MRD enabling me to rate the <b>hazard</b> <b>severity.</b> The thematic images I selected included primary minerals (pyrophyllite and chlorite), secondary minerals (copiapite and jarosite), an indicator of uranium-bearing ore (referred to as mincrust) and the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI). These minerals were chosen as potential indicators of different transport routes of contaminants and I tested their associations with different features and land use. I also tested for seasonal differences in the detection of these minerals, and used NDVI to examine the masking effect of active vegetation. I found GIS to be well suited for combining the various forms of spatial data and providing information about MRDs, aqueous pathways, proximity to vulnerable land uses and impacted areas. However, I found that the potential severity of the hazards posed by each MRD, as indicated by a zone of influence, could not be determined from aerial photographs and ASTER alone. I therefore utilised the findings expressed in the literature survey to assign ratings for the different classes of MRDs. The vulnerability assessment was also supplemented by literature review to rate land uses based on human exposure pathways. I determined that MRDs (including footprints) cover 4. 1...|$|E

ResultsThe estimated probabilities of survival were 38. 5 % versus 30. 9 % at 18 months, 28. 0 % versus 18. 7 % at 24 months and 22. 3 % versus 12. 0 % at 30 months, for the aflibercept- and placebo-treated arms, respectively. The proportional improvement in the HR over time was consistent with the survival probability results; survival at 24 months was improved by 50 % and almost doubled at 30 months. The majority of worst-grade AEs occurred within the first four cycles of treatment and in a small percent of treatment cycles and were mostly reversible. Common chemotherapy- and anti-vascular epithelial growth factor (VEGF) -associated AEs occurred rarely and in a small proportion of cycles with the majority being of single occurrence. ConclusionsThe addition of aflibercept to FOLFIRI showed a continued and persistent improvement in overall survival over time in patients with mCRC. Although grade 3 – 4 AEs were more frequent in the aflibercept arm, they occurred in early treatment cycles and decreased sharply following initial presentation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRecent EU {{legislation}} has introduced {{endocrine disrupting properties}} as a hazard-based “cut-off” criterion for the approval of active substances as pesticides and biocides. Currently, no specific science-based approach {{for the assessment of}} substances with endocrine disrupting properties has been agreed upon, although this new legislation provides interim criteria based on classification and labelling. Different proposals for decision making on potential endocrine disrupting properties in human health risk assessment have been developed by the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) and other regulatory bodies. All these frameworks, although differing with regard to hazard characterisation, include a toxicological assessment of adversity of the effects, the evaluation of underlying modes/mechanisms of action in animals and considerations concerning the relevance of effects to humans. Three options for regulatory decision making were tested upon 39 pesticides for their applicability and to analyze their potential impact on the regulatory status of active substances that are currently approved for use in Europe: Option 1, based purely on hazard identification (adversity, mode of action, and the plausibility that both are related); Option 2, based on hazard identification and additional elements of <b>hazard</b> characterisation (<b>severity</b> and potency); Option 3, based on the interim criteria laid down in the recent EU pesticides legislation. Additionally, the data analysed in this study were used to address the questions, which parts of the endocrine system were affected, which studies were the most sensitive and whether no observed adverse effect levels were observed for substance with ED properties. The results of this exercise represent preliminary categorisations and must not be used as a basis for definitive regulatory decisions. They demonstrate that a combination of criteria for hazard identification with additional criteria of hazard characterisation allows prioritising and differentiating between substances with regard to their regulatory concern. It is proposed to integrate these elements into a decision matrix to be used within a weight of evidence approach for the toxicological categorisation of relevant endocrine disruptors and to consider all parts of the endocrine system for regulatory decision making on endocrine disruption...|$|R
50|$|Clackline Bridge is a {{historic}} road bridge in Clackline that carried the Great Eastern Highway until 2008. It is the only bridge in Western Australia to have spanned both a waterway and railway, the Clackline Brook and the former Eastern Railway alignment. The mainly timber bridge has a unique curved and sloped design, due to the difficult topography and {{the route of the}} former railway. The bridge was designed in 1934 to replace two dangerous rail crossings and a rudimentary water crossing. Construction began in January 1935, and was completed relatively quickly, with the opening ceremony held in August 1935. The bridge has undergone various improvement and maintenance works since then, including widening by 3 m in 1959-60, but remained a safety <b>hazard,</b> with increasing <b>severity</b> and numbers of accidents through the 1970s and 1980s. Planning for a highway bypass of Clackline and the Clackline Bridge began in the 1990s, and it was constructed between January 2007 and February 2008. The local community had been concerned that the historic bridge would be lost, but it remains in use as part of the local road network, and has been listed on both the Northam Municipal Heritage Inventory and the Heritage Council of Western Australia's Register of Heritage Places.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE — The goal of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} heart failure prevalence and incidence rates, subsequent mortality, and risk factors for heart failure among older populations in Medi-care with diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — We used a national 5 % sample of Medicare claims from 1994 to 1999 to perform a population-based, nonconcurrent cohort study in 151, 738 beneficiaries with diabetes who were age 65 years, not in managed care, and were alive on 1 January 1995. Prevalent heart failure was defined as a diagnosis of heart failure in 1994; incident heart failure was defined as a new diagnosis in 1995 – 1999 among those without prevalent heart failure. Mortality was assessed through 31 December 1999. RESULTS — Heart failure was prevalent in 22. 3 % in 1994. Among individuals without heart failure in 1994, the heart failure incidence rate was 12. 6 per 100 person-years (95 % CI 12. 5 – 12. 7 per 100 person-years). Incidence was similar by sex and race and increased significantly with age and diabetes-related comorbidities. The adjusted hazard of incident heart failure in-creased for individuals with the following: metabolic complications of diabetes (a proxy for poor control and/or <b>severity)</b> (<b>hazards</b> ratio 1. 23, 95 % CI 1. 18 – 1. 29), ischemic heart disease (1. 74...|$|R
40|$|How {{does one}} {{identify}} and then prioritize relatively minor improvements and modifications {{which might be}} made with limited funding {{for the sake of}} safety and accident reduction on the Interstate Highway System in Kentucky? First, one must know how to identify places or situations which a~e more hazardous than-others. Second, one must know how to rank <b>hazards</b> according to <b>severity</b> and the potential effectiveness of corrective measures. One must know what is normal in terms of accident statistics in order to identify what is abnormal when scanning accident data files. Indeed, one must have criteria and guidelines to follow. The report submitted herewith brings known factors together in order and organization which will be the basis for a manual of step-by-step procedures. The program will evolve therefrom. Provisions for updating will emerge in the form of refined criteria and statistics and from possible, further availability of designated funds. It is planned to extend the guidelines and criteria to cover similar application to the remaining systems of highways in the state. The report at hand was reviewed by the Project Advisory Committee on December 7; only editorial changes have been made. The membership of the Committee in addition to Research people is: F. R...|$|R
