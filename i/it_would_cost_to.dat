5|$|Ultimately, {{the ship}} was {{canceled}} on 11 August 1945, {{when she was about}} 22% complete. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 12 August 1945. Her incomplete hulk initially was retained on the belief that it {{could be used as a}} target in nuclear weapons tests. However, the some $30million <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>cost</b> <b>to</b> complete the ship enough to be able to launch her proved too great and the plan was abandoned. She remained in the dockyard until September 1958, when she was broken up on the builder's ways.|$|E
5|$|In May 1972, Nutting Associates chief {{engineer}} Nolan Bushnell, {{designer of the}} first commercial arcade video game, Computer Space, saw {{a demonstration of the}} Odyssey at a dealership. Inspired, when he quit Nutting to start his own company, Atari, he assigned Allan Alcorn to create a cheap ping pong arcade game as a training exercise, though he did not tell Alcorn that it was for training nor that the idea was based on the Odyssey Table Tennis game. Alcorn soon developed Pong, which Bushnell recognized as a potential hit, and it became the company's first game. Pong was very successful, and in turn helped drive sales of the Odyssey; Baer once noted that customers bought the console because of Table Tennis, in turn because of Pong, and joked that they may as well have stopped designing games after that game card. In 1974, however, Magnavox sued Atari along with several competitors including Nutting, Allied Leisure, Bally Midway, and Williams Electronics for infringing on Baer's patents for video games played on a television screen. Baer has stated that the lawsuits were not filed right away because Magnavox and Sanders needed to wait until they could expect to be awarded more money than <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>cost</b> <b>to</b> pursue the suits. The root of the conflict was a pair of patents by Baer—one which described how the Odyssey showed player-controlled objects, or dots, on a video monitor and described a number of games that could be played with the system, and an earlier one that went into detail about how the Odyssey used that system to have two dots collide with each other and have one bounce off, specifically using a game of ping pong as an example.|$|E

25|$|The sculptor, Giuseppe Moretti {{received}} an artist's fee of $6,000, {{which would be}} about $90,000 in today's currency. The Commercial Club of Birmingham held art shows, concerts, baseball games, and many more activities to raise the estimated $15,000 ($225,000 in today's currency) <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>cost</b> <b>to</b> build and transport the statue.

25|$|Pat Johnson {{remained}} {{convinced of}} the validity of the idea, and had Whittle patent the idea in January 1930. Since the RAF was not interested in the concept they did not declare it secret, meaning that Whittle was able to retain the rights to the idea, which would have otherwise been their property. Johnson arranged a meeting with British Thomson-Houston (BTH), whose chief turbine engineer seemed to agree with the basic idea. However, BTH did not want to spend the ₤60,000 <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>cost</b> <b>to</b> develop it, and this potential brush with early success went no further.|$|E

25|$|In May 2012, Celtic {{were rated}} 37th in Brand Finance's annual {{valuation}} of the world's biggest football clubs. Celtic's brand was valued at $64million (£40.7million), $15million {{more than the}} previous year. It {{was the first time}} a Scottish club had been ranked in the top 50. Matt Hannagan, Sports Brand Valuation Analyst at Brand Finance, said that Celtic were constrained by the amount of money they got from the SPL and that if they were in the Premiership then, due to their large fan base, they could be in the top 10 clubs in the world. Later that month David Low, the financial consultant who advised Fergus McCann on his takeover of Celtic in 1994, said that Celtic's 'enterprise value' (how much <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>cost</b> <b>to</b> buy the club) was £52million.|$|E
25|$|The {{second meeting}} in New York was {{attended}} by Levine, Bellanca, and Chamberlin. With check in hand, Levine added a stipulation that Columbia Aircraft would select the crew on the flight, which Lindbergh objected to. Reminding Lindbergh that the WB-2 was the only plane that could make the flight at the time, they made him leave and call {{back the next day}} to reconsider. The terms did not change, and Lindbergh returned to St. Louis without an airplane. Lindbergh then approached Travel Air Manufacturing Company, asking for a Travel Air 5000 modified with a Wright Whirlwind motor and was declined. Lindbergh also inquired what <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>cost</b> <b>to</b> buy a Fokker for the attempt; he was given a quote of $100,000 for a custom trimotor, and was told that Fokker would not build a single-engine craft for a transatlantic flight. Lindbergh instead purchased a single-place aircraft from Ryan aircraft, the Spirit of St. Louis, for $6000.|$|E

25|$|Amtrak {{has argued}} {{that it needs to}} {{increase}} capital program costs in 2013 in order to replace old train equipment because the multi-year maintenance costs for those trains exceeds what <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>cost</b> <b>to</b> simply buy new equipment that would not need to be repaired for several years. However, despite an initial request for more than $2.1 billion in funding for the year, the company had to deal with a year-over-year cut in 2013 federal appropriations, dropping to under $1.4 billion {{for the first time in}} several years. Amtrak stated in 2010 that the backlog of needed repairs of the track it owns on the Northeast Corridor included over 200 bridges, most dating to the 19th century, tunnels under Baltimore dating to the American Civil War Era and functionally obsolete track switches which would cost $5.2 billion to repair (more than triple Amtrak's total annual budget). Amtrak's budget is only allocated on a yearly basis, and it has been argued by Joseph Vranich that this makes multi-year development programs and long-term fiscal planning difficult if not impossible.|$|E
500|$|The {{replacement}} cost method {{also has its}} critics. What types of jobs should be used as substitutes? For example, should childcare activities [...] "be calculated using the wages of daycare workers or child psychiatrists?" [...] This relates {{to the problem of}} depressed wages in female-dominated industries, and whether using such jobs as an equivalent leads to the undervaluing of unpaid work. [...] Some have argued that education levels ought to be comparable, for example, [...] "the value of time that a college-educated parent spends reading aloud to a child should be ascertained by asking how much <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>cost</b> <b>to</b> hire a college-educated worker to do the same, not by an average housekeeper's wage." ...|$|E
