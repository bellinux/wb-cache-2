5|$|In {{the opening}} scene in which Michael puts his face in cement, the wet cement that was used was {{actually}} putty. The crew was planning to do only one take of Steve Carell putting {{his face in the}} putty, so he was instructed to hold his breath as long as he possibly could. But the crew <b>forgot</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the other actors about that, so during the filming of the scene, the actors thought he was actually stuck and there was a rush to pull him out. Kim M. Ferry, owner of the Nissan Xterra featured in the episode, is the show's Department Head Hairstylist. After it was used on the show, she decided to sell it on eBay. The listing was first put up on eBay on May 1, 2008, the night the episode aired.|$|E
500|$|In 1915, during World War I, Butlin volunteered {{somewhat}} reluctantly {{for service}} in the Canadian Army. Knowing that the army already had a full quota of despatch riders, Butlin intended to volunteer for service in that category {{in the knowledge that}} although his application would be declined he would still receive an [...] "I volunteered" [...] badge for his actions without actually having to serve. While applying, Butlin <b>forgot</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the recruiter of this intention, and was consequently allocated to the Canadian Expeditionary Force which was taking part in the fighting along the Western Front. He was subsequently posted to the 170th (Mississauga Horse) Battalion on 29 December 1915. His attestation papers give his date of birth as 1898 (rather than the actual 1899), allowing him to enlist although only 15 at the time. The papers give his occupation as a [...] "Suit Case Maker". The papers also show, as Butlin himself later stated, that he had been selected to serve as a bugler. Before his deployment to Europe, Butlin transferred to the 216th (Bantams) Battalion, with which he was sent to England. Once in England, he was stationed at Sandgate near Folkestone before being deployed to France. In France, the 216th became part of the 3rd Canadian Division which took part in the second battle of Vimy Ridge, as well the battles at Ypres and Arras, and the second battle of Cambrai; while in France, Butlin served as a stretcher-bearer.|$|E
2500|$|The phrase [...] "chuffed to one's bollocks" [...] {{describes}} {{someone who}} is very pleased with himself. [...] Nobel laureate Harold Pinter used this in The Homecoming The phrase provided a serious challenge to translators of his work. Pinter used a similar phrase in an open letter, published in The Guardian, and addressed to Prime Minister Tony Blair, attacking his co-operation with American foreign policy. The letter ends by saying [...] "Oh, by the way, meant to mention, <b>forgot</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you, we were all chuffed to the bollocks when Labour won the election".|$|E

2500|$|Wolfe {{supported}} George W.

[...] (Bush apparently reciprocates the admiration, and is said to have read all of Wolfe's books, according to friends in 2005). [...] ) After his support of Bush was publicized in a New York Times interview, Wolfe said that the reaction in the literary world {{was as if he had}} said, [...] "I <b>forgot</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you—I'm a child molester." [...] Because of this incident, he sometimes wears an American flag pin on his suit, which he compared to [...] "holding up a cross to werewolves." ...|$|E

Lanrezac, sure that Joffre was utterly adrift from facts, watched with insolent distrust the impending disaster. But even he never imagined the weight and sweep of the German enveloping wing. The two armies of the left only escaped disaster by the timely retreat which Lanrezac and Sir John French each executed independently and on his own initiative ...

2500|$|Reading {{the words}} [...] "and it bred worms and rotted" [...] in [...] a Midrash asked whether {{anything}} exists that first produces worms and then rots (implying that surely, rot precedes worms). Answering in the negative, the Midrash taught that God wished to reveal to people the deeds {{of those who}} disobeyed and saved the manna, so God caused many worms to breed during that night so that the sinners should {{not be able to}} smell the staleness of the manna in the evening and throw it out. The Midrash told that Moses became so angry with them that he <b>forgot</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> them to gather two omers for each person on the sixth day. So when they went out and gathered on the sixth day and found a double portion, the princes told Moses, as [...] reports, [...] "And all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses." [...] The Midrash noted that Moses told them (in [...] ), [...] "This is that which the Lord has spoken," [...] not [...] "which I have spoken," [...] because Moses had forgotten. For this reason, the Midrash taught, in [...] God asked, [...] "How long will you refuse to keep My commandments and My laws?" [...] including Moses among them (as Moses should not have given vent to his anger, thereby forgetting God’s command).|$|E
2500|$|Wu Sansi {{was killed}} in 707 in an {{unsuccessful}} coup by Emperor Zhongzong's crown prince Li Chongjun, and Cui Shi soon became closely associated with Emperor Zhongzong's powerful concubine Consort Shangguan Wan'er; traditional historians generally believed that they had an affair. [...] In 708, he became the deputy minister of defense (兵部侍郎, Bingbu Shilang). [...] (HIs father Cui Yi was then serving as the deputy minister of rites, and having father and son both serve as deputy ministers {{of one of the}} six departments of the executive bureau (尚書省, Shangshu Sheng) was unprecedented at that time.) [...] In 709, at her recommendation, by which time Cui was Zhongshu Shilang (中書侍郎), the deputy head of the legislative bureau, Cui was given the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (同中書門下平章事), making him a chancellor de facto. [...] He and fellow chancellor Zheng Yin were also made acting deputy ministers of civil service affairs (吏部侍郎, Libu Shilang), making them in charge of selecting officials, and it was said that both he and Zheng violated civil service regulations, accepted bribes, and promoted inappropriate persons. [...] Further, his father Cui Yi was also accepting bribes and trying to influence Cui Shi, and when Cui Shi refused to follow Cui Yi's requests, the father-son relationship became a difficult one. [...] (On one occasion, Cui Yi accepted a bribe from a reserve official hoping for a commission but <b>forgot</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> Cui Shi about it, and Cui Shi did not grant that reserve official a commission. [...] That reserve official went to see Cui Shi and asked him, [...] "Your relative accepted my bribe. [...] Why did I not get a commission?" [...] Cui Shi angrily responded, [...] "Who accepted the bribe? [...] I will cane him to death!" [...] The reserve official responded, [...] "Do not do that! [...] If you do that, you will have to observe a period of mourning." [...] Cui realized that it was his father and became ashamed.) [...] Later in 709, after indictment by the censors Jin Heng (靳恆) and Li Shangyin and investigation by the censor Pei Cui (裴漼), Cui and Zheng were removed from their offices. [...] Cui was initially supposed to demoted to be the military advisor to the prefect of Jiang Prefecture (江州, roughly modern Jiujiang, Jiangxi), while Zheng was to be exiled to Ji Prefecture (吉州, roughly modern Ji'an, Jiangxi). [...] After intercession by Consort Shangguan, as well as Emperor Zhongzong's daughter Li Guo'er the Princess Anle and Li Guo'er's husband Wu Yanxiu (武延秀), Cui was instead made the prefect of Xiang Prefecture (襄州, roughly modern Xiangfan, Hubei), and Zheng was made the military advisor to the prefect of Jiang Prefecture. [...] However, later in the year, when Emperor Zhongzong was set to make sacrifices to heaven and earth south of Chang'an, he recalled both Cui and Zheng to attend to him during the ceremony, and Cui was soon made Shangshu Zuo Cheng (尚書左丞), one of the secretaries general of the executive bureau. [...] Sometime during these years, Cui also suggested that a new canal should be built between Lantian (藍田, near Chang'an) and Shang Prefecture (商州, roughly modern Shangluo, Shaanxi), and Emperor Zhongzong agreed, putting Cui in charge of the project. [...] The canal was built with some tens of thousands of conscripted laborers, and somewhere between 13 and 15 laborers died during the project. [...] Cui would eventually be recognized for the project when the older canal that the new canal replaced became unnavigable after a serious summer storm.|$|E
