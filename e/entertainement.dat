40|$|This paper explores {{efforts to}} reach the online {{customer}} in online entertainment. It does so {{on the basis of}} an interpretive case study conducted at the Swedish computer game developer Daydream Software, where the the specific objects of study were the customer reach efforts involved in the release of the game developer´s new on-line game Clusterball. The Clusterball case illustrates a radical change effort in that it represents a break with the common method to distribute a computer game. Basically, it also represents a break with the conventional wisdom of competitive strategy in that it combines a mass-market strategy with a differentiation one. We explore how the unfolding process of customer reach was deeply influenced by the intertwined nature of information technology and business processes. In addition, we suggest how understanding these intertwinings would add to both the practice of online <b>entertainement</b> business and the body of competitive strategy knowledge. 1...|$|E

Castleman concentrates on those techniques that have proven most useful in practice. Part I presents several important concepts that can be developed without detailed mathematical analysis for a basic understanding. Part II addresses techniques that rely more on mathematics and eaborates analytically on certain concepts introduced in Part I.
