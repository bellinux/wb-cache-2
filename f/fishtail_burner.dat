50|$|There {{were six}} types of burners but four burners were really experimented with. The first burner used with this system was the single-jet burner that {{produced}} a small flame. The tip of the burner was made out of lead which absorbed heat causing the flame to be smaller in size. It was discovered that the flame would burn brighter if straight metal was mixed with other components, such as porcelain. Flat burners were invented mainly to evenly distribute gas and light to the systems. The <b>fishtail</b> <b>burner</b> is a relative to the flat burner but it managed to create a brighter flame and conducted less heat. The last burner that was experimented with was the Welsbach burner. Around this time the Bunsen burner was in use along with some forms of electricity. The Welsbach {{was based on the}} idea of the Bunsen burner, still using gas, a cotton mesh with cerium and thorium was imbedded into the Welsbach. This source of light was named the “gas mantle” which created three times more light than the naked flame.|$|E
