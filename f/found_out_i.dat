500|$|The team's uniform did {{not change}} {{significantly}} after Nike became the NFL's jersey supplier in 2012, but the collar was altered to honor former Panthers player and coach Sam Mills by featuring the phrase [...] "Keep Pounding". Nike had conceived the idea, and the team supported the concept {{as a way to}} expose newer fans to the legacy of Mills, who died of cancer in 2005. Mills had introduced the phrase, which has since become a team slogan, in a speech that he gave to the players and coaches prior to their 2003 playoff game against Dallas; in the speech, Mills compared his fight against cancer with the team's on-field battle, saying [...] "When I <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>I</b> had cancer, there were two things I could do – quit or keep pounding. I'm a fighter. I kept pounding. You're fighters, too. Keep pounding!" ...|$|E

Fox projected the release date for July 2001, while Broyles sent the studio an outline and a chronicle of the fictional planet [...] "Aschlar". Entitled The Visitor and billed as [...] "episode one in the Chronicles of Aschlar", Broyles' script {{caught the attention of}} director Tim Burton, who was hired in February 2000. [...] "I wasn't interested in doing a remake or a sequel of the original Planet of the Apes film," [...] Burton said later. [...] "But I was intrigued by the idea of revisiting that world. Like a lot of people, I was affected by the original film. I wanted to do a 're-imagining'." [...] Richard D. Zanuck signed on as producer in March. [...] "This is a very emotional film for me. I greenlighted the original Apes when I was the head of Fox in 1967." ...|$|E

500|$|Warner Bros. Records premiered {{the final}} mix of [...] "Ghost" [...] for {{streaming}} on December 10, 2013, {{and the song}} became available in digital stores by January 31, 2014. A remix by house producer Claude VonStroke was released on February 18, 2014 by Spin magazine, which journalist Chris Martins named a [...] "demented dance-floor delight." [...] A day later, Vice Media's channel Noisey released a remix by New York City-based duo Solidisco, advertised to [...] "make you nostalgic for the long weekend just gone (thanks President's Day!), but super happy because Friday {{is just a little}} bit closer than it should be." [...] Both re-workings were part of the song's remix EP that also featured remixes from Fred Falke, Thomas Newson and Viceroy. A re-cut by producer Martignetti that was not on the EP premiered on the blog Stoney Roads, who noted the song to be fitting in an episode of the HBO series Girls. [...] "Ghost" [...] was also included on the soundtrack for the game WWE 2K15, and Dubuc has admitted to being happy of being involved with the game: [...] "I've been a really big fan for a long time, and they <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>I</b> was a fan, {{and it turns out that}} some of the people that work at WWE and in the game specifically are fans of Mystery Skulls and they were like, [...] "What the fuck?

500|$|... "'97 Bonnie & Clyde", {{which was}} {{formerly}} {{featured on the}} Slim Shady EP as [...] "Just the Two of Us", was rerecorded for The Slim Shady LP to feature his daughter Hailie's vocals. Because the song focuses on disposing of his girlfriend's corpse, Eminem was not comfortable with explaining the situation to Kim, and instead {{told her that he}} would be taking Hailie to Chuck E. Cheese's. However, he really took her to the recording studio. He explained, [...] "When she <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>I</b> used our daughter to write a song about killing her, she fucking blew. We had just got back together for a couple of weeks. Then I played her the song and she bugged the fuck out." [...] Eminem also said, [...] "When she (Hailie) gets old enough, I'm going to explain it to her. I'll let her know that Mommy and Daddy weren't getting along at the time. None of it was to be taken too literally, although at the time I wanted to fucking do it." [...] The song [...] "Guilty Conscience" [...] contains a humorous reference to an occasion in which Dr. Dre assaulted rapper Dee Barnes. [...] Having only known Dr. Dre for a few days, Eminem was anxious about how he would react to such a line, and to his relief, Dr. Dre [...] "fell out of his chair laughing" [...] upon hearing the lyric. [...] "Ken Kaniff", a skit involving a prank call to Eminem, featured fellow Detroit rapper Aristotle. [...] After a falling out between the two in the wake of Eminem's breakthrough success, Eminem instead played Ken Kaniff on skits on future albums.|$|E

[...] Ennis was recalled as friendly and outgoing, and he would greet people with, [...] "Hello, friend," [...] a greeting that became his legacy. His parents had the phrase put on a sign near his grave, and several months after his death, his father released a jazz collection titled, Hello, Friend: To Ennis With Love.|$|E

[...] It struck me when I <b>found</b> <b>out.</b> <b>I</b> was at breakfast and reading the Russian newspapers and all of a sudden, it popped up.

2500|$|In {{light of}} Wilson's {{increasingly}} fragile mental state, the group tensions, and his signing to Warner Bros., Parks's involvement in Smile effectively ceased on April 14, 1967, {{when he left}} to begin work on his solo career. Giving his reasons, he said, [...] "I {{walked away from the}} situation as soon as I realized that I was causing friction between him and his other group members, and I didn't want to be the person to do that. I thought that was Brian's responsibility to bring definition to his own life. I stepped in, perhaps, I 'took a leap before I looked'. I don't know, but that's the way I feel about it.…As soon as I <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>I</b> was entering an eat or be eaten situation... I was raised differently.

2500|$|Shane Richie {{revealed}} that viewers dislike seeing Kat and Alfie happy. Speaking to Inside Soap Richie commented: [...] "People don't {{like it when}} Kat and Alfie are really happy. I never used to believe that, but I do this time around. The way that Jessie and I {{like to think of}} it is that there's the curtain in the Queen Vic that separates the bar from their home – until you go behind it, you'd never have any idea there were problems. The bar is Kat and Alfie's public stage." [...] With the possibility that Alfie could be the father of Tommy, Richie added: [...] "As soon as I <b>found</b> <b>out,</b> <b>I</b> thought, 'If Alfie isn't infertile, then surely Tommy could be his son'. Jessie and I spoke about the dates of when Alfie was in prison, and when he saw Kat before she had the fling with Michael. The writers reckon they don't match up, but we think they do. Jessie is quite adamant about it!" ...|$|E

In his first statement Paterson said; [...] "I sighted my rifle at Ryan and was about to fire when a woman walked into the line of fire and I lifted my rifle." [...] In his second statement Paterson said; [...] "I took aim at Ryan but two prison officers were in the line of fire so I dropped my rifle again."
