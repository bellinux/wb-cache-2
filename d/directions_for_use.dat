Vitamin C in doses higher than 1 g increases oxalate and urate excretion and may cause kidney stones. Third, the safety of this herbal extraction combination has not been established. And with herbs and dietary supplements in general, we only have the manufacturers’ word on the label for what’s in them.|$|E

50|$|The red seal, which {{bore the}} family crest and which {{appeared}} on all products, {{was a sign}} of quality and authenticity. Each delivery was also accompanied by a signed document on which the <b>directions</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> were printed. According to the document, eau de Cologne was not exclusively intended for exterior use. It was described as good for dental hygiene, efficient against bad breath and a way of avoiding infectious diseases. In August 1785, a certain Mrs Duplessis from Nogent enquired whether eau de Cologne could in any way help her paralysed husband. In his response, Johann Maria Farina (III) suggested she dampen some pieces of cloth in the perfume before applying them to her husband's aching limbs and recommended she add 50 drops of eau de Cologne to his weekly drinking water. The letter ended as follows: “At least you run no risk of harming him in any way”. However, the healing properties were removed from the instruction leaflet in 1811 and used only in advertisements. In 1803, the signature that had featured on the information leaflet was replaced by a stamp, which then made it possible to enclose a leaflet with each individual bottle.|$|E
50|$|Though {{physicians}} may {{prescribe drugs}} for off-label usage known as off-label marketing, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prohibits drug manufacturers from marketing or promoting a drug for a use that the FDA has not approved. A manufacturer illegally “misbrands” a drug if the drug’s labeling includes information about its unapproved uses. A drug is deemed misbranded unless its labeling bears adequate <b>directions</b> <b>for</b> <b>use.</b> The courts have {{agreed with the}} FDA that the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) requires information not only on how a product {{is to be used}} (e.g., dosage and administration), but also on all the intended uses of the product. In 2004, whistleblower David Franklin prevailed in a suit under the False Claims Act against Warner-Lambert, resulting in a $430 million settlement in the Franklin v. Parke-Davis case. It was the first off-label promotion case successfully brought under the False Claims Act in U.S. history. Oral statements and materials presented at industry-support scientific and educational activities may provide evidence of a product’s intended use. If these statements or materials promote a use that is inconsistent with the product’s approved labeling, the product is misbranded under the FDCA for failure to bear labeling with adequate directions for all intended uses.|$|E

5000|$|The Three Steles (or Tablets) of Seth are in essence, three hymns {{written in}} adoration {{for the more}} {{abstract}} being, Barbelo, {{from the perspective of}} the archetype of Seth (“Emmakha Seth”) and his father Adam (or “Geradamas”)1. The Steles themselves were allegedly written by Emmakha Seth, a spiritual archetype of Seth, the son of Adam and Eve and founder of the gnostic race (Immovable race, Seed of Seth), and thus are considered pseudepigraphic. The famous historian of first century, Josephus mentions in his Antiquities 1, a story where Seth, Son of Adam, leaves some stone tablets inscribed with esoteric information for his future offspring high in the mountains. A very similar story is repeated in The Egyptian Gospel, and again in The Revelation of Adam. The Three Steles of Seth then, may possibly be an attempt of some unknown author to honor or verify this tradition. Whatever their author and origin might be, the originals no longer exist. The existing copy in the Cairo Coptic Museum was translated from Greek to Coptic sometimes before A.D. 352. [...] The hymns themselves presuppose familiarity with the generally accepted Sethian Gnostic mythical structure as presented in Zostrianos and The Apocyphon of John. The Steles contain a total of seven hymns followed by <b>directions</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> of the hymns. The first Stele begins with a report of Dositheus explaining how he saw the tablets in a vision he had. It continues on to introduce the first hymn.|$|E
