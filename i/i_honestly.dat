I also believe that we weren't emotionally mature enough to be close friends with a gay person at that point in our lives... And Bill was and is a very proud and righteous gay person, very open about his homosexuality.|$|E

25|$|The First Test was, <b>I</b> <b>honestly</b> think, the dullest {{and most}} {{depressing}} I have ever watched...Even at this range of time one finds the gorge rising at the recollection {{of a piece}} of cricket for which there was no tactical or technical justification whatever. Did England think the pitch was going to go? Did they hope to bat out a draw? The answer is that the pitch at the end was perfect, and Australia's eight wicket win was gained with a day and a bit to spare.|$|E

25|$|Speaking {{before the}} opening of the Ordinary Synod of Bishops on the Family in October 2015, McAleese {{ridiculed}} the concept of 300 elderly celibates coming together to discuss family questions. Addressing a meeting of the Global Network of Rainbow (LGBT) Catholics {{on the eve of the}} Vatican’s Synod on the Family, former president McAleese said: “In the days when I was president, we had workshops on various issues and if I wanted to look at an issue, I would consult the experts... But look at the Synod, I have to ask the question: If I wanted expertise on the family, <b>I</b> <b>honestly</b> cannot say that the first thing that would come into my mind would be to call together 300 celibate males who, as far we know, have never raised a child...“Let me repeat a question I asked last year when I saw the Vatican’s lengthy pre-Synod questionnaire, namely how many of these men have ever changed a child’s nappy? For me that is a very important question because it is one thing to say that we all grew up in families, we had mothers, we had fathers but it is a very different thing to raise a gay child, a very different thing to live daily in a relationship and to police the relationships between children and the world.” Acknowledging that the Synod will doubtless be considering the Catholic Church's pastoral approach to homosexuals, McAleese described herself as “cynical” about the outcome of the forthcoming three week consultation.|$|E

500|$|Charles B. Harris sees Jake's and Joe's intellectualism as a Freudian obsessional neurosis. [...] To Freud, he writes, {{the source}} of such a {{condition}} lies in [...] "the chronic existence of love and hatred, both directed towards the same person and both of the highest degree of intensity". [...] Rennie expresses this overtly when she tells Jake, [...] "f I love you at all, I don't just love you.

500|$|The song {{begins with}} Knowles singing: [...] "I feel weak / We've {{been here before}} / 'Cause I feel we keep {{going back and forth}} / Maybe it's over, maybe we're through / But <b>I</b> <b>honestly</b> can say I still love you." [...] The {{introduction}} is skeletal as it contains only atmospheric synthesizers and insistent drum tapping, which have been further described as [...] "warbly [...] lighthearted". Throughout the song, the swaths of reverb occasionally pierce through the production. In the pre-chorus lines, Knowles sings: [...] "Maybe it's over, maybe we're through, but <b>I</b> <b>honestly</b> can say I still love you / Maybe we reached a mountain peak and there’s no more left to climb / and maybe we lost a magic piece and we're too blind to find" [...] while her vocals are followed by background sounds. The beat steadily grows from the verses to the bridge and, finally, to the chorus, with pounding drums coming into the loop during the refrain as Knowles sings: [...] "Let’s start over / Let's give love their wings / Let’s start over / Stop fighting bout the same old thing". As she belts the high notes and the drum beats continue to catch up, she urges her man to [...] "give love another life". During the bridge, Knowles sings: [...] "I know I called you selfish / But that’s a lie", over a simple piano line.|$|E
500|$|Doody and Kirshen {{describe}} {{the show as}} [...] "writing-heavy". Doody {{said in an interview}} with the British Comedy Guide: [...] "Compared to most radio shows, it's incredibly dense, material-wise, and very fast-moving. I think Matt and I would like some of it to be even faster, but sometimes people who've heard the pilot say things like, [...] "It's almost too much." [...] I really like that. I like that it's something you kind of need to hear twice to catch everything. When we got the series, <b>I</b> <b>honestly</b> didn't know where we'd come up with the material of the quality we were determined to keep up." ...|$|E

500|$|In November 2008, during St. John's {{portrayal}} of the character, Todd is given a new scar by John McBain during a physical altercation in which John beats Todd with a gun. The scar symbolized Todd's [...] "second rape of Marty", and was considered [...] "a poetic nod" [...] to Todd's history. The scar was significantly smaller than the original but placed in the same spot; it was gone by January 2009. St. John stated, [...] "I know. It's too bad. <b>I</b> <b>honestly</b> {{have no idea why}} they wouldn't keep that reminder on Todd's face. It might be an economical thing. You know it costs to apply that kind of makeup each day." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I'm Amazed" [...] {{begins with}} Deal recounting {{a story in}} which one of her former {{teachers}} who was [...] "into field hockey players" [...] was discreetly fired. Francis finishes Deal's sentences, joking that her response to hearing of the teacher's activities {{was to try to}} join the team. Albini later observed the use of studio banter on Surfer Rosa: [...] "It's on their record forever so I think now they are obliged to say that they're ok with it, but <b>I</b> <b>honestly</b> don't know that that idea would've ever come up if I hadn't done it. There are times when things like that are revealing and entertaining and I kind of felt it was a bit gimmicky on this record." ...|$|E
500|$|She survived {{this first}} suicide attempt after lying unfound in a crawl space for three days, later writing that she [...] "blissfully {{succumbed to the}} {{whirling}} blackness that <b>I</b> <b>honestly</b> believed was eternal oblivion." [...] She spent {{the next six months}} in psychiatric care, receiving more electric and insulin shock treatment under the care of Dr. Ruth Beuscher. Her stay at McLean Hospital and her Smith Scholarship were paid for by Olive Higgins Prouty, who had successfully recovered from a mental breakdown herself. Plath seemed to make a good recovery and returned to college. In January 1955, she submitted her thesis, The Magic Mirror: A Study of the Double in Two of Dostoyevsky's Novels, and in June graduated from Smith with highest honors.|$|E

500|$|Additionally {{producers}} {{worked with}} BBC Introducing to give unsigned bands and musicians {{the chance to}} have their music used on the series 2 soundtrack, and grime music producer Aiden [...] "S.K.I.T.Z Beatz" [...] Hogarth was appointed music director and composer, having been unable to take the role for series 1. He said [...] "For E20 I will be providing all the best and what's current from the underground and mainstream music scene and instead of having the music playing out of stereos and stalls, we've taken the step to compose and source music as a soundtrack. Something seasoned EastEnders fans may not be familiar with. <b>I</b> <b>honestly</b> think that the viewers are ready for a refreshing and brand new take on how music direction for this show {{and others like it}} should be done." ...|$|E
500|$|Bosnian media, {{political}} parties and Srebrenica survivors were likewise strongly critical. The Sarajevo-based newspaper Dnevni Avaz described the report as {{an attempt by the}} Bosnian Serb government to deny that genocide had taken place. The Srebrenica and Zepa Mothers Association condemned the report as [...] "false, [...] shameful and utterly amoral." [...] The Party for Bosnia and Herzegovina denounced it as [...] "yet another attempt by the Serb Republic authorities in an unscrupulous and brutal way to negate what probably is the worst crime in Europe after WW2." [...] Alija Behmen, the Prime Minister of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, called it [...] "a surprising forgery which is trying to delude the public and especially the Serbs in BiH. <b>I</b> <b>honestly</b> believe that this is the last attempt to enliven the policy which marked the tragic past of BiH. Negating the genocide cannot {{be a part of the}} election campaign." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Rahman, [...] "Jai Ho" [...] {{was meant}} to create [...] "a vision {{of the whole world}} celebrating this victory". The song {{contains}} a mix of [...] "multiple motifs from the traditional pieces on the soundtrack" [...] with [...] "the big drums and blasting horns of the present". It was originally composed and shortlisted for Subhash Ghai's 2008 film Yuvvraaj. Although Rahman was excited about the song, Ghai [...] "wasn't too kicked about it". Ghai felt it was [...] "too subtle and soft to be picturized on the character played by Zayed Khan". Rahman and Gulzar believed the song had [...] "immense potential" [...] and used it in Slumdog Millionaire. Following the song's win at the Oscar's, Rahman stated that: [...] "He [...] said the words had a positive feel. It was like a prayer. <b>I</b> <b>honestly</b> didn't think the song would win me an Oscar though. But like the film Slumdog suggests, everything has its own destiny".|$|E

500|$|During {{his first}} term at Arnold House Waugh found few {{opportunities}} to continue his writing. He was tired {{by the end of}} the day, his interest in The Temple flagged, and from time to time his attention wandered to other subjects; he contemplated a book on Silenus, but he admitted that it [...] "may or may not ... be written". After the Easter holidays he felt more positively about The Temple: [...] "I am making the first chapter a cinema film, and have been writing furiously ever since. <b>I</b> <b>honestly</b> think that it is going to be rather good". He sometimes worked on the book during classes, telling any boys who dared to ask what he was doing that he was writing a history of the Eskimos. By June he felt confident enough to send the first few chapters to his Oxford friend Harold Acton, [...] "asking for criticism and hoping for praise". Earlier that year Waugh had commented warmly on Acton's book of poems, An Indian Ass, [...] "which brought back memories of a life [...] infinitely remote".|$|E
500|$|IGN writer Roth Cornet {{awarded the}} episode a 6.9, {{denoting}} a [...] "okay" [...] episode. She called the episode [...] "the real {{beginning of the}} end". Cornet, however, was critical of the episode's length, specifically pin-pointing the Philadelphia scenes, noting that they [...] "went on too long". She concluded that [...] "I feel for the writers, who <b>I</b> <b>honestly</b> believe were forced to stretch their content this season", {{as well as for}} the episode. Nick Campbell of TV.com was unhappy that the episode did not show or comment on Pam and Jim's fight in the previous episode. He felt that the beginning of the dinner scene was nice, due to the two's banter. However, he felt that the end pretended as if they had not discussed the move in any previous episodes. Campbell felt that Odenkirk was used in a good way, but that was [...] "a waste of amazing talent at the real estate office". He also felt that Dwight and Angela's kiss was a good progression for their story.|$|E
500|$|The board report stated that, [...] "There is no {{indication}} that the AWACS Senior Director (Wang), the Mission Crew Commander (Tracy) and/or the DUKE (Martin) made any radio calls throughout the intercept, or that they issued any guidance to either the AWACS crew or the F-15 pilots." [...] Although the OPC ROE did task the AWACS with controlling and monitoring helicopter operations in the TAOR, the board found that the AWACS crew believed that they had no responsibility for controlling U.S. Army Black Hawks or ensuring that other coalition aircraft were aware of Black Hawks operating in the TAOR. When questioned by board investigators as to who was responsible for tracking the helicopters, Tracy said, [...] "I cannot tell you that. <b>I</b> <b>honestly</b> don't know." [...] When Wang was asked the same question by the investigators, he replied, [...] "No one is responsible." [...] When the investigators asked Martin what action he took when the F-15s called a visual identification on two Hind helicopters, Martin stated, [...] "I did nothing." ...|$|E
