25|$|By the way, {{would you}} convey my {{compliments}} to the purist who reads your proofs {{and tell him}} or her that I write {{in a sort of}} broken-down patois which is something like the way a Swiss-waiter talks, and that when I split an infinitive, God <b>damn</b> <b>it,</b> I split it so it will remain split, and when I interrupt the velvety smoothness of my more or less literate syntax with a few sudden words of barroom vernacular, this is done with the eyes wide open and the mind relaxed and attentive. The method may not be perfect, but it is all I have.|$|E

500|$|The new {{publisher}} scrapped Vanderbilt's editorial policy, {{and began}} a campaign against vice. The Los Angeles police chief, James E. Davis, had a hands-off policy {{when it came to}} vice and organized crime. Most local reporters valued the perks given to them by the police, and did nothing to push the issue. [...] After Boddy began a crusade against crime and corruption, he weathered harassment by police and politicians, circulation rose, and the paper was soon showing a profit. Boddy also streamlined operations and stabilized the paper's management. During the first six years of Boddy's ownership, the Daily News maintained a conservative editorial policy. By 1932, Boddy had dropped the word [...] "Illustrated" [...] from the name of the paper. He was a personal supporter of Herbert Hoover's bid for reelection. Los Angeles newspaper owners met and decided that, with all newspaper owners supporting Hoover, one paper had to support Democratic candidate and New York governor Franklin Roosevelt, and Boddy and the Daily News volunteered for the job. The day after the election, which saw Roosevelt elected, Boddy turned to his city editor and said of the voters: [...] "They have made a terrible mistake. I helped them do it. But <b>damn</b> <b>it,</b> I had to make a living." ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout his term, Scott was {{dogged by}} rumors of heavy {{drinking}} and {{frequent use of}} profanity. On one occasion, an unnamed individual believed his reputation had been injured by something Scott had said and challenged him to a duel. He ignored the challenge, after which the challenger threatened to expose him as a coward. Scott {{was supposed to have}} replied, [...] "Post and be damned; but if you do, you will only post yourself a damned liar, and everybody else will say so." [...] On another occasion, after reviewing a speech written for him by Bledsoe, the governor was said to have remarked, [...] "Well, Mr. Bledsoe, I know you think you are a damned sight smarter than I am, and so you are in many respects; but this message as it is now, won't do at all; I'll be damned if it will." [...] When Bledsoe asked what was wrong with the speech, he reportedly replied, [...] "Why, <b>damn</b> <b>it</b> to hell, why don't you put a good solemn prayer at the end of it, and talk about Providence, and the protection of Heaven, and all that?" [...] After the governor campaigned for Humphrey Marshall's opponent in the 1809 legislative elections, Marshall published an article in the Western World newspaper that accused him of appearing in front of the court house drunk on election day.|$|E
500|$|The only European {{shows in}} Paris, France, were also lauded by critics. Lewis Corner of Digital Spy gave the second Parisian show a five star review. He praised the {{performance}} abilities of both artists, explaining [...] "When left to [...] own devices on stage, the rapper is forceful and beguiling. It takes little {{for him to}} have thousands waving their hands to 'Tom Ford', as he looks dapper in honour of the designer. But when Beyoncé rises up out of the stage in a denim military outfit to the question 'bad bitch?' and then storms into 'Run The World (Girls)', the track's sentiment couldn't resound more. Without doubt, she lives up to her hype as one of the world's best performers. Slick movement, tight choreography, innocent attitude and effortless vocals instantly escalate the atmosphere of the show." [...] Simon Harper of Clash felt that both performers had immediately apparent different performance approaches and both commanded an [...] "incredible presence and deafening screams from the French crowd", however concluded that Beyoncé just finished on top as the better of the two, finalising his all positive review with [...] "The music world's most powerful and influential partnership couldn't fail to demonstrate the reasons for their rise to dominance... As the On The Run tour comes to its conclusion, it's clear to see that Mrs. Carter emerges on top. But <b>damn,</b> <b>it</b> was a good race to watch." ...|$|E

2500|$|Philip Liechty, {{a senior}} CIA officer in Indonesia, stated: [...] "I saw {{intelligence}} {{that came from}} hard, firm sources in East Timor.

We knew the place was a free-fire zone and that Suharto was given the green light by the United States {{to do what he}} did. We sent the Indonesian generals everything that you need to fight a major war against somebody who doesn't have any guns. We sent them rifles, ammunition, mortars, grenades, food, helicopters. You name it; they got it. ... None of that got out in the media. No one gave a <b>damn.</b> <b>It</b> is something that I will be forever ashamed of. The only justification I ever heard for what we were doing was the concern that East Timor {{was on the verge of}} being accepted as a new member of the United Nations and there was a chance that the country was going to be either leftist or neutralist and not likely to vote [...] at the UN.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{intended}} as a nonsense song for children, [...] "Yellow Submarine" [...] received various social and political interpretations at the time; music journalist Peter Doggett wrote that the [...] "culturally empty" [...] song [...] "became a kind of Rorschach test for radical minds." [...] The song's chorus was reappropriated by schoolchildren, sports fans, and striking workers in their own chants. At a Mobe protest in San Francisco, a yellow papier-mâché submarine made {{its way through the}} crowd, which Time magazine interpreted as a [...] "symbol of the psychedelic set's desire for escape". A reviewer for the P.O. Frisco wrote in 1966, [...] "the Yellow Submarine may suggest, {{in the context of the}} Beatles' anti-Vietnam War statement in Tokyo this year, that the society over which Old Glory floats is as isolated and morally irresponsible as a nuclear submarine." [...] Writing for Esquire, Robert Christgau felt that the Beatles [...] "want their meanings to be absorbed on an instinctual level" [...] and wrote of the interpretations, [...] "I can't believe that the Beatles indulge in the simplistic kind of symbolism that turns a yellow submarine into a Nembutal or a banana—it is just a yellow submarine, <b>damn</b> <b>it,</b> an obvious elaboration of John 's submarine fixation, first revealed in A Hard Day's Night." ...|$|E
