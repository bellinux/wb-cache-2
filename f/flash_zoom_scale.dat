40|$|A zoomable user {{interface}} (ZUI) {{is a useful}} function to help users deal with large information spaces displayed within a screen. However, ZUI usability has not been sufficiently studied. Its problems may be more crucial for older users than younger ones. This study {{examined the effects of}} three zoom foci (original-center, re-center and dynamic) and two <b>zoom</b> <b>scales</b> (100 % and 400 %) for the younger and older adults on mouse-based information searching tasks in a map-type space. Twenty four subjects participated in the experiments by answering a pair of questions. Task completion time, number of operations and number of errors were measured, and a satisfaction rate was collected. Older adults used the ZUIs less efficiently than younger ones. The effects of zoom focus methods varied with the <b>zoom</b> <b>scales</b> regardless of the age groups. The participants preferred using the dynamic focus regardless of <b>zoom</b> <b>scale</b> and using the re-center focus with the 400 % scale. We discuss potential implications of the age-related performance differences and the effects of ZUI functions, and suggest some ZUI design guidelines in conclusion...|$|R

2500|$|A {{scene in}} the episode [...] "Crisis", where Adam Knight returns and {{subsequently}} shoots Lana in an alley, resulted in Entity FX doing more special effects work on a single scene than is typically performed. To make sure the computer-generated effects matched the set the actors were filming on, Mat Beck left his office in Los Angeles and travelled to the Smallville set to work alongside John Wash and John Hahn in constructing the scene. Producer Ken Horton {{wanted to be able}} to see the bullet travelling through each of the raindrops as it made its way toward Lana. To accomplish this, the team made the digital bullet larger than normal for better visibility. While filming, a <b>flash</b> <b>zoom</b> was created that would track around Kreuk as she was running, achieving the effect of watching the bullet get fired from the gun, fly through the raindrops, and then as the camera rotates around you see the bullet just as it about to hit Lana before Clark runs in and stops it. This moment in the scene is done in a freeze-frame shot, and the moment Clark stops the bullet everything returns to real time.|$|R

40|$|To {{maintain}} {{safe operation}} of the tower crane, {{it is important to}} monitor the activities of the hook system. Visual monitoring and image recognition are the optimum methods for crane hook tracking and precision hoisting. High real-time performance and low computation requirements are required for tower crane hook capturing and tracking system which is implemented on the embedded Advanced RISC Machines (ARM) processor or Microcontrol Unit (MCU). Using the lift rope of a tower crane as the target object, a new high-performance hook tracking method suitble for ARM processor or MCU applications is presented. The features of the lifting process are analyzed, and an improved progressive probabilistic Hough transform (IPPHT) algorithm is proposed which canreduce capturing time by up to 80 %.
