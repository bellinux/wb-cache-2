2500|$|In May 1960, Toole {{accepted}} a three-year fellowship {{to study for}} a Ph.D. in Renaissance literature at the University of Washington at Seattle. However, when he was offered a teaching position at Hunter College in New York, which suited his desire to study at Columbia, he chose to go there instead. At 22, he became the youngest professor in Hunter's history. Although he pursued a doctorate at Columbia, he became unhappy with his Ph.D. However, he wrote to Fletcher that he still liked Hunter, [...] "principally because the aggressive, pseudo-intellectual, 'liberal' girl students are continuously amusing." [...] Fletcher surmised that from these girls the character of Myrna Minkoff from Dunces was born. Toole, although generally only a [...] "Christmas-and-Easter churchgoer", had some apprehension about the anti-Catholic intellectualism {{of some of his}} students, and about them seeming ever watchful for a cause they could throw their liberal zeal behind. [...] "Every time the <b>elevator</b> <b>door</b> opens at Hunter, you are confronted by 20 pairs of burning eyes, 20 sets of bangs and everyone waiting for someone to push a Negro" [...] he is reported to have said. When he first arrived back in New York Toole dated Emilie Dietrich Griffin, another Louisiana transplant, with whom he had worked on the Hullabaloo staff, and later he dated another Louisianan, Clayelle Dalferes, whom he had learned of through Fletcher. The couple loved the cinema and movie-going was a constant staple of their dates. Both women said their relationships with Toole never progressed beyond the level of a good night kiss.|$|E

But they were uncomfortably polite for two days, and obviously were so afraid that they might quarrel that they were both prepared to quarrel.|$|E

The street cars, as we went up and down to our offices, were a busy babel of garden talk. There was a sort of farmer-like geniality in the air. One spoke freely to strangers. Every man with a hoe was a friend. Men chewed straws in their offices, and kept looking out of windows to pretend to {{themselves}} that they were afraid it might blow up rain. [...] "Got your tomatoes in?" [...] one man would ask another as they went up in the elevator. [...] "Yes, I got mine in yesterday," [...] the other would answer, [...] "But I'm just a little afraid that this east wind may blow up a little frost. What we need now is growing weather."
