5|$|In November 2011, provincial government-appointed {{auditors}} {{backed up}} claims by Ocean Choice International (OCI) {{that they were}} losing millions of dollars each year operating the Marystown fish plant. On December 2, 2011, the company announced that they would permanently close their Marystown and Port Union fish processing plants and invest money into other plants throughout the province. The following week OCI asked the provincial government for an exemption to export unprocessed fish in return for nearly doubling the workforce at the company's plant in Fortune. Minister King reacted positively to the proposed idea and said the government would consider it. Negotiations on a deal would become tense, with the minister criticizing the company for using 'pressure tactics' to try to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>deal.</b> OCI {{said that they were}} in damage control all around the world because of Minister King's comments. In February 2012, the government rejected a proposal to drop MPRs for the company, saying that it was not {{in the best interest of}} the province. In mid October 2012, workers at the Fortune fish plant voted unanimously in favour of allowing OCI to ship out raw fish to China for processing, in return for 110 full-time jobs at their plant. The FFAW, which represented the workers, opposed the move to ship out the raw product. Dunderdale held a cabinet shuffle on October 19, 2012, and appointed Tourism Minister Derrick Dalley as the new Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture. In a news conference held on December 21, 2012, Minister Dalley announced the government would allow Ocean Choice International to ship 75 per cent of its yellowtail flounder quota overseas for processing, along with 100 per cent of its redfish quota. In return a total of 236 year-round jobs, between the Fortune fish plant and on company vessels at sea, for at least five years.|$|E
25|$|Clarke soon formed another {{band with}} Be-Bop Deluxe bassist, Charlie Tumahai, vocalist Ann McCluskie and Jim Thompson on drums. Called Continuous Performance, this line up lasted until early 1975, when their demo tracks failed to secure them a record deal and then band split up. Still out {{to secure a}} record deal, Clarke then formed a group with Nicky Hogarth from Blue Goose, bass player Tony Cussons and drummer Terry Slater. Their efforts to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>deal</b> were also unsuccessful, and Clarke {{temporarily}} gave up the music industry.|$|E
25|$|Streets of Fire {{began in}} the {{euphoria}} of knowing that Paramount really liked 48 {{and wanted to be}} in business with us if they could. What happened was that after we screened that cut for Paramount, Larry looked at Walter and said, “Paramount is pregnant; let’s get something and set it up right away.” Walter knew what he meant—that we were in a great position here—so he said, “We can do this two ways: present an idea now and <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>deal</b> done, or write a script on spec and get a lot more money.” Walter proudly considers himself a capitalist, so he suggested we do the latter.|$|E

500|$|On its {{original}} release in March 1995, The Beacon Street Collection was only available in local record stores in Orange County, California and at No Doubt's shows. Its rawer sound proved {{popular with the}} band's fans and the band's first batch of one thousand copies sold out within {{only a few months}} after its release. Interscope realized the band's potential and allowed them to record their third album, Tragic Kingdom in various Los Angeles studios, [...] "wherever they could <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>deal</b> on a studio". During a recording session, the band was introduced to Paul Palmer, who was interested in mixing the new album. He owned his own record label Trauma Records, which was associated with Interscope. Interscope willingly sublicensed the project to Trauma Records in 1995 and Tragic Kingdom got the personal focus that comes from a small company.|$|E
500|$|When Thom and Dev stop at Gray's Papaya for hot dogs, a {{confused}} Caroline escapes from Thom's van. Nick and Norah {{meet up with}} Thom and Dev {{to try to find}} her. A confusing phone call leads them to look for her at a club that [...] "Where's Fluffy?" [...] is rumored to be playing, but with no success. Tris, eager to win back Nick, catches up with them when she gets a phone call from Caroline, who is now able to tell Norah that she has [...] "found Jesus" [...] and [...] "an altar boy without pants." [...] They find a drunk Caroline on stage at a gay cabaret dressed as a Christmas tree. When they arrive at Nick's car, Tris is sitting on the hood waiting for him. Norah tells him how nice it was to meet him, but he leaves to talk with Tris without giving Norah a response. An upset Norah meets up at a club with her , Tal (Jay Baruchel), but soon realizes that he has an ulterior motive and hopes to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>deal</b> for his band with Norah's father, a record producer (...) [...] She agrees to pay for Tal and his friends' drinks, but she tells the waitress to increase the tab because there was a miscalculation, and she leaves him to pay. Nick, meanwhile, decides to confront Tris, but she tells him she wants to be together again and asks for a ride home. Tris asks Nick to stop by the river, where she tries to seduce him. Whilst she seductively dances in front of the car, Nick reminisces fondly about Norah and the night's events and drives away, leaving Tris behind.|$|E

2500|$|Twiztid's 1997 debut album, Mostasteless, was {{originally}} released independently by Psychopathic. When Insane Clown Posse signed with Island Records, they helped <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>deal</b> for Twiztid as well. In 1999, Mostasteless was pulled, and re-released on Island with somewhat different track listing. [...] That track listing included brand new songs, but left out tracks such as [...] "Murder Murder Murder" [...] and [...] "She Ain't Afraid" [...] because of uncleared samples. In {{his review of}} the reissued album, Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that [...] " [...] {{the thought of a}} group of Insane Clown Posse protégés isn't exactly inspiring", the album [...] "may take you by surprise...Mostasteless actually works better than most ICP records," [...] that [...] "Twiztid often is more convincing than [...] Dark Carnival colleagues," [...] and concluded that [...] "if you don't buy into the whole comic book-horror schtick, Mostasteless...will be irritating, but if you've bought into it, you'll enjoy this record as much, if not more, than most ICP albums." [...] Mostasteless peaked at #8 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers chart, and #149 on the Billboard 200.|$|E

You've got to keep your hand on the throttle." ...|$|E
