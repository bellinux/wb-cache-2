5000|$|Amandine is a Romanian {{chocolate}} layered cake {{filled with}} chocolate with caramel and fondant cream. Almond cream is sometimes used. As most Romanian cakes, {{they can be}} cut and served in 1-serving miniature cakes or as a big cake. They {{are among the most}} traditional [...] "sweetshop" [...] cakes in Romania. The original recipe has layers made out of a fine caramel syrup, flour, cocoa and egg-based dough with a dash of rum or rum essence. The layers are <b>heavy</b> with <b>syrup</b> that also has a dash of caramel and a dash of rum or rum essence. The cream between the layers is a combination of chocolate buttercream mixed with fondant. The setting of the cake is layer, cream, layer, cream, layer, glaze. The glaze is specific to this cake, and it's a combination of fondant with chocolate and rum or rum essence, poured over the cake while still slightly liquid. These cakes have also a traditional decoration on top {{with a little bit of}} the cream and a diamond-shaped piece of thin chocolate.|$|R

5000|$|Angel'in <b>Heavy</b> <b>Syrup</b> was an all-female Japanese {{psychedelic}} {{rock band}} formed in 1990 in Osaka. Emerging from the Japanese noise rock scene, they {{were influenced by}} krautrock bands such as Amon Düül II, but drew primarily from psychedelic and progressive rock, resulting in their characteristic ethereal neo-psychedelic sound. After the release of their last album in 2002, the band appears to have fallen into indefinite hiatus status.|$|E
50|$|The {{raw sugar}} {{is stored in}} large {{warehouses}} and then transported into the sugar refinery by means of transport belts. In the traditional refining process, the raw sugar is first mixed with <b>heavy</b> <b>syrup</b> and centrifuged to wash away the outer coating of the raw sugar crystals, which is less pure than the crystal interior. Many sugar refineries today buy high pol sugar and can do without the affination process.|$|E
50|$|Water {{evaporation}} {{is achieved}} by boiling, mostly in open pans, either in a single or {{in a series of}} pans located above a furnace. Larger factories use vacuum pans. In the last step of evaporation crystallization is achieved, either by pouring the <b>heavy</b> <b>syrup</b> into suitable molds to obtain solid forms or by stirring the syrup to obtain granulated product. The granulated product may be dried to enhance its flow and shelf life. Both solid and granulated presentations are then packed.|$|E

They also released two compilations, the best of compilation Najbolje pesme vol. 2 1992-1999 (The Best Songs Vol. 2 1992-1999) in 2002, and Breskve u teškom sirupu vol. 1 (Peaches in <b>Heavy</b> <b>Syrup)</b> in 2006, featuring unreleased material from the new wave era. In 2007 appeared the live album ElOrgNewWave, recorded during the Breskve u teškom sirupu tour, in the Belgrade Dom Omladine. Since 2006, with pauses, the band started preparing the new studio album with the work title To što vidiš to i jeste (What You See Is What You Get), for which the recording sessions were continued on December 2008.|$|E

The band then went on a nine-dates mini tour, performing the songs from the new wave period in a modern and rearranged manner, including the last concert at the Belgrade Dom Omladine, featuring guest appearance by the founding band member Ljubomir Jovanović [...] "Jovec". The whole concert was recorded and the recordings were released on the live album ElOrgNewWave, by Mascom in 2007.

In September the same year, the band went on their first United States tour.|$|E
40|$|Chronic {{diseases}} and healthy eating An alarming increase in such chronic diseases as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension and stroke, and {{some types of}} cancer has occurred {{over the past decade}} (Kant 2004). Improving diet quality by eating more whole grains and fruit and vegetables, and by eating less fat and refined sugar could help lower the incidence or severity of these diseases. Meeting these dietary recommendations does not necessarily require consumers to make major changes in their diet. Simple changes can be effective, such as substituting 100 percent whole wheat bread for white bread, lean ground beef for regular ground beef, low-fat milk for whole milk, or canned fruit in a light syrup for canned fruit in a <b>heavy</b> <b>syrup.</b> Few Americans successfully follow the USDA dietary guidelines, and low-income consumers are even less likely to meet them. When asked about barriers that prevented them from eating healthier foods, low-income consumers frequently cited high prices and difficulty in accessing healthier choices. However, no comprehensive studies have compared the cost of standard market goods to the cost of healthier substitutes. Measuring availability and prices In this study we compare the availability and cost of the standard Thrifty Food Plan (TFP) market baske...|$|E
