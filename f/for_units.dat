5|$|As {{the battle}} progressed, {{more and more}} forces would become {{available}} to the Germans. Adolf Hitler, stunned by the attack, agreed that the defence of the Netherlands should receive absolute priority and {{over the course of}} the battle reinforcements would stream in; from Wehrkreis VI, the Wesel area and General Friedrich Christiansen's Armed Forces Command Netherlands. Model arranged <b>for</b> <b>units</b> to be sent straight to the units in action in order to avoid long-winded logistics, and rushed in specialist urban warfare and machine gun battalions. Each day of the battle, the German military strength increased whilst the British supplies diminished. By 21 September, the fifth day of the battle, German forces outnumbered the British by 3:1 and continued to increase.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Turkish Nephrology Assocciation {{reported}} that seropositivity rate for hepatitis C was 19. 4 % and 4. 9 % for hepatitis B in haemodialysis patients and mortality rate from liver failure was 1. 9 % {{in those patients}} in 2004 annual report. In this study, it was aimed to determine the seroprevalances and chronicity rates of seropositive cases for hepatitis B and C among haemodialysis patients in Çanakkale province, Turkey. Method: In January 2007, totally 226 patients sera collected from four haemodialysis centers in Canakkale province were evaluated for the seropositivity of HBs Ag, anti-HBs, and anti-HCV by using Beckman Coulter enzyme immunassay method and 3 rd generation EIA test. Liver transaminase levels of 35 patients determined as seropositive for HBs Ag and anti HCV were evaluated prospectively for 6 months periods for 2 years and in January 2009, they all were tested for HBV DNA or HCV RNA by PCR method (Cobas Tagman Roche). Results: Seropositivity for HBsAg was found as 7. 21 % <b>for</b> <b>unit</b> A, 5. 66 % <b>for</b> <b>unit</b> B, 2. 38 % <b>for</b> <b>unit</b> C, no seropositivity was determined <b>for</b> <b>unit</b> D in haemodialysis centers which were examined. Seropositivity for Anti HCV was found as 9. 27 % <b>for</b> <b>unit</b> A, 15. 09 % <b>for</b> <b>unit</b> B, 11. 9 % <b>for</b> <b>unit</b> C and 5. 88 % <b>for</b> <b>unit</b> D. At the end of two years clinical survey, chronicity rates was 25 % for hepatitis C positive cases and 18. 1 % for hepatitis B positive cases. Conclusion: In this study, seropositivity rates of Hepatitis B was statistically meaningful <b>for</b> only <b>unit</b> C and D. Seropositivity rates of Hepatitis C was not different {{for the first three}} <b>units.</b> Whereas, seropositivity <b>for</b> haemodialysis patient group for hepatitis B and C were found less than in Turkish literature, chronicity rates for seropositive cases was found same as carrier in general population. As a result, we recommend to control over a long period liver transaminase levels of the seropositive hepatitis cases in haemodialysis units, and perform PCR tests and liver biopsy...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Although {{the impacts}} of {{structural}} instability on testing <b>for</b> <b>unit</b> root have been studied extensively for univariate time series, such impacts on panel data unit root tests are still relatively unknown. A major issue is the choice of model in accommodating different types of break (instability) prior to testing <b>for</b> <b>unit</b> root. Specifically, researchers must specify a potential break in the intercept, the trend or both before testing <b>for</b> <b>unit</b> root. Model misspecification {{has been known to}} have a great impact on the test performance in the univariate case, especially when the selected model fails to accommodate a break in the trend. However, the impact of model misspecification on testing <b>for</b> <b>unit</b> root is still unknown for panel data. This paper has two objectives: (i) it proposes a new test <b>for</b> <b>unit</b> root in the presence of structural instability for panel data. The test allows the intercepts, the trend coefficients or both to change at different date for different individuals. Under some mild assumptions, the test statistics is shown to be asymptotically normal which greatly facilitates valid inferences. (ii) Using the proposed test, this paper provides a systematic study on the impact of structural instability on testing <b>for</b> <b>unit</b> root using Monte Carlo Simulation. Specifically, the impact of model misspecification on the size {{and the power of the}} proposed test is discussed in details...|$|R

After fulfilling his duties with the Transylvania Company, he rejoined his family in Virginia, but returned to Kentucky the following year to claim and improve land for himself. After falling ill, he returned home in July 1776 to recover. Back in Virginia, fighting in the American Revolutionary War was underway, and Shelby found a commission from the Virginia Committee of Safety appointing him captain of a company of Minutemen. In 1777, Virginia governor Patrick Henry appointed Shelby to a position securing provisions for the army on the frontier. He served a similar role <b>for</b> <b>units</b> in the Continental Army in 1778 and 1779.

Amphibian scouts from the US 532nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment (EBSR) of the US 2nd Engineer Special Brigade, wearing Australian uniforms, {{advanced}} with the infantry and reconnoitred beaches from the landward side {{as they were}} secured. If a beach looked suitable, a second reconnaissance was made from the sea. Once a beach was selected, a shore party was brought in by landing craft {{to set up an}} administrative area. Engineers improved the coastal track to enable supplies to units moving along it to be brought up by jeeps but supplies <b>for</b> <b>units</b> moving inland over the high ground had to be brought by native carriers. Artillery guns were brought forward over the tracks, or else were moved by Landing Craft Mechanised (LCMs) of the 532nd EBSR. Tanks normally moved along the tracks but used LCMs to bypass obstacles. As the advance continued, new beachheads were opened up while rearward ones were closed. The advance was halted on occasion to allow for the guns to be brought forward or sufficient supplies to be accumulated at the forward beachhead.|$|E
