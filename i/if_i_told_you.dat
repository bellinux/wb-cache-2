6000|$|... "I suppose," [...] {{she went}} on, a little drearily, [...] "that even <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> upon my honour, of my certain knowledge, that the due {{delivery}} of that packet might {{save the lives}} of thousands of your countrymen, might save hearts from breaking, homes from becoming destitute--even <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> all this, would it help me in my prayer?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Eliz. But was she holy?--Died she in the Lord? Isen [weeps]. O God! my child! And <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>thee</b> all, How couldst thou mend it? ...|$|R

And then Robin and Maurice sing harmony on the chorus: You wouldn't know <b>if</b> <b>I</b> hadn't <b>told</b> <b>you</b> so, You wouldn't know <b>if</b> <b>I</b> hadn't <b>told</b> <b>you</b> so, oh.|$|R
6000|$|... "Almost thirty years. I shipped as {{cabin boy}} on a South America brig when I was fifteen. I'd be at it yet <b>if,</b> as <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> Betty hadn't {{anchored}} me ashore." ...|$|R
60|$|CONJURER. Because {{all this}} would not avail. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> the lie I told Morris Carleon about how I did that trick....|$|E
6000|$|... "I wonder," [...] she began, as {{they turned}} {{out of the white}} gates, [...] "whether you would mind very much <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> something?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{would you}} say, Harry, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> that I had murdered Basil?" [...] said the younger man. He watched him intently {{after he had}} spoken.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was foolish}} {{of me to}} {{withhold}} it--foolish and inconsequent. Yet <b>I</b> believe that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>I</b> {{should not have been}} here now. So, after all, I have no regrets.|$|R
6000|$|... "Good!" [...] said Mrs. Horncastle suddenly. [...] "Go to {{your room}} and lock the door, and I'll come to you later. Stop! Would Mr. Barker be likely to disturb <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> him <b>you</b> {{would like to be}} alone?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But don't you {{see that}} if you didn't let me know he was here it would look to him as <b>if</b> <b>I</b> didn't wish to meet him--as <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had <b>told</b> <b>you</b> {{that you were not}} to {{introduce}} him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As {{you mention}} 'the case' everywhere," [...] said I, [...] "perhaps {{you would not}} be {{offended}} with me <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> I should like to hear it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{would you}} say, Dick Gale, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> that you're {{the one man}} I'd rather have had come along than any other at this crisis of my life?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "’It’s no good, I tell you,’ ses the carpenter, ’it’s {{the most}} lasting black I know. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> {{how much that}} stuff is a can, you wouldn’t believe me.’ ...|$|E
5000|$|JP [...] "Well, even <b>if</b> <b>I</b> hadn't <b>told</b> <b>you</b> it was happening, {{the fact}} that we supply highly {{effective}} equipment to a regime like that is not a consideration, as far as you're concerned. It's not a personal consideration." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I didn’t want {{to spoil}} a bargain," [...] said the seaman carelessly. [...] "Maybe, you wouldn’t have bought the stone <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had <b>told</b> <b>you.</b> Mind that thing don’t go off; I don’t want to rob you. Point {{it the other}} way." ...|$|R
6000|$|MISS GALBRAITH: [...] "I {{dare say}}! I dare say they won't appear vital to you, Allen. Nothing does. And <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> <b>I</b> {{should have been}} met with ridicule, I suppose. But I knew BETTER than to tell; I {{respected}} myself too MUCH." ...|$|R

6000|$|Louise laughed joyously. [...] "Well, you wouldn't {{understand}} what a triumph it was <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you.</b> I suppose, papa, you've no idea how Philistine you are. But you're nothing to mamma!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't leave {{while you}} feel this way," [...] he pleaded. [...] "I can't abandon what I have of you--what you will let me take. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> I would be reasonable--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Have <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> {{already that}} <b>I</b> went to Aldborough {{to try and}} find a clew to your whereabouts? I can't be at the trouble of looking back to see; so, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> <b>I</b> tell you again. The truth is, I made an {{acquaintance}} at Aldborough of whom you know something--at least by report.|$|R
6000|$|... "And why not now? Is {{a man to}} {{be blind}} to facts as evident as the noon-day sun, because he was born here or there? <b>If</b> <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> <b>you</b> an {{unpleasant}} truth, Miss Effingham, you must accuse la franchise of the offence.

6000|$|... ["Perhaps I should myself be {{much better}} pleased, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were <b>told</b> <b>you</b> called me your little friend, than if you complimented me with {{the title of a}} 'great genius,' or an eminent hand, as Jacob does all his authors."--Pope to Steele, November 29, 1712, Works of Alexander Pope, 1871, vi. 396.] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed I shall {{do nothing}} of the kind. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> all he said, then I should {{have to tell the}} next man all that you may say. Would that be fair?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't {{remember}} <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> {{last night}} about the party. We are giving a little supper-dance {{to the company}} of Otie's play after the performance this evening. Of course you will come?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thought that}} <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> the {{circumstances}} you would understand afterwards if I wanted your help. I should {{feel so much}} stronger if I felt that {{you were at the}} back of me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Countess Radantz. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> remember, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> {{that it was}} {{her desire}} just now to remain incognito. I, however, {{unfortunately}} forgot this during the course of our conversation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Watson," [...] said he, as he {{rose from}} the table and paced up and down the room, [...] "You are most long-suffering, but <b>if</b> <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> <b>you</b> nothing in the last three days, it is because there is nothing to tell.

6000|$|... "If this {{is really}} going to be a lesson to you, my boy, never to bet on the result of a golf-match, it will be a blessing in disguise.

6000|$|... 'There {{were some}} very nice people among them, on whom the {{pictures}} {{were by no means}} thrown away. What would you say, Mark, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> that I strongly suspect that I have seen your lost aunt?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now {{what should}} you say <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> that you {{looked to me like}} a boy that was made {{especially}} to help run a candy counter at a circus, and if I offered the place to you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, that's {{too long}} {{a story to}} tell. It's a lot of {{machinery}} and paint and canvas. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> how it was done, you wouldn't enjoy it so well when you come on and see it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Even {{the very}} persons themselves--real live young men--we fixed on sometimes," [...] said Dot. [...] "We little thought how things would come about. I never fixed on John, I'm sure; I never {{so much as}} thought of him. And, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had <b>told</b> <b>you</b> you were ever {{to be married to}} Mr. Tackleton, why, you'd have slapped me. Wouldn't you, May?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dearest Elsley, I {{have sent}} for Mr. Thurnall. I {{knew you would}} not let me, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> you; but <b>you</b> see I have done it, and now you must really speak to him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There!" [...] said Dr. May, {{looking at}} Dr. Spencer, as <b>if</b> to say, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> so, {{in the first}} triumph of {{professional}} sagacity; but the next moment exclaiming, [...] "Poor little Meta!" [...] he hurried away.|$|R
