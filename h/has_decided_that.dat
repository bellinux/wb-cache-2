5|$|The International Size Acceptance Association (ISAA) is a {{non-governmental}} organization (NGO) {{which was founded}} in 1997. It has more of a global orientation and describes its mission as promoting size acceptance and helping to end weight-based discrimination. These groups often argue for the recognition of obesity as a disability under the US Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA). The American legal system, however, <b>has</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> the potential public health costs exceed the benefits of extending this anti-discrimination law to cover obesity.|$|E

These passports will no longer be valid since they are not machine-readable. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) <b>has</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> November 24, 2015 will be the deadline to implement the use of machine-readable passports only in travel through airports. Those who possess the red Lebanese passport must apply for the navy blue (machine-readable) passport as soon as possible.|$|E

25|$|In Denmark, it {{is legal}} to burn or desecrate the {{national}} flag, the Dannebrog. It is illegal to publicly burn or desecrate the flags of foreign countries, the United Nations and Council of Europe according to section 110(e) of the Danish penal code because Parliament <b>has</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> burning or desecrating these {{is a matter of}} foreign relations, as it could be construed as a threat. This law is rarely used; the last conviction was in 1936.|$|E

25|$|The {{courts have}} largely {{abandoned}} the Lochner era approach (ca. 1897–1937), when substantive due process {{was used to}} strike down minimum wage and labor laws to protect freedom of contract.

If they were not protected by the federal courts' doctrine of substantive due process, they could nevertheless be protected in other ways; for example, some rights are protected by other provisions of the state or federal constitutions or by legislatures.|$|E

Jos dies, possibly suspiciously, after signing a portion of his money to Becky as life insurance, setting her up with an income.

25|$|Delta Air Lines began leasing AirTran Airways' 717 in 2013 and was to {{eventually}} lease all 88 of the airline's fleet, as Southwest Airlines who purchased AirTran wanted {{to preserve its}} all-Boeing 737 fleet rather than taking upon another class of aircraft. In 2015, Blue1 announced it will sell their 717 fleet to Delta Air Lines and Volotea. For Delta, used Boeing 717 and MD-90s allowed them to retire their DC-9s while also being cheaper than buying brand-new Boeing 737 and Airbus A320s. Unlike other mainline US legacy carriers, Delta <b>has</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> its best path to profitability is a strategy that utilizes older aircraft, and Delta has created a very extensive MRO (maintenance, repair and overhaul) organization, called TechOps, to support them.|$|E

The Shelby GT350 was released onto the market in 2011 and since then, has been improved upon every year. In 2011, it only came as a coupe painted in white with blue stripes and for the 2012 model year, Shelby also added a convertible version with three more colors. For the 2013 model year, the GT350 will receive new color options, visual styling cues, and optional performance enhancements. The 2013 Shelby GT350 is powered by a 5.0 liter V8 engine offered in either a 430 HP normally aspirated version, a Ford Racing supercharged 525 HP, or a Ford Racing supercharged 624 HP version.|$|E

Albert, who <b>has</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> Louise is not worth fighting for, once again forfeits the duel. He retires to the saloon, but Clinch arrives and demands to know who kissed his wife. When no one comes forward, Clinch shoots a nearby cowboy (Ryan Reynolds). He reveals that Anna is his wife and threatens to continue killing unless his wife's lover duels him at noon the next day.

He kills many of the Gypsies and discovers the beast's lair, before leaving {{so that he can}} burn Mani's body at dawn, as required by the customs of Mani's tribe. After collecting Mani's ashes, he is overpowered by the local authorities and imprisoned. Sylvia visits him in jail and reveals to him that she is a spy for the Vatican. She explains that Henri Sardis, the local priest and leader of the Brotherhood, believes that he is restoring worship of God to France. Pope Clement XIII <b>has</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> Sardis is insane, and sent her to eliminate him. She then poisons Fronsac, telling him he knows too much.|$|E
25|$|Although the SSB was {{designed}} to operate without detection and under the defense secretary's direct control, it is commanded by high-ranking military officials. Strategic Support teams have about 10 members each, consisting of case officers, linguists, interrogators and other specialists from the Defense Human Intelligence Service, {{a branch of the}} DIA. The missions they undertake are secret, but members do not use covert methods like false identities or nationalities. The unit operated secretly in Iraq, Afghanistan and several classified locations for two years. The SSB works directly with United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) to add missing capabilities such as the skill to establish local spy networks and the technology for direct access to national intelligence databases to USSOCOM's special operations units, specifically the special missions units of the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC). Also USSOCOM previously had to receive permission from the CIA to conduct clandestine operations in certain countries, but that was no longer necessary after the establishment of the SSB. DoD <b>has</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> it will coordinate its human intelligence missions with the CIA but will not, as in the past, await consent.|$|E

500|$|The {{by-election}} {{was triggered}} {{by the death of}} Sibu's incumbent Member of Parliament, Robert Lau Hoi Chew on 9 April 2010. The Election Commission subsequently set down the by-election for 16 May 2010, with candidate nominations to occur on 8 May. [...] Within a few days, the Sibu branch of SUPP recommended Robert Lau Hui Yew to contest the by-election for the governing Barisan Nasional coalition. Hui Yew was the second cousin of Hoi Chew and the son of Lau Swee Nguong, chairman of the KTS Group of companies. On 14 April, the opposition <b>has</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> a DAP candidate should contest the by-election. Opposition Leader and People's Justice Party (PKR) adviser Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim scheduled a visit to Sibu on 18 April. On the same day, Sarawak Pakatan Rakyat was formed as an opposition coalition composed of the DAP, PKR, and the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS) — all members of the national Pakatan Rakyat coalition — and the local Sarawak National Party. The Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia, Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin visited Sibu on 19 April, expressing confidence that the voters were leaning towards supporting Barisan Nasional.|$|E
500|$|Season four {{also sees}} the writers {{exploring}} teenage sexuality through him, {{in a small}} arc with Faith, with whom Steven S. DeKnight compares him in their characterization of misguided youth with superpowers; and the overarching arc with his father's love Cordelia. Jeffrey Bell states Arthurian Legend's animosity between King Arthur, his son Mordred, and their love triangle with Guinevere as inspiration for the Connor-Cordelia-Angel plot line. Whedon notes that while he already <b>has</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> Cordelia and Connor {{were going to have}} sex, the story had to be changed and move faster because Charisma Carpenter became pregnant. The Cordelia plot line additionally gave writers opportunity to explain Connor's birth via Jasmine, a character brought in to replace Carpenter as final villain. Taking Jasmine as a base point the writers started connecting back the dots they'd set up in previous seasons. In the words of DeKnight, [...] "It's always been the big mystery of how and why Darla and Angel have a child, 'cause vampires are sterile. We find out this miracle birth was created kind of like a secret ingredient all planned out to sleep with Cordelia and create this superbeing." ...|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from October 29, 1910. It states: [...] "Marie is the tiny daughter of a well to do farmer. On Halloween her father, to amuse her, picks a pumpkin that she selects, and fashions a jack-o-lantern out of it. Her new toy pleases the child immensely, and at once takes a place in her affections equal to that held by her dollie. So it is natural {{that she should be}} thinking about the two of them when she is tucked into bed and falls asleep. Perhaps that was why the queen of the fairies came to her and invited her to a Halloween party that her loyal subjects were giving in their woodland retreat. And so that Marie would be perfectly happy, not feel embarrassed among strangers, the queen asked Dollie and Pumpkin to be her guests also. And, as a further mark of favor, she waved her hand, and Dollie and Pumpkin could run around and talk as well as Marie could. It certainly made it more enjoyable for the little girl. A fairy Halloween party is one of the finest things going in the amusement line, and only very nice and very good little girls are invited to them. As Marie filled these requirements, she had a perfectly glorious time, but was inclined to weep when she woke up later in her own little bed, and found that her toys had lost their miraculous gift of life. But it consoled her somewhat to have them, for they served as reminders of her wonderful evening. And perhaps the fairies will ask her to attend another party later. If they do, she <b>has</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> Pumpkin and Dollie must have their shares of the good times as before." ...|$|E
