5|$|In Iran, some golden jackals carry {{intestinal}} worms (helminths) and Echinococcus granulosus. In Israel, some jackals carry intestinal helminths and Leishmania tropica infection. In Romania, a jackal {{was found}} to be carrying Trichinella britovi. In northeastern Italy, the jackal is a carrier of the tick species Ixodes ricinus and Dermacentor reticulatus, and the smallest human fluke Metagonimus yokogawai that can be caught from ingesting infected raw fish, which can lead to metagonimiasis. In Hungary, some jackals carry dog <b>heartworm</b> Dirofilaria immitis, and some have provided the first record in Hungary of Trichinella spiralis and the first record in Europe of Echinococcus multilocularis. The jackal is dispersing across Europe through rivers and valleys, bringing parasites into regions where these did not previously exist.|$|E

25|$|<b>Heartworm</b> {{disease in}} dogs is spread by {{mosquitoes}} and is spread by the parasite Dirofilaria immitis. Signs include cough, difficulty breathing, and death.|$|E
2500|$|Wolbachia pipientis is an {{intracellular}} bacterium {{that is an}} endosymbiont of D. immitis. [...] All <b>heartworms</b> {{are thought}} to be infected with Wolbachia to some degree. [...] The inflammation occurring at the die-off of adult <b>heartworms</b> or larvae is in part due to the release of Wolbachia bacteria or protein into the tissues. [...] This may be particularly significant in cats, in which the disease seems to be more related to larval death than living adult <b>heartworms.</b> [...] Treating heartworm-positive animals with an antibiotic such as doxycycline to remove Wolbachia may prove to be beneficial, but further studies are necessary.|$|R
40|$|Feline lungworms and <b>heartworms</b> are {{stimulating}} {{the interest of}} the scientific community due to their clinical impact and apparent geographical expansion. Diagnosis of the infections caused by these nematodes is indeed challenging. This report describes a novel multiplex PCR able to identify simultaneously three species of lungworms (Aelurostrongylus abstrusus and Troglostrongylus brevior) and <b>heartworms</b> (Angiostrongylus chabaudi) affecting felids. Epidemiological and clinical perspectives are discussed...|$|R
5000|$|Track 13 on [...] "Side Two" [...] was {{originally}} released on a flexi-disc split with the <b>Heartworms.</b>|$|R
25|$|The tiger {{mosquito}} {{is relevant to}} veterinary medicine. For example, {{tiger mosquito}}es are transmitters of Dirofilaria immitis, a parasitic roundworm that causes <b>heartworm</b> in dogs and cats.|$|E
25|$|The {{course of}} {{treatment}} is not completed until several weeks later, when the microfilariae are dealt with in a separate {{course of treatment}}. Once <b>heartworm</b> tests are negative, the treatment is considered a success.|$|E
25|$|Ivermectin, {{even with}} lapses {{up to four}} months between doses, still {{provides}} 95% protection from adult worms. This period is called the reach-back effect. Annual <b>heartworm</b> testing is highly recommended for pet owners who choose to use minimal dosing schedules.|$|E
25|$|Surgical {{removal of}} the adult <b>heartworms</b> as a {{treatment}} also may be indicated, especially in advanced cases with substantial heart involvement.|$|R
50|$|Selamectin (trade names Revolution, Stronghold) is {{a topical}} {{parasiticide}} and anthelminthic used on dogs and cats, distributed by Zoetis, a former Pfizer subsidiary. It treats and prevents infections of <b>heartworms,</b> fleas, ear mites, sarcoptic mange (scabies), and {{certain types of}} ticks in dogs, and prevents <b>heartworms,</b> fleas, ear mites, hookworms, and roundworms in cats. It also removes 2 types of lungworm in cats (Aelurostrongylus abstrusus, Eucoleus aerophilus) and one type of lungworm in dogs (Eucoleus aerophilus). It is structurally related to ivermectin and milbemycin. Selamectin is not approved for human use.|$|R
50|$|In 2017, Mildenhall was {{the topic}} of a song by US-based band, The Shins, on their album <b>Heartworms.</b> Lead singer, James Mercer's father was based at RAF Mildenhall during Mercer's youth.|$|R
25|$|Pulmonary hypertension* is high {{pressure}} in the pulmonary artery. In dogs it {{can be caused by}} <b>heartworm</b> disease, pulmonary thromboembolism, or chronic hypoxemia (low oxygen). It can result in right-sided heart disease (cor pulmonale). Signs include difficulty breathing, cyanosis, and exercise intolerance.|$|E
25|$|Preventive {{drugs are}} highly effective, and when {{regularly}} administered, protect more than 99% of {{dogs and cats}} from <b>heartworm.</b> Most compromises in protection result from failure to properly administer the drugs during seasonal transmission periods. In regions where the temperature is consistently above 14°C (57°F) year-round, a continuous prevention schedule is recommended.|$|E
25|$|X-rays {{are used}} to {{evaluate}} the severity of the <b>heartworm</b> infection and develop a prognosis for the animal. Typically, the changes observed are enlargement of the main pulmonary artery, {{the right side of the}} heart, and the pulmonary arteries in the lobes of the lung. Inflammation of the lung tissue is also often observed.|$|E
5|$|The {{recently}} introduced red deer compete with pudús for food. Domestic dogs prey upon pudús and transfer parasites through contact. Pudús are very susceptible to {{diseases such as}} bladder worms, lungworms, roundworms, and <b>heartworms.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Heartworms</b> {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 73, based on twenty reviews.|$|R
25|$|Moxidectin {{has been}} {{released}} in the United States as part of Advantage Multi (imidacloprid + moxidectin) topical solution for dogs and cats. It utilizes moxidectin for control and prevention of roundworms, hookworms, <b>heartworms,</b> and whipworms.|$|R
25|$|Glomerulonephritis* is the {{presence}} of immune complexes in the glomerulus, resulting in leakage of protein into the urine. It can be caused by cancer, <b>heartworm</b> disease, pyometra, rickettsial infection, or systemic lupus erythematosus. It can result in chronic kidney failure, hypoalbuminemia, which can cause ascites and peripheral edema, and nephrotic syndrome, which can cause hypertension or hypercoagulability.|$|E
25|$|Dirofiliaria are {{important}} medical parasites, but diagnosis is unusual {{and is often}} only made after an infected person happens to have a chest X-ray following granuloma formation in the lung; the nodule may {{be large enough to}} resemble lung cancer on the X-ray and require a biopsy for a pathologic assessment. This may well be the most significant medical consequence of human infection by the dog <b>heartworm.</b>|$|E
25|$|Nematodes {{commonly}} parasitic {{on humans}} include ascarids (Ascaris), filarias, hookworms, pinworms (Enterobius), and whipworms (Trichuris trichiura). The species Trichinella spiralis, {{commonly known as}} the 'trichina worm', occurs in rats, pigs, and humans, and is responsible for the disease trichinosis. Baylisascaris usually infests wild animals, but can be deadly to humans, as well. Dirofilaria immitis are known for causing <b>heartworm</b> disease by inhabiting the hearts, arteries, and lungs of dogs and some cats. Haemonchus contortus {{is one of the most}} abundant infectious agents in sheep around the world, causing great economic damage to sheep. In contrast, entomopathogenic nematodes parasitize insects and are mostly considered beneficial by humans, but some attack beneficial insects.|$|E
50|$|A related {{dihydroxy}} avermectin B1 compound, ivermectin, is utilized orally {{in humans}} as an acaricide and insecticide {{for the treatment}} of strongyloidiasis and onchocerciasis. Veterinarians also employ ivermectin in the treatment of <b>heartworms</b> in dogs and other infestations.|$|R
50|$|Main rival {{products}} for dogs include ivermectin (trade names Stromectol, Ivermec and others) or milbemycin oxime (Interceptor) for <b>heartworms,</b> Advocate from Bayer (Imidacloprid and moxidectin), fipronil (Frontline) or lufenuron (Program) for fleas, or the combination milbemycin oxime/lufenuron (Sentinel) for both.|$|R
50|$|X-rays of {{the chest}} of a heartworm-infected cat may show an {{increased}} width of the pulmonary arteries and focal or diffuse opacities in the lungs. Echocardiography is a fairly sensitive test in cats. Adult <b>heartworms</b> appear as double-lined hyperechoic structures within the heart or pulmonary arteries.|$|R
25|$|Congestive heart failure* is {{the result}} of any severe, {{overwhelming}} heart disease that most commonly results in pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs), pleural effusion (fluid around the lungs), and/or ascites (fluid in the abdomen). It can be caused by the above two diseases, congenital heart defects such as patent ductus arteriosus, pulmonary hypertension, <b>heartworm</b> (Dirofilaria immitis) disease, or pericardial effusion. Signs depend on which side of the heart is affected. Left-sided heart failure results in rapid and/or difficulty breathing and sometimes coughing from a build-up of fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema). Right-sided heart failure results in a large liver (congestion) and build-up of fluid in the abdomen (ascites), uncommonly fluid around the lungs (pleural effusion), or, rarely, peripheral edema.|$|E
25|$|Microfilarial {{detection}} {{was accomplished}} most commonly {{in the past}} by the microscopic identification of microfilariae on a direct blood smear, above the buffy coat in a microhematocrit tube (or capillary tube), using the , or after millipore filtration. The accuracy of these tests, typically used for routine screening or diagnosis of <b>heartworm</b> infection, is improved by multiple testing. The modified Knott test and millipore filtration are more sensitive because they concentrate microfilariae, improving the chance of diagnosis. The direct smear technique allows examination of larval motion, helping in the distinction of D. immitis from Acanthocheilonema reconditum. This distinction is important because {{the presence of the}} latter parasite does not require expensive and potentially harmful therapy. However, the potential for a microfilaremic infections is 5-67%. The number of circulating microfilariae does not correlate with the number of adult heartworms, so is not an indicator of disease severity.|$|E
500|$|Directly {{west of the}} Health Education Center is the WesternU Pet Wellness Center, an {{on campus}} pet {{hospital}} and clinic. [...] The facility was established in 2008 as the Banfield Pet Hospital and transitioned to solely WesternU operation in 2014. The center provides primary care services such as vaccinations, spaying and neutering, microchiping, surgery, dental exams and cleanings, as well as flea, tick and <b>heartworm</b> control. The center includes a surgical suite, an x-ray room, a half dozen exam rooms and isolation facilities.|$|E
5000|$|Following this, the Shins {{signed to}} Columbia Records and Mercer parted ways {{with the entire}} {{original}} lineup, deeming it [...] "an aesthetic decision". Following a near five-year hiatus, Port of Morrow, the band's fourth studio album, was released in 2012. Their fifth album, <b>Heartworms,</b> was released in March 2017.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Heartworms</b> is {{the fifth}} studio album by American rock band The Shins. The album was {{released}} March 10, 2017, on Columbia Records. It is the Shins' first studio album in five years. The album was produced by James Mercer. [...] "So Now What" [...] was produced by former band member Richard Swift.|$|R
2500|$|After infection, the third-stage larval <b>heartworms</b> (L3) {{deposited}} by {{the mosquito}} grow {{for a week}} or two and molt to the fourth larval stage (L4) under the skin at the site of the mosquito bite. Then, they migrate to the muscles of the chest and abdomen, and 45 to 60 days after infection, molt to the fifth stage (L5, immature adult). Between 75 and 120 days after infection, these immature <b>heartworms</b> then enter the bloodstream and are carried through the heart to reside in the pulmonary artery. [...] Over the next three to four months, they increase greatly in size. [...] The female adult worm is about 30cm in length, and the male is about 23cm, with a coiled tail. [...] By seven months after infection, the adult worms have mated and the females begin giving birth to live young, called microfilariae.|$|R
2500|$|Founded in 1974, the American <b>Heartworm</b> Society is internationally {{recognized}} as the definitive authority with respect to <b>heartworm</b> disease in dogs and cats.|$|E
2500|$|Acute <b>heartworm</b> {{disease in}} cats {{can result in}} shock, vomiting, diarrhea, fainting, and sudden death. [...] Chronic {{infection}} can cause loss of appetite, weight loss, lethargy, exercise intolerance, coughing, and difficulty breathing. [...] The signs of heartworm-associated respiratory disease can persist even after complete elimination of the <b>heartworm</b> infection.|$|E
2500|$|Treatment {{typically}} {{consists of}} putting the cat on a monthly <b>heartworm</b> preventive and a short-term corticosteroid. [...] Surgery has also been used successfully to remove adult worms. [...] Ivermectin, milbemycin, and selamectin are approved for use in cats in the US. [...] The prognosis for feline <b>heartworm</b> disease is guarded.|$|E
50|$|After {{the band}} parted ways, Berry {{went on to}} sing with {{numerous}} bands including The Shapiros, Glo-worm, The Castaway Stones, Veronica Lake, Bright Colored Lights, Belmondo, Seashell Sea, The Relict and The Pines; she also returned to Chickfactor. Nelson continued with Velocity Girl. Moore went on to <b>Heartworms</b> and The Saturday People; Schulman to Magpies, Candleman, The Crabapples, Manatee and Hard Left.|$|R
50|$|In {{veterinary}} medicine ivermectin is used against many intestinal worms (but not tapeworms), most mites, and some lice. Despite this, {{it is not}} effective for eliminating ticks, flies, flukes, or fleas. Eggs and larvae mature {{and come back to}} the host. It is effective against larval <b>heartworms,</b> but not against adult <b>heartworms,</b> though it may shorten their lives. The dose of the medicine must be very accurately measured as it is very toxic in over-dosage. It is sometimes administered in combination with other medications to treat a broad spectrum of animal parasites. Some dog breeds (especially the Rough Collie, the Smooth Collie, the Shetland Sheepdog, and the Australian Shepherd), though, have a high incidence of a certain mutation within the MDR1 gene (coding for P-glycoprotein); affected animals are particularly sensitive to the toxic effects of ivermectin. Clinical evidence suggests kittens are susceptible to ivermectin toxicity. A 0.01% ivermectin topical preparation for treating ear mites in cats (Acarexx) is available.|$|R
40|$|A surveyof <b>heartworms</b> {{was made}} by {{necropsy}} examination of sixty-three wild raccoon dogs, which were trapped during 1978 - 80 in the central area of Japan. Two of them (3. 2 %) had the <b>heartworms</b> in the right ventricle and the pulmonary arteries. One raccoon dog had 6 worms, 3 females, and another one had 3 worms, 1 male and 2 females. From their morphological findings and measurements, they were identified as Dirofilaria immitis. Body length in total 6 worms was 15. 0 - 17. 5 cm in males and 24. 2 - 30. 5 cm in females. All of these females had the microfilariae in their uteri. These data indicate that the present worms were well mature, because these measurements are closely {{similar to those of}} the adult worms recovered from the dogs. The microfilaremia was observed in both raccoon dogs. In comparison of the microfilariae collected from the raccoon dog with those from the dog and the cat by commonly using the acetone concentration method, the body length of the microfilariae in the raccoon dog is similar to that in the cat rather than that in the dogs...|$|R
