5|$|Calculations {{show that}} the tank would have begun to {{overflow}} at about 05:20. There is <b>evidence</b> <b>suggesting</b> that a high-level switch, which should have detected that the tank was full and shut off the supply, failed to operate. The switch failure should have triggered an alarm, but it too appears to have failed. Forty-one minutes later, an estimated 300tonnes of petrol would have spilled {{down the side of}} the tank through the roof vents onto the ground inside a bund walla semi-enclosed compound surrounding several tanks.|$|E
5|$|On 9 September, McLaren lodged an {{official}} {{complaint with the}} FIA about the incident. In the appeal hearing on 22 September, McLaren alleged that they had twice been advised by race director Charlie Whiting that Hamilton had correctly returned the position to Räikkönen. Furthermore, they presented telemetry <b>evidence</b> <b>suggesting</b> that Hamilton had not only crossed the finish line after Räikkönen, {{but that he was}} travelling 6.7km/h slower at the time.|$|E

5|$|Styracosaurus {{and other}} horned dinosaurs are often {{depicted}} {{in popular culture}} as herd animals. A bonebed composed of Styracosaurus remains is known from the Dinosaur Park Formation of Alberta, about halfway up the formation. This bonebed is associated with different types of river deposits. The mass deaths {{may have been a}} result of otherwise non-herding animals congregating around a waterhole in a period of drought, with <b>evidence</b> <b>suggesting</b> the environment may have been seasonal and semiarid.|$|E
5|$|The {{memorial}} {{is located}} {{in front of the}} main entrance to Government House, {{one of the most prominent}} buildings in Adelaide, on the corner of North Terrace and King William Street. It was constructed with a budget of £2500 raised through public donations, and was designed by the London-based sculptor Adrian Jones. While the statue itself was not intended to represent any particular soldier, there is <b>evidence</b> <b>suggesting</b> that the head of the rider was based on that of George Henry Goodall.|$|E
5|$|Bobby tells {{a fellow}} student, Lisa Baiocchi, {{that she must}} stand up to her {{overbearing}} father {{just as he had}} done with Phil. When Lisa returns home, a window explodes and a shadowy, arm-like appendage grabs her father by the throat after he demands she stop seeing Bobby. His lifeless body is discovered lying on the ground outside the house. Though Scully concludes that Mr. Baiocchi died as the result of being pushed out of the window, Mulder discovers <b>evidence</b> <b>suggesting</b> he was pulled out by an outside force. Later, the agents learn that Lisa is another one of Karin Matthews' patients.|$|E

5|$|There {{is little}} {{documentary}} {{evidence about the}} nature of trade in Æthelberht's Kent. It is known that the kings of Kent had established royal control of trade by the late seventh century, but it is not known how early this control began. There is archaeological <b>evidence</b> <b>suggesting</b> that the royal influence predates any of the written sources. It has been suggested that one of Æthelberht's achievements was to take control of trade away from the aristocracy and to make it a royal monopoly. The continental trade provided Kent access to luxury goods which gave it an advantage in trading with the other Anglo-Saxon nations, and the revenue from trade was important in itself.|$|E
5|$|In {{the reign}} of Akhenaten (c. 1353–1336 BC) in the mid-New Kingdom, a single solar deity, the Aten, became the sole focus of the state religion. Akhenaten ceased to fund the temples of other deities and erased gods' names and images on monuments, {{targeting}} Amun in particular. This new religious system, sometimes called Atenism, differed dramatically from the polytheistic worship of many gods in all other periods. Whereas, in earlier times, newly important gods were integrated into existing religious beliefs, Atenism insisted on a single understanding of the divine that excluded the traditional multiplicity of perspectives. Yet Atenism {{may not have been}} full monotheism, which totally excludes belief in other deities. There is <b>evidence</b> <b>suggesting</b> that the general populace was still allowed to worship other gods in private. The picture is further complicated by Atenism's apparent tolerance for some other deities, like Shu. For these reasons, the Egyptologist Dominic Montserrat suggested that Akhenaten may have been monolatrous, worshipping a single deity while acknowledging the existence of others. In any case, Atenism's aberrant theology did not take root among the Egyptian populace, and Akhenaten's successors returned to traditional beliefs.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, Kamianets-Podilskyi Castle {{was thought}} to have been founded {{during the second half of}} the 14th century, as the first {{accurate}} historical accounts of the castle date back to the mid-14th century, when most of the territories of western Rus' were under control of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. A written document by Prince Yuriy Koriatovych in 1374, for example, mentions that the Magdeburg rights would be presented to Kamianets inside the castle. Archaeological excavations during the 1960s, however, provided contrasting <b>evidence</b> <b>suggesting</b> that the castle might date back even earlier to the end of the 12th or the beginning of the 13th centuries. It is also clear from historical and archaeological evidence that an earthen fortress existed in the area during the time of the East Slavic state of Kievan Rus', but not on the same site as the current castle.|$|E

5|$|Unknown biotoxins, pathogens, and the {{impairment}} of feather waterproofing {{can lead to}} hypothermia and avian cholera. Since this grebe usually winters on the coast, it is also vulnerable to oil pollution. Large-scaled deaths (such as 150,000 birds on the Salton Sea in 1992) from erysipelas, avian cholera and avian botulism have been recorded {{in the past and}} could threaten the species. These and other factors, such as human disturbance, including collisions with power transmission lines, contribute to declining populations in certain areas. This species used to be threatened in North America by the millinery industry, which helped facilitate the hunting of the birds, and egg collectors. Although this is true, this grebe is hunted in the Gilan Province in Iran, for both commercial and recreational purposes. However, there is no <b>evidence</b> <b>suggesting</b> that these threats could result in a significant risk for the overall population.|$|E
5|$|While {{many sources}} {{recommend}} additional intravenous agents to reduce {{damage to the}} kidney, most of the evidence supporting this practice comes from animal studies, and is inconsistent and conflicting. Mannitol acts by osmosis to enhance urine production and is thought to prevent myoglobin deposition in the kidney, but its efficacy has not been shown in studies {{and there is a}} risk of worsening kidney function. The addition of bicarbonate to the intravenous fluids may alleviate acidosis (high acid level of the blood) and make the urine more alkaline to prevent cast formation in the kidneys; <b>evidence</b> <b>suggesting</b> that bicarbonate has benefits above saline alone is limited, and it can worsen hypocalcemia by enhancing calcium and phosphate deposition in the tissues. If urine alkalinization is used, the pH of the urine is kept at 6.5 or above. Furosemide, a loop diuretic, is often used to ensure sufficient urine production, but evidence that this prevents kidney failure is lacking.|$|E
5|$|Rǫgnvaldr Óláfsson was one {{of several}} sons of Óláfr Guðrøðarson, King of Mann and the Isles (died 1237), and thus a member of the Crovan dynasty. Although Óláfr is known to have had two wives, and no {{contemporaneous}} source names the mother of his children, there is <b>evidence</b> <b>suggesting</b> that their mother may have been Óláfr's second wife: Cairistíona, daughter of Fearchar mac an tSagairt, Earl of Ross (died c.1251). Specifically, the Chronicle of Mann states that, when Óláfr died in 1237, he was succeeded by his fourteen-year-old son, Haraldr Óláfsson (died 1248). This source therefore dates Haraldr Óláfsson's birth to 1223, about the time when Óláfr and Fearchar allied themselves in marriage. The ancestral origins of Fearchar's family are unknown, although he {{appears to have been a}} native of eastern Ross. The Norse-Gaelic Crovan dynasty, founded by Rǫgnvaldr Óláfsson's paternal great-great grandfather, held royal power in the Isles from the late eleventh to the mid thirteenth century. Consisting of a region roughly encompassing the Hebrides and Mann, the Isles are named in Old Norse sources as Suðreyjar ("Southern Isles"), and in Gaelic sources as Innsi Gall ("Islands of the Foreigners"). Various documentary sources, in the form of contemporary chronicles and sagas, reveal that during the dynasty's tenure of power, the kings of the Isles tended to acknowledge the authority of the kings of Norway.|$|E

5|$|The first {{potential}} {{evidence for}} herding or flocking as a widespread behavior common to many dinosaur groups {{in addition to}} birds was the 1878 discovery of 31Iguanodon bernissartensis, ornithischians that were then thought to have perished together in Bernissart, Belgium, after they fell into a deep, flooded sinkhole and drowned. Other mass-death sites have been discovered subsequently. Those, along with multiple trackways, suggest that gregarious behavior was common in many early dinosaur species. Trackways of hundreds or even thousands of herbivores indicate that duck-bills (hadrosaurids) may have moved in great herds, like the American bison or the African Springbok. Sauropod tracks document that these animals traveled in groups composed of several different species, at least in Oxfordshire, England, {{although there is no}} evidence for specific herd structures. Congregating into herds may have evolved for defense, for migratory purposes, or to provide protection for young. There is evidence that many types of slow-growing dinosaurs, including various theropods, sauropods, ankylosaurians, ornithopods, and ceratopsians, formed aggregations of immature individuals. One example is a site in Inner Mongolia that has yielded the remains of over 20 Sinornithomimus, from one to seven years old. This assemblage is interpreted as a social group that was trapped in mud. The interpretation of dinosaurs as gregarious has also extended to depicting carnivorous theropods as pack hunters working together to bring down large prey. However, this lifestyle is uncommon among modern birds, crocodiles, and other reptiles, and the taphonomic <b>evidence</b> <b>suggesting</b> mammal-like pack hunting in such theropods as Deinonychus and Allosaurus can also be interpreted as the results of fatal disputes between feeding animals, as is seen in many modern diapsid predators.|$|E
