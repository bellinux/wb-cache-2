However, the CAS panel also noted Sharapova’s <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>disclose</b> her use of meldonium on her doping control forms {{and that she was}} at fault for (a) failing to give her agent adequate instructions as to how to carry out the important task of checking the Prohibited List, and (b) failing to supervise and control the actions of her agent in carrying out that task (specifically the lack of any procedure for reporting or follow-up verification to make sure that her agent had actually discharged his duty).|$|E

In Taylor, the Supreme Court upheld a judge's order blocking defense witnesses from testifying due to the defense attorney's deliberate <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>disclose</b> evidence to prosecutors earlier in the trial. The defense attorney's actions resulted in a lengthy delay in the proceedings which the trial judge felt was unjustified.

50|$|Goldstone and O’Regan JJ (Ackermann and Mokgoro JJ concurring) concurred in the result, but dissented {{insofar as}} they reached the {{conclusion}} that drawing an adverse inference from the first appellant’s <b>failure</b> timeously <b>to</b> <b>disclose</b> his alibi was an unjustifiable infringement of the right to remain silent. In considering the rationale for prohibiting inferences from silence, they rejected the argument that it is unfair to place the accused in a position where he will suffer adverse consequences whatever his election, on the basis that hard choices were unavoidable in the adversarial process. They went no further, though, than suggesting that it is inevitable that there may be adverse consequences from exercising the right to remain silent.

500|$|In Taylor, {{a series}} of {{deliberate}} discovery violations by the defense counsel at trial led the trial judge to block attempts at postponing proceedings to allow a further undisclosed defense witness the chance to testify; the judge had held {{that there must be}} some sanction against the defense for their <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>disclose</b> witnesses earlier in the case. A divided Court upheld the trial judge's preclusion of the witness, adding a new framework for balancing a defendant's right to a robust defense with {{a series of}} other factors. Namely, the new framework required looking at the state's interest in [...] "efficient" [...] justice, the state's interest in excluding evidence lacking integrity, the state's interest in a strong judicial authority with followed rules, and the prosecution interest in avoiding prejudice due to a defendant's discovery violation.|$|E
500|$|Conservative Melbourne lawyer Peter Faris QC {{called for}} {{an appeal to the}} High Court or changes to the laws of [...] {{evidence}} legislation, saying that [...] "this case is bad law", alternatively suggesting that Thomas be handed over to Pakistan, since he stated that the evidence from the interview would in his opinion be admissible in a Pakistani court. Faris also argued that there was an issue of apparent bias arising with respect to the presiding judge in the appeal, Maxwell P, which could afford grounds for invalidating the appeal. It should be noted, however, that Pakistani law of evidence does not permit a confession made to a police officer to be admitted into evidence. Faris argued that the apparent bias arose because of Maxwell's activities before his appointment to the Supreme Court of Victoria, including his membership of organisations including Amnesty International, his past presidency of Liberty Victoria, his past involvement with human rights law and advocacy against counter-terrorism laws. Faris drew a comparison with the House of Lords case which considered the extradition of Augusto Pinochet, which was overturned on appeal because of Lord Hoffman's <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>disclose</b> his links to Amnesty International.|$|E
500|$|During this period, Hand {{took part}} in three notable cases that posed a {{particular}} challenge to his impartiality on Cold War issues: United States v. Coplon, United States v. Dennis, and United States v. Remington. Department of Justice worker Judith Coplon had been sentenced to 15 {{years in prison for}} stealing and attempting to pass on defense information. In 1950, her appeal came before a Second Circuit panel that included Learned Hand. It rested on her claim that her rights under the Fourth Amendment had been infringed by a warrantless search, and that details of illegal wiretaps had not been fully disclosed at her trial. Hand made it clear that Coplon was guilty of the charges. However, he rejected the trial judge's conclusion that a warrantless arrest had been justified. He ruled therefore that papers seized during the arrest had been inadmissible as evidence. The trial judge's <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>disclose</b> all the wiretap records, Hand concluded, made a reversal of Coplon's conviction necessary. In his written opinion, Hand stated that [...] "ew weapons in the arsenal of freedom are more useful than the power to compel a government to disclose the evidence on which it seeks to forfeit the liberty of its citizens." [...] Many followers of the trial sent Hand hate mail for his decision. By contrast, in the 1950 case United States v. Dennis, Hand affirmed the convictions under the 1940 Smith Act of eleven leaders of the Communist Party of the United States for subversion. He ruled that calls for the violent overthrow of the American government posed enough of a [...] "probable danger" [...] to justify the invasion of free speech. After the case, he was attacked from the opposite political direction for appearing to side with McCarthyism.|$|E
40|$|In {{a country}} with a modern {{democratic}} system, the support of the public is vital to the continuance and legitimacy of the government. However, there is a perception in the Australian public that ethics is absent from politics. The public expects that parliamentarians will represent them and act with honesty and integrity, but believe that these expectations are not being met. This can contribute to a higher level of cynicism, disengagement and apathy with respect to politics. In order to respond to negative public opinion, mechanisms have been developed to restore and maintain ethical standards. However unethical political behaviour remains a problem in contemporary Australian politics whilst parliamentarians may face a series of ethical dilemmas. These dilemmas are exemplified in the following case studies: ICAC and the political demise of Nick Greiner in a case of improper influence; Nick Sherry's travel claims and misuse of allowances; United Kingdom cash-for-influence scandals of the last twenty years in cases of improper influence; the Tasmanian 'Shreddergate' affair in the case of misleading parliament; and Santo Santoro's <b>failures</b> <b>to</b> <b>disclose</b> financial interests in a conflict of interests case. As demonstrated through this analysis, a broader approach is needed to improve the existing framework for maintaining ethical standards, for example professional development and ethics training. Greater emphasis should be placed on ethics as a meaningful foundation for political behaviour. Ethics matters in politics, {{not only in terms of}} public expectations and government legitimacy, but also for the future of democracy...|$|R
40|$|After the exoneration of {{more than}} 200 people based on post-conviction DNA evidence, a growing {{movement}} against wrongful convictions has called increased attention to the prosecutorial suppression of material exculpatory evidence. Commentators frequently study prosecutorial <b>failures</b> <b>to</b> <b>disclose</b> {{as a form of}} intentional misconduct, coloring both the description of the problem and the recommended solutions. This Article, in contrast, explores how even ethical prosecutors might fail <b>to</b> <b>disclose</b> exculpatory evidence because off laws in the Brady doctrine itself-specifically, the Court 2 ̆ 7 s limitation of the doctrine to 2 ̆ 2 material 2 ̆ 2 exculpatory evidence. The materiality standard amplifies cognitive biases that distort even an ethical prosecutor 2 ̆ 7 s application of Brady, leading to systematic under disclosures of exculpatory evidence. The doctrine also inflates the tension between a prosecutor 2 ̆ 7 s dual obligations to protect the innocent while punishing the guilty, causing conscientious prosecutors to conclude they are 2 ̆ 2 doing justice 2 ̆ 2 by suppressing exculpatory evidence that {{does not appear to be}} material. Accordingly, it is the doctrine itself that must be reexamined. This Article proposes a prophylactic open file rule to effectuate defendants 2 ̆ 7 Brady rights. This doctrinal move would expand defendants 2 ̆ 7 federal constitutional rights to discovery, while respecting the Court 2 ̆ 7 s long-established view that only access to material exculpatory evidence is essential to due process. The Article situates the proposal within a jurisprudence of constitutional criminal procedure that often favors clear rules over open-ended standards, and compares the current need to safeguard defendants 2 ̆ 7 Brady rights to the necessity more than forty years ago to shift to a rule based approach in Miranda v. Arizona to regulate custodial interrogations...|$|R
40|$|In his Article, Litigating Brady v. Maryland: Games Prosecutors Play, Professor Gershman rightly {{argues that}} it is bad for {{prosecutors}} to play Hide and Seek or Blind Man 2 ̆ 7 s Bluff with Brady material. It is bad to treat one 2 ̆ 7 s constitutional obligation <b>to</b> <b>disclose</b> exculpatory evidence as a gamble or a scavenger hunt. It is bad for prosecutors to play all of these games. Rather than disagree with Professor Gershman, I 2 ̆ 7 d like to flesh out a point about a prosecutor 2 ̆ 7 s disclosure that I think, unfortunately, could get lost if we place {{too much emphasis on}} the comparison to games-in particular, if we take too literally the post-colon portion of this panel 2 ̆ 7 s title: 2 ̆ 2 Games Prosecutors Play to Avoid Compliance. 2 ̆ 2 To say that prosecutors play games to avoid compliance with Brady is to suggest that Brady itself is perfectly sound doctrine and that defendants would be in a fine position to have a fair shot in the adversarial system, just so long as those wily prosecutors would set aside their evil games, play fair, and comply with Brady. The story is more complicated, as Professor Gershman acknowledges in his piece, because the Brady doctrine itself invites many of the prosecutorial tactics that can be depicted as unfair gamesmanship. Without disagreeing with any of Professor Gershman 2 ̆ 7 s observations about purposeful, knowing, or ostrich-like prosecutorial <b>failures</b> <b>to</b> <b>disclose</b> evidence that qualifies as Brady material, I will talk about a problem that others have mentioned today but have not explored: how virtuous prosecutors-acting in good faith and trying to comply with Brady-might still fail to turn over exculpatory evidence. To continue the analogy of games, what I am exploring is not a game that prosecutors consciously play to avoid Brady, but instead a brainteaser that Brady itself forces prosecutors to engage in...|$|R
