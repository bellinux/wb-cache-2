25|$|I {{remember}} {{going out to}} bat at 5pm and Andy Roberts had just taken the second new ball. I had a really close lbw decision when I had scored about five. I knew I'd hit it but I didn't know that Robin Bailhache, the umpire, knew that <b>I</b> <b>hit</b> <b>it.</b> But thankfully he gave me not out. I went into lunch {{the next day at}} 99 not out and I was so happy to get a century with my parents and friends watching.|$|E
500|$|Killebrew {{was known}} for his quick hands and {{exceptional}} upper-body strength, demonstrated by several [...] "tape measure" [...] home runs that he hit in the prime of his career. Killebrew said that his first home run in the Majors was his favorite, coming off Billy Hoeft at Griffith Stadium. He said of it, [...] "Frank House was the catcher. When I came to the plate, he said, 'Kid, we're going to throw you a fastball.' I didn't know whether to believe him or not. <b>I</b> <b>hit</b> <b>it</b> out. It was one of the longest home runs I ever hit. As I crossed the plate, House said, 'That's the last time I ever tell you what pitch is coming'." ...|$|E
2500|$|On May 22, 2009, a video went viral of Hamilton freestyling, {{and then}} getting {{assaulted}} by his former girlfriend/fellow rapper Briana Latrise, the stepdaughter of Mary J. Blige, due to Hamilton rapping, [...] "OK, call me irresponsible and immature, but you're beautiful, {{what the hell}} else would <b>I</b> <b>hit</b> <b>it</b> for? Now I can say that <b>I</b> <b>hit</b> <b>it</b> raw, but {{that would mean that}} you will have to get an abor, or I just not need to go there", clarifying at some point at that past time that Hamilton had got Latrise pregnant but for undisclosed reasons Latrise would have an abortion. On May 25, 2009, during an interview, they both publicly apologized to each other, with Hamilton stating, [...] "I apologize honestly for putting some things out there that shouldn't have been out there. I understand it; it was the heat of the moment, and I didn't get the chance to really talk to you about it. I {{just wanted to tell you}} I apologize because I know what I shouldn't have said", and with Latrise remarking, [...] "I'm going to thank you for your apology. I'm going to apologize for acting outside of the norm. We're going to talk about our personal business, on our personal time." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the next}} major at the 1990 U.S. Open at Medinah Country Club, Faldo {{finished}} tied for 3rd place. In his final round of 69 he three-putted from 45 feet on the 16th hole for a bogey and missed a 12-foot birdie putt on the 18th, which lipped out of the hole. This resulted in him missing out by one stroke on an 18-hole playoff with Hale Irwin and Mike Donald. Faldo refused {{to come to the}} press tent after his final round and later, en route to the locker room, snapped at a journalist who suggested that he had hit his putt too hard on the final green. Faldo said: [...] "I hit it perfect. I hit a foot past the hole. How can you say <b>I</b> <b>hit</b> <b>it</b> too hard?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Rogue Traders {{formed as}} an Australian electronic, pop rock band in Melbourne in 2002 by {{former members of}} Union State, James Ash (aka Jamie Appleby) on {{keyboards}} and Steve Davis on guitar. The duo had met in 1989 in London where both were working as DJs. The pair first worked on a rap track, Ash recalled [...] "It was a terrible song but Steve and <b>I</b> <b>hit</b> <b>it</b> off straight away and became fast friends". Ash relocated to Melbourne in 1992, but the pair continued {{to work together and}} formed Union State to release singles including, [...] "Out to Get You" [...] and [...] "Retrosexual". In 1994 Ash signed with Vicious Vinyl as a solo artist under the name, Thunderchild, to issue a self-named single.

2500|$|He {{made his}} full {{international}} debut for England on 19 May 1951 against Portugal at Goodison Park, Liverpool, {{and made an}} immediate impression by scoring with his first touch of the ball after only 19 seconds. This proved to be his only international appearance due to injuries, the dominance of Billy Wright, and his habit of putting his club before his country. Nicholson {{is quoted as saying}} [...] "My duty is to get fit for Tottenham. Well, they pay my wages, don't they?". Of his only appearance he said [...] "Stan Pearson nodded it back and I ran on to let go a first time shot which, from the moment <b>I</b> <b>hit</b> <b>it,</b> I knew was going in. But for the next game they brought back Billy Wright and I accepted that because he was the better player". Nicholson is the only player to have scored for England with his first touch in international football and subsequently never play at that level again.|$|E

2500|$|Lü Bu {{set up a}} camp one li {{southwest}} of Xiaopei (小沛; present-day Pei County, Jiangsu) and invited Ji Ling to his camp. Ji Ling also hosted a feast in his camp and invited Lü Bu to attend. Lü Bu went there and brought Liu Bei along with him. He told Ji Ling, [...] "Xuande (Liu Bei) is my younger brother. I heard that he was trapped by you gentlemen, so I came here to help him. I don't enjoy getting into conflicts, but I enjoy helping others resolve conflicts." [...] He then had a ji erected at {{the gate of the}} camp, and said, [...] "Gentlemen, watch me fire an arrow at {{the lower part of the}} curved blade on the ji. If <b>I</b> <b>hit</b> <b>it</b> in one shot, all of you must withdraw your forces and leave. If I don't, you can remain here and prepare for battle." [...] He then raised his bow and fired an arrow at the ji, hitting exactly the lower part of the curved blade. Everyone present at the scene was shocked. They said, [...] "General, you possess godlike skill!" [...] The following day, they threw another party and then withdrew their forces.|$|E
2500|$|At the 1985 French Open, Evert {{would play}} her {{antagonist}} in Navratilova {{in the final}} {{for the third time}} here in Paris at Roland Garros. [...] In the first set, Evert would take the first three games, which Evert held her serve steady, and she broke Navratilova during the second game. [...] Evert would lose her serve in the fifth game of the set that gave her opponent a chance to level the set at three games-all, and she did just that. [...] To wrap up the set, Evert would rally off the next three games to take the set six games to three, breaking Navratilova in the eight game. [...] In the second set, it would be rather competitive with many ebbs and flows, even more so than the first set. [...] Evert would hold serve in the second set all the way until the eighth game, which Navratilova broke her serve to get back on serve, and would hold in the ninth game to take a five games to four advantage. [...] This set was still in doubt because both could not manage to hold serves and in the eleventh and twelfth games both would take turns in breaking each other's serves. [...] This sent the second set to a tiebreaker, which Navratilova would roar out of the gates with a four to one points advantage, and Evert could not manage {{to get back in the}} breaker that ended seven points to four. [...] In the 52 minute third set, Evert would storm out to a three games to love advantage, but knowing Navratilova, Evert found herself in a tumultuous battle for the title because her opponent would break back to level the set three games-all. [...] Evert managed to stave off a crucial break point opportunity in the seventh game of the set, when Navratilova guided her forehand into the net, and the score went to four game to three. [...] Evert broke Navratilova in the eighth game of the set, which allowed Evert to serve for the match at five games to three. [...] Evert would be incapable to serve out the match during the ninth game, which Navratilova broke, so this made the score five games to four. [...] In addition, Evert would serve twice for the match, but was broken at 15 and love in those games. [...] This failure to convert would cost Evert some grief by having in the eleventh game, which was because she got down love-40 on serve. [...] It took some fantastic shot making in order to divert having to break to stay in the match, which it a twist-of-fate Evert would break her opponent in the subsequent game to take the lead at six games to five. [...] Evert serving for the match at 30-all hit a winner crosscourt, and at match point went down the line, which then the championships was hers after a two-hour and 52 minute final tussle of the clash-of-the-tennis-titans. [...] Evert said [...] "when I hit the last winner down the line I was really proud of myself...I never gave up and when I finally got to match point I went for a winner and <b>I</b> <b>hit</b> <b>it.</b> I had held my emotions in for so long that I really kind of let go." [...] This title was her sixth French Open title and 17th slam for her career.|$|E

60|$|Words were wholly inadequate, so I slouched heavily {{after that}} {{impossible}} ball.

60|$|As {{his heavy}} boots thumped {{on the ladder}} they jarred the whole cabin. My very desperation filled me with the fierceness of a cornered animal.

5000|$|Of his own play-style, Simon has said, [...] "When playing my best, my {{strength}} {{is the ability}} to change my level.

60|$|You and <b>I</b> never <b>hit</b> <b>it</b> off {{together}} any too extraordinarily well, Madge; but I'm {{not altogether}} a bad sort. I am easy-going. I {{always have been}} easy-going.

60|$|He {{delivered}} the ball, and I could have yelled aloud, so fast, so straight, so true it sped toward me. Then <b>I</b> <b>hit</b> <b>it</b> harder than I had ever hit {{a ball in}} my life.

6000|$|... "It was a man's leg. I {{suddenly}} saw it {{below that}} rift behind the rock. I expect {{he had no}} idea that his foot showed there.

5000|$|... "The {{bass drum}} legs were {{different}} lengths so they wouldn't touch {{the ground at}} the same time.
