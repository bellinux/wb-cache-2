5|$|This {{approach}} has been widely adopted, particularly within Australia. Several other regulators have similar approaches. It is also described as the enforcement pyramid by some regulators although <b>enforcement</b> <b>is</b> {{only one of the}} compliance strategies implicit in the model.|$|E
5|$|CMVs are {{required}} to pass through weigh stations at the borders of most states and some large cities. These weigh stations are run by state DOTs, and CMV weight and size <b>enforcement</b> <b>is</b> overseen by the FHWA. Weigh stations check each vehicle's gross weight and axle weight using a set of in-ground truck scales, and are usually where a truck's compliance with the formula is checked.|$|E
5|$|According to the city's police department, {{there were}} six murders, 125 robberies, 22 rapes, and 237 assaults in 2014 (an {{increase}} from the previous year, representing a violent-crime rate of 0.6percent). There were 432 burglaries, 1,845 larcenies and 107 motor-vehicle thefts (a decrease from 2013, representing a property-crime rate of 3.8percent). Compared to other cities in New York, Utica's crime rate is generally low. The Utica Police Department patrols the city, and law <b>enforcement</b> <b>is</b> also {{under the jurisdiction of}} the Oneida County Sheriff's Office and the New York State Police. The Utica Fire Department coordinates four engines, two truck companies, and rescue, HAZMAT and medical operations with a 123-person crew.|$|E

5|$|Angel sharks {{in general}} are highly {{threatened}} by commercial trawl fisheries due to their susceptibility to capture and low rate of reproduction, and angel shark species elsewhere {{are known to have}} declined markedly under fishing pressure. Trawling activity in the Yellow Sea {{and other parts of the}} northwestern Pacific is intense and, coupled with pollution, has had a serious impact on the local ecosystem. The Japanese angelshark population is suspected to have declined by up to 50% or more under these conditions, leading the species to be assessed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). It may benefit from a ban on trawling imposed in some areas by the Chinese government, though <b>enforcement</b> <b>is</b> inconsistent.|$|E
5|$|Law <b>enforcement</b> <b>is</b> {{carried out}} by organisations mainly {{subordinate}} to the Ministry of the Interior. The National Police Service (NPS) combats general crime, maintains public order and supports the operations of other law enforcement agencies. NPS fields 27,000 police officers in its local and national sections. The Ministry of Interior also heads the Border Police Service and the National Gendarmerie—a specialised branch for anti-terrorist activity, crisis management and riot control. Counterintelligence and national security are {{the responsibility of the}} State Agency for National Security, established in 2008.|$|E
5|$|New Jersey and {{all other}} U.S. states comport with the {{requirement}} of the National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984, which sought to set a national standard of 21 as the minimum age for purchasing and publicly possessing alcoholic beverages. To make states comply, Congress tied a state's failure to enact a drinking age at 21 to a punitive decrease in a state's apportionment of federal highway funding. Federal law requires colleges and universities that accept federal financial aid institute policies to sanction students who violate underage drinking and other alcohol laws, and to track the number of liquor laws violations. The Chronicle of Higher Education has reported that many colleges fail to comply with these laws, and federal <b>enforcement</b> <b>is</b> minimal.|$|E
50|$|In Maryland, former Governor Robert Ehrlich opposed {{spotlights}} used {{by police}} officers to see into vehicles at night to determine if seat belts were being used {{on the basis that}} this violated privacy. Nighttime <b>enforcement</b> <b>was</b> suspended at the governor's request. Nighttime <b>enforcement</b> <b>was</b> resumed by Ehrlich's successor, Martin O'Malley, hours after O'Malley took office in January 2007.|$|R
5000|$|Immigration from Mexico was not {{formally}} regulated until the Immigration Act of 1917, but <b>enforcement</b> <b>was</b> lax and many exceptions were given for employers. In 1924, {{with the establishment}} of the U.S. Border Patrol, enforcement became more strict, [...] and in the late 1920s before the market crash, as part of a general anti-immigrant sentiment, <b>enforcement</b> <b>was</b> again tightened.|$|R

5|$|Both the Bengal slow loris and pygmy slow loris {{are found}} in more than 20 {{protected}} areas, although their populations are either low or insufficiently recorded. The pygmy slow loris is protected in most of its range states: in Cambodia, China, and Vietnam. This makes hunting and capture illegal, and in China and Vietnam, possession and storage are also illegal. Under Vietnamese law it has had {{the highest level of}} wildlife protection since 1992, all exploitation and use of the pygmy slow loris is illegal. However, <b>enforcement</b> <b>is</b> poor while minor penalties have little deterring effect. In terms of international protection, the species was elevated to Appendix I of CITES in 2007. In addition, since October 2001, the European Union prohibits imports for all wild specimens of pygmy slow loris from Laos and Cambodia for conservation reasons.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the added}} {{protection}} of CITES Appendix I status, wild slow lorises still receive poor protection because {{enforcement of the}} international trade ban is difficult and the penalties are minor. Slow lorises are still found in large numbers at animal markets, most notably in Cambodia and Indonesia, but the traders show no concern for being caught. During a study by Nekaris etal. published in 2010, vendors in Medan, Jakarta, and Surabaya spoke freely to researchers about how they obtain slow lorises, their uses in medicine, prices, and sales numbers. The markets were not concealed, but were open daily in a designated area in town. Even law <b>enforcement</b> <b>is</b> involved in the trade, with park rangers and police admitting to the purchase of slow lorises for medicinal purposes. The wife of another law enforcement official from the Mondulkiri Province in Cambodia {{is one of the}} most notable sellers of slow loris parts.|$|E
5|$|In a 1976 referendum, New Jersey voters {{approved}} casino gambling in Atlantic City. Because {{of concerns about}} organized crime connections to gambling, New Jersey enacted strict regulations that included licensing of all casino employees and contractors, and a separation of powers between the Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE) and the Casino Control Commission (CCC). The Division of Gaming <b>Enforcement</b> <b>is</b> part of the New Jersey Department of Law and Public Safety, and is responsible for investigating casino license applications, monitoring casino operations, and enforcing New Jersey's casino laws and regulations as defined in Title 5, Chapter 12 of New Jersey's statutes, and Title 13, Chapter 69I of New Jersey's Administrative Code. The Casino Control Commission is an independent agency in the state Treasury Department with both quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial powers, and is responsible for creating casino regulations, hearing appeals of DGE penalties, and make decisions on casino licensing. In light of such regulation and the uniqueness of casino gambling, New Jersey's twelve casinos are not {{under the jurisdiction of}} the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) or Atlantic City's alcoholic beverage control board.|$|E

5|$|Jordan's law <b>enforcement</b> <b>is</b> {{under the}} purview of the Public Security Directorate (which {{includes}} approximately 50,000 persons) and the General Directorate of Gendarmerie, both of which are subordinate to the country's Ministry of Interior. The first police force in the Jordanian state was organised {{after the fall of the}} Ottoman Empire on 11 April 1921. Until 1956 police duties were carried out by the Arab Legion and the Transjordan Frontier Force. After that year the Public Safety Directorate was established. The number of female police officers is increasing. In the 1970s, it was the first Arab country to include females in its police force. Jordan's law enforcement was ranked 37th in the world and 3rd in the Middle East, in terms of police services' performance, by the 2016 World Internal Security and Police Index.|$|E

25|$|Slaves {{can be an}} {{attractive}} investment because the slave-owner only needs to pay for sustenance and enforcement. This is sometimes lower than the wage-cost of free labourers, because free workers earn more than sustenance, in these cases slaves have positive price. When the cost of sustenance and enforcement exceeds the wage rate, slave-owning {{would no longer be}} profitable, and owners would simply release their slaves. Slaves are thus a more attractive investment in high-wage environments, and environments where <b>enforcement</b> <b>is</b> cheap, and less attractive in environments where the wage-rate is low and <b>enforcement</b> <b>is</b> expensive.|$|E
