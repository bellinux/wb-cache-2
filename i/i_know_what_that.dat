6000|$|... "Impracticable?" [...] said Rachel, {{taking up}} the long word. [...] "He objects to your exerting {{yourself}} in the parish. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> is." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! A continuosity? <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> {{is in the}} {{ordinary}} acceptation of the term, but I'm not sure that I follow your meaning exactly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And the {{assistance}} {{for which you}} wish?" [...] said father, putting his hand in his pocket. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> action means when I am talking to him.|$|E
5000|$|Elaine: She's {{this crazy}} {{woman who is}} {{convinced}} that my germs make her sick. Puddy: Oh, germophobe. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that's</b> about.|$|R
6000|$|One from EPHRAIM and MOSES, Wanting coin {{without a}} doubt, I {{should like to}} pull their noses-- Their uncompromising noses; One from ALICE with the roses-- Ah, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that's</b> about ! ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> meant, {{and a cold}} shiver went up {{and down}} my backbone. But I looked down at him--spick-and-span and glossy--his neckties are never crooked--and said, yes, he might come at three o'clock.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, for you <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> means. Well, I {{have seen}} monsieur; {{that is what}} I wanted. He can't persuade me that he isn't very clever. Farewell." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> long tail is for," [...] cried Peter. [...] "It is to {{keep him}} {{balanced}} when {{he is in the}} air so that he can jump straight." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} know, and <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> amounts to now. My {{idea is that}} you acted as an honest man when you were last here. You are not a rich man--" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> remarked <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> meant: he {{had lost}} his sense of {{direction}} and had now all at once recovered it; such a thing had often happened; I once had such an experience myself.|$|R
5000|$|During {{his time}} as a wrestler, Leslie stood 10 feet from Adolf Hitler and in his words, [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> SOB was going to do, I would've gladly given my life and killed him {{right there on the}} spot." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> meant, {{and a cold}} shiver {{passed through}} my frame as the men obeyed, and blind-folded Edwards, preparatory to making him walk the plank. I could {{restrain}} myself no longer. Darting up to the captain, I shouted in a voice of indignation-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What is a lorry?" [...] asked Septimus suddenly; [...] "I don't {{mean the}} thing on wheels, of course <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> is, but isn't there a bird {{with a name}} like that, the larger form of a lorikeet?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> means. It is only teasing the cousinhood {{when they}} fall on him open-mouthed," [...] said Geraldine, with a laugh, though with a qualm of misgiving at her heart, while Clement sat {{listening}} and thinking.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, yes; and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> amounts to. It {{troubles}} me, Clym. You are {{wasting your}} life here; {{and it is}} solely on account of her. If {{it had not been}} for that woman you would never have entertained this teaching scheme at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I rather think not. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> mare was, well enough. A dealer {{would have}} had three hundred and fifty pounds for her. I could have got the money easily if I had taken her down into the shires, and ridden her {{a day or two}} myself." ...|$|R
60|$|ENID. [Coldly.] And <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> {{has to do}} {{with this}} question.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not to mother; but to {{hear him}} and Miss Parsons is enough to drive one wild. They went on such a dreadful way {{yesterday}} that I was furious, and so glad to get away to Kenminster; only after I had set off, he came running after me, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> would be." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's nonsense," [...] said Mrs. Proudie, [...] "and {{usually means}} worse than nonsense. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> comes to. If {{you have three}} {{services}} on Sunday and domestic prayers at home, you do very well." [...] And so saying she handed him his cup.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Free--yes, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> means--free {{among the}} dead,' said Averil, calmly, {{smoothing}} Cora's hair, and looking in her face. 'Don't {{be afraid to}} let me hear. I shall be there with him and Minna soon. Didn't somebody come to tell me? Please let him in, I'll be quiet now.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hugh {{promised to}} write to me," [...] he said, [...] "and he has not written. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> means; I {{know what you have}} done to offend your father. My nephew has asked you to marry him for the second time. And for the second time you have refused." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lord Almighty save use, I doa knoa how {{she done}} it at all, at all. She must ha fell agin the stoave. It's the dhrink, dhrink, dhrink, that {{brought her to}} it. It's little <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> wairy bottle o brandy would do to her, or sorra bit o me would ha got it." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{stepped back}} and leaned against my bed with a level, quiet glance. I sat on the couch. We {{had nothing to say}} to each other. Over our heads the officer of the watch moved here and there. Then I heard him move quickly. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> meant. He was making for the companion; and {{presently}} his voice was outside my door.|$|R
6000|$|... "Shall I {{tell you}} what {{happened}} to me when I went home to-day?" [...] she said. [...] "I found my maid waiting in the hall--with everything that belongs to me, packed up for my departure. The girl explained that she had been forced to obey my father's positive orders. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> meant--I had to leave the house, and find a place to live in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hang me," [...] said Edward to himself, [...] "if she has {{not taken}} up with that confounded old {{military}} frump. Painting together! Ah, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> means. Well, I should have thought {{that if there was}} one man more than another whom she would have disliked, it would have been that battered-looking Colonel." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. 'Twas a dark dawn," [...] said Mrs. Oliver. [...] "Even when I {{opened the}} door, so late as I was, you couldn't have told poor men from gentlemen, or John from a reasonable-sized object. And I don't think maister's slept at all well to-night. He's anxious about his daughter; and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> is, for I've cried bucketfuls for my own." ...|$|E
6000|$|Anne {{dropped the}} paper on her lap without looking up. At the same moment Hester Dethridge's slate was passed stealthily between her eyes and the note--with these words traced on it. [...] "His mother is coming to-day. His brother has been telegraphed from Scotland. He was drunk last night. He's {{drinking}} again. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> means. Look out, missus--look out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They smiled. <b>I</b> shall <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> smile means some day. They don't waste their smiles. D'you {{see that}} track by Gale Anstey?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite enough. <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> {{has had to}} do with it. Miss Mavis, so far as I've noticed, hasn't been above today." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Lord Theign, <b>I</b> only <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> {{young man}} puts it at." [...] And {{then as the}} others waited, [...] "Ten thousand," [...] said Mr. Bender.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I said I {{would learn}} to bear,' said she to herself, 'or I shall never be fit for him. Yes, I will, {{even though it is}} the {{thinking}} he is unhappy. He said I must be his Verena; <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> means; I ought not to be uneasy, for he will bear it beautifully, and say he is glad of it afterwards. And I will try not to seem cross to Philip.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Haven't {{you noticed}} that she often doubles her thumb under her fingers--folds her fist across it--so--especially when anybody talks about {{anything}} alarming? If the conversation happens to turn on jungle fever, or any subject like that, down goes her thumb instantly, and she clasps her fist over it with a convulsive squeeze. At the same time, too, her face twitches. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> trick means. She's horribly afraid of tropical diseases, though she never says so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> look means," [...] said Thomas. [...] "You're wrong. Not another drop. But there's a {{guy that}} was {{standing}} next to me in the bed line over there that's in bad shape. He's the right kind, and he's got wives or kids or something, and he's on the sick list. No booze. If you could dig up half a dollar for him so he could get a decent bed I'd like it." ...|$|E
5000|$|Former manager Dick Williams, who {{had been}} {{inducted}} into the Hall earlier in the year, noted, [...] "It's not our job to vote someone in", and added, [...] "It's our job to consider the candidates." [...] Noting his support {{for some of the}} candidates, he stated, [...] "I thought Kaat would get in. I voted for him. And I think Joe Torre will, too, when he's done managing. I missed quite a few times before I got in. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that's</b> like." ...|$|R
60|$|My {{thoughts}} were disturbed by a crying of sea-birds hurrying towards some black object {{that had been}} stranded by the waves on the beach near the enclosure. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> object was, but I had not the heart {{to go back and}} drive them off. I began walking along the beach in the opposite direction, designing to come round the eastward corner of the island and so approach the ravine of the huts, without traversing the possible ambuscades of the thickets.|$|R
60|$|Now {{there was}} a new and sudden noise of heavy objects falling upon the roof, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> meant: my chimney had been {{wrenched}} from its foundations, and the upper part of it had now toppled over. I could hear, through the storm, the bricks banging and sliding upon the slanting roof. Continuous sounds of cracking and snapping came to me through the closed front windows, and these were caused, I supposed, by the destruction of the stakes of my vines as the heavy house moved over them.|$|R
