2500|$|The slave revolt in {{the largest}} Caribbean French colony of Saint-Domingue in 1791 was the {{beginning}} of what became the Haitian Revolution led by formerly enslaved people like Georges Biassou, Toussaint Louverture, and Jean-Jacques Dessalines. The rebellion swept through the north of the colony, and with it came freedom to thousands of enslaved blacks, but also violence and death. In 1793, French Civil Commissioners in St. Domingue and abolitionists, Léger-Félicité Sonthonax and Étienne Polverel, issued the first emancipation proclamation of the modern world (Decree of 16 Pluviôse An II). The Convention had sent them to safeguard the allegiance of the population to revolutionary France. [...] The proclamation resulted in a crucial military strategy as it gradually brought most of the black troops into the <b>French</b> <b>fold</b> and kept the colony under the French flag for most of the conflict. The connection with France lasted until blacks and free people of colour formed L'armée indigène in 1802 to resist Napoleon's Expédition de Saint-Domingue. Victory over the French in the decisive battle of Battle of Vertières finally led to independence and the creation of present Haiti in 1804.|$|E

40|$|The term ‘becoming’ is a philosopher’s word, {{bringing}} {{with it a}} Heraclitian pedigree. Oft used it outlines, in simple terms, the idea of ongoing change. Within the context of Greig Burgoyne and Rossella Emanuele drawing work the term is apt, for {{it refers to the}} playful open-endedness of their work. An indication whose origin spring from the implicit understanding that drawing is produced by a point that moves. White Noise therefore documents a moment in time when two artists met in an empty gallery space in London to ask and perform the question 'what is drawing?' White Noise includes an essay by the drawing theorist Joe Graham.

At Dresden, 26 August 1813, he was successful taking command from the wounded Major General v. Frierenberger. In Leipzig, 16 October 1813, Feldm. Director-Lieut. Reisner gave direction to Langerau of the Center and the left wing batteries, united at two points, and silenced the enemy guns. On 18 October Langerau {{was the first to}} pursue the withdrawal of the enemy from the Wachau Valley. Langerau commanded artillery in battles near Hochheim (on 9 November 1813). His service as Quartermaster-General of the Grand Army of Bohemia, in 1814, and of the Rhine Army, in 1815, under Schwarzenberg, won him universal recognition. Joseph Radetzky von Radetz served under him in 1814.|$|E

50|$|The {{first team}} to be {{entered into the}} Super League were Paris Saint-Germain in 1996 who played on the opening night of Super League against Sheffield Eagles in Paris. However the <b>French</b> {{franchise}} <b>folded</b> in 1997 after only two seasons competing in Super League. The only team playing outside the heartlands of Yorkshire and Lancashire now was the London Broncos. A new franchise, Gateshead Thunder were chosen to replace PSG in 1999 and had a successful first season finishing 6th, just outside the playoffs. Gateshead left the league after one season to merge with Hull Sharks after just one season. In 2000 a new Gateshead Thunder was formed and were accepted into the National League 2 and were promoted in 2008 but relegated the next season.

During her brief year in Baltimore, Seton would pay rent totaling at $250.00. Upon her arrival to the home, Elizabeth Seton was more than pleased with the house. In fact, she penned {{a letter to a}} friend, Julia Scott, {{describing}} it as a “‘neat, delightful mansion, entirely new...in the new <b>French</b> style of <b>folding</b> windows and recesses.’” Despite the fact that Elizabeth Seton only inhabited the home for a year, a long-lasting bond between the two was formed.|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} a teaching experience {{that took place}} in November 2007 in collaboration with groups of teachers and students of the schools of architecture of Udine and Lyon, held at the Grands Ateliers di Villefontaine (Lyon). The day of the encounter saw the revival of one of the studio seminars of the Design and Construction Lab of the Architectural Technology degree course at the University of Udine (director: prof. arch. Mauro Bertagnin) : an origami workshop which centered on experimentation, on the one hand, with the realization of large scale origami as a means of acquiring concepts of space, strength of form, structural feasibility and the effectiveness of constraints, and on the other hand, on a comparison with pliage, the <b>French</b> art of <b>folding,</b> as experimented with at the school of architecture in Lyon...|$|R
50|$|The {{second step}} is the {{lamination}} process. Lamination {{is necessary to}} produce multilayered dough with alternating layers of predough and fat. Generally, there are two methods for folding fat into dough: the English method and the French method. In the English method, one fold results in two fat layers and three dough layers. After spreading out predough, roll-in fat is ﬂattened to a similar thickness as the predough and spread over two-thirds of {{the surface of the}} laminated predough. The exposed third of predough is then folded over half of the roll-in fat, while the other end (one predough and one fat layer) is folded on top. In the <b>French</b> method, one <b>fold</b> results in one fat layer and two dough layers. After spreading out the predough and putting a layer of roll-in fat over the center surface of the dough, the corners of the predough are folded toward the middle of the fat. Croissant dough is typically laminated until 16-50 fat layers are obtained. The optimal number of layers can be determined by balancing certain crumb properties with speciﬁc volume. On one hand, a low number of layers yields large speciﬁc heights as well as irregular crumb structure with large voids. On the other hand, a large number of relatively thin layers leads to interconnections between different dough layers as well as less dough lift.|$|R
