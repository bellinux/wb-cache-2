5|$|Carbon fibre is {{actually}} a carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer, and is a strong, light-weight material used {{in a number of}} applications, including sporting goods like baseball bats, car parts, helmets, sailboats, bicycles and other equipment where rigidity and high strength-to-weight ratio is important. The polymer used for this equipment is normally epoxy, but other polymers are also used, depending on the application, and other reinforcing fibres may also be included. In the blade manufacturing process, sheets of impregnated material are cut into square sheets and pressed onto a form to produce the final shape. From 30 to 90 sheets may be layered, depending on the expected weight of the athlete, and the mold is then autoclaved to fuse the sheets into a solid plate. This method reduces air bubbles that can cause breaks. Once the result is cooled, it is cut into the shape of the blades. The finished blade <b>is</b> <b>bolted</b> to a carbon fibre socket that is an intimate fit to each of Pistorius' legs. These are custom made and make up the bulk of the total cost, along with the assessment and setting up of the finished prostheses. Each limb costs between $15–18,000 USD.|$|E
25|$|The engine {{mounting}} was substantially different. Instead of being suspended from an alloy cradle {{as on the}} Mark A and B, the engine now sat in a steel cradle bolted to a steeply inclined steel tube that pivoted directly behind the engine through an alloy steering head bracket. This bracket, holding the engine and front wheel unit <b>is</b> <b>bolted</b> to a cast alloy bulkhead which forms a major structural component of the car. The {{engine mounting}} {{was said to have}} been a regular source of failures on both the Mark A and the Mark B, and this new design was again the work of Granville Bradshaw.|$|E
25|$|Mole ploughs {{are usually}} trailed and pulled by a crawler tractor, but lighter models {{for use on}} the three-point linkage of {{powerful}} four-wheel drive tractors are also made. A mole plough {{has a very strong}} frame which slides along the ground when the machine is in work. A heavy leg, similar to a subsoiler leg, is attached to the frame and a circular section share with a larger diameter expander on a flexible link <b>is</b> <b>bolted</b> to the leg. The bullet shaped share forms a tunnel, about 75mm diameter, in the soil and the expander presses the soil outwards to form a long-lasting drainage channel.|$|E

500|$|Each {{engine is}} {{installed}} with a gimbal bearing, a universal {{ball and socket}} joint which <b>is</b> <b>bolted</b> to the launch vehicle by its upper flange and to the engine by its lower flange. It represents the thrust interface between the engine and the launch vehicle, supporting [...] of engine weight and withstanding over [...] of thrust. As well as providing a means to attach the engine to the launch vehicle, the gimbal bearing allows the engine to be pivoted (or [...] "gimballed") around two axes of freedom with a range of ±10.5°. This motion allows the engine's thrust vector to be altered, thus steering the vehicle into the correct orientation. The bearing assembly is approximately , has a mass of , and is made of titanium alloy.|$|E
500|$|An {{academician}} from Taiyuan, {{referred to}} {{only by his}} surname Wang, chances upon a homeless girl who claims to be an ill-treated concubine. Noting her beauty, as well as feeling pity for her, Wang agrees to let her stay at his residence temporarily. They make love at his study, unbeknownst to anybody else. A few days afterwards, Wang's spouse, Chen, discovers their affair and is unhappy with the arrangement, but fails at changing his mind. At the marketplace, a Taoist priest informs Wang {{that he has been}} possessed by an evil spirit. Wang dismisses this with incredulity. He returns home but finds the gates locked. Nevertheless, he manages to find a way into the courtyard and notices that the front door <b>is</b> <b>bolted</b> too. Peeking through the window, Wang makes a startling discovery − the girl is actually a [...] "green-faced monster, a ghoul with great jagged teeth like a saw."

500|$|Yeezus {{received}} widespread acclaim from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 84, based on 46 reviews. In The Guardian, lead critic Alexis Petridis found it [...] "noisy, gripping, maddening, potent", while Helen Brown from The Daily Telegraph {{said it was}} [...] "the most exciting album" [...] she had heard in some time. Jon Dolan from Rolling Stone called it a [...] "brilliant, obsessive-compulsive career auto-correct" [...] that made other abrasive records by [...] "mad geniuses", such as In Utero by Nirvana and Radiohead's Kid A, seem tame by comparison. Pitchfork critic Ryan Dombal viewed it as a [...] "razor-sharpened take" [...] on West's fourth album, 808s & Heartbreak, concluding that [...] "cohesion and bold intent are at a premium on Yeezus, {{perhaps more than any}} other Kanye album. Each fluorescent strike of noise, incongruous tempo flip, and warped vocal <b>is</b> <b>bolted</b> into its right place across the album's fast 40 minutes." [...] Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times felt it was his most ambitious piece of music yet, and Evan Rytlewski from The A.V.

2500|$|Power {{take-off}} (PTO) was {{integral to}} the Land Rover concept from 1948, enabling farm machinery and many other items to be run with the vehicle stationary. Maurice Wilks' original instruction was [...] "...to have power take-offs everywhere!" [...] The 1949 report by British National Institute of Agricultural Engineering and Scottish Machinery Testing Station contained this description: [...] "the power take-off is driven through a Hardy Spicer propeller shaft from the main gearbox output and two interchangeable pinions giving two ratios. The PTO gearbox casing <b>is</b> <b>bolted</b> to the rear chassis cross-member and an [...] belt pulley driven from the PTO shaft through two bevel gears can be bolted to the PTO gearbox casing."

2500|$|The {{landside}} is {{the flat}} plate which presses against and transmits the lateral {{thrust of the}} plough bottom to the furrow wall. It helps to resist the side pressure exerted by the furrow slice on the mouldboard. It also helps in stabilizing the plough while it is in operations. The rear bottom end of the landslide, which rubs against the furrow sole, is known as heel [...] A heel iron <b>is</b> <b>bolted</b> {{to the end of}} the rear of the landside and helps to carry the back of the plough. The landside and share are arranged to give a ‘'lead” towards the unploughed land, thus helping to maintain the correct furrow width. The landside is usually made of solid medium carbon steel, and is very short except on the rear bottom of the plow. The heel or rear end of the rear landside may be subject to excessive wear if the rear wheel is out of adjustment, therefore, a chilled iron heel piece is frequently used. This heel is inexpensive and can be easily replaced. The land side is fastened to the frog with the help of plough bolts.|$|E
2500|$|Bohr's {{response}} was to illustrate Einstein's idea more clearly using the diagram in Figure C. (Figure C shows a fixed screen S1 that <b>is</b> <b>bolted</b> down. Then try to imagine one that can slide up or down along a rod instead of a fixed bolt.) Bohr observes that extremely precise knowledge of any (potential) vertical motion of the screen is an essential presupposition in Einstein's argument. In fact, if its velocity in the direction X before {{the passage of the}} particle is not known with a precision substantially greater than that induced by the recoil (that is, if it were already moving vertically with an unknown and greater velocity than that which it derives {{as a consequence of the}} contact with the particle), then the determination of its motion after the passage of the particle would not give the information we seek. However, Bohr continues, an extremely precise determination of the velocity of the screen, when one applies the principle of indeterminacy, implies an inevitable imprecision of its position in the directionX. [...] Before the process even begins, the screen would therefore occupy an indeterminate position at least to a certain extent (defined by the formalism). Now consider, for example, the point d in figure A, where the interference is destructive. It is obvious that any displacement of the first screen would make the lengths of the two paths, a–b–d and a–c–d, different from those indicated in the figure. If the difference between the two paths varies by half a wavelength, at point d there will be constructive rather than destructive interference. [...] The ideal experiment must average over all the possible positions of the screen S1, and, for every position, there corresponds, for a certain fixed point F, a different type of interference, from the perfectly destructive to the perfectly constructive. The effect of this averaging is that the pattern of interference on the screen F will be uniformly grey. Once more, our attempt to evidence the corpuscular aspects in S2 has destroyed the possibility of interference in F, which depends crucially on the wave aspects.|$|E
