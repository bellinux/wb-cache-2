Two singles, Hitomi no Kakera and <b>Inside</b> <b>Your</b> Heart, {{were published in the}} same year by FictionJunction Yuuka, each containing an opening/ending theme and one insert song, as well as their respective karaoke versions.|$|E
25|$|Still <b>Inside</b> <b>Your</b> Mind, {{the first}} {{track of the}} album, was {{released}} in June 2009. It starts with an electropop sound. In the music video Gomo {{is looking at the}} sea and starts to swim. During the chorus, he dives in and rain begins to fall. Come Say You Love Me, another of the songs on the album has a music video filmed in Sao Miguel Island, Azores.|$|E
500|$|Fat Wreck Chords {{released}} The Unraveling on April 24, 2001, in the United States on CD and LP formats; {{the original}} 2001 CD pressing is currently out of print. It {{failed to reach}} any major music chart, and did not produce a single. Since the album's release, some of its songs have been featured in compilation albums and other media. An acoustic rendition of [...] "Everchanging" [...] was included on the Warped Tour 2006 Tour Compilation and the European track listing of the 2007 extended play This Is Noise. [...] "The Art of Losing" [...] and [...] "My Life <b>Inside</b> <b>Your</b> Heart" [...] were {{to be used in}} the unreleased 2001 video game Propeller Arena.|$|E
50|$|<b>Inside</b> <b>Yours</b> is {{the debut}} studio album by the American grunge band Gruntruck. It was {{released}} in 1990 by eMpTy Records and reissued in 1991 by Roadrunner Records with two bonus tracks.|$|R

500|$|Crystal Bell of Billboard {{gave the}} song a {{generally}} positive review stating [...] "much {{as he did}} on his debut single, [...] "One Time," [...] Bieber {{makes a strong case}} for why he's the next pop heartthrob. 'I'm gonna put you first, I'll show you what you're worth/If you let me <b>inside</b> <b>your</b> world,' he sings. The stump speech is hard to resist, especially when set to an arrangement that follows the lineage of hit midtempo ballads [...] "With You", and [...] "Irreplaceable". Although the lyrics are generic, Bieber's smooth delivery is right on point, and his tender vocals blend well with the song's easy-flowing beat." [...] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times called the song along with [...] "Down to Earth", [...] "uncomplicatedly beautiful and earnest." [...] Andy Kellman of Allmusic listed the song as one of his recommended tracks from the album.|$|E
500|$|Bryant {{identified}} [...] "Son of Three" [...] as {{an example}} of [...] "when the Breeders set out to rock", noting [...] "the chugging guitars and stomping drums." [...] The Breeders re-recorded [...] "Son of Three" [...] in July 2002 for its release as Title TKs third single; this version is faster than the album track, and reflects the speed they were playing the song in concert that year. The lyrics of both [...] "Son of Three" [...] and [...] "The She" [...] suggest extended road trips with unknown outcomes. The album's next song, [...] "Put on a Side", has a distinctive bassline and a cramped, repressive feel. Berger wrote that Kim Deal's [...] "voice grinds sweetly, weariedly, sloppily <b>inside</b> <b>your</b> brain," [...] as she repeats twelve words {{over the course of the}} song: [...] "Better I better I stayed up / Better mono, put on a side." ...|$|E
500|$|They and {{the episode}} writers {{developed}} a storyline {{in which a}} victim's childhood experimentation, when they were injected with something, was now [...] "coming back to haunt them." [...] Whitman noted that the concept, like others in the show, was based on real scientific knowledge, [...] "The notion is, {{some kind of a}} medical treatment that they were given allowed their brain to command vibrations that would take place. It really is true that essentially what heat is is vibrations of atoms, so if your brain can cause some kind of vibration to take place, eventually you could create enough heat to even create a flame." [...] Pinkner added, [...] "And if you haven't yet mastered pyrokinesis and the ability to excite molecules that are outside your body, well then you're going to excite the ones <b>inside</b> <b>your</b> body and you're going to blow up, sadly." ...|$|E

500|$|The song's exhortation to [...] "Get back {{to where}} you should be" [...] was partly {{appropriated}} by McCartney in his lyrics to [...] "Get Back", which the Beatles recorded in January 1969. Both sides of Lomax's single were included on his only album for Apple, Is This What You Want?, released in March 1969. The album similarly failed to achieve commercial success, a result that perplexed the Beatles, who continued to believe in his talents. Due to the song's strong association with the Beatles and Eric Clapton, [...] "Sour Milk Sea" [...] retained a degree of renown among rock music fans; Danny Eccleston of Mojo magazine later {{described it as a}} [...] "cult rendering". In 1970, Sour Milk Sea, one of singer Freddie Mercury's pre-Queen bands, was named after the track. In June the following year, Apple re-released [...] "Sour Milk Sea" [...] with [...] "Fall <b>Inside</b> <b>Your</b> Eyes" [...] on the B-side, but this single also failed to chart.|$|E
500|$|Musically, The Unraveling is {{primarily}} rooted in melodic hardcore, with influences of punk rock and hardcore punk. Shawn Merrill of Exclaim! compared the album to works by other punk rock bands like Agnostic Front, Bad Religion, Gorilla Biscuits, and Minor Threat. The Unraveling {{begins with a}} quote by actor and musician Jack Black asking the listener if they [...] "are ready to rock", which is taken from the 1996 film The Cable Guy. It then transitions into the first track [...] "Alive and Well", a fast-paced song that combines screaming vocals with melodies in the chorus. Davey Boy of Sputnikmusic considers the second track, [...] "My Life <b>Inside</b> <b>Your</b> Heart", {{to be the most}} accessible song on the album, while [...] "Great Awakening" [...] has a [...] "frantic pace" [...] with a hardcore sound. The next song [...] "Six Ways 'Til Sunday" [...] is more inspired by punk rock, with a long closing group chant.|$|E
500|$|The {{track is}} a slow-paced R ballad with {{elements}} of pop music, that runs for {{a length of}} three minutes and 47 seconds. Throughout the song, Usher makes use of his falsetto range, to which Billboard Erika Ramirez described as [...] "soulful". Chuck Arnold of People complimented Usher's falsetto on both [...] "Dive" [...] and lead single [...] "Climax", adding that the songs show"that he's a [...] "better singer than ever". Matt Cibula of PopMatters wrote that [...] "Dive" [...] contains a triple entendre in its lyrics: seemingly singing about diving or oral sex, [...] "only to realize that what he's really discussing" [...] is commitment to a relationship. Trent Fitzgerald of PopCrush perceived that the song's lyrics [...] "metaphorically compares love to the crashing waters of the ocean". Carrie Battan of Pitchfork interpreted the lyrics as [...] "explicit" [...] which might [...] "make you cringe if they'd come from of anyone else" [...] in the line: [...] "It's raining <b>inside</b> <b>your</b> bed/ No parts are dry/ Lovin' made you so wet/ Your Legs/ Your thighs".|$|E

500|$|... "Badlaa" [...] {{was written}} by John Shiban and {{inspired}} by stories of Indian fakirs. In fact, the episode's title means [...] "to retort" [...] or [...] "to revenge" [...] in Urdu. Further inspiration came [...] "from {{a little bit of}} desperation" [...] according to Shiban. He later recalled that he was walking through the Vancouver airport and suddenly had the thought, [...] "What if someone who {{came up to me and}} asked me for money was actually a bad guy." [...] Shiban later noted that his early drafts of the episode featured the antagonist with a different power. He explained, [...] "My original idea was a beggar with no legs who can actually shrink himself and climb <b>inside</b> <b>your</b> ear, and Chris Carter–and this is why he's Chris Carter–said 'No, no, no! I know what's even better.'" [...] Shiban later said that [...] "... one thing about this episode that I'm sort of proud is that people often have told me that it is the most disgusting thought that they ever had, that this little man would actually enter your body and travel around inside you." ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Diamonds" [...] is a {{departure}} from Rihanna's recurring themes of unhealthy relationships on her other songs, and contains a prominent concept of love. The first verse introduces the song's concept: [...] "Find light in the beautiful sea / I choose to be happy / You and I, you and I / We're like diamonds in the sky." [...] The hook continues this metaphor: [...] "So shine bright, tonight, you and I / We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky / Eye to eye, so alive." [...] According to Glenn Yoder of The Boston Globe, the song shows Rihanna differently than how she is viewed by the public because of lyrics such as [...] "I choose to be happy" [...] and [...] "We're like diamonds in the sky". James Montgomery of MTV News commented that she embraces the positivity and fulfillment of a realized relationship, particularly with the line [...] "When you hold me, I'm alive", and admits [...] "I knew that we'd become one right away". Lindsay DiMattina of Hollywood.com interpreted that Rihanna is crying out for her lover when she sings lines such as, [...] "When you hold me, I'm alive," [...] and [...] "At first sight I felt the energy of sun rays / I saw the life <b>inside</b> <b>your</b> eyes." [...] The Herald Sun asserted that the lyrics were most likely inspired by Rihanna's private life.|$|E
500|$|By April 2013, filming was {{scheduled}} to begin in early 2014 at Shepperton Studios in England. At the Hollywood premiere of Iron Man 3, Whedon {{said that he had}} completed a draft of the script, started the storyboard process, and met with actors. Whedon also mentioned that he wrote with Downey in mind and included a [...] "brother/sister act" [...] from the comic books, later confirming that he was referring to Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch. Whedon explained his rationale for including the characters in the film saying, [...] "their powers are very visually interesting. One of the problems I had on the first one was everybody basically had punchy powers … 's got super speed. [...] can weave spells and a little telekinesis, get <b>inside</b> <b>your</b> head. There's good stuff that they can do that will help sort of keep it fresh," [...] though cautioned he was not throwing in more characters for the sake of doing that. Whedon stated that the twins allowed him to add more conflict: [...] "They don't like America, and they don't like the Avengers… The Avengers are like a world power, and not everybody's on board with the Avengers coming in and starting fights, even in the name of justice. So you need that dissenting voice, and you need to understand it and sympathize with it." [...] Because Marvel Studios shares the film rights to Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch with 20th Century Fox and had to avoid conflict with Fox's X-Men films, Whedon introduced two important characters into the Marvel Cinematic Universe completely on his terms for the first time, which allowed him to connect their origin stories to the universe that they created and avoid the concept of mutants. Whedon relished at the storytelling opportunities by introducing a character with telepathic powers, explaining, [...] "it meant we could spend a little time inside the Avengers' heads—either their past or their impressions of what's going on, or their fears, or all of the above." [...] By May, Downey had entered negotiations to extend his contract with Marvel Studios and reprise his role as Iron Man in the film. A month later, Downey signed on to return for the then-untitled Avengers sequel, as well as a third Avengers film.|$|E

2500|$|Richie Unterberger of AllMusic {{offers a}} less {{favourable}} opinion of Is This What You Want?, describing Lomax as [...] "a passable but unarresting singer and songwriter". Unterberger identifies the best moments as the [...] "Beatlesque" [...] songs [...] "Is This What You Want?" [...] and the [...] "uncommonly tender" [...] "Fall <b>Inside</b> <b>Your</b> Eyes". Discussing the 2004 reissue in Record Collector, Terry Staunton described Lomax's style as [...] " [...] the same seam as Joe Cocker, albeit {{with a voice}} neither as distinctive or as powerful" [...] and singled out the [...] "gentle balladry" [...] of [...] "Fall <b>Inside</b> <b>Your</b> Eyes" [...] and [...] "Baby You're A Lover" [...] as highlights. Staunton concluded that Lomax's only Apple album was [...] "a fairly pleasing blue-eyed soul set, which is probably more revered {{today than it was}} 35 years ago". Writing in the Encyclopedia of Popular Music, Colin Larkin says that next to the list of celebrated contributors, Lomax's [...] "stylish compositions and superb voice were equal to such esteemed company".|$|E
2500|$|The {{lyrics of}} the song {{introduce}} the protagonist of The Downward Spiral; who ominously calls himself [...] "the voice <b>inside</b> <b>your</b> head." [...] He represents the urges of sexuality, powers of addiction, and inescapable feelings of guilt and fear. He appears to be violent, even sociopathic, at certain points (I am the bullet in the gun"), but also claims to represent the purposes of religion, and the ultimate, unattainable goal of all human desire.|$|E

2500|$|In the United States, {{where the}} band had found success with Laid, reviews for Wah Wah were more favourable, despite the {{commercial}} {{failure of the}} album in the country. Dimitri Ehrlich of Entertainment Weekly graded the album [...] "B+", saying the album shows [...] "James at its most inspired and unpredictable" [...] and called the album [...] "a joyride of a record." [...] The Harvard Crimson said [...] "Wah Wah is not ear candy, like much of Laid; it's meant to get <b>inside</b> <b>your</b> head, {{and that may be}} a bit more than you're in the market for when you slap down your money at HMV."

2500|$|The soundtrack was {{released}} on LP and cassette {{in the same year}} as the film (1985) by Saturn Records; it contained 6 tracks, all of which was composed and performed by John Harrison. The vocals came from Sputzy Sparacino who was the lead singer of Modern Man and Gospel Singer, Delilah on the tracks [...] "If Tomorrow Comes" [...] and [...] "The World <b>Inside</b> <b>Your</b> Eyes". The album was re-issued in 2002 by Numenorean Records as a limited edition CD. [...] The new edition was limited to 3000 copies and contained the original album plus five additional tracks from the music and effects reel (the only surviving recording of the film score).
