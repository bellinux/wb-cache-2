Later in the video each member of the band is seen dancing in front of the flags of selected countries that are all participating in the Eurovision Song Contest 2007, in addition to the flag of the European Union.|$|E
25|$|She is an {{extremely}} private person who keeps her thoughts and feelings to herself and hates when someone tries to understand her, which {{is thought to be}} why Edward is unable to hear her thoughts. She is also known to be incredibly stubborn with her self, because of her determination to become a vampire in order to be with Edward forever. She is also said to possess poor acting skills. Ironically, she demonstrates good acting ability in Twilight when she makes her father believe that she has dumped Edward and is leaving Forks. She is a very shy and timid girl with a stiff uptight position, habit of biting <b>her</b> <b>lip,</b> which she shares with Kristen Stewart. Bella knits together her eyebrows when feeling strong emotions such as anxiety. As a human, Bella easily fainted at the sight or smell of blood, which she said smells like rust and salt in Twilight, though it changes after she became a vampire. Bella is also shown in Breaking Dawn, to have a good mood climate, and is able to run away from the smell of human blood when she goes on her first hunting trip as a vampire.|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} heavily derided by critics. Jason Lipshutz of Billboard panned it as [...] "even more {{abhorrent}} than the song." [...] While acknowledging that the album's previous videos were [...] "excellent", {{he pointed out}} that the [...] "Hello Kitty" [...] video [...] "tries to do nothing. Its laziness is demonstrated in the first 21 seconds, during which Lavigne holds a plush stack of cupcakes, shakes her hips, stares at the cupcakes, bounces her shoulders, and then, when she sings the line 'Someone chuck a cupcake at me'... tosses the fake cupcakes at the camera, <b>her</b> <b>lip</b> movement not matching up to the backing track whatsoever." [...] Alexa Camp of Slant Magazine called it [...] "truly eyebrow-raising, taking cultural mis-appropriation to cringe-inducing levels." [...] The Independent suggested that [...] "'Hello Kitty' will make your eyes and ears bleed", while Jezebel wrote: [...] "It looks like what would happen if someone scraped off the diseased underbelly of American pop culture from 2004-2010 and sprinkled it generously over a festering pile of garbage." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2015, Vidya reteamed with Hashmi in the Mohit Suri-directed romantic drama Hamari Adhuri Kahani. Penned by Mahesh Bhatt, {{the film}} {{tells the story}} of Vasudha, a single mother trapped in an abusive marriage, who has an extra-marital affair. Shubha Shetty-Saha of Mid Day reviewed, [...] "Vidya Balan, a fine actress with {{thousand}} emotions fleeting across her lovely face, has shown us what she's capable of in her earlier movies. But here, saddled with a boring, outdated, weepy character, there was nothing much even she could do". Vidya next took {{on the part of a}} police officer in Te3n (2016), a thriller inspired by the 2013 South Korean film Montage, co-starring Amitabh Bachchan and Nawazuddin Siddiqui. She was attracted to the idea of playing a [...] "no-nonsense police inspector who commands much respect" [...] and was particularly drawn to her character's [...] "silent aggression". NDTV's Saibal Chatterjee criticised the decision to bill Vidya's pivotal role as a special appearance and noted how much her presence benefited the film. Rajeev Masand was critical of the film's predictable denouement, but wrote that Vidya [...] "is reliably solid each time she’s on screen, raising her brow, curling <b>her</b> <b>lip</b> to effectively communicate more than words can". She then portrayed the actress Geeta Bali in multiple songs for Ekk Albela, a Marathi language biopic of the actor-director Bhagwan Dada.|$|E
500|$|TV critic Nancy Banks-Smith {{praised the}} {{character}} in 2008, calling Becky [...] "the strongest new character since Raquel (Watts) of blessed memory", while The Daily Mirror Beth Neil called Becky Coronation Street [...] "most outrageous character", {{as well as}} [...] "one of the soap's most popular characters". Kelly credited the producers' decision to pair her character with Roy and Hayley Cropper as the moment public support for Becky rose, stating: [...] "The Croppers were the making of Becky, and without them I actually don't think Becky would {{still be in the}} show. The Croppers, especially Roy, were the thing that really turned public opinion [...] around to being positive." [...] Grace Dent of The Guardian commented on Becky's wedding describing her appearance as: [...] " [...] Oil-stained pink princess frock carrying a two litre bottle of street-drinker fuel, shouting football chants, with the words eruditely swapped to honour the groom. Becky's beehive lurched like a detonated high rise, <b>her</b> <b>lip</b> colour swept westward on to her earlobe, a Regal King Size blazed in her gob." [...] With their wedding ruined, Dent commented that although it was karma, they didn't deserve it because [...] "Viewers want Steve and Becky to be together". Telecommunication company Orange state that Becky is well known for [...] "her love of cheap cider and Regal King Size's".|$|E
500|$|... "Beauty Mark" [...] is an ode to Wainwright's mother, {{the title}} {{referring}} to the mole above <b>her</b> <b>lip.</b> The song {{is one of the}} few up-tempo tracks on the album and contains multiple keyboard overdubs by Brion. Chris Yurkiw of the Montreal Mirror considered the track to be the most moving love song on the album, with an [...] "overt and open-hearted" [...] reference to his homosexuality: [...] "I may not be so manly, but still I know you love me." [...] Wainwright's Summer Stage performance of [...] "Beauty Mark" [...] appears on his 2005 DVD All I Want. In [...] "Barcelona", Wainwright recalls a love affair that took place in the city of the same name. The song is loosely about AIDS and contains the Italian language lyric [...] "Fuggi, regal fantasima", taken from Giuseppe Verdi's opera Macbeth. According to Wainwright, the line appears in a scene when [...] "Macbeth is going mad and sees the ghost, and in [...] mind the ghost was AIDS." [...] "Matinee Idol" [...] is about the rise and fall of an entertainment figure, inspired by the death of actor River Phoenix. According to Greenwald, the musical song has a [...] "1920s, cabaret musical feel". [...] "Damned Ladies" [...] is a slow ballad about the [...] "beloved yet doomed ladies of opera". Wainwright said the following of [...] "Damned Ladies", which contains references to nine opera heroines: [...] "In the song, I lament how these women are constantly dying brutal deaths, which I can see coming but cannot stop. It gets me every time." [...] Greenwald described [...] "Sally Ann" [...] as a 1920s love ballad of [...] "lost love and emotional regret". The melody in [...] "Imaginary Love", the album's closing track, contains sixth and major seventh chords.|$|E

500|$|David Hill, 18, {{was asked}} to [...] "sit in" [...] at the house, and while there heard Dudson shout [...] "Shut up, you slag!" [...] in the back room. When he asked what was going on, Leigh had shown him Capper. He said: [...] "She {{had a sort of}} cloth over her face, from just above the eyebrows and {{covering}} her nose. She had a bit of dried blood on <b>her</b> <b>lip.</b> She had no hair." [...] Hill also said he had heard them talking about [...] "dentistry work. It was something about pulling her teeth out with a pair of pliers." [...] Later, he was left alone in the house with Capper, who pleaded with him to untie her. He said: [...] "She asked me if I could help but I told her I couldn't. I asked her who she was. She said her name was Suzanne. She asked me if I could untie her. I said I couldn't do anything." [...] He later claimed that he was too afraid of Leigh to intervene or raise the alarm, saying: [...] "I thought they would batter me. If I'd said [...] they'd all have got me, wouldn't they? I didn't know what to do. I was too shocked to do anything." [...] While Capper was being held in the house, Leigh and Dudson met up with her sister's fiance Paul Barlow to help him repair his car. Barlow said: [...] "They could have told me there and then. The door would have been kicked down and I would have got Suzanne out. I did not think they were capable of such savagery. Now all I want is ten minutes with them in a back room." ...|$|E
500|$|Bell {{said that}} at first Anna was written plainer and more general. [...] "In {{the first draft of}} the script she was written more, in my opinion, prissy. She was kind of {{specific}} and very girly," [...] which Bell didn't find appealing. She admitted that she had always {{wanted to be part of}} Disney animated feature, but she [...] "wanted to be a very specific type of princess", who [...] "was way more awkward than the normal princesses", not someone with too good postures or too well-spoken. As she was offered the role of Anna, she came up with a lot of suggestions for the directors. They were responsive and allowed the actress to mould the character the way she wanted, since they wanted the film to be truthful. Bell significantly made specific changes to Anna, including the infusion and incorporation of the actress' own personality to the character, [...] embodying a relatable heroine, which received full support from the directors. She called the scene where Anna first meets Hans is a [...] "typical Disney moment", as they come too close physically and find out that they both fall in love with each other. Bell wanted Anna's words to reflect what she herself would say in real life, which included some [...] "nonsensical rambling". [...] "I think I said, [...] "This is awkward. You're not awkward. Me, I'm awkward. You're gorgeous. Wait—what?" [...] Words just spill out of her mouth too quickly and she has to backtrack." [...] Bell continued. Or the whole scene where she wakes up in the beginning with saliva all over the face, Bell [...] "wanted her to also have hair in her mouth", which took inspiration from her own real life. [...] "Sometimes I wake up like that. Then you have hair in your mouth, and you start coughing. The animators totally got what I was trying to do. It's cool, and way more fun when stuff is realistic like that, instead of the perfection of waking up with mascara on." [...] Anna's snorting and tripping over also drew inspirations from Bell's real life. Bell's recording sessions were also videotaped to assist in animating the character, and animators took into considerations even subtle things like the actress' biting <b>her</b> <b>lip</b> a lot. According to director Jennifer Lee, Anna is a bit flawed.|$|E
500|$|A femme fatale, Kim {{was among}} several fictional {{characters}} and pop culture icons to debut towards the [...] "end of the 'Girl Power' era" [...] and third-wave feminism. Thus, some critics perceive the character {{as a combination}} of Buffy Summers from Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Sydney Bristow from Alias, and The Powerpuff Girls. As an animated series, Kim Possible was revolutionary for its diverse cast of strong female characters, namely Kim and Shego. Many of the character's typically [...] "girly" [...] belongings double as powerful weapons, namely <b>her</b> <b>lip</b> gloss and compact mirror. In his book Dangerous Curves: Action Heroines, Gender, Fetishism, and Popular Culture, author Jeffrey A. Brown believes that [...] "Kim may be the epitome of a Girl Power-derived heroine", while reinforcing [...] "that {{there is a lot}} to be learned from female elders." [...] Like Kim herself, her grandmother Nana Possible also fought crime when she was young, from whom Kim is believed to have inherited her abilities. Kim's entire family is very intelligent, and constantly reiterate the phrase [...] "anything is possible for a Possible". Therefore, the character is spared [...] "the burden of being the only brain on the show." [...] The character's relationship with her parents is atypically healthy for a teenager. Kim's father James [...] "views women as equals", and thus has a good relationship with Kim although he struggles to come to terms with the reality that she is growing up and dating. Her mother Ann is essentially a [...] "grown up" [...] version of Kim. At one point, Ann insists that Kim invite her on one of her missions as her Mother's Day present, and Kim also admits to being impressed by her mother's work as a brain surgeon. The Artifice observed that Kim and Shego are strikingly similar in appearance. Metacritc believes that Shego is essentially [...] "Kim's dark reflection"; both characters are smart, athletic and attractive with green eyes, but Shego chooses to use her powers for evil instead. Despite their bitter rivalry, Kim and Shego have mutual respect for each other to the point of which they occasionally work together when the situation demands it. According to Metacritic, Kim's [...] "fiery" [...] red hair symbolizes [...] "her attitude that is best summed up by the phrase, 'I can do anything.'" [...] The character is infamous for her puppy dog pout, which she often uses to get her way.|$|E
