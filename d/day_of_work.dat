She soon {{develops}} feelings for both of them, first believing that she loves Guy, but then – after a day out with him – realising that it is Mac she truly loves. At the same time, Martin begins {{to fall in love}} with her, and Angela becomes Caroline's lodger. Elsewhere in the hospital, Alan and Joanna try to hide their relationship from the rest of the staff, unsuccessfully. Then Joanna becomes attracted to Lyndon Jones (Paterson Joseph), the hospital's head of I.T., with Alan becoming jealous of Lyndon.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if implementation of an industrial ergonomics program would decrease the number of upper extremity cumulative trauma disorders, lost <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>work,</b> and insurance costs.

5|$|The Song {{government}} provided {{tax incentives}} to farmers who tilled lands {{along the edges}} of lakes, marshes, seas, and terraced mountain slopes. Farming was made possible in these difficult terrains due to improvements in damming techniques and using chain pumps to elevate water to higher irrigation planes. The 10th century introduction of early-ripening rice that could grow in varied climatic zones and topographic conditions allowed for a significantly large migration from the most productive lands that had been farmed for centuries into previously uninhabited areas in the surrounding hinterland of the Yangzi Valley and Southeast China, which experienced rapid development. The widespread cultivation of rice in China necessitated new trends of labor and agricultural techniques. An effective yield from rice paddies required careful transplanting of rows of rice seedlings, sufficient weeding, maintenance of water levels, and draining of fields for harvest. Planting and weeding often required a dirty <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>work,</b> since the farmers had to wade through the muddy water of the rice paddies on bare feet. For other crops, water buffalos were used as draft animals for ploughing and harrowing the fields, while properly aged and mixed compost and manure was constantly spread.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, York, Pennsylvania-based {{department}} store chain The Bon-Ton acquired the AM's chain, converting all outlets to The Bon-Ton. Later that year, on December 14, 17-year-old Cynthia Wiggins of Buffalo {{was struck by}} a dump truck while trying to get to her first <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> in the mall's food court from a NFTA Metro bus stop on Walden Avenue. The incident sparked allegations from Buffalo's African-American community that Pyramid did not want people from Buffalo's predominantly minority East Side to have easy access to the mall. In settling a wrongful death claim against Walden Galleria and NFTA Metro and to prevent a boycott of the mall, the bus stop was soon moved to a point inside the mall, where it remains today. Bonwit Teller closed off its upper level in 1996 as part of the chain's restructuring, with Old Navy soon opening in the store's former upper level. By the end of the year, Bonwit Teller had closed the rest of its store as well, with the lower level becoming the area's first Bed Bath & Beyond store in 1997. Also in 1996, sporting apparel retailer Finish Line opened what was then one of its largest stores, in the space vacated by Filene's Basement two years previous.|$|E
5|$|This {{concept of}} the double burden with married couples is a {{worldwide}} phenomenon. Throughout different cultures of the world, women spend more total hours in work than men do. In Japan, once married, they are still expected to be devoted wives and mothers who give all off their effort to the home, even after a full <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> Latin American women, now entering the work force in large numbers, still face what they call doble jornada, or double day's journey. Although in the Latin American culture, men are starting to interact more with the children and helping around the house more, the main domestic responsibilities still fall upon {{the women of the}} house. Sometimes women who are primary wage earners are still relegated to most of the domestic work. European men are more likely to play and interact with their children but not likely to participate fully in their daily care. They are more likely to help their wives at home, yet rarely do they tackle all domestic task equally. Men commonly fail to live up to their belief of equal sharing of domestic labor: they may believe in an equal workload in the house, but the inconvenience of taking on work done by their wives stops many from following through.|$|E

25|$|Paratha - A flat, layered bread {{made with}} ghee and {{generally}} cooked on a 'tava'. However, a 'tandoor' based version is also common in rural areas. Parathas {{are very similar}} to pastry dough. Parathas most likely originated in the Punjab, where a heavy breakfast of parathas with freshly churned butter and buttermilk was commonly consumed by the farmers to prepare themselves for the hard <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> ahead. However, parathas are now a common breakfast element across the country. Along with the plain layered version, many stuffed versions, such as 'Aloo ka Paratha' (Potato stuffed paratha), 'Mooli ka Paratha' (Radish stuffed paratha), and 'Qeemah ka Paratha' (Ground meat stuffed paratha) are popular.|$|E
25|$|While {{attending}} George Washington, Bouvier won a twelve-month junior editorship at Vogue magazine; she {{had been}} selected from several hundred women nationwide. The position entailed working for six months in the magazine's New York City office and spending the remaining six months in Paris. Before beginning the job, Bouvier celebrated her college graduation and her sister Lee's high school graduation by traveling with her to Europe for the summer. The trip {{was the subject of}} her only autobiography, One Special Summer, co-authored with Lee; it is also the only one of her published works to feature Jacqueline's drawings. On her first day at Vogue, the managing editor advised her to quit and go back to Washington. According to biographer Barbara Leaming, the editor was concerned about Bouvier's marriage prospects, as at the age of 22 she was already considered almost too old to be single in her social circles. Following the advice, she left the job and returned to Washington after only one <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{first part}} of the Gutenberg idea was using a single, hand-carved {{character}} to create identical copies of itself. Cutting a single letter could take a craftsman a <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> A single page taking 2500 letters made this way was impractical. A less labour-intensive method of reproduction was needed. Copies were produced by stamping the original into an iron plate, called a matrix. A rectangular tube was then connected to the matrix, creating a container in which molten type metal could be poured. Once cooled, the solid metal form was released from the tube. The fundamental innovation is that this matrix can be used to produce many duplicates of the same letter. The result of each molding was a rectangular block of metal with the form of the desired character protruding from the end. This piece of type could be put in a line, facing up, with other pieces of type. These lines were arranged to form blocks of text, which could be inked and pressed against paper, transferring the desired text to the paper.|$|E

25|$|The {{last years}} of the King's long reign were marked by natural catastrophes which caused great {{suffering}} for the Parisians; they began with a bad harvest followed by a famine {{in the winter of}} 1692-1693. Dozens of large ovens were built in the courtyard of the Louvre to bake bread for the poor, but the distribution of the loaves at central points around the city resulted in fighting and riots. That winter, fourteen or fifteen people a day died of hunger at the Hôtel Dieu hospital next to the Cathedral of Notre-Dame. Another bad harvest and severe winter hit Paris in 1708-1709, with temperatures reaching below 20 degrees (Celsius). The Seine froze from January 26 until April 5, making it impossible to deliver grain to the city by boat. During the summer of 1709, the government announced the creation of workshops for the poor and unemployed, who would receive 1.5 pounds of bread and two sous for each <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> Six thousand persons lined up before dawn near the Porte Saint-Martin for two thousand available jobs. Riots followed, the crowds attacked Les Halles, and Musketeers had to occupy the main streets and squares to restore order. Placards criticizing the King and his government began to appear on the city gates, the churches and the main squares.|$|E

[...] "She's Out of Her Mind" [...] namedrops the post-punk band Bauhaus in the words. It was the result of multiple rewrites, with each draft attempting to perfect the chorus preceding it. Hoppus called it a [...] "simple love song." [...] "Los Angeles" [...] was meant to show a heavier, more [...] "experimental" [...] version of the band. The song is centered on the band's adopted hometown; its lyrics reference the demolition of the Sixth Street Bridge in LA. Hoppus described [...] "Sober" [...] as [...] "about rebuilding [...] finding yourself, and knowing that you're in a troubled place but striving to get to somewhere better." [...] Its subject matter is based around two experiences: one when Skiba was a bicycle messenger in Chicago and was struck by a car, and another a fictional story of a [...] "drunken night with a girlfriend".
