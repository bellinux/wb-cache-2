500|$|Unlike the YF-17, {{which had}} {{hydromechanical}} controls {{serving as a}} backup to the FBW, General Dynamics took the innovative step of eliminating mechanical linkages between the control stick and rudder pedals, and the flight control surfaces. The F-16 is entirely reliant on its electrical systems to relay flight commands, instead of traditional mechanically-linked controls, leading to the early moniker of [...] "the electric jet". The quadruplex design permits [...] "graceful degradation" [...] in flight control response in {{that the loss of}} one channel renders the FLCS a [...] "triplex" [...] system. The FLCC began as an analog system on the A/B variants, but has been supplanted by a digital computer system beginning with the F-16C/D Block 40. The F-16's controls suffered from a sensitivity to static electricity or <b>electrostatic</b> <b>discharge</b> (<b>ESD).</b> Up to 70–80% of the C/D models' electronics were vulnerable to ESD.|$|E
