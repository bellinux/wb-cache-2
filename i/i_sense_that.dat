2500|$|Xi Zheng, then an {{assistant}} {{official in the}} palace library, often visited Meng Guang to consult him. When Meng Guang asked him what the crown prince, Liu Xuan, had been learning and reading {{and what he was}} interested in, Xi Zheng replied, [...] "He treats the people around him respectfully. He is very diligent and hardworking. He has the style of a crown prince of ancient times. When he meets people, he shows sincerity, kindness and generosity in everything he says and does." [...] Meng Guang then said, [...] "This is what is expected of every other person. What I really want to know is his level of political wisdom and how good his political skills are." [...] Xi Zheng replied, [...] "The Crown Prince's approach towards life is to focus on winning people's hearts and favour. He won't do what he shouldn't do. He doesn't openly reveal his wisdom. Besides, political skills can only be used under certain circumstances; they cannot be cultivated and learnt in advance." [...] Meng Guang knew that Xi Zheng was trying to careful with his words, so he said, [...] "I like to speak my mind as freely as possible. Every time I openly make criticisms, people will ridicule or hate me for that. Although <b>I</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> you don't like to hear what I say, my words make sense. The Empire is not unified yet. Political skills are crucial in this time and age. While one's mastery of political skills depends on his intellectual abilities, political skills can be learnt and mastered through diligence. This {{has to do with the}} Crown Prince's education. He should be striving to enrich himself with as much knowledge as possible so that he can be like a consultant. He should also sit for written and oral tests like academics and gain some titles. This is a top priority for him." [...] Xi Zheng strongly agreed with him.|$|E

And <b>I</b> <b>sensed</b> <b>that</b> immediately, so we did very little talking about it...he said, 'Shut up, I don't want to hear about it.' He didn't want me to tell him about it, you know. He wanted to make fun of it." ...|$|R
5000|$|The film {{received}} lukewarm reviews.Leigh Paatsch, {{writing in}} the Melbourne Herald-Sun, felt that the film's strongest point was the banter between the characters which was funny and engaging. But Paatsch said that Lawson's central performance was marred at times by [...] "an air of self-satisfied smarm" [...] and the character's path to enlightenment was un-focused and un-convincing. He concluded, [...] "And <b>I</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> others who similarly fell hard for the soulful sincerity of The Castle and The Dish will feel a little quizzical about the comparative slickness of Any Questions for Ben?&thinsp;".|$|E
5000|$|Blitzstein's {{score was}} {{preserved}} by Columbia Records, which released the original cast album in both monaural and stereo editions. The Fynsworth Alley label re-released the recording on compact disc in 2002. Steven Suskin, {{in his review}} in Playbill, noted: [...] "Time {{and again in the}} score, <b>I</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> Blitzstein is reminding himself to write Irish music - and that hampers his creativity. The score ranges from exceptional to mundane; the weaker portions make it very clear to us, today, that Juno simply couldn't have worked. There have been at least three major attempts at 'fixing' the show, {{in the same way that}} Bernstein's Candide was 'fixed'." ...|$|E

In this case, <b>I</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> struggle as involving wars {{and the threat of}} wars, the overwhelming desire to live, and the consolations of art, love and the hope for peace. It is a kind of night-music, which, from its opening 12-tone row to its ambiguously diatonic final cadence, is an ongoing conflict of nocturnal images: wish-dreams, nightmares, repose, sleeplessness, night-terrors and sleep itself, Death’s twin brother.I never knew Yadin Tannenbaum, but I know his spirit.|$|E
5000|$|Box said Eric Ambler {{had a very}} {{different}} approach to writing to Hammond Innes. [...] "Innes was a writer who spent as much time researching his books as he did writing them," [...] she wrote. [...] "Eric's books depend much more on characterisation, motivation and ideologies rather than realistic documentation. I remember him telling me that he hadn't even visited most of the countries he wrote about, and <b>I</b> <b>sensed</b> <b>that</b> he wasn't entirely happy working on Campbell's Kingdom."

5000|$|Geoffrey Nyarota, who {{was then}} one of the few black reporters at the Rhodesia Herald newspaper, later wrote in his memoirs that many whites became resentful and wary towards blacks in general, believing them all to be [...] "terrorist sympathisers". Describing the Herald {{newsroom}} the night of the incident, he relates a [...] "vile collective temper" [...] among the white sub-editors: [...] "They cursed until their voices became hoarse, threatening dire consequences for all terrs and munts or kaffirs... <b>I</b> <b>sensed</b> <b>that</b> some of the more derogatory remarks made in unnecessarily loud voices that evening were meant specifically for my ears." ...|$|R
5000|$|Linder {{then decided}} to {{dispense}} of the [...] "Max" [...] character and try something different for his third (and final) attempt: The Three Must-Get-Theres in 1922. The film is a satire of swashbuckling films made by Douglas Fairbanks and is loosely based on the plot of Alexander Dumas' The Three Musketeers. The film was praised by Fairbanks and Charlie Chaplin, but again failed at the box office. At the films premiere, Linder had said to director Robert Florey [...] "You see, Bob, <b>I</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> I'm no longer funny; I have so many preoccupations that I can no longer concentrate on my film character ... The public is mildly amused by my situations, but this evening where were the explosions of laughter that we hear when Charlie's on the screen?...Make people laugh, its easy to say make people laugh, but I don't feel funny anymore." ...|$|E

The piece takes its form from the baroque sonata da chiesa form by alternating the movements from slow-fast-slow-fast. There are common themes {{and a sense of}} tonality that help to bring the work together. Donald Truesdell quotes James Tocco, pianist, who gets {{to the heart of the}} piece:Lenny may disagree with me but one finds much more about him in the Anniversaries than the people to whom they are dedicated. <b>I</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> Lenny may have been attracted to certain characteristics of a personality that in some way reflected something in himself-aspects of his own personality that he wished to develop.Leonard Bernstein composed Four Anniversaries for the Piano to commemorate the birthdays offour important people in his life and the result is four individual movements that form one coherent piece.|$|E
5000|$|In 1979, Devi at the University of Illinois {{published}} an article ("About Smocks and Jocks") in which he contended {{that it was difficult}} to apply specific laboratory research to sporting situations. For instance, how can the pressure of shooting a foul shot in front of 12,000 screaming fans be duplicated in the lab? Martens contended: [...] "I have grave doubts that isolated psychological studies which manipulate a few variables, attempting to uncover the effects of X on Y, can be cumulative to form a coherent picture of human behavior. <b>I</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> the elegant control achieved in laboratory research is such that all meaning is drained from the experimental situation. The external validity of laboratory studies is at best limited to predicting behavior in other laboratories." [...] Martens urged researchers {{to get out of the}} laboratory and onto the field to meet athletes and coaches on their own turf. Martens' article spurred an increased interest in qualitative research methods in sport psychology, such as the seminal article [...] "Mental Links to Excellence." ...|$|E
40|$|It {{was about}} nine {{years after the}} closure of the old wards at Woodilee {{psychiatric}} hospital, while walking in the disused grounds that I remembered and finally understood the words of Wilbert Rideau “The Wall Is Strong”. The wall is strong refers to the metaphorical walls that psychologi-cally incarcerate the human mind and its will. Even though this institution had closed, its walls still held its captives. The institutional wall was indeed strong, too strong for any individual. The holed roofs and the bricked up windows of the dilapidated hospital buildings did little to mask their previous role, if at all, the buildings looked even more intimidating. <b>I</b> <b>sensed</b> <b>that</b> the boarded window frames and sealed up doorway...|$|R
5|$|All over Europe, strange {{weather is}} {{provoking}} panic. Many believe the unnatural occurrences are {{the beginning of}} the Apocalypse. Dr. Stephen Strange, the court magician of Queen Elizabeth <b>I,</b> <b>senses</b> <b>that</b> there are unnatural forces at work. He has also been asked to watch over the secret treasure of the Knights Templar which is being brought over from Jerusalem. Elizabeth tells her head of intelligence, Sir Nicholas Fury, to bring the weapon to England safely. Fury in turn contracts blind minstrel and agent Matthew Murdoch to rendezvous with the Templar guard somewhere in Europe and secure the weapon. Later that evening, Fury and his assistant Peter Parquagh are attacked by an assassin whom Fury disables and locks in the Tower of London.|$|R

She {{repeated}} it to me several times during my childhood and it was word for word the same story every time. She told me the facts, almost without comment and without expressing her feelings and many years later, I still have no answers for all the questions I would like to ask. I never interrupted her tale to ask for more details because <b>I</b> <b>sensed</b> <b>that</b> it was a world apart, a world with sinister undertones, a description of which my mother felt reluctant, {{and at the same}} time compelled, to pass on to me, feeling perhaps that the story was my business...|$|R
5000|$|Having been {{ratified}} by {{three-fourths of the}} States (38), the Twenty-sixth Amendment {{became part of the}} Constitution. On July 5, 1971, the Administrator of General Services, Robert Kunzig, certiﬁed its adoption. President Nixon and Julianne Jones, Joseph W. Loyd, Jr., and Paul S. Larimer of the [...] "Young Americans in Concert" [...] also signed the certificate as witnesses. During the signing ceremony, held in the East Room of the White House, Nixon talked about his confidence in the youth of America. As I meet with this group today, <b>I</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> we can have confidence that America’s new voters, America’s young generation, will provide what America needs as we approach our 200th birthday, not just strength and not just wealth but the “Spirit of ‘76’ a spirit of moral courage, a spirit of high idealism in which we believe in the American dream, but in which we realize that the American dream can never be fulfilled until every American has an equal chance to fulfill it in their own life.|$|E
5000|$|The {{layout of}} Kyogoku's writing is {{arranged}} {{according to his}} own rules. A sentence never crosses over a page break. Moreover, every time a new version is published, Kyogoku always lays out the work again according to this rule. He explained the intention, [...] "I {{made it possible for}} readers to stop reading whenever they want to. If one sentence steps over, readers who are weary of reading must turn over the page. <b>I</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> is contemptible, because not interest to the story but physical factor force readers to read." [...] Second, many kanji characters in his writing are invariably given kana characters alongside. Kyogoku can use DTP software perfectly, so he freely writes old-fashioned characters and ateji characters with the purpose of capturing old Japanese atmosphere in his novels. However, such characters are difficult even for Japanese people to read. Therefore, giving kana characters alongside kanji characters in his writing is essential for readers to be able to understand those characters' meaning. Third, sentences are marked out by entering null lines before and after them on purpose. That technique enables readers to perceive the curious blank where the important sentences are written. In these ways, Kyogoku always keeps readability in mind, and dedicates himself not only to sentences but also the layout. These qualities do not, however, carry over to the English translations of his books.|$|E
5000|$|Initially, Carlos was {{to focus}} on the terrorist's capture in Sudan in 1994 and run only 90 minutes. However, once {{director}} Olivier Assayas agreed to make the film and he conducted extensive research, he realized that there was much more to explore with the man and his times: [...] "I felt it was the fate of one man and, in a certain way, the story of one generation, plus a meditation on time, history, fate and issues more universal than the specific history of Carlos". Former foreign correspondent and Le Monde editor Stephen Smith compiled the film's research, some of which came from the files of intelligence agencies that became available {{after the fall of the}} Berlin Wall when files from former Soviet Bloc countries surfaced. Some of the film's dialogue came from tape recordings made by the Stasi, the secret police of the former East Germany. Made with a budget of $18 million, Carlos was Assayas' first foray into television. Originally, he was not interested in the project because it seemed [...] "too crazy and too complicated". He was drawn to the project because it allowed him to make a film dealing with recent history and real people. He said, [...] "not long ago, the idea of making a film about Carlos would have scared French producers, but nowadays <b>I</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> we're being encouraged to make films that have a contemporary dimension". Actor Edgar Ramirez said, [...] "What we're trying to do is demystify him. This guy who supposedly had everything figured out was not as keen as he was said to be. The public and historical image was as history's big manipulator but in many moments of his life, he was being manipulated".|$|E

In the main, the authors of this timely and extensively researched volume tend to look upon these incentives as among the more significant location-specific determinants in a race among European countries to attract inward FDI to their borders. Indeed, they present quite persuasive evidence to support their case.

40|$|My {{presentation}} {{starts from}} a number of practical questions, each of which, if we unpack it, brings with it a number of theoretical perspectives, issues and enquiries. One such question has a precise empirical focus, which is how to establish a digital archive, working with the practitioner herself, in the case of thirty years of Rosemary Butcher’s making new ‘choreographic’ work, where a complication is added, which is that the practitioner herself continues to make new work in the time of archive production. This is new work that the act of archive production itself might have its impact upon. I am supposing that some of the problems thrown up by this particular exercise of archive production might have implications for archive production in the performing arts more generally, not least because the Rosemary Butcher undertaking is positionequite explicitly in the context of performing arts practice-led-research (and generously funded in large part by the AHRC). My own research has focused in recent years on the question of expert practitioner-specific modes of knowledge and models of intelligibility, on performance-making processes as distinct from the practices of spectating, and on the issue {{of what might be called}} the ‘signature practices’ of the expert practitioner. Against this backdrop, a further set of questions is bound up with the issue of digital archive production. First, how might we identify, document and archive disciplinary specificity, in performance-making practices, as distinct from the practices of expert spectating, upon which much performance-documentation tends to be modelled? What is at stake in this question is the issue of the university’s failure, over recent decades, to engage theoretically with disciplinary specificity as such, in contrast with the widely preferred and marketable ‘interdisciplinarity’. Second, what are the identifiers of signature practice, in the named expert practitioner, when and where do they emerge, and can they be/how might they be documented? Third, what constitutes performance-making expertise and is it the case, as <b>I</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> it might be, that we know it when we see it, in the university, rather better than we know how to instruct others to identify it? The expression ‘as I sense it might be’, that I have just used, signals the tentative and speculative nature of my own enquiry and expertise here, and I am flagging up, in case there are any ‘hard-edge’ e-scientists amongst us, the wholly fuzzy nature of my certainties. I am setting up the formula, ‘as <b>I</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> it might be’, to represent a major model of intelligibility that is central to the ways of knowing in this particular field of practice...|$|E
