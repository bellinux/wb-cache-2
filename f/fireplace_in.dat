5|$|After being {{purchased}} by the Guellers in 2004, the restaurant was redecorated and modernised, the décor having become shabby under previous owners. The new decorations included recessed lighting and fabric-covered walls. There is a <b>fireplace</b> <b>in</b> {{the centre of the}} dining room, with an 18th-century settle (a type of bench) beside it. Elements from the Reid and Long era remain, with the bar and ceilings still being recognisable from their time at the restaurant.|$|E
5|$|The hall has a hammerbeam roof; {{the louvre}} in the centre is now glazed, but was {{originally}} {{the only means}} of escape for smoke rising from a <b>fireplace</b> <b>in</b> the centre of the floor. The wooden panelling was designed by Ninian Comper and was erected in 1911 in place of some previous 19th-century Gothic type, though even earlier panelling, dating from 1710, is evident in the Buttery.|$|E

5|$|During one Occlumency lesson, Snape {{is called}} away and Harry, left alone, looks into Snape's Pensieve, viewing {{a memory of}} his time {{as a student at}} Hogwarts. Harry is shocked to witness his father, James Potter, and Sirius {{bullying}} and humiliating Snape. Snape catches Harry and, enraged, refuses to continue the lessons. Distraught at this revelation of his father's character, Harry talks to Sirius and Lupin by using Floo powder through the <b>fireplace</b> <b>in</b> Umbridge's own office and learns more about his parents and their background. After helping Harry break into Umbridge's office, Fred and George then leave Hogwarts to start a joke-shop in Diagon Alley.|$|E
5|$|Selma {{reveals that}} she is unconcerned about money, as she made a good profit in the stock market; Sideshow Bob tells her he hopes he is not marrying her for her money. She also reveals that she has no sense of smell or taste and has cut back on cigarettes, now smoking only after meals and after episodes of MacGyver. Selma sends the Simpsons a tape of their honeymoon, {{including}} Sideshow Bob's tirade over {{the absence of a}} gas <b>fireplace</b> <b>in</b> their hotel room. Bart realizes that Selma has one hour to live and the Simpsons rush to the hotel room.|$|E
5|$|South of {{the great}} hall was a two-storey {{building}} containing withdrawing chambers, dating from around 1200. Narrow windows opening onto the bailey were original but have since been filled in. The first floor was entirely occupied by the great chamber, furnished with a <b>fireplace.</b> <b>In</b> the south-west {{corner of the room}} was a door to a small room which was perhaps used as a safe. The ground floor was used as a cellar, through which the Carrickfergus Tower could be accessed. The polygonal tower was also accessible through the great chamber at first floor level. Fitted with latrines and a fireplace, it was an extension of the lordly accommodation provided by the great chamber.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} 1840s, Willem D. Eagles {{purchased}} the Aurora Inn. He engaged his uncle John Eagles, a retired sea captain, to manage it. Oil portraits of William Eagles {{and his wife}} Nancy now hang above the <b>fireplaces</b> <b>in</b> the reception area and parlor. Portraits of John Eagles and his wife hang above <b>fireplaces</b> <b>in</b> {{the dining room and}} bar. These newly restored portraits were painted in the 19th century by New York artist Charles Loring Elliott.|$|R
5|$|The 17th-century room, S2, {{used the}} south {{wall of the}} {{existing}} structure as its own north wall, and was largely built using materials salvaged from S1, although the standard of the work was poorer. The new room had a double fireplace, {{but there was no}} evidence of a dividing wall between the two hearths. Limestone blocks, identical to the quoins in S1, were used as structural and decorative features in the <b>fireplace.</b> <b>In</b> addition to the pantiles taken from S1, there were Cornish slate roof tiles. Whether they formed part of the roof of S2 or were associated with the possible wooden extension is unclear.|$|E
5|$|The French motto Quant Je Puis (As Much as I Can) {{is central}} to the ethos of the school, which focuses upon the all-round {{development}} of the individual. It is inherited from the Shireburn family who once owned the original mansion on the site; the family emblem is emblazoned, in stone, with the motto, above the <b>fireplace</b> <b>in</b> the Top Refectory. At {{the far end of the}} same room, once the dining room of the Shireburns, the motto can be seen again, carved into the minstrel's gallery: Quant Je Puis. Hugo Sherburn armig. me fieri fecit. Anno Domini 1523. Et sicut fuit sic fiat.|$|E
5|$|The caretaker's cottage is two storeys high, {{built of}} {{limestone}} ashlar with a slate roof. It has sash windows {{to the south}} and north, with false windows on the east and west ends. Access to the pool is through the ground floor lobby of the cottage. Inside, the original panelled ceiling remains intact as well as a hob and <b>fireplace</b> <b>in</b> the bedroom and another early 19th-century fireplace on the ground floor. On either side of the cottage are six changing cubicles with sloping roofs covered with asbestos sheets. At the western end are two further dressing rooms and the perpetual shower which was linked to the ladies' pool.|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} {{has some}} original paneling and trim, particular around the <b>fireplaces</b> <b>in</b> the main block. Most {{of the other}} trim is from the Colonial Revival restoration in the 1920s.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} is oriented around a center hall {{leading to the}} kitchen at the rear. The hall is entered through the south porch door, which is topped by a leaded glass fanlight. Two symmetrical living rooms flank the hall at the front. The 1793 portion of the house contains a reception room and a dining room. The second floor is arranged {{in the same manner}} as the first, with rooms, doors and <b>fireplaces</b> <b>in</b> the same locations. The main stair continues to the attic.

5|$|Having {{served for}} many years as 'Moore's Coleridge Cottage Inn', the {{building}} was acquired for the nation in 1908, and the following year it was {{handed over to the}} National Trust. On 23 May 1998, following a £25,000 appeal by the Friends of Coleridge and the National Trust, two further rooms on the first floor were officially opened by Lord Coleridge a descendant of Samuel Taylor Coleridge. In 2011 the National Trust undertook a major re-presentation project that also saw the opening of additional rooms. The oldest parts of the cottage are now presented as the Coleridge family might have known them, with the original inglenook <b>fireplace</b> <b>in</b> the parlour uncovered and working once more. The garden was opened to visitors for the first time, complete with an 18th-century vegetable plot, a wildflower area and representations of Coleridge's animals. It is possible to listen to poetry at audio posts around the garden and the well is operational once more and {{can be seen in the}} small courtyard behind the cottage. A number of mementos of Coleridge are on display including his inkstand, locks of his hair and correspondence in his handwriting.|$|E
5|$|Other {{spirits are}} also said {{to remain at}} The Octagon as well. Dolley Madison's spirit has been seen near the <b>fireplace</b> <b>in</b> the main ballroom as well as heading through a closed door to the garden, and her ghost's {{presence}} is accompanied {{by the smell of}} lilacs, her favorite flower. A slave girl in the house was allegedly thrown from the third floor landing to the first floor below and killed by a British soldier during the War of 1812, and eyewitnesses have reported hearing her scream. The specter of a British soldier in War of 1812 dress was seen by caretaker James Cypress in the 1950s, and museum superintendent Alric H. Clay claimed that in the 1960s spirits would often turn on the lights and open The Octagon's doors late at night. A gambler shot to death in the house's third-floor bedroom in the late 19th century has sometimes been seen still in the bed he died in, and ghostly footmen have been seen at the front door waiting to receive guests. He was said to have rung a bell shortly before his death and that the ring of the bell often heard in the house is from him. Various witnesses have also reported hearing assorted moans, screams, and footsteps.|$|E

25|$|The Little Ante Room: The {{white marble}} <b>fireplace</b> <b>in</b> this room, with inserts of black marble, is almost {{certainly}} by Inigo Jones. The panels in the ceiling were painted by Lorenzo Sabbatini (1530–1577) and therefore are far older than {{this part of the}} house; again there are paintings by Van Dyck and Teniers.|$|E
25|$|In 1500, Scotstarvit Tower {{was built}} a mile {{southwest}} from Hill of Tarvit. This was {{constructed by the}} Inglis family of Tarvit as the centre of their estate. The tower was then sold in 1611 to Sir John Scott of Scotstarvit. Sir John rebuilt much of the tower in the 1620s – seen by the date 1627 {{on a piece of}} the Tower's chimneypiece that now forms part of the <b>fireplace</b> <b>in</b> the Hill of Tarvit's smoking room.|$|E

Type 2 houses had ranges in both ground floor rooms. Type 3 houses had a range in the single ground floor room.|$|E
25|$|For example, coal {{burns in}} a <b>fireplace</b> <b>in</b> the {{presence}} of oxygen, {{but it does not}} when it is stored at room temperature. The reaction is spontaneous at low and high temperatures but at room temperature its rate is so slow that it is negligible. The increase in temperature, as created by a match, allows the reaction to start and then it heats itself, because it is exothermic. That is valid for many other fuels, such as methane, butane, and hydrogen.|$|E
25|$|Francon contrives to have Roark {{repair the}} white marble <b>fireplace</b> <b>in</b> her bedroom. Roark mocks the pretense, {{and after the}} first visit, sends someone else to {{complete}} the repair. Expecting Roark, Francon is enraged {{and returns to the}} quarry on horseback. She finds Roark nearby, walking from the site. He again mocks her and she strikes him across the face with her horsewhip. In the evening he appears in her open bedroom, forcefully embracing and kissing her passionately, the sexually charged scene fading to black.|$|E
