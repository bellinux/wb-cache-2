Few ToR could not be accomplished due to time constraints and/or data deficiencies and will be accomplished during the forthcoming STECF EWG 13 - 13 fishing <b>effort</b> <b>regime</b> evaluations part 2 (7 - 11 October 2013, Barza d’Ispra, Italy). Outstanding ToRs are those dealing with the requested comparative analyses regarding cod and sole selectivity of fully documented fisheries (FDF) and fisheries not participating in FDF schemes, detailed evaluations of the national implementation as regards fishing effort derogations granted under the provisions of article 13 of the new cod plan (Counc. Reg. No 1342 / 2008), as well as spatio-temporal patterns in cod catchability. STECF EWG 13 - 06 tasks have been supported by the DCF fishing effort data call in 2013. STECF EWG 13 - 06 notes a general improvement in data completeness and quality as well as compliance with dead lines regarding Member States’ data provisions. However, STECF EWG 13 - 06 suffered again from delays, incompleteness and erroneous data submissions and re-submissions. Details about the DCF data call definitions, data quality in 2013 and significant shortfalls as identified by JRC and the experts contributing to the working group are summarized in section 4. STECF EWG 13 - 06 notes that its recommendations in 2012 to amend the 2013 DCF data call to support fishing <b>effort</b> <b>regime</b> evaluation have been implemented and that these changes have supported and will support the accomplishment of specific ToR. STECF EWG 13 - 06 noted that the DCF data call in 2013 required re-submissions of re-aggregated data {{in addition to the}} re-quested data update for 2012, which implied additional workload for the national institutions involved in the DCF framework. Notably Denmark, Portugal and UK (without Scotland) have revised their complete time series of fisheries specific catch and effort data. Spanish data were made available for 2012 and discard data were inserted to earlier data submissions to support the <b>effort</b> <b>regime</b> evaluation for Southern hake and Nephrops. STECF EWG 13 - 06 notes that ICES (WGMIXFISH 2013) has undertaken a detailed comparison of the 2011 ICES fisheries data received in 2013 and the 2011 STECF DCF effort data received and compiled in 2012. While the fisheries specific data on landings and nominal effort are found highly consistent, the ICES estimates of discards were consistently higher than the estimates of discards provided in the STECF data base. The pronounced differences in discard estimates are mainly due to different raising procedures applied and shall be further analysed in order to identify best and consistent practices applied to discard raising (section 4. 12). STECF EWG 13 - 06, in response to the general increased interest in discard estimates, has proposed an Index of Discard Coverage DQI to facilitate the use of the discard estimates provided in the STECF data bases on fisheries specific catch and fishing effort and obtained through the 2013 DCF data call. The DQI allows identification and avoidance of the use of discard estimates by fisheries based on the proportion of sums of national landings covered by discard estimates in relation to the overall sums of national landings. The method to derive the DQI and the interpretation of the results are provided in section 4. 5 of the present report.

His characterisation of regimes as "principles, norms, rules, and decision-making procedures around which actors' expectations converge in a given issue area" (Krasner 1983 : 1) is now widely cited and accepted. Yet, not unlike the often impenetrable compromise texts of international agreements, this definition hides more than it reveals. The idea of convergence, in particular, poses numerous questions and regime scholars {{around the world have}} devoted much of their time to theorising, explaining and predicting the processes by which this progressive unification of purpose may come about...|$|R

40|$|The {{southern}} North Sea is {{the stage}} of conflicting objectives of beam trawlers targeting flatfish; of shrimp trawlers fishing for brown shrimp with bycatch of juvenile flatfish; and of demersal trawlers, the main fishery on cod, a key predator of shrimp and other groups. To expose trade-offs between the fleets’ objectives and to explore what a possible variant of a multispecies maximum sustainable yield (MSY) could look like, we parameterized an ecosystem model and subjected it {{to a range of}} different fishing effort levels of the three fleets. Long-term projections highlighted multiple fishing regimes that lead to catches of at least 30 % of all focal stocks' single species MSYs at the same time. Trade-offs between the yields of shrimp fishers and demersal trawlers made higher simultaneous yields impossible. Besides optimizing multispecies catches, we identified <b>effort</b> <b>regimes</b> that satisfied a set of descriptors of good environmental status (GES). We found that GES can only be obtained through low efforts of beam and demersal trawlers, which cannot be aligned with our multispecies MSY variant without accepting trade-offs in fishing yields and/or conservation goals...|$|R

40|$|Climate changes affect marine {{ecosystems}} and the survival, growth, reproduction {{and distribution of}} species, including those targeted by commercial fisheries. The impact of climate change has been reported for many fish species, but studies focusing {{on the effects of}} climate on bivalve resources are lacking. In Portugal, the harvesting of bivalves is an old and artisanal activity, of special importance along the Algarve coast (South of Portugal). This study aims to evaluate the influence of climatic, environmental and fisheries factors on the landings of intertidal coastal lagoon and coastal bivalve species (subtidal nearshore species). The environmental and fisheries parameters considered to affect the landings of bivalves in the eastern Algarve were: fishing effort (number of fishing events), sea surface temperature, North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index, upwelling index, wind magnitude and direction and river discharges. Analysis of time series data using min/max autocorrelation factor analysis and dynamic factor analysis showed that, for most species, fishing effort was positively related with landings per unit effort trends in the following year. Lagoon bivalve species (Cerastoderma edule and Ruditapes decussatus) responded to different environmental variables than the coastal bivalve species (Chamelea gallina, Pharus legumen, Donax spp. and Spisula solida). Upwelling index had a significant effect on the lagoon bivalves while the NAO index, wind magnitude and direction, and river discharges only affected the coastal species. This study highlighted the need to adapt fishing <b>effort</b> <b>regimes,</b> while considering the background effects of environmental variability, in order to improve fisheries management...|$|R

40|$|Modern {{fisheries}} {{operate in}} circumstances of contested demands on resources from multiple stakeholders and management under different legislative jurisdictions. Formal management strategy evaluation (MSE) facilitates {{quantitative assessment of}} {{strengths and weaknesses of}} alternative management strategies designed to meet multiple agenda. The reef line fishery on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR, Australia) operates under multiple jurisdictions in a World Heritage Area with diverse stakeholder agenda for conservation and commercial and recreational harvest. We worked with stakeholders to identify: (i) specific objectives; (ii) alternative management strategies; and (iii) performance indicators to compare likelihoods of meeting economic, recreational and stock objectives for the fishery and conservation objectives for the effects of line fishing on the GBR. Stakeholders identified objectives and associated performance indicators in four categories, for: (1) conservation of unfished populations; (2) the harvestable stock; (3) economic performance of the fishery; (4) satisfaction of recreational fishers. We used a metapopulation and fishing simulation model (ELFSim) to assess the effects of three <b>effort</b> <b>regimes</b> in combination with three area closure regimes on the primary target species, common coral trout (Plectropomus leopardus). The nine management strategies were also compared with a zero fishing scenario for reference. Controlling fishing effort most improved prospects of meeting economic, stock and recreational satisfaction objectives for the fishery. Nine of ten performance indicators across all stakeholder objectives were maximised when fishing effort was at the lowest non-zero level tested. Maximising the area closed to fishing with reduced fishing effort was most likely to achieve the conservation objectives. This research provides a case study of productive engagement with stakeholders to address fisheries and conservation management needs in a multi-sectoral spatial management context. Together, we provided a common currency (the prospect of meeting quantified objectives) for impartial evaluation of performance of alternative management options against diverse and often competing stakeholder agenda.
