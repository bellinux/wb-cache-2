40|$|Mice and guinea-pigs {{were fed}} diets {{containing}} 20 and 30 % whole Sanguisorba officinalis, dried and ground. In immature female mice, premature vaginal opening and constant dioestrus were produced. Adult animals showed oestrous cycles of abnormal length, owing to a prolongation of the dioestrous phase, but mated and became pregnant readily during treatment. Lactation {{appeared to be}} affected adversely. Male fertility was not impaired. The plant material showed no oestrogenic activity when fed to spayed mice, and did not produce vaginal opening in spayed guinea-pigs. Zadina & Geisler [1950] reported that Sanguisorba officinalis (<b>garden</b> <b>burnet)</b> supÂ¬ pressed the oestrous cycles of female mice when fed as 25 % of the normal diet for 14 days, and suggested that the plant material exerted a direct anti-gonadotrophic effect on the anterior pituitary. The effect of S. officinalis on mice and guinea-pigs is described below...|$|E
40|$|The {{invention}} discloses a medicament {{for treating}} {{breast cancer and}} a preparation method thereof. The medicament comprises medicament effective components which are 3 beta-hydroxyl- 28 - norursol- 12 and 17 -diene- 22 -ketone and a medicament which is prepared from a medicinal auxiliary material, wherein the medicament effective components are 1 - 90 percent by weight, and the medicinal auxiliary material is 10 - 99 percent. The structural formula of the medicament effective components {{is shown in the}} specification. The preparation method comprises the following steps of: (1) pulverizing <b>garden</b> <b>burnet</b> carbon as a medicament raw material, adding carbinol or ethanol, extracting and filtering and concentrating filter liquor to obtain fluid extract; (2) dispersing the fluid extract in the step (1) by water, extracting by chloroform and recovering a solvent of extract liquor to obtain extract; (3) carrying out silica gel column chromatography separation on the extract in the step (2) and sucking and filtering the obtained solid and recrystallizing to obtain the medicament effective components of the compound; and (4) taking the medicament effective components according to the weight proportion and retaining the medicinal auxiliary material for preparing the medicament.; The invention has good treatment effect on treating breast cancer and can replace western medicines for oral administration in the postoperative chemotherapy period. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
