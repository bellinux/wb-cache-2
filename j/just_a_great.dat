25|$|Ernő Zórád {{ended his}} {{professional}} relationship with Tibor Cs. Horváth and wrote his own comic scripts. Luckily Zórád was not <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> artist, {{but also a}} talented storyteller: these comics came {{much closer to the}} medium's own language. He also made experimental collage comics in the early seventies attracting international attention. These works were invited to the Salone Internazionale del Comics festival in 1970 but his portfolio – due to Hungarian bureaucracy – has arrived late. Furthermore, the works has been stolen from the festival. By the late seventies the classic trio of Hungarian comics creators disappeared: Korcsmáros died in 1975, Sebők died in 1980 and Zórád retired temporarily. Since young talents were not introduced during the preceding three decades (except for Attila Fazekas), many mark these years the end of Hungarian comics' golden age.|$|E

500|$|After Halo 3, {{development}} studio Bungie {{created an}} internal team {{to work on}} Peter Jackson's planned Halo game, Halo Chronicles. Chronicles was eventually canceled and the team began working on a standalone expansion project—Halo 3: ODST—while another team, led by creative director Marcus Lehto and design lead Christian Allen, worked on Reach. The team considered many different concepts and approaches to the game; among the rejected ideas was a sequel to Halo 3. The team eventually settled on a prequel to the first Halo game in brainstorming sessions. It would {{take place on the}} planet Reach, during a pivotal time in the war. [...] "Reach, as a fictional planet, was <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> candidate [...] play around with. It's such a rich world, with such a great fiction surrounding it," [...] said Lehto. [...] "We were like: 'Okay, that's it. We've just got a lot of things we can do there so we can build an immense story with it.'" [...] No longer burdened with continuing the story threads of the Halo trilogy, Bungie used Reach to introduce new characters and settings. As Reach ends with the destruction of the titular planet, Bungie wanted to be sure players still felt a sense of accomplishment and success. [...] "It is a challenge overall to ensure the player feels they're doing the right thing {{all the way to the}} end," [...] said Lehto.|$|E
500|$|Richard Corliss of TIME heralded {{the film}} and its director, Steve McQueen, by stating: [...] "Indeed, McQueen's film is closer in its {{storytelling}} particulars to such 1970s exploitation-exposés of slavery as Mandingo and Goodbye, Uncle Tom. Except that McQueen is not a schlockmeister sensationalist but a remorseless artist." [...] Corliss draws parallels with Nazi Germany, saying, [...] "McQueen shows that racism, aside from its barbarous inhumanity, is insanely inefficient. It {{can be argued that}} Nazi Germany lost the war both because it diverted so much manpower to the killing of Jews and because it did not exploit the brilliance of Jewish scientists in building smarter weapons. So the slave owners dilute the energy of their slaves by whipping them for sadistic sport and, as Epps does, waking them at night to dance for his wife's cruel pleasure." [...] Gregory Ellwood of HitFix gave the film an [...] "A-" [...] rating, stating, [...] "12 Years is a powerful drama driven by McQueen's bold direction and the finest performance of Chiwetel Ejiofor's career." [...] He continued by praising the performances of Fassbender and Nyong'o, citing Nyong'o as [...] "the film's breakthrough performance [...] may find Nyong'o making her way to the Dolby Theater next March". He also admired the film's [...] "gorgeous" [...] cinematography and the musical score, as [...] "one of Hans Zimmer's more moving scores in some time". Paul MacInnes of The Guardian scored the film five out of five stars, writing, [...] "Stark, visceral and unrelenting, 12 Years a Slave is not <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> film but a necessary one." ...|$|E
