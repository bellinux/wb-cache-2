5|$|Along {{with many}} others in the Labour movement, Wilkinson's attitudes were radicalised by the Russian Revolution of 1917.

For the next <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>the</b> CPGB was the main focus of her political activity, although she kept her membership in the Labour Party, which at the time accepted dual CPGB/Labour memberships.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 20th century, formal {{schooling}} had again become {{a feature of}} the islands, and in 1906 the church was extended to make a schoolhouse. The children all now learned English and their native Gaelic. Improved midwifery skills, denied to the island by John Mackay, reduced the problems of childhood tetanus. From the 1880s, trawlers fishing the north Atlantic made regular visits, bringing additional trade. Talk of an evacuation occurred in 1875 during MacKay's time as minister, but despite occasional food shortages and a flu epidemic in 1913, the population was stable at between 75 and 80, and no obvious sign existed that within a <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>the</b> millennia-old occupation of the island was to end.|$|E

5|$|Cardiff Castle {{was built}} during this period. There are two {{possible}} dates for the construction: William the Conqueror may {{have built a}} castle at Cardiff as early as 1081 on his return from his pilgrimage to St Davids. Alternatively, the first Norman fortification may have been constructed around 1091 by Robert Fitzhamon, the lord of Gloucester. Fitzhamon invaded the region in 1090, and used the castle {{as a base for}} the occupation of the rest of southern Glamorgan over the next <b>few</b> <b>years.</b> <b>The</b> site was close to the sea and could be easily supplied by ship, was well protected by the Rivers Taff and Rhymney and also controlled the old Roman road running along the coast.|$|E
5|$|Desperate for {{materials}} and short on funds, the palace was initially built {{entirely out of}} wood, its various structures surrounded by a simple log palisade. On 10 June 1782, the king ceremonially crossed the river from Thonburi to take permanent residence in the new palace. Three days later on 13 June, the king held an abbreviated coronation ceremony, thus becoming the first monarch of the new Rattanakosin Kingdom. Over the next <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>the</b> king began replacing wooden structures with masonry, rebuilding the walls, forts, gates, throne halls and royal residences. This rebuilding included the royal chapel, which would come to house the Emerald Buddha.|$|E

5|$|In {{the wake}} of the First World War the council's Markets Committee began a {{programme}} of gradually buying back all the privately owned stalls, with the intention of encouraging demobilised servicemen to work on the market.

In the same year the church affiliated with the Presbyterian Synod of Albany, three years later becoming a charter member of the Presbytery of Cayuga, which, in 1811, {{became part of the}} newly formed Synod of Geneva. Mr Parsons served until 1833 when he accepted posts in Tully, New York and Otisco, New York. He returned to Marcellus in 1835, where he remained until 1841 when Rev John Tompkins was appointed.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the next}} <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>the</b> {{situation}} deteriorated further. Governor Tryon and the Boys exchanged threats, truce offers, and other writings, which were frequently written by Allen in florid and didactic language, while the Boys continued to drive surveyors and incoming tenants on New York-granted lands away. Most of these incidents {{did not involve}} bloodshed, although individuals were at times manhandled, and the Boys sometimes did extensive property damage when driving tenants out. By March 1774, the harsh treatment of settlers and their property by Allen and the Boys prompted Tryon to increase some of the rewards to £100.|$|E

He became chairman of the committee in 1833, and would come to be considered the second founder of the City of London School, after Carpenter.|$|E
