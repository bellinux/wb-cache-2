5|$|Although slight {{changes in}} water level affect many species, {{the system as}} a whole also cycles and pulses with each change. Some transformations to the {{diversity}} of plant and animal life are natural, caused by fire or storms, and some are induced by humans, such as urban encroachment, the introduction of exotic species, and rapid global warming. Environmental conditions in the Everglades favor no particular species. Some species, such as snail kites and apple snails, <b>do</b> <b>well</b> in wet conditions, but wood storks and Cape Sable seaside sparrows (Ammodramus maritimus mirabilis) <b>do</b> <b>well</b> in dryer circumstances.|$|E

5|$|Adenanthos cuneatus {{was taken}} to Great Britain in 1824, and has been grown in {{cultivation}} in Australia and the western United States. Its attractive bronzed or reddish foliage is its main horticultural feature, along with its ability to attract birds to the garden. It requires a well-drained position to <b>do</b> <b>well,</b> but will grow in full sun or semi-shade, and tolerates both sand and gravelly soils. George Lullfitz, a Western Australian nurseryman, recommends growing it as a rambling ground cover in front of other shrubs, or in a rockery.|$|E

Alperson from Grand National Films, a newly established, {{independent}} studio, approached him to make movies for $100,000 a film and 10% of the profits. Cagney made two films for Grand National: Great Guy and Something to Sing About. He received good reviews for both, but overall the production quality was not up to Warner Bros. standards, and the films did not <b>do</b> <b>well.</b> A third film, Dynamite, was planned, but Grand National ran out of money.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{having lost}} 5–0 to the West Indies {{in each of}} the two most recent series, England had grounds for {{optimism}} leading up to the Test series: the West Indian team was ageing and lacked a leg-spinner; and the England team had home advantage.

Seeds do not require any treatment prior to sowing, and take 21 to 35 days to germinate.|$|E
