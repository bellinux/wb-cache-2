40|$|Several {{designs of}} a {{manufacturing}} {{line for the}} production of extruded foods were developed and compared with the current production line design. The manufacturing line consisted of six unit opera-tions: batching, grinding, extruding, drying, further processing, and packing. The authors performed the comparisons by simulating the current design and the proposed alternatives. The alternatives consisted of modifications to the <b>extruder-dryer</b> and/or packing line designs. The simulation results indicated that all the alternate designs roughly doubled system throughput compared to current de-signs but did not differ significantly in performance among themselves. The doubled output is worth about $ 2. 5 million per year. This is easily enough to justify the cost of new equipment. One design would cost less to implement than the others and thus was the preferred option...|$|E
