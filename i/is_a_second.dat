5|$|A quadrangular castle, Bodiam {{is roughly}} square-shaped. This type of castle, {{with a central}} {{courtyard}} and buildings against the curtain wall, was characteristic of castle architecture in the 14th century. Bodiam Castle {{has been described by}} military historian Cathcart King as the most complete surviving example of a quadrangular castle. There are circular towers at each of the four corners, with square central towers in the south, east, and west walls. The main entrance is a twin-towered gatehouse in the north face of the castle. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> entrance from the south; the postern gate is through a square tower {{in the middle of the}} south wall. The towers are three storeys high, taller than the curtain walls and the buildings in the castle which are two storeys high.|$|E
5|$|Above {{the hall}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> hall, forming {{part of the}} Duchess' suite of rooms. An oratory in the south wall, {{overlooking}} the courtyard, contains a piscina and credence niche. The oratory gives access to mural passages leading to the walkway along the curtain wall. The timber ceiling of the Duchess' hall, and the timber floors and roof above, are of the 1880s. The upper parts of the stonework are among the repairs dating from 1580.|$|E
5|$|All Saints' parish {{church was}} rebuilt in 1873 {{and is a}} grade II listed building. James Oglethorpe, {{the founder of the}} state of Georgia, now part of the United States of America, is buried with his wife at the centre of its chancel. The area around the church forms a {{conservation}} area. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> church called St Luke's further north on Front Lane. Cranham Hall, the former manor house, is a grade II listed building. There are two community associations that are both registered charities. The Cranham Community Association operates a broad range of sporting, self-improvement and hobby activities at Cranham Community Centre on Marlborough Gardens. Cranham Social Hall, with a capacity of 100, is separately operated by the Front Lane Community Association, and provides a limited range of activities. The main cultural and entertainment facilities of the borough are located in Hornchurch and Romford.|$|E

Sato discovers that there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> lesser-evolved yet unaffected race, the Menk, who live alongside the Valakians. Phlox makes the startling discovery that the Valakians are slowly dying out, not from an easily curable medical condition, but because of a genetic disease which is experiencing an accelerated rate of mutation. He also believes that the answer to a cure may lie in the Menk.|$|E
5|$|Febuxostat is {{typically}} only recommended {{in those who}} cannot tolerate allopurinol. Probenecid appears to be less effective than allopurinol and <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> line agent. Probenecid may be used if undersecretion of uric acid is present (24-hour urine uric acid less than 800mg). It is, however, not recommended if a person {{has a history of}} kidney stones. Pegloticase is an option for the 3% of people who are intolerant to other medications. It is a third line agent. Pegloticase is administered as an intravenous infusion every two weeks, and reduces uric acid levels. Pegloticase is useful decreasing tophi but has a high rate of side effects and many people develop resistance to it. In 2016 it was withdrawn from the European market.|$|E

5|$|Real-time {{holography}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> {{method of}} creating holographic interferograms. A holograph of the unstressed object is created. This holograph is illuminated with a reference beam {{to generate a}} hologram image of the object directly superimposed over the original object itself while the object is being subjected to some stress. The object waves from this hologram image will interfere with new waves coming from the object. This technique allows real time monitoring of shape changes.|$|E
5|$|Succinate-Q oxidoreductase, {{also known}} as complex II or succinate dehydrogenase, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> entry point to the {{electron}} transport chain. It is unusual {{because it is the}} only enzyme that is part of both the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain. Complex II consists of four protein subunits and contains a bound flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor, iron–sulfur clusters, and a heme group that does not participate in electron transfer to coenzyme Q, but is believed to be important in decreasing production of reactive oxygen species. It oxidizes succinate to fumarate and reduces ubiquinone. As this reaction releases less energy than the oxidation of NADH, complex II does not transport protons across the membrane and does not contribute to the proton gradient.|$|E
5|$|The {{layout of}} the complex, however, differs {{significantly}} from that of earlier complexes. Indeed, it is organized on a north–south axis rather than an east–west one: the high temple is located south of the main pyramid and its structures are turned away from it. Furthermore, a small offering chapel is adjoining the eastern base of the pyramid, a configuration otherwise unattested since offering chapels usually occupy the inner sanctum of the mortuary temple. Finally, immediately {{to the south of}} Userkaf's funerary enclosure <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> smaller pyramid complex attributed to his wife, queen Neferhetepes.|$|E

5|$|In Montana, {{municipalities}} {{are divided}} into four classes by state statute based on their population. Members of the three largest classes are deemed cities, while {{the members of the}} fourth class are called towns. Cities and towns are classified {{at the time of their}} organization, and are reorganized when they change classification due to an increase or decrease in population. A place may incorporate as a town with the support of 300 electors or two-thirds of the registered electors. A municipality with a population between 1,000 and 5,000 people is a Third Class city. A municipality with a population between 5,000 and 10,000 people <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>Second</b> Class city. And a municipality with a population over 10,000 people is a First Class city. Under certain exceptions municipalities with a population of between 9,000 and 10,000 may elect by resolution to be either a First or Second Class city. Under similar exceptions municipalities with a population of between 5,000 and 7,500 may elect by resolution to be either a Second or Third Class city. Municipalities with a population of between 1,000 and 2,500 may by resolution be classified as either a town or Third Class city. Unincorporated places such as census-designated places fall outside this scheme, and are subject to county governance, and thus are not towns or cities.|$|E
5|$|On Halloween, Millennium Group member Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) is carving a jack-o'-lantern while {{preparing}} {{to take his}} daughter Jordan (Brittany Tiplady) trick-or-treating. As he leaves to collect her, he notices a demonic figure watching him from across the street. That night, Jordan deliberately passes by one house, telling Black that it is haunted. Black tells her {{there are no such}} thing as ghosts, but is reminded of a moment from his past. In a flashback, we see a five-year-old Black being dared by his friends to knock the door of the same house; a man named Crocell (Dean Winters) answers and invites Black inside. Crocell <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>Second</b> World War veteran, and he explains the meaning of Halloween to Black, telling the boy that it is the one night of the year that ghosts walk among the living. Crocell hopes that it is his chance to commune with the friends he lost in the war, and is dismayed when the young Black dismisses the possibility of ghosts.|$|E
5|$|Shapiro {{responds}} to Goodin's argument by challenging his factual assumption that individuals would starve if they refused the workfare throffer. In state-sponsored (see welfare state) workfare systems, he claims, only monetary assistance is eliminated by {{a refusal to}} accept the throffer, while in private systems (that is, non-state charities or organisations offering conditional aid), other groups than the one operating a workfare system exist. In either system, recipients of welfare may also turn {{to family and friends}} for help. For these reasons, he does not consider the throffer to be unrefusable in the cases in which Goodin believes it <b>is.</b> <b>A</b> <b>second</b> (and, Shapiro claims, more important) objection is also presented. State welfare without sanctions fails to mirror the way that working individuals who do not rely on welfare payments take responsibility for their lives. If a person who works stops working, Shapiro observes, then they will typically find their economic situation worsened. Unconditional state welfare does not reflect this, and instead reflects the unusual position of the person who would be no worse off if they refused to work. As unconditional welfare does not mirror the situation of ordinary workers, it is unable {{to determine whether or not}} people are willing to take responsibility for their lives.|$|E
