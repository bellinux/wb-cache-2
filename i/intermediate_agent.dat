Exchange or commerce, as such, is always costly; {{the sum of the}} value of the goods being diminished by the cost of their conveyance, and by the maintenance of the persons employed in it. So that it is only when there is advantage to both producers (in getting the one thing for the other), greater than the loss in conveyance, that the exchange is expedient. And it is only justly conducted when the porters kept by the producers (commonly called merchants) look only for pay, and not for profit. For in just commerce there are but three parties--the two persons or societies exchanging and the agent or agents of exchange: the value of the things to be exchanged is known by both the exchangers, and each receives equivalent value, neither gaining nor losing (for whatever one gains the other loses). The <b>intermediate</b> <b>agent</b> is paid an equal and known percentage by both, partly for labour in conveyance, partly for care, knowledge, and risk; every attempt at concealment of the amount of the pay indicates either effort on the part of the agent to obtain exorbitant percentage, or effort on the part of the exchangers to refuse him a just one. But for the most part it is the first, namely, the effort on the part of the merchant to obtain larger profit (so called) by buying cheap and selling dear. Some part, indeed, of this larger gain is deserved, and might be openly demanded, because it is the reward of the merchant's knowledge, and foresight of probable necessity; but the greater part of such gain is unjust; and unjust in this most fatal way, that it depends first on keeping the exchangers ignorant of the exchange value of the articles, and secondly, on taking advantage of the buyer's need and the seller's poverty. It is, therefore, one of the essential, and quite the most fatal, forms of usury; for usury means merely taking an exorbitant sum for the use of anything, and it is no matter whether the exorbitance is on loan or exchange, in rent or in price--the essence of the usury being that it is obtained by advantage of opportunity or necessity, and not as due reward for labour.

40|$|Abstract. Coordination of task execution, in open {{distributed}} multi-agent systems, {{is often}} accomplished through communications between agents. Thus, most tasks carry some cost associated with those communications. The {{work in this}} article proposes to use overhearing for reducing some of this cost, and therefore reducing the overall cost of task execution. Since in open distributed systems, and in particular in large-scale settings, it is rare for two agents to communicate directly, their communications (as in real-world networks) are routed to their destination through other agents. We allow those <b>intermediate</b> <b>agents</b> to overhear and monitor passing through communications. In doing so, the <b>intermediate</b> <b>agents</b> detect some of the errors generated by communicating agents before they reach their final destination. Filtering those erroneous messages in advance reduces the cost associated with routing them through the system. This work first formalizes this problem, and then proposes algorithms for finding an effective set of filtering agents. Unfortunately, finding an optimal solution for this problem {{turned out to be}} intractable. Thus, an efficient heuristic solution is proposed. An empirical simulation of these algorithms shows that the heuristic algorithm achieves similar performance to that of the optimal algorithm, while maintaining efficient run-time complexity. ...|$|R

METHODS: Composite disks (8 x 4 mm) of Gradia Direct Anterior (N = 15) and Filtek Supreme XT (N = 15), stored in a saline solution at 37 degrees C for 1 month, were sandblasted (Microetcher, 50 microm-Al 2 O 3), cleaned (35 % H 3 PO 4), and randomly divided into five groups (N = 3) according to the <b>intermediate</b> <b>agent</b> applied. Two flowable composites (Gradia LoFlo; Filtek Supreme XT Flow) and two adhesives (Adper Scotchbond 1 XT, Scotchbond Multi-Purpose) were used. As a control, no <b>intermediate</b> <b>agent</b> was applied. Each disk was incrementally repaired (8 x 8 mm) with the same resin as the respective substrate.

Depending on the <b>intermediate</b> <b>agent</b> applied, two subgroups were created: (A) three-step adhesive system; (B) prehydrolyzed silane coupling agent + three-step adhesive system. Microtensile bond strength measurements were performed and the data were statistically analyzed with Kruskall-Wallis Analysis of Variance and Dunn's multiple range test for post hoc comparisons (p < 0. 05). Failure mode was evaluated with a scanning electron microscope. Changes in composite surface topography after H 2 O 2 treatment were also investigated. Composite repair strength did not benefit from H 2 O 2 treatment and adhesive application. Preliminary sandblasting significantly improved interfacial bond strength regardless of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>agent</b> applied. No changes in surface texture were produced after H 2 O 2 treatment. An atypical fracture pattern was detected at the interfacial level between H 2 O 2 -treated composite surfaces and the overlying adhesive and composite.

One of the most popular strategies is logistics sharing, which is a complex problem due to the involved stakeholders. Moreover, the current several transport operations are extremely expensive due to the empty return. For these reasons, a decision support system is needed to enhance or predict the system optimum and the best strategies of each stakeholder in the context of logistics sharing schemas. In this paper, we will discuss how a Knowledge Management System methodology can be developed for a real case study from the project between Northern Thailand and Southern China which will be used in our study. In parallel, we will show how we model the agent from the analysed data in order to use in our Multi-Agent Simulation in the next phase. The agents will be defined such as transport <b>agents,</b> <b>intermediate</b> <b>agents</b> and customers, among others...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{solutions}} to deter copyright violations consists of embedding hard to detect watermarks in digital media. Current developments have focused on how to embed wa-termarks, and on one-to-one exchanges on how to securely convey tagged data to the end consumer. Assuming a large customer base or predistributed media, it may become pro-hibitively expensive or time consuming to tag each separate copy of data individually before it is delivered to the cus-tomer. We present two mechanisms that allow the preparation and distribution of tagged data in a more scalable way than existing approaches. The first one, called hierarchi-cal tagging, is preferable for on-line multi-level distribu-tion, where producer and consumer are not in direct con-tact, but <b>intermediate</b> <b>agents</b> provide distribution channels and sales platforms. The second method is well suited to pre-produced bulk-media distribution (such as through CDROMs or DVDs), with only small amounts of on-line in-formation being transferred to each consumer. We call it bulk-tagging. ...|$|R

Our environment corresponds to the activities of the social rehabilitation and lodging houses, of the "Missions locales", the Structures of insertion by the economic activity in the department of Vienne in France. Influenced by the functionalist thought, the speech of the social speakers on themselves locates them like complementary <b>intermediate</b> <b>agents</b> for social cohesion and solidarity. On the contrary, our assumption is that of a heterogeneity of trades ands contradictions. We are then vis-à-vis with the competing spaces marked by an unequal distribution of resources. It is then question of trying to break with the attribution of a legitimacy of principle. Our step of observation must update the variety of the interactions near the users, within the teams of social speakers ans with the other institutions to identify the professional models.
