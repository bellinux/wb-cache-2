5|$|As a child, {{director}} Pete Docter relocated {{with his}} family to Denmark when his father moved to study the music of Carl Nielsen. While his sisters <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> time adjusting to the new surroundings, Docter felt he was judged constantly by peers. While other kids were interested in sports, Docter sat alone drawing, a hobby that eventually led him to animation. His social anxiety ended by high school.|$|E

Soldiers from the battalion lined the route from his pen to the trailer {{as he left the}} camp for the last time, in ceremonial dress that included a silver headdress which was a gift from the queen in 1955. Billy was taken to Whipsnade Zoo in Bedfordshire, where keepers say he <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> life at the Children's Farm.|$|E
5|$|In 1846, the United States went to {{war against}} Mexico and sent a naval and land {{expedition}} to conquer Alta California. At first they <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> time of it capturing the major ports including San Diego, but the Californios in southern Alta California struck back. Following the successful revolt in Los Angeles, the American garrison at San Diego was driven out without firing a shot in early October 1846. Mexican partisans held San Diego for three weeks until October 24, 1846, when the Americans recaptured it. For {{the next several months}} the Americans were blockaded inside the pueblo. Skirmishes occurred daily and snipers shot into the town every night. The Californios drove cattle away from the pueblo hoping to starve the Americans and their Californio supporters out. On December 1 the Americans garrison learned that the dragoons of General Stephen W. Kearney were at Warner's Ranch. Commodore Robert F. Stockton sent a mounted force of fifty under Captain Archibald Gillespie to march north to meet him. Their joint command of 150 men, returning to San Diego, encountered about 93 Californios under Andrés Pico. In the ensuing Battle of San Pasqual, fought in the San Pasqual Valley which is now part of the city of San Diego, the Americans suffered their worst losses in the campaign. Subsequently, a column led by Lieutenant Gray arrived from San Diego, rescuing Kearny's battered and blockaded command.|$|E

25|$|After this loss, the Bears <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> road {{win over}} the 0–5 Carolina Panthers before another 23–20 loss to the Seattle Seahawks. Continued {{difficulties}} with the offense and O-line led to a second straight home loss when the Redskins won 17–14 in Week 7. After the bye week, offensive coordinator Mike Martz worked to revamp the offense to compensate for Jay Cutler's lack of O-line protection. After this, they easily beat the struggling Vikings at home 27–13, followed by a 16–0 shutout of the Dolphins in Miami, handing Chicago their 700th win, a league first.|$|E

25|$|In February 1967, Colonel Hiếu {{launched}} Operation Đại Bàng 800. For {{three days}} prior to Vietnamese operation, units of the US 1st Cavalry Division were unsuccessful in discovering the enemy in their operational areas. Hiếu lured the enemy by dispatching a reduced regiment {{to set up an}} overnight camp in Phù Mỹ, knowing that enemy spies amongst the indigenous farmers would report the status of the operational troops. Hiếu positioned a motorized infantry battalion and an armored unit 10 kilometers away. Thinking they <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> target, the enemy attacked the camp with a regiment belonging to 3rd NVA Division at 2:00a.m. Alerted by the regiment's commander, Hiếu sent in the reserve forces to cut off the enemy's retreat and join forces with the defenders. After a three-hour fierce battle, the enemy reportedly left behind more than 300 dead and numerous weapons.|$|E
25|$|The right brigade of the 7th Division {{advanced}} against {{light resistance}} to the first objective (red line) but came under fire from machine-guns in the 21st Division area. As the neighbouring division came up the 91st Brigade was able to resume its advance towards In Der Ster Cabaret until fire from Joiner's Rest held them up. Reinforcements allowed the final objective (blue line) to be taken. A defensive flank was formed along Jolting Houses road and Jetty Trench, meeting the 21st Division {{to the west of}} Reutel. The left brigade <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> advance to the first objective. As the attack continued some troops crossed into the area of the 1st Australian Division, causing a gap but the German defenders were not able to exploit this and the final objective was reached. Occupation of the In Der Ster plateau gave the two divisions observation over {{the lower part of the}} valley, enfilading ground on which any counter-attack from the south against the 1st Australian Division must move.|$|E
25|$|Cobb never <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> time as {{husband and}} father. His {{children}} found {{him to be}} demanding, yet also capable of kindness and extreme warmth. He expected his sons to be exceptional athletes in general and baseball players in particular. Tyrus Raymond, Jr. flunked out of Princeton (where he had played on the varsity tennis team), much to his father's dismay. The elder Cobb subsequently traveled to the Princeton campus and beat his son with a whip to ensure against future academic failure. Tyrus Raymond, Jr. then entered Yale University and became captain of the tennis team while improving his academics, but was then arrested twice in 1930 for drunkenness and left Yale without graduating. Cobb helped his son deal with his pending legal problems, but then permanently broke off with him. Even though Tyrus Raymond, Jr. finally reformed and eventually earned an M.D. from the Medical College of South Carolina and practiced obstetrics and gynecology in Dublin, Georgia, until his premature death at 42 on September 9, 1952, from a brain tumor, his father remained distant.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{question}} of whether every P set <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> (i. e., polynomialtime computable) census function. We characterize this question in terms of unlikely collapses of language and function classes such as #P 1 ` FP, where #P 1 is the class of functions that count the witnesses for tally NP sets. We prove that every #P PH 1 function can be computed in FP #P #P 1 1. Consequently, every P set <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> census function if and only if every set in the polynomial hierarchy does. We show that the assumption #P 1 ` FP implies P = BPP and PH ` MOD k P for each k 2, which provides further evidence that not all sets in P <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> census function. We also relate a set's property of <b>having</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> census function to other well-studied properties of sets, such as rankability and scalability (the closure of the rankable sets under P-isomorphisms). Finally, we prove that it is no more likely that the census function of any set in P can be approximated (more precisely, can be n ff -e [...] ...|$|R
25|$|Despite missing {{several key}} players, D.C. United started off {{the month of}} May expecting three points in a home match against cellar-dwelling NYCFC, but the team missed some good chances to score {{in the first half}} and the visiting team punished them with 2 goals early in the second half, the first by Spanish star David Villa and the second by Khiry Shelton. 5 days later, D.C. hosted the other team from the New York region, the potent New York Red Bulls The biggest home crowd of the season turned out for this rivalry match, and the home team responded with a strong overall effort. Nyarko sent Sarvas in on goal with a terrific through ball, and Sarvas unselfishly sent a pass across the goal to a waiting Saborio, who <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> tap-in to take the lead. Worra {{delivered}} with several spectacular saves to maintain United's lead, and the team closed out the first half with a spectacular goal, as Neagle served up a sharp cross that Nyarko was able to turn into a goal with an impressive outside of the foot volley shot that sealed the 2-0 win.|$|E

500|$|The {{ships were}} good sea boats; they <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> motion and were dry {{as a result}} of their high forecastles. They had a {{tendency}} to pitch when steaming downwind, however, and made severe leeway in heavy winds because of their large superstructures. They were difficult to maneuver without the center shaft engaged. They lost only around ten percent speed in a head sea or with the rudder hard over. In addition, as the lower coal bunkers were emptied, the ships became increasingly unstable; with empty bunkers, the ships could heel over as much as fifteen degrees in a hard turn.
