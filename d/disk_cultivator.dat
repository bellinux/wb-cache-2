40|$|This project {{explored}} {{the effectiveness of}} an autoguidance system based on a real-time kinematic global positioning system (RTK GPS) accurate to the centimeter (about halfinch) in agricultural production. Our objectives were {{to determine the effect}} of spacing between <b>cultivator</b> <b>disks</b> or knives and forward tractor speed on plant damage, and of deep tillage operations on drip-tape damage. Two sets of split-plot field experiments were conducted (with processing tomato transplants and direct-seeded tomatoes) in a Yolo loam field on the UC Davis campus. No significant plant damage occurred even at 7 miles per hour (mph) forward speed and <b>cultivator</b> <b>disk</b> spacing of 2 inches from the plant line. In an additional split-plot test, there was no significant damage to drip tape when the fertilizer shank was operated 2 inches from the drip tape at 3. 5 mph. This system allows for automatic steering of the tractor and implements along a path close to buried drip-tape and/or plants without damaging them, even at high operational ground speeds...|$|R
40|$|A {{combination}} {{of physical and}} chemical methods can accelerate the reclamation process. This study was undertaken to investigate the effect of tillage implements {{in combination with the}} chemical amendments on the reclamation of saline-sodic soils. Subsoiler, chisel plough, disk plough and narrow-tine cultivator were employed. Subsoiler is found to be the most effective tillage implement for the reclamation of saline soils. Wheat emergence was maximum in sub-soiled plots followed by chisel plough, <b>disk</b> plough and <b>cultivator.</b> ECe decreased from 29. 60 to 4. 75 dS m 1 (85 %), pH 8. 1 to 7. 43 (8. 27 %), ESP 115 to 18 (84. 34 %), and SAR 92. 21 to 13. 92 (84. 90 %). The trend of ECe, pH, ESP and SAR was almost reversed after the treatments. The reclamation rate was greater with 75 % gypsum applications than that of 50...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} a {{dramatic}} shift in tillage technology used in American agriculture over the past 10 - 15 years. Conventional practices involving the multiple tillage of the soil by plow, <b>disk,</b> harrow, or <b>cultivator</b> have been eliminated or greatly reduced. In its place {{is a set of}} practices generally labeled conservation tillage. Several factors are behind this shift, but it is evident that individual farmers have led rather than followed this trend. One major factor contributing to the shift has been the production cost savings associated with conservation tillage. This paper analyzes the trends in conservation tillage acreage in the southeastern United States and looks at some of the economic factors influencing this trend. It focuses on the factors influencing both total revenues and total costs the two components of the income equation. The paper closes with a look to the future of conservation tillage...|$|R
40|$|Mechanical (<b>disk</b> and Perfecta <b>cultivator)</b> and {{chemical}} weed control strategies were compared in a Yuma, AZ lemon orchard. In addition, an optical weed sensing sprayer (WeedSeeker) was evaluated for making post-emergence Roundup Ultramax herbicide applications. The use of pre-emergence herbicides {{in conjunction with the}} WeedSeeker spray units has the potential to significantly reduce the amount of post-emergence herbicide and water needed to spray flood irrigated citrus orchards. There was a relationship between weed ground cover and the area sprayed by the WeedSeeker units that indicated the maximum herbicide saving will occur a low weed densities. The use of the Kawasaki Mule with its superior suspension system allowed for faster spraying speeds than were possible with the tractor mounted sprayer and this also reduced spray volume per plot. Weed control was similar for the conventional and the WeedSeeker sprayers. Future investigations will include efforts to improve the estimation of percent weed groundcover, the use of higher rates of pre-emergence herbicides and the development of crop budgets based on experimental operations...|$|R
40|$|Four tillage {{systems were}} {{used to measure the}} effects of tillage-induced changes on bulk density, {{penetration}} resistance, soil temperature, moisture content, surface roughness, and aggregate mean weight diameter. The four systems included, five passes with a cultivator, one pass with rotavator, two passes with disk, and one pass each with moldboard and disk. Wheat emergence count and yields were evaluated. Field experiments were conducted in three different agro-ecological regions of Pakistan. Soil types varied from sandy clay loam to clay loam. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was used at all sites. Prior to tillage, base line data for the above related physical properties were collected at three locations and at different depths in each plot. A complete randomized experimental design with three replications was used. Soil bulk density and penetration resistance were significantly affected by the tillage treatment at all three locations. A higher percentage changes in bulk density and in penetration resistance were observed in sandy clay loam than in clay loam soils. The lowest bulk density was observed for the rotavator treatment while the highest occurred in disk plots after tillage. Soil water content and soil temperature were affected by tillage. Surface roughness coefficients and water retention data indicated higher values for moldboard and lower for the rotavator. Mean weight diameters of soil aggregates were not significantly affected by the tillage treatments. Emergence was greatest in moldboard treatment followed by rotavator, then <b>disk</b> and <b>cultivator</b> treatments. Clay loam soil showed more yield differences due to tillage than did sandy clay loam soil. Higher yield in moldboard plowed plots corresponded to higher emergence, lowest penetration resistance and lowest bulk density, higher surface roughness coefficient and aggregate mean-weight-diameter. Minimum yield for cultivator and rotavator corresponded to lower emergence, higher penetration resistance and bulk density, and low surface roughness and lower aggregate mean-weight-diameter...|$|R
40|$|A three-year {{experiment}} comparing five tillage methods {{with chemical}} and green manure fertilizer and {{two levels of}} water application of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum. L) are reported in this article. Results showed that conventional tillage had the second best emergence rate and the best flowers and boll numbers and yields. Heavy and rotary cultivators gave similar yields (lower than conventional) although rotary cultivator had the best emergence rate. Disk harrow gave an emergence rate similar to the heavy cultivator but lower yield. Finally no-tillage had the lowest emergence rates and yield. Chemical fertilization gave better yield than green manure but {{the difference was not}} significant. Different application rates of irrigation water had negligible effect on yields. An economic analysis of the tillage treatments based on contractor prices, but not considering possible long-term effects on environment and soil fertility showed that farmer margins are best for conventional tillage, followed by the cultivator treatments. The results indicate that green manure can be used instead of chemical fertilizers without considerable income loss for the farmers, but with benefits to the environment and soil.

40|$|An optical weed sensing sprayer (WeedSeeker) was {{evaluated}} for making postemergence glyphosate herbicide applications in a Yuma, AZ lemon orchard. In addition, mechanical (<b>disk</b> and Perfecta <b>cultivator)</b> and {{chemical weed control}} strategies were compared. Results were fairly similar; however, {{the use of the}} WeedSeeker units combined with a preemergence herbicide (H 1) increased weed control three fold compared to disking (D) and perfecta (P 1). Additionally, when the WeedSeeker units were used in conjunction with preemergence herbicides, spray volume was reduced by 66 % compared to a conventional sprayer and by 57 % when used for postemergence applications only. There was a relationship between weed ground cover and the area sprayed by the WeedSeeker units indicating that maximum postemergence herbicide savings will occur at low weed densities or less than 10 % groundcover. The use of a sprayer with an improved suspension system allowed for faster spraying speeds than were possible with the tractor mounted sprayer. Weed control was similar for the conventional and the WeedSeeker sprayer. However, yields were variable for both years.

40|$|The use of {{agricultural}} machinery represents the main aspect {{contributing to the}} total energy input in the agricultural system. The study evaluated the energy requirements and the work quality of two conventional (threefurrow plough and spading machine) and of four conservation implements (rotary harrow, subsoiler, <b>disk</b> harrow, combined <b>cultivator)</b> for mediumdeep primary tillage in a silty-clay soil, widespread in Central Italy. The tests were carried out {{with the aim of}} selecting the most energy-efficient implement. Working speed, force of traction, fuel consumption and energy demands were measured, using a 205 kW instrumented tractor. Cloddiness and roughness of the tilled soil, biomass coverage index and burying degree were evaluated. The conservation tillage implements gave the best results in fuel consumption and energy requirements respect to the conventional implements, with energy savings up to 86 % in the case of disk harrow. The rotary harrow showed intermediate values and the best soil refinement. Among the conservation implements, the disk harrow showed the best performance on biomass coverage index (43. 8 %), while the combined cultivator showed the highest value of biomass burying (87. 8 %) and the best performance on fuel consumption per hour (25. 8 kg h – 1) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} three tillage {{implements}} (field <b>cultivator,</b> <b>disk</b> harrow, rotary harrow) {{on the soil}} incorporation of various herbicides and consequently on the efficacy of these herbicides against the weeds and on their selectivity on cotton, was evaluated in four field experiments conducted in Northern Greece during 2003 and 2004. All experimental plots were irrigated with sprinklers, immediately after the pre-emergence application of herbicides, while later all plots were irrigated with either drip irrigation or mobile sprinklers. The herbicide treatments consisted of a broadcast preplant-incorporated (PPI) application of s-metolachlor or trifluralin followed by pre-emergence (PRE) applied prometryn, a pre-emergence 38 cm band application of s-metolachlor + fluometuron and a broadcast PPI application of s-metolachlor followed by post-emergence applied trifloxysulfuron-sodium or pyrithiobac. The PPI application of s-metolachlor or trifluralin followed by PRE application of prometryn resulted the greatest control of redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.), common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.) and black nightshade (Solanum nigrum L.). The efficacy of herbicides against common lambsquarters and black nightshade was slightly reduced when they were incorporated into the soil with the rotary harrow. Cotton plant emergence, number of bolls, boll opening and cotton lint yield were not affected in most cases by the tillage implement. Cotton lint yield in plots irrigated with drip irrigation was higher or equal with plots irrigated with sprinklers. The effect of three tillage implements (field <b>cultivator,</b> <b>disk</b> harrow, rotary harrow) and various herbicides was also evaluated in two field experiments conducted in Northern Greece during 2006 and 2007. Herbicide treatments included the pre-plant incorporation of s-metolachlor + fluometuron, trifluralin + fluometuron, ethalfluralin, pendimethalin + fluometuron, fluometuron. Irrigation with sprinklers was not made after cotton sowing. Cotton lint yield in plots treated with preplant incorporated s-metolachlor + fluometuron was equal to plots treated with trifluralin + fluometuron or pendimethalin + fluometuron, but significantly higher than plots treated with ethalfluralin or fluometuron. The incorporation of herbicides in the soil with disk harrow or field cultivator compared to rotary harrow, provided higher efficacy against some weeds and similar effect on cotton plant emergence, number of bolls, bolls opening and cotton lint yield. In addition, the fossil-fuel and labor time requirements of disk harrow and field cultivator were {{lower than that of}} rotary harrow. The findings of this study showed that the herbicides trifluralin, s-metolachlor or pendimethalin in tank mix with fluometuron or prometryn should be used for effective control of broad leaved weeds in cotton. Finally, drip irrigation combined with the PPI application of s-metolachlor or pendimethalin in tank mix with fluometuron and incorporated in the soil with field <b>cultivator</b> or <b>disk</b> harrow should be the first choice of cotton growers in integrated crop management systems. ...|$|R
40|$|If 2 ̆ 2 tillage 2 ̆ 2 {{is defined}} as the {{mechanical}} manipulation of soil, it follows, then, that a 2 ̆ 2 tillage system 2 ̆ 2 would be the sequence of soil-manipulation operations performed in producing a crop. Today, however, such a definition is recognized as inadequate. We know, for instance, that the management of non-harvested plant tissue (i. e., residue) affects both crop production and soil erosion, and that field operations in which the soil is not tilled have a marked influence on soil condition. Therefore, in this publication, a tillage system is the sequence of all operations involved in producing the crop, including soil manipulation, harvesting, chopping or shredding of residue, application of pesticides and fertilizers, etc. But before describing and comparing the various tillage systems for corn, some terminologies and possible points of confusion need to be addressed. These have to do with primary vs. secondary tillage and the different ways in which similar tillage systems could be defined. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY TILLAGE For many tillage systems, the specific operations can be separated into 2 ̆ 2 primary 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 secondary. 2 ̆ 2 Primary tillage loosens and fractures the soil to reduce soil strength and to bring or mix residues and fertilizers into the tilled layer. The implements (2 ̆ 2 tools 2 ̆ 2) used for primary tillage include moldboard, chisel and disk plows; heavy tandem, offset and one -way disks; subsoilers; and heavy -duty, powered rotary tillers. These tools usually operate deeper and produce a rougher soil surface than do secondary tillage tools; however, they differ from each other as to amount of soil manipulation and amount of residue left on or near the surface. Secondary tillage is used to kill weeds, cut and cover crop residue, incorporate herbicides and prepare a seedbed. The tools include light- and medium -weight <b>disks,</b> field <b>cultivators,</b> rotary hoes, drags, powered and unpowered harrows and rotary tillers, rollers, ridge- or bed -forming implements, and numerous variations or combinations of these. They operate at a shallower depth than primary tillage tools and provide additional soil pulverization. Equipment that permits primary and/or secondary tillage plus planting in a single operation is also available...|$|R
40|$|Selecting the tillage system {{best suited}} to a {{particular}} farming situation is an important management decision. Formerly, the traditional system was a moldboard plow operation followed by several secondary tillage operations before planting. This system can be appropriate for poorly drained soils having little or no slope and low erosion potential. However, plowing has several disadvantages. The potential for soil erosion is high on sloping lands, and labor and fuel requirements can be substantially higher than with other tillage and planting systems. Today, conservation tillage systems are used to reduce preplant tillage operations, thus reducing soil erosion and moisture loss while saving labor and fuel. The label 2 ̆ 2 conservation tillage 2 ̆ 2 represents {{a broad spectrum of}} farming methods, and is most often defined by the amount of residue cover remaining on the soil surface. The minimum amount recommended is 20 to 30 percent after planting. Research in Nebraska and other Midwestern states has shown that leaving at least this much residue will reduce erosion by more than 50 percent of that occurring from a cleanly tilled field. To achieve effective erosion control, this minimum residue cover should be maintained during the critical soil erosion period between spring seedbed preparation and crop canopy establishment. Conservation tillage does not necessarily require new equipment. Most conventional farm implements can be used. For corn, grain sorghum, or wheat residue, one or two passes with a field <b>cultivator,</b> <b>disk,</b> or chisel plow will usually leave more than the 20 percent minimum cover. Additional operations reduce the amount of residue, and thus reduce erosion control. Other tillage and planting systems such as ridge-plant (till-plant) and no till leave even more residue, and thus offer greater erosion control. However, no-till planting is the only method that consistently leaves the minimum surface cover in the more fragile and less abundant soybean residue. No single tillage system is best for all situations at all times. Selecting the best tillage system for a particular soil and cropping situation requires matching the operation to the crop sequence, topography, and soil type. Rotating systems to coincide with crop rotations often provides an excellent combination. For example, a no till system could follow soybeans while a chisel or disk system might follow corn. This tillage rotation provides the best erosion control following soybeans, and provides an opportunity for some tillage in the less fragile and more abundant corn residue...|$|R
