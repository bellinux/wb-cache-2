40|$|Mastergradsoppgave i bedriftsøkonomi - Høgskolen i Bodø, 2007 Low-cost flights per se {{become more}} and more popular in the world airline industry, while in Russia the first {{low-cost}} carrier has recently appeared. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to investigate the phenomenon of low-cost carriers, peculiarities of the development of the low-cost airlines in the context of Russian Federation and Norway. In order to cover the topic, deep literature review and qualitative research were carried out. In the paper, I attempted to follow history, analyze reasons for low-cost flights, advantages and disadvantages of low-cost carriers, scrutinize perspectives and peculiarities of the low-cost airline market in Russia and Norway, and analyze future opportunities. Under these circumstances, case study method and interviews as primary information sources and reports and articles written by airline experts as secondary sources were used. Two companies were under the research: Sky Express – a Russian low-cost airline company launched the market this year, and a Norwegian low-cost airline company, a member of European Low <b>Fares</b> Airline <b>Association,</b> Norwegian Air Shuttle. Deep literature review concerning low-cost airlines and empirical findings showed that the phenomenon of low fares has its peculiarities on a particular market.

40|$|Our aims were {{to provide}} the first {{national}} estimates of physical activity (PA) for Vietnam, and to investigate issues affecting their accuracy. Measurements were made using the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ) on a nationally-representative sample of 14706 participants (46. 5 % males, response 64. 1 %) aged 25 - 64 years selected by multi-stage stratified cluster sampling. Approximately 20 % of Vietnamese people had no measureable PA during a typical week, but 72. 9 % (men) and 69. 1 % (women) met WHO recommendations for PA by adults for their age. On average, 52. 0 (men) and 28. 0 (women) Metabolic Equivalent Task (MET) -hours/week (largely from work activities) were reported. Work and total PA were higher in rural areas and varied by season. Less than 2 % of respondents provided incomplete information, but an additional one-in-six provided unrealistically high values of PA. Those responsible for reporting errors included persons from rural areas and all those with unstable work patterns. Box-Cox transformation (with an appropriate constant added) was the most successful method of reducing the influence of large values, but energy-scaled values were most strongly associated with pathophysiological outcomes. Around seven-in-ten Vietnamese people aged 25 - 64 years met WHO recommendations for total PA, which was mainly from work activities and higher in rural areas. Nearly all respondents were able to report their activity using the GPAQ, but with some exaggerated values and seasonal variation in reporting. Data transformation provided plausible summary values, but energy-scaling <b>fared</b> best in <b>association</b> analyses...|$|R
