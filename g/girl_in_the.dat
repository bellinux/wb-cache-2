5|$|In 1928, Hu Die {{declined}} to renew her contract with Tianyi, and {{signed with the}} rival Mingxing (Star) Film Company, led by the shrewd businessman and director Zhang Shichuan, and the talented writer Zheng Zhengqiu. She had a salary of $1,000 a month, a large sum at the time. Her first film with Mingxing was Tower in the White Clouds (1928). She befriended her co-star Ruan Lingyu; the two women would become China's biggest film stars of the 1930s. Her role as Red <b>Girl</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film The Burning of the Red Lotus Temple (1928) propelled her to stardom. The film was such a success that the studio made 17 sequels {{of the same name}} between 1928 and 1931. It started a craze for martial arts films, but also attracted criticism from intellectuals when children neglected their schoolwork to study martial arts or devote themselves to martial arts fiction.|$|E

Bardot was also photographed wearing a bikini on the beach during the 1953 Cannes Film Festival.

The game is presented from a first-person perspective, with pre-rendered backgrounds and 2D character portraits accompanying the text. The visuals mostly consist of still images, but with characters often changing their expression while talking.|$|E

Following this incident, the couple split up, although Riya denied that she was the <b>girl</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> MMS clip.

5|$|Samantha Claire Taylor {{was born}} in Amersham, Buckinghamshire on 25 September 1975, {{as part of a}} {{sporting}} family: her father played rugby, and her mother played hockey.

She subsequently moved to The Abbey School, Reading for a short time, and finally Kendrick School. Although she primarily played hockey as a teenager, at which she represented England at Under-17 and Under-19 as a forward, she began playing women's county cricket for Thames Valley, making her debut for the side in May 1993.|$|E

30|$|The interrelations {{for student}} and home {{characteristics}} with ‘Students’ Attitude Toward Reading’ remain nearly stable. Thus, {{the number of}} Books at Home, the amount of Reading at Home and the variable Borrow Books from a Library are overall significant predictors of reading attitudes, except for <b>girls</b> <b>in</b> France and <b>girls</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Netherlands for the last variable. Moreover, nearly all boys’ models (except for Italy) and <b>the</b> model for <b>girls</b> <b>in</b> France reveal a positive interrelation with the variables Parents Like Reading and Students’ Attitude Toward Reading. When considering classroom- and school-related factors, there was no commonly shared interrelation for boys and <b>girls</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> four countries. The number of years a teacher has been teaching shows a significant linkage for boys in Italy and Germany. The availability of a Classroom Library is a relevant predictor for boys <b>in</b> Italy and <b>girls</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Netherlands. Moreover, {{the availability of a}} School Library shows a significant interrelation only for <b>girls</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Netherlands, whereas the Use of Software for Reading Instruction is relevant for <b>girls</b> <b>in</b> France regarding their attitude toward reading.|$|R

5|$|Well-known screenwriter Lillie Hayward, and {{newcomer}} Roberta Hodes, {{were hired}} {{to adapt the}} novel for film.

Noting Terhune's frequent disdain for the Ramapough Mountain Indians, they named the film's villain Jackson White, a play on the nickname {{used to refer to}} those people. White became the catch all villain of the film, who poaches deer, sets fire to the Tremayne barn, and break into the house to try to steal a gold trophy won by Lad.|$|E
