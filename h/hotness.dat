5|$|Cabernet Sauvignon {{is a very}} {{bold and}} {{assertive}} wine that has potential to overwhelm light and delicate dishes. The wine's high tannin content {{as well as the}} oak influences and high alcohol levels associated with many regional styles play important roles in influencing how well the wine matches with different foods. When Cabernet Sauvignon is young, all those elements are at their peak, but as the wine ages it mellows; possibilities for different food pairings open up. In most circumstances, matching the weight (alcohol level and body) of the wine to the heaviness of the food is an important consideration. Cabernet Sauvignons with high alcohol levels do not pair well with spicy foods due to <b>hotness</b> levels of the capsaicins present in spices like chili peppers being enhanced by the alcohol with the heat accentuating the bitterness of the tannins. Milder spices, such as black pepper, pair better due to their ability to minimize the perception of tannins—such as in the classic pairings of Cabernet Sauvignon with steak au poivre and pepper-crusted ahi tuna.|$|E
25|$|According to Denbigh, the {{property}} of <b>hotness</b> is a concern of thermodynamics that should be defined {{without reference to the}} concept of heat. Consideration of <b>hotness</b> leads to the concept of empirical temperature. All physical systems are capable of heating or cooling others. This does not require that they have thermodynamic temperatures. With reference to <b>hotness,</b> the comparative terms hotter and colder are defined by the rule that heat flows from the hotter body to the colder.|$|E
25|$|This {{statement}} {{helps to}} define temperature {{but it does}} not, by itself, complete the definition. An empirical temperature is a numerical scale for the <b>hotness</b> of a thermodynamic system. Such <b>hotness</b> may be defined as existing on a one-dimensional manifold, stretching between hot and cold. Sometimes the zeroth law is stated to include {{the existence of a}} unique universal <b>hotness</b> manifold, and of numerical scales on it, so as to provide a complete definition of empirical temperature. To be suitable for empirical thermometry, a material must have a monotonic relation between <b>hotness</b> and some easily measured state variable, such as pressure or volume, when all other relevant coordinates are fixed. An exceptionally suitable system is the ideal gas, which can provide a temperature scale that matches the absolute Kelvin scale. The Kelvin scale is defined {{on the basis of the}} second law of thermodynamics.|$|E
25|$|Physical {{systems that}} are too {{turbulent}} to have temperatures may still differ in <b>hotness.</b> A physical system that passes heat to another physical system {{is said to be}} the hotter of the two. More is required for the system to have a thermodynamic temperature. Its behavior must be so regular that its empirical temperature is the same for all suitably calibrated and scaled thermometers, and then its <b>hotness</b> is said to lie on the one-dimensional <b>hotness</b> manifold. This is part of the reason why heat is defined following Carathéodory and Born, solely as occurring other than by work or transfer of matter; temperature is advisedly and deliberately not mentioned in this now widely accepted definition.|$|E
25|$|In Asian {{countries}} {{within the}} sphere of mainly Chinese and Indian cultural influence, pungency (piquancy or <b>hotness)</b> had traditionally been considered a sixth basic taste. In 2015, researchers at Purdue University suggested a new basic taste (of fats) called oleogustus.|$|E
25|$|For {{experimental}} physics, <b>hotness</b> means that, {{when comparing}} any two given bodies {{in their respective}} separate thermodynamic equilibria, any two suitably given empirical thermometers with numerical scale readings will agree as to which is the hotter of the two given bodies, or {{that they have the}} same temperature. This does not require the two thermometers to have a linear relation between their numerical scale readings, but it does require that the relation between their numerical readings shall be strictly monotonic. A definite sense of greater <b>hotness</b> can be had, independently of calorimetry, of thermodynamics, and of properties of particular materials, from Wien's displacement law of thermal radiation: the temperature of a bath of thermal radiation is proportional, by a universal constant, to the frequency of the maximum of its frequency spectrum; this frequency is always positive, but can have values that tend to zero. Thermal radiation is initially defined for a cavity in thermodynamic equilibrium. These physical facts justify a mathematical statement that <b>hotness</b> exists on an ordered one-dimensional manifold. This is a fundamental character of temperature and thermometers for bodies in their own thermodynamic equilibrium.|$|E
25|$|Functionally, such {{engines are}} used in two ways, {{distinguishing}} a target reservoir and a resource or surrounding reservoir. A heat pump transfers heat, to the hot reservoir as the target, from the resource or surrounding reservoir. A refrigerator transfers heat, from the cold reservoir as the target, to the resource or surrounding reservoir. The target reservoir may be regarded as leaking: when the target leaks <b>hotness</b> to the surroundings, heat pumping is used; when the target leaks coldness to the surroundings, refrigeration is used. The engines harness work to overcome the leaks.|$|E
25|$|While for {{bodies in}} their own {{thermodynamic}} equilibrium states, the notion of temperature requires that all empirical thermometers must agree as to which of two bodies is the hotter or that {{they are at the}} same temperature, this requirement is not safe for bodies that are in steady states though not in thermodynamic equilibrium. It can then well be that different empirical thermometers disagree about which is the hotter, and if this is so, then {{at least one of the}} bodies does not have a well defined absolute thermodynamic temperature. Nevertheless, any one given body and any one suitable empirical thermometer can still support notions of empirical, non-absolute, <b>hotness</b> and temperature, for a suitable range of processes. This is a matter for study in non-equilibrium thermodynamics.|$|E
25|$|Islamic {{philosophers}} {{also made}} great contributions to alchemical hermeticism. The most influential author {{in this regard}} was arguably Jabir. Jabir's ultimate goal was Takwin, the artificial creation {{of life in the}} alchemical laboratory, up to, and including, human life. He analyzed each Aristotelian element in terms of four basic qualities of <b>hotness,</b> coldness, dryness, and moistness. According to Jabir, in each metal two of these qualities were interior and two were exterior. For example, lead was externally cold and dry, while gold was hot and moist. Thus, Jabir theorized, by rearranging the qualities of one metal, a different metal would result. By this reasoning, the search for the philosopher's stone was introduced to Western alchemy. Jabir developed an elaborate numerology whereby the root letters of a substance's name in Arabic, when treated with various transformations, held correspondences to the element's physical properties.|$|E
25|$|For axiomatic {{treatment}} of thermodynamic equilibrium, since the 1930s, {{it has become}} customary {{to refer to a}} zeroth law of thermodynamics. The customarily stated minimalist version of such a law postulates only that all bodies, which when thermally connected would be in thermal equilibrium, should be said to have the same temperature by definition, but by itself does not establish temperature as a quantity expressed as a real number on a scale. A more physically informative version of such a law views empirical temperature as a chart on a <b>hotness</b> manifold. While the zeroth law permits the definitions of many different empirical scales of temperature, the second law of thermodynamics selects the definition of a single preferred, absolute temperature, unique up to an arbitrary scale factor, whence called the thermodynamic temperature. If internal energy is considered {{as a function of the}} volume and entropy of a homogeneous system in thermodynamic equilibrium, thermodynamic absolute temperature appears as the partial derivative of internal energy with respect the entropy at constant volume. Its natural, intrinsic origin or null point is absolute zero at which the entropy of any system is at a minimum. Although this is the lowest absolute temperature described by the model, the third law of thermodynamics postulates that absolute zero cannot be attained by any physical system.|$|E
25|$|Oresme's most {{important}} contributions to mathematics {{are contained in}} Tractatus de configurationibus qualitatum et motuum. In a quality, or accidental form, such as heat, he distinguished the intensio (the degree of heat at each point) and the extensio (as {{the length of the}} heated rod). These two terms were often replaced by latitudo and longitudo. For the sake of clarity, Oresme conceived the idea of visualizing these concepts by plane figures, approaching what we would now call rectangular co-ordinates. The intensity of the quality was represented by a length or latitudo proportional to the intensity erected perpendicular to the base at a given point on the base line, which represents the longitudo. Oresme proposed that the geometrical form of such a figure could be regarded as corresponding to a characteristic of the quality itself. Oresme defined a uniform quality as that which is represented by a line parallel to the longitude, and any other quality as difform. Uniformly varying qualities are represented by a straight line inclined to the axis of the longitude, while he described many cases of nonuniformly varying qualities. Oresme extended this doctrine to figures of three dimensions. He considered this analysis applicable to many different qualities such as <b>hotness,</b> whiteness, and sweetness. Significantly for later developments, Oresme applied this concept to the analysis of local motion where the latitudo or intensity represented the speed, the longitudo represented the time, and the area of the figure represented the distance travelled.|$|E

500|$|Several critics {{found the}} lack of an {{anthropomorphic}} point of view hurt the book's relevance. Robert Braile in The Boston Globe wrote that it has [...] "no real context ... no rationale for probing this fantasy other than [...] unsubstantiated premise that people find it fascinating". Michael Grunwald in The Washington Post also questioned the premise: [...] "Imagining the human footprint on a post-human planet might be fun for dormitory potheads who have already settled the questions of God's existence and Fergie's <b>hotness,</b> but it's not clear why the rest of us need this level of documentary evidence". On the other hand, Alanna Mitchell in the Globe and Mail review found relevance in the context of society's passiveness to resource depletion combined with an anthropomorphic vanity. She writes the [...] "book [...] designed to help us find the how of survival by shaking us out of our passive dance with death".|$|E

[...] The columnist also enjoyed Naomi's feud with her mother, as it led to some strong scenes between the two women. However, they criticised Naomi's attempts to seduce Toadie, believing that it was not well executed and for a character [...] "designed to be a husband-stealing minx" [...] her pursuit was [...] "tepid at best". During his review of the show in 2014, Digital Spy's Daniel Kilkelly praised O'Reilly's addition to the cast, saying [...] "Naomi has also been {{a breath of fresh air}} as a character who will push the boundaries just that little bit more than many of her neighbours!" ...|$|E
500|$|Slant Magazine writer Sal Cinquemani {{compared}} the album unfavorably to In the Zone, saying that although Blackout [...] "scores well, and its <b>hotness</b> quotient is remarkably high, [...] isn't {{much of a}} step forward for Britney following 2003's surprisingly strong In the Zone, for which she received a writing credit on {{a majority of the}} songs (as opposed to a scant three here)." [...] Andy Battaglia of The A.V. Club said Blackout [...] "counts both as a significant event and as a disquieting aberration that couldn't be more mysteriously manufactured or bizarrely ill-timed" [...] in which [...] "every song counts as markedly progressive and strange." [...] Alexis Petridis from The Guardian called it [...] "a bold, exciting album: the question is whether anyone will be able to hear its contents over the deafening roar of tittle-tattle." [...] He elaborated that when faced with a public image in freefall, an artist has two options: making music [...] "that harks back to your golden, pre-tailspin days" [...] to [...] "underlin your complete normality" [...] or [...] "to throw caution to the wind: given your waning fortunes, what's the harm in taking a few musical risks?" [...] Petridis commented that Spears opted for the latter and the results were [...] "largely fantastic." [...] Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times said, [...] "The electronic beats and bass lines are as thick as Ms. Spears's voice is thin, and as the album title suggests, the general mood is bracingly unapologetic." [...] Sanneh added that said Spears became a spectral presence in her own album, explaining that when compared to her previous records, [...] " [...] cuts a startlingly low profile on Blackout [...] Even when she was being marketed as a clean-cut ex-Mouseketeer, and even when she was touring the country with a microphone that functioned largely as a prop, something about her was intense." [...] Peter Robinson of The Observer stated that Spears [...] "delivered the best album of her career, raising the bar for modern pop music with an incendiary mix of Timbaland's Shock Value and her own back catalogue." [...] The Phoenixs Ellee Dean said the album [...] "may be more a tribute to the skills of the A-list producers who guided her through the disc than to any of her own talents. But at least she was smart enough to accept that guidance." [...] In his consumer guide for MSN Music, critic Robert Christgau gave the album a B+ and said that [...] "From 'Gimme More's 'It's Britney bitch' hiya to 'Piece of Me's single-of-the-year sonics, from 'Ooh Ooh Baby's 'feel you deep inside' to 'Perfect Lover's 'touch me there', this album is pure, juicy, plastic get-naked." [...] Blackout was ranked by Rolling Stone at number fifty on their list of the 100 Best Albums of 2007. The album topped Billboards Reader's Choice poll as the best album of the year.|$|E
2500|$|Temperature is {{a measure}} of a quality of a state of a {{material}} [...] The quality may be regarded as a more abstract entity than any particular temperature scale that measures it, and is called <b>hotness</b> by some writers. The quality of <b>hotness</b> refers to the state of material only in a particular locality, and in general, apart from bodies held in a steady state of thermodynamic equilibrium, <b>hotness</b> varies from place to place. It is not necessarily the case that a material in a particular place is in a state that is steady and nearly homogeneous enough to allow it to have a well-defined <b>hotness</b> or temperature. <b>Hotness</b> may be represented abstractly as a one-dimensional manifold. Every valid temperature scale has its own one-to-one map into the <b>hotness</b> manifold.|$|E
2500|$|In {{parts of}} Southern Germany like Franconia, [...] "Kren" [...] is an {{essential}} component of the traditional wedding dinner. It is served with cooked beef and a dip made from lingonberry to balance the slight <b>hotness</b> of the Kren.|$|E
2500|$|Alcohol is {{the primary}} factor in dictating a wine's weight and body. Typically the higher the alcohol level, the more weight the wine has. An {{increase}} in alcohol content will increase the perception of density and texture. In food and wine pairing, salt and spicy heat will accentuate the alcohol {{and the perception of}} [...] "heat" [...] or <b>hotness</b> in the mouth. Conversely, the alcohol can also magnify the heat of spicy food making a highly alcoholic wine paired with a very spicy dish one that will generate a lot of heat for the taster.|$|E
2500|$|If a {{physical}} system is inhomogeneous or very rapidly or irregularly changing, for example by turbulence, {{it may be}} impossible to characterize it by a temperature, but still there can be transfer of energy as heat between it and another system. If a system has {{a physical}} state that is regular enough, and persists long enough {{to allow it to}} reach thermal equilibrium with a specified thermometer, then it has a temperature according to that thermometer. An empirical thermometer registers degree of <b>hotness</b> for such a system. Such a temperature is called empirical. For example, Truesdell writes about classical thermodynamics: [...] "At each time, the body is assigned a real number called the temperature. This number is a measure of how hot the body is." ...|$|E
2500|$|This {{particular}} sensation, called chemesthesis, {{is not a}} {{taste in}} the technical sense, because the sensation does not arise from taste buds, and {{a different set of}} nerve fibers carry it to the brain. Foods like chili peppers activate nerve fibers directly; the sensation interpreted as [...] "hot" [...] results from the stimulation of somatosensory (pain/temperature) fibers on the tongue. Many parts of the body with exposed membranes but no taste sensors (such as the nasal cavity, under the fingernails, surface of the eye or a wound) produce a similar sensation of heat when exposed to <b>hotness</b> agents. Asian countries within the sphere of, mainly, [...] Chinese, Indian, and Japanese cultural influence, often wrote of pungency as a fifth or sixth taste.|$|E
2500|$|While it {{is often}} said that [...] "taste is subjective", there are {{quantifiable}} taste characteristics (like bitter, sweet, salty or sour) that can be perceived and measured as low, moderate or high—such as measuring the sweetness of honey or the saltiness of oysters. Flavors, such as butterscotch, char and strawberry, are more personal and can't be quantifiable. Flavors are either perceived to be present or not. The perception of flavors is linked to our sense of smell, while tastes come from the sensory glands of the taste buds. Though individual sensitivity to the different taste [...] "senses" [...] can vary, wine experts will often recommend pairings based on these more objective measurements rather than the more subjective concept of [...] "flavors". In wine there are three basic tastes-bitter, sweet and sour. These three tastes can each be identified with a primary component of the wine-tannins (bitter), residual sugar (sweet) and acidity (sour). A fourth component, alcohol, is identified in wine tasting with a perception of [...] "heat" [...] or <b>hotness</b> {{in the back of the}} mouth and is the primary factor influencing the body of the wine. The residual heat of the alcohol can be considered in food pairing with some ingredients minimizing the heat of the wine while some will accentuate it.|$|E

[...] Craig Flaster of MTV stated, [...] "Transformers broke Fox into the mainstream, immediately turning her into a household name and international sex symbol."

2500|$|Before the {{rigorous}} mathematical definition of heat based on Carathéodory's 1909 paper, recounted just above, historically, heat, temperature, and thermal equilibrium {{were presented in}} thermodynamics textbooks as jointly primitive notions. Carathéodory introduced his 1909 paper thus: [...] "The proposition that the discipline of thermodynamics can be justified without recourse to any hypothesis that cannot be verified experimentally must be {{regarded as one of}} the most noteworthy results of the research in thermodynamics that was accomplished during the last century." [...] Referring to the [...] "point of view adopted by most authors who were active in the last fifty years", Carathéodory wrote: [...] "There exists a physical quantity called heat that is not identical with the mechanical quantities (mass, force, pressure, etc.) and whose variations can be determined by calorimetric measurements." [...] James Serrin introduces an account of the theory of thermodynamics thus: [...] "In the following section, we shall use the classical notions of heat, work, and <b>hotness</b> as primitive elements, ... That heat is an appropriate and natural primitive for thermodynamics was already accepted by Carnot. Its continued validity as a primitive element of thermodynamical structure is due to the fact that it synthesizes an essential physical concept, as well as to its successful use in recent work to unify different constitutive theories." [...] This traditional kind of presentation of the basis of thermodynamics includes ideas that may be summarized by the statement that heat transfer is purely due to spatial non-uniformity of temperature, and is by conduction and radiation, from hotter to colder bodies. It is sometimes proposed that this traditional kind of presentation necessarily rests on [...] "circular reasoning"; against this proposal, there stands {{the rigorous}}ly logical mathematical development of the theory presented by Truesdell and Bharatha (1977).|$|E
