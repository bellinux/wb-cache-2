25|$|A {{survey in}} the United States {{of more than}} 10,000 {{physicians}} came to the result that while 24% of physicians would prescribe a treatment that is a placebo simply because the patient wanted treatment, 58% would not, and for the remaining 18%, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>depend</b> on the circumstances.|$|E
25|$|S. 517 {{would impose}} a private-sector mandate by {{eliminating}} an existing right {{of action for}} wireless carriers (and others), who are currently able to pursue legal action against those who, without permission, circumvent the access controls on certain wireless telephone handsets. The cost of the mandate would be the forgone net value of settlements and damages in such cases. A search of the literature suggests that few, if any, of those types of lawsuits have been brought against individual consumers. Because such claims would probably be uncommon {{in the future and}} the damage awards allowed in such cases would be relatively small, CBO estimates that the cost of this mandate would be small and fall below the annual threshold established in UMRA for private-sector mandate ($152 million in 2014, adjusted annually for inflation). If the Librarian of Congress decides to broaden the exemption allowed under the bill to cover other types of mobile devices, such an action would eliminate additional rights of action. The cost of that expansion would depend on what devices the Librarian would include under the exemption and the forgone net value of settlements and damages. CBO has no basis to estimate the cost of such mandates as <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>depend</b> on the regulatory actions taken by the Librarian.|$|E

500|$|Tensions also {{developed}} between Wilkinson and Lieutenant Governor-Elect Jones {{soon after the}} election. During the campaign, Jones {{was quoted as saying}} that he had talked with Wilkinson about being more open with the press and said that, if elected, he would not be a [...] "yes man" [...] for Wilkinson. At a press conference shortly after the election, Wilkinson {{said he did not know}} what role Jones would play in his administration and that much of <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>depend</b> on what Jones had meant when he said he did not agree with all of Wilkinson's positions. In late November 1987, Wilkinson announced that Jones would spearhead the promotion of the administration's agricultural agenda. The Lexington Herald-Leader reported that this would not be Jones' primary role in the administration but that no other specifics had been provided.|$|E
500|$|Milian {{received}} writing {{credit for}} nine {{songs on the}} album. Milian {{did not try to}} write mainstream records for the radio; rather, she wrote about [...] "everything, about your life and concentrate on you doing you." [...] For previous albums, Milian wrote about things that had happened in the past, whereas for So Amazin, she focused on the present. She compared the writing process to writing a diary; whenever she would experience something that she thought would be important, she would write it down for future reference. Milian felt that by writing down true experiences, her songs were like [...] "captured emotion". When writing songs, Milian said that the amount of time it took to write varied. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>depend</b> on what she was writing about, {{what was going on in}} her life, and if it pertained to that exact moment. Sometimes the process was quick, but other times it could take several hours to write an entire song.|$|E
500|$|Regarding if {{they would}} break the fifth season into pods again as with season four, Bell said, [...] "A 22-episode arc is a lot for people to hold onto. By {{breaking}} it up into either smaller arcs or different pods, by introducing a set of antagonists and putting them down, or moving from space to space, our experience has been that it’s something the viewers enjoy, {{and it makes it}} a little easier to digest when you’re telling some of these stories." [...] Whedon also noted <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>depend</b> on how the season would be [...] "broken up in terms of airing. If everything is running back-to-back, it feels weird to start calling it different things... We will try to have it in bite-sized chunks." [...] The season will begin airing its episodes on December 1, 2017, once Inhumans has aired its eight episodes, with the intent for all 22 episodes to air mostly uninterrupted.|$|E

50|$|In December 2010, Redman {{confirmed}} that Universal Pictures is indeed holding {{the rights to}} How High, so the chances of How High 2 coming out are slim. In April 2013, Method Man told TMZ that the script was currently being written by Dustin Lee Abraham, who wrote the first one, but <b>it</b> all <b>would</b> <b>depend</b> on Universal if the film will take place.|$|R
500|$|Todd McCarthy of Variety {{found the}} film's length to be [...] "somewhat overlong" [...] and lacking [...] "the snap and concision {{that would have}} put it over the top as a bang-up entertainment, but it's closer in spirit to a vintage Errol Flynn or Tyrone Power swashbuckler than {{anything}} that's come out of Hollywood in quite some time." [...] In his review for Rolling Stone magazine, Peter Travers criticized the casting choices for the Mexican roles, which included Banderas, a Spaniard, as well as Hopkins and Zeta-Jones, who are both Welsh. Disappointed with the film's entertainment value, Travers also expected the film to be a failure with audiences. Internet reviewer James Berardinelli compared the tone and style of The Mask of Zorro to producer Steven Spielberg's Raiders of the Lost Ark. [...] "While The Mask of Zorro isn't on the same level, it's not an altogether ridiculous comparison. Even though Zorro doesn't feature the non-stop cliffhanger adventure of Raiders," [...] Berardinelli continued, [...] "there's still plenty of action, tumult, and derring-do." [...] He was undecided whether the film would be a box office success, and that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>depend</b> on the on-screen chemistry between Banderas and Zeta-Jones. In one of the film's most popular scenes, Alejandro renders Eléna topless with a flurry of sword slashes. One critic placed it on his list of [...] "Erotic [...] Scenes in the 90s".|$|E
2500|$|As {{with the}} third, the fourth series was given its own title: [...] Shortly after the {{broadcast}} of Miracle Day (March 2012), {{the chief executive}} officer of Starz, Chris Albrecht, announced that he was remaining in touch with the BBC regarding a further series of Torchwood, though <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>depend</b> on Davies being free from his other commitments. [...] , no plans for fifth series have been announced, however, in early 2015 Barrowman confirmed that Torchwood was returning in the form of several BBC radio plays that could lead to the possibility of a future return to television.|$|E
2500|$|In The New York Times on April 3, 1966, Moyers {{offered this}} insight on his stint as press {{secretary}} to President Johnson: [...] "I {{work for him}} despite his faults and he lets me work for him despite my deficiencies." [...] On October 17, 1967, he told an audience in Cambridge that Johnson saw the war in Vietnam as his major legacy and, as a result, was insisting on victory at all costs, {{even in the face}} of public opposition. Moyers felt such a continuation of the conflict would tear the country apart. [...] "I never thought the situation could arise when I would wish for the defeat of LBJ, and that makes my current state of mind all the more painful to me," [...] he told them. [...] "I would have to say now: <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>depend</b> on who his opponent is." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{way this}} actor is written, the {{selection}} of the next input token and the actual copying of the token to the output is one atomic step. Suppose one wants to rewrite that actor to perform these two things in two distinct actions. The actor would then execute in two stages—in the first, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> wait for a token on input S. Once it read that token <b>it</b> <b>would,</b> <b>depending</b> on its value wait for a data token on either A or B. Once that arrived, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> copy <b>it</b> to the output, and go back to waiting for a token on S.The following actor IterSelect is written in that way. Its state variable state is used to select the action that is waiting for input, depending on whether the variable is 0, 1, or 2. Initially, by making 0 the initial value of state, IterSelect waits for input on S, and then it proceeds as described above.|$|R

5000|$|One of {{the factors}} that {{hindered}} glaciation was atmospheric CO2 concentrations, which at the time were somewhere between 8 and 20 times pre-industrial levels. [...] During this time though, CO2 concentrations are thought to have dropped significantly, which could have led to further glaciation, but the methods for the removal of CO2 during that time are not well known. It could have been possible for glaciation to initiate with high levels of CO2, but <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have <b>depended</b> highly on continental configuration.|$|R
2500|$|In November 2014, when Gunn {{said he had}} the [...] "basic story" [...] for Vol. 2 {{while working}} on the first film, {{he also said he}} had ideas for a {{potential}} third film. Despite this, Gunn was unsure in June 2015 if he would be involved with a third Guardians film, saying <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>depend</b> on his feelings after making Vol. 2. In April 2016, Feige said the future MCU films are [...] "still a big chess board for 2020 and beyond, but certainly I would say Guardians 3 is [...] up there. I don't know what exactly the order will be." [...] In March 2017, Gunn stated there would be a third film [...] "for sure. We're trying to figure it out," [...] also adding, [...] "There are no specific plans for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. But we know unless something goes horribly—which is always possible, you never know—I think that Marvel would want to make another movie." [...] He also reiterated he was still unsure if he would be involved with the film, and that he would figure out his involvement and his next project [...] "over the next couple of weeks." [...] The following month, Gunn announced he would return to write and direct Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. Klementieff is expected to reprise her role as Mantis. Vol. 3 is scheduled to be released in 2020.|$|E

Subsequently, in 1897, the South Antelope Valley Irrigation Company built a dam west of the railroad causeway and built a ditch from Little Rock Creek to keep Una Lake full year round for irrigation purposes south of Palmdale.|$|R
50|$|In 2002, the Scottish Association Public Transport (SAPT) {{published}} a report suggesting that electrification of the Shotts Line {{would open up}} the Glasgow suburban electric network to Edinburgh and beyond, principally linking the capital to the Glasgow Airport Rail Link (now cancelled).

40|$|General {{evaluation}} of the relaxation time to equilibrium is usually considered as difficult, since <b>it</b> <b>would</b> strongly <b>depend</b> {{on the model of}} interest. In this paper, we provide a generic initial relaxation time of the fidelity for the isolated large systems. The decay of the fidelity is a combination of the Lorentzian and a sinusoidal oscillation.

Remarkably, these two time scales are the same order when the energy range of the microcanonical state is larger than the thermal fluctuation. Also, the power law decay generally exists for long time regime. Comment: 4 pages, to appear in Journal of the Physical Society of Japa...|$|R
50|$|Recall that a {{secondary}} goal of dedicated portfolio theory is {{to select the}} bonds that will provide the requisite cash flows at the lowest possible cost, given requirements on the minimum quality of bonds to be considered (thus the need for calculation).

If this couple planned to retire in five years, they could defer the starting time to coincide with their retirement date.

Previous papers reported much lower intraobserver agreement rates when using this method with ICC rates from 0.44 to 0.74 [[5],[17],[30]] This difference may be because our patients were evaluated immediately after surgery, when the tunnel remains cylindrical and has not enlarged. Measurement of an enlarged and misshaped tunnel on the 2 D CT method would be more difficult, because <b>it</b> <b>would</b> greatly <b>depend</b> on how the enlargement was positioned within the CT field of view, if it was visible in the image planes and in which image the observer choose to perform the measurement.
