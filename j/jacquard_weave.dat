25|$|The {{biggest change}} to the room was in the window treatments. Jacqueline Kennedy {{specifically}} asked for new curtains for the East Room consisting of opaque silk undercurtains and yellow drapes. Boudin oversaw the design of new draperies, with silk provided by Maison Jansen. A draft design of the drapes and valances was not ready until mid-1963. Boudin, apparently wishing {{to draw attention to}} the center window between the fireplaces, designed a valance for the center window while putting all other drapes behind window boxes. For the drapes, Boudin suggested a braid border and tie-backs made of ball fringe covered in satin. Kennedy disapproved of Boudin's proposal for the valance and window boxes, as it did not make use of the historic 1902 gilt window cornices. She did, however, approve of the fabric and tie-backs. Made of a custom-manufactured gold and cream silk lampas, the fabric contained a non-repetitive design of birds, butterflies, cupids, flowers, medallions, roosters, and wheat and featured heavy fringe at the bottom. The drapes were hung in straight panels from the carved and gilded 1902 wooden cornices. The design of the valances was not finalized until April 1964. First Lady Lady Bird Johnson asked Jacqueline Kennedy to assist her in finalizing the design. Originally, they were to be of brocatelle, a <b>jacquard</b> <b>weave</b> fabric similar to brocade but thicker and heavier and with designs in high relief. But this design was countermanded by Boudin. Instead, gold lampas, trimmed with braid and hemmed with gilt, spun-metal twisted fringe at the bottom, was installed in flat panels from behind each cornice. The curtains and valances took nearly three years to design and manufacture, and were not hung in the room until the Johnson administration in 1965. The drapes and valances cost $26,149. The cost was covered by sales of Jacqueline Kennedy's guidebook to the White House, which by 1965 was in its fourth edition.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this design was to portray an edgy {{professional}} style while combining both silky flowing fabrics with stiff and structured ones. This ensemble is inspired by the couture avant garde fashion style that captures the innovation of new concepts and techniques. These can be described by using bulging shoulders, accentuated waistlines, three dimensional figures protruding from the garment, and many other techniques that push the boundaries of everyday attire. I have taken this style and altered it to make these types of garments easily wearable and socially acceptable. Process: Before the sketching process started, design-provoking images were collected and inspirational design elements gleaned. Since these types of pieces are usually off-kilter and unrealistic, I chose to bring to life a melodious version of the style. In order to incorporate the avant garde style into the outfit I used a firm fabric for the sleeves, chest and shoulder panels to add stiffness, dimension and uniqueness to this silhouette of blouse. The pants are meant to compliment the curvature of the woman’s lower back, buttocks, and thighs. To keep with the avant garde fashion, the waistband is a bit higher, which helps nip in the waist, and elongate the torso even more so. Techniques: While creating and constructing the pants and blouse, the flat patterning and draping methods were both used to create the fullness and accurately match up the pattern pieces.

40|$|International audienceFast {{and easy}} preview of a fabric {{without having to}} produce samples would be very {{profitable}} for textile designers, but remains a technological challenge. As a first step towards this objective, we study the possibility of making images of a real sample, and changing virtually the colors of its yarns while preserving the shine and shadow texture. We consider two types of fabrics: <b>Jacquard</b> <b>weave</b> fabrics made of polyester warp and weft yarns of different colors, and satin ribbons made of polyester and metallic yarns. For the Jacquard fabric, we make a color picture with a scanner on a sample in which the yarns have contrasted colors, threshold this image in order to distinguish the pixels corresponding to each yarn, and accordingly modify their hue and chroma values. This method is simple to operate but do not enable to simulate the angle-dependent shine. A second method, tested on the satin ribbon made of black polyester and achromatic metallic yarns, is based on polarized imaging. We analyze the polarization state of the reflected light which is different for dielectric and metallic materials illuminated by polarized light. We then add a fixed color value to the pixels representing the polyester yarns and modify the hue and chroma of the pixels representing the metallic yarns. This was performed for many incident angles of light, in order to render the twinkling effect displayed by these ribbons. We could verify through a few samples that the simulated previews reproduce real pictures with visually acceptable accuracy...|$|E

40|$|Copyright © 2017 (The Authors). Reprinted by {{permission}} of SAGE Publications. In modern <b>Jacquard</b> <b>weaving,</b> the application of yarn color variety is limited to electronic Jacquard machinery and realizing a wide scope of weave colors can be challenging. Therefore, when reproducing a pictorial image with a small yarn variety, artwork colors are defined by a CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, and black) system and its primary color data are used to associate with weave structures. In alignment with a CMYK pattern layout, shaded weave structures are incorporated to expand the accessible gamut of weave colors and natural shading is realized by different cover factors in the warp and weft. The mixing effect of CMYK yarns is intended for resolving the technical limitations of current digital <b>Jacquard</b> <b>weaving.</b> In this study, quantitative research is designed to examine four yarn mixing effects for which pairs of CMYK yarns are superimposed (e. g., [C]+[M], [C]+[Y], [M]+[Y], [C]+[K], [M]+[K], [Y]+[K]) and 90 different weave colors are produced in six groups. Once they are formatted in a standardized size, weave samples are measured by a spectrophotometer and analyzed by three coordinates (L*, a*, and b*) of a CIELAB color system. As shown by the analysis results, the weave colors bear not only varied brightness, hue, and chroma alternations, but also a great similarity to the pigment mixing effect. In application of the color mixing effect, {{a new way of}} woven color presentation is achieved and introduced as a new development of Jacquard design...|$|R

50|$|The term {{tapestry}} is {{also used}} to describe weft-faced textiles made on Jacquard looms. Before the 1990s tapestry upholstery fabrics and reproductions of the famous tapestries of the Middle Ages had been produced using Jacquard techniques but more recently, artists such as Chuck Close, Patrick Lichty, and the workshop Magnolia Editions have adapted the computerised Jacquard process to producing fine art.Typically, tapestries are translated from the original design via a process resembling paint-by-numbers: a cartoon is divided into regions, each of which is assigned a solid colour based on a standard palette. However, in <b>Jacquard</b> <b>weaving,</b> the repeating series of multicoloured warp and weft threads can be used to create colours that are optically blended - i.e., the human eye apprehends the threads’ combination of values as a single colour.|$|R
