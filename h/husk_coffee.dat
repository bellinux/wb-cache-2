30|$|Different {{substrates}} {{are used}} for production of enzymes from fermentation processes. Most frequently employed substrates are agricultural wastes due to their abundant availability. Most commonly used agroindustrial wastes are wheat bran, sugarcane bagasse, rice straw, wheat straw, corn cobs, soy bran, rice <b>husk,</b> <b>coffee</b> husk and barley (Sanchéz 2009). The enzymes particularly cellulases produced from these substrates by fermentation technology are widely employed in various industrial processes such as in textile, pulp and paper, detergent and food industries (Graminha et al. 2008; Hebeish et al. 2009). This main objective {{of this study was}} (1) isolation and identification of potential cellulase producer bacterial strain (2) utilization of potato peel as substrate optimize process parameters by RSM and (3) application of cellulase for saccharification of pine needles to produce sugars.|$|E
30|$|From Table  2, {{carbonization}} {{time and}} temperature varied significantly (P[*]<[*] 0.05) for each crop waste (feedstock). The carbonization temperature (measured using a k-type thermocouple) was highest for corncob (620  °C). This observation {{is in line with}} studies carried out by Peng et al. (2011) of various crop residues pyrolysed under similar conditions. The short retention time and high temperature also showed that pyrolysis was fast. The Elsa barrel could only take a maximum quantity of 5  kg for rice husk and approximately 48  min to produce 2  kg of biochar. The short carbonization time for rice <b>husk,</b> <b>coffee</b> and groundnut husk could be due to the small quantity, dry, brittle nature and less dense material which burn much easier and faster as compared to the densely packed and woody biomass corncob and cassava which required high temperature and longer carbonization time (Joseph et al. 2013; Domingues et al. 2017).|$|E

30|$|Crop wastes used in {{the study}} were the most {{available}} and accessible wastes in the study area with high potential to negatively impact the environment. These include; sawdust, rice <b>husk,</b> <b>coffee</b> and groundnut husk, cassava and corncobs. Apart from the chemical composition of feedstock, the availability of drying and storage facilities and means of transportation were also taken into account (Abrishamkesh et al. 2015; Djousse et al. 2016). Furthermore, competition for other uses of each waste was also considered among their multiple uses since crop wastes such as sawdust and corncobs were the major energy sources providing domestic energy in the study area. Cassava residues (leftovers of roots and stems of cassava after the edible parts mainly the starchy tuberous roots have been harvested on the farm), was collected from IRAD experimental farm in Nkolbisson. The material was then cut into small pieces and piled in a greenhouse to dry. Corncob was sourced from IRAD maize store house in Nkolbisson and Dschang located in the Western highland agroecological zone. Rice husk was collected from rice mill waste streams in the city of Bamenda and Sanchou, Dschang located in the Western highland agroecological zone and transported to Nkolbisson.

30|$|Three sources {{derived from}} agro-industrial {{activity}} were used: rice <b>husk,</b> <b>coffee</b> husk and sugarcane bagasse. These by-products {{were added to}} vermicompost separately. The annelid specimen used was Eisenia foetida. The environmental conditions ideal to the reproduction and control of these specimens were set up: temperature at 20 °C, moisture around 60 – 85 %, aeration conditions and darkness. The stabilization time was around 1 month and the humus obtained was dried in a room at a temperature between 30 and 40 °C. Then, the humus was sieved to size 0.5 mm approximately. Next, the sample was calcinated to eliminate the organic matter. Three temperature levels were used: 500, 600 and 700 °C for each agro-industrial waste by 19 h. Calcinations were carried out in a muffle Lindberg/Eurotherm model 847 with energy consumption of 0.17 kcal/h cm 3, considering that the average density of the nanoparticles is around 0.1380 g/cm 3, the consumed energy in the calcinations is approximately 1.2318 kcal/h by each gram of recuperated SiO 2 particles. This energy could be considered low in comparison with other conventional process where fumed silica is manufactured with a consumed energy of until 15.48 kcal/h by each gram of SiO 2 particles [40]. Thus, the samples were tried with nitric and hydrochloric acids (volume ratio 3 : 1). For each gram of calcinated sample, 4 ml of acid mix was added in order to eliminate impurities (calcium, potassium, magnesium, manganese, iron, boron and phosphorous). Acid treatment was achieved at 40 °C by 4 h with constant stirring. Then, samples were filtrated and washed with distilled water to neutralize them. Solids obtained were dried at room temperature. All reagents employed were provided by Sigma–Aldrich.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a {{theoretical}} technical study {{was carried out}} using Brazilian available biomass materials (rice <b>husk,</b> <b>coffee</b> husk and elephant grass) compared to natural gas applied to an electric arc furnace (EAF) steelmaking process. Rice and coffee husk are biomass residues from the agriculture while elephant grass (Pennisetum Purpureum Schum) is an abundant, fast growing plant, which is used for cattle breeding. The ultimate analysis of the biomass materials {{was carried out in}} the research department of a Brazilian Steelmaking Industry. The results of the ultimate analysis were used to determine the lower calorific value and the mass flow rate of the biomass materials used in the cogeneration system. The actual steelmaking process uses natural gas to both improve the “cold spots” inside the furnace and contribute to minimize the use of electrical energy in the heating process. The feasibility study considers a combined heat and power plant (CHP) to generate electricity and heat to the electric arc furnace (EAF) process. This study used the First Law of Thermodynamics to determine the operational parameters of the cogeneration plant considering three cases of different operational parameters in the Rankine cycle. The technical results show that the natural gas consumption and exhaust gas generation were the lowest among the fuels in the three cases analyzed. Regarding the exhaust gases generation, some aspects should be highlighted: the combustion of biomass is considered carbon neutral; the exhaust gases generated may be used to scrap preheat; also, biomass is a renewable fuel in contrast with natural gas, which is a fossil fuel. Thus, an economic analysis, considering only the operational cost of the plant, was conducted exhibiting that elephant grass had the lowest operational cost, accounting for a reduction of about 9 % in the second case and 15 % in the third case compared to natural gas. Although the biomasses have lower LCV than natural gas, they showed a great promise of their use in the EAF process indicating their feasibility as an excellent alternative for the process of producing iron...|$|E

Production of briquette charcoal helps to ease the pressure on the forest cover, there by solving the deforestation problem...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} aims to {{identify}} the renewable resources available in Brazil such as acai seed, coconut <b>husks,</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>husks,</b> rice husks, eucalyptus sawdust, grass, soy peel, bamboo, banana stems and banana stalks. To identify such renewable energy sources, samples were examined for their physical and chemical characteristics using X-ray diffraction (XRD), proximate and ultimate analyses, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), calorific value determination, near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy, UV spectroscopy, high-pH anion-exchange chromatography (HPAEC-PAD) and accelerated solvent extraction (ASE). Among the biomasses, acai and coffee exhibited higher total sugar content, 67. 70 % and 62. 55 %, respectively. Sawdust exhibited low ash, along with the highest calorific value and lignin content. The highest glucose contents were observed in bamboo (44. 65 %) and sawdust (38. 80 %). The maximum yield for the bioproducts levulinic acid (LA), formic acid (FA) and furfural were estimated; acai exhibited the highest yield of LA and FA, while coffee exhibited the best furfural yield. All of these properties indicate that the residues are potential candidates for bioenergy production. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
3000|$|Total {{coffee bean}} {{production}} in 2013 was 8.7 million Mg (Ico 2014). Beans {{are separated from}} the husk {{through a variety of}} possible processing methods after harvest. According to Garcia et al. (2004), 50  % of the coffee fruit are beans and another 50  % are husk (by weight). The large amount of <b>coffee</b> <b>husk</b> generated in <b>coffee</b> processing has caused environmental concerns, and {{there is a need to}} find alternative uses for these residues (Felfli et al. 2010).|$|R
40|$|A tannase {{yielding}} {{bacterial strain}} was isolated from sheep excreta. It {{was identified as}} Lactobacillus sp. ASR S 1. The bacterial strain produced extracellular tannase under solid-state fermentation (SSF) using tamarind seed powder (TSP), wheat bran (WB), palm kernel cake (PKC) and <b>coffee</b> <b>husk</b> (CH). Among different substrates, <b>coffee</b> <b>husk</b> resulted maximal extra-cellular production of tannase. To optimize the extracellular yield of tannase under SSF various physico-chemical and nutritional parameters were studied. Supplementation of tannic acid was found useful for enzyme synthesis by the bacterial culture selectively depending up on the substrate. Maximum tannase production (0. 85 U/gds) was obtained when SSF was carried out using <b>coffee</b> <b>husk,</b> supplemented with 0. 6 % tannic acid and 50 % (w/v) moisture, inoculated with 1 mL cell suspension and incubated at 33 degrees C for 72 h.

40|$|The {{ability of}} two {{different}} strains of Ceratocystis fimbriata for fruity aroma production by solid state fermentation (SSF) was tested on coffee pulp and <b>coffee</b> <b>husk</b> complemented with glucose as substrates. Experiments were carried out in 250 mL Erlenmeyer flasks and the experimental conditions were: 70 % of initial moisture, 20 % of glucose addition and pH 6. 0. Aeration was made by passive diffusion through the gauze covering the flasks. Headspace analysis of the culture by gas chromatography (GC) showed that 12 compounds were produced with <b>coffee</b> <b>husk.</b> Maximum total volatiles (TV) concentration was reached after 72 h of culture with <b>coffee</b> <b>husk</b> as substrate (28 µmol. L- 1. g- 1). Ethyl acetate, ethanol and acetaldehyde were the major compounds produced, representing 84. 7 %, 7. 6 % and 2. 0 % of TV, respectively. A pre-treatment with heat (100 ºC/ 40 min) of substrates did not improve TV production. Respirometry {{analysis was used to}} determine the growth of the culture by measuring carbon dioxide produced. Results showed that the CO 2 production follows the aroma production. This result shows the great potential for the use coffee pulp and <b>coffee</b> <b>husk</b> as substrates to microbial aroma production by solid state fermentation...|$|R
40|$|The {{goal was}} to {{investigate}} the influence of natural products such as lemongrass (Cymbopogon citratus), dried avocado leaves (Persea americana), <b>coffee</b> <b>husk</b> (Coffea arabica) and castor bean (Ricinus communis) in the defense of Apis mellifera, as well the effect of these products on the population development of the beehive. Defensive behavior was evaluated by time of first sting (TFS) and number of stingers (NS), and population development, by open brood area and operculated brood. It was observed that the treatment with smoke + seven castor beans presented significant increase in the TFS, for treatment without and with smoke. Regarding NS, it was verified that the treatments with smoke + seven castor bean and smoke + 20 % <b>coffee</b> <b>husk</b> were different from the treatment without and with smoke. The other treatments did not differ significantly with respect to the use of smoke or its absence. The application of <b>coffee</b> <b>husk</b> and castor bean did not interfere {{in the development of the}} population, suggesting that these compounds were not toxic. It can be concluded that the use of castor bean and <b>coffee</b> <b>husk</b> in smoke may represent an important tool for the reduction of defensiveness, without promoting toxicity for A. mellifera...|$|R
40|$|Biofuel pellets were {{prepared}} from biomass (pine, chestnut and eucalyptus sawdust, cellulose residue, <b>coffee</b> <b>husks</b> and grape waste) and from blends of biomass with two coals (bituminous and semianthracite). Their mechanical properties and combustion behaviour were studied {{by means of}} an abrasion index and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), respectively, in order to select the best raw materials available in the area of study for pellet production. Chestnut and pine sawdust pellets exhibited the highest durability, whereas grape waste and <b>coffee</b> <b>husks</b> pellets were the least durable. Blends of pine sawdust with 10 – 30...|$|R
40|$|Agricultural biomass {{is widely}} {{recognized}} as a clean and renewable energy source, with increasing potential to replace conventional fossil fuels in the energy market. Uganda, like other developing countries, has a high dependency (91 %) on wood fuel, leading to environmental degradation. With a coffee production of 233 Metric Tonnes per annum, relating to 46. 6 Mega Tonnes of <b>coffee</b> <b>husks</b> from processing, transforming these husks into syngas through gasification can contribute to resolving the existing energy challenges. The objective {{of this article is}} to briefly review the energy potential of <b>coffee</b> <b>husks</b> through gasification, and how the gasification process could increase energy recoveries for coffee farmers. Previous  findings indicate that the 46. 6 Mega Tonnes per year of <b>coffee</b> <b>husks</b> generated in Uganda, with a heating value of 18. 34 MJ/kg, is capable of generating 24 GWh of energy. This will address a 0. 7 % portion of the energy situation in Uganda, while protecting the environment...|$|R
