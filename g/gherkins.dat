500|$|Describing {{the tone}} of the episode Ford {{describes}} it as [...] "an all out romp" [...] and an [...] "action, rollercoaster ride" [...] with [...] "a lot of comedy in it as much as thrills and nasty monsters". Davies stated that [...] "the whole point of the episode is to have a right old laugh". Expanding on the comedic aspects, something Ford considered whilst writing the episode was that [...] "the trick is to have the comedy come out of the characters" [...] rather than the scenario itself. It was Eve Myles' idea to have Gwen compulsively eat <b>gherkins</b> after waking up pregnant; the script had only specified the character drinking a glass of water. The episode also plays on Gwen's conflicted feelings between Jack and Rhys. Davies felt it would be [...] "irresistible" [...] to have the wedding temporarily halted by [...] "the one man Rhys doesn't want to see running down the aisle." [...] Ford stated that whilst Jack is [...] "the series hero" [...] Rhys is [...] "the hero of this episode". He compares a sequence where Rhys arms himself with a chainsaw to defend Gwen to the character being in [...] "Evil Dead mode". [...] Producer Richard Stokes commented that the episode illuminated that [...] "even though 's put [...] through some really difficult times, she really does love him and want to be with him." [...] In an early draft of the script Gwen and Rhys had their memories wiped {{at the end of the}} episode in addition to the other guests and were convinced by Jack that the wedding had been problem free.|$|E

40|$|Paulista <b>gherkin</b> {{is a new}} <b>gherkin</b> type {{obtained}} by crossing Cucumis anguria var. anguria x C. anguria var. longaculeatus. It differs from common <b>gherkin</b> in its fruits and leaves. Elite lines of Paulista <b>gherkin</b> present similar performance for total yield and fruit weight but some have distinctive characteristics, including fruit and leaf attributes. The combination of these characteristics through production of Paulista <b>gherkin</b> hybrids could be an alternative for fruit quality and/or yield improvement. The {{purpose of the present}} work was to compare the yield of Paulista <b>gherkin</b> lines and their hybrids grown on a trellis net under field conditions. Four lines and their six single-cross hybrids were evaluated for yield and fruit production using the trellised net production system. Seedlings were produced in polystyrene trays with 128 cells, and transplanted to the middle of 1. 20 m wide beds. Plants were trained without pruning on netting having 0. 1 x 0. 1 m openings. The experiment was conducted in a randomized block design with four replicates and seven plants per plot. Yield was expressed as number of fruits and total weight of fruits per plot. Length, width and fruit flesh thickness were also evaluated, with five samples per plot in two harvesting times. Hybrids and their parental lines were similar in fruit yield and quality. The trellised net was suitable for Paulista <b>gherkin</b> production and provided adequate support to the plants. The trellis technique is suitable to make harvesting easier and to improve fruit quality...|$|R

60|$|Of course, {{you know}} my friend the {{squirting}} cucumber. If you don't, that can be only because you've never looked {{in the right place}} to find him. On all waste ground outside most southern cities--Nice, Cannes, Florence: Rome, Algiers, Granada: Athens, Palermo, Tunis, where you will--the soil is thickly covered by dark trailing vines which bear on their branches a queer hairy green fruit, much like a common cucumber at that early stage of its existence when we know it best in the commercial form of pickled <b>gherkins.</b> As long as you don't interfere with them, these hairy green fruits do nothing out of the common in the way of personal aggressiveness. Like the model young lady of the books on etiquette, they don't speak unless they're spoken to. But if peradventure you chance to brush up against the plant accidentally, or you irritate it of set purpose with your foot or your cane, then, as Mr. Rider Haggard would say, 'a strange thing happens': off jumps the little green fruit with a startling bounce, and scatters its juice and pulp and seeds explosively {{through a hole in the}} end where the stem joined on to it. The entire central part of the cucumber, in short (answering to the seeds and pulp of a ripe melon), squirts out elastically through the breach in the outer wall, leaving the hollow shell behind as a mere empty windbag.|$|E

His plumage was a dirty brown to begin with, with a sort of grey scab that fell off it very soon, and scarcely feathers--a kind of downy hair. I can hardly express how pleased I was to see him. I tell you, Robinson Crusoe don't make near enough of his loneliness. But here was interesting company. He looked at me and winked his eye from the front backwards, like a hen, and gave a chirp and began to peck about at once, as though being hatched three hundred years too late was just nothing. 'Glad to see you, Man Friday!' says I, for I had naturally settled he was to be called Man Friday if ever he was hatched, as soon as ever I found the egg in the canoe had developed. I was a bit anxious about his feed, so I gave him a lump of raw parrot-fish at once. He took it, and opened his beak for more. I was glad of that, for, under the circumstances, if he'd been at all fanciful, I should have had to eat him after all. You'd be surprised what an interesting bird that Aepyornis chick was. He followed me about from the very beginning. He used to stand by me and watch while I fished in the lagoon, and go shares in anything I caught. And he was sensible, too.

60|$|It {{was three}} o’clock before the baggage began {{to arrive in}} the valley, and {{it was evident that}} it would not be all down until dark, and that much of it could not reach the plateau above that night. Three of us, therefore, {{resolved}} upon sleeping where we were, and upon going on at daybreak. We accordingly pitched our tents under a tree, saw our horses picketed and fed, and dinner in course of preparation, and then went out for a walk to explore the valley. The temperature was very many degrees warmer than upon the plateau above, and the flora was more than proportionately luxuriant. Here I find, among hundreds of other plants of whose names and properties I am unfortunately ignorant, the wild verbena and heliotrope, also the cucumber. Unfortunately the cucumbers had only just begun to form, and were scarcely as large as <b>gherkins,</b> or we might have had an unexpected addition to our fare. I also found quantities of the rare palm-fern growing in crevices of the rocks. It was altogether a splendid field for a botanist, and I think it a great pity that a learned botanist did not accompany the expedition instead of a geographer, who, although a most distinguished savant, can but tell the world nearly the same particulars of the narrow strip of country through which we are travelling as must occur to any ordinary observer. Had this gentleman merely taken advantage of the protection given by our presence in the country to travel generally through it, he might have no doubt added largely to our store of information; but keeping to the line of route followed by the army, he can, with the exception of ascertaining the precise heights over which we travel, tell us really next to nothing. I believe, however, that this staying with the army is in no degree the fault of the gentleman in question, but of the military authorities, who here appear to have the idea that a civilian is a sort of grown-up baby, who must be kept strictly under their own eyes, or else that he will infallibly get into mischief, and either come to harm himself, or else be the cause of that dreadful and mysterious thing—complications. Had King Kassa, at the time he visited us, been applied to by the Commander-in-chief, he would, no doubt, have afforded every facility to the geographer and archæologist to have wandered as they pleased among his dominions, and the latter especially might have visited the interesting cities of Adowa and Axum, and made discoveries of an important and interesting nature, instead of wasting his time on the summit of the bleak Abyssinian mountains.|$|E

O objetivo deste trabalho foi comparar a produção de frutos de linhagens de Maxixe Paulista e do tipo Comum quando cultivados tutorados, em ambiente protegido e com substrato. As mudas foram obtidas em bandejas de poliestireno expandido e, quando apresentavam cinco folhas verdadeiras, foram transferidas para vasos de cinco litros contendo uma mistura de areia, vermiculita, e húmus. Em estrutura do tipo arco coberto com filme de PEBD, os vasos foram colocados em 4 fileiras duplas, com espaçamento de 0, 5 m entre vasos e 1, 0 m entre fileiras. As plantas foram conduzidas com tutoramento e podas. O delineamento {{experimental}} foi de blocos ao acaso, com oito repetições e parcela de oito plantas. A produção em massa total de frutos não diferiu entre os dois tipos de maxixe. As linhagens de Maxixe Paulista apresentaram massa média de frutos de 62 a 84 % maior que o tipo Comum.
