5|$|The {{mandible}} is best {{represented by}} YGSP 32727, {{one of two}} specimens of the unnamed large species of Indraloris. It preserves both {{the right and left}} sides of the dentary, back {{to the level of the}} fourth lower premolars (p4), but is also damaged at the front. The jaw is deep below p4, but rapidly becomes shallower further to the front. The roots of two lower incisors and a much larger canine are preserved; the three roots cluster together, with the canine root above the incisor roots, suggesting that these teeth shared some function. The mental foramen, an opening in the jawbone, is below p4. A root for the deciduous second premolar (dp2) is preserved on both the left and right sides, but the tooth itself <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>and</b> it is not possible to determine whether dp2 had one or two roots. The right permanent second premolar (p2) is unerupted, but partially visible; it is a blade-shaped cutting tooth. The p3 bears a single cusp, somewhat anterior to the middle of the tooth, with crests descending from it towards the front and back, and weak cingula on the inner and outer sides. It is supported by two roots, which are close together.|$|E

25|$|Other theorists in {{developmental}} psychology {{have suggested that}} religiosity comes naturally to young children.

25|$|Pseudonymous {{writing is}} not rare in {{literature}} or philosophy (Kierkegaard provides a celebrated instance). 'Heteronyms', as Pessoa called and defined them, are something different and exceedingly strange. For {{each of his}} 'voices', Pessoa conceived a highly distinctive poetic idiom and technique, a complex biography, a context of literary influence and polemics and, most arrestingly of all, subtle interrelations and reciprocities of awareness. Octavio Paz defines Caeiro as 'everything that Pessoa <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>and</b> more'.|$|E
25|$|Cartan's {{approach}} {{seems at}} first to be coordinate dependent because of the choice of frames it involves. However, it <b>is</b> <b>not,</b> <b>and</b> the notion can be described precisely using the language of principal bundles. Cartan connections induce covariant derivatives and other differential operators on certain associated bundles, hence a notion of parallel transport. They have many applications in geometry and physics: see the method of moving frames, Cartan connection applications and Einstein–Cartan theory for some examples.|$|E

25|$|From {{the latter}} 2000s to the present, Arroyo Seco {{and the rest}} of the Sierra Gorda in Querétaro have been {{experiencing}} numerous small earthquakes, with most registering from 2.5 to 3.5 on the Richter scale, generally imperceptible to humans. Seismologists say that while the number has been unusual, such activity <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>and</b> is due to the settling of the sedimentary rock which is below most of the Sierra Gorda region. However, Arroyo Seco and other municipalities have seismographs installed to monitor the situation.|$|E

25|$|The {{library was}} a major {{reference}} and research resource, but there were detractors.

25|$|Since Oakland <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>and</b> {{was never}} a {{perpetual}} care cemetery, maintenance of grave sites was {{the responsibility of the}} families of the interred. Of course, time sees the movement of families and the general disconnection with ancestors as generations pass. Because of this, many grave sites have fallen into disrepair from neglect and sometimes vandalism. Therefore, shortly after Oakland was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 28, 1976, the Historic Oakland Foundation was established. The Foundation has overseen the restoration and upkeep of many grave sites, monuments, mausolea, and buildings that had been affected by the ravages of time. Their activity, which is supported by donations, grants, and special events, continues today as they maintain and restore the cemetery as well as provide guided tours of the grounds.|$|E
25|$|Various {{perceptions}} of the vagina have existed throughout history, including the belief it {{is the center of}} sexual desire, a metaphor for life via birth, inferior to the penis, visually unappealing, inherently unpleasant to smell, or otherwise vulgar. These views can largely be attributed to sex differences, and how they are interpreted. David Buss, an evolutionary psychologist, stated that because a penis is significantly larger than a clitoris and it is readily visible while the vagina <b>is</b> <b>not,</b> <b>and</b> males urinate through the penis, boys are taught from childhood to touch their penises while girls are often taught that they should not touch their own genitals, which implies that there is harm in doing so. Buss attributed this to the reason why many women are not as familiar with their genitalia as men are familiar with their own, and that researchers assume these sex differences explain why boys learn to masturbate before girls, and masturbate more often than girls.|$|E
25|$|The {{generality}} of the characterisation process <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>and</b> {{cannot be}} wholly scientific. It {{is always a}} matter of interpretation. For example, if A, who is a national of Arcadia, dies having made a valid local will and leaves land situated in Barsoom to C, who is domiciled in Catilage, how is the issue to be classified? One might say that any rights that C might have are vested by the will that was made in Arcadia, the lex loci actus. Equally, the right to succeed to title might be an aspect of C's status as the oldest surviving male heir under Cartilagean law, the lex loci domicilii. Also, {{it may be a}} matter for the law of Barsoom since all matters of title to land must be adjusted by the lex situs, as the law of the place of the land. Thus, completely different judgments might result depending on how the forum court characterises the action.|$|E
