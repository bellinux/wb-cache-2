40|$|Increasing demands {{regarding}} performance, {{safety and}} environmental compatibility of hydraulic mobile machines {{in combination with}} rising cost pressures create a growing need for specialized optimization of hydraulic systems; {{particularly with regard to}} hydraulic reservoirs.

40|$|An initial {{prediction}} of the particulate mode of flow in pneumatic conveying systems is beneficial as this knowledge can provide clearer direction to the pneumatic conveying design process. There are three general categories of modes of flow, two dense flows: fluidised dense phase and plug flow, and dilute phase only.

Two types of predictive charts were defined: basic particle parameter based (e. g. particle size and density) and air-particle parameter based (e. g. permeability and <b>de-aeration).</b> The basic particle techniques were found to have strong and weak areas of predictive ability, {{on the basis of a}} comparison with data from materials with known mode of flow capability. It was found that there was only slight improvement in predictive ability when the particle density was replaced by loose-poured bulk density in the basic parameter techniques. The air-particle-parameter-based techniques also showed well-defined regions for mode of flow prediction though the data set used was smaller than that for the basic techniques.

40|$|Aero-engine oil systems need to {{pump and}} de-aerate air-oil flows. Engine sub-components {{performing}} these tasks are undergoing important changes {{due to the}} development of more-electric engines. A new integrated pump and separation system that can be electrically entrained was developed and characterised experimentally to reduce footprint on the engine and increase reliability and performance.

To address this need, a dimensional analysis of the Pump and Separation System that allows in-flight performance prediction is proposed in this paper. This model is used to assess different prototype sizes and the influence of a more-electric engine. This analysis illustrates that by switching to an electric entrainment, the footprint of the Pump and Separation system on the engine is reduced by 34 %, and <b>de-aeration</b> performances are improved by 55 % at maximum take-off and 17 % in cruise phase.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this PhD thesis is the {{development}} of an efficient system that can simultaneously pump and separate a gas-liquid mixture, in particular an oil-air mixture. Two-phase flows are encountered in many applications (petroleum extraction, flow in nuclear power plant pumps, pulp and paper processing, etc.) but this study is mainly focused on lubrication systems of aircraft gas turbine engines. The pump and separator system (PASS) for two-phase flows developed in this PhD thesis aims to perform three functions simultaneously: • Send back the oil to the tank (oil pumping) • Separate the air from the oil (<b>de-aeration)</b> • Separate the oil from the air (de-oiling) and release the sealing air into the atmosphere (venting). Particular care is given to the liquid flow rate lost at the gas outlet of the system. Consequently, it could replace the scavenge pumps and oil-air separators existing in present lubrication systems. This modification provides several advantages: simplification of the lubrication circuit, reduction of oil consumption and {{of the size of the}} lubrication system. This research is divided into three axes: the theoretical study of the important physical mechanisms taking place inside the two-phase flow pump and separator system, the experimental development, tests and optimization of different PASS prototypes, and also the numerical simulations of the two-phase flow inside these prototypes. Although the experiments were the central pillar of this research, the three axes were closely imbricated. The PASS design includes three main components: • An inlet chamber with one or several tangential inlets giving a natural centrifugation to the flow, • An impeller (forced centrifugation) with an axial and a radial part followed by a volute chamber, • A metallic foam that lets pass micron and sub-micron droplets and which is followed by an axial vent port. The centrifugation causes the liquid (oil) to move radially outwards in an annular body (a liquid ring) generating pressure. The thickness of this liquid ring inside the impeller is mainly determined by the pressure coefficient (related to the back-pressure and the rotational speed). When the back-pressure increases, the thickness of the liquid ring increases too. An advantage of the PASS is that it does not impose any relation between the liquid head and the liquid flow rate, contrary to common centrifugal pump. It self-regulates the radial position of the gas-liquid interface to sustain the operating conditions. The <b>de-aeration</b> efficiency mainly depends on the pressure coefficient (for a constant liquid viscosity or temperature) or on the thickness of the liquid ring. The pressure gradient which appears in the liquid rotating in an annular body acts like a dam for the gas phase. Indeed, the gas movement is mainly determined by the pressure field (buoyancy) while the liquid distribution is dominated by centrifugal and Coriolis forces. Buoyancy tends to accumulate the gas phase near low pressure areas (PASS hub, suction side of the blades, clearances between closed impeller and casing). The first oil-air PASS prototype produces high viscous losses due to the high peripheral velocity and liquid viscosity. Therefore, the pumping efficiency is poor compared to common impeller pumps. However, the pumping is not the key function of the PASS and a power consumption below 5 kW is acceptable for the application considered in this work. For applications that require lower power consumptions, a reduction of the rotational speed must be considered. Thus, the rotational speed and the impeller diameter are two major constraints for the PASS design which determine the <b>de-aeration</b> and pumping efficiencies. The impeller diameter also influences the size of passage sections for the air flow. The air velocity must be kept as low as possible because the entrainment of droplets increases when the air velocity rises (drag forces on droplets). Indeed, this large influence of the air flow rate on the oil consumption (de-oiling efficiency) was demonstrated by a theoretical analysis, the experiments and the CFD simulations. The production of droplets in the inlet pipes when the two-phase flow is annular is a key phenomenon regarding the oil consumption. In addition to the air flow rate, other variables also influence the oil consumption: • Air-oil temperature: when the temperature rises, the oil consumption increases because the surface tension and the oil density are reduced. Moreover, as the air density also decreases, the air velocity rises. • Oil flow rate: the oil consumption rises more or less linearly with the oil flow rate. However, the influence of the oil flow rate on the inlet droplet size is uncertain. • Rotational speed: the rotational speed has obviously a strong impact on the oil consumption without metallic foam. However, experiments showed that the metallic foam efficiency is almost independent on the rotational speed. Therefore, the oil consumption with the Retimet foam does not depend on the PASS rotational speed. • Altitude or air density: the oil consumption decreases when the air density is reduced because the drag forces on droplets also decrease. The gas density (altitude) is also supposed to influence the <b>de-aeration</b> efficiency but this could not be tested or simulated in this work (the <b>de-aeration</b> efficiency gets probably better when decreasing the gas density because the buoyancy forces increase). Theory, experiments and numerical simulations also allowed the prediction of performance of the first oil-air prototype for real in-flight operating conditions. Two problems have been identified: the <b>de-aeration</b> efficiency at MTO and cruise ratings and the oil leak throughout the vent in cold start and windmilling. To solve them, some modifications of the lubrication system have been suggested. With these modifications, the oil-air PASS should become very efficient and attractive for engine manufacturers.

40|$|If air is entrained in {{a bottom}} outlet of a dam in an {{uncontrolled}} way, the resulting air pockets may cause {{problems such as}} blowback, blowout and loss of discharge capacity. In order to provide guidance for bottom outlet design and operation, this study examines how governing parameters affect air entrainment, air-pocket transport and <b>de-aeration</b> and the surrounding flow structure in pipe flows. Both experimental and numerical approaches are used. Air can be entrained into the bottom outlet conduit due to vortex formation at the intake if the intake submergence is not sufficient. The influent of the intake entrance profiles and channel width on the critical submergence were studied in the experiment. The experimental study was performed to investigate the incipient motion of air pockets in pipes with rectangular and circular cross sections. The critical velocity is dependent on pipe slope, pipe diameter, pipe roughness and air-pocket volume. If the pipe is horizontal, air removal is generally easier in a rectangular pipe than in a circular pipe. However, if the pipe is downward-inclined, air removal is easier in a circular pipe. When a bottom outlet gate opens, air can become entrained into the conduit in the gate shaft downstream of the gate. Using FLUENT software, the transient process of air entrainment into a prototype bottom outlet during gate opening is simulated in three dimensions. The simulations show in the flow-pattern changes in the conduit {{and the amount of}} air entrainment in the gate shaft. The initial conduit water level affects the degree of air entrainment. A <b>de-aeration</b> chamber is effective in reducing water surface fluctuations at blowout. High-speed particle image velocimetry (HSPIV) were applied to investigate the characteristics of the flow field around a stationary air pocket in a fully developed horizontal pipe flow. The air pocket generates a horseshoe vortex upstream and a reverse flow downstream. A shear layer forms from the separation point. Flow reattachment is observed for large air pockets. The air―water interface moves with the adjacent flow. A similarity profile is obtained for the mean streamwise velocity in the shear layer beneath the air pocket. QC 20140211 </p...|$|E
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Determining the {{operating}} parameters and design considerations for dense phase (non-suspension) conveying of fine powders in pneumatic systems typically use empirical, steady-state modelling techniques, as {{the mechanisms of}} the flow behaviour are still not fully understood. However, this necessary simplification in the modelling of the dense phase flow still presents significant challenges in ensuring that the predicted outcomes adequately reflect the physical nature of the flow, and therefore provide good design guidance. This thesis represents an examination and development of techniques required for designing dense phase systems of fine powders in three specific areas; prediction of a materials potential to dense phase convey, solids friction correlations and their subsequent effect on pressure drop prediction, and modelling the solids flow from a local perspective. The dense phase capability analysis was conducted by reviewing the current predictive techniques utilising known dense phase material data. It was apparent in the thesis that there were distinct strong predictive regions in all the diagrams; however some diagrams showed areas with weak predictive regions. This work also illustrated the difficulties in comparing different <b>de-aeration</b> rate techniques and significantly, a new mode of flow predictive chart was developed which eliminated the need to determine <b>de-aeration</b> rates while still maintaining distinctly strong dense phase predictive capability. Solids friction based pressure models invariably use a power law which require determination of co-efficient/s and exponent/s. Detailed in this thesis is the research which shows why solutions do not always occur in these power law based friction models and defines a method of determining stable and meaningful values for the exponents. Furthermore, a generic air/particle parameter based solids friction model was developed which is a clear advancement in defining the frictional resistance of dense phase pneumatic conveying of powder. This thesis also proposes a new continuum model which calculates the force balance between the conveying air flow, {{the resistance of the}} particles and geometrical effects, like bends. The solution to this model provides qualitative information on fine powder dense phase flow velocity from a solids flow perspective and represents a major step in advancing dense phase modelling from a particle flow basis...|$|E

40|$|A {{hydraulic}} jump is a rapid {{transition from a}} high-velocity open channel flow to a slower fluvial motion. It is commonly experienced in streams and rivers, in industrial channels and during manufacturing processes. Herein new detailed air-water flow characteristics were measured in the developing shear layer of {{hydraulic jump}}s with partially-developed inflow. The measurements were conducted in a relatively large-size facility with large Froude numbers (5. 1 < Fr 1 < 11. 2). In the developing shear layer, the distributions of void fractions were modelled by an advective diffusion equation. The experimental data demonstrated a close agreement with the theoretical developments, and the air bubble diffusivity was observed to be independent of the Froude and Reynolds numbers although increasing linearly with {{the distance from the}} jump toe. The experimental observations highlighted a strong air entrainment rate as well as some spray and splashing above the roller. The measurements of jump toe fluctuations were close to earlier studies. The new data showed that the jump toe oscillation frequency was equal to the production rate of large-scale vortical structures in the developing shear layer, and the average convection speed of the large coherent structures was in average Vej/V 1 = 0. 32. The void fraction distributions presented a local maximum in the air-water shear layer and its value decreased quasi-exponentially with increasing distance from the jump toe. The shear zone was also characterised by a maximum in bubble count rate. The depth-averaged void fraction data demonstrated a large amount of entrained air as well as a rapid <b>de-aeration</b> of the jump roller. The velocity profiles followed closely some wall jet equations, and the air-water turbulent properties indicated some increasing turbulence levels with increasing distance from the bed. The bubble chord time distributions exhibited a broad range of entrained bubble chord times spreading over several orders of magnitudes. A detailed analysis of the longitudinal structure of the air and water chords suggested a significant proportion of bubble clustering in the developing shear region, especially immediately downstream of the jump toe. The data showed further that, in the shear layer, there was no preferential bubble chord time in the cluster structures. Overall the study highlighted that the convection of air in the mixing zone was an advective diffusion process, although there was some rapid flow <b>de-aeration</b> for all Froude numbers.

40|$|Fluidization of {{pyroclastic}} solids {{has long}} been indicated as one key to explain the enhanced mobility of dense pyroclastic gravity currents and their associated hazard. However {{there is a lack}} of characterization of the actual pattern and extent of fluidization establishing in real pyroclastic flows and some authors still raise arguments about the relevance of fluidization to the mobility of dense pyroclastic gravity currents. The present paper addresses the fluidization of pyroclastic granular solids with a specific focus on the analysis of factors that may promote homogeneous fluidization and retard solids <b>de-aeration</b> and consolidation. These factors include fines content, particle polydispersity and the establishment of shear flow. The influence of fines content and particle polydispersity has been assessed by analyzing the fluidization behaviour of mixtures of pyroclastic solids characterized by different and properly tailored particle size distributions and fines content. Pyroclastic mixtures, extracted from a Neapolitan Yellow Tuff deposit, were nearly homogeneous as to the lithological composition. The experimental campaign has been carried out with a lab-scale segmented fluidization column 120 mm ID. Experiments included quasi-steady fluidization of granular mixtures at variable gas superficial velocity as well as collapse tests from pre-set fluidized states. Results of the collapse tests were independently analyzed by looking at the time-series of the pressure drop across the bed as well as at the bed surface level as a function of time, recorded with a high-speed video camera. The study has been pursued further to analyze the effect of shear on the fluidization behaviour of pyroclastites. To this end the experimental apparatus has been modified and equipped with a rotating cylinder which could be used to impose a given shear rate to the fluidized bed. Shear rates were comparable to those that are likely to establish in real pyroclastic flows. Quasi-steady fluidization experiments and collapse tests were carried out under either stationary or sheared fluidization conditions. We compared the fluidization behaviour of mixtures characterized by different fines contents. Moreover we compared the fluidization behaviour recorded under either stationary or sheared flow conditions. Results of experimental tests highlight that both the presence of a fine fraction and the establishment of shear flow significantly influence the fluidization behaviour of pyroclastic mixtures, promoting homogeneous fluidization of the granular mixtures. The range of gas superficial velocities within which bubble-free fluidization occurs is significantly broadened by the presence of fines, by the polydisperse nature of the mixtures and by the establishment of shear. The de-aeration/consolidation times determined by the collapse tests are correspondingly much longer. Altogether, results of the present study confirm that key features of dense pyroclastic density currents, like the large fines fractional content, the polydisperse nature of the particle size distribution and strongly sheared flow conditions, exert a significant influence on fluidization, promote suppression of bubbling, retard solids <b>de-aeration,</b> enhance the mobility of the solids...|$|E

40|$|Exhaled breath {{condensate}} (EBC) analysis, {{a rather}} appealing and promising method, {{can be used}} to evaluate conveniently and non-invasively a wide range of molecules from the respiratory tract, and to understand better the pathways propagating airway inflammation. A large number of mediators of inflammation, including adenosine, ammonia, hydrogen peroxide, isoprostanes, leukotrienes, prostanoids, nitrogen oxides, peptides and cytokines, have been studied in EBC. Concentrations of such mediators {{have been shown to be}} related to the underlying asthma and its severity and to be modulated by therapeutic interventions. Despite the encouraging positive results to date, the introduction of EBC in everyday clinical practice requires the resolution of some methodological pitfalls, the standardization of EBC collection and finally the identification of a reliable biomarker that is reproducible has normal values and provides information regarding the underlying inflammatory process and the response to treatment. So far, none of the parameters studied in EBC fulfils the aforementioned requirements with one possible exception: pH. EBC pH is reproducible, has normal values, reflects a significant part of asthma pathophysiology and is measurable on-site with standardized methodology although some methodological aspects of measurement of pH in EBC (e. g. the effect of ambient CO 2, sample <b>de-aeration,</b> time for pH measurement) require further research. However, EBC pH has not been evaluated prospectively as a guide for treatment, in a manner similar to exhaled NO and sputum eosinophils. EBC represents a simple and totally non-invasive procedure that may contribute towards our understanding of asthma pathophysiology. Besides the evaluation of new biomarkers, the standardization of the already existing procedures is warranted for the introduction of EBC in clinical practice...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} verify the air content in {{hydraulic}} fluid, an instrument was needed to measure the dissolved air content before the fluid was loaded into the system. The instrument also needed to measure the dissolved air content in situ and in real time during the <b>de-aeration</b> process. The current methods {{used to measure the}} dissolved air content require the fluid to be drawn from the hydraulic system, and additional offline laboratory processing time is involved. During laboratory processing, there is a potential for contamination to occur, especially when subsaturated fluid is to be analyzed. A new method measures the amount of dissolved air in hydraulic fluid {{through the use of a}} dissolved oxygen meter. The device measures the dissolved air content through an in situ, real-time process that requires no additional offline laboratory processing time. The method utilizes an instrument that measures the partial pressure of oxygen in the hydraulic fluid. By using a standardized calculation procedure that relates the oxygen partial pressure to the volume of dissolved air in solution, the dissolved air content is estimated. The technique employs luminescent quenching technology to determine the partial pressure of oxygen in the hydraulic fluid. An estimated Henry s law coefficient for oxygen and nitrogen in hydraulic fluid is calculated using a standard method to estimate the solubility of gases in lubricants. The amount of dissolved oxygen in the hydraulic fluid is estimated using the Henry s solubility coefficient and the measured partial pressure of oxygen in solution. The amount of dissolved nitrogen that is in solution is estimated by assuming that the ratio of dissolved nitrogen to dissolved oxygen is equal to the ratio of the gas solubility of nitrogen to oxygen at atmospheric pressure and temperature. The technique was performed at atmospheric pressure and room temperature. The technique could be theoretically carried out at higher pressures and elevated temperatures...|$|E
40|$|Some thermal and {{hydraulic}} {{aspects of}} falling film evaporation were investigated. Experiments {{were made on}} two single effect evaporators. The first with a tube, 15 m long and 48 mm in diameter and the second which had the choice of one of three tubes, all 10 m long, with diameters (23, 40 & 48 mm). The apparatus was designed to enable the measurement of overall heat transfer coefficients. The effects of process variables, on the product-side and on the steam-side heat transfer coefficients, were determined by fixing conditions {{on the other side}} of the tube. Experiments were conducted on water, sucrose solution and skim milk. Aspects evaluated were temperature driving force, boiling temperature, tube liquid loading, feed temperature, non-condensable gas concentration in steam, <b>de-aeration</b> rates, product concentration (sucrose solution, milk) and feed thermal history (milk). The results obtained have been compared with theory and empirical data from the literature. A numerical integration procedure for the boiling side Nusselt number was developed to account for the change in boiling-side fluid properties over the length of the tube. The effect of boiling film Reynolds number on the overall heat transfer coefficient proved complicated with a local maximum being found in the transition flow region. A model description was developed to mimic the steam flow and condensation behaviour in the steam-side annulus of a single tube falling film evaporator. The numerical method initially chosen to solve the model proved inapplicable. A range of methods for measuring the amount of non-condensable gases present in vacuum steam were considered. The in-line measurement of pressure and temperature and the comparison of the pressure of a collected sample before and after freezing out the component were evaluated...|$|E
40|$|Alloy 22 (a nickel-chromium-molybdenum-tungsten alloy) {{is being}} {{investigated}} for use as the outer barrier of waste containers for a high-level nuclear waste repository in the thick unsaturated zone at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. Experiments were conducted to assess crevice corrosion of Alloy 22 in de-aerated aqueous solutions of chloride and nitrate salts of potassium and sodium in the temperature range 110 - 150 C (some limited testing was also conducted at 90 C). Electrochemical tests were run in neutral salt solutions without acid addition and others were run in salt solutions with an initial hydrogen ion concentration of 10 {sup - 4 } molal. The Alloy 22 specimens were weld prism specimens and <b>de-aeration</b> was performed with nitrogen gas. No evidence of crevice corrosion was observed in the range 125 - 150 C. In the 120 to 160 C temperature range, the anionic concentration of stable aqueous solutions is dominated by nitrate relative to chloride. At nominally 120 C, the minimum nitrate to chloride ratio is about 4. 5, and it increases to about 22 at nominally 155 C. The absence of localized corrosion susceptibility in these solutions is attributed to the known inhibiting effect of the nitrate anion. At 110 C, aqueous solutions can have dissolved chloride in excess of nitrate. Localized corrosion was observed at nitrate to chloride ratios up to 1. 0, the highest ratio tested. The extent of localized corrosion was confined to the crevice region of the samples, and was limited for nitrate to chloride ratios {{greater than or equal}} to 0. 3. Aqueous solution chemistry studies indicate that nitrate to chloride ratios of less than 0. 5 are possible for temperatures up to nominally 116 C. However, the exact upper temperature limit is unknown and no electrochemical testing was done at these temperatures. Limited comparison between 8 m Cl aqueous solutions of Na + K on the one hand and Ca on the other indicated similar electrochemical E{sub crit} values and similar morphology of attack, again limited to the crevice region. However, the 24 hr E{sub corr} value was higher for the Ca based solution; this is probably due to the higher acidity of this solution (Ca{sup 2 +} is slightly hydrolyzing). Intermediate-term corrosion potential (E{sub corr}) measurements indicate that moderately acidic conditions are required to achieve elevated E{sub corr} values...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} new cobalt(II) beta-keto iminato {{complexes}} and cobalt(II) salens {{have been made}} {{and the effect of}} chirality in the northern, southern and peripheral quadrants of these catalysts, with respect to induced enantiomeric excess, during the ring-opening of 1, 2 -dioxines has been determined. Synthesis of a series of cobalt beta-keto iminato complexes was achieved after modification of literature procedures used for the synthesis of manganese beta-keto iminato complexes and this procedure was applied to generate ligands with ethyl, t-butyl, (-) -bornyl, (+) -menthyl and (-) -menthyl esters and a methyl side chain. Synthesis of the cobalt salens was also achieved using a modified literature procedure, in respect to the more complex aldehydes made. It was ascertained that chirality in the northern quadrant of these catalysts, obtained by the use of optically pure diamines, was of greatest importance in introducing enantiomeric excess into the products of ring-opening of 1, 2 -dioxines; namely gamma-hydroxy enones, and chirality in the southern and peripheral quadrants was of lesser, although still significant, importance. The reaction conditions were optimised and the conditions under which the highest enantiomeric excess was introduced were determined. The ideal solvent for the ring-opening was found to be THF with a catalyst concentration between 5 and 10 mol% at a temperature of - 15 oC. These conditions were found to be applicable to all catalysts and 1, 2 -dioxines tested. Enantiomeric excess as high as 76 % could be introduced when the optimised reaction conditions were used in large scale syntheses of cyclopropane (61). LC-MS studies indicate the presence of a solvent chelated species present in the reaction mixture when the solvent used is THF, however, the use of non-chelating solvents, such as dichloromethane, did not exhibit this same solvent chelated species. Catalyst dimers were also present in the mixture when analysed by LC-MS. The presence of oxygen in the reaction mixture was found to inhibit rearrangement of the dioxine with catalyst oxygen dimers (two molecules of catalyst bound to a single molecule of oxygen) present when analysed by LC-MS, however, the catalyst could be 're-activated' by <b>de-aeration</b> of the solution and was able to introduce the same enantiomeric excess, as prior to the addition of oxygen was unaffected. It was found that not only cobalt(II) tetradentate complexes were useful in the ring-opening of meso 1, 2 -dioxines. Achiral iron(II) salen and ruthenium(II) salen were also made and shown to be capable of ring-opening the dioxine. A purchased chiral manganese(III) salen was also shown to be capable of ring-opening the 1, 2 -dioxine, however, the time taken for the rearrangement to occur led to ring closure of the gamma-hydroxy enone and dehydration of the cyclic hemiacetal. The catalysts were also applied to the enantioselective ring-opening of epoxy- 1, 2 -dioxines {{for the first time with}} a high level of success with enantiomeric excesses of between 60 and 90 % introduced with most of the catalysts. To show that these catalysts have the potential for use in the synthesis of potentially bioactive cyclopropyl amino acids, amines, acids and alcohols a small number were prepared, including both racemic and optically enriched or optically pure cyclopropanes.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Pneumatic {{conveying}} is {{a popular}} method of transporting materials in the resource and process industries because of its advantages of no dust emission, flexible conveying pipe routes and capability to convey poisonous and hazardous material. There are two primary modes of pneumatic conveying: dilute phase and dense phase. One of the significant advantages of dense-phase conveying over dilute phase {{is the ability to}} convey materials at relatively low conveying velocities, resulting in significantly reduced particle attrition and erosive wear of pipelines. For this reason, there has been a significant move towards dense-phase systems. However, whether a material can be dense-phase conveyed in conventional pipeline is critically governed by its physical properties. Bypass pneumatic conveying systems provide the capacity to transport materials that are not naturally suited to dense-phase conveying, and can significantly reduce the minimum dense-phase conveying velocity for some materials that are dense-phase conveyed in conventional pipelines. In both cases, the conveying velocity is significantly reduced, resulting in less particle degradation, lower pipeline wear and lower power consumption. Pressure drop, specific energy consumption and minimum conveying velocity are three major parameters for assessing system performance in bypass pneumatic conveying systems. An extensive experimental program was conducted as part of this study. The pressure drop was measured when transporting fly ash, alumina, sand and plastic pellets over a range of conveying parameters in a conventional pneumatic conveying system and a series of internal bypass systems of varying configurations. The bypass configuration variations included orifice diameter, internal bypass pipe diameter and flute spacing. In particular, comparisons between the conventional system and the bypass configurations were made with respect to isothermal energy consumption and minimum conveying velocity. To interpret the mechanism of material blockage inhibition associated with bypass systems, the differential pressure between the main pipe and the internal bypass pipe was measured, together with a high-speed video camera visualisation, which provided pressure and visual information on bypass pipeline flow regimes. Based on mass and momentum conservation and the ideal gas equation, a mathematical model was developed to simulate the internal bypass pneumatic conveying process considering the internal bypass pipe configuration. In the development of the model, it was necessary to determine the solids friction factor. Although a few equations have previously been proposed to predict this factor, none was found to provide sufficient accuracy. Therefore, a solids friction factor model was developed based on the partial least squares (PLS) method. Subsequently, the proposed mathematical model, together with this modified solids friction model, was applied to predict the pressure drop within bypass systems for different conveyed materials (i. e., fly ash, alumina and sand) and different bypass configurations of varying internal bypass pipe diameter, orifice diameter and bypass flute spacing. Bypass pipe diameter and bypass flute spacing are two crucial parameters for bypass system design to avoid any possible blockage and ensure reliable conveying. In this study, a design protocol for internal bypass pipe diameter and the frequency of bypass pipeline openings was established based on the physical properties of the materials to be conveyed. This analysis was based in the theories associated with <b>de-aeration</b> analysis, fluidisation analysis, the Darcy Equation and orifice plate theory. This research represents a significant step in improved understanding of blockage inhibition mechanisms within a bypass system, bypass system operational principles, bypass system modelling and design protocol and the influence of material properties and bypass configurations on specific energy consumption...|$|E
