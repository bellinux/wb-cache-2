Scannavini also noted that Lopez was [...] "involved in {{every step of the}} perfume's development". In a press release issued to announce Still Jennifer Lopez, Lopez made the following statement: [...] "It means no matter what happens, I am 'still' myself. I am 'still' Jennifer Lopez.

2500|$|Neither {{the quality}} of Bow's voice nor her Brooklyn accent was an issue to Bow, her fans, or Paramount. However, Bow, like Charlie Chaplin, Louise Brooks, and most other silent film stars, did not embrace the novelty: [...] "I hate talkies ... they're stiff and limiting. You {{lose a lot of}} your cuteness, because there's no chance for action, and action is the most {{important}} thing to me." [...] A visibly nervous Bow had to do a number of retakes in The Wild Party because her eyes kept wandering up to the microphone overhead. [...] "I can't buck progress [...]. I have to <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> can," [...] she said. In October 1929, Bow described her nerves as [...] "all shot", saying that she had reached [...] "the breaking point", and Photoplay cited reports of [...] "rows of bottles of sedatives" [...] by her bed.|$|E
2500|$|Bonham arrived near Bexar around 11 am on March 3. [...] Wearing a white bandana in his hat {{to notify}} the Texians {{that he was one}} of them, he spurred his horse and rode, unmolested, through the Alamo gate as the ring of Mexican {{soldiers}} looked on in surprise. [...] Bonham's news, that Fannin was not coming after all, reportedly demoralized the Alamo garrison. [...] Travis sent a courier that evening to the Convention with news that the Texians had thus far survived the siege with no losses. [...] He warned, however, that: [...] "I look to the colonies alone for aid; unless it arrives soon, I shall have to fight the enemy on his own terms. I will, however, <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> can under the circumstances, and I feel confident that the determined valour and desperate courage, heretofore evinced by my men, will not fail them in the last struggle, and although they may be sacrificed to the vengeance of a Gothic enemy, the victory will cost the enemy so dear, that it will be worse for him than a defeat." [...] Travis ended his letter with news that despite the dearth of ammunition, his men would fire the 18-lb cannon three times each day as proof that they still held the fort. [...] Travis then wrote several private letters and entrusted all of the communications to John W. Smith, who volunteered to sneak through the enemy lines.|$|E

"My lord, {{very sorry}} at heart I am to {{advertise}} you {{that with the}} knowledge and goodwill of the Queen's Grace I have spoken with the king our master and also with my Lord Privy Seal (i.e. Thomas Cromwell) and the other gentlemen of the council to have Mistress Katharine, your wife's daughter, {{to be of the}} privy chamber with the queen; to the which I have had answer made me that the ladies and gentlewomen of the privy chamber were appointed before her grace's coming and that for this time patience must be had". On 17 February 1540 Lady Rutland wrote more positively to Lady Lisle: [...] "My very good lady...And where ye be very desirous to have your daughter Mistress Basset {{to be one of the}} Queen's Grace's maids, and that ye would I should move her Grace in that behalf. These shall be to do your ladyship: to wit that I perceive right well the King's Highness' pleasure to be such that no more maids shall be taken in until such time as some of them that now be with the Queen's Grace be preferred. Albeit if ye will make some means unto Mother Lowe, who can do as much good in this matter as any one woman here, that she may make some means to get your said daughter with the Queen's said Grace; and in so doing I think ye shall obtain your purpose in every behalf and I for my part shall <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> can to prefer her here for I would be right glad thereof both for the great honesty that is in her".|$|E
