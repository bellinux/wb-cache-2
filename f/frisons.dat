5|$|To {{reduce the}} {{pressure}} on the Spanish infantry, the Marquis del Vasto collected his cavalry and charged over Stanley's infantry, being in turn repelled. He was nearly killed when an English soldier attacked him with a battleaxe, but a Spanish light horseman surnamed Arenas saved him by transfixing the English with his lance. Del Vasto retired from the fight and met Verdugo and Johann Baptista von Taxis, who sallied from Zutphen with several troops to join the battle. At the same time they were conversing, English troops unsuccessfully attacked Zutphen's sconce {{on the other side of}} the IJssel, which was defended by Count Herman van den Bergh with some men. For a moment, Verdugo thought that the skirmish was inside Zutphen and the town burghers had risen in arms against the few Spanish troops he had left behind the walls.

This new regime favoured the settlement of missionaries from Cornwall, and in particular one of King Hoël's sons, Saint Lunarius (or Léonor), together with Saint Pompeius (or Coupaia), Saint Tugdual's brother, or Saint Sève and numerous monks and secular priests, who started clearing the local forest of Ponthul and erected a first chapel on the location of the present [...] "Old Church".|$|E

50|$|<b>Frison</b> was {{intrigued}} by fossil dinosaur and mammoth bones he found as a youngster in Wyoming, along {{with a variety of}} archaeological features such as chipped and ground stone tools, rock shelters, rock art, and scaffold burials (Vittitow 2006). Many researchers, such as geologist Harold Cook, paleontologist Glenn Jepsen, and anthropologist Waldo Wedel were investigating the areas near the <b>Frison</b> ranch for various research projects. <b>Frison</b> {{was intrigued}} by Paleontologist Barnum Brown, of the American Museum of Natural History, who excavated dinosaur beds close to the <b>Frison</b> ranch in 1934. <b>Frison</b> brought several cigar boxes of fossils to him to identify. Barnum was the researcher who identified the bison bones at the Folsom site in New Mexico, so he discussed the Folsom complex with a young George <b>Frison,</b> who had never heard of Folsom before. These experiences were helping to shape Frison’s interest in and knowledge of both fossils and ancient American cultures (Vittitow 2006).|$|R
50|$|When he was 11 {{years old}} {{he had his}} first, and most unforgettable, {{incident}} with a bison bull in a state park near Thermopolis, about 50 mi from his home ranch, when ten loose bison wandered from the park, and <b>Frison</b> was able to secure permission to assist local cowhands to escort the bison back to the park. A young bison bull that created too much confusion among the other bison was left behind. <b>Frison</b> found the bison bull grazing {{a few days later}} and decided to outrun the bull on horseback. After both <b>Frison</b> and the bison cleared two fences, the bull stopped at the third fence, turned 180 degrees and decided to charge. <b>Frison</b> soon learned how an awkward and docile bison could soon be a danger, as both <b>Frison</b> and his horse toppled to the ground when the bull passed between the horse’s legs. However, all three managed to sustain no injury (<b>Frison</b> 2004).|$|R

40|$|Northern Europe {{from the}} 7 th- 9 th Centuries: Frisian Trade or Frankish-Frisian Trade? S. Lebecq. In this article, the author intends to make {{explicit}} {{some of the}} ideas put forward in his book: "Marchands et navigateurs <b>frisons</b> du Haut Moyen Age" (Lille, 1983). He wants to emphasize, in particular, the need for the "great Frisian trade" in the 7 th- 9 th centuries not to be underrated, so long as, when evoking Friesland and the Frisians, one takes into account the reference in contemporary sources to a vast territory located between the Scheldt and the Weser; this includes the Rhine's great delta, dominated by Dorestad, whose population, at this point, was experiencing both the Frankish and Frisian apogee. Consequently, it appears that, while the Frisians were backing up this expansion in trade with their maritime experience and technique, which was unequalled to start with, the Franks doted it with a pacific and prosperous hinterland (at least as long as the apogee lasted), making efforts to integrate it within the framework of a genuine Northern policy, the aim of which was to penetrate the Northern countries whose threat was becoming more and more perceptible under Charlemagne and Louis the Pious.

Once at Genoa, <b>Frison</b> {{was given the}} number 1 jersey, and served as the third choice goalkeeper behind Marco Amelia and Alessio Scarpi.

50|$|On 6 July 2012, <b>Frison</b> {{transferred}} to Catania in a co-ownership {{agreement on a}} five-year contract.

Since his arrival at the Sicilian club, <b>Frison</b> has served as a backup to Andújar, and has made three appearances in the 2012-13 Coppa Italia. He would go on to make his Serie A debut, in an away loss to Milan on 28 April 2013, after Andújar was handed a three-match suspension from league play. On 5 May 2013, <b>Frison</b> earned his first Serie A clean sheet in a 3-0 home victory over Siena. In June 2013, Catania signed <b>Frison</b> outright for another €700,000.|$|R
