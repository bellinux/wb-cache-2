40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present a technique, called the safety stock <b>adjustment</b> <b>procedure</b> (SSAP), which enables the {{determination}} of safety stocks that ensure target service levels in simulation studies of inventory systems. The technique is based on a netting procedure constructed so that the net requirement process and the replenishment process are independent of the safety stock and that the inventory process satisfies an invariance relation. The procedure is presented for three kinds of service measures; namely the cycle service level, the fill rate and the ready rate. In a numerical example the benefits of using the safety stock <b>adjustment</b> <b>procedure</b> are shown. In this example three wellknown lot size models are compared assuming stochastic and time-varying demand.

40|$|Voltage {{balancing}} {{among the}} series connected wind turbines {{is one of}} the main technical challenges of offshore wind farms with DC series-parallel collection systems. Due to wake effect considerations, the power generated among the series connected wind turbines does not remain the same and the series connection causes the output voltages of the turbines to be distributed in proportion to their power output. Power curtailment is required in order to prevent the turbines being subjected to over-voltage and under-voltage conditions. In this paper, a voltage <b>adjustment</b> <b>procedure</b> is proposed to eliminate over-voltage and under-voltage of wind turbines. Based on the voltage <b>adjustment</b> <b>procedure</b> and the power generation model of wind turbines, the energy curtailment of a wind farm is analyzed with the consideration of wake effect due to series connection.

Suitability of different seasonal adjustment techniques will be tested for CPI, WPI, CPI excluding food prices, and WPI excluding agricultural prices. The literature on the analysis of seasonality is composed of different groups. One group treats the seasonality as a noise that contaminates the economic data. Another group treats seasonality as a more integrated part of the modeling strategy. However, the most well-known method among the seasonal <b>adjustment</b> <b>procedure</b> is the treatment {{to the problem of}} seasonality as a noise, and this is the method that has been widely applied by the statistical offices of different countries to create official seasonally adjusted data.

40|$|Economic {{evaluations}} {{have become}} an important and much used tool in aiding decision makers in deciding on reimbursement or implementation of new healthcare technologies. Nevertheless, the impact of economic evaluations on reimbursement decisions has been modest; results of economic evaluations {{do not have a}} good record in predicting funding decisions. This is usually explained in terms of fairness; there is increasing awareness that valuations of QALYs may differ when the QALYs accrue to different patients. The problem, however, is that these equity concerns often remain implicit, and therefore frustrate explicitness and transparency in evidence-based decision making. It has been suggested that a so-called equity <b>adjustment</b> <b>procedure</b> may (partially) solve this problem. Typically this would involve the application of so-called equity weights, which can be used to recalculate the value of QALY gains for different patients. This paper explores such an equity <b>adjustment</b> <b>procedure,</b> using the equity concept of proportional shortfall. Proportional shortfall assumes that measurement of inequalities in health should concentrate on the fraction of QALYs that people lose relative to their remaining life expectancy, and not on the absolute number of QALYs lost or gained. It is the ratio of QALYs lost over the QALYs remaining. This equity concept combines elements of two popular but conflicting notions of equity: fair innings and severity-of-illness. We applied the concept of proportional shortfall to ten conditions and tentatively explored how an equity <b>adjustment</b> <b>procedure</b> using proportional shortfall might affect priority setting. Our equity <b>adjustment</b> <b>procedure</b> lowered In conclusion, our results suggest that equity can be measured and that integration of equity concerns into an economic evaluation improves the fit between economic models and reimbursement decisions. It is recommended that cost-effectiveness driven health policy systems consider equity adjustments. Cost-effectiveness, Cost-utility, Health-policy, Reimbursement...|$|R
