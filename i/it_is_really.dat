5|$|In {{the third}} series, Mark Schwartz, {{the head of}} Planet B, announces that the {{original}} Planet B is to shut down and replaced by a new service, Planet B Platinum. He claims it {{is to provide a}} new service, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> designed to kill all the rogues in the old site.|$|E
5|$|I can quite {{understand}} the Prince of Wales being much annoyed at his son's name being {{coupled with the}} thing {{but that was the}} case before I left it... we were both accused of going to this place but not together... they will end by having out in open court exactly what they are all trying to keep quiet. I wonder if <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> a fact or only an invention of that arch ruffian H.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{marked the}} first time {{composer}} Michael Giacchino worked with assistant Chad Seiter on a Fringe episode. Seiter would continue to score the rest of the season's first half. Joshua Jackson's character briefly plays the piano in a scene {{near the end of the}} episode, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> Jackson playing. The writers noted in the audio commentary that Jackson can actually play the piano, and that when he receives musical scenes, he learns the piece(s) beforehand to be able to play it for the scene.|$|E
30|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> a {{coincidence}} that Lisi came.|$|R
50|$|Given no {{opportunity}} to explain, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> brutal.|$|R

5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{receives}} {{news that}} his Aunt Shirley has died, and he informs the office. The only co-worker he invites {{to the funeral}} is Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez), who flees when Dwight begins shooting the corpse with a shotgun to ensure <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> dead. At the funeral, Dwight's family gathers: his cousins Mose (Michael Schur) and Zeke (Matt Jones), his brother Jeb (Thomas Middleditch), his sister Fannie (Majandra Delfino), his nephew Cammy (Blake Garrett Rosenthal), and his uncle Heinrich (Tom Bower). The family learns that Aunt Shirley has willed the siblings her estate {{on the condition that}} they all come back home to run it. Despite Dwight's enthusiasm in inheriting it, Fannie and Jeb are unwilling to move back in {{due to the lack of}} sophistication farm life offers. Nevertheless, Dwight convinces them to help him run the farm.|$|E
5|$|We {{shall not}} feel that the generalization, {{unqualified}} and to be taken literally, is meant to march out of its context {{to compete with the}} scientific and philosophical generalizations which dominate our world. 'Beauty is truth, truth beauty' has precisely the same status, and the same justification as Shakespeare's 'Ripeness is all.' It is a speech 'in character' and supported by a dramatic context. To conclude thus may seem to weight the principle of dramatic propriety with more than it can bear. This would not be fair to the complexity of the problem of truth in art nor fair to Keats's little parable. Granted; and yet the principle of dramatic propriety may take us further than would first appear. Respect for it may at least insure our dealing with the problem of truth at the level on which <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> relevant to literature.|$|E
5|$|Becca becomes hurt upon {{realising}} that Bradley and Stacey {{are getting}} married. While they are away {{at their own}} wedding, Becca steals a hairbrush with Archie's hair from The Queen Victoria, intending to have a DNA test done on Stacey's baby to prove if <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> Archie's. However, she has doubts and goes back with Stacey to return the brush, but is caught by Ronnie. Becca coerces Stacey to confess Archie raped her and the baby is his. However, Ronnie tells Stacey that Archie underwent an operation {{a few years back}} that left him infertile, meaning that Stacey's baby isn't his. Roxy accuses Ronnie of murdering Archie. Ronnie denies it, but tells her she found out about the rape, and that Archie once raped her. Peggy tells the two of them that when Archie was murdered, she found him lying on the floor, took her divorce papers from the bar and left him to die. Phil tells Peggy about his alibi, the shirt and that he found Archie dead on Christmas Day. Shirley then returns and says Phil has got away with it as she has not told the police anything. Meanwhile, Becca anonymously reports to the police that Bradley had a motive for the murder.|$|E

60|$|As I heard that, I {{began to}} feel that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> all over.|$|R
25|$|Although Jake Freedman was ostensibly {{the main}} shareholder, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> {{controlled}} by Frank Costello.|$|R
25|$|Thus from {{a certain}} point of view, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> preregularity, rather than regularity, that matters in these situations.|$|E
25|$|Nkotimsefuopua, certain attendants on the Queen Mother who dressed {{their hair}} in this fashion. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> a {{variation}} of the swastika.|$|E
25|$|Island of Ramandu: An {{island in}} the Eastern Sea. Though some call it the World's End, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> only the {{beginning}} of the end. Home of the star Ramandu and Aslan's table.|$|E
60|$|Razumov seemed beside himself; but {{his mind}} <b>was</b> lucid. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> a {{calculated}} outburst.|$|R
5000|$|... "Derek Taylor {{called it}} a [...] "pocket symphony". To me, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> a {{production}} achievement." ...|$|R
5000|$|I {{just thought}} <b>it</b> would <b>be</b> <b>really</b> {{interesting}} {{to take a}} look behind the curtain ... Who are these people? What do they want? What will they do to get it? I thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> fascinating and a great idea for the foundation of a story.|$|R
25|$|For object person (which {{is written}} as a {{separate}} word in the orthography although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> just a prefix), compare ma hyooho 'I saw you (sg.)', mazi hyooho 'I saw you (pl.)', and ihyóoho 'I saw him/her/it/them'.|$|E
25|$|There is also {{a variant}} of the eustele found in monocots like maize and rye. The {{variation}} has numerous scattered bundles in the stem and is called an atactostele (characterestic of monocot stem). However, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> just {{a variant of the}} eustele.|$|E
25|$|A {{cardboard}} article {{looks like}} a hardbound book at first sight, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> a paperback with hard covers. Many books that are sold as hardcover are actually of this type. The Modern Library series is an example. This type of document is usually bound with thermal adhesive glue using a perfect-binding machine.|$|E
500|$|I {{like the}} whole dance. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> {{different}} and weird for me, because I usually don't, you know, be a crazy person every time. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> so fun to do and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> {{out of the box}} and it expanded me a lot, because I'm used to competition dances where you're like, [...] "Point your toes!" [...] But this time <b>it</b> <b>was</b> like, you just need to let go and feel it.|$|R
60|$|The time seemed terribly long to Middleton before James returned, though <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> {{but a few}} minutes.|$|R
500|$|In {{the same}} book, Victoria Beckham {{wrote about the}} shoot: [...] "I think '2 Become 1' is my {{favorite}} video. [...] <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> different to the other videos–shot entirely in the studio, with high technology and loads of effects. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> weird having to sing passionately into the camera, I was feeling a right mug {{in front of all}} those people singing 'wanna make love to ya baby'." ...|$|R
25|$|On {{the opening}} {{night of the}} tour at the Hammerstein Ballroom the {{beginning}} of the show features the album cover artwork projected on a giant screen. The silhouette of Fogerty bends down, picks up a guitar from the corn, and puts it on. As the lights come on it is revealed that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> John Fogerty playing the opening song River is Waiting high in the air.|$|E
25|$|While Peter, Lucy, Susan and the beavers travel, {{they hide}} {{from what they}} believe to be the White Witch. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> Father Christmas, a sign that the Witch's reign is ending. Father Christmas gives Lucy a healing cordial, a drop of which will heal anyone who was injured, and a dagger to defend herself. Susan {{receives}} a bow and arrows and a magical horn that will summon help when blown, and Peter a sword and shield.|$|E
25|$|Next, consecrations for new {{churches and}} antimensia (the {{corporal}} containing relics {{used for the}} Divine Liturgy; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> a kind of portable altar), the ceremony of washing the altar on Holy Thursday, erection of a Stauropegion (a monastery that is exempt from {{the control of the}} local bishop, being instead subject directly to the Patriarch or Synod of Bishops), the Lesser Blessing of Waters (hagiasmos), and the Great Blessing of Waters (used on Theophany), followed by a sacramental which consists of bathing (nipter) afterwards.|$|E
3000|$|The {{founding}} of the Soviet Union has changed world history, although <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> existing socialism and not communism.|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> {{only in the}} 1960s that a {{substantial}} number of people started setting up home in Darrenwood.|$|R
60|$|The Duchess made a most piquant gesture. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> an insufferable position, {{but she was}} {{determined}} to remain graceful.|$|R
25|$|Traditionally, {{the parents}} would often name their child after an older relative, so that his/her name would {{live on in}} the family. Today, however, these are not binding {{conditions}} and are often ignored: parents often pick a name without conforming with these traditions, however <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> up to the parents as still many of them continue to observe these traditions. Traditions to name a child after the parents' best man or maid of honor or the saint on whose name day the child is born also exist.|$|E
25|$|One's first {{impressions}} {{are affected by}} {{whether he or she}} is alone or with any number of people. Joint experiences are more globally processed (see global precedence for more on processing), as in collectivist cultures. Global processing emphasizes {{first impressions}} more because the collective first impression tends to remain stable over time. Solo experiences tend to facilitate local processing, causing the viewer to take a more critical look at the target. Thus, individuals {{are more likely to have}} negative first impressions than groups of two or more viewers of the same target. At the same time, individuals are more likely to experience an upward trend over the course of a series of impressions, e.g. individual viewers will like the final episode of a TV season more than the first even if <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> the same quality.|$|E
25|$|The paschal {{sacrifice}} {{belongs to}} the shelamim, thus forming one of the sacrifices in which the meal is the principal part and indicates the community between God and man. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> a house or family sacrifice, and each household is regarded as constituting a small community in itself, {{not only because the}} lamb is eaten at home, but also because every member of the family is obliged to partake of the meal, on pain of ritual excommunication, although each man must be circumcised and all must be ritually clean. The fact that the paschal lamb might be killed only at the central sanctuary of Jerusalem, on the other hand, implies that each household was but a member of the larger community; this is indicated also by the national character of the sacrifice, which kept alive in the memory of the nation the preservation and liberation of the entire people.|$|E
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> {{cold for}} {{the time of the}} year. The {{individual}} time trial was, unsurprisingly, dominated by time trial specialists.|$|R
