25|$|Old Norse was a {{moderately}} <b>inflected</b> <b>language</b> {{with high levels}} of nominal and verbal inflection. Most of the fused morphemes are retained in modern Icelandic, especially in regard to noun case declensions, whereas modern Norwegian in comparison has moved towards more analytical word structures.|$|E
25|$|Modern Standard Arabic (also called Literary Arabic) is an <b>inflected</b> <b>language.</b> It uses {{a system}} of {{independent}} and suffix pronouns classified by person and number and verbal inflections marking person and number. Suffix pronouns are used as markers of possession and as objects of verbs and prepositions. The tatweel (ـــ) marks where the verb stem, verb form, noun, or preposition is placed.|$|E
40|$|Inflectional {{classes are}} a {{property}} of the ideal inflecting-fusional language type. Thus strongly <b>inflecting</b> <b>languages</b> have the most complex vertical and horizontal stratification of hierarchical tree structures. Weakly <b>inflecting</b> <b>languages</b> which also approach the ideal isolating type or languages which also approach the agglutinating type have much shallower structures. Such properties follow from principles of Natural Morphology and from the distinction of the descendent hierarchy of macroclasses, classes, subclasses, subsubclasses etc. and homogeneous microclasses. The main languages of illustration are Latin, Lithuanian, Russian, German, French, Finnish, Hungarian and Turkis...|$|R

It is inflected for gender, number and tense, among other things. The most {{authoritative}} known book on old Kannada grammar is Shabdhamanidarpana by Keshiraja. The first available Kannada book, a treatise on poetics, rhetoric and basic grammar is the Kavirajamarga from 850 C.E.|$|E
25|$|Skolt Sami is a synthetic, highly <b>inflected</b> <b>language</b> that shares many {{grammatical}} features {{with the}} other Uralic languages. However, Skolt Sami is not a typical agglutinative language {{like many of the}} other Uralic languages are, as it has developed considerably into the direction of a fusional language, much like Estonian. Therefore, cases and other grammatical features are also marked by modifications to the root and not just marked with suffixes. Many of the suffixes in Skolt Sami are portmanteau morphemes that express several grammatical features at a time.|$|E
25|$|About {{the same}} time, Professor Alice Kober studied Linear B {{and managed to}} {{construct}} grids, linking similar symbols in groups of threes. Kober noticed {{that a number of}} Linear B words had common roots and suffixes. This led her to believe that Linear B represented an <b>inflected</b> <b>language,</b> with nouns changing their endings depending on their case. However, some characters {{in the middle of the}} words seemed to correspond with neither a root nor a suffix. Because this effect was found in other known languages, Kober surmised that the odd characters were bridging syllables, with the beginning of the syllable belonging to the root and the end belonging to the suffix. This was a reasonable assumption, since Linear B had far too many characters to be considered alphabetic and too few to be logographic; therefore, each character should represent a syllable.|$|E

25|$|Latvian is an <b>inflecting</b> <b>language</b> {{with many}} {{analytical}} forms. Primary word stress, {{with a few}} exceptions, is on the first syllable. There are no articles in Latvian, however definiteness is expressed by inflection of adjectives. Basic word order in Latvian is subject–verb–object; however, word order is relatively free.|$|R
2500|$|Old English was a {{moderately}} <b>inflected</b> <b>language,</b> using an extensive case system {{similar to that}} of modern Icelandic or German. Middle and Modern English lost progressively more of the Old English inflectional system. Modern English is considered a weakly <b>inflected</b> <b>language,</b> since its nouns have only vestiges of inflection (plurals, the pronouns), and its regular verbs have only four forms: an inflected form for the past indicative and subjunctive (looked), an inflected form for the third-person-singular present indicative (looks), an inflected form for the present participle (looking), and an uninflected form for everything else (look). While the English possessive indicator s (as in [...] "Jane's book") is a remnant of the Old English genitive case suffix, it is now considered not a suffix but a clitic.|$|E

40|$|The phrase based {{systems for}} machine {{translation}} {{are limited by}} the phrases that they see during the training. For highly <b>inflected</b> <b>languages,</b> it is uncommon {{to see all the}} forms of a word in the parallel corpora used during training. This problem is amplified for verbs in highly <b>inflected</b> <b>languages</b> where the correct form of the word depends on factors like gender, number and tense aspect. We propose a solution to augment the phrase table with all possible forms of a verb for improving the overall accuracy of the MT system. Our system makes use of simple stemmers and easily available monolingual data to generate new phrase table entries that cover the different variations seen for a verb. We report significant gains in BLEU for English to Hindi translation. ...|$|R

2500|$|Latin is a synthetic, fusional {{language}} in the terminology of linguistic typology. In more traditional terminology, it is an <b>inflected</b> <b>language,</b> but typologists are apt to say [...] "inflecting". Words include an objective semantic element and markers specifying the grammatical use of the word. The fusion of root meaning and markers produces very compact sentence elements: amō, [...] "I love," [...] is produced from a semantic element, ama-, [...] "love," [...] to which -ō, a first person singular marker, is suffixed.|$|E
2500|$|Icelandic retains many {{grammatical}} {{features of}} other ancient Germanic languages, and resembles Old Norwegian before {{much of its}} fusional inflection was lost. Modern Icelandic is still a heavily <b>inflected</b> <b>language</b> with four cases: nominative, accusative, dative and genitive. Icelandic nouns can have one of three grammatical genders: masculine, feminine or neuter. There are two main declension paradigms for each gender: strong and weak nouns, which are, furthermore, divided in subclasses of nouns, based primarily on the genitive singular and nominative plural ending of a particular noun. For example, within the masculine nouns that have a strong declension, there is a subclass (class 1) that declines with an -s (...) in the genitive singular and -ar (...) in the nominative plural. However, there is another subclass (class 3) of strong masculine nouns that always declines with -ar (...) in the genitive singular and -ir (...) in the nominative plural. [...] Additionally, Icelandic permits a quirky subject, which is a phenomenon in which certain verbs specify that their subjects are {{to be in a}} case other than the nominative.|$|E
60|$|We {{are now in}} a {{position}} to understand what it is that distinguishes a true judgement from a false one. For this purpose we will adopt certain definitions. In every act of judgement there is a mind which judges, and there are terms concerning which it judges. We will call the mind the subject in the judgement, and the remaining terms the objects. Thus, when Othello judges that Desdemona loves Cassio, Othello is the subject, while the objects are Desdemona and loving and Cassio. The subject and the objects together are called the constituents of the judgement. It will be observed that the relation of judging has what is called a 'sense' or 'direction'. We may say, metaphorically, that it puts its objects in a certain order, which we may indicate by means of the order of the words in the sentence. (In an <b>inflected</b> <b>language,</b> the same thing will be indicated by inflections, e.g. by the difference between nominative and accusative.) Othello's judgement that Cassio loves Desdemona differs from his judgement that Desdemona loves Cassio, {{in spite of the fact}} that it consists of the same constituents, because the relation of judging places the constituents in a different order in the two cases. Similarly, if Cassio judges that Desdemona loves Othello, the constituents of the judgement are still the same, but their order is different. This property of having a 'sense' or 'direction' is one which the relation of judging shares with all other relations. The 'sense' of relations is the ultimate source of order and series and a host of mathematical concepts; but we need not concern ourselves further with this aspect.|$|E
25|$|In {{part due}} to the {{possibilities}} inherent in the Classical Chinese language and in part as an esthetic principle, many Classical Chinese poems are imprecise when it comes to gender, number, case, or other logically informative elements of speech which tend to be grammatically obligatory or difficult to avoid in various <b>inflected</b> <b>languages,</b> such as certain Indo-European languages.|$|R
5000|$|Just as with pronouns and nouns, many <b>inflected</b> <b>languages</b> {{also make}} distinctions between cases in their {{adjectives}} and (for languages that have them) articles. Thus in German, [...] "the giant" [...] {{as the subject}} of a sentence may be expressed as der Riese: nominative case. As the object of a verb, this becomes den Riesen, the accusative.|$|R
5000|$|In many <b>inflected</b> <b>languages,</b> such as Greek and Russian, some nouns and {{adjectives}} {{of foreign}} origin are left uninflected in contexts where native words would be inflected; for instance, the name Abraam in Greek (from Hebrew), the Modern Greek word μπλε ble (from French bleu), the Italian word computer, and the Russian words [...] (kangaroo) and [...] (coat, from French paletot).|$|R

40|$|The European Commission’s Europe Media Monitor (EMM) {{family of}} {{applications}} helps users monitor multilingual written online media {{for information on}} a wide variety of subject domains. Apart from gathering an average of 175, 000 news articles per day in up to 73 languages and classifying them, the EMM applications apply a number of text mining and processing tools for about twenty languages. The text processing tools include news clustering, information extraction and disambiguation (persons, organisations, locations, quotations, events), matching of name variant spellings, topic detection and tracking, cross-lingual news cluster linking, opinion mining, multi-document summarisation, and more.
