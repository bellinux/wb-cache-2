50|$|The {{station is}} located on the new line from Lauterbrunnen to Wengen, which opened in 1910 to replace the more direct but steeper {{original}} routing. It is immediately uphill of an 180 degree <b>helical</b> <b>tunnel</b> which the line uses {{in order to reduce the}} gradient.|$|E
50|$|As a result, the French {{government}} placed {{pressure on}} SNCF {{to reopen the}} route to at least Bedous, to allow the safe opening of the upper valley to tourists and also servicing regional passenger traffic. This would then allow due economic discussion to take place between the French and Spanish governments over opening the residual section to Canfranc, something which SNCF considers not in best modern operational interests, {{taking into account the}} loading gauge restrictions of the <b>helical</b> <b>tunnel</b> at Forges-d'Abel. However, supporters point out that at no point does the current line infrastructure fall below a radius of 300 m, and that minimum clearance up to the <b>helical</b> <b>tunnel</b> is a minimum of 6 m, well in accordance with modern secondary-line criteria.|$|E
50|$|From Pau, {{the line}} follows the Gave d'Aspe valley, {{reaching}} Bedous (altitude 405 m) {{in a relatively}} flat terrain. After this it climbs into the Pyrénées Mountains, with an average gradient of 25mm/M to Etsaut, and then 43mm/M to the tunnel at Somport, where the line reaches its maximum altitude of 1211 m. To reach this point from Bedous, the steeply climbing line traverses both sharp curves, and passes through 14 tunnels including the <b>helical</b> <b>tunnel</b> at Forges-d'Abel.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the many}} <b>helical</b> <b>tunnels,</b> the section between Hornberg und Sankt Georgen ended up being the most {{complicated}} section of the route, and was completed last.|$|R
40|$|We report here a {{hitherto}} undescribed form of cell migration. When {{a suspension}} of human keratinocytes is plated on a fibrin matrix, single cells invade the matrix and progress through it as rounded cells by dissolving the fibrin and thereby creating tunnels. These tunnels are cylindrical or helical, {{the latter being}} the result of constant change {{in the path of}} cellular advance around the helical axis. <b>Helical</b> <b>tunnel</b> formation is strongly promoted by epidermal growth factor. The rate of migration of the cell through the track of a <b>helical</b> <b>tunnel</b> (up to 2. 1 mm per day) is about 7 -fold greater than through a cylindrical tunnel. Pericellular fibrinolysis leading to tunnel formation depends on the presence of plasminogen in the medium and its conversion to plasmin by a cellular activator. Formation of tunnels requires that plasminogen activator be localized on the advancing surface of the keratinocyte; we propose that the tunnel is cylindrical when the site of release of plasmin is located at a fixed point on the cell surface and helical when the site of release precesses...|$|E
40|$|We have {{successfully}} synthesized a Ba 6 Ge 25 clathrate, substituting 3 Fe per formula unit by Ge. This chiral clathrate has Ge sites forming {{a framework of}} closed cages and <b>helical</b> <b>tunnel</b> networks. Fe atoms randomly occupy these sites, and exhibit high-spin magnetic moments. A ferromagnetic transition is observed with Tc = 170 K, the highest observed Tc for a magnetic clathrate. However, the magnetic phase is significantly disordered, and exhibits a transformation to a re-entrant spin glass phase. This system {{has a number of}} features in common with other dilute magnetic semiconductors. Comment: Submitted to Applied Physics Letters. Fig. 1 resolution reduced for online archive versio...|$|E
40|$|High-pressure {{polymeric}} {{structures of}} nitrogen have attracted great attention owing to their potential application as high-energy-density materials. We report the density functional structural prediction of the unexpected stabilization of a diamondoid (or N 10 -cage) structure of polymeric nitrogen at high pressures. The structure adopts a highly symmetric body-centered cubic form with lattice sites occupied by N 10 tetracyclic cages, {{each of which}} consists of 10 atoms and is covalently bonded with its six next-nearest N 10 cages. The prediction of this diamondoid structure rules out the earlier proposed <b>helical</b> <b>tunnel</b> phase and demonstrates the high-order nature of polymeric nitrogen at extreme high pressures. Diamondoid nitrogen is a wide-gap insulator and energetically more favorable than the experimental cubic gauche and previously predicted layered Pba 2 phases above 263 GPa, a pressure which is accessible to high pressure experiment.
