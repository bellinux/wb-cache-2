5|$|Many of {{the upper}} tributaries of Shamokin Creek are in the Western Middle Anthracite Coalfield and {{nearly all of the}} streams {{in this part of the}} {{watershed}} are impacted by mining, except <b>for</b> <b>Furnace</b> Run. Various mine drainage sites occur in the watersheds of all other streams in the upper Shamokin Creek watershed. None of the tributaries in the lower reaches of the Shamokin Creek watershed are affected by mining. Four tributaries of Shamokin CreekLick Creek, Millers Run, Bennys Run, and Trout Runare not designated as impaired waterbodies by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Another five tributariesNorth Branch Shamokin Creek, Locust Creek, Quaker Run, Coal Run, and Carbon Run are impaired by metals due to abandoned mine drainage. Furnace Run is impaired by channelization and habitat alteration, while Little Shamokin Creek and its tributary Plum Creek are impaired by siltation, organic enrichment, and low levels of dissolved oxygen.|$|E

The active ingredients are monocalcium aluminate CaAl2O4 (CaO · Al2O3 or CA in Cement chemist notation, CCN) and mayenite Ca12Al14O33 (12 CaO · 7 Al2O3, or C12A7 in CCN).

6000|$|China is favoured with a {{wonderful}} wealth in coal and in a good [...] supply of iron ore, two essentials to modern industrial [...] development. To indicate how little China has developed its [...] marvellous wealth in coal, this country imported, during 1917, [...] 14,000,000 tons. It is estimated that China produces now [...] 20,000,000 tons annually, but {{it is supposed to}} have richer [...] resources in coal than has the United States which, in 1918, [...] produced 650,000,000 tons. In iron ore {{it has been estimated that}} [...] China has 400,000,000 tons suitable <b>for</b> <b>furnace</b> reaction, and an [...] additional 300,000,000 tons which might be worked by native [...] methods. During 1917, it is estimated that China's production of [...] pig iron was 500,000 tons. The developments in the iron and steel [...] industry in China are making rapid strides, and a few years hence [...] it is expected that the production of pig iron and of finished [...] steel will be several millions of tons annually.... In antimony [...] and tin China is also particularly rich, and considerable [...] progress has taken place in the mining and smelting of these ores [...] during the past few years. China should jealously safeguard its [...] mineral wealth, so as to preserve it for the country's [...] welfare.[102] ...|$|E

50|$|Increasingly, furnace anneals {{are being}} supplanted by Rapid Thermal Anneal (RTA) or Rapid Thermal Processing (RTP). The {{reason for this}} is the {{relatively}} long thermal cycles of furnaces causes dopants that are being activated, especially boron, to diffuse farther than is intended. RTP or RTA fixes this by having thermal cycles for each wafer that is of the order of minutes rather than hours <b>for</b> <b>furnace</b> anneals.|$|E
50|$|Fusibility is {{the quality}} of objects of being fusible or {{convertible}} especially to heat.Materials such as solder require a relatively low melting point so that when heat is applied to a joint, the solder will melt before the materials being soldered together melt, i.e. high fusibility. On the other hand, firebricks used <b>for</b> <b>furnace</b> linings only melt at very high temperatures and so have low fusibility. Materials that only melt at very high temperatures are called refractory materials.|$|E
40|$|In 2001, DOE {{initiated}} a rulemaking process {{to consider whether}} to amend the existing energy efficiency standards <b>for</b> <b>furnaces</b> and boilers. A key factor in DOE's consideration of new standards is their cost-effectiveness to consumers. Determining cost-effectiveness requires an appropriate comparison of the additional first cost of energy efficiency design options with the savings in operating costs. This report describes calculation of equipment energy consumption (fuel and electricity) based on estimated conditions {{in a sample of}} homes that are representative of expected furnace and boiler installations. To represent actual houses with furnaces and boilers in the United States, we used a set of houses from the Residential Energy Consumption Survey of 1997 conducted by the Energy Information Administration. Our calculation methodology estimates the energy consumption of alternative (more-efficient) furnaces, if they were to be used in each house in place of the existing equipment. We developed the method of calculation described in this report <b>for</b> non-weatherized gas <b>furnaces.</b> We generalized the energy consumption calculation for this product class to the other furnace product classes. Fuel consumption calculations for boilers are similar to those <b>for</b> the other <b>furnace</b> product classes. The electricity calculations for boilers are simpler than <b>for</b> <b>furnaces,</b> because boilers do not provide thermal distribution for space cooling as furnaces often do...|$|R
