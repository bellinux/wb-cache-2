5|$|Charig et al. {{pointed to}} the {{presence}} of hairline cracks in the slabs running through both rock and fossil impressions, and mineral growth over the slabs that had occurred before discovery and preparation, as evidence that the feathers were original. Spetner et al. then attempted to show that the cracks would have propagated naturally through their postulated cement layer, but neglected to account {{for the fact that the}} cracks were old and had been filled with calcite, and thus were not able to propagate. They also attempted to show the presence of cement on the London specimen through X-ray spectroscopy, and did <b>find</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> was not rock; it was not cement either, and is most probably a fragment of silicone rubber left behind when moulds were made of the specimen. Their suggestions have not been taken seriously by palaeontologists, as their evidence was largely based on misunderstandings of geology, and they never discussed the other feather-bearing specimens, which have increased in number since then. Charig et al. reported a discolouration: a dark band between two layers of limestone – they say it is the product of sedimentation. It is natural for limestone to take on the colour of its surroundings and most limestones are coloured (if not colour banded) to some degree, so the darkness was attributed to such impurities. They also mention that a complete absence of air bubbles in the rock slabs is further proof that the specimen is authentic.|$|E

The title refers to term used in science use to describe when one <b>finds</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> wasn't intended.

500|$|As {{the last}} song created for Revival, Gomez has called [...] "Me & the Rhythm" [...] a {{personal}} favorite from the record. When asked about collaborating with Gomez, Michaels commented: [...] "I think Selena {{is a lot}} like Justin and I, in the way that…when you <b>find</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> you feel connected to, and it's real and it's honest, you don't let it go. You see where it can lead you." [...] A snippet of the track was first teased along with the official artwork on September 26, 2015. Later, the song was fully released as the album's first and only promotional single, a week before album release, followed by the album's two singles, [...] "Good for You" [...] and [...] "Same Old Love".|$|E
500|$|... {{definitely}} {{paved the}} way for the filmmakers and distributors of the world to know that there was a female audience that was really strong out there", Gabler recalls, one that was not segmented by age. She pointed to later movies, such as Mamma Mia!, 27 Dresses (written by McKenna) and Me Before You, that appeared to her to be trying to replicate The Devil Wears Pradas success with that demographic. However, Gabler feels they did not do so as well. [...] "Prada reminds me of movies that we don't have a lot of now—it harkens back to classic movies that had so much more than just one kind of plot line ... You just keep wanting to <b>find</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> can touch upon the same zeitgeist as this film." ...|$|E
500|$|Corgan insisted {{during this}} period that the band would not reform, {{although}} when Zwan broke up he announced, [...] "I think my heart was in Smashing Pumpkins [...] I think it was naive of {{me to think that}} I could <b>find</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> would mean as much to me." [...] Corgan said in 2005, [...] "I never wanted to leave the Smashing Pumpkins. That was never the plan." [...] On February 17, 2004, Corgan posted a message on his personal blog calling Wretzky a [...] "mean-spirited drug addict" [...] and blaming Iha for the breakup of the Smashing Pumpkins. On June 3, 2004, he added that [...] "the depth of my hurt [...] is only matched with the depth of my gratitude". Iha responded to Corgan's claims in 2005, saying, [...] "No, I didn't break up the band. The only person who could have done that is Billy." ...|$|E

50|$|To {{obtain an}} essay, a {{customer}} usually submits {{a form that}} describes the assignment {{that he or she}} wants completed, how many pages it needs to be, and when it needs to be completed by. On {{the opposite end of the}} transaction, the employee searches through requests until he or she <b>finds</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> sparks their interest.

500|$|Otto Frank {{spent the}} {{remainder}} of his life as custodian of his daughter's legacy, saying, [...] "It's a strange role. In the normal family relationship, it is the child of the famous parent who has the honour and the burden of continuing the task. In my case the role is reversed." [...] He recalled his publisher's explaining why he thought the diary has been so widely read, with the comment, [...] "he said that the diary encompasses so many areas of life that each reader can <b>find</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> moves him personally". Simon Wiesenthal expressed a similar sentiment when he said that the diary had raised more widespread awareness of the Holocaust than had been achieved during the Nuremberg Trials, because [...] "people identified with this child. This was the impact of the Holocaust, this was a family like my family, like your family and so you could understand this." ...|$|E
500|$|Two filmed {{scenes from}} [...] "Season 4" [...] were cut {{out from the}} airing. Instead, the scenes were {{featured}} on 30 Rocks season four DVD {{as part of the}} deleted scenes in the Bonus feature. In the first scene, in the TGS make-up room, Jenna asks Liz for a ride to Pennsylvania so that she can buy a Confederate Flag so that she can wear as a tube top on her appearance on Fox & Friends, however, Liz cannot give her a ride as she is busy. Kenneth stops by and informs Jenna that actress Mischa Barton is on the phone and wants to speak with her. Jenna, however, tells Kenneth to tell Barton that the deal is off as she has decided to go country. In the second scene, Jack and Lenny go through Kenneth's page desk, while Kenneth is participating in the page strike. The two hope to <b>find</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> would damage Kenneth's reputation but instead the two come up empty.|$|E

2500|$|Today, the retrieval-failure hypothesis, {{concerning}} {{the function of}} the memory, is more widely accepted and popularized (Schöpper-Grabe 1998:237). It says that the storage of information happens on different levels. Therefore, information or memory is not deleted, but rather, the access to the current level is blocked. Thus, the information is not available. Hansen quotes Loftus & Loftus (1976) to describe forgetting: [...] " [...] much like being unable to <b>find</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> we have misplaced somewhere" [...] (1999: 10). Cohen states, evidence for knowing that a learner is not able to [...] "find" [...] something, is the use of the so-called progressive retrieval (1986). Thereby, the learner is unable to express something that is in his mind and consequently uses an incorrect form. He eventually remembers the correct one (Cohen 1986; Olshtain 1989). Time is considered the decisive factor to measure how far the attrition has proceeded already (de Bot & Weltens, 1995).|$|E
2500|$|For {{the ending}} of the film, Iliadis {{and the rest of the}} {{creative}} team chose to include the song [...] "Dirge", by psychedelic rock band Death in Vegas. Iliadis was hoping to <b>find</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> was both [...] "ironic" [...] and [...] "innocent" [...] at the same time, given the events in the film that would precede its usage. To the director, the choice helped to illuminate the fact that nothing will be the same for this family again. Craven comments on the choice to have John Collingwood return to finish off Krug at the end. Craven explains, [...] "I also found it interesting that the Dr., whose oath 'does no harm', intentionally [...] and that it kinda shows that when seeking revenge you can become something evil yourself if you don't stop once what's been necessary is done. So I also found it intriguing that we're just seeing these wonderful, perfect people but the father comes back and goes out of his way to do this." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jackson {{developed}} body dysmorphia as {{a response}} to ridicule, stating, [...] "I'd {{look in the mirror and}} hate myself. I'd sit and cry. It was so hard for me to look at myself and <b>find</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> I liked. Not just physically, but something that was good in me". She also inflicted self-harm, banging her head against the wall when feeling unattractive. She traced her fragility to her abusive marriage to recording artist James DeBarge when she was 16 years old. Jackson recalled, [...] "It all has to do with very low self esteem. Especially going into a relationship like that very young... someone telling you things like, 'no one is ever going to want you again, you should be happy here with me.'" [...] Attempting to alter his behavior and drug addiction, she explained, [...] "I learned the hard way that you can't change a person." [...] Recalling her divorce, she revealed, [...] "There came a point when I finally said, 'You know what? I just don't care what happens.' I had to do what I wanted to but had been too afraid to. And at that point I didn't care if I got my brains beat out. I just went ahead and did it. And I got my ass kicked for it. But I'm happy that I did it, or I don't think I would be here today".|$|E

Robbie Reyes is followed by Daisy Johnson, the vigilante Quake, to the mechanic where he works after she confronted him the previous night about his actions as the Ghost Rider. Johnson believes Reyes {{when he says that}} he, as the Ghost Rider, only murders people who [...] "deserve it", and now wants him to kill her. He refuses until he <b>finds</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> proves she deserves it, despite her thinking she already does.|$|R

2500|$|Regina (Lana Parrilla) and Henry (Jared S. Gilmore) {{are going}} through Regina's stores of potions in her vault and cannot <b>find</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> will {{unfreeze}} Marian. [...] Henry surmises that Robin Hood is {{still in love with}} Regina because true love's kiss did not unfreeze her. Regina says that this time Henry may be too young to fully understand everything. Hook walks Emma home and at the door to the loft they share a kiss after Emma jokingly invites him in for coffee with her parents. During the kiss Hook notices his left hand again acting aggressively. Emma walks inside and has a moment when she seems to realize Hook's hand's actions and has a brief conversation with her parents. Hook runs into a drunk Will Scarlet trying to break into the library and punches him in the face when Will refuses to stop. Hook again is put off by his hand controlling his actions and tells Will that if he informs anyone of what happened he will be a dead man. As Mr. Gold is preparing to go home in his car with flowers Hook enters the passenger door and tells Mr. Gold to replace his hand with the hook. He refuses, saying Hook should've heeded his warnings. Hook threatens to inform Belle (Emilie de Ravin) of the dagger, but Gold then tells Hook that he has swapped the daggers and that Belle has the actual dagger. Mr. Gold says he will replace the Hook once Hook does a favor for him. He refuses to give Hook a definite date or time and Hook states he {{can find a way to}} remove it without magic. Mr. Gold tells Hook that since his magic restored the hand, only his magic can take it off. Enraged, Hook thrusts the hook into Gold's chest. Mr. Gold is unharmed, stating he would have thought Hook would have learned the first time he tried to kill Rumplestiltskin. Hook states that it wasn't him that did that, and Mr. Gold states that the next time he may harm someone else who he cares about. Hook states he will do whatever it takes and Mr. Gold says that he loves it when people say that. He tells Hook to meet him on the docks in the morning.|$|E
