500|$|Matt Norris of Cinema Blend {{stated that}} most of the events portrayed in the episode were unexpected, {{including}} Dualla's suicide, Starbuck finding her own supposed body, discovering the thirteenth tribe were Cylons, and that Ellen Tigh is the final model, but still thought the episode was among the top five Battlestar Galactica episodes in its run. Marc Bernardin of Entertainment Weekly stated that a lot had been going on in the episode, but criticised the writers' decision of having Ellen as the fifth Cylon. While Dualla's suicide was surprising for Bernardin, he was critical about the Adama scene after her suicide, stating it as [...] "some of Olmos' worst acting in the series", and that the answered questions for the episode raised more questions, but felt the episode was good overall. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger commented: [...] "What really grabs me about the show (as I discussed in today's column) is its humanity, the way its characters react to situations the way you imagine real, contemporary people might" [...] and felt that [...] "as the stakes for the characters has risen, so has the intensity of [...] performances," [...] with even the extras in character. Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune praised Nankin's directing, particularly [...] "the moment in which we see Kara Thrace, silhouetted in black against a dark blue sky, preparing to burn “her” body—that’s sent a shiver <b>down</b> <b>my</b> <b>spine.</b> That was just such a beautifully operatic image, spot-on in tone and perfectly executed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Former {{president}} Aleksander Kwaśniewski told TVN24 that, [...] "It [...] is a cursed place. It sends shivers <b>down</b> <b>my</b> <b>spine.</b> First {{the flower}} of the Second Polish Republic is {{murdered in the}} forests around Smolensk, now the elite of the Third Polish Republic die in this tragic aircraft crash when approaching Smolensk North Airport." [...] Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk stated that, [...] "The contemporary world has not seen such a tragedy". Former Polish Prime Minister Leszek Miller, who had himself suffered injuries in a helicopter crash while in office, said that Poland's aircraft {{were known to be}} in need of replacement, despite the lack of evidence that anything was wrong with the particular airplane; [...] "I once said that we will one day meet in a funeral procession, and that is when we will take the decision to replace the aircraft fleet," [...] he said. The crash fuelled anti-Russian sentiment among far right extremists, with Polish nationalists invoking the tragedy during a riot outside the Russian embassy in Warsaw in November 2013.|$|E

60|$|It was horrible. I was {{trembling}} all over, and I {{could feel the}} shivers running up and <b>down</b> <b>my</b> <b>spine</b> and the sweat standing out on my forehead.

60|$|Now, I'm a mixer. I can't help it. It's my nature. I like men. I {{like the}} taste of their boots, the smell of their legs, {{and the sound of}} their voices.

60|$|Do {{not let it}} be {{supposed}} that I had become a swash-buckler of a soldier. The cold chill of fear still crept up and <b>down</b> <b>my</b> <b>spine</b> whenever I thought of taking part in an engagement; but I was becoming so nearly a man as to desire, in case it became necessary to fight, that I might gain some honor for standing stiffly when really my heart was faint.|$|E
60|$|Strangely huddled at {{the base}} of the wall, his knees drawn up, and lying on his side, his head {{touching}} the cold stones, I saw the wasted Bartleby. But nothing stirred. I paused; then went close up to him; stooped over, and saw that his dim eyes were open; otherwise he seemed profoundly sleeping. Something prompted me to touch him. I felt his hand, when a tingling shiver ran up my arm and <b>down</b> <b>my</b> <b>spine</b> to my feet.|$|E
60|$|I now {{understood}} {{full well}} {{what was his}} plan. We were to engage the enemy in a regular battle so that the other sloop, laden with provisions, might succeed in going free. I am willing to confess that despite all my previous longings to show myself worthy of being a soldier, the cold chill of fear began to run up and <b>down</b> <b>my</b> <b>spine,</b> as I realized that the time was come when we must strive to kill while others were {{doing their best to}} shed our blood.|$|E

6000|$|... "This is the fowl-run, professor," [...] I broke in, with a moist, {{tingling}} feeling {{across my}} forehead and up <b>my</b> <b>spine.</b> I saw the professor stiffen as he walked, while his face deepened in colour.

60|$|I {{held out}} my hand. His sent a shiver <b>down</b> <b>my</b> <b>spine.</b> It was clammy cold, {{as if he}} had just come out of the sea. Thrusting our way between the denser clumps of weeds, we pushed on {{cautiously}} until we actually stood under the creature's enormous oak. So elusive and deceitful was the throbbing croon of sound that it was impossible to detect on which naked branch in the black leafiness the bird sat churring. The wafted fragrances, the placid dusky air, and far, far above, the delicate, shallowing deepening of the faint-starred blue--how I longed to sip but one drop of drowsy mandragora and forget this fretting, inconstant self.|$|E
60|$|Gradually {{there came}} a sort of vague {{beginning}} of consciousness; then a sense of weariness that was dreadful. For a time I remembered nothing; but slowly my senses returned. My feet seemed positively racked with pain, yet I could not move them. They seemed to be numbed. There was an icy feeling {{at the back of}} my neck and all <b>down</b> <b>my</b> <b>spine,</b> and my ears, like my feet, were dead, yet in torment; but there was in my breast a sense of warmth which was, by comparison, delicious. It was as a nightmare--a physical nightmare, if one may use such an expression; for some heavy weight on my chest made it difficult for me to breathe.|$|E
60|$|Within a fortnight, Sir--I may say {{it without}} boasting--I had Mlle. Goldberg senior {{in the hollow}} of my hand. On the boulevards, as soon as she caught sight of me, her dour face would be wreathed in smiles, a row of large yellow teeth would appear between her thin lips, and her cold, grey eyes would soften with a glance of welcome which more than ever sent a cold shudder <b>down</b> <b>my</b> <b>spine.</b> While we four were together, either promenading or sitting at open-air cafés in the cool of the evening, the old duenna had eyes and ears only for me, and if my friend Rochez did not get on with his own {{courtship}} as fast as he would have wished the fault rested entirely with him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{you tell}} him," [...] a subdued voice said, and the man, who I think was Steel, came near choking {{me as he}} poured more spirit than I could swallow <b>down</b> <b>my</b> throat and also <b>down</b> <b>my</b> neck.|$|R
60|$|I laughed. She laughed. We {{both looked}} at one another; {{and the next thing}} I {{remember}} was that I had drawn down Isaline's plump little face close to mine, and was kissing it vigorously, in spite of an acute darting pain at each kiss all along <b>my</b> <b>spine</b> and into <b>my</b> marrow-bones. Poor M. Claude was utterly forgotten.|$|R
