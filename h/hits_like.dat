25|$|The 1970s started {{strongly}} for NBC {{thanks to}} <b>hits</b> <b>like</b> Adam-12, Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In, Ironside, The Dean Martin Show and The Flip Wilson Show.

Disney, in particular, saw its ratings nosedive once CBS put 60 Minutes up against the program in the Sunday 7:00p.m. time slot in the 1975–76 season.|$|E

25|$|Between 1976 and 1978, Khanna {{acted in}} five box office hits and in nine films {{that were not}} commercially successful. Seven of the {{unsuccessful}} films were critically acclaimed and have achieved strong cult status over the years among the viewers; these films included Mehbooba, Bundal Baaz, Tyaag, Palkon Ki Chhaon Mein, Naukri, Chakravyuha and Janta Hawaldar, which were directed by Shakti Samanta, Shammi Kapoor, Din Dayal Sharma, Meraj, Hrishikesh Mukherjee, Basu Chatterjee and Mehmood Ali, respectively. Khanna persuaded Samanta to cast his sister-in-law Simple Kapadia opposite him in Anurodh. Films starring Rajesh Khanna and directed by Shakti Samanta tended to be commercially successful, but Mehbooba was an exception. The change from romantic and social movies to action oriented multi-starrers caused some decline of Khanna's career in terms of box office ratings. The declaration of emergency in India had angered the masses and this helped films having the lead character revolting against corruption to become successes. Actor Joy Mukherjee made Chhailla Babu, a suspense thriller in 1977, which became the only successful film of his as a director, and the unexpected success of Chhailla Babu gave a boost to the career of Khanna. However, Khanna continued basically in solo-hero socialy sober household meaningful films during this era and played a variety of characters in films of various genres. During this phase too he had box office <b>hits</b> <b>like</b> Maha Chor, Chhailla Babu, Anurodh, Karm, Tinku and Bhola Bhala.|$|E
500|$|According to Burr, {{from the}} {{earliest}} days of the studio system major releases had largely followed the same calendar modern audiences would recognize, clustered during spring, summer, and the end-of-year holidays. [...] "Yet January was still in the mix," [...] he observes. [...] "Silent-era Charlie Chaplin <b>hits</b> <b>like</b> The Kid (1921) and The Circus (1928), the Garbo/John Gilbert melodrama Flesh and the Devil (1927) and Josef von Sternberg's Last Command (1928) all came out during the first month of the year." ...|$|E

Their sound was not instrumental, nor guitar-based, but was full of [...] "rich, dense and unquestionably special" [...] "floating vocals (with) Four Freshman-ish harmonies riding over a droned, propulsive burden". The Beach Boys' {{songwriter}} Brian Wilson grew gradually more eccentric, experimenting with new studio techniques as he became associated with the burgeoning counterculture.|$|E

In 2003, Queen and her then-husband Gran Omar signed with Real Music, an independent label based in Miami, Florida and established by Jorge Guadalupe and Anthony Pérez. They {{appeared on the}} label's first album Jams Vol. 1 which Pérez released after several major record labels turned him down.

500|$|The lineup was {{the most}} {{expansive}} yet, including former John Mellencamp and Melissa Etheridge drummer Kenny Aronoff, percussionists Dan Morris and Stephen Hodges, and David Bowie pianist Mike Garson. Violinist Lisa Germano was also set to appear, but did not ultimately appear in the touring line-up. The set was mainly Adore material, with {{only a handful of}} reworked Mellon Collie songs and no songs from prior to 1995, eliminating many of their radio hits and fan favorites, with the exception of some shows performed in South American countries like Brazil and Chile, where they played for the first time, so they included old <b>hits</b> <b>like</b> [...] "Today" [...] and [...] "Disarm".|$|E
500|$|It was The Orioles, however, {{who first}} {{developed}} the city's vocal harmony sound. Originally known as The Vibra-Naires, The Orioles {{were led by}} Sonny Til when they recorded [...] "It's Too Soon to Know", their first hit and a song that is considered the first doo wop recording of any kind. Doo wop {{would go on to}} have a formative influence on the development of rock and roll, and The Orioles can be considered the earliest rock and roll band as a result. The Orioles would continue recording until 1954, launching <b>hits</b> <b>like</b> [...] "In the Chapel in the Moonlight", [...] "Tell Me So" [...] and [...] "Crying in the Chapel".|$|E

The two rappers marched down the runaway with [...] "flames erupting in the background." [...] The song was performed at all stops of their 2011–12 Watch the Throne Tour, generally as one of the opening tracks. It was performed [...] "with a Givenchy-designed American flag flashing on the stage's main screen." [...] During Jay-Z's setlist at the 2012 Radio 1's Big Weekend festival, West joined Jay-Z to perform [...] "Otis" [...] and other Watch the Throne <b>hits</b> <b>like</b> [...] "Niggas in Paris" [...] and [...] "No Church in the Wild".|$|E
500|$|After {{producing}} a single for the doo-wop band The Coasters in 1969 for Lloyd Price's Turntable Records, Norman replaced Vernon Harrell as the regular substitute (permanently, later on) for Billy Guy {{in the group}} in the 1970s, touring with them until forced to retire by ill-health in 1998, the same year his album Tobacco Road was released by independent label Bad Cat Records. In interview, Norman cited the limited repertoire, noting that fans of the band were only interested in hearing <b>hits</b> <b>like</b> [...] "Yakety Yak", [...] "Charlie Brown" [...] and [...] "Poison Ivy"; [...] "In 30 years we did maybe 10 songs." [...] Norman did have opportunity to deviate with other love songs from the 1950s, the era when The Coaster's rose to fame.|$|E
500|$|In {{the middle}} of that year, he {{recorded}} his third album, the self-titled Sylvester, which featured a cover design depicting Sylvester in male attire. The songs included on the album were influenced by dance music, and included Sylvester's own compositions, such as [...] "Never Too Late," [...] as well as covers of <b>hits</b> <b>like</b> Ashford & Simpson's [...] "Over and Over." [...] Many reviewers noted that Sylvester's image had been altered since his early career, moving him away from the glittery androgynous appearance to that of a more conventional rhythm-and-blues singer which would have wider commercial appeal. Released as a single, Sylvester's [...] "Over and Over" [...] proved a minor hit in the U.S., but was more successful in Mexico and Europe. Building on the album's release, Sylvester toured Louisiana and then Mexico City.|$|E

500|$|When Usher {{planned to}} make a new record after his third album, 8701 (2001), he decided to not branch out much with {{collaborators}} and continue building music with his previous producers. Usher again enlisted record-producer Jermaine Dupri, who had collaborated on his two previous albums, along with The Neptunes and R. Kelly, among others, to work on his fourth studio album, Confessions (2004). Dupri contacted his frequent collaborator Bryan-Michael Cox, who had also made <b>hits</b> <b>like</b> the 2001 single [...] "U Got It Bad" [...] for Usher. During an early session for the album, Dupri and Cox talked about a situation which later became [...] "Burn". At that time, Usher's two-year relationship with TLC's Chilli was flaming out. They said, [...] "Yo, you gotta let that burn... That's a song right there", and started writing.|$|E
500|$|The {{visual effects}} and slow-motion {{sequences}} induced by Slo-Mo received broad praise. Berkshire {{said that they}} are notable and eye-catching with [...] "impressively utilised 3d." [...] Hewitt said the visuals were [...] "genuinely surreal splashes of heightened colour that...don't outstay their welcome. The film's use of 3D is often excellent (including the credits) and it really comes {{to life in the}} Slo-mo scenes". Dalton said the film [...] "constantly impresses on a visual level, with a gritty style more akin to cult <b>hits</b> <b>like</b> District 9 or 28 Days Later than to standard Hollywood comic-book blockbusters." [...] Dalton said, [...] " [...] first venture into 3D is a blaze of saturated colours, gorgeous high-resolution close-ups and dazzling slow-motion sequences." [...] Dredd won The Art of 3D award at the 2013 Empire Awards, and was nominated for Best British Film and Best Science-fiction/Fantasy.|$|E
500|$|Thematically, introspection {{was also}} listed {{as one of}} the {{foundational}} themes prevalent in Rebel Heart, with genuine statements of careerist and personal reflections of Madonna and her [...] "obsessive self-regard". [...] "Ghosttown" [...] w{{as one of the}} songs carrying on the subtle messages while talking about unity and religious consciousness. Madonna reverses the concept of [...] "loss of love" [...] with her romantic idealization, according to Matthew Harden from Samesame.com.au, as the lyrics go [...] "When it all falls down, when it all falls down. We'll be two souls in a 'Ghosttown'." [...] Jim Farber from New York Daily News said that the song brings out [...] "the warmest elements of [...] voice" [...] and [...] "at times, her alto [...] sounds like Karen Carpenter's, while the melody has the enveloping calm of <b>hits</b> <b>like</b> 'Live to Tell'".|$|E

500|$|Although Lomax's single {{received}} considerable promotion, it was {{a surprising}} commercial failure. [...] "Sour Milk Sea" [...] did not chart in Britain. In America, the song reached number 117 during a two-week run on the Bubbling Under listings of Billboards Hot 100 chart, and [...] "The Eagle Laughs at You" [...] placed at number 125. [...] "Sour Milk Sea" [...] was a hit in Canada, however, peaking at number 29 on the RPM 100 in November 1968. In a 1974 feature on his career in ZigZag magazine, Lomax said that the song's release in tandem with [...] "obvious" [...] <b>hits</b> <b>like</b> [...] "Hey Jude" [...] and [...] "Those Were the Days" [...] jinxed its commercial performance, since radio stations were reluctant to risk alienating other record labels by featuring all four Apple singles too heavily on their playlists. Lomax added: [...] "So they kind of lost me in the shuffle." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} to mid-2000s, some crunk music <b>hits</b> <b>like</b> [...] "Get Low", [...] "Goodies", [...] "Yeah!" [...] and [...] "Freek-a-Leek" [...] {{produced}} by Lil Jon climbed to the Top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 charts. Both [...] "Yeah!" [...] and [...] "Goodies" [...] were the first tracks to introduce the substyle of crunk music and contemporary R, called crunk, to the public. Both of those tracks (performed by Usher and Ciara, respectively) were the main mainstream hits of 2004. Since then, crunk {{has been one of}} the most popular genres of sung African-American music, along with electropop, the genre that replaced crunk and crunk in the charts in 2008. After the album's lead single reached the summit of the US Billboard Hot 100, it spent seven weeks at number one, becoming the longest-running number-one debut single by a female artist since 1977 ...|$|E
