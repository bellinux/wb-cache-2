5|$|Bewick's art is {{considered}} the pinnacle of his medium, now called wood engraving. This is due both to his skill and to the method, which unlike the wood cut technique of his predecessors, carves against the grain, <b>in</b> <b>hard</b> box wood, using fine tools normally favoured by metal engravers.|$|E
5|$|Binary search trees lend {{themselves}} to fast searching in external memory stored <b>in</b> <b>hard</b> disks, as binary search trees can effectively be structured in filesystems.

5|$|Brummer and Bremse were {{fitted with}} masts {{similar to the}} British Arethusa-class cruisers, and {{similarly}} to the British ships, the masts could be lowered and stored on the superstructure deck. Their bow was also modeled on the Arethusa-class ships to further disguise the vessels. The ships had a complement of 16officers and 293enlisted men. They carried several smaller vessels, including one picket boat, one barge, and two dinghies. The German Navy regarded the ships as excellent sea boats, having gentle motion. The ships were highly maneuverable and had a tight turning radius, and only lost slight speed in a head sea. <b>In</b> <b>hard</b> turns, they lost up to sixty percent speed. They were very , however.|$|E

5|$|Bryn Terfel {{started off}} with a short speech and {{introduced}} the Wales Millennium Centre singers and dancers, who <b>in</b> <b>hard</b> hats and donkey jackets sang and danced {{the story of the}} construction of the building. They were later joined by all 322 participants in a chorus, including Gwyn Hughes Jones, Bryn Terfel and Dennis O'Neill sang a duet from Pearl Fishers. Diversions performed a new ballet based on one of Alun Hoddinott's works. The Welsh National Opera performed the final scene of Beethoven's Fidelio in their new home. The evening ranged across all musical types from popular to classical.|$|E
5|$|Dysprosium is used, in {{conjunction}} with vanadium and other elements, in making laser materials and commercial lighting. Because of dysprosium's high thermal-neutron absorption cross-section, dysprosium-oxide–nickel cermets are used in neutron-absorbing control rods in nuclear reactors. Dysprosium–cadmium chalcogenides are sources of infrared radiation, which is useful for studying chemical reactions. Because dysprosium and its compounds are highly susceptible to magnetization, they are employed in various data-storage applications, such as <b>in</b> <b>hard</b> disks. Dysprosium is increasingly in demand for the permanent magnets used in electric car motors and wind turbine generators.|$|E
5|$|Early in his career, Peart's {{performance}} {{style was}} deeply rooted <b>in</b> <b>hard</b> rock. He drew {{most of his}} inspiration from drummers such as Keith Moon and John Bonham, players {{who were at the}} forefront of the British hard rock scene. As time passed, he began to emulate jazz and big band musicians Gene Krupa and Buddy Rich. In 1994, Peart became a friend and pupil of jazz instructor Freddie Gruber. It was during this time that Peart decided to revamp his playing style by incorporating jazz and swing components. Gruber was also responsible for introducing him to the products of Drum Workshop, the company whose products Peart currently endorses.|$|E

5|$|Food {{items include}} snails, worms, small crustaceans, flies and beetles. The {{proportions}} of each prey species vary with season and locality. Amphipod larvae {{are important in}} Ireland and Scotland, crustaceans in Norway, and the mollusc Assiminea grayana in the Netherlands. Small fish are occasionally eaten, and <b>in</b> <b>hard</b> weather pipits may scavenge for other food, including human food litter. There is little competition from other species for food, since rocky beach specialists like the purple sandpiper take slightly larger food items, and may wade in deeper water. When food is abundant, meadow pipits may also feed on the shore, but are driven away by the Eurasian rock pipits when there is less prey available.|$|E
5|$|Hard Truths: The Art of Thornton Dial, {{on display}} from February to September 2011, {{includes}} over 70 large-scale artworks {{and is the}} largest assemblage of Thornton Dial's work ever mounted. The exhibition contextualizes Dial as a relevant, contemporary artist rather than a folk artist or outsider artist as many have portrayed him in the past. The pieces on view <b>in</b> <b>Hard</b> Truths cover a range {{of social and political}} themes, many of which address rural life in the south and the treatment of African Americans. After departing Indianapolis, the exhibition is scheduled to travel to New Orleans, Charlotte, North Carolina and Atlanta.|$|E
5|$|Structural {{proteins}} confer {{stiffness and}} rigidity to otherwise-fluid biological components. Most structural proteins are fibrous proteins; for example, collagen and elastin are critical components of connective tissue such as cartilage, and keratin is found <b>in</b> <b>hard</b> or filamentous {{structures such as}} hair, nails, feathers, hooves, and some animal shells. Some globular proteins can also play structural functions, for example, actin and tubulin are globular and soluble as monomers, but polymerize to form long, stiff fibers {{that make up the}} cytoskeleton, which allows the cell to maintain its shape and size.|$|E

5|$|The ships had {{a crew of}} twenty-one {{officers}} and 421 enlisted men. They carried a number of smaller boats, including one picket boat, one barge, two yawls, and two dinghies. They were good sea boats, but were fairly stiff and suffered from severe roll. The cruisers were maneuverable, but were slow going into a turn. Steering was controlled by a single large rudder. They lost speed only slightly in a head sea, but lost up to sixty percent <b>in</b> <b>hard</b> turns.|$|E
5|$|Woo {{draws on}} animal {{symbolism}} throughout the film. He filled {{the church with}} doves and pigeons, employing doves to represent {{the spirits of the}} people. This was the first film where Woo used the dove symbolism and he has used it to similar effect <b>in</b> <b>Hard</b> Target and Face/Off. A cat appears when Ah Jong first meets Jennie on her visit home, and secondarily when Li's partner Tsang tries to catch Ah Jong in Jennie's apartment. In Chinese culture, a cat coming into a home is an omen of ruin and poverty for its inhabitants. Both Tsang and Jennie meet negative outcomes in the film.|$|E
5|$|Aria of Sorrow {{includes}} additional {{modes of}} play that display elements {{not seen in}} the game's primary scenario.

Additionally, the player can opt to start the game <b>in</b> <b>Hard</b> Mode, offering the same gameplay at a higher difficulty level. Two other modes offer alternatives to the standard gameplay. Boss Rush mode involves the player facing all of the game's bosses in quick succession, and is unlocked after the player completes the game once. Julius Mode is an additional mode of play unlocked with the same method. The player takes control of , the member of the Belmont clan featured in the game.|$|E

5|$|The IFC makes {{loans to}} {{businesses}} and private projects generally with maturities of seven to twelve years. It determines a suitable repayment schedule and grace period for each loan individually to meet borrowers' currency and cash flow requirements. The IFC may provide longer-term loans or extend grace periods if a project is deemed to warrant it. Leasing companies and financial intermediaries may also receive {{loans from the}} IFC. Though loans have traditionally been denominated <b>in</b> <b>hard</b> currencies, the IFC has endeavored to structure loan products in local currencies. Its disbursement portfolio included loans denominated in 25 local currencies in 2010, and 45 local currencies in 2011, funded largely through swap markets. Local financial markets development is one of IFC’s strategic focus areas. In line with its AAA rating, it has strict concentration, liquidity, asset-liability and other policies. The IFC committed to approximately $5.7 billion in new loans in 2010, and $5 billion in 2011.|$|E
5|$|The battle system, {{called the}} Style-Change Active Time Battle system, uses {{elements}} from the Active Time Battle (ATB)-based Paradigm {{system from the}} first and second XIII games and bears similarities to the dressphere system featured in Final Fantasy X-2. Lightning has access to several customizable outfits (garb) with different power sets (plural: Schemata; singular: Schema). Each garb has its own separate ATB gauge, and actions for them are mapped onto the controller's face buttons, meaning that the usual menu-style ATB battle system is no longer needed: this enables Lightning to be moved around the battle field to a limited degree. The majority of the garbs and their accessories are either purchasable in the in-game shops or received upon completing quests. Stronger garbs, items, shields and weapons are unlocked <b>in</b> <b>Hard</b> Mode, along with access to more challenging areas and boss battles. Lightning can equip three Schemata directly, while having additional slots for backup costumes which can be equipped outside battle. She can be equipped with a close-combat weapon (sword, spear, etc.), a shield and a cosmetic accessory. The color scheme of each garb can be customized using both pre-set and custom color: there are options to alter both specific portions and all portions of the costume.|$|E
5|$|The male {{actors were}} asked to grow their hair and moustaches. The actors also had to diet to lose weight to achieve the look of World War II characters. The costumes had a faded look, a {{reflection}} that people of the period owned few clothes, often only two outfits. None of the actors knew the script in advance and were only informed each night before {{of what they were}} to do in their daily scenes. The Romani were not aware of the historic events that were the basis of the movie, and were only told that the story was set <b>in</b> <b>hard</b> times comparable to Ceaușescu's tenure in Romania. In the scene where the Romani revolt against the police over the death of Taloche, they were made aware of the character's death only when the scene was being shot, leading to a genuine outpouring of emotions, making their fight with the police appear more real. Gatlif later remarked in an interview that this scene stands for the actual revolt by the Romani in Auschwitz on May 16, 1944.|$|E
