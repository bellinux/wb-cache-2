5|$|A {{conflict}} arose with Paramount {{over the}} film's budget. Foster had thirty days {{to set up}} a new deal with another studio, or Paramount would own the exclusive rights. He was <b>inundated</b> <b>with</b> offers and accepted one from First Artists Group, because McQueen would receive no upfront salary, just 10% of the gross receipts from the first dollar taken in on the film. This would become very profitable if the film was a box office hit.|$|E
5|$|As governor, Wickliffe's {{primary concern}} was the Panic of 1837. He {{advocated}} raising property taxes to offset spending deficits that had climbed to $42,000 by 1839, but the legislature borrowed money to meet the current expenses instead. Wickliffe maintained the state's credit by paying the interest due on state securities. The only areas where he called for more spending were improvements in river navigation, preservation of state archives, and public education. Aside from these concerns, he was <b>inundated</b> <b>with</b> requests for clemency.|$|E
5|$|By January 2013, Morris {{had been}} so <b>inundated</b> <b>with</b> media requests, that he chose to {{discontinue}} any direct media contact (although he was an active social media participant) until he arrived at Michigan.

5|$|Off the field, the Australians were <b>inundated</b> <b>with</b> {{requests}} for social functions, including appointments with {{government officials and}} members of the royal family, and they had to juggle a plethora of off-field engagements, with 112 days of scheduled cricket in the space of 144 days. Three-day matches were often held consecutively with only the traditional Sunday rest day, although their dominance ended several matches prematurely and earned them extra rest days.|$|E
5|$|The storm dropped heavy {{rainfall}} along its path, peaking at over 40inches (1,000mm) in Texas. The worst flooding occurred in Houston, {{where most of}} Allison's damage occurred: 30,000 became homeless after the storm flooded over 70,000houses and destroyed 2,744homes. Downtown Houston was <b>inundated</b> <b>with</b> flooding, causing severe damage to hospitals and businesses. Twenty-three people died in Texas. Along its entire path, Allison caused $9 billion (2001USD) in damage and 41 deaths. Aside from Texas, the places worst hit were Louisiana and southeastern Pennsylvania.|$|E

The sheriff forbids anyone from going {{in the woods and}} hunting the tiger, but while out with Deputy Sharon Weinman (Sarah Constible), he sees Roy in the woods. They give chase, but instead find a dead tabloid reporter. The National Guard is called in to help. The sheriff later sees Roy in the woods again and warns him to stay out before taking him home and giving Rose the same warning. After he leaves, she mistakenly {{believes}} Roy told the sheriff lies about there being a tiger and chastises him.|$|E

5|$|Rainfall up to 5in (127mm) in Massachusetts {{caused a}} river in Somerset to {{overflow}} its banks, flooding nearby areas with 2feet (0.6m) of water. A large sinkhole formed on County Street and several cars were {{stranded in the}} floodwaters. Two people had to be rescued by boat when their car was overcome by the floodwaters. In addition, numerous basements were flooded. Damages in Bristol County were estimated at $25,000. A mobile home park in Plymouth County was <b>inundated</b> <b>with</b> 2.5ft (0.7m) of water, causing one home to shift off its foundation. Damages to the homes were estimated at $50,000.|$|E
5|$|The Flames were <b>inundated</b> <b>with</b> {{complaints}} from season ticket holders upset by their seat assignments {{and the cost}} of tickets. King responded to the concerns by noting that the league had purchased the game from the Flames, and the team was given a limited allotment of seats for its ticket holders. He also noted that it was possible that the event would lose money, even at ticket prices ranging between $49 and $249, but that the team brought the Heritage Classic to Calgary because the fans wanted the game to return to Canada. The Pittsburgh Penguins and Buffalo Sabres encountered similar issues allocating tickets for the Winter Classic.|$|E
5|$|Their service {{records have}} added to their fame, ranging from their work as carrier escorts in World War II to their shore {{bombardment}} duties in North Korea, North Vietnam, and the Middle East, {{as well as their}} service in the Cold War against the expanded Soviet Navy. Their reputation combined with the stories told concerning the firepower of these battleships' 16-inch guns are such that when they were brought out of retirement in the 1980s in response to increased Soviet Naval activity—and in particular, in response to the commissioning of the s—the United States Navy was <b>inundated</b> <b>with</b> requests from former sailors pleading for a recall to active duty so they could serve aboard one of the battleships.|$|E
50|$|The Lake is a reservoir, {{which means}} that it was man made. In 1974, A dam across the east fork of Plum River formed the lake.

5|$|These 7.5cm (3in) long {{chandelier}} earrings made by Cartier in 1929 {{have three}} large drops adorned with every modern cut of diamond. The earrings were purchased by Margaret Greville, who left {{them to her}} friend the Queen Mother in 1942, and Elizabeth's parents gave them to her in 1947 as a wedding present. However, she {{was not able to}} use them until she had her ears pierced. When the public noticed that her ears had been pierced, doctors and jewellers found themselves <b>inundated</b> <b>with</b> requests by women anxious to have their ears pierced too.|$|E
5|$|Another {{burden of}} his {{promotion}} to First Lord of the Admiralty was that St Vincent was <b>inundated</b> <b>with</b> letters from aspiring officers {{and their relatives}} and friends. Soliciting employment from those in positions of influence in the navy had become common practice and was a generally accepted method of securing a good posting. The more influence that an officer could draw upon, the better and often more lucrative the position. Also, due to the peace with France the navy had been reduced and employment was scarce. The First Lord could not, therefore, provide every officer of influence a position and was obliged to reject many of the letters that he received. Despite St Vincent having declared both publicly and privately that officers would be promoted or given position commensurate with their achievements and not based on their political or social influence, the letters continued to flow to the Admiralty.|$|E
5|$|Charlie's first notable storyline was {{a lesbian}} {{relationship}} with Joey Collins (Kate Bell). The storyline was implemented by producers to boost ratings and Anderson said it helped portray Charlie's vulnerable side. The storyline angered Christian and conservative oriented family groups. They complained that Home and Away had featured sexualised plotlines unsuitable for children, and Channel Seven was <b>inundated</b> <b>with</b> parental complaints stating that children {{should not be}} exposed to same-sex relationships in a family show. Viewership declined after transmission of the storyline and producers cut scenes to attune to viewers' wishes, which outraged the LGBT community. The storyline came to a natural end and Anderson and executive producer Cameron Welsh praised the plot because it portrayed a real-life situation and denounced the conservative views as outdated. Anderson stated that the storyline was a great one to portray in terms of acting.|$|E

50|$|The lake is {{recharged}} mostly via surface {{flow from}} the Dalyup river directly into Lake Gore with the Coobidge creek supplying many of the surrounding lake systems. The maximum depth of Lake Gore is recorded as 2.02 m in 1986 when the lake was <b>inundated</b> but <b>with</b> a mean depth of 1.43 m and the lake has dried up several times the last being in 1984.|$|R
50|$|There are long-discussed {{plans to}} install a fish ladder at the Rahway City Water Works to aid these fish during their {{spawning}} migrations. Fish ladders are <b>inundated</b> structures <b>with</b> small underwater steps that allow fish to navigate around a dam and continue their migration. Other approaches include removing obstructions that are inoperative or no longer serve their purpose, or improving water quality and reducing debris that obstructs passage.|$|R
5|$|Homer and Bart {{set out for}} help, {{unaware that}} Maggie is tagging along, while Marge and Lisa stay behind. Separated from Homer and Bart, Maggie is soon adopted by a family of bears. Meanwhile, Homer and Bart plummet into a raging river where they lose their clothes, but hide their nakedness with leaves and mud. Marge and Lisa make {{themselves}} comfortable by a campfire, while the boys freeze in the wilderness. The next day, Homer tries to steal honey from a beehive, only to be attacked by the bees, but evades them by jumping into a mud pit. A nature photographer takes a picture of Homer covered in mud, mistaking him for Bigfoot, and soon the forest is <b>inundated</b> <b>with</b> Bigfoot enthusiasts and reward seekers.|$|E
5|$|In August and October1955, NY344 and the Taconic State Park {{south of}} the road was <b>inundated</b> <b>with</b> floods {{damaging}} the blacktop surface highway. The reconstruction of NY344 was the center point of debate came in late February1956, where Paul Winslow, the executive secretary of the Taconic State Park Commission, who felt it was unimportant if the road was rebuilt. Local officials {{in the town of}} Copake opposed Winslow's view, noting that it only cost $35,000 (1956USD) to reconstruct the road. In April1956, the county contacted State Senator Ernest Hatfield that the road was barricaded in Copake Falls for {{the fact that there was}} no residences and the fact that the Massachusetts side was wiped out by the flooding. In November1956, a bid was let for $49,329 to reconstruct NY344 including the construction of drainage facilities and shoulders along the road. The slated completion date was for July 31, 1957. However, progress on reconstruction of NY344 was nearly complete by March1957.|$|E
5|$|In Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Observatory issued standby signal No. 1 as Soudelor {{neared the}} region on July11. The {{following}} day, the signal {{was raised to}} strong wind No. 3 due {{to the possibility of}} landfall near the region. The signal was lowered back to No. 1 later that day before they were all canceled early on July12. The emergency response system was put at level four water-disaster in preparation for torrential rainfall from Soudelor. A red alert was also declared for the affected regions. Torrential rains in Hainan caused significant flooding that killed 15 hikers and left several others missing. Numerous roads were also cut off or destroyed by landslides and 30 villages were <b>inundated</b> <b>with</b> flood waters. In Hong Kong, outer bands of Soudelor produced squally rain showers on July11. About 20 trees reportedly fell within Hong Kong, one of which struck a mini bus terminal. The direct economic loss to china was estimated at about RMB 1.71billion, ($5.4 million 2009 USD).|$|E
5000|$|Through early 2008, {{the lake}} {{remained}} well below normal levels, with {{large portions of}} the lake bed exposed above the water line. During this time, portions of the lake bed, covered in organic matter, dried out and caught fire. [...] In late August 2008, Tropical Storm Fay <b>inundated</b> Florida <b>with</b> record amounts of rain. Lake Okeechobee received almost a 1.2 m increase in water level, including local run-off from the tributaries.|$|R

5|$|In Tampico, {{near the}} {{location}} of the storm's second landfall, the streets were littered with fallen trees branches, utility poles, and billboards. Additionally, many roads were <b>inundated</b> <b>with</b> water, leaving some impassable. Nearby, over 700people fled their homes for shelter due to flooding in Ciudad Madero. One death occurred in Pueblo Viejo when a woman was crushed by a tree that fell on her house. Six other deaths occurred in Veracruz, five from a ship capsizing near Boca del Río and another after a person was caught in an undertow offshore Úrsulo Galván. Two landslides in northern Puebla left roads impassable, isolating some communities such as Tlatlauquitepec. Hundreds of homes were destroyed leaving 35,000people homeless and there was severe damage in Tuxpan, Tamiahua, Pueblo Viejo, Platon, Pánuco, Tampico Alto, and elsewhere along the coast of northeast Mexico.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, {{construction}} {{began on}} the St. Lawrence Seaway, a system of canals and locks {{that would make the}} St. Lawrence River suitable for shipping. As part of the seaway's construction, a low-lying area in Ontario and New York between Waddington, New York, and Cornwall, Ontario, would be <b>inundated</b> <b>with</b> water {{in order to create a}} navigable channel through the Long Sault rapids and to allow hydroelectric stations to be established immediately upriver from Massena and Cornwall. Much of NY37B was located within the flood-prone region due to its proximity to the river. On July1, 1958, the intentional flooding was carried out via the destruction of a cofferdam upstream, creating what is now known as Lake St. Lawrence and inundating the majority of NY37B west of Massena.|$|E
5|$|On the Texas coast, Arlene {{produced}} a small storm surge peaking at 4 ft (1.2 m) in some areas, breaching sections of Padre Island and causing flooding. The storm tide also eroded up to a foot (0.3 m) of sand from beaches {{in the lower}} Texas coast. Combined with the heavy rainfall associated with Arlene, the storm surge produced significant tidal flooding in some coastal stretches. Beach erosion occurred {{as far north as}} Galveston Bay, where tides were reported to be as high as 5 ft (1.5 m). A woman was swept into the sea off a jetty near Freeport and required rescue by United States Coast Guard. Over the waters of Lake Corpus Christi, a large funnel cloud was reported but never touched down or caused any damage. Nearby, the John F. Kennedy Memorial Causeway was completely <b>inundated</b> <b>with</b> the exception of one lane, prompting an extensive study of possible solutions to raising the causeway nearly two years later.|$|E
