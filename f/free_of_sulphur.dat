40|$|Biodiesel is an {{alternative}} fuel, produced from domestic and renewable resources. It is biodegradable, non-toxic, and essentially <b>free</b> <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> and aromatics. Biodiesel is made through a chemical process called transesterification where triglycerides is working as a main component of vegetable oils, react with an alcohol then produce fatty mono-alkyl esters and glycerol. Currently, biodiesel appears to give the best renewable alternatives to petroleum-based diesel fuel, thus this research is to investigate the possibility of promoting Moringa oleifera as a potential source of biodiesel fuel. The objective {{of this research was}} to produce biodiesel from Moringa oleifera seeds, to determine the fatty acid composition and to check the physical properties of Moringa oleifera oils. The majority of biodiesel is produced via base-catalyzed transesterification with methanol. Transestrification of Moringa oleifera oil was carried out by a standard procedure employing a 6 : 1 molar ratio of methanol to vegetable oil using potassium hydroxide (KOH) as a catalyst. The agitation speed was set at 250 rpm for 90 minutes. Based on the result, around 60 ml of biodiesel was produced and tested. The Moringa oleifera methyl esters (MOME) is tested by GCMS to get the fatty acid percentage. For physical properties, the test showed the properties of biodiesel produced with density of 872. 7 kg/m 3, cetane number of 64. 75, cloud point at 10. 7 °C, pour point at 6. 1 °C and kinematic viscosity of 4. 93 mm 2 /s.

40|$|Aims: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effects <b>of</b> <b>free</b> molecular and bound forms <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> dioxide and oxygen on the viability and culturability of a selected strain of Acetobacter pasteurianus and a selected strain of Brettanomyces bruxellensis in wine. Methods and Results: Acetic acid bacteria and Brettanomyces/Dekkera yeasts associated with wine spoilage were isolated from bottled commercial red wines. One bacterium, A. pasteurianus strain A 8, and one yeast, B. bruxellensis strain B 3 a, were selected for further study. The resistance to sulphur dioxide and the effect of oxygen addition on these two selected strains were determined by using plating and epifluorescence techniques for monitoring cell viability in wine. Acetobacter pasteurianus A 8 was more resistant to sulphur dioxide than B. bruxellensis B 3 a, with the latter being rapidly affected by a short exposure time to <b>free</b> molecular form <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> dioxide. As expected, neither of these microbial strains was affected by the bound form <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> dioxide. The addition of oxygen negated the difference observed between plate and epifluorescence counts for A. pasteurianus A 8 during storage, while it stimulated growth of B. bruxellensis B 3 a. Conclusions: Acetobacter pasteurianus A 8 can survive under anaerobic conditions in wine in the presence <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> dioxide. Brettanomyces bruxellensis B 3 a is more sensitive to sulphur dioxide than A. pasteurianus A 8, but can grow in the presence of oxygen. Care should be taken to exclude oxygen from contact with wine when it is being transferred or moved. Significance and Impact of the Study: Wine spoilage can be avoided by preventing growth of undesirable acetic acid bacteria and Brettanomyces/Dekkera yeasts through the effective use <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> dioxide and the management of oxygen throughout the winemaking process. © 2005 The Society for Applied Microbiology.

40|$|Microwave {{pyrolysis}} using a well-mixed bed of {{activated carbon}} {{as both the}} microwave absorber and reaction bed was investigated for its potential to recover useful products from waste palm cooking oil – a cooking oil widely used in Asia. The carbon bed provided rapid heating (∼ 18 °C/min) and a localized reaction hot zone that thermally promoted extensive pyrolysis cracking of the waste oil at 450 °C, leading to increased production of a biofuel product in a process taking less than 25 min. It also created a reducing reaction environment that prevented the formation of undesirable oxidized compounds in the biofuel. The pyrolysis produced a biofuel product that is low in oxygen, <b>free</b> <b>of</b> <b>sulphur,</b> carboxylic acid and triglycerides, and which also contains light C 10 -C 15 hydrocarbons and a high calorific value nearly comparable to diesel fuel, thus showing great potential {{to be used as}} fuel. This pyrolysis approach offers an attractive alternative to transesterification that avoids the use of solvents and catalysts, and the need to remove free fatty acids and glycerol from the hydrocarbon product. The pyrolysis apparatus operated with an electrical power input of 1. 12 kW was capable of producing a biofuel with an energy content equivalent to about 3 kW, showing a positive energy ratio of 2. 7 and ≥ 73 % recovery of the energy input to the system.

40|$|An {{experimental}} study of the comparative kinetics of dissolution of various synthetic copper sulphides (covellite, chalcocite, and digenite) in dilute chloride solutions {{has been carried out}} at ambient temperatures such as could be encountered in the heap leaching of secondary copper sulphide minerals. The dissolution of sized synthetic covellite particles was carried out in dilute HCl solutions containing known concentrations of copper(II) and iron(III) at controlled potentials. The results show that the rate of dissolution is similar at potentials of 600 and 650 mV, but is predictably less at a potential of 550 mV. The rate of dissolution is remarkably similar to that of chalcopyrite under similar conditions and is largely independent of Cl- and HCl concentration in the range 0. 2 to 2. 5 M and 0. 1 to 1 M respectively. The effect of temperature is significant and an activation energy of 71. 5 kJ mol - 1 was derived which confirms a chemical or electrochemical rate-determining reaction on the mineral surface. A mineralogical study of the residue after leaching shows that most of the sulphur is associated with unreacted covellite and occurs as isolated globules on the surface with over 90 % of the unreacted covellite surface <b>free</b> <b>of</b> <b>sulphur.</b> Dissolution of synthetic chalcocite and digenite is rapid compared with that of covellite under the same conditions. At a potential of 500 mV, the relatively rapid initial dissolution of chalcocite and digenite does not proceed beyond about 50 % and 45 % copper dissolution, respectively, as predicted from the thermodynamics. These results confirm the formation of a covellite-like phase as an intermediate which cannot be leached at a potential of 500 mV. An increase in the potential results in rapid dissolution of this "secondary covellite," relative to primary covellite. These results provide useful information for the conditions that should be used for the heap leaching of ores containing secondary copper sulphide minerals...|$|E
40|$|Fischer-Tropsch {{synthesis}} is {{a commercial}} technology that allows converting synthesis gas, {{a mixture of}} CO and H 2, into fuels and chemicals. This process {{could be one of}} the actors in the reduction of oil dependency of the transportation sector. In fact, it has great potential for producing synthetic fuels also from renewable sources, such as biomass, after its thermochemical conversion (gasification) into synthesis gas. Concerning the quality of a diesel fuel produced with this technology, it has a lower local environmental impact than conventional diesel, since it is practically <b>free</b> <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> and nitrogen compounds and yields lower exhaust emissions of hydrocarbons, CO and particulates. The present study focuses on the use of cobalt-based catalysts for the production of diesel. In particular, it looks upon correlation between product selectivities when varying the catalyst properties and the effect of process parameters, such as a low H 2 /CO ratio, typical of a biomass-derived synthesis gas, and the water partial pressure. Different cobalt-based catalysts, with different properties, such as conventional 3 -dimensional porous network supports (γ-Al 2 O 3, α-Al 2 O 3, TiO 2, SiO 2), Co-loading, preparation technique, etc., were investigated in the Fischer–Tropsch reaction at industrially relevant process conditions. For a set of process conditions, a linear relationship seems to exist between the selectivity to methane (and other light products) and higher hydrocarbons (identified by the industrially relevant parameter SC 5 +, selectivity to hydrocarbons with more than 4 carbon atoms) indicating a common precursor. Ordered mesoporous materials (SBA- 15), characterized by a 1 -dimensional mesoporous network, were tested as model supports and showed the possibility of occurrence of CO-diffusion limitations at diffusion distances much shorter than those required for conventional 3 -dimensional porous network supports. The linear relationship mentioned above, derived for conventional supports, was shown to be an efficient tool for indicating whether measured selectivities are affected by CO-diffusion limitations. Some of the catalysts were exposed to H 2 -poor syngas and to external water addition and the effects on the selectivity relationships were investigated. Furthermore, the possibility of internal water-gas shift of a H 2 -poor syngas with mixtures of Co/γ-Al 2 O 3 and a Cu/ZnO/Al 2 O 3 catalyst was investigated both as a technical solution for direct use of a model bio-syngas in the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, and as a means to study the effect of indigenous water removal on the reaction rate to hydrocarbons. It was found that removal of indigenously produced water slows down the reaction rate significantly. Lastly, the effect of water partial pressure on the Fischer–Tropsch rate of the Co catalyst supported on narrow-pore γ-Al 2 O 3, on its own, was studied. Inlet water partial pressure was varied by external water vapor addition at different H 2 /CO molar ratios ranging from 1 to 3. The effect of water showed to be positive on the rate for all the H 2 /CO ratios, but more significantly at H 2 -poor conditions. The nature of this positive effect on the rate seems to be unrelated to changes in amounts of amorphous polymeric carbon detectable by temperature-programmed hydrogenation of the spent catalyst.

40|$|Consumption {{of energy}} from fossil fuels has become {{inevitable}} for people life. In recent years, enormous increase occurred {{as a result}} of increase in the demand of fossil fuel. This increasing in demands of fossil fuels increases greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and there by affects the environment. (Datta A. and Mandal B. K., 2016) Biodiesel has been {{recognized as one of the}} effective green, renewable and sustainable fuels. It is a clean burning fuel derived from renewable living resources and can be derived from either animal oils or vegetable oils. The unique quality of biodiesel is less pollutant when compared to the conventional fossil diesel. The combustion exhaust of biodiesel is <b>free</b> <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> and aromatics unlike the conventional fossil diesel. (Ghoreishi S. M and Moein P., 2013) The syntheses of biodiesel without the use of catalyst but within the supercritical conditions of methanol are at the heart of every researcher. The use of supercritical transesterification facilitates simple recovery of the products and high conversion of oil within short time reaction. Moreover, supercritical transesterification tolerates feed stock with high free fatty acid and water content. (Wen et al, 2009) In this study, biodiesel production in the supercritical conditions of reactants was analysed with studying the main factors affecting the biodiesel yield. Experimental design via Box Behnken Design (BBD) was used to evaluate the influence of four independent variables (molar ratio of methanol to oil, temperature, pressure and time) on the yield of biodiesel. A quadratic polynomial model was concluded by analysing the results using Response Surface Methodology (RSM). The numerical optimisation technique concluded that the maximum yield that can be reached with minimum reaction temperature, pressure and time was 91 % at methanol to oil ratio of 37 : 1, reaction temperature of 253. 5 oC, reaction pressure of 198. 5 bar and time of 14. 8 minutes. In addition, kinetics of the reaction was studied at the optimum conditions concluding an irreversible first order reaction with reaction rate constant of 0. 0006 s- 1. Moreover, thermodynamics of the reaction was studied within the temperature range from 240 to 270 oC resulting frequency factor and activation energy of 4. 05 s- 1 and 50. 5 kJ/mol respectively. Furthermore, a kinetic reactor was simulated on HYSYS using the concluded experimental kinetic data with the achieved optimum conditions resulting in conversion of 91. 7 % with 0. 7 % relative error from the experimental results. Finally, a complete plant process simulation design using HYSYS program was developed. The process includes the developed kinetic reactor, methanol recovery and product separation units.

Due to small intake <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> in soil, plants that draw off large amounts <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> and {{due to the fact that}} sulphur is swiftly washed off from the topsoil to deeper soil layers where it is inaccessible to the crops, there is often lack <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> in the nourishment of crops being grown, which regards both sulphur demanding crops, such as oil crops, and crops such as cereals where lack <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> has not manifested itself as much so far. Soil contains sulphur in an inorganic and organic form. Inorganic sulphur in agricultural land is represented to a lesser extent than organic sulphur, but it is the main source <b>of</b> plant available <b>sulphur</b> and it is a highlydynamic soil component. In soil, it is usually contained in the form of sulphates. Intake of sulphates and their concentration in the soil solution impacts pH, amount of Fe and Al oxides and behaviour of soil colloids. We can influence the content <b>of</b> inorganic <b>sulphur</b> by supplying mineral fertilizers, but we cannot increase the overall long-term supply <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> in soil in this way. Long-term and main supply <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> in soil is represented by organic sulphur bound in sulphur amino acids, sulfolipids, sulphonic acids and sulphated polysaccharides. We can influence this component <b>of</b> the overall <b>sulphur</b> content by organic fertilization, green manuring, afterharvest residues and sewage sludge application...|$|R

40|$|In {{the current}} study, the {{evolution}} of the composition of fly ash (FA), since the beginning of operation of the lignite-fired power station of Amynteon-Filotas [Steam Electric Station (SES) Amynteon-Filotas] in Greece, is presented. The respective evolution of the feedcoal-composition is also showed. This power station began to operate in 1987. Before that, it was predicted that lignite fly ash would turn from strongly calcareous to barely pozzolanic. Moreover, the variation <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> (%) (both total and volatile) in feedcoal had revealed that fly ash would not often meat the specifications {{to be used in the}} production process of concrete, due to the excessive percentage presence of SO 3. These predictions were eventually confirmed in the 23 years of operation of the power station. During these years SO 3 (%) kept alternating, rendering-in some cases-fly ash suitable for use in cement industry applications. The periodical changes of the SO 3 concentration in fly ash were attributed to the <b>free</b> (volatile) <b>sulphur</b> <b>of</b> feedcoal as well as to the excess of FeS 2, which had also a serious effect on the daily power production process (severe erosion of the metallic surfaces of boiler). A number of solutions for tackling this phenomenon are suggested in this study: discard of specific FA grain fractions, intense monitoring of the material and its effective mixture-homogenization and selective mining of lignite. © Springer Science+Business Media B.

40|$|Lucerne {{was grown}} in {{nutrient}} solutions at adequate and “deficient” levels <b>of</b> <b>sulphur,</b> nitrogen, phosphorus or potassium. Volatile losses <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> were then measured when shoots and roots were oven dried at 80 °C for 48 hours. Small but significant losses <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> occurred during oven drying. Losses from shoots ranged from 4. 2 to 13. 9 ugS/g dry weight, which represented from 0. 38 to 0. 66 % <b>of</b> the total <b>sulphur</b> content <b>of</b> the shoot. Losses from roots ranged from 12. 0 to 47. 8 ugS/g dry weight, representing 0. 82 to 1. 77 % <b>of</b> the total <b>sulphur</b> content <b>of</b> the root. Decreases in supply of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium or sulphur generally decreased the amount <b>of</b> volatile <b>sulphur</b> lost by oven drying shoots. Losses from roots generally decreased when supply <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> decreased, but increased when nitrogen and potassium supply decreased, and were generally unaffected by phosphorus supply. The organic sulphur {{concentration in the}} tissue was linearly correlated with absolute losses <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> (r = 0, 799 for shoots; r = 0. 822 for roots), the amount <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> lost per unit dry weight (r = 0. 469 for shoots; r = 0. 381 for roots) and the percentage <b>of</b> the total <b>sulphur</b> released as volatile sulphur (r= 0. 937 for shoots; r = 0. 970 for roots).

40|$|Sulphur in coals can {{and does}} cause {{environmental}} problems. Much {{of the worlds}} coal contains relatively high percentages <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> and is therefore environmentally undesirable.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Results of the {{experiment}} conducted in sandy loam soils during 2006 - 07 and 2007 - 08 revealed that quality parameters of cane juice and jaggery were positively and significantly influenced by the application <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> irrespective <b>of</b> sources <b>of</b> <b>sulphur.</b> Application <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> at 100 kg/ha had significantly influenced the quality of juice but it was comparable with the application <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> at 80 kg/ha which was reflected in quality of jaggery. There is an increase of 1. 27 units in juice sucrose was observed with the application <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> at 80 kg/ha. But sources did not differ markedly on juice quality and jaggery quality parameters. As Gypsum is cheapest source compared to Elemental sulphur, {{it can be concluded}} that maximum returns can be obtained at 80 kg S/ha through Gypsum application.

40|$|Ulcerative colitis (UC) is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} condition of unclear etiology affecting the large bowel, most commonly the rectum and extending proximally {{in a continuous}} fashion. The overall principle in the pathophysiolgy of ulcerative colitis is the dysregulation of the normal immune system against an antigenic trigger leading to a prolonged mucosal inflammatory response. The diagnosing of UC is made by combining the clinical picture, tissue biopsy with the endoscopic appearance of mucosal ulceration, friable, edematous, erythematous granular appearing mucus. The approach to therapy of UC has been dependent on severity of symptoms with frontline therapy being salicylate based sulfasalazine. Newer formulations of salicylates based drugs with fewer side-effects have been developed. These are <b>free</b> <b>of</b> the <b>sulphur</b> component and are composed of 5 -ASA, without the sulfapyridine carrier molecule. Mesalamine {{is one of these}} 5 -ASA based agents that are currently available and indicated for treatment of UC. In mild/moderate active disease mesalamine has response rates between 40 %– 70 % and remission rates of 15 %– 20 %. Considering that the efficacy of 5 -ASA is dose dependent, 4. 8 g/day and 2. 4 g/day {{have been shown to be}} the optimal dosages for mild-moderate distal active disease and for maintenance therapy, respectively. Patients with moderately active ulcerative colitis treated with 4. 8 g/d of mesalamine are significantly more likely to achieve overall improvement at week 6 compared to patients treated with 2. 4 g/d. In the setting of left-sided distal colitis (proctitis), topical (rectal) formulations have been found to be superior to oral aminosalicylates at inducing remission. Mesalamine has been shown to be safe in short term use with a dose-response efficacy without dose-related toxicity...|$|R
40|$|Dimethylsulphide (DMS) is an {{important}} sulphurcontaining trace gas produced by enzymatic cleavage of its precursor compound, dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSP), which is released by marine phytoplankton in the upper ocean. After ventilation to the atmosphere, DMS is oxidised to form sulphate aerosols which in the unpolluted marine atmosphere are {{a major source of}} cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). Because the microphysical properties of clouds relevant to climate change are sensitive to CCN concentration in air, it has been postulated that marine sulphur emissions may play a r䬥 in climate regulation. The Subantarctic Southern Ocean (41 - 53 ө is relatively <b>free</b> <b>of</b> anthropogenic <b>sulphur</b> emissions, thus sulphate aerosols will be mainly derived from the biogenic source of DMS, making it an ideal region in which to evaluate the DMSclimate regulation hypothesis. We have extended a previous modelling analysis of the DMS cycle in this region by employing a coupled general circulation model (CGCM) which has been run in transient mode to provide a more realistic climate scenario. The CGCM output provided meteorological data under the IPCC/IS 92 a radiative forcing scenario. A DMS production model has been forced with the CGCM climate data to simulate the trend in the seatoair DMS flux for the period 1960 to 2080, corresponding to equivalent CO 2 tripling relative to preindustrial levels. The results confirm a minor but nonnegligible increase in DMS flux in this region, in the range + 1 % to + 6 % predicted over the period simulated. Uncertainty analysis of the DMS model predictions have confirmed the positive sign for the change in DMS flux, that is a negative DMS feedback on warming.
