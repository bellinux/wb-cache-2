5|$|Bird's nest custody is an {{uncommon}} {{form of joint}} custody in which, rather than having the children <b>go</b> <b>from</b> <b>one</b> parent's house to the other parent's house, the parents {{move in and out}} of the house in which the children constantly reside. The goal of this arrangement is to shift the burden of upheaval and moving between homes onto the parents rather than the children. However, due to the high cost of maintaining three households, one for each parent and one for the children, it's rarely a viable option in a custody case.|$|E
5|$|The House of Foryx is {{a magical}} house {{situated}} somewhere deep in another forest, surrounded by perpetual winter. It is an octagonal building flanked by four octagonal pillars. Here all times meet, and characters can <b>go</b> <b>from</b> <b>one</b> time to another. Characters can {{come into the}} building from any time, but can leave it in their own time only if another from that time stands outside the main door; otherwise they are lost in time, and may even {{end up in a}} time when the House of Foryx did not exist, giving them no chance of ever returning. The house is named after Foryx, a huge elephantine creature in the Septimus Heap universe.|$|E
25|$|In the 1930s, {{using an}} {{extended}} {{version of the}} Stern–Gerlach apparatus, Isidor Rabi and colleagues showed that by using a varying magnetic field, one can force the magnetic moment to <b>go</b> <b>from</b> <b>one</b> state to the other. The series of experiments culminated in 1937 when they discovered that state transitions could be induced using time varying fields or RF fields. The so-called Rabi oscillation is the working mechanism for the Magnetic Resonance Imaging equipment found in hospitals.|$|E

25|$|It is {{also known}} as {{chessboard}} distance, since in the game of chess the minimum number of moves needed by a king to <b>go</b> <b>from</b> <b>one</b> square on a chessboard to another equals the Chebyshev distance between the centers of the squares, if the squares have side length one, as represented in 2-D spatial coordinates with axes aligned to the edges of the board.

25|$|Visibility {{can vary}} from nearly {{unlimited}} to low, or non-existent, and can <b>go</b> <b>from</b> <b>one</b> extreme to {{the other in a}} single dive. While a less-intensive kind of diving called cavern diving does not take divers beyond the reach of natural light (and typically no deeper than 100ft, and penetration not further than 200ft), true cave diving can involve penetrations of many thousands of feet, well beyond the reach of sunlight. The level of darkness experienced creates an environment impossible to see in without an artificial form of light. Caves often contain sand, mud, clay, silt, or other sediment that can further reduce underwater visibility in seconds when stirred up.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the bridge}} opening, commuters would <b>go</b> <b>from</b> <b>one</b> bank {{to the other}} either by using the Humber Ferry that ran between Corporation Pier at Hull and New Holland Pier at New Holland, Lincolnshire or by driving via the M62 (from 1976), M18 (from 1979) and M180 motorways, {{crossing}} the River Ouse near Goole (connected to the Humber) in the process. Until the mid-1970s, the route south was via the single-carriageway A63 and the A614 (via grid-locked Thorne where it met the busy A18 and crossed the Stainforth and Keadby Canal at a swing bridge bottleneck, and then on through Finningley and Bawtry, meeting the east-west A631).|$|E

He received all of the lands and houses of his father: Borjomi, his large rural estate in Georgia where he enjoyed living and preferred to work; Mikhailovskoe outside St Petersburg; an enormous palace on the Neva in St Petersburg, and the great estate Grushovka in southern Ukraine. His primary residence was the palace on the Neva, which was so large that his brother Grand Duke Sergei, who lived with him, used a bicycle to <b>go</b> <b>from</b> <b>one</b> side to the other. Between his two residences in the capital region, he employed more than 400 servants.|$|E
25|$|The {{traveling}} salesman {{problem is}} {{what is called a}} conventional optimization problem. That is, all the facts (distances between each destination point) needed to determine the optimal path to follow are known with certainty and the goal is to run through the possible travel choices {{to come up with the}} one with the lowest total distance. However, let's assume that instead of wanting to minimize the total distance traveled to visit each desired destination, we wanted to minimize the total time needed to reach each destination. This goes beyond conventional optimization since travel time is inherently uncertain (traffic jams, time of day, etc.). As a result, to determine our optimal path we would want to use simulation - optimization to first understand the range of potential times it could take to <b>go</b> <b>from</b> <b>one</b> point to another (represented by a probability distribution in this case rather than a specific distance) and then optimize our travel decisions to identify the best path to follow taking that uncertainty into account.|$|E

They have no other settlement or location than comes from traveling around with the cows. They kill all of these they wish, and tan the hides, with which they clothe themselves and make their tents, and they eat the flesh, sometimes even raw, and they also even drink the blood when thirsty. The tents they make are like field tents, and they set them up over some poles they have made for this purpose, which come together and are tied at the top, and when they <b>go</b> <b>from</b> <b>one</b> place to another they carry them on some dogs they have, of which they have many, and they load them with the tents and poles and other things, for the country is so level, as I said, {{that they can make}} use of these, because they carry the poles dragging along on the ground.

2500|$|Görgei had at his {{disposition}} {{the following}} troops {{to attack the}} imperial army: the I., II., III. corps {{and a part of}} the VIII. corps, which were totally 32,907, or according to other sources 31,348 soldiers, with 143 batteries. The plan was to attack along the Vág river, on a terrain fragmented with hills, woods, rivers, marshes, which did not made possible a quick advancement of the Hungarians, but prevented the enemy to use its numerical superiority, hoping also to force the Austrian troops south to the Danube, to stop their attack there towards Győr and Komárom. [...] First the II. corps had to start the attack, crossing the Little Danube at Guta, than building a bridge across the river at Aszódpuszta, than advancing across the Little Danube and the Vág, to build two bridges on the latter at Farkasd and Negyed. After this the III. corps will cross too the Vág river advancing towards Galánta. The left wing of the attacking corps had to be covered by the Kosztolányi brigade of the VIII. corps. The I. corps had to show activity before Sempte and Szered divert the attention, thus preventing the imperial brigades to help their attacked comrades from South. This plan was had many problems. The officers from the Central Operational Bureau which elaborated it, were not {{aware of the fact that}} between the Vág and the Little Danube, the terrain is very marshy, and because of this only the ramparts could be used to <b>go</b> <b>from</b> <b>one</b> village to another. This made the task of the attacking army almost impossible to fulfill. The other problem of the plan was that it put all the responsibility of the success of the military actions on the II. corps [...] "shoulders", because in the case of an unsuccessful attack of them against Királyrév and Zsigárd condemned the III. corps to inactivity.|$|E
