5|$|Still Jennifer Lopez is a women's {{fragrance}} {{endorsed by}} American entertainer Jennifer Lopez, released by Coty, Inc. in October 2003. The fragrance contains notes of sake, mandarin, <b>early</b> <b>grey,</b> pink freesia, honeysuckle, orange flower, sandalwood, amber and orris. Still Jennifer Lopez {{followed in the}} footsteps of Glow by JLo, an international success that shaped the fragrance industry and began a trend in the celebrity endorsement of fragrance. The release of Still Jennifer Lopez was not anticipated due to the negative publicity generated from Lopez's film Gigli (2003) and a fall-out with her manager Benny Medina. Several fragrance industry experts noted that it could ruin the success of Glow by JLo. It was also noted that her public image at the time would have irreparable effects on the fragrance's performance.|$|E

Edie soothed him and kissed him as he went along, but never said a word for good or evil till he had finished.|$|E
60|$|And yet I was aroused that night, {{or rather}} in the <b>early</b> <b>grey</b> of the morning. It was just half-past four by my {{chronometer}} when something {{caused me to}} sit up in my berth wide awake and with every nerve tingling. It was a sound of some sort, a crash with a human cry {{at the end of}} it, which still jarred upon my ears. I sat listening, but all was now silent. And yet it could not have been imagination, that hideous cry, for the echo of it still rang in my head, and it seemed to have come from some place quite close to me. I sprang from my bunk, and, pulling on some clothes, I made my way into the cabin.|$|E

I sprang from my bunk, and, pulling on some clothes, I made my way into the cabin. At first I saw nothing unusual there. In the cold, grey light I made out the red-clothed table, the six rotating chairs, the walnut lockers, the swinging barometer, and there, at the end, the big striped chest. I was turning away, with the intention of going upon deck and asking the second mate if he had heard anything, when my eyes fell suddenly upon something which projected from under the table. It was the leg of a man--a leg with a long sea-boot upon it. I stooped, and there was a figure sprawling upon his face, his arms thrown forward and his body twisted. One glance {{told me that it was}} Armstrong, the first officer, and a second that he was a dead man. For a few moments I stood gasping. Then I rushed on to the deck, called Allardyce to my assistance, and came back with him into the cabin.|$|E

The inlets were fed by a single-barrel Stromberg carburettor in common and fitted with a traditional Kettering ignition by coil and distributor. The electric system was six volts in the 48-215 and FJ.

40|$|One of {{the factors}} {{postulated}} to drive the aging process is the accumulation of DNA damage. Here, we provide strong support for this hypothesis by de-scribing studies of mice with a mutation in XPD, a gene encoding a DNA helicase that functions in both repair and transcription and that is mutated in the human disorder trichothiodystrophy (TTD). TTD mice were found to exhibit many symptoms of premature aging, including osteoporosis and kyphosis, osteoscle-rosis, <b>early</b> <b>greying,</b> cachexia, infertility, and reduced life-span. TTD mice car-rying an additional mutation in XPA, which enhances the DNA repair defect, showed a greatly accelerated aging phenotype, which correlated with an in-creased cellular sensitivity to oxidative DNA damage. We hypothesize that aging in TTD mice is caused by unrepaired DNA damage that compromises transcription, leading to functional inactivation of critical genes and enhanced apoptosis. DNA damage, particularly oxidative lesions derived from normal metabolism, is though...|$|R

50|$|For {{this purpose}} we must ignore modern {{political}} boundaries {{and look at}} historical developments in the Greater Iran, a vast area covering the Caucasus, Mesopotamia, Anatolia, and Central Asia, beyond the frontiers of present-day Iran. The geography of this region, with its high mountain ranges, {{plays a significant role}} in many of the mythological stories. The second millennium BC is usually regarded as the age of migration because of the emergence in western Iran of a new form of Iranian pottery, similar to earlier wares of north-eastern Iran, suggesting the arrival of the Ancient Iranian peoples. This pottery, light grey to black in colour, appeared around 1400 BC. It is called <b>Early</b> <b>Grey</b> Ware or Iron I, the latter name indicating the beginning of the Iron Age in this area.|$|E

50|$|The Bird Nest Roys were a New Zealand rock group, {{formed in}} the mid-1980s in the hills west of Auckland, New Zealand. They {{released}} one self-titled album on Flying Nun Records. Despite being from Auckland, they are frequently cited {{as one of the}} bands that played the Dunedin Sound, named after the city of Dunedin on the South Island of New Zealand. A six-piece, the band was fronted by members Big Ross and Little Ross, and featured future Snapper and The 3Ds member, Dominic Stones, on guitar. The group attracted an odd ensemble of characters with their own coded language, and a combination of Westie and <b>early</b> <b>Grey</b> Lynn culture. They frequently practised on an old 50 acre farm called Nosnaws, {{in the foothills of the}} Waitakere Ranges. Being part of the Flying Nun record label enabled the band to play numerous gigs up and down New Zealand.|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} {{is that of}} a solid middle-class rental property, well-detailed, nicely finished, with generously-sized rooms and high ceilings, but without the ornate entrance vestibule common to more flamboyant owner-occupier, late 19th century residences. The front door opens directly into the main hallway, which runs east-west, off which are the former front parlour and dining room to the right. These rooms do not open into each other, but have back-to-back fireplaces which share a double chimney. The parlour has an <b>early</b> <b>grey</b> marble fireplace surround, but that in the dining room is a later and unsympathetic brick surround. A door in the rear (west) wall of the dining room opens onto a service passageway which leads to the kitchen house at the rear, and off which, to the right, are a small china pantry adjacent to the dining room, and a maid's room beyond this. The service passageway, which also runs east-west, leads to the now enclosed verandah which ran east-west beside the detached kitchen house. It is not clear whether a rear verandah initially ran the width (north-south) of the main building, but there is evidence of a former verandah between the maid's room in the core and the kitchen. This space has been enclosed as a bathroom; it has weatherboards externally on the north side and a s interior.|$|E
5000|$|A coastal {{city with}} a major {{maritime}} industry, Dundee's harbour has long been of importance. As early as 1447 King James II of Scotland granted letters patent to Dundee's Council granting {{them the right to}} collect dues on goods coming in via the port. In 1770 the harbour was remodelled by John Smeaton, who introduced water tunnels to tackle the perennial problems caused by the vast quantities of silt washed down the Tay which formed sandbanks in the harbour, thus blocking it. In 1815 a Harbour Act was passed which moved control of the harbour from the Town Council to a Board of Harbour Commissioners. Under their guidance the harbour was greatly expanded from the 1820s with the addition of King William IV Dock, Earl Grey Dock, Victoria Dock and Camperdown Dock. In 1844 a triumphal arch made of timber was erected at the entrance of the harbour to mark the arrival, by sea, of Queen Victoria on her way to her first holiday in Aberdeenshire. In 1849 a competition was held to design a replacement permanent structure. The competition was won by a design submitted by James Thomas Rochead. The resulting Royal Arch quickly became one of Dundee's most iconic symbols. [...] King William IV Dock and the <b>Early</b> <b>Grey</b> Dock were filled in in the 1960s during the construction of the Tay Road Bridge and its approach roads and the Royal Arch was demolished at the same time. The Arch {{is the subject of a}} famous photograph by the photojournalist Michael Peto.|$|E

Thus, the overall MPB-attack stage {{at the time of}} burning was estimated based on time since peak red-attack stage: red (1 to 2 years) or <b>early</b> <b>grey</b> (3 to 5 years; as per Wulder et al. 2006). For each wildfire, the proportion of red and grey attack in the burned stands was then estimated from the survey data, corroborated by photographs and field reports.
