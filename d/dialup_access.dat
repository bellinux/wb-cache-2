50|$|In recent years, {{the number}} of {{consumers}} using <b>dialup</b> <b>access</b> has dropped and as the Classic and Plus clients were restricted to <b>dialup</b> <b>access,</b> their subscriber count began to drop. Because the WebTV client was subsidized hardware, the company had always required individual subscriptions for each box, but with the subsidies ended, MSN started offering free use of MSN TV boxes to their computer users who subscribed to MSN, as an incentive to not stray to discount dialup ISPs.|$|E
50|$|The ADSL service {{provides}} continuous, {{unlimited access}} {{at high speeds}} to all national RESTENA network services, and to the Internet and GÉANT. <b>Dialup</b> <b>access</b> via ISDN or analog modem gives less demanding users access to network services.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{extends the}} {{analysis}} of the relative impacts of socioeconomic factors on households' decision to subscribe to <b>dialup</b> Internet <b>access</b> [Chaudhuri, A., Flamm, K., & Horrigan, J. (2005). An analysis of the determinants of Internet access, presented at the Telecommunications Policy Research Conference, Washington, DC, October 1 - 3] to the decision to subscribe to broadband. A simple cumulative utility (ordered logit) model is rejected in favor of a partial proportional odds model, and the authors found that the decision to purchase any access at all, and the decision to upgrade to broadband, may be affected differently by various socioeconomic factors. The own-price elasticity of broadband demand is statistically significant and has a substantial coefficient value. The cross-price sensitivity of broadband demand with respect to dialup price is also statistically significant, and supports the notion of the two services being substitutes.

50|$|Before the {{introduction}} of unmetered, '0800' <b>dialup</b> Internet <b>access</b> and broadband, Karoo {{was one of the}} first ISPs in the country to offer untimed Internet calls. It followed on from the success of Demon Internet's Point of Presence (PoP) in Hull. This was set up with the initial formation of Demon in June 1992. Demon allowed users in Hull to make untimed 5.5p+vat calls to access the Internet via dialup accounts. Karoo followed on a few years after Demon removed their local PoP. Karoo Xtra allowed Kingston Communications customers untimed access for the price of a 5.5p (+ VAT) call charge (and a subscription fee of £15 per month).|$|R
50|$|Additionally, WWA {{offered the}} {{ubiquitous}} dialup SLIP/PPP service to customers. WWA {{was the first}} ISP in Chicago to offer <b>dialup</b> <b>access</b> as far out as Rockford, IL, and Milwaukee, WI, doing so by operating physical points of presence. One of the Chicago POPs was located at Marist High School.|$|E
5000|$|In 1997, 3Com {{merged with}} USRobotics (USR), {{a maker of}} dial-up modems, and owner of Palm, Inc.. USRobotics was known for its Sportster line of consumer-oriented modems, {{as well as its}} Courier business-class modem line. This merger spelled the {{beginning}} of the end of 3Com. In addition to consumer network electronics, USRobotics was a well-known manufacturer of a <b>dialup</b> <b>access</b> server, the [...] "Total Control Hub", rebadged by 3Com as the [...] "Total Control 1000", based largely on its Courier modem technology. This key business product competed against Cisco's AS5200 access server line in the mid-1990s as the explosion of the Internet led to service provider investment in <b>dialup</b> <b>access</b> server equipment. 3Com continued the development of the Total Control line until it was eventually spun off as a part of Commworks, which was then acquired by UTStarcom.|$|E

5000|$|In {{place of}} an overlay, {{the area of}} most of Pinellas County (except Oldsmar) and western Pasco County were split off on February 1, 1999 and {{received}} area code 727. [...] Oldsmar kept area code 813 despite being in Pinellas. Oldsmar was a tributary service area to the Tampa area, and tributary routes were in general not cut across NPA boundaries. Oldsmar is also located on the Pinellas/Hillsborough line, and was the only local exchange that was a local call to both cities. Most of the <b>dialup</b> Internet <b>access</b> numbers and alarm system reporting numbers in Tampa and St. Petersburg were located in Oldsmar. GTE and the Florida Public Service Commission wanted to spare alarm companies and ISPs the cost of reprogramming and replacing systems that could not handle 10 digit dialing.|$|R

5000|$|Sensing {{the promise}} of the Internet, Mahoney built Internet {{functionality}} into the Exec-PC BBS in 1994. When calling into certain numbers known as [...] "gold nodes," [...] the BBS member was connected to an Internet shell account on servers run by IBM's VNET division. This solution quickly proved to be slow and confusing to members, so Mahoney set up a separate division of the company that same year to provide <b>dialup</b> <b>access</b> via both shell accounts and Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP). Unlike the BBS, ExecPC Internet provided service exclusively to individuals in Wisconsin and northern Illinois.|$|E
5000|$|In 1995 Deutsche Telekom {{renamed the}} BTX service as [...] "T-Online". In Spring 2000, T-Online {{becomes the first}} major ISP in Germany to offer a {{flat-rate}} dialup plan for consumers. This was important because local telephone calls in Germany, including <b>dialup</b> <b>access</b> to ISPs, were not offered on a flat price per call (i.e., unlimited) basis. The flat-rate service was also offered to customers with ISDN connections at the same price as for analog service.

50|$|The third {{method used}} to acquire {{newsgroup}} posting access, and the method {{that was used}} the most, was to use volunteers {{to go out and}} purchase Internet <b>dialup</b> <b>access</b> from an Internet service provider using a false name and address, and using cash or a money order. These persons were given a large amount of cash and air fare to fly to a city specifically to acquire Internet access for later use in sporging. One such volunteer, Tory Bezazian, later left Scientology and confessed to performing this task, giving the names of the Scientology staff members who were allegedly in charge of the sporgery project.|$|E

40|$|As {{the life}} cycle of {{information}} products has become increasingly digital from “cradle to grave, ” the nature of electronic information management has dramatically changed. These changes have brought new strategies and methods as well as new issues and challenges. At the bottom line the services are increasingly delivered to a desktop from distributed publishers or information providers. Information organizations act either as primary information providers or as brokers between the user and the primary service provider. There has also been a significant reorientation from “ownership ” of materials to “access ” to information. This paper covers developments in the factors and strategies affecting collection management and access. It discusses major trends in electronic user services including electronic information delivery, information discovery and electronic reference. Finally, it addresses the challenges in user and personnel education in response to this electronic environment and an increasingly information literate user population. One of the earliest significant implementations of electronic information management for libraries and information centers began in the 1960 s and 1970 s with <b>dialup</b> <b>access</b> to remote electronic databases such as those provided by Dialog and LexisNexis. The Internet has further contributed to the success of remot...|$|E
40|$|With the {{increase}} popularity in multimedia applications over the Internet, {{the demand for}} broadband infrastructure is increasing. Currently, the main path to the Internet from home is through the <b>dialup</b> <b>access</b> network, which can only achieve up to 56 Kbps. At this rate, the access network has become bottleneck for broadband and multimedia applications. Various technology has been proposed to increase the data rate at the access level. Due {{to the fact that}} traffic at the access network is asymmetrical in nature, several high speed asymmetrical access network are proposed, I. e. its downstream bandwidth is significantly higher than that of upstream. Example of asymmetrical access network includes the Asymmetrical Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL), Direct Satellite Broadcast system (DSB) and cable modem network. Among all, ADSL is the most popular and simplest to deploy. TCP, a connection oriented protocol, ensure end-to. end transfer reliability. This is possible with the acknowledgement strategy, which requires an acknowledgement (ack) to be returned for each data packet transmitted. However, this feedbackcontrol mechanism using ack works well only with symmetric network. In asymmetrical network, the returned ack will suffer from the delay due to the low reverse bandwidth. The forward sending rate, which depends on ack arrival, will in turn be reduced. This will result in low utilization of the high speed (downstream) channel and therefore throughput degradation. With {{the increase}} in deployment of asymmetrical network in the future, TCP needs to be extended to target for both asymmetrical and symmetrical network in order to maintain its performance level. We proposed two extensions to TCP: (1) adaptive accumulative acknowledgement scheme and (2) congestion detection mechanism. Unlike some of the proposals that involve the network layer to implement their solution, our solution features end-to-end interoperability to fulfill the OSI layering concept. The first extension features adaptive ack frequency reduction. Frequency of ack can be reduced by sending an ack for more than one data packet received. This is possible because acks are accumulative. By reducing ack frequency, the traffic load of the reverse channel can be relieved significantly, thereby increasing the forward channel utilization. By adaptive, we refer to the ability for the ack reduction factor to synchronize with the number of data packets sent in a batch. With this synchronization, the ack reduction factor varies according to the connection state, be it at the beginning (slow start), during loss recovery or during congestion avoidance. This is a significant improvement over other ack frequency reduction solutions proposed previously where a fixed reduction factor is used. Congestion detection mechanism is another new idea that we have introduced into TCP. This mechanism enables TCP to detect the relative delays experienced by consecutive data packets in the forward link as well as that between consecutive acks in the reverse link. This is possible by just a simple manipulation on the TCP timestamp values collected in each round trip. As the delay in forward and reverse link is distinguishable, TCP is able to differentiate between congestion in the forward channel from the one in the reverse channel. With existing timestamp option used to evaluate the round trip time, TCP can be aware of congestion in the connection but cannot identify the congested path...|$|E
