We compared the importance of grazing by herbivores on algal turfs on two zones with marked differences in terms of benthic composition, herbivore biomass and grazing pressure, the <b>inner</b> <b>flat</b> and crest, of an inshore reef on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. A combination of herbivore exclusion cages and transplants of coral rubble covered by algal turfs between reef zones was used to examine changes in algal turfs over a 4 -day experimental period. In situ crest turfs had lower algal height, sediment loads and particulate content than reef flat turfs. Caged samples on the crest exhibited an increase in all three variables. In contrast, in situ and caged treatments on the flat presented algal turfs with similar values for the three analysed variables, with high algal height and heavy particulate and sediment loads. In the absence of cages, reef flat turfs transplanted to the crest had decreased algal height, total particulate material and particulate inorganic content, while the opposite was found in crest turf samples transplanted to the flat. Our results highlight the dynamic nature of algal turfs and the clear differences in the relative importance of herbivory in shaping turf length and sediment load between the reef crest and <b>inner</b> <b>flat...</b>|$|R

40|$|International audiencePocket beaches are commonworldwide but {{documentation}} {{on their}} hydrodynamics, sediment transport processes andmorphodynamics is sparse compared to open beaches. Studies of headland-bound pocket beaches in coral reef environments are evenmore sparse notwithstanding {{an increasing number}} of studies of coral reef shorelines. Mayotte Island, in the Indian Ocean, is characterised by a coral reef-lagoon complex and numerous pocket beaches nested between volcanic headlands. Field experimentswere conducted in order to: comparewave attenuation fromthe outer barrier reef to the <b>inner</b> reef <b>flat</b> fronting three pocket beaches, analyse attenuation patterns across an <b>inner</b> reef <b>flat</b> fronting one of the beaches, and document beach morphological changes. Wave attenuation exceeded 90 %, and increased as wave heights increased, with maximum attenuation of moderately large waves (significant wave heights> 1. 8 m) generated by a category 1 cyclone (Jokwe). Further attenuation across the <b>inner</b> reef <b>flat</b> was neither related to reef width nor correlated with water depth, but the correlation was slightly better with relative wave height. Attenuation increased as relative wave height decreased. Patterns of beach morphological change driven by residual wave energy following reef attenuation were strongly affected by the degree of beach embayment. Mtsanga Gouela and Trevani beaches are characterised by a low bay indentation conducive to longshore sediment mobility, and provide rare examples of inferred rotation of reef-fronted beaches, similar to rotation of drift-aligned beaches in non-reef settings. In contrast, Dapani beach, nested in a strongly indented bay, was dominated by seasonal cross-shore sand exchange. In addition to reef-driven wave attenuation, an important factor differentiating pocket beaches in coral reef settings and non-reef settings is the <b>inner</b> reef <b>flat.</b> The historical stability of the beaches suggests that the outer limits of cross-shore seasonal or cyclone-induced sediment movements are set over these reef flats. Further studies of reef-fronted pocket beaches will require better elucidation of the effect of the fronting reef flats on sediment transport and storage, and of the role of heterogeneity in sediment grain size and density common in reef environments in volcanic settings...|$|R

40|$|Radiative {{transfer}} in a protoplanetary accretion disk, which is irradiated by the protostar, is examined under the non-gray frequency-dependent treatment, including the anisotropic scat-tering effect. Due to irradiation heating, the disk {{is divided into}} an <b>inner</b> optically thick <b>flat</b> disk, a middle optically thick flared disk, and an outer optically thin flared disk. In each regime, emer-gent intensities {{as well as other}} radiative quantities are analytically obtained under the Eddington approximation. In the <b>inner</b> <b>flat</b> disk, where the disk is optically thick and viscous heating is dom-inant, we obtain solutions for the case of vertically uniform heating. In the middle flared disk, where the disk is optically thick and geometrically flared due to irradiation heating, we obtain solutions for the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) case under the assumption of a lin-ear Planck function. In the outer flared disk, where the disk is optically thin and flared due to irradiation heating, we obtain solutions for the LTE case of a vertically isothermal disk. The temperature structure is consistent with that seen in previous studies, while disk intensities are different from those in previous cases without anisotropic scattering. We found that anisotropic scattering enhances the emergent intensity in the poleward direction, when forward scattering dominates. As a result, in addition to the usual limb-darkening effect, the protoplanetary disk also becomes bright in the poleward direction...|$|R

40|$|There {{is little}} {{published}} {{information on the}} distribution, abundance, seasonality and ecological roles of benthic algae on the Great Barrier Reef, although they are of fundamental importance in the ecology of coral reef communities. This study sought to provide information on algal community dynamics in two contrasting reef-flat zones: the live coral and algal turf-dominated outer flat, and the fleshy macroalgaldominated <b>inner</b> <b>flat,</b> at Heron Reef, Great Barrier Reef, Queensland, Australia. Algal community structure on dead coral limestone was studied on {{the inner and outer}} reef flat over a three-year period (from May 1986 to February 1989), and algal transplant and grazer exclusion experiments were carried out to determine the role of grazers in producing and maintaining community structure. Changes during ecological succession provide useful information about structuring processes in natural communities. Algal succession was studied using artificial substratum (concrete), because it provided a flat surface which offered logistical advantages over naturally contoured coral substratum, and because previous studies had found that artificial substrata adequately mimicked natural surfaces in marine successional studies. Succession on natural substratum was also studied for comparison, using coral clumps which had died after a bleaching episode in February 1987. The effects of season on algal succession, were investigated using four series of concrete settlement blocks, started in February, May, August and November 1986. The effect of habitat complexity on succession was examined by comparing succession on an exposed concrete surface with succession on a protected concrete surface provided with crevices. Each successional study lasted two years. Cover data for all algal species present on each sample were obtained using a sampling grid of sixty points, and these data were analysed using the non-parametric multivariate analysis program, PRIMER. A total of 105 algal taxa were identified in this study, with 101 of these recorded in the natural reef flat algal community over the three-year period. Fleshy macroalgae were the dominant group on the <b>inner</b> <b>flat</b> (56 % cover), and filamentous turf algae iv were dominant on the outer flat (47 % cover). The importance of water temperature and grazing intensity in producing the differences in distribution of these two groups of algae on the reef-flat were considered. Temperature was rejected as a factor, because there was virtually no temperature difference between the two sites over a two-year period. Grazing was found to be an important factor, based on a much higher rate of damage to algal transplants on the outer flat than on the inner flat; and on the development of higher algal biomass on caged than on uncaged concrete settlement blocks. Between 58 and 69 algal taxa were recorded {{in each of the four}} successional studies on exposed concrete, 78 taxa were recorded on protected concrete, and 85 taxa were recorded on bleached coral. Algal successional trajectories were similar on concrete and on bleached coral, but the rate varied substantially. Succession was fastest on bleached coral, slowest on exposed concrete, and intermediate on protected concrete. On all substrata, at both sites, early dominance by green and brown filamentous algae decreased over time, while the abundance of other forms increased. Dominance in terms of cover by early successional algae (in particular Ectocarpus) was prolonged on concrete in comparison to bleached coral, and this effect was stronger on exposed concrete than on protected concrete. It is hypothesised that inhibition of algal community development on concrete because of a relatively dense growth of early successional algae was due to one or both of two factors: 1. Reduced algal recruitment due to a lower level of substratum heterogeneity; and 2. Reduced grazing by the dominant herbivores in the system, parrotfish (Family Scaridae), because of the hardness of concrete. Succession was faster on the outer flat than on the <b>inner</b> <b>flat.</b> On bleached coral, succession to a community similar to the natural background algal community took between three and nine months on the outer flat, and between one and two years on the <b>inner</b> <b>flat.</b> There was no regular seasonal pattern of change in the reef flat algal community over a three-year period, but during early succession, algal community structure was v strongly influenced by season of initial exposure of the concrete settlement blocks. However, this variability did not persist, and by two years all seasonal series of blocks had similar communities. Six species of algae were fertile within 10 days of establishment, including the common early successional algae Ectocarpus, Enteromorpha and Polysiphonia, illustrating the potential of these species for rapid exploitation of available space. The results of this study provide much needed baseline data on algal community dynamics on the southern Great Barrier Reef, and on succession and community development following a bleaching episode. Given the rapid and dense colonisation of bare substratum by algae, and the very low rate of recruitment by corals, it seems that corals will be at a disadvantage in maintaining their abundance in this reef flat environment if coral bleaching becomes a regular event...|$|R

40|$|Strong {{evidence}} {{for the presence of}} a warped Keplerian accretion disc in NGC 4258 (M 106) has been inferred from the kinematics of water masers detected at sub-parsec scales. Assuming a power-law accretion disc and using constraints on the disc parameters derived from observational data, we have analyzed the relativistic Bardeen-Petterson effect driven by a Kerr black hole as the potential physical mechanism responsible for the disc warping. We found that the Bardeen-Petterson radius is comparable to or smaller than the inner radius of the maser disc (independent of the allowed value for the black hole spin parameter). Numerical simulations {{for a wide range of}} physical conditions have shown that the evolution of a misaligned disc due to the Bardeen-Petterson torques usually produces an <b>inner</b> <b>flat</b> disc and a warped transition region with a smooth gradient in the tilt and twist angles.

40|$|ABSTRACT; Enormous, unbarred tidal flats fringe {{the west}} coast of Korea. Near Inchon, where spring tides range between 8 and 9 m, the {{intertidal}} expanse is more than 4 km wide. This low-energy regime results in three broadly intergradational modern subfacies: l) an intensely bioturbated <b>inner</b> <b>flat</b> of slightly sandy mud; 2) a wavy-bedded middle flat of clayey sandy silt; and 3) a ripple-laminated outer flat ofbioturbated sandy silt to silty sand. The mid-flat region is less distinctive sedimentologically than the mixed-flat subfacies of North Sea tidal flats, and flaser and lenticular bedding are rare. Well-developed intertidal drainage networks and landward salt marshes are absent. Vibracores reveal two additional sequences underneath e modern sequence, their contacts defined by scour horizons and shell concentrations. The basal sequence is characterized by irregularly oxidized, intensely-to-totally bioturbateed argillaceous sediment with scattered wavy beds and abundant in-situ plant roots. These deposits uggest a transition from a shallow subtidal or low intertidal environment to a salt marsh developed in a protected intracoastal setting. The overlying intermediate s quence also consists principally of bioturbated fine sediment with scattered wavy beds, but plant roots are absent.

40|$|For pulsars born in supernovae, the {{expansion}} of the shocked pulsar wind nebula is initially in the freely expanding ejecta of the supernova. While the nebula is in the <b>inner</b> <b>flat</b> part of the ejecta density profile, the swept-up, accelerating shell is subject to the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. We carried out 2 and 3 -dimensional simulations showing that the instability gives rise to filamentary structure during this initial phase but does not greatly change the dynamics of the expanding shell. The flow is effectively self-similar. If the shell is powered into the outer steep part of the density profile, the shell is subject to a robust Rayleigh-Taylor instability in which the shell is fragmented and the shocked pulsar wind breaks out through the shell. The flow is not self-similar in this phase. For a wind nebula to reach this phase requires that the deposited pulsar energy be greater than the supernova energy, or that the initial pulsar period be in the ms range for a typical $ 10 ^{ 51 }$ erg supernova. These conditions are satisfied by some magnetar models for Type I superluminous supernovae. We also consider the Crab Nebula, which may be associated with a low energy supernova for which this scenario applies. Comment: 10 pages, ApJ, submitte...|$|R

For radii exterior to 1 kpc, tilted-ring orientations lie on an arc, on {{a plot of}} polar-inclination versus position-angle, suggesting that precession following a merger can account for the ring morphology.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} 1. 2 mm continuum and CS spectral line {{study of a}} large sample of 69 massive star forming regions in very early stages of evolution, most of them prior to building up an ultracompact Hii region. The continuum data show a zoo of different morphologies and give detailed information on the spatial distributions, the masses, column densities and average densities of the whole sample. Fitting the radial intensity profiles shows that three parameters are needed to describe the spatial distribution of the sources: constant emission from the center out to a few arcsec radius followed by a first power law intensity distribution which steepens further outside into a second power law distribution. The <b>inner</b> <b>flat</b> region is possibly caused by fragmentation of the large scale cores into smaller sub-sources, whereas the steeper outer power law distributions indicate finite sizes of the cores. Separating the sources into sub-samples suggests that in the earliest stages prior to the onset of massive star formation the intensity radial distributions are rather flat resembling the structure of intensity peaks in more quiescent molecular clouds. Then in the subsequent collapse and accretion phase the intensity distributions become centrally peaked with steep power law indices.

The steady-state temperature distribution in the mold is calculated in three-dimensions, and then used to calibrate and validate a simpler one-dimensional model of mold heat transfer. The results are applied to explain the effect of mold wear on the measured mold temperatures and heat fluxes. Investigation of the mechanical behavior of the solidifying shell has identified the geometry of the funnel has little influence on the thermal behavior of the solidifying shell, but induces a bending effect in the shell that is absent in conventional parallel-face molds. This bending effect is shown to increase the likelihood of crack formation in the “inside curve” region of the funnel, due to increased tensile stress on the solidification front. This mechanical effect can be mitigated by using a shallow and wide funnel with no <b>inner</b> <b>flat</b> region.

The ejecta, with an <b>inner</b> <b>flat</b> and an outer steep power law density distribution, were assumed to freely expand into an ambient medium with a constant density, ∼ 0. 1 H atoms cm − 3 for the case of Vela. At an age of 10 4 yr, the reverse shock front {{is expected to have}} moved back {{to the center of the}} remnant. Ejecta clumps with an initial density contrast χ ∼ 100 relative to their surroundings are found to be rapidly fragmented and decelerated. In order to cause a pronounced protrusion on the blast wave, as observed in the Vela remnant, χ ∼ 1000 may be required. In this case, the clump should be near the inflection point in the ejecta density profile, at an ejecta velocity ∼ 3000 km s − 1. These results apply to moderately large clumps; smaller clumps would require an even larger density contrast. Clumps can create ring structure in the shell of the Vela remnant and we investigate the possibility that RX J 0852 – 4622, an apparent supernova remnant superposed on Vela, is actually part of the Vela shell. Radio observations support this picture, but the possible presence of a compact object argues against it.

40|$|Edge-on spiral galaxies {{often have}} stellar disks with {{relatively}} sharp truncations and warped HI-layers {{in the outer}} parts. Warps appear to start preferentially near the optical boundaries of the disks. Here we make a comparative study of warps and truncations in edge-on galaxies. The García-Ruiz et al. (2002) sample with extensive HI-mapping is complemented with luminosity distributions from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The method to identify truncations has been tested using the sample of edge-on galaxies of van der Kruit & Searle. Results are: (i.) The majority (17 out of 23) of the galaxies show evidence for truncations. (ii.) When an HI-warp is present it starts at 1. 1 truncation radii. (iii.) This supplements the rules for warps formulated by Briggs (1990), if the Holmberg radius is replaced for edge-on systems with the truncation radius. (iv.) The truncation radius and {{the onset of the}} warps coincide radially with features in the rotation curve and the HI surface density. The latter is also true for less inclined systems. (v.) Inner disks are very flat and the onset of the warp just beyond the truncation radius is abrupt and discontinuous. These findings suggest that the <b>inner</b> <b>flat</b> disk and the outer warped disk are distinct components with quite different formation histories, probably involving quite different epochs.
