50|$|During this <b>flange</b> contact, {{the wheel}} {{on the high}} rail is {{experiencing}} the lateral force L, towards {{the outside of the}} curve. As the wheel rotates, the <b>flange</b> tends to climb up the <b>flange</b> angle. It is held down by the vertical load on the wheel V, so that if L/V exceeds the trigonometrical tangent of the <b>flange</b> contact angle, climbing will take place. The wheel <b>flange</b> will climb to the rail head where there is no lateral resistance in rolling movement, and a <b>flange</b> climbing derailment usually takes place. In Diagram 5 the <b>flange</b> contact angle is quite steep, and <b>flange</b> climbing is unlikely. However, if the rail head is side-worn (side-cut) or the <b>flange</b> is worn, as shown in Diagram 6 the contact angle is much flatter and <b>flange</b> climbing is more likely.|$|R

50|$|Back-up {{rings are}} used in Polyethylene (PE) pipe connections, such as HDPE pipes, where they are {{connected}} to steel pipe or pipe fittings. The back-up ring is matched to the steel pipe <b>flange</b> specification and is placed behind the HDPE <b>flange</b> adapter - a end piece on the HDPE pipe that looks much like a steel <b>flange</b> {{at the end of}} the HDPE pipe. As the <b>flange</b> adapter does not have much structural strength, the back-up ring supports and compresses the HDPE <b>flange</b> adapter against the steel <b>flange</b> and creates an effective connection between the two piping materials.|$|R
25|$|The Cable Car has two cars, which {{start from}} {{opposite}} ends of the line and pass in the middle. They are attached to each other by a 30mm diameter cable, supported by 120 rollers, which runs round a pulley {{at the top of the}} hill. A 185kW 550V DC motor at the top of the hill drives the pulley. The Cable Car is a funicular rather than a true cable car: the cars are permanently attached to the cable, which stops and starts as required, while a cable car grips and releases a continuously-moving cable. Wheels on the south side of car 1 and the north side of car 2 have double <b>flanges,</b> while the opposite wheels on each car have no <b>flanges,</b> directing the cars to the correct side of the mid-way passing loop at Talavera.|$|E

40|$|Bolted {{flanged joints}} {{comprise}} an assembly {{of a number}} of important individual components, which are required to perform well together in service. The ideal requirement for a bolted <b>flange</b> joint is a 'zero-leak' condition. However, whilst recommended design procedures for bolted <b>flange</b> joints are available in international codes and standards, leakage problems are still faced by industry. These are common in both normal operating (internal pressure loading) and critical event conditions. The drive is, therefore, to find a <b>flange</b> joint assembly, which provides 'zero-leak condition' and requires little or no maintenance and handling. Considerable investigation in the area of optimised bolted joints has been in progress for the past 10 years comparing traditional gasketed joints and 'compact non-gasketed' joints, using both analytical and experimental approaches. In this present study, two-dimensional non-linear finite element studies have been performed for both gasketed and non-gasketed bolted <b>flange</b> pipe joints. Based on the stress results for the <b>flange</b> and the bolt and the <b>flange</b> rotation/displacement, compact non-gasketed <b>flange</b> joints are shown to be a viable and preferable alternative to the conventional gasketed <b>flange</b> joints. Recommendations are made for a best-fit <b>flange</b> model for static load conditions with 'zero-leak' sealing in a <b>flange</b> joint...|$|R
