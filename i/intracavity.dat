2500|$|The downconversion process really {{occurs in}} the single photon regime: each pump photon that is annihilated inside the cavity {{gives rise to a}} pair of photons in the signal and idler <b>intracavity</b> modes.

2500|$|The {{most common}} types of optical {{cavities}} consist of two facing plane (flat) or spherical mirrors. The simplest {{of these is}} the plane-parallel or Fabry–Pérot cavity, consisting of two opposing flat mirrors. While simple, this arrangement is rarely used in large-scale lasers due to the difficulty of alignment; the mirrors must be aligned parallel within a few seconds of arc, or [...] "walkoff" [...] of the <b>intracavity</b> beam will result in it spilling out of the sides of the cavity. However, this problem is much reduced for very short cavities with a small mirror separation distance (L < 1nbsp&cm). Plane-parallel resonators are therefore commonly used in microchip and microcavity lasers and semiconductor lasers. In these cases, rather than using separate mirrors, a reflective optical coating may be directly applied to the laser medium itself. The plane-parallel resonator is also the basis of the Fabry–Pérot interferometer.|$|E

5000|$|This {{is known}} as the cavity {{linewidth}} equation where [...] is the beam divergence and the term in parenthesis (elevated to -1) is the overall <b>intracavity</b> dispersion.

50|$|Passive {{mode-locking}} {{techniques are}} {{those that do not}} require a signal external to the laser (such as the driving signal of a modulator) to produce pulses. Rather, they use the light in the cavity to cause a change in some <b>intracavity</b> element, which will then itself produce a change in the <b>intracavity</b> light. A commonly used device to achieve this is a saturable absorber.|$|E

50|$|An {{output coupler}} (OC) is the {{component}} of a optical resonator that allows the extraction of {{a portion of the}} light from the laser's <b>intracavity</b> beam. An output coupler most often consists of a partially reflective mirror, allowing a certain portion of the <b>intracavity</b> beam to transmit through. Other methods include the use of almost-totally reflective mirrors {{at each end of the}} cavity, emitting the beam either by focusing it into a small hole drilled in the center of one mirror, or by redirecting through the use of rotating mirrors, prisms, or other optical devices, causing the beam to bypass one of the end mirrors at a given time.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{application}} of this theory was to evaluate the laser linewidth in multiple-prism grating laser oscillators. [...] The total <b>intracavity</b> angular dispersion {{plays an important role}} in the linewidth narrowing of pulsed tunable lasers through the equation ...|$|E
50|$|Another {{issue is}} <b>intracavity</b> laser beam aiming, {{aligning}} and tracking over long distances. Progress in directed energy weapons has improved these capabilities. The {{speed of light}} limits how quickly tracking information can travel between the two cavity ends over long distances.|$|E
50|$|Laser {{linewidth}} from high-power, high-gain pulsed-lasers, in {{the absence}} of <b>intracavity</b> line narrowing optics, can be quite broad {{and in the case of}} powerful broadband dye lasers it can range from a few nm wide to as broad as 10 nm.|$|E
50|$|In {{tunable laser}} {{resonators}} <b>intracavity</b> beam expansion usually illuminates the whole {{width of a}} diffraction grating. Thus beam expansion reduces the beam divergence and enables the emission of very narrow linewidths which is a desired feature for many analytical applications including laser spectroscopy.|$|E
50|$|Greater thrust {{requires}} {{higher power}} lasers. Lasers are often designed to maximize power outside the laser cavity, while PLT calls for maximizing laser power inside the cavity. The necessary laser operation parameters to maximize <b>intracavity</b> power (circulating power) in laser cavities are still poorly understood.|$|E

50|$|In 2014, Bae's group, {{working under}} a NASA program (NIAC, NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts), {{demonstrated}} <b>intracavity</b> power of 154 kW with a 0.6 cm diameter thin disk laser, {{which can be}} translated into a photon thrust of 1.03 mN. In April 2015, the group successfully measured photon thrust up to 1.1 mN with a digital scale. They were able to accelerate, slow and stop a 0.45 kg spacecraft-simulating platform along a 2m frictionless air track in a Class-1,000 cleanroom. In August 2015, under the NASA program the group successfully demonstrated and measured photon thrust up to 3.5 mN {{with the use of}} the newly developed NIST/Scientech/Navy radiation pressure sensor. An <b>intracavity</b> power of the photonic laser thruster over 500 kW was demonstrated with 500 W laser pumping.|$|E
50|$|The p-Ge (p-type germanium) laser is a tunable, solid state, far {{infrared}} laser which {{has existed for}} over 25 years. It operates in crossed electric and magnetic fields at liquid helium temperatures. Wavelength selection {{can be achieved by}} changing the applied electric/magnetic fields or through the introduction of <b>intracavity</b> elements.|$|E
50|$|Methods for {{producing}} mode-locking in a laser may {{be classified as}} either 'active' or 'passive'. Active methods typically involve using an external signal to induce a modulation of the <b>intracavity</b> light. Passive methods do not use an external signal, but rely on placing some element into the laser cavity which causes self-modulation of the light.|$|E
50|$|Some <b>intracavity</b> {{elements}} are usually placed at a beam waist between folded sections.

That is, ...|$|E
50|$|Hänsch {{introduced}} <b>intracavity</b> {{telescopic beam}} expansion to grating tuned laser oscillators thus producing the first narrow-linewidth tunable laser. This {{development has been}} credited with having had a major influence {{in the development of}} further narrow-linewidth multiple-prism grating laser oscillators. In turn, tunable narrow-linewidth organic lasers, and solid-state lasers, using total illumination of the grating, have had a major impact in laser spectroscopy.|$|E
5000|$|VCSELs with {{external}} cavities, known as VECSELs or semiconductor disk lasers. VECSELs are optically pumped with conventional laser diodes. This arrangement allows a larger {{area of the}} device to be pumped and therefore more power can be extracted - as much as 30W. The external cavity also allows <b>intracavity</b> techniques such as frequency doubling, single frequency operation and femtosecond pulse modelocking.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{solid-state}} lasers {{can also}} be tunable using several <b>intracavity</b> techniques which employ etalons, prisms, and gratings, {{or a combination of}} these. [...] Titanium-doped sapphire is widely used for its broad tuning range, 660 to 1080 nanometers. Alexandrite lasers are tunable from 700 to 820 nm, and they yield higher-energy pulses than titanium-sapphire lasers because of the gain medium's longer energy storage time and higher damage threshold.|$|E
50|$|Only certain {{ranges of}} values for R1, R2, and L produce stable {{resonators}} in which periodic refocussing of the <b>intracavity</b> beam is produced. If the cavity is unstable, the beam size will grow without limit, eventually growing {{larger than the}} size of the cavity mirrors and being lost. By using methods such as ray transfer matrix analysis, it is possible to calculate a stability criterion:Values which satisfy the inequality correspond to stable resonators.|$|E

5000|$|Preventing the {{feedback}} of a laser cavity {{by using a}} polarizing prism. This prevents optical amplification by directing light of a certain polarization out of the cavity. Because of this, the gain medium is pumped to a highly excited state. When the medium has become saturated by energy, the Pockels cell is switched, and the <b>intracavity</b> light is allowed to exit. This creates a very fast, high-intensity pulse. Q-switching, chirped pulse amplification, and cavity dumping use this technique.|$|E
5000|$|This {{improved}} {{gain medium}} {{was central to}} the demonstration of the first tunable narrow-linewidth solid-state dye laser oscillators, by Duarte, which were later optimized to deliver pulse emission in the kW regime in nearly diffraction limited beams with single-longitudinal-mode laser linewidths of [...] ≈ 350 MHz (or [...] ≈ 0.0004 nm, at a laser wavelength of 590 nm). [...] These tunable laser oscillators use multiple-prism grating architectures yielding very high <b>intracavity</b> dispersions that can be nicely quantified using the multiple-prism grating equations.|$|E
5000|$|Telescopic beam {{expanders}} include refracting {{and reflective}} telescopes. [...] A refracting telescope commonly used is the Galilean telescope which can {{function as a}} simple beam expander for collimated light. The main advantage of the Galilean design is that it never focuses a collimated beam to a point, so effects associated with high power density such as dielectric breakdown are more avoidable than with focusing designs such as the Keplerian telescope. When used as <b>intracavity</b> beam expanders, in laser resonators, these telescopes provide two-dimensional beam expansion in the 20-50 range.|$|E
50|$|Bae {{and colleagues}} chose a thin disk laser {{and began to}} develop a PLT in 2013. Typically, a thin disk laser with a 0.2 mm disk {{thickness}} can be operated with a 99% output coupler, and provide an <b>intracavity</b> power 100 times larger than extracavity power. A schematic diagram of this design is shown in Figure 6. A thin disk gain medium is coated with HR with a reflectivity of up to 99.999% and attached to a heat sink. The recycling photons between the gain medium and the HR mirror located in the mission platform deliver amplified thrust beaming from the resource platform.|$|E
