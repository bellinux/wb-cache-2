The light bulb contains a chrome top that directs light to areas where it is needed most. The bulb, which lasts 2, 000 hours, provides 40 percent more surface illumination on work and reading surfaces, compared to a standard incandescent bulb. The lightly <b>frosted</b> <b>finish</b> reduces glare, which helps to reduce eyestrain.

50|$|Two {{weeks before}} the event the {{connections}} for several horses announced {{that they would be}} entering the race after bypassing the Preakness Stakes. These included the following participants of the 2015 Kentucky Derby: <b>Frosted,</b> who <b>finished</b> fourth; Materiality, sixth; Keen Ice, seventh; Mubtaahij, eighth; Carpe Diem, tenth; Frammento, eleventh; and War Story, who was sixteenth. When the field was ultimately drawn for the race on June 3, Carpe Diem and War Story were not entered. A total of eight horses were to participate, all but one of whom had run in either the Derby or, as was the case of Tale of Verve, in the Preakness. The exception was Madefromlucky, who won the Peter Pan Stakes and had last faced American Pharoah in the Arkansas Derby. Every horse entered was a descendant, through his sire, of Mr. Prospector.|$|R

The three remained ahead of the pack throughout the race, and broke clear of their rivals entering the straightaway with American Pharoah making a forward move on the outside. The favorite took the lead entering the final furlong and won by a length from Firing Line and Dortmund in 2:03.02, with <b>Frosted</b> <b>finishing</b> strongly in fourth. Espinoza, who won {{the race for the}} third time, said, [...] "I feel like the luckiest Mexican on earth. He has been a special horse since the first time I rode him. He has a lot of talent and is an unbelievable horse. Turning for home I started riding a little bit harder. At the eighth pole I just couldn't put that other horse away, but he got it done." [...] Espinoza's performance attracted some scrutiny as he appeared to have struck the winner 32 times with his whip during the race. In post-race analysis, one of the stewards at Churchill Downs said, [...] "we watched [...] many, many times prior to making it official, and that wasn't anything that got our attention." [...] Baffert said, [...] "He was hitting him on the saddle towel. He doesn't hit that hard." [...] Gary Stevens, rider of second-place Firing Line, commented that he had used his whip heavily as well, stating that the race was [...] "as tough a race as I've been in in 20 years the last eighth of a mile." [...] The Blood-Horse writer Steve Haskin, while condemning whip overuse in general, offered analysis that Espinoza [...] "did a lot of waving with the whip" [...] and may not have actually hit the horse as many times as it seemed. Reflecting on the race, Baffert said that the colt did not bring his [...] "super A-game" [...] to the Derby and that {{it was the first time}} American Pharoah had really been tested by other aggressive horses.|$|R

40|$|Arable weeds {{are usually}} {{perceived}} as harmfull organisms in crops. On the other hand, the weeds provide a stable {{source of food}} for insects and other invertabrates that feed on pollen and nectar. Majority of crops {{are not able to}} provide long-term food component for invertebrates because their flowering is synchronized. Arable weeds flower continously throughout the growing season. There is possible to find many flowering species for the whole year. The main aim {{of the study was to}} determine the onset and duration time of flowering period for selected arable weed species. The observation was conducted at the Demonstration and experimental field of Faculty of Agrobiology, Food and Natural Resources neighbouring areas as well as demonstration plots with rare weed species that do not occur in fields naturally. Inventory of flowering species was performed weakly from 9 th calendar week (after <b>frost</b> period) and <b>finished</b> at 48 th calendar week. There were found and evaluated 160 plant species of which 67 were the rare species from demonstration plots. First flowering weeds were photoperiodically neutral species, mainly from the group of winter annual weeds followed by ephemeral annual weeds. Among others, the late-flowering species were particulary from the group of summer annual weeds, but also some from perennial species. During the first week of observation, 11 flowering species were found. The number gradually increased up to a maximum of 118 flowering species in the 27 th calendar week; then the number of flowering plant species naturally decreased. Newly flowering species were being found until 36 th calendar week. Weed differed significantly in onset of the flowering acording to perenniality, in most cases. Length of flowering period in individual species was in relation to particular families...|$|R
