So we aren't lecturing. It's a hybrid course. We only meet with students three times. [A]ll of their submissions are online. They gather the information and the findings from these different resources [i. e., required texts, readings, websites, student exploration] and then kind of try to analyze and put it together and really: {{what does that mean}} for them and what do they think it means for this particular culture that they happen to be focusing on for that module and then what can we do with it <b>going</b> forward <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> kind of critical thinking process and application process instead of just telling us this is what they believe and then what? and so what? and that's kind of what we're looking for as far as writing performances and general quality of writing... just be able to scholarly and intelligently convey their thoughts and opinions and their findings and synthesize it in a way where they can apply it in the care of the populations they're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be working with...|$|R

60|$|The combatants were {{watching}} {{each other with}} alert eyes; a perfect stillness, a breathless interest reigned. I felt that I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> wary work. But not so. The instant the word was given, the two apparitions sprang forward and began to rain blows down upon each other with such lightning rapidity that I could not quite tell whether I saw the swords or only flashes they made in the air; the rattling din of these blows as they struck steel or paddings was something wonderfully stirring, and they were struck with such terrific force that I could not understand why the opposing sword was not beaten down under the assault. Presently, {{in the midst of}} the sword-flashes, I saw a handful of hair skip into the air as if it had lain loose on the victim's head and a breath of wind had puffed it suddenly away.|$|E

5000|$|However, {{the play}} was not greeted with praise from all reviewers. Ian Shuttleworth in his prompt corner column for Theatre Record took a dislike to Ridley’s use of Lilly’s {{character}} speaking most of the play in a made-up Middle-Eastern type language, stating that “a character spouting vaguely Middle-Eastern gibberish which {{is meant to be}} Arabic prayer is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>seen</b> with <b>some</b> justification as insulting - not because we're living in sensitive times and need to be politically correct or whatever, but simply because it has all the unsubtlety and laziness of those 1970s TV sitcoms where Europeans or Mexicans were inherently funny simply because they sounded different, and any stereotypical different sounds would do.” He, however, wrote, explaining that he understood that the “character has a point inside the play” but stated that the character “has implications beyond the play’s context; and I think it's too easy to give the writer a free pass because of claims that he's being bold or challenging” adding that “often he Ridley doesn't know when to stop.” ...|$|R

60|$|Taking the {{management}} of Peggotty's affairs into my own hands, with no little pride, I proved the will, {{and came to a}} settlement with the Legacy Duty-office, and took her to the Bank, and soon got everything into an orderly train. We varied the legal character of these proceedings by <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> perspiring Wax-work, in Fleet Street (melted, I should hope, these twenty years); and by visiting Miss Linwood's Exhibition, which I remember as a Mausoleum of needlework, favourable to self-examination and repentance; and by inspecting the Tower of London; and going to the top of St. Paul's. All these wonders afforded Peggotty as much pleasure as she was able to enjoy, under existing circumstances: except, I think, St. Paul's, which, from her long attachment to her work-box, became a rival of the picture on the lid, and was, in some particulars, vanquished, she considered, by that work of art.|$|E
60|$|The abbey is demolished; its ruins are {{all that}} is to be seen of its glory: out of the old building, two very {{beautiful}} churches are built, and serve the two parishes, into which the town is divided, and they stand both in one churchyard. Here it was, in the path-way between these two churches, that a tragical and almost unheard-of act of barbarity was committed, which made the place less pleasant for some time than it used to be, when Arundel Coke, Esq., a barrister-at-law, of a very ancient family, attempted, with the assistance of a barbarous assassin, to murder in cold blood, and in the arms of hospitality, Edward Crisp, Esq., his brother-in- law, leading him out from his own house, where he had invited him, his wife and children, to supper; I say, leading him out in the night, on pretence of <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> friend that was known to them both; but in this churchyard, giving a signal to the assassin he had hired, he attacked him with a hedge-bill, and cut him, as one might say, almost in pieces; and when they did not doubt of his being dead, they left him. His head and face was so mangled, that it may be said to be next to a miracle that he was not quite killed: yet so Providence directed for the exemplary punishment of the assassins, that the gentleman recovered to detect them, who (though he outlived the assault) were both executed as they deserved, and Mr. Crisp is yet alive. They were condemned on the statute for defacing and dismembering, called the Coventry Act.|$|E

5000|$|When {{recording}} for {{her first}} album began in 2000, Angela struggled against the pressure to adapt her sound to the pop-princess trend that was so prevalent at the time. More than a hook with catchy rhythms, her songs explored emotions and issues that were missing from the billboard Top 40. She rebelled, determined to keep her vision intact, no matter the consequences. The singer’s self-titled album was finally completed and released in September 2001—into {{the wake of the}} 9/11 terrorist attacks. Angela was only 18 years old at the time. She was devastated. She surmises, “We all began looking at life differently. My perspective changed when I realized that I was never <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> of my friends again.

His message to the public in his weightlifting endeavours was that anything is possible if one is able to put aside the limitations of the mind. Bill Pearl, former Mr. Universe, acted as Master of Ceremonies at many of Chinmoy's strength exhibitions. Introducing one of Chinmoy's weightlifting exhibitions in 1999, Bill Pearl wrote: [...] "Today you are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> amazing feats of strength that I myself - and I have been in the industry for fifty-five years - would not even attempt to perform."

40|$|Using this mantra Ben Shneiderman prophesises {{in many of}} his {{articles}} and conferences what {{the next generation of}} data recovery interfaces will be like : a general vision first, followed by a closer approach and a filter, and finally details about the part of interest. Shneiderman thus synthesises four stages of the process of information search, and to each of these he adds a visual component. The user comes to the system and sees the overall information he can find there, what subjects are contained within, and how it works. Once viewed in a general way, the user zooms in, that is to say, he centres in on one part that is of major interest. In order to refine his search better, he applies a filter, so that the results obtained better match his information needs. To end the process, the user asks for more detail from some of the results in order to determine if it will be of interest. The mantra refers to "animated GUIs and visual data mining tools", and we will emphasise the visual in the rest of this article. The area of information visualization attempts to offer visual representations that communicate information in a speedy and effective way. Diverse techniques have been developed to achieve this objective and to make the process of data recovery a more comprehensible job and on occasions, more interactive. We present the most used of these: use of icons to represent concepts use of colours and textures to highlight or differentiate elements graphics with hierarchical presentations that are easy on the eye maps that present information arranged according to similitude, using grouping techniques zoom effects to show detailed information animation and perspective in three dimensions Visualization when applied to information helps people form a mental image of the information space. If the visualization takes place in an interface whose objective is information rettrieval, the expression used for this type of system is Visual Information Retrieval Interfaces (VIRIs). The four processes named previously are susceptible to being presented through visual components. In fact, in the sections that follow we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> systems of information presentation - mainly projects that have not been commercially implemented - that will serve as examples tshowing these elements of visualization. They have been classified into three groups: overall vision of the collection, visualization of results, and visualization of the attributes of each document. What remains is to tackle the final phase of the process of search and recovery of information, that which links the moment of presentation of results obtained by the system with the query. This deals with the reformulation of the query, which at the present time does not use visualization, for which reason this item will not be dealt with...|$|E
