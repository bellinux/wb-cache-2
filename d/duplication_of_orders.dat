Logic replication, the <b>duplication</b> <b>of</b> logic in <b>order</b> to minimize communication between partitions, can be an effective component of a complete partitioning solution.

40|$|Database {{normalization}} is {{a technique}} for designing relational database tables to minimize <b>duplication</b> <b>of</b> information in <b>order</b> to safeguard the database against certain types of logical or structural problems, namely data anomalies. Therefore database normalization is a central topic in database theory, and its correct understanding is crucial for students. Unfortunately, the subject it is often considered to be dry and purely theoretical and is often not well received by students. A web-based environment for learning normalization of relational database schemata is developed to give students an interactive hands-on experience in database normalization process. It also provides lecturers with an easy way for creating and testing assignments on the subject. The environment is suitable for relational database and design and data management courses.

40|$|Abstract—Most {{distributed}} applications involve {{some form of}} event-based interaction, often implemented using a publish-subscribe (pub-sub) infrastructure. To improve scalability, the acts of matching events against subscriptions and delivery them are performed collaboratively {{by a set of}} brokers connected into an overlay network. Recent research has proposed several approaches to support the self-adaptation of such overlay network to adapt it to changes in application traffic. However these approaches focus on the monitor, analyze, plan parts of the self-adaptation loop, without considering the issues that arise in the execution part. This paper proposes a set of primitives that fills the gap in the execution phase. Compared to existing work, our approach: (i) is transparent w. r. t. the routing policies of the middleware, (ii) preserves existing properties and guarantees of the middleware, such as no <b>duplication</b> <b>of</b> events, causal <b>ordering,</b> and minimal delays for the events delivered during a reconfiguration. We discuss the correctness of our primitives and implement them in a simulated environment to measure their cost in terms of network overhead.

40|$|A {{large number}} of virtual and remote labs {{connected}} to the internet is already available nowadays. However, they usually are isolated and independent systems, unable to cooperate and complement each other. This lack of interconnection and interoperability leads, consequently, to the <b>duplication</b> <b>of</b> efforts in <b>order</b> to develop what could be easily shared and reused. Therefore, the integration of different platforms can speed up the development of virtual labs and downsize the barriers of using complementary systems that would represent an unachievable development task. In this paper one presents a proposal for the implementation of an open system that will be able to integrate different virtual lab platforms and components by interconnecting them and establishing communication mechanisms that will support understanding and agreement between heterogeneous systems. When one tries to interconnect systems developed on geographically distant places, often using different languages and different cultures, obstacles may arise. In this paper we present a proposal for a new system that allows users to do exactly this; to interconnect several virtual and remote labs through the internet, and to perform tests using components of several of these systems even if they are physically separated from each other.

So far, <b>duplications</b> <b>of</b> 22 q 12 or 22 q 13 to 22 qter have been described in 21 patients, of whom 13 had a pure duplication 22 qter.

40|$|Information and {{communication}} technologies (ICT) {{are contributing to}} major {{changes taking place in}} pathology and within health services more generally. In this article, we draw on our research experience for over 7 years investigating the implementation and diffusion <b>of</b> computerized provider <b>order</b> entry (CPOE) systems to articulate some of the key informatics challenges confronting pathology laboratories. The implementation of these systems, with their improved information management and decision support structures, provides the potential for enhancing the role that pathology services play in patient care pathways. Beyond eliminating legibility problems, CPOE systems can also contribute to the efficiency and safety of healthcare, reducing the <b>duplication</b> <b>of</b> test <b>orders</b> and diminishing the risk of misidentification of patient samples and orders. However, despite the enthusiasm for CPOE systems, their diffusion across healthcare settings remains variable and is often beset by implementation problems. Information systems like CPOE may have the ability to integrate work, departments and organizations, but unfortunately, health professionals, departments and organizations do not always want to be integrated in ways that information systems allow. A persistent theme that emerges from the research evidence is that one size does not fit all, and system success or otherwise is reliant on the conditions and circumstances in which they are located. These conditions and circumstances are part of what is negotiated in the complex, messy and challenging area of ICT implementation. The solution {{is not likely to be}} simple and easy, but current evidence suggests that a combination of concerted efforts, better research designs, more sophisticated theories and hypotheses as well as more skilled, multidisciplinary research teams, tackling this area of study will bring substantial benefits, improving the effectiveness of pathology services, and, as a direct corollary, the quality of patient care. 5 page(s...|$|R
