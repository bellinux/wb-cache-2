5|$|As {{the chief}} {{parliamentary}} spokesman for an abandoned policy, Calvert no longer served a useful purpose to the English Royal Court, and by February 1624 his duties had been restricted to placating the Spanish ambassador. The degree of his disfavour was shown {{when he was}} reprimanded for supposedly delaying diplomatic letters. Calvert bowed to the inevitable. On the pretext of ill health, he began negotiations <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> his position, finally resigning the secretariat in February 1625.|$|E

5|$|Hawkins benefited {{greatly from}} the public's {{reaction}} to the dinosaurs, which was so strong it allowed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> sets of small versions of the dinosaur models, priced at £30 for educational use. But {{the building of the}} models was costly (having cost around £13,729) and in 1855, the Crystal Palace Company cut Hawkins's funding. Several planned models were never made, while those half finished were scrapped, despite protest from sources including the Sunday newspaper, The Observer.|$|E
5|$|Initially sold {{at auction}} for $1.62M in 2008, the 'Jumbo Wagner' was {{featured}} by Goldin Auctions in their 2013 Winter Auction, which closed on April 5, 2013.

The card ultimately sold for $2,105,770.50, including the buyer's premium, a record price for a baseball card in a public auction.|$|E

5|$|A deal <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> Constitution Center {{was agreed}} to in December 2012. MetLife and an {{unidentified}} investor (represented by Clarion Partners LLC) each purchased a 50 percent {{interest in the}} building. The sale price was $734 million, or $524 per square foot (0.093 square meters). The sale price was the most expensive in D.C. history for a single building. (It was not the most paid per square foot, however. That record went to two-building Market Square at 701 and 801 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, which sold in 2011 to Wells Real Estate Investment Trust for $905 per square foot.) When the deal closed in February 2013, David Nassif Associates announces it would wind down its operations and liquidate its remaining obligations.|$|E
5|$|Bakaara Market {{was created}} in late 1972 by the Barre administration. It served as an open market <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> goods and services, {{including}} produce and clothing. After {{the start of the}} civil war, the market was controlled by various militant groups, who used it as a base for their operations. Following Mogadishu's pacification in 2011, renovations resumed at the market. Shops were rehabilitated, selling everything from fruit and garments to building materials. As {{in the rest of the}} city, Barkaara Market's real estate values have also risen considerably. , the local Tabaarak firm was renting out a newly constructed warehouse at the market for $2,000 per month.|$|E
5|$|Following {{an effort}} from the International Maple Syrup Institute (IMSI) and many maple syrup {{producer}} associations, both Canada and the United States have altered their laws regarding {{the classification of}} maple syrup to be uniform. Whereas in the past each state or province had their own laws on the classification of maple syrup, now those laws define a unified grading system. This had been {{a work in progress}} for several years, and most of the finalization of the new grading system was made in 2014. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency announced in the Canada Gazette on 28 June 2014 that rules <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> maple syrup would be amended to include new descriptors, {{at the request of the}} IMSI.|$|E

5|$|In June 2015, Pakistani {{media reports}} {{suggested}} that export orders {{have also been}} confirmed and signed with the Sri Lanka Air Force, according to Pakistan-based 92 News while some other sources claim that Myanmar is the first buyer of Pakistani JF-17 Thunder jets. The article {{goes on to say}} that deliveries are likely to begin in 2017. According to the report, the order will be for around 18–24 aircraft, potentially confirming claims made at the 51st Paris Air Show that the first contract <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> the JF-17 had been signed with the Sri Lanka Air Force.|$|E
5|$|In late 2014, Russia {{offered the}} Su-35 to Indonesia {{as the country}} sought to replace its ageing F-5E Tiger II fleet. The {{following}} year, the Indonesian Ministry of Defence selected the Su-35 ahead of the Eurofighter Typhoon, Dassault Rafale, F-16, and Saab JAS 39 Gripen; the Defence Ministry cited the Indonesian Air Force's familiarity with the Su-27SK and Su-30MK2 {{as the reason for}} the aircraft's selection. There were some initial reports that the country was to order a squadron of up to sixteen aircraft, but the number was later reduced to some ten aircraft. By mid-2017, negotiations between the two parties <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> the Su-35 had reached an advanced stage, with the Indonesian government later agreed in principle to conduct a barter trade of agricultural products for a reported eleven aircraft.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Argentina {{approached}} the UK {{with a proposal}} to buy a number of Vulcans. An application, made in September 1981, requested the 'early availability' of a 'suitable aircraft'. With some reluctance, ministers approved the export of a single aircraft but emphasised that clearance had not been given <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> a larger number. A letter from the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office to the Ministry of Defence in January 1982 stated that little prospect was seen of this happening without ascertaining the Argentine interest and whether such interest was genuine: 'On the face of it, a strike aircraft would be entirely suitable for {{an attack on the}} Falklands.' Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands less than three months later.|$|E

5|$|Nigel Kneale was a BBC {{employee}} at the time, {{which meant that}} his scripts were owned entirely by the BBC and he received no extra payment <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> the film rights. This became {{a matter of some}} resentment on Kneale's part, and when his BBC contract came up for renewal he demanded and secured control over any future film rights for his work. Despite this Kneale remained bitter over the affair until the BBC made an ex-gratia payment of £3,000 to him in 1967, in recognition of his creation of Quatermass.|$|E
5|$|Special permits {{exist to}} allow <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> {{alcoholic}} beverages at golf courses, government-owned facilities, and at social events run by non-profit organizations (for example, church carnivals). A restaurant in New Jersey without a liquor license can sell wine from a New Jersey winery by becoming an offsite retail sales outlet of the winery. Since the early 1990s, {{there have been}} a handful of unsuccessful proposals to create a separate restaurant license allowing eating establishments to sell beer and wine. Such proposals have been strongly opposed by current retail license holders who believe that it would decrease their income, and thus the value of their liquor license.|$|E
5|$|The Vajpayee {{government}} {{ordered the}} Indian {{armed forces to}} expel the Pakistani soldiers occupying Kashmir territory, later known as the Kargil War. Although the government was later criticised for the intelligence failures that did not detect Pakistani presence, it was successful in ousting them from the previously Indian-controlled territory. The Vajpayee administration also offered political support to the US War on Terror, {{in the hope of}} better addressing India's issues with terrorism and insurgency in Kashmir. This led to closer defence ties with the US, including negotiations <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> weapons.|$|E

5|$|The few {{courts that}} have {{considered}} the antitrust implications of concurrent use registration have determined {{that it does not}} raise any violation of antitrust laws. Although it is considered a violation of such laws for companies to agree to divide up geographic territories <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> goods, concurrent use agreements dividing up trademark territories are specifically provided for by Congress. Furthermore, even with such an agreement in place, a company can still sell competing products in the trademark territory of another company, so long as the intruding party sells that product under a different mark.|$|E
5|$|The first {{extension}} of Smithfield's meat market {{took place between}} 1873 and 1876 {{with the construction of}} the Poultry Market immediately west of the Central Market. A rotunda was built at the centre of the old Market Field (now West Smithfield), comprising gardens, a fountain and a ramped carriageway to the station beneath the market building. Further buildings were subsequently added to the market. The General Market, built between 1879 and 1883, was intended to replace the old Farringdon Market located nearby and established <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> fruit and vegetables when the earlier Fleet Market was cleared to enable the laying out of Farringdon Street between 1826–1830.|$|E
5|$|Until the 20th century, the States {{relied on}} {{indirect}} taxation {{to finance the}} administration of Jersey. The levying of impôts (duties) {{different from those of}} the United Kingdom was granted by Charles II and remained in the hands of the Assembly of Governor, Bailiff and Jurats until 1921 when that body's tax raising powers were transferred to the Assembly of the States, leaving the Assembly of Governor, Bailiff and Jurats to serve simply as licensing bench <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> alcohol (this fiscal reform also stripped the Lieutenant-Governor of most of his effective remaining administrative functions). The Income Tax Law of 1928 introducing income tax was the first law drafted entirely in English.
