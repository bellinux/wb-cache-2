5|$|All of {{the lower}} {{respiratory}} tract including the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles is lined with respiratory epithelium. This is a ciliated epithelium interspersed with <b>goblet</b> <b>cells</b> which produce mucus, and club cells with actions similar to macrophages. Incomplete rings of cartilage in the trachea and smaller plates of cartilage in the bronchi, keep these airways open. Bronchioles are too narrow to support cartilage and their walls are of smooth muscle, and this is largely absent in the narrower respiratory bronchioles which are mainly just of epithelium. The respiratory tract ends in lobules. Each lobule consists of a respiratory bronchiole, which branches into alveolar ducts and alveolar sacs, which in turn divide into alveoli.|$|E
5|$|The lungs possess several {{characteristics}} which {{protect against}} infection. The lung tract is lined by epithelia with hair-like projections called cilia that beat rhythmically and carry mucus. This mucociliary clearance {{is an important}} defence system against air-borne infection. The dust particles and bacteria in the inhaled air {{are caught in the}} mucosal surface of respiratory passages and are moved up towards the pharynx by the rhythmic upward beating action of the cilia. The lining of the lung also secretes immunoglobulin A which protects against respiratory infections; <b>goblet</b> <b>cells</b> secrete mucus which also contains several antimicrobial compounds such as defensins, antiproteases, and antioxidates. In addition, the lining of the lung also contains macrophages, immune cells which engulf and destroy debris and microbes that enter the lung in a process known as phagocytosis; and dendritic cells which present antigens to activate components of the adaptive immune system such as T-cells and B-cells.|$|E
25|$|<b>Goblet</b> <b>cells</b> are {{typically}} {{found in the}} respiratory, reproductive and gastrointestinal tracts and are surrounded by stratified squamous cells. Differentiation of epithelial cells into <b>goblet</b> <b>cells</b> {{plays a key role}} in the excessive mucus production seen in many diseases, such as asthma and cancer.|$|E
40|$|<b>Goblet</b> <b>cell</b> carcinoids {{are rare}} tumors of {{appendix}} having a mixed phenotype, with partial neuroendocrine differentiation and intestinal type <b>goblet</b> <b>cell</b> morphology. The reported incidence of this tumor is still limited. Till now, only two cases of metastatic <b>goblet</b> <b>cell</b> appendiceal carcinoid on effusion cytology {{have been reported}} in literature. We describe the clinico-pathological details and lay stress on fluid cytology of metastatic <b>goblet</b> <b>cell</b> carcinoid to ascitic fluid...|$|R
40|$|<b>Goblet</b> <b>cell</b> carcinoid is an {{uncommon}} primary tumor of the vermiform appendix, characterized by dual endocrine and glandular differentiation. Whether <b>goblet</b> <b>cell</b> carcinoid represents a morphological variant of appendiceal classical carcinoid or a mucin-producing adenocarcinoma {{is a matter}} of conjecture. Rare cases of <b>goblet</b> <b>cell</b> carcinoid with other concomitant appendiceal epithelial neoplasms have been documented. In this report, we describe a rare case of combined appendiceal <b>goblet</b> <b>cell</b> carcinoid and mucinous cystadenoma, and discuss the possible histopathogenesis of this combination...|$|R
40|$|A {{long-term}} inhalation {{study and}} an instillation study {{were conducted to}} examine the pulmonary toxicity and carcinogenicity of diesel soot and diesel exhaust in female Wistar rats. In these studies, <b>goblet</b> <b>cell</b> metaplasia occured in the peripheral lung tissue. <b>Goblet</b> <b>cell</b> metaplasias {{have been reported in}} pulmonary airways of humans and hamsters. A short description of <b>goblet</b> <b>cell</b> metaplasia in the peripheral lung tissue of rats was given by Boorman and Eustis (1990). <b>Goblet</b> <b>cell</b> metaplasia is now included among the proliferative lesions described in the International Classification of Rodent Tumors published by WHO/IARC (1992) ...|$|R

25|$|Mucins are {{continuously}} {{made and}} secreted by <b>goblet</b> <b>cells</b> {{in order to}} repair and replace the existing mucus layer. Mucins are stored in granules inside the <b>goblet</b> <b>cells</b> before being released to the lumen of the organ. Mucin secretion in the airway may occur via regulated secretion. Secretion may be stimulated by irritants such as dust and smoke, especially in the airway. Other stimuli are microbes such as viruses and bacteria.|$|E
25|$|There {{are other}} cells that secrete mucus (such as the foveolar {{cells of the}} stomach) but these are {{distinguished}} histologically from <b>goblet</b> <b>cells.</b>|$|E
40|$|AIMS: <b>Goblet</b> <b>cell</b> carcinoid is {{a poorly}} {{understood}} tumour of the appendix. The {{aim of this}} study was to determine whether it should be regarded as a separate entity or as a variant of classical carcinoid. METHODS AND RESULTS: The immunohistochemical expression pattern of 21 markers and the mutation status of KRas codon 12 were determined in 16 <b>goblet</b> <b>cell</b> carcinoids and compared with 14 classical carcinoids, 19 colonic adenocarcinomas and 10 appendiceal mucinous cystadeno (carcino) mas. The results were subjected to a stepwise linear discriminant analysis. <b>Goblet</b> <b>cell</b> carcinoids were significantly different from the control groups. The most important markers for discriminating between the groups were CEA (classical carcinoid versus all others), KRas mutation (present in all mucinous cystadeno (carcino) mas), beta-catenin (<b>goblet</b> <b>cell</b> carcinoid versus left sided colonic adenocarcinoma) and chromogranin (<b>goblet</b> <b>cell</b> carcinoid versus right sided colonic adenocarcinoma). Expression of Math 1 and HD 5 was similar in <b>goblet</b> <b>cell</b> carcinoid and colonic adenocarcinoma but absent in classical carcinoid. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that <b>goblet</b> <b>cell</b> carcinoids should be regarded as a separate entity. The formerly used term 'crypt cell carcinoma' may be more appropriate because it reflects the more aggressive clinical behaviour of these tumours as well as their greater similarity to adenocarcinomas rather than to carcinoid...|$|R
40|$|<b>Goblet</b> <b>cell</b> carcinoid tumours {{are often}} {{considered}} {{a subset of}} appendiceal neuroendocrine tumours which behave more aggressively. They usually metastasize through transcoelomic/peritoneal invasion and common sites include the ovaries, peritoneum, and liver. Metastases may have <b>goblet</b> <b>cell</b> carcinoid, signet ring cell carcinoma or classic carcinoid histology. We report the first case {{in the literature of}} a patient with a <b>goblet</b> <b>cell</b> carcinoid with lung metastasis, which was associated with unfavourable outcome...|$|R
40|$|Neuroendocrine {{tumors are}} rare tumors {{primarily}} {{located in the}} gastrointestinal tract. <b>Goblet</b> <b>cell</b> carcinoid is a rare subgroup of neuroendocrine tumors located in the appendix. Neurofibromatosis type 1 is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a mutation in the NF 1 gene. Patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 have an increased incidence of typical neuroendocrine tumors, but it is unknown {{if this is the}} case with <b>goblet</b> <b>cell</b> carcinoids. We describe a patient with both neurofibromatosis type 1 and <b>goblet</b> <b>cell</b> carcinoid, that according to literature would occur in 0. 00017 per million per year. This may suggest a previously unknown association between neurofibromatosis type 1 and <b>goblet</b> <b>cell</b> carcinoids...|$|R
25|$|<b>Goblet</b> <b>cells</b> {{are found}} {{scattered}} among the epithelial lining of organs, {{such as the}} intestinal and respiratory tracts. They are found inside the trachea, bronchi, and larger bronchioles in the respiratory tract, small intestines, the large intestine, and conjunctiva in the upper eyelid. In the conjunctiva <b>goblet</b> <b>cells</b> {{are a source of}} mucin in tears and they also secrete different types of mucins onto the ocular surface. In the lacrimal glands, mucus is synthesized by acinar cells instead.|$|E
25|$|The main role of <b>goblet</b> <b>cells</b> is to secrete mucus {{in order}} to protect the mucous {{membranes}} where they are found. <b>Goblet</b> <b>cells</b> accomplish this by secreting mucins, large glycoproteins formed mostly by carbohydrates. The gel-like properties of mucins are given by its glycans (bound carbohydrates) attracting relatively large quantities of water. On the inner surface of the human intestine, it forms a 200 µm thick layer (less in other animals) that lubricates and protects the wall of the organ.|$|E
25|$|In mucicarmine stains, {{deep red}} mucin is found within goblet cell bodies. <b>Goblet</b> <b>cells</b> {{can be seen}} in the {{examples}} below as the larger, more pale cells.|$|E
40|$|SummaryThe {{balance and}} {{distribution}} of epithelial cell types is required to maintain tissue homeostasis. A hallmark of airway diseases is epithelial remodeling, leading to increased <b>goblet</b> <b>cell</b> numbers and an overproduction of mucus. In the conducting airway, basal cells act as progenitors for both secretory and ciliated cells. To identify mechanisms regulating basal cell fate, we developed a screenable 3 D culture system of airway epithelial morphogenesis. We performed a high-throughput screen using a collection of secreted proteins and identified inflammatory cytokines that specifically biased basal cell differentiation toward a <b>goblet</b> <b>cell</b> fate, culminating in enhanced mucus production. We also demonstrate a specific requirement for Notch 2 in cytokine-induced <b>goblet</b> <b>cell</b> metaplasia in vitro and in vivo. We conclude that inhibition of Notch 2 prevents <b>goblet</b> <b>cell</b> metaplasia induced by {{a broad range of}} stimuli and propose Notch 2 neutralization as a therapeutic strategy for preventing <b>goblet</b> <b>cell</b> metaplasia in airway diseases...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To know {{influence}} of artificial tear related with conjunctival <b>goblet</b> <b>cell</b> density in glaucoma patient with latanoprost therapy. Method: Pre-posttest design with expanded randomized study. This study was performed at Eye Policlinic Sanglah Public Hospital Denpasar and Bali Mandara Hospital from October until December 2015. Forty eyes were taken for impression cytology specimen to search <b>goblet</b> <b>cell</b> density before and 30 days after therapy. Mean difference of <b>goblet</b> <b>cell</b> changes {{before and after}} therapy between case and control analyzed with independent t-test. Results: There were enhancements of conjunctival <b>goblet</b> <b>cell</b> mean density on group with artificial tear before and after therapy 83 + 97 cell/mm 2 to 92 + 88 cell/mm 2. There was reduction of conjunctival <b>goblet</b> <b>cell</b> mean density of group without artificial tear from 144 + 169 cell/mm 2 to 78 + 103 cell/mm 2. Mean difference between both group in this study differ not significant statistically (p= 0, 178). However, mean difference of conjunctival <b>goblet</b> <b>cell</b> density before and after therapy between both groups differ - 75 + 54 cell/mm 2.

40|$|The {{number of}} Indonesian smokers in 2013 has reached 36. 3 % and {{continues}} to increase each year. This will directly affect the increase in passive smokers in Indonesia. Harmful free radicals from cigarette smoke inhaled can lead to irritation of the bronchial airways.

25|$|Oral {{tolerance}} is {{the process}} by which the immune system is prevented from responding to antigen derived from food products, as peptides from food may pass into the bloodstream via the gut, which would in theory lead to an immune response. A paper published in Nature in 2012 has shed some light on the process and implicated <b>goblet</b> <b>cells</b> as having a role in the process. It was known that CD103-expressing dendritic cells of the lamina propria had a role to play in the induction of oral tolerance (potentially by inducing the differentiation of regulatory T cells), and this paper suggests that the <b>goblet</b> <b>cells</b> act to preferentially deliver antigen to these CD103+ dendritic cells.|$|E
25|$|<b>Goblet</b> <b>cells</b> {{are simple}} {{columnar}} epithelial cells, having {{a height of}} four times that of their width. The cytoplasm of <b>goblet</b> <b>cells</b> tends to be displaced toward the basal end of the cell body by the large mucin granules, which accumulate near the apical surface of the cell along the Golgi apparatus, which lies between the granules and the nucleus. This gives the basal part of the cell a basophilic staining because of nucleic acids within the nucleus and rough endoplasmic reticulum staining with hematoxylin. Mucin within the granules stains pale in routine histology sections, primarily because these carbohydrate-rich proteins are washed out {{in the preparation of}} microscopy samples. However, they stain easily with the PAS staining method, which colours them magenta.|$|E
25|$|The {{excessive}} mucus production seen in allergic asthma {{patients is}} due to goblet cell metaplasia, the differentiation of airway epithelial cells into mucin producing <b>goblet</b> <b>cells.</b> These cells produce the thick mucins MUC5AC and MUC5B, which clog the airway, leading to the airflow obstruction characteristic of asthma.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} both {{isoprenaline}} (IPN) and pilocarpine (PCP) on mitotic activity and <b>goblet</b> <b>cell</b> number {{has been studied}} at 5 levels of the bronchial tree in male and female animals. While both drugs increased mitotic index and <b>goblet</b> <b>cell</b> number at most of the airway levels studied, differences in their effect were detected. After both drugs, nuclei in division were more often superficial within the epithelium than basal but IPN caused a greater increase in mitotic index than PCP. IPN increased <b>goblet</b> <b>cell</b> number at all levels, PCP only in the trachea and larger intrapulmonary airways. The types of <b>goblet</b> <b>cell</b> increased by IPN were particularly those containing acid glycoprotein, whereas PCP increased all types of <b>goblet</b> <b>cell,</b> that is, both those containing neutral and acid glycoprotein. After the drugs, the concentration of cells per unit length of airway epithelium was higher than normal. This is the first study demonstrating {{the effect of these}} two drugs on both <b>goblet</b> <b>cell</b> number and cell division. While the two drugs differ in their pharmacological action, the result of their stimulation of airway epithelium is similar. The way in which each effect is produced is discussed...|$|R

25|$|In the {{digestive}} system, the anterior {{region of the}} foregut has been modified to form a pharyngial sucking pump as they need it for the food they eat, which {{are for the most}} part liquids.

Ancestors of lepidopteran species, stemming from Hymenoptera, had midgut ceca, although this is lost in current butterflies and moths. Instead, all {{the digestive}} enzymes other than initial digestion, are immobilized at the surface of the midgut cells. In larvae, long-necked and stalked <b>goblet</b> <b>cells</b> are found in the anterior and posterior midgut regions, respectively.

40|$|Type 2 immune {{responses}} are essential in protection against intestinal helminth infections. In {{this study we}} show that IL- 22, a cytokine important in defence against bacterial infections in the intestinal tract, is also a critical mediator of anti-helminth immunity. After infection with Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, a rodent hookworm, IL- 22 -deficient mice showed impaired worm expulsion despite normal levels of type 2 cytokine production. The impaired worm expulsion correlated with reduced <b>goblet</b> <b>cell</b> hyperplasia and reduced expression of <b>goblet</b> <b>cell</b> markers.

25|$|Goblet cell carcinoids are a {{class of}} rare tumors that form {{as a result of}} an {{excessive}} proliferation of both goblet and neuroendocrine cells. The majority of these tumors arise in the appendix and may present symptoms similar to the much more common acute appendicitis.

PRESENTATION OF CASEWe report a case of <b>goblet</b> <b>cell</b> carcinoid in our institute who presented with acute abdominal symptoms simulating acute appendicitis. DISCUSSIONGoblet cell carcinoid is a rare neoplasm with distinct histological and clinical features. The diagnosis is essentially made on histological grounds. Still the exact biological behavior of this tumor is uncertain. CONCLUSIONConsidering the difficulty of clinical suspicion of this tumor, presenting as appendicitis and incidentally found during appendectomies, we review the <b>goblet</b> <b>cell</b> carcinoid of the appendix using an illustrative case report...|$|R
40|$|Carcinoid {{tumors are}} rare and slow-growing {{malignancies}} which occur most {{frequently in the}} appendix as its primary malignancy. <b>Goblet</b> <b>cell</b> carcinoid belongs to a subgroup of carcinoids and occurs in exclusively the appendix. <b>Goblet</b> <b>cell</b> carcinoid of the appendix is usually discovered incidentally after appendectomy.

40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effect of three months of soft contact lens wear on conjunctival <b>goblet</b> <b>cell</b> density and epithelial cell morphology. Methods: This was a longitudinal clinical trial. Conjunctival impression cytology was performed on the superior palpebral conjunctiva in fifty-four eyes of twenty-seven neophyte contact lens wearers before and after three months of contact lens wear. <b>Goblet</b> <b>cell</b> density was determined by optical microscopy and epithelial cell morphology was classified according to the Tseng classification. Changes in <b>goblet</b> <b>cell</b> density as well as epithelial cell grading were determined. The effects of lens material and wearing modality on cytological changes were also investigated. Results: <b>Goblet</b> <b>cell</b> density reduced significantly by 85 ± 151 cells/mm 2 (p< 0. 001) after three months of contact lens wear. Reduction in <b>goblet</b> <b>cell</b> density was associated with lensmaterials; it was higher in conventional hydrogel lenses in comparison to silicone-hydrogel lenses (p = 0. 008). The highest reduction in <b>goblet</b> <b>cell</b> density was found with Nelfilcon A lens wear (p = 0. 002) and the lowest with Comfilcon A lens wear (p = 0. 414). There was no statistically significant difference in grading of epithelial metaplasia before and after three months of contact lens wear (p = 0. 075). Age was not correlated with the reduction in <b>goblet</b> <b>cell</b> density (r = - 0. 196, p = 0. 160) but it was associated with the change in epithelial cell morphology (p = 0. 036). Conclusion: Three months of soft contact lens wear statistically significantly reduced <b>goblet</b> <b>cell</b> density; however, no significant changes were found in the grading of epithelial metaplasia. Contact lenses with lower oxygen permeability, higher Young modulus and higher thickness highly affected the conjunctival cytology. A preliminary report of this study was presented in American Academy of Optometry Meeting, Denver 2014. The authors would like to thank Alcon Vision C are and CooperVision for providing contact lenses used in this study.
