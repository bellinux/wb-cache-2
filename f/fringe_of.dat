Rural cemeteries are burial grounds typically located on the <b>fringe</b> <b>of</b> a city that offer a natural setting for interment of the dead. The development of rural cemeteries followed closely with the English garden movement of the early 19thcentury.|$|E
5|$|A {{slightly}} broader definition {{used by the}} Office for National Statistics (ONS) includes developed areas adjoining Bristol {{but outside}} the city-council boundary, such as Whitchurch village, Filton, Patchway and Bradley Stoke, but excludes undeveloped areas within that boundary. The ONS has defined a Bristol Urban Area, which includes Kingswood, Mangotsfield, Stoke Gifford, Winterbourne, Frampton Cotterell, Almondsbury and Easton in Gordano. The North <b>Fringe</b> <b>of</b> Bristol, a developed area in South Gloucestershire between the Bristol city boundary and the M4 and M5 motorways, was so named {{as part of a}} 1987 plan prepared by the Northavon District Council.|$|E

5|$|By 1954, NY12 and NY28 were shifted westward onto a new bypass {{around the}} village of Remsen. NY28B was {{extended}} southward along NY12 and NY28's former alignment on Main Street and westward on Steuben Street to meet the new highway. The NY28B designation was eliminated in the mid-1960s and replaced with NY920V, an unsigned reference route. Around the same time, NY287 was realigned onto the bypass that now carries NY365 around the northern <b>fringe</b> <b>of</b> {{the village of}} Prospect, truncating NY920V to its current length.|$|E

High technology companies such as IBM, Hewlett Packard, Toshiba, and Orange, along with creative and media enterprises become significant local employers as traditional manufacturing industries declined.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1920s, NY39 was {{assigned}} to an alignment extending from Poughkeepsie to Patterson via East Fishkill, Stormville and Poughquag.

NY216 followed modern NY52 north of Ludingtonville and Ludingtonville Road south of the hamlet.|$|E

5|$|Most of NY37B west of Massena {{ran through}} a low-lying area along the St. Lawrence River. In 1958, {{this area was}} {{permanently}} indundated {{as part of the}} St. Lawrence Seaway's construction. As a result, NY37B was rerouted to follow a new roadway along the <b>fringe</b> <b>of</b> Lake St. Lawrence to meet NY37 in Louisville Corner. A connector between NY37 and NY37B in Louisville was designated as NY131 by 1960. The alignments of NY37B and NY131 west of Massena were swapped , placing NY37B on its modern alignment.|$|E

5|$|Windy Nook Primary is {{the only}} school in the village. Some {{children}} of primary school age attend Colegate Community Primary School, located on the <b>fringe</b> <b>of</b> Windy Nook at Colegate West in neighbouring Leam Lane. This too is a satisfactory school which suffers from inconsistent attainment among pupils. The nearest Roman Catholic school is St Augustine's Primary; a good school at Leam Lane Estate. Secondary school provision is at Thomas Hepburn Community Academy on Swards Road in Felling. This is a satisfactory but improving school where the number of pupils entitled to free school meals {{is more than twice}} the national average.|$|E
5|$|A two-laned Ninth Line curves {{northeast}} after {{crossing and}} being crossed by two separate railway tracks (the Canadian Pacific (CP) Havelock Subdivision and the Canadian National Halton subdivision) and becomes Donald Cousens Parkway, expanding to four lanes and travelling {{along the eastern}} <b>fringe</b> <b>of</b> the community of Box Grove, alongside which {{it was built in}} the mid-2000s. On the west side is a new residential subdivision, while on the east side beyond the CP Havelock subdivision, which the road parallels, is the completely undeveloped Bob Hunter Memorial Park. After passing Box Grove Bypass, where for some time the route ended, the road also becomes known as Box Grove Collector Road (BGCR). The route intersects 14th Avenue (York Regional Road71) and continues as before, eventually curving north and meeting Copper Creek Drive while departing from the railway tracks and park. It passes a supercenter before an interchange with Highway407, where it crosses over the toll route.|$|E
