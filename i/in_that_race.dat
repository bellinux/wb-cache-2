In October, Criquette Head-Maarek won the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe with Treve, the only woman trainer to win the Arc. Then, a few days after Ritvo's horse won the Breeders' Cup Classic, the Melbourne Cup was won by Fiorente, a horse trained by Australian trainer Gai Waterhouse, who was only the second woman to train a winner <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>race.</b>|$|E

5000|$|While {{the ideal}} <b>that</b> <b>race</b> should not [...] "matter", critics say, is {{certainly}} not a bad thing, the problem lies <b>in</b> asserting <b>that</b> <b>race</b> {{should not be taken}} into consideration even when trying to address inequality or remedy past wrongs.|$|R

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>that</b> <b>race</b> at Brands Hatch, Pryce took an unfancied Royale RP11 {{to first}} place in the Formula Three support race for the 1972 Formula One Race of Champions against many {{established}} Formula Three drivers such as Roger Williamson, Jochen Mass and James Hunt. So large was Pryce's advantage {{at the end of the}} race, many of the other teams voiced an opinion that Pryce's car had run the race underweight; it turned out that the circuit's weighbridge certificate had expired and everyone's cars had been underweight. Pryce retired from the leading group in the following two rounds at Oulton Park and Zandvoort, and then during practice for the support race of the 1972 Monaco Grand Prix his car came to a stop at Casino Square after a wire had come loose. He had exited his car to correct the problem when Peter Lamplough lost control of his car and struck the Royale RP11. Pryce was knocked into a shop window and broke a leg.|$|E

Just inside the sixteenth pole, he edged away and beat Amazombie under jockey Mike Smith by a length. Gantry was another five and a half lengths back in the third. The time was 1:21 on a fast track.|$|E
5|$|In women's {{cross-country}} skiing, Larisa Lazutina of Russia originally {{won gold}} in the 30km race, but tested positive for darbepoetin and was immediately stripped of her medal, so Gabriella Paruzzi of Italy was awarded the gold, Italian Stefania Belmondo received the silver and Norwegian Bente Skari the bronze. Lazutina won two more medals, and was allowed to keep them until 2003 when she was stripped of them by the Court of Arbitration for sport. She also lost a silver medal in the 15km race so Kateřina Neumannová of the Czech Republic and Yuliya Chepalova of Russia were upgraded to silver and bronze. In the 10km pursuit, she was stripped of a silver, so Beckie Scott of Canada was awarded the silver and Kateřina Neumannová of the Czech Republic the bronze. The gold <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>race</b> was won by Olga Danilova of Russia but she also tested positive for darbepoetin and in 2004, Scott was upgraded to gold, Neumannova to silver and Viola Bauer of Germany to bronze. Danilova won a silver in the 10km race, so Julija Tchepalova of Russia was given silver and Stefania Belmondo of Italy the bronze.|$|E

5|$|Lynch {{competed in}} road races and time trials, and {{off-road}} in cross country, in several world championships. She was not {{selected for the}} New Zealand road cycling team for the 1992 Olympics. She believed that omitting her was a mistake and intended to prove it by doing well at that year's Tour de France Féminin. She placed sixth <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>race</b> and demonstrated her good form. In 1992, she entered the UCI Mountain Bike World Championships in the veteran category and won bronze in both the cross country and the downhill events. When it was announced in 1994 that mountain biking was to become an Olympic discipline, Lynch's focus turned to being picked for the New Zealand team. For that reason, she swapped from the veteran class to elite at the world championships. She became New Zealand's first representative in an Olympic mountain biking event at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia. Aged 39, she was the oldest competitor in the event, but managed to achieve eighth place, leaving two previous world champions behind her. She retired from serious competition after the Olympics, {{with the exception of}} the first UCI World Cup in April 1997 that was held in New Zealand. Until her mid-40s, she competed at the top level in adventure racing. During her domestic career, Lynch won many national titles, and was a serial winner at premium events such as the Karapoti Classic and the Coast to Coast.|$|E
