Modal equivalent stiffness ratios and modal <b>electromechanical</b> <b>coupling</b> <b>coefficients</b> are essential for estimating the performance and determining an optimum design of active vibration control and passive vibration suppression systems that use piezoelectric elements. Accurate determination of these modal parameters is also useful for other systems including piezoelectric sensors and energy generators.

The formulations in this paper demonstrate the necessity of experimental measurements and the accuracy enhancements that the theoretical estimations can provide. Conventional methods for obtaining the modal equivalent stiffness ratios are sensitive to measurement errors, which result in the loss of accuracy, rendering these methods unreliable for many practical applications. The proposed methods use an inductor instead of an open circuit to address the abovementioned issue and, thereby, provide significant improvement in the accuracy. Because the loss factors of the experimental apparatus tend to compromise the accuracy of the proposed methods, a method using a negative resistor is proposed, theoretically analyzed, and confirmed to eliminate some of the errors introduced by loss factors.
