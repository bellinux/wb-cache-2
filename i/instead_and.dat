Molecular diagnostics tests such as microarray comparative genomic hybridisation test a sample of DNA <b>instead,</b> <b>and</b> because of cell-free DNA in plasma, could be less invasive, but as of 2013 it is still an adjunct to the conventional tests.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} great {{distance}} from the Earth, all stars except the Sun appear to the unaided eye as shining points {{in the night sky}} that twinkle because of the effect of the Earth's atmosphere.

5|$|In Quenya, {{there are}} many {{similarities}} in form between prepositions and adverbs since the grammatical case already determines the relation of verb and object. Many Quenya prepositions have adverb-like uses with no complement. In Common Eldarin, these prepositions were postpositions <b>instead,</b> <b>and</b> later became inflectional endings. Case markings combine primarily with nouns, whereas prepositions can combine with phrases of many different categories. This is why most prepositions in Quenya are used with a noun in the nominative case.|$|E

The city then turned its focus to widening Lincoln Avenue and Ash Street <b>instead,</b> <b>and</b> also requested that the routing of SR78 be moved to Broadway, Washington Avenue, and Ash Street from Grand Avenue to improve traffic flow. Five years later, signs were installed on eastbound SR78, directing traffic headed for the San Diego Zoo Safari Park to use I-15 south to Via Rancho Parkway instead of continuing eastbound, to bypass the Escondido traffic.|$|E

Shackleton, not wanting to delay departure any longer than he had to, decided to go south <b>instead</b> <b>and</b> attempt a circumnavigation of the Antarctic continent. The expedition, known as the Shackleton–Rowett Expedition (John Rowett, {{an old friend of}} Shackleton's, was the main sponsor), would also attempt to discover sub-Antarctic islands and spend the southern winter in the Pacific islands.

5|$|After the war, Cardiff Castle {{escaped the}} slighting, or {{deliberate}} damage and destruction, that affected many other castles.

The Herberts continued to own the castle as the Earls of Pembroke, both during the interregnum and after the restoration of Charles II. The castle's constable continued to act as mayor of the town of Cardiff, controlling the meetings of the town's burgesses, bailffs and aldermen; the Herberts usually appointed members of the more important local gentry to this position during the period.|$|E
