500|$|The tone of {{the songs}} shifts after the first verse, growing more defiant, and the second verse of the song criticizes the {{violence}} under apartheid, with Gabriel singing about trying to sleep but being able to [...] "only dream in red" [...] because of his anger at the death of black people. The lyrics of the third verse seek to motivate the listener: [...] "You can blow out a candle/But you can't blow out a fire/Once the flames begin to catch/The wind will blow it higher", suggesting that though Biko is dead, the movement against apartheid would continue. The lyrics express a sense of outrage, {{not only at the}} suffering of people under apartheid, but at the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> suffering was often forgotten or denied.|$|E
500|$|There {{followed}} a four-year period of peace; but this could simply {{be accounted for}} by the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> Bonville spent that time in service in Gascony, which, it has been suggested, may {{have been one of the}} conditions of the arbitration. It was, though, only a temporary peace for the region as by 1449 the earl besieged Bonville (now promoted to the baronage in recognition of his success in France) in his castle of Taunton for a year. Courtenay supported Richard, Duke of York in his 1452 rebellion at Dartford, even joining him in the field against the king. This treason resulted in him forfeiting his royal offices in the south west, including not only the stewardship of the duchy – which was finally granted to Bonville for life – but Lydford Castle, the Forest of Dartmoor, and the Water of Exe. Hence, as his ally the duke was eclipsed in government, Courtenay was eclipsed by Bonville in the south west. Courtenay had – [...] in imitation of his ally – [...] waged a local war against Bonville and Bonville's ally, the Earl of Wiltshire, between 1451–5. Raising an army of 5–6,000 men, he forced Wiltshire to desert his manor of Lackham, and then returned to the siege of Taunton. The siege was only lifted when the Duke of York arrived unannounced three days later, and took the castle into his own hands, forcing a peace upon the two parties.|$|E

500|$|The {{authors of}} the 1955 The Record Guide, Edward Sackville-West and Desmond Shawe-Taylor write that Saint-Saëns's {{brilliant}} musicianship was [...] "instrumental in drawing the attention of French musicians to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> there are other forms of music besides opera." [...] In the 2001 edition of Grove's Dictionary, Ratner and Daniel Fallon, analysing Saint-Saëns's orchestral music rate the unnumbered Symphony in A (c.1850) as the most ambitious of the composer's juvenilia. Of the works of his maturity, the First Symphony (1853) is a serious and large-scale work, in which the influence of Schumann is detectable. The [...] "Urbs Roma" [...] Symphony (1856) in some ways represents a backward step, being less deftly orchestrated, and [...] "thick and heavy" [...] in its effect. Ratner and Fallon praise the Second Symphony (1859) as {{a fine example of}} orchestral economy and structural cohesion, with passages that show the composer's mastery of fugal writing. The best known of the symphonies is the Third (1886) which, unusually, has prominent parts for piano and organ. It opens in C minor and ends in C major with a stately chorale tune. The four movements are clearly divided into two pairs, a practice Saint-Saëns used elsewhere, notably in the Fourth Piano Concerto (1875) and the First Violin Sonata (1885). The work is dedicated to the memory of Liszt, and uses a recurring motif treated in a Lisztian style of thematic transformation.|$|E

2500|$|Despite Reyes' confession, in October 2016, when Trump campaigned to be president, {{he refused}} to {{acknowledge}} the Central Park Five's innocence and stated that their convictions {{should never have been}} vacated. Trump told CNN: [...] "They admitted they were guilty. The police doing the original investigation say they were guilty. The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> case was settled with so much evidence against them is outrageous. And the woman, so badly injured, will never be the same." [...] Trump's statement attracted criticism from the Central Park Five themselves as well as others, including Republican U.S. Senator John McCain, who called Trump's responses [...] "outrageous statements about the innocent men in the Central Park Five case" [...] and cited it as one of many causes prompting him to retract his endorsement of Trump. Yusuf Salaam, one of the five defendants, said that he had falsely confessed out of coercion, after having been mistreated by police while in custody, deprived of food, drink or sleep for over 24 hours. Filmmaker Ken Burns, who directed the documentary The Central Park Five, called Trump's comments [...] "the height of vulgarity" [...] and racist.|$|E
2500|$|Around {{the same}} time, Hillary Clinton said {{regarding}} Martin Luther King, Jr. {{in an interview}} with Fox News, [...] "I would point to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> Dr. King's dream began to be realized when President Johnson passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, when he was able to get through Congress something that President Kennedy was hopeful to do, the President before had not even tried, but it took a president to get it done. That dream became a reality, the power of that dream became real in people's lives because we had a president who said {{we are going to do}} it, and actually got it accomplished." [...] Some African-American leaders took this statement as a denigration of the accomplishments of King and the larger Civil Rights Movement. Hillary Clinton proceeded to blame Obama for the controversy, claiming his campaign had fanned the flames, a charge which Obama dismissed as [...] "ludicrous." [...] By shortly before, and during, a January 15 Democratic debate in Nevada, Clinton and Obama declared a truce on the matter, with both making reconciliatory statements about race, gender, and each other. However, Clinton's support among African Americans was thought to be damaged, with SUNY Albany's Debra Dickerson stating [...] "The Clintons have to do something dramatic and symbolic to win back the trust of many African-Americans." ...|$|E
2500|$|Australia {{ended the}} day with 400/5 from 90 overs, and Ponting was unbeaten on 176, his 19th test hundred and his fifth for the year 2003, a {{remarkable}} year for him {{in which he had}} hitherto scored 1149 runs at an average of 95.75, and had set his sights for a double century. His innings was exceptional. For his first 100 runs, he picked boundaries in the gaps on the off-side, in spite of the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> region was packed with fielders. He raced on to his 100 from just 117 balls, but slowed down considerably, once he reached his 150. He commented about his innings, admitting that he was satisfied with the way he played on that day. He said, [...] "It was a good wicket, and a good outfield, and you got real value for your strokes." [...] He commented of the Indian bowlers that, [...] "They missed Zaheer...He's been their best bowler the past couple of years, and he bowled well up in Brisbane. They didn't bowl as well as they'd have liked today, but you can't judge them based on that." [...] Ponting's crisp strokeplay combined with aggression to produce a fantastic knock. However, he was aided by the fact that Ganguly got rid of the 8–1 and 7–2 fields thereby [...] depriving his bowlers the chance of getting lbws or any catches.|$|E
