50|$|Some {{enhanced}} recovery technologies {{have been used}} since the 1960s, particularly in the Miocene and Pliocene producing horizons. Steamflooding of the Pliocene commenced in 1973, a method useful for decreasing viscosity of heavy oil and encouraging it to flow to pumping wells. The Miocene pool has been subject to cyclic steam, steamflooding, waterflooding, and <b>fireflooding.</b>|$|R
50|$|Only two of {{the pools}} {{contained}} significant enough reserves {{to be subject to}} enhanced recovery projects: the Tulare and Diatomite, both of which have been steamflooded, waterflooded, and <b>fireflooded.</b> Operators began steamflooding the Tulare Formation in 1963 in order to increase production rates; as of 1997, this was the only enhanced recovery technology still in use there. Oil from the Tulare Formation is heavy crude, with a specific gravity of 10-13 API, and a low sulfur content of 0.23%, while oil from the Diatomite is classified as medium crude, with an API index of 25-30.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the nature}} of extra heavy crudes, the oil {{produced}} from the Carabobo field has extremely high viscosities. Typical heavy crudes produced are around 10,000 cp, which is the viscosity of corn syrup. Recoveries in this area are naturally very low. As a result, emerging technologies have recently made recoveries high enough to produce the extra heavy crudes economically. Specifically, enhanced oil recovery methods have dramatically improved recoveries. Methods such as immiscible gas injection, polymer flooding, and in situ combustion, better known as <b>fireflooding,</b> have all seen limited success in the Carabobo field. However, steam injection and microbial enhanced oil recovery (MEOR) have seen the most success.|$|R

5000|$|Several {{enhanced}} recovery techniques {{have been used}} in the Fruitvale Field. In 1972, operators began waterflooding, thereby attempting to push the heavy crude to production wells, increasing the rate of extraction; in 1976, they began using cyclic steam flooding, a generally more effective technique for heavy oil, as the heat considerably reduces the oil's viscosity, helping it to flow. [...] <b>Fireflooding,</b> an {{enhanced recovery}} technology in which flammable units deep underground are ignited—in this case, a 15 ft thick section of oil sand—began in 1980 in the portion of the field operated by Gulf. Engineers at the time believed that up to 400 million further barrels of oil could be recovered from the field, oil which could be made to flow due to the intense heat generated by this process.|$|R
50|$|Enhanced oil {{recovery}} {{methods have been}} implemented in the Carabobo oil field to improve the low recovery factors. Along with microbial enhanced {{oil recovery}}, which involves using microorganisms as biosurfactants to reduce the viscosities of the extra heavy crudes, immiscible gas injection, polymer flooding, and in situ combustion, better known as <b>fireflooding,</b> have all been used to improve the recovery {{of oil in the}} field. The advancements in horizontal drilling techniques have led to the use of steam assisted gravity drainage in extra heavy oil reservoirs. Steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) involves drilling two holes, one above the oil and the other below. Steam is then injected into the upper hole, causing the steam to condense and heat the oil. The oil becomes less viscous, and drains into the hole below due to gravity. Using this method, recovery could be as high as 87%, which is a vast improvement over other methods in use for extraction of extra heavy crude oils.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Amoco Canada {{has been}} {{operating}} a pressure cycling <b>fireflood</b> at Morgan, in the Lloydminster a ea of Alberta, Canada, since the mid- 1980 s. A pressure cycle consists of air injection into a central injector accompanied by production from its surrounding producers. The reservoir contains a 12 ~ API heavy crude and the wells are laid out in 30 acre (12 ha), seven-spot patterns. The rapid drop in crude oil prices in 1986 led to the successful development and implementation f an innovative pressure cycling-combustion process. This paper looks at {{the performance of the}} project and the numerical modelling done to history-match t e results. The numerical modelling effort was undertaken toexplain the high oil rates (individual wells at 120 STB/D = 19 m 3 /D) and the extraordinarily low injected air to produced oil ratio (AOR) of less than 2 MSCF/STB (355 m 3 /m 3). Mechanisms incorporated in the numerous model include: (1) a high-speed channel from the injector to the producer, (2) combustion gas entrainment bythe oil phase and (3) oil upgrading. The physics involved with ese mechanisms are explained and the model results are compared with the actual field data. Also, model sensitivity to variations inthe assumptions regarding the mechanisms are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – Smouldering is the slow, low-temperature, flameless form of {{combustion}} of a condensed fuel. It poses {{safety and}} environmental hazards and allows novel technological application but its fundamentals remain mostly {{unknown to the}} scientific community. The terms filtering combustion, smoking problem, deep seated fires, hidden fires, peat or peatlands fires, lagging fires, low oxygen combustion, in-situ combustion, <b>fireflood</b> and underground gasification, all refer to smouldering combustion phenomena. This paper attempts to synthesize a comprehensive view of smouldering combustion bringing together contributions from diverse scientific disciplines. Smouldering {{is the leading cause}} of deaths in residential fires and a source of safety concerns in space and commercial flights. Smouldering wildfires destroy large amounts of biomass and cause great damage to the soil, contributing significantly to atmospheric pollutant and green house gas emissions. Subsurface fires in coal mines and seams burn for very long periods of time, making them the oldest continuously burning fires on Earth. Worthy of consideration are the novel environmental and energy technologies being developed based on the direct application of smouldering combustion. These include the remediation of contaminated soils, production of biochar for long term storage of carbon, enchanted oil extraction from reservoirs and gasification of coal seams. The prospect of new opportunities for science and engineering in smouldering combustion are noticeable, but a much larger international research effort is required to increase the number of multidisciplinary experimental, theoretical and field studies...|$|E

5000|$|Since the oil {{is heavy}} crude, with API gravity of only 9-11 in the Lombardi Sands and 13 in the Aurignac, getting it to flow to {{production}} wells can be difficult. Various enhanced recovery technologies developed during the 1960s and 1970s have made the process easier. Steam flooding is the technology of choice in the San Ardo Field; injection wells force steam into the ground to heat the crude and decrease its viscosity, and if strategically placed, can push the oil to nearby production wells. Steam flooding {{has been used in}} both the Aurignac and Lombardi sands since 1966-1967; water flooding is also being used in the Aurignac. The peak production from the field was in 1967, the first year in which both productive units were subject to steam flooding. [...] <b>Fireflooding,</b> a technology in which {{the oil is}} ignited by an electric coil in the presence of oxygen, with the combustion front moving towards a production well, and sometimes followed by water flooding as a further assist, has also been used in several of the San Ardo pools.|$|R
