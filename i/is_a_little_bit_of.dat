500|$|The film's overall {{structure}} {{was influenced by}} the detective fiction of Raymond Chandler. Ethan said, [...] "We wanted something that would generate a certain narrative feeling – like a modern Raymond Chandler story, and that's why it had to be set in Los Angeles ... We wanted to have a narrative flow, a story that moves like a Chandler book through different parts of town and different social classes." [...] The use of the Stranger's voice-over also came from Chandler as Joel remarked, [...] "He <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> an audience substitute. In the movie adaptation of Chandler it's the main character that speaks off-screen, but we didn't want to reproduce that though it obviously has echoes. It's as if someone was commenting on the plot from an all-seeing point of view. And at the same time rediscovering the old earthiness of a Mark Twain." ...|$|E
500|$|To avoid {{confusion}} with Larter and Carter, Cook {{was required to}} dye her hair brown for the role. [...] "I like being a chameleon. It opens you up for so much more in this work. You don't get typecast," [...] Cook professed. Landes also denied plots regarding Thomas and Kimberly's relationship. [...] "It's kind of a protected relationship, more like a brother/sister thing than a love interest. They didn’t want to go there, I guess. They did go that way in an earlier draft of the script but they didn’t want it to seem like the cop is like lascivious or something. So what they have now, hopefully, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> chemistry {{and you get the}} idea that through tragedy something good will come. So it ends in an optimistic way, that maybe they can be together but there’s no real love story," [...] Landes articulated.|$|E
500|$|Much of {{the lyrics}} were {{composed}} by Batmanglij and Koenig in Batmanglij's apartment (a former factory building in Brooklyn) and at a rented cottage on Martha's Vineyard. The lyrics explore more mature, world-weary themes such as growing old and disillusionment with American foreign policy. The album eschewed the theme of privileged youth from their first two albums in favor of characters with adult responsibilities and reflections on the passage of time. Faith and mortality are recurring themes on songs such as [...] "Unbelievers", [...] "Worship You", and [...] "Everlasting Arms". Koenig likened their first three albums to Brideshead Revisited: [...] "The naïve joyous school days in the beginning. Then {{the expansion of the}} world, travel, seeing other places, learning {{a little bit more about}} how people live. And then the end <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> growing up, starting to think more seriously about your life and your faith. If people could look at our three albums as a bildungsroman, I’d be O.K. with that." [...] According to Brice Ezell from PopMatters, Modern Vampires of the City is [...] "very much an indie rock record" [...] because of Koenig's voice and diction, which reveals [...] "the youth that he and his bandmates so often strive to shrug off." [...] Ezell asserts that, on songs such as [...] "Unbelievers", the [...] "reckless abandon" [...] expressed by the lyrics reveals [...] "the group's grasp on the genuine rebellion that indie rock ought to strive for." ...|$|E

The fire of our boat guns kept the French back for a time, and when at last the Turkish gun-boats got into position, they had to fall back and make advances against the castle in a regular way. Unfortunately Mustapha Pasha had been taken in the village, and the garrison had no one to command them, still they resisted for two days, and then surrendered, being almost mad with thirst, for, although we spared as much water as we could, it was impossible for us to find sufficient for six or seven thousand extra men.|$|E

When you see a craft with every rope in its place, everything spotlessly clean, the brass work polished up, and the paint carefully attended to, you may be sure that the skipper is as particular in more important matters. It is just so with our man. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> a galley, but his saucepans shine like gold, everything is clean and in its place.

In good art, whether painting or sculpture, I have again and again told you every touch is necessary and beautifully intended. Now it falls within the compass of ordinary application to place rightly all the folds of drapery or gleams of light on a chain, or ornaments in a pattern; {{but when it comes to}} placing every leaf in a tree, the painter gets tired. Here, for instance, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> Sandro Botticelli background; I have purposefully sketched it in the slightest way, that you might see how the entire value of it depends on thoughtful placing. There is no texture aimed at, no completion, scarcely any variety of light and shade; but by mere care in the placing the thing is beautiful. Well, every leaf, every cloud, every touch is placed with the same care in great work; and when this is done as by John Bellini in the picture of Peter Martyr,[2] or as it was by Titian in the great Peter Martyr, with every leaf in a wood he gets tired. I know no other such landscape in the world as that is, or as that was.|$|E
