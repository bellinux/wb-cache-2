40|$|Over {{the past}} two years the Environmental Sciences Section of the Westinghouse Savannah River Company and the University of South Carolina have {{developed}} a full-featured spatial data query system for the Savannah River Site. This Environmental Data Atlas, which operates across multiple platforms, is designed to provide scientists with easy access {{to a wide range of}} GIS and remote sensing data resources. This paper describes the method that has been developed to extend the Environmental Data Atlas to incorporate bibliographical data. The bibliographic search function was determined by the scientists to be an extremely important enhancement that will enable them to utilize geographic keys to locate obscure references and databases. The method uses a <b>Hot</b> <b>Link</b> function to launch a parsing algorithm by pointing to geographic features. The parsing algorithm efficiently sorts through a list of references based on the keyword associated with the feature. The matched bibliographical entries are formatted into a text file that is displayed in a scrollable window. Any graphics associated with the actual reference can also be scanned and linked to an additional <b>Hot</b> <b>Link.</b> An additional parsing system was used to automatically create the bibliographical database from a comprehensive CD-ROM version of the Environmental Information Document prepared by the Environmental Sciences Section. This extensive digital reference represents a summary of much of the recent ecological information available on the site. The methods used in this system are directly linked to a commercially available software and provide a universal approach to establishing a geographically based document retrieval system...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project {{was to develop a}} system to enter, store, retrieve, analyze and report data entirely over the Internet. The {{selected}} approach merged the Netscape Enterprise Server’s capability to create “applications ” using client-side and server-side JavaScript with the statistical processing features of SAS through the web-based software: SAS IntrNet™. The application was designed to collect measures of physical health for a cohort of undergraduate students. The measures were first processed on “the client-side ” to provide personal feedback. A request link enabled the client to send their measures to the “server ” using “server-side ” JavaScript write commands. The data were appended to a storage data set comprised of responses from visitors that agreed to submit their data. SAS programs were written to provide descriptive statistics and tests of inference for the data set. A menu of available SAS programs was posted on the homepage web-site. Selecting a specific <b>hot</b> <b>link,</b> users could invoke a particular SAS program to analyze the data set. Each SAS program produced an output file that was posted to the Internet for the user to review.
