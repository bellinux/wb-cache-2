5|$|Goebbels, however, wanted more, {{and he saw}} in Wessel's {{shooting}} {{the possibility of a}} propaganda bonanza. The beginning of his plan was to turn Wessel's funeral into a mass demonstration full of speeches and processions of SA men in uniform, but <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> the necessary police permits to do so, even after Wessel's sister requested Hindenburg to relent.|$|E
5|$|Barnes {{married a}} schoolteacher, Alison Margaret Edward on 11 June 1942. Alison was the {{daughter}} of Kenneth Edward, a Scottish Professor of Theology at the University of Sydney. The couple met at a country dance, when Barnes, on his way back from an exhibition match in Katoomba, was bet the price of the meal that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> the young girl to dance with him. Within twelve months the pair were married.|$|E

He {{spent seven years}} at the helm, guiding the club to promotion out of the Fourth Division in 1980–81 and 1983–84, before he took on the manager's job at Leeds United in October 1985. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> the club promoted back into the top-flight and left the club in September 1988. He returned to Doncaster in July 1989, ending his second spell in charge in November 1991.|$|E

5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of his work with Queen in June 1991, Mercury retired {{to his home in}} Kensington, west London. His former partner, Mary Austin, had been a particular comfort in his final years, and {{in the last few weeks}} of his life made regular visits to his home to look after him. Near the end of his life Mercury was starting to lose his sight, and he deteriorated to the point where <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> out of bed. Due to his worsening condition, Mercury decided to hasten his death by refusing to take his medication and continued taking only painkillers.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{his time}} as housing {{secretary}} was considered unsuccessful. However, although <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> federal funding for empowerment zones passed during his tenure, by 1992 38 states had created empowerment zones, and in 1994 $3.5billion was approved for them under President Clinton. A free market Kemp initiative to allow homeowners to subdivide their houses {{for the purpose of}} creating rental units without inordinate bureaucracy did not get executed under the Clinton administration, however. In 1992, with H. Ross Perot mounting a formidable campaign, Kemp was again considered a Vice Presidential candidate.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, Julian founded his own {{research}} firm, Julian Laboratories, Inc. He brought {{many of his}} best chemists, including African-Americans and women, from Glidden to his own company. Julian won a contract to provide Upjohn with $2 million worth of progesterone (equivalent to $ million today). To compete against Syntex, {{he would have to}} use the same Mexican yam Mexican barbasco trade as his starting material. Julian used his own money and borrowed from friends to build a processing plant in Mexico, but <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> a permit from the government to harvest the yams. Abraham Zlotnik, a former Jewish University of Vienna classmate whom Julian had helped escape from the Holocaust, led a search to find a new source of the yam in Guatemala for the company.|$|E

60|$|Lovel endeavoured to apologize, and {{to explain}} away his ill-timed phrase, and pleaded his inexperience. But he was not at once quite successful.

5|$|Mary Ann Davis, who {{had bought}} the Fornells grant on Key Biscayne in 1821, died in Galveston, Texas in 1885. Her son Waters Smith Davis began taking steps to assert the family title to the island. In 1887 he {{purchased}} {{the rights of the}} other Davis heirs and received a new deed in his name. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> a clear title, however. Venancio Sanchez still claimed a half share of the Fornells Grant, two of the town lots had been sold to William Harney around 1840, and Osborne and Field had their deed from the Florida Internal Improvement Fund. Davis received quitclaims from Osborn and Field, and on the Harney lots, but was unable to settle with Sanchez. He finally received a patent from the United States government for his land in 1898. In 1903 Davis bought the abandoned Cape Florida lighthouse from the United States Treasury for US$400.|$|E
5|$|Trainspotting {{director}} Danny Boyle was the producers' {{first choice}} {{to direct the}} film. Boyle and his producer met with effects supervisors to discuss the film, {{but he was not}} interested in pursuing the project and went on to make A Life Less Ordinary instead. Peter Jackson was also approached, but declined as <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> excited about an Alien film. In 1995, after the release of The Usual Suspects, 20th Century Fox approached Bryan Singer to direct. Jean-Pierre Jeunet was asked to direct, as the film's producers believed he had a unique visual style. Jeunet had just completed the script to Amélie and was surprised he was offered the job for Alien Resurrection, as he thought the franchise had finished with Alien 3 and believed that making a sequel was a bad idea. Jeunet, however, accepted the project with a budget of $70 million. He required an interpreter as he did not speak much English when filming began.|$|E
5|$|Under {{increasingly}} immense {{pressure to}} resign, Agnew took {{the position that}} a sitting vice president could not be indicted and met with Speaker of the House Carl Albert on September 25, asking for an investigation. He cited as precedent an 1826 House investigation of Vice President John C. Calhoun, who was alleged to have taken improper payments while a cabinet member. Albert, second in line to the presidency under Agnew, responded {{that it would be}} improper for the House to act in a matter before the courts. Agnew also filed a motion to block any indictment on the grounds that he had been prejudiced by improper leaks from the Justice Department, and tried to rally public opinion, giving a speech before a friendly audience in Los Angeles asserting his innocence and attacking the prosecution. Nevertheless, Agnew entered into negotiations for a plea bargain, and wrote in his memoirs that he did so because he was worn out from the extended crisis, to protect his family, and because he feared <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> a fair trial. He made his decision on October 5, and plea negotiations took place over the following days. On October 9, Agnew visited Nixon at the White House and informed the President of his impending resignation.|$|E
60|$|Beneath an {{appearance}} and a vocabulary more orthodox than ever, the Colonel's allegiance to Authority {{and the laws}} of Form was really shaken; <b>he</b> simply <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> out of his head the sight of those two young people sitting side by side, nor the tone of Olive's voice, when she had repeated his regrettable words about happiness at home.|$|R
60|$|It wasn't that Whitefoot minded {{hunting for}} food. He {{would have done}} that anyway, even though he had had close at hand a store-house with plenty in it.

25|$|Although Torishima {{grew up in}} Niigata Prefecture, he did {{not like}} the people there as they had nothing in common to talk about, so he spent his youth alone reading books.

50|$|In 2003 Vaņins {{signed a}} {{contract}} with FC Moscow. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> manage to <b>get</b> into the first team, mostly being used in the reserves. As playing for the reserve team did not please the Latvian international, he decided to leave.|$|R
50|$|Emini {{spoke of}} his devastation when he was {{informed}} by Chris Murphy that <b>he</b> (Murphy) <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> financial support from billionaire James Packer - an option he had earlier flagged along with securitising his property portfolio which was worth more than $10m. Emini told the court that he had nowhere to move at that time, because Opes had insufficient cash - only about $12 million - to cover the shortfall and would therefore fail the ASX liquid capital requirements.|$|R
60|$|The {{pilot who}} {{deposited}} that blank in the Cairo box (after adding to it {{the details of}} every crossing {{all the way down}} from St. Louis) took out and read half a dozen fresh reports (from upward-bound steamers) concerning the river between Cairo and Memphis, posted himself thoroughly, returned them to the box, and went back aboard his boat again so armed against accident that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> possibly <b>get</b> his boat into trouble without bringing the most ingenious carelessness to his aid.|$|R
25|$|The {{relationship}} between Jones and Rosario had {{been marked by}} domestic violence, and eventually she ended it and he moved out. However, he had in early July 2012 twice attempted {{to break into the}} apartment, even after Rosario changed the locks. Hedgepeth drove her roommate to court to get a protective order that required Jones {{to stay away from the}} apartment. Jones reportedly resented Hedgepeth's influence over his former girlfriend, and at one point reportedly threatened during a phone conversation with Hedgepeth to kill her if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> back together with Rosario.|$|E
25|$|On 20 December the Rates Bill was published, {{with the}} new Environment Secretary Patrick Jenkin making it clear he would resign if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> it enacted. It was {{anticipated}} that the Bill would be highly controversial especially {{with members of the}} House of Lords and Jenkin was said to have reminded them of the Salisbury Convention which prevented the Lords from rejecting any Bill mentioned in an election manifesto. The Bill was soon under criticism in Parliament by Conservative MPs Geoffrey Rippon and Anthony Beaumont-Dark, and outside it by David Howell.|$|E
25|$|Elected praetor peregrinus, the praetor {{in charge}} of court cases {{involving}} non-Roman citizens, for 76 BC, Marcus Lucullus presided over one cause célèbre, the trial against Gaius Antonius Hybrida (later Cicero's colleague as consul). Antonius had enriched himself shamelessly as a legate of Sulla in Greece during the First Mithridatic War. The prosecutor, the young Julius Caesar, won a conviction. Antonius managed, however, to have his conviction overturned by appealing to the people's tribunes. because, as he said, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> a fair trial in Rome against a Greek man.|$|E

Armaan does not turn up for three months, and his employer makes the difficult decision to sack him, but he asks his boss to listen to why <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> come. <b>Getting</b> soft, his employer allows him to drive to Pune where he has a meeting.

When he was told <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> on the Virgin flight, Tidswell told Fairfax Media he was shocked when he was told new terrorism laws meant he could not wear the shirt on the plane. But a Virgin Australia spokesman said the T-shirt was simply deemed offensive, not a threat.|$|E
25|$|The early {{reign of}} the Iberian king Vakhtang I dubbed Gorgasali (447-502) was marked by the {{relative}} revival of the kingdom. Formally a vassal of the Persians, he secured the northern borders by subjugating the Caucasian mountaineers, and brought the adjacent western and southern Georgian lands under his control. He established an autocephalic patriarchate at Mtskheta, and made Tbilisi his capital. In 482 he led a general uprising against Persia and started a desperate war for independence that lasted for twenty years. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> Byzantine support and was eventually defeated, dying in battle in 502.|$|E
25|$|Dave Gaubatz, {{a former}} Air Force special {{investigator}} {{who was as}} a civilian employee in Iraq in 2003, says that while in Iraq, he acquired what he considered reliable information about WMD caches in four locations that had gas and chemical weapons that were recently produced. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> U.S. military officials {{to look into the}} matter, so he eventually contacted Weldon and Representative Peter Hoekstra, head of the House Intelligence Committee, to share his information and to try to get them to pressure the Defense Department and intelligence agencies to do the WMD searches in four locales.|$|E
60|$|It was {{not exactly}} his business, and both Maccario and Harding, who had {{remained}} at the hacienda because <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> well <b>get</b> away, had protested against his undertaking it, but since the latter had given him Nettie’s message Appleby had been curiously restless, and felt that the excitement might help him {{to shake off the}} thoughts and fancies that troubled him.

2500|$|Meanwhile, {{he began}} a {{campaign}} to spread support for federation to the people with meetings in Corowa and Albury in December 1892.

In December, he and Richard O'Connor, the Minister for Justice, were questioned about their agreement to act as private lawyers against the government in Proudfoot v. the Railway Commissioners. While Barton resigned the brief, he lost a motion on the right of ministers to act in their professional capacity as lawyers in actions against the government, and immediately resigned as Attorney-General.|$|R
60|$|When {{the banker}} told Uncle Henry {{that he must}} pay the money in thirty days or leave the farm, the poor man was in despair, as <b>he</b> knew <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> {{possibly}} <b>get</b> the money. So he told his wife, Aunt Em, of his trouble, and she first cried a little and then said {{that they must be}} brave and do the best they could, and go away somewhere and try to earn an honest living. But they were getting old and feeble and she feared that they <b>could</b> <b>not</b> take care of Dorothy as well as they had formerly done.
