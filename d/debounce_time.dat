40|$|For {{real time}} {{computer}} based studies in coulometry, mercury drop time measurement, thickness measurement in plating, speed and frequency measurement in electrochemical process control equipments, {{the requirement of}} a microprocessor based industrial counter is felt. With little number of external hardware, a microprocessor based frequency counter is designed. Software controlled facilities are: (a) <b>Debounce</b> <b>time</b> facility (b) frequency range upto a maximum of 100 kHz (c) six digit display (dl selection of time interval (e) storage and sequence controlled measurement. The details on developed software on MPF- 1 - microprocessor kit are presented...|$|E
40|$|A new {{hierarchical}} control strategy for active hydropneumatic suspension systems is proposed. This strategy considers the dynamic {{characteristics of the}} actuator. The top hierarchy controller uses a combined control scheme: a genetic algorithm- (GA-) based self-tuning proportional-integral-derivative controller and a fuzzy logic controller. For practical implementations of the proposed control scheme, a GA-based self-learning process is initiated only when the defined performance index of vehicle dynamics exceeds a certain <b>debounce</b> <b>time</b> threshold. The designed control algorithm is implemented on a virtual prototype and cosimulations are performed with different road disturbance inputs. Cosimulation {{results show that the}} active hydropneumatic suspension system designed in this study significantly improves riding comfort characteristics of vehicles. The robustness and adaptability of the proposed controller are also examined when the control system is subjected to extremely rough road conditions...|$|E
40|$|TCS is {{company that}} specialises in systems {{integration}} {{and development of}} products for industrial application. Their flagship product for distributed control is the CPU 5. This project covers the design and development of a backplane solution to solve the limitation of the CPU 5 that it only has {{a limited number of}} inputs and outputs. The next iteration of the CPU 5, is to be called the PCC. Background research was carried out into the needs of TCS and their target markets. The IEC 61499 standard, Windows CE platform and ISaGRAF software environment were also investigated. The project planning was analysed to gain an understanding of R&D project planning. This project concluded {{that it was important to}} be able to make changes to the plan as the project proceeds so that it can still be completed by the deadline. TCS had set the limitation that the backplane protocol must be a serial bus. Various different types of serial bus were investigated including CAN, USB, Light Peak (optical) and EIA 485. The bus selected was a CAN bus with a custom protocol. Research was carried out into the operation of existing bus drivers and protocols such as DeviceNet and CANOpen to determine an appropriate protocol for a serial bus based backplane. Software was developed to manage devices attached to the backplane. Hardware and software for a digital I/O module was developed. Various ways of updating the I/O were investigated, an event-based and cyclic updating method was implemented with an adjustable <b>debounce</b> <b>time</b> to maximise performance and robustness. Hardware and software for a serial port module was developed. A major challenge faced was to transmit a stream based protocol across a frame based CAN backplane. Software for an Ethernet module was developed. Software design included development of an NDIS compatible miniport driver for Windows CE and software for the slave module. To demonstrate that the PCC is an effective platform for distributed control, a test setup was created to be shown at a trade show in Nuremberg. The trade show setup was fully programmed in compliance with the IEC 61499 standard and demonstrated the power of the PCC...|$|E
