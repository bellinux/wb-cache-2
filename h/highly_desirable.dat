5|$|Decompression {{models and}} {{algorithms}} developed for binary mixtures of nitrogen and oxygen {{can not be}} used for gases containing significant amounts of other diluent gases without modification {{to take into account the}} different solubilities and diffusion constants of the alternative or added diluents. It is also <b>highly</b> <b>desirable</b> to test any such modifications, to make sure the schedules produced by them are acceptably safe.|$|E
5|$|Edisto Beach, South Carolina {{was changed}} forever by Gracie, due to human efforts to renourish the beach after its passage. Most {{of the shell}} hash beach {{currently}} at Edisto was placed there after Gracie. In order to expand the beach, an inland marsh was excavated {{and moved to the}} shoreline. This created <b>highly</b> <b>desirable</b> beach front property which led to new development along the coast seaward of Palmetto Boulevard, but also created an environmental catastrophe along the nearby ocean floor. A species of isopod which grows in coastal estuaries, the Cyathura Polita, disappeared after the passage of this hurricane from the Ashepoo River in South Carolina. The Kermadec petrel, a bird, was swept to Lookout Mountain Sanctuary in Pennsylvania during Gracie, marking the first time it appeared in North America.|$|E
5|$|Harmonia {{is set in}} a post-apocalyptic world {{sometime}} in the future. A rapid decline in human civilization began once the population hit its peak of 10 billion, caused in part by pollution and war. During this time, artificially intelligent, emotional androids called Phiroids were developed to serve as partners for humans. Although Phiroids were originally powered by batteries for the first two generations, they were afterwards developed to be powered by eating food, making them nearly indistinguishable from humans. Artificial memories could also be implanted into the Phiroids, making them <b>highly</b> <b>desirable,</b> leading them to be produced in numbers that eventually rivaled the human population {{at a time when the}} birth rate was already in decline. Eventually, nuclear warfare and the resulting nuclear fallout killed off most of humanity, culminating in a world covered in dark clouds and ash blocking out sunlight, land stripped of vegetation, and an ocean that could no longer support life. Some people were placed in cryogenic facilities in an attempt to sleep long enough until the environment improved even a little bit.|$|E
5|$|Returning from Europe in October 1921, he {{was invited}} by Prime Minister Billy Hughes to join his {{government}} as Minister for Trade and Customs. Bruce was not interested he {{was the head of}} one of Australia's largest importing houses and thus had a serious conflict of interest with the portfolio, as well as being very busy running the affairs of that business. But he countered by stating that he might feel obliged to accept if the position of Treasurer was offered, knowing that it had already been promised to Walter Massy-Greene. To Bruce's surprise, Hughes agreed, although Massy Greene was to remain the number two in the government and Minister for Defence. Although he had only been in parliament for three years, his business background was <b>highly</b> <b>desirable</b> to Hughes, who was facing growing criticism from the pro-business wing of the party, who had become increasingly suspicious of Hughes and his interventionist approach to the economy. Influential party figures such as Senator George Pearce and the National Union has also identified Bruce as their preferred choice for the treasury.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{completion}} of her refit in July, she {{transferred to the}} Mediterranean Fleet, once again becoming Fisher's flagship. A strong proponent of the design of Renown, Fisher also found her <b>highly</b> <b>desirable</b> for the hosting of the social events required of a flagship in peacetime. Captain Hugh Tyrwhitt was appointed in command on 19 March 1900. Renown also underwent a special refit at Malta from February to May 1900 to meet Fisher's requirements for her. This included {{the transfer of the}} main deck 12-pounders to the superstructure. The ship recommissioned on 19 November 1900, and served as flagship until Fisher ended his tour as Commander-in-Chief on 4 June 1902, after which she continued to serve in the Mediterranean Fleet as a private ship under a new captain, Arthur Murray Farquhar. Renown participated in combined manoeuvres off Cephalonia and Morea between 29 September and 6 October 1902.|$|E
5|$|In the yeshiva world, the {{brightest}} students are <b>highly</b> <b>desirable</b> as chavrusas. However, there are {{pros and cons}} to learning with chavrusas who are stronger, weaker, or equal in knowledge and ability to the student. A stronger chavrusa will correct and fill in the student's knowledge and help him improve his learning techniques, acting more like a teacher. With a chavrusa who is equal in knowledge and ability, the student is forced to prove his point with logic rather than by right of seniority, which improves his ability to think logically, analyze other people's opinions objectively, and accept criticism. With a weaker chavrusa, who often worries over and questions each step, the student is forced to understand the material thoroughly, refine and organize his thoughts in a logical structure, present his viewpoint clearly, {{and be ready to}} justify each and every point. The stronger chavrusa helps the student acquire a great deal of information, but the weaker chavrusa helps the student learn how to learn. Yeshiva students are usually advised to have one of each of these three types of chavrusas in order to develop on all three levels.|$|E

25|$|Mountainous {{parts of}} {{southern}} Silesia feature many significant and attractive tourism destinations (e.g., Karpacz, Szczyrk, Wisła). Silesia is generally well forested. This is because greenness is generally <b>highly</b> <b>desirable</b> {{by the local}} population, particularly in the highly industrialized parts of Silesia.|$|E
25|$|The Warehouse District {{has become}} a <b>highly</b> <b>desirable</b> night life precinct and {{residential}} address in Regina and appears likely to become a salutary exception to the general trend of commercial and residential development during the postwar years {{away from the city}} centre to the periphery.|$|E
25|$|Shorter {{wavelength}} {{bands are}} particularly useful for aviation use. An antenna that broadcast a useful signal at longwave frequencies would {{be larger than}} a typical aircraft (although Zeppelins had no problems) and even higher frequencies in the high frequency (HF) and very high frequency (VHF) bands were <b>highly</b> <b>desirable.</b>|$|E
25|$|It may be <b>highly</b> <b>desirable,</b> while a {{sensitive}} operation is in progress, {{to have the}} HN conduct distracting operations. The knowledge of the sensitive operation must be tightly held, {{and most of the}} troops carrying out the distraction—which ideally has a result more than mere distraction—will not know why they are taking a particular action.|$|E
25|$|Peak {{accelerations}} can {{be increased}} by designing the vehicle with a reduced mass, usually achieved by {{a reduction in the}} fuel load and tankage and associated structures, but obviously this reduces range, delta-v and burn time. Still, for some applications that rockets are used for, a high peak acceleration applied for just a short time is <b>highly</b> <b>desirable.</b>|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately, the {{category}} whose objects are the sets of NF and whose morphisms are the functions between those sets is not cartesian closed; {{this is a}} <b>highly</b> <b>desirable</b> property for any set theory to have. Intuitively, {{it means that the}} functions of NF do not curry as one would normally expect functions to. Furthermore, it means that NF is not a topos.|$|E
25|$|The {{preference}} or disfavour for darker skin has varied {{depending on}} geographical area and time. Today, darker skin {{is viewed as}} fashionable and {{as a sign of}} well-being in some societies. This resulted in the development of tanning industry in several countries. However, in some countries, dark skin is not seen as <b>highly</b> <b>desirable</b> or indicative of higher class, especially among women.|$|E
25|$|All apartments on {{the west}} side of the {{building}} above the seventh floor overlook Central Park and the Reservoir, over the top of the adjacent William Starr Miller House. This is a <b>highly</b> <b>desirable</b> feature for a condominium in the city and one which fetches a substantial premium. This side of the structure was extensively reworked, with large windows and balconies on some apartments.|$|E
25|$|Electric {{lighting}} was <b>highly</b> <b>desirable.</b> The {{light was}} much brighter than oil or gas lamps, {{and there was}} no soot. Although early electricity was very expensive compared to today, it was far cheaper and more convenient than oil or gas lighting. Electric lighting was so much safer than oil or gas that some companies were able to pay for the electricity with the insurance savings.|$|E
25|$|Whitchurch airport {{continued}} to be used after World War II, but the introduction of heavier post-war airliners made a runway extension <b>highly</b> <b>desirable.</b> However, this was difficult at Whitchurch, because of the nearby housing estates. In June 1955, the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation agreed to sell the Lulsgate airfield to Bristol Corporation, {{for the development of}} a new airport there. Bristol Gliding Club moved out to Nympsfield in Gloucestershire.|$|E
25|$|The general {{trend toward}} {{abundant}} surface ornamentation in the Elizabethan Era was expressed in clothing, especially amongst the aristocracy in England. Shirts and chemises were embroidered with blackwork and edged in lace. Heavy cut velvets and brocades were further ornamented with applied bobbin lace, {{gold and silver}} embroidery, and jewels. Toward {{the end of the}} period, polychrome (multicolored) silk embroidery became <b>highly</b> <b>desirable</b> and fashionable for the public representation of aristocratic wealth.|$|E
25|$|Though {{no longer}} a working dock, Limehouse Basin with its marina remains a working facility. The same is not true of the wharf {{buildings}} that have survived, {{most of which are}} now <b>highly</b> <b>desirable</b> residential properties. Limehouse Basin connects to the Regent's Canal via the Commercial Road Lock to the north, and the River Thames via Limehouse Basin Lock to the south. The Limehouse Cut connects the Basin to the River Lea in the east.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1990s Guyana {{has seen}} the return of faith schools, {{primarily}} in the secondary sector. There is one International School - the Georgetown International School. The other private schools recognised by the Ministry of Education are: ISA Islamic School (Muslim), Mae's School, The New Guyana School, The School of the Nations (Bahai) and Marian's Academy (Roman Catholic). These private schools have become <b>highly</b> <b>desirable</b> as they are seen to offer {{a better quality of}} education compared to public schools.|$|E
25|$|Given {{the current}} {{size of the}} Web, even large search engines cover {{only a portion of}} the {{publicly}} available part. A 2009 study showed even large-scale search engines index no more than 40-70% of the indexable Web; a previous study by Steve Lawrence and Lee Giles showed that no search engine indexed more than 16% of the Web in 1999. As a crawler always downloads just a fraction of the Web pages, it is <b>highly</b> <b>desirable</b> for the downloaded fraction to contain the most relevant pages and not just a random sample of the Web.|$|E
25|$|During this time, Ashfield {{was seen}} as a <b>highly</b> <b>desirable</b> {{location}} compared to the city, which had become crowded and pestilent. Many grand Victorian houses were built {{in the latter part of}} the 19th century. But by the time of World War I, the suburb had fallen out of favour and the rich residents had mostly headed for the North Shore. Many of the grand homes were knocked down in the 1920s and 30s and replaced with small art deco blocks of flats or semi-detached houses. A few remain, however, and are listed in the Landmarks section.|$|E
25|$|The spacious lots were {{considered}} <b>highly</b> <b>desirable</b> {{because they were}} close to Drake Park, which runs along {{the east side of}} the Deschutes River. In addition, many home sites had choice views of the Cascade Mountain peaks. The area was only a block away from Bend's downtown business district so the city hall, public library, and local Catholic, Methodist, and Episcopalian churches were within easy walking distance. The district was also within walking distance of the Brooks-Scanlon and Shevlin-Hixon lumber mills. As a result, the Drake Park district quickly became the preferred neighborhood for the city's most prominent businessmen.|$|E
25|$|Other {{problems}} involve states being {{reluctant to}} relinquish involvement in other regional groups, e.g., Tanzania's withdrawal from COMESA but staying within the SADC bloc for the Economic Partnership Agreement {{negotiations with the}} European Union. Many Tanzanians are also concerned because creating a common market means removing obstacles to the free movement of labour and capital. Free movement of labour {{may be perceived as}} <b>highly</b> <b>desirable</b> in Uganda and Kenya, and have important developmental benefits in Tanzania; however, in Tanzania there is widespread resistance to the idea of ceding land rights to foreigners, including citizens of Kenya and Uganda.|$|E
25|$|Sumatran orangutans use {{sticks to}} acquire seeds from a {{particular}} fruit. When {{the fruit of the}} Neesia tree ripens, its hard, ridged husk softens until it falls open. Inside are seeds that are <b>highly</b> <b>desirable</b> to the orangutans, but they are surrounded by fibreglass-like hairs that are painful if eaten. A Neesia-eating orangutan will select a 12cm stick, strip off the bark, and then carefully collect the hairs with it. Once the fruit is safe, the ape will eat the seeds using the stick or its fingers. Sumatran orangutans will use a stick to poke a bees' nest wall, move it around and catch the honey.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{trade-off}} between the amplifying {{effect of the}} resonators {{and the length of}} sustain of a ringing bar. The energy in a ringing bar comes from the initial mallet strike, and that energy can either be used to make the bar ring louder initially, or not as loudly but {{for a longer period of}} time. This is not an issue with marimbas and xylophones, where the natural sustain time of the wooden bars is short, but vibraphone bars can ring for many seconds after being struck, and this effect is <b>highly</b> <b>desirable</b> in many circumstances. Therefore, the resonators in a vibraphone are usually tuned slightly off-pitch to create a balance between loudness and sustain.|$|E
25|$|He {{spent nine}} {{months on the}} islands, much longer than he had intended. As a Chief Qadi, his skills were <b>highly</b> <b>desirable</b> in the {{formerly}} Buddhist nation that had recently converted to Islam. Half-kidnapped into staying, he became chief judge and married into the royal family of Omar I. He became embroiled in local politics and left when his strict judgments in the laissez-faire island kingdom began to chafe with its rulers. In the Rihla he mentions his dismay at the local women going about with no clothing above the waist, and the locals taking no notice when he complained. From the Maldives, he carried on to Sri Lanka and visited Sri Pada and Tenavaram temple.|$|E
25|$|A foundry facing mold wash is a {{water-based}} paint of amorphous or fine flake graphite. Painting {{the inside of}} a mold with it and letting it dry leaves a fine graphite coat that will ease separation of the object cast after the hot metal has cooled. Graphite lubricants are specialty items for use at very high or very low temperatures, as forging die lubricant, an antiseize agent, a gear lubricant for mining machinery, and to lubricate locks. Having low-grit graphite, or even better no-grit graphite (ultra high purity), is <b>highly</b> <b>desirable.</b> It {{can be used as a}} dry powder, in water or oil, or as colloidal graphite (a permanent suspension in a liquid). An estimate based on USGS graphite consumption statistics indicates that 2,200 tonnes was used in this fashion in 2005.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of the}} {{building}} programme that also cleared the inner city slums, from the 1950s onwards, historic Georgian Dublin came under concerted attack by the Irish Government's development policies. Whole swathes of 18th-century houses were demolished, notably in Fitzwilliam Street and St Stephen's Green, to make way for utilitarian office blocks and government departments. Much of this development was fuelled by property developers and speculators keen {{to cash in on the}} buoyant property markets of the 1960s, late 1970s and 1980s. Many schemes were built by Government supporters with the intention of profitably letting to <b>highly</b> <b>desirable</b> State tenants such as government departments and State agencies. It has been proven that many buildings were approved by government ministers personally connected with the developers involved, often to the detriment of the taxpayer and the proper planning and preservation of Dublin city.|$|E
25|$|In April 1889 Hartness {{moved to}} Springfield, Vermont {{to become the}} {{superintendent}} at the struggling Jones and Lamson (J) Machine Company. He used his creative energy to revitalize the company. Here he found his chance to manufacture the flat-turret lathe, which increased efficiency and productivity and was especially well adapted to the burgeoning automobile industry. The flat turret lathe improved upon earlier turret lathes via greater rigidity, allowing higher precision, higher speeds and feeds, and longer cuts. Hartness also developed an array of highly advanced tooling to complement the lathe, including improved roller bar feed and die head designs. All of these advantages allowed better parts to be made faster, and thus less expensively, which made the lathe <b>highly</b> <b>desirable</b> to manufacturers. This time, Hartness was prepared to defend his interest in his patent. He arranged with J to receive a $100 royalty on each machine.|$|E
25|$|Cervical cancer {{represents}} {{the most common}} cause of cancer-related deaths—more than 3,000 deaths per year—among women in South Africa because of high HIV prevalence, making introduction of the vaccine <b>highly</b> <b>desirable.</b> A Papanicolaou test program was established in 2000 to help screen for cervical cancer, but since this program has not been implemented widely, vaccination would offer more efficient form of prevention. In May 2013 the Minister of Health of South Africa, Aaron Motsoaledi, announced the government would provide free HPV vaccines for girls aged 9 and 10 in the poorest 80% of schools starting in February 2014 and the fifth quintile later on. South Africa will be the first African country with an immunisation schedule that includes vaccines to protect people from HPV infection, but because the effectiveness of the vaccines in women who later become infected with HIV is not yet fully understood, it is difficult to assess how cost-effective the vaccine will be. Negotiations are currently underway for more affordable HPV vaccines since they are up to 10 times more expensive than others already included in the immunization schedule.|$|E
25|$|One popular {{configuration}} for {{the mixing}} tube {{is a large}} bore tube {{with a series of}} internal baffles which create turbulence in the mixture after the injection point, which causes fairly rapid mixing to a homogenous mixture, which may then be continuously analysed by a monitoring instrument before further processing, or may be directly processed and analysed later from the storage cylinder. Continuous analysis allows adjustment of flow rate of the added gases to correct the mixture if it deviates from the specification. Post-analysis makes correction more difficult. Addition of components may be done in sequence or together. Adding them together means that mixing is done once, and this reduces the pressure loss in the intake system. It is important that the gases are thoroughly mixed before analysis as the analysis will then be more reliable. It is also <b>highly</b> <b>desirable</b> to ensure that the intake gases do not vary significantly in oxygen content over time for safety reasons, as the compressor will probably only be safe for a limited oxygen fraction.|$|E
500|$|The <b>highly</b> <b>desirable</b> {{sporting}} {{qualities and}} adaptability {{of the rainbow}} trout to hatchery rearing and new habitats resulted in it being introduced to many {{countries around the world}} by or at the behest of sport fishermen. [...] Many of these introductions have resulted in environmental and ecological problems, as the introduced rainbow trout disrupt local ecosystems and outcompete or eat indigenous fishes. Other introductions to support sport angling in waters either devoid of fish or with seriously depleted native stocks have created world-class fisheries such as in the Firehole River in Yellowstone National Park, and in the Great Lakes.|$|E
500|$|While 30Ω {{cable is}} <b>highly</b> <b>desirable</b> for its power {{handling}} capabilities, {{it has never}} been in commercial production because the large size of inner conductor makes it difficult to manufacture. This is not the case with 77Ω cable. [...] Cable with 75Ω nominal impedance has been in use from an early period in telecommunications for its low loss characteristic. [...] According to Stephen Lampen of Belden Wire & Cable 75Ω was chosen as the nominal impedance rather than 77Ω because it corresponded to a standard AWG wire size for the inner conductor. [...] For coax video cables and interfaces 75Ω is now the near universal standard nominal impedance.|$|E
500|$|Davidson's {{appointment}} in 1906 as rector of the Norfolk parish of Stiffkey with Morston {{came through the}} patronage [...] of the 6th Marquess Townshend, whose family {{had a long history}} of public and political service in the county.. The appointment was probably given in recognition of Davidson's role in reconciling the fierce opposition of the Townshend family to the marquess's proposed marriage to Gladys Sutherst, the daughter of a bankrupt Yorkshire businessman; as curate of St Martin's, Davidson had officiated at the wedding on 8 August 1905. The Stiffkey living was <b>highly</b> <b>desirable,</b> with [...] of glebe land, a large Georgian rectory, and an income in 1906 of £503 per annum, rising during Davidson's incumbency to £800.|$|E
