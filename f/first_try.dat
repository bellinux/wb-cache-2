Oil freezing in the DB 605 engines of the Bf109G-6s made them difficult {{to start in}} the extreme cold of the Russian winter. A captured Soviet airman showed them how pouring fuel into the aircraft's oil sump would thaw the oil and enable the engine to start on the <b>first</b> <b>try.</b> Another solution, also learned from the Soviets, was to ignite fuel under the engine.|$|E

5|$|Eventually Shaw {{was driven}} to {{applying}} for office jobs. In the interim he secured a reader's pass for the British Museum Reading Room (the forerunner of the British Library) and spent most weekdays there, reading and writing. His first attempt at drama, begun in 1878, was a blank-verse satirical piece on a religious theme. It was abandoned unfinished, as was his <b>first</b> <b>try</b> at a novel. His first completed novel, Immaturity (1879), was too grim to appeal to publishers and did not appear until the 1930s. He was employed briefly by the newly formed Edison Telephone Company in 1879–80, and as in Dublin achieved rapid promotion. Nonetheless, when the Edison firm merged with the rival Bell Telephone Company, Shaw chose not to seek {{a place in the}} new organisation. Thereafter he pursued a full-time career as an author.|$|E

Grayman cleared a 2.20meter height on his second attempt, placing behind tenth-place heat finalist Dmytro Dem'yanyuk of the Ukraine, who made the height on his <b>first</b> <b>try,</b> and eleventh-place heat finalist Linus Thörnblad of Sweden, who also made the height on his second attempt, but had fewer overall misses than Grayman. He finished ahead of the three thirteenth-place heat finalists (Italy's Alessandro Talotti, Spain's Javier Bermejo, and Botswana's Kabelo Kgosiemang) and the sixteenth-place heat finalist (Hup Wei Lee of Malaysia) who achieved the same height, but did so in three tries. Overall, Grayman ranked 28th out of 40 competitors and did not advance to finals on August 19.|$|E
5|$|The first {{points of}} the match were scored by New Zealand's Grant Fox from a penalty kick, during which the South African {{supporters}} counted Fox's steps in a divergence from rugby etiquette where normally silence is kept during kicks. South Africa also had a penalty kick at goal, but this was missed by Naas Botha. The <b>first</b> <b>try</b> of the match came from New Zealand's Zinzan Brooke following a quick tap penalty which was converted by Fox.

5|$|After another Falcon punt, the Hokies {{took over}} on offense at their 49-yard line with 4:12 {{remaining}} before halftime. Tech began advancing the ball, and was {{aided by a}} 15-yard penalty against Air Force that pushed the Hokies deep into Falcons territory. Running backs Kevin Jones and Lee Suggs advanced {{the ball on the}} ground with short rushes, and Randall contributed short passes at times, gaining needed first downs when required. Tech advanced the ball inside the Air Force 10-yard line, gaining a first down at the nine-yard line. There, the Air Force defense stiffened. Tech gained four yards on three plays, but was unable to cross the goal line for another touchdown. Tech kicker Warley entered the game to attempt his second field goal try of the game. The 23-yard kick was more successful than his <b>first</b> <b>try,</b> and with 25seconds remaining in the first half, tied the game at 10–10.|$|E

The live episode concluded with David returning home to the fatal scene. He decides to help Kylie and Sarah to conceal Callum's murder. He wraps the body up and puts him down a manhole in their garage. The following episode features the trio plotting to dispose of Callum's body in a public space. An ongoing conversion of the garage in a bedroom extension poses a problem and they need to move quickly, but a series of events ruin their plans. Kylie and David are physically sick when they <b>first</b> <b>try</b> to remove the body from the manhole. They are later interrupted by a visit from the police who investigate Callum's abandoned car. Gail then hires Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas) to cover up the manhole with concrete, unaware Callum is concealed inside.|$|E
5|$|Maamaloa Lolohea {{participated in}} the Beijing Olympics on Tonga's behalf, {{competing}} in weightlifting. Lolohea was born in Kolofo'ou, a district of the capital city Nuku'alofa, and competed in Beijing as a 40-year-old in the men's super-heavyweight class division, which encompasses athletes who weigh more than 105kilograms. Lolohea had not previously competed at any Olympic games. The Tongan athlete competed in his event on August 19, where he faced 14 other athletes. During the snatch phase of the event, Lolohea was given three attempts. He successfully lifted 127kilograms on his first attempt, 135kilograms on his second attempt, and 140kilograms on his third and final attempt. During the clean and jerk phase of the event, he successfully lifted 173kilograms on his <b>first</b> <b>try,</b> but unsuccessfully attempted to lift 185kilograms on his second and third attempts. Because his highest scores were 140 in snatch and 173 in clean and jerk, Lolohea's final and total score was 313kilograms. Of the 13 competitors who finished the event, Maamaloa Lolohea finished last behind Sam Pera, Jr. of the Cook Islands (350kilograms), who in turn finished behind Finland's Antti Everi (366kilograms).
