40|$|Global {{industrialization}} {{was developed}} in response to both consumers and manufacturers demand for lower product prices and availability of goods and services. As a result, products are transported greater distances. Shipping constitutes the majority of costs in the export/import supply chain. Shippers and buyers commonly attempt to offset these costs by maximizing the capacity of ocean freight containers (cube or weight). Boxes (usually constructed of corrugated fiberboard) containing consumer grade products are commonly <b>floor</b> <b>loaded</b> into containers to maximize capacity. Boxes that are not <b>floor</b> <b>loaded</b> {{are likely to be}} unitized on pallets in containers. Beyond maximizing a container with cargo, a defined decision to determine which method of loading is most efficient in regard to cost and time does not exist. For this research, field studies were conducted and questionnaires were distributed to identify the variables that influence efficiency. A method to make an efficient decision was developed by incorporating the variables into a model.

40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of general European rules {{for the design of}} aluminium structures, specific rules for the design of aluminum stressed skin panels are available. These design rules have been used for the optimization of two extrusion products: one for explosions and wind load governing and one for explosions and <b>floor</b> <b>load</b> governing. The optimized extrusions fulfill Class 3 section properties, leading to weight reductions up to 25 % of regularly-used shear panel sections. When the design is based on Class 4 section properties, even more weight reduction may be reached. The typical failure mode of the optimized stressed skin panels depends on the applied height of the hat stiffeners. For sections using relatively high hat stiffeners, failure is introduced by yielding of the heat-affected zone. For this type of cross-section, Eurocode 9 design rules and numerical calculations show very good agreement. For sections using relatively low hat stiffeners, failure is introduced by global buckling. For this type of cross-section, Eurocode 9 gives rather conservative results...|$|E

40|$|Last fall {{as school}} opened, Mr. Sigmund Eiken and the author, were {{presented}} with the opportunity of measuring the stresses in a highway bridge, about to be erected, near Ames Iowa. This structure is located just east of Ames, on Thirteenth Street extended, and spans the Skunk River at this point. [ [...] . ] As previously stated this bridge is located near Ames Iowa, and is a 120 -foot span, 20 -foot roadway, through riveted steel highway bridge, with an 8 -inch concrete floor on steel stringers. A view of the bridge is shown in Fig. 1 and elevation of the truss in Fig. 2. The bridge was designed under the Iowa State Highway Commission Specifications of 1919 and is a T-type, through riveted Pratt truss. In planning the work it was thot {{that it would be}} possible to make a complete study of the action of the bridge during erection. This would have resulted in the measurement of the erection stresses, the stresses due to the weight of the steel and the stresses due to the weight of the concrete floor. Conditions and lack of time caused the scope of the work to be reduced to the measurements of the <b>floor</b> <b>load</b> stresses. These stress measurements were taken on all of the members at the two upper and two lower panel points at the east end of the north truss of the bridge. From these readings we obtained the primary and secondary stresses in the structure, and a comparison of the observed and computed value will be made. In this connection a study of the distribution of stress in the upper chords and end post was also deemed advisable. A complete study of the observed and computed stresses in the transverse bents was also made. In addition the action of the portal members was studied for <b>floor</b> <b>load</b> stresses and stresses due to a horizontal load, applied to represent the action of the wind.

40|$|The authors {{present an}} {{experimental}} study of a suspended floor element connection (sheet steel hangers) employed in the Masonite Flexible Building (MFB) system. The hangers are mounted with screws and are pre-attached to the floor elements at manufacturing. This arrangement makes {{the design of the}} hanger critical with respect to safety and load transfer redundancy, since the screws transfer all the loads, both withdrawal and shear forces can act simultaneously. Tests have been carried out to examine the structural behaviour of the hanger. The two most critical load cases, vertical <b>floor</b> <b>load</b> and horizontal wind suction load, and three different screw joint configurations were investigated. The results indicate that the vertical distance between the screw joint and the upper edge of the rim beam should be increased and that withdrawal forces on the screws should be kept as low as possible. Some suggestions for improving the present design are given and a modified design is proposed to enhance the load-bearing capacity and to improve the overall safety and redundancyGodkänd; 2012; 20121205 (ysko...|$|E

40|$|Wind loads on {{structures}} {{under the}} buffeting {{action of wind}} gusts have traditionally been treated by the ‘‘gust loading factor’ ’ (GLF) method in most major codes and standards around the world. In this scheme, the equivalent-static wind loading used for design {{is equal to the}} mean wind force multiplied by the GLF. Although the traditional GLF method ensures an accurate estimation of the displacement response, it may fall short in providing a reliable estimate of other response components. To overcome this shortcoming, a more consistent procedure for determining design loads on tall structures is proposed. This paper highlights an alternative model, in which the GLF is based on the base bending moment rather than the displacement. The expected extreme base moment is computed by multiplying the mean base moment by the proposed GLF. The base moment is then distributed to each floor in terms of the <b>floor</b> <b>load</b> in a format that is very similar to the one used to distribute the base shear in earthquake engineering practice. In addition, a simple relationship between the proposed base moment GLF and the traditional GLF is derived, which makes it convenient to employ the proposed approach while utilizing the existing background information.

40|$|The {{proposed}} piping layout for the DO upgrade {{will run}} along the south wall of DAB. The cryogenic service pipe runs above {{the upper and lower}} cleanroom roofs and will need to be supported by the roofs beams. Calculations were done to determine the stresses in the I-beams created by the existing and additional loads due to the upgrade. Refer to drawing no. 3823. 115 -ME- 317283 for drawings of the piping layout. Figure 1 shows the 'plan view' portion of this drawing. The weight of the individual lines were calculated in figure 2 assuming a pipe density of O. 28 lbm/in{sup 3 } for stainless steel (0. 12 % C) and a fluid density (assuming LN 2 at 1 atm) of 0. 03 lbm/in{sup 3 }. The weights of the corrugated steel flooring, assembly hall feed cans, support beams, and roof hatch were also included in the analysis. These loads are calculated on pgs. 5 - 6. A <b>floor</b> <b>load</b> of 50 lbf/ft{sup 2 } was also added {{in order to maintain the}} existing <b>floor</b> <b>load</b> limit in addition to the added piping loads. Measurements of the dimensions of the I-beams determined that the nominal sizes of the beams were W 8 x 21 for the lower roof and W 14 x 26 for the upper roof. Pipe lengths were determined from the drawing for each of the lines on pgs. 1 - 2 of the calculations (refer to all piping by line numbers according to figure 2). A total weight was calculated for lines 3 - 9 along the south wall and lines 1 - 2 running along the north wall of the lower cleanroom roof. To simplify the calculations these weights were assumed to be evenly distributed on the 5 I-beam supports of the lower cleanroom roof 2. 5 feet in from the south wall. The stress analysis was done using FrameMac, a 2 -D finite element program for the Macintosh. Beam 3 was not included in the analysis because it is structurally equivalent to beam 1. The program outputted maximum values for shear stress, bending stress, shear force, and moments in each of the beams analyzed. These values were then compared to the allowable stresses as per the specifications and codes stated in the AISC: Manual of Steel Construction. The stresses on the roof beams needed to be determined in a number of different places. The first was in the beam itself which included the flange and web sections. The second place was at the ends of the beams where the flanges were removed to make the perpendicular connections to the other beams on the lower roof. The final point was the framed beam connection which included the bolt analysis. FrameMac calculated stresses only for the beams which included the sections where the flanges were removed to make the end connections. To analyze the connections, the allowable bending and shear stresses were solved for allowable shear and moments. This was done because FrameMac does not have the capability to analyze the dimensions for the bolts and angles used in the connections were known and the program outputted values for reaction forces and moments at the ends of the beams. Multiplying the allowable shear stress for the bolts and angle connections by their respective areas gave the allowable shear force. The allowable moment for the angle connection was calculated by multiplying the section modulus of the angle by the allowable bending stress. These allowable loads are calculated on pgs. 7 - 8. The allowable and maximum calculated stresses by FrameMac are summarized in a table. In conclusion, the cleanroom roofs will be able to safely support the weight of the upgrade cryogenic piping, feed cans, corrugated flooring and a 50 lbf/ft{sup 2 } <b>floor</b> <b>load</b> with the addition of diagonal braces at the ends of beams 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8. The location and size of these diagonal braces are shown in fig. 4. Also, the piping supports and feed cans will all need to be placed directly above the I-beam supports. These supports will consist of unistrut structures that will be detailed and specified separate to this analysis.

40|$|A flooring-system, e. g. a {{floor in}} a building, is excited {{dynamically}} when a person walks across the floor, and resonant excitation might bring structural vibrations to unacceptable levels. Stationary (non-moving) crowds of people might be present on the same floor and they will sense the floor vibrations, but they will also interact dynamically with the {{floor in a}} passive sense, thus altering the dynamic system excited to vibration by the walking person. Consequently, the vibration level of the floor is likely to depend on the presence and size of the stationary crowd. It is also known that different techniques (different parameters calculated from structural response time series) are proposed for assessing floor serviceability. The paper looks into the influence of the stationary crowd of people on the floor response to walking excitation and into the influence of the crowd on different parameters calculated from structural response time series for assessing the serviceability limit state. A numerical approach based on simulation of floor excitation is employed for the investigations, and the paper describes the study assumptions and the findings related to the influence of the presence a stationary crowd on the dynamic model of the flooring-system and on floor serviceability assessments.

40|$|Abstract: The {{aircraft}} loading {{problem is a}} real-world combinatorial optimisation problem highly constrained. Indeed, loading the aircraft so the gross weight {{is less than the}} maximum allowable is not enough. This weight must be distributed to keep the centre of gravity (CG) within specified limits. Moreover, an aircraft has usually several cargo compartments with specific contours and structural limitations such as <b>floor</b> <b>loading,</b> combined load limits and cumulative load limitations. Finally, some shipments are particularly restrictive to transport, like dangerous goods, live animals and perishable goods. This paper is concerned with the incorporation of these latter constraints in a mixed integer linear program for the problem of loading a set of Unit Loading Devices (ULDs) and bulk into an aircraft. Experimental results for real data sets show that the model achieves better balanced solutions in only a few seconds compared to the solution obtained by load masters...|$|R
