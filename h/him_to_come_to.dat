5|$|Alice's sister, Melisende, Fulk's wife, persuaded Fulk {{to allow}} Alice {{to return to}} Antioch in 1135. Alice wanted to tighten the {{relationship}} of the principality and the Byzantine Empire; therefore, she offered Constance's hand to Manuel, a son of the Byzantine Emperor, John II Komnenos. To prevent the Byzantine marriage, Fulk sent his envoy France to Raymond of Poitiers to urge <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> Antioch, which he did, traveling in disguise, because RogerII of Sicily wanted to capture him in southern Italy.|$|E

5|$|After John Sigismund died in 1571, the Diet of Transylvania elected Stephen Báthory voivode (or ruler) in 1571. Stephen {{adopted the}} title of prince of Transylvania after he was elected king of Poland and grand duke of Lithuania in 1575. The childless king decided {{to take charge of}} his nephew's {{education}} and ordered <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> Poland in late 1578. Andrew studied at the Jesuit college in Pułtusk. His fellow-students were mainly young Protestant noblemen from Transylvania or Royal Hungary, but Polish, Lithuanian, German and Italian noblemen and commoners were also chosen to study together with him. He could speak Latin, Italian, Polish and German {{by the end of his}} studies.|$|E
5|$|Baldwin II was {{captured}} in 1123, and the burghers of Antioch sent envoys to Bohemond, urging <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> his principality. Bohemond {{reached the age of}} majority at the age of 16. According to William of Tyre, he made an agreement with William II, Duke of Apulia, stipulating that the one who first died without issue was to will his principality to the other; however, the reliability of William's report is suspect. Alexander of Telese recorded that before leaving for Syria, Bohemond entrusted his Italian domains to the Holy See, but Romuald of Salerno said that he made Alexander, Count of Conversano, the overseer of those lands. Bohemond sailed from Otranto with a fleet of twenty-four ships in September 1126.|$|E

From 1936 to 1939, he spent summers in Poland and academic years at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he worked to establish important results regarding ergodic theory. On 20 August 1939, he sailed for the United States a for the last time with his 17-year-old brother Adam Ulam.

5|$|The crew {{filmed in}} Tokyo from 19 October to 15 December 2007. Flashback scenes were shot in Montreal {{over the course}} of four weeks the {{following}} spring, until 16 May 2008. The team went back to Tokyo twice for additional footage, once before the Montreal session and once when principal photography was complete. Only four persons on the Tokyo set were French; {{the rest of the crew}} was Japanese. Marc Caro worked as the supervisor of set designs in Tokyo. According to Noé, Caro had three months free after finishing Dante 01, his first effort as a solo director, so Noé asked <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> Japan.|$|E
5|$|When the advisor {{system is}} set up at the Xavier Institute, Victor chooses Karma as his advisor and is given the code name Anole.

At first, he is depicted as close friends with fellow student Julian Keller and the {{other students in the}} Hellions, but later becomes closer to his teammates. He is especially close to his mentor Northstar, who helps <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> terms with his sexuality. Anole is deeply affected by Northstar's death, stating that Northstar understood him and was important as a figure he could confide in.|$|E
5|$|Although {{details of}} the siege were not recorded, it {{appeared}} to be bloodless. The Byzantine garrison could not expect any help from the humbled regime of Heraclius. After a siege of four months, Sophronius offered to surrender the city and pay a jizya (tribute), on condition that the caliph came to Jerusalem to sign the pact and accept the surrender. It is said that when Sophronius's terms became known to the Muslims, Shurahbil ibn Hassana, one of the Muslim commanders, suggested that instead of waiting for the caliph to come all the way from Madinah, Khalid ibn Walid should be sent forward as the caliph, as he was very similar in appearance to Umar. The subterfuge did not work. Possibly, Khalid was too famous in Syria, or there may have been Christian Arabs in the city who had visited Madinah and had seen both Umar and Khalid, remembering the differences. Consequently, the Patriarch of Jerusalem refused to negotiate. When Khalid reported the failure of this mission, Abu Ubaidah wrote to caliph Umar about the situation, and invited <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> Jerusalem to accept the surrender of the city.|$|E

5|$|Bahá'u'lláh {{travelled}} from Baghdad to Constantinople between 3 May and 17 August 1863, {{accompanied by}} a large group including family members and followers. During the trip, he was treated with respect in the towns he visited, and when he reached Constantinople, he {{was treated as a}} government guest. Why the Ottoman authorities did not permit his extradition to Persia, but instead invited <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> Constantinople, is unclear. The reason may have been political because Bahá'u'lláh was viewed as a person of influence. After three and a half months in Constantinople, he was ordered to depart for Adrianople. The reason for this further move is also unclear. It may have been due to pressure from the Persian ambassador, combined with Bahá'u'lláh's refusal to work with the Ottoman authorities.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1140s the active {{phase of the}} civil war was over, barring the {{occasional}} outbreak of fighting. Many of the barons were making individual peace agreements with each other to secure their war gains and it increasingly appeared as though the English Church was considering promoting a peace treaty. On Louis VII's return from the Second Crusade in 1149, he became concerned about the growth of Geoffrey's power and the potential threat to his own possessions, especially if Henry could acquire the English crown. In 1150, Geoffrey made Henry the Duke of Normandy and Louis responded by putting forward King Stephen's son Eustace as the rightful heir to the duchy and launching a military campaign to remove Henry from the province. Henry's father advised <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> terms with Louis and peace was made between them in August 1151 after mediation by Bernard of Clairvaux. Under the settlement Henry did homage to Louis for Normandy, accepting Louis as his feudal lord, and gave him the disputed lands of the Norman Vexin; in return, Louis recognised him as duke.|$|E
5|$|Cersei convinces Sansa that to {{save her}} father's life, she must {{write a letter to}} her brother Robb imploring <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> King's Landing and swear fealty to Joffrey. Later, Joffrey and Cersei hold court, where they reward Janos Slynt, the Captain of the City Watch, with a lordship, while Tywin Lannister is named the new Hand of the King. Joffrey also {{relieves}} Ser Barristan Selmy as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard and gives his post to Jaime Lannister. Selmy is offered a castle and land in recognition of his service, but a furious Selmy, regarding the offer as an insult, throws his sword at Joffrey's feet and storms out in disgust. Sansa takes the opportunity to publicly plead for her father's life, and Joffrey agrees to show mercy if Ned will confess to treason and accept him as the rightful king.|$|E

5|$|Early in {{the evening}} of 31 December 1965, Dacko left the Palais de la Renaissance to visit one of his minister's {{plantations}} southwest of the capital. At 22:30WAT (UTC 21:30), Captain Banza gave orders to his officers to begin the coup; one of his subordinates was to subdue the security guard in the presidential palace, while the other was {{to take control of}} Radio-Bangui to prevent communication between Dacko and his followers. Bokassa called Izamo at his headquarters, asking <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> Camp de Roux to sign some papers that needed his immediate attention. Izamo, who was at a New Year's Eve celebration with friends, reluctantly agreed and traveled in his wife's car to the camp. Upon arrival, he was confronted by Banza and Bokassa, who informed him of the coup in progress. After announcing his refusal to support the coup, Izamo was overpowered and locked in a cellar.|$|E
5|$|Leslie is {{convinced}} she can reason with Andy {{if they can}} talk without their lawyers, but Andy will not return her calls. Finally, Ann calls Andy and asks <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> her house. Later that day, he arrives completely naked, having assumed Ann wanted to take him back. A disgusted Ann leaves the house, leaving Leslie and Andy to talk. Andy admits he is suing the town {{in an attempt to}} win Ann back, and she thinks of a different way he can impress her. The next day at city hall, Andy tells Leslie and Scott he will drop the lawsuit if they agree to fill in the pit right away. Scott agrees, unaware it was a trick between Andy and Leslie. The next day the pit is filled in and turned into a lot, and an impressed Ann waves at Andy while the construction work is going on.

5|$|Right {{after signing}} the {{contract}} with the Canadiens, Morenz began to reconsider joining them. Stratford residents, {{as well as his}} senior team, wanted him to stay, and Morenz yielded to the pressure. He wrote a letter in August to Dandurand, explaining that he could not leave Stratford, and included the cheque given to him as a signing bonus. After receiving the letter, Dandurand phoned Morenz and told <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> Montreal to talk in person. In Montreal, Morenz began explaining his reasons for not signing to Dandurand but began crying and could not finish. In response, Dandurand falsely threatened that if Morenz did not join the Canadiens, his professional hockey career would be over. Hearing this, Morenz relented and agreed to report to the Canadiens' training camp later in the year.|$|E
