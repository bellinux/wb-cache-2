50|$|However, {{the typical}} modem in a <b>fax</b> <b>terminal</b> transmits the image data at 14,400 bit/s, {{so if the}} analog data are first {{converted}} to the digital content they represent, only 14,400 bits (plus network overhead of a few bytes) are needed. And since T.30 fax is a half-duplex protocol, the network is only needed for one direction at a time.|$|E
50|$|A special {{protocol}} {{is needed}} for real-time fax over IP (Internet Protocol) since existing fax terminals only supported PSTN connections, where the information flow was generally smooth and uninterrupted, {{as opposed to the}} jittery arrival of IP packets. The trick was {{to come up with a}} protocol that makes the IP network “invisible” to the endpoint fax terminals, which would mean the user of a legacy <b>fax</b> <b>terminal</b> need not know that the fax call was traversing an IP network.|$|E
50|$|In {{the diagram}} above, {{there is a}} sample-rate clock in the <b>fax</b> <b>terminal</b> {{and one in the}} gateway’s modems that is used to trigger the {{sampling}} of the analog line 8,000 times per second. These clocks are usually quite accurate, but in some low-cost terminal adapters (a one or two-line gateway) the PCM clock can be surprisingly inaccurate. If the terminal is sending data to the gateway, and the gateway’s clock is too slow, the buffers (jitter buffers) in the gateway will eventually overflow, causing the transaction to fail. Since the difference is often quite small, this problem occurs on long, detailed fax images giving the clocks more time to cause the jitter buffer in the gateway to either underflow or overflow, which is just the same as missing or duplicated packets.|$|E
50|$|The network {{interconnections}} {{supported by}} T.38 are shown above. The two <b>fax</b> <b>terminals</b> {{on either side}} of the figure communicate using the T.30 fax protocol published by the ITU in 1980. Interconnection of the PSTN with the IP packet network requires a “gateway” between the PSTN and IP networks. PSTN-IP Gateways support TDM voice on the PSTN side and VoIP and FoIP on the packet side.|$|R
50|$|Spoofing {{refers to}} the logic {{implemented}} in the protocol engine of a T.38 relay that modifies the protocol commands and responses on the TDM side to keep network delays on the IP side from causing the transaction to fail. This is done, for example, by padding image lines or deliberately causing a message to be re-transmitted to render network delays transparent to the sending/receiving <b>fax</b> <b>terminals.</b>|$|R
50|$|As {{shown in}} the diagram below, a T.38 gateway is {{composed}} of two primary elements: the fax modems and the T.38 subsystem. The fax modems modulate and demodulate the PCM samples of the analog data, turning the sampled-data representation of the <b>fax</b> <b>terminal’s</b> analog signal to its binary translation, and vice versa. The PSTN network samples the analog signal of a voice or modem signal (it doesn’t know the difference) 8,000 times per second (SPS), and encodes them as 8-bit data bytes. This means 8000 samples-per-second times 8-bits per sample, or 64,000 bits per second (bit/s) to represent the modem (or voice) data in one direction. For both directions the modem transaction consumes 128,000 bits of network bandwidth.|$|R
50|$|The T.38 fax relay {{standard}} was devised in 1998 {{as a way}} to permit faxes to be transported across IP networks between existing Group 3 (G3) <b>fax</b> <b>terminals.</b> T.4 and related fax standards were published by the ITU in 1980, before the rise of the Internet. In the late 1990s, VoIP, or Voice over IP, began to gain ground {{as an alternative to the}} conventional Public Switched Telephone Network. However, because most VoIP systems are optimized (through their use of aggressive lossy bandwidth-saving compression) for voice rather than data calls, conventional fax machines worked poorly or not at all on them due to the network impairments such as delay, jitter, packet loss, and so on. Thus, some way of transmitting fax over IP was needed.|$|R
5000|$|CNCP FacsRoute was a Canadian {{telecommunications}} network that delivered fax documents, circa 1988. Initially, a store & forward fax service was provided over an X.25 data network, and {{presented to the}} market with all the traditional [...] "value added" [...] arguments; it peaked at $2 million revenue and 2,000 subscribers. A year later the regulator allowed real time FacsRoute, which attracted $40 million and 50,000 subscribers of the 300,000 <b>fax</b> <b>terminals</b> then in Canada, doing so in 9 months. Real time FacsRoute was provided over a 64kbit/s bypass GSTN via [...] "voice busters" [...] which cut the dialed connection after a cumulative 70 seconds of speech per call: a remarkably [...] "value subtracted" [...] way of bringing a transcontinental 64kbit/s service to market, but a 20-fold increase in business over the S&F FacsRoute Plus.|$|R
50|$|In {{the context}} of telecommunications, a {{terminal}} is a device which ends a telecommunications link and is {{the point at which}} a signal enters and/or leaves a network. Examples of equipment containing network terminations are telephones, <b>fax</b> machines, computer <b>terminals</b> and network devices, printers and workstations.|$|R

The business unit provides a multifold portfolio in areas such as consumer fax (inventor of the Phonefax) as well as professional <b>faxes,</b> printers, multifunction <b>terminals,</b> software solutions for document management and communication, and also imaging (one of the Europeans leaders in digital photoframes).Its headquarters are in France, on Sagemcom Osny campus.|$|R
40|$|The 34700 is a compact, high-efficiency {{power supply}} with on-chip power MOSFETs that {{features}} three step-down switching regulators and one low dropout linear regulator. The switching regulators utilize {{voltage mode control}} with external compensation, allowing flexibility in optimizing {{the performance of the}} 34700 for a given application. The 34700 is ideal for space constrained applications where multiple power rails are required and simplicity of design and implementation of the power supply is necessary. Over-voltage, under-voltage, over-current, and over-temperature protection features ensure robust and reliable operation. Fixed switching frequency, internal soft-start, and internal power MOSFETs enable rapid power supply design and development.
