5|$|A <b>death</b> <b>certificate</b> {{discovered}} in 2009 shows that Beato {{was born in}} Venice in 1832 and died on 29 January 1909 in Florence. The <b>death</b> <b>certificate</b> also indicates {{that he was a}} British subject and a bachelor. It is likely that early in his life Beato and his family moved to Corfu, at the time part of the British protectorate of the Ionian Islands, and so Beato was a British subject.|$|E

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Electronic death {{certification}} {{was established}} in France in 2007. A methodology based on intrinsic characteristics of <b>death</b> <b>certificates</b> was designed to compare the quality of electronic versus paper <b>death</b> <b>certificates.</b> METHODS: All <b>death</b> <b>certificates</b> from the 2010 French mortality database were included. Three specific quality indicators were considered: (i) amount of information, measured {{by the number of}} causes of death coded on the death certificate; (ii) intrinsic consistency, explored by application of the International Classification of Disease (ICD) General Principle, using an international automatic coding system (Iris); (iii) imprecision, measured by proportion of <b>death</b> <b>certificates</b> where the selected underlying cause of death was imprecise. Multivariate models were considered: a truncated Poisson model for indicator (i) and binomial models for indicators (ii) and (iii). Adjustment variables were age, gender, and cause, place, and region of death. RESULTS: 533, 977 <b>death</b> <b>certificates</b> were analyzed. After adjustment, electronic <b>death</b> <b>certificates</b> contained 19 % [17 %- 20 %] more codes than paper <b>death</b> <b>certificates</b> for people deceased under 65 years, and 12 % [11 %- 13 %] more codes for people deceased over 65 years. Regarding deceased under and over 65 respectively, the ICD General Principle could be applied 2 % [0 %- 4 %] and 6 % [5 %- 7 %] more to electronic than to paper <b>death</b> <b>certificates.</b> The proportion of imprecise <b>death</b> <b>certificates</b> was 51 % [46 %- 56 %] lower for electronic than for paper <b>death</b> <b>certificates.</b> CONCLUSION: The method proposed to evaluate the quality of <b>death</b> <b>certificates</b> is easily reproducible in countries using an automatic coding system. According to our criteria, electronic <b>death</b> <b>certificates</b> are better completed than paper <b>death</b> <b>certificates.</b> The transition to electronic <b>death</b> <b>certificates</b> is positive in many aspects and should be promoted...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE. To {{determine}} the accuracy {{and frequency of}} reporting tuberculosis as either the contributing or underlying cause of <b>death</b> on <b>death</b> <b>certificates</b> in New York City during 1992. METHODS. <b>Death</b> <b>certificates</b> from 1992 that listed tuberculosis were matched with the New York City tuberculosis registry. For those persons who had tuberculosis listed {{as a cause of}} death, but who were not listed in the registry, medical records were reviewed. The frequency of reporting tuberculosis on <b>death</b> <b>certificates</b> in patients who died with active tuberculosis was evaluated {{in the second part of}} this study. <b>Death</b> <b>certificates</b> of patients with active tuberculosis (persons who died within six months of starting anti-tuberculosis medications) in 1992 were reviewed. RESULTS. Tuberculosis was listed on 635 death certificates; 377 (59 %) were confirmed cases based on registry data. Reviews of medical records were possible for 230 (89 %) of the remaining 258 patients and confirmed only two additional tuberculosis cases. Of 310 persons who died with active tuberculosis in 1992 (second part of the study), only 104 (34 %) had tuberculosis listed on their <b>death</b> <b>certificates.</b> CONCLUSIONS. In New York City, a diagnosis of tuberculosis on <b>death</b> <b>certificates</b> is an inaccurate measure of tuberculosis burden...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{inaccuracy}} {{of death}} certification {{can lead to}} the misallocation of resources in health care programs and research. We evaluated the rate of errors in the completion of <b>death</b> <b>certificates</b> among medical residents from various specialties, before and after an educational intervention which was designed to improve the accuracy in the certification of the cause of death. Methods A 90 -min seminar was delivered to seven mixed groups of medical trainees (n = 166) from several health care institutions in Spain. Physicians were asked to read and anonymously complete a same case-scenario of death certification before and after the seminar. We compared the rates of errors and the impact of the educational intervention before and after the seminar. Results A total of 332 <b>death</b> <b>certificates</b> (166 completed before and 166 completed after the intervention) were audited. <b>Death</b> <b>certificates</b> were completed with errors by 71. 1 % of the physicians before the educational intervention. Following the seminar, the proportion of <b>death</b> <b>certificates</b> with errors decreased to 9 % (p Conclusion Major errors in the completion of the correct cause of <b>death</b> on <b>death</b> <b>certificates</b> are common among medical residents.

5|$|Chopin's {{disease and}} the cause of his death have since been a matter of discussion. His <b>death</b> <b>certificate</b> gave the cause as tuberculosis, and his physician, Jean Cruveilhier, was then the leading French {{authority}} on this disease. Other possibilities have been advanced including cystic fibrosis, cirrhosis and alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency. In 2017, an autopsy was performed on Chopin's preserved heart, which confirmed that a rare case of pericarditis, caused by complications from chronic tuberculosis, was the likely cause of his death.|$|E

It has also been suggested that Poe's death might have resulted from suicide related to depression. In 1848, he nearly died from an overdose of laudanum, readily available as a tranquilizer and pain killer.

5|$|As Lucan's {{bankruptcy}} proceeded, in August 1975 his creditors {{were informed}} that the missing earl had unsecured debts of £45,000 and preferential liabilities for £1,326.

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE [...] The aim was {{to report}} {{on the extent to which}} <b>death</b> <b>certificates</b> which specify that death {{occurred}} in hospital can be matched and linked with routine hospital inpatient information systems. DESIGN [...] The study involved linkage of hospital records which specified that death occurred in hospital to corresponding death certificates; and linkage of <b>death</b> <b>certificates</b> which specified that death occurred in hospital to corresponding hospital records. SETTING [...] Six health districts in southern England covered by medical record linkage. SUBJECTS [...] Records were examined of patients aged 65 years and over, which specified that death occurred in hospital between 1979 and 1985. MAIN RESULTS [...] 98. 2 % of hospital record abstracts which specified that death occurred in hospital were linked by our standard computer-based techniques to <b>death</b> <b>certificates.</b> Conversely, however, only 94. 4 % of <b>death</b> <b>certificates</b> which specified that death occurred in hospital could be linked to the abstracts of corresponding hospital inpatient records. A major factor contributing to the latter failures may be a difference of definition of what constitutes a death "following hospital admission" in patients who die shortly after arrival at hospital. CONCLUSIONS [...] Linkage of hospital records to <b>death</b> <b>certificates</b> is both feasible and desirable. Error rates are generally small; but hospital inpatient record abstracts corresponding to <b>death</b> <b>certificates</b> for <b>deaths</b> in hospital may not invariably exist when death occurs shortly after the arrival of the patient at hospital...|$|R
