A large share of the energy-efficiency potential of the stock is already realized through standard renovation. The potential for further reductions through more advanced and/or more frequent renovation, compared to current practice, is surprisingly limited. However, extensive use of heat pumps and photovoltaics will give large additional future energy savings. Finally, user behaviour is highly important. A strong future rebound effect is expected as the <b>dwelling</b> <b>stock</b> becomes more energy efficient.

40|$|The study {{compares the}} total number of {{dwellings}} in Newcastle-upon-Tyne according to the 1991 Census and the local authority Housing Department. This is to assess whether the explanation of the differences at the local scale, can contribute to the understanding of Census underenumeration at the national scale. The significance of dwelling figures is established by reference to Census underenumeration, the Estimating with Confidence (EwC) project, housing need and government finance. The study also draws on literature about GIS in local government in order to highlight the need for the local analysis of dwelling figures for research and policy purposes, and to demonstrate the benefits of integrating Census and local authority data. The study describes the processes of data collection, integration and interpretation from both the Census and local authority sources. Total residential <b>dwellings,</b> occupied council <b>stock</b> and total vacant dwellings from both sources are compared and the differences are standardised. The standardised differences are then mapped (using z- scores) at the District scale and at Housing Area, Housing Neighbourhood, Ward and ED resolutions. Areas with large differences above or below the expected differences are highlighted and their characteristics are noted. The observed differences are then correlated with some of the characteristic of the areas in the form of dwelling structure, tenure, imputed residents and accommodation not used as main residence. These characteristics are then compared with those of areas with EwC non-response adjustment figures. The correlation analysis is carried out at two scales with the same resolution. This includes all the EDs in the City, then focuses on the EDs within Benwell and Scotswood Wards. This is to highlight the significant associations, specific to these Wards. Benwell and Scotswood are selected because of their patterns of vacancy differences, which are found to be in contrast to the city-wide pattern. The Census excess of vacancies in these Wards are also found to be greater than those in other Wards and greater (more than 1. 4 standard deviations) than the city-wide expected average difference. The correlation analysis at the City scale finds that EDs with higher Census vacancy counts than the local authority data, share similar characteristics with EDs containing high EwC non-response adjustment figures. These are EDs with greater number of flats in residential buildings and local authority rented dwellings. In Benwell and Scotswood this pattern changes to greater number of flats in commercial buildings, converted flats and privately rented dwellings. The last stage of the study explains the differences in the selected variables using the individual property records (ED profiles). The study finds that at District (City) scale, the Census counts of total residential dwellings and occupied council stock are slightly higher than those from the local authority data. The Census vacancy figures however, are significantly less than local authority figures, mainly due to definitional differences and data collection methods used. The opposite pattern of higher Census vacancy figures is observed in Benwell and Scotswood. The reason for this is found to be due to vacant dwellings awaiting demolition, which were included in the 1991 Census vacancy figures but not in the local authority datasets. An example of how different definitions and data collection methods caused the observed differences. The study illustrates that the comparison of local authority and Census data can highlight areas with large differences (in vacant, occupied council stock or total residential dwelling counts) through data standardisation. The characteristics of these areas are found to be similar to those of areas reported as difficult to enumerate, in the national studies of Census underenumeration.

40|$|More {{public housing}} funds {{are needed to}} unleash its potential, argue ROWLAND ATKINSON and KEITH JACOBS ONE of the early successes of the Blair {{government}} was to make clear the need for social investment to promote economic outcomes. Productivity, labour market activity, creativity and employment provided effective headlines for policies around crime, housing, neighbourhood quality, education and health. This also meant that earlier political wisdom about where investment should be directed was challenged, undermining laissez-faire approaches and building consensus around the value of enhancing opportunities for deprived groups while seeing this as a broader mission of national renewal. This kind of political drive has already been subtly {{picked up by the}} Rudd government, with talk of social inclusion, significant infrastructure goals and social investment targets for a new round of special-purpose payments. One area where this thinking needs application is in housing, and in public housing in particular. Underinvestment by Commonwealth and state governments has left state housing authorities managing declining stock levels and looking after the most impoverished and difficult tenants. But the deeper truth is perhaps that no government, of any political stripe, sees electoral, social or economic imperatives in greater spending on public housing. One of the hallmarks of the past feel-good decade has been the growth in private housing wealth, a denial of the problems of lower-income Australians and a shameless system of subsidies directed at those on higher incomes. With housing equity looking shakier in some quarters and new-found compassion marking the tone of Canberra pronouncements, it is time to revisit these issues. It has not been unusual for political commentators to portray public housing as a reason for poverty, disadvantage and anti-social behaviour. Usually the argument runs that public housing reinforces a “culture of welfare dependency” for those who live there, and that resources would be better spent encouraging tenants who are economically active to leave. This workhouse logic has left the system badly fraying at the seams, and with only 4 per cent of Australian households in the sector, a political backwater with few champions. Housing industry lobbyists have highlighted affordability problems, encouraging the government to relax planning controls and provide generous subsidies for first-time buyers. This group is unsurprisingly hostile to arguments to increase the supply of public housing. And the media often feature public housing tenants in a bad light, reinforcing the message that public housing estates are places to avoid. The criticism of public housing has made it difficult for those who highlight the potential of the sector to look after those who cannot enter the private market and provide a stepping stone for people to improved economic, educational and health opportunities. By investing in a revitalised and vibrant public housing sector, secure tenants would be better able to keep their children in the same school over the long haul and there would be less reliance on health services, creating more work-ready and socially engaged people. There is nothing inevitable about public housing’s negative status or its association with poverty and failure. Rather, the problems that feature in public housing locations are symptomatic of the effects of underinvestment, targeted allocation rules (creating neighbourhoods with high levels of social need) and a steady decline in <b>dwellings</b> as <b>stock</b> is sold, making it harder to create more socially diverse and sustainable communities of choice, rather than dependence. Australian Centre for Economic Studies research shows that funding for public housing fell by 11 per cent between 1996 - 97 and 2004 - 05, 19 per cent in per head terms. In 2006 - 07, Commonwealth expenditure amounted to $ 280 billion, of which only $ 1. 1 billion was used to support public housing. Between 1996 and 2006, about 23, 000 houses were lost to the sector. The number of houses now amounts to 306, 696. This suggests it is time for a wake-up call and a strong commitment by government to act more effectively. Up until the 1980 s, public housing was available to a greater mix of tenants but today most tenants are those with pressing needs, for example, households reliant on welfare and those with serious health problems. The 2006 census showed that only 26 % of public housing tenants eligible for work were in full or part-time work. Policies now in place negate any attempts by housing authorities to create more socially mixed communities, and reinforce the perception that public housing has been a failure. The crux {{of the problem is that}} public housing has been denied sufficient funds. Its plight is all the more disturbing when we consider the generous cash subsidies available to first-time home owners and tax relief for private landlords. Increasing the supply of public housing would enable authorities to accommodate more people who are economically active and prevent the need to cater for those in the highest need. The real revolution here is that such collective provision could be one of the most effective antidotes to the housing crisis - stimulating the building sector, providing homes for low to moderate-income families and offering a perpetual investment available to future generations. This forces a confrontation with the pervading value system of our society, that many would prefer to accrue and take any rewards for themselves, rather than to see such infrastructure being generated. Any suggestion of additional public housing investment will be attacked from many quarters, especially by those who wish to protect the subsidies for existing owner-occupiers, and by industry lobbyists who seek to maximise the profit of developers they represent. The case for additional public housing investment is compelling because financial arrangements now not only compound the problems faced by low-income households, they impede policy initiatives to tackle social exclusion, itself a significant brake on economic growth. • Rowland Atkinson and Keith Jacobs are researchers at the housing and community research unit, University of Tasmania, and authors of Public Housing in Australia: Stigma, Home and Opportunity.

40|$|The European Union has set ambitious {{targets for}} 2020 {{known as the}} 20 / 20 / 20 targets aiming to reduce {{greenhouse}} gas emissions by 20 %, increase the share of renewables to 20 % and improve energy efficiency by 20 %. Buildings represents 40 % of the final energy use in the EU and has a large potential for contributing to these targets by implementing energy efficiency measures. Refurbishment of aging buildings together {{with the implementation of}} better solutions for energy performance becomes important. Often policy roadmaps use detailed information on energy and emission intensities, but lacks detailed information about the building stock itself. Renovation rates are often assumed to be easily increased by policy makers, but studies have shown that renovation rates are highly dependent on stock composition. As building stocks consists of different building types and age cohorts the potential for improved energy efficiency will vary due to changing technologies and building codes in the past. The energy characteristics and dynamics of the national <b>dwelling</b> <b>stock</b> of Norway has been investigated in previous studies. However, {{it is likely that the}} <b>dwelling</b> <b>stock</b> on a local scale could be of a different nature than the national average and that the local <b>dwelling</b> <b>stock</b> energy characteristics could differ from the national average. A regionalization of a <b>dwelling</b> <b>stock</b> model to develop specialized regionalized energy policies could prove to be of importance to local legislators, businesses and stakeholders. This MSc thesis models the energy use from the Norwegian city of Trondheim s <b>dwelling</b> <b>stock</b> by using a regionalized segmented dynamic stock model. Statistical data has been gathered for the period of 1800 to present day, combined with population forecasts and implemented into the model. A detailed energy analysis has been run on Trondheim s <b>dwelling</b> <b>stock</b> based on stock composition and corresponding parameters for sub segments, archetypes and cohorts such as average heated floor area, energy intensities, energy mix and system efficiencies. Four possible future scenarios in addition to the business as usual scenario has been analyzed. The results suggest that the composition of Trondheim s <b>dwelling</b> <b>stock</b> differs from the national stock. The energy characteristics has also been shown to differ from the national average. Trondheim s <b>dwelling</b> <b>stock</b> has been shown to have a larger share of Multi Family Houses than the national average. Additionally, the stock has a larger share of older dwellings. A future <b>dwelling</b> <b>stock</b> growth is expected. The energy analysis has shown that Trondheim s energy mix differs from the national average with a higher share of district heating. Historically, Trondheim s energy intensity has also been lower than the national average. Through the scenario analysis a roadmap giving possible future energy characteristics for Trondheim s <b>dwelling</b> <b>stock</b> has been created. Baseline results suggests that even though the <b>dwelling</b> <b>stock</b> is expected to increase the delivered energy to the system is expected to experience only minor growth. However, the potential for future energy savings is large. In the most optimistic scenario a 37 % decrease of delivered energy in 2050 compared to present day is expected. Somewhat surprisingly it has been shown that the potential for energy efficiency measures through advanced and more frequent renovation is limited. This is due to that much of the possible gains will be reached anyway before 2050 through natural standard renovation. However, an extensive policy of local energy use by using HPs and PVs has proven to be very effective and represents the largest opportunity for energy savings towards 2050. Moreover, it has been shown that there is a large potential to shift the current energy mix in the city to a larger share of district heating in 2050. This could represent an opportunity to free surplus electricity that can then be used to replace more carbon intensive energy carriers in other sectors. For instance, by powering a future electrical vehicle park with electricity. It has been shown that it will also be important in Trondheim as found for the whole country by Sandberg et al. (2017) to make efforts to limit the expected rebound effect. As the theoretical estimated energy need intensity decrease in the stock a change in user behavior is expected to counteract the improved energy efficiency through a higher energy use. This will limit the potential for energy savings in the stock and policies should be created to minimize this change in user behavior. The findings suggest that regionalized <b>dwelling</b> <b>stock</b> models will indeed be of great use for local policy makers. It has given much needed insight into Trondheim s <b>dwelling</b> <b>stock</b> composition. The model s ability to assess the stock s energy mix on a per type, cohort and archetype level has proven to be of key use when assessing the potential for district heating in Trondheim. Through a scenario based energy analysis of a segmented dynamic <b>dwelling</b> <b>stock</b> model different possible energy policies can be compared and tested against each other on a long-term scale...|$|E

The true answer should be though, {{that we do not}} know it: {{the average age of the}} actual housing stock- at least in most ‘old ’ EU countries- being too young for useful longitudinal ex post analyses. Looking at the actual rate of new construction of approximately 1 % pro annum the average needed lifespan of the existing <b>dwelling</b> <b>stock</b> should be at least 1 century. Looking at the actual replacement rate of less than 0, 25 % pro annum the average needed lifespan of the existing Dutch <b>dwelling</b> <b>stock</b> should be at least 4 centuries! Recent research shows that, from a sustainable viewpoint, life cycle extension of existing dwellings is a better choice than replacement by new construction (de Jonge, 2005; Klunder, 2005). However, when we look at recent schemes proposed by Dutch housing associations we can see a sharp increase in numbers of less than 50 years old dwellings to be demolished. What is happening and how can we assess this increase. Unlike the life span of human beings, the life span of dwellings can technically be endless; prolongation is subject to decisions of the owner. The knowledge about this decision process and th...|$|E
