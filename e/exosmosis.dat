50|$|Plasmolysis only {{occurs in}} extreme {{conditions}} and rarely happens in nature. It is induced {{in the laboratory}} by immersing cells in strong saline or sugar (sucrose) solutions to cause <b>exosmosis,</b> often using Elodea plants or onion epidermal cells, which have colored cell sap so that the process is clearly visible. Methylene blue {{can be used to}} stain plant cells.|$|E
5000|$|If a {{plant cell}} {{is placed in}} a {{hypertonic}} solution, the plant cell loses water and hence turgor pressure by plasmolysis: pressure decreases {{to the point where}} the protoplasm of the cell peels away from the cell wall, leaving gaps between the cell wall and the membrane and making the plant cell shrink and crumple. A continued decrease in pressure eventually leads to cytorrhysis - the complete collapse of the cell wall. Plants with cells in this condition wilt. After plasmolysis the gap between the cell wall and the cell membrane in a plant cell is filled with hypertonic solution. This is because as the solution surrounding the cell is hypertonic, <b>exosmosis</b> takes place and the space between the cell wall and cytoplasm is filled with solutes, as most of the water drains away and hence the concentration inside the cell becomes more hypertonic. There are some mechanisms in plants to prevent excess water loss in the same way as excess water gain. Plasmolysis can be reversed if the cell is placed in a hypotonic solution. Stomata help keep water in the plant so it does not dry out. Wax also keeps water in the plant. The equivalent process in animal cells is called crenation. The liquid content of the cell leaks out due to <b>exosmosis.</b> The cell collapses, and the cell membrane pulls away from the cell wall (in plants). Most animal cells consist of only a phospholipid bilayer (plasma membrane) and not a cell wall, therefore shrinking up under such conditions.|$|E

In this paper, a joint element and the load-sharing ratio of the consolidation layer are introduced to investigate the joint load-bearing characteristics of the steel lining and the consolidation layer and to determine a suitable consolidation layer thickness; a coupling method for simulating the hydromechanical interaction of the reinforced concrete lining is adopted to investigate the effect of internal water <b>exosmosis</b> on the seepage field at {{the collapse}} zone and to determine the external water pressure on the steel lining. In the case of a steel-lined pressure diversion tunnel, a numerical simulation is implemented to analyse the effect of the thickness of the consolidation layer and the distribution of the seepage field under the influence of internal water <b>exosmosis.</b> The results show that a 10 m thick consolidation layer and the adopted antiseepage measures ensure the stability of the steel lining at the collapse zone under internal and external water pressure. These research results provide a reference for the design of treatment measures for large-scale collapses in steel-lined pressure tunnels...|$|E
40|$|Investigations of the osmotic {{properties}} of oyster eggs by a diffraction method for measuring volumes {{have led to}} the following conclusions: 1. The product of cell volume and osmotic pressure is approximately constant, if allowance is made for osmotically inactive cell contents (law of Boyle-van't Hoff). The space occupied by osmotically inactive averages 44 per cent of cell volume. 2. Volume changes over a wide range of pressures are reversible, indicating that the semipermeability of the cell during such changes remains intact. 3. The kinetics of endosmosis and of <b>exosmosis</b> are described by the equation, See PDF for Equation, where dV is rate of volume change; S, surface area of cell, (P-Pe), the difference in osmotic pressure between cell interior and medium, and K, the permeability of the cell to water. 4. Permeability to water during endosmosis is 0. 6 µ 3 of water per minute, per square micron of cell surface, per atmosphere of pressure. The value of permeability for <b>exosmosis</b> is closely the same; in this respect the egg cell of the oyster appears to be a more perfect osmometer than the other marine cells which have been studied. Permeability to water computed by the equation given above is in good agreement with computations by the entirely different method devised by Jacobs. 5. Permeability to diethylene glycol averages 27. 2, and to glycerol 20. 7. These values express the number of mols x 10 – 15 which enter per minute through each square micron of cell surface at a concentration difference of 1 mol per liter and a temperature of 22. 5 °C. 6. Values for permeability to water and to the solutes tested are considerably higher for the oyster egg than for other forms of marine eggs previously examined. 7. The oyster egg because of its high degree of permeability is a natural osmometer particularly suitable {{for the study of the}} less readily penetrating solutes...|$|E
40|$|Using unfertilized eggs of Arbacia punctulata {{as natural}} osmometers an attempt {{has been made}} to account for the course of {{swelling}} and shrinking of these cells in anisotonic solutions by means of the laws governing osmosis and diffusion. The method employed has been to compute permeability of the cell to water, as measured by the rate of volume change per unit of cell surface per unit of osmotic pressure outstanding between the cell and its medium. Permeability to water as here defined and as somewhat differently defined by Northrop is approximately constant during swelling and shrinking, at least for the first several minutes of these processes. Permeability is found to be independent of the osmotic pressure of the solution in which cells are swelling. Water is found to leave cells more readily than it enters, that is, permeability is greater during <b>exosmosis</b> than during endosmosis...|$|E
40|$|It {{was shown}} that the {{inhibitor}} of tubulin protein polymerization, oryzalin (10 µM) evoked structural changes in the principal part of microtubules in cells of wheat seedling roots and brought about an increase in electrolyte <b>exosmosis</b> from the root tissue {{as well as an}} increase in cell wall lectin activity while soluble lectin activity and soluble protein content were decreased. After cold hardening of the seedlings at + 3 °C for 7 days an increase of the spatial microtubule aggregation and a decrease of the oryzalin effect were noted. Exogenous CaCl 2 (1 mM) and the antagonist of the Ca 2 +-calmodulin complex, chlorpromazin (250 µM) influenced, possibly because of changes in the phosphorylation of proteins interacting with the microtubules and the membraneotrope action of these substances. It is assumed that the change of cytoskeleton stability brought about by the influence of the external stimuli is linked to the functioning of the cell signaling system, thus defining the biochemical and the physiological reactions of the plants...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to {{evaluate}} the contribution of Julio-César Santoyo, a contemporary Spanish theoretician, {{to the development of}} translation studies. We have provided an overall summary of his work together with an overview of its reception. The analysis of individual works and theoretical knowledge is preceded by an overview of theoretical concepts applied in the 20 th century Spain, which serves as an outline of the context and environment which influences this theoretician. We have focused on all three aspects of his work, i. e. theory, criticism and history of translation. Our task was to provide a complete insight into his thinking within these disciplines. Our analysis is based not only on his book publications but also on numerous specialized articles which he has been continuously publishing throughout his entire academic career. Within the translation theory field we have focused on particular issues Santoyo deals with in his works, mainly on defining the meaning, purpose and position of translation in miscellaneous areas of human knowledge and on topics closely linked with translation. Let us mention for example the endosmosis and <b>exosmosis</b> translation concept, limits of translation, transient nature of translation or reflections upon the role of translation in literature as well as upon [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Significant {{genotypic}} {{difference in}} response to arsenate toxicity in rice (Oryza sativa) was investigated in root elongation, arsenate uptake kinetics, physiological and biochemical response and arsenic (As) speciation. Uptake kinetics data showed that P-deprived genotype 94 D- 54 had a little higher As uptake than P-deprived 94 D- 64, but {{the difference was not}} large enough to cause acute toxicity in P-deprived 94 D- 54. There was no difference in tissue P concentrations between the two genotypes under P deficient conditions. In addition, arsenic speciation in plant tissues (using high performance liquid chromatographyinductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry) was not different between P pretreatments and between genotypes. P-deprived genotype 94 D- 54 suffered much higher stress induced by arsenate toxicity than P-deprived genotype 94 D- 64, in terms of lipid peroxidation, tissue H 2 O 2 concentrations and <b>exosmosis</b> of K, P and As. However, P-deprived 94 D- 54 also had higher overproduction of enzymatic antioxidants (with higher GPX, SOD, CAT) and NPT (non-protein thiols) than P-deprived 94 D- 64. It appeared that, the higher sensitivity of P-deprived 94 D- 54 to arsenate toxicity might cause the overproduction of NPT, thus leading to the depletion of GSH and to the accumulation of H 2 O 2. The differential sensitivity of the two genotypes has major implications for breeding rice for As affected paddy soil...|$|E
40|$|The chitosan-based coating with {{antimicrobial}} agent {{has been developed}} recently to control the decay of fruits. However, its fresh keeping and antimicrobial mechanism is still not very clear. The preservation mechanism of chitosan coating with cinnamon oil for fruits storage is investigated in this paper. Results in the atomic force microscopy sensor images show that many micropores exist in the chitosan coating film. The roughness of coating film {{is affected by the}} concentration of chitosan. The antifungal activity of cinnamon oil should be mainly due to its main consistent trans-cinnamaldehyde, which is proportional to the trans-cinnamaldehyde concentration and improves with increasing the attachment time of oil. The <b>exosmosis</b> ratios of Penicillium citrinum and Aspergillus flavus could be enhanced by increasing the concentration of cinnamon oil. Morphological observation indicates that, compared to the normal cell, the wizened mycelium of A. flavus is observed around the inhibition zone, and the growth of spores is also inhibited. Moreover, the analysis of gas sensors indicate that the chitosan-oil coating could decrease the level of O 2 and increase the level of CO 2 in the package of cherry fruits, which also control the fruit decay. These results indicate that its preservation mechanism might be partly due to the micropores structure of coating film as a barrier for gas and a carrier for oil, and partly due to the activity of cinnamon oil on the cell disruption...|$|E
40|$|The {{number of}} {{necrotic}} spots arising on leaves of Nicotiana glutinosa after inoculation with tobacco mosaic virus {{was less than}} in controls without additives, if the water in which the leaves floated hadβ-indoleacetic acid (IAA),α-naphthylacetic acid (NAA) or 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 -D) in correct concentrations, added 16 h before (IAA also after) inoculation. This reaction occurred always in weak light but not always in strong light. D-tryptophan, but not DL and L isomers, caused a similar effect in only half the tests. In vitro IAA did not inactivate the virus. IAA, NAA and 2, 4 -D all decreased the osmotic pressure of the leaf sap of plants in weak light. IAA also decreased the conductivity of the sap of floating leaves by <b>exosmosis.</b> Leaves of plants in strong light had higher osmotic pressure, but if both leaf types were floated on water, the difference in osmotic pressure disappeared. Yet water absorption seemed not to be {{directly related to the}} decrease in osmotic pressure with IAA. A mixture of Ca (NO 3) 2, KNO 3 and MgS 0 4 increased osmotic pressure and number of necrotic spots, although less with IAA than without it. Ca 2 + increased and K + and Mg 2 + decreased number of spots. Perhaps phosphate-buffer enhanced auxin production, so masking the influence of the applied IAA. Probably IAA stimulated synthesis of enzymes and specific nucleic acid, so using up compounds needed for virus synthesis...|$|E
40|$|These {{experiments}} {{serve to}} show that neutral salts in amounts considerably below those commonly employed in culture solutions may be very injurious to pollen. It has been found, for example, that NaCl, {{one of the least}} toxic salts tried, excepting CaCl 2, added to a sucrose solution in a concentration of 0. 0002 M, or about 11 parts per million, reduces the growth of sweet pea pollen tubes 15 per cent. When it is considered that MgCl 2 and BaCl 2 are about fifteen times as toxic as NaCl it becomes evident that the susceptibility of pollen tubes to injury by these substances amounts virtually to hypersensitiveness. On the other hand calcium salts in concentrations ranging from 0. 02 to 0. 002 M markedly enhance the growth of sweet pea pollen tubes. MgCl 2 has a similar action in the case of Nicotiana. Calcium, moreover, exerts a strong protective action {{in the presence of the}} injurious monovalent cations Na and K. So far as can be determined by microchemical means these salts do not alter the wall of the pollen tube; presumably, their effect is on the protoplast itself. In the light of recent experimentation (Osterhout) with other forms better adapted to precise investigation of these phenomena it seems probable that the explanation of the facts presented here lies in changes brought about in the permeability of the cells. Since several gaps exist in our evidence, however, conclusions drawn at this time must necessarily be provisional. The highly injurious action manifested by the cations of several of the salts used indicates that they penetrate the protoplast very rapidly. Possibly in pure sucrose cultures, <b>exosmosis</b> is a limiting factor in pollen tube growth. The addition of salts of calcium or magnesium may favor development by retarding or preventing this outward diffusion. The protective effect of calcium in the presence of the toxic cations K and Na is best interpreted on the assumption that the entry of these latter into the protoplast is retarded by the calcium. The mode by which hydrogen ion concentration affects pollen tube growth is largely a matter of speculation. It has previously been been shown by Brink that the time relations of the growth process simulate those of an autocatalytic reaction. It has been demonstrated also that elongation of the tubes in artificial media is related to the digestion of the reserve food materials contributed by the pollen grain. In the case of the sweet pea these stored substances are largely fats and their hydrolysis may constitute the most important chemical reaction in growth. If, as seems not improbable, the other reactions involved wait upon this one, it is the "master reaction" according to Robertson's hypothesis. If this conception really applies to the case in hand as outlined, the effect of the concentration of hydrogen ions on growth may be a direct one. It is known that the action of the fat-splitting enzyme lipase is favored by a certain amount of free acid. The maximum rate of germination of the pollen and the greatest amount of growth of the pollen tubes occur at pH 6. 0. This may be due in large part to the immediate effect of this concentration of hydrogen ions upon the digestion of the reserve food...|$|E
