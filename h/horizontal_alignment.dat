25|$|The Draft Environmental Impact Study (DEIS) for {{the project}} was issued in June 2017. Four {{alternatives}} for alignments under the Hudson River and the Palisades. Option 1 would have the new tunnels run close to the existing tunnels with a ventilation site near the Lincoln Tunnel Helix. This option would have required a construction staging site within the Lincoln Tunnel Helix, thus displacing New Jersey Transit's Weehawken bus storage site, which would {{have a negative impact}} on the operation of buses to the Port Authority Bus Terminal. Option 2 would have the new tunnels run further south than the first option, with a shaft site north of 19th Street near JFK Boulevard East. This option would require the acquisition and demolition of an existing multi-story office building to build the shaft site. The third option would be further south with a shaft site south of 19th Street. This option would preclude the development of a portion of a planned residential development under construction at 800 Harbor Boulevard. The fourth option would be further south with a shaft site south of 18th Street–following the same <b>horizontal</b> <b>alignment</b> identified in the ARC FEIS. Alignment Option 4 was chosen for the build alternative even though it would have a slightly longer tunnel than in the other alternatives. Because of the additional length, there would be additional tunneling costs for this option. However, the first three options have greater pre-construction risks, meaning that if construction was delayed the cost difference would be minimized. In addition, Option 4 does not have the issues that the first three options have.|$|E

40|$|The use of {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) visualization {{technologies in}} the field of transportation sciences has contributed not only to the assessment of the impact of a road project on its surroundings but also to the development and study of elements of the geometric design itself. The present study aimed to assess the effectiveness of the use of 3 D visualization tools in the detection of poor compatibility between the <b>horizontal</b> and vertical <b>alignments</b> of a road project. The assessment was performed by conducting tests with groups of participants who were students from a civil engineering course with no experience in the development of geometric roadway designs. These participants each assessed two road stretches: one stretch with unflawed coordination between the vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>alignments</b> of the road and another stretch in which this coordination had been intentionally distorted. It was used an application software for roadway geometric designs that allowed the creation of a video of the trajectory of the targeted road. Subsequently, the participants answered a questionnaire that aided the interpretation of the results regarding the design deficiencies in road layouts perceived from the 3 D visualization of the roadways...|$|R

While controlling the aim, speed and curve of the cue ball takes a great deal of practice to master, there is a science to it. [...] After the initial contact, the cue ball will travel straight along the path defined by the <b>horizontal</b> <b>alignment</b> of the cue until the cue ball slows enough for the imparted vertical spin to take over. [...] The cue ball will then curve onto a line defined by an angle described by the cue ball's initial resting point on the table and point on the table where the cue tip was aimed. [...] The time before vertical spin overcomes horizontal movement is determined by the force with which the cue ball is struck. [...] Massés are quite difficult for non-experts, and are not allowed in some venues, as the table's [...] can be easily damaged by unskilled players.|$|E

30|$|The dynamic impact {{response}} of giant buckyball C 720 is investigated by using molecular dynamics simulations. The non-recoverable deformation of C 720 {{makes it an}} ideal candidate for high-performance energy absorption. Firstly, mechanical behaviors under dynamic impact and low-speed crushing are simulated and modeled, which clarifies the buckling-related energy absorption mechanism. One-dimensional C 720 arrays (both vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>alignments)</b> are studied at various impact speeds, which show that the energy absorption ability {{is dominated by the}} impact energy per buckyball and less sensitive to the number and arrangement direction of buckyballs. Three-dimensional stacking of buckyballs in simple cubic, body-centered cubic, hexagonal, and face-centered cubic forms are investigated. Stacking form with higher occupation density yields higher energy absorption. The present study may shed lights on employing C 720 assembly as an advanced energy absorption system against low-speed impacts.|$|R

The basic mannequin, a molded polyester-fiberglass commercial display model, was coated with a wet mixture of ground asbestos, plaster of Paris, and building cement.

We previously developed a method for optimizing forest road alignments once a series of intersection points (IPs) were selected manually using Tabu Search. The application of the program to a part of Capitol State Forest in Washington State, USA indicated that the program successfully found better alignments than manually selected initial alignments. In order to find initial solutions without manually initialized solutions, the Dijkstra method and a cubic spline function were combined with our optimization program. The Dijkstra method connected some segments between two end points and the spline function generated smooth vertical alignments between two end points based on the <b>horizontal</b> <b>alignments.</b> In order to adapt the new method for forest road design to our existing method, the program converted the spline curves to straight and parabolic sections. The solution using a spline function was 10 % poorer than the solution without a spline function, but computing time significantly reduced from 73 hours to 19 hours using the spline function. Furthermore, the program generated smooth vertical alignments automatically. This study reports our initial effort to use the spline function in optimal road design. Additional investigation could improve solution quality using the Dijkstra method and cubic splines...|$|R
