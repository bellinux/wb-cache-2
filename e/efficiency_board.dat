However, little effort has been made to explore the passengers’ boarding behaviors at the platform of HSR station. This study proposes a cellular automaton (CA) model to study the passengers’ boarding behavior at the platform of HSR station. Some numerical tests are conducted to explore the passengers’ movements and the complex traffic phenomena (e. g., each passenger’s trajectory, congestion, and travel time) which occur during the boarding process. The numerical results illustrate that the passengers’ inflow rate and entrance choice behavior have significant impacts on the <b>boarding</b> <b>efficiency.</b> These results can help managers to understand the passengers’ boarding behavior and to improve the <b>boarding</b> <b>efficiency...</b>|$|R

40|$|As the {{transistor}} count per chip {{in computer}} microprocessors surpasses one billion, {{the semiconductor industry}} has {{become more and more}} concerned with meeting processor’s power requirements. This poses a design challenge for the power supply module, especially when the processor operates at low voltage range. For example, the electrical requirement for the newest Intel microprocessors has exceeded 100 A with an input voltage of approximately 1 V. To overcome this problem, multiphase DC-to-DC converters encased in a voltage regulator module (VRM) have become the standard means of supplying power to computer microprocessor. This study proposes a new topology for the multiphase DC-to-DC converter for powering microprocessors. The new topology accepts 12 V input, and outputs a steady state voltage of 1 V with a maximum output current of 40 A. The proposed topology aims to improve the input and output characteristics of the basic multiphase “buck” converter, along with an improved efficiency, line regulation, and load regulation. To explore the feasibility of such a topology, open-loop computer simulation and closed-loop hardware tests were performed. On open-loop simulation, OrCad pspice was used to verify design calculations and evaluate its performance. Then the closed-loop hardware prototype was tested to compare the circuit performance with those values obtained from simulation. The result shows the proposed topology improvement of <b>efficiency,</b> <b>board</b> size, output ripple, and regulations...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} the cost efficiency of non-life Takaful insurance firms operating in 10 Islamic countries. Non-parametric {{data envelopment analysis}} is used to compute cost efficiency scores and a second-stage logit transformation regression model is then estimated to test the influence of corporate characteristics on these efficiencies. We find that non-executive directors and separating the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman functions do not improve cost <b>efficiency.</b> However, <b>board</b> size, firm size and product specialisation have positive effects on the cost efficiency of Takaful insurers. In contrast, the regulatory environment is found not to be statistically significant in terms of improving cost efficiency.

40|$|Abstract: On one hand, an all-electric ship {{may take}} over and support {{operator}} tasks {{in order to improve}} the operational effectiveness and <b>efficiency</b> on <b>board</b> of a ship. At the other hand, information processing demands seem to increase substantially for the operators in such a ship. Recently, a Cognitive Task Load analysis method was developed for the design of operator tasks and computer support, aiming at optimal load distributions during high-demand situations in current and future naval ships. This paper gives a brief overview of the method, presents results of a task load study in the Multi-purpose frigate of the Royal Netherlands Navy, and summarises current user interface concepts that provide an “integrated view ” for supervision and damage control activities in an all-electric ship.

The Board of Education directed the school district to conduct {{a comprehensive review of}} school enrollmentsin September 2008. Recognizing that some schools were significantly under-enrolled, the Board of Education sought to offer more educational opportunities in historically under-served areas of the county, relieve overcrowding where possible, and improve operating <b>efficiencies.</b> The <b>Board</b> of Education used constituent feedback to refine the proposal made by Interim Superintendent Dr. William R. Hite, Jr. earlier this year, and reduced the number of schools to be consolidated to eight instead of 12. The plan still relieves overcrowded schools, identifies space for new academic choices, and expands successful programs. The school district’s next step will be to solicit public input on what new or expanded programs communities would like to see in their schools.|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the link between}} cost <b>efficiency</b> and <b>board</b> composition in non-life takaful insurance firms operating in 17 Islamic countries using panel data for 2004 - 2007. Nonparametric data envelopment analysis (DEA) is used to compute cost efficiency scores and a second-stage logit transformation regression model is then employed to test the influence of corporate characteristics on these efficiencies. We find that average levels of cost efficiency in takaful insurance markets mirror the efficiency in developed non-life insurance markets. The relative influence of board composition, such as the proportion of non-executive directors on the board, on the cost efficiency of takaful insurers depends on its interaction with other firm-specific characteristics such as board size. Hence, the effect of corporate governance systems on the cost efficiency of takaful insurers can be complicated by various firm-specific factors. Our results could have important commercial and policy implications...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} to know the {{physical}} and mechanical properties of particle board made up of jute sticks (jutex board) and wood chips (woodex board) of  Trewia nudiflora. Two leading particle board manufacturing industries of Bangladesh were selected first which have the same manufacturing process and adhesive composition. Boards of available thicknesses were collected randomly. From each thickness category, three replications were taken. The parameters were studied as adhesive composition,mass of a board, density, bending strength, modulus of elasticity,surface soundness, tensile strength, screw withdrawal, pressure and pressing time. Urea formaldehyde resin is used to manufacture both types of particle board. For achieving the greater <b>efficiency</b> of <b>boards,</b> some chemical compounds were mixed with the resin. Due to the change in thicknesses, boards were not always different {{in terms of the}} physical and mechanical properties. Moreover, except the modulus of elasticity (MOE), woodex boards were superior to the properties of jutex boards.  </span...|$|R

40|$|Information {{technology}} provides {{new possibilities}} to combine and support operator tasks {{in order to}} improve the operational effectiveness and <b>efficiency</b> on <b>board</b> of a ship. The general question is how to design a task allocation and support system that lead to an adequate deployment of the human cognitive resources. Neerincx [1] developed a Cognitive Task Load (CTL) analysis method to address this question systematically during (re) design processes. A brief example application shows the proposed approach: an analysis of different combinations of platform-supervision and navigation tasks with various support functions on the ship’s bridge of the Royal Netherlands Navy, aiming at an unmanned ship control centre under non-critical situations. Subsequently, we present a first prototype tool for the proposed, systematic exploration of the “design space ” by assessing the operator load for different task allocations and support functions. For envisioned scenarios, the analyst specifies several levels of crew experience, task allocations and support functions, and the simulator subsequently calculates the corresponding load distributions among the crew (including possible occurrences of momentary peak values) and the overall task execution time of the crew...|$|R

If monitoring improves performance measurement signals, on which a manager is compensated, it can be considered desirable from the manager's point of view. As a result, having a low degree of board independence (many insiders on the board) may incentivize the board to improve its monitoring technology. However, from a dynamic perspective board monitoring is not always desirable, since it can destroy the ex ante efficient trade-off between risk and incentives under the presence of renegotiation possibility. This provides predictions for an optimal board composition seen from a dynamic perspective...|$|R
