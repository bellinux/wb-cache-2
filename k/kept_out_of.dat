5|$|Shoe polish {{contains}} {{chemical substances}} {{which can be}} absorbed through the skin, or inhaled. When handling shoe polish, one should ideally wear gloves, and stay in a well-ventilated area. Shoe polish should be <b>kept</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> reach of children and animals. It can stain the skin for a protracted period of time, and will cause irritation to the eye if there is direct contact.|$|E

5|$|After {{taking part}} in the Gallipoli Campaign, Playford and his {{battalion}} left for France on 15 March 1916. He fought on the Western Front and was shot and wounded on 20 October, evacuated to London, and <b>kept</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> action for a year. Playford endured many operations during this time to remove the shrapnel that had penetrated his body, although some of it remained within him, and his hearing was permanently damaged. Turning down an offer for a staff job in India, Playford returned to his battalion in October 1917 and continued fighting in Belgium and France.|$|E
5|$|His {{first full}} {{season in the}} first team was during 2006–07, {{although}} he was <b>kept</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the team during {{the early part of}} the season by winger Jermaine Johnson. After eight straight games as substitute, Colbeck made his first start of the season in a West Yorkshire derby against Huddersfield Town on 7 October 2006. He continued to play more games in the side but as City struggled, Colbeck was sent off during a vital game against Oldham Athletic in April 2007. He was suspended following the red card but returned to the side after his suspension, and was involved in the 3–0 defeat to Chesterfield which confirmed Bradford's relegation from League One.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, the 4th Parachute Brigade, {{although}} {{still part of}} the 1st Airborne Division, was <b>kept</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Allied invasion of Sicily by a shortage of transport aircraft. The 1st Airlanding Brigade took part in Operation Ladbroke and the 1st Parachute Brigade in Operation Fustian. Both brigades suffered heavy casualties, {{so that by the}} time Operation Slapstick was proposed, only the 2nd and 4th Parachute Brigades were up to strength. Slapstick was in part a deception operation to divert German forces from the main Allied landings and also an attempt to seize intact the Italian ports of Taranto, Bari and Brindisi.|$|E

Entourage members Evans, Brown and Neil Aspinall were there for {{all or part of the}} time and Mardas arrived four weeks later.|$|E
5|$|After another knee {{operation}} and rehabilitation period, Sayers attempted a comeback for the 1971 season. He was <b>kept</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{the first three}} games after carrying the ball only twice in the preseason, as Bears head coach Jim Dooley planned to slowly work {{him back into the}} rotation. His first game back was against the New Orleans Saints on October 10, in which he carried eight times for 30 yards. After the game, he told reporters he was satisfied with his performance and that his knee felt fine. The following week, against the 49ers, he carried five times before injuring his ankle in the first quarter, an injury that ultimately caused him to miss the remainder of the season. He was encouraged to retire but decided to give football one last try. Sayers' final game was in the 1972 preseason in which he fumbled twice in three carries; he retired from professional football days later.|$|E
5|$|At Survivor Series, Triple H was {{scheduled}} to defend the championship against Vladimir Kozlov and Jeff Hardy, but Hardy was <b>kept</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the match after a scripted attack and injury. During the match, SmackDown general manager Vickie Guerrero announced that Edge had returned and introduced him into the contest. Hardy interfered and hit Triple H with a steel chair meant for Edge, thus costing him the title after a 210 days reign and resulting in Edge winning his sixth world title. After failing to regain the title at Armageddon, Triple H entered seventh in the 2009 Royal Rumble, but was last eliminated by Randy Orton. In February at Elimination Chamber, Triple H won the WWE Championship in the SmackDown Elimination Chamber match, setting the record for most reigns at eight. That record stood until 2011 when John Cena won his ninth WWE Championship.|$|E

5|$|Bure {{was set to}} {{make his}} much-anticipated return to Vancouver to play the Canucks on November 5, 1999, but was <b>kept</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the lineup due to a broken finger. A prior groin injury had also forced {{him out of a}} Panther's home game against the Canucks earlier in the season. During the season, he was named to the 2000 NHL All-Star Game in Toronto, where he {{recorded}} an assist and the eleventh hat trick {{in the history of the}} All-Star Game. Of Bure's three goals, two were assisted by his brother Valeri, who played on the same line with him, along with his Panthers linemate, Viktor Kozlov. Helping lead the World team to a 9–4 victory over North America, Bure was named the All-Star Game MVP.|$|E
5|$|The Volunteers' rushing offense {{had been}} led by Aaron Hayden {{during the regular}} season, but Hayden broke his leg during Tennessee's final regular season game. Due to the injury, James Stewart was {{forecast}} to start the game at running back for the Volunteers. During the regular season, Tennessee was ranked No. 13 in rushing, accumulating an average of 231.2 rushing yards per game. Stewart accounted for 93.5 yards of that total, having carried the ball 170 times for 1,028 yards and 11 touchdowns during the regular season. One of Tennessee's other backup running backs, Jay Graham, was predicted to be <b>kept</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the game due to an injury, but played after undergoing surgery. Graham, who rushed 61 times for 275 yards during the regular season, suffered a broken jaw after being punched in the face by a teammate. Because of the injury to Graham, fourth-string running back Ronnie Pillow, who had carried the ball just five times during the regular season, was predicted to back up Stewart during the game.|$|E
5|$|The first {{history of}} Christian Science {{appeared}} in McClure's magazine in 14 installments from January 1907 to June 1908, preceded by {{an editorial in}} December 1906. The essence of the articles, which included court documents and affidavits from Eddy's associates, was that Eddy's chief concern was money, {{and that she had}} derived Christian Science from Quimby. The material was also published as a book, The Life of Mary Baker G. Eddy and the History of Christian Science (1909). It became the key source for most non-church histories of the religion. The editor-in-chief assigned five writers to work on the series, including the novelist Willa Cather as the principal author. The book was <b>kept</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> print from early in its life by the Christian Science church, which bought the original manuscript. It was republished in 1971 by Baker Book House when its copyright expired, and again in 1993 by the University of Nebraska Press.|$|E

5|$|The {{second quarter}} began with Clemson in {{possession}} of the ball and facing third and two at its 46-yard line. The Tigers gained a first down with the first play of the quarter, a four-yard rush by Zachery. From midfield, Dantzler threw an incomplete pass then ran for no gain. On third down, Dantzler completed a long pass to Justin Watts, who gained a first down at the Tech 23-yard line. On the next play, Dantzler completed a pass to Zachery, who ran {{into the end zone}} for Clemson's first points of the game. During the play, Zachery broke his foot and was <b>kept</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the rest of the game. The extra point was good, and the Tigers narrowed Tech's lead to 147 with 13:34 remaining in the first half.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most of {{the other}} ironclads of the Ottoman fleet, the four Osmaniye-class ships were <b>kept</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> action during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, since they were among the largest and most {{powerful}} vessels of the fleet and the high command decided they ought to be preserved. As a result, they generally remained safely in the Sea of Marmara, though Osmaniye was briefly used as a troop transport in the Mediterranean Sea. The four ships were reduced to reserve status in Constantinople after the war, {{with the rest of the}} Ottoman fleet. The four ships were heavily rebuilt in the early 1890s, being converted into more modern barbette ships. Nevertheless, they were in poor condition by the outbreak of the Greco-Turkish War in February 1897, with many of their guns damaged or incomplete. Training exercises conducted in May highlighted the very low standard of training of their crews, and reinforced the decision not to confront the Greek Navy at sea.|$|E
5|$|Boulding {{started the}} first game of his second season with Bradford City, which ended with City losing 5–0 to Notts County, but he soon lost his place to new signings Gareth Evans and James Hanson and so had to wait another seven weeks for his second start which came against Northampton Town because Evans was suspended. He scored his first goal of the season in the game to give City a 2–0 lead, but his side conceded twice for the game to finish in a 2–2 draw. He scored in the club's {{following}} two games, but was then <b>kept</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the side for two weeks by a virus. Upon his return, he scored his 100thcareer goal and his fourth goal in five games as a late consolation in an FA Cup defeat to Notts County. However, Boulding continued to struggle to maintain a first-team place and was released early from his contract in March 2010, along with his brother under mutual consent, after failing to make a single start under new manager Peter Taylor. He had played 71 games at City, although nearly one-third were as substitute, and scored 19 goals.|$|E
