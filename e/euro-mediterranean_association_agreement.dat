Este estudo pretende verificar, com recurso aos dados relativos ao comércio e investimento estrangeiro bilaterais se, e de que forma, aquele reforço das relações União Europeia/Argélia no plano institucional se traduziu num fortalecimento do relacionamento económico e {{comercial}} nos primeiro quinquénio de vigência do dito Acordo, i. e. entre 2005 e 2010, tendo presente que a Argélia solicitou em 2010 a revisão do calendário de desmantelamento tarifário visando a criação da dita Área de Comércio Livre. Os resultados apurados revelam, no período em apreço, um menor aumento do volume comercial do que em quinquénios precedentes, devido a um conjunto de factores, e evidenciam uma redução substancial do superávite no saldo comercial a favor da Argélia, devido a um maior crescimento do valor das importações argelinas da União Europeia do que das exportações. Tal parece dever-se mais a factores internos argelinos, como um aumento da procura interna, por um lado, e à existência de fragilidades estruturais da economia, como a elevada dependência das exportações do sector dos hidrocarbonetos, por outro, do que constituir um resultado directo do mencionado desmantelamento tarifário. No que respeita ao Investimento Directo Estrangeiro, verificou-se entre 2005 - 2010 um crescimento significativo da entrada de fluxos europeus na Argélia. In {{the last}} years, the institutional {{relationship between the}} European Union and Algeria has been strengthened, particularly based on the <b>Euro-Mediterranean</b> <b>Association</b> <b>Agreement</b> signed between those two interlocutors which, among other objectives, aims at the creation until 2017 of a Free Trade Area. This study intends to verify, using data on bilateral trade and foreign investment, if and in what extent, that reinforcement of European Union/Algeria institutional relations resulted in a strengthening {{of the economic and}} trade relations in {{the first five years of}} enforcement of the said agreement, that is between 2005 and 2010, especially having present that Algeria has requested in 2010 the review of the calendar of tariff dismantling envisaging the creation of the above mentioned Free Trade Area. The results obtained reveal, within the period under review, a smaller increase of trade volume comparing to precedent homologue periods and show a substantial reduction in Algerian surplus in the trade balance, due to a higher growth in the value of Algerian imports from the European Union than that of the exports. This appears to be due more to Algerian internal factors, such as an increase in domestic demand, on the one hand, and the existence of structural weaknesses in the economy, like the high dependency of exports from the hydrocarbon sector, on the other, than being a direct result of the referred tariff elimination. As regards Foreign Direct Investment, there has been between 2005 - 2010 significant growth in inward flows to Algeria from European Union...|$|E

The present contribution analyses EU instruments of bilateral cooperation forming the backbone of relations with countries of the southern dimension of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) and places them in the specific context of each EU partner country. The paper proceeds by examining, first, the historical development of institutionalisation of EU-Mediterranean relations; second, the <b>Euro-Mediterranean</b> <b>Association</b> <b>Agreements</b> (EMAAs), ENP action plans and mobility partnerships, as key instruments of bilateral cooperation; and third, the idiosyncratic properties of each bilateral relationship on a country-by-country basis.

40|$|Recent {{increases}} {{in the number of}} multilateral and preferential trade agreements have sparked the development of applied models to quantify the impact of trade agreements. Outcomes generally support the theoretical notion that liberalising trade increases welfare. The increase in aggregate welfare is attained through a restructuring of the economy, with possible painful effects for certain economic sectors or parts of the population. The current debate on trade liberalisation focuses on the distribution of costs and benefits. Applied models can provide an understanding of the distribution of costs and benefits. Their outcomes, however, are determined by {{the way in which the}} economy and the liberalisation measures are modelled. The aim of this study is to compare different ways of quantifying the impact of the <b>Euro-Mediterranean</b> <b>Association</b> <b>Agreements</b> (EMAAs).

40|$|Introduction]. The Euro-Mediterranean Free Trade Area envisaged by the Barcellona Declaration of November 1995 {{should be}} {{accomplished}} by 2010, and is currently being organized through the new <b>Euro-Mediterranean</b> <b>Association</b> <b>Agreements</b> with partner countries. Up to now, treaties with Israel, Jordan, Morocco, the Palestinian Authority and Tunisia have been signed, and negotiations with other countries are well under way. Thus, {{it can be said}} that sufficient materials exist to give an accurate evaluation about the construction of the Euro-Mediterranean Free Trade Area (FTA). The paper argues that although the FTA has been conceived without fully considering all of its consequences, and actually restricting free trade only to some products, it can encourage growth on both the shores of the Mediterranean, provided that the EU adequately participate to the funding of structural change in the South, and that partner countries agree to improve domestic policies and to integrate their economies reciprocally. The structure of the FTA and its asymmetries are examined first, while policy implications for partner countries are looked at later. Finally, an analysis of possible future options is made...|$|R
40|$|Although the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership (EMP) {{in spirit}} aims at {{fostering}} {{economic growth and}} stability at the southern periphery of the EU, {{the contents of the}} trade agreements reflect the more narrow economic interests of specific, southern EU member states (dell’Aquila & Kuiper, 2003). Key characteristics of the <b>Euro-Mediterranean</b> <b>Association</b> <b>Agreements</b> (EMAAs) are an asymmetric focus on liberalising trade in the manufactured goods of the MPCs, while maintaining trade barriers on agricultural products. Several studies have quantified the expected impact of the proposed Mediterranean free trade area. A review of recent studies indicated that several characteristic features of the MPCs and the EMAAs are missing in existing analyses (Kuiper, 2004). This paper therefore focuses on identifying scenarios for further research that reflect key policy and research issues identified in an earlier study (dell’Aquila and Kuiper, 2003), while accounting for the gaps in existing analyses as identified in Kuiper (2004). Although limited to analysing the specific case of Morocco, the scenarios defined in this paper refer to issues that are relevant for all Mediterranean partner countries...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a broad {{survey of the}} economic situation in nine Mediterranean Partner Countries, and assesses {{the impact of the}} <b>Euro-Mediterranean</b> <b>association</b> <b>agreements.</b> The starting point of the analysis is the observation that overall economic performance of the region has been relatively poor when measured as growth of income per capita. Several factors are likely to have contributed to this. Investment in physical and human capital has both been lower and less efficient than in more successful developing economies. In addition, inward-looking development strategies have been combined with extensive state ownership and overall involvement in the economies to produce a high degree of protection. This has hampered competition and limited the gains from trade, leading to low productivity growth. In light of this experience, it is argued that the Euro-Mediterranean trade agreements are a necessary but not a sufficient element in bringing the region onto a more promising path of economic development. The freeing-up of trade with the EU needs to be accompanied by domestic economic reforms on a broad scale to facilitate needed structural transformation and to reduce the fiscal dependency on tariffs. Similarly, the Mediterranean countries need to remove trade barriers also between each other, so as to create a sufficiently large regional market to attract the foreign direct investment necessary to modernise their economies...|$|R
40|$|Since the Barcelona Conference (1995), the EMP {{represents}} an attempt of the EU to re-launch its global Mediterranean policy towards the twelve Mediterranean Partnership Countries (MPCs). Besides improving the limited {{results of the}} Mediterranean agreements concluded in the 1970 s, the renewed effort is aimed at counterbalancing EU engagement in East European recovery and integration. The broad aims of the Barcelona Process are to promote political stability in this turbulent area, establish a free-trade area by 2010 and promote social and cultural interactions. These, in turn, imply a number of themes that are common to all the agreements with MPCs: the institutionalisation of political dialogue and programmes for improving the {{respect for human rights}} and democracy; economic cooperation {{in a wide range of}} sectors; the definition of provisions relating to intellectual property, services, public procurement, competition rules, state aids and monopolies; and cooperation relating to social affairs and migration. The prime instruments for achieving these objectives are the <b>Euro-Mediterranean</b> <b>Association</b> <b>Agreements</b> (EMAAs) and a financial support programme (MEDA). The aims of this study are to provide a broad assessment of the EMAAs and to identify key issues for analysis relating to the EMAAs, with particular reference to the agricultural sector. Much research has been done on the impact of the EMAAs, by institutes participating in ENARPRI, as well as by other research networks (FEMISE and MDF) and individual institutes. This paper combines the insights of these studies with current economic and trade data related to the implementation of EMAAs and agriculture. ...|$|R

2500|$|However, {{there is}} also the largely defunct term of {{associate}} member. It has occasionally been applied to states which have signed an <b>association</b> <b>agreement</b> with the EU. Associate membership is not a formal classification and does not entitle the state to any of the representation of free movement rights that full membership allows. The term is almost unheard of in the modern context and was primarily used in the earlier days of the EU with countries such as Greece and Turkey.
