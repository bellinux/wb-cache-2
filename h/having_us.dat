2500|$|I {{think we}} were fairly smart with [...] "Spoonman" [...] in that you really don't see us that much in the video. You see various {{pictures}} of us, but it's {{not quite the same}} as <b>having</b> <b>us</b> in your living room all the time. We're trying to maintain some degree of mystique about Soundgarden, I guess. I remember back when I was a kid, long before MTV, {{and the only way to}} see my favorite bands was to go to their concerts. It was an incredible experience. MTV has helped a lot of bands, but they've also helped rob a lot of groups of that special mystique. It's tough when you can see a great rock band on TV one second, then hit the clicker and be watching a soap opera or a sitcom the next. That's what rock and roll has become for some people.|$|E
2500|$|Milwaukee Brewers {{broadcaster}} Jim Powell was {{sharing a}} hotel with Anthrocon 2007 attendees {{a day before}} the convention and reported a negative opinion of the furries. Several downtown Pittsburgh businesses welcome furries during the event, with local business owners creating special T-shirts and drawing paw prints in chalk outside their shops to attract attendees. Dr. Samuel Conway, CEO of Anthrocon, said that [...] "For the most part, people give us curious stares, but they're good-natured curious stares. We're here to have fun, people have fun <b>having</b> <b>us</b> here, everybody wins". Positive coverage was generated following a furry convention that was held in a Vancouver hotel where a number of Syrian refugees were being temporarily housed. Despite some concerns and warnings by staff {{that there could be}} a seriously negative culture clash if the two groups interacted, the refugee children were on the whole delighted to meet the convention goers who seemed like cartoon characters come to life.|$|E
2500|$|An {{organization}} called the Alliance for The Defence of Canadian Sovereignty is challenging a Canadian law that implements FATCA. The organization claims that the Canadian law violates the Canadian Charter of Rights & Freedoms, particularly the provisions related to {{discrimination on the basis}} of citizenship or national origin. This is not technically a direct opposition to FATCA — as the United States Congress has no legislative authority over Canada — but is instead an opposition to the parallel Canadian federal legislation. On August 11, 2014, in an action supported by the Alliance for the Defence of Canadian Sovereignty, two Canadian citizens filed suit in the Federal Court of Canada challenging the constitutionality of the Canadian law that implements FATCA in Canada. Both of the citizens were born in the United States, with at least one Canadian parent, but they returned to Canada in childhood and have had no residential ties to the United States since that time. They state that this would result in them <b>having</b> <b>U.S.</b> indicia, and therefore being discriminated against by Canadian banks. [...] On August 12, 2014, Canadian government spokesman Jack Aubry defended the constitutionality of the legislation, but otherwise declined to comment on the pending litigation.|$|E

2500|$|The {{next day}} Woody gives Norm {{a job with}} the city. Rebecca marries Don but {{secretly}} regrets it, feeling he is too good for her. Cliff is promoted to postal assistant supervisor after giving Marty gifts. Sam and Diane walk in and announce their engagement. His friends disapprove. Having enough of their disapproval, and going years without a family, Sam leaves the bar with Diane. On the plane, they begin to reconsider their decision to be together again. As the flight is delayed, they return to the airport terminal and amicably agree to part ways. Diane goes to Los Angeles, and Sam returns to Cheers to see his friends again. While Sam and his gang celebrate the reunion, Rebecca announces happily that Don has {{a job with the}} sewer department and leaves excitedly with the tickets for their honeymoon trip. After the rest of the gang head home, Norm stays behind and tells Sam that he knew he would return to Boston for his [...] "one true love", saying: [...] "You'll always come back to her." [...] After Norm leaves, someone (Bob Broder) knocks on the door. Sam replies, [...] "Sorry, we're closed," [...] then walks over and straightens a picture of Geronimo hanging on the back wall, and then exits into the corridor toward the pool room. (In the original broadcast, after the closing credits, the text reads [...] "Thanks for <b>having</b> <b>us</b> over on all those Thursday nights." [...] with the show's logo appearing.) ...|$|E

60|$|Now this is {{the reason}} of our carefulness, of our many troubles, that God is educating and {{training}} us English; that He will not <b>have</b> <b>us</b> be savages, but Christian citizens; He will <b>have</b> <b>us</b> not merely happy, but blessed through all eternity. He will not <b>have</b> <b>us</b> to be like the poor Indians, slaves to our flesh and our appetites--slaves to the pleasant things around us; but He will <b>have</b> <b>us</b> fill the earth and subdue it; He will have England the light of the nations--and Englishmen preach freedom, and wisdom, and prudence, and the gospel of Jesus Christ to all the nations of the earth. Therefore Christ afflicts us because He loves us, because whom He loveth He chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom He receiveth. Because He has ordained England to preach the Cross, therefore He will have England bear the cross.|$|R

It is but two years since I was {{appointed}} an ensign, and the king happening {{to be with my}} company, when we had a sharp fight with the Russians, he rewarded us by <b>having</b> <b>us</b> made into a regiment; so each of us got promotion.

The boys had no mother, and Aunt Ruth was an easy old lady who let them do as they liked, to their great contentment.|$|E
60|$|We {{unpacked}} near an Indian ranch {{belonging to}} an old man and his wife, who came up at once to see us. They were good-looking, rugged old souls, like powerful Japanese. They could not speak Chinook, and we could not get much out of them. The old wife toted a monstrous big salmon {{up the hill to}} sell to us, but we had more fish than we could eat, and were forced to decline. There was a beautiful spring just back of the cabin, and the old man seemed to take pleasure in <b>having</b> <b>us</b> get our water from it. Neither did he object to our horses feeding about his house, where there was very excellent grass. It was a charming camping-place, wild flowers made the trail radiant {{even in the midst of}} rain. The wild roses grew in clumps of sprays as high as a horse's head.|$|E

How often have I played under these trees when a boy! I feel {{a degree of}} filial reverence for them, as we look up {{to those who have}} cherished us in childhood. My father was always scrupulous in exacting our holidays and <b>having</b> <b>us</b> around him on family festivals. He used to direct and superintend our games with the strictness that some parents do the studies of their children. He was very particular that we should play the old English games according to their original form, and consulted old books for precedent and authority for every 'merrie disport;' yet I assure you there never was pedantry so delightful. It was the policy of the good old gentleman to make his children feel that home was the happiest place in the world; and I value this delicious home-feeling as one of the choicest gifts a parent could bestow." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Hardinge {{expressed}} his heartfelt happiness at <b>having</b> <b>us</b> back again, and, soon after, he ventured {{to ask if}} we were satisfied with what we had seen of the world. This was a home question, but I thought it best to meet it manfully. So far from being satisfied, I {{told him it was}} my ardent desire to get on board one of the letters-of-marque, of which so many were then fitting out in the country, and to make a voyage to Europe. Rupert, however, confessed he had mistaken his vocation, and that he thought he could do no better than to enter a lawyer's office. I was thunderstruck at this quiet admission of my friend, of his incapacity to make a sailor, for it was the first intimation I heard of his intention. I had remarked a certain want of energy, in various situations that required action, in Rupert, but no want of courage; and I had ascribed some portion of his lassitude to the change of condition, and, possibly, of food; for, after all, that godlike creature, man, is nothing but an animal, and is just as much influenced by his stomach and digestion as a sheep, or a horse.|$|E
6000|$|We had {{a week of}} waiting. It was not dull for me, because I {{was writing}} all the time. During the first three days, I {{finished}} turning my old diary into this narrative form; it only required a chapter or so to bring it down to date. The {{rest of the week}} I took up in writing letters to my wife. It was always my habit to write to Sandy every day, whenever we were separate, and now I kept up the habit for love of it, and of her, though I couldn't do anything with the letters, of course, after I had written them. But it put in the time, you see, and was almost like talking; {{it was almost as if}} I was saying, [...] "Sandy, if you and Hello-Central were here in the cave, instead of only your photographs, what good times we could have!" [...] And then, you know, I could imagine the baby goo-gooing something out in reply, with its fists in its mouth and itself stretched across its mother's lap on its back, and she a-laughing and admiring and worshipping, and now and then tickling under the baby's chin to set it cackling, and then maybe throwing in a word of answer to me herself--and so on and so on --well, don't you know, I could sit there in the cave with my pen, and keep it up, that way, by the hour with them. Why, it was almost like <b>having</b> <b>us</b> all together again.|$|E
