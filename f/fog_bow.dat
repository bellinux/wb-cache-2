60|$|How {{long this}} lasted I have no conception, for a blankness intervened, of which I {{remember}} {{no more than}} one remembers of troubled and painful sleep. When I aroused, it was as after centuries of time; and I saw, almost above me and emerging from the <b>fog,</b> the <b>bow</b> of a vessel, and three triangular sails, each shrewdly lapping the other and filled with wind. Where the bow cut the water there was a great foaming and gurgling, and I seemed directly in its path. I tried to cry out, but was too exhausted. The bow plunged down, just missing me and sending a swash of water clear over my head. Then the long, black side of the vessel began slipping past, so near that I could have touched it with my hands. I tried to reach it, in a mad resolve to claw into the wood with my nails, but my arms were heavy and lifeless. Again I strove to call out, but made no sound.|$|R
50|$|A <b>fog</b> <b>bow,</b> {{sometimes}} called a white rainbow, {{is a similar}} phenomenon to a rainbow; however, as its name suggests, it appears as a bow in fog rather than rain. Because of the very small size of water droplets that cause fog—smaller than 0.05 mm—the <b>fog</b> <b>bow</b> has only very weak colors, with a red outer edge and bluish inner edge.|$|E

5000|$|In many cases, {{when the}} {{droplets}} are very small, fog bows appear white, {{and are therefore}} sometimes called white rainbows. This lack of color is the feature of a <b>fog</b> <b>bow</b> that distinguishes it from a glory, which has multiple pale-colored rings caused by diffraction. When droplets forming it are {{almost all of the}} same size, the <b>fog</b> <b>bow</b> can have multiple inner rings, or supernumeraries, which are more strongly colored than the main bow.

60|$|The {{officers}} of the Adamant little understood the resources and intentions of their opponents. Every vessel of the Syndicate carried a magnetic indicator, {{which was designed to}} prevent collisions with iron vessels. This little instrument was placed at night and during <b>fogs</b> at the <b>bow</b> of the vessel, and a delicate arm of steel, which ordinarily pointed upward at a considerable angle, fell into a horizontal position when any large body of iron approached within a quarter of a mile, and, so falling, rang a small bell. Its point then turned toward the mass of iron.|$|R
5000|$|Hallett {{made several}} solo {{recording}}s, which include improvisations, songs and [...] "tape collage pieces" [...] from her {{works for the}} stage. For her recording White <b>Fog,</b> she <b>bowed</b> a bicycle wheel. A review describes [...] "plaintive sounds" [...] of the wheel spokes, expanded to [...] "soundscapes" [...] by digital delay boxes. A second piece on the recording is The Onyx Rook, an improvisation for violin and voice, the third Snail and Curlew, a collage of sounds of [...] "water, bird, and vocal sounds". Hallett made a duo recording Geographers with Clive Bell in 2005. Martin Longley comments that while Bell plays mainly reed and pipe instruments from places such as South East Asia, Hallett included a saw, a bicycle wheel mounted on a spindle, and the viola, on most improvisations modified by electronics. The reviewer describes an atmosphere of [...] "suspended meditation, sustained {{for over an hour}} with some extremely varied and resourceful spontaneity", with the sound of the bicycle wheel [...] "uncannily similar to her viola or sarangi, but just a touch rougher".|$|R
500|$|Later that month, Convoy PQ 13 was {{constituted}} and Duke of York again formed part of {{the escort}} force. In early April, Duke of York, King George V, and the carrier Victorious formed {{the core of a}} support force that patrolled between Iceland and Norway to cover several convoys to the Soviet Union. In late April, when King George V accidentally rammed and sank the destroyer [...] in dense <b>fog,</b> sustaining significant <b>bow</b> damage, Duke of York was sent to relieve her. She continued in these operations through May, when she was joined by the American battleship [...] In mid-September, Duke of York escorted Convoy QP 14.|$|R

50|$|A <b>fog</b> <b>bow</b> {{is seen in}} {{the same}} {{direction}} as a rainbow, thus the sun would be behind the head of the observer and the direction of view would be into a bank of fog (which may not be noticeable in directions away from the bow itself). Its outer radius is slightly less than that of a rainbow.|$|E
5000|$|A {{circular}} rainbow {{should not}} be confused with the glory, which is much smaller in diameter and is created by different optical processes. In the right circumstances, a glory and a (circular) rainbow or <b>fog</b> <b>bow</b> can occur together. Another atmospheric phenomenon that may be mistaken for a [...] "circular rainbow" [...] is the 22° halo, which is caused by ice crystals rather than liquid water droplets, and is located around the sun (or moon), not opposite it.|$|E
5000|$|During {{her next}} patrol, from 17 April to 21 May 1944, Tautog (handed over to Thomas S. Baskett, {{formerly}} of [...] ) {{returned to the}} Kuril Islands. On 2 May, she sighted a cargo ship in a small harbor between Banjo To and Matsuwa To. The submarine launched four torpedoes {{from a range of}} 2000 yd. One hit obscured the target. An hour later, Tautog fired two more and scored another hit. The 5,973-ton Army cargo ship Ryoyo Maru settled in 24 ft of water, decks awash. The next morning, Tautog made radar contact in a heavy fog, closing the enemy ship and firing four torpedoes; two hit the target. The submarine circled for a follow-up shot, but this was difficult as the water was covered with gasoline drums, debris, and life rafts. When Tautog last saw Fushimi Maru (5,000 tons) through the <b>fog,</b> her <b>bow</b> was in the air. On 8 May, amid [...] "swarms of ships" [...] the submarine contacted a convoy bound for Esan Saki. She fired torpedoes at the largest ship. One hit slowed the target, and two more torpedoes left Miyazaki Maru (4,000 tons) sinking by the stern. Escorts forced Tautog deep and depth charged her for seven hours without doing any damage. At dawn on 9 May, she fired on another freighter, missing. Three days later, the submarine fired her last three torpedoes at Banei Maru Number 2 (1,100 tons) and watched her disappear in a cloud of smoke. When Tautog returned to Pearl Harbor, she was credited with four ships sunk for 20,500 tons (postwar reduced to 16,100).|$|R

40|$|Spectral {{radiance}} measurements by {{a digital}} single-lens reflex camera {{were used to}} derive the bi-directional reflectivity of clouds and different surfaces in the Arctic. The camera has been calibrated radiometrically and spectrally to provide accurate radiance measurements with high angular resolution. A comparison with spectral radiance measurements with the SMART-Albedometer showed an agreement within the uncertainties of both instruments. The bi-directional reflectivity {{in terms of the}} hemispherical directional reflectance factor HDRF was obtained for sea ice, ice free ocean and clouds. The sea ice, with an albedo of &rho; = 0. 96, showed an almost isotropic HDRF, while sun glint was observed for the ocean HDRF (&rho; = 0. 12). For the cloud observations with &rho; = 0. 62, the <b>fog</b> <b>bow</b> – a backscatter feature typically for scattering by liquid water droplets – was covered by the camera. For measurements above a heterogeneous stratocumulus clouds, the required number of images to obtain a mean HDRF which clearly exhibits the <b>fog</b> <b>bow</b> has been estimated with about 50 images (10 min flight time). A representation of the HDRF as function of the scattering angle only reduces the image number to about 10 (2 min flight time). The measured cloud and ocean HDRF have been compared to radiative transfer simulations. The ocean HDRF simulated with the observed surface wind speed of 9 m s− 1 agreed best with the measurements. For the cloud HDRF, the best agreement was obtained by a broad and weak <b>fog</b> <b>bow</b> simulated with a cloud droplet effective radius of Reff = 4 μm. This value agrees with the particle sizes from in situ measurements and retrieved from the spectral radiance of the SMART-Albedometer...|$|E
