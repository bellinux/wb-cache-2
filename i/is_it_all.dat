500|$|The {{name of the}} {{crossover}} {{had brought}} speculation to what the [...] "Trinity" [...] stood for. In the 2012 FCBD special, Pandora, the Phantom Stranger and the Question were dubbed the Trinity of Sin. In regards to the name, Geoff Johns stated there was [...] "a bit of a mystery" [...] around it saying, [...] "Is it about the Trinity of Sin? The trinity of Leagues? Is it about Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman? What does [...] "trinity" [...] mean? What <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> about? That's something that the story explores." [...] In Justice League #23, it is revealed that the [...] "Trinity" [...] refers to the true number of evil, three, referencing Earth-3.|$|E
500|$|Gleeson further {{distinguished}} himself {{later that}} year by assisting in the defence of a trench against enemy attack. [...] He had {{a strong commitment to}} the idea of freeing Belgium from German occupation but was known to be critical of what he considered anti-clerical views held by the French authorities. [...] Gleeson was familiar with the realities of war and, in December 1914, wrote that [...] "if ... advocates of war were made to be soaked and caked and crusted with cold, wet trench mud, like these poor soldiers, and to wear those mud-weighted coats they would not be so glib with their treatises on the art of war. These militants should be made undergo a few nights in cheerless billets [...] mud-river trenches to teach them a lesson. What <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> for at all?".|$|E
500|$|Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music wrote a {{positive}} {{review of the}} song and rated it {{four out of five}} stars. He wrote, [...] "So, essentially doing a song like this is rocky ground, {{but the good news is}} that Demi generally comes across as the kind of bright, scrappy, girl-next-door type, so it doesn't sound quite so preposterous when she insists that she's still quite normal, really." [...] McAlpine concluded his review, writing, [...] "You can almost hear the paparazzi cameras going off as she's singing. [...] Of course, the only thing she has to worry about now is that having made this very public declaration, if she slips up for a second, we'll all be watching..." [...] Judy Coleman of The Boston Globe said that Lovato shows [...] "her Gen-Y stripes", and [...] "forcibly rhymes 'everything's the same' with 'the La-La land machine' – pronounced, of course,' ma-SHAYN'." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic noted it as one of the best tracks on Don't Forget. Ed Masley of The Arizona Republic included [...] "La La Land" [...] at number eight on his [...] "Top 10 from the Disney girls" [...] list, and wrote, [...] "Are Disney girls just naturally plagued by insecurity or <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> a plot to seem more real? Like Miley's [...] "Party in U.S.A.," [...] this song is all about how out of place Lovato feels in La La Land." ...|$|E

2500|$|The match {{itself was}} a scrappy affair that lacked the drama {{of many of the}} {{previous}} encounters, with England sneaking a 1–0 win thanks to a second-half header by striker Alan Shearer. There was enthusiastic celebration of this result in England, particularly as {{this was the first time}} that England had won a competitive match against Germany since the 1966 World Cup final. The German reaction was more pessimistic. Rounding up the German media coverage, The Guardian reported: [...] "'0–1! Germany weeps. <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> over?' asked the mass circulation Bild newspaper in a front-page banner headline. 'Shearer tells us to pack our bags,' wrote Berlin's Der Tagesspiegel." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of Crosby's songwriting {{contributions}} to the album, [...] "What's Happening?!?!", began his penchant for writing abstract songs asking irresoluble questions, a trend that has continued throughout his career with Crosby, Stills & Nash and as a solo artist. During a 1966 interview, Crosby admitted {{that it was a}} strange song, noting [...] "It asks questions of what's going on here and who does it all belong to and why <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> going on. I just ask the questions because I really don't know the answers." [...] Like [...] "Eight Miles High", the song exhibits the strong influence of Indian classical music with its droning guitar and melody. [...] "What's Happening?!?!" [...] is also notable for being the first song written solely by Crosby to appear on a Byrds' record.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{historical}} {{reference to}} Yang Meng was in 919, when Yang Longan had just declared himself the King of Wu, a kingdom {{derived from the}} domains that Yang Xingmi conquered {{at the end of}} Tang. [...] Yang Longyan created his younger brothers and his only known son Yang Fen (楊玢) dukes — in Yang Meng's case, the Duke of Lujiang. [...] It was said that Yang Meng was talented, and he often lamented the state of the affairs in Wu, which then was in effect controlled by the regent Xu Wen, stating, [...] "It is the state of my family's; <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> right for it to be taken over by others?" [...] Xu heard of his remarks and was displeased at them. [...] Shortly after, Xu had him sent out of the capital Guangling to serve as the military prefect (團練使, Tuanlianshi) of Chu Prefecture (楚州, in modern Huai'an, Jiangsu).|$|E
2500|$|Tolkien {{wrote in}} one of his letters: [...] "what I think is a primary ‘fact’ about my work, that it is all of a piece, and {{fundamentally}} linguistic in inspiration. [...] It is not a ‘hobby’, in the sense of something quite different from one’s work, taken up as a relief-outlet. The invention of languages is the foundation. The ‘stories’ were made rather to provide a world for the languages than the reverse. To me a name comes ﬁrst and the story follows. I should have preferred to write in ‘Elvish’. But, of course, such a work as The Lord of the Rings has been edited and only as much ‘language’ has been left in as I thought would be stomached by readers. (I now ﬁnd that many would have liked more.) [...] It is to me, anyway, largely an essay in ‘linguistic aesthetic’, as I sometimes say to people who ask me ‘what <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> about’." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gladwell's third book, Outliers, {{published}} in 2008, examines how a person's environment, {{in conjunction with}} personal drive and motivation, affects his or her possibility and opportunity for success. Gladwell's original question revolved around lawyers: [...] "We {{take it for granted}} that there's this guy in New York who's the corporate lawyer, right? I just was curious: Why <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> the same guy?", referring to the fact that [...] "a surprising number of the most powerful and successful corporate lawyers in New York City have almost the exact same biography". In another example given in the book, Gladwell noticed that people ascribe Bill Gates's success to being [...] "really smart" [...] or [...] "really ambitious". He noted that he knew {{a lot of people who}} are really smart and really ambitious, but not worth 60 billion dollars. [...] "It struck me that our understanding of success was really crude — and there was an opportunity to dig down and come up with a better set of explanations." ...|$|E
