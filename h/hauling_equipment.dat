2500|$|For 1979, Messner was {{planning}} to climb K2 on a new direct route through the South Face, which he called the [...] "Magic Line". Headed by Messner, the small expedition consisted of six climbers: Italians Alessandro Gogna, Friedl Mutschlechner and Renato Casarotto; the Austrian, Robert Schauer; and Germans Michael Dacher, journalist, Jochen Hölzgen, and doctor Ursula Grether, who was injured during the approach {{and had to be}} carried to Askole by Messner and Mutschlechner. Because of avalanche danger on the original route and time lost on the approach, they decided on climbing via the Abruzzi Spur. The route was equipped with fixed ropes and high-altitude camps, but no <b>hauling</b> <b>equipment</b> (Hochträger) or bottled oxygen was used. On 12 July, Messner and Dacher reached the summit; then the weather deteriorated and attempts by other members of the party failed.|$|E

25|$|The series premiered on June 17, 2007. Six ice road truckers are introduced, and are {{described}} as men driving eighteen wheelers who <b>haul</b> <b>equipment</b> and supplies from Yellowknife, Canada, across a temporary road composed of portages and frozen lakes, {{to one of three}} diamond mines northeast of Yellowknife. The final episode in season one premiered on August 19, 2007.|$|R
50|$|Big wall {{climbing}} {{is a type}} of rock climbing where a climber ascends a long multi-pitch route, normally requiring more than a single day to complete the climb. Big wall routes require the climbing team to live on the route often using portaledges and <b>hauling</b> <b>equipment.</b> It is practiced on tall or more vertical faces with few ledges and small cracks.|$|E

Related stock companies own the rolling stock, the <b>hauling</b> <b>equipment,</b> and the passenger transport division. Repair facilities have been privatized. Private companies may own or rent rolling stock that can use the rail system.|$|E
50|$|By {{processing}} {{trees and}} other vegetation where they stand, mulching machines eliminate {{many of the}} steps involved in land clearing such as site prep, cutting/felling/hauling, and site cleanup. This also {{eliminates the need for}} multiple machines such as a bulldozer accompanied by some combination of excavators, tree shears, wood chippers or grinders, and <b>hauling</b> <b>equipment.</b> On simpler jobs only one mulching machine is required, reducing fuel requirements and emissions.|$|E
500|$|Before 1915, the United States Lifesaving Service used {{horses for}} beach watches and rescues. In {{addition}} to carrying park rangers on patrols, the horses <b>hauled</b> <b>equipment</b> {{to and from}} shipwreck sites. During World War II, the Coast Guard used them for patrols. [...] In the 1980s Bankers were used for beach duty at Cape Hatteras National Seashore.|$|R

50|$|During {{the initial}} {{construction}} phase {{the delivery of}} equipment was complex. It first came by train to a rail siding, was transferred over the falls and then lowered by tramway to the work site below. <b>Hauling</b> <b>equipment</b> from Cairns was relatively easy. There was no road in the early 1930s but there was the railway on the opposite bank. Getting across the gorge was another matter. A flying fox was constructed to solve that problem. A weir was built in 1935, to even out seasonal variations in flow.|$|E
50|$|The lake is {{now part}} of a county park known as Wazee Lake Recreation Area. The lake is a prime scuba diving {{destination}} because of its deep, clear water. Visibility averages between 30 ft and 40 ft during the summer months. There are also visible remains of mining operations underwater, such as roadways used for <b>hauling</b> <b>equipment.</b> Some features {{have been added to the}} lake, such as underwater platforms for training divers and fish cribs to improve habitat for the fish. Fish species within the lake include rainbow, brook, and brown trout, bluegills, suckers, catfish, walleye, warmouth, and smallmouth bass.|$|E
50|$|On September 28, 2008 a truck {{driven by}} a roadie <b>hauling</b> <b>equipment</b> for Rock of Love Bus caused an {{accident}} when the driver fell asleep at the wheel. The truck crossed over the median and into oncoming traffic on Interstate 57 near West Frankfort, Illinois. The truck hit a pickup truck and a sports-utility vehicle. The two 19-year-old college students in the sports-utility vehicle were killed, and the two individuals in the pickup truck were seriously injured. The driver was charged with driving with a suspended license and moving violations. No other Rock of Love employees or crew were involved. According to a statement by VH1, Michaels asked that production be temporarily suspended.|$|E

This railroad line was originally built by the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad as a mining railroad for gold in the Black Hills. It reached Keystone on January 20, 1900 and was later used to <b>haul</b> <b>equipment</b> for carving nearby Mount Rushmore.|$|R
50|$|Tactical Movement was difficult, {{and near}} {{impossible}} in any formation {{other than a}} file. In this region which bordered Pakistan, the large signature created by the massive Air Assault gave ACMs the opportunity to flee across the border. Individual Soldier Loads were cumbersome but necessary due to the extended nature of the operation. At one point, local pack mules were procured and used to <b>haul</b> <b>equipment</b> into higher elevations.|$|R
50|$|In May 1918, {{during the}} {{reshuffling}} of Allied units, {{now under the}} Supreme Command of General Ferdinand Foch, to meet the German spring offensives, VIII Corps was at one point {{on the verge of}} being sent to join French Fourth Army. Hunter-Weston held a horseshow in August 1918, whilst the Battle of Amiens was in progress. Although he has been ridiculed for this, it has also been pointed out that VIII Corps was not involved in fighting at the time and that such events boosted morale and encouraged care of horses, which were still extensively used for transport and <b>hauling</b> <b>equipment.</b> He played an active role leading his corps in the Hundred Days Offensive, revisiting the battlefield of Le Cateau (11 October) and recollecting his successful handling of his brigade there.|$|E
50|$|Rubinstein and Bakija {{attended}} Forest Hills High School, {{the same}} as that of the Ramones, when they formed their band. After rehearsals under the name Pus with a varying rhythm section, the group changed its name to Reagan Youth shortly before playing its first gig on August 22, 1980, with bassist Andy Bryan (Andy Apathy) and drummer Charlie Bonet (Charlie Tripper). Reagan Youth quickly gained a following and were soon playing the punk clubs of Manhattan. Bakija's physics teacher shaved his head at CBGB's one night and after that became associated with the band, <b>hauling</b> <b>equipment</b> in his Dodge Dart. After the band recorded a four-song demo in 1981, Bryan was replaced by Al Pike. Bonet departed soon after; after the band briefly rehearsed with Rubinstein filling in on drums, Steve Weissman joined full-time. They signed to the R Radical imprint.|$|E

25|$|Filming {{began in}} November 1997. On {{the first day}} of {{principal}} photography, Anderson delivered his directions to Murray in a whisper so {{that he would not be}} embarrassed if the actor shot him down. However, the actor publicly deferred to Anderson, <b>hauled</b> <b>equipment,</b> and when Disney denied the director a $75,000 shot of Max and Mr. Blume riding in a helicopter, Murray gave Anderson a blank check to cover the cost, although ultimately the scene was never shot.|$|R
50|$|The {{river is}} navigable between Boston Bar and Lillooet and also between Big Bar Ferry and Prince George and beyond, {{although}} rapids at Soda Canyon and elsewhere were still difficult waters {{for the many}} steamboats which piloted the river in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The Skuzzy was the first sternwheeler {{to make it through}} the rapids, which was built with multiple-compartment hulls to preserve it from sinking from rock damage. It was used to <b>haul</b> <b>equipment</b> and supplies during the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway.|$|R
50|$|To {{keep the}} rail traffic {{compatible}} within a network, {{not only the}} track gauge needs to be the same, but also the couplers, at least for locomotive-hauled vehicles. For this reason, all the standard gauge railways in Europe use the standard buffers and chain coupler for locomotive hauled vehicles, while narrow gauge railways use a variation of couplers, since they often are isolated from each other, so standardisation doesn't matter. Similarly standard gauge railways in North America, Canada and Mexico included, use the janney coupler or the compatible tightlock coupling for locomotive <b>hauled</b> <b>equipment.</b>|$|R
5000|$|When an area is to {{be filled}} or backfilled the soil is placed in layers called lifts. The ability of the first fill layers to be {{properly}} compacted {{will depend on the}} condition of the natural material being covered. If unsuitable material is left in place and backfilled, it may compress over a long period {{under the weight of the}} earth fill, causing settlement cracks in the fill or in any structure supported by the fill. [...] In order to determine if the natural soil will support the first fill layers, an area can be proofrolled. Proofrolling consists of utilizing a piece heavy construction equipment (typically, heavy compaction equipment or <b>hauling</b> <b>equipment)</b> to roll across the fill site and watching for deflections to be revealed. These areas will be indicated by the development of rutting, pumping, or ground weaving.|$|E
50|$|This {{provision}} {{can be both}} {{a subjective}} immission control and an objective emission control. Normally there are daily curfews and in some case weekend curfews. The subjective aspect is to prevent noise disturbance in the adjacent community. The objective aspect is to control the sound output of specific machines. There are four major sources of site noise: (1) direct sound from continually operating equipment such as air compressors; (2) intermittent sound from equipment such as jack hammers;(3)backup alarms; and (4) <b>hauling</b> <b>equipment</b> such as trucks. Air compressor noise is regulated by CFR 204 and backup alarms are regulated by CFR 1926. Boston, MA(Section 16-26.4) permits construction on weekdays between 7am and 6 pm. Madison, WI (Chapter 24.08) limits sound levels to 88 dB(A) at 50 Feet. Miami, FL (Section 36-6) considers the noise a noise disturbance if it occurs between 6pm and 8am during the week and any time on Sunday. Dallas, TX (Section 30-2 (9)) permits construction in residential zones from 7am to 7pm on weekdays, from 9am to 7pm on Saturdays and Holidays, and prohibits construction on Sundays. Albuquerque,NM (Section 9-9-8) has a more complex control. It prohibits construction and demolition within 500 feet of noise sensitive properties (residences included) if the equipment sound control devices are less effective than the original equipment and if noise mitigation measures are not used when the levels exceed 90 dB (weighting not specified) or more than 80 dB during the day for three days.|$|E

5000|$|The Waterworks Museum {{is located}} on the {{northern}} side of Table Mountain, between the Woodhead and Hely-Hutchinson Reservoirs, in Cape Town, South Africa. The museum was founded in 1972 by Terence Timoney, a retired waterworks engineer. The museum houses a display of memorabilia from the construction of the dams on Table Mountain which include a beautifully restored narrow gauge steam engine. It has an interesting display of original equipment, hand tools, instruments and photographs and includes the original well-preserved steam locomotive used to <b>haul</b> <b>equipment</b> from the old cableway at Kasteelspoort.|$|R

50|$|Until the 1960s, the Wilmot Pass {{was only}} {{accessible}} {{from the sea}} or via the Wilmot Pass walking track. The 21 km unsealed road was constructed between 1963 and 1965 to accommodate heavy equipment transporters moving equipment loads of up to 97 tonnes from ships off-loading at Doubtful Sound for the construction on the Manapouri Underground Powerstation. The Wilmot Pass road remains {{the only way to}} <b>haul</b> <b>equipment</b> to and from the Manapouri Power Station that would be too heavy for ferrying across Lake Manapouri. From south, the only land-based connection to the power station is via Percy Saddle, where the track {{is little more than a}} marked route.|$|R
