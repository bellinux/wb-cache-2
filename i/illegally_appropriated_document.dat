30|$|Through this section, we {{have defined}} {{the crime of}} pillage. The finding is that pillage as a crime applies to any form of illegal {{appropriation}} of civilian property during conflict. Therefore, forced displacement employed to <b>illegally</b> <b>appropriate</b> civilian HLP during conflict may be considered pillage. Through this analysis, moreover, {{we can say that}} IHL, through pillage, provides considerable protection from dispossession through displacement.|$|R
30|$|This article {{argues that}} while most {{stakeholders}} cannot assign guilt or {{enforce the law}} they can establish if a forced displacement is illegal and when forced displacement becomes pillage or illegal appropriation. This paper takes the position, that ultimately, all stakeholders can decide if the criteria of a legal forced displacement or evacuation has been transgressed and if the HLP of civilians is being pillaged or <b>illegally</b> <b>appropriated.</b>|$|R

50|$|Many southerners {{also felt}} that their land, home {{to much of the}} country's oil {{reserves}} and wealth, had been <b>illegally</b> <b>appropriated</b> by the rulers of North Yemen. Privately owned land was seized and distributed amongst individuals affiliated with the Sana'a government. Several hundred thousand military and civil employees from the south were forced into early retirement, and compensated with pensions below subsistence level. Although equally low living standards were prevalent throughout Yemen, many residents of the south felt that they were being intentionally targeted and dismissed from important posts, and being replaced with northern officials affiliated with the new government.|$|R

The campaign did not find a wide support and entirely ceased with the stabilization of Mustafa Kemal's regime. In the same period the government forced the Jewish community to abandon the cultural autonomy granted to ethnic minorities, thereby violating of the Lausanne Treaty. It {{must be noted that}} this was the general policy of Mustafa Kemal's regime, which affected Armenians and Kurds, among others.|$|R
5000|$|The dispute {{revolved}} around copyright issues: Savant allowed {{the publication of}} extracts from his work, which included alleged excerpts from Maria's own accounts, taken from d'Ornano's book.

30|$|There {{has been}} renewed {{international}} {{interest in the}} crime of pillage, as a universal way to deter the illegal appropriation of civilian property, either public or private. A number of legal scholars argue for the reestablishment and simplification of the legal framework for the prosecution of pillage (Stewart 2011; Keenan 2014; Herik and Jong 2011). These scholars argue based on international jurisprudence, and the case law of the ad hoc international tribunals, that a simplified framework would allow the diverse forms of property theft to be prosecuted under one crime, pillage. Thereby, forced displacement employed to <b>illegally</b> <b>appropriate</b> civilian HLP would be prosecuted as pillage.|$|R

Hillman distrusted Gorman, and clearly favored Rieve {{as the leader of}} the union which would emerge once TWOC's {{organizing}} drives concluded. Gorman and other disgruntled UTW leaders filed suit against TWOC, claiming that UTW funds had been <b>illegally</b> <b>appropriated</b> by TWOC. A Rhode Island superior court ruled on November 30, 1938, that the TWOC-UTW agreement of March 9 was invalid. Gorman then denounced TWOC and Hillman, and sought to re-affiliate UTW with the AFL. On December 28, 1938, Gorman led a convention of 21 delegates in voting for affiliation with the AFL. The AFL executive council approve the affiliation on February 3, 1939.|$|R

Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks by intruders on fog nodes will cause system resources to be <b>illegally</b> <b>appropriate.</b> Intrusion detection system (IDS) is a powerful technology {{that can be used to}} resist DDoS attacks. In our previous research, we have proposed a fog computing intrusion detection system (FC-IDS) framework. In this paper, we mainly analyze and model the DDoS attacks under the framework of FC-IDS. We propose a hypergraph clustering model based on Apriori algorithm. This model can effectively describe the association between fog nodes which are suffering from the threat of DDoS. Through simulation, we verify that the resource utilization rate of the system can be effectively promoted through the DDoS association analysis.|$|R

He is the head of the most powerful family of the village of San Pedro de Lahuaymarca, a typically feudal region of the Peruvian mountains. In his proudest moment, Don Andres captures a lot of land, displacing other big landowners or feudal lords, as well as Indian rebels. Later he becomes an alcoholic and his family environment disintegrates: his children quarrel among themselves and his wife, disappointed by her family, also starts drinking. Before committing suicide by ingesting poison, Don Andrés curses his two sons, Don Fermin and Don Bruno, whom he accuses of <b>illegally</b> <b>appropriating</b> his properties, and in his will, he bequeaths his last possessions to the Indians.|$|R
50|$|Because {{his support}} was limited and {{regional}} Bermudo required {{the protection of}} the Caliphate of Córdoba. There was much unrest in Castile in his early years and the Cordoban armies of Almanzor came, not as allies, but as conquerors. Between November 991 and September 992 Vermudo was expelled from the kingdom by a revolt led by the magnates Gonzalo Vermúdez, Munio Fernández, and count Pelayo Rodríguez. He was soon restored and reconciled to the discontents. On 8 August 994 Bermudo gave the village of Veiga to the monastery of Celanova, the village having been built by Suario Gundemárez on land <b>illegally</b> <b>appropriated</b> from the monastery. Suario took refuge there during his later rebellion. On 23 August that year the village of Morella was granted to abbot Salvato of Celanova after it was confiscated because the murder of Fortún Velázquez had taken place there.|$|R

In the eighteenth century the church authorities sold it to a dealer and in 1779 it was purchased by the 5th Duke of Rutland. It remained as part of the Rutland estate until 1911 when the 8th Duke of Rutland sold it to the German-Jewish banker and science entrepreneur Leopold Koppel. On Koppel's death in 1933 it was <b>illegally</b> <b>appropriated</b> by senior Nazi Hermann Göring for his private collection. At the end of World War II it was discovered by American troops in a salt mine and was eventually reclaimed, with several other paintings, by Albert Koppel, Leopold's son.|$|R
50|$|In October 2011 {{authorities}} arrested 17 people, {{including two}} former {{directors of the}} Kolubara mine Dragan Tomic and Vladan Jovicic, eight executive managers and seven owners of private firms with which Kolubara conducted business. The executive managers are suspected of abusing their positions to <b>illegally</b> <b>appropriate</b> up to 2.9 million Euros, while enabling private companies to illegally profit 9.2 million Euros. Pre-trial proceedings were initiated because of suspicion that Kolubara's assets were used illegally through the leasing of construction machinery from privately owned companies, and by enabling other corporations and persons material gain. The first of two corruption trials against Dragan Tomic started on 25 May 2012. Tomic and four others were indicted in January on charges of abuse of power and of damaging the Kolubara budget for US$650,000 between 2004 and 2008. They face up to 12 years in prison.|$|R

A massive amount of Brazilians lives nowadays in houses with poor conditions of sanitation and comfort, usually built in <b>illegally</b> <b>appropriated</b> terrain, against urban regulations and without adequate infrastructure. Government interventions to improve these conditions are usually not permanent and continuous due to political or financial oscillations. Thus affected communities tend to self organize themselves to defend their rights to a decent house. As {{an alternative to the}} lack of financial resources they seek the collaborative way in the organization of self-constructed settlements, which are an alternative solution to housing problems, based on collective effort and community organization, with government's technical and financial support. More than the beneficiary community, self-constructed settlements involve several other agents, as technical offices, consultants and specialized workers, all of them hired to participate in the planning, project and building phases...|$|R
5000|$|Moore {{married an}} actress, Elizabeth [...] "Bessy" [...] Dyke, younger sister of tragedienne-to-be Mary Ann Duff, in 1811, {{whom he had}} met with the Kilkenny players where she was working with her sisters. She was the {{daughter}} of an East India Company official, but was raised with her two sisters by her mother. Moore did not initially tell his parents of his marriage, possibly because his wife was an English Protestant, but more probably because his marriage to a woman without a dowry would not help his financial prospects. Moore had expensive tastes and, despite the large sums he was earning from his writing, soon got into debt, a situation which was exacerbated by the embezzlement of £6,000, then a very large sum of money, by John Goodrich, whom he had employed to deputise for him in Bermuda. Moore became liable for the £6,000, which had been <b>illegally</b> <b>appropriated</b> by Goodrich, and lost an Admiralty ruling against this.|$|R
