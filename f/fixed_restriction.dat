40|$|This article {{deals with}} Markovian models defined on a finite-dimensional {{discrete}} state space and possess a stationary state distribution of a product-form. We view {{the space of}} such models as a mathematical object and explore its structure. We focus on models on an orthant [script Z]+n, which are homogeneous within subsets of [script Z]+n called walls, and permit only state transitions whose [parallel R: parallel] [parallel R: parallel][infty infinity]-length is 1. The main finding is that the space of such models exhibits a decoupling principle: In order to produce a given product-form distribution, the transition rates on distinct walls of the same dimension can be selected without mutual interference. This principle holds also for state spaces with multiple corners (e. g., bounded boxes in [script Z]+n). In addition, we consider models which are homogeneous throughout a finite-dimensional grid [script Z]n, now without a <b>fixed</b> <b>restriction</b> {{on the length of}} the transitions. We characterize the collection of product-form measures which are invariant for a model of this kind. For such models with bounded transitions, we prove, using Choquet's theorem, that the only possible invariant measures are product-form measures and their combinations. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} orientational {{ordering}} in systems of self-propelled particles with selective interactions. To introduce the selectivity we augment the standard Vicsek {{model with a}} bounded-confidence collision rule: a given particle only aligns to neighbors who have directions quite similar to its own. Neighbors whose directions deviate more than a <b>fixed</b> <b>restriction</b> angle α are ignored. The collective dynamics of this system is studied by agent-based simulations and kinetic mean-field theory. We demonstrate that {{the reduction of the}} restriction angle leads to a critical noise amplitude decreasing monotonically with that angle, turning into a power law with exponent 3 / 2 for small angles. Moreover, for small system sizes we show that upon decreasing the restriction angle, the kind of the transition to polar collective motion changes from continuous to discontinuous. Thus, an apparent tricritical point with different scaling laws is identified and calculated analytically. We investigate the shifting and vanishing of this point due to the formation of density bands as the system size is increased. Agent-based simulations in small systems with large particle velocities show excellent agreement with the kinetic theory predictions. We also find that at very small interaction angles, the polar ordered phase becomes unstable with respect to the apolar phase. We derive analytical expressions for the dependence of the threshold noise on the restriction angle. We show that the mean-field kinetic theory also permits stationary nematic states below a restriction angle of 0. 681 π. We calculate the critical noise, at which the disordered state bifurcates to a nematic state, and find that it is always smaller than the threshold noise for the transition from disorder to polar order. The disordered-nematic transition features two tricritical points: At low and high restriction angle, the transition is discontinuous but continuous at intermediate α. We generalize our results to systems that show fragmentation into more than two groups and obtain scaling laws for the transition lines and the corresponding tricritical points. A numerical method to evaluate the nonlinear Fredholm integral equation for the stationary distribution function is also presented. This method is shown to give excellent agreement with agent-based simulations, even in strongly ordered systems at noise values close to zero...|$|E

It assesses shortfalls of present-day operations and identifies {{the potential benefits of}} improving TRACON departure scheduling. To characterize present-day TRACON operations across the National Airspace System, an analysis of National Traffic Management Logs is performed along with interviews of operational subject matter experts and firsthand observations at a TRACON facility. The focus of the study is on miles in trail restrictions applied at the departure fix, as well as the process of compressing and swapping departure fixes and gates. The study shows that departure <b>fix</b> <b>restrictions</b> are frequently used and that implementation of these restrictions can be complex and workload-intensive. Also, significant facility-to-facility variation in the implementation of departure restrictions makes this problem even more challenging. The nationwide analysis shows that the top thirteen TRACONs issued more than 2, 700 departure <b>fix</b> <b>restrictions</b> during the month of July 2013, affecting more than 28, 000 flights.

40|$|A graph is a {{mathematical}} structure {{consisting of a}} set of objects, which we call vertices, and links between pairs of objects, which we call edges. Graphs are used to model many problems arising in areas such as physics, sociology, and computer science. It is partially because of the simplicity of the definition of a graph that the concept can be so widely used. Nevertheless, when applied to a particular task, it is not always necessary to study graphs in all their generality, and it can be convenient to studying them from a restricted point of view. Restriction can come from requiring graphs to be embeddable in a particular surface, to admit certain types of decompositions, or by forbidding some substructure. A collection of graphs satisfying a <b>fixed</b> <b>restriction</b> forms a class of graphs. Many important classes of graphs satisfy that graphs belonging to it cannot have many edges in comparison with the number of vertices. Such is the case of classes with an upper bound on the maximum degree, and of classes excluding a fixed minor. Recently, the notion of classes with bounded expansion was introduced by Neˇsetˇril and Ossona de Mendez [62], as a generalisation of many important types of sparse classes. In this thesis we study chromatic and structural properties of classes with bounded expansion. We say a graph is k-degenerate if each of its subgraphs has a vertex of degree at most k. The degeneracy is thus a measure of the density of a graph. This notion has been generalised with the introduction, by Kierstead and Yang [47], of the generalised colouring numbers. These parameters have found applications in many areas of Graph Theory, including a characterisation of classes with bounded expansion. One of the main results of this thesis is a series of upper bounds on the generalised colouring numbers, for different sparse classes of graphs, such as classes excluding a fixed complete minor, classes with bounded genus and classes with bounded tree-width. We also study the following problem: for a fixed positive integer p, how many colours do we need to colour a given graph {{in such a way that}} vertices at distance exactly p get different colours? When considering classes with bounded expansion, we improve dramatically on the previously known upper bounds for the number of colours needed. Finally, we introduce a notion of addition of graph classes, and show various cases in which sparse classes can be summed so as to obtain another sparse class...|$|E

40|$|Aircraft {{departing from}} an airport {{are subject to}} {{numerous}} constraints while scheduling departure times. These constraints include wake-separation constraints for successive departures, miles-in-trail separation for aircraft bound for the same departure fixes, and time-window or prioritization constraints for individual flights. Besides these, emissions as well as increased fuel consumption due to inefficient scheduling need to be included. Addressing all the above constraints in a single framework while allowing for resequencing of the aircraft using runway queues {{is critical to the}} implementation of the Next Generation Air Transport System (NextGen) concepts. Prior work on airport departure scheduling has addressed some of the above. However, existing methods use pre-determined runway queues, and schedule aircraft from these departure queues. The source of such pre-determined queues is not explicit, and could potentially be a subjective controller input. Determining runway queues and scheduling within the same framework would potentially result in better scheduling. This paper presents a mixed integer linear program (MILP) for the departure-scheduling problem. The program takes as input the incoming sequence of aircraft for departure from a runway, along with their earliest departure times and an optional prioritization scheme based on time-window of departure for each aircraft. The program then assigns these aircraft to the available departure queues and schedules departure times, explicitly considering wake separation and departure <b>fix</b> <b>restrictions</b> to minimize total delay for all aircraft. The approach is generalized and {{can be used in a}} variety of situations, and allows for aircraft prioritization based on operational as well as environmental considerations. We present the MILP in the paper, along with benefits over the first-come-first-serve (FCFS) scheme for numerous randomized problems based on real-world settings. The MILP results in substantially reduced delays as compared to FCFS, and the magnitude of the savings depends on the queue and departure fix structure. The MILP assumes deterministic aircraft arrival times at the runway queues. However, due to taxi time uncertainty, aircraft might arrive either earlier or later than these deterministic times. Thus, to incorporate this uncertainty, we present a method for using the MILP with "overlap discounted rolling planning horizon". The approach is based on valuing near-term decision results more than future ones. We develop a model of taxitime uncertainty based on real-world data, and then compare the baseline FCFS delays with delays using the above MILP in a simple rolling-horizon method and in the overlap discounted scheme...|$|R
