40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} whether {{the rate of}} ectopic pregnancy differs between <b>fresh</b> and <b>frozen</b> embryo transfers. Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis. Setting: Centers for reproductive care. Materials and methods: An electronic literature search in MEDLINE through PubMed was performed through December 2013. We included clinical trials comparing outcomes of in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles between <b>fresh</b> and <b>frozen</b> embryo transfers. Main outcome measures: Ectopic pregnancy rates from <b>fresh</b> versus <b>frozen</b> IVF cycles. Results: A meta-analysis revealed {{no significant difference between}} ectopic pregnancy rates in <b>fresh</b> versus <b>frozen</b> embryo transfer. Similarly, {{there was no difference between}} ectopic pregnancy rates in natural-cycle frozen embryo transfer versus programmed cycles. Conclusions: Differences in the hormonal milieu of the uterine environment between <b>fresh</b> and <b>frozen</b> embryo transfer stimulation do not appear to affect the ectopic pregnancy rate. More directed studies are needed before a definite recommendation can be made as to which is safer for prevention of ectopic pregnancy– <b>fresh</b> or <b>frozen</b> embryo transfer...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{competition}} between domestic catfish fillets and imported tilapia fillets in the US market. The market segmentation between <b>fresh</b> and <b>frozen</b> fillets of both species is also considered. The substitutability between catfish and tilapia is of interest because market reports have recently suggested that the rapid increase in tilapia imports {{in the last few}} years is the result of tilapia taking market share from domestically produced catfish. The competition between <b>fresh</b> and <b>frozen</b> fillets of catfish and tilapia imports in the same market is examined using market integration and demand analysis. The results indicate that imports of <b>fresh</b> and <b>frozen</b> tilapia fillets lie in different market segments, while <b>fresh</b> and <b>frozen</b> catfish fillets compete in the same market. Furthermore, <b>fresh</b> and <b>frozen</b> fillets of catfish and tilapia imports do not compete in the same market.

5|$|For {{people who}} need rapid {{reversal}} of warfarin such as due to serious bleeding or need emergency surgery, the effects of warfarin can be reversed with vitamin K, prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), or <b>fresh</b> <b>frozen</b> plasma (FFP) in addition to intravenous vitamin K. Blood products should not be routinely used to reverse warfarin overdose when vitamin K could work alone. PCC {{has been found to}} be better than FFP when rapid reversal is needed.|$|E
5|$|The {{common side}} effect is bleeding. Less common side effects may include areas of tissue damage and purple toes syndrome. Use is not {{generally}} recommended during pregnancy. It {{is recommended that}} the effects of warfarin typically be monitored by checking prothrombin time (INR) every one to four weeks. Many other medications and dietary factors can interact with warfarin, either increasing or decreasing its effectiveness. The effects of warfarin may be reversed with phytonadione (vitamin K1), <b>fresh</b> <b>frozen</b> plasma, or prothrombin complex concentrate.|$|E
5|$|No {{attacks on}} humans have been {{attributed}} to the longfin mako shark. Nevertheless, its large size and teeth make it potentially dangerous. This shark is caught, generally in low numbers, as bycatch on longlines intended for tuna, swordfish, and other pelagic sharks, as well as in anchored gillnets and on hook-and-line. The meat is marketed <b>fresh,</b> <b>frozen,</b> or dried and salted, though it is considered to be of poor quality due to its mushy texture. The fins are also considered to be of lower quality for use in shark fin soup, though are valuable enough that captured sharks are often finned at sea. The carcasses may be processed into animal feed and fishmeal, while the skin, cartilage, and jaws are also of value.|$|E
40|$|This {{work was}} done to {{evaluate}} the quality parameters of <b>fresh</b> and imported <b>frozen</b> seafood (fillets and shrimp). A total of 120 seafood samples, fillets and shrimp (<b>fresh</b> and imported <b>frozen)</b> 30 each, collected from fish markets at Giza Governorate were sensory, bacteriological, chemical investigated. Panelists rejected 5. 0 (16. 6 %) and 0. 0 (0. 0 %) of fresh fillets and shrimp samples, while the number raised up to 12. 0 (40. 0 %) and 15. 0 (50. 0 %) of frozen fillets and shrimp samples respectively. Fresh seafood had a significant lower (p< 0. 05) pH values in compared to frozen products. There were observed significant difference (p< 0. 05) in the TBA and TVB-N values between the <b>fresh</b> and <b>frozen</b> seafood samples. All <b>fresh</b> and <b>frozen</b> seafood samples were judge as safe food from microbiological point of view. The total proteolytic, lipolytic, psychrotrophic and pseudomonas/aeromonas counts for all examined seafood samples were lie within the standard permissible limits. L. monocytogenes could not be detected from <b>fresh</b> or <b>frozen</b> fillets. Few freqyency of L. monocytogenes found in <b>fresh</b> and imported <b>frozen</b> shrimp. As well as V. parahaemolyticus and Y. enterocolitica were recovered from examined <b>fresh</b> and <b>frozen</b> seafood samples.

5|$|The {{dusky shark}} {{is one of}} the most sought-after species for shark fin trade, as its fins are large and contain a high number of {{internal}} rays (ceratotrichia). In addition, the meat is sold <b>fresh,</b> <b>frozen,</b> dried and salted, or smoked, the skin is made into leather, and the liver oil is processed for vitamins. Dusky sharks are taken by targeted commercial fisheries operating off eastern North America, southwestern Australia, and eastern South Africa using multi-species longlines and gillnets. The southwestern Australian fishery began in the 1940s and expanded in the 1970s to yield 500600 tons per year. The fishery utilizes selective demersal gillnets that take almost exclusively young sharks under three years old, with 1828% of all newborns captured in their first year. Demographic models suggest that the fishery is sustainable, provided that the mortality rate of sharks over 2m (6.6ft) long is under 4%.|$|E
5|$|Prized for its {{meat and}} fins, the {{porbeagle}} {{has long been}} under heavy fishing pressure. The meat is sold <b>fresh,</b> <b>frozen,</b> or dried and salted, and ranks among the most valuable of any shark: in 1997 and 1998 it had a wholesale price of EUR 5–7/kg, four {{times that of the}} blue shark (Prionace glauca). Most of the demand comes from Europe, though the United States and Japan also import this species. The fins are shipped to East Asia for use in shark fin soup. The remainder of the shark may also be utilized, for production of leather, liver oil, and fishmeal. International trade in the porbeagle appears to be significant, but remains unquantified as shark products tend not to be reported to the species level, and many consist of a mix of various species. This shark is caught most readily on longlines, but is also susceptible to gillnets, driftnets, trawls, and handlines. It is valuable enough to be generally retained when caught as bycatch; if storage space cannot be spared it may be finned and the carcass discarded.|$|E
5|$|Harmless to humans, the smalltail shark {{is caught}} {{incidentally}} by gillnet and longline fisheries throughout its range. The meat is sold <b>fresh,</b> <b>frozen,</b> or dried and salted. In addition, the dried fins are exported {{for use in}} shark fin soup, the liver oil and cartilage are used medicinally, and the carcass is processed into fishmeal. In 2006, the IUCN assessed this species, including Pacific populations now separated as C. cerdale, as Data Deficient {{due to a lack}} of fishery data. In Trinidad, its abundance makes it the most economically important shark. Off northern Brazil, substantial numbers are caught by gillnet fisheries targeting the Serra Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus brasiliensis). In the 1980s, this species constituted roughly 43% of the shark and ray catch, but has since declined to around 17%. This apparent decline is thought to have resulted from increasing fishing effort, the large proportion of juveniles captured, and the shark's low reproductive rate. Consequently, the IUCN has assessed the smalltail shark in Brazil as Vulnerable, and noted the urgent need for conservation measures given that northern Brazil represents the center of the species' range. Although the smalltail shark was ostensibly given protection by inclusion on the 2004 Official List of Endangered Animals in Brazil, fishing remains effectively unmanaged.|$|E

5|$|Narrowed {{areas may}} be bridged by a stent, a hollow tube {{that keeps the}} duct open. Removable plastic stents are used in {{uncomplicated}} gallstone disease, while permanent self-expanding metal stents with a longer lifespan are used if the obstruction is due to pressure from a tumor such as pancreatic cancer. A nasobiliary drain may be left behind; this is a plastic tube that passes from the bile duct through the stomach and the nose and allows continuous drainage of bile into a receptible. It {{is similar to a}} nasogastric tube, but passes into the common bile duct directly, and allows for serial x-ray cholangiograms to be done to identify the improvement of the obstruction. The decision on which of the aforementioned treatments to apply is generally based on the severity of the obstruction, findings on other imaging studies, and whether the patient has improved with antibiotic treatment. Certain treatments may be unsafe if blood clotting is impaired, as the risk of bleeding (especially from sphincterotomy) is increased in the use of medication such as clopidogrel (which inhibits platelet aggregation) or if the prothrombin time is significantly prolonged. For a prolonged prothrombin time, vitamin K or <b>fresh</b> <b>frozen</b> plasma may be administered to reduce bleeding risk.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effect of}} carcass {{part on the}} {{acceptability}} of frankfurters made from mechani-cally deboned poultry meat (MDPM) was determined. The effect of <b>fresh</b> or <b>frozen</b> condition of the MDPM {{and the effect of}} days of storage on the finished franks were studied. Backs from which abdominal fat was removed and skinned necks were deboned separately and also in combination (5 : 1, w/w). Frankfurters were prepared from <b>fresh</b> and <b>frozen</b> lots of each type of MDPM. Protein, fat, water, and seasoning were held constant. The products were tested after 1 and 7 days of storage. Evaluation included organoleptic examination by a taste panel, shear values, yields, and proximate analyses. In general, <b>fresh</b> and <b>frozen</b> mechanically deboned backs and backs plus necks and fresh me-chanically deboned necks produced frankfurters with optimum texture (snappiness), tenderness, and juiciness. Franks made from frozen mechanically deboned necks were more mushy. Overall satisfaction scores were best for frankfurters prepared from <b>fresh</b> and <b>frozen</b> mechanically deboned backs and backs plus necks. Overall satisfaction scores for franks made from <b>fresh</b> and <b>frozen</b> mechanically deboned necks were lower, probably due to poor flavor. Shear values, although very little different, reflected tenderness data from the taste panel. There was little difference among yields or proximate analysis results for any of the frankfurters...|$|R

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} common cooking practices (i. e., boiling, microwaving, and basket and oven steaming) on the phytochemical content (carotenoids, chlorophylls, glucosinolates, polyphenols, and ascorbic acid), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and color changes of three generally consumed Brassica vegetables analyzed <b>fresh</b> and <b>frozen.</b> Among cooking procedures, boiling determined an increase of fresh broccoli carotenoids and fresh Brussels sprout polyphenols, whereas a decrease of almost all other phytochemicals in <b>fresh</b> and <b>frozen</b> samples was observed. Steaming procedures determined a release of polyphenols in both <b>fresh</b> and <b>frozen</b> samples. Microwaving was the best cooking method for maintaining the color of both <b>fresh</b> and <b>frozen</b> vegetables and obtaining a good retention of glucosinolates. During all cooking procedures, ascorbic acid was lost in great amount from all vegetables. Chlorophylls were more stable in frozen samples than in fresh ones, even though steaming methods were able to better preserve these compounds in fresh samples than others cooking methods applied. The overall {{results of this study}} demonstrate that fresh Brassica vegetables retain phytochemicals and TAC better than frozen samples...|$|R
