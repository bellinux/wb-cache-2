5|$|As {{government}} {{authority in}} South Kasai was consolidated, the government became <b>increasingly</b> militaristic and authoritarian. Non-Luba groups were <b>increasingly</b> marginalised. Political opponents {{were killed or}} driven into exile, including Ngalula. Non-Luba groups in the region, especially the Kanyok, fought a constant but low-level insurgency against the South Kasaian government.|$|E
5|$|In the US in the 1960s, {{military}} clothing became <b>increasingly</b> common (mostly {{olive drab}} rather than patterned camouflage); {{it was often}} found worn by anti-war protestors, initially within groups such as Vietnam Veterans Against the War but then <b>increasingly</b> widely {{as a symbol of}} political protest.|$|E
5|$|They were <b>increasingly</b> {{influenced}} by their Muslim trading partners.|$|E
5|$|According to Styopa Safaryan, {{an analyst}} and {{former member of}} the Armenian parliament, despite his mixed legacy, under Vazgen Sargsyan Armenia became <b>increasingly</b> independent.|$|E
5|$|According to a 2005 survey, 27% of German {{adults are}} smokers. Obesity in Germany has been <b>increasingly</b> {{cited as a}} major health issue. A 2007 study shows Germany has {{the highest number of}} {{overweight}} people in Europe.|$|E
5|$|After the Act of Union in 1536 the Shrewsbury Drapers {{provided}} an <b>increasingly</b> important export market for Welsh light coarse cloths, known as cottons, friezes and flannel.|$|E
5|$|After {{the tour}} concluded, the duo {{went into the}} studio to work on {{what was to be}} a reunion album. However, after <b>increasingly</b> acrimonious disagreements, Garfunkel dropped out of the project, which became Simon's 1983 solo album Hearts and Bones.|$|E
5|$|Airports {{generally}} have long, fully lit, hard-surfaced runways, full air traffic control, and navigation and landing aids. They are usually located on urban fringes, support commercial and business operations, and often exclude {{certain types of}} light aircraft. At the more rurally located airfields, the lighter end of aviation, such as microlight and gliding activities, becomes <b>increasingly</b> prevalent, and there are few or no commercial operations other than flying schools. At this level runways are generally shorter, and grass surfaces are <b>increasingly</b> common. Navigation aids are <b>increasingly</b> scarce, being more basic where they are available, and informal ground to air radio communication replaces air traffic control. The smallest airfields {{are too small to}} feature on general purpose Ordnance Survey (OS) maps, and lack basic facilities such as fuel and maintenance. The majority of airstrips are basically single short grass runways with no supporting facilities, although the presence of a hangar is not uncommon at the larger examples. They do not feature on OS maps, and are owned by private clubs or, more commonly, individuals.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he enjoyed}} his work, Kraft found it <b>increasingly</b> stressful, {{especially}} since he did not consider {{himself to be a}} strong theoretician. In 1956, he was diagnosed with an ulcer and started thinking about a change of career.|$|E
5|$|Although known {{mostly for}} his work in black and white, Koppelman's painterly {{interest}} in color took a new form in the 1970s, when he began using color in his prints. After 1980, he worked <b>increasingly</b> in pastel and watercolor.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the smaller}} gardens within Russia, {{one that is}} <b>increasingly</b> gaining prominence, is the Botanical Garden of Tver State University, (1879) — the northernmost botanical Garden with an {{exhibition}} of steppe plants, only one {{of its kind in}} the Upper Volga.|$|E
5|$|An ageing West Indian team relied <b>increasingly</b> on Ambrose and Walsh {{to provide}} wickets, while Lara {{was seen as}} the primary source of runs. Angus Fraser played an {{important}} role for England, and when his form dipped in the later Tests the side's performance suffered.|$|E
5|$|As Roman {{troops were}} spread <b>increasingly</b> thin over its long border, the Empire's {{territory}} continued to dwindle in {{size as the}} population of the empire declined. Barbarian war bands <b>increasingly</b> began to penetrate the Empire's vulnerable borders, both as settlers and invaders. In 451, the Romans defeated Attila the Hun, but only with assistance from a confederation of foederatii troops, which included Visigoths, Franks and Alans. As barbarian incursions continued, some advancing as far as the heart of Italy, Rome's borders began to collapse, with frontier forces swiftly finding themselves cut off deep in the enemy's rear.|$|E
5|$|Between 1978 and 1995, Kaczynski mailed or hand-delivered {{a series}} of <b>increasingly</b> {{sophisticated}} bombs that cumulatively killed three people and injured twenty-three. He took extreme care in preparing these devices to avoid leaving fingerprints; he also purposefully left misleading clues in them.|$|E
5|$|Between the 1980s and the 2000s, {{with the}} rise of {{databases}} such as Compustat and EDGAR and software such as SAS, articles became mathematically more rigorous with <b>increasingly</b> sophisticated statistical analyses, and accounting practitioners comprised a decreasing proportion of authors in the journal.|$|E
5|$|Bowker {{states the}} word appears but is {{uncommon}} in the principal Upanishads. Kaneda gives {{examples of the}} word Ahimsa in these Upanishads. Other scholars suggest Ahimsa as an ethical concept that started evolving in the Vedas, becoming an <b>increasingly</b> central concept in Upanishads.|$|E
5|$|By 1838, he {{was capable}} only of working in a small format. He {{and his family were}} living in poverty and grew <b>increasingly</b> {{dependent}} for support on the charity of friends.|$|E
5|$|By 1944, Belgian collaborationist groups {{began to}} feel <b>increasingly</b> {{abandoned}} by the German government as the situation deteriorated. As resistance attacks against them escalated, collaborationist parties became more violent and launched reprisals against civilians, including the Courcelles Massacre in August 1944.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s {{maintenance}} {{was becoming}} <b>increasingly</b> expensive, and the building's design ill-suited to modern fire appliances. Plans to replace the fire station were put on hold pending the formation of the Greater Manchester Fire Service.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of his {{retirement}} from his business, around 1890, Lilly was a millionaire who had been involved in civic affairs for several years. Later in life he had become <b>increasingly</b> more philanthropic, granting funds to charitable groups in the city.|$|E
5|$|Certain medications, such as {{corticosteroids}} and infliximab (an anti-αTNF monoclonal antibody), {{are becoming}} <b>increasingly</b> important risk factors, {{especially in the}} developed world.|$|E
5|$|Civil Air Patrol covers several {{emergency}} services areas. The principal categories include {{search and rescue}} missions, disaster relief, humanitarian services, and United States Air Force support. Other services, such as homeland security and actions against drug-trafficking operations, are becoming <b>increasingly</b> important.|$|E
5|$|Climate {{change from}} {{global warming is}} leading to a {{mismatch}} between the seasonal coat coloration of arctic animals such as snowshoe hares with the <b>increasingly</b> snow-free landscape.|$|E
5|$|Clindamycin may {{be useful}} in skin and soft tissue infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA); many strains of MRSA are still {{susceptible}} to clindamycin; however, in the United States spreading from the West Coast eastwards, MRSA is becoming <b>increasingly</b> resistant.|$|E
5|$|Despite his illnesses, he {{continued}} to travel to England in the 1990s to watch cricket and meet up with Compton, Edrich and other war and cricket colleagues on an annual basis, although he became <b>increasingly</b> isolated as he outlasted his friends, both English and Australian.|$|E
5|$|During Watts's lifetime, European culture {{had begun}} to {{question}} the concept of hope. A new school of philosophy at the time, based on the thinking of Friedrich Nietzsche, saw hope as a negative attribute that encouraged humanity to expend their energies on futile efforts. The Long Depression of the 1870s wrecked both the economy and confidence of Britain, and Watts felt that the encroaching mechanisation of daily life, {{and the importance of}} material prosperity to Britain's <b>increasingly</b> dominant middle class, were making modern life <b>increasingly</b> soulless.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s, Chapman became <b>increasingly</b> {{concerned}} about the Python's income and finances. He moved to Los Angeles in the late 1970s to avoid British income tax. He guest-starred on several television series including The Big Show.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} few years, the emigrants were mostly former {{occupants}} of Nauvoo who were following Young to Utah. Later, the emigrants <b>increasingly</b> comprised converts from the British Isles and Europe.|$|E
5|$|En route, the {{presence}} of the Orions begins having an effect on the crew: men become <b>increasingly</b> aggressive, while women <b>increasingly</b> suffer from headaches. Navaar focuses her attentions on Archer, while D'Nesh seduces Commander Kelby. Arriving at the planet, a sluggish Archer orders Reed to destroy another ship, but he refuses and it escapes. Kelby meanwhile sabotages the warp drive before Commander Tucker can physically stop him. Afterwards, Doctor Phlox determines that the Orions are producing pheromones, causing the crew's adrenaline levels to spike. Only Commander T'Pol and Tucker remain unaffected, since she is Vulcan and he shares her immunity because of their psychic bond.|$|E
5|$|European navies {{remained}} {{dominant in}} the pre-dreadnought era. The British Royal Navy remained the world's largest fleet, though both Britain's traditional naval rivals and the new European powers <b>increasingly</b> asserted themselves against its supremacy.|$|E
5|$|Following al-Sharif's arrests, she {{reported}} being <b>increasingly</b> marginalized by her employers at Aramco. She quit following {{a dispute over}} her trip to Norway to receive the Václav Havel Prize for Creative Dissent.|$|E
5|$|Following its {{designation}} as a named storm, Carlos drifted generally north-northwestward while {{embedded within}} a weak steering regime. The cyclone struggled {{with a combination of}} northerly wind shear and dry air entrainment, limiting the storm's associated deep convection to the eastern quadrant. By early on June13, however, a ragged eye became evident on visible satellite imagery as the upper-level environment became <b>increasingly</b> conducive for intensification, and Carlos was upgraded to a Category1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson scale at 12:00UTC. Deep convection became <b>increasingly</b> symmetric about the eye, and the cyclone reached its initial peak intensity six hours later with winds of 85mph (140km/h) and a minimum pressure of 978mbar (hPa; 28.88inHg). However, early on June14, the presentation of Carlos began to deteriorate as a result of upwelling and the ingestion of dry air; the eye became obscured and banding features decreased as evident on satellite imagery, while the eyewall became <b>increasingly</b> ill-defined on radar. At 00:00UTC on June15, the storm was downgraded to a tropical storm about 75mi (120km) west-southwest of Acapulco.|$|E
5|$|Following this match, intercolonial cricket became <b>increasingly</b> widespread; cricket in Australia {{became more}} popular {{and was given}} a boost when teams of English cricketers began to tour the country, leading to a rapid {{increase}} in the playing skill of Australian cricketers.|$|E
5|$|Four years later, Godwin {{remarried}} {{and his new}} wife, Mary Jane Clairmont, brought {{two children}} of her own into the marriage, most significantly—from Fanny Imlay and Mary Godwin's perspective—Claire Clairmont. Wollstonecraft's daughters resented the new Mrs Godwin and the attention she paid to her own daughter. The Godwin household became an <b>increasingly</b> uncomfortable place to live as tensions rose and debts mounted. The teenage Mary and Claire escaped by running off to the Continent with Shelley in 1814. Fanny, left behind, bore the brunt of her stepfather's anger. She became <b>increasingly</b> isolated from her family and committed suicide in 1816.|$|E
5|$|From late 1942 onwards JG 2 was in {{the front}} line against the <b>increasingly</b> {{numerous}} United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) day bomber formations of B-17s and B-24s.|$|E
5|$|Gay bathhouses today {{continue}} {{to fill a}} similar function as they did historically. The community aspect has lessened in some territories, particularly those where gay men <b>increasingly</b> tend to come out.|$|E
