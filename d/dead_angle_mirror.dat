40|$|Abstract. Though 3 D body {{scanning}} system is most developed system for achieving body data, {{there are some}} scanning <b>dead</b> <b>angles</b> when body is scanned. Based on the scanning file produced by Telmat 3 D body scanner, the structure of scanning file was introduced and model algorithm was analyzed. Holes in model were produced because of scanning <b>dead</b> <b>angles,</b> where were {{on the side of}} arms, on the side of legs, on the side of upper body, in the side of arms and in the side of legs. A 3 D system was developed to automatically read the scanning file and reconstruct body model in it. At the same time holes can be automatic identified and repaired by this system. Then the model repaired was compared to the initial model produced by Telmat system and to confirm the integrality. The algorithm of program is fit to 3 D scanning file from all kinds of body scanner system, which holes were produced. The automatic system perfected 3 D {{scanning system}} and overcome the difficulty produced by the hardware in scanning system...|$|R

50|$|The first {{original}} home console game to use pseudo-3D, {{and also the}} first to use multiple camera <b>angles</b> <b>mirrored</b> on television sports broadcasts, was Intellivision World Series Baseball (1983) by Don Daglow and Eddie Dombrower, published by Mattel. Its television sports style of display was later adopted by 3D sports games and is now used by virtually all major team sports titles. In 1984, Sega ported several pseudo-3D arcade games to the Sega SG-1000 console, including a smooth conversion of the third-person pseudo-3D rail shooter Buck Rogers: Planet of Zoom.|$|R

This was done, at a cost of $38 for the new rails.|$|R

50|$|A zograscope is {{an optical}} device for {{enhancing}} {{the sense of}} depth perception from a flat picture. It consists of a large magnifying lens through which the picture is viewed. Some models have the lens mounted on a {{stand in front of}} an <b>angled</b> <b>mirror.</b> This allows someone to sit at a table and to look through the lens at the picture flat on the table. Pictures viewed in this way need to be left-right reversed; this is obvious in the case of writing. A print made for this purpose is called a vue d'optique or perspective view.|$|R
50|$|When stereo {{images are}} to be {{presented}} to a single user, it is practical to construct an image combiner, using partially silvered mirrors and two image screens {{at right angles to}} one another. One image is seen directly through the <b>angled</b> <b>mirror</b> whilst the other is seen as a reflection. Polarized filters are attached to the image screens and appropriately angled filters are worn as glasses. A similar technique uses a single screen with an inverted upper image, viewed in a horizontal partial reflector, with an upright image presented below the reflector, again with appropriate polarizers.|$|R
40|$|Deviations {{from the}} ideal shape of {{reflector}} panels for parabolic trough {{solar power plants}} can have relevant impact on field efficiency and thus {{on the performance of}} the whole power plant. Analyzing the gravity-induced deformation of mirror shape for different <b>mirror</b> <b>angles</b> is relevant for performance calculation of solar parabolic trough collectors and identifying optimization potential of the mirror panels. Two mirror model cases (stiff and elastic supports) are evaluated in four angles: in horizontal laboratory <b>angle</b> (<b>mirrors</b> facing upward with mounting points horizontally aligned), and in 0 deg, 45 deg, and 90 deg collector angle. The resulting slope maps are calculated in a separate postprocessing. In order to evaluate the effect of gravity load on mirror shape, the deformed mirror in each evaluated angle is compared to the nondeformed mirror shape, and to the shapes in 0 deg (zenith) collector angle, respectively. The resulting slope deviation maps show the mirror deformation in different <b>mirror</b> <b>angles.</b> Stiffness of the mounting to the support structure has a relevant impact. Mirror deformation on elastic brackets (SDx up to 1. 6 mrad) is much more pronounced than on an ideal stiff support structure (SDx up to 1. 0 mrad) ...|$|R
