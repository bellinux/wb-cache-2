5|$|The colours {{would have}} first {{appeared}} bright and crisp, but over five-and-a-half centuries the painting has acquired layers of grey dirt which darken {{the tone and}} render the colours faint and pallid. Normally these layers of dirt would be removed by restorers, but given the delicate and fragile nature of a work painted in a water-soluble medium, it is <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so without removing large amounts of pigment. The colours as they appear today have faded from their original hues. The Virgin's mantle is now brown but would have been painted as blue. Joseph's tabard, once blue, now appears as green. The original indigos of the landscape are lost, while the azurite in Nicodemus's collar has darkened.|$|E
5|$|While Fingal was {{discharging}} her cargo, Bulloch went to Richmond {{to confer}} with Stephen Mallory, Secretary of the Navy. Mallory endorsed Bulloch's plan to load Fingal with cotton to sell on the Navy Department's account {{to be used to}} purchase more ships and equipment in Europe. He returned to Savannah on 23 November and it took him almost a month to purchase a cargo and acquire enough coal. He made one attempt to break through the blockade on 23 December, but it proved <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> as the Union controlled every channel from Savannah, aided by their occupation of Tybee Island {{at the mouth of the}} Savannah River. Bulloch reported to Mallory in late January 1862 that breaking out was hopeless so Mallory ordered him to turn the ship over to another officer and to return to Europe some other way.|$|E
25|$|With {{the brace}} on, there still {{appeared}} to be a jerk in his action. When studying the film at varying speeds, it still appeared as if he straightened his arm, even though the brace makes it <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. His unique shoulder rotation and amazing wrist action seem to create the illusion that he straightens his arm.|$|E

25|$|In early 2008, reports {{indicated}} that {{an agreement with}} Turkey had been signed which would lead to Azerbaijan producing armoured personnel carriers, infantry fighting vehicles, and small calibre artillery pieces. Another 2008 report mentioned Azerbaijan's desire to produce its own military aircraft and helicopters, but quoted a military expert as saying {{that it would be}} <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so for the next five years.|$|E
25|$|The {{exchange}} rate is pegged and is approximately MOP$1.03 for HK$1. For United States dollars, {{to which the}} Hong Kong dollar is in turn loosely pegged, the {{exchange rate}} is around 8 patacas to 1 US dollar. Although {{it is possible to}} exchange patacas in Macau, it is either difficult or <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so elsewhere. The few places in Hong Kong where patacas are available are concentrated on Cleverly Street in Central, a short distance from the Hong Kong-Macau Ferry Terminal.|$|E
25|$|Some {{argue that}} it is <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the {{calculation}} that utilitarianism requires because consequences are inherently unknowable. Daniel Dennett describes this as the Three Mile Island effect. Dennett points out that not only is it impossible to assign a precise utility value to the incident, {{it is impossible to know}} whether, ultimately, the near-meltdown that occurred was a good or bad thing. He suggests that it would have been a good thing if plant operators learned lessons that prevented future serious incidents.|$|E

25|$|Because {{blood type}} O {{negative}} {{is compatible with}} anyone, it is often overused and in short supply. According to the American Association of Blood Banks, {{the use of this}} blood should be restricted to persons with O negative blood, as nothing else is compatible with them, and women who might be pregnant and for whom it would be <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> blood group testing before giving them emergency treatment. Whenever possible, the AABB recommends that O negative blood be conserved by using blood type testing to identify a less scarce alternative.|$|E
25|$|In {{a popular}} {{personal}} report called Tre dagar med Victoria, which profiled her work during a three-day period that aired on TV4 in December 2004, Victoria commented on criticism directed at Westling, “Many unfair things are written. I {{understand that there}} is speculation, but some day justice will be done there, too.” Victoria also gave her opinion that happiness is important, and that these days {{it is not so much}} about background and pedigree but about two people who have to live with each other. She said that if they are not happy and comfortable with each other, it is <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a good job.|$|E
500|$|In 1843 Tischendorf was {{permitted}} to make a facsimile of a few verses, in 1844 Eduard de Muralt saw it, and in 1845 S. P. Tregelles was allowed to observe several points which Muralt had overlooked. He often saw the Codex, but [...] "it was under such restrictions that it was <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> more than examine particular readings." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{extent of}} Pueblo {{influence}} on Navajo weaving is uncertain. As Wolfgang Haberland notes, [...] "Prehistoric Puebloan textiles {{were much more}} elaborate than historic ones, {{as can be seen}} in the few remnants recovered archaeologically and in costumed figures in pre-contact kiva murals." [...] Haberland suggests that the absence of surviving colonial-era Pueblo textile examples make it <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> more than conjecture about whether the creative origins of Navajo weaving arose from Navajo culture or were borrowed from the neighboring people.|$|E
500|$|Much as {{the label}} had argued {{with the band}} over {{the quality of the}} songs before production, RCA {{continued}} to debate the issue with Priestess after the album sessions were finished in the fall of 2008. Despite the confidence the band themselves had in the strength of the album's material, RCA still did not share that sentiment and refused to release the album, as they felt it still lacked a potential single. Reflecting on the situation, Heppner remarked, [...] "You can't force write a single, it's <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that. At least it's impossible for us. We're not Tin Pan Alley songwriters; we're a rock band." ...|$|E
500|$|Adams {{began to}} make the drills far more {{intricate}} and precise {{than they had been}} in the past by adding a countermarch, maneuvers from the Army Drill Manual, and established a 30-inch (76cm) step, or sixsteps for every fiveyards (4.57m), as the band standard. Adams also added the criss-cross maneuver. First performed November 27, 1947 at the annual Thanksgiving Day game with the University of Texas, the criss-cross maneuver and its later variations became the band's most anticipated maneuver. Other band directors said it was <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> because it required two people {{to be in the same}} place at the same time (indeed, to this day computer programs that chart band formations say that this maneuver cannot be performed). To accomplish this, band members step between each other's feet. In later years, people who did not know that the maneuver was first done in 1947 claimed that the drill was designed by a computer. Adams explained, [...] "It's all a matter of mathematics. One man can take up only a certain amount of space at one time and moves in one direction at a predictable rate of speed." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{developing}} NLP, Bandler and Grinder {{were not}} {{responding to a}} paradigmatic crisis in psychology nor did they produce any data that caused a paradigmatic crisis in psychology.

500|$|The {{recording}} {{sessions for}} Music began in January 2000 at Sarm West Studios, Notting Hill, London. The first song that Madonna and Ahmadzaï worked on was [...] "Impressive Instant", {{since it was}} the most complete among all the demos that he had sent to the singer. The song was an instrumental and was not supposed to be included in Ahmadzaï's own album, Production. But Madonna had different ideas for the track and its lyrics, which she explained to the producer. Feeling that Madonna's vision about the song's composition would be difficult to create in Sarm West, Ahmadzaï wanted to return to Paris and work there on his own computer. [...] "There are a lot of chopped vocal tracks on 'Impressive Instant'...That was <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in the studio. It doesn't make sense to rent a place like Sarm just to have me work on ten seconds of music all day, using only the one computer," [...] he added. Within the first ten days, they had recorded the backing vocals, acoustic guitars etc. on a Sony 48-track and transferred it to Logic Audio workstation, using the converters of the TC Electronic Finalizer; Ahmadzaï then went back to Paris with the recordings.|$|E

2500|$|The chronologies of Ussher {{and other}} biblical {{scholars}} corresponded so closely because they used {{much the same}} methodology to calculate key events recorded in the Bible.

2500|$|On 2 July 1644, despairing of the {{existing}} military system, Cromwell made to the Committee of Both Kingdoms,the first suggestion of the New Model Army. [...] "My lords," [...] he wrote, [...] "till you have an army merely your own, that you may command, it is... <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> anything of importance." [...] Browne's trained band army {{was perhaps the most}} ill-behaved of all. Once, the soldiers attempted to murder their own general. Parliament, in alarm, set about the formation of a new general service force on 12 July. Meanwhile, both Waller's and Browne's armies, at Abingdon and Reading respectively, ignominiously collapsed by mutiny and desertion.|$|E
2500|$|Lord Salisbury, {{who opposed}} food duties, wrote to Law {{several weeks later}} {{suggesting}} they separate foodstuffs from tariff reform for the referendum. If the electorate liked food duties, {{they would vote for}} the entire package; if not, they did not have to. Law replied arguing that it would be <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so effectively, and that with the increasing costs of defence and social programmes {{it would be impossible to}} raise the necessary capital except by comprehensive tariff reform. He argued that a failure to offer the entire tariff reform package would split the Conservative Party down the middle, offending the tariff reform faction, and that if such a split took place [...] "I could not possibly continue as leader".|$|E
