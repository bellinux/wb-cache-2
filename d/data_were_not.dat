5|$|TCDD was {{classified}} in 1997 by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as a carcinogen for humans (group 1). In the occupational cohort studies {{available for the}} classification, the risk, even at very high exposures, was weak and borderline detectable. Therefore, human <b>data</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> deemed sufficient, and the classification was, in essence, based on animal experiments and mechanistic considerations. This has been criticized as a deviation from IARC classification rules. It is much debated whether TCDD is carcinogenic only at high doses which also cause toxic damage of tissues. Moreover, a recent review concludes that, after 1997, further studies do not support an association between TCDD exposure and cancer risk. New studies include the update of Vietnam veteran studies from Ranch Hand operation, which concluded that after 30 years the results do not provide evidence of disease.|$|E

25|$|Erythropoietin was {{reported}} to have a range of actions beyond stimulation of erythropoiesis including vasoconstriction-dependent hypertension, stimulating angiogenesis, and promoting cell survival via activation of Epo receptors resulting in anti-apoptotic effects on ischemic tissues. However this proposal is controversial with numerous studies showing no effect. It is also inconsistent with the low levels of Epo receptors on those cells. Clinical trials in humans with ischemic heart, neural and renal tissues have not demonstrated the same benefits seen in animals. In addition some research studies have shown its neuroprotective effect on diabetic neuropathy, however these <b>data</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> confirmed in clinical trials that have been conducted on the deep peroneal, superficial peroneal, tibial and sural nerves.|$|E
25|$|The Bhopal medical {{community}} {{was faced with}} 1) the urgent health care needs of the affected community, 2) the non-availability of toxicological and accident-related information, 3) the extreme sensitivity of local and national government bodies toward {{all aspects of the}} disaster, 4) lack of expertise, and 5) the lack of funds available to independent researchers to conduct investigations. Faced with lawsuits and the prospect of bankruptcy, Union Carbide’s efforts to keep open channels of communication were highly inadequate to address these issues and were {{considered by many to be}} a major human rights violation. In addition, the transnational political and legal ramifications served to throw a veil of secrecy around the disaster, thus impeding the discovery of essential pieces of information. Medical, toxicological, and accident-analysis <b>data</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> made public, thereby frustrating the efforts of the {{medical community}} to understand the linkage between exposures and health effects and devise appropriate treatment strategies. As an example, the lack of information about whether MIC could thermally decompose to hydrocyanic acid led to years of contentious debate on the merits of treating the gas victims for cyanide poisoning and an unfortunate violation of patient confidentiality.|$|E

500|$|When British {{scientists}} in Antarctica performed airborne ice-penetrating radar surveys {{in the early}} 1970s, they detected unusual radar readings at the site which suggested {{the presence of a}} liquid freshwater lake below the ice. In 1991, Jeff Ridley, a remote sensing specialist with the Mullard Space Science Laboratory at University College London, directed the ERS-1 satellite to turn its high-frequency array {{toward the center of the}} Antarctic ice cap. The data from ERS-1 confirmed the findings from the 1973 British surveys, but these new <b>data</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> published in the Journal of Glaciology until 1993. Space-based radar revealed that this subglacial body of fresh water is one of the largest lakes in the world, and one of some 140 subglacial lakes in Antarctica. Russian and British scientists delineated the lake in 1996 by integrating a variety of data, including airborne ice-penetrating radar imaging observations and space-based radar altimetry. It has been confirmed that the lake contains large amounts of liquid water under the more than [...] ice cap. The lake has at least 22 cavities of liquid water, averaging [...] each.|$|E

The Asian Development Bank (ADB) prepared a document, which includes data for the cities of Rawalpindi, Karachi and Lahore.

Beginning in 2005, the first systematic performance benchmarking for water and sewer utilities in Pakistan was initiated by the World Bank's Water and sanitation program {{as part of a}} regional project that also covered India and Bangladesh. Eight utilities participated, including five WASAs in Punjab as well as the utilities of Karachi, Peshawar and Islamabad.

He then went on to describe the subsequent development of attachment theory. Because he was dissatisfied with traditional theories, Bowlby sought new understanding from such fields as evolutionary biology, ethology, developmental psychology, cognitive science and control systems theory and drew upon them to formulate the innovative proposition that the mechanisms underlying an infants tie emerged as a result of evolutionary pressure. [...] "Bowlby realised that he had to develop a new theory of motivation and behaviour control, built on up-to-date science rather than the outdated psychic energy model espoused by Freud." [...] Bowlby expressed himself as having made good the [...] "deficiencies of the data and the lack of theory to link alleged cause and effect" [...] in Maternal Care and Mental Health in his later work Attachment and Loss published in 1969.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, University of Miami researchers, in {{cooperation}} with the attorney representing death-row inmates from Virginia, published a research letter in the medical journal The Lancet. The article presented protocol information from Texas, Virginia, and North and South Carolina, which showed that executioners had no anesthesia training, drugs were administered remotely with no monitoring for anesthesia, <b>data</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> recorded, and no peer review was done. Their analysis of toxicology reports from Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina showed that post mortem concentrations of thiopental in the blood were lower than that required for surgery in 43 of 49 executed inmates (88%); 21 (43%) inmates had concentrations consistent with awareness. This led the authors to conclude that a substantial probability existed that some of the inmates were aware and suffered extreme pain and distress during execution. The authors attributed the risk of consciousness among inmates to the lack of training and monitoring in the process, but carefully make no recommendations on how to alter the protocol or how to improve the process. Indeed, the authors conclude, [...] "because participation of doctors in protocol design or execution is ethically prohibited, adequate anesthesia cannot be certain. Therefore, to prevent unnecessary cruelty and suffering, cessation and public review of lethal injections is warranted." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{estimate}} of cooperative time presented {{below is a}} minimum estimate, since <b>data</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> originally collected {{with a focus on}} recording all cooperative activity. Short cooperative activities were especially unlikely to be recorded in field notes. For example, examination of videotapes from hunting episodes during the sample period reveals that very short cooperative activities are frequently embedded into longer hunting segments that we have not coded as cooperative time. [...] While pursuing monkeys, hunters often call to others to [...] "stay put", [...] "don't make noise", [...] "don't shoot", [...] "shake a branch", [...] "pound a vine" [...] etc. [...] Other multi-hunter pursuits contain numerous similar requests. [...] The recipient of such a command almost always complies immediately, at a cost to his own chances of making the kill. [...] These events were extremely common, but of very short duration (usually only 10 seconds or so) and are not included in the analyses. Aché men spent an average of 41 (s.e. 7) minutes per day in food acquisition activities scored as cooperative, and women spent 33 (s.e. 14) minutes per day cooperating in foraging. This represents about 10% of total foraging time in the men's sample, and 11% of total foraging time in the women's sample. [...] Both sexes show some sample days with more than 50% of total foraging time being spent helping other individuals to acquire resources.|$|E

On 23 March - after the Americans - Japan released its own fallout maps, compiled by Japanese authorities from measurements and predictions from the computer simulations of SPEEDI. On 19 June 2012 Minister of Science Hirofumi Hirano said that Japan would review the decision of the Science Ministry and the Nuclear-Safety Agency in 2011 to ignore the radiation maps provided by the United States. He defended his ministry's handling of the matter with the remark that its task was to measure radiation levels on land. But the government should reconsider its decision not to publish the maps or use the information.
