5000|$|Most {{doctoral}} {{health profession}} schools, such as medical and dental schools, require that students complete a practical (dissection) course in gross human anatomy. Such courses aim to educate students in basic human anatomy {{and seek to}} establish anatomical landmarks that may later be used to aid medical diagnosis. Many schools provide students with cadavers for investigation by dissection, aided by dissection manuals, as well as cadaveric atlases (e.g. Netter's, Rohen's). Medical schools have implemented on-screen anatomical lessons and tutorials to teach students surgical procedures. The use of technological visual aids and <b>gross</b> <b>dissection</b> are more effective together than either approach alone. Recently, online flashcards and quizzes {{have been used as}} well.

5000|$|The {{process of}} {{collecting}} and evaluating the biopsy specimens used to render these cancer diagnoses involves nearly 20 steps and numerous medical professionals {{from the time}} the sample is originally taken from the patient to the time it is received by pathology for analysis. [...] With such a complex process executed at a large scale, the potential for a variety of Specimen Provenance Complications is a serious concern for both physicians and patients. [...] While enforcement of strict protocols and procedures for the handling of samples helps to minimize error, identification issues in anatomic and clinical pathology labs still occur. The most common error is a mislabeled or unlabeled specimen. Another potential complication is the presence of a contaminant tissue fragment - commonly referred to as a floater - that does not belong to the patient being evaluated. Floaters can be introduced in the laboratory during tissue sectioning, processing or <b>gross</b> <b>dissection,</b> or potentially in a clinical setting as well when the biopsy is being performed.

Sample Population: Adult canine pelvic limbs (n= 17). Methods: Stifle joints from 12 dogs were examined by orthopedic and radiographic examination, synovial fluid analysis, and MRI performed using a 0. 2 T system. Limbs 1 to 7 were used to develop the MR and MR arthrography imaging protocol.

The {{distribution}} of facial sensory axons to the tongue and palate {{of the rat}} was determined {{in relation to the}} spatial {{distribution of}} taste buds. <b>Gross</b> <b>dissections</b> and serial reconstruction of silver-stained material revealed five divisions of the chorda-lingual nerve in the tongue and four divisions of the greater petrosal nerve in the palate. Axon counts were made in normal and de-efferented chorda tympani and greater petrosal nerves from montages of electron micrographs. De-efferented facial nerves were prepared by intracranial section of the nervus intermedius and motor root prior to sacrifice. Cell bodies were counted in the geniculate ganglion and the total number of axon profiles in the chorda tympani and greater petrosal nerves exceeded the number of ganglion cells by 30 %. The greater petrosal nerves con-tained about three times as many profiles as the chorda tympani nerves with the principal disparity among unmyelinated axons. Taste bud numbers on the palate and anterior tongue were nearly equivalent; however, their densities per unit of surface area varied 150 fold between regions. On the tongue, taste bud density seemed not to be correlated with the number of axons directed to a region as there was a nearly linear distribution of axons from the base to the apex. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Up {{till the}} 1840 s, <b>gross</b> <b>dissection</b> {{was the only}} method {{available}} to study the tracts and fascicles of the white matter of the human brain. This changed dramatically with the introduction by Stilling (1842, 1843, 1846) of the microscopy of serial sections and his demonstration of the discriminative power of this method. The decussation of the brachium conjunctivum (the superior cerebellar peduncle) (International Anatomical Terminology (1998)) originally {{was known as the}} horseshoe-shaped commissure ofWernekinck. The first use of this name and the first illustrations of this commissure date from a book by Wernekinck’s successor, Wilbrand (1840). Using <b>gross</b> <b>dissection,</b> he concluded that the commissure connects the dentate nucleus with the contralateral inferior olive. A few years later, Stilling (1846), using microscopy of serial sections through the human brain stem, illustrated the entire course of the brachium conjunctivum, its decussation, and its crossed ascending branch, up to the red nucleus. From his work, it became clear that Wernekinck and Wilbrand had included the central tegmental tract in their commissure, and that they had failed to identify its ascending branch...|$|E

40|$|TRAP {{translational}} profiling An additional {{point in}} considering {{the validity of the}} TRAP translational profiling methodology is that it makes use of BAC genetic targeting of the EGFP-L 10 a fusion protein to the cell type of interest. In the case of these and other BAC transgenic mice, other genes present on the BACs employed may be over-expressed, and the random insertion of the BAC DNA into the genome could conceivably result in phenotypic changes. In the case of our bacTRAP mice, our data reveal that the Sfxn 1 and Ttc 12 genes, which happen to be located on the Drd 1 a and Drd 2 BACs used, respectively, are overexpressed in the corresponding bacTRAP lines (and subsequently appear as enriched in either Drd 1 a or Drd 2 cells; see Table S 2). However, we observed no phenotypic effects in the bacTRAP mice. This is not surprising given that phenotypic effects that are reproducible between lines (and therefore due to genes present on the BAC) are exceedingly rare in BAC transgenic EGFP reporter lines (GENSAT project, unpublished data), presumably because the genes carried on the BACs are only mildly over-expressed. Given these considerations, and the very high percentage of striatally enriched mRNAs that could be successfully predicted from the analysis of pooled MSN bacTRAP data, we conclude that bacTRAP data collected here reflects the normal physiological states of the MSN populations. Another additional point {{in considering the}} validity of the TRAP methodology is that the precision of the translational profiles obtained in TRAP studies reflects both the specificity of expression of the BAC transgene, and accuracy of any <b>gross</b> <b>dissections</b> required for the desired analysis. For example, the Drd 1 a gene (Gaspar et al., 1995) and Drd 1 a BAC drive...|$|R
