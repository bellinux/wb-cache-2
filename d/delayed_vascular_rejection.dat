However, naturally occurring antibodies in human blood against the Galα 1 → 3 Gal antigen on pig endothelial cells lead to hyperacute or, if prevented, acute or <b>delayed</b> <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection</b> of the pig graft. The {{purpose of this study}} was therefore to evaluate synthetic oligosaccharides with terminal Galα 1 → 3 Gal to inhibit antigen-binding and cytotoxicity of anti-αGal antibodies against pig cells. Different oligosaccharides were synthesized chemically and by a combined chemico-enzymatic approach. These included monomeric di-, tri-, and pentasaccharides, a polyacrylamide-conjugate (PAA-Bdi), as well as di-, tetra-, and octamers of Galα 1 → 3 Gal. All were tested for inhibitory activity by anti-αGal ELISA and complement-dependent cytotoxicity tests. PAA-Bdi was the best inhibitor of binding as well as cytotoxicity of anti-αGal antibodies. Monomeric oligosaccharides efficiently prevented binding of anti-αGal IgG, but less well that of anti-αGal IgM, with tri- and pentasaccharides showing a better efficacy than the disaccharide. The two trisaccharides Galα 1 → 3 Galβ 1 → 4 GlcNAc and Galα 1 → 3 Galβ 1 → 3 GlcNAc were equally effective. Oligomers of Galα 1 → 3 Gal were more effective than monomers in blocking the binding of anti-αGal IgG. However, they could not block IgM binding, nor could they match the efficacy of PAA-Bdi. We conclude that oligosaccharides with terminal Galα 1 → 3 Gal, most effectively as PAA-conjugates, can prevent binding and cytotoxicity of human anti-αGal in vitro. The PAA-Bdi conjugate might be most suited for use as a Sepharose-bound immunoabsorption materia...|$|E

40|$|Acute humoral rejection, {{also known}} as acute <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection,</b> is a devastating {{condition}} of organ transplants and a major barrier to clinical application of organ xenotransplantation. Although initiation of acute humoral or <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection</b> is generally linked to the action of antibodies and complement on the graft, other factors such as ischemia, platelets, T cells, natural killer cells, and macrophages have also been implicated. Central to any understanding of the pathogenesis of acute humoral rejection, and to developing means of preventing it, is to know whether these factors injure the graft independently or through one or few pathways. We addressed this question by examining early events in a severe model of <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection</b> in which guinea pig hearts transplanted heterotopically into rats treated with cobra venom factor (CVF) develop disease over 72 hours.

40|$|Introduction: Acute <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection</b> {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{challenges}} in human allogenic organ transplantation. The aim of the treatment is the elimination of circulating de novo donor specific antibodies (DSA). The extracorporeal elimination of DSA with immunoadsorption is a specific and efficient treatment option. We report about our results with immunoadsorption for patients with acute <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection</b> after renal transplantation. Material and Methods: We retrospectively analysed the results of immunoadsorption in our transplantation centre. 365 renal transplantation were performed in Rostock centre between 2002 and 2009. In all cases of acute <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection</b> (n= 16), patients were treated with immunoadsorption. Extracorporeal elimination of antibodies was carried out with Ig TheraSorb® columns (Miltenyi, Germany). Results: Overall 89 sessions of immunoadsorption were performed in the 16 patients. The individual number of sessions ranged from 2 to 9 per patient (mean 5. 6). 12 / 16 patients showed improved graft function with a decrease of serum creatinine > 50 % (responders). The remaining 4 patients had only a marginal improvement of graft function (non-responders). The graft survival rate was significantly better in the responder group compared to non-responders. All grafts of the responder group except one show stable function (maximum follow up 60 months). There were no relevant side effects of the treatment. Conclusions: Immunoadsorption is an efficient treatment option for patients with acute <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection</b> after renal transplantation.

40|$|Following renal transplantation, {{immunosuppression}} {{is usually}} increased to treat presumed rejection episodes. However, a) many conditions mimic rejection in the post-transplant period, and b) many rejection episodes are irreversible. As increased immunosuppressive therapy {{is associated with}} an increased risk of infection, it would be ideal to limit antirejection therapy to only the rejection episodes that are reversible. The role of percutaneous allograft biopsy was studied as an aid to decide which patients to treat for rejection, to limit unnecessary immunosuppression and to predict allograft survival. One hundred thirty-five patients with suspected rejection underwent 206 allograft biopsies without complication. Two hundred four biopsies were available for study. Biopsies were coded on a 1 - 4 scale (minimal, mild, moderate, severe) for acute and chronic tubulointerstitial infiltrate and <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection,</b> as well as no rejection (e. g., recurrence of original disease). Treatment decisions were {{made on the basis of}} the biopsy combined with clinical data. All patients have been followed two years and outcome correlated with biopsy findings (death, nephrectomy, and return to dialysis defined as kidney loss). The results were the following: 1) biopsies represented changes within the kidney. Of 16 kidneys removed within one month of biopsy, no nephrectomy specimen showed less rejection than that seen on biopsy. 2) Eighty-one biopsies (39. 7 %) led to tapering or not increasing immunosuppression (either no rejection, minimal rejection, or irreversible changes). 3) Kidneys having either severe acute or chronic <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection</b> (less than 30 % function at three months) had significantly (p less than 0. 05) decreased survival three to 24 months postbiopsy than those with minimal or mild <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection</b> or tubulointerstitial infiltrate (83 % function at three months). 4) Kidneys with moderate chronic <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection</b> and those with severe acute tubulointerstitial infiltrate had significantly (p less than 0. 05) decreased survival at six to 24 months. 5) Kidneys with moderate chronic <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection</b> (MCV) without an acute infiltrate (ATI) had significantly better survival than those having both MCV and ATI. 6) Similarly, kidneys having severe ATI alone had better survival than those with ATI plus <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection.</b> It was concluded that a) percutaneous allograft biopsy can be done without graft loss or infection; b) biopsy represents changes throughout the kidney; c) biopsy aids in deciding when to treat for rejection and in deciding when to withhold increased immunosuppression, and d) allograft biopsy predicts the outcome of treatment of a rejection episode...|$|R

This pathologic picture {{may result from}} a disturbance in the coagulant or fibrinolytic pathways that regulate normal vascular patency. This study evaluated the regulation of fibrinolytic activity defined by tissue plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 as it may exist {{in the setting of}} acute <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS, RESULTS: Serial biopsies from cardiac xenotransplants evaluated by immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated progressive decreases in tissue plasminogen activator and increases in plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1. In vitro studies measuring fibrinolytic activity of cell culture medium from porcine aortic endothelial cells stimulated with human serum or autologous porcine serum revealed that human serum triggered as much as 93 % increase in antifibrinolytic activity. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that porcine vascular endothelial cells change toward an antifibrinolytic state following stimulation with human xenoreactive antibodies and complement. The shift is at least partly explained by an increased ratio of plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 to tissue plasminogen activator, and is at least in part mediated by the activation of complement.

40|$|Conventional {{ultrasound}} parameters {{like the}} Resistance Index (RI) or the graft volume are only of limited {{value for the}} ultrasound assessment of renal allografts in the early postoperative period. They have poor diagnostic specifity and limitations when assessing deep grafts or obese patients. In this prospective study the dynamics of ultrasound contrast media (USCM) in the postoperative renal allograft were studied and compared with conventional parameters for the first time. 48 consecutive recipients of renal allografts were examined using USCM between 4 to 10 days postoperatively or when acute graft rejection was suspected clinically. The inflow of USCM was measured at the renal artery, an interlobar artery, the renal cortex and the renal vein and then displayed as a time intensity curve (TIC). The time difference between the maximum intensity at the interlobar artery and the renal cortex (delta tpeak) and the ratio of TIC-increase between these two vascular territories (perfusion quotient, PQ) were established as parameters. The conventional sonography took place almost daily within {{the first two weeks}} postoperatively as part of clinical routine. Three patients were excluded from the study because of a segmental loss of perfusion of the allograft. 19 of the remaining patients had an uneventful clinical course (control group); their PQ was 1, 2 ± 0, 4. Seven patients with good graft function showed a large perirenal haematoma; these had a significantly higher PQ and a prolonged delta tpeak. The remaining patients were allocated to three different groups according to histological and clinical criteria: acute tubulus necrosis (ATN, n= 7), non <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection</b> (n= 7) and <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection</b> (n= 5). Determination of RI could not differentiate reliably between these groups. The patients with ATN (PQ= 1. 6 ± 0. 7) and non <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection</b> (PQ= 1. 1 ± 0. 6) did not differ significantly from the control group. Patients suffering from <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection</b> showed a markedly increased PQ (2. 2 ± 0. 8, p< 0. 05). All three groups showed a prolonged delta tpeak compared to the control group; this difference was only significant in group ATN though. With a cut-off value of 1. 72 we found a specifity of 95 % and a sensitivity of 80 % for an increased PQ as a diagnostic test for <b>vascular</b> allograft <b>rejection.</b> In two cases a loss of perfusion was only detected after the application of USCM. The demarcation of a perirenal haematoma was noted to be markedly improved by USCM in five out of seven cases.

Perirenal haematoma, ATN and <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection</b> are associated with characteristic changes in the dynamics of USCM.

Since chemokines play pivotal roles in this process, our prospective study was performed to evaluate further {{the role of the}} chemokine receptor CXCR 3. METHODS: A total of 138 biopsies were included from patients without rejection and unaltered morphology (according to Banff 97 classification grade 1, n = 49), with acute interstitial rejection (Banff grade 4 type I, n = 8), with acute <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection</b> (Banff grade 4 type II, n = 23), with chronic allograft nephropathy (Banff grade 5, n = 16), without rejection but with various other lesions (Banff grade 6, n = 36) and from pre-transplant kidneys (n = 6). The expression of CXCR 3 -, CD 4 - and CD 8 -positive cells was localized by immunohistochemistry and quantified by image analysis. RESULTS: CXCR 3 was expressed by infiltrating inflammatory cells, but not by intrinsic renal structures. CXCR 3 -positive cells were found to be {{involved in}} tubulitis and <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection.</b> The area of CXCR 3 -positive staining was significantly larger in biopsies with acute interstitial rejection (P< 0. 001) and acute <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection</b> (P< 0. 001) as compared with normal renal graft biopsies.

40|$|Platelet-derived {{growth factor}} (PDGF) exists as a dimer {{composed}} of two homologous but distinct peptides termed PDGF-A and -B chains, and may exist as AA, AB, and BB isoforms. The PDGF-B chain has been implicated as a mediator of renal <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection</b> by virtue of up-regulated expression of its receptor, PDGF beta-receptor, in affected arteries. A role for PDGF-A chain in mediating intimal proliferation has been suggested in human atherosclerosis (Rekhter MD, Gordon D: Does platelet-derived growth factor-A chain stimulate proliferation of arterial mesenchymal cells in human atherosclerotic plaques? Circ Res 1994, 75 : 410), but no studies of this molecule in human renal allograft injury {{have been reported to}} date. We used two polyclonal antisera to detect expression of PDGF-A chain and one monoclonal antibody to detect PDGF-B chain by immunohistochemistry in fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue from 1) normal adult kidneys, 2) a series of renal transplant biopsies chosen to emphasize features of <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection,</b> and 3) allograft nephrectomies. Immunohistochemistry was correlated with in situ hybridization on adjacent, formalin fixed tissue sections from nephrectomies utilizing riboprobes made from PDGF-A and -B chain cDNA. PDGF-A chain is widely expressed by medial smooth muscle cells of normal and rejecting renal arterial vessels of all sizes by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. PDGF-A chain is also expressed by a population of smooth muscle cells (shown by double immunolabeling with an antibody to alpha-smooth muscle actin) comprising the intima in chronic <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection.</b> In arteries demonstrating acute rejection, up-regulated expression of PDGF-A chain by endothelial cells was detected by both immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. In contrast, PDGF-B chain was identified principally in infiltrating monocytes within the rejecting arteries, similar to its localization in infiltrating monocytes in human atherosclerosis. Although less prominent than the case for PDGF-A chain, PDGF-B chain also was present in medial and intimal smooth muscle cells in both rejecting and nonrejecting renal arteries. PDGF-A and -B chains have now been localized at both the mRNA and protein levels to the intimal proliferative lesions of <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection.</b> These peptides, which are known stimuli for smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation in experimental vascular injury, may have similar stimulatory effects on smooth muscle cells in an autocrine and/or paracrine manner to promote further intimal expansion and lesion progression in this form of human vasculopathy...|$|R

To determine the effect of allograft rejection on left ventricular mass, we retrospectively reviewed endomyocardial biopsy results and corresponding echocardiograms in 41 cardiac transplant recipients undergoing treatment for allograft rejection. Left ventricular mass was assessed by two-dimensional echocardiography using the method of Schiller. Maintenance immunosuppression included cyclosporine in all patients. Results. Although significant changes in left ventricular wall thickness, mass and dimensions were not observed in patients experiencing moderate or severe cellular allograft rejection (International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation grades III and IV, n = 27), marked changes were noted in patients with <b>vascular</b> (humoral) <b>rejection</b> (n = 14). Patients with <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection</b> demonstrated an echocardiographic mean (±SEM) increase in left ventricular wall mass (from 109 ± 17 to 151 ± 17 g), and left ventricular wall thickness (from 1. 3 ± 0. 1 to 1. 6 ± 0. 1 cm) during the <b>rejection</b> episode. Additionally, <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection</b> was associated with a trend toward an increase in left ventricular systolic dimension (from 2. 6 ± 0. 1 to 3. 0 ± 0. 2 cm) and a decrease in left ventricular fractional shortening and increased incidence of hemodynamic compromise with rejection (50 % for vascular vs. 11 % for cellular rejection).

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{quality of}} a damaged kidney, the {{complexity}} of the surgery, and the events in the first weeks after transplantation, such as delayed graft function (DGF) and acute rejection, may influence its histological appearance and long-term survival. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the importance of these factors in predicting renal allograft histology at 3 months. METHODS: Prospective, protocol kidney biopsy specimens (n= 112), obtained 3 months after transplantation, were scored for chronic damage by the Banff schema and evaluated by multivariate analysis against donor factors, implantation histology, prior recipient sensitization, ischemia, perioperative factors, and subsequent clinical events, such as DGF and acute rejection. RESULTS: Adequate samples were obtained in 102 of 112 biopsies and classified as chronic Banff grade 0 (n= 22), grade I (n= 56), grade II (n= 23), or grade III (n= 1). Acute Banff scores were minimal. DGF occurred in 49 % and was the strongest predictor of tubulointerstitial damage at 3 months. DGF correlated with acute tubular necrosis on the implantation biopsy specimen and with the number of acute rejection episodes; DGF also correlated with the Banff grades of chronic glomerulitis, chronic interstitial fibrosis, and tubular atrophy scores (P< 0. 05 - 0. 001) in the 3 -month biopsy specimen. By multivariate analysis, chronic tubular atrophy was independently predicted by the presence of vascular disease in the donor biopsy specimen, DGF, and <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection</b> occurring within the first 3 months (P< 0. 05 - 0. 001). Chronic interstitial fibrosis was unrelated to fibrosis in the donor biopsy specimen but was independently predicted by DGF, donor age, and <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection</b> (P< 0. 05 - 0. 001). Vascular disease in the donor biopsy specimen correlated with chronic intimal thickening (r= 0. 36, P< 0. 01) and arteriolar hyalinosis score (r= 0. 54, P< 0. 001) on the 3 -month biopsy specimen. Banff chronic intimal vascular thickening was independently predicted by donor biopsy specimen vascular grade, prior <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection</b> episodes, and renal cold ischemia time (P< 0. 05 - 0. 01). There were no correlates with the mean cyclosporine (CsA) dose, blood levels, diagnosis of CsA toxicity, or cellular rejection within the first 3 months.

The occurrence of acute rejection is associated with an ongoing increased risk of graft loss, particularly if that episode occurred late or included <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection.</b> The reduced rates of rejection have not been associated with improved graft survival...|$|R
50|$|Also {{known as}} delayed xenoactive {{rejection}}, {{this type of}} rejection occurs in discordant xenografts within 2 to 3 days, if hyperacute rejection is prevented. The process is much more complex than hyperacute rejection and is currently not completely understood. Acute <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection</b> requires de novo protein synthesis and is driven by interactions between the graft endothelial cells and host antibodies, macrophages, and platelets. The response is characterized by an inflammatory infiltrate of mostly macrophages and natural killer cells (with small numbers of T cells), intravascular thrombosis, and fibrinoid necrosis of vessel walls.|$|R
50|$|If hyperacute {{and acute}} <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection</b> are avoided {{accommodation}} is possible, {{which is the}} survival of the xenograft despite the presence of circulating XNAs. The graft is given a break from humoral rejection when the complement cascade is interrupted, circulating antibodies are removed, or their function is changed, or there is a change in the expression of surface antigens on the graft. This allows the xenograft to up-regulate and express protective genes, which aid in resistance to injury, such as heme oxygenase-1 (an enzyme that catalyzes the degradation of heme).|$|R

This study {{was performed to}} analyze the expression, distribution and cellular localization of CX 3 CR 1 in human renal transplant biopsies and to assess its role as potential diagnostic and prognostic marker. CX 3 CR 1 was prospectively analyzed in 174 renal graft biopsies from patients with normal morphology (n= 76), antibody-mediated acute rejection (n= 6), acute tubulointerstitial rejection (n= 27), acute <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection</b> (n= 31), and with acute tubulus necrosis (n= 34). Double immunofluorescence was additionally performed for CX 3 CR 1 and CD 4, CD 8, CD 20, CD 68, and CD 209 /DC-SIGN. The number of CX 3 CR 1 positive interstitial cells was significantly higher in the biopsies with acute tubulointerstitial and acute <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection</b> as compared to normal renal allograft biopsies. CX 3 CR 1 positive cells were mainly CD 68 positive monocytes/macrophages and CD 209 /DC-SIGN positive dendritic cells. The percentage of the CX 3 CR 1 positive staining area was a predictor for steroid responsiveness and for worse clinical outcome 3 and 12 months after transplantation. CX 3 CR 1 positive macrophages and/or dendritic cells are significantly elevated in acute renal allograft rejection. As CX 3 CR 1 was associated with outcome parameters, {{it has to be}} further evaluated as a prognostic marker in human renal transplantation...|$|R
40|$|Whether {{antibody}} blockage of leukocyte receptors for intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 and {{vascular cell}} adhesion molecule- 1 would prevent cardiac graft rejection was studied in a rabbit heterotopic transplant model. Monoclonal antibody 60. 3, anti-CD 18 (intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 receptor, Group 1, n = 10) and monoclonal antibody HP 1 / 2, anti-VLA-alpha 4 (vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1 receptor, Group 2, n = 10) {{were administered to}} transplanted unimmunosuppressed animals. At 7 days, donor heart histology was compared to transplanted untreated controls (Group 3, n = 11). Peripheral {{white blood cell counts}} on postoperative day 2 were significantly higher in both treatment groups than controls. Significant increases in circulating neutrophils occurred in Group 1 (P < or = 0. 05); lymphocytes predominated in Group 2 (P < or = 0. 05). A significant reduction in cellular rejection was seen in Group 1 (P < or = 0. 05) but not Group 2 hearts. Group 1 hearts demonstrated localization of lymphocytes to perivenular collections, whereas Group 2 hearts evidenced diffuse interstitial infiltration. Both treatment groups demonstrated a reduction in transplant arteritis compared to controls. Results suggest that monoclonal antibody 60. 3 (anti-CD 18) may hold promise as a therapeutic agent for both cellular and <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection.</b> Monoclonal antibody HP 1 / 2 (anti-VLA-alpha 4) may reduce <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection</b> disproportionate to cellular rejection...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAcute <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection</b> (AVR) is {{characterized}} by immune-mediated vascular injury and heightened endothelial cell (EC) apoptosis. We reported previously that apoptotic ECs release a bioactive C-terminal fragment of perlecan referred to as LG 3. Here, we tested the possibility that LG 3 behaves as a neoantigen, fuelling the production of anti-LG 3 antibodies of potential importance in regulating allograft vascular injury. We performed a case-control study in which we compared anti-LG 3 IgG titers in kidney transplant recipients with AVR (n= 15) versus those with acute tubulo-interstitial rejection (ATIR) (n= 15) or stable graft function (n= 30). Patients who experienced AVR had elevated anti-LG 3 titers pre and posttransplantation compared to subjects with ATIR or stable graft function (p< 0. 05 for both mediators). Elevated pretransplant anti-LG 3 titers (OR: 4. 62, 95 % CI: 1. 08 - 19. 72) and pretransplant donor-specific antibodies (DSA) (OR 4. 79, 95 % CI: 1. 03 - 22. 19) were both independently associated with AVR. To address the functional role of anti-LG 3 antibodies in AVR, we turned to passive transfer of anti-LG 3 antibodies in an animal model of <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection</b> based on orthotopic aortic transplantation between fully MHC-mismatched mice. Neointima formation, C 4 d deposition and allograft inflammation were significantly increased in recipients of an ischemic aortic allograft passively transferred with anti-LG 3 antibodies. Collectively, these data identify anti-LG 3 antibodies as novel accelerators of immune-mediated vascular injury and obliterative remodeling...|$|R
40|$|Lung {{transplantation}} {{remains the}} only therapeutic option for many patients suffering from end-stage pulmonary disease. Long-term success after lung transplantation is severely limited {{by the development of}} bronchiolitis obliterans. The murine heterotopic tracheal transplantation model has been widely used for studies investigating pathogenesis of obliterative airway disease and immunosuppressive strategies to prevent its development. Despite its utility, this model employs proximal airway that lacks airflow and is not vascularized. We have developed a novel model of orthotopic vascularized lung transplantation in the mouse, which leads to severe <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection</b> in allogeneic strain combinations. Here we characterize differences in the fate of airway epithelial cells in nonimmunosuppressed heterotopic tracheal and vascularized lung allograft models over 28 days. Up-regulation of growth factors that are thought to be critical for the development of airway fibrosis and interstitial collagen deposition were similar in both models. However, while loss of airway epithelial cells occurred in the tracheal model, airway epithelium remained intact and fully differentiated in lung allografts, despite profound <b>vascular</b> <b>rejection.</b> Moreover, we demonstrate expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl- 2 in airway epithelial cells of acutely rejected lung allografts. These findings suggest that in addition to alloimmune responses, other stimuli may be required for the destruction of airway epithelial cells. Thus, the model of vascularized mouse lung transplantation may provide a new and more physiologic experimental tool to study the interaction between immune and nonimmune mechanisms affecting airway pathology in lung allografts...|$|R
