5|$|As {{part of the}} U.S. {{national}} defenses, {{to support}} military transport, the National Highway System was expanded with Interstate highways, beginning in 1955, across {{many parts of the}} United States. The wider, multi-lane highways allowed traffic to move at faster speeds, with <b>few</b> <b>or</b> no stoplights on the way. The wide-open spaces along the highways became a basis for numerous billboards showing advertisements.|$|E

5|$|The United States {{is home to}} {{numerous}} music festivals, which showcase styles ranging from the blues and jazz to indie rock and heavy metal. Some music festivals are strictly local in scope, including <b>few</b> <b>or</b> no performers with a national reputation, and are generally operated by local promoters. The large recording companies operate their own music festivals, such as Lollapalooza and Ozzfest, which draw huge crowds.|$|E

5|$|Three small moons orbit between Mimas and Enceladus: Methone, Anthe, and Pallene. Named {{after the}} Alkyonides of Greek mythology, they {{are some of}} the {{smallest}} moons in the Saturn system.

The null hypothesis is not rejected. Because of the extremely small sample size, this sample has low power to detect a difference.|$|R
5|$|Hailing from Pomona, California, {{the members}} of Bonded by Blood met through mutual friends. The idea of {{creating}} a band was conceived by lead vocalist Jose Barrales, a singer with hardcore punk and crossover thrash backgrounds, influenced by groups like The Blackheads, Cryptic Slaughter, D.R.I. and Black Flag. He always had an appreciation for heavy metal music, {{but it was not}} until a friend recommended him to listen to Exodus that Barrales got into the thrash metal subgenre. Exodus' debut album Bonded by Blood had a profound impact on Barrales, and it was inspiring to the point he idealized the creation of a thrash metal band, as he had noticed that there were <b>few</b> <b>or</b> even no groups in this genre in the music scene.|$|E
5|$|Old Louisville is a {{historic}} district and neighborhood in central Louisville, Kentucky, USA. It is the third largest such district in the United States, and the largest preservation district featuring almost entirely Victorian architecture. It is also unique in {{that a majority of}} its structures are made of brick, and the neighborhood contains the highest concentration of residential homes with stained glass windows in the U.S. Many of the buildings are in the Victorian-era styles of Romanesque, Queen Anne, Italianate, among others; and a large number of blocks have had <b>few</b> <b>or</b> no buildings razed. There are also several 20th-century buildings from 15 to 20 stories.|$|E
5|$|Paracetamol poisoning, {{also known}} as {{acetaminophen}} poisoning, is caused by excessive use of the medication paracetamol (acetaminophen). Most people have <b>few</b> <b>or</b> non-specific symptoms in the first 24hours following overdose. This may include feeling tired, abdominal pain, or nausea. This is typically followed {{by a couple of}} days without any symptoms after which yellowish skin, blood clotting problems, and confusion occurs. Additional complications may include kidney failure, pancreatitis, low blood sugar, and lactic acidosis. If death does not occur, people tend to recover fully over a couple of weeks. Without treatment some cases will resolve while others will result in death.|$|E

5|$|Several {{collisions}} {{have occurred}} on Washington Metro, resulting in injuries and fatalities, along with numerous derailments with <b>few</b> <b>or</b> no injuries. WMATA {{has been criticized}} for disregarding safety warnings and advice from experts. The Tri-State Oversight Committee oversaw WMATA, but had no regulatory authority. Metro's safety department is usually in charge of investigating incidents, but could not require other Metro departments to implement its recommendations. Following several safety lapses, the Federal Transit Administration assumed oversight at WMATA.|$|E
5|$|Spores are thin-walled, smooth, and {{ellipsoidal}} or oval in shape. Viewed with a microscope, {{they appear}} translucent (hyaline), and stain red or blue with Melzer's reagent (in amyloid). Their dimensions are typically 7–10 by 5–7µm; the spores contain a single large oil droplet. The spore-bearing cells, the basidia, are club-shaped, two- to four-spored, and 25–30 by 5–7µm. The presence of sterile cells called pleurocystidia (large cells {{found on the}} gill face in some mushrooms) is uncommon; specimens may contain <b>few</b> <b>or</b> abundant cheilocystidia (large sterile cells found on the gill edge) that are club-shaped, thin-walled and 39–87.5 by 8.5–16µm in size.|$|E
5|$|The Bohemian waxwing (Bombycilla garrulus) is a starling-sized {{passerine}} {{bird that}} breeds {{in the northern}} forests of Eurasia and North America. It has mainly buff-grey plumage, black face markings and a pointed crest. Its wings are patterned with white and bright yellow, and some feather tips have the red waxy appearance that give this species its English name. The three subspecies show only minor differences in appearance. Females are similar to males, although young birds are less well-marked and have <b>few</b> <b>or</b> no waxy wingtips. Although the Bohemian waxwing's range overlaps those of the cedar and Japanese waxwings, it is easily distinguished from them by size and plumage differences.|$|E

5|$|The Chicken Big King {{was added}} April 2014. This new {{variation}} on the original Big King sandwich {{was part of a}} corporate menu restructuring that began the previous year. This was part of Burger King CEO Alex Macedo's plan to introduce simpler products that require <b>few</b> <b>or</b> no new ingredients in order to simplify operations. This new sandwich uses the company's existing Crispy Chicken Jr patty in place of the beef and adds an extra layer of King sauce to ensure that the product stays moist.|$|E
5|$|The Collins-class {{submarines}} {{experienced a}} wide range of problems during their construction and early service life. Many of these were attributed to the submarines being a new, untested design, and were successfully addressed as they were discovered. Most systems and features worked with <b>few</b> <b>or</b> no problems, while the boats' maximum speed, manoeuvrability, and low-speed submerged endurance were found to exceed specifications. The ship control system, which during development had been marked as a major potential problem, functioned beyond positive expectation: for example, the autopilot (which aboard Collins was nicknamed 'Sven') was found to be better at maintaining depth during snorting than most helmsmen.|$|E
5|$|The Metroid series {{contains}} gameplay {{elements from}} shooter, platformer, and adventure games. The series is notable for its non-linear progression and solitary exploration format where the player only controls Samus Aran, with <b>few</b> <b>or</b> no other characters to interact with. The series {{has been a}} 2D side-scroller in all its incarnations until the Metroid Prime series changed the perspective to a first-person perspective, leading to a new first-person shooter element. The player gains items and power-ups for Samus's cybernetic suit primarily through exploration, and occasionally by defeating alien creatures through real-time combat with the suit's arm cannon. Many such upgrades enable further avenues of exploration. A recurring upgrade is the Morph Ball, which allows Samus to curl into a ball, roll into tight places and plant bombs.|$|E

5|$|The four {{terrestrial}} or inner planets have dense, rocky compositions, <b>few</b> <b>or</b> no moons, and no ring systems. They {{are composed}} largely of refractory minerals, {{such as the}} silicates, which form their crusts and mantles, and metals, such as iron and nickel, which form their cores. Three of the four inner planets (Venus, Earth and Mars) have atmospheres substantial enough to generate weather; all have impact craters and tectonic surface features, such as rift valleys and volcanoes. The term inner planet {{should not be confused}} with inferior planet, which designates those planets that are closer to the Sun than Earth is (i.e. Mercury and Venus).|$|E
5|$|The initial {{symptoms}} {{are followed by}} a stage called clinical latency, asymptomatic HIV, or chronic HIV. Without treatment, this second stage of {{the natural history of}} HIV infection can last from about three years to over 20years (on average, about eight years). While typically there are <b>few</b> <b>or</b> no symptoms at first, near the end of this stage many people experience fever, weight loss, gastrointestinal problems and muscle pains. Between 50 and 70% of people also develop persistent generalized lymphadenopathy, characterized by unexplained, non-painful enlargement of more than one group of lymph nodes (other than in the groin) for over three to six months.|$|E
