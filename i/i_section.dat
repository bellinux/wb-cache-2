5|$|Governor Lane {{kept the}} legal {{code of the}} {{dissolved}} provisional government, only immediately repealing the law authorizing the minting of the Beaver Coins, as this was incompatible with the United States Constitution (Article <b>I,</b> <b>Section</b> 8).

Once the government was dissolved in 1849, all the laws remained in effect, except for the one that authorized the minting of coins. Territorial Governor Joseph Lane nullified that law, because it was in conflict with Article <b>I,</b> <b>Section</b> 8 of the United States Constitution, giving Congress the sole right to coin money, thus ending production of the Beaver Coins.|$|E
