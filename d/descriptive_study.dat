25|$|A study {{conducted}} in 2008 found that 11,739 homeschooled students, on average, scored 37 percentile points above {{public school students}} on standardized achievement tests. This {{is consistent with the}} 1999 Rudner study. However, Rudner said that these same students in public school may have scored just as well because of the dedicated parents they had. The Ray study also found that homeschooled students who had a certified teacher as a parent scored one percentile lower than homeschooled students who did not have a certified teacher as a parent. Another nationwide <b>descriptive</b> <b>study</b> conducted by Ray contained students ranging from ages 5–18 and he found that homeschoolers scored at least 80th percentile on their tests.|$|E
25|$|In 1927, Charles Elton {{published}} an influential synthesis {{on the use}} of food webs, which resulted in them becoming a central concept in ecology. In 1966, interest in food webs increased after Robert Paine's experimental and <b>descriptive</b> <b>study</b> of intertidal shores, suggesting that food web complexity was key to maintaining species diversity and ecological stability. Many theoretical ecologists, including Sir Robert May and Stuart Pimm, were prompted by this discovery and others to examine the mathematical properties of food webs. According to their analyses, complex food webs should be less stable than simple food webs. The apparent paradox between the complexity of food webs observed in nature and the mathematical fragility of food web models is currently an area of intensive study and debate. The paradox may be due partially to conceptual differences between persistence of a food web and equilibrial stability of a food web.|$|E

The same year, the CCD Working Group published a comprehensive <b>descriptive</b> <b>study</b> that concluded: [...] "Of the 61 variables quantified (including adult bee physiology, pathogen loads, and pesticide levels), no single factor was found with enough consistency to suggest one causal agent. Bees in CCD colonies had higher pathogen loads and were co-infected with more pathogens than control populations, suggesting either greater pathogen exposure or reduced defenses in CCD bees." ...|$|E

30|$|Abolghassemi Fakhree et al., Habibi et al., Sanson-Fisher et al. and Bittar et al. {{have pointed}} {{to the fact that}} methodologically, <b>descriptive</b> <b>studies</b> have been the most used method by Iranian {{researchers}} and also studies performed worldwide (Sanson-Fisher et al. 2006; Habibi et al. 2010; Bittar et al. 2011; Abolghassemi Fakhree & Jouyban 2011). The reason is that the idea of such researches are more easily shaped in mind, the stages are performed more quickly and are published more conveniently. In addition, <b>descriptive</b> <b>studies,</b> which may be an analysis of a large data collection, with a higher applicability for the researcher in comparison to a study carried out on the community, are inexpensive and are more possible to reach the wrap-up. Although <b>descriptive</b> <b>studies</b> may for example give valuable information regarding the health pattern and its determining factors, they can not provide direct evidence about the state of change. Sanson-Fisher believed that a high number of <b>descriptive</b> <b>studies</b> is not ideal and research organizations should pay attention to these studies’ findings cautiously in policy making (Sanson-Fisher et al. 2006).|$|R
