5|$|After World War I, Girdap was {{deprived}} of its government protections, {{as it had}} no links to the new agrarian government of Aleksandar Stamboliyski. In 1919 Boncho Bonev was imprisoned in Berkovitsa for eight months before he was acquitted, Ivan Kovachev was put on trial, and the bank's funds were sealed. In 1922, the Bulgarian National Bank closed Girdap's account, causing 38 million leva of deposits in Girdap to be withdrawn by 1923 and its debtors (including members of Girdap's management) to protest their bills. While {{at the time the}} Bulgarian National Bank, Girdap's most important creditor, was opposed to Girdap's <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>bankruptcy,</b> it reversed its stance two years later. Girdap was declared bankrupt on 3 February 1925 and its managers Boncho Boev, Ivan Kovachev and Nikola Kovachev were arrested.|$|E

5000|$|Not content, in {{the spring}} of 1778 Gallini {{attempted}} to buy the opera at the King's Theatre, Haymarket. Xenophobia against him coalesced into a bidding war won by Richard Brinsley Sheridan and Thomas Harris, who paid the outlandish price of £22,000 for the enterprise (all of it borrowed). Unfamiliar with opera, they began losing large sums; meanwhile, Gallini embarked on an aggressive campaign to force them out. After seven years of transfers <b>of</b> authority, forced <b>declarations</b> <b>of</b> <b>bankruptcy,</b> feuding trustees, and sheriff's sales, he achieved his wish, though the conditions were far from ideal. He served as trustee for William Taylor, who loathed him, harassed him, and sued him year after year, and he had to operate under a budget cap of £18,000 enforced by the court of chancery. The lord chamberlain, who regarded him as an undesirable foreigner, made him struggle to get a licence to perform.|$|R
40|$|While an {{increasing}} number of countries have embraced auctions to assign radio frequency, many other countries have decided to retain selection by the administration. Of the many factors that might have influenced those countries that have rejected auctions, one of the most visible in Europe has been frequent media reports of the problems experienced with auctions in the US between 1995 and 1997. In my experience, these reports have been accepted at face value by many European industry commentators and policy officials. It seems clear that the repeated reporting of these problems has influenced the evolution of spectrum management policy in Europe. This paper tries {{to set the record straight}} by providing an analysis of the problems that were reported in Europe regarding US spectrum auctions, specifically the <b>declarations</b> <b>of</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> by several winning bidders and overbidding by participants, the enormous revenue shortfall on the WCS block auction, and reports of collusion among bidders. ...|$|R

50|$|As {{opposed to}} the {{treasury}} of grace from which believers can make withdrawals, in Lutheranism salvation becomes a <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> spiritual <b>bankruptcy,</b> in which penitents acknowledge the inadequacy of their own resources and trust only in God to save them. Accepting Augustine's concern for legal justification as the base metaphor for salvation, the believers {{are not so much}} made righteous in Lutheranism as they are considered covered by Christ's righteousness. Acknowledging that they have no power to make themselves righteous, the penalty for their sins is discharged because Jesus has already paid for it with his blood. His righteousness is credited to those who believe in and thus belong to him.|$|R

25|$|Due to the {{expansion}} of Circuit City stores in the 1970s-1990s, the company accumulated a surplus of unused real estate with a presence in nearly every major market in the country. Although a typical retail location is approximately 30,000 square feet (2700 m²), the company had numerous freestanding and in-line locations ranging from 2,000 to 50,000 square feet (180 to 4500 m²), and had surplus office, service and distribution locations scattered across the country. During Circuit City's 2005 fiscal year (March 1, 2004 through February 28, 2005), the company disposed of approximately 1.2 million square feet (108,000 m²) of vacant retail space. In January 2007, Circuit City's vice president for real estate announced plans to open 200–300 stores in the next two years, a large increase from the current trend of 10–12 stores a year. Due to the economic conditions the company faced, they did not reach that goal. Many of these stores, however, did open in 2008 and operated for only a few weeks before closing. Some were built and never opened and upon the company's <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>bankruptcy,</b> it was discovered that large expenditures were due to paying leases on buildings that were not even opened to the public.|$|E

30|$|The {{extensive}} philanthropic, non-profit, community-based, grassroots, {{public and}} private sector efforts were mobilised in the frames of the DFC strategy to stop urban decline and realise an equitable, prosperous and sustainable Detroit of the future. The redevelopment strategy that advocated for {{the transformation of the}} urban crisis into a promising post-industrial experiment had to acknowledge that reviving Detroit’s manufacturing base was unrealistic, and that the formerly prioritised physical upgrading of the built environment would not lure either jobs or residents back. However, the city administration in Detroit was in no position to admit that the industrial sector was economically unsustainable and “did not heed the wake-up call of declining population until {{it got to the point}} of bankruptcy” (Khan 2013). For this reason, <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> municipal <b>bankruptcy</b> could be considered the most important response to Detroit’s urban decline. On the one hand, bankruptcy showed that the power relations were forcing the city to abandon its path dependency and seek new development perspectives. On the other hand, it was also confirmation from the local officials and elites that decades of decline couldn’t be reversed through simple implementation of any of the standard neoliberal policies. The need to adopt an innovative perspective for Detroit’s future required a strategy based on stabilisation, recovery, and irreversible degrowth. This would be an admission of the grim reality that the city would not recover its industrial fame, something that Schindler (2016) termed ‘degrowth machine politics’.|$|R

This forced an eventual [...] <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>bankruptcy.</b> The public's desire to travel by interurban diminished as the Depression deepened, plus more roads were being paved with more cars driven on them.

Elder was able to keep the system virtually intact for four more years with increasing income from freight. The IR was operating about [...] of interurban lines throughout Indiana during this period. [...] In 1936, IR actually showed an operating profit: the only time in its history that it did so. [...] In that year, the IR found it necessary in order to maintain an essential freight business to Dayton, brought under its control the Dayton and Western, which it leased for two years. This continued its valuable freight link to the very active Cincinnati and Lake Erie Ohio interurban which ran from Cincinnati through Dayton to Toledo and east to Cleveland using the Lake Shore Electric interurban. The IR and the C moved much freight at the time to Cleveland. When the Lakeshore Electric was abandoned, severing the ability to ship to Cleveland, the C soon stopped running too. The Dayton and Western provided a connection from the IR to the C Eventually, the IR did not have the funds to continue to lease the D The lease was dropped, the D shut down, and the important freight connection was lost.|$|E
