5000|$|<b>Hex</b> <b>socket</b> <b>screw</b> {{heads are}} usually made by {{stamping}} {{the head with}} a die, plastically deforming the metal. Other ways to generate the hex socket include linear broaching and rotary broaching. Broaching the heads with a linear broach is essentially the metalworking analog of mortising wood with a mortising machine; a hole is drilled and then the corners are broached out. This operation often leaves little telltale curled chips still attached {{at the bottom of the}} socket. These are negligible for most applications.|$|E
5000|$|Extant records suggest (without {{offering}} exhaustive documentation) {{that the}} idea of a <b>hex</b> <b>socket</b> <b>screw</b> drive was probably conceived as early as the 1860s to the 1890s, but that such screws were probably not manufactured until around 1910. Rybczynski (2000) describes a flurry of patents for alternative drive types in the 1860s to the 1890s in the US, which are confirmed to include internal-wrenching square and triangle types (that is, square and triangular sockets) (...) , but he explains that these were patented but not manufactured due to the difficulties and expense of doing so at the time. P. L. Robertson, of Milton, Ontario, Canada, first commercialised the square socket in 1908, having perfected and patented a manufacturing method (cold-forming, using the right material and the right die design).|$|E

5000|$|A can wrench is {{a wrench}} made {{to open a}} {{telephone}} distribution terminal also called a telco can or demarcation point box. One end of the can wrench is a 7/16 inch <b>hex</b> <b>socket</b> used for recessed fasteners on closures, and the other end is a 3/8 inch <b>hex</b> <b>socket</b> for use on binding posts. The wrench is {{also referred to as}} a 216C tool which was the Bell System specification version. They are often insulated against electric shock.

5000|$|In his autobiography, {{the founder}} of the Standard Pressed Steel Company (SPS; now SPS Technologies, Inc.), Howard T.

This account from Hallowell does not mention the Allen patent of 1910, nor the Allen safety set screw product line. Hallowell does describe, however, the same inspiration also mentioned in connection with Allen for a wave of adoption of the <b>hex</b> <b>socket</b> head, beginning with set screws and followed by cap screws. This was an industrial safety campaign, part of the larger Progressive Movement, to get headless set screws onto the pulleys and shafts of the line shafting that was ubiquitous in factories of the day. The headless set screws {{would be less likely to}} catch the clothing of workers and pull them into injurious contact with the running shaft.|$|R

40|$|Background The {{removal of}} well-fixed {{acetabular}} components following THA (total hip arthroplasty) {{is a difficult}} operation and could be accompanied {{by the loss of}} acetabular bone stock. The optimal method for fixation is still under debate. The aim of this pilot study was to compare the tear-out resistance and failure behavior between osseo-integrated and non-integrated screw cups. Furthermore, we examined whether there are differences in the properties mentioned between <b>screw</b> <b>sockets</b> and cemented polyethylene cups. Hypothesis Tear-out resistance and related mechanical work required for the tear-out of osseo-integrated <b>screw</b> <b>sockets</b> are higher than in non-integrated <b>screw</b> <b>sockets.</b> Patients and methods Ten human coxal bones from six cadavers with osseo-integrated <b>screw</b> <b>sockets</b> (n = 4), non-integrated (implanted post-mortem, n = 3) <b>screw</b> <b>sockets</b> and cemented polyethylene cups (n = 3) were used for tear-out testing. The parameters axial failure load and mechanical work for tear-out were introduced as measures for determining the stability of acetabular components following THA. Results The osseo-integrated <b>screw</b> <b>sockets</b> yielded slightly higher tear-out resistance (1. 61 ± 0. 26 kN) and related mechanical work compared to the non-integrated <b>screw</b> <b>sockets</b> (1. 23 ± 0. 39 kN, P = 0. 4). The cemented polyethylene cups yielded the lowest tear-out resistance with a failure load of 1. 18 ± 0. 24 kN. Compared to the screw cups implanted while alive, they also differ on a non-significant level (P = 0. 1). Osseous failure patterns differed especially for the <b>screw</b> <b>sockets</b> compared to the cemented polyethylene cups. Discussion Osseo-integration did not greatly influence the tear-out stability in cementless <b>screw</b> <b>sockets</b> following axial loading. Furthermore, the strength of the bone-implant-interface of cementless <b>screw</b> <b>sockets</b> appears to be similar to cemented polyethylene cups. However, given the high failure load, high mechanical load and because of the related bone failure patterns, removal should not be performed by means of tear-out but rather by osteotomes or other curved cutting devices to preserve the acetabular bone stock...|$|R

50|$|Canadian P.L. Robertson, {{though he}} was not the first person to patent the idea of socket-head screws, was the first to {{successfully}} commercialize them, starting in 1908. <b>Socket</b> <b>screws</b> rapidly grew in popularity, and are still a favorite of mechanics today for their resistance to wear and tear, compatibility with hex keys, and ability to stop a power tool when set. Though immensely popular, Robertson had trouble marketing his invention to the newly booming auto industry, for he was unwilling to relinquish his patents.|$|R

5000|$|Headless {{set screws}} {{have been around}} for a long time, with the {{straight}} slot being the oldest drive type (due to its ease of machining), but the demand for headless set screws experienced a marked increase in the first and second decades of the 20th century, when a penchant for better industrial safety, a campaign with the slogan [...] "safety first", swept the industrialized nations of North America and Europe as a part of the larger Progressive Movement. This surge in safety consciousness was a backlash against the often-atrocious industrial safety standards of the era. H.T. Hallowell, Sr., a U.S. industrialist whose corporation was one of several that pioneered the commercialization of the <b>hex</b> <b>socket</b> drive, noted in his memoir that line shafting, which was [...] in the industrial practice of the time, often had headed set screws (with external-wrenching square drive) holding the many pulleys to the line shafts, and collars holding the shafts from axial movement. Gear trains of exposed gears were also common at the time, and those, too, often used headed set screws, holding the gears to the shafts. His company's chief products at the time were shaft hangers and shaft collars of pressed-steel construction. The [...] "safety craze" [...] created a burgeoning demand for headless set screws on pulleys, gears, and collars to replace the headed ones, so that workers' clothing and fingers were less likely to catch on the exposed rotating screw head. It was this heightened demand that prompted Hallowell's firm to get into the screw-making business and to explore socket-head drive designs. With P.L. Robertson holding fresh patent rights on a practical-to-make square-socket drive, the firm soon pursued the <b>hex</b> <b>socket</b> drive.|$|R

50|$|Throughout the 19th century, {{the most}} {{commonly}} used forms of screw head (that is, drive types) were simple internal-wrenching straight slots and external-wrenching squares and hexagons. These were easy to machine and served most applications adequately. Rybczynski describes a flurry of patents for alternative drive types in the 1860s through 1890s, but explains that these were patented but not manufactured due to the difficulties and expense of doing so at the time. In 1908, Canadian P. L. Robertson was the first to make the internal-wrenching square socket drive a practical reality by developing just the right design (slight taper angles and overall proportions) to allow the head to be stamped easily but successfully, with the metal cold forming as desired rather than being sheared or displaced in unwanted ways. Practical manufacture of the internal-wrenching hexagon drive (<b>hex</b> <b>socket)</b> shortly followed in 1911.|$|R

He was turned down by Robertson who felt {{it was not in}} his best interest and shortly after that, Ford found that Henry F. Phillips had invented another kind of <b>socket</b> <b>screw</b> and had no such reservations.

50|$|A {{set screw}} {{is a type}} of screw {{generally}} used to secure an object within or against another object, normally not using a nut (see bolts compared with screws). The most common examples are securing a pulley or gear to a shaft. Set screws are usually headless (also called blind), meaning that the screw is fully threaded and has no head projecting past the major diameter of the screw thread. If a set screw has a head, the thread will extend {{all the way to the}} head (whereas a bolt might have an unthreaded shank between the head and thread). A blind set screw (known in the UK as a grub screw, quite possibly from its figurative resemblance to a soil-dwelling grub) is almost always driven with an internal-wrenching drive, such as a <b>hex</b> <b>socket</b> (Allen), star (Torx), square socket (Robertson), or slot. The set screw passes through a threaded hole in the outer object and is tightened against the inner object to prevent it from moving relative to the outer object. It exerts compressional or clamping force through the bottom tip that projects through the hole.|$|R
