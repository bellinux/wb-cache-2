By 1967 around one in twenty households heated their water with the sun and 50,000 solar heaters had been sold. With the 1970s oil crisis, Harry Zvi Tabor, the father of Israel's solar industry, developed the prototype solar water heater that is now used in over 90% of Israeli homes.

25|$|Coal (by {{liquefaction}} technology) {{is one of}} the backstop {{resources that}} could limit escalation of oil prices and mitigate the effects of transportation <b>energy</b> <b>shortage</b> that will occur under peak oil. This is contingent on liquefaction production capacity becoming large enough to satiate the very large and growing demand for petroleum. Estimates of the cost of producing liquid fuels from coal suggest that domestic U.S. production of fuel from coal becomes cost-competitive with oil priced at around $35 per barrel, with the $35 being the break-even cost. With oil prices as low as around $40 per barrel in the U.S. as of December 2008, liquid coal lost some of its economic allure in the U.S., but will probably be re-vitalized, similar to oil sand projects, with an oil price around $70 per barrel.|$|E

Nor can it account for the great events of history, like the bombing of Pearl Harbor, President Kennedy’s assassination, or 9/11. What the generational cycle can do, according to Strauss and Howe, is explain how society is likely to respond to these events in different eras. It is the response, not the initial event, which defines an era according to the theory. According to Strauss and Howe, the crisis period lasts for approximately 20 years.|$|E
25|$|The NCB was {{encouraged}} to gear itself toward reduced subsidies in the early 1980s. After a strike was narrowly averted in February 1981, pit closures and pay restraint led to unofficial strikes. The main strike started on 6 March 1984 with a walkout at Cortonwood Colliery, {{which led to the}} NUM's Yorkshire area's sanctioning of a strike on the grounds of a ballot result from 1981 in the Yorkshire Area, which was later challenged in court. The union strategy was to cause a severe <b>energy</b> <b>shortage</b> of the sort that had won victory in the 1972 strike. The government strategy, designed by Margaret Thatcher, was threefold: to build up ample coal stocks, to keep as many miners at work as possible, and to use police to break up attacks by pickets on working miners. The critical element was the NUM's failure to hold a strike ballot, which enabled a minority to keep working and kept other unions from supporting it.|$|E
25|$|More {{troublesome}} for Chen was {{the political}} showdown over {{the construction of}} the Number Four Nuclear Power Facility. This multibillion-dollar project in Gongliao District was already one-third completed and favored by the pro-business KMT as a means of avoiding an <b>energy</b> <b>shortage.</b> However, the environmentalist DPP strongly objected to the expansion of nuclear power. Premier Tang had threatened to resign if the project were canceled, and Chen accepted his resignation on October 3, 2000, only four and a half months after both had taken office. Chen appointed his political ally Chang Chun-hsiung as Tang's replacement. On October 27, Chang announced that the government would halt construction. But less than an hour before, President Chen had met with Lien Chan to reconcile differences. Lien had asked Chen to leave the matter for the Legislative Yuan to decide and Chen seemed receptive to the suggestion. When Chang's announcement came out, Lien was furious and the KMT began an effort to recall the President. The Council of Grand Justices intervened and declared that it was the legislature and not the cabinet that had the power to decide on the issue. This was widely seen as the end of Chen's attempts to face the pan-blue groups head on. By the end of his first year in office, Chen's approval ratings had dropped to 25%.|$|E

40|$|Worldwide {{the energy}} sector has a major {{environmental}} impact. Recent decades have seen exponential growth in population and therefore also in energy demand and environmental concerns. Many {{countries in the world}} are currently facing <b>energy</b> <b>shortages,</b> including major developing countries such as China and India. This paper evaluates the link between an energy restricted environment and emissions in South Africa, a country plagued by <b>energy</b> <b>shortages</b> since the middle 2000 s. Lessons learned from the South African energy crisis hold important implications for countries facing similar challenges or those whose energy reserves are kept low in order to produce energy at competitive prices. It was found that the South African energy crisis had an undeniably negative impact on emissions. Emissions from large power stations increased due to lowered maintenance and deterioration of the stations. The removal efficiencies of emissions abatement technologies decreased due to the increased pressure on these systems and missed maintenance opportunity. The South African electricity tariff increased dramatically. In combination with weak economic growth (partly due to the <b>energy</b> <b>shortages</b> in the country) and the unreliability of electricity supply, poor households are expected to increasingly make use of solid fuel burning in order to meet their energy and heating demands. Higher income households and businesses, on the other hand, make use of diesel-fuelled back-up generators during times of electricity load shedding...|$|R
