Four infantry divisions were formed during 1939 and 1940, three of which were dispatched to the Middle East.

40|$|According to narrative-informed {{approaches}} to psychotherapy, self-narratives {{that no longer}} align with lived experience, and thereby impede coherent meaning-making, often bring individuals into treatment. Exposure to trauma can result in fragmented or disorganized self-narratives, and Emotion-focused Therapy for Trauma (EFTT) (Paivio & Pascual-Leone, 2010) is one treatment approach that helps trauma clients access, explore, and integrate traumatic memories into coherent personal narratives. The Narrative-Emotion Process Coding System (NEPCS 2. 0; Angus Narrative-Emotion Marker Lab, 2015) is a video-based coding system that consists of 10 narrative-emotion markers (i. e., client storytelling processes) that have been divided into three NEPCS marker subgroups, based on their degree of narrative-emotion integration: Problem, Transition, and Change markers. The aim {{of the current study}} was to examine the relationship between NEPCS markers and outcome (i. e., recovered vs. unchanged) across stage of therapy in a complex trauma sample receiving EFTT (N = 12 clients). The key hypotheses included: recovered clients would have significantly <b>higher</b> <b>proportions</b> of Transition markers in the early and middle stages of therapy, and significantly <b>higher</b> <b>proportions</b> of Change markers in the late stage of therapy, while unchanged clients would have significantly <b>higher</b> <b>proportions</b> of Problem markers across all stages of therapy. Additionally, recovered clients would have significantly <b>higher</b> <b>proportions</b> of shifting (i. e., movement between one NEPCS marker and a different NEPCS marker), and significantly <b>higher</b> <b>proportions</b> of productive shifting (i. e., movement away from Problem markers), whereas unchanged clients would have <b>higher</b> <b>proportions</b> of unproductive shifting (i. e., movement to Problem markers). Results suggested that, in line with theoretical expectations and previous NEPCS research applications, recovered clients showed significantly <b>higher</b> <b>proportions</b> of Transition and Change markers, whereas unchanged clients demonstrated <b>higher</b> <b>proportions</b> of Problem markers. Increased levels of NEPCS shifting, or flexibly moving between NEPCS markers, was also associated with recovery. Furthermore, recovered clients demonstrated significantly <b>higher</b> <b>proportions</b> of productive shifting, while their unchanged counterparts demonstrated more unproductive shifting, suggesting that the type of narrative flexibility may be an important prognostic indicator. A direction for future NEPCS research is to elucidate therapeutic interventions that facilitate client movement from unproductive to more productive modes of narrative-emotion processing...|$|R
