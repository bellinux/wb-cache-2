2500|$|When Chen Biao's elder {{half-brother}} Chen Xiu died, Chen Biao's mother {{refused to}} submit to Chen Xiu's mother, who had a higher status in the family because she was Chen Wu's official spouse. Chen Biao told his mother, [...] "It's unfortunate that my brother died early. Now, I'm {{the head of the}} family so I should pay respect to my stepmother. Mother, I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> accept my stepmother and maintain harmonious relations with her. If you can't, I'll leave and stay elsewhere." [...] Chen Biao said so out of graciousness and filial piety. His mother agreed and got along well with his stepmother.|$|E
2500|$|In 1946, Winston Churchill {{travelled}} to Westminster College {{in order}} to deliver his famous [...] "Sinews of Peace" [...] address {{as a part of}} the Green Lecture series. [...] An extraordinary confluence of circumstances conspired to bring Winston Churchill to Westminster. [...] At the time, the College had a unique connection to U.S. President Harry S. Truman's administration—Major General Harry Vaughan, a graduate of Westminster College. [...] College president Franc McCluer asked Vaughan to see what President Truman could do to induce Churchill to come to Westminster. [...] President Truman thought the idea of bringing Churchill to Missouri (Truman's native state) was a wonderful idea. [...] On the bottom of Churchill's invitation from Westminster College Truman wrote: [...] "This is a wonderful school in my home state. [...] <b>Hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do it. [...] I will introduce you." [...] So it was that two world leaders, Winston Churchill and President Harry Truman, descended onto the little campus of Westminster College in Fulton, Missouri.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the end of}} the Ten Year War, Michigan's {{regular season}} {{performance}} declined, but their post season performance improved. The 1979 season included a memorable game against Indiana that ended with a touchdown pass from John Wangler to Anthony Carter with six seconds left in the game. The play was made famous by Bob Ufer's emotional radio narration: [...] "Under center is Wangler at the 45, he goes back. He's looking for a receiver. He throws downfield to Carter. Carter has it. [...] Carter scores[...] [...] [...] I have {{never seen anything like this}} in all my 40 years of covering Michigan football[...] [...] [...] I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> hear me – because I've never been so happy in all my cotton-picking 59 years!

2500|$|Before Zhou Yu died, he, {{along with}} Gan Ning and others, had {{constantly}} urged Sun Quan to attack Yi Province (益州; covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing) from its governor, Liu Zhang. However, Zhou Yu died of illness while making preparations for {{an invasion of}} Yi Province. When Sun Quan asked Liu Bei for his opinion, Liu Bei, who secretly had the intention of seizing Yi Province for himself, lied to Sun Quan, [...] "Liu Zhang and I {{are members of the}} imperial clan, so we should strive to uphold the Han dynasty with the aid of our ancestors' blessings. Now, when I heard that Liu Zhang has offended his neighbours, I feel afraid and don't dare to probe further. I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> show leniency towards him. If you don't, I'll retire and return to the countryside." [...] Liu Bei revealed his true intentions later when he attacked Liu Zhang himself and eventually seized control of Yi Province. During the campaign against Liu Zhang, Liu Bei left his general Guan Yu behind to guard Jing Province in his absence. When Sun Quan heard about Liu Bei's takeover of Yi Province, he angrily remarked, [...] "This cunning barbarian dares to trick me!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Dance {{competition}} {{had been}} a part of American television for decades before the premiere of So You Think You Can Dance, but usually in the form of all-around talent searches, (such as Star Search, Soul Train, or Showtime at the Apollo). [...] However, [...] a season-long American Idol-like talent-search show with a sole focus on dance had never been broadcast on American network television. [...] Producers and judges associated with the show have stated on numerous occasions, both {{within the context of the}} show and in interviews, that the series was meant to rejuvenate the visibility and appreciation of dance as an art form in the U.S. and to give exposure to struggling dancers. [...] Series judge Mary Murphy says, for example, [...] "Of course you <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> make a living at it, because you don't want to give up on something that you do, but the honest truth is most dancers have to carry one or two jobs and dance as much as they can on the side -- it's a very lucky dancer who gets a full scholarship." [...] A number of dance-themed competition shows have been produced for American television since the premiere of So You Think You Can Dance, including America's Best Dance Crew, Superstars of Dance, and Live to Dance.|$|E

2500|$|Prior to the campaign, Sun Quan had two boxes made to {{hold the}} heads of Huang Zu and Su Fei (蘇飛). After Huang Zu's defeat, Su Fei was also {{captured}} and he immediately asked someone to inform Gan Ning. Gan Ning said, [...] "If Su Fei did not speak up, I'd have forgotten about him." [...] Later, when Sun Quan and his officers were celebrating the victory, Gan Ning left his seat and knelt down before his lord. He kowtowed until his face was covered in blood and with tears in his eyes, he pleaded with Sun Quan, [...] "I owe Su Fei a favour. If not for him, I'd have been dead and my body abandoned in a ravine. I'd {{not have been able}} to serve under you. Now, even though Su Fei's actions warrant death, I still <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> spare him." [...] Sun Quan was moved and he asked, [...] "What if he leaves after I spare his life?" [...] Gan Ning replied, [...] "Su Fei will be grateful if he is spared from death. He'll not leave even if you try to chase him away. Why would he still seek his own doom? If he really does that, I'm willing to use my head to replace his in the box." [...] Sun Quan then pardoned Su Fei.|$|E
2500|$|In Michigan's eighth {{game against}} an unranked Indiana team, Wangler had his most replayed {{moment in a}} Michigan uniform. [...] Dickey started the game, and Wangler entered the game as a substitute. [...] The game was tied at 2121 in the fourth quarter. [...] There was no {{overtime}} in college football, and Michigan fans would have regarded a tie as {{the equivalent of a}} defeat. [...] With six seconds left on the clock, Michigan had the ball on the Indiana 45-yard line. [...] Wangler dropped back to pass from his own 45-yard line, and his pass hit Anthony Carter at the 23-yard line. [...] Carter ran into the end zone as time ran out to give the Wolverines a 2721 victory. [...] The play was made famous by Bob Ufer's colorful and emotional radio narration as the play unfolded.

2500|$|Sun Ce told Taishi Ci, [...] "In the past, when Liu Yao criticised me {{for helping}} Yuan Shu conquer Lujiang, he didn't have good {{intentions}} and his reasons were not convincing. Why? Yuan Shu had {{control over the}} thousands of troops {{which used to be}} under my father's command. I wanted to make great achievements, so I {{had no choice but to}} submit to Yuan Shu and ask him to give me control of my father's troops. Even then, he only gave me back about 1,000 men. When he ordered me to attack Lujiang, the circumstances I was in were so desperate that I had no choice but to obey him. Later on, he turned evil and wanted to commit treacherous acts. I tried to dissuade him but he wouldn't listen. That was when I decided to sever ties with him. My relationship with Yuan Shu is only up to this extent. Now that Liu Yao is dead, there is no chance for me to explain to him anymore. However, his son still lives in Yuzhang. I don't know how Hua Ziyu treats him, and whether Liu Yao's former followers have decided to serve Hua Ziyu. You are from the same commandery as Liu Yao, and you served under him before. I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> visit his son and convey my wishes to his followers. If they wish to join me, I will welcome them; if they don't, do treat them kindly. At the same time, you can assess how strong Hua Ziyu's defences are, and see if the peoples of Luling and Poyang are willing to join me. You can bring along as many men as you wish." [...] Taishi Ci replied, [...] "I have committed unpardonable acts. Yet, you treat me as generously as how Duke Huan of Qi and Duke Wen of Jin treated former enemies who surrendered to them. The ancients lived by a code of loyalty until death. I don't need too many men to accompany me. Just a dozen or so will be sufficient." ...|$|E
