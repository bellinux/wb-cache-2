25|$|It was {{suspected}} that the Model Z's crash during a speed run in December 1931 was due to an unexpected failure of the gasoline tank cap, which may have come loose and passed through the windshield. A bullet-proof windscreen and internal fuel caps {{were part of the}} new <b>design.</b> <b>Analysis</b> of motion picture film of the event examined frame-by-frame, is inconclusive. Control surface flutter is a more likely cause. It is theorized that the gas cap struck the pilot and incapacitated him, causing a sudden upset in pitch that led to uncontrolled flutter in the right aileron which imparted undue stress on that wing, causing it to pitch up sharply and fail. In addition, tests of a reproduction aircraft have shown that the Gee Bee Z was susceptible to aerodynamic flutter at high speed. The 1932 R-1 and its sister ship, the R-2, were the successors of the previous year's Thompson Trophy-winning Model Z.|$|E

2500|$|Soviet {{engineers}} were initially reluctant {{to design a}} spacecraft that looked superficially identical to the Shuttle, but subsequent wind tunnel testing showed that NASA's design was already ideal. [...] Even though the Molniya Scientific Production Association proposed its Spiral programme design (halted 13 years earlier), it was rejected as being altogether dissimilar from the American shuttle design. [...] While NPO Molniya conducted development under the lead of Gleb Lozino-Lozinskiy, the Soviet Union's Military-Industrial Commission, or VPK, was tasked with collecting all data it could on the U.S. Space Shuttle. Under {{the auspices of the}} KGB, the VPK was able to amass documentation on the American shuttle's airframe designs, <b>design</b> <b>analysis</b> software, materials, flight computer systems and propulsion systems.

40|$|An {{automatic}} regridding {{method and}} a three dimensional shape design parameterization technique were constructed and {{integrated into a}} unified theory of shape <b>design</b> sensitivity <b>analysis.</b> An algorithm was developed for general shape <b>design</b> sensitivity <b>analysis</b> of three dimensional eleastic solids. Numerical implementation of this shape <b>design</b> sensitivity <b>analysis</b> method was carried out using the finite element code ANSYS. The unified theory of shape <b>design</b> sensitivity <b>analysis</b> uses the material derivative of continuum mechanics with a design velocity field that represents shape change effects over the structural design. Automatic regridding methods were developed by generating a domain velocity field with boundary displacement method. Shape design parameterization for three dimensional surface design problems was illustrated using a Bezier surface with boundary perturbations that depend linearly on the perturbation of design parameters. A linearization method of optimization, LINRM, was used to obtain optimum shapes. Three examples from different engineering disciplines were investigated to demonstrate the accuracy and versatility of this shape <b>design</b> sensitivity <b>analysis</b> method...|$|R

2500|$|In psychometrics, item {{response}} theory (IRT), {{also known}} as latent trait theory, strong true score theory, or modern mental test theory, is a paradigm for the <b>design,</b> <b>analysis,</b> and scoring of tests, questionnaires, and similar instruments measuring abilities, attitudes, or other variables. It is a theory of testing based {{on the relationship between}} individuals’ performances on a test item and the test takers’ levels of performance on an overall measure of the ability that item was designed to measure. Several different statistical models are used to represent both item and test taker characteristics. Unlike simpler alternatives for creating scales and evaluating questionnaire responses, it does not assume that each item is equally difficult. This distinguishes IRT from, for instance, the assumption in Likert scaling that [...] "All items are assumed to be replications of each other or in other words items are considered to be parallel instruments" [...] (p.197). By contrast, item response theory treats the difficulty of each item (the ICCs) as information to be incorporated in scaling items. ICC stands for item characteristic curve.|$|E

40|$|<b>Design</b> and <b>Analysis</b> by Bernard Leupen, Christoph Grafe, Nicola Kirnig, Marc Lampe, and Peter de Zeeuw <b>Design</b> and <b>Analysis</b> is an insightful, {{interdisciplinary}} {{exploration of}} the diversity of analytic methods used by architects, designers, urban planners, and landscape architects to understand the structure and principles of the built environment. Developed by a team headed by Bernard Leupen at Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands, <b>Design</b> and <b>Analysis</b> defies borders of history, geography, and discipline, tracing the evolution of design principles from ancient Greece to the 20 th century. “Only methodical analysis gives us an insight into the design process,” states architect Bernard Tschumi. Using historical examples from architecture, urban design, and landscape architecture, <b>Design</b> and <b>Analysis</b> defines an ordered system that enables the design student or professional to identify the factors that influence designers'decisions, and shows how to relate them to the finished project. <b>Design</b> and <b>Analysis</b> is organized into six chapters that correspond to these factors: order and composition, functionality, structure, typology, context, and analytical techniques. The authors introduce the analytical drawing as a time-tested means to obtaining insight into the design process. Over 100 line drawings are featured in all. Using contemporary architectural examples to teach ancient design principles, <b>Design</b> and <b>Analysis</b> is more than just an introduction to analytical methods. The authors give an outline of space design as a whole, from individual buildings to urban and landscape ensembles. Though primarily intended for design students to help them appreciate many of the issues that they will face as professionals, <b>Design</b> and <b>Analysis's</b> broad, easy-to-read approach makes it an invaluable handbook for designers of all disciplines. ...|$|R
