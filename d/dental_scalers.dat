40|$|Magnetostrictive {{transducers}} {{have been}} used for many years by dentists for the removal of deposits on teeth that contribute to tooth decay. A study of current commercial magnetostrictive scalers has been undertaken so that potentially beneficial modifications to the present designs could be identified and investigated. This has resulted in suggestions for upgrades to the drive coil design and changes to the frequency of the applied dynamic magnetic field (which produces magnetostriction) that could improve system performance. In addition, a 'capacitance compensation system' has been produced and tested that significantly reduces the power requirements for current and future <b>dental</b> <b>scalers</b> by compensating for dynamic losses in a resonant transducer. Magnetostrictive materials are identified as replacement for those currently used in <b>dental</b> <b>scalers.</b> It is demonstrated that although they possess some of the qualities that could offer advantages for new types of <b>dental</b> <b>scalers,</b> they are unable to produce satisfactory results when compared to extant nickel-based systems if based on current device geometries. Finite element modelling has been used to investigate the mode-shapes associated with resonant magnetostrictive dental scaler components. The modelling indicates that flexural modes can be generated and the resultant flexing of 'tips' are equivalent to those measured in real devices. In addition, it is shown that coupled longitudinal-flexural resonant modes must be stimulated to produce the required tip vibrations for dental scaling. Suggestions are also made for future work that includes the development of more advanced finite element models, improved dental scaler designs and new transducer measurement techniques...|$|E
40|$|Problem statement: There is no {{specific}} instrument to test ultrasonic <b>dental</b> <b>scalers</b> used in dentistry. Approach: The {{aim of this}} research was to develop and test an innovative cavitometer for quantitative and automatic performance assessments of Ultrasonic <b>Dental</b> <b>Scalers</b> (UDS) through the acoustic emission produced by cavitation induced by the tip of the UDS ultrasonic transducer when immersed in aqueous solution. Firstly, an optimized acoustic emission sensor specifically for UDS ultrasonic transducers, software to process the acoustic emission sensor signal and to calculate a Figure of Merit (FM) and a hydraulic-pneumatic circuit were developed; these parts together constituted the cavitometer. To validate the developed cavitometer, two groups of UDS transducers were tested with the cavitometer and with one cleaning test; 48 units of the Jet 1 UDS model and 12 units of the Jet 2 model (Gnatus, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil) were tested. Sixteen assessments were carried out with each transducer, for a total of 768 measurements with Jet 1 and 192 with Jet 2. Spearman test was employed to observe correlations between the measurements from the different methods. Jet 1 transducers were compared with Jet 2 employing Student t test for cavitometer assessments and Mann Whitney U test for the cleaning test assessments. Results: The results showed correlation between the cavitometer and cleaning results. The developed cavitometer detected a significant difference between average results for the two transducer groups (Jet 1 : 4. 3 ± 0. 7 Vs Jet 2 : 6. 2 ± 0. 5) and this was also observed for the cleaning test (Jet 1 : 7. 0 ± 0. 8 Vs Jet 2 : 8. 7 ± 0. 4) Conclusion: The results showed that the developed cavitometer is adequate for the UDS quantitative performance assessment, particularly for replacement of the cleaning test for industrial quality control...|$|E
40|$|Magnetostrictive {{materials}} have been utilized {{for the production}} of ultrasonic frequency vibrations for a number of years. This has particularly been the case in laminated nickel-based ultrasonic dental-scaler cleaning systems. In this study, a comparison has been made between the impedances of a number of magnetostrictive stacks of 50 mm× 4 mm×∼ 0. 3 mm strips at frequencies in the range of 10 – 50 kHz in a coil used for the excitation of a stack in a dental-scaler system. The magnetostrictive stacks tested comprised of potential replacement materials for standard nickel ones. The study showed {{that it was possible to}} compensate for the inductive ‘imaginary’ components of the impedance through the use of a tuned, series capacitance so that only the ‘real’ resistive component of the impedance remained. This reduced the electrical losses associated with the excitation of the magnetostrictive stacks as a result of the frequency-dependent inductance of the coil system. Consequently, the maximum power transfer from an amplifier to the transducer was increased. Also, the investigation showed how the ‘real’ component of impedance of the different stacks varied with frequency. In a tuned resonant electrical circuit, the resistive component of the impedance, if considered as a loss, would be the lowest that could be achieved with such a magnetic circuit. Consequently, the losses associated with resonant magnetostrictive devices, like <b>dental</b> <b>scalers,</b> can be reduced...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. With the {{capability}} of net shaping for complex 3 D geometry, powder injection molding (PIM) is widely used for automotive parts, electronics and medical industry. In this study, an ultrasonic <b>dental</b> <b>scaler</b> tip produced by machining process was redesigned for the PIM process. An injection mold was designed and machined to produce the <b>dental</b> <b>scaler</b> tip by the PIM process. The mold design was aided by CAE analysis. A PIM feedstock was made of SUS 316 L powder and a wax based binder. The filling balance in the mold was checked by a short shot test with LDPE and the PIM feedstock. Production capability of the PIM process for the <b>dental</b> <b>scaler</b> tip was examined with the mold. Although there were minor problems such as a discoloration around the gate and a flashing at the air vent, the PIM process {{turned out to be}} an excellent substitute for machining process to manufacture the ultrasonic <b>dental</b> <b>scaler</b> tip...|$|R
40|$|Piezoelectric bone {{surgery is}} a recent and {{innovative}} technology permitting a selective cut of mineralized tissue while sparing soft tissue. Similar to a <b>dental</b> <b>scaler,</b> a high frequency vibration, {{in the range of}} 25 - 35 kHz, is transmitted to a metallic tip. However, the power of the piezosurgical instrument is 3 to 6 times higher than that of a <b>dental</b> <b>scaler.</b> The major advantages of this technology include high precision, a design that increases ease of curvilinear osteotomy, less trauma to soft tissue, preservation of neurological and vascular structures, reduced hemorrhage, minimal thermal damage to the bone as well as overall improvement of healing. The handpiece of the instrument is equipped with a sterile irrigation system and light-emitting diode (LED) light, which improves visibility and overall safety. Piezoelectric surgery is particularly useful when performing delicate bone procedures such as periodontal or endodontic surgery. It is also indicated when performing more invasive bone surgery such as maxillectomy, mandibulectomy, and condylectomy, where preservation of neurovascular structures is important. Piezoelectric instruments are different from rotary instrumentation or oscillating saws, they require light pressure with constant motion of the tip. Training is required to master the technique...|$|R

RysThe {{current state}} of the dental {{industry}} shows an increasing number of dentists and dental hygienists who are reducing hours and retiring early due to the injuries sustained while working. These injuries, or cumulative trauma disorders, can be reduced by applying ergonomics in dental tool design. The goal of ergonomics is to reduce current injuries but also prevent future ones. In addition, population demographics have shown an increasing trend in female dentists. With a shift from the male dominated field, design for different anthropometric measurements needs to be investigated. In order to pinpoint sources of pain, a survey was designed and distributed to dentists in Kansas, Missouri, and Texas. Even with a small sample size (n= 24), results confirmed past studies in the dental industry of pain originating in the neck, shoulder, lower back, and wrist/hand region. The reasons stemmed from the repetitive motions and forces applied during dental procedures. Responses also found that ergonomic principles need to be applied to the handle and grip portion of <b>dental</b> <b>scaler</b> design. <b>Dental</b> scaling is the procedure to remove deposits on teeth, such as plaque and calculus, most commonly performed by dental hygienists. First, the history of dental tools, angulation, tool weight, and materials currently utilized were researched before looking into specific design factors for modification. Currently, the handle grip area on all dental tools range in size, but a 10 mm grip has been proven to be optimal. The optimal tool weight has yet to be determined as 15 grams is the lowest weight to be tested. Most tools are made of stainless steel and resins, which are not compressible. An experiment was designed to test a new <b>dental</b> <b>scaler</b> (A) made of a titanium rod with added compressibility in the precision grip area. The aim was to help reduce pressure on the fingers and hand muscles and increase comfort during scaling. The experiment utilized a Hu-Friedy sickle scaler (B) and a Practicon Montana Jack scaler (C) as controls to show two design spectrums, weight and material. The subjects (n= 23) were taught the basics of scaling and required to scale using a typodont. The change in grip strength (Δ GS), pinch strength (Δ PS), and steadiness of the subjects hand were tested. An absolute and relative rating technique was utilized pinpointing that the new <b>dental</b> <b>scaler</b> was preferred with the eigenvector (A= 0. 8615, B= 0. 1279, C= 0. 0106). Statistical analysis confirmed this tool preference while also finding the interaction of gender and tool and Δ GS Tool A versus Tool B for males to be significant...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess the natural frequency of the straight internal ultrasonic scaler insert 30 K FSI-SLI- 10 S (Dentsply International, York, USA) and to measure the displacement observed at the tip when operated under different generator settings. Two approaches were used: finite element analysis and scanning laser vibrometry. The Finite Element Analysis method was employed to calculate the expected modes of vibration of the insert. Scanning laser vibrometry was used to measure displacements of the tip during operation. It was found the insert had two modes of vibration around the operating frequency of 30 kHz; these modes were first order bending in two orthogonal planes...|$|R
40|$|There is an {{accepted}} clinical requirement for a luting cement {{that can be}} command set upon satisfactory placement of an orthodontic appliance onto dentition. This work evaluates the suitability of ultrasound, imparted from a <b>dental</b> <b>scaler,</b> as a potential mechanism for achieving this. The net setting times and subsequent compressive strengths {{of a range of}} commercial and experimental glass polyalkenoate cements (GPCs) were evaluated, using modified ISO 9917 methods, when set both chemically and by ultrasound. The ultrasound was applied to the GPC through an orthodontic brace. It was possible to command set GPCs by the application of five to ten seconds of ultrasound; the exact time required being dependent upon the composition of the GPC in question. The compressive strengths of these cements can be improved by around 90 % with the command set when the optimum PAA molecular weight and tartaric acid content is employed. accepte...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} sound {{generated}} by an ultrasonic <b>dental</b> <b>scaler</b> and a <b>dental</b> turbine on heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and hemodynamic {{changes in the}} frontal cortex were measured and {{compared with those of}} pure tone stimulation in 17 young volunteers. Near-infrared spectroscopy and the Finapres technique were used to measure hemodynamic and cardiovascular responses, respectively. The dental sound changed the various physiological parameters. To determine if this change was related to participants' previous experiences with dental treatment, participants were divided into two groups: those who had a previous unpleasant experience with dental treatment and those who had not. Participants with previous unpleasant dental experiences showed a significant decrease in cerebral blood flow. Participants who had not had an unpleasant dental experience did not show significant changes in cerebral blood flow. Thus, although sounds associated with dental treatment may reduce cerebral blood flow, this effect may depend on the dental experiences of the patient. It is recommended that dentists treat patients gently and with empathy to promote a friendly image of dentistry.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to determine if cavitation occurred around <b>dental</b> ultrasonic <b>scalers</b> and to estimate the amount of cavitation occurring. Three styles of tip (3 x TFI- 10, 3 x TFI- 3, 3 x TFI- 1) were used, in conjunction with a Cavitron SPS ultrasonic generator (Dentsply, USA), to insonate terephthalic acid solution. The hydroxyl radical, [OH], concentration, produced due to cavitation from the scaler tips, was monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy. Cavitational activity was enhanced at higher power settings and at longer operating times. The tip dimensions and geometry as well as the generator power setting are both important factors that affect the production of cavitation. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Cavitation occurs around <b>dental</b> {{ultrasonic}} <b>scalers,</b> {{which are}} used clinically for removing dental biofilm and calculus. However {{it is not known}} if this contributes to the cleaning process. Characterisation of the cavitation around ultrasonic scalers will assist in assessing its contribution and in developing new clinical devices for removing biofilm with cavitation. The aim is to use high speed camera imaging to quantify cavitation patterns around an ultrasonic scaler. A Satelec ultrasonic scaler operating at 29 kHz with three different shaped tips has been studied at medium and high operating power using high speed imaging at 15, 000, 90, 000 and 250, 000 frames per second. The tip displacement has been recorded using scanning laser vibrometry. Cavitation occurs at the free end of the tip and increases with power while the area and width of the cavitation cloud varies for different shaped tips. The cavitation starts at the antinodes, with little or no cavitation at the node. High speed image sequences combined with scanning laser vibrometry show individual microbubbles imploding and bubble clouds lifting and moving away from the ultrasonic scaler tip, with larger tip displacement causing more cavitation...|$|R
40|$|Current {{methods of}} dental biofilm removal are {{predominantly}} mechanical {{and are not}} effective in removing it from irregular surfaces in the mouth. Cavitation occurs around <b>dental</b> ultrasonic <b>scalers</b> and {{may be a more}} efficient and less damaging technique. Previous work has failed to quantify the cavitation bubble dynamics around ultrasonic scalers and its effects. The aim was to develop imaging and analysis protocols to analyse the cavitation and to investigate its ability to disrupt biofilms and deliver sub-micron particles into dentine. High speed imaging was used to characterise cavitation. Its effect on biofilm removal and dentinal tubule occlusion was studied using electron microscopy and x-ray micro computed tomography. We are able to demonstrate that cavitation occurs at the free end of scaler tips and increases with power and vibration amplitude. Biofilm can effectively be removed from dental implant surfaces using this cavitation. It {{can also be used to}} transport sub-micron particles further into dentinal tubules. The results show that ultrasonic scalers could be optimised for non-contact use and improved removal of plaque from the teeth. The protocols established in this study can be applied to future studies for quantitative investigation of biofilm growth and removal and analysis of cavitation dynamics...|$|R
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{biological}} effects of ultrasound on dental-derived cells and whether ultrasound may be used as a therapeutic tool in dental care. This thesis has investigated the functional responses of in vitro osteoblast and odontoblast model cell lines to low frequency ultrasound as a potential tool for dental tissue repair. Two methods for ultrasound delivery were used to stimulate cells in vitro; a <b>dental</b> ultrasonic <b>scaler</b> (EMS) capable of emitting ultrasound at a frequency of 30 kHz; and the DuoSon (SRA developments) therapeutic ultrasound exposure system, which allowed the comparison of kHz, MHz and a combined frequency ultrasound. Odontoblast-like cells positively responded to all ultrasound frequencies applied and can increase VEGF expression, increase cell number and increase mineral deposition by enhancing differentiation when compared with sham-treated control. Furthermore, enhanced wound healing by increased cell migration and cell proliferation was demonstrated in ultrasound-stimulated osteoblast-like cells. Ultrasound induced a dose-dependent response in β-catenin staining in both odontoblast and osteoblast model cell lines, which implicates the Wnt/β-catenin pathway as a possible mechanism for intracellular ultrasound transduction. Taken together, it is tempting to speculate that direct low frequency ultrasound stimulation of the dentine-pulp complex or alveolar bone may be able to initiate or enhance regenerative event...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the possible bactericidal acoustic effects of the <b>dental</b> ultrasonic <b>scaler.</b> Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis suspensions, were subjected to the vibrations of a Cavitron PI insert for 2. 5 and 5. 0 min in an acoustically-simulated pocket model and the survivors enumerated. The extent of any cavitation occurring within the pocket model to which the statistically significant bactericidal activity observed might be attributed, was determined by 'sonoluminescence', which was then investigated by photomultiplication techniques. However, these failed to detect any sonoluminescence within the pocket space and, moreover, the necessary deflection of the water coolant away from the insert tip, to avoid flooding of the experimental pocket, proved to result in temperatures of 47. 6 °C and 52. 3 °C at the respective time intervals, and thereby constituted an alternative possible bactericidal mechanism. Examination {{of the effects of}} such temperature changes on the target bacteria then revealed statistically significant differences in the viable counts of both microorganisms after 5. 0 -min periods, and as such were comparable to those previously detected in relation to the pocket model. Whilst it must be presumed that the bacteriolytic effect observed in the main investigation was due to the incidental temperature changes, in the absence of acoustic cavitation the influence of any associated acoustic microstreaming cannot be discounted. Further investigations to assess the bactericidal potential of acoustic phenomena using a modified experimental to exclude any hyperthermic effects are therefore necessar...|$|R

In each area the noise level was assessed at two positions-one, at 6 inches from the operators ear and second, at the chairside instrument trolley.
