500|$|U.S. Department of State {{spokesman}} Nicholas Burns {{rejected the}} Nazi comparisons {{in the open}} letter as [...] "outrageous" [...] and distanced the U.S. government from Nazi comparisons made by the Church of Scientology, saying, [...] "We have criticized the Germans on this, but we aren't going to support the Scientologists' terror tactics against the German government." [...] Chancellor Kohl, commenting on the letter, said that those who signed it [...] "don't <b>know</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> Germany and don't want to know." [...] German officials argued that [...] "the whole fuss was cranked up by the Scientologists to achieve what we won't give them: tax-exempt status as a religion. This is intimidation, pure and simple." [...] Officials explained that precisely because of Germany's Nazi past, Germany took a determined stance against all [...] "radical cults and sects, including right-wing Nazi groups", and not just against Scientology. Kohl's Christian Democratic Union party denounced the letter as [...] "absurd" [...] and cited German court rulings stating that Scientology had primarily economic goals and could legitimately be referred to using phrases such as a [...] "contemptuous cartel of oppression".|$|E
500|$|Jocelyn Vena of MTV News wrote, [...] "Beyoncé may not <b>know</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> algebra, {{but when}} it comes to the math of power ballads, she totally gets it." [...] Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "the album [...] opens with its most tender ballad, a slow-burning number that calls back to both Sam Cooke's 'Wonderful World' and Prince's 'Purple Rain' without {{sounding}} like a retread of either tune [...] it sounds best in the context of the album, where its slow, steady build to a cathartic guitar break is the perfect introduction to a set of mostly low-key tracks about love and heartbreak." [...] Similarly considering [...] "1+1" [...] to be [...] "the perfect opener" [...] of 4, Joanne Dorken of MTV UK wrote that it exposes a more vulnerable side of Beyoncé and that it will remain [...] "a classic stripped-back slow jam from the diva." [...] Praising Beyoncé's vocals, Jon Caramainca of The New York Times stated that [...] " [...] requires a vocal muscle few singers possess, and even fewer would care to deploy." [...] Writing for The Baltimore Sun, Wesley Case included [...] "1+1" [...] in his list of Five Great Songs and praised song's concept, writing that he began crying when he heard the album version and called it [...] "gut-wrenching" [...] and [...] "gorgeous". Case appreciated Beyoncé's sensitivity and concluded that it [...] "fades to black like an ellipsis and it's so damn beautiful." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rumors about Bankhead's {{sex life}} have lingered for years, {{and she was}} linked romantically with many notable female personalities of the day, {{including}} Greta Garbo, Marlene Dietrich, Katherine Cornell, Eva Le Gallienne, Hope Williams, Beatrice Lillie, and Alla Nazimova, as well as writer Mercedes de Acosta and singer Billie Holiday. Actress Patsy Kelly confirmed she had {{a sexual relationship with}} Bankhead when she worked for her as a personal assistant. John Gruen's Menotti: A Biography notes an incident in which Jane Bowles chased Bankhead around Capricorn, Gian Carlo Menotti and Samuel Barber's Mount Kisco estate, insisting that Bankhead needed to play the lesbian character Inès in Jean-Paul Sartre's No Exit (which Paul Bowles had recently translated). Bankhead locked herself in the bathroom and kept insisting, [...] "That lesbian! I wouldn't <b>know</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> it." ...|$|E

5000|$|During her {{volunteer}} work, Morrow {{became interested}} in political and legal leverage.

5000|$|In 1953, metalsmith Margret Craver saw a pin {{decorated}} {{using the}} technique. [...] Craver began studying the technique, researching and testing {{it over the}} course of about thirteen years to reproduce it. [...] Because the technique was not being practiced, and there were no instructional texts in existence, the work was slow, and Craver had to design her own tools.

5000|$|Roeg saw {{the play}} and felt it [...] "might be a tool to use.

[...] Roeg notes that Insignificance is usually talked about as a meeting between Marilyn Monroe and Albert Einstein, but what moved him was the pain of the problems between The Actress and The Ballplayer, who are married but seem to know nothing about each other. Insignificance would become his first film adapted from a play.|$|R
