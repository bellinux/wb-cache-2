40|$|By {{the end of}} the 1970 s {{there was}} {{widespread}} agreement that the rate of capital accumulation in the United States was too low and that the tax system was an important reason for that low rate of investment.

The tax system depressed the return to saving and to investing in business plant and equipment by a combination of corporate and personal taxes that took 67 % of the pretax return to capital in the nonfinancial corporate sector during the years 1975 to 1979. l The sharp increase in this effective tax rate during the 1960 s and 1970 s was due in large part to the interaction between the rising rate of inflation and the persistence of tax rules that base depreciation on the nominal value of capital assets and that tax artificial nominal <b>inventory</b> <b>profits</b> and nominal capital gains. 2 Congress and the new Reagan administration responded to this prob...|$|R

In 2009, he sells the remainder of the parts for $180. If he keeps track of <b>inventory,</b> his <b>profit</b> in 2008 is $50, and his profit in 2009 is $110, or $160 in total.

A commonly studied integer program is the knapsack problem, which has applications including project and portfolio selection, production planning, <b>inventory</b> problems, <b>profit</b> maximization applications and machine scheduling. Integer programs are computationally difficult and currently require exponential effort to solve. Adding cutting planes is a way of reducing the solving time of integer programs. These cutting planes eliminate linear relaxation space. The theoretically strongest cutting planes are facet defining inequalities. This thesis introduces a new class of cutting planes called multiple variable merging cover inequalities (MVMCI). The thesis presents the multiple variable merging cover algorithm (MVMCA), which runs in linear time and produces a valid MVMCI. Under certain conditions, an MVMCI can be shown to be a facet defining inequality. An example demonstrates these advancements and is used to prove that MVMCIs could not be identified by any existing techniques. A small computational study compares the computational impact of including MVMCIs. The study shows that finding an MVMCI is extremely fast, less than. 01 seconds. Furthermore, including an MVMCI improved the solution time required by CPLEX, a commercial integer programming solver, by 6. 3 % on average...|$|R

It provides coverage of survey problems arising from the variety of spatial distribution conditions of forests and trees under village management landscapes. The guidelines cover survey planning, survey design, survey implementation and survey analysis /evaluation. The main issues in the planning phase such as specification of expected results, statistical outputs and precision of results are discussed. The emphasis in survey design is on definition of survey area, construction of a sampling framework and use of remote sensing data to supplement the field observations. In survey implementation, data must be collected in a consistent manner and with a minimum of bias or non-sampling errors. The importance of good management of the field survey team(s) is stressed.

Although improved demand information reduces the demand uncertainty that the manufacturer faces, the manufacturer is constrained by the supplier's capacity decision. In all three cases, we show that improved information can decrease the supply chain's expected profit, even as the supplier's capacity increases with improved information.

40|$|Abstract ⎯ This study {{examines}} multi-item product inventories as a pledge subject, and proposes a quantitative model to manage multi-item product values and cash flows; thus, enabling enterprises to obtain optimal profits, and maximizing financial loans from financial institutions. It {{is also possible}} to use the proposed model to create an optimal financing solution for a small business firm from the company's inventory database. This study shows that a company’s supply chain determines the optimal financing situation. When a company is small, its power of inference within supply chain is small; this could delay accounts payable and accounts receivable. These delays cause short-term funding shortages in small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which directly affect operations. Power of inference within supply chain allows companies to apply small inventory changes and high-value multi-product <b>inventories</b> to optimize <b>profits</b> and maximize loans when performing financial warehousing.

Excess inventories during an off season are typical, while shortages frequently occur during the in season, especially at the transition points between seasons. Approach: Evaluate {{the extent to which}} items characterized by non-stationary (seasonal) intermittent demand can be managed with commonly used forecasting and replenishment methods, including existing intermittent demand methods. Extensive simulation studies were conducted using combinations of two commonly used forecasting methods and two replenishment policies to evaluate the impact of non-stationary intermittent demand on key inventory performance measures, including average <b>inventory</b> and net <b>profits,</b> including the extent to which combinations of forecasting and replenishment models is adversely impacted by the non-stationary demand distributions. Results: No combination of forecasting and replenishment methods tested consistently outperformed the others and all methods demonstrated a propensity to replace demanded units an average of 10 weeks before the inventory was required to avert a shortage.

The square root model from the food science literature is used to estimate the shelf-life of fluid milk at retail level. The shelf-life parameter is then used as input to the fixed- order quantity inventory model from the business economic literature. Additionally two demand specifications, the own-price elasticity and the negative binomial distribution, are {{used to calculate the}} total cost of managing <b>inventory</b> and resulting <b>profit.</b> Modeling results confirm that fluctuations in temperature and time dramatically increase the percentage of perishability cost and decrease profitability. Specifications of retail demand directly impact outcomes of the inventory model. Under the demand model based on price elasticity, simulated total costs are lower and profits are higher than under the negative binomial specification. The negative binomial distribution approach provides a simulated outcome where sales losses are minimized and customer satisfaction is higher. This thesis proposes, presents and uses a working model that can be extended and directly applied for fluid milk as well as other perishable food supplies...|$|R
