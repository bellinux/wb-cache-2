5|$|The {{strength}} of research support for each recommendation varies; {{some of the}} more robustly researched and supported recommendations include the negative effects of noisy sleep environments, alcohol consumption in the hours before sleep, engaging in mentally difficult tasks before sleep, and trying too hard to fall asleep. There is a lack of evidence for the effects of certain sleep hygiene recommendations, including getting a more comfortable mattress, removing bedroom clocks, not worrying, and limiting liquids. Other recommendations, such as the effects of napping or exercise, have a more complicated evidence base. The effects of napping, for example, seem to depend on the length and timing of napping, in conjunction with how much cumulative sleep an individual <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> recent nights.|$|E

25|$|Since the 1970s, {{the county}} <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> place a Moderately Priced Dwelling Unit (MPDU) zoning plan that {{requires}} developers to include affordable housing in any new residential developments that they construct in the county. The {{goal is to}} create socioeconomically mixed neighborhoods and schools so the rich and poor are not isolated in separate parts of the county. Developers who provide for more than the minimum amount of MPDUs are rewarded with permission to increase the density of their developments, which allows them to build more housing and generate more revenue. Montgomery County {{was one of the first}} counties in the U.S. to adopt such a plan, but many other areas have since followed suit.|$|E

25|$|At {{the core}} of these {{disputes}} is the role that music <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> Israel {{as a vehicle for}} creating a national ethos and for disseminating national ideology. With regard to the Ballad, its lyricist Yoram Taharlev observed that “it is in the nature of a mythological song that it created a myth”, and noted that a similar controversy arose around another of his songs, the Six Day War song Ammunition Hill released in 1968. Ben Ezer complained that learning about the founding of Petah Tikva from the Ballad would be “like learning about the Israeli War of Independence only from Nathan Alterman’s poem Silver Platter. He worried that the events themselves might be forgotten, “leaving only the songs”, and wondered whether, in the future, the history of Israel might become confused with the history of Israeli poetry and song.|$|E
