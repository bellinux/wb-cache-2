5|$|On 12 June 1918, {{the leader}} of the local secret police, Gavril Myasnikov, with the {{connivance}} of other local Bolsheviks, hatched a plan to murder Michael. Myasnikov assembled a team of four men who, like him, were all former prisoners of the Tsarist regime: Vasily Ivanchenko, Ivan Kolpashchikov, Andrei Markov and Nikolai Zhuzhgov. Using a forged order, the four men gained entry to Michael's hotel at 11.45 p.m. At first, Michael refused to accompany the men until he spoke with the local chairman of the secret police, Pavel Malkov, and then because he was ill. His protestations were futile and he <b>got</b> <b>dressed.</b> Johnson insisted on accompanying him and the four men plus their two prisoners climbed into two horse-drawn three-seater traps. They drove out of the town into the forest near Motovilikha. When Michael queried their destination, he was told they were going to a remote railway crossing to catch a train. By now it was the early hours of 13 June. They all alighted from the carriages {{in the middle of the}} wood, and both Michael and Johnson were fired upon, once each, but as the assassins were using home-made bullets, their guns jammed. Michael, whether wounded or not is unknown, moved towards the wounded Johnson with arms outstretched, when he was shot at point-blank range in the head. Both Zhuzhgov and Markov claimed to have fired the fatal shot. Johnson was shot dead by Ivanchenko. The bodies were stripped and buried. Anything of value was stolen and the clothes were taken back to Perm. After they were shown to Myasnikov as proof of the murders, the clothes were burned. The Ural Regional Soviet, headed by Alexander Beloborodov, approved the execution, either retrospectively or beforehand, as did Lenin. Michael was the first of the Romanovs to be executed by the Bolsheviks but he was not the last. Neither Michael's nor Johnson's remains have been found.|$|E
25|$|The {{next morning}} Freyja woke {{and saw that}} the doors to her bower were open, yet unbroken, and that her {{precious}} necklace was gone. Freyja had an idea of who was responsible. She <b>got</b> <b>dressed</b> and went to Odin. She told Odin of the malice he had allowed against her and of the theft of her necklace, and that he should give her back her jewelry.|$|E
25|$|Albert Graham took Sharlene {{out of the}} {{building}} and drove her back to the YWCA hostel; as he left her on the doorstep he reassured the little girl that her mother was inside waiting for her. Sharlene was looked after by the hostel staff until she was placed in the care of the Social Services. Back at the UDA club, Cowan removed the bloodstained hood and saw by her appalling head wounds and badly-bruised, disfigured face that Ann Ogilby was obviously dead; the body was then wrapped up in a brown sack and carried downstairs. The killers went to have a drink with Elizabeth Douglas to whom they recounted the details of the fatal beating as she had remained on the ground floor the entire time. Afterwards, Cowan and Smith <b>got</b> <b>dressed</b> up and went out to the disco as planned.|$|E

6000|$|... "My wife {{wishes to}} know whether she has <b>got</b> to <b>dress</b> in the dark every {{afternoon}} {{for the rest of}} her life," [...] he said, in fierce but trembling tones.|$|R
6000|$|... "You're very, very kind, but it wouldn't do any good. Suppose I <b>got</b> a <b>dress</b> {{suitable}} for this afternoon, it wouldn't help much. It's impossible. I'd better {{keep in the}} background where I belong." ...|$|R
2500|$|My {{father got}} up, {{apparently}} recovering his serenity. [...] He {{was full of}} punch. [...] He washed, shaved and <b>got</b> <b>dressed.</b> [...] Then he strode out of his bedroom, flung {{open the door to}} the chancellery, and announced in a loud voice: [...] "From now on I'm giving everyone visas. [...] There will be no more nationalities, races or religions." [...] Then our father told us that he had heard a voice, that of his conscience or of God, which dictated to him what course of action he should take, and that everything was clear in his mind.|$|E
2500|$|Bobo chic was {{associated}} {{in particular with}} punks in the SoHo area of Lower Manhattan, {{to the south of}} Greenwich Village. It was described by a student fashion writer as [...] "paying to look poor" [...] and having been [...] "made popular by silver screen stars who all look like they <b>got</b> <b>dressed</b> in the dark like the Olsen twins, Kirsten Dunst and Chloë Sevigny". In 2008 English actress Sophie Winkleman, who had attended Cambridge University in the 1990s, remarked wryly that she had [...] "wor floaty dresses at university ... thinking that I looked poetic and wistful. I actually looked homeless". Another British commentator referred to Mary-Kate Olsen's [...] "everything-but-the-kitchen-sink approach to dressing", but noted that, by 2006, the Olsens' merchandising empire was recording annual sales of £500 million.|$|E
2500|$|Lewis {{took part}} in the [...] "American Idols Live! Tour 2007" [...] from July 6 - September 23, 2007, along with other contestants in the top ten. He {{revealed}} on The View on June 14, 2007 that all the male contestants on the show would be playing musical instruments on the tour (for the first time ever), [...] "doing like a folk band," [...] and that he would bring along his loop pedals for his beatboxing. Before several shows, Lewis improvised, <b>got</b> <b>dressed</b> up as a janitor character named Bob Bobberson and sometimes as a Pop-Tart. He performed [...] "She Loves the Way" [...] on the last show, becoming the first Idol who sang their pre-Idol original materials on the tour. He and Chris Richardson have [...] "started working on a little documentary" [...] on the tour and it will be published at their MySpace profiles.|$|E

6000|$|... "Why, very well, I think. You've <b>got</b> this <b>dress,</b> {{and your}} travelling-suit; and I can lend you {{whatever}} you want. Come!" [...] she added joyously, [...] "let's {{go up to}} your room, and talk it over!" ...|$|R

2500|$|On 14 April 1912, {{the night}} of the sinking, Lowe had been {{relieved}} at 8.00 PM by Sixth Officer Moody and was asleep in his quarters when the ship hit the iceberg at 11.40PM. He remained asleep through the collision and did not wake up until as much as half an hour had passed; as he explained later, [...] "We officers do not have any too much sleep, and therefore when we sleep, we die." [...] When Lowe finally awakened and realised the situation, he immediately <b>got</b> <b>dressed,</b> grabbed his revolver, and went to work. Third Officer Pitman charged him with loading lifeboat No. 5. Around 1.30AM, Lowe engaged in a conversation with Sixth Officer Moody: While launching lifeboat Nos. 14 and 16 on the port side of the ship, the two junior officers felt that this group of boats needed to have an officer with them. Moody insisted that Lowe should get onto lifeboat No. 14 and that he would get on another one. By the time lifeboat 14 was being launched, things were beginning to get precarious on the boat deck as the majority of passengers began to realise that the giant ship was foundering. As lifeboat 14 was descending, Lowe used his revolver to fire three shots into the air in order to frighten away a group of men attempting to leap into the lifeboat.|$|E
60|$|Ciccio <b>got</b> <b>dressed</b> {{as soon as}} possible, to go {{and look}} at the horses hired for the {{afternoon}} procession. Alvina accompanied him, Mr. May and the others were busy.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes!" [...] {{he replied}} heedlessly—"you know {{she ought to}} have sent the girl out with the kids this afternoon, and have <b>got</b> <b>dressed</b> directly. But no, she must sit gossiping with Emily all {{the time they were}} asleep, and then as soon as they wake up she begins to make cake——" ...|$|E
60|$|She then <b>got</b> a <b>dress</b> {{made for}} her own daughter, like the finest robe for a queen, {{and she had a}} mask {{prepared}} and put upon her face, so that she looked quite pretty, and gave her strict orders not to take it off until the king had promised to wed her.|$|R
60|$|The sun {{was shining}} on the snow when the tailor <b>got</b> up and <b>dressed,</b> and came {{out into the street}} with Simpkin running before him.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's not my {{business}} how passengers board these cars, {{so long as}} they're tolerably decent, and can pay their fare," [...] observed the conductor. [...] "Still, although we're not particular, we've <b>got</b> to <b>dress</b> you a little between us; and it mightn't {{be too much to}} ask what brought you here in such an outfit?" ...|$|R
60|$|I <b>got</b> <b>dressed</b> somehow. Jeeves hadn't {{forgotten}} a {{thing in}} his packing. Everything was there, down to the final stud. I'm not sure this didn't make me feel worse. It kind of deepened the pathos. It was like what somebody or other wrote about {{the touch of a}} vanished hand.|$|E
60|$|Before Jimmy <b>got</b> <b>dressed</b> {{and out of}} the {{gymnasium}} he, with difficulty, escaped a half-dozen more fistic encounters, as everybody from the manager down felt that his crime deserved nothing short of capital punishment. He had absolutely wrecked a perfectly good scheme in the perfection of which several thousand dollars had been spent, and now there could not be even the possibility of a chance of their breaking even.|$|E
60|$|They were {{laughing}} at their mother, who, {{dressed in a}} summer material of black and purple stripes, and wearing a hat of purple straw, was setting forth with much more of the shyness and trepidation {{of a young girl}} than her daughters ever felt, walking demurely beside her husband, who, as usual, looked rather crumpled in his best suit, {{as if he were the}} father of a young family and had been holding the baby whilst his wife <b>got</b> <b>dressed.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "She's {{going to}} a dance, and she's <b>got</b> the sweetest <b>dress</b> for it--creamy yellow silk and cobwebby lace. It just suits those brown tints of hers." ...|$|R
60|$|That night I woke at two o'clock, {{to find it}} {{bright as}} day, almost, with {{moonlight}} coming in through the flimsy curtains. And, smitten with the feeling which comes to us creatures of routine so rarely--of what beauty and strangeness we let slip by without ever stretching out hand to grasp it--I <b>got</b> up, <b>dressed,</b> stole downstairs, and out.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{directly}} {{everybody was}} asleep last night--it wasn't till after one, {{as there was}} a rag on--Moriarty and I <b>got</b> up, <b>dressed,</b> and climbed up into the gallery. Ye know the gallery windows? They open at the top, an' it's rather hard {{to get out of}} them. But we managed it, and dropped on to the gravel outside." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Daisy's all dressed," [...] said Mrs. Miller {{with that}} accent of the dispassionate, if {{not of the}} philosophic, {{historian}} with which she always recorded the current incidents of her daughter's career. [...] "She <b>got</b> <b>dressed</b> on purpose before dinner. But she's got {{a friend of hers}} there; that gentleman--the Italian--that she wanted to bring. They've got going at the piano; it seems as if they couldn't leave off. Mr. Giovanelli sings splendidly. But I guess they'll come before very long," [...] concluded Mrs. Miller hopefully.|$|E
6000|$|He {{seemed so}} brave and innocent, that {{although}} I had not proposed the contest, I felt but a gloomy satisfaction in my victory. Indeed, I {{go so far}} as to hope that I regarded myself while dressing as a species of savage young wolf or other wild beast. However, I <b>got</b> <b>dressed,</b> darkly wiping my sanguinary face at intervals, and I said, [...] "Can I help you?" [...] and he said [...] "No thankee," [...] and I said [...] "Good afternoon," [...] and he said [...] "Same to you." ...|$|E
60|$|Slowly, economically, he <b>got</b> <b>dressed</b> {{and forced}} himself to walk. Everything was obscure, except just what he had his hands on. But {{he managed to get}} through his work. The very pain revived his dull senses. The worst {{remained}} yet. He took the tray and went up to the Captain's room. The officer, pale and heavy, sat at the table. The orderly, as he saluted, felt himself put out of existence. He stood still for a moment submitting to his own nullification, then he gathered himself, seemed to regain himself, and then the Captain began to grow vague, unreal, and the younger soldier's heart beat up. He clung to this situation--that the Captain did not exist--so that he himself might live. But when he saw his officer's hand tremble as he took the coffee, he felt everything falling shattered. And he went away, feeling as if he himself were coming to pieces, disintegrated. And when the Captain was there on horseback, giving orders, while he himself stood, with rifle and knapsack, sick with pain, {{he felt as if he}} must shut his eyes--as if he must shut his eyes on everything. It was only the long agony of marching with a parched throat that filled him with one single, sleep-heavy intention: to save himself.|$|E
5000|$|Amber Benson {{said in an}} {{interview}} to Buffy magazine that [...] "I'm the biggest klutz on the set. Remember Emma in that wedding <b>dress?</b> I <b>got</b> that <b>dress</b> off of her at least four times, because I'd be following her and I'd step on the dress and she'd be pulling it back up. But she looked gorgeous in that dress." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{have done}} with frivolity. This morning I was awakened by Mrs. Sutherland at the door. [...] "There's a ship ashore at Shaltigoe!" [...] As my senses slowly flooded, I heard the {{whistling}} and the roaring of wind, and the lashing of gust-blown and uncertain flaws of rain. I <b>got</b> up, <b>dressed,</b> and went out. The mizzled sky and rain blinded you.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes,--and Herefordshire,--and {{other places}} generally. If I've <b>got</b> to <b>dress</b> I'd better {{get across the}} park as quick as I can go," [...] and so he left them. Mary turned round {{and looked at her}} cousin, but at the moment said nothing. Arthur's passion was well known to Mary Wharton, but Mary had as yet heard nothing of Ferdinand Lopez.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, what do {{you think}} I did after he'd gone? I went and played a piece on the piano,--and I never can bear to hear that ragtime to this day. I couldn't seem to feel anything. And after a while I got up and opened the envelope--it was full of crackly new hundred dollar bills--thirty of 'em, and as I sat there staring at 'em the pain came on, like a toothache, in throbs, getting worse all the time until I just couldn't stand it. I had a notion of sending the money back even then, but I didn't. I didn't know how to do it,--and as I told you, I wasn't able to care much. Then I remembered I'd promised to go away, and I had to have some money for that, and if I didn't leave right off I wouldn't have the {{strength}} to do it. I hadn't even thought where to go: I couldn't think, so I <b>got</b> <b>dressed</b> and went down to the depot anyway. It was one of those bright, bitter cold winter days after a thaw when the icicles are hanging everywhere. I went inside and walked up and down that long platform under the glass roof. My, it was cold in there! I looked over all the signs, and made up my mind I'd go to Chicago.|$|E
6000|$|And in a {{few minutes}} Paul heard his father's heavy steps go thudding over the {{deadening}} snow. Miners called in the streets as they tramped in gangs to work. The terrible, long-drawn breaths continued--heave--heave--heave; then a long pause--then--ah-h-h-h-h! as it came back. Far away over the snow sounded the hooters of the ironworks. One after another they crowed and boomed, some small and far away, some near, the blowers of the collieries and the other works. Then there was silence. He mended the fire. The great breaths broke the silence--she looked just the same. He put back the blind and peered out. Still it was dark. Perhaps there was a lighter tinge. Perhaps the snow was bluer. He drew up the blind and <b>got</b> <b>dressed.</b> Then, shuddering, he drank brandy from the bottle on the wash-stand. The snow WAS growing blue. He heard a cart clanking down the street. Yes, it was seven o'clock, and it was coming a little bit light. He heard some people calling. The world was waking. A grey, deathly dawn crept over the snow. Yes, he could see the houses. He put out the gas. It seemed very dark. The breathing came still, but he was almost used to it. He could see her. She was just the same. He wondered if he piled heavy clothes on top of her it would stop. He looked at her. That was not her--not her a bit. If he piled the blanket and heavy coats on her-- ...|$|E
