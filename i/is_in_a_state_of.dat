5|$|Although {{commonly}} {{included in}} botany curricula and textbooks, fungi are {{more closely related}} to animals than to plants and are placed with the animals in the monophyletic group of opisthokonts. Analyses using molecular phylogenetics support a monophyletic origin of the Fungi. The taxonomy of the Fungi <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> constant flux, especially due to recent research based on DNA comparisons. These current phylogenetic analyses often overturn classifications based on older and sometimes less discriminative methods based on morphological features and biological species concepts obtained from experimental matings.|$|E

The Federation enlists the Enterprise to take Timicin to a sun in a similar state of decay to conduct experiments which may yield a method for saving the Kaelon system from destruction.|$|E
5|$|The type {{species is}} M. carinatus; seven other {{species have been}} named during the past 150years, but only M. kaalae among these is still {{considered}} valid. Early sauropodomorphs systematics have undergone numerous revisions during the last several years, and many scientists disagree where exactly Massospondylus lies on the dinosaur evolutionary tree. The family name Massospondylidae was once coined for the genus, but because knowledge of early sauropodomorph relationships <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> flux, it is unclear which other dinosaurs—if any—belong in a natural grouping of massospondylids; several 2007 papers support the family's validity.|$|E
5|$|Bulgaria <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> {{demographic}} crisis. It has had negative {{population growth}} {{since the early}} 1990s, when the economic collapse caused a long-lasting emigration wave. Some 937,000 to 1,200,000 people—mostly young adults—left the country by 2005. The total fertility rate (TFR) was estimated in 2013 at 1.43 children born/woman, which is below the replacement rate of 2.1. A third of all households consist of only one person and 75.5 percent of families do not have {{children under the age}} of 16. Consequently, population growth and birth rates are among the lowest in the world while death rates are among the highest. The majority of children are born to unmarried women (of all births 57.4 percent were outside marriage in 2012).|$|E

5|$|The USS Enterprise {{receives}} a distress call from Dr. Howard Clarke (Paul Lambert), {{the leader of}} a Federation scientific delegation on Ventax II, where the population <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> panic because they are convinced that their world will soon end. After the Enterprise arrives, they rescue Dr. Clarke who brings them up to date: a thousand years ago, according to Ventaxian history, the population entered a Faustian deal with Ardra, their mythology's devil. In exchange for ending wars and restoring the ecological balance, and improving their heavily polluted planet, the population would become the personal slaves of Ardra a thousand years later. As the millennium is about to come to a close, the planet has recently begun experiencing mild earthquakes as well as seeing images of Ardra in the skies. These were said to be signs of her arrival.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of a stable star <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> hydrostatic equilibrium: the forces on any small volume almost exactly counterbalance each other. The balanced forces are inward gravitational force and an outward force due to the pressure gradient within the star. The pressure gradient is established by the temperature gradient of the plasma; the outer part of the star is cooler than the core. The temperature {{at the core of}} a main sequence or giant star is at least on the order of 107 K. The resulting temperature and pressure at the hydrogen-burning core of a main sequence star are sufficient for nuclear fusion to occur and for sufficient energy to be produced to prevent further collapse of the star.|$|E
5|$|The {{last two}} playable {{characters}} are Frog and Magus. Frog originated in AD 600. He {{is a former}} squire once named Glenn, who was turned into an anthropomorphic frog by Magus, who also killed his friend Cyrus. Chivalrous but mired in regret, Frog dedicates his life to protecting Leene, the queen of Guardia, and avenging Cyrus. Meanwhile, Guardia in AD 600 <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> conflict against the Mystics (known as Fiends in the US/DS port), a race of demons and intelligent animals who wage war against humanity {{under the leadership of}} Magus, a powerful sorcerer. Magus's seclusion conceals a long-lost past; he was formerly known as Janus, the young prince of the Kingdom of Zeal, which was destroyed by Lavos in 12,000 BC. The incident sent him forward through time, and as he ages, he plots revenge against Lavos and broods over the fate of his sister, Schala. Lavos, the game's main antagonist who awakens and ravages the world in AD 1999, is an extraterrestrial, parasitic creature that harvests DNA and the Earth's energy for its own growth.|$|E

5|$|The {{lesser yellow-headed vulture}} is a {{scavenger}} and subsists {{almost entirely}} on carrion. It will eat roadkill or the carcass of any animal, but is also known to hunt for food, especially small aquatic animals in marshes. It prefers fresh meat, but often cannot make the first cut into the carcass of a larger animal because its beak is {{not strong enough to}} tear into the tough hide. The lesser yellow-headed vulture will no longer feed on a piece of carrion once the meat <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> extreme decay, as it becomes contaminated with microbial toxins. Like other vultures, it {{plays an important role in}} its ecosystem by disposing of carrion which would otherwise be a breeding ground for disease.|$|E

After infiltrating Grievous's flagship, the Jedi battle Dooku, who Anakin eventually subdues and, on Palpatine's urging, executes. Grievous flees the battle-torn cruiser, which the Jedi crash-land on Coruscant. There, Anakin reunites with his wife, Padmé Amidala, who reveals she is pregnant. While initially excited, Anakin begins to have prophetic visions of Padmé dying in childbirth, and his worry steadily grows.|$|E
