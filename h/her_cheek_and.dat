5|$|Light {{falls on}} the {{pictorial}} space from the left, creating shadows against the back wall, the strongest cast by the girl's hennin. The depth of space provided by the back wall gives room for this detailing, which Charles Sterling believes is indebted to van Eyck. The light throws a murky but curved shadow {{on the wall behind}} the girl and acts as a counterpoint to the contour of <b>her</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>and</b> hairline.|$|E
5|$|During {{a routine}} liposuction {{operation}} in Winnetka, Illinois, Dr. Harrison Lloyd (John Juliani) suddenly begins to remove so much fat {{from a patient}} that the patient dies. Following the unusual experience, Lloyd tells Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) that he killed the patient because he was possessed. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) is skeptical about Lloyd's claims, believing he's only making it up to escape legal consequences. Mulder inspects the operation room and discovers a pentagram burned into the floor; he begins to suspect that witchcraft might have {{played a part in}} the crime. Meanwhile, the staff at Lloyd's clinic are shocked when another plastic surgeon, Dr. Ilaqua (Paul Raskin), murders an elderly patient by burning a hole through <b>her</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>and</b> neck with a surgical laser, severing her brain stem. Scully interviews Ilaqua, who claims that he cannot remember anything of the incident. Mulder's suspicions are strengthened when he reviews the tape of the second murder, and he sees a pentagram-like pattern on the stomach of the victim.|$|E
25|$|After Madotsuki {{falls to}} sleep, {{she begins to}} dream. The player is then {{presented}} with a dream world which resembles the same room Madotsuki lives in. In the dream world, the player is able to leave the room, which {{will lead to a}} nexus of 12 doors, with each leading to a different world, including a colorful neon maze, a forest, a world littered with numerical symbols, and a world full of body parts, among others. These 12 worlds, in turn, connect to a number of other worlds, forming a large and expansive area for the player to explore. The purpose of the game is for the player to navigate the main character's dream worlds to obtain 24 objects, known as effects. The player can attempt to interact with objects, although few will provide any response. The player can choose to wake from the dream world at any time, by causing Madotsuki to pinch <b>her</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>and</b> awaken. This behavior ensures that the player has {{a way out of the}} dream world at all times.|$|E

500|$|This dear {{child will}} not live; I am perpetually fearing it, {{notwithstanding}} the clear health which crimsons <b>her</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>and</b> glitters in her eyes. Such early expansion {{of intelligence and}} sensibility partakes {{too much of the}} angelic, too little of the mortal nature, to tarry long in these low abodes of frailty and of pain, where the harshness of authority, and the impenetrability of selfishness, with the worse mischiefs of pride and envy, so frequently agitate by their storms, and chill by their damps, the more ingenious and purer spirits, scattered, not profusely, over the earth.|$|E
500|$|Steve Helling of People {{magazine}} {{wrote that}} Lovato shows her mature {{side in the}} video, saying that [...] "it's hard not to notice that the 16-year-old Camp Rock star is growing up." [...] The video begins in a tour bus with Lovato's band. She is seen sitting next to a window {{in the back of}} the bus, where she precedes to sing the first lines. As the song progresses, she walks out of the bus in the rain, holding an umbrella. She walks out of the parking lot and into an amusement park, where she stands in front of a carousel in the rain as she continues to sing. After the second chorus, Lovato and her band perform in the rain with the water altering colors in the background. As the last verse approaches, she is back on the tour bus. A single tear rolls down <b>her</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>and</b> the video ends.|$|E
2500|$|Although Helnwein's work {{is rooted}} in the legacy of German expressionism, he has absorbed {{elements}} of American pop culture. In the 1970s, he began to include cartoon characters in his paintings. In several interviews he claimed: [...] "I learned more from Donald Duck than from all the schools that I have ever attended." [...] Commenting on that aspect in Helnwein's work, Julia Pascal wrote in the New Statesman: [...] "His early watercolor Peinlich (Embarrassing) shows a typical little 1950s girl in a pink dress and carrying a comic book. Her innocent appeal is destroyed by the gash deforming <b>her</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>and</b> lips. It is as if Donald Duck had met Mengele".|$|E

2500|$|Rola's {{television}} persona comprises distinctive characteristics, exuding {{an overall}} childlike naiveté, innocence, and playfulness. Signature affectations such as puffing her cheeks in embarrassment, holding an [...] "OK" [...] hand gesture over <b>her</b> <b>cheek,</b> <b>and</b> curling her tongue over {{her upper lip}} make Rola a common subject for Japanese impersonators, who also mimic her ditzy responses and constant giggles. She falls within the model-idol category of Japanese [...] "talent" [...] (tarento) as not actually possessing any particular talent, but Rola also presents comic possibilities by her mere presence. In the wake of Rola's popularity, aspiring talent Arie Mizusawa began appearing on Japanese television sporting cute affectations nearly identical to Rola, to an extent that entertainment media referred to Mizusawa as [...] "Rola 2" [...] and both she and Rola as [...] "twins".|$|E
2500|$|However, in {{the series}} finale, she does not become {{headmistress}} {{at the start of}} term as expected; Snape is appointed by the new Minister for Magic Thicknesse, who is actually under the Imperius Curse and acting for Voldemort. Death eater Alecto Carrow replaces McGonagall as deputy headmistress. Despite the many changes, she is retained as head of Gryffindor House. Before the Battle of Hogwarts, she goes to the Ravenclaw tower and finds Alecto stunned by Luna and Amycus Carrow searching for Harry. She's surprised when Amycus tells her Voldemort warned them Harry would try to break into the Ravenclaw Tower, proudly telling him Harry has no business on the Ravenclaw Tower, for Harry is in her House, Gryffindor. When Amycus suggests blaming the students to compensate for his sister's state, McGonagall immediately intervenes. In response, Amycus spits in her face. Harry, who is present and hidden under his invisibility cloak, reveals himself and uses the Cruciatus Curse on Amycus. [...] Harry then informs McGonagall that Voldemort is on his way and after tying up both the Carrows and placing them in a net, she sends three Patronuses – which manifest into a cat-to warn the other three Heads of House. When on her way to meet the Heads of House, she meets Snape, who questions her about Harry's whereabouts. Not realising that Snape is a re-doubled agent acting for the good side and not knowing that he has important information for Harry, she attacks him, engaging in a fierce duel. With help from Professors Sprout and Flitwick, she succeeds in driving Snape away. McGonagall then takes charge of the school again and proceeds to secure it against Voldemort to ensure Harry can fulfil his mission from Dumbledore. She also organises the evacuation of the school's under-age students to ensure their safety. She then leads the remaining students, the staff of Hogwarts, and members of the Order of the Phoenix in the fight against Voldemort. She is seen during the battle with a large gash on <b>her</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>and</b> commanding a herd of charmed desks to charge at Death Eaters. When Harry has been apparently killed, she screams, causing Bellatrix Lestrange to laugh. Finally, McGonagall ends up duelling Voldemort alongside Kingsley Shacklebolt and Professor Slughorn. As is confirmed in The Tales of Beedle the Bard, McGonagall becomes Headmistress of Hogwarts after the Battle of Hogwarts and Snape's death; however, in an interview Rowling said McGonagall would be retired {{by the time of the}} Deathly Hallows epilogue (19 years after the main events of Deathly Hallows), as she is [...] "getting on in years".|$|E

60|$|He went out, and Sally {{turned to}} Hawtrey with the color in <b>her</b> <b>cheeks</b> <b>and</b> a flash in her eyes.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} him with a faint colour in <b>her</b> <b>cheeks</b> <b>and</b> a softer light in her proud, clear eyes.|$|R
60|$|She turned round {{upon him}} with colour enough in <b>her</b> <b>cheeks</b> <b>and</b> a strange angry light burning in her eyes.|$|R
60|$|A tear {{ran down}} <b>her</b> <b>cheek,</b> <b>and</b> {{was caught in}} a furrow near the mouth.|$|E

60|$|He {{looked up}} at her then, sidelong. The curve of <b>her</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>and</b> chin looked very soft, and rather jolly.|$|E

60|$|Virginia sat {{upright in}} her seat. A very {{becoming}} touch of colour had stolen into <b>her</b> <b>cheeks,</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> eyes were bright.|$|R
60|$|Without in {{the least}} {{understanding}} him, the color had leaped to <b>her</b> <b>cheek,</b> <b>and</b> the consciousness of it made her furious.|$|E
60|$|A faint blush {{of shame}} mantled <b>her</b> <b>cheek,</b> <b>and</b> into {{her blue eyes}} there came a look of pain, but she faced him bravely.|$|E
