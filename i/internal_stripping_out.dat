40|$|The {{search is}} now on for, new {{materials}} {{that can be used}} for ionic stripping. Materials that maximize the stripping of the structural ion are important for conducting experiments with quark-gluon plasma. Although this paper is a theoretical study, it offers practical application, in heavy-ion accelerators, of the new effect of collision multiplicity with high-energy ions interacting with polyatomic targets. It is shown that internal nanostructured targets in which the collision multiplicity effect is manifested can more efficiently <b>strip</b> <b>out</b> structural ions compared to standard <b>internal</b> targets for <b>stripping.</b> A target consisting of oriented nano-tubes with the $C_{ 240 }$ chirality (10, 0) is considered as an example. A comparison with the stripping process on a carbon target with the same number of misaligned atoms in a unit of volume $C$ is provided...|$|R
