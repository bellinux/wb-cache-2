5|$|Geißhardt, who {{was flying}} Fw 190 A-4 (Werknummer 7051—factory number) in Priller's Schwarm, was {{severely}} wounded in combat with United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) B-17 Flying Fortress of the 306th Bomb Group on 5 April 1943. He <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> the defensive {{fire from the}} bombers. He was bleeding profusely from an abdominal wound but managed to make a smooth landing on the airfield at Sint-Denijs-Westrem, Belgium. He succumbed to his injuries {{early the next morning}} on 6 April 1943.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{recreate}} the atomic bombing of Nagasaki, RSP studied natural phenomena such as volcanoes, instead of relying on archived footage of atomic blasts, and recreated the effects digitally. They also replaced the Sydney cityscape on the horizon with views of Nagasaki. The walking bear featured in the Yukon scenes was created with computer graphics by Weta Digital, while Make-Up Effects Group built a 12 foot tall animatronic bear, that was used for shots of the creature dying after it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> poisoned arrows fired by hunters.|$|E
5|$|Yamashiro {{increased}} speed, but she <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> {{two to four}} torpedoes, {{and after}} two more torpedo hits near the starboard engine room, she was listing 45 degrees to port. Shinoda gave the command to abandon ship, but neither he nor Nishimura made any attempt to leave the conning tower as the ship capsized within five minutes and quickly sank, stern first, vanishing from radar between 04:19 and 04:21. Only 10 crewmembers of the estimated 1,636 officers and crew on board survived.|$|E

5|$|Completing {{his course}} at Upavon, McNamara was posted back to Egypt in August, but was hospitalised on 8 September with orchitis. Discharged on 6 October, he served briefly as a flying {{instructor}} with No.22 Squadron RFC, {{before returning to}} No.1 Squadron. McNamara flew with CFlight, commanded by Captain (later Air Marshal Sir) Richard Williams. On his first sortie, a reconnaissance mission over Sinai, McNamara was unaware that his plane <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> anti-aircraft fire; he returned to base with his engine's oil supply almost exhausted. Flying B.E.2s and Martinsydes, he undertook further scouting and bombing missions in the ensuing months.|$|E
5|$|For the Viet Cong, the Battle of Ap Bac {{marked the}} first time they stood and fought a large South Vietnamese formation—despite being outnumbered by more than five to one. Against {{overwhelming}} odds, the Viet Cong had achieved their first de facto victory; they had successfully held off well-equipped ARVN forces supported by artillery and armored units as well as by American airpower. Viet Cong casualties were limited to 18 soldiers killed and 39 wounded, even though their positions <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> more than 600 rounds of artillery, napalm and other ordnance released by 13 warplanes and five UH-1 gunships.|$|E
5|$|While {{the rivalry}} was {{somewhat}} subdued by the lopsidedness {{of the two}} teams records, the rivalry did provide some moments. On April 15, Mets pitcher Matt Harvey drilled Chase Utley in the back, after a few Mets pitchers <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> the Phillies. On August 25, during a game at Citizens Bank Park Phillies coach Larry Bowa started yelling out of the dugout after a quick pitch by Mets reliever Hansel Robles while Darin Ruf was in the box not looking up and not ready for the pitch. Bowa also yelled at Mets 1st baseman Daniel Murphy over a perceived slight by Murphy's bat flip earlier in the game during a home run. Benches cleared as Bowa threatened Murphy with retaliation and was ultimately ejected from the game.|$|E

5|$|He <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> a {{marksman}} {{from the}} Redoutable, firing {{at a range}} of 50feet (15m). The bullet had entered his left shoulder, passed through his spine at the sixth and seventh thoracic vertebrae, and lodged two inches (5cm) below his right shoulder blade in the muscles of his back. Nelson was carried below by sergeant-major of marines Robert Adair and two seamen. As he was being carried down, he asked them to pause while he gave some advice to a midshipman on {{the handling of the}} tiller. He then draped a handkerchief over his face to avoid causing alarm amongst the crew. He was taken to the surgeon William Beatty, telling him You can do nothing for me. I have but a short time to live. My back is shot through. Nelson was made comfortable, fanned and brought lemonade and watered wine to drink after he complained of feeling hot and thirsty. He asked several times to see Hardy, who was on deck supervising the battle, and asked Beatty to remember him to Emma, his daughter and his friends.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, the American Institute of Architects {{condemned}} the bombardment of the city's buildings. The Institute for the Protection of Cultural Monuments, {{in conjunction with}} UNESCO, found that, of the 824 buildings in the Old Town, 563 (or 68.33 percent) <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> projectiles during the siege. Of these 563, nine buildings had been completely destroyed by one of several major fires {{that occurred during the}} siege. In 1993, the Institute for the Rehabilitation of Dubrovnik and UNESCO estimated the total cost for restoring public, private, and religious buildings, streets, squares, fountains, ramparts, gates, and bridges at $9,657,578. By the end of 1999, over $7,000,000 had been spent on restoration. It {{is a testament to the}} resilience of the ancient walls that more buildings in the old town were not destroyed during the bombardment; the ancient walls in fact were more effective at resisting modern weaponry than contemporary structures in the city's periphery.|$|E
5|$|Jamal {{was taken}} {{at first to}} the Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza. Dr. Ahmed Ghadeel said Jamal had {{received}} multiple wounds from high-velocity bullets striking his right elbow, right thigh and {{the lower part of}} both legs; his femoral artery was also cut. Talal Abu Rahma interviewed Jamal and the doctor there on camera the day after the shooting; Dr. Ghadeel displayed x-rays of Jamal's right elbow and right pelvis. Moshe Tamam, Jamal's Israeli employer, offered to have him taken to hospital in Tel Aviv, but the Palestinian Authority declined the offer. He was transferred instead to the King Hussein Medical Center in Amman, Jordan, where he was visited by King Abdullah. Jamal reportedly told Tamam that he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> nine bullets; he said five were removed from his body in hospital in Gaza and four in Amman.|$|E

5|$|The {{engagement}} {{had lasted}} just ten minutes according to Shannons log, or eleven minutes by Lieutenant Wallis' watch. Broke more modestly claimed fifteen minutes in his official despatch. Shannon had lost 23 men killed, and had 56 wounded. Chesapeake had about 48 killed, including four lieutenants, the master {{and many other}} of her officers, and 99 wounded. Shannon <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> a total of 158 projectiles, Chesapeake by 362 (these figures include grapeshot). In the time the batteries of both ships were firing, the Americans {{had been exposed to}} 44 roundshot, whilst the British had received 10 or 11 in reply (these are figures for shot which would have produced casualties or material damage; some of Chesapeakes shot was fired low, bouncing off Shannons side at waterline level). Even before being boarded, Chesapeake had lost the gunnery duel by a considerable margin.|$|E
5|$|Vitgeft {{made another}} attempt {{to break through the}} Japanese {{blockade}} on 10 August in accordance to a direct order from the Tsar. The squadron was spotted relatively quickly and the Japanese main fleet intercepted the Russians in the early afternoon. During the Battle of the Yellow Sea, Poltava and Sevastopol were the last battleships in the Russian column and Poltava, which was slowed by engine problems, became the primary target of the Japanese battleships and armored cruisers when Vitgeft maneuvered the squadron past the Japanese and forced them into a stern chase. Shortly before sunset, a lucky hit killed Vitgeft and threw the squadron into confusion. The squadron second-in-command, Rear Admiral Prince Pavel Ukhtomsky, eventually gained control of the squadron and led most of them back to Port Arthur. Poltava <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> 12–14 shells, eight or 12 inches in caliber, and suffered 12 killed and 43 wounded; Sevastopol was only hit by several shells that killed one crewman and wounded 62 men.|$|E
5|$|Stengel, hired {{only days}} before spring training, had but a limited {{opportunity}} to shape his new ballclub. The Dodgers quickly settled into sixth place, {{where they would}} end the season. Stengel, in later years, enjoyed discussing one 1934 game in Philadelphia's Baker Bowl: with Dodger pitcher Boom-Boom Beck ineffective, Stengel {{went out to the}} mound to take out the angry pitcher, who, instead of giving Stengel the baseball, threw it into right field, where it hit the metal wall with a loud noise. The right fielder, Hack Wilson, lost in thought, heard the boom, assumed the ball <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> a batter, and ran to retrieve it and throw it to the infield, to be met by general laughter. Stengel got the last laughs on the Giants as well. The Giants, six games ahead of the Cardinals on Labor Day, dissipated that lead, and with two games in the season were tied with St. Louis—with the final two games against Brooklyn at the Polo Grounds, games played in front of raucous crowds, who well remembered Terry's comments. Brooklyn won both games, while the Cardinals won their two games against the Cincinnati Reds, and won the pennant. Richard Bak, in his biography of Stengel, noted that the victories over the Terry-led Giants represented personal vindication for the Dodger manager.|$|E
