5|$|The {{first film}} {{screening}} in Turkey was at Yıldız Palace in 1896, {{a year after}} the technology publicly debuted in Paris. Movie theaters rapidly cropped up in Beyoğlu, with the greatest concentration of theaters being along the street now known as İstiklal Avenue. Istanbul also became the heart of Turkey's nascent film industry, although Turkish films were not consistently developed until the 1950s. Since then, Istanbul has been the most popular location to film Turkish dramas and comedies. The Turkish film industry ramped up {{in the second half of}} the century, and with Uzak (2002) and My <b>Father</b> <b>and</b> <b>My</b> Son (2005), both filmed in Istanbul, the nation's movies began to see substantial international success. Istanbul and its picturesque skyline have also served as a backdrop for several foreign films, including Topkapi (1964), The World Is Not Enough (1999), and Mission Istaanbul (2008).|$|E

500|$|Although {{primarily}} a pop rock album, Laundry Service also draws influences {{from a variety}} of musical genres. The singer credited this to her mixed ethnicity, saying [...] "I am a fusion. That's my persona. I'm a fusion between black and white, between pop and rock, between cultures - between my Lebanese <b>father</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> mother's Spanish blood, the Colombian folklore and Arab dance I love and American music." [...] Arabian and Middle Eastern elements, which had a high influence on Dónde Están los Ladrones?, are also present in Laundry Service, most prominently on [...] "Eyes Like Yours" [...] (Ojos Así). Musical styles from different South American countries surface on the album. Tango, a style of fast-paced ballroom dance that originated in Argentina, is evident on [...] "Objection (Tango)", which also combines elements of rock and roll. The uptempo track features a guitar solo and a bridge in which Shakira delivers rap-like vocals. [...] "Whenever, Wherever" [...] blends pop rock with Andean music and contains instrumentation from panpipes and the charango - traditional instruments generally associated with the genre.|$|E

2500|$|Sauron {{was killed}} again by Gil-galad and Elendil {{at the end}} of the Last Alliance. The Ring was cut from Sauron's hand by Elendil's son, Isildur, on the slopes of Mount Doom. Though counselled to destroy the Ring, he was swayed by its power and kept it safe instead, [...] "as weregild for my <b>father,</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> brother". [...] A few years later, Isildur was ambushed by orcs by the River Anduin near the Gladden Fields; he put on the Ring to escape, but it slipped from his finger as he swam across the river, and, {{suddenly}} visible, he was killed by the orcs. Since the Ring indirectly caused Isildur's death, it was known in Gondorian lore as [...] "Isildur's Bane".|$|E

2500|$|Nonetheless, in November 2004 {{an issue}} of Point de Vue had {{announced}} that henceforth the magazine would accord the Bonapartist title of pretence, [...] "the Prince Napoleon", to Jean-Christophe, whereas since 1997 that title had been attributed to Charles. This decision followed receipt by the magazine of a protest from Jean-Marc Varaut, prompted by publication in an earlier issue of a reference to Charles as [...] "head of the Imperial house". Point de Vue, which sometimes gazettes monarchist announcements, published Varaut's re-assertion of the dynastic exclusion of Charles along with the prince's response: [...] "...the title of 'head of family' among the Bonapartes devolves, at {{the death of the}} father, upon his eldest son. That rule is not susceptible to modification by the titleholder, a fortiori when the motives involved are petty and contrary to the Civil Code. I have the honour of bearing this charge since the death of my <b>father,</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> son will assume it in turn upon my death." ...|$|E

Since returning to the FLDS, Betty has openly disputed the claims in Carolyn's book, particularly those alleging that Merril Jessop was abusive, saying [...] "it just makes me want to laugh." [...] She describes her years outside of the sect as traumatic, explaining that public school was a shock and that the task of caring for her siblings fell to her due to her mother's health problems: [...] "With the responsibility landing on me so hard every morning, I was an emotional wreck, and after a while, I hardened into a frazzled bundle of nerves." [...] She added, [...] "I was such a representation of everything [...] hated so much.
