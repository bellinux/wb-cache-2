5000|$|Cross Rhythms Philip Croft {{said that}} [...] "on first {{impression}} I {{have to admit}} that I was a little disappointed with this album as the songs seemed to lack immediacy.

I decided to persevere though and played the CD several times driving to and from work and it was amazing how the songs grew on me. There is a real lyrical depth to this one that no doubt comes from the experience and growing maturity that Bebo Norman now has. Intelligent pop rock by a man clearly working through some deep spiritual issues." ...|$|R
5000|$|Discussing {{the scene}} where Emily was {{attacked}} by Richard Hillman in 2003, critic Chris Diamond wryly commented: [...] "Surely Emily wouldnt be {{in the line of}} fire?

And that was where the genius of the episode lay. I knew Emily was going to get it. I saw Richard creeping up behind her and I was fully cognoscent of the fact that the crowbar in his hand was not for snagging her cardie. But I was sure that even at this point something was going to happen that would divert Richard from his target. When the blow actually fell I was utterly amazed." ...|$|R
50|$|There was a {{constant}} battle, though, as some of our results ran full tilt into my intellectual ideas. In the beginning, I {{took it for granted}} that Seth was a subconscious fantasy, personified, because <b>I</b> simply <b>couldnt</b> accept the possibility of spirits or, for that matter, life after death. Then, after it became obvious that the Seth sessions were going to continue, we kept constant check on my personality characteristics and went to a psychologist - as any sane, red-blooded American would do under such circumstances in those days. Seth seemed far more mature and well-balanced than the psychologist, so finally I stopped worrying. Besides, my personality showed no adverse signs of instability. If anything, I was more competent in handling physical affairs. This is not to say the experience did not cause certain strains and stresses that could accompany any worthwhile venture in an entirely new field.|$|R

5000|$|In 2005, Pauline embarks on {{a romance}} {{with a new}} character, Joe Macer (Ray Brooks), whom she meets at salsa classes. A {{relationship}} develops, and despite her initial trepidation, Pauline remarries in 2006, after almost a decade alone. Paulines marriage to Joe {{was an attempt to}} give the character a [...] "new lease of life", and her wedding day was screened to coincide with EastEnders 21st anniversary. Richard was openly opposed to her character remarrying, but she was eventually convinced by the executive producer and battled, successfully, for Pauline to keep the [...] "Fowler" [...] surname. However, in July 2006, Wendy Richard announced that she was leaving EastEnders; she quit due to [...] "creative differences" [...] with the shows producers regarding Paulines remarriage, which she felt was [...] "disloyal" [...] to her characters beloved first husband, Arthur. According to an interview in The Sun, Richard commented, [...] "I think its the most terrible shame, I really do. I thought in my heart of hearts it was wrong ... <b>I</b> just <b>couldnt</b> believe that Pauline would remarry—anybody ... I would have stayed a bit longer if Pauline hadnt got married." [...] Richard felt that she did not have the same chemistry with Ray Brooks, who played Joe, as she did with Bill Treacher, who played Arthur. She refuted producers opinions that Pauline and Joe [...] "looked good together" [...] and felt that she and Brooks had to work very hard to turn them into a [...] "realistic-looking couple." ...|$|R

5000|$|Around this time, Çehre met {{and began}} a {{relationship}} with a basketball player from the Turkish sports club Galatasaray, Yavuz Demir. Through her relationship with Demir, Çehre later explained that [...] "he Demir helped me to win over my tendency to become easily startled and frightened which I had lived through at a young age. He caused me to win my self-confidence back." [...] Çehre and Demir married in 1976, this having been the second marriage for Çehre, and the third for Demir, who would marry five times within his life. Çehre always noted how her previous husband Yılmaz Güney and her second husband Yavuz Demir were [...] "the complete opposite to one another", Güney having had [...] "a hot temper", and Demir having had a comfortable, softer, self-controlled and calm personality. At one stage during her marriage to Demir, Çehre fell pregnant, although, sensing that her relationship with Demir wasnt going to last, she had an abortion. Çehre would later explain that, [...] "I had lost my own father {{at a very young age}} and grew up with a step-father. As a small girl I had suffered greatly because of this in a serious form. Because I grew up without a father, I didnt want to raise a fatherless child. I made myself a promise: If I have a marriage that I can carry on with and if its a happy marriage, I will have my own child." [...] Çehre divorced Demir in 1979, their relationship having had lasted for eight years. Çehre explained in later interviews that, [...] "Our relationship would have continued. <b>I</b> just <b>couldnt</b> become adapted to his Demirs life. Im conservative and confined to my own space. The life that I was living then Demir was extremely active. All those trips, visitors and crowds were drowning me... I understood that I wasnt going to be able to carry on and keep in step with his fast lifestyle..." [...] Demir died in 2006 and Çehre had attended his funeral.|$|R
5000|$|Matthews most {{prominent}} storyline spans {{a year and}} begins on the Valentines day episode in February 1999. After developing a friendship with club owner Steve Owen (Martin Kemp), Matthew is present to witness Steve accidentally killing his ex-girlfriend Saskia Duncan (Deborah Sheridan-Taylor) by hitting her {{on the head with}} a marbel ashtray following her jealous attack on him. Saskias death was first screened in a lengthened 45-minute episode on a Sunday evening, deviating from EastEnders typical broadcasting weekday slots. Executive producer Matthew Robinson has alleged that Saskias death scene had to be reshot because it was deemed too violent: [...] "When we played back the film, it was fantastic - too fantastic. It looked so real that <b>I</b> knew we <b>couldnt</b> broadcast it. EastEnders goes out before the nine oclock watershed, children watch it - and we cant show outright scenes of graphic violence. We had to do the whole thing again. It took almost two hours and the three actors were emotionally and physically exhausted. In the end we got what we wanted." [...] After the killing, Steve fears that police will not believe it was an accident, convinces Matthew to help him cover-up the death and they bundle Saskias body into a bin liner and bury it in a wood. Robinson said, [...] "This is an exciting plot and itll keep us occupied for much of the next year." ...|$|R
5000|$|Following Black Sabbaths 1972-1973 {{world tour}} {{in support of}} their album, Volume 4, the group {{returned}} to Los Angeles to begin work on its successor. Pleased with Volume 4, the band sought to recreate the recording atmosphere, {{and returned to the}} Record Plant Studios. The band rented a house in Bel Air and began writing in the summer of 1973 but, due in part to substance abuse and fatigue, were unable to complete any songs. [...] "Ideas werent coming out the way they were on Volume 4 and we really got discontent," [...] guitarist and songwriter Tony Iommi said. [...] "Everybody was sitting there waiting for me to come up with something. <b>I</b> just <b>couldnt</b> think of anything. And if I didnt come up with anything, nobody would do anything." [...] In 2013, bassist Geezer Butler told Mojo magazine that after the tour in support of Vol. 4 the band was [...] "absolutely, completely exhausted" [...] {{and by the time they}} played the Hollywood Bowl, [...] "Tony collapsed. It was really touch-and-go at one point whether hed survive or not because he was totally depleted. So we had to cancel the rest of the tour and we actually took time off for the first time since the band started. We got away from each other and had a social life. Then we came back together to start on the next album, and couldnt come up with anything." [...] In his autobiography I Am Ozzy, singer Ozzy Osbourne states that in the time leading up to the Hollywood Bowl [...] "Tony had been doing coke literally for days - we all had, but Tony had gone over the edge. I mean, that stuff just twists your whole idea of reality. You start seeing things that arent there. And Tony was gone. Near the end of the gig he walked off stage and collapsed." [...] Regarding his writers block, Iommi admitted to Phil Alexander in 2013, [...] "I panicked because I didnt have a single idea about what to write. It might have been the drugs, it could have been the pressure, but either way I felt it was my fault." [...] The band were also disappointed to discover that the room they had used previously at the Record Plant had been replaced with a [...] "giant synthesizer" [...] by Stevie Wonder, who had recently recorded there.|$|R
