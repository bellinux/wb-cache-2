40|$|Progressive legal {{scholars}} and practitioners {{have created a}} hierarchy within social justice lawyering. <b>Direct</b> <b>service</b> attorneys-nonprofit attorneys who focus on helping individuals in civil cases-sit at the bottom. In the 1960 s, progressive theorists advanced a negative portrayal of <b>direct</b> <b>service</b> attorneys as a class. This discourse has continued through different phases {{in the development of}} progressive legal theory. <b>Direct</b> <b>service</b> work is done primarily by women in the service of women, has the aesthetic of traditional women 2 ̆ 7 s work, and can be understood as embodying the thesis that women have a greater existential and psychological connection to others than men. Like other forms of women 2 ̆ 7 s work, <b>direct</b> <b>service</b> work often goes unrecognized even though more visible progressive work depends on it. Negative portrayals of <b>direct</b> <b>service</b> attorneys employ a strategy of oppositional definition that is representative of binary male thinking and deny a positive view of <b>direct</b> <b>service</b> work as life-sustaining service to others. This article discusses the harms perpetuated by hierarchies of helping and sketches a more inclusive vision of progressive lawyering...|$|R

40|$|Volunteers {{can be an}} {{important}} resource of many nonprofit organizations. The ability to meet the mission, goals and objectives of nonprofit organizations often depends upon the effectiveness of volunteer involvement in <b>direct</b> <b>service</b> delivery or indirect program support. Volunteer involvement utilizes financial and non–financial resources of an organization. Given the challenges associated with coordinating and managing volunteers, nonprofit organizations should evaluate volunteer program initiatives. Utilizing a net benefits framework, this study evaluated volunteer programs in 4 -H to understand the value of direct and indirect volunteer involvement. Findings showed county 4 -H programs that utilized volunteers to provide <b>direct</b> <b>service</b> to clientele as–well–as volunteers in indirect program support roles had nearly 50 % higher total benefits compared to programs that only used <b>direct</b> <b>service</b> volunteers. Additionally, results indicated challenges associated with coordinating and managing volunteers did not increase for programs that involve both direct and indirect volunteers compared to those that only utilized <b>direct</b> <b>service</b> volunteers. Finally, this research provided evidence that net benefits accrued at a higher rate for nonprofits that utilize both <b>direct</b> and indirect <b>service</b> volunteers compared to those involving only <b>direct</b> <b>service</b> volunteers...|$|R
