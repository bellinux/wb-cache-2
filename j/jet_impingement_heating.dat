40|$|<b>Jet</b> <b>impingement</b> <b>heating</b> {{and cooling}} {{techniques}} are used extensively in industrial applications. {{in some of}} these installations, the axis of the jet can be inclined relative to the impingement surface. The impingement flow is then unsynLmetrical so that the heat transfer rates are modified. At present, {{there is a lack of}} information concerning the effect of inclination on jet impingement heat transfer. Thus, the experimental study reported in this thesis is primarily concerned with the measurement of local and average heat transfer coefficients associated with the impingement of inclined turbulent circular jets onto flat plates. A single free jet exiting into initially stagnant surroundings was considered and the nozzle inclination was varied from 300 to 900 to the surface. The tests covered the range: Z/d (nozzle-target separation) of 6 to 16 and Re (jet Reynolds number based on exit conditions) of 32500 to 65000. The effect of the exit nozzle shape was also determined. In multiple jet systems, the flow from the upstream jets can significantly affect those situated in the downstream section. Thus, the effect of nozzle inclination on the performance of an impinging jet exiting into a cross flow was also investigated. Thus, as well as the angle of inclination (a), the magnitude of the cross flow (Uc) and the width of the duct (H/d) were also altered in this confined situation. The ranges of these variables were 300 <a<l 350, 55 Uj/Uc 520. 9 and UH/d 426. A 'thin [...] film' naphthalene sublimation technique was used to measure the variation of the mass transfer rates over the impingement surface and these rates were converted to heat transfer data by invoking the Chilton-Colburn analogy between the two processes. The average heat transfer coefficients quoted in the'text were obtained by numerically integrating the local values. The thin-film naphthalene sublimation technique yielded repeatable results which were generally in good agreement with published data for the limited cases for which comparisons-were possible. ' For the unconfined jets, inclining the nozzle reduced the heat transfer rates. The stagnation point, impingement region and average heat transfer coefficients were correlated by means of simple power law relationships which involved the Reynolds number (Re), the nozzle-target separation (z/d) and the angle of inclination (a). Both circular and elliptical-shaped nozzles produced essentially similar results so that it appears that the shape of the velocity profile at the jet exit can be neglected for the conditions studied in this invest: i. gation. For the confined situations, it was found that superimposing a cross flow onto the jet reduced the heat transfer rates and this is in agreement with the results of previous investigators. At low cross flows, inclining the nozzle further reduced the heat transfer rates. However, at higher cross flows, inclining the nozzle could lead to an increase in heat transfer rates and an angle of inclination of approximately 600 was found to yield optimal results. This optimal appears to result from a balance between two conflicting effects, namely that inclination reduces heat transfer but also simultaneously increases the penetration of the jet upstream into the cross flow. Limited velocity and turbulence measurements were undertaken for the jets in order to characterise the flow. These measurements were in good agreement with data from previous investigations so that the heat transfer results from this study should be applicable in a fairly general manner. In order to explain the heat transfer results, flow visualization studies were also carried out...|$|E

The Shear-Stress-Transportation (SST) k-omega and # 61559; turbulence model {{was employed to}} simulate turbulence. Based on time-mean analysis, three flow regimes were identified for typical synthetic jet flows. Typical vortex dynamics and flow patterns were analyzed. The effects of changes of working frequency, cavity geometry (aspect ratio), and nozzle geometry were investigated. A control-volume model of synthetic jet cavity was proposed based on the numerical study, which consists of two first-order ODEs. With appropriately selected parameters, the model was able to predict the cavity pressure and average velocity through the nozzle within 10 % errors compared with full simulations. The cavity model {{can be used to}} generate the boundary conditions for synthetic jet simulations and the agreement to the full simulation results was good. The saving of computational cost is significant. It was found that synthetic <b>jet</b> <b>impingement</b> <b>heat</b> transfer outperforms conventional <b>jet</b> <b>impingement</b> <b>heat</b> transfer with equivalent average jet velocity.

Thin metal foil technique is used for characterising isothermal air jets. For a fixed jet Reynolds number, the Nusselt number of isothermal air jet is found independent of the temperature difference between jet and surrounding fluid. A steady state technique is proposed for characterisation of premixed flame jets. The outcome of the present study reveals that the heat transfer characteristics of isothermal air jet and the premixed flame jet are almost same.

In this paper, a laminar mist/air slot <b>jet</b> <b>impingement</b> has been considered. The target surface {{was assumed to be}} isothermal. The principal objective {{of this study is to}} investigate the associated heat transfer process in the mixed convection regime. The local nusselt number at the target surface for various conditions is presented. It is observed that the nusselt number increases when buoyancy force is taken in to account.

Increase the heat transfer rate by using three types of "nanofluids"namely,(water+Al 2 O 3), (water+ CuO) and (water + SiO 2) as a fluid <b>jet</b> <b>impingement</b> also studied [...] Effects of different Reynolds numbers (Red) in based nozzle different the ranges of (10000 - 30000) the performance of <b>jet</b> <b>impingement</b> <b>heat</b> transfer using a water <b>jet</b> <b>impingement</b> will be compared with that using "nanofluids" as the working fluid. Simulations are carried out in the form of dimensional (3 -D) and in a "steady state" by using ANSYS 14. 0 software that has been commercialized in the market. The results obtained from numerical simulations of <b>jet</b> <b>impingement</b> cooling the cylinders on the heated cylindrical tube will be presented. Heated surface of the cylinder tube will be maintained in a state of "Konstant heatflux". Geometric parameters such as the non-dimensional distance between the tip "nozzle" and the surface of the cylinder tube (h / d) was investigated in the amount of 4. 8 and 12. Variasi Nusselt numbers (Nud) along the circumferential and axial directions obtained from this study will be reported along with numerical the flow characteristics of <b>jet</b> <b>impingement.</b> It has been observed mainly in the areas of impact that Nud increased when h/d decreases. (Nud) increased by 21 % when the distance ratio h/d = 4 compared with the distance ratio h/d = 12. In the present work, the nanofluid of (SiO 2 + water) gave the best heat transfer performance compared to other nanofluids and pure water. For the case of (SiO 2 + water),Red = 30, 000, Nusselt number is 5 % higher than the case of (Al 2 O 3 + water). As well as same condition when use type (water + CuO), also Nusselt number decreasing in percent 8. 3 % compared with type (water + AL 2 O 3) and 13. 3 % compared with type (water + SiO 2). When using water Nusselt number decreased in percent 19 % compared with the nanofluid type (water + SiO 2), means the heat transfer rate is better when using nanofluid instead of water...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} surface {{roughness}} on <b>jet</b> <b>impingement</b> <b>heat</b> transfer {{was investigated in}} this research. A numerical analysis was conducted for free surface slot jet impinging normally onto a heated plate. Six different geometries and three different plate materials were investigated. The cooling fluid used for the analysis was water, and the flow was laminar {{with a range of}} Reynolds number (Re) from 500 to 1000. Temperature distribution, local and average heat transfer coefficient, and local and average Nusselt number were presented for each case. The steady state heat transfer results show that the increase in Reynolds number (Re) increases the local heat transfer coefficient and the local Nusselt number. Impinging the jet nozzle directly onto a step has a better heat transfer enhancement than impinging the jet nozzle in between steps. Materials with low thermal conductivity exhibit large variation in temperature along the solid-fluid interface. The variations of the interface temperature become smaller between all cases when applying the isothermal boundary condition. The transient heat transfer results show that the temperature of the interface increases with time until steady state condition is met. Materials with high thermal diffusivity reach the steady state condition with less time. The increase in surface roughness increases the time required to reach the steady state condition. The highest rates of heat transfer were found at locations where no fluid recirculation occurs. It takes less time to reach steady state condition when applying the isothermal boundary condition at the bottom surface of the plate...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of semiconductor fabrication process and electronic packaging technology causes {{the size and}} weight of electronic components to decrease consistently. Along with the increasing operating power, the heat generation rate of the electronic products apparently get higher. Efficient removal of heat from the electronic products in a limited space becomes a major task in electronics cooling. Air impingement cooling with a heat sink is an attractive option for electronic cooling, because it is inexpensive, robust and localized. Rapid heat transfer from heated surfaces and reducing material weight is also becoming a major task for design of heat exchanger equipment for electronic cooling. Rectangular plate fins as extended surfaces are good heat transfer equipment which are widely used for various industrial applications. Heat transfer rate can be improved by introducing perforations, porosity or slots. Moreover, due to restrictions in setup space and economic reasons, heat transfer equipment have been required {{to be much more}} compact in size and lighter in weight. Studies on three dimensional plate and pin fin heat sinks are extensive. But no focus has been yet given on air <b>jet</b> <b>impingement</b> <b>heat</b> transfer with perforated pin fin heat sink. Thermal-fluid characteristics of solid and perforated pin fin heat sinks cooled by confined air <b>jet</b> <b>impingement</b> are investigated numerically in this study. The SST k-ω turbulence model is used to predict the turbulence flow parameters. The numerical model is verified with previously published experimental data. Flow and heat transfer characteristics are presented for the impinging Reynolds number, Re= 5000 to 25000 having constant impingement distance (Y/D = 8), fin width (W/L = 0. 1) and height (H/L = 0. 5). The main objective {{of this study is to}} examine the effects of fin perforations on the thermal performance of pin fin heat sinks. Results show that thermal resistance decreases and fin efficiency increases with the increase of Reynolds number due to perforation. Thus, this kind of heat sink equipment reduce cooling power consumption rate...|$|R
40|$|Oblique flame <b>jet</b> <b>impingement</b> finds a {{wide range}} of {{domestic}} and industrial applications. An experimental investigation is carried out to study the effect of oblique flame <b>jet</b> <b>impingement</b> on the <b>heat</b> transfer characteristics. An asymmetric boundary layer is formed on the impingement surface due to oblique impingement. Steady state technique using one dimensional energy balance across the target plate is employed to determine the local heat transfer coefficient and the reference temperature of the impinging flame jet. The effect of the mixture Reynolds number (400 - 1200), mixture equivalence ratio (0. 8 - 1. 5), burner or plate inclination (0 - 45 degrees) and burner to plate distance (2 - 6 times the burner diameter) on the heat transfer characteristics are investigated. It is found that stoichiometric mixture provides optimum Nusselt number distribution and lower burner to plate spacing provides maximum effectiveness for impinging premixed cone flames. Normal <b>impingement</b> resulted smooth <b>heat</b> flux distribution and better thermal performance. Correlations are developed for stagnation point Nusselt number and effectiveness.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results obtained to date in a program to develop a high heat flux, single-phase heat exchanger for spacecraft thermal management. The intended application is a net generation interface heat exchanger to couple the crew module water thermal bus to the two-phase ammonia main thermal bus in the Space Station Freedom. The large size of the interface heat exchanger is dictated by the relatively poor water-side heat transfer characteristics. The objective of this program {{is to develop a}} single-phase heat transfer approach which can achieve heat fluxes and heat transfer coefficients comparable to those of the evaporation ammonia side. A new heat exchanger concept has been developed to meet these objecties. The main feature of this heat exchanger is that it can achieve very high heat fluxes with a pressure drop one to two orders of magnitude lower than those of previous microchannel or <b>jet</b> <b>impingement</b> high <b>heat</b> flux heat exchangers.

40|$|Heat {{transfer}} in gas turbine related applications is investigated by steady state liquid crystal thermography (LCT) in this thesis. The work presented includes {{outlet guide vane}} heat transfer and gas turbine internal cooling. The heat transfer on the outlet guide vane (OGV) surface and its endwall region is investigated experimentally in a linear cascade test facility. The inlet flow angle is varied from + 25 º (on-design), to + 40 º and - 25 º (off-design). The Reynolds numbers tested are 300, 000, and 450, 000. On the OGV surface, boundary layer transition and separation affect the heat transfer significantly and they vary significantly with the inlet flow angle. On the endwall region, {{the effects of a}} horseshoe vortex (HV) on the heat transfer are clearly noticed at the leading edge area. For off-design conditions, the HV becomes more energetic than that of the on-design condition and the pressure side leg departs from the OGV at the inlet flow angle α = - 25 º. Experimental investigation of heat transfer and pressure drop in the turn region of a two-pass channel has been carried out. Results indicate that heat transfer on the smooth outer wall is dominated by the flow impingement. When ribs are fitted onto the outer wall, it is found that the heat transfer patterns are significantly altered. The presence of ribs augments the heat transfer at the penalty of increased pressure loss. Thermal performance is considered to provide optimized rib configurations. By proper application of guide vanes, the pressure loss over the turn region is substantially reduced while the heat transfer is only moderately changed. The combined effect of guide vanes and ribs on the heat transfer is also analyzed. The results can be used to optimize the internal cooling design for gas turbine blade tips. <b>Jet</b> <b>impingement</b> is an effective heat transfer method while the favorable performance is usually degraded by the cross-flow. Experimental measurements were conducted to study the effects of vortex generator pair (VGP) on the <b>jet</b> <b>impingement</b> <b>heat</b> {{transfer in}} cross-flow. The VGP is placed in the cross-flow channel and upstream of the jet exit. The jet Reynolds number is 15, 000 and the cross-flow Reynolds numbers vary from 40, 000 to 64, 000. Results indicate that the VGP with common-flow-up (CFU) configuration promotes the jet penetration in cross-flow and augments the <b>impingement</b> <b>heat</b> transfer greatly on the target wall compared to the baseline case without the VGP. In addition, the parameters affecting the enhancement include the angle of attack of the VGP, the spacing between the VGP, the spacing between the VGP and the jet nozzle, the shape of the VGP, the height of the VGP, and also the cross-flow Reynolds number...|$|R
