40|$|International audienceCross-docking is a {{relatively}} new logistic strategy which seeks to make economies in transportation, decrease lead time and reduce inventory. The main principle is to unload, sort, consolidate and transfer delivered packages from inbound trucks to outbound trucks, with a minimum of storage or treatment in between. Two key issues associated to this field are the truck scheduling and the shop-floor operation scheduling. We propose a mixed integer linear programming model to schedule truck arrivals, shop-floor activities and truck departures. The cross-dock configuration we study is based on an industrial case on the automotive industry. In particular, a repack operation and two temporary storage zones are considered. The objective is to minimize <b>internal</b> operation <b>cost</b> (penalty related to extra capacity needs) and outbound transportation cost (number of trucks). The model is implemented and tested in CPLEX with small size instances, based on industrial data. The proposed model could be easily adapted to a variety of cross-dock configurations, in terms of <b>internal</b> capacity and <b>cost</b> <b>distribution...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Nowadays, the {{changing}} demand patters by the customers are increasing {{the pressure on}} the manufacturers. In this situation, manufacturers to sustain in the market are forced to do the activities like (i) Increase the selling price of their product and (ii) Reduce their <b>internal</b> <b>costs</b> of their product. In this scenario, {{it is not possible to}} increase the selling price of the products. The only way is to reduce their <b>internal</b> <b>costs</b> and improve the quality of the products to survive in their field. This paper suggests a methodology to develop and implement software based mechatronics systems in their factory premises for taking necessary steps to reduce the experimental <b>cost,</b> <b>internal</b> <b>cost</b> and improve the efficiency of the organization. The software based mechatronics approach is used to predict and analyze the relevant data pertaining to the selected problems.

If the production <b>cost</b> <b>distribution</b> is globally convex, an agglomerated equilibrium exists at an intermediary point between the locations minimizing production cost and transport cost, respectively.

40|$|Abstract: Extensive {{studies of}} fusion {{economics}} {{have been performed}} {{in the last decade}} within the European Union and the United States. Over the same period major advances {{have been made in the}} physics and technology of fusion. This paper summarizes the prospects for fusion making an economically attractive contribution to the future energy mix. With modest physics optimization and anticipated near-term materials, the <b>internal</b> <b>costs</b> of fusion electricity would be about fifty percent more expensive than electricity from fossil fuels (not counting the costs of pollution abatement) and roughly comparable to renewables. Unlike renewables, fusion provides firm power. The use of advanced materials, technology and physics leads to an <b>internal</b> <b>cost</b> of fusion electricity approaching the <b>internal</b> <b>cost</b> from fission or fossil. Fusion has small external costs, along with wind, about an order of magnitude lower than fossil. Energy scenarios show that fusion could contribute significantly to large-scale electricity production during the second half of the century; the overall cost of fusion electricity is likely to be comparable with that from other environmentally responsible sources of electricity generation. ...|$|R

By monetizing <b>internal</b> <b>costs</b> independent of health benefits, we can assess the degree of internalization of private benefits and/or the internalization of external benefits such as environmental improvements due to altruistic preferences by cyclists. Our framework further conceptualizes the complementarity between 2 ̆ 01 chard 2 ̆ 01 d (investments in infrastructure) and 2 ̆ 01 csoft 2 ̆ 01 d measures (informational campaigns) in bicycle policy.

However, because data for some important bicycle mode choice determinants are not available, our results cannot inform policy directly at the current stage.
