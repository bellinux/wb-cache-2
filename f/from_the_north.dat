5|$|Most of the {{precipitation}} {{comes from}} frontal systems associated with cyclogenesis and strong southeasterly winds (Sudestada), which bring {{long periods of}} precipitation, cloudy weather and cooler temperatures. Winters are cloudy while relative humidity is very high, often 90% or higher, making the weather dull, grey and cool. Occasionally, warm air masses <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>north</b> bring warmer temperatures. These warm air masses can bring sunny weather, particularly during the afternoon when they come <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>north</b> or northwest {{as a result of}} a trough located in central Argentina. On the other hand, warm air masses from Brazil bring humid conditions, featuring high humidity with high cloud cover that is typical of a warm front of a frontal system and typical of tropical maritime air. These warm air masses that are responsible for the high humidity and cloud cover are the warmest air masses, leading to the warmest temperatures. Nonetheless, these are short lived as the Chaco Low, which is responsible for bringing in warm and tropical air <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>north</b> is weaker in winter due to lower insolation, leading to the winds <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>north</b> being less intense and shorter lived.|$|E
