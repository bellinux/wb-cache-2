5|$|The common {{ancestor}} of all present gnathostomes (jawed-vertebrates) lived in freshwater, and later migrated {{back to the}} sea. To deal with the much higher salinity in sea water, they evolved the ability to turn the nitrogen waste product ammonia into harmless urea, storing it in the body to give the blood the same osmolarity as the sea water without poisoning the organism. This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> currently found in cartilaginous fishes. Ray-finned fishes (Actinopterygii) later returned to freshwater and lost this ability, while the fleshy-finned fishes (Sarcopterygii) retained it. Since the blood of ray-finned fishes contains more salt than freshwater, they could simply get rid of ammonia through their gills. When they finally returned to the sea again, they did not recover their old trick of turning ammonia to urea, {{and they had to}} evolve salt excreting glands instead. Lungfishes do the same when they are living in water, making ammonia and no urea, but when the water dries up and they are forced to burrow down in the mud, they switch to urea production. Like cartilaginous fishes, the coelacanth can store urea in its blood, as can the only known amphibians that can live {{for long periods of time}} in salt water (the toad Bufo marinus and the frog Rana cancrivora). These are traits they have inherited from their ancestors.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We define five {{increasingly}} comprehensive {{classes of}} infinite-state systems, called STS 1 – 5, whose state spaces have finitary structure. For {{four of these}} classes, we provide examples from hybrid systems. STS 1 These <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>systems</b> with finite bisimilarity quotients. They can be analyzed symbolically by (1) iterating the predecessor and boolean operations starting from a finite set of observable state sets, and (2) terminating when no new state sets are generated. This enables model checking of the µ-calculus. STS 2 These <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>systems</b> with finite similarity quotients. They can be analyzed symbolically by iterating the predecessor and positive boolean operations. This enables model checking of the existential and universal fragments of the µ-calculus. STS 3 These <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>systems</b> with finite trace-equivalence quotients. They can be analyzed symbolically by iterating the predecessor operation and a restricted form of positive boolean operations (intersection is restricted to intersection with observables). This enables model checking of linear temporal logic. STS 4 These <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>systems</b> with finite distance-equivalence quotients (two states are equivalent if for every distance d, the same observables can be reached in d transitions). <b>The</b> <b>systems</b> in this class can be analyzed symbolically by iterating the predecessor operation and terminating when no new state sets are generated.
