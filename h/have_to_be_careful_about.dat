It was so [...] "...just because of {{the sheer number of}} parts that needed to be made. We wanted to retain as much of that squashy-stretchy goofiness as possible, so he had dozens of replacement parts, like arms, noses, even various sizes of cheeks and freckles. Of course, as the main character, you really want to make sure he will charm the audience, which brings a special kind of pressure." [...] Walsh said, [...] "The {{most important thing is to}} capture the spirit of the character, not necessarily a literal copy of the 2D. Puppets have their own kind of energy and you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>about</b> what to include and what to leave out." [...] On the other hand, Patchy the Pirate became the easiest character to make [...] "because he has the most humanoid proportions." ...|$|E
500|$|McCain {{played an}} {{important}} part in the expansion of U.S. involvement in Cambodia. [...] In April 1970, McCain gave personal briefings to Nixon in Honolulu, and to Nixon and National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger in San Clemente, where he highlighted the threat from North Vietnamese operations in Cambodia and Laos. [...] In particular, he said that Lon Nol's government in Cambodia would soon collapse unless North Vietnamese operations there were stopped, and that with a secure base there, North Vietnam could then launch attacks on South Vietnam which would cause the failure of Vietnamization. [...] McCain additionally said that the schedule for the ongoing withdrawal of U.S. ground forces from Vietnam had to be flexible. [...] McCain's views, which had the support of his subordinate, MACV commander General Creighton Abrams, helped persuade Nixon {{to go ahead with the}} Cambodian Incursion later that month. [...] Kissinger would subsequently tell another admiral, [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>about</b> having McCain around the president too much, because he fires up the president." ...|$|E

60|$|We set out at {{a gentle}} trot. Veronica, {{who had been in}} trouble most of the morning, sat stiffly on the extreme edge of her seat, clothed in the {{attitude}} of one dead to the world; Dick, in lavender gloves that Robina had thoughtfully bought for him, next to her. Ethelbertha, Robina, and myself sat perched on the back seat; to have leaned back would have been to lie down. Ethelbertha, having made up her mind she was going to dislike the whole family of the St. Leonards, seemed disinclined for conversation. Myself I had forgotten my cigar-case. I have tried the St. Leonard cigar. He does not smoke himself; but keeps a box for his friends. He tells me he fancies men are smoking cigars less than formerly. I did not see how I was going to get a smoke for the next three hours. Nothing annoys me more than being bustled and made to forget things. Robina, who has recently changed her views on the subject of freckles, shared a parasol with her mother. They had to hold it almost horizontally in front of them, and this obscured their view. I could not myself understand why people smiled as we went by. Apart from the carriage, which they must have seen before, we were not, I should have said, an exhilarating spectacle. A party of cyclists laughed outright. Robina said there was one thing we should <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>about,</b> living in the country, and that was that the strong air and the loneliness combined didn't sap our intellect. She said she had noticed it--the tendency of country people to become prematurely silly. I did not share her fears, as I had by this time divined what it was that was amusing folks. Dick had discovered behind the cushions--remnant of some recent wedding, one supposes--a large and tastefully bound Book of Common Prayer. He and Veronica sat holding it between them. Looking at their faces one could almost hear the organ pealing.|$|E

50|$|Wang’s {{views on}} {{literature}} ties in {{well in the}} principles in journalism. While literature commenting allows his audience to have a knowledge of what is currently happening in the world, reporters are also doing the same thing: making readers be aware of current affairs. Speaking about journalism, he said that we, as readers, <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>about</b> different reporters’ stances and their different perspectives based on various sources.

5000|$|Heated {{clothing}} {{designed for}} use on vehicles such as motorbikes or snowmobiling typically use a 12 volt electric current which is the standard voltage on motorsport and powersport batteries. While a single heated garment, such as heated gloves, will not usually adversely affect the charge on the battery, riders <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>about</b> attaching several heated garments because the battery {{may not be able}} to handle the load. The heated garments are usually attached directly onto the battery of the bike. Some heated garments have cigarette lighter plugs so that the clothing can be plugged into a car's cigarette lighter. While the least expensive models can only be turned on or off, the more expensive models sometimes provide a heating level control.|$|E
5000|$|The National Commission on Social Security Reform, {{also known}} as the Greenspan Commission due to its {{chairmanship}} by Alan Greenspan, was a commission that was appointed by the United States Congress and President Ronald Reagan in 1981 to study and make recommendations regarding the short-term financing crisis that Social Security faced at that time. Its 1983 report led to the Social Security Reform Act of 1983. Greenspan himself was critical of this act, stating, [...] "Do I like the present Social Security system? No. If you asked me whether it would be necessary in the ideal society, I'd say no.

50|$|Hay baled {{before it}} is fully dry can produce enough heat to start a fire. Haystacks produce {{internal}} heat due to bacterial fermentation. If hay is stacked with wet grass, the heat produced can be sufficient to ignite the hay causing a fire. Farmers <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>about</b> moisture levels to avoid spontaneous combustion, which is {{a leading cause of}} haystack fires. Heat is produced by the respiration process, which occurs until the moisture content of drying hay drops below 40%. Hay is considered fully dry when it reaches 20% moisture. Combustion problems typically occur within five days to seven days of baling. A bale cooler than 120 F is in little danger, but bales between 120 and 140 F need to be removed from a barn or structure and separated so that they can cool off. If the temperature of a bale exceeds more than 140 F, it can combust.|$|E

[...] In 2012, New and playwright Freddie Machin adapted Machin's play Chicken for the cinema.

New was cast alongside actor Scott Chambers and actress Yasmin Paige in the drama, which focuses on two brothers squatting on a piece of land who come into conflict with the new landowner.
