5|$|Another way to view {{surface tension}} <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> energy. A {{molecule}} {{in contact with}} a neighbor is in a lower state of energy than if it were alone (not in contact with a neighbor). The interior molecules have as many neighbors as they can possibly have, but the boundary molecules are missing neighbors (compared to interior molecules) and therefore have a higher energy. For the liquid to minimize its energy state, the number of higher energy boundary molecules must be minimized. The minimized number of boundary molecules results in a minimal surface area.|$|E

In those seasons, four coaches have led the Cyclones to postseason bowl games: Johnny Majors, Earle Bruce, Dan McCarney, and Paul Rhoads. One coach, Clyde Williams, has won a conference {{championship}} with the Cyclones. McCarney is the all-time leader in games coached (141), years coached (11) and wins (56), while Bert German is the all-time leader in winning percentage (.833). W. P.

5|$|The {{presence}} and {{diseases of the}} thyroid have been noted and treated for thousands of years, although the gland itself has only been described and named since the renaissance. The first recorded mention of the thyroid <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> goitre in Chinese texts circa 2700 BCE, of which there is general agreement. In 1600 BCE burnt sponge and seaweed were used within China {{for the treatment of}} goitres, a practice which has developed {{in many parts of the}} world. In Ayurvedic medicine, the book Sushruta Samhita written about 1400 BCE describes hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism and goitre. Aristotle and Xenophon in the fifth century BCE describe cases of Grave's disease, which receives its name over two millennia later owing to descriptions provided by Robert James Graves in 1834, Hippocrates and Plato in the fourth century BCE provided some of the first descriptions of the gland itself, proposing its function as a salivary gland. Pliny the Elder in the first century BCE referred to epidemics of goitre in the Alps and proposed treatment with burnt seaweed, a practice also referred to by Galen in the second century, referred to burnt sponge for the treatment of goitre.|$|E

25|$|According to Louis Massignon {{there are}} many {{different}} attitudes among Shiites and Sunnis about the Mubahalah.

According to Shia sources not only Mubahala happened with the presence of Fatima but also Fatima considered as someone who is standing back of prophet. In other words, some mystical sects refer to the symbolic role during that event. They try to interpret her as an image. This image shows a lighting matter.

25|$|Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) is {{a species}} of krill found in the Antarctic waters of the Southern Ocean. It is a small, {{swimming}} crustacean that lives in large schools, called swarms, sometimes reaching densities of 10,000–30,000 individual animals per cubic metre. It feeds directly on minute phytoplankton, thereby using the primary production energy that the phytoplankton originally derived from the sun in order to sustain their pelagic (open ocean) life cycle. It grows to a length of , weighs up to , and can live {{for up to six}} years.

25|$|Injective modules {{have been}} heavily studied, {{and a variety}} of {{additional}} notions are defined in terms of them: Injective cogenerators are injective modules that faithfully represent the entire category of modules. Injective resolutions measure how far from injective a module <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> the injective dimension and represent modules in the derived category. Injective hulls are maximal essential extensions, and turn out to be minimal injective extensions. Over a Noetherian ring, every injective module is uniquely a direct sum of indecomposable modules, and their structure is well understood. An injective module over one ring, may not be injective over another, but there are well-understood methods of changing rings which handle special cases. Rings which are themselves injective modules have a number of interesting properties and include rings such as group rings of finite groups over fields. Injective modules include divisible groups and are generalized by the notion of injective objects in category theory.|$|E
25|$|Until 2015, {{the system}} used three {{diesel-powered}} Bombardier Transportation Talent BR643 low-floor {{diesel multiple unit}} trains.

OC Transpo operates it under the official name ‘Capital Railway’, which appears on the trains along with their regular logo. It was, however, described as ‘light rail’, partly because plans called {{for it to be}} extended into Ottawa’s downtown as a tramway-like service, and partly because the Talents, though designed for mainline railways in Europe, are much smaller and lighter than most mainline trains in North America, and do not meet the Association of American Railroads' standards for crash strength. Ottawa is also authorized to run trains with only a single operator and no other crew, something rare on mainline railways in North America.|$|E

25|$|Another {{beneficial}} {{factor in}} cryoconservation of indigenous livestock <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> food security and economic development. Indigenous livestock often have beneficial traits related to adaptation to local climate and diseases {{that can be}} incorporated into major breeds through cryoconservation practices. Cryoconservation is a favorable strategy because it allows germplasms to be stored for extended periods of time in a small confined area. An additional benefit of cryoconservation is the ability to preserve the biological material of both maternal and paternal cells and maintain viability over extended periods of time. Cryoconservation has been successfully used as a conservation strategy for species and breeds that have since been endangered. One drawback is that cryoconservation can only be done if preparation has taken place in advance. With proper preparation of collecting and maintaining genetic material, this method is very beneficial for the conservation of rare and endangered livestock. Cryoconservation can serve as a contingency plan when a breed population needs to be restored or when a breed has become extinct, as well as for breed improvement. This process benefits companies and researchers by making genetic materials available.|$|E
