40|$|The Ramsey-Romer {{model of}} {{endogenous}} growth is extended {{to allow for}} holdings of real money balances and government debt as well as capital and for non-interconnected generations of households. Tax-financed <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> government consumption and debt depress growth prospects and boost inflation, {{as long as a}} positive birth rate ensures that future taxes are shouldered by future, yet unborn, generations. Debt-financed <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> government consumption depress growth and boost inflation even more. Money-financed <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> government consumption depress growth less but increase inflation by more. Giving subsidies through an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> monetary growth is non-neutral, since this increases real growth and thus inflation increases by a lesser amount than monetary growth. Bond-financed <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> monetary growth lead to a larger <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> real growth and a smaller <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> inflation.
