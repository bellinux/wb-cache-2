50|$|The {{lane keeping}} assist system are being {{achieved}} in modern <b>driverless</b> <b>vehicle</b> systems using image processing techniques called hough transform and canny edge detection techniques.

Real-time image processing using powerful computers like Nvidia's Drive PX1 are being used by many Vehicle OEMs to achieve fully autonomous vehicles in which Lane detection algorithm plays a key part. Advanced lane detection algorithms are also being developed using deep learning and neural network techniques. Nvidia has achieved high accuracy in developing self-driving features including lane keeping using the neural network based training mechanism in which they use a front facing camera in a car and run it through a route and then uses the steering input and camera images of the road fed into the neural network and make it 'learn'. The neural network then will be able to change the steering angle based on the lane change on the road and keep the car in the middle of the lane.|$|E

By using information-theoretic verification frameworks, coupled with emerging quantum-based location-verification procedures, I show how vehicle positions can be authenticated with a probability of error simply not attainable in classical-only networks. I also discuss how other quantum applications can be seamlessly encapsulated within the same vehicular communication infrastructure required for location verification. The two technology enablers required for the driverless quantum vehicle are an increase in current quantum memory timescales (likely) and wide-scale deployment of classical vehicular communication infrastructure (underway). I argue the enhanced safety features delivered by the `Quantum Car' mean its eventual deployment is inevitable. Comment: 4 pages, 1 figur...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{the context}} of Intelligent Transportation Systems based on <b>driverless</b> <b>vehicles,</b> one {{important}} issue is the passing of a crossroads. This paper presents a supervised reservation system. Extending previous works in this direction, the proposed algorithm determines trajectories and speeds for all the vehicles willing to pass the intersection. The work is separated into tasks shared between the vehicles and an infrastructure {{in charge of the}} crossroads. This paper describes the characteristics of the algorithm, as well as considerations which led to it. Simulation results are given and support the argument that this algorithm is probably suboptimal but still performs well. Finally, this work shows there is place for ameliorations and hints to further improve the algorithm are given.

40|$|In the not-too-distant future, {{your car}} could drive itself; {{technology}} companies and automobile manufacturers alike are currently developing <b>driverless</b> <b>vehicle</b> technology. While {{there are many}} touted benefits to driverless vehicles, {{perhaps the most important}} societal benefit is a reduction in automobile accidents. Currently, car crashes are one of the leading causes of death in the United States, and the majority of accidents are caused by human error. Unlike humans, driverless vehicles will not get distracted, significantly decreasing the number of car crash fatalities that happen each year. In order for driverless vehicles to save lives, driverless vehicles must be on the roads. This means people must be willing and able to buy them. Millennials have demonstrated interest in the technology, keeping in line with their reputation for being early technology adopters, but unfortunately this demographic has limited buying power - a problem when early driverless vehicles could command a premium of up to $ 10, 000. To bridge the gap between desire and accessibility, the government should enact a <b>driverless</b> <b>vehicle</b> subsidy program. The United States government has, in recent years, implemented two different programs to subsidy individuals’ vehicle purchases - The Energy Improvement and Extension Act and the CARS program. Both programs successfully influenced buyer behavior for vehicle purchases, but the CARS program, which offered consumers a rebate at the time they bought their car, was particularly well-received. This note proposes a government subsidy for driverless vehicles closely mirrored after the Cash for Clunkers program. By offering a rebate to the consumer at the time of sale, individuals will be better able to afford driverless vehicles, thereby accelerating the overall adoption of this potentially life-saving technology...|$|E

40|$|What {{happens when}} you slow down part of an ultrafast network that is {{operating}} quicker than {{the blink of an}} eye, e. g. electronic exchange network, navigational systems in driverless vehicles, or even neuronal processes in the brain? This question just adopted immediate commercial, legal and political importance following U.

Though similar requests are set to follow, there is still no scientific understanding available to policymakers of the likely system-wide impact of such delays. Giving academic researchers access to (so far prohibitively expensive) microsecond exchange data would help rectify this situation.

40|$|This paper {{represents}} {{a synthesis of}} existing empirical acceptance studies on automated driving and scientific literature on technology acceptance. The objective {{of this paper is}} to study user acceptance of driverless vehicles that fall into SAE level 4, as they operate within the constraints of dedicated infrastructure. The review indicates that previous acceptance studies on automated driving are skewed towards car users, creating a need for targeted acceptance studies, including users of public transport. For obvious reasons previous studies targeted respondents who had not experienced driverless vehicles. As <b>driverless</b> <b>vehicle</b> are currently being demonstrated in pilot projects, we can now start to investigate their acceptance by users inside and outside of such vehicles. Addressing the multidimensional nature of acceptance, we develop a conceptual model that integrates a holistic and comprehensive set of variables to explain, predict and improve user acceptance of driverless vehicles. It links two dominant models from the technology acceptance management literature, the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Technology Use (UTAUT) and the Pleasure-Arousal-Dominance-Framework (PAD), with a number of external variables that are divided into system-specific, user and contextual characteristics.
