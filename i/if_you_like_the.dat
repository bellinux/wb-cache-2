500|$|Amy Taubin of Film Comment {{described}} The Hurt Locker as [...] "a structuralist war movie" [...] and [...] "a totally immersive, off-the-charts high-anxiety {{experience from}} beginning to end." [...] Taubin praised Ackroyd's [...] "brilliant" [...] cinematography with multiple viewpoints. She said of the film's editing, [...] "Bob Murawski and Chris Innis's editing is similarly quick and nervous; the rapid changes in POV as they cut from one camera's coverage to another's makes you feel as <b>if</b> <b>you,</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> characters, are under threat from all sides." ...|$|E
500|$|Nicole James from MTV News {{opined that}} the video gave another {{impression}} that although [...] "Madonna's {{never been the}} cute and innocent homecoming queen, but those wholesome, all-American football players still wanna kick it with her." [...] Cragg from The Guardian declared the video as a [...] "hoot" [...] with the [...] "creepy cheerleaders and Madonna breastfeeding a doll". Bradley Stern from MuuMuse found similarities in the video with those of singer Björk's video for [...] "It's Oh So Quiet" [...] (1995) and Kylie Minogue's [...] "Come into My World" [...] (2002) with the [...] "walk-talk and walk-crawl" [...] formula in it. He added that the video is [...] "self-aware, thoroughly modern, cheeky, sarcastic, glamorous and entirely camp {{all at the same}} time". Chris Wilman from TheWrap noted similarities to Madonna's own [...] "Material Girl" [...] (1985) video with the scenes showing her being carried off by the footballers, adding that [...] "everything here is as dumb as the titular spelling, but the campiness has its charm, at least <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> old musicals that some of the tracking shots here are paying homage to." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Give Me All Your Luvin" [...] {{met with}} {{generally}} mixed reviews from music crtitcs. Priya Elan from NME said the song [...] "seems to soar effortlessly" [...] and that [...] "what Madonna's {{doing in this}} song {{is so much more}} impossibly fun than we could have imagined." [...] She also stated the song was a progress from the sound of her previous album, Hard Candy. Jim Farber from the New York Daily News considered that the song is [...] "a pure snap of bubble gum, closer to an early single like 'Burning Up' than any of her more recent club hits. Only the rap cameos from the quite camp Nicki Minaj, and the less so M.I.A., tell us what decade we're in." [...] Michael Cragg from The Guardian felt that the track was not bad. [...] "Musically it's a pretty joyful four minutes, featuring bouncing beats, acoustic riffs and Gwen Stefani-style cheerleader chants, but there's something a bit flat about Madonna's delivery. Given all the love she's demanding, you'd think she'd be more excited." [...] Speaking of the rap part, he thought that [...] "Minaj certainly does her best, her typically frantic rap an exercise in squeezing as many words into a 10-second space as possible, while MIA's more laconic drawl loses momentum." [...] Chris Willman of Reuters called it [...] "risible" [...] and infectious: [...] "Everything here is as dumb as the titular spelling, but the campiness has its charm, at least <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> old musicals that some of the tracking shots here are paying homage to". MTV News journalist Bradley Stern wrote about the [...] "Hey Mickey" [...] comparisons, complimenting the guest rapping of Minaj and M.I.A. even though he felt it was [...] "one of the album’s least compelling moments". In a review of MDNA, Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph felt that the prime purpose of the [...] "lightest, frothiest track" [...] from the album was to represent next generation's female pop stars. Emily Mackay of The Quietus wrote in detail about the song: ...|$|E

500|$|In a video filmed by singer John Legend, US President Barack Obama appears {{with his}} wife Michelle {{performing}} part of the [...] "Single Ladies" [...] routine. He also briefly performed the hand-twirl move from the song's video at the Obama Inaugural Celebration. This video prompted an Obama look-alike, Iman Crosson, to do {{his own version of}} the [...] "Single Ladies" [...] choreography. Several other well-known personalities, including American environmentalist and politician Joe Nation and American actor Tom Hanks, have performed the dance. In the music video for [...] "Dancin on Me" [...] by DJ Webstar and Jim Jones, three females are featured in the background, imitating the [...] "Single Ladies" [...] dance. Wearing a black leotard and gold glove, Katy Brand performed the choreography with two backup female dancers for the final of BBC One's Let's Dance for Comic Relief {{to raise money for the}} charity Comic Relief on March 12, 2010. Jenna Ushkowitz, Chris Colfer and Heather Morris did the [...] "Single Ladies" [...] dance as part of the Glee Live tour in June 2011. The music minister at Geyer Springs First Baptist Church in Little Rock, Arkansas, thought it would be [...] "an excellent idea" [...] to attract interest in the church choir by using a remix of [...] "Single Ladies" [...] and having choir members dance to it. In the music video he made, the choir members sing, [...] "All the singing ladies, all the singing fellas... <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> choir, then won't you come and sing in it." [...] Cyndi Wilkerson, Music Ministry Assistant at Geyer Springs First Baptist Church, uploaded the video to YouTube on August29,2011. In April 2013, YouTube phenomenon Psy did the dance routine during a concert in Seoul while wearing a red leotard and red boots. A television advert for the South African cellular service Vodacom, used the song as a backdrop to an actor who was humorously mimicking Beyoncé's dancing, the advert quickly went viral and spawed several different variations.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{means for}} the spread of {{innovation}} was by the network of informal philosophical societies, like the Lunar Society of Birmingham, in which members met to discuss 'natural philosophy' (i.e. science) and often its application to manufacturing. The Lunar Society flourished from 1765 to 1809, {{and it has been}} said of them, [...] "They were, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>like,</b> <b>the</b> revolutionary committee of that most far reaching of all the eighteenth century revolutions, the Industrial Revolution". Other such societies published volumes of proceedings and transactions. For example, the London-based Royal Society of Arts published an illustrated volume of new inventions, as well as papers about them in its annual Transactions.|$|E
2500|$|The {{paper had}} a big {{circulation}} and began to exercise a great influence on the masses of the people. In Mitchel's Letters to [...] "The Protestant Farmers, Labourers and Artisans of the North of Ireland", Mitchel maintained that England did not care about any religion and plundered Protestants as well as Catholics. [...] "The Pope," [...] he wrote, [...] "we know is the 'Man of Sin', and the 'Antichrist', and also, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>like,</b> <b>the</b> 'Mystery of Iniquity', and all that; but he brings no ejectments in Ireland. The Seven Sacraments are, to be sure, very dangerous, but the quarter-acre clause touches you more nearly. In short, our vicious system of Government, and especially the infamous land laws, are the machinery that brought you to this pass." ...|$|E

2500|$|Marcus Miller {{produced}} the original {{score for the}} film, while Antonio [...] "L. A." [...] Reid and Kenneth [...] "Babyface" [...] Edmonds worked on the soundtrack. With such a wealth of new material, director Hudlin said, [...] "sometimes we used score, sometimes we'd use a song by L.A. and Face, or sometimes Marcus would {{take some of the}} songs they had written and do score interpolations of it. For example, one of the songs, [...] "Love Shoulda Brought You Home", is a great example. That came from a line of dialogue where Halle is furious with Eddie, says 'love should've brought your ass home last night,' slaps him. At that time, L.A. leans over to me and goes 'that's a great song title.' I said, 'great idea.' They write a song, [...] "Love Shoulda Brought You Home". I said, 'well, who we going to get to sing it?' And they said 'well you know, we've got this great young singer who sang the demo, Reggie. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> demo then we can use her.' And I said 'great, let's use her.' So that was Toni Braxton's debut. And I remember when I finally met Toni at Babyface's wedding, L.A. said, 'you owe your career to this guy, he gave you your big break,' which was really sweet." ...|$|E
2500|$|On December 19, the Pickering–Mullen Accountability Review Board {{report on}} the Benghazi matter was released. It was sharply {{critical}} of State Department officials in Washington for ignoring requests for more guards and safety upgrades, and for failing to adapt security procedures to a deteriorating security environment. It explicitly criticized the Bureau of Diplomatic Security and the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs: [...] "Systemic failures and leadership and management deficiencies at senior levels within two bureaus of the State Department ... resulted in a special mission security posture that was inadequate for Benghazi and grossly inadequate {{to deal with the}} attack that took place." [...] Four State Department officials were removed from their posts as a consequence, including Assistant Secretary of State for Diplomatic Security Eric J. Boswell (who resigned completely), a deputy assistant secretary for embassy security, Charlene R. Lamb, and a deputy assistant secretary for North Africa, Raymond Maxwell. The report did not criticize more senior officials in the department; Pickering said: [...] "We fixed it at the assistant secretary level, which is, in our view, the appropriate place to look, where the decision-making in fact takes place, where, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>like,</b> <b>the</b> rubber hits the road." [...] Clinton said in a letter to Congress that she accepted the conclusions of the Pickering–Mullen report, and a State Department task force was formed to implement some sixty action items recommended by the report. On December 20, the Deputy Secretary of State, William J. Burns, and the Deputy Secretary of State for Management and Resources, Thomas R. Nides, testified in her place before two Congressional committees, and said that many of the report's recommendations would be in place before year-end. Clinton planned to testify herself in January.|$|E
