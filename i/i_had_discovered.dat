5|$|I {{should say}} I {{wanted to write}} poetry in the {{beginning}} because I {{had fallen in love}} with words. The first poems I knew were nursery rhymes and before I could read them for myself I had come to love the words of them. The words alone. What the words stood for was of a very secondary importance... I fell in love, that is the only expression I can think of, at once, and am still at the mercy of words, though sometimes now, knowing a little of their behaviour very well, I think I can influence them slightly and have even learned to beat them now and then, which they appear to enjoy. I tumbled for words at once. And, when I began to read the nursery rhymes for myself, and, later, to read other verses and ballads, I knew that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>discovered</b> the most important things, to me, that could be ever.|$|E
500|$|Guitar {{was viewed}} by Sharrock as the {{culmination}} of a period in his career spent developing his sense of composition. After releasing his first record—Black Woman—in 1969, he experimented with different influences during the 1970s. When he recorded [...] "Dance with Me Montana" [...] in 1982, the song's chord progression changed his perspective on composing and inspired him to pursue more melodic ideas. [...] "You listen to , and it's like a blind man struggling {{to get out of a}} room", Sharrock recalled. [...] "Guitar was a crystallization of all of the things that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>discovered</b> in that song." [...] In the early 1980s, he had also worked on projects with Material, an experimental band fronted by Bill Laswell, who helped Sharrock produce the album.|$|E
2500|$|The {{review was}} devastating, and I wasn't clever enough to {{understand}} or use the possible notoriety attached to that performance (after all, obviously no one was bored) in a positive career move. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>discovered</b> that publicly performing my own work placed me in an exceedingly vulnerable position emotionally and physically, and I wanted none of it. I believe now that I was basically uncommitted to my work and unable to take responsibility publicly for my decisions. [...] I had worked mainly for the positive response of my peers and of an audience, not gearing my work towards that response but expecting it as the dividends of having worked. [...] When the audience and my peers turned on me, I picked up my marbles and went home. [...] I just decided to stop making work.|$|E
