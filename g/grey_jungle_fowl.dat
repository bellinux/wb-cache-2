40|$|A {{new family}} of related {{endogenous}} proviruses, existing at 50 to 100 copies per haploid genome and distinguishable by remarkably short long terminal repeats, {{has been described}} for domestic chickens (Gallus gallus subsp domesticus). In this communication, by using Southern blot analysis and probes derived from both internal viral sequences and locus-specific, cellular flanking sequences, we studied the genetic distribution of this family of moderately repetitive avian endogenous retroviruses within the genomes of four Gallus species. Eight inbred lines of domestic chickens, the evolutionary progenitor to the domestic chicken (red <b>jungle</b> <b>fowl),</b> and two more distantly related species (<b>grey</b> and green <b>jungle</b> <b>fowl)</b> were studied. All Gallus species harbored this class of elements, although the different lines of domestic chickens and different species of <b>jungle</b> <b>fowl</b> bore distinguishable complements of the proviral loci. <b>Jungle</b> <b>fowl</b> appeared to have fewer copies than domestic chickens. For three randomly isolated proviral loci, domestic chickens (G. gallus subsp. domesticus) and red <b>jungle</b> <b>fowl</b> (G. gallus subsp. gallus) showed only a proviral state, whereas the most primitive and divergent of the <b>jungle</b> <b>fowl,</b> the green <b>jungle</b> <b>fowl</b> (G. varius), consistently demonstrated only preintegration states or disparate alleles. The presence of this family in all Gallus species and of related sequences in other genera suggests that a primordial founding integration event occurred prior to the evolutionary separation of Gallus species and possibly related genera. Additionally, at least one proviral locus has been acquired subsequent to speciation, indicating that this family was actively infectious after the primary founding event. This conserved, repetitive proviral family appears to represent the vestigial remnant of an avian retrovirus class related to and evolutionarily more ancient than the Rous-associated virus- 0 family of avian endogenous retroviruses...|$|R
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of insertion and/or deletion (indels) polymorphisms as genetic markers was evaluated by genotyping 102 indels loci in native chicken populations from Myanmar and Indonesia {{as well as}} Red <b>jungle</b> <b>fowls</b> and Green <b>jungle</b> <b>fowls</b> from Java Island. Out of the 102 indel markers, 97 were polymorphic. The average observed and expected heterozygosities were 0. 206 to 0. 268 and 0. 229 to 0. 284 in native chicken populations and 0. 003 to 0. 101 and 0. 012 to 0. 078 in <b>jungle</b> <b>fowl</b> populations. The coefficients of genetic differentiation (Gst) of the native chicken populations from Myanmar and Indonesia were 0. 041 and 0. 098 respectively. The genetic variability is higher among native chicken populations than <b>jungle</b> <b>fowl</b> populations. The high Gst value was found between native chicken populations and <b>jungle</b> <b>fowl</b> populations.

40|$|A {{detailed}} {{survey was conducted}} from October 2010 to March 2011, to estimate the population density and group size of the Grey Junglefowl Gallus sonneratti in the Melghat Tiger Reserve. The survey was conducted in three forest ranges: Dhargad, Dhakna and Chikhaldara which come under the Gugamal Forest Division in the Melghat Tiger Reserve, Maharashtra. Population density was estimated by the line transect method using distance sampling. A total of 34 transects were walked {{in the study area}} each having 5 temporal replicates, which yielded 36 sightings, comprising 114 individuals of <b>Grey</b> <b>jungle</b> <b>fowl</b> in the entire period of study. An overall density of Grey Junglefowl was found to be 16. 72 plus or minus 4. 70 Birds/km 2 (n= 36), whereas the average cluster size was 2. 95 Birds (n= 36), average group density 5. 68 plus or minus 1. 49 (n= 36).

40|$|HPRS- 103, the {{prototype}} of avian leukosis virus (ALV) subgroup J, is a recently identified retrovirus associated with myeloid leukosis in meat-type chickens. Although this virus shows high sequence identity to other ALV subgroups within the gag and pol genes, its env gene is highly diverged (with only about 40 % sequence identity) from other ALV subgroups. On the other hand, the sequence of the env gene of HPRS- 103 was 75 % identical to that of E 51, {{a member of the}} EAV family of endogenous avian retroviruses. It is reported here that the chicken genome also contains another EAV-related element, EAV-HP, showing much greater sequence identity (over 97 %) to the HPRS- 103 env gene. Southern blotting analysis showed that EAV-HP-related sequences were distinct from EAV- 0 and were present in all lines of chicken examined and in <b>grey</b> <b>jungle</b> <b>fowl,</b> but were absent from several other avian species. The potential role of these endogenous sequences in the evolution of ALV subgroup J viruses is discussed...|$|E
40|$|A major {{challenge}} in the post-genomic era is to understand how genome sequence variants (genotype) give rise to the enormous diversity observed in terms of morphology, physiology and behavior (phenotype) among living organisms. Domestic animals—with their tremendous phenotypic variation—are excellent model organisms for determining the relationships between genotype and phenotype. In this thesis, I describe the utilization of the chicken, in combination with modern genetic and genomic approaches, in developing {{our understanding of the}} genetic mechanisms underlying phenotypic variation. These studies provide novel information on the genetics behind variation in carotenoid- and melanin-based pigmentation—observed in many organisms—and also cast light on the genetic basis of chicken domestication. In paper I, we report that the yellow skin phenotype—observed in most commercial chickens—is caused by one or several tissue-specific mutations altering the expression of beta-carotene oxygenase 2 (BCO 2 or BCDO 2) in skin. In addition, we present the first conclusive evidence of a hybrid origin of the domestic chicken, since the allele causing yellow skin most likely originates from the <b>grey</b> <b>jungle</b> <b>fowl</b> (Gallus sonneratii) and not from the previously described sole ancestor, the red jungle fowl (Gallus gallus). In paper II, we detect a number of loci that were likely important during the domestication process of chicken and the later specialization into meat (broiler) and egg (layer) producing lines. One of the major findings was that worldwide, almost all domestic chickens carry a missense mutation in TSHR (thyroid stimulating hormone receptor) in a position that is completely conserved amongst vertebrates. We speculate that this “domestication-mutation” has {{played an important role in}} the transformation of the wild red jungle fowl ancestor into the modern domestic chicken. In paper III, we demonstrate that the dilution of red (pheomelanin) pigmentation—observed in the plumage of the Inhibitor of Gold chicken—is caused by a frame-shift mutation in the catechol-O-methyltransferase domain containing 1 (COMTD 1) gene. The production and regulation of pheomelanin is poorly understood and this discovery advances our current knowledge of this pathway...|$|E

40|$|Chicken {{taxonomy}} and pedigree investigation {{are important}} parts {{to understand the}} domesticationprocess occurred on chicken in Indonesia. The Indonesian native chickens have very different clade with thechickens from other Asian countries and others. This {{study was conducted to}} construct phylogeny junglefowls (red and green <b>jungle</b> <b>fowls)</b> and Indonesian native chickens, in order to know their relationship. Among the available DNA marker, the region D-loop on DNA mitochondria is the most effective markerused in the investigation. Mitochondrial DNA D-loop (hypervariable- 1 segment) was PCR amplified andsubsequently sequenced for a total 33 individuals of green <b>jungle</b> <b>fowls</b> (Gallus varius), 9 individuals of redjungle fowls (Gallus g. gallus) from Indonesia, and 30 individuals of Indonesian native chickens (Lombok,Cemani, Kedu, Kedu Putih, Nunukan, Kate, Pelung, Gaok, Merawang, dan Sentul). Seventy two (72) sequences were used for analysis. Seven (7) published reference D-loop sequences of genus Gallus fromGenBank were also included in the analysis: Gallus varius (GenBank accession number D 64163 danD 82912), Gallus gallus (GenBank accession number AB 098668), G. gallus spadiceus (GenBank accessionnumber AB 007721), Gallus gallus bankiva (GenBank accession number AB 007718), Gallus lafayetti(GenBank accession number D 66893), and Gallus sonneratii (GenBank accession number D 66892).

40|$|Domestication {{has taken}} place over {{thousands}} of years {{and during that time}} we have bred animals on different traits. The red <b>jungle</b> <b>fowl</b> is the ancestor to all domesticated chicks, including the white leghorn which is used in egg production. The domestication of the red <b>jungle</b> <b>fowl</b> has resulted in behavioral changes between itself and domesticated breeds, such as white leghorn. In this study we examine how these two breeds handle stress {{and whether or not they}} use social support when coping and recovering from a stress experience. The study took place in a built arena with two stimuli animals on each side. There the animal was studied for 5 minutes, stressed for 3 minutes and studied again for 5 minutes. We found that the red <b>jungle</b> <b>fowl</b> males spent more time in the unfamiliar zone before stress than males of the white leghorn. Our results also showed that the females of white leghorn and red <b>jungle</b> <b>fowl</b> spent more time in the familiar zone than males after being stressed. This is an indication that they are more dependent on social support from familiar animals after stress than the males are. Aggressive behavior was also observed among the males. Red <b>jungle</b> <b>fowl</b> males acted aggressively towards the unfamiliar stimuli animals and the white leghorn towards the familiar stimuli animals. In conclusion, we found that the females where in greater need of social support than the males. Biolog...|$|R

40|$|In {{species with}} {{duplicated}} {{major histocompatibility complex}} (MHC) genes, estimates of genetic variation often rely on multilocus measures of diversity. It is possible that such measures might not always detect more detailed patterns of selection at individual loci. Here, we describe a method {{that allows us to}} investigate classical MHC diversity in red <b>jungle</b> <b>fowl</b> (Gallus gallus), the wild ancestor of the domestic chicken, using a single locus approach. This is possible due to the well-characterised gene organisation of the 'minimal essential' MHC (BF/BL region) of the domestic chicken, which comprises two differentially expressed duplicated class I (BF) and two class II B (BLB) genes. Using a combination of reference strand-mediated conformation analysis, cloning and sequencing, we identify nine BF and ten BLB alleles in a captive population of <b>jungle</b> <b>fowl.</b> We show that six BF and five BLB alleles are from the more highly expressed locus of each gene, BF 2 and BLB 2, respectively. An excess of non-synonymous substitutions across the <b>jungle</b> <b>fowl</b> BF/BL region suggests that diversifying selection has acted on this population. Importantly, single locus screening reveals that the strength of selection is greatest on the highly expressed BF 2 locus. This {{is the first time that}} a population of red <b>jungle</b> <b>fowl</b> has been typed at the MHC region, laying the basis for further research into the underlying processes acting to maintain MHC diversity in this and other species...|$|R
