5|$|Globular {{clusters}} normally {{consist of}} Population II stars, {{which have a}} low proportion of elements other than hydrogen and helium when compared to Population I stars such as the Sun. Astronomers refer to these heavier <b>elements</b> <b>as</b> metals and to the proportions of these <b>elements</b> <b>as</b> the metallicity. These elements are produced by stellar nucleosynthesis and then are recycled into the interstellar medium, where they enter {{the next generation of}} stars. Hence the proportion of metals can be an indication of the age of a star, with older stars typically having a lower metallicity.|$|E

This behavior may include many {{of the same}} <b>elements</b> <b>as</b> courtship, such as raising and spreading the first pair of legs and vibrating the abdomen.

5|$|At {{the end of}} the Second World War all the British Army, Royal Navy, Royal Air Force, {{and some}} Royal Marines Commandos were disbanded, leaving only three Royal Marines Commandos and one brigade (with {{supporting}} Army <b>elements).</b> <b>As</b> of 2010 the British Commando force is 3 Commando Brigade, which consists of both Royal Marines and British Army components, as well as commando-trained personnel from the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force. Other units of the British armed forces that can trace their origins to the British Commandos of the Second World War are the Parachute Regiment, the Special Air Service, and the Special Boat Service.|$|E
5|$|Castle Wolfenstein, {{originally}} {{available on}} the Apple II in 1981, also employed stealth <b>elements</b> <b>as</b> a focus of the gameplay. Players were charged with traversing the levels of Castle Wolfenstein, stealing secret plans and escaping. Players could acquire uniforms to disguise themselves and walk by guards undetected. Beyond Castle Wolfenstein, released in 1984, included some additions to its predecessor, such as a dagger for close-range kills and {{a greater emphasis on}} disguising in enemy uniform. id Software's technically updated 1992 remake Wolfenstein 3D was originally going to feature some of the original's stealth gameplay, such as body hiding, but this was cut to make the game faster paced. This Wolfenstein game would ironically pave the way for quite a few later 3D action games, specifically first-person shooters.|$|E

5|$|Colen Campbell was {{influenced}} by the Palladian style and has been credited with founding Georgian architecture. Architectural historian Howard Colvin has speculated that he was associated with James Smith and that Campbell may even have been his pupil. He spent most of his career in Italy and England and developed a rivalry with fellow Scot James Gibbs. Gibbs trained in Rome and also practised mainly in England. His architectural style did incorporate Palladian <b>elements,</b> <b>as</b> well as forms from Italian baroque and Inigo Jones, but was most strongly influenced by the interpretation of the Baroque by Sir Christopher Wren.|$|E
5|$|Defenders of Ardania is a tower defense {{game that}} also has {{offensive}} real-time strategy <b>elements.</b> <b>As</b> with all tower defense games, the player must defend their home base by building {{several types of}} static tower units that fire at weak offensive units spawned by the opponent. In Defenders of Ardania, however, players must also spawn soldiers themselves. Like the opponent's soldiers, the player's soldiers move along a fixed path towards their opponent's base and cannot be directly maneuvered by the player. The game is won if units spawned by the player get past the opponent's towers and destroy the opponent's base before the opponent's units get past the player's towers and destroy the player's base.|$|E
5|$|From the mid-20th century, {{the tunnel}} fell into disuse. It became popular with {{homeless}} people and drug users. A police report from around 1950 stated that squatters used the edifice for warmth and shelter from <b>elements,</b> <b>as</b> {{well as a}} hideout and a meeting place. The Yugoslav Government's lack of transparency regarding the tunnel led {{to the rise of}} a number of urban legends, including the purported existence of walled-off corridors leading towards the Croatian Parliament palace on St. Mark's Square (in the centre of Gornji Grad), and towards Zagreb Observatory (the northernmost point of the neighbourhood) and on to Gupčeva Zvijezda.|$|E

5|$|Glatter has praised MacLachlan's {{involvement}} in his role, believing that he fully embraced and explored {{the character of}} Cooper; she noted that he was as devoted to the character's comedic <b>elements</b> <b>as</b> to his dramatic side and that the crew had difficulty completing takes featuring Cooper without laughing at his comic delivery. She has also noted that although the writers and directors on the series tended to emphasize the rapport between Cooper and Fenn's character Audrey Horne, {{there was never any}} intention to bring the characters together as a couple.|$|E
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table of the elements, it is a d-block transactinide element. It {{is a member of}} the 7th period and belongs to the group 6 <b>elements</b> <b>as</b> the fourth member of the 6d series of transition metals. Chemistry experiments have confirmed that seaborgium behaves as the heavier homologue to tungsten in group 6. The chemical properties of seaborgium are characterized only partly, but they compare well with the chemistry of the other group 6 elements.|$|E
5|$|Music of Turkey {{includes}} mainly Turkic <b>elements</b> <b>as</b> well as partial influences {{ranging from}} Central Asian folk music, Arabic music, Greek music, Ottoman music, Persian music and Balkan music, {{as well as}} references to more modern European and American popular music. The roots of traditional music in Turkey span across centuries {{to a time when}} the Seljuk Turks migrated to Anatolia and Persia in the 11th century and contains elements of both Turkic and pre-Turkic influences. Much of its modern popular music can trace its roots to the emergence in the early 1930s drive for Westernization.|$|E

5|$|On Earth, thorium is {{much more}} abundant: with an {{abundance}} of 8.1parts per million (ppm) in the Earth's crust, {{it is one of the}} most abundant of the heavy elements, almost as abundant as lead (13ppm) and more abundant than tin (2.1ppm). This is because thorium is likely to form oxide minerals that do not sink into the core; it is classified as a lithophile. Common thorium compounds are also poorly soluble in water. Thus, even though the Earth contains the same abundances of the <b>elements</b> <b>as</b> the Solar System as a whole, there is more accessible thorium than heavy platinum group metals in the crust.|$|E
