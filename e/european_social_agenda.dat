50|$|The <b>European</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Agenda</b> {{also plays}} a role in shaping the {{priorities}} of ESF spending. The Social Agenda seeks to update the 'European social model' by modernising labour markets and social protection systems so that workers and businesses can benefit from the opportunities created by international competition, technological advances and changing population patterns while protecting the most vulnerable in society. In addition, the concept of 'flexicurity' contributes to current ESF initiatives. Flexicurity can be defined as a policy strategy to enhance the flexibility of labour markets, work organisations and labour relations, on the one hand, and employment security and income security on the other. The term flexicurity encompasses a new approach to employment involving 'work for life' rather than the 'job for life' model of the past. It encourages workers to take charge of their working lives through lifelong training, adapting to change and mobility.|$|E

40|$|Europe is {{now home}} to a {{significant}} and diverse population of older international migrants. Social and demographic changes have forced the issue of social security in old age onto the <b>European</b> <b>social</b> policy <b>agenda</b> in the last decade. In spite of an increased interest in the financial well-being of older people, many retired international migrants who are legally resident in the European Union face structured disadvantages. Four linked factors are of particular importance in shaping the pension rights and levels of financial provision available to individual older migrants: migration history, socio-legal status, past relationship to the paid labour market, and location within a particular EU Member State. Building on a typology of older migrants, the paper outlines {{the ways in which}} policy at both the European Union and Member State levels serves to diminish rather than enhance the social security rights of certain older international migrants...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{equality}} has {{been central to}} the development of the <b>European</b> Union <b>social</b> <b>agenda</b> to such an extent that it is now universally acknowledged as a constitutionally-embedded norm. This paper discusses how equality has driven important legislative, judicial and institutional change in the EU, particu-larly for women, and how the success of the gender campaign has inspired important changes in respect of other marginalised groups. The paper focuses, in particular, on how the concept of equality offers an appropriate, meaningful and effective basis on which to enhance the status of children in the EU. Following a formal analysis of how children fit within the equality/non-discrimination paradigm at EU constitutional level, the paper moves on to discuss more critically how these provisions are transposed into tangible entitlement for this category of citizens. It explores mainstreaming as a potential mechanism for achieving substantive equality for children, again alluding to the successes of the gender campaign in this respect. The paper concludes by speculating on how a mainstreaming strategy might be adapted and applied in favour of children and discusses the advancements that have already been made in this regard...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the second}} half of the 20 th Century, pension reform has become central to the <b>European</b> <b>social</b> policy <b>agenda,</b> first in terms of {{construction}} and expansion and then increasingly in terms of consolidation and retrenchment. Expenditure growth projections started to be regarded as a serious risk for the sustainability of public finances and the competitiveness of national economies. In a context of demographic ageing and economic transnationalization pension “reform”, often meaning the reduction of benefits, acquired top priority. Most European countries have changed indexation rules, reduced early retirement options, increased retirement ages and encouraged the development of private pensions. Overall, they have reduced expenditure prospects significantly, thereby increasing again the risk of poverty. Several strategies have been used to pass these unpopular reforms, including “obfuscation” to make costs less visible, long phasing-in periods to reduce the opposition of workers close to retirement, dividing potential opponents by treating occupational groups differently, the use of incentives to work longer, and the use of discourse to frame reforms as “inevitable”. Pensions cannot be addressed in isolation; they are embedded in the broader political economy and in the broader set of public policies addressing all phases of the life course...|$|R

To understand {{the conditions under which}} universal policies may have an advantage over means-tested policies, we propose a method of network representation in which partitions are detected by background characteristics of the households. Using non-relational household level data from three countries, we map the association between exclusion from health care, unemployment and poverty. Our results show that households are less likely to form homogeneous partitioning by poverty and health care exclusion profiles, compared to the partitioning formed by poverty and unemployment characteristics. The results suggest that in cases where identifying beneficiaries is difficult, illustrated by heterogeneous partitioning, universal coverage offers an advantage over means-tested social policies.

In the first section, I outline a number of key evolutions within the EU that have had particular consequences for {{the ways in which the}} situation of the Roma is addressed. These are ongoing processes of EU policy-making and institutional change that have been driven by the overall dynamics of European integration, such as the EU’s pursuit to promote fundamental rights standards, the EU enlargement process, and the evolving <b>European</b> <b>social</b> inclusion <b>agenda.</b> In the second section, I consider a number of important events that have clearly spurred the EU’s policy-making on the Roma over the last few years. I highlight in particular the recent upsurge of intra-EU migration, the troubling responses of certain states to the east-west mobility of Roma, and the rise of anti-Roma rhetoric and behaviour. In the third section, I focus on a series of recent EU initiatives and methods meant to facilitate Romani participation in EU policy-making and to stimulate the input of a variety of stakeholders in the debate about what Europe should do. In the fourth section, I explore some of the financial means that the EU has put forward in its attempt to persuade member states to increase their efforts for the inclusion of Roma. To conclude, in the fifth section, I focus on the political dynamics of the EU’s growing concern for the Roma and the unintended consequences these dynamics may produce. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{question}} {{that we would like}} to address in this paper is why an area so nationally embedded as pensions now (since 1999) appears {{to be one of the}} key issues on the <b>European</b> <b>social</b> <b>agenda.</b> The hypothesis in this paper is that it is not a dynamic that emanates from the social domain, but instead, from the economic area. It is not a classical spillover effect, but a struggle to control this field that has just entered the European arena. The inter-linked debates on the reform of pension systems within the European arena have, on the one hand, led to a broad and shared consensus between the social and economic actors on the necessity of having a "three pillar system", inspired by the World Bank's approach to pensions. On the other hand, besides this very general consensus, the key question is how to consider pension reform; in other words, how to define the challenges and to formulate solutions at a European level. The ECOFIN Ministers would like to restrict the scope to financial sustainability, while the Social Council is trying to agree upon and to develop a broader definition, encompassing intergenerational solidarity...|$|E
40|$|Looking {{back from}} the {{perspective}} of the over 40 -year history of European integration, the achievement of common social policy is visible first of all in these fields which supported economic integration and the rising of a uniform market. Until today the question remains open what should be the policy of the Union in face of the large differentiation of social rights and institutional solutions in the systems of social security of the member countries. In this scope there is a dissonance between the general declarations of the Union and practice resulting from the obligatory principle of unanimity in accepting resolutions concerning the questions of social security and the principle of subsidiarity in relations between the Union and member countries. For this reason, among others, the <b>European</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Agenda,</b> adopted in Nice in the year 2000, has essential importance. In accordance with its provisions the priority of the social policy of the Union in the first decade of the XXI century will be co-operation in the solving of common problems (unemployment, poverty and social exclusion, safety of pension systems) and modernisation of the European social model. The accepted goals and an open method of co-ordination as a method of their realisation manifests the greater determination of the Union in the scope of strengthening its social dimension and adaptation of the European social model to contemporary challenges. ...|$|E
40|$|Preliminary and Incomplete Please do not quote The {{increase}} of the female labour force participation has made a change in family forms, equal opportunities and in family responsibil-ity. The commitment between work and family {{is one of the}} major topics on the <b>European</b> <b>social</b> <b>agenda,</b> with another important topic: to eliminate the gender gap between males and females. In this paper we analyze the trend of gender gap between wives and husbands, for Mediterranean Countries with strong tradition in the family, using data from the European Household Panel (ECHP) and European Survey on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC). In general wives and husbands, when married, have the same charac-teristics, but wives suffer from two types of discrimination respect the husbands: a lower wage for the same work and a primary responsibility for children. This paper uses quantile regression and counterfactual decomposi-tion methods to investigate whether a glass ceiling exists or if instead a sticky floor is more prevalent among the European families over time (2001 and 2006). We correct for selectivity the unconditional wage distribution of married women and we show that the wage gap decom-position is different if we ignore self-selection. We find that the wage gap is positive in each country, and the most part of it is composed of discrimination effect, while the characteristics effect is small. In Mediterranean countries wives suffer of sticky floor effect, i. e. the gender gap is bigger at the bottom of the distribution, while we can observe that the glass ceiling effect has reduced in most counries...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to present a legal {{analysis}} of how the legislation and social policies in the field of gender equality in the Netherlands have been influenced by the European integration process. This research is founded on an acknowledgement of the fact that the interaction between the European Union (UE) and member state levels is a two-way process, and considers the ‘Europeanisation of social policy’ as a cyclical process. In the context of the new EU governance discourse, this case study examines the question whether the use by the EU of different instruments of public intervention in social affairs produces different impacts on social legislation and policy at domestic level. This article focuses on the examination of how the European Community legislation on equal treatment for men and women in employment, occupation and on part-time work has been transposed to the domestic level (‘downloading’ or ‘taking’). In addition, the article addresses the question of whether the Dutch actors have been able to upload their approaches and preferences in the area of gender equality legislation to the EU level (‘uploading’ or ‘shaping’). On the ‘uploading’ perspective of the Europeanisation process, the main conclusion of this case study is that the Dutch have been fairly successful in bringing forward several ideas (i. e., a flexible and pro-active approach to part-time work) to the <b>European</b> <b>social</b> <b>agenda.</b> Concerning the ‘downloading’ dimension of the process, despite noticing some disparities in the conceptual field, the findings achieved show that the EU legislation as regards gender equality has been reasonably well transposed into the Dutch legal framework...|$|E

War, poverty, natural disasters, {{and the lack of}} human rights are among many conditions that are literally destroying communities throughout the world. Sport is often advocated as the glue that holds communities together by influencing daily life, social networks and community assimilation. It does, however, need to be managed in a way to foster desired social inclusion and community development (Skinner, Zakus and Cowell, 2008).

40|$|Arguments on "social Europe" {{need to give}} an unequivocal {{answer to}} {{questions}} of why, what, and how. With regard {{to the question of}} why, I argue that, whereas ten years ago the quest for an operational description of the <b>European</b> <b>social</b> model might have been dismissed as interesting but not strictly necessary, today it is no less than an existential conundrum for the Union. EMU must be complemented with a genuine <b>European</b> <b>Social</b> Union, for it to be sustainable in the long term. A Social Union means that the EU would guide the substantive development of national welfare states, via general social standards and objectives, leaving ways and means of social policy to Member States. That presupposes a sufficient degree of consensus on the goals of social policy. It also requires pan-European solidarity based on reciprocity in the relationships between the Member States. With regard to the question of what, I briefly sketch some elements of the ensuing <b>social</b> <b>agenda,</b> with a focus on the notion of social investment.
