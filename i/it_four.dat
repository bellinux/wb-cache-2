The Telegraph gave <b>it</b> <b>four</b> out of five stars. A review in Gizmodo said that it captured extremely high-quality footage, {{but it may be}} higher-end than needed for many gamers that would be satisfied with the recording features built into the console.|$|E

5|$|Initially the old {{tower was}} {{converted}} into a stronger keep which was able to support artillery guns on its roof, a gatehouse was built alongside <b>it,</b> <b>four</b> stirrup towers – so-called because of their shape – a curtain wall was constructed around {{the outside of the}} castle, and bastions erected around the wall. Towards the end of this phase of work the castle was altered in a frantic burst of work, possibly driven on by pressure from the King himself. The height of the curtain wall was increased, the gatehouse extended into an entrance bastion, a new network of underground passages installed, and foreworks added around the outside of the bastions. By the end of 1540 the castle was garrisoned with 17 men and equipped with artillery, with Chute appointed as its captain.|$|E

5|$|It {{was placed}} on the Top Ten lists of several critics, with Roger Ebert giving <b>it</b> <b>four</b> stars, and listed it as 2005's eighth best film. The film {{received}} four Academy Award nominations, for Visual Effects, Sound Mixing (Christopher Boyes, Michael Semanick, Michael Hedges, Hammond Peek), Sound Editing, and Production Design, winning all but the last. Entertainment Weekly called the depiction of Kong the most convincing computer-generated character in film in 2005. Some criticized the film for retaining racist stereotypes that had been present in the 1933 film, though it was not suggested that Jackson had done this intentionally.|$|E
5|$|With the victory, the Indians {{received}} their first playoff berth since the 1920 World Series. Indians' Manager Lou Boudreau dedicated the victory to pitcher Don Black, {{who suffered a}} cerebral hemorrhage the previous month. The Indians went on to face the Boston Braves in the 1948 World Series, winning <b>it</b> <b>four</b> games to two. The Red Sox fans experienced disappointment when Boston mayor James M. Curley ordered the fire department sirens sounded when Boston won the pennant. The sirens did sound, but it was instead for {{a fire in the}} Boston navy yard.|$|E
5|$|The Budapest Gambit {{has never}} been widely used as Black by the top-ten chessplayers. Richard Réti used it five times in the period 1919–26 when {{he was among the}} ten best players in the world, but he scored only 1½ points. Savielly Tartakower used <b>it</b> <b>four</b> times in 1928 when he was the eighth-best player in the world, {{including}} thrice in one tournament (Bad Kissingen 1928) but he scored only ½ point against world-class opposition: Bogoljubov then ranked number four in the world, Capablanca ranked number two, and Rubinstein ranked number seven. Rudolf Spielmann used it thrice in 1922–23 when he was about number 9–12 in the world, with a win against Euwe but defeats against Yates and Sämisch. Nigel Short played the gambit twice in the years 1992–93 when he was number7–11, scoring only ½ points against Karpov (then ranked number two) and Ivanchuk (then ranked number three). Recently, Mamedyarov used it twice in 2004 (scoring 1½ with a win against Van Wely) when he was not already among the top-players, and six times in 2008 when he was about number 6–14; he scored five points with wins against former world champion Kramnik (then ranked number three), and grandmasters Tkachiev and Eljanov, but all six games took place in rapid or blitz events.|$|E

5|$|Two months later, Bridges joined Conference North side Kettering Town on {{a one-year}} deal. Bridges made his debut for Kettering in late August 2007, {{starting}} in the club's 3–2 away win against Worcester City. He scored his first goal for the club in the following game, scoring in the 60th minute to double Kettering's lead in a victory against Tamworth, and followed this up with another goal in the club's 4–1 win against Leigh RMI. Bridges made <b>it</b> <b>four</b> goals in as many games by scoring against both Boston United and Workington respectively. However, he suffered an injury in Kettering's 2–0 home loss to Hyde United in October 2007, ruling him out for two months. He returned to first-team action in December, coming on as a second-half substitute in the club's 3–2 loss against Cambridge City, and scored twice the following week in Kettering's 3–0 home win against Leigh RMI. He started 2008 by scoring Kettering's fifth in a 6–1 victory against Solihull Moors, as well as scoring in the next game – heading in Kettering's second in a 3–1 win against Harrogate Town. Bridges scored his ninth goal of the campaign shortly after, doubling the club's lead in a 2–0 away win at Hucknall Town. Bridges featured regularly during the club's {{second half of the}} season, getting on the scoresheet in a 3–0 away victory at Hyde United, before scoring Kettering's third in another 3–0 win, this time against AFC Telford United – his last appearance for the club. He was instrumental for the Northamptonshire club throughout Kettering's 2007–08 league campaign, scoring a total of 11 goals in 27 appearances to help guide Kettering to promotion to the Conference National.|$|E
5|$|When it was {{originally}} built, the Feather River Highway northeast from Oroville followed the present Oroville Dam Boulevard (County Route B2) to the present location of the Oroville Dam, and then ran north and northeast alongside the North Fork Feather River along a route now covered by Lake Oroville. It left to the north on Dark Canyon Road, meeting the present alignment at Jarbo Gap. Since the old road would be flooded, a $14.8 million new alignment, much of <b>it</b> <b>four</b> lanes, was built around the west side; the Western Pacific Railroad was also relocated to a nearby alignment. The double-decker West Branch Bridge over the West Branch Feather River northwest of the dam, carrying the highway above the rail line, was dedicated on August 15, 1962. Three portions of SR 70 have been upgraded to freeways: north of SR 99 to Berry and Kempton Roads in the early 2010s; south from Marysville to the State Route 65 split in the mid-1950s, extended farther south in the late 1960s and late 2000s; and around downtown Oroville, built in the early 1960s. In 2004, SR 70 was upgraded to a four-lane expressway between Feather River Boulevard north of the Bear River and the Yuba/Sutter county line to the freeway portion south of McGowan Parkway. A freeway interchange was constructed in 2008 at Plumas Lake Boulevard {{for access to the}} Plumas Lake development previously served at an uncontrolled intersection with Plumas Arboga Road. The removal of this intersection effectively upgraded the expressway portion to freeway south to the Feather River Boulevard intersection. In the early 2010s, the last two-lane segment of SR 70 south of Marysville was expanded to a four-lane expressway, with a freeway section bypassing the small town of East Nicolaus to the west. In 2015, the interchange with Feather River Boulevard in Plumas Lake was opened to traffic, eliminating the last signalized intersection between Sacramento (with SR 99) and Marysville.|$|E
