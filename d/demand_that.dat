5|$|At Kruger's {{suggestion}} Joubert {{was elected}} Commandant-General of the restored republic, {{though he had}} little military experience and protested he was not suited to the position. The provisional government set up a temporary capital at Heidelberg, a strategically placed town {{on the main road}} from Natal, and sent a copy of the proclamation to Lanyon along with a written <b>demand</b> <b>that</b> he surrender the government offices in Pretoria. Lanyon refused and mobilised the British garrison.|$|E

The government established a joint Army–Navy board to provide recommendations on the matter, with Blamey and Lieutenant Colonel Richard Williams as the Army representatives.

As a result, Lincoln replaced Buell with William Rosecrans; and, after the 1862 midterm elections, he replaced McClellan with Republican Ambrose Burnside. Both of these replacements were political moderates and prospectively more supportive of the Commander-in-Chief.|$|E

5|$|After {{graduating from}} Rutgers, Friedman was offered two {{scholarships}} to do graduate work—one in mathematics at Brown University {{and the other}} in economics at the University of Chicago. Friedman chose the latter, thus earning a Master of Arts degree in 1933. He was strongly influenced by Jacob Viner, Frank Knight, and Henry Simons. It was at Chicago that Friedman met his future wife, economist Rose Director. During the 1933–1934 academic year he had a fellowship at Columbia University, where he studied statistics with renowned statistician and economist Harold Hotelling. He was back in Chicago for the 1934–1935 academic year, working as a research assistant for Henry Schultz, who was then working on Theory and Measurement of <b>Demand.</b> <b>That</b> year, Friedman formed what would prove to be lifelong friendships with George Stigler and W.

5|$|After the American Civil War, both Stanton and Anthony {{broke with}} their {{abolitionist}} backgrounds and lobbied strongly against {{ratification of the}} Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, which granted African American men the right to vote. Believing that African American men, {{by virtue of the}} Thirteenth Amendment, already had the legal protections, except for suffrage, offered to white male citizens and that so largely expanding the male franchise in the country would only increase the number of voters prepared to deny women the right to vote, both Stanton and Anthony were angry that the abolitionists, their former partners in working for both African American and women's rights, refused to <b>demand</b> <b>that</b> the language of the amendments be changed to include women.|$|E

This was a large issue in the area during the whole of the 1980s.|$|E

She runs off into the bush, falls down a cliff and injures her ankle. Zeke also falls down the cliff, they are eventually rescued by Declan and Lucas Fitzgerald (Scott Major). Karl and Susan call Sunny's parents and learn that they know nothing about the festival or Zeke. Sunny's parents <b>demand</b> <b>that</b> she {{is placed on the}} next flight home. However, Zeke moves out, so Sunny's parents will not worry about them having a relationship. Zeke later moves back home and Karl asks Sunny to call her father and translate for him.

5|$|Davis {{faced the}} most {{important}} decision of his career: to prevent reinforcement at Fort Sumter or to let it take place. He and his cabinet decided to <b>demand</b> <b>that</b> the Federal garrison surrender and, if this was refused, {{to use military force}} to prevent reinforcement before the fleet arrived. Major Anderson did not surrender. With Jefferson Davis's endorsement, Beauregard began the bombarding of the fort in the early dawn of April 12. The Confederates continued their artillery attack on Fort Sumter until it surrendered on April 14. No one was killed in the artillery duel, but the attack on the U.S. fortress meant the fighting had started. President Lincoln called up state militia to march south to recapture Federal property. In the North and South, massive rallies were held to demand immediate war. The Civil War had begun.|$|E
5|$|Despite strong {{warnings}} {{that it was}} a bad idea, the War Cabinet decided to impose conscription on Ireland in 1918. The main reason was that labour in Britain demanded it as the price for cutting back on exemptions for certain workers. Labour wanted the principle established that no one was exempt, but it did not <b>demand</b> <b>that</b> conscription should actually take place in Ireland. The proposal was enacted, but never enforced. The Roman Catholic bishops for the first time entered the fray, calling for open resistance to compulsory military service, while the majority of Irish nationalists moved to supporting the intransigent Sinn Féin movement (away from the constitutional Irish National Party). This proved a decisive moment, marking the end of Irish willingness to stay inside the Union.|$|E
