5|$|On {{his first}} day in office, Daniels created Indiana's first Office of Management and Budget to look for inefficiencies and cost savings {{throughout}} state government. The same day, he decertified all government employee unions by executive order, removing the requirement that state employees pay union dues by rescinding a mandate created by Governor <b>Evan</b> <b>Bayh</b> in a 1989 executive order. Dues-paying union membership subsequently dropped 90% among state employees.|$|E

Obama selected Biden from a field speculated to include former Indiana Governor and Senator <b>Evan</b> <b>Bayh</b> and Virginia Governor Tim Kaine. At the Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado, Hillary Clinton called for her supporters to endorse Obama, {{and she and}} Bill Clinton gave convention speeches in his support. Obama delivered his acceptance speech, not at the center where the Democratic National Convention was held, but at Invesco Field at Mile High to a crowd of approximately 84,000 people; the speech was viewed by over 38million people worldwide.|$|E
5|$|While a territory, Indiana had two President-appointed governors. Since {{statehood}} in 1816, {{it has had}} 47 governors, serving 49 distinct terms; Isaac P. Gray and Henry F. Schricker are {{the only}} governors to have served non-consecutive terms. The longest-serving state governors are Otis R. Bowen, <b>Evan</b> <b>Bayh</b> and Mitch Daniels at 8 years, 4 days; territorial governor William Henry Harrison served for over 12 years. The shortest-serving governor is Henry Smith Lane, who served two days before resigning to become a U.S. Senator. The current governor is Eric Holcomb who took office on January 9, 2017 succeeding Mike Pence who later became Vice President of the United States on January 20, 2017.|$|E
5|$|To {{counteract}} these increasing {{complaints and}} attempts at legislation, {{the video game}} industry in the United States created the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) in 1994. This was prompted by a 1993 congressional hearing over {{the violence in the}} video game Mortal Kombat and lack of consistent content ratings between publishers, with Congress threatening to pass legislation that would mandate a ratings system if the industry did not take its own steps. The industry reacted by forming the Interactive Digital Software Association, which would become the ESA, and establishing the ESRB. The ESRB, like the Motion Picture Association of America's rating system, is a voluntary and self-regulated body that examines the content of video games as provided by the publisher before distribution, and given a rating describing the content within, generally classified from being all ages-appropriate to adult audiences only. Video game distributors are similarly bound by voluntary compliance to check the age of the purchaser against the rating of the game to prevent the sale of mature titles to younger players. Most stores prevent the sale of unrated games, so virtually every video game sold at retail in the United States is rated by the ESRB. Attempts have been made to mandate the ratings system; the Family Entertainment Protection Act, a 2005 bill introduced into the U.S. Congress by Senators Hillary Clinton, Joseph Lieberman, and <b>Evan</b> <b>Bayh,</b> would have made ESRB participation mandatory with oversight by the Federal Trade Commission, and introduced fines for selling Mature or Adult-Only content to minors. The bill, however, did not clear the Senate. Though the ESRB met criticism in 2000–2005 for the ease of access of mature-rated games to minors, the Board has improved its efforts to enforce the ratings system at retailers. A 2011 report issued by the Federal Trade Commission found that the voluntary controls by the ESRB had the highest success rate of any media industry, preventing sales of mature titles to minors 87% of the time. Similar content rating systems exist in other countries, including the British Board of Film Classification, the Australian Classification Board, and Japan's Computer Entertainment Rating Organization.|$|E

40|$|In a {{traditionally}} Republican-leaning state, former Democratic Senator <b>Evan</b> <b>Bayh’s</b> bid {{to get his}} old job back now means that Indiana may be competitive for the Democrats in the Hoosier’ State’s US Senate election this year. As part of our series on this year’s key Senate races, Andre P. Audette writes that Bayh may not face an easy race. GOP Congressman Todd Young has been relatively insulated from any negative effects flowing from having Donald Trump {{at the top of}} the ticket, and Bayh has already faced accusations that he no longer maintains his Indiana connections...|$|R

25|$|The {{race for}} the 2008 presidential {{nomination}} began in earnest after the 2006 midterm elections. Between November 2006 and February 2007, eight major candidates opened their campaigns-Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, Chris Dodd, John Edwards, Dennis Kucinich, Barack Obama, Bill Richardson, and Tom Vilsack-joining Mike Gravel, who had announced his candidacy in April 2006. Potential candidates John Kerry, Al Gore, Russ Feingold, <b>Evan</b> <b>Bayh,</b> Tom Daschle, Wesley Clark, Mark Warner, and Al Sharpton reportedly considered running but ultimately declined to seek the nomination. Vilsack dropped out in February 2007.|$|E
25|$|Media {{speculation}} {{had begun}} {{almost immediately after}} {{the results of the}} 2004 presidential election were released. In the 2006 midterm elections, the Democrats regained majorities in both houses of the U.S. Congress. Early polls taken before anyone had announced a candidacy had shown Senators Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama as the most popular potential Democratic candidates. Nevertheless, the media speculated on several other candidates, including Al Gore, the runner-up in the 2000 election; John Kerry, the runner-up in the 2004 election; John Edwards, Kerry's running mate in 2004; Senator from Delaware Joe Biden; New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson; Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack; and Indiana Senator <b>Evan</b> <b>Bayh.</b>|$|E
50|$|Townsend {{received}} 1,036,832 ballots (47.2 {{percent of}} the two-party vote) to Orr's 1,146,497 (52.8 percent). Townsend ran 195,351 votes ahead of his party's presidential nominee, former Vice President of the United States Walter F. Mondale of Minnesota. In January 1977, Townsend, then {{a member of the}} Indiana State Senate, cast the tie-breaking vote to ratify the proposed Equal Rights Amendment. The Senate had been deadlocked 25-25 on ERA. First Lady Rosalynn Smith Carter telephoned Townsend and urged him to switch his vote. Townsend did accordingly change his vote, and the ERA passed, 26-24. Indiana became the 35th and final state to ratify the controversial amendment, which was opposed by a grassroots organization headed by conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly, then of Illinois. Thirty-eight states are required for ratification of a constitutional amendment. Townsend and former U.S. Senator Birch <b>Evans</b> <b>Bayh,</b> Jr., were classmates at Purdue University in West Lafayette. In 1980, Bayh was unseated by Dan Quayle, as Reagan-Bush electors first carried Indiana. Until 2004, Townsend was a Purdue trustee. In 2007, he received the Frank O'Bannon Public Service Award, named for the former Democratic governor of Indiana who died in office in 2003. In 2004, Townsend, a veteran crusader for liberal causes, was an advocate for presidential hopeful Howard Dean of Vermont, who thereafter became the chairman of the Democratic National Committee.|$|R
