5|$|Hurricane Olga <b>formed</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{subtropical}} cyclone on November 24 and meandered westward {{where it}} reached hurricane status on November 26.

Olga dissipated as a tropical cyclone on December 6 east of the Bahamas.|$|E

5|$|It {{has long}} been {{recognised}} that a range of sulfate and halide (primarily chloride and fluoride) compounds are readily mobilised from fresh volcanic ash.; It is considered most likely that these salts are <b>formed</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> consequence of rapid acid dissolution of ash particles within eruption plumes, which is thought to supply the cations involved in the deposition of sulfate and halide salts.|$|E
5|$|M-96 was <b>formed</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> state {{trunkline}} in late 1926 from {{parts of}} M-17. The section of M-17 between Galesberg and Battle Creek was not utilized for US12 and became M-96. In 1936, the Alternate US12 trunkline was designated through the Battle Creek area along {{a section of}} highway {{that had previously been}} part of US12. This highway was added to M-96 three years later in 1939.|$|E

5|$|TCDD {{has never}} been {{produced}} commercially except as a pure chemical for scientific research. It is, however, <b>formed</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> synthesis side product when producing certain chlorophenols or chlorophenoxy acid herbicides. It may also be formed along with other polychlorinated dibenzodioxins and dibenzofuranes in any burning, especially if certain metal catalysts such as copper are present (see dioxins and dioxin-like compounds).|$|E

5|$|Weinreb and Nahm {{originally}} {{proposed the}} following reaction mechanism {{to explain the}} selectivity shown in reactions of the Weinreb–Nahm amide. Their suggestion was that the tetrahedral intermediate (A below) <b>formed</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of nucleophilic acyl substitution by the organometallic reagent is stabilized by chelation from the methoxy group as shown. This intermediate is stable only at low temperatures, requiring a low-temperature quench.|$|E
5|$|All these bands {{played a}} part in {{developing}} the overall look and sound of glam metal during the early 1980s. In 1985, many more commercially successful glam metal albums began to appear. Mötley Crüe released Theatre of Pain, Ratt's second album Invasion of Your Privacy, Dokken's third album Under Lock and Key, Stryper's first release Soldiers Under Command, Bon Jovi's second release 7800° Fahrenheit, and Autograph's second album That's The Stuff. Los Angeles continued to foster the most important scene around the Sunset Strip, with groups like London, which had originally <b>formed</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> glam rock band in the 1970s, and had seen future members of Mötley Crüe, Cinderella and Guns N' Roses pass through its ranks, finally releasing their début album Non Stop Rock in 1985 as well.|$|E
5|$|Cyclonic Storm Komen was {{an unusual}} {{tropical}} cyclone that originated near the southern coast of Bangladesh and later struck the same country while drifting over the northern Bay of Bengal. The second named storm of the 2015 season, Komen brought several days of heavy rainfall to Myanmar, Bangladesh, and India. It <b>formed</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> depression on July26 over the Ganges delta and moved in a circular motion around the northern Bay of Bengal. Komen intensified into a 75km/h (45mph) cyclonic storm and moved ashore southeastern Bangladesh on July30. The system turned westward over land and was last noted over eastern India on August2.|$|E
