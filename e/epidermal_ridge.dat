40|$|Regeneration was {{studied in}} the Ambystoma annulatum by the {{amputation}} of the right forearm of twenty-four adults, over a twelve month period. At the termination of the experiment the limbs were reamputated 1 - 2 mm proximal to the original amputation site. The regenerated portions were staged, examined at the gross morphological level, and prepared for histological examination. Gross examination revealed a thickened, ridge-like projection along the distal edge of all regenerating forelimbs at the Early Bud through Middle Palette Stages. Histological examination confirmed {{the existence of this}} structure as early as Wound Healing and continuing through Middle Palette to a pseudo-epidermal ridge in the Late Palette Stage. This <b>epidermal</b> <b>ridge</b> is continuous with the adjacent epidermis, but the <b>epidermal</b> <b>ridge</b> extends only along the dorsal distal edge of the regenerate. The epidermis proximal to the original amputation site was, at the maximum, 4 - 5 cells thick, whereas the <b>epidermal</b> <b>ridge</b> proved to be 60 - 65 cells at its maximum thickness. It is significant that an <b>epidermal</b> <b>ridge</b> appears on the distal tip of a regenerating adult forelimb in the stages Wound Healing through Middle Palette. A comparable structure, the apical ectodermal ridge, occurs during similar stages in embryonic chick limb development and embryonic amphibian limb development and has been considered a unique, embryonic feature.

30|$|Dermatoglyphics is {{the study}} of the <b>epidermal</b> <b>ridge</b> {{patterns}} on the skin of the fingers, palms, toes, and soles (Cummins and Midlo 1961). Epidermal patterns start to develop during the sixth and seventh weeks of intrauterine life, and are fully formed {{by the end of the}} second trimester (Blackwell 1994). These anatomical structures have been used widely in the field of anthropology (Meier 1980) in addition to also being used in medicine and genetics as a valuable diagnostic tool (Holt 1973; Reed and Opitz 1981; Shiono 1986). There is a popularity of using dermatoglyphics as a non-invasive diagnostic tool to detect and predict different medical conditions that occur in early life (Kumar and Manou 2003; Fuller 1973; Cvjeticanin et al. 2009; Pakhale et al. 2012; Gupta and Karjodkar 2013), especially in clinical settings with minimal high tech diagnostic capabilities.

The study involved 102 cases of CHD and 100 cases of normal individuals. It was observed that percent frequency of ulnar loops significantly increased in CHD group as compared to control group. Mean 'atd' angle was also increased in CHD group as compared to control group indicating distal displacement of palmar axial triradius (t). Thus, rise in frequency of ulnar loops and increase in 'atd' angle can be considered as one of the diagnostic criteria for CHD. ...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Expression of cancer/testis-associated {{proteins}} (CTAs) {{has traditionally}} been considered to be restricted to germ cells in normal tissues and to different types of malignancies. We have evaluated the potential role of CTAs in early human development. METHODS: Using immunohistochemistry and RT–PCR, we investigated the expression of CTAs in differentiated human embryonic stem cells (hESC) and in late embryos and early fetuses. RESULTS: We found that melanoma antigen A (MAGE-A) family members were expressed during differentiation of hESC to embryoid bodies and in teratomas, and overlapped with expression of the neuroectodermal markers beta-tubulin 3, Pax 6 and nestin. A widespread expression of MAGE-A was also observed in neurons of the early developing central nervous system and peripheral nerves. G antigen (GAGE) expression was present in the early ectoderm of embryos, including cells of the ectodermal ring and apical <b>epidermal</b> <b>ridge.</b> Neuroectodermal cells in the floor plate and adjacent processes and endfeet of radial glial cells also expressed GAGE. In addition, GAGE family members were expressed in the peripheral adrenal cortex of 6 – 9 -week-old embryos and fetuses, which specifically correlated with massive cellular proliferation and establishment of the definitive and fetal zones. Overlapping expression of MAGE-A and GAGE proteins occurred in migrating primordial germ cells. CONCLUSIONS: Ou...|$|E
40|$|A {{growing body}} of {{etiological}} research suggests that prenatal insult or injury can create a biological vulnerability for developing psychosis. When combined with genetic and environmental factors, these biological vulnerabilities can increase an individual’s chances of developing a psychotic disorder such as schizophrenia. One marker of prenatal insult or injury that has been widely researched in schizophrenia, but not in ultrahigh-risk (UHR) populations, is dermatoglyphics, <b>epidermal</b> <b>ridge</b> patterns that form on fingerprints and palms. Dermatoglyphics form during weeks 14 - 22 of fetal development, a critical time {{for the formation of}} the central nervous system (CNS). One specific neural structure that is of interest in the context of psychosis is the hippocampus, as its structure and function has been implicated across the psychosis spectrum. Further, hippocampal function is implicated in working memory deficits characteristic of individuals with psychosis, and the structure is highly sensitive during the prenatal period. In the present study, dermatoglyphics, symptoms, and cognitive data were collected on 59 UHR and 60 healthy control adolescents. The present study found elevated dermatoglyphic asymmetries within the UHR group as compared to healthy controls. No significant group differences were found in a spatial working memory task. However, elevated dermatoglyphic asymmetries were significantly associated with lower spatial working memory scores and increased attenuated symptoms but not with a more general measure of intelligence (recruiting from structures outside of the medial temporal region). The present study provides insight into prenatal vulnerabilities of a given UHR sample, and additionally supports a neural diathesis-stress model of psychosis...|$|E

40|$|The {{enhanced}} {{differentiation of}} mesenchymal cells into chondrocytes or osteoblasts is {{of paramount importance}} in tissue engineering and regenerative therapies. A newly emerging body of evidence demonstrates that appendage regeneration is dependent on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and signaling. Thus, we hypothesized that mesenchymal cell stimulation by nonthermal (NT) -plasma, which produces and induces ROS, would (1) promote skeletal cell differentiation and (2) limb autopod development. Stimulation with a single treatment of NT-plasma enhanced survival, growth, and elongation of mouse limb autopods in an in vitro organ culture system. Noticeable changes included enhanced development of digit length and definition of digit separation. These changes were coordinated with enhanced Wnt signaling in the distal apical <b>epidermal</b> <b>ridge</b> (AER) and presumptive joint regions. Autopod development continued to advance for approximately 144 [*]h in culture, seemingly overcoming the negative culture environment usually observed in this in vitro system. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis confirmed the up-regulation of chondrogenic transcripts. Mechanistically, NT-plasma increased the number of ROS positive cells in the dorsal epithelium, mesenchyme, and the distal tip of each phalange behind the AER, determined using dihydrorhodamine. The importance of ROS production/signaling during development was further demonstrated by the stunting of digital outgrowth when anti-oxidants were applied. Results of this study show NT-plasma initiated and amplified ROS intracellular signaling to enhance development of the autopod. Parallels between development and regeneration suggest that the potential use of NT-plasma could extend to both tissue engineering and clinical applications to enhance fracture healing, trauma repair, and bone fusion...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Dermatoglyphics {{have proven}} to be a helpful tool in {{identifying}} specific syndromes of genetic origins. Any <b>epidermal</b> <b>ridge</b> alterations in individuals may have a distinctive dermatoglyphic feature. An attempt has been made to find out any significant variation in-patient of Thalassemia major, so it can be highlighted with a view to assess its value as a diagnostic marker. Methodology: Palm prints of 100 diagnosed patients of Thalassemia were studied and study matched with 100 healthy subjects. Results: The preset study shows autosomal recessive inheritance caused by a single mutant gene. The chain is coded by gene on chromosome no- 16 &gene on chromosome No- 11; unusual dermatoglyphics are reported in-patient with single gene disorders. Thalassemia is also a single gene disorder so it too can be added to this list. Parameters studied were &# 8216;atd&# 8217; angle, &# 8216;a-b&# 8217; ridge count and main line index. It was observed that the &# 8216;atd&# 8217; angle wider in patients in comparison to control group, which indicates distal displacement of axial tri-radius. It was also found that more number of patients fell under the group of high ridge count. The difference was significant statistically for right hand. Low main line index was observed in patients which indicates vertical alignment of ridges. Conclusion: The deviation of the different dermatoglyphic features in patients of Thalassemia major provides a single, inexpensive method of clinical observation and adds another new diagnostic tool to the clinicians.

40|$|The {{configurations}} of epidermal ridges that comprise dermatoglyphic traits are, in many respects, {{a history of}} the developmental period during which the ridges form. In 1892 Sir Francis Galton [l] demon-strated that <b>epidermal</b> <b>ridge</b> configurations did not change throughout postnatal life. The fact that ridge configurations were not affected by environment or by age has been an important framework in genetic studies. In 1936, Cummins [2] reported the association of unusual der-matoglyphics with Down syndrome. Confirmation of his findings [3 -_ 51 demonstrated the potential value of dermatoglyphics in clinical med-icine. While not diagnostic alone, dermatoglyphics have been a valuable aid when clinical diagnosis was in doubt. Unusual dermatoglyphics now have been associated with congenital defects of both genetic and en-vironmental origin [6]. Schaumann and Johnson [7] have noted that dermatoglyphics associated with congenital defects are significant mark-ers of prenatal events. Yet, at present {{little is known about the}} atypical developmental processes that have produced these associations. The precise configuration of epidermal ridges and minutiae is determined at a very early embryonic age, around 10 weeks postfertilization. Ac-cordingly, an understanding of the prenatal morphogenesis of derma-toglyphic traits is fundamental to our interpretation of their variation and their relationship to birth defects. The developmental history of dermatoglyphic traits requires first a background in the normal developmental chronology of prenatal hand. Second, it includes an understanding’of the development of epidermal ridges, the basic building blocks of dermatoglyphic traits, and factors that may influence ridge configuration.

40|$|The {{fingerprint}} pattern (<b>epidermal</b> <b>ridge</b> pattern) becomes established {{at about the}} 10 th to 16 th week of pregnancy, when the lowest layer of the epidermis, the basal layer, becomes undulated. The pattern established by these undulations becomes visible on the skin surface in subsequent weeks of pregnancy. We argue that the undulation process is initiated by buckling of the basal layer. The necessary compressive stress is generated by differential growth. The instability is investigated using the classic von Karman equations for curved surfaces. The analysis reveals that ridges (rolls) {{are the most common}} pattern type and that the local ridge direction of the pattern is perpendicular to the direction of largest stress. For certain parameter regimes dot patterns (hexagons) are a stable solution of the equations. Such dot patterns are, in fact, observed on the palms of certain marsupials. The stress in the basal layer is induced by two mechanisms. First, the basal layer expands faster than the other skin structures. Such expansion is resisted at the major flexion creases and the nail furrow. Second, there is a change in fingertip geometry at the time of pattern generation that provides a different source of growth stress. The combination of the two processes predicts the correct sequence of pattern spread over the fingertip. It also explains the observation that fingerprint configurations are related to the fingertip geometry at the time of ridge formation. Computer simulations for the most important configurations exhibit many features of actual fingerprints and suggest directions for future work...|$|E
40|$|The goal of my {{research}} is to elucidate the organization of ceramic production at Tell Leilan with respect to gender roles during from 3400 to 1700 BCE through a study of fingerprint impressions on pottery.

There is a discrete change in the sex of potters at Leilan with the rise of urbanism and state formation at the site, but there is no alteration in this pattern that correlates with changes in the various regimes that had hegemony over the site over time during the Early and Middle Bronze Age. This result informs us about the effect of state authority on the public and private organization of crafts as well as the division of society along gender lines. Surprisingly, the change that occurs with the rise of the state at Tell Leilan does not occur at village sites in the Leilan Regional Survey. This result indicates that the changes in social fabric that occurred at urban sites with the establishment of state institutions did not occur to the same extent in hinterland settlements even though the state did control some of the ceramic production at these sites, at least during the Akkadian period.

40|$|Perception {{mechanisms}} of fine gratings still remain very obscure. Among their determinants, {{the knowledge of}} the fingerprint role could be a central issue: epidermal ridges are already known to be responsible for detection of small features on a surface, slippage and anisotropies in the perception of gaps or gratings. It is the reason why it appears essential to better characterize their “psychotribologic ” role in the dynamic contact of lateral touch. The first experiment shows that roughness perception depends on the commensurability and conformance between ridges of the epidermis and gratings. Then, a vibroacoustic experiment is proposed. It is splitted into three phases to better understand {{mechanisms of}} vibration emergence. Contrary to previous approach on the topic that are mainly centred on the vibration on the finger, the attention is focused on the consequences of the excitation of the finger on the texture. Spectrograms and scalograms illustrate that deformable bodies at contact generate inertial force on each other. Systematic relationships between the intensive or frequency parameters of the vibration at contact and perception of gratings were absent. However, the influence of the relative orientation between ridges of the texture and fingerprint on the vibratory mechanisms showed the importance of spatial determinants. The more textures fit together at the scale of the <b>epidermal</b> <b>ridge,</b> the more the average intensity in shear force, part of friction, and resulting vibration at contact increases. This suggests that a roughness code could be initiated spatially, even at small scales. The reliability of a non spatial roughness code with only intensive and temporal cues is finally checked. Vibration recorded with a vibrometer and played back on the skin with an electromagnetic shaker were barely sensed, and at best, as a flutter of negligible amplitude when amplified and applied tangentially to the skin. ...|$|E
