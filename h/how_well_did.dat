This son of Sirach even says--I saw it but just now: 'Take heed of thy friends;' not, observe, thy seeming friends, thy hypocritical friends, thy false friends, but thy friends, thy real friends--that is to say, not the truest friend in the world is to be implicitly trusted. Can Rochefoucault equal that? I should not wonder if his view of human nature, like Machiavelli's, was taken from this Son of Sirach. And to call it wisdom--the Wisdom of the Son of Sirach! Wisdom, indeed! What an ugly thing wisdom must be! Give me the folly that dimples the cheek, say I, rather than the wisdom that curdles the blood. But no, no; it ain't wisdom; it's apocrypha, as you say, sir. For how can that be trustworthy that teaches distrust?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Acton’s {{letters in}} reply may have {{convinced}} Mr. Gladstone {{that there were}} depths in this supreme controversy that he had hardly sounded; and adversaria {{that he might have}} mocked from a professor of the school or schools of unbelief, he could not in his inner mind make light of, when coming from the pen of a catholic believer. Before and after the article on Robert Elsmere appeared, Acton, the student with his vast historic knowledge and his deep penetrating gaze, warned the impassioned critic of some historic point overstated or understated, some dangerous breach left all unguarded, some lack of nicety in definition. Acton’s letters will one day see the light, and the reader may then know how candidly Mr. Gladstone was admonished as to the excess of his description of the moral action of Christianity; as to the risk of sending modern questions to ancient answers, for the apologists of an age can only meet the difficulties of their age; that there are leaps and bounds in the history of thought; <b>how</b> <b>well</b> <b>did</b> Newman once say that in theology you have to meet questions that the Fathers could hardly have been made to understand; how if you go to St. Thomas or Leibnitz or Paley for rescue from Hegel or Haeckel your apologetics will be a record of disaster.

40|$|Over {{the past}} five years, California State University, Bakersfield (CSUB) {{recruited}} 39 Noyce Scholars for STEM teacher preparation in high-needs schools. As of April 1, 2014, the program has saved approximate $ 150, 000 of NSF funding for this grant. In this summative report, program effectiveness has been examined in three aspects, Noyce Scholar recruitment, institutional support for teacher preparation, and the concurrent impact on high-needs schools. The evaluation design conforms to a well-established model of Results-Based Accountability to address nine questions: (1) How much {{has been done in}} student recruitment? (2) <b>How</b> <b>well</b> <b>did</b> the program perform in student recruitment? (3) Did high-needs schools benefit from the Noyce Scholar recruitment?

40|$|The Humanities Department {{embarked}} on curriculum redesign for Sec 1 History, Lower Sec Geography and Upper Sec Social Studies beginning 2005. This {{was a result}} of evaluation of pedagogical processes and reflection by the staff members on how teaching and learning can be redesigned to meet pupils ’ needs. Driving us were four essential questions: How much should pupils learn? How much did pupils learn? <b>How</b> <b>well</b> <b>did</b> they learn it? <b>How</b> <b>well</b> <b>did</b> we teach it? In doing so, we realized the need to depart from a didactic and direct mode of instruction through coaching to one that involves both pupils and teachers to be more facilitative and reflective in approach. The Commerce Department also {{embarked on}} curriculum redesign for the teaching and learning of Principles of Accounts and Elements of Office Administration. For the former, the efforts to meet pupils’ needs resulted in customized learning materials designed by teachers to better facilitate conceptual attainment with emphasis on graphic representation of ideas. For NT pupils taking EOA, learning is made real with hands-on office attachment as well as maximizing learning with Elective Modules supported by MOE. The above efforts at Curriculum Redesign seek to address the call for all to “Teach Less and Learn More”, through experiential learning in an environment that promotes pupil thinking, engagement and achievement. This paper seeks to detail the process of redesign and the progressive results obtained from our efforts...|$|E
40|$|The Pacific University School of Physician Assistant Studies {{graduated}} {{its first}} class of fourteen PAs in August 1999. The program awards a Master of Science in Physician Assistant Studies {{with the mission}} 2 ̆ 2 to prepare students to provide care for a diverse population in a changing healthcare environment through an education based in primary care medicine {{with a focus on}} critical thinking 2 ̆ 2. The PA program received full accreditation through the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs (CAAHEP) following graduation of the first class in 1999. To maintain ongoing accreditation, all PA programs must document evidence of continuous self-evaluation and internal curriculum restructuring {{to keep pace with the}} demands of changing medical practice. This survey was devised to meet CAAHEP requirements and to answer the research question: <b>how</b> <b>well</b> <b>did</b> the PA programs: <b>how</b> <b>well</b> <b>did</b> the PA program prepare its graduates for clinical practice? Surveys of the Class of 1999 graduates and their supervising physicians were devised, implemented, collected, analyzed, and recorded. Descriptive statistics were computed and recorded in tabular and graphical forms to answer the research question. Overall, PAs and their supervising physician indicates that the PAs were well prepared for clinical practice in their first jobs. All graduates were employed as clinical PAs within four months of graduation, and all successfully passed the Physician Assistant National Certification Examination (PANCE) on the first attempt. Further demographic and employment data were represented and analyzed for uniformity and trends.

40|$|<b>How</b> <b>well</b> <b>did</b> Kenyans {{do under}} colonial rule? It is common sense that Kenyans {{suffered}} under exploitative colonial policies. The overall impact, however, is uncertain. This study presents fresh evidence on nutrition and health in colonial Kenya by (1) {{using a new}} and comprehensive data set of African army recruits and civilians and (2) applying a powerful measure of nutritional status: mean population height. Findings demonstrate huge regional inequalities but only minor changes in the mean height of cohorts born 20 years before and after colonisation. From 1920 onwards secular improvements took place which continued after Independence. It can be concluded that however bad colonial policies and devastating short term crises were, the net outcome of colonial times was a significant progress in nutrition and health...|$|E
40|$|A {{survey was}} sent to large animal track {{students}} of Colorado State University (CSU) that have graduated {{in the last five}} years. Questions centered on the American Association of Equine Practitioners Competencies, listed as the Business of veterinary medicine, Client education and Regulatory responsibilities, Anesthesia, Dentistry, Examination, Husbandry, Medical knowledge, Radiology, Reproduction and Surgery techniques. The students were allowed to give responses of free text. The response rate was 31 %. The first main question was: <b>How</b> <b>well</b> <b>did</b> the CSU equine veterinary curriculum address the following areas? Answer options were: too much, just right, not enough. There were 4 of the 11 categories where more than 30 % of the respondents felt that there was not enough theoretical information in the curriculum to make them feel confident in practice. Those categories were: Business (49 %), Dentistry (32 %), Radiology (32 %) and Surgery (41 %). They felt most prepared in Anesthesia, Physical Examination, Reproduction and Basic Techniques. The second main question was: <b>How</b> <b>well</b> <b>did</b> the CSU equine veterinary curriculum provide practical skills in the following areas? Answer options were: excellent preparation, good preparation, moderately unprepared, severely unprepared. When combining the unprepared categories, 4 categories gave greater than 40 % unprepared students: Business (62 %), Dentistry (43 %), Radiology (41 %) and Surgery (59 %). They felt most prepared in Client interaction, Anesthesia, Husbandry and Basic Techniques. Based on this, the equine curriculum is currently being evaluated. To improve the curriculum, a two-week clinical rotation, focusing on teaching these skills, was outlined, beginning May 2017. Basic laceration repair is now taught during the normal two-week equine lameness and surgery rotations.

And (3) <b>How</b> <b>well</b> <b>did</b> this attainment predict student productivity on the job as determined by the employer’s customer satisfaction? A sample of 118 student attainment scores on the written and performance components showed positive correlation. Further, this attainment was positively correlated with employers’ customer satisfaction ratings. The panel of 16 national experts who participated in this study concluded that the Nedelsky (1974) method used to set the cut score needed to be re-evaluated. They also recommended that the scheme of calculation for determining one composite achievement level from the two test components should be modified...|$|E
