He ordered that the number of canons should be increased to 30 and the number of boys in the almonry increased to 16. The Bishop also ordered proper accounts to be kept and forbade the abbot from granting favours without the permission of both the Bishop and the Canons.|$|E

25|$|Identification: Viral vectors {{are often}} given certain genes that help {{identify}} which cells {{took up the}} viral genes. These genes are called Markers. A common marker is antibiotic resistance to a certain antibiotic. The cells can then be isolated easily as those that <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>taken</b> up the viral vector genes do not have antibiotic resistance and so cannot grow in a culture with antibiotics present.|$|E

25|$|Whichever {{method is}} used, the {{introduction}} of recombinant DNA into the chosen host organism is usually a low efficiency process; that is, {{only a small fraction}} of the cells will actually take up DNA. Experimental scientists deal with this issue through a step of artificial genetic selection, in which cells that <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>taken</b> up DNA are selectively killed, and only those cells that can actively replicate DNA containing the selectable marker gene encoded by the vector are able to survive.|$|E

25|$|Most {{social roles}} are not gender-restricted by law, {{though there are}} still {{cultural}} inhibitions surrounding certain roles. More and more women have entered the workplace, and in the year 2000, made up 46.6% of the labor force; up from 18.3% in 1900. Most men, however, <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>taken</b> up the traditional full-time homemaker role; likewise, few men have taken traditionally feminine jobs such as receptionist or nurse (although nursing was traditionally a male role prior to the American Civil War).|$|E
25|$|Many {{remediation}} strategies <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>taken</b> {{into account}} that people with autism suffer from difficulties in learning social rules from examples. Computer-assisted autism therapy has been proposed to teach not simply via examples but to teach the rule along with it. A reasoning rehabilitation strategy, based on playing with a computer based mental simulator {{that is capable of}} modeling mental and emotional states of the real world, has been subject to short-term and long-term evaluations. The simulator performs the reasoning in the framework of belief-desire-intention model. Learning starts from the basic concepts of knowledge and intention and proceeds to more complex communicative actions such as explaining, agreeing, and pretending.|$|E
25|$|A {{critical}} {{phase of}} the cultivation is the quality control of the mycorrhizal plants. It takes between 7 and 10 years for the truffles to develop their mycorrhizal network, and only after that the host-plants come into production. Both a complete soil analysis to avoid contamination by other dominant fungus and a very strict control {{of the formation of}} mycorrhizae are necessary to ensure the success of a plantation. Total investment per hectare for an irrigated and barrier-sealed plantation (against wild boars) can cost up to €10,000. Regarding the level of initial investment and the maturity delay, farmers that <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>taken</b> care of both soil conditions and seedlings conditions are at high risk of failure.|$|E

25|$|On 20 July 2007, Ramush Haradinaj's {{application}} for provisional release {{during the summer}} court recess was denied. He was granted a second exceptional provisional release over the Christmas court recess. The trial chamber rendered its decision on 3 April 2008; not guilty. Defenders of Haradinaj, Balaj and Lahi Brahimaj <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>taken</b> a single witness of the defence to the stand considering that unnecessary. The prosecution was unable {{to bring to the}} courtroom three planned witnesses. One of them was committed to a mental health institution {{at the time he was}} called to testify. Another, Shefqet Kabashi, refused to testify citing the OTP's failure to live up to the conditions set for his testimony. Haradinaj's full acquittal, however, was palled by whispers that witnesses had been intimidated. In fact, during the first trial two witnesses failed to attend and it was feared their evidence could have been determinative to the outcome.|$|E
25|$|The Protocol's first {{commitment}} period started in 2008 {{and ended in}} 2012. A second {{commitment period}} was agreed on in 2012, known as the Doha Amendment to the protocol, in which 37 countries have binding targets: Australia, the European Union (and its 28 member states), Belarus, Iceland, Kazakhstan, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland, and Ukraine. Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine have stated that they may withdraw from the Protocol or not put into legal force the Amendment with second round targets. Japan, New Zealand and Russia have participated in Kyoto's first-round but <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>taken</b> on new targets in the second commitment period. Other developed countries without second-round targets are Canada (which withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol in 2012) and the United States (which has not ratified the Protocol). As of July 2016, 66 states have accepted the Doha Amendment, while entry into force requires the acceptances of 144 states. Of the 37 countries with binding commitments, 7 have ratified.|$|E
