25|$|Singapore imports {{water from}} Johor state in Malaysia through a {{pipeline}} that runs along a 1km bridge, the Johor–Singapore Causeway, that also carries a road and a railway. As of 2009, <b>imported</b> <b>water</b> {{had been reduced}} from 50% previously to 40% of total consumption. After the expiry of a 1961 water agreement between Malaysia and Singapore in 2011, two agreements are in force now. One was signed in 1962 and another one in 2000. Both will expire in 2061. Under the first agreement the price of raw water is set at a very low level of 3 Malaysian sen per , corresponding to about 0,2 US cents per cubic meter.|$|E
25|$|A Parliamentary Commission on Barrack and Hospital Improvements was {{established}} in 1862 to inquire into the sanitary conditions in Gibraltar and other British Mediterranean possessions. Its conclusions were scathing; {{there had been no}} investment in the public water infrastructure in Gibraltar for 150 years, forcing the civilian population to rely entirely on their own resources and ingenuity. The public water storage facilities provided only four to six litres of water per person per day, for all purposes including washing, cooking and drinking – well below the recommended level of nine litres per day. A third of the population did not have access to cisterns or private wells and had to either draw their water from the brackish wells on the isthmus or buy it at exorbitant prices from Spanish water pedlars. One day's supply of six litres of <b>imported</b> <b>water</b> cost as much as a year's supply of water in England. The military, too, was undersupplied, with only seven litres per day for each member of the garrison.|$|E

2500|$|A vast {{system of}} canals, check dams, and {{pipelines}} carry the water {{all over the}} valley, a system which forms the Imperial Irrigation District, or IID. The water distribution system includes over [...] of canal and with [...] of pipeline. The number of canal and pipeline branches number roughly over a hundred. <b>Imported</b> <b>water</b> and a long growing season allow two crop cycles each year, and the Imperial Valley is {{a major source of}} winter fruits and vegetables, cotton, and grain for U.S. and international markets. Alfalfa is another major crop produced in the Imperial Valley. The agricultural lands are served by a constructed agricultural drain system, which conveys surface runoff and subsurface drainage from fields to the Salton Sea, which is a designated repository for agricultural runoff, with environmental considerations not yet solved.|$|E
2500|$|From 1939, the base's {{water was}} {{supplied}} by pipelines that drew {{water from the}} Yateras River about [...] northeast of the base. The U.S. government paid a fee for this; in 1964, it was about $14,000 a month for about [...] per day. In 1964, the Cuban government stopped the flow. The base had about [...] of water in storage, and strict water conservation was put into effect immediately. The U.S. first <b>imported</b> <b>water</b> from Jamaica by barge, then relocated a desalination plant from San Diego (Point Loma). When the Cuban government accused the United States of stealing water, base commander John D. Bulkeley ordered that the pipelines be cut and a section removed. A [...] length of the [...] diameter pipe and a [...] length of the [...] diameter pipe were lifted {{from the ground and}} the openings sealed.|$|E
2500|$|Newly {{discovered}} {{records show}} that Middleton Place <b>imported</b> <b>water</b> buffalo from Constantinople in the late 18th century, {{the first in the}} United States. They were [...] experimental draft animals, suited to the deep muck in which rice was grown. In the gardens, Arthur's son Henry Middleton's friendship with French botanist André Michaux resulted in the first camellias grown in an American garden, a house gift during Michaux's visit in 1786. Three of the four planted at the corners of the main parterre survive, grown to fifteen feet: One is Camellia japonica [...] "reine des fleurs"; the other is an ancestor of the modern cultivar Charles Sprague Sargent. The second Henry Middleton expanded and enriched the gardens, introducing the garden's first Asiatic azalea (Rhododendron indica), and the crape myrtle ( [...] Lagerstroemia indica), one of the oldest in America. He also filled greenhouses with exotics and imported plants and seeds to give antebellum Middleton Place something of the air of a botanical garden.|$|E
25|$|Pursuant Oslo II (Annex III, Article 40.7), Israel {{committed}} {{itself to}} sell 5 mcm/year to the Gaza Strip. On 2015 Israel had doubled the amount to 10 mcm/year. Gaza also <b>imports</b> <b>water,</b> or produces drinkwater by means of desalination plants.|$|R
50|$|Desalination was {{a source}} of water in Hong Kong between 1975 and 1981. A large {{desalination}} plant was commissioned in Lok on Pai in 1975, but was decommissioned again in 1981 because its operation was more expensive than <b>importing</b> <b>water</b> from Dongjiang.|$|R
50|$|Libya {{is working}} on a network of <b>water</b> {{pipelines}} to <b>import</b> <b>water,</b> called the Great Manmade River. It carries water from wells tapping fossil water in the Sahara desert to the cities of Tripoli, Benghazi, Sirte and others. Their water also comes from desalination plants.|$|R
60|$|We plowed {{and dragged}} and groped along, the whole live-long night, {{and at the}} end of this uncomfortable twelve hours we {{finished}} the forty-five-mile part of the desert and got to the stage station where the <b>imported</b> <b>water</b> was. The sun was just rising. It was easy enough to cross a desert in the night while we were asleep; and it was pleasant to reflect, in the morning, that we in actual person had encountered an absolute desert and could always speak knowingly of deserts in presence of the ignorant thenceforward. And it was pleasant also to reflect that this was not an obscure, back country desert, but a very celebrated one, the metropolis itself, as you may say. All this was very well and very comfortable and satisfactory--but now we were to cross a desert in daylight. This was fine--novel--romantic--dramatically adventurous --this, indeed, was worth living for, worth traveling for! We would write home all about it.|$|E

50|$|EMWD {{receives}} {{its water}} supplies from {{a mix of}} local and imported sources. It's <b>imported</b> <b>water</b> is purchased through the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, which includes the State Water Project and Colorado River Aqueduct as primary sources. As of 2015, <b>imported</b> <b>water</b> accounts for 51 percent of EMWD's overall water supply portfolio.|$|E
50|$|Access to {{dependable}} {{and clean}} drinking water remains {{a major issue}} {{for the majority of}} cities within Azerbaijan. In particular, the Absheron peninsula lacks a source of potable water, as its groundwater is contaminated and polluted. Azerbaijan <b>imports</b> bottled drinking <b>water</b> from other nations such as Iran, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates, but the country actually has enough domestic water sources to avoid <b>importing</b> <b>water,</b> according to Parviz Moin, an Iranian fluid dynamicist.|$|R
40|$|We couple a particle-based {{transport}} {{model with a}} grid-based hydrodynamic model to study the large-scale horizontal mixing of artificially supplied water into a shallow lake. Unsteady wind-induced circulations stretch the plume and fold it into filamental patterns, whereas oscillation due to the seiche is the more effective mechanism to transport the <b>imported</b> <b>waters</b> through channels that connect the bays of the lake...|$|R
50|$|The Villa Petrolea park had {{an area of}} 10.5 {{hectares}} {{and designed}} by landscape architects from Poland. The oil-saturated earth was covered by fertile soil shipped from Lankaran, the subtropical part of Azerbaijan. The problem of fresh water was solved by constantly <b>importing</b> <b>water</b> from the Volga on ships travelling from Astrakhan which used it as ballast instead of sacks of sand.|$|R

5000|$|In 1960 Hong Kong began <b>importing</b> <b>water</b> {{from outside}} its borders through the Dongjiang - Shenzhen (Dongshen) Water Supply Scheme. After many {{extensions}} and upgrades {{the current system}} consists of a pipeline from Qiaotou Town of Dongguan to a reservoir in Shenzhen next to Hong Kong. <b>Water</b> <b>imports</b> from the Pearl River have increased gradually from 23 million cubic meters per year (under a 1960 agreement) to 1100 million cubic meters per year (under a fifth agreement signed in 1989). <b>Water</b> <b>imports</b> thus {{played a crucial role}} in alleviating Hong Kong's water crisis, accounting for 70 percent of the territory's water supply in 1991. The People's Republic of China has never exercised the [...] "water weapon" [...] in its relationship with Hong Kong. China needed foreign exchange and between 1979 and 1991 alone Hong Kong paid China almost 4 billion Hong Kong Dollars (about US$500 million applying the 1991 exchange rate) for <b>water</b> <b>imports.</b>|$|R
40|$|For {{the past}} few years, water stress has been {{accelerated}} world widely but with more severity in the Middle East North African region (MENA). Simultaneously, the economic boom of countries like Morocco has triggered a faster water demand that more likely will not be coped with the resources {{that the country has}} within their boundaries and for this reason to <b>import</b> <b>water</b> is an imperative necessity. ...|$|R

50|$|Before {{approaching}} Palm Springs, the Whitewater River is fed <b>imported</b> <b>water</b> {{from the}} Colorado River Aqueduct, {{managed by the}} Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. During rare floods, surface water may reach the endorheic basin of the Salton Sea, below sea level.|$|E
50|$|If a customer's water usage exceeds his or {{her monthly}} allocation, their cost of water will {{increase}} due {{to the need for}} IRWD to purchase more expensive sources of water, such as <b>imported</b> <b>water</b> from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California.|$|E
50|$|In 2003 and 2005, the PUB {{launched}} the NEWater {{project and the}} desalinated water treatment project respectively. This further diversifies the water supply in Singapore to four main sources: local catchment water, <b>imported</b> <b>water,</b> NEWater and desalinated water. They form the Four National Taps.|$|E
5000|$|While McCarthy's {{administration}} was largely scandal-free, it {{suffered from a}} number of political failures, including the contentious effort to <b>import</b> <b>water</b> from the Hetch-Hetchy dam in Yosemite to San Francisco. Reform-minded businessmen chose James Rolph, Jr., known as [...] "Sunny Jim", to run against him. Rolph won and the ULP faded from the scene. McCarthy returned to the Republican Party, serving as a delegate to Republican National Convention in 1920.|$|R
50|$|The cost {{of water}} from the plant will be $100 to $200 more per {{acre-foot}} than recycled water, $1,000 to $1,100 more than reservoir water, but $100 to $200 less than <b>importing</b> <b>water</b> from outside the county. As of April 2015, San Diego County imports 90% of its water. A conglomerate of California-based environmentalist groups, the Desal Response Group, claims that the plant will cost San Diego County $108 million a year.|$|R
5000|$|The town of Daule can get {{its water}} from four major sources: {{the water in}} front of the town, <b>imported</b> bottled <b>water,</b> a nearby river, and a well that is beside the church. The water {{in front of the}} town {{essentially}} comes from the Pacific Ocean. <b>Imported</b> bottled <b>water</b> is an expensive alternative. The water from a nearby river still costs money for transportation. Water from the church well is free but contains a lot of salt.|$|R

50|$|The {{formation}} of CCWD {{was a direct}} result of a 13-year drought that began in California about 1917 and caused a great increase of salinity in Sacramento Delta as ocean water intruded ad mixed with greatly reduced flow of fresh water from inland runoff. Fresh water for industrial use had to be brought in from elsewhere in railroad tank cars. Farmers could not afford the expense of <b>importing</b> <b>water,</b> and had to stop irrigating crops, which caused the value of land to decline.|$|R
50|$|In 2013, the City of San Diego, {{located in}} Southern California, {{demonstrated}} {{the feasibility of}} using technology to recycle most of their wastewater for reuse by the year 2035, to decrease costs of <b>importing</b> <b>water.</b> This project, Pure Water San Diego, hopes to build facilities throughout the county to treat wastewater to provide for sustainable, safe potable water for one-third of the population. As of 2011, {{the city has been}} purifying millions of gallons of water and giving demonstrations to the public upon request.|$|R
5|$|Providing an {{adequate}} water supply for Hong Kong {{has always been}} difficult because the region has few natural lakes and rivers, inadequate groundwater sources (inaccessible in most cases due to the hard granite bedrock found in most areas in the territory), a high population density, and extreme seasonable variations in rainfall. Thus about 70 percent of water demand is met by <b>importing</b> <b>water</b> from the Dongjiang River in neighbouring Guangdong province. In addition, freshwater demand is curtailed {{by the use of}} seawater for toilet flushing, using a separate distribution system.|$|R
