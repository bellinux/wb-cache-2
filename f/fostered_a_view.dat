40|$|The {{second volume}} of Annals of Cultural Psychology is {{dedicated}} to the affective nature of human social relationships with the environment. The chapters here included explore the historical, theoretical and practical dimensions of the concept of affectivating originally in-troduced by one of us (Valsiner, 1999), as a potential tool of inquiry into the affective-sensitive dimension of psychological life within a cultural-psychological framework. Why this new term? And why dedicate a whole volume of the Annals to contributions that, in one way or another—use the term for some theoretical purposes? The slightly awkward notion of affectivating brings the affective dimension of the human experience into the centre of the scope of cultural Psychologies, which have usually focused on the social side of human experiencing.

Drawing on narrative data from a naturalistic study of nine Australian occupational therapy students’ fieldwork experiences in psychiatric hospital settings, this paper explores the role of people with psychiatric disorders in facilitating students’ learning. Two terms are used by the authors to represent students’ understanding of these people for educational purposes, namely, as learning resources and as demonstration models. From students’ narratives, examples of the attributes they sought to acquire and demonstrate through involvement with people with psychiatric disorders are discussed.

Starting with Virilio 2 ̆ 7 s critique of technology, speed, and de-territorialization, this article discusses the ways in which mass support is mobilized by the state in conventional pursuit of geopolitical objectives. Drawing on  contemporary international relations theory, the authors introduce the concept of "securitization" and discuss how war coverage in cyberspace has been used to securitize international threats, such as "global terrorism," to justify state intervention, including war. It is concluded that one of the paradoxes of war coverage in cyberspace is that whereas cyber-technologies should democratize the politics of war by liberating access to information about war, the state has coopted information and communication technologies to facilitate new forms of mass mobilization for war itself. <br /...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{the concept}} of {{flexicurity}} has come to occupy a central place in political and academic debates regarding employment and social policy. It <b>fosters</b> <b>a</b> <b>view</b> in which the need for continuously increasing flexibility is the basic assumption, and the understanding of security increasingly moves from social protection to self-insurance or individual adaptability. Moreover, it rejects the traditional contradictions between flexibility and security, blending the two into a single notion and thus depoliticizing the relationships between capital and labour. This volume provides a critical discussion of the flexicurity concept, the theories upon which it is built and the ideas that it transmits about work, unemployment and social justice. It shows that flexicurity fosters the further individualization of social protection, an increase in precariousness and the further weakening of labour in relation to capital. The authors present a series of alternative theoretical, normative and policy approaches that provide due attention to the collective and political dimension of vulnerability and allow {{for the development of}} new societal projects based on alternative values and assumptions...|$|R

500|$|Much of {{the music}} Tippett {{composed}} following the opera's completion reflected its lyrical style. Among these works was the Fantasia Concertante on a Theme of Corelli (1953) for string orchestra, written to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the composer Arcangelo Corelli's [...] birth. The Fantasia would eventually become one of Tippett's most popular works, though The Timess critic lamented the [...] "excessive complexity of the contrapuntal writing... {{there was so much}} going on that the perplexed ear knew not where to turn or fasten itself". Such comments helped to <b>foster</b> <b>a</b> <b>view</b> that Tippett was a [...] "difficult" [...] composer, or even that his music was amateurish and poorly prepared. These perceptions were strengthened by controversies around several of his works in the late 1950s. The Piano Concerto (1955) was declared unplayable by its scheduled soloist, Julius Katchen, who had to be replaced before the première by Louis Kentner. The Dennis Brain Wind Ensemble, for whom Tippett had written the Sonata for Four Horns (1955), complained that the work was in too high a key and required it to be transposed down. When the Second Symphony was premièred by the BBC Symphony Orchestra under Boult, in a live broadcast from the Royal Festival Hall on 5 February 1958, the work broke down after a few minutes and had to be restarted by the apologetic conductor: [...] "Entirely my mistake, ladies and gentlemen". The BBC's Controller of Music defended the orchestra in The Times, writing that it [...] "is equal to all reasonable demands", a wording that implied the fault was the composer's.|$|R

40|$|Systemic Practice and Action Research (SPAR) denotes {{a family}} of {{approaches}} with different theoretical foundations, the constructive encounter between which may propel the movement forward. A persistent scholarly debate persists between the so-called emancipatory and pragmatic strands, motivating perceptions of the impossibility to jointly accomplish both ‘dialogical’ and ‘revolutionary’ commitments of the movement.

The task is aimed at favouring the development of predictive and interpretative thinking by teachers as to pupils’ behaviour.

40|$|Is it {{sufficient}} {{to analyze and}} study partnerships within a “business as usual” framework?

The current structural crisis confirms the unsustainability of this perspective. If we really want to unleash the full potential of partnerships to foster the common good and contribute to change the course we need completely different theoretical foundations. Therefore, in this Chapter we advance an alternative approach, framed around a collaborative attitude of doing business, where economic agents care about others and themselves and aim to create values for all the participants in their business ecosystems. The “collaborative enterprise” has important implications for academia and business. In particular, this perspective allows scholars and practitioners to reinvent partnerships beyond reductionist and instrumental approaches to make them a transformative agent of change...|$|R

To allow for a correct business activity execution, well-defined choreography of, and coordination between, participating Services is necessary.

40|$|The United Kingdom’s Children Act 1989 {{provides}} that unaccompanied children claiming asylum in the UK are looked after {{by the local}} authority in whose area they first come to attention of the authorities. Unlike adults, they were not subject to dispersal {{to other parts of}} the country under the Asylum and Immigration Act 1999. This has created an uneven pattern of asylum-seeker children across the country, who have no choice in where they live and are concentrated in a few geographical areas, typically near ports and administrative hubs. That, in turn, has produced unmitigated pressure on local services while <b>fostering</b> <b>a</b> <b>view</b> in other areas that the children are someone else’s ‘problem’ rather than a shared responsibility for the country. This article maps the distribution of unaccompanied children in England (Different laws apply in Scotland). It considers the effects of this geographical concentration on the care of children, based on qualitative interviews with unaccompanied children and young people and adults working with them. These interviews are analysed through the lens of the requirement in the United Nations’ Convention on the Rights of the Child that States must act in the best interests of the child. The support structure around each child is conceptualized as the ‘holding environment’ in which they live and develop, drawing on an idea developed by the British psychologist Donald Winnicott. It is argued that neither children’s legal rights, nor their best interests, are best served by living in areas of high concentration. However, the article also criticizes the language of ‘dispersal’ and ‘burden sharing’ in the wider debate on refugee reception. Finally, it analyses responsibility-sharing models from France and Austria and a similar model operating between different boroughs in London, concluding that the laws and practices which exist do not fully comply with the ‘best interests’ principle, often because of a failure to properly fund transfer and care arrangements...|$|R
