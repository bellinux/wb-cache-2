30|$|Second, and {{a related}} issue, {{it has been}} known for some time that {{analyses}} based on individual differences do not always converge with analyses based on group data. An open question is how to address this issue in the context of evaluating a screening test. If correlation testing or ANOVA are used as the main analysis method in a study, the conclusions will be based on comparisons that are made against chance performance. If other methods are to be used, the conclusions made from group and <b>individual</b> <b>data</b> will align if criteria for results are set at the outset. For example, if above-chance results are deemed acceptable for the task at hand, group data {{can be used to make}} conclusions, and <b>individual</b> <b>data</b> used to <b>support</b> a deeper understanding of the results. Alternatively, if stricter criteria are implemented, and if the group and <b>individual</b> <b>data</b> contradict one another, then the <b>individual</b> <b>data</b> and regression analysis must inform conclusions.

We aimed to derive updated NTCP model parameters using published data and prospective radiotherapy quality-assured cohort data. Material and methods A systematic search identified publications providing duodenum dose-volume histogram (DVH) statistics for clinical studies of conventionally-fractionated radiotherapy. Values for the Lyman-Kutcher-Burman (LKB) NTCP model were derived through sum-squared-error minimisation and using leave-one-out cross-validation. Data were corrected for fraction size and weighted according to patient numbers, {{and the model}} refined using <b>individual</b> patient DVH <b>data</b> for two further cohorts from prospective clinical trials. Results Six studies with published DVH data were utilised, and with <b>individual</b> patient <b>data</b> included outcomes for 531 patients in total (median follow-up 16 months). Observed gastro-intestinal toxicity rates ranged from 0 % to 14 % (median 8 %). LKB parameter values for unconstrained fit to published data were: n = 0. 070, m = 0. 46, TD 50 (1) [Gy] = 183. 8, while the values for the model incorporating the <b>individual</b> patient <b>data</b> were n = 0. 193, m = 0. 51, TD 50 (1) [Gy] = 299. 1.

40|$|Eusocial species exhibit {{pronounced}} {{division of}} labor, most notably between reproductive and non-reproductive castes, but also within non-reproductive castes via morphological specialization and temporal polyethism. For species with distinct worker and queen castes, age-related differences in behavior among workers (e. g. within-nest tasks versus foraging) appear {{to result from}} physiological changes such as decreased lipid content. However, we know little about how labor is divided among individuals in species that lack a distinct queen caste. In this study, we investigated how fat storage varied among individuals in a species of ant (Dinoponera australis) that lacks a distinct queen caste and in which all individuals are morphologically similar and capable of reproduction (totipotent at birth). We distinguish between two hypotheses, 1) all individuals are physiologically similar, consistent with the possibility that any non-reproductive may eventually become reproductive, and 2) non-reproductive individuals vary in stored fat, similar to highly eusocial species, where depletion is associated with foraging and non-reproductives have lower lipid stores than reproducing <b>individuals.</b> Our <b>data</b> <b>support</b> the latter hypothesis.

40|$|Economic theory makes three {{predictions}} about consumption and response output in a choice situation: (a) When plotted on logarithmic coordinates, total consumption (i. e., summed across concurrent sources of reinforcement) {{should be a}} positively decelerating function, and total response output should be a bitonic function of unit price increases; (b) total consumption and response output should {{be determined by the}} value of the unit price ratio, independent of its cost and benefit components; and (c) when a reinforcer is available at the same unit price across all sources of reinforcement, consumption should be equal between these sources. These predictions were assessed in human cigarette smokers who earned cigarette puffs in a two-choice situation at a range of unit prices. In some sessions, smokers chose between different amounts of puffs, both available at identical unit prices. <b>Individual</b> subjects' <b>data</b> <b>supported</b> the first two predictions but failed to support the third.

40|$|This paper {{claims that}} {{technical}} progress induces early retirement of older workers. Technical progress erodes some existing technology specific human capital. Since older workers have shorter career horizons, there is smaller incentive for them or for their employers {{to invest in}} learning {{how to use the}} new technology. Consequently, {{they are more likely to}} stop working. Using <b>individual</b> <b>data,</b> we find <b>support</b> for this erosion effect, as early retirement is positively correlated to the sector’s rate of technical progress. At the aggregate level, the effect of technical progress on labor supply of older workers is mixed. It falls in innovating sectors due to the above erosion effect, but it increases in other sectors due to higher wages. This is the wage effect.

This study provides a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of Cephalopoda (Mollusca) using a combination of molecular and morphological data. Four loci (three nuclear 18 S rRNA, fragments of 28 S rRNA and histone H 3 and one mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I) were combined with 101 morphological characters to test the relationships of 60 species of cephalopods, with emphasis within Decabrachia (squids and cuttlefishes). <b>Individual</b> and combined <b>data</b> sets were analyzed using the direct optimization method, with parsimony as the optimality criterion. Analyses were repeated for 12 different parameter sets accounting for a range of indel ⁄ change and transversion ⁄ transition cost ratios. Most analyses support the monophyly of Cephalopoda, Nautiloidea, Coleoidea and Decabrachia, however, the monophyly of Octobrachia was refuted due to the lack of support for a Cirroctopoda + Octopoda group. When analyzing all molecular evidence in combination and for total evidence analyses, Vampyromorpha formed the sister group to Decabrachia under the majority of parameters, while morphological <b>data</b> and some <b>individual</b> <b>data</b> sets <b>supported</b> a sister relationship between Vampyromorpha and Octobrachia.

40|$|The {{molecular}} {{and metal}} profile fingerprints {{were obtained from}} a complex substance, Atractylis chinensis DC—a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), {{with the use of}} the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) techniques. This substance was used in this work as an example of a complex biological material, which has found application as a TCM. Such TCM samples are traditionally processed by the Bran, Cut, Fried and Swill methods, and were collected from five provinces in China. The data matrices obtained from the two types of analysis produced two principal component biplots, which showed that the HPLC fingerprint data were discriminated on the basis of the methods for processing the raw TCM, while the metal analysis grouped according to the geographical origin. When the two data matrices were combined into a one two-way matrix, the resulting biplot showed a clear separation on the basis of the HPLC fingerprints. Importantly, within each different grouping the objects separated according to their geographical origin, and they ranked approximately in the same order in each group. This result suggested that by using such an approach, it is possible to derive improved characterisation of the complex TCM materials on the basis of the two kinds of analytical data. In addition, two supervised pattern recognition methods, K-nearest neighbors (KNNs) method, and linear discriminant analysis (LDA), were successfully applied to the <b>individual</b> <b>data</b> matrices—thus, <b>supporting</b> the PCA approach...|$|R
40|$|Infection with Schistosoma mansoni induces humoral and T cell {{mediated}} responses {{and leads to}} delayed hipersensitivity that results in granulomatous inflamatory disease around the parasite eggs. Regulation of these responses resulting in a reduction in this anti-egg inflamatory disease is appsrently determined by idiotypic repertoires of the patient, associated with genetic background and multiple external factors. We have previously reported on idiotype/anti-idiotype-receptor transactions in clinical human schistosomiasis. These findings support a hypothesis that anti-SEA cross-reactive idiotypes develop in some patients {{during the course of}} a chronic infection and participate in regulation of anti-SEA cellular immune responses. We repport here on experiments wich extend those observations to the regulation of granulomatous hypersensitivity measured by an in vitro granuloma model. T cells from chronic intestinal schistosomiasis patients were stimulated in vitro with anti-SEA idiotypes and assayed in an autologous in vitro granuloma assay for modulation of granuloma formation. These anti-SEA idiotype reactive T cells were capable of regulating autologous in vitro granuloma formation. This regulatory activity, initiated with stimulatory anti-SEA idiotypic antibodies, was antigenically specific and was dependent on the present of intact (F(ab') 2 immunoglobulin molecules. The ability to elicit this regulatory activity appears to be dose dependent and is more easily demonstrated in chronically infected intestinal patients or SEA sensitized <b>individuals.</b> These <b>data</b> <b>support</b> the hypothesis that anti-SEA cross reactive idiotypes are important in regulating granulomatous hypersensitivy in chronic intestinal schistosomiasis patients and these cross-reactive idiotypes appear to play a major role in cell-cell interactions which result in the regulation of anti-SEA cellular immune responses...|$|R
40|$|Malosma laurina is a {{dominant}} species in coastal chaparral ecosystems The deep root systems of M. laurina provide structural {{support for the}} steep Santa Monica Mountains and allow M. laurina {{to tap into the}} deep water table. M. laurina dieback is prevalent in coastal exposures of the SMM, presumably due to historic drought predisposing plant tissues to infection by the fungal pathogen Botryosphaeria dothidea. In ecosystems that experience annual dry periods, a high hydraulic conductance in roots is necessary to provide plants with sufficient water. A recent study has examined the effect of Botryosphaeria on the hydraulic conductance of M. laurina stems, but no research has been performed on the roots. This study looks at the effect of Botryosphaeria on the root system of infected M. laurina plants. Our focus was on the roots’ ability to transport water to the shoot and the presence of physical blockage in the xylem vessels. We collected root samples of both plants experiencing severe dieback as well as healthy plants and tested the hydraulic conductivity (Kh) through each root. We then calculated the specific conductivity per unit xylem area (Ks). We found significantly lower Ks in infected plants than in the healthy M. laurina. After testing hydraulic conductivity, we calculated the percent air embolism and physical blockage in the vessels using double-staining. Preliminary double-staining data has corroborated our hydraulic conductance data, indicating increased physical blockage in the vessels of dieback <b>individuals.</b> These <b>data</b> <b>support</b> the hypothesis that infection by Botryosphaeria greatly reduces water transport function in the roots of Malosma laurina...|$|R

The current study {{examined the effects of}} insulin and/or exercise on glucose transport and phosphorylation in skeletal muscle and the influence of obesity on these processes. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Seven obese and 12 lean men underwent positron emission tomography with 2 -deoxy- 2 -[(18) F]fluoro-d-glucose in resting and isometrically exercising skeletal muscle during normoglycemic hyperinsulinemia. Data were analyzed by two-tissue compartmental modeling. Perfusion and oxidative capacity were measured during insulin stimulation by [15 O]H 2 O and [15 O]O 2. RESULTS: Exercise increased glucose fractional uptake (K), inward transport rate (K(1)), and the k(3) parameter, combining transport and intracellular phosphorylation, in lean and obese subjects. In each group, there was no statistically significant difference between plasma flow and K(1). At rest, a significant defect in K(1) (P = 0. 0016), k(3) (P = 0. 016), and K (P = 0. 022) was found in obese subjects. Exercise restored K(1), improved but did not normalize K (P = 0. 03 vs. lean), and did not ameliorate the more than 60 % relative impairment in k(3) in obese individuals (P = 0. 002 vs. lean). The glucose oxidative potential tended to be reduced by obesity. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The study indicates that exercise restores the impairment in insulin-mediated skeletal muscle perfusion and glucose delivery associated with obesity but does not normalize the defect involving the proximal steps regulating glucose disposal in obese <b>individuals.</b> Our <b>data</b> <b>support</b> the use of 2 -deoxy- 2 -[18 F]fluoro-d-glucose-positron emission tomography in the dissection between substrate supply and intrinsic tissue metabolism...|$|R
40|$|MukB is a {{bacterial}} SMC(structural maintenance of chromosome) protein required for correct folding of the Escherichia coli chromosome. MukB acts in complex {{with the two}} non-SMC proteins, MukE and MukF. The role of MukEF is unclear. MukEF disrupts MukB-DNA interactions in vitro. In vivo, however, MukEF stimulates MukB-induced DNA condensation and {{is required for the}} assembly of MukB clusters at the quarter positions of the cell length. We report here that MukEF is essential for stable association of MukB with the chromosome. We found that MukBEF forms a stable complex with the chromosome that copurifies with nucleoids following gentle cell lysis. Little MukB could be found with the nucleoids in the absence or upon overproduction of MukEF. Similarly, overproduced MukEF recruited MukB-green fluorescent protein (GFP) from its quarter positions, indicating that formation of MukB-GFP clusters and stable association with the chromosome could be mechanistically related. Finally, we report that MukE-GFP forms foci at the quarter positions of the cell length but not in cells that lack MukB or overproduce MukEF, suggesting that the clusters are formed by MukBEF and not by its <b>individual</b> subunits.

Two types of heteroplasmy were observed, one involving a major length polymorphism and the other a single restriction site. Shad mtDNA occurred in two principal size classes, 18. 3 and 19. 8 kb. Of 244 shad examined, 30 were heteroplasmic and carried both size classes of mtDNA in varying proportions; the remainder were homoplasmic for the smaller size class of mtDNA. The large mtDNA variant occurred most frequently {{at the southern end of}} the range, and except for two individuals from Nova Scotia, was not detected among shad from rivers north of the Delaware. In contrast, ten shad heteroplasmic for a SalI restriction site originated from rivers ranging from South Carolina to Nova Scotia. DNA mapping and hybridization experiments indicated that the length polymorphism is in the D-loop-containing region and consists of a tandemly repeated 1. 5 -kb DNA sequence occurring in two and three copies, respectively, in the two major size classes of shad mtDNA.

To achieve this goal the first step is the creation of a life-long Electronic Health Record (EHR) and Electronic Medical Record (EMR) which allows integration of the <b>individual’s</b> <b>data</b> with decision <b>support</b> system in the form of alerts, reminders, suggestions and constraints against erroneous decisions, thereby ensuring optimal care. Unlike paper-based medical records in which a lot of information remains buried unexplored, EMRs lend themselves to “data mining ” which can lead to the discovery of new knowledge such as genetically inherited diseases and gene-drug interactions. Computerized prescriptions will eliminate many hazards of hand written prescriptions and will make drug treatment safer for the patients. By combining drug indication data (automatically recorded when the prescription is generated), adverse drug effect data, usage patterns and reasons for stoppage of drugs (problems solved/failure to achieve result/adverse reactions / availability of better drug) a valuable data base is created for pharmacovigilance. Patient education is the most neglected aspect of current clinical practice. EMR can be integrated with e-mail and web-based information resources for patient education and teaching self-management of chronic illnesses such as diabetes, hypertension, asthma-COPD and arthritis, which accomplish more effective care at much reduced cost.
