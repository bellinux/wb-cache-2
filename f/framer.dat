40|$|Originalist {{analyses}} of the <b>Framers</b> 2 ̆ 7 views about governmental search power have devoted insufficient attention to the civil search statutes they promulgated for regulatory purposes. What {{attention has been paid}} concludes that the <b>Framers</b> were divided about how accessible search remedies should be. This Article explains why this conventional account is mostly wrong and explores the lessons to be learned from the statutory choices the <b>Framers</b> made with regard to search and seizure law. In enacting civil search statutes, the <b>Framers</b> chose to depart from common law standards and instead largely followed the patterns of preceding British civil search statutes. The overwhelming tendency was to link official immunity with probable cause and displace the jury by reserving the issue for federal judges. These choices are surprising because such provisions had been highly contested in the colonies when the British had implemented them. The <b>Framers</b> also promulgated a plethora of other procedural devices that limited access to search remedies. For these reasons, and because probable cause was a poorly understood concept at the time, the <b>Framers</b> 2 ̆ 7 choices show that, once in power, the <b>Framers</b> became more interested in protecting governmental search power than in limiting it...|$|R

We can infer from the history surrounding the Fourth Amendment what the <b>Framers</b> hoped it would accomplish in their time.

40|$|Professor Robert Kaczorowski {{argues for}} an {{expansive}} originalist interpretation of Congressional power under the Fourteenth Amendment. Before the Civil War Congress actually exercised, and the Supreme Court repeatedly upheld plenary Congressional power {{to enforce the}} constitutional rights of slaveholders. After the Civil War, the <b>framers</b> of the Fourteenth Amendment copied the antebellum statutes and exercised plenary power to enforce the constitutional rights of all American citizens when they enacted the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and then incorporated the Act into the Fourteenth Amendment. The <b>framers</b> of the Fourteenth Amendment thereby exercised the plenary power the Rehnquist Court claims the <b>framers</b> intended to exclude from Congress. The <b>framers</b> also adopted the remedies to redress violations of substantive constitutional rights the Court says the <b>framers</b> intended to reserve exclusively to the states. The Rehnquist Court 2 ̆ 7 s Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence, contradicted by this history, is thus ripe for reevaluation...|$|R
25|$|Rep. John Bingham, the {{principal}} <b>framer</b> of the Fourteenth Amendment, advocated that the Fourteenth applied {{the first eight}} Amendments of the Bill of Rights to the States. The U.S. Supreme Court subsequently declined to interpret it that way, despite the dissenting argument in the 1947 case of Adamson v. California by Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black that the framers' intent should control the Court's interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment (he included a lengthy appendix that quoted extensively from Bingham's congressional testimony). Although the Adamson Court declined to adopt Black's interpretation, the Court during the following twenty-five years employed a doctrine of selective incorporation that succeeded in extending to the States {{almost all of the}} protections in the Bill of Rights, as well as other, unenumerated rights. The Bill of Rights thus imposes legal limits on the powers of governments and acts as an anti-majoritarian/minoritarian safeguard by providing deeply entrenched legal protection for various civil liberties and fundamental rights. The Supreme Court for example concluded in the West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette (1943) case that the founders intended the Bill of Rights to put some rights out of reach from majorities, ensuring that some liberties would endure beyond political majorities. As the Court noted the idea of the Bill of Rights “was to withdraw certain subjects from the vicissitudes of political controversy, to place them beyond the reach of majorities and officials and to establish them as legal principles to be applied by the courts.” This is why “fundamental rights may not be submitted to a vote; they depend on the outcome of no elections.” The 14th Amendment has vastly expanded civil rights protections and is cited in more litigation than any other amendment to the U.S. Constitution.|$|E

40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{determine}} to what extent there was congruence between the thinking of the <b>framers</b> of the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program (MPCP) between 1989 and 1991, and the parents participating in the program today.

(2) From the <b>framers</b> 2 ̆ 7 perspectives, how has the program changed or developed in relation to their original thoughts? (3) How has the thinking of the <b>framers</b> changed over time?

40|$|As {{early as}} 1793, Congress {{exercised}} plenary legislative power and enacted statutes that enforced the constitutionally secured property rights of slaveholders in their slaves with civil remedies, including a civil fine and tort damages, and criminal penalties {{and made them}} applicable to anyone who interfered with the slave owner’s constitutional right to recover fugitive slaves. Congress also created an elaborate federal enforcement structure. The United States Supreme Court repeatedly upheld {{the constitutionality of the}}se statutes and Congress 2 ̆ 7 s plenary power to enact them. After the Civil War, the <b>framers</b> of the Fourteenth Amendment used these legislative and judicial precedents to insist that Congress possessed as much legislative power to enforce the constitutional rights of all Americans that earlier Congresses had exercised to enforce the constitutional rights of slaveholders. This article shows that, acting on this view, the <b>framers</b> of the Fourteenth Amendment actually exercised plenary legislative power when they enacted the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which they modeled on the antebellum legislation by incorporating their civil and criminal remedies and enforcement provisions. The article also shows that, to ensure the constitutionality of the Civil Rights Act and to protect it from being repealed by a future Congress, the <b>framers</b> explicitly incorporated it into the Fourteenth Amendment. The <b>framers</b> of the Fourteenth Amendment thereby exercised the power to define and enforce substantive constitutional rights the Rehnquist Court claims the <b>framers</b> intended to exclude from Congress. The <b>framers</b> adopted the remedies to redress violations of substantive constitutional rights the Court says the <b>framers</b> intended to reserve exclusively to the states. And, they expressly intended the Fourteenth Amendment to delegate to Congress the constitutional authority they had just exercised to define and enforce substantive constitutional rights, to define civil and criminal violations of constitutional rights, and to provide civil and criminal remedies to redress their violation.
