5|$|Some species, {{such as the}} gregarious German cockroach, have an {{elaborate}} social structure involving common shelter, social dependence, information transfer and kin recognition. Cockroaches have appeared in human culture since classical antiquity. They are popularly depicted as dirty pests, though the <b>great</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> species are inoffensive and live {{in a wide range}} of habitats around the world.|$|E
5|$|The <b>great</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> {{the art in}} {{and around}} the Houses of Parliament is of British origin, due to a policy of {{acquiring}} British art for the building. Marochetti's statue thus represents one of the few examples of a non-British artist's work being selected for the Parliamentary estate.|$|E

5|$|The living {{members of}} the Diplopoda are divided into sixteen orders in two {{subclass}}es. The basal subclass Penicillata contains a single order, Polyxenida (bristle millipedes). All other millipedes belong to the subclass Chilognatha consisting of two infraclasses: Pentazonia, containing the short-bodied pill millipedes, and Helminthomorpha (worm-like millipedes), containing the <b>great</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> the species.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from his}} own disciples and followers, the Jews of Jesus' day {{generally}} rejected him as the Messiah, as do the <b>great</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> Jews today. Christian theologians, ecumenical councils, reformers and others have written extensively about Jesus over the centuries. Christian sects and schisms have often been defined or characterized by their descriptions of Jesus. Meanwhile, Manichaeans, Gnostics, Muslims, Baha'is, and others have found prominent places for Jesus in their religions. Jesus has also had detractors, both past and present.|$|E
5|$|I {{have come}} to {{know that there is a}} real {{difference}} between the regular German soldier and officer and Hitler and his criminal group. For my part, I do not believe that the German soldier as such has lost his honor. The fact that certain individuals committed in war dishonorable and despicable acts reflects on the individuals concerned and not on the <b>great</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> German soldiers and officers.|$|E

50|$|The {{constituency}} {{was created}} in 1997 by the merger of {{the whole of the}} former seat of Greenwich and the western half of the former seat of Woolwich. It has been won since 1997 by a Labour candidate, whose <b>greatest</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> the votes cast 44.8% in 1997. The 2010 general election produced the slimmest <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> 24.7% of the vote.|$|R
5|$|One of {{the strongest}} bases of anti-Communist {{sentiment}} in the United States was the Catholic community, which constituted over 20% of the national vote. McCarthy identified himself as Catholic, and although the <b>great</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> Catholics were Democrats, as his fame as a leading anti-Communist grew, he became popular in Catholic communities across the country, with strong support from many leading Catholics, diocesan newspapers, and Catholic journals.|$|E
5|$|The 2001 census {{revealed}} {{there were}} only three second homes in the village, but that many villagers commuted each day to work. The <b>great</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> properties are owner-occupied, with just over 100 rented from the council or private landlords. Most of the houses (over 500) are classified as detached, the average number of rooms per property is 6.0 and the average household size is 2.3.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolution}} of galaxies can be significantly affected by interactions and collisions. Mergers of galaxies were common {{during the early}} epoch, {{and the majority of}} galaxies were peculiar in morphology. Given the distances between the stars, the <b>great</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> stellar systems in colliding galaxies will be unaffected. However, gravitational stripping of the interstellar gas and dust that makes up the spiral arms produces a long train of stars known as tidal tails. Examples of these formations can be seen in NGC 4676 or the Antennae Galaxies.|$|E

40|$|The ZMAN {{holdings}} of Palaearctic Lepidoptera {{belong to the}} regalia of the collection. The size of the Lepidoptera collection, {{the quality of the}} material, {{and the fact that the}} <b>greater</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> material has recently been expertly identified and arranged, provide this part of the collection with a high priority for digitization. Approximately 17 % of this collection has now been digitised...|$|R
5|$|Throughout his career, {{the store}} {{was one of the}} central {{components}} of his business. It was a center of supplies and news {{for the people of the}} Rogue, who awaited the arrival of the fall provision ship with anticipation and anxiety, for this vessel was the only source of winter provisions. It provided Hume, the employer of the <b>great</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> the citizens of Gold Beach and Wedderburn, with a means of repossessing the wages of his employees and of profiting on the exchange.|$|E
5|$|With few exceptions, each neuron in {{the brain}} {{releases}} the same chemical neurotransmitter, or combination of neurotransmitters, at all the synaptic connections it makes with other neurons; this rule is known as Dale's principle. Thus, a neuron can be characterized by the neurotransmitters that it releases. The <b>great</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> psychoactive drugs exert their effects by altering specific neurotransmitter systems. This applies to drugs such as cannabinoids, nicotine, heroin, cocaine, alcohol, fluoxetine, chlorpromazine, and many others.|$|E
5|$|After the {{unification}} of the peninsula up to Taedong River in 668 AD, Gyeongju {{became the center of}} Korean political and cultural life. The city was home to the Silla court and the <b>great</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> the kingdom's elite. Its prosperity became legendary, and was reported as far away as Persia according to the 9th century book The Book of Roads and Kingdoms. Records of Samguk Yusa give the city's population in its peak period as 178,936 households, suggesting that the total population was almost one million. Many of Gyeongju's most famous sites date from this Unified Silla period, which ended in the late 9th century by Goryeo (918–1392).|$|E
5000|$|The {{elections}} were largely won by Our Ukraine Bloc with the <b>greatest</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> 57% in the Yaremche municipality. The lowest {{popularity of the}} political bloc was in the biggest cities in the region Ivano-Frankivsk and Kolomyia and if the city of Ivano-Frankivsk Our Ukraine marginally has won, the Kolomyia municipality was decisively [...] "overtaken" [...] by the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc.|$|R
5000|$|For 1973-74, the 350 Rocket V8 with four-barrel {{carburetor}} and [...] was the standard Cutlass Supreme engine with a 250-horsepower 455 Rocket offered as an option. Both three- and four-speed manual transmissions were offered in 1973, but the <b>greatest</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> Cutlasses (including Supremes) were built with the three-speed Turbo Hydra-matic automatic transmission which became standard equipment in 1974, along with variable-ratio power steering.|$|R

5|$|As the Arabs customarily did not {{campaign}} during winter, Asad demobilized his men. On Harith's urging, on {{the other}} hand, the Turgesh khagan decided to launch a winter attack south of the Oxus, hoping to raise the local population in revolt against the Arabs. In this he was joined not only by Harith and his followers, but by the <b>great</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> the native princes of Sogdiana and Tokharistan. Asad quickly mobilized his forces and managed to catch the khagan himself with {{a small part of}} his army and defeat them at Kharistan. Although both the khagan and Harith escaped capture, the Battle of Kharistan struck a blow to the khagans prestige, and Suluk's murder by his rivals a short while afterwards saved the Muslims from worse.|$|E
5|$|Christian doctrines {{include the}} beliefs that Jesus was {{conceived}} by the Holy Spirit, {{was born of}} a virgin named Mary, performed miracles, founded the Church, died by crucifixion as a sacrifice to achieve atonement, rose from the dead, and ascended into Heaven, from where he will return. Most Christians believe Jesus enables humans to be reconciled to God. The Nicene Creed asserts that Jesus will judge {{the living and the}} dead either before or after their bodily resurrection, an event tied to the Second Coming of Jesus in Christian eschatology. The <b>great</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> Christians worship Jesus as the incarnation of God the Son, the second of three persons of a Divine Trinity. A minority of Christian denominations reject Trinitarianism, wholly or partly, as non-scriptural.|$|E
5|$|Freshwater and {{terrestrial}} molluscs appear exceptionally {{vulnerable to}} extinction. Estimates {{of the numbers}} of nonmarine molluscs vary widely, partly because many regions have not been thoroughly surveyed. There is also a shortage of specialists who can identify all the animals in any one area to species. However, in 2004 the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species included nearly 2,000 endangered nonmarine molluscs. For comparison, the <b>great</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> mollusc species are marine, but only 41 of these appeared on the 2004 Red List. About 42% of recorded extinctions since the year 1500 are of molluscs, consisting almost entirely of nonmarine species.|$|E

5|$|From 1890 to 1910, poll {{taxes and}} {{literacy}} tests were instituted across the South, effectively disenfranchising the <b>great</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> black men. White male-only primary elections also served {{to reduce the}} influence of black men in the political system. Along with increasing legal obstacles, blacks {{were excluded from the}} political system by threats of violent reprisals by whites in the form of lynch mobs and terrorist attacks by the Ku Klux Klan. Some Democrats even advocated a repeal of the amendment, such as William Bourke Cockran of New York.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>great</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> cells, smooth ER {{regions are}} scarce {{and are often}} partly smooth and partly rough. They are {{sometimes}} called transitional ER because they contain ER exit sites from which transport vesicles carrying newly synthesized proteins and lipids bud off for transport to the Golgi apparatus. In certain specialized cells, however, the smooth ER is abundant and has additional functions. The smooth ER of these specialized cells functions in diverse metabolic processes, including synthesis of lipids, metabolism of carbohydrates, and detoxification of drugs and poisons.|$|E
5|$|Insects {{arrived on}} Surtsey soon after its formation, and were first {{detected}} in 1964. The original arrivals were flying insects, {{carried to the}} island by winds and their own power. Some were {{believed to have been}} blown across {{from as far away as}} mainland Europe. Later insect life arrived on floating driftwood, and both live animals and carcasses washed up on the island. When a large, grass-covered tussock was washed ashore in 1974, scientists took half of it for analysis and discovered 663 land invertebrates, mostly mites and springtails, the <b>great</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> which had survived the crossing.|$|E
50|$|The closet auger (named after water closet) feeds a {{relatively}} short auger through a hook-shaped length of metal tubing. The hook shape {{makes it easier to}} feed the auger into the toilet. A plastic boot {{on the end of the}} auger protects the finish of the visible porcelain. Since most toilet clogs occur in the trap built into the bowl, the short cable is sufficient to break up or retrieve the <b>greater</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> clogs.|$|R
50|$|Among the Yorubas, the {{indigenous}} religions have largely lost the <b>greater</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> their traditional followers to Christianity and Islam. Be {{that as it}} may, the old festivals are still almost universally observed as tourist attractions which generate a lot of revenue for government and small businesses around the Lagos Island venue of the Eyo festival. It is during these occasions that their traditional monarchs and nobles exercise {{the most of their}} residual power.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>great</b> <b>majority</b> (80.4%) <b>of</b> the {{occupied}} private dwellings in Cremorne Point were flats, units or apartments. This is {{significantly higher than}} the national average of 13.6% for these dwelling types.|$|R
