5|$|The {{streets of}} Buenos Aires overflowed with huge piles of flowers. Within {{a day of}} Perón's death, all flower shops in Buenos Aires {{had run out of}} stock. Flowers would be flown <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> the country, and as far away as Chile. Despite the fact that Eva Perón never held a {{political}} office, she was eventually given a state funeral usually reserved for a head of state, along with a full Roman Catholic requiem mass. A memorial was held for the Argentine team during the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki due to Eva Perón's death during those games.|$|E
5|$|Constructing a warship of {{the size}} of the Mary Rose was a major undertaking, {{requiring}} vast quantities of high-quality material. In the case of building a state-of-the-art warship, these materials were primarily oak. The total amount of timber needed for the construction can only be roughly calculated since only about one third of the ship still exists. One estimate for the number of trees is around 600 mostly large oaks, representing about 16 hectares (40 acres) of woodland. The huge trees that had been common in Europe and the British Isles in previous centuries were by the 16th century quite rare, which meant that timbers were brought <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> southern England. The largest timbers used in the construction were of roughly the same size as those used in the roofs of the largest cathedrals in the high Middle Ages. An unworked hull plank would have weighed over 300kg (660lb), and one of the main deck beams would have weighed close to three-quarters of a tonne.|$|E

Donations were mailed <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> the continental United States, Hawaii, South America, and Europe. In addition to receiving donations, the Temple also sold trinkets, such as pieces of Jones' robes, healing oil, Temple rings, key chains, and lockets.

Several funds were established to handle donations, particularly the Texas City Relief Fund, created by the city's mayor Curtis Trahan. One of the largest fundraising efforts {{for the city and}} the victims of the disaster was organized by Sam Maceo, one of the two brothers who ran organized crime in Galveston at the time. Maceo organized a large-scale benefit on the island featuring some of the most famous entertainers of the time including Phil Harris, Frank Sinatra, and Ann Sheridan. In the end, the Texas City Relief Fund raised more than $1 million ($ in today's terms). Payouts for fire insurance claims reached nearly $4 million ($ in today's terms).|$|E
25|$|Prior to the CPP taking office, British {{officials}} had prepared a ten-year plan for development. With demands for infrastructure improvements coming <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> the colony, Nkrumah approved it in general, but halved {{the time to}} five years. The colony was in good financial shape, with reserves from years of cocoa profit held in London, and Nkrumah was able to spend freely. Modern trunk roads were built along the coast and within the interior. The rail system was modernised and expanded. Modern water and sewer systems were installed in most towns, where housing schemes were begun. Construction began on a new harbour at Tema, near Accra, and the existing port, at Takoradi, was expanded. An urgent programme to build and expand schools, from primary to teacher and trade training, was begun. From 1951 to 1956, the number of pupils being educated at the colony's schools rose from 200,000 to 500,000. Nevertheless, the number of graduates being produced was insufficient to the burgeoning civil service's needs, and in 1953, Nkrumah announced that though Africans would be given preference, {{the country would be}} relying on expatriate European civil servants for several years.|$|E

[...] Using the same principle for the Fram voyage, Nansen chose a party of just twelve from the thousands of applications that poured <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> the world. One applicant was the 20-year-old Roald Amundsen, future conqueror of the South Pole, whose mother stopped him from going.

500|$|Born in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, Bridges {{began his}} career with local side Cambridge United, whom he joined {{at the age of}} 8, he progressed through the club's youth system before signing his first {{professional}} contract in February 2002. He broke into the first-team {{towards the end of the}} 2001–02 season, making his debut as a substitute in a 1–0 defeat against Huddersfield Town at the Abbey Stadium. He played six further games in the same season, scoring his first goal for Cambridge in a 2–1 home win against Tranmere Rovers. Bridges featured regularly in the opening half of the 2002–03 season, playing a total of 25 times and scoring once in a 3–0 victory against York City. However, a [...] "persistent" [...] ankle injury cut his run in the first-team short, and he did not feature from February onwards. He returned to first-team action in a 1–0 defeat to Wycombe Wanderers in October 2003, and played a further 22 times for the club throughout the 2003–04 campaign. However, Bridges left Cambridge at the end of the season after failing to agree a contract extension. On leaving Cambridge, Bridges said [...] "I was offered a contract that was almost a kick in the teeth after the time I had been at the club when players were coming <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> the place who did not care about the club. They were getting paid five or six times what I was offered, and I thought it was probably time to move on". During his three seasons with the club, Bridges made a total of 55 appearances in all competitions,scoring four times.|$|E

[...] As Yoakum's fame spread, donations came <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> the world to support its operations.

2500|$|In wartime Britain, the orchestral {{situation}} on tour sometimes verged on collapse. Godfrey’s weekly {{reports to the}} company office in London included wry accounts of drummers in Oxford who could not read music, a nervous cellist in Liverpool who played on three strings at once and a bass player in Wimbledon who took a night off and sent an inebriated substitute. [...] Even in peacetime Godfrey was not lavishly provided for in the orchestra pit. In the 1950s, the magazine The Gramophone commented: [...] "Whenever Mr. Isidore Godfrey enters the orchestra pit to direct an opera by Sullivan, to whose music he has devoted much of his life, he must presumably steel his aesthetic sense to doing justice to the composer with the tiny forces at his disposal. ... One presumes that an opera company with a repertory of ten operas, playing to capacity without expensive stars and only repairs to scenery and costumes and with royalties pouring <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> the country, could afford a permanent orchestra of reasonable strength." ...|$|E
