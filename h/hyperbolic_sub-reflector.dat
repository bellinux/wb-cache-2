50|$|The {{standard}} symmetrical, parabolic, Cassegrain reflector {{system is}} very popular in practice because it allows minimum feeder length to the terminal equipment. The major disadvantage of this configuration is blockage by the <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>sub-reflector</b> and its supporting struts (usually 3-4 are used). The blockage becomes very significant when {{the size of the}} parabolic reflector is small compared to the diameter of the sub-reflector.To avoid blockage from the sub-reflector asymmetric designs such as the open Cassegrain can be employed. Note however that the asymmetry can have deleterious effects on some aspects of the antenna's performance - for example, inferior side-lobe levels, beam squint, poor cross-polar response, etc.|$|E
5000|$|M2 is the <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>sub-{{reflector}}</b> of {{the dual}} reflector Cassegrain system {{and has a}} diameter of 3.28 metres. It is made from a carbon fibre shell covered in {{a thin layer of}} aluminium foil. The requirement on the surface flatness is tighter than for the primary due to the scaling of the main beam size and comes in at 53 microns RMS. It has two nominal movement phase firstly a fine motion to correct for defocusing as a small defocus at the secondary is magnified 21 times at the Cassegrain focus and which can result in large coupling losses especially at high frequencies. Secondly a large axial displacement is also possible (1 metre) which allows the holographic receptor to be placed in the focus of the parabolic reflector.|$|E
