25|$|In {{massive and}} submassive PE, {{dysfunction}} {{of the right}} side of the heart may be seen on echocardiography, an indication that the pulmonary artery is severely obstructed and the right ventricle, a low-pressure pump, is unable to match the pressure. Some studies (see below) suggest that this finding may be an indication for thrombolysis. Not every person with a (suspected) pulmonary embolism requires an echocardiogram, but elevations in cardiac troponins or brain natriuretic peptide may indicate <b>heart</b> <b>strain</b> and warrant an echocardiogram, and be important in prognosis.|$|E
2500|$|The {{primary use}} of the ECG is to rule out other causes of chest pain. [...] An {{electrocardiogram}} (ECG) is routinely done on people with chest pain to quickly diagnose myocardial infarctions (heart attacks), an important differential diagnosis in an individual with chest pain. While certain ECG changes may occur with PE, none are specific enough to confirm or sensitive enough {{to rule out the}} diagnosis. An ECG may show signs of right <b>heart</b> <b>strain</b> or acute cor pulmonale in cases of large PEs — the classic signs are a large S wave in lead I, a large Q wave in lead III, and an inverted T wave in lead III (S1Q3T3), which occurs in 12–50% of people with the diagnosis, yet also occurs in 12% without the diagnosis.|$|E
50|$|Right <b>heart</b> <b>strain</b> (also right {{ventricular}} strain or RV strain) is {{a medical}} finding of right ventricular dysfunction where the heart muscle of the right ventricle (RV) is deformed. Right <b>heart</b> <b>strain</b> {{can be caused by}} pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary embolism (or PE, which itself can cause pulmonary hypertension), RV infarction (a heart attack affecting the RV), chronic lung disease, pulmonic stenosis, bronchospasm, and pneumothorax.|$|E

50|$|When {{using an}} echocardiograph (echo) to {{visualize}} the <b>heart,</b> <b>strain</b> can appear with the RV being enlarged and more round than typical. When normal, the RV is about {{half the size of}} the left ventricle (LV). When strained, it can be as large as or larger than the LV. An important potential finding with echo is McConnell's sign, where only the RV apex wall contracts; it is specific for right <b>heart</b> <b>strain</b> and typically indicates a large PE.|$|E

50|$|Other symptom-oriented {{diagnostic}} exams:Blood clots {{that form}} in deep veins {{of the body}} can break off and block {{blood vessels in the}} lungs, resulting in low oxygen, <b>heart</b> <b>strain</b> and death. The most common location of these deep vein thromboses (DVTs) is in the legs. A bedside ultrasound can determine {{the presence or absence of}} blood clots and their location in the proximal lower extremity to behind the knee.Those presenting with eye pain or visual loss, ultrasound of the eye can be used for the detection of orbital pathology. Ultrasound has been described to detect retinal detachments, vitreous hemorrhage, dislocation of the lens, as well as evaluating optic nerve sheath diameters as a potential indicator of other diseases in the central nervous system.|$|E
5000|$|On an {{electrocardiogram}} (ECG), {{there are}} multiple ways RV strain can be demonstrated. A finding of S1Q3T3 is an insensitive sign of right <b>heart</b> <b>strain.</b> It is non-specific (as it does not indicate a cause) and is present in a minority of PE cases. It can also result from acute changes associated with bronchospasm and pneumothorax. Other EKG signs include a right bundle branch block as well as T wave inversions in the anterior leads, which are [...] "thought to be the consequence of an ischemic phenomenon due to low cardiac output {{in the context of}} RV dilation and strain." [...] Aside from echo and ECG, RV strain is visible with a CT scan of the chest and via cardiac magnetic resonance.|$|E

50|$|In 1935 Anna {{moved into}} a house in Xie He Hutong in the eastern {{district}} of Peking. The house had been rented since 1931 by Laurence Sickman, an American later to become the Director of the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, and his mother. When Sickman returned to the US in 1935, his mother wished to stay in Peking and invited Anna to share the beautifully furnished traditional courtyard house. In the spring of 1935 Mary came to Peking to stay with Anna and celebrate the publication by Vetch of their book on the Yungang caves. On 27 August they set out from Peking on the journey first suggested by Vetch, a self-styled “pilgrimage” to the sacred mountains. This they completed in two formidable journeys, over two months {{in the autumn of}} 1935 (to northern Heng Shan, Wutai Shan and Hua Shan) and four months {{in the spring and summer}} of 1936 (to Song Shan, Emei Shan, southern Heng Shan and Jiu Hua Shan).

5000|$|Dr. Michael Van Rooyen, {{director}} of the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative, dismissed the observation results as [...] "impossible", observing that the bodies of profoundly malnourished people quickly consume their own body's resources, resulting in liver failure, tachycardia and <b>heart</b> <b>strain.</b> A spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association stated that, [...] "The {{bottom line is that}} even fasting for more than a day can be dangerous. You need food to function." [...] Nutrition researcher Peter Clifton also disagreed with study results, accusing the research team of [...] "cheating" [...] by allowing Jani to gargle and bathe, and stating that a human of average weight would die after [...] "15 to 20 days" [...] without water. People who avoid food and water to emulate mystical figures often die. Sanal Edamaruku characterized the experiment as a farce for allowing Jani {{to move out of the}} CCTV cameras' field of view, claiming that video footage showed Jani was allowed to receive devotees and to leave the sealed test room for sunbathing. Edamaruku also said that the gargling and bathing activities were insufficiently monitored. Edamaruku was denied access to the site where the tests were conducted in both 2003 and 2010, and accuses Jani of having [...] "influential protectors" [...] responsible for denying him permission to inspect the project during its operation, despite having been invited to join the test during a live television broadcast. The Indian Rationalist Association observed that individuals making similar claims in the past have been exposed as frauds.|$|E

40|$|Purpose. To {{evaluate}} {{the safety and}} efficacy of the Possis rheolytic thrombectomy with or without indwelling catheter-directed pharmacolysis {{for the treatment of}} massive pulmonary embolus in patients presenting with right <b>heart</b> <b>strain</b> and/or a pulseless electrical activity (PEA). Materials and Methods. Retrospective review of patients undergoing pulmonary pharmacolysis was performed (07 / 2004 – 06 / 2009). Pre- and posttreatment Miller index scoring weres calculated and compared. Patients were evaluated for tPA doses, ICU stay, hospital stay, and survival by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Results. 11 patients with massive PE were found, with 10 / 11 presenting with a Miller score of > 17 (range: 16 – 27, mean: 23. 2). CTPA and/or echocardiographic evidence of right <b>heart</b> <b>strain</b> was found in 10 / 11 patients. 3 (27 %) patients presented with a PEA event. Two (18 %) patients had a contraindication to pharmacolysis and were treated with mechanical thrombectomy alone. The intraprocedural mortality was 9 % (= 1 / 11). Of the 10 patients who survived the initial treatment, 7 patients underwent standard mechanical thrombectomy initially, while 5 received power pulse spray mechanical thrombectomy. Eight of these 10 patients underwent adjunctive indwelling catheter-directed thrombolysis. The mean catheter-directed infusion duration was 18 hours (range of 12 – 26 hours). The average intraprocedural, infusion, and total doses of tPA were 7 [*]mg, 19. 7 [*]mg, and 26. 7 [*]mg, respectively. There was a 91 % (10 / 11) technical success rate. The failure was the single mortality. Average reduction in Miller score was 9. 5 or 41 % (= 0. 009), obstructive index of 6. 4 or 47 % (= 0. 03), and perfusion index of 2. 7 or 28 % (= 0. 05). Average ICU and hospital stay were 7. 4 days (range 2 – 27 days) and 21. 3 days (range 6 – 60 days), respectively. Intent to treat survival was 90 % at 6, 12, and 18 months. Conclusion. Rheolytic thrombectomy with or without adjunctive catheter-directed thrombolysis provides a safe and effective method for treatment of acute PE in patients who present with right <b>heart</b> <b>strain</b> and/or a PEA event...|$|E

Aortas and coronary arteries of transplanted aortas in both recipient groups developed florid intimal thickening by 4 to 10 weeks, with marked lipid deposition, foamy macrophages, and infiltration of smooth muscle alpha-actin-positive cells in apolipoprotein-E-deficient mice. Lipid was layered against the internal elastic lamina as in human transplants. VCAM- 1 was increased in various sites in both groups. Allotransplants to apolipoprotein-E-deficient recipients had more severe aortic and coronary lesions with characteristic T cell infiltration than native hearts. In this sense, transplants suffered from accelerated atherosclerosis. The character of coronary vascular changes in transplanted hearts was distinctly affected by their lipid environment, but their severity, in terms of luminal encroachment, was not markedly different...|$|R
