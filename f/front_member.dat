5|$|Following his graduation, Griffin {{became a}} {{political}} worker at the National Front headquarters. As a teenager he had accompanied {{his father to}} a National Front meeting, and by 1978, he was a national organiser for the party. He helped set up the White Noise Music Club in 1979, and several years later worked with white power skinhead band, Skrewdriver. In 1980, he {{became a member of}} the party's governing body, the National Directorate, and in the same year launched Nationalism Today with the aid of Joe Pearce, then editor of the NF youth paper Bulldog. As a National <b>Front</b> <b>member,</b> Griffin contested the seat of Croydon North West twice, in the 1981 by-election and 1983 general election, securing 1.2% and 0.9% of the vote.|$|E

Longtime member Armond Morales decided to bring her in when Beddoe left the group while in the midst of recording for Big God. She remained in the lineup through 1993's Stir it Up.|$|E

After that, Nagao appeared {{in front of their}} fans as a member only twice more—the performance of the third debut anniversary held in September 2002, and a guest appearance in the second encore of their last live concert held on November 25, 2005. Nagao decided to work behind the scenes as he was unable to manage both the production of music and the live performance and promotional campaign. Nagao only wrote songs after he stopped appearing in public, and he hardly participated in recording.|$|E
25|$|The ruling Labour Front {{had won the}} 1955 general {{elections}} under David Marshall. However, Marshall was vocally anti-British and anti-colonialist, and the British {{found it difficult to}} come to an agreement or a compromise. Eventually after failing to reach any agreement about a definite plan for self-government he resigned in 1956, following a pledge that he would achieve self-government or resign. Lim Yew Hock, another Labour <b>Front</b> <b>member,</b> took his place. He pursued an aggressive anti-communist campaign and manage to convince the British to make a definite plan for self-government. The Constitution of Singapore was revised accordingly in 1958, replacing the Rendel Constitution with one that granted Singapore self-government and the ability for its own population to fully elect its Legislative Assembly. Previously under the Rendel Constitution, drawn up in 1955 by a commission led by George William Rendel, the Legislative Assembly and its leaders could not fully be determined by the population; the British government appointed seven of the 32 members, with the remaining 25 seats elected by the public, albeit with limited suffrage. This itself was an improvement from the pre-1955 Legislative Council, in which only nine of the 25 members were elected.|$|E
2500|$|In his 4 January 1947 {{conversation}} with the United States Secretary of State George Marshall, Romania's Ambassador Mihai Ralea received an official American reproach for having [...] "broken the spirit and letter" [...] of the Moscow Conference and the Yalta Agreement. Although Ralea, a Ploughmen's <b>Front</b> <b>member</b> and conjectural ally of the Communists, expressed concern {{over the fact that}} the United States were reproving Romania, he also appealed to the United States not to allow the country to be left behind the Iron Curtain. In August 1946, Berry attested that Groza intended to tighten connections with other countries occupied by the Red Army, as the basis for a customs union. The plan, also advocated by Bulgaria's Georgi Dimitrov and Yugoslavia's Josip Broz Tito, was frustrated by the opposition of Joseph Stalin, and discarded altogether following the Tito-Stalin Split.|$|E

5000|$|On February 28, 1992, the Toronto Sun {{broke the}} story that the Heritage Front had {{infiltrated}} the Reform Party. Droege claimed as many as 150 to 200 Heritage <b>Front</b> <b>members</b> were also members of the Reform Party, including some at the riding executive levels, but only a handful were discovered to be actual Heritage <b>Front</b> <b>members.</b> When Reform Party executives became aware that Heritage <b>Front</b> <b>members</b> had joined the Reform Party, a special committee of the Executive Council began an investigation. The Special Committee revoked the membership in the Reform Party of Droege, Dawson, Polinuk, and Mitrevski. Overfield was expelled from the Reform Party, for showing “poor judgement in the hiring of known neo-Nazis." ...|$|R
2500|$|The Turkistan Islamic Party in Syria {{uses the}} Jihadist flag {{with the name}} of the group in Arabic below the shahada:( [...] لحزب [...] (الإسلامي التركستاني لنصرة أهل الشام)"Turkistan Islamic Party for the Support of the People of al-Sham" [...] (...) [...] The TIP sent the Turkistan Brigade (...) to {{participate}} in the Syrian Civil War, notably in the 2015 Jisr al-Shughur offensive. The TIP leader in Syria was Abu Rida al-Turkestani (أبو رضا التركستاني). Al-Turkestani gave a speech during the Jisr al-Shughur offensive, inviting [...] "Muslims" [...] from [...] "East Turkestan" [...] to come to Sham to [...] "kill" [...] "Nusayris" [...] (Alawites). Denouncing the U.S., he said that Muslims are oppressed [...] "in the land of Afghanistan, and in Turkestan, and in Waziristan, and in Burma, and in Bilad ash-Sham". In May 2015, al-Turkestani was killed by the Syrian army in Jisr al-Shugour. TIP members in Syria fight with the al-Nusra Front, since it is allied with al-Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan and conducted suicide bombings for the front. TIP members have been killed in battle in Syria, and the party eulogized members who participated in suicide bombings and were killed in action in Jisr al Shughur. [...] A Jabhat Al Nusra Jihadist called Abu Mohamed Al-Ansari, an al-Nusra <b>Front</b> <b>member,</b> said: [...] "The battle was good, praise be to God. The brothers from all the groups started working together and coordinating. Each faction is responsible for a side. The majority were immigrant brothers from Turkestan. They are the ones who attacked the important points." [...] Front spokesman Abu Maria al-Qahtani said that Muslims were [...] "oppressed" [...] in [...] "Turkestan" [...] and Nusra needs to [...] "defend" [...] them. The TIP joined the offensive on the Al-Ghab plain with al-Qaeda-affiliated Jund al-Aqsa against the Syrian army, calling the Syrian army (disparagingly) [...] "Nusayri". The Turkistan Islamic Party and the al-Nusra Front launched a joint operation which overran the Syrian military's Abu Dhuhur airbase. The Turkistan Islamic Party's Islam Awazi released photos of its fighters in Syria. The Uyghur Turkistan Islamic Party, the Taliban-allied Uzbek Imam Bukhari Jamaat, the al-Qaeda-allied Uzbek Katibat al Tawhid wal Jihad and the Jund al-Aqsa cooperated on the Al Ghab plain to conquer crucial villages, with the TIP conducting suicide bombings in Jisr al Shughur and overrunning Abu Dhuhur with Jund al-Aqsa and al-Nusrah. The Turkistan Islamic Party released photos of their Uyghur fighters at Abu Dhuhur. A mass execution of 56 captured Syrian soldiers was carried out by the Turkestan Islamic Party in Syria with Jabhat al-Nusra at Abu al-Duhur. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that Chechens who defected to ISIS were replaced with the Uyghur Turkistan Islamic Party, allied with Al-Qaeda.|$|E
