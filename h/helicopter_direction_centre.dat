The primary difference between TACC and HDC was that TACC controlled the tactical disposition of the helicopters and HDC controlled the helicopters {{as long as they}} were in the Navy's airspace.

50|$|Because the Chain Home radar {{stations}} faced out to sea, once airborne intruders {{had crossed}} the British coast {{they could no longer}} be tracked by radar; and accordingly the interception <b>direction</b> <b>centres</b> relied on visual and aural sightings of the Observer Corps for continually updated information on the location and heading of enemy aircraft formations. While this arrangement worked acceptably during the daylight raids of the Battle of Britain, subsequent bombing attacks of The Blitz demonstrated that such techniques were wholly inadequate for identifying and tracking aircraft at night.|$|R

25|$|To {{handle the}} mass of data and the {{potential}} for overlap, Dowding instituted a policy of sending all location reports from the radars to a new fighter <b>direction</b> <b>centre</b> at Fighter Command headquarters. This mimicked the system the OC had already set up for co-ordinating the reports from many individual spotters into a map covering a larger area. The new system did the same at a far larger scale, all of the UK. Telephone operators in contact with the CH and OC centers relayed reports to workers around the map, who used these reports to place small coloured markers on the map. The markers formed lines which, as they elongated, indicated the location and direction of the targets. Each cluster was assigned a number, its track.|$|R

The identifiers are the last letter of the call sign for the gun and battery in question (one gun adjusts, the next call sign fires the actual fire for effect and how many shells each gun fires in the mission. For example, if there are three guns in the battery, the FDC decides that each fires five rounds, that means fifteen rounds will be fired: [...] "R, F, DPICM in effect, 5 rounds, over."

50|$|Since the {{publication}} of this work, his work has turned increasingly in a new <b>direction,</b> <b>centred</b> {{on the history of}} communication and particularly documenting the early history of print. Ten years of field work in French libraries, for which he gathered a sizable research group, culminated in 2007 with {{the publication}} of French Vernacular Books, of a complete listing of all French books published in the first age of print, 1450-1600 (co-authored with Malcolm Walsby and Alexander Wilkinson). This project was subsequently expanded into a survey of early print covering the whole of Europe, the Universal Short Title Catalogue (USTC). This free access resource was made available on-line in 2011. In 2016 it will be expanded to encompass books published in the period 1601-1650, doubling the size of the resource.|$|R

25|$|While Laplace's {{version of}} {{determinism}} {{is based on}} general terms, Boscovich's uses physical terms, like position, velocity, <b>direction</b> and <b>centre</b> of mass. Boscovich also (correctly) suggests that the continuity of force is a necessary assumption for determinism, and he presented it in strict mathematical form. In short, Boskovich's determinism is more physical, while Laplace's determinism is more metaphysical, placing it in harmony with Leibniz's metaphysics.|$|R
