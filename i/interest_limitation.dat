40|$|International audience— Visible Light Communication (VLC) {{is a new}} {{emerging}} technology that is being proposed as a reliable and supportive choice for short range communications in ITS. On the same context, Laser Range Finders (LRF) sensors are used for the vehicular environment perception. Compared to VLC, LRF can provide more coverage range and extended viewing angle. To take the full advantages of both technologies features, this paper studies and demonstrate the proposal of using VLC for information exchange among the platoon members and LRF for inter-vehicle distance estimation. A handover algorithm is proposed to manage the switching process for any failure occurrence by assessing LRF and VLC performance using three different metrics: LRF confidence value, vehicles angular orientation, and the VLC link latency. The evaluation of the proposed system is verified using VLC prototype and Pro-SiVIC Simulator driving platoon of two autonomous vehicles over different curvature scenarios. Our {{results show that the}} proposed combination are extending the VLC limitations and satisfying the platooning requirement. However, in the very sharp curvature, LRF was capable of driving the platoon except for the 90 ° curve scenario, the system experienced non-stable behaviour due to the LRF area of <b>interest</b> <b>limitation...</b>|$|E

The thesis also assesses whether the options presented how the extended rules could look liked had been better to protect the Swedish tax base. Furthermore thin capitalizations rules have been evaluated {{if this is a}} better method to protect the Swedish tax base. In 2009 the Swedish deduction <b>limitations</b> rules on <b>interest</b> came in to force to protect the Swedish tax base. Despite these rules companies was still able to avoid Swedish tax and therefore threatened the Swedish tax base. The 1 January 2013 extended <b>interest</b> deduction <b>limitation</b> rules were set in to force. This new rules shall better protect the Swedish tax base. The general rule has been extended to apply on all internal loans. The exception rules, “tioprocentsregeln” and “ventilen”, scope has been limited. The conclusion that can be made after the analysis is that the deduction <b>limitation</b> rules on <b>interest</b> have the potential to protect the Swedish tax base in a short perspective. This is because the tax base is larger which lead to more tax revenues. From a longer perspective it is deemed that the Swedish rules will not protect the Swedish tax base.

40|$|Main objectives] Corporate {{income tax}} systems usually {{discriminate}} {{between the different}} sources of finance: They favour debt over equity financing since interest costs are deductible for tax purposes whereas there is no equivalent relief for equity-financed investments. This unequal treatment might cause economic problems such as excessive leverage in the corporate sector and an associated increased vulnerability to economic crises, disadvantages for firms with restricted access to external funds and profit shifting incentives. To achieve an equal treatment of debt and equity financing, either an additional deduction for equity financing could be granted or the current deduction for interest expenses could be disallowed. A disallowance of interest expenses could be achieved by the <b>interest</b> deduction <b>limitation</b> rules which are already employed in several Member States. Other far-reaching, fundamental tax reforms to address the current debt bias are represented by the Comprehensive Business Income Tax (CBIT), Allowance for Corporate Equity (ACE), Allowance for Corporate Capital (ACC) and Cost of Capital Allowance (COCA). The present study {{provides an in-depth analysis}} of the effects of these different reform options on effective tax burdens in the EU 28 Member States. Moreover, the study gives guidance to which extent current income tax rates at corporate and personal level would have to be adjusted for a revenue neutral implementation of fundamental tax reforms. On the basis of stylised model computations, this study informs about whether different fundamental tax reforms could, in principle, manage to address the debt bias and promote investment, possibly in a revenue neutral way. The main objectives of the study can be summarised as follows: * Analyse current <b>interest</b> deduction <b>limitation</b> rules in the EU 28 Member States and assess the effect of <b>interest</b> deduction <b>limitation</b> rules on effective tax rates; * Provide insights on the effects of the fundamental tax reform options on current tax systems; * Consider a revenue-neutral implementation of the reforms and possible consequences for the level of investment in the EU 28 Member States...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – In this paper, a new fast {{algorithm}} for dental diseases detection is presented. Such algorithm {{relies on}} performing cross correlation {{in the frequency}} domain between input image and the input weights of fast neural networks (FNNs). It is proved mathematically and practically {{that the number of}} computation steps required for the presented FNNs is less than that needed by conventional neural networks (CNNs). Simulation results using MATLAB confirm the theoretical computations. One of the limitations of Direct Digital Radiography (DDR) is noise. Some recent publications have indicated that Digital Subtraction Radiography (DSR) might significantly aid in the clinical diagnosis of dental diseases, once various clinical logistic problems limiting its widespread use have been over come. Noise in digital radiography may result from sources other than variation in projection geometry during exposure. Structure noise consists of all anatomic features other than those of diagnostic <b>interest.</b> <b>Limitations</b> of plain radiographs in detecting early, small bone lesions are also due to the presence of structure noise.
