500|$|Fleming {{decided to}} underplay Bond's character, observing that [...] "Exotic things {{would happen to}} and around him, but {{he would be a}} neutral figure". On another occasion, he {{reinforced}} his point, saying, [...] "When I wrote the first one in 1953, I wanted Bond to be an extremely dull, uninteresting man to whom things happened; <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> to be a blunt instrument".|$|E

I left my children? I did not leave my children. My children are with their father, where they are supposed to be. I didn't do it to be a mother...

500|$|He started {{alongside}} Hall of Fame center Dave Cowens, {{who enjoyed}} playing with Washington, remarking, [...] "It's great fun, {{you can always}} hear him grunt when he's rebounding." [...] Auerbach said, [...] "Kermit was fighting a battle he couldn't win. Nothing he could say or do {{was going to change}} the way people perceived him because of that moment. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> to feel at home with us, to feel wanted." [...] Washington won Boston fans over immediately. His acceptance was aided by a glowing article Bob Ryan of The Boston Globe wrote on the player after researching his life and spending some time with him. After the season, Washington took less money to re-sign with the Celtics over the Denver Nuggets.|$|E

500|$|Beauregard sent a {{telegram}} to President Davis announcing a complete victory. He later admitted, [...] "I thought I had Grant just where <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> and could finish {{him up in}} the morning." [...] Many of his men were jubilant, having overrun the Union camps and taken thousands of prisoners and tons of supplies. Grant still had reason to be optimistic: Lew Wallace's 5,800 men (minus the two regiments guarding the supplies at Crump's Landing) and 15,000 of Don Carlos Buell's army began to arrive that evening. Wallace's division took up a position on the right of the Union line and was in place by 1 a.m.; Buell's men were fully on the scene by 4 a.m., in time to turn the tide the next day.|$|E
500|$|The lead {{character}} of Casino Royale is James Bond, {{an agent of}} the Secret Service. Fleming initially named the character James Secretan before he appropriated the name of James Bond, author of the ornithology guide, Birds of the West Indies. Fleming explained to the ornithologist's wife [...] "that this brief, unromantic, Anglo-Saxon and yet very masculine name was just what I needed, and so a second James Bond was born". He further explained that [...] "When I wrote the first one in 1953, I wanted Bond to be an extremely dull, uninteresting man to whom things happened; <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> to be a blunt instrument... when I was casting around for a name for my protagonist I thought by God, [...] is the dullest name I ever heard." ...|$|E
500|$|The novel centres on the {{exploits}} of James Bond, {{an officer in the}} Secret Intelligence Service, commonly known as MI6. Bond was also known by his code number, 007, and was a commander in the Royal Naval Reserve. Fleming took the name for his character from that of the American ornithologist James Bond, an expert on Caribbean birds and author of the definitive field guide Birds of the West Indies. Fleming, himself a keen birdwatcher, had a copy of Bond's guide, and later told the ornithologist's wife, [...] "that this brief, unromantic, Anglo-Saxon and yet very masculine name was just what I needed, and so a second James Bond was born". In a 1962 interview in The New Yorker, he further explained: [...] "When I wrote the first one in 1953, I wanted Bond to be an extremely dull, uninteresting man to whom things happened; <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> to be a blunt instrument... when I was casting around for a name for my protagonist I thought by God, [...] is the dullest name I ever heard." ...|$|E

500|$|Peter Sarsgaard played John Lotter, Lana's former boyfriend, who {{raped and}} murdered Teena. Sarsgaard {{was one of the}} first choices for the role. He later said he wanted his {{character}} to be [...] "likable, sympathetic even", because he wanted the audience [...] "to understand why they would hang out with me. If my character wasn't necessarily likable, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> to be charismatic enough that you weren't going to have a dull time if you were with him." [...] In another interview, Sarsgaard said he felt [...] "empowered" [...] by playing Lotter. In an interview with The Independent, Sarsgaard said, [...] "I felt very sexy, weirdly, playing John Lotter. I felt like I was just like the sheriff, y'know, and that everyone loved me." [...] Sarsgaard recalled watching footage of and reading about Lotter to prepare for the role. Peirce cast Alicia Goranson, known for playing Becky on the sitcom Roseanne, as Candace because of her likeness to Lisa Lambert. Like Sevigny, Goranson had also initially auditioned for the lead role.|$|E
500|$|Yiddish theatre {{composer}} Herman Yablokoff {{claimed in}} his biography, Memoirs of the Yiddish Stage, that the melody to [...] "Nature Boy" [...] was plagiarized from his song [...] "Shvayg mayn harts" [...] ("Hush My Heart"), {{which he wrote}} for his play Papirosn (1935). When met with a lawsuit in 1951 for the plagiarization, ahbez first proclaimed his innocence, and telephoned Yablokoff to explain that he [...] "had heard the melody as if angels were singing it... in the California mountains. He offered me $10,000 to withdraw the suit. I said that the money was not important, but <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> {{to admit that the}} song was geganvet and if he heard angels, they must have bought a copy of my song." [...] Eventually ahbez's lawyers offered to have an out-of-court settlement, offering $25,000 ($ in [...] dollars) to Yablokoff, which he accepted. Freidwald remarked that [...] "it struck no one as ironic that a song with message of love and peace should come to symbolize how cutthroat the pop music business was becoming".|$|E
500|$|In 1999, Sarsgaard earned {{critical}} {{recognition in}} Kimberly Peirce's Boys Don't Cry, {{where he was}} cast as notorious killer John Lotter. The film {{is based on the}} real-life story of Brandon Teena, who was raped and murdered in 1993 by Lotter and Tom Nissen after they found out that he was a trans man. Boys Don’t Cry received overwhelmingly positive acclaim from critics, and his performance was critically well received. According to The Boston Globe, [...] "Peter [...] Sarsgaard... makes the killer's terrible trajectory not only believable, but grounded in the most mundane clodhopper behavior. He isn't a drooling monster, he's a guy you wouldn't look [...] twice at a bar or a convenience store." [...] A contributor from the Seattle Post-Intelligencer wrote [...] "It's a marvelous performance supported ably by... Sarsgaard as the unpredictable, sociopathic Lotter." [...] The film was screened at a special presentation at the 2000 Venice Film Festival. In regards to his character, as how Sarsgaard made him [...] "likeable, sympathetic even" [...] was because he wanted the audience [...] "to understand why they would hang out with me. If my character wasn't necessarily likable, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> to be charismatic enough that you weren't going to have a dull time if you were with him."

500|$|On March 15, 2012, Rihanna {{explained}} her {{collaboration with}} Brown to Ryan Seacrest during his morning show: [...] "The first song that came about was 'Birthday Cake'. I mean, {{we ended up}} recording {{them at the same}} time and executing them together. But I reached out to him about doing 'Birthday Cake' because that’s the only person that, really, it made sense to do the record. Just as a musician, despite everything else, that was going to be the person. You know I thought about rappers, and I’ve done that so many times, and the hottest R artist out right now is Chris Brown. So <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> on the track, and then in turn he was like, ‘Why don’t you do the remix to my track?’ and it was a trade-off. We did two records. One for my fans, one for his fans, and that way our fans can come together. There shouldn’t be a divide. You know? It’s music, and it’s innocent." [...] In March 2012, American rapper Fabolous released his own verse to the [...] "Birthday Cake" [...] remix. The following month, Rick Ross also released the track featuring an added rap verse from himself, along with the previously incorporated Chris Brown verses. Busta Rhymes released his own freestyle to the song along with rapper Reek da Villian.|$|E

I’m really looking forward to working on this, as it’s a great show with a fantastic cast". This episode marked the first appearance of Cliff Curtis, who plays Special Agent Derek Ames, a love interest for Megan Hunt (Delany). Curtis was reported to have a role in Body of Proof in November 2010. Curtis was originally meant to be appearing {{towards the end of the}} season. Delany said, [...] "We do have a very dashing FBI agent coming on for the end of the season, played by Cliff Curtis. [...] an old friend, so <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> for the role". Afterwards, Curtis appears in one more episode; [...] "Hard Knocks". [...] "Missing" [...] marked the first appearance of Joanna Cassidy since the first season. Cassidy, who plays Joan Hunt has appeared in season one episodes, [...] "Society Hill" [...] and [...] "Buried Secrets".
