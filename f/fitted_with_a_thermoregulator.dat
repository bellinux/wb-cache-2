50|$|During the 1930s, 5 H type were {{experimentally}} <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> pantographs of 5 different patterns. 376 was <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Simens Schukert pantograph, 377 was <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Fischer bow collector, 378 was <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ASEA pantograph, 379 was <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Metropolitan Vickers pantograph and 380 was <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> English Electric pantograph.

During the experiments, the pantographs were only used on the reserve track section {{which at the time}} was <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> railway-like catenary overhead system rather than the traditional tramway-style overhead used {{on the rest of the}} system. Because the overhead at the time was not staggered to suit pantograph operation, the pantographs fitted all suffered from uneven wear and as a result the experiment ceased. Ironically, all the surviving H type trams were <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> pantographs 50 years later in October 1986.|$|R
