5|$|The {{computor}} cabinet {{included only}} four main controls. On {{the left side}} of the chassis, from top to bottom, were dials that set the wind direction, wind speed, target altitude and terminal velocity of the bomb. All of these inputs were set by reading their value in a small window on {{the left side of}} the dials. Additional windows provided output values for the <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed,</b> course, and bombing angle (or range angle). Clips in the upper right held a card with levelling data, as well as notes about the sight or the bombs being dropped. The computor was also connected to several external sources. Compressed air was supplied from the engines to drive the mechanism, and an exhaust allowed the less dense used air to escape. Tubes were also connected to the pitot tube and static air source, which allowed the accurate measurement of airspeed. A separate electrical connection input the direction measured on the distant reading compass, using a selsyn.|$|E
5|$|Wind figures {{prominently}} in several popular sports, including recreational hang gliding, hot air ballooning, kite flying, snowkiting, kite landboarding, kite surfing, paragliding, sailing, and windsurfing. In gliding, wind gradients {{just above the}} surface affect the takeoff and landing phases of flight of a glider. Wind gradient can have a noticeable effect on ground launches, also known as winch launches or wire launches. If the wind gradient is significant or sudden, or both, and the pilot maintains the same pitch attitude, the <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> will increase, possibly exceeding the maximum ground launch tow speed. The pilot must adjust the airspeed {{to deal with the}} effect of the gradient. When landing, wind shear is also a hazard, particularly when the winds are strong. As the glider descends through the wind gradient on final approach to landing, airspeed decreases while sink rate increases, and there is insufficient time to accelerate prior to ground contact. The pilot must anticipate the wind gradient and use a higher approach speed to compensate for it.|$|E

25|$|The {{production}} of the Mirage 2000 involves three construction sites, all located in Bordeaux, that specialise in different components. The wings are built at Martignas, and the fuselages are fabricated at Argenteuil, with final assembly taking place at Bordeaux-Merignac. However, the first prototype, Mirage 2000 No. 01, was hand built at St Cloud, before being moved to Dassault's Istres facility for assembly. At the hands of Jean Coureau, No. 01 made its first flight on 10 March 1978, a mere 27 months after the programme go-ahead. During the 65-minute flight, Coureau took the aircraft to Mach 1.02 without afterburner, before climbing to more than 12,000 m and accelerating the aircraft to Mach 1.3. By the end of May, the aircraft had surpassed Mach 2 and an <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> of 650 knots. On {{the other end of}} the speed spectrum, the Mirage 2000 proved to be a capable low-speed aircraft, as demonstrated at the Farnborough Air Show in September 1978, during which Dassault pilot Guy Mitaux-Maurourd raised the aircraft's nose to 25° angle of attack as the aircraft slowed to 100 knots. Later tests showed that the aircraft could attain 30° AoA while carrying fuel tanks and weapons.|$|E

25|$|Equivalent {{airspeed}} (EAS) {{is defined}} as the speed at sea level that would produce the same incompressible dynamic pressure as the true airspeed at the altitude at which the vehicle is flying. An aircraft in forward flight is subject to the effects of compressibility. Likewise, the calibrated airspeed {{is a function of the}} compressible impact pressure. EAS, on the other hand, is a measure of airspeed that is a function of incompressible dynamic pressure. Structural analysis is often in terms of incompressible dynamic pressure, so that equivalent airspeed is a useful speed for structural testing. At standard sea level pressure, calibrated airspeed and equivalent airspeed are equal. Up to about 200 knots CAS and 10,000 ft (3,000 m) the difference is negligible, but at higher speeds and altitudes CAS must be corrected for compressibility error to determine EAS. The significance of equivalent airspeed is that, at Mach numbers below the onset of wave drag, all of the aerodynamic forces and moments on an aircraft are proportional to the square of the equivalent airspeed. The equivalent airspeed is closely related to the <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> shown by the airspeed indicator. Thus, the handling and 'feel' of an aircraft, and the aerodynamic loads upon it, at a given equivalent airspeed, are very nearly constant and equal to those at standard sea level irrespective of the actual flight conditions.|$|E

500|$|As the Spitfire {{gained more}} power {{and was able to}} {{manoeuvre}} at higher speeds, the possibility that pilots would encounter aileron reversal increased, and the Supermarine design team set about redesigning the wings to counter this. The original wing design had a theoretical aileron reversal speed of , which was somewhat lower than that of some contemporary fighters. The Royal Aircraft Establishment noted that, at [...] <b>Indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> (IAS), roughly 65% of aileron effectiveness was lost due to wing twist.|$|E
50|$|The static {{pressure}} system {{is open to}} the exterior of the aircraft to sense the pressure of the atmosphere at the altitude at which the aircraft is flying. This small opening is called the static port. In flight the air pressure is slightly different at different positions around the exterior of the aircraft. The aircraft designer must select the position of the static port carefully. There is no position on the exterior of an aircraft at which the air pressure, for all angles of attack, is identical to the atmospheric pressure at the altitude at which the aircraft is flying. The difference in pressure causes a small error in the altitude indicated on the altimeter, and the <b>airspeed</b> <b>indicated</b> on the <b>airspeed</b> indicator. This error in <b>indicated</b> altitude and <b>airspeed</b> is called position error.|$|R
50|$|The program {{encountered}} {{a number of}} difficulties, much of them due to bureaucratic factionalism and squabbling.

50|$|A given airspeed, {{divided by}} {{the speed of sound}} in that air, gives a ratio known as the Mach number. A Mach number of 1.0 <b>indicates</b> an <b>airspeed</b> equal to the speed of sound in that air.

Even though the airspeed indicator was available to all four aircrew members, the aircraft's airspeed was allowed to continue to decrease. Eight seconds before impact, the aircraft's IAS had deteriorated to [...] and the aircraft's bank angle increased past 60°. At this time Holland or McGeehan applied full right spoiler, right rudder, and nose-up elevator, and the aircraft entered a turning flight stall (also called accelerated stall). This phenomenon is a stall that occurs at a higher airspeed than the design stall speed – which always refers to {{straight and level flight}} – because the aircraft is turning. Due to the bank of 60° or more, the stall speed for the aircraft at that moment was [...] Thus, flying 2 knots slower, the aircraft stalled, without having sufficient altitude to recover before striking the ground.|$|E
500|$|Because {{of the way}} Concorde's delta-wing {{generated}} lift, the undercarriage had to be unusually {{strong and}} tall {{to allow for the}} angle of attack at low speed. At rotation, Concorde would rise to a high angle of attack, about 18 degrees. Prior to rotation the wing generated almost no lift, unlike typical aircraft wings. Combined with the high airspeed at rotation (199 knots <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed),</b> this increased the stresses on the main undercarriage {{in a way that was}} initially unexpected during the development and required a major redesign. Due to the high angle needed at rotation, a small set of wheels were added aft to prevent tailstrikes. The main undercarriage units swing towards each other to be stowed but due to their great height also need to contract in length telescopically before swinging to clear each other when stowed. The four main wheel tyres on each bogie unit are inflated to [...] The twin-wheel nose undercarriage retracts forwards and its tyres are inflated to a pressure of , and the wheel assembly carries a spray deflector to prevent standing water being thrown up into the engine intakes. The tyres are rated to a maximum speed on the runway of [...] The starboard nose wheel carries a single disc brake to halt wheel rotation during retraction of the undercarriage. The port nose wheel carries speed generators for the anti-skid braking system which prevents brake activation until nose and main wheels rotate at the same rate.|$|E
2500|$|Airspeed is {{the speed}} of an {{aircraft}} relative to the air. Among the common conventions for qualifying airspeed are <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> ("IAS"), calibrated airspeed ("CAS"), equivalent airspeed ("EAS"), true airspeed ("TAS"), and density airspeed. [...] <b>Indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> is simply what is read off of an airspeed gauge connected to a pitot static system, calibrated airspeed is <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> adjusted for pitot system position and installation error, and equivalent airspeed is calibrated airspeed adjusted for compressibility effects.

[...] Calibrated airspeed is typically within a few knots of <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed,</b> while equivalent airspeed decreases slightly from CAS as aircraft altitude increases or at high speeds. [...] With EAS constant, true airspeed increases as aircraft altitude increases. This is because air density decreases with higher altitude, but an aircraft's wing requires the same amount of air particles (i.e., mass of air) flowing around it to produce the same amount of lift for a given AOA; thus, a wing must move faster through thinner air than thicker air to obtain the same amount of lift.|$|E

The system processes information in two segments: a pretakeoff segment and a real-time segment.

The real-time segment uses the scheduled performance data, runway length data and transducer measured parameters to monitor the performance of the airplane throughout the takeoff roll. An important feature of this segment is that it updates the estimated runway rolling friction coefficient. Airplane performance predictions also reflect changes in headwind occurring as the takeoff roll progresses. The system displays the position of the airplane on the runway, indicating runway used and runway available, summarizes the critical information into a situation advisory flag, flags engine failures and off-nominal acceleration performance, and indicates where on the runway particular events such as decision speed (V sub 1), rotation speed (V sub R) and expected stop points will occur based on actual or predicted performance.
