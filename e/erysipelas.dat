Methodology: Routine transthoracic echocardiography, {{computed tomography scan}} of the thorax, magnetic resonance angiography of the renal arteries, and conventional digital subtraction angiography were applied. Comprehensive NF- 1 mutation analysis {{was carried out by}} fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis, long-range reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, and multiple-ligation probe assay. All other investigations were performed using routine, well-established techniques. Results: The subject is a 34 -year-old, half-Chinese male; NF- 1 was suspected at age 15 years for the first time. His medical history included preterm birth, mild facial dysmorphism, "café au lait" spots, subcutaneous and paravertebral fibromas, multifocal tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure in early infancy. Noncalcified bone fibromas in the femur and tibia were detected at age 8 years. Surgical right leg lengthening was carried out at age 11 years. Bilateral renal artery stenosis, stenosis and aneurysm of the superior mesenteric artery, and an infrarenal aortic stenosis were detected at age 15 years. Leg edema and ectasia of the basilar artery were diagnosed at age 18 years. After an episode with an <b>erysipela</b> at age 34 years, he developed pericardial and pleural effusion during a 4 -month period. Stenosis of the left subclavian vein at the level of thoracic duct insertion was detected. After repeated pleural punctures, pleural effusion was interpreted as chylothorax. Reduction of lymph fluid production by diet and injection of talcum into the pleural cavity had a long-term beneficial effect on the chylothorax. Leg edema and chylothorax were attributed to affliction of the lymph vessels by the NF- 1. Discussion: Lymphangiopathy resulting in impaired lymph fluid flow and sequestration of lymph fluid into the pleural sinus and the legs may be a rare phenotypic feature of NF- 1.

Desses, destacam-se as lignanas e neolignanas por suas atividades anti-parasit?ria e anti-f?ngica. Estudos farmacol?gicos anteriores descrevem atividade anti-parasit?ria dos ?leos essenciais, atividade anti-leishmania, anti-inflamat?ria, antif?ngica, inseticida e gastroprotetora. Este trabalho teve como objetivo o estudo das a??es farmacol?gicas da fra??o butan?lica padronizada de Virola surinamensis e a an?lise dos mecanismos do efeito hipotensor e da potencia??o da contra??o do m?sculo esquel?tico. A padroniza??o qu?mica foi obtida ap?s parti??o do extrato aquoso das folhas (EA) em butanol dando origem ? fra??o butan?lica (FBut). A purifica??o da Fbut por cromatografia l?quida de alta efici?ncia (CLAE) originou 10 fra??es de elevado grau de pureza (F 1 a F 10) que se encontra em processo de identifica??o. A triagem farmacol?gica do EA e da Fbut mostrou baixa a??o no SNC. Na press?o arterial de ratos anestesiados a inje??o endovenosa tanto do extrato aquoso como da fra??o butan?lica produziu hipotens?o aparentemente associada ? uma a??o bloqueadora de receptores ? 1 -adren?rgicos. A Fbut mostrou-se eficaz na redu??o da press?o arterial durante o tratamento cr?nico. As subst?ncias absorvidas n?o modificaram o comportamento animal no teste de Irwin, mas produziram hipotens?o revers?vel com in?cio em torno de 30 minutos, tempo necess?rio para o esvaziamento g?strico. O tratamento repetido durante 7 dias tamb?m n?o modificou o comportamento animal, mas houve um efeito residual cumulativo da FBut que a cada dia reduziu o valor basal da press?o arterial dos ratos. Em an?is de aorta sem endot?lio, a Fbut relaxou o t?nus induzido pela noradrenalina de maneira concentra??o-dependente, mostrando que Fbut n?o interfere no sistema NOS. Este efeito foi indicativo de antagonismo competitivo e refor?a as evid?ncias obtidas na press?o arterial de que o mecanismo da hipotens?o produzida pela Fbut ? o bloqueio de adrenoceptores do tipo ? 1. A Fbut potenciou a contra??o obtida por est?mulo direto da fibra muscular do diaframa de rato. Em microssomas isolados da musculatura esquel?tica do coelho, a Fbut inibiu a atividade da Ca 2 +-ATPase ? semelhan?a da tapsigargina, indicando que a potencia??o da contra??o do diafragma parece estar relacionada ? diminui??o da recapta??o de Ca 2 + pelo ret?culo sarcoplasm?tico. Virola surinamensis (Myristicaceae), {{popularly known}} as ucuuba, ucuuba branca and sucuuba, is widely distributed in flooded areas of the Amazonian Forest. The bark resin {{is used in the}} folk medicine to treat <b>erysipela</b> and the tea of the leaves, to treat colics, dyspepsia, inflammations and malaria. The main constituents described for V. surinamensis are arylpropanoids, neolignans, lignans, lignoids, flavonoids, diarylpropanes, ?-butirolactones, alkaloids and acid benzoic derivatives. Among them, lignans and neolignans showed anti-parasitic and anti-fungal activities. Previous pharmacological studies described anti-parasitic effect of the essential oils and anti-leishmania, anti-inflammatory, anti-fungal, insecticide and gastroprotective actions. The aim of this work was to study the pharmacological activity of the standardized buthanolic fraction of Virola surinamensis and the mechanisms of the hypotensive effect and the potentiation of the skeletal muscle contraction. The chemical standardization was obtained after partition of the leaves aqueous extract (AE) in n-buthanol originating the buthanolic fraction (BuF). The BuF purification by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) originated 10 high purity fractions (F 1 to F 10) that are still in identification process. The pharmacological screening of AE and BuF showed low action in the CNS. In the arterial blood pressure of anesthetized rats, the intravenous injection of both AE and BuF produced hypotension apparently associated with the ? 1 -adrenoceptors blockade. The BuF was effective to reduce the arterial blood pressure in the chronic treatment also. The absorbed substances did not modify the animal behavior in the Irwin Test, but produced reversible hypotension initiating in 30 min, time necessary to the gastric emptiness. The treatment during 7 days did not modify the animal behavior, but there was a residual accumulated effect of the BuF reducing the basal arterial blood pressure of the rats. In the isolated aortic rings without endothelium, the BuF relaxed the tonus induced by noradrenalin in a concentration-dependent manner, showing that BuF did not interfere with the NO system. This effect was indicative of a competitive antagonism and reinforced the evidences obtained in the arterial blood pressure that the mechanism of the hypotension produced by BuF was the ? 1 adrenoceptors blockade. The BuF potentiated the direct elicited twitches of the rat diaphragm. In microssomes isolated from the rabbit skeletal muscle, BuF inhibited the Ca 2 +-ATPase activity similarly to thapsigargin, indicating that the potentiation of the diaphragm contraction {{may be related to the}} decrease in the Ca 2 + uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum...|$|R

During this period there were no adequate methods for assessing the safety of the vaccine and there were instances of contaminated vaccine transmitting infections such as <b>erysipelas,</b> tetanus, septicaemia and tuberculosis. In the case of arm-to-arm transfer there was also the risk of transmitting syphilis. Although this did occur occasionally, estimated as 750 cases in 100 million vaccinations, some critics of vaccination e.g. Charles Creighton believed that uncontaminated vaccine itself was a cause of syphilis. Smallpox vaccine was the only vaccine available during this period, and so the determined opposition to it initiated a number of vaccine controversies that spread to other vaccines and into the 21st century.|$|E
25|$|There was {{legitimate}} concern from {{supporters of}} vaccination about its safety and efficacy, {{but this was}} overshadowed by general condemnation, particularly when legislation started to introduce compulsory vaccination. The reason for this was that vaccination was introduced before laboratory methods were developed to control its production and account for its failures. Vaccine was maintained initially through arm-to-arm transfer and later through production on the skin of animals, and bacteriological sterility was impossible. Further, identification methods for potential pathogens were not available until the late 19th to early 20th century. Diseases later shown {{to be caused by}} contaminated vaccine included <b>erysipelas,</b> tuberculosis, tetanus, and syphilis. This last, though rare—estimated at 750 cases in 100 million vaccinations—attracted particular attention. Much later, Dr. Charles Creighton, a leading medical opponent of vaccination, claimed that the vaccine itself was a cause of syphilis and devoted a book to the subject. As cases of smallpox started to occur in those who had been vaccinated earlier, supporters of vaccination pointed out that these were usually very mild and occurred years after the vaccination. In turn, opponents of vaccination pointed out that this contradicted Jenner's belief that vaccination conferred complete protection. The views of opponents of vaccination that it was both dangerous and ineffective {{led to the development of}} determined anti-vaccination movements in England when legislation was introduced to make vaccination compulsory.|$|E
