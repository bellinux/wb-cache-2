Thus, the <b>impedance</b> <b>relay</b> may not operate for a short circuit {{at the far end}} of the protected line (case of the under reach) or operates for a fault beyond its protected zone (case of overreach). In this paper, an approach to fault detection by a {{distance protection}}, which distinguishes between the faulty conditions and the effect of overload operation mode, has been developed. This approach is based on the symmetrical components; mainly the negative sequence, and it is taking into account both the effect of fault resistance and the overload situation which both have an effect upon the reliability of the protection in terms of dependability for the former and security for the latter...|$|E

This supergrid should connect distant generators to increase the introduction of renewable energy sources and to provide an increased security to the pan- European power system. Although many technical limitations remain, the protection system is often regarded as the most critical one. The protection system for a meshed DC system has particular diﬃculties compared to the traditional AC system because of the DC current that has no zero crossings and the line impedance that does not limit the fault current. As a consequence, the DC currents will rise much faster and interrupting the fault current is signiﬁcantly more diﬃcult in the meshed DC than it is in an AC meshed system. Furthermore, traditional protection devices such as <b>impedance</b> <b>relays</b> cannot be used. New alternatives must be found, such as considering a joint strategy between the protection devices and the VSC converter controls.

40|$|PhD (Electrical Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011 The {{rotor shaft}} of a {{synchronous}} machine can experience severe mechanical stress due to torque pulsations during a pole-slip condition. All pole-slip protection relays {{currently on the}} market use the impedance pole-slip protection method to detect a pole-slip. No commercial relay currently available can predict accurately when a generator is about to experience a damaging pole-slip. All the relays will only trip a generator after it has pole-slipped one or more times. Severe mechanical damage could be caused to a machine after only one pole-slip. It is therefore essential to enhance pole-slip protection relays {{to such an extent}} that it can trip a generator before it pole slips. The proposed pole-slip protection function must predict when a generator will become unstable during a network fault. As soon as instability is predicted, the generator must be tripped before the fault is cleared to avoid damaging post-fault torque effects. Conventional impedance pole-slip protection methods are are also discussed and the shortcomings of impedance pole-slip protection are investigated. The new pole-slip protection function was designed by using PSCAD. Detailed PSCAD simulations on different network configurations proved that the new pole-slip protection function will trip a generator before a damaging pole-slip occurs.
