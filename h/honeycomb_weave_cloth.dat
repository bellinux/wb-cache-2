40|$|<b>Honeycomb</b> <b>woven</b> {{fabric is}} a single layer of fabric exhibiting {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) cellular shape on both fabric sides due to the combination of periodic straight yarn floats and partial plain weave. In a fabric weave repeat, the triangle shape of increased yarn floats and crossed diagonal woven lines form two inverted pyramidal spaces on the fabric surfaces and a closed internal space. This particular 3 D architecture is bound to influence the fabric transfer and mechanical properties. This study investigated these properties for <b>honeycomb</b> <b>weaves</b> experimentally, including air resistance, thermal conductivity, water absorption and vapor transmission rate, bending rigidity, compressional energy and tensile behavior. The typical two-dimensional plain woven fabrics with the same yarns and density were set as references and elastic yarns were considered as a factor of effect on the fabric properties. The measurements by the Kawabata Evaluation System and Instron machine show that the <b>honeycomb</b> <b>woven</b> fabric has enhanced air permeability and water absorption, as well as lower thermal conductivity {{compared to that of}} the plain woven fabric. Higher bending rigidity, compressional energy and Young’s modulus are also observed for honeycomb fabrics. The mechanical properties are found to be affected significantly by applying the elastic yarns to the <b>honeycomb</b> <b>woven</b> fabrics. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R

50|$|Traditionally, {{screen cloth}} {{was made with}} metal wires woven with a loom. Today, <b>woven</b> <b>cloth</b> is still widely used {{primarily}} because they are less expensive than other types of screen media. Over the years, different weaving techniques have been developed; either to increase the open area percentage or add wear-life. Slotted opening <b>woven</b> <b>cloth</b> is used where product shape is not a priority and where users need a higher open area percentage. Flat-top <b>woven</b> <b>cloth</b> is used when the consumer wants to increase wear-life. On regular woven wire, the crimps (knuckles on woven wires) wear out faster {{than the rest of}} the cloth resulting in premature breakage. On flat-top <b>woven</b> wire, the <b>cloth</b> wears out equally until half of the wire diameter is worn, resulting in a longer wear life. Unfortunately flat-top <b>woven</b> wire <b>cloth</b> is not widely used because of the lack of crimps that causes a pronounced reduction of passing fines resulting in premature wear of con crushers.|$|R

"Fitting" means that a ply is deformed and applied to a surface so that it is everywhere in contact with the surface. A fitting method is presented that incorporates a flexible method for specifying initial conditions, and allows for the simulation {{of a wide range of}} fitting configurations. 1 Introduction Owing to their outstanding mechanical and structural properties, advanced composite materials, such as fiberglass/epoxy, graphite/epoxy and aramid/epoxy, have become increasingly utilized in aircraft and other vehicles in place of aluminum and duralumin [1, 2, 3]. Bidirectional broadcloth (or <b>woven</b> <b>cloth)</b> composites, one of the major composite production forms [3], have been extensively used for reinforcing structural elements in aircraft.

40|$|The {{techniques}} for rendering <b>woven</b> <b>cloth</b> employed in a production environment often neglect {{many of the}} structural features of the fabric, as well as light-scattering processes {{that occur in the}} yarn. Research in this area has progressed, and new promising methods have recently been proposed; however, many of these are not applied in practice due to their inherent complexities. In this paper, we develop and implement a shader for <b>woven</b> <b>cloth</b> that fulfills some of the needs of a production environment using an existing model for simulating the interaction with light. The shader delivers highly realistic results that are comparable, and in some cases superior, to current methods used in a real production environment. We enriched and validated the proposed framework by using direct feedback from a large company that produces images of furniture using computer graphics. The results demonstrate that our shader accurately simulates the appearance of certain types of <b>woven</b> <b>cloth,</b> showing reflections that are not present in other methods in current use. Our shader is easy to integrate in existing pipelines, flexible because it provides the artist with enough parameters to recreate many different types of fabric, and generic for the domain of <b>woven</b> <b>cloth</b> because it is able to accept as input widely used WIF files, which describe weave patterns as well as yarn specific parameters...|$|R

There are two problems examined in research. Firstly, how the development progress of micro industry of Malay <b>woven</b> <b>cloth</b> in Province of Riau. Second, any impediments experienced by business person of Malay <b>woven</b> <b>cloth</b> in Province of Riau. An academic implication of research is that there is theoretical insight of failure and successful factor in development of micro industry.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model of}} cloth dyeing using {{the characteristics of the}} thread and weave pattern. The proposed dyeing model is based on Fick’s second law that defines the molecular transfer under translational diffusion [Fic 85]. The algorithm in the proposed model calculates the dyeing distribution from parameters such as the amount of dyeing, saturated amount, and pressure in each cell on a timeline. We improve the algorithm based on Fick’s second law to consider a <b>woven</b> <b>cloth</b> structure and describe the proposed model of the structure of <b>woven</b> <b>cloth</b> as a two-layer cellular model. We then visualize the cloth using a simple 2 D shading method of asperity by using the color distribution on a dyed image of real <b>woven</b> <b>cloth.</b> In addition, we provide a method for producing dyeing patterns without dyeing diffusion. The proposed method produces images that capture several of the characteristics of dyeing observed in real dyed cloth.

6000|$|... "I {{have listened}} carefully, {{and there is}} only one name that will epitomize you. I shall call you that name. You are machine-breakers. Do you know what a machine-breaker is? Let me tell you. In the eighteenth century, in England, men and women <b>wove</b> <b>cloth</b> on hand-looms in their own cottages. It was a slow, clumsy, and costly way of <b>weaving</b> <b>cloth,</b> this cottage system of manufacture. Along came the steam-engine and {{labor-saving}} machinery. A thousand looms assembled in a large factory, and driven by a central engine <b>wove</b> <b>cloth</b> vastly more cheaply than could the cottage weavers on their hand-looms. Here in the factory was combination, and before it competition faded away. The men and women who had worked the hand-looms for themselves now went into the factories and worked the machine-looms, not for themselves, but for the capitalist owners. Furthermore, little children went to work on the machine-looms, at lower wages, and displaced the men. This made hard times for the men. Their standard of living fell. They starved. And they said it was all the fault of the machines. Therefore, they proceeded to break the machines. They did not succeed, and they were very stupid.|$|R
