5|$|Instead of {{worrying}} about a possible Austrian threat, Frederick scattered his men facing eastward, the last known location of Daun's army. The troops created an S-shaped line, north to south, adjacent to Hochkirch.

Eleven battalions and 28 squadrons guarded the east side. Frederick had his best soldiers garrison the village of Hochkirch.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the association between residential indoor remodeling and poor semen quality. Sperm donors aged 18 - 45 years old were recruited in Shanghai, China. Semen specimens were collected and analyzed. An in-person interview was conducted to obtain information {{on the history of}} indoor remodeling and potential confounders. A total of 70 participants with abnormal semen quality (case group) and 68 controls were examined. A total of 20 subjects reported indoor remodeling <b>in</b> the <b>recent</b> 24 <b>months,</b> and among them 17 subjects reported indoor remodeling <b>in</b> the <b>recent</b> 12 <b>months.</b> Compared with participants with no history of indoor remodeling, participants with a history of indoor remodeling <b>in</b> the <b>recent</b> 24 <b>months</b> were more than three times as likely to have poor sperm quality (adjusted odds ratio = 3. 8, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 3 - 12. 0) after controlling for potential confounders.

25|$|PMI {{estimation}} is used {{to figure}} out how much time has elapsed since a person died by using insects to help estimate this interval. It depends on the species of insect, as some are attracted to fresh corpses while others are only attracted to the putrid and advanced stages of decomposition. This means the insects go through waves of succession. Using this information as well as the lifecycle of the insect in question can help to estimate the PMI. The judgment depends on what stage of development the insect is in, as well as the weather <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> <b>months</b> among other factors. Specifically with C. cadaverina, they tend to be attracted to fairly advanced stages of decomposition, while rarely being found on fresh carrion. They also tend to be in the second wave of succession, usually showing up after Lucilia spp. and Calliphora spp.|$|E

Atul Khare, deputy head of the U.N.'s peacekeeping department, was dispatched to the region, and Margot Wallström, the organisation's special representative for sexual violence in conflict, was instructed to take charge of the U.N. response and follow up.
