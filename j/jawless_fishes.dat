2500|$|Lymphoid {{cells can}} be {{identified}} in some pre-vertebrate deuterostomes (i.e., sea urchins). These bind antigen with pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) of the innate immune system. [...] In <b>jawless</b> <b>fishes,</b> two subsets of lymphocytes use variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs) for antigen binding. Diversity is generated by a cytosine deaminase-mediated rearrangement of LRR-based DNA segments. There is no evidence for the recombination-activating genes (RAGs) that rearrange Ig and TCR gene segments in jawed vertebrates.|$|E
2500|$|The first jawed {{vertebrates}} {{appeared in}} the late Ordovician and became common in the Devonian, often known as the [...] "Age of Fishes". The two groups of [...] bony fishes, the actinopterygii and sarcopterygii, evolved and became common. The Devonian also saw the demise of virtually all <b>jawless</b> <b>fishes,</b> save for lampreys and hagfish, {{as well as the}} Placodermi, a group of armoured fish that dominated much of the late Silurian. The Devonian also saw the rise of the first labyrinthodonts, which was a transitional between fishes and amphibians.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Jawless</b> <b>fishes</b> {{belong to}} the {{superclass}} Agnatha in the phylum Chordata, subphylum Vertebrata. Agnatha comes from the Greek, and means [...] "no jaws". It excludes all vertebrates with jaws, known as gnathostomes. Although a minor element of modern marine fauna, jawless fish were prominent among the early fish in the early Paleozoic. Two types of Early Cambrian animal apparently having fins, vertebrate musculature, and gills are known from the early Cambrian Maotianshan shales of China: Haikouichthys and Myllokunmingia. They have been tentatively assigned to Agnatha by Janvier. A third possible agnathid from the same region is Haikouella. A possible agnathid {{that has not been}} formally described was reported by Simonetti from the Middle Cambrian Burgess Shale of British Columbia.|$|E

2500|$|The {{evolution}} of the AIS, based on Ig, TCR, and MHC molecules, {{is thought to have}} arisen from two major evolutionary events: the transfer of the RAG transposon (possibly of viral origin) and two whole genome duplications. [...] Though the molecules of the AIS are well-conserved, they are also rapidly evolving. [...] Yet, a comparative approach finds that many features are quite uniform across taxa. [...] All the major features of the AIS arose early and quickly. [...] <b>Jawless</b> <b>fishes</b> have a different AIS that relies on gene rearrangement to generate diversity but has little else in common with the jawed vertebrate AIS. The innate immune system, which has an important role in AIS activation, is the most important defense system of invertebrates and plants.|$|E

25|$|The {{evolution}} of fish began about 530 {{million years ago}} during the Cambrian explosion. It was during this time that the early chordates developed the skull and the vertebral column, leading to the first craniates and vertebrates. The first fish lineages belong to the Agnatha, or <b>jawless</b> <b>fish.</b> Early examples include Haikouichthys. During the late Cambrian, eel-like <b>jawless</b> <b>fish</b> called the conodonts, and small mostly armoured fish known as ostracoderms, first appeared. Most <b>jawless</b> <b>fish</b> are now extinct; but the extant lampreys may approximate ancient pre-jawed fish. Lampreys belong to the Cyclostomata, which includes the extant hagfish, and this group may have split early on from other agnathans.|$|R

50|$|In <b>jawless</b> <b>fishes</b> {{a series}} of gills opened behind the mouth, and these gills became {{supported}} by cartilaginous elements.
