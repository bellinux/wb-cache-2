A study was conducted to evaluate the effects of grazing management systems on the production and quality of Brachiaria brizantha and the performance of lamb grazing this pasture. A total of 72 male lambs aged from 3 to 4 months were used. The lambs were divided into 3 groups and randomly allocated to receive one of the following grazing treatments : GMl-pastures were grazed for 6 weeks and then rested for 6 weeks, GM 2 -pastures were grazed for 1 week and then rested for 6 weeks, and GM 3 -pastures were grazed for 12 weeks and then rested for 12 weeks. The herbage mass measured before and after grazing was greatest (P 0. 10) among the three grazing methods, while after grazing, the proportion of stem fraction was highest and leaf fraction was lowest for GM 3 (P 0. 10) among the grazing methods. The crude protein (CP) concentration was lower (P 0. 10) across grazing treatment and ranged from 29 to 35 g. It was concluded that a 12 -week <b>grazing</b> <b>cycle</b> while could increase the herbage mass of Brachiaria brizantha did not decrease feed intake, the digestibility and the crude protein concentration of the consumed forage.

The present study evaluated structural and nutritive features of Guinea grass (Panicum maximum Jacq. var. Tanzânia) swards and {{the composition and}} yield of milk produced by crossbred cows fed this herbage in a rotational stocking system over cycles from Spring to Autumn. Two stocking systems were tested, in which cattle were allowed to graze: (1) after grazing cycles of 30 days (T 30 d); or (2) when the sward reached a pre-grazing height of 70 cm (T 0. 7 m). Five grazing cycles, each consisting of a sward recovery period followed by 2 days of grazing, were evaluated in each stocking system using a completely randomized block design and repeated measures with 2 repetitions per stocking system (each composed {{of a set of}} sixteen 4000 m 2 paddocks grazed sequentially). Four 1 m× 1 m sward patches were collected, constituting one sample per paddock, which was used to evaluate pre-grazing herbage mass, leaf, stem and dead matter (dry mass per area), crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDFom), acid detergent fiber (ADFom) and hemicellulose (HEM). Cows received daily supplementation of 4 kg concentrate. Stocking rate, milk production and composition were evaluated in each <b>grazing</b> <b>cycle.</b> The T 30 d stocking system produced higher (P= 0. 0014) pre-grazing height than T 0. 7 m (0. 83 vs 0. 69 cm), had higher (P= 0. 0071) light interception (94 vs 91 %) and higher (P= 0. 0233) leaf area index (5. 2 vs 4. 5). In addition, T 30 d exhibited larger (P= 0. 0204) herbage mass than T 0. 7 m (7276 vs 6187 kg MS/ha), higher (P= 0. 0243) leaf dry mass per area (2618 vs 2294 kg/ha) and higher (P< 0. 0001) stocking rate (6. 2 vs 5. 7 animal/ha). The <b>grazing</b> <b>cycle</b> affected sward composition, with T 30 d producing higher (P= 0. 0060) leaf NDFom. Milk production and composition was not affected by the stocking systems, as follows (T 30 d vs T 0. 7 m) : 20. 12 vs 20. 94 kg milk production per cow/day; 31. 4 vs 31. 9 gfat/kg, 29. 9 vs 30. 2 gprotein/kg, 43. 7 vs 44. 6 glactose/kg, 114. 8 vs 116. 5 g/kg total solids and 12. 85 vs 12. 86 mg/dL ureic nitrogen.

The effect of two nitrogen levels, 0 (NF) and 50 kg/ha (F) for three successive <b>grazing</b> <b>cycles,</b> on organic matter intake (OMi) and digestibility (OMd) for Creole heifers (208 kg live weight) was determined. Two groups of four tethered heifers, allowed 18 kg of dry matter daily, grazed individual NF or F circular areas at 28 re-growth days. The heifers were moved and watered daily. Sward characteristics (height, herbage mass, morphological and chemical composition and in situ tiller measurements), OMi, OMd and feeding behaviour (biting rate, bite size, intake rate, grazing and ruminating times) were evaluated simultaneously per circular area. Under nitrogen fertilizer, the stems elongated rapidly (by 133 %) as did the leaves, but to a lesser extent (by 40 %). Consequently, canopy height. leaf and stem masses and crude protein content increased (respectively by 100 %, 66 %, 186 % and 40 %), while total bulk density decreased (by 10, 5 %). Throughout the successive <b>grazing</b> <b>cycles,</b> there was a particular effect on leaf number, both in the F and NF swards, whereas this parameter was not affected by the fertilizer level.

Leaf mass is the major factor accounting for the 9 % increase in OMd under fertilizer regime. On the other hand, whatever the fertilizer regime, OMd was positively influenced by the greater leaf number throughout the <b>grazing</b> <b>cycles.</b> Biting rate, bite size and intake rate were determined respectively by sward height, CP content and stem fraction, whereas grazing and ruminating times were partially influenced by sward characteristics...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT An {{intensive}} grazing in the dwarf-late (DL) elephant grass pasture in a rainy season was conducted under the rotational grazing system. Four paddocks of DL elephant grass pasture, {{which had a}} 5 (20 m × 25 m) of area/paddock, were grazed at 3 cycles of one-week grazing with 3 -week rest period by 3 heads of breeding beef cows from May to November 2003. The plant height, leaf area index and ratio of leaf blade to stem were the highest, while tiller number increased and herbage mass tended to increase as grazing accured, except for the first <b>grazing</b> <b>cycle.</b> Herbage consumption, rate of herbage consumption and dry matter intake tended to decrease in three paddocks from the first to the third cycle. The average of dry matter intake was 10. 2 - 14. 5 g DM/kg/LW/day over the four paddocks and the average daily gain was 0. 09 kg/head day. The carrying capacities was estimated at 1016 (annual total 1224 CD/ha). Thus, DL elephant grass pasture can expand the grazing period for beef cows in a rainy season.

Nas parcelas, avaliou-se o efeito das ofertas de forragem (4, 7, 10 e 13 % do PV/dia) e, nas subparcelas, o efeito dos ciclos de pastejo. Todas as variáveis diferiram entre os ciclos de pastejo, comprovando grande influência das condições ambientais sobre as características avaliadas. A taxa de alongamento do colmo e a altura do dossel responderam linear e positivamente ao aumento da oferta de forragem. O número de perfilhos vegetativos nos piquetes com a menor oferta permaneceu constante ao longo de todo o período experimental, no entanto, nos piquetes com as demais ofertas, atingiu valores mais elevados nos ciclos intermediários. A densidade de perfilhos reprodutivos e totais ajustou-se ao modelo quadrático de acordo com a oferta de forragem. Pastos manejados com ofertas de forragem próximas a 4 % PV/dia têm menor alongamento de colmos e tendem a reduzir as perdas por senescência.

Each of 4 grazing units {{was divided into}} 4 paddocks {{ranging in size from}} 0. 186 to 1. 12 ha using a nested paddock design. Nested paddocks within each grazing unit were grazed rotationally, during 3 consecutive cycles (12, 36, and 24 days), by 10 steers averaging 282 kg for 72 days from early June to late August in 1995 and 1996. Transects (8 to 17) 12 -m long were established in a grid pattern in each paddock. Six tillers each of big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii Vitman) and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) were permanently marked in each transect; height and leaf length of tillers in each paddock were measured before and after grazing in the last 2 <b>grazing</b> <b>cycles</b> in both years. Estimations of grazing distribution were based on a uniformity index, which was calculated by summing the absolute differences of tiller height between adjacent transects. Utilization was estimated by the reduction in tiller height (THR) or leaf length (LLR) due to grazing. Generally, stocking density did not affect THR which ranged from 19 to 22 cm and from 29 to 38 cm among the stocking density treatments in 1995 and 1996, respectively.
