40|$|Although {{strategic}} planning {{has been part}} of the management function for as long as anyone can remember, the emergence of <b>key</b> account <b>plans</b> as a critical subset of the marketing plan in business-to-business markets has not attracted much analysis. This gap needs to be addressed, as <b>key</b> account <b>plans</b> have their own unique complexities. Moreover, the importance of <b>key</b> account <b>plans</b> is increasing. There is a need for a more widespread understanding of the benefits of <b>key</b> account <b>planning,</b> encompassing both processes and outputs.

5000|$|The lake {{is located}} in a marshy moorland {{surrounded}} by forests. West of it is a former military airport today used for motocross and a shooting range. [...] In a 2002 <b>key</b> <b>plan,</b> the land surrounding the lake, owned by the city of Stockholm, is intended to be transformed into one of three nature reserve within the Lida-Riksten Open-air Area forming one of the important green wedges of Stockholm. Encompassing 240 hectares, it is marked as [...] "conservation of rural area" [...] and [...] "larger area valuable for open-air life". Additionally, the area is considered as of significant archaeological interest since it 8.000 years ago, during the Stone Age, was an archipelago composed of sparsely scattered islands and thus contains many traces of the earliest settlements in Stockholm. The area between the lake and the golf course south of it is considered as of great importance for social history since the homestead there is believed to be about 1.500 years old.|$|E
50|$|The {{most salient}} {{characteristic}} of the music from Bluebeard's Castle {{is the importance of}} the minor second, an interval whose dissonance is used repeatedly in both slow and fast passages to evoke aching sadness/disquiet or danger/shock respectively. The minor second {{is referred to as the}} 'blood' motif, for it is used whenever Judith notices blood in the castle. Overall the music is not atonal, although it is often polytonal, with more than one key center operating simultaneously (e.g. the leadup to the climactic opening of the fifth door). However, there are some passages (for example, door 3) where the music is tonal and mostly consonant. Many critics have found an overall <b>key</b> <b>plan,</b> as one would find in a tonal piece of music. The opera starts in a mode of F, modulating towards C in the middle of the piece (tonally, the greatest possible distance from F), before returning to F towards the end. The text and setting at these points has suggested to some that the F-C dichotomy represents darkness/light.|$|E

Based on data on the strategic planning systems and processes of over 200 North American companies, key systems design and contextual factors associated with effective planning are identified. It was found that dissatisfaction with formal strategic planning is not as widespread among practicing managers as is widely alleged. The degree of fulfillment of <b>key</b> <b>planning</b> objectives varies widely not only from company to company but also from objective to objective. Overall, the creativity and control orientation of the system and its level of functional integration were found to be the principal design factors contributing to the effectiveness of a strategic planning system. ...|$|R

A hierarchical optimized combination evaluation model is proposed, and its progressiveness and applicability are verified. The study provides theoretical basis and practical evidence for judging the development level of regional smart grid construction of China from an overall and multi-angle perspective. 1...|$|E
