60|$|Next came M. d'Aubepine, poor young man, {{with the}} air of {{reckless}} dissipation that sat so ill on a face still so youthful, and a still more ridiculous affectation of worldly wisdom. He tried to argue me into it by assuring me that the Prince would henceforth be all- powerful in France, and that M. de Lamont was his protege, and that I was not consulting my own interest, those of my son, or of my family, by my refusal. When he found this ineffectual, he assured me peremptorily {{that it was the}} Prince's will, to which I replied, 'That may be, Monsieur, but it is not mine,' to which he replied that I was Mademoiselle, but that I should repent it. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>M.</b> le Prince was not King of France, and I trusted that he never would be, so that I did not see why I should be bound to obey his will and pleasure. At which he looked so much as if I were uttering blasphemy that I could not help laughing. I really believe, poor fellow, that M. le Prince was more than a king to him, the god of his idolatry, and that all his faults might be traced to his blind worship and imitation.|$|E

[...] "To-morrow night you play Scaramouche. You are ready enough in your wits, your figure is ideal, and you have {{just the kind of}} mordant humour for the part. You should be a great success." ...|$|R
60|$|Awhile ago <b>I</b> <b>said</b> that <b>M.</b> Bourget's {{method of}} truth-seeking--hunting {{for it in}} out-of-the-way places--was new; but that was an error. I {{remember}} that when Leverrier discovered the Milky Way, {{he and the other}} astronomers began to theorize about it in substantially the same fashion which M. Bourget employs in his seasonings about American social facts and their origin. Leverrier advanced the hypothesis that the Milky Way was caused by gaseous protoplasmic emanations from the field of Waterloo, which, ascending to an altitude determinable by their own specific gravity, became luminous through the development and exposure--by the natural processes of animal decay--of the phosphorus contained in them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>I</b> <b>said</b> that 'Rosie <b>M.</b> Banks' {{was your}} pen-name, and you didn't want it {{generally}} known, {{because you were}} a modest, retiring sort of chap. He'll listen to you now. Absolutely hang on your words. A brightish idea, what? I doubt if Jeeves in person could have thought up a better one than that. Well, pitch it strong, old lad, and keep steadily before you the fact that I must have my allowance raised. I can't possibly marry on what I've got now. If this film is to end with the slow fade-out on the embrace, at least double is indicated. Well, that's that. Cheerio!" ...|$|R

2500|$|I {{thought it}} was a Trekkie, and so <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> 'Sure.' <b>I</b> looked across the room, and there was Dr. Martin Luther King walking towards me with this big grin on his face. He reached out to me and <b>said,</b> 'Yes, <b>Ms.</b> Nichols, <b>I</b> am your {{greatest}} fan.' He said that Star Trek was the only show that he, and his wife Coretta, would allow their three little children to stay up and watch. [...] I never got to tell him why, because he said, 'You can't. You're part of history.' ...|$|R

5000|$|I met Stan {{the first}} time when I was looking for work at Timely[...] [...] [...] I came in, being {{somewhat}} young and cocky at the time, and Stan asked me what <b>I</b> did. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> penciled; he <b>said,</b> 'What else?' <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> inked. He <b>said,</b> 'What else?' <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> 'Color.' 'Do anything else?' <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> 'Yeah, <b>I</b> letter, too.' He said, 'Do you print the damn books, too?' I guess he was about two or three years my junior at that point. I think I was about 21 or 22.|$|R

I came over as quite affable in a way, which served me well, but I wasn't confident," [...] {{admitted}} Davison. [...] "I think I lied about {{every aspect of}} playing the part. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> smoked; I didn't smoke. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> drank; I didn't drink. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> knew a bit about animals; didn't know anything about animals." ...|$|R

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> {{was very}} well, and hoped he was. I was {{sufficiently}} ill at ease, Heaven knows; {{but it was}} not in my nature to complain much at that time of my life, so <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> was very well, and hoped he was.|$|R

50|$|Well, {{the other}} day when I was out walking, I met my cousin Josef from Muck Meadow. I couldn't {{understand}} what was wrong, why he wasn't working, 'cause he'd been working for several years for that big farmer over at Sweet Ridge, so I asked him if he wasn't working there anymore. No, he <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> quit, he <b>said.</b> Really? You quit? <b>I</b> <b>said.</b> Yes, he <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> quit, he <b>said.</b> Oh, <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> but why did you quit? <b>I</b> <b>said.</b> Well, he said, the food got so bad, he <b>said.</b> Really, <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> the food got so bad? <b>I</b> <b>said.</b> Yes, he said, the food got so bad, he <b>said,</b> so <b>I</b> had to quit, he said. You see, he said, first the big cow died, he said, and then we had to eat her up, he said; {{and then all of a}} sudden the big sow died, and then we had to eat her up, he said. But, he said, finally the farmer's wife died, he said, and — that's when <b>I</b> quit! he <b>said.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Right ho, Jeeves. So {{much for}} that, then. Now here's {{something}} else: You noticed that <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> {{was going to}} put this project through tomorrow, and no doubt you wondered why <b>I</b> <b>said</b> tomorrow. Why did I, Jeeves?" ...|$|R
