40|$|The European Economic Community treaty defines {{indirect}} taxation common rules {{taking into consideration}} their impact upon free merchandiseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s circulation and upon international commercial exchanges. Once the Roma treaty has been signed (1957) the established scope was creating a common market. But, {{how is it possible}} to create a common market without any monetary and fiscal instruments? Thus, these instruments have had to be created in order to achieve such an objective. If from the monetary point of view introducing euro as a common currency was a big step ahead, from the fiscal point of view things havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t evolved in such an easy manner. Fiscal objectives are achieved only if the national market is running normally and correctly. Indirect taxation is <b>harmonized</b> <b>base</b> upon article 113 from the European Union Treaty, while regarding direct taxation legal recommendations and regulations approval we canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t talk about harmonization but about fiscal competition. We are stating this because there are 27 states in the European Union and each one is sustaining its own direct taxation system. Furthermore, the taxation system (fiscal system) is influencing member states economical performances through economies, investments and human capital formation by affecting the revenueÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s distribution, research and development expenses level and type and by fiscal competition Ã¢â‚¬â€œ an effect more and more profound. In this context we aim at analyzing the way fiscal competition had had a positive impact upon attracting foreign direct investments in Romania and Poland. We also aim at underlining positive and negative points for fiscal competition taking into consideration that not only a decrease in micro or macro-economic fiscal burden will have a positive impact upon investments in-flows and there are other factors to be taken into consideration, like: infrastructure, labor expenses, research and development expenses, internet access, etc. The research is mainly based upon a synthesis of the reached area in the special literature.

40|$|Wolof is a Senegambian {{language}} of Senegal that displays vowel harmony. The vowel harmony system was previously analyzed by Omar Ka on an autosegmental level. Wolof vowels <b>harmonize</b> <b>based</b> upon the feature [ATR]. Harmonization reaches across morpheme and word boundaries. However, there are both neutral and opaque vowels in Wolof. Neutral vowels do not harmonize, but still allow the harmonization process to continue beyond them. Opaque vowels block harmonization. These features are analyzed using Optimality Theory. Two sets of constraints, agreement constraints and alignment constraints, are generally invoked {{in cases of}} vowel harmony. In Wolof, agreement constraints do not give the correct output when considering opaque vowels. Alignment constraints, however, account for normal vowel harmony, neutral vowels, and opaque vowels.

40|$|A unified {{approach}} for modelling shelter needs and health impacts caused by earthquake damage which integrates social vulnerability into the physical systems modelling approaches has been developed. The shelter needs and health impact models discussed here brings together the state-of-the-art social loss estimation models into a comprehensive modelling approach based on multi-criteria decision support, which provides decision makers with a dynamic platform to capture post-disaster emergency shelter demand and health impact decisions. The {{focus in the}} shelter needs model is to obtain shelter demand {{as a consequence of}} building usability, building habitability and social vulnerability of the affected population rather than building damage alone. The shelter model simulates households' decision-making and considers physical, socio-economic, climatic, spatial and temporal factors in addition to modelled building damage states (input from WP 3 and WP 5). The health impact model combines a new semi-empirical methodology for casualty estimation with models of health impact vulnerability, transportation accessibility and healthcare capacity to obtain a holistic assessment of health impacts in the emergency period after earthquakes.

This QWoE-methodology {{was applied to the}} reproductive toxicity data on diisononylphthalate (DINP), di-n-hexylphthalate (DnHP), and dicyclohexylphthalate (DCHP) to determine if the scientific evidence for adverse effects meets the requirements for classification as reproductive toxicants. The scores for DINP were compared to those when applying the methodology DCHP and DnHP that have <b>harmonized</b> classifications. <b>Based</b> on the quality/reliability scores, application of the QWoE shows that the three databases are of similar quality; but effect scores differ widely. Application of QWoE to DINP studies resulted in an overall score well below the benchmark required to trigger classification. For DCHP, the QWoE also results in low scores. The high scores from the application of the QWoE methodology to the toxicological data for DnHP represent clear evidence for adverse effects and justify a classification of DnHP as category 1 B for both development and fertility.

In spite of their great potential, the system capacity is highly susceptible to network density because a large portion of users are exposed to inter-cell interference (ICI). In this work, we proposed a dynamic interference avoidance scheme in densely deployed cell environments. Our proposed distributed dynamic ICI avoidance (DDIA) scheme not only works in a fully distributed manner but also controls interference link connectivity of users with high agility so that it is suited for self-organizing networks (SONs). We introduced the concept of ICI-link and two-tier scheduling in designing the DDIA scheme. To avoid ICI without any central entity, our scheme tries to <b>harmonize</b> all <b>base</b> stations (BSs) with users adaptively. Through extensive simulations, it was shown that our proposed scheme improves the throughput of the users by more than twice on average compared to the frequency reuse factor 1 scheme, who are exposed to ICI, while maintaining or even improving overall network performance.

40|$|On {{par with}} {{globalization}} logistics has evolved {{both in terms}} of the range of activities it involves as well as over its geography. What used to be labeled global logistics was mainly a collection of separate national strategies since it was cumbersome to manage production and distribution over different jurisdictions. Global logistics was mainly the organization of flows of raw materials and finished goods for markets where such goods were not readily available. This environment has irremediably changed from the 1980 s as corporations were able to seek various input cost reductions through global sourcing practices as well as expanded market opportunities. Multinational enterprises (MNE) have adopted flexible organization structures on a global scale with an extensive network of globally dispersed inputs.

Such studies are typically reliant on assay procedures to measure reliable and comparable levels of 25 -hydroxyvitamin D [25 (OH) D] concentrations. Methods: Concentrations of 25 (OH) D₃ and 25 (OH) D₂ were measured using LC-MS/MS in 5, 915 participants (aged 31  years) of Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966. Blood samples were assayed in batches over a course of 18  months. As anomalies {{were present in the}} measurements, 200 samples were reassayed using Diasorin RIA. Agreement between measurements was assessed by Passing–Bablok regression and limits of agreement (LoA). To harmonize LC-MS/MS with Diasorin RIA measurements, formulae were derived from the LoA. Results: Concentrations measured by LC-MS/MS were much higher than those measured by Diasorin RIA, with a mean difference of 12. 9  ng/ml. Constant variation was evident between batch measurements after log transformation. Statistical formula was applied separately for each batch of LC-MS/MS measurements, enabling us to remove both the constant and proportional bias that was evident prior to the transformation. Conclusion: Despite the introduction of schemes/programs to improve accuracy of assays to measure 25 (OH) D, significant differences can still happen. In these instances, methods to <b>harmonize</b> measurements <b>based</b> on {{a relatively small number of}} replicates can be successfully applied to establish confidence and to enable between-study comparisons...|$|R

In the field of pleasure motor yachts, in particular for those of significant dimensions and intended for the commercial use, the design constraints are prescribed in the “MCA Code of Practice”. The compliance with the MCA code is appropriate up to twelve passengers onboard. Due to the enlarging phenomena of ship size in this portion of market, the designers are now considering to comply directly with the SOLAS requirements for passenger ships, eliminating at the same time the twelve passengers limitation.

Methods AMANHI takes advantage of on–going population–based cohort studies covering approximately 2 million women of reproductive age with 1 – to 3 –monthly pregnancy surveillance to enrol pregnant women. Morbidity information is collected at five follow–up home visits – three during the antenatal period at 24 – 28 weeks, 32 – 36 weeks and 37 + weeks of pregnancy and two during the postpartum period at 1 – 6 days and after 42 – 60 days after birth. Structured– questionnaires are used to collect self–reported maternal morbidities including hemorrhage, hypertensive disorders, infections, difficulty in labor and obstetric fistula, as well as care–seeking for these morbidities and outcomes for mothers and babies. Additionally, structured questionnaires are used to interview birth attendants who attended women’s deliveries. All protocols were harmonised across the sites including training, implementation and operationalising definitions for maternal morbidities.

40|$|The {{continuous}} {{increase of}} accident and incident reports has indicated {{the potential of}} drones to threaten public safety. The published regulatory framework for small drones is not visibly based on a comprehensive hazard analysis. Also, a variety in the constraints imposed by different regulatory frameworks across the globe might impede market growth and render small-drone operations even more complicated since light drones might be easily transferred and operated in various regions with diverse restrictions. In our study we applied the Systems-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) method to small-drone operations and we generated a first set of Safety Requirements (SR) for the authority, manufacturer, end-user and automation levels. Under {{the scope of this}} paper, we reviewed 56 drone regulations published by different authorities, and performed (1) a gap analysis against the 57 SRs derived by STPA for the authority level, and (2) Intra-Class Correlations in order to examine the extent of their harmonization.

The harmonization is even lower when considering the range of values of various SRs addressed by the authorities.

40|$|The {{implementation}} of the Water Framework Directive requires EU member states to establish and harmonize ecological status class boundaries for biological quality elements. In this paper, we describe an approach for defining ecological class boundaries that delineates shifts in lake ecosystem functioning and, therefore, provides ecologically meaningful targets for water policy in Europe. We collected an extensive data set of 810 lake-years from nine Central European countries, and we used phytoplankton chlorophyll a, a metric widely {{used to measure the}} impact of eutrophication in lakes. Our approach establishes chlorophyll a target values in relation to three significant ecological effects of eutrophication: the decline of aquatic macrophytes, the dominance of potentially harmful cyanobacteria and the major functional switch from a clear water to a turbid state. Ranges of threshold chlorophyll a concentrations are given for the two most common lake types in lowland Central Europe: for moderately deep lakes (mean depth 3 - 15 m), the greatest ecological shifts occur in the range 10 - 12 mu gL(- 1) chlorophyll a, and for shallow lakes (< 3 m mean depth), in the range 21 - 23 mu gL(- 1) chlorophyll a. Synthesis and applications. Our study provides class boundaries for determining the ecological status of lakes, which have robust ecological consequences for lake functioning and which, therefore, provide strong and objective targets for sustainable water management in Europe.

30|$|One of {{the most}} popular {{macroscopic}} traffic flow models is the two equation model developed by Payne [15] and Whitham [16] which is known as the Payne-Whitham (PW) model. The first equation is based on the continuity equation for the conservation of vehicles on a road, while the second models the acceleration behavior of traffic based on driver anticipation and relaxation. Driver anticipation results from the presumption of changes in the forward traffic density, while relaxation is the tendency to adjust velocity based on traffic conditions. The relaxation time can be considered the transition time. The PW model {{is based on the assumption}} that vehicles on a road have similar behavior. Smooth traffic velocities and density distributions are employed [17], and alignment (harmonization) occurs with a constant velocity [18]. Unfortunately, this results in unrealistic velocity and density behavior [19]. Zhang improved the PW model using the fact that driver anticipation cannot be constant [20], and considered that drivers <b>harmonize</b> their speeds <b>based</b> on the density distribution. However, this model can produce unrealistic results in some traffic flow situations.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{two major}} issues {{that need to}} be treated as matters of urgency. First, internal (within country) migrations in the Asian (ACI) region are mostly undocumented and large. It is shown there are significant differences in wages and human development measures to which migrants will respond. Our first (of two) recommendation(s) is the need to collect better information on migration and for wage premiums and discounts to be estimated across sectors and countries. The second major issue is the emerging demographic imbalances in the form of aging, which will give dependency ratios that have never been experienced in all of recorded human existence. This needs urgent attention and the development of appropriate migration policies. Whilst it is possible to share the burdens of ageing and dependency through migration, this will not happen under present arrangements. Migration cannot continue to be treated differently to trade and finance. A framework needs to be developed to provide a coherent set of policies relating to migration and social welfare, within and across countries in the Asian region. Our second recommendation is for the East Asia Summit (ASEAN+ 10) to set up a high level working group to consider possible future <b>harmonized</b> migration <b>based</b> policies, bringing together relevant economic, political, social and legal issues. This should encompass the recent ASEAN leadership on the rights of migrant workers and labor work programs.

40|$|Multi-risk environments are {{characterized}} by domino effects that often amplify the overall risk. Those include chains of hazardous events and increasing vulnerability, among other types of correlations within the risk process. The recently developed methods for multi-hazard and risk assessment integrate interactions between different risks by using <b>harmonized</b> procedures <b>based</b> on common metrics. While the products of these assessments, such as multi-hazard and -risk indexes, maps, cascade scenarios, or warning systems provide innovative and effective information, they also pose specific challenges to policy makers and practitioners due to their novel cross-disciplinary aspects. In this paper we discuss the institutional barriers {{to the adoption of}} multi-risk approaches, summarizing the results of the fieldwork conducted in Italy and Guadeloupe and of workshops with disaster risk reduction practitioners from eleven European countries. Results show the need for a clear identification of responsibilities for the implementation of multi-risk approaches, as institutional frameworks for risk reduction remain to this day primarily single-risk centered. Authorities are rarely officially responsible for the management of domino effects between e. g., tsunamis and industrial accidents, earthquake and landslides, floods and electricity network failures. Other barriers for the implementation of multi-risk approaches include the limited measures to reduce exposure at the household level, inadequate financial capacities at the local level and limited public-private partnerships, especially in case of interactions between natural and industrial risks. Adapting the scale of institutions to that of multi-risk environments remains a major challenge to better mainstream multi-risk approaches into policy. To address it, we propose a multirisk governance framework, which includes the phases of observation, social and institutional context analysis, generation of multi-risk knowledge and stakeholder engagement processes. Yet, more research is needed in order to test the framework and to identify the hallmark characteristics of effective multi-risk governance...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) has invalidated many {{income tax}} law {{provisions}} of European Union (EU) member states as violating European constitutional treaty guarantees {{of freedom of}} movement for goods, services, persons, and capital. These decisions have not, however, been matched by significant EU income tax legislation, because no EU political institution {{has the power to}} enact such legislation without unanimous consent from the member states. In this Article, we describe how the developing ECJ jurisprudence threatens the ability of member states to use tax incentives to stimulate their domestic economies and to resolve problems of international double taxation. We conclude that the ECJ approach is ultimately incoherent because it is a quest for an unattainable goal in the absence of <b>harmonized</b> income tax <b>bases</b> and rates: to eliminate discrimination based on both origin and destination of economic activity. We also compare the ECJ 2 ̆ 7 s jurisprudence with the resolution of related issues in international taxation and the U. S. taxation of interstate commerce, and we consider the potential responses of both the European Union and the United States to these developments...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the need for}} harmonizing the standards for accounting reporting by fully applying the principle of Accrual Based Accounting {{in the public sector}} in the EU member states. It also examines the discrepancy between the accountancy in the public sector, based on the cash flow principle (cash basis) and the Accrual Based principle applied in the process of budgetary surveillance in the EU (ESA 95, 2011). The emphasis is laid on the strong dependency of the statistical information at the European level {{on the quality of the}} accounting and information basis of public finances and on Eurostat’s willingness to create a system of <b>harmonized</b> accounting standards, <b>based</b> on the Accrual Based accounting, which are in compliance with ÅSA and applicable to all agents in the State Management sector. This paper further {{analyzes the}} standardization of the accounting in the public sector of the EU member states and globally and presents some trends of its development. The conclusion is reached that IPSAS are an indisputable staring point to develop harmonized reports in the EU public sector. IPSAS provide the best basic framework for the development of a set of European Public Sector Accounting Standards.
