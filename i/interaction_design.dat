25|$|The {{accident}} {{began with}} {{failures in the}} non-nuclear secondary system, followed by a stuck-open pilot-operated relief valve in the primary system, which allowed large amounts of nuclear reactor coolant to escape. The mechanical failures were compounded by the initial failure of plant operators to recognize the situation as a loss-of-coolant accident due to inadequate training and human factors, such as human-computer <b>interaction</b> <b>design</b> oversights relating to ambiguous control room indicators in the power plant's user interface. In particular, a hidden indicator light led to an operator manually overriding the automatic emergency cooling system of the reactor because the operator mistakenly believed that {{there was too much}} coolant water present in the reactor and causing the steam pressure release.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{noted the}} game's unadorned nature. Edge called it [...] "handsomely austere", [...] "modish", and [...] "elegant". Dan Ryckert of Game Informer complimented its simplicity, and The Guardian Stuart Dredge found the game's minimalism [...] "stylish" [...] and its {{gameplay}} [...] "genuinely hypnotic". Eurogamer Dan Whitehead said {{the game was}} [...] "basically interactive porn for graphic designers". Nissa Campbell from TouchArcade wrote that its red, gray, and black graphics were [...] "striking" [...] albeit not flashy, and that the game was interesting [...] "visually, aurally, and mechanically". In a piece for The Atlantic, Ian Bogost wrote that its game, visual, and <b>interaction</b> <b>design</b> [...] "embodied an elegant minimalism" [...] akin to the Bauhausian aesthetic promoted by Apple. He added that Hundreds had cultural cachet [...] "unprecedented" [...] in the medium of video games and {{similar to that of}} other design objects—that the game was closer to Prada or a lobby bar than to Angry Birds. Bogost felt that it required an amount of attention unlike other [...] "time-waster" [...] mobile games, and referred to the precarious strategies required to complete some levels as a [...] "multi-touch ballet".|$|E

While there are many investigations of <b>interaction</b> <b>designs</b> for networked technologies, most research utilises small exercises, workshops or other short-term studies to investigate <b>interaction</b> <b>designs.</b> However, we have found these short-term methods to be ineffective in the context of understanding local community interaction. Moreover we find that people are resistant to putting their time into workshops and exercises, understandably so because these are academic practices, not local community practices. Our contribution is to detail a long term embedded design approach in which we interact with the community over the long term in the course of normal community goings-on with an evolving exploratory prototype.

Common topics of <b>interaction</b> <b>design</b> include design, human-computer interaction, and software development. While <b>interaction</b> <b>design</b> {{has an interest in}} form (similar to other design fields), its main area of focus rests on behavior.

40|$|We use inverse {{methods of}} {{statistical}} mechanics and computer simulations {{to investigate whether}} an isotropic <b>interaction</b> <b>designed</b> to stabilize a given two-dimensional (2 D) lattice will also favor an analogous three-dimensional (3 D) structure, and vice versa.

We find a remarkable `transferability' of isotropic potentials designed to stabilize analogous morphologies in 2 D and 3 D, irrespective of the exact interaction form, and we discuss the basis of this cross-dimensional behavior. Our results suggest that the discovery of interactions that drive assembly into certain 3 D periodic structures of interest can be assisted by less computationally intensive optimizations targeting the analogous 2 D lattices.
