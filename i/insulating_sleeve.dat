The optimum insulator sleeve length corresponds to the conditions for uniform discharge development and its take off across the insulator sleeve surface.

40|$|Multi-composite wire" is a {{new type}} of strong wire for winding coils to {{generate}} very strong-pulsed magnetic fields. The basic concept is filling the free spaces in a bundle of thin conducting wires with reinforcing fibres, and enclosing this composite wire in an <b>insulating</b> <b>sleeve.</b> In this concept, any desired combination of conductor and reinforcement can be used. To insulate the wire and keep the bundle together, a sleeve consisting of a strong insulating fibre is braided around the core. As a proof of principle, multi-composite wires have been made consisting of soft copper in combination with carbon fibres. Glass fibre was employed for the sleeve. The mechanical properties of the wires were determined from tensile and "explo-vessel" tests. The latter allows the investigation of the mechanical properties under conditions as they prevail in a coil. The first experimental wire had up to 88 % of the theoretically calculated UTS. Further development is discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The Multi-Composite (MC) wire is a {{new concept}} {{in the pursuit of}} obtaining the ideal {{conductor}} for high performance pulsed magnets. The MC wire consists of a braided, <b>insulating</b> <b>sleeve</b> enclosing a bundle of thin wires: conductor (Cu, CuNb) and reinforcement (e. g., high strength steel), with all free spaces filled by a tight packing of high strength fibers that {{do not need to be}} insulating (e. g., carbon fibers).

This concept allows winding around a small bore and much flexibility: the composition and geometry of the MC core can be varied even along the length of a continuous wire-to obtain the desired properties of strength and electrical conductivity. Prototype MC wires were made with soft Cu and carbon as core materials, with ultimate tensile strength of 1. 2 GPa and 1. 7 GPa and conductivity of 38 % IACS at 300 K.

40|$|OAK-B 135 Recent {{calibration}} {{shots in}} which full toroidal field (TF) coil current interacted with the maximum poloidal field coils have produced increased lateral loads {{on the outer}} sections of the TF-coil. The increased lateral loads have resulted in deflections that have been sufficient to cause the TF-coil to contact adjacent equipment and produce a transient short to ground within the coil. The six outer turns of each TF-coil bundle are clamped together by insulated preloaded studs to provide increased bending stiffness. These sections of the outer bundles depend on friction to react the lateral loads as a bundle rather than six individual turns. A major {{concern is that the}} increased loads will produce slip between turns resulting in excessive lateral deflections and possible damage to the <b>insulating</b> <b>sleeve</b> on the preloaded studs. A finite element structural model of the TF-coil was developed for the calculation of deflections and the shear load distribution throughout the coil for the applied lateral loads from a full current calibration shot. The purpose of the updated structural model is to correlate the applied lateral loads to the total shear force between the unbonded sections of the outer turns. An allowable integrated lateral load applied to the outer turns is established based on the maximum shear force that can be reacted by friction. A program that calculates the magnetic fields and integrated lateral load along the outer turns can be incorporated into the plasma control system. The integrated load can then be compared to the calculated allowable value prior to execution of calibration shots. Calibration shots with a calculated total lateral load greater than the allowable value will be prevented...|$|E
