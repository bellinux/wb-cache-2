40|$|Aquatic macroinvertebrates are {{affected}} by physical, chemical and biological conditions of the stream. Some of them are pollution-sensitive while others are pollution-tolerant. They are good indicators of stream health. This {{study was conducted to}} determine the status of Labo and Clarin Rivers using macroinvertebrates as bioindicators. Dip-net and kick-net methods were employed. Results showed that sampling sites in forested areas in Labo and Clarin rivers had a higher macroinvertebrate taxa richness and abundance. Mayflies (Ephemeroptera) were the dominant macroinvertebrates. Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT) and %EPT indices were higher in Clarin than Labo River. Based on Family-level biotic index (FBI), the water quality of sampling site 1 in Clarin (forested site) was excellent (organic pollution is unlikely) and very good (possible slight organic pollution) for site 1 in the Labo River but decreased <b>downstream</b> (<b>fair</b> to good quality). MANOVA results revealed {{a significant difference in the}} macroinvertebrate abundance in the agricultural sites of Labo River and forest sites of Clarin River. Cluster analysis showed that among the macroinvertebrates, mayflies (Ephemeroptera) were distinct in the forest sites and bugs (Hemiptera) in agricultural sites on Clarin River. Fly larvae (Diptera) and beetles (Coleoptera) were distinct in agroforest sites of the Clarin River while abundant in agricultural sites on Labo River. Results indicate a need for monitoring and proper management of Labo an...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a computational {{investigation of the}} wake of the MEXICO rotor. The compressible multi-block solver of Liverpool University was employed, using a low-Mach scheme to account for the low-speed flow near the blade and in the wake. In this study, computations at wind speeds of 10, 15 and 24 [*]m[*]s[*]−[*] 1 were performed, and the three components of the velocity were compared against experimental data around the rotor blade up to one and a half rotor diameters <b>downstream.</b> Overall, <b>fair</b> agreement was obtained with the computational fluid dynamics showing good vortex conservation near the blade. Vorticity values revealed discontinuities in the wake at approximately 70 %R, where two different aerofoils with different zero-lift angles are blended. The results suggest that all-Mach schemes for compressible computational fluid dynamics methods can deliver good performance and accuracy over all wind speeds for flows around wind turbines, without the need to switch between incompressible and compressible flow methods...|$|R

The proposed method provides download bandwidth fair sharing among multiple data flows based on their upload per-flow rate limitation. We evaluate the current approach by controlling upload rate to obtain fair download bandwidth sharing {{for each of the}} flows in the link. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on physical test network. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach can successfully provide fair bandwidth distribution among multiple data flows and can be promising method for bandwidth management in the real data networks...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} guaranteed minimum price contracts between sub-groups of farmers and a fair trade manufacturer on the spot market price. We focus on the fair trade concept in the coffee supply chain as an example. We analyze a three level vertical chain gathering perfectly competitive farmers upstream who offer their raw product to manufacturers who then sell finished products to a <b>downstream</b> retailer. Without <b>fair</b> trade, all the raw product is sold on the spot market. When a sub-group of farmers benefit from a guaranteed minimum price contract offered by a fair trade certifier, we show that farmers outside of this fair trade agreement may also benefit from a higher spot market price in cases of a limited overproduction.

We analyze a three level vertical chain gathering perfectly competitive farmers upstream who offer their raw product on a spot market to manufacturers who then sell finished products to a <b>downstream</b> retailer. Absent <b>Fair</b> Trade, the entire raw product is sold on the spot market. When a Fair Trade organization offers a Fair Trade contract to a sub-group of farmers, it gathers a Guaranteed Minimum Price clause and a straight relationship between the sub-group of farmers and the retailer.

40|$|Over a fourteen-year {{period that}} began in 1990 and ended with the {{termination}} of the ACF and ACT Basin Compacts, the State of Georgia endeavored to develop with Alabama and Florida agreements that would guarantee the <b>downstream</b> States a <b>fair</b> and reasonable supply of water while safeguarding, to the maximum extent possible, Georgia’s flexibility to manage its waters {{for the benefit of}} all Georgians. From the perspective of Georgia’s negotiators, Georgia offered meaningful state-line stream flow guarantees and limitations on Georgia’s water use. Ultimately, the three States could not reach agreement. Nevertheless, the years of interstate and federal-state study, cooperation, and negotiation greatly advanced the level of knowledge regarding the water resources of the ACF and ACT Basins and could help provide the foundation for a future resolution of the disputes.

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{and experimental}} {{study has been}} carried out to acquire knowledge about the structure and stabilization mechanism of coflow flames in their transition to the Mild combustion regime. In total, three CH 4 /N 2 /oxidizer coflow flames have been studied with a systematic dilution and preheating of the fuel and coflow streams. These flames comprise the non-preheated case (Case NP), preheated case (Case P) and Mild case (Case M), diluted and preheated from ambient temperature up to 1530 K. Radial profiles of temperature and species concentrations have been measured using spontaneous Raman scattering. Detailed computations have been performed by steady-state simulations of these cases using detailed chemistry with the GRI 3. 0 mechanism and multicomponent mixture-averaged transport. Radiation effects are also included (except for Case M) in the detailed computations using an optically thin approximation. An overall good agreement has been found between results of the detailed computations and experiments for Case NP, Case P and at lower axial distances for Case M. The agreement for Case M far <b>downstream</b> is quite <b>fair</b> in which the computations predict lower temperatures. A comparison of computed temperature distributions indicates that the progressive preheating and dilution of the oxidizer and fuel leads to a reduction of the temperature rise in the reaction zone with respect to a non-reacting case; this rise in Case M is less than 200 K. Comparison of computed heat release and formaldehyde distributions reveals that stabilization of Case NP and P occurs by an edge flame, while for Case M, it takes place by autoignition. The importance of using multicomponent transport in the computations is investigated by performing additional computation assuming constant Schmidt numbers for all species. The results indicate that this assumption has a considerable effect on the predicted flame structure, especially at the centerline. Effects of radiative heat losses have been investigated by neglecting radiation in the computations. It turns out that these losses do not influence the predictions considerably, especially at lower axial distances; however, their effect slightly increases with increasing axial distance. When the results are plotted in mixture fraction space, the experimental and computational data at different heights are very well correlated and they collapse on one line for Case NP and P within the uncertainty of the measurements. However, such a correlation for Case M is not found at lower axial distances due to the incomplete combustion of the fuel/oxidizer mixture. Further investigations on the structure of Case M are done by flamelet analyses in mixture fraction space. It is found that igniting flamelets represent very well the structure of Case M at lower axial distances. This observation further emphasizes the stabilization of the Mild case by the autoignition phenomena...|$|R
40|$|RANS {{equations}} are nowadays {{widely used}} in industry because of their affordability in terms of computational costs. They reached {{a high level of}} complexity, as they involve systems of non-linear partial differential equations. However they still lack of generality as they are based on closure coefficients determined from fundamental real flow cases. Their accuracy drops when dealing with separating turbulent flows. There is a specific class of flows that separate after encountering a geometry-induced adverse pressure gradient. Periodic hill flows are viewed as the benchmark case of those, presenting typical gross features of this class of flows. The separation point is viewed as one of the characteristic features and its prediction is crucial for a <b>fair</b> <b>downstream</b> flow development representation. In literature it was found that different turbulence models produced different flow solutions, as both separation and reattachment points were badly reproduced. The aim of the project is therefore to reconstruct the solution under uncertainty in separation location and turbulence closure coefficients. A statistical calibration of the uncertain parameters is performed using Bayesian inference; then Markov Chain Monte Carlo Method (MCMC) is adopted to explore the a posteriori information. The separation location is controlled using a step, that, located in the area of adverse pressure gradient, forces the flow to separate. The geometry parameters of the step are considered as the uncertain parameters to be calibrated. The effect of separation forcing on the flow solution is studied when adopting different turbulence models. A strong coupling between the step influence on flow solution and closure model adopted has been found. Because of this, Launder-Sharma k-epsilon model was employed {{for the rest of the}} work. The calibration of turbulence model coefficients have been performed starting from existing works. After providing some validated data relative to a particular location of the flow field and performing parameters calibration, the entire field is reconstructed through posterior predictive distribution. In general it was found that the results of the calibration depend strictly on the location where the inverse problem is performed. The calibrated value are able to reproduce the flow solution at the inverse problem location but unable to accurately predict the solution at different locations. The calibration of the closure coefficients only, resulted in a fair prediction of the reattachment point, but a bad representation of the separation point. The inclusion of the step resulted in a slightly better representation of the flow when moving away from the inverse problem location, with particular reference to the vertical velocity profile. This proved that the influence of turbulence closure coefficients is predominant. The analysis is conducted focusing on the velocity profiles. In fact the eventual aim is to start from planar PIV data and post process them for a three-dimensional flow field reconstruction. Because of a future application in real three dimensional cases and the possible high-dimensionality of the uncertain parameter space, a mathematical tool to be used during MCMC iterations is developed. Instead of calling the CFD solver at each MCMC iteration, the flow solution is computed offline through model reduction techniques. POD + I and Isomap + I have been tested for this purpose; the first one being used for linear spaces and the second for the non-linear ones. At the end Isomap + I was also used for examining the intrinsic metric of the flow solution space when varying the turbulence closure coefficients and the step parameters. The model reduction techniques seemed to work well and this allowed to perform the calibration at cheap computational costs...|$|R
