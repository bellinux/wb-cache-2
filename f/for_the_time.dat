Later in the year, he would be awarded a Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for his leadership during the Battle of Crete.|$|E

5|$|Bahá'í {{notions of}} {{progressive}} religious revelation result in their accepting {{the validity of}} the well known religions of the world, whose founders and central figures are seen as Manifestations of God. Religious history is interpreted as a series of dispensations, where each manifestation brings a somewhat broader and more advanced revelation that is rendered as a text of scripture and passed on through history with greater or lesser reliability but at least true in substance, suited <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> and place in which it was expressed. Specific religious social teachings (for example, the direction of prayer, or dietary restrictions) may be revoked by a subsequent manifestation so that a more appropriate requirement <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> and place may be established. Conversely, certain general principles (for example, neighbourliness, or charity) are seen to be universal and consistent. In Bahá'í belief, this process of progressive revelation will not end; it is, however, believed to be cyclical. Bahá'ís do not expect a new manifestation of God to appear within 1000 years of Bahá'u'lláh's revelation.|$|E
5|$|Beese {{introduced}} Winehouse to his boss, Nick Gatfield, and the Island head {{shared his}} enthusiasm in signing the young artist. Winehouse was signed to Island, as rival interest in Winehouse {{had started to}} build to include representatives of EMI and Virgin starting to make moves. Beese told HitQuarters that he felt the reason behind the excitement, over an artist who was an atypical pop star <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> was due to a backlash against reality TV music shows, which included audiences starved for fresh, genuine young talent.|$|E
5|$|Convinced {{the book}} would be popular, Jewett made the unusual {{decision}} (<b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>time)</b> to have six full-page illustrations by Hammatt Billings engraved {{for the first}} printing. Published in book form on March 20, 1852, the novel sold 3,000 copies on that day alone, and soon sold out its complete print run. A number of other editions were soon printed (including a deluxe edition in 1853, featuring 117 illustrations by Billings).|$|E

5|$|Coonhounds existed as a {{distinct}} type by the mid-to-late 1800s.

5|$|Eastwood then {{branched}} out {{to star in}} the only musical of his career, Paint Your Wagon (1969). Eastwood and Lee Marvin play gold miners who buy a Mormon settler's less favored wife (Jean Seberg) at an auction. Bad weather and delays plagued the production, and the film's budget eventually exceeded $20million, which was extremely expensive <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> The film was not a critical or commercial success, although it {{was nominated for a}} Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture– Musical or Comedy.|$|E

5|$|Goebbels' efforts {{had little}} impact <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> being, as while Hitler was in {{principle}} {{in favour of}} total war, he {{was not prepared to}} implement changes over the objections of his ministers.

5|$|Imagist {{publications}} appearing between 1914 and 1917 featured {{works by}} many of the most prominent modernist figures in poetry and other fields.

5|$|In 1789, Sally and James Hemings {{returned}} to the United States with Jefferson. He was 46 years old and seven years a widower. As shown by Jefferson's father-in-law, John Wayles, wealthy Virginia widowers frequently raped enslaved women. Historian Joshua D. Rothman noted {{it was not unusual}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> for Jefferson to choose to do so. White society simply expected these men to be discreet.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, Ford {{tried to}} revive the Continental brand as a {{standalone}} line of ultra luxury automobiles, but abandoned the attempt after the 1957 model year, by which time around 3000 Mark II cars had been built.

5|$|It was {{believed}} that selective pressure, controlled by Washington, combined with diplomatic overtures, would prevail and compel Hanoi to end its aggression.
