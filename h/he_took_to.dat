To this end, he joined the YMCA and football club Blau und Weiss. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>to</b> playing for the football club with enthusiasm, but the YMCA activities did not interest him to the same extent.|$|E

40|$|In {{his book}} Metaepistemology and Skepticism, Richard Fumerton formulates a "principle of {{inferential}} justification" which <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> be fundamental to our practice of {{reflection on the}} epistemic status of our beliefs and which <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> provide the basis of some powerful skeptical arguments. After introducing Fumerton's principle and the role it is given in skeptical arguments, the paper argues {{that it does not}} have the force that he claims...|$|R
5|$|Andronikos {{began his}} reign well; in particular, the {{measures}} <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>to</b> reform {{the government of}} the empire have been praised by historians. In the provinces, Andronikos' reforms produced a speedy and marked improvement. Andronikos's fierce determination to root out corruption and many other abuses was admirable; under Andronikos, the sale of offices ceased; selection was based on merit, rather than favouritism; officials were paid an adequate salary so as to reduce the temptation of bribery. Every form of corruption was eliminated with ferocious zeal.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from some}} western troupes' 19th-century visits, the first {{professional}} performance of Hamlet in Japan was Otojirō Kawakami's 1903 Shimpa ("new school theatre") adaptation. Tsubouchi Shōyō translated Hamlet {{and produced a}} performance in 1911 that blended Shingeki ("new drama") and Kabuki styles. This hybrid-genre reached its peak in Tsuneari Fukuda's 1955 Hamlet. In 1998, Yukio Ninagawa produced an acclaimed version of Hamlet {{in the style of}} Nō theatre, which <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>to</b> London.|$|E
5|$|Because of his {{involvement}} with the Pinochet government, there were international protests when Friedman was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1976. Friedman was accused of supporting the military dictatorship in Chile because of the relation of economists of the University of Chicago to Pinochet, and a controversial seven-day trip <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>to</b> Chile during March 1975 (less {{than two years after}} the coup that deposed President Salvador Allende). Friedman answered that he never was an adviser to the dictatorship, but only gave some lectures and seminars on inflation, and met with officials, including Augusto Pinochet, while in Chile.|$|E

5|$|Campbell {{was born}} in Newark, New Jersey in 1910. His father was a cold, impersonal, and unaffectionate {{electrical}} engineer. His mother, Dorothy (née Strahern) was warm but changeable of character and had an identical twin who visited them often and who disliked young John. John was unable to tell them apart and was frequently coldly rebuffed by the person <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>to</b> be his mother.|$|E
5|$|Ezra Pound {{is really}} at heart a very boyish fellow and an incurable provincial. It {{is true that}} he was driven to Europe by a thirst for romance and color that he could {{scarcely}} have satisfied in America, but <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>to</b> Europe the simple faith and pure enthusiasm of his native Idaho.... His sophistication is still juvenile, his ironies are still clumsy and obvious, he ridicules Americans in Europe not very much simpler than himself...|$|E
5|$|In 1870 Brassey {{was told}} that he had cancer but he {{continued}} to visit his working sites. One of his last visits was to the Wolverhampton and Walsall Railway, only a few miles from his first railway contract at Penkridge. In the late summer of 1870 <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>to</b> his bed at his home in St Leonards-on-Sea. There he was visited by members of his work force, not only his engineers and agents, but also his navvies, many of whom had walked for days to come and pay their respects.|$|E

5|$|In Retford, MacMillan was {{introduced}} to ballet by a local dance teacher, Jean Thomas. He had already had lessons in Scottish dancing in Dunfermline and tap dancing in Great Yarmouth, and <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>to</b> ballet immediately. In 1942 his mother died, which caused him acute and lasting distress. His father was a distant figure, and the boy's only close family relationship was with an elder sister. His obituarist in The Times suggests that {{the feeling of being}} an outsider, displayed in many of MacMillan's ballets, had its roots in his childhood.|$|E
5|$|Robben {{was born}} in Bedum, a {{satellite}} town of Groningen, in the northeastern Netherlands. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>to</b> football from an early age, becoming an adherent of the Coerver Method. Robben's skill in ball control and technical footwork made him a valuable player, and he was quickly signed by regional club FC Groningen. Here, he developed his distinctive style of cutting inside from the right onto his left foot to score some quite spectacular goals.|$|E
5|$|A corrupt {{political}} leader named Chedi Singh (Sonu Sood) meets Chulbul and both quickly become enemies. Makkhi asks {{his father to}} arrange his marriage with Nirmala. His father refuses because he needs money to repay the loans <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>to</b> make his factory, and he believes that he can acquire money through his son marrying a rich girl. In desperate need of money, Makkhi steals from Chulbul's cupboard and gives the stolen cash to Nirmala's father, hoping that he will permit Makkhi to marry Nirmala. Meanwhile, Chulbul meets Rajjo and proposes marriage, which she rejects, as she has {{to take care of}} her father, Haria (Mahesh Manjrekar)—a drunkard.|$|E

5|$|Andronikos {{began his}} reign well; in particular, the {{measures}} <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>to</b> reform {{the government of}} the Empire have been praised by historians. According to George Ostrogorsky, Andronikos was determined to root out corruption: Under his rule, the sale of offices ceased; selection was based on merit, rather than favouritism; officials were paid an adequate salary so as to reduce the temptation of bribery. In the provinces, Andronikos's reforms produced a speedy and marked improvement. The aristocrats were infuriated against him, and to make matters worse, Andronikos seems to have become increasingly unbalanced; executions and violence became increasingly common, and his reign turned into a reign of terror. Andronikos seemed almost to seek the extermination of the aristocracy as a whole. The struggle against the aristocracy turned into wholesale slaughter, while the Emperor resorted to ever more ruthless measures to shore up his regime.|$|E
5|$|During his midget season, Crosby {{appeared}} on the CBC's Hockey Day in Canada telecast. He has recalled numerous instances in which opposing players intentionally attempted to injure him, as well as constant verbal abuse from parents {{on and off the}} ice. Parents taunted and threatened Crosby so harshly, <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>to</b> not wearing his jersey between tournament games while he waited to play so {{that he would not be}} recognized. Due to this treatment, he elected to play for the American hockey program at Shattuck-Saint Mary's Boarding School, Minnesota for the 2002–03 hockey season. In 57 games with the Sabres, he recorded 72 goals and 162 points, leading the team to a U18 AAA national championship.|$|E
5|$|Early {{on in the}} 2010 outdoor season, Bolt ran 19.56 {{seconds in}} the 200 m in Kingston, Jamaica for the fourth-fastest run of all-time, {{although}} he stated {{that he had no}} record breaking ambitions for the forthcoming season. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>to</b> the international circuit May with wins in East Asia at the Colorful Daegu Pre-Championships Meeting and then a comfortable win in his 2010 IAAF Diamond League debut at the Shanghai Golden Grand Prix. Bolt made an attempt to break Michael Johnson's best time over the rarely competed 300 metres event at the Golden Spike meeting in Ostrava. He failed to match Johnson's ten-year-old record of 30.85 and suffered a setback in that his 30.97-second run in wet weather had left him with an Achilles tendon problem.|$|E

5|$|In 1914, at the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Muller's career took a new turn. The Dutch government appointed him government commissioner in charge {{of one of the}} main Belgian Refugee Camps in the Netherlands. Muller was charged with the transfer of the camp from a makeshift army encampment in Oldebroek to a proper refugee camp with full provisions in Nunspeet. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>to</b> the job with great enthusiasm, but resigned a year later, declaring that he had attained the goals he had set himself on his appointment. Actually the resignation came in a cloud of controversy around his person and policies. At the end of World War I the Dutch prime minister did acknowledge the high quality of Muller's work in setting up the camps and bringing and maintaining order and human dignity under very trying circumstances. Apart from his position as member of the Consular Examinations Commission, this position was the only Dutch government appointment Muller held inside the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|The 2004 season {{represented}} a breakthrough for Zersenay and he {{established himself as}} a serious contender in distance running. He signed a contract with Adidas Spain and brought the team victory at the European Clubs' Cross Country Cup in February. The following month he bettered his previous showings at the World Cross Country Championships with a sixth-place finish. With the help of team mates Yonas Kifle and Tesfayohannes Mesfen, among others, he took Eritrea to third position in the team competition – the first time the country had reached the podium at a world cross country event. Two months later he finished second in the 10km Great Manchester Run; his time of 27:59 was five seconds behind winner Craig Mottram. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>to</b> the track in June at a meeting in Gavà, Spain, and recorded another national record, this time in the 10,000m with a time of 27:32.61.|$|E
5|$|The {{director}} {{relied on}} a change of locale to inspire him to write Pi and Requiem for a Dream. For The Fountain, Aronofsky {{was inspired by a}} research trip <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>to</b> Guatemala with Handel to learn about Mayan history and philosophy. The script for The Fountain was influenced by the accounts of Uruguayan journalist Eduardo Galeano, who wrote examples of myth from an indigenous perspective, particularly Galeano's Genesis trilogy. The film Once Upon a Time in America also served as an influence on the script. Aronofsky, influenced by Bernal Díaz del Castillo's The Conquest of New Spain, applied the narrative in writing the film's conquistador scenes.|$|E
