40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{whether the}} principles of the beyond budgeting model are entirely separated from any budgeting approach. Research has shown that managers express their concern that budgets are indispensible in their nature. However, the beyond budgeting advocates stress that improving existing budget approaches is not sufficient. Companies should rather abandon budgets and operate according to the beyond budget principles. This contrast between the views triggered the authors of this thesis to investigate whether the beyond budgeting model is a management control system that operates entirely <b>free</b> of any <b>budgets.</b> The investigation is finished with a case study on Svenska Handelsbanken, which is seen as the role model for beyond budgeting. It is investigated whether this particular corporation manages to operate <b>free</b> of <b>budgets.</b> The researchers have developed a conceptual framework, in order to compare the beyond budgeting principles with the most commonly used budgeting approaches. The investigation reveals that the principles are predominantly different from any budgeting approach. However, capital investments, resource allocation, and the control functions overlap partly with budgeting, even though the scope of the beyond budgeting model exceeds all the other approaches. The study further discloses that Svenska Handelsbanken allocates resources on the regional level in a very traditional budgeting way. Furthermore, staff and cash flow planning are also within the traditional budgeting approaches. Overall, the results suggest that the principles have to be updated to break <b>free</b> from <b>budgeting</b> and really go ‘beyond’. The so-called ‘better budgeting’ seems to be a hybrid between traditional and beyond budgeting. This hybrid cannot be replaced {{at this stage of the}} beyond budgeting model. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{chemical}} {{composition of the}} earths atmosphere far from equilibrium is unique {{in the solar system}} and has been attributed to the presence of widespread life. Here I show that this perspective can be quantified using non-equilibrium thermodynamics. Generating disequilibrium in a thermodynamic variable requires the extraction of power from another thermodynamic gradient, and the second law of thermodynamics imposes fundamental limits on how much power can be extracted. When applied to complex earth system processes, where several irreversible processes compete to deplete the same gradients, it is easily shown that the maximum thermodynamic efficiency is much less than the classic Carnot limit, so that the ability of the earth system to generate power and disequilibrium is limited. This approach is used to quantify how much free energy is generated by various earth system processes to generate chemical disequilibrium. It is shown that surface life generates orders of magnitude more chemical free energy than any abiotic surface process, therefore being the primary driving force for shaping the geochemical environment at the planetary scale. To apply this perspective to the possible future of the planet, we first note that the free energy consumption by human activity is a considerable term in the <b>free</b> energy <b>budget</b> of the planet, and that global changes are closely related to this consumption of free energy. Since human activity and demands for free energy is going to increase in the future, the central question is how human free energy demands can increase sustainably without negatively impacting the ability of the earth system to generate free energy.

40|$|Peroxyacetic Acid (PAA) {{is one of}} {{important}} atmospheric organic peroxides, which have received increasing attention for their potential contribution to the oxidation capacity of the troposphere {{and the formation of}} secondary aerosols. We report here that, for the first time, a series of data for atmospheric PAA concentrations at urban and rural sites, from five field campaigns carried out in China in summer 2006, 2007 and 2008. For these five measurements, daytime mean PAA concentrations on sunlit days were 0. 02 – 0. 14 ppbv with a maximum level of ~ 1 ppbv. The various meteorological and chemical parameters influencing PAA concentrations were examined using the Principal Factor Analysis. This statistical analysis shows that the local photochemical production was the major source of PAA, and its concentration increased with increasing temperature, solar radiation and ozone but decreased with increasing NO x (NO and NO 2), CO, SO 2, and relative humidity. Based on the dataset, several issues are highlighted in this study: (i) because PAA is a product from the photochemical oxidation of some specific volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that lead to acetyl peroxy radicals, the importance of various VOCs with respect to the PAA formation is therefore ranked using the incremental reactivity method. (ii) The contribution of PAN thermal degradation to PAA formation under conditions of different NO x concentrations is estimated based on the chemical kinetics analysis. The result shows that PAN seems {{to play an important role}} in the formation of PAA when the NO/NO 2 concentration ratio was less than 0. 2 and PAA would correspondingly have feedback on the PAN-NO x cycle. (iii) PAA and other peroxides, such as methyl hydroperoxide (MHP) and H 2 O 2, usually exhibited a similar asymmetric shape typically shifted to the afternoon. However, at a high SO 2 level, H 2 O 2 showed a profile different from those of MHP and PAA. The combination of linear regression and chemical kinetics analysis reveals that a possible unknown pathway results in the significant removal of H 2 O 2 and the extent of H 2 O 2 undergoing this pathway needs a further study. (iv) Considering that PAA is the reservior of free radicals, its fate is expected to have an effect on the <b>free</b> radical <b>budget</b> in the atmosphere. A box model based on the CBM-IV mechanism has been performed to access its influence on the radical budget.

Through semi-structured interviews, observation of management meetings and project feedback, the problems encountered when trying to embed the characteristics of integrated solutions provision are examined within a leading construction firm undergoing such a transition. It reveals a disconnect in approach between head office work-winning teams and regional project delivery teams that has resulted in a lack of continuity of service at crucial pinch-points in the delivery process. A silo mentality, resulting in a lack of common understanding across the team, can be traced to an organisational path dependency that stems from historical decisions, and is therefore very difficult to overcome. The paper suggests practical mechanisms to help the business make changes to their working practices, routines and organisational structures. It is intended that these will drive the development of new capabilities allowing the organisation to break free from the paths it has become locked into to become a true solutions provider...|$|R
2500|$|Like Cushing, Lee also {{appeared}} in horror films for other companies during the 20-year period from 1957 to 1977. Other films in which Lee performed include the series of Fu Manchu films made between 1965 and 1969, in which he starred as the villain in heavy oriental make-up; I, Monster (1971), in which he played Jekyll and Hyde; The Creeping Flesh (1972); and his personal favourite, The Wicker Man (1973), in which he played Lord Summerisle. Lee wanted to break free of his image as Dracula and take on more interesting acting roles. He met with screenwriter Anthony Shaffer, and they agreed to work together. Film director Robin Hardy and British Lion head Peter Snell {{became involved in the}} project. Shaffer had a series of conversations with Hardy, and the two decided that {{it would be fun to}} make a horror film centering on [...] "old religion", in sharp contrast to the popular Hammer films of the day. Shaffer read the David Pinner novel Ritual, in which a devout Christian policeman is called to investigate what appears to be the ritual murder of a young girl in a rural village, and decided that it would serve well as the source material for the project. Shaffer and Lee paid Pinner £15,000 for the rights to the novel, and Schaffer set to work on the screenplay. However, he soon decided that a direct adaptation would not work well, and began to craft a new story, using only the basic outline of the novel. Lee was so keen to get the film made, he gave his services for <b>free,</b> as the <b>budget</b> was so small. He would later refer to the film as the best he had ever made.|$|R
