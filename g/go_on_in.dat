On Sundays at Columbia Park, Ajax and the other women's teams played as many as 16 games on four fields from September to April. U.S. woman's soccer standouts, defender Joy Biefeld-Fawcett and forward Carin Jennings, were members of 'Ajax America Women' and {{regularly}} practiced and played at the Columbia Park's soccer fields. These two Columbia park players would <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> 1991 to help 'Ajax' win the U.S. women's amateur championship, and then help the U.S. national team win the first FIFA Women's World Cup in China that same year.

25|$|Originally {{planned to}} house 450 patients, with {{space for a}} further 150, its {{capacity}} was reduced back to 300, with space for another 150. This was due to fears of an outcry if the local tax rate increased too sharply. At first the number of paupers admitted was low due {{to the charge of}} nine shilling per week each, this being higher than the workhouses and jails, but by force of the law the asylum was full within six months and more space was badly needed. In November of the same year, work on building extensions began to address this problem, and so started the almost continuous process of rebuilding and improvements that <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> the present day.|$|E

500|$|The {{day before}} Folie à Deux arrived in stores (December 15), Fall Out Boy had planned on staging an impromptu concert in New York City's Washington Square Park. However, the band did not obtain {{a permit to}} do so. Taking {{inspiration}} from Bob Dylan and similar folk singers from the 1960s, the group {{wanted to do something}} free and spontaneous as a gift to fans. The band and its management argued with the NYPD about allowing the show to <b>go</b> <b>on.</b> <b>In</b> the end, they were told that picking up any instruments would earn them a trip to jail, so the band instead led the audience in a sing-along. Stump sang while Wentz and Trohman played air guitar and Hurley drummed on his knees.

500|$|One {{significant}} {{feature of}} the Premier League in the mid-2000s was {{the dominance of the}} so-called [...] "Big Four" [...] clubs: Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United. During this decade, they dominated the top four spots, which came with UEFA Champions League qualification, taking all top-four places in 5 out of 6 seasons from 2003–04 to 2008–09 inclusive. Arsenal went as far as winning the league without losing a single game in 2003–04, the only time it has ever happened in the Premier League. In May 2008 Kevin Keegan stated that [...] "Big Four" [...] dominance threatened the division, [...] "This league is in danger of becoming one of the most boring but great leagues in the world."

He also discussed his attempt to focus on his original inspiration to produce music, stating [...] "The sound and feel of my music {{are going to be}} affected by what motivates me to do it". On his visit to South Carolina, D'Angelo stated that he [...] "went through this runnel, through gospel, blues, and a lot of old soul, old James Brown, early, early Sly and the Family Stone, and a lot of Jimi Hendrix", and [...] "I learned a lot about music, myself, and where I want to go musically". In the same interview, he cited the deaths of rappers Tupac Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G. as having a great effect on him during the period. In another {{interview with}} Touré, D'Angelo said that he had lost his enthusiasm after Brown Sugars reception and [...] "was gettin' jaded, lookin' at what <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> the business". On his purpose for returning, D'Angelo stated [...] "I had to reiterate why I was doin' that in the first place, and the reason was the love for the music".|$|E
500|$|Avatar {{has been}} called [...] "without a doubt the most epic piece of {{environmental}} advocacy ever captured on celluloid.... The film hits all the important environmental talking-points—virgin rain forests threatened by wanton exploitation, indigenous peoples who have much to teach the developed world, a planet which functions as a collective, interconnected Gaia-istic organism, and evil corporate interests {{that are trying to}} destroy it all." [...] Cameron has spoken extensively with the media about the film's environmental message, saying that he envisioned Avatar as a broader metaphor of how we treat the natural world. [...] He said that he created Pandora as [...] "a fictionalised fantasy version of what our world was like, before we started to pave it and build malls, and shopping centers. [...] So it's really an evocation of the world we used to have." [...] He told Charlie Rose that [...] "we are going to go through a lot of pain and heartache if we don't acknowledge our stewardship responsibilities to nature." [...] Interviewed by Terry Gross of National Public Radio, he called Avatar a satire on the sense of human entitlement: [...] " [...] is saying our attitude about indigenous people and our entitlement about what is rightfully theirs is the same sense of entitlement that lets us bulldoze a forest and not blink an eye. It's just human nature that if we can take it, we will. And sometimes we do it in a very naked and imperialistic way, and other times we do it in a very sophisticated way with lots of rationalization—but it's basically the same thing. A sense of entitlement. And we can't just <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> this unsustainable way, just taking what we want and not giving back." [...] An article in the Belgium paper De Standaard agreed: [...] "It's about the brutality of man, who shamelessly takes what isn't his." ...|$|E

500|$|Club member Finn (Cory Monteith) is {{concerned}} for his future, having {{been told by}} his girlfriend Quinn (Dianna Agron) that she is pregnant with his child. Emma suggests that instead of aiming to attend college on a football scholarship, Finn should utilize his musical talent. Believing Rachel's participation to be the glee club's only chance at success at Invitationals, Finn feigns romantic interest in Rachel and takes her on a date. Rachel, realizing she is unhappy performing in the school musical and excited over Finn's interest in her, returns to the glee club. Meanwhile, Kurt, Mercedes and Tina are informed of Quinn's pregnancy by Puck (Mark Salling), who pretends Finn fathered the child though he is the actual father. Finding out about Quinn, Rachel becomes furious with Finn and confronts him, asking if he is actually attracted to her at all. Finn insists the kiss they shared was honest, but Rachel is unconvinced and defects from glee club once again, returning to the school musical, where she is given full artistic control. At Invitationals, a drunk April, accompanied by the glee club, performs Carrie Underwood's [...] "Last Name" [...] for a packed auditorium and receives the standing ovation she always dreamed of. Because she had performed drunk, Will tells April during intermission that {{she is no longer}} in the glee club. She accepts, telling him that she has realized that it is the kids, not her, who are the ones that should get the spotlight. This leaves New Directions without a lead singer for their next number, but Rachel offers to <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> April's place—she has quit the musical, and wants to rejoin the club—and they all perform Queen's [...] "Somebody to Love".|$|E

You'll get tired just watching it." [...] Scott Kara of The New Zealand Herald awarded it three out of five stars, stating that the good thing about the DVD is that it has a [...] "wider range of songs", nevertheless {{they do not have the}} same [...] "rump-rattling power" [...] of the songs in The Beyoncé Experience simply because some songs are too short in duration, for instance [...] "Bootylicious".
