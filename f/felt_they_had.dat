5|$|After initial assessments, the HUSAR team <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> {{the proper}} {{equipment}} for the mission. In {{the early hours of}} Monday morning, June 25 – and despite discovering signs of life – rescue work was suspended due to the danger of additional concrete falling on the potential survivors and the HUSAR rescuers.|$|E
5|$|In {{the days}} {{following}} this interaction, Presley and Jackson spoke on the telephone almost every day, forging a strong friendship. The two came to realize they had much in common: both had been protected and sheltered from the real world, both <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> missed out on a normal childhood, both were mistrustful of outsiders having {{spent most of their}} lives feeling exploited by them, and both had problems with the media. Presley was raised in Graceland, while Jackson lived at Neverland.|$|E
5|$|As the day wore on, {{conditions}} {{appeared more}} and more favorable for thunderstorms, and {{more and more}} similar to the events of March 20. Weather radar images showed a severe squall line had formed to the west, and weather stations to the west reported cumulonimbus clouds and thunderstorms. In an afternoon meeting, under some pressure from their commanding officer, base meteorologists composed and issued the first official tornado forecast. Although they were aware of the small chance of success, they <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> no choice, since the conditions were so similar to March 20. Equipment which could be was moved to bomb-proof shelters, and base personnel were moved to safer areas.|$|E

60|$|The egotistical {{couple have}} {{undergone}} every calamity, and experienced every pleasurable and painful sensation of which our nature is susceptible. You cannot by possibility tell the egotistical couple anything they don't know, or describe to them anything <b>they</b> <b>have</b> not <b>felt.</b> <b>They</b> <b>have</b> been everything but dead. Sometimes we {{are tempted to}} wish <b>they</b> <b>had</b> been even that, but only in our uncharitable moments, which {{are few and far}} between.|$|R
5000|$|Because the Bulb is {{geographically}} unorganized {{and because}} the Albany Police Department had {{for a long period}} of time been given orders to not enforce the law barring [...] "camping", the Albany Bulb is often described as Anarchical. Many groups, including urban artists, otherwise-homeless Albany residents, dog walkers and owners, teenagers, and environmentalists, used the Bulb area and <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> a stake in it.|$|R
5|$|Bulgaria {{became a}} member of the United Nations in 1955 and since 1966 has been a non-permanent member of the Security Council three times, most {{recently}} from 2002 to 2003. Bulgaria was also among the founding nations of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) in 1975. It joined NATO on 29 March 2004, signed the European Union Treaty of Accession on 25 April 2005, and became a full member of the European Union on 1 January 2007. Polls carried out seven years after the country's accession to the EU found only 15% of Bulgarians <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> personally benefited from membership, with almost 40% of the population saying they would not bother to vote in the 2014 EU elections. Euro-Atlantic integration became a priority for the country since the fall of Communism, although the Communist leadership also had aspirations of leaving the Warsaw Pact and joining the European Communities by 1987.|$|E
5|$|On {{checking}} {{records of}} telephone calls {{made to the}} dealer, the police found that some had been made from a mobile phone registered in Ireland, and on further checking the records of that phone {{it appeared that the}} calls were made from locations consistent with the known whereabouts of the Ford truck. One call was to a known IRA member. The phone was last used at 9:23am {{on the morning of the}} bombing, just three minutes after the bombers had parked their truck in Corporation Street. On 27 June, the phone's registered owner reported that it had been stolen 17days earlier, but the police <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> gathered enough evidence to bring a prosecution against the six IRA men held in London.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Canada, Roberts {{signed a}} three-year {{contract}} with the Toronto Maple Leafs worth $8 million. He chose his hometown Maple Leafs because he <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> a better opportunity to win the Stanley Cup than Carolina did. He recorded 53 points in 2000–01 and his 29 goals led the team. A 48-point season followed in 2001–02 and he assumed leadership of the Maple Leafs during the 2002 Stanley Cup Playoffs after team captain Mats Sundin suffered a season-ending injury. Roberts led Toronto past their first round opponent, the New York Islanders, in an occasionally violent seven game series. The Maple Leafs reached the Eastern Conference final, where they ultimately lost to Carolina. Roberts led Toronto in playoff scoring with 19 points in 19 games.|$|E

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess attitudes of women with breast cancer following their participation in a health outcome interview survey. The majority of the sample indicated that the interview was easier than expected and one reported being inconvenienced by the interview; 94 percent indicated they were glad to have participated and 58 percent <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> received some personal benefit. There was no evidence of distress resulting from participation...|$|R
5|$|Smith {{organised}} {{a meeting}} with Johnston, starting at 09:00 on 18 August, where he informed the British High Commissioner that he had considered the Lisbon appointment extensively, {{with the help of}} Dupont, several legal advisers, and a judge of the Rhodesian High Court. The judge had examined the relevant documents, and had {{come to the conclusion that}} Dupont's interpretation of them was correct. Smith therefore felt certain that Reedman's appointment was legitimate so long as Portugal agreed. A long argument ensued, with neither man willing to budge. Smith said that he had always tried to be flexible and civil, but that he and his government <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> to make a stand. By making clear to Lisbon the exact nature of their proposed representative, and informing Britain of their intent, Smith said the Rhodesians had filled every legal obligation.|$|E
5|$|Their {{ideas were}} well {{received}} by TSR, whose marketing department <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> enough dungeons, {{but not enough}} dragons. Hickman suggested a series of twelve modules, each featuring a different dragon. TSR employee Harold Johnson suggested that Hickman should try to get additional support from other TSR staff members and, {{after a period of}} months, Hickman had the support of Jeff Grubb, Larry Elmore, Roger Moore, Doug Niles, Michael Williams, and others with whom they discussed ideas for the project. Meanwhile, Weis was editing and writing various Endless Quest books for TSR. The Dragonlance group decided that novels should accompany the game modules; TSR reluctantly agreed and hired a writer. Hickman became the design coordinator for Project Overlord, the cover name for what would later be known as the Dragonlance saga.|$|E
5|$|As {{with his}} {{previous}} crossings, steamers took the crowds from Circular Quay, although this time only four were needed, while another 600–700 people {{made their own}} way to the site. The ride was scheduled for 3 pm on 23 December, but delays meant L'Estrange did not appear until 6 pm. Although the length of rope was over 182 metres, it was only just over nine metres above the water. The stay wires were held in boats on either side, with the crews rowing against each other to keep it steady. L'Estrange rode his bicycle towards the centre, where, with the rope swinging to and fro, he stopped briefly to steady himself but instead, realising he was losing his balance, {{he was forced to}} leap from the rope and fell into the water below. Although he was unhurt, it was another knock to his reputation. A repeat attempt was announced for the following weekend. Again steamers took a dwindling crowd to Banbury Bay where they found L'Estrange's rope had been mysteriously cut, and he cancelled the performance. The Daily Telegraph reported that many in the crowd, who had paid for tickets on the steamers, <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> been scammed.|$|E

5000|$|Penn did {{not usually}} have a {{personal}} problem with religious people. Many come up to him after his show and he <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> congenial conversations. He did mention, however, he was struck once by a drunk Christian woman. The woman told Penn her pastor said {{there are no such}} thing as atheists, to which Penn responded, [...] "That's two things your pastor is wrong about." [...] The woman proceeded to slap Penn.|$|R

5|$|Core Design {{improved}} and modified the character with each instalment. Developers for Tomb Raider II {{increased the number}} of polygons in the character's model and added more realistic curves to its design. Other changes included new outfits and manoeuvres. Core Design reportedly planned to implement crawling as a new gameplay option, but the option did not appear until Tomb Raider III. Actress Judith Gibbins took over voice acting responsibilities and stayed on through the third game. For Tomb Raider III, the developers {{increased the number of}} polygons in Croft's 3D model to about 300, and introduced more abilities to the gameplay. Core Design wanted to reintroduce the character to players in Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation and included a flashback scenario with a younger Lara. The developers expanded the character's set of moves threefold to allow more interaction with the environment, like swinging on ropes and kicking open doors. The character model was altered to feature more realistic proportions, and Jonell Elliott replaced Gibbins as the voice of Lara Croft. By the time development for The Last Revelation began, Core Design had worked on the series constantly for four years and the staff <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> exhausted their creativeness. Feeling the series lacked innovation, Core Design decided to kill the character and depicted Croft trapped by a cave-in during the final scenes of the game.|$|E
5|$|One {{significant}} factor in the decline was the rise of grunge music from Seattle, with bands including Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam and Soundgarden. This was particularly obvious after the success of Nirvana's Nevermind (1991), which combined elements of hardcore punk and heavy metal into a dirty sound that made use of heavy guitar distortion, fuzz and feedback, along with darker lyrical themes, a stripped-down aesthetic and a complete rejection of the glam metal visual style and performance. Many major labels <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> been caught off-guard by the surprise success of grunge and began turning over their personnel in favor of younger staffers more versed in the new scene. As MTV shifted its attention to the new style, glam metal bands found themselves relegated increasingly to late night airplay, and Headbanger's Ball was cancelled {{at the end of}} 1994, while KNAC went over to Spanish programming. Given glam metal's lack of a major format presence on radio, bands were left without a clear way to reach their audience. Other (earlier Hollywood) alternative rock bands like the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Jane's Addiction also helped supplant the popularity of the genre.|$|E

25|$|Many of {{the rebel}} {{forces on the}} ground first heard of the Truce when it was {{announced}} in the newspapers and this gave rise to the first fissures in nationalist unity, which had serious consequences later on.

25|$|Like Patrick Racing the day before, Team Green {{cancelled}} {{their second}} scheduled day of testing when they <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> accomplished their testing goals after only one session.

But over the ensuing weekend they found no sign of Ben.|$|E

25|$|In {{spite of}} Russia's failure to honour {{the terms of}} the Treaty of Georgievsk, Georgian rulers <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> nowhere else to turn. The Persians had sacked and burned Tbilisi, leaving 20,000 dead. Agha Mohammad Khan, however, was assassinated in 1797 in Shusha, after which the Iranian grip over Georgia softened. Erekle died the {{following}} year, leaving the throne to his sickly and ineffectual son Giorgi XII.|$|E
25|$|For his part, Joseph Zoellner {{rather more}} prosaically {{stated that he}} {{and the rest of the}} quartet <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> been playing to a “responsive instrument” and were {{impressed}} with Keller’s ability to interpret the music. For instance, although no one had told her the Tchaikovsky work supposedly had its basis in an old fisherman’s song, Keller described it as evoking the sea and the ocean breeze on her face.|$|E
25|$|The union {{also had}} to {{forestall}} invocation of the Taft-Hartley Act. Union leaders <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> already delayed long enough (five months), and that further delays would only harm union members. President Truman was under intense pressure from Congress and his own aides to invoke Taft-Hartley. Murray reiterated the union's opposition to {{the law and the}} union's intention to fight an injunction, statements which tended to inflame emotions and delay a resolution to the strike.|$|E
