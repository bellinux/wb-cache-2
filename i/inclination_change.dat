40|$|We study orbital <b>inclination</b> <b>changes</b> {{associated}} with the precession of a disc-planet system that occurs through gravitational interaction with a binary companion on an inclined orbit. We investigate whether this scenario can account for giant planets on close orbits highly inclined to the stellar equatorial plane. We obtain conditions for maintaining approximate coplanarity and test them with SPH-simulations. For parameters of interest, the system undergoes approximate rigid body precession with modest warping while the planets migrate inwards. Because of pressure forces, disc self-gravity is not needed to maintain the configuration. We consider a disc and single planet for different initial inclinations of the binary orbit to the midplane of the combined system and a system of three planets for which migration leads to dynamical instability that reorders the planets. As the interaction {{is dominated by the}} time averaged quadrupole component of the binary's perturbing potential, results for a circular orbit can be scaled to apply to eccentric orbits. The system responded adiabatically when changes to binary orbital parameters occurred on time scales exceeding the orbital period. Accordingly <b>inclination</b> <b>changes</b> are maintained under its slow removal. Thus the scenario for generating high inclination planetary orbits studied here, is promising.

The HST {{is similar to the}} bi-elliptic transfer as the high-thrust system is first used to propel the spacecraft beyond the target where it is used again to circularize at an intermediate orbit. The low-thrust system is then activated and, while maintaining this orbit altitude, used to change the orbit inclination to suit the mission specification. The low-thrust system is then used again to reduce the spacecraft altitude by spiraling in-toward the target orbit. An analytical analysis of the HST utilizing the low-thrust system for the <b>inclination</b> <b>change</b> is performed which allows a critical specific impulse ratio to be derived determining {{the point at which the}} HST consumes the same amount of fuel as the Hohmann transfer.

The combination of aerodynamic and propulsive forces to cause a change in orbital inclination is termed a synergetic maneuver.
