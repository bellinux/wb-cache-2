500|$|Following the album's release, hip hop artists {{increasingly}} {{began to}} draw upon a broad stable of producers for their projects. At the time, the assembly of big-name producers was unprecedented, since most hip hop albums had primarily been the work of one dedicated producer and sometimes an embedded production team. Yet author Adam Mansbach reflects {{on the impact of}} Illmatics noteworthy producers, writing: [...] "The psychological impact on the listener of having all these elite producers – some of whom, like Q-Tip, really weren’t known yet for doing outside production work at all – coming together to lace the debut of this kid from Queensbridge was tremendous." [...] This same [...] would also be used by other successful East Coast rappers. In an article on New York hip hop, Mosi Reeves of Creative Loafing wrote that [...] "Nas' Illmatic [...] [...] [...] is the first to draw together top hip hop producers in the recording industry. That formula, most successfully mined by the late Notorious B.I.G. (1997's Life After Death), Puff Daddy (1997's No Way Out) and Jay-Z (1998's Vol. 2... Hard Knock Life), <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>most</b> N.Y. prospects still use today."

The spread between {{the up and down}} curves visually illustrate the valve's hysteresis; there is always hysteresis within wax driven technology due to the phase change between solids and liquids. Hysteresis can be controlled with specialized blended mixes of hydrocarbons; tight hysteresis <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>most</b> desire, however specialized engineering applications require broader ranges. Wax pellet driven valves are used in anti scald, freeze protection, over-temp purge, solar thermal, automotive, and aerospace applications among many others.|$|E

2500|$|The roti wrap quickly gained {{popularity}} {{across the}} island and spread {{throughout the rest of}} the Caribbean. Roti shops are now abundant in Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, Jamaica, the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands, and the wrapped roti a staple street food. The wrap is now simply referred to as a roti or just roti. As Indo-Caribbeans moved to North American cities such as Toronto, New York, Miami, Los Angeles, and Montreal, they exported with them the wrapped version of roti. This iconic version <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>most</b> North Americans know as roti. The growth in popularity has recently led to referring to the flat-bread itself (roti) that surrounds the filling as a [...] "roti skin" [...] or [...] "roti shell", a practice that is now common in both restaurants and commercial companies.|$|E

2500|$|Canzone Napoletana <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>most</b> {{people think}} of when they think of Neapolitan music. It {{consists}} of {{a large body of}} composed popular music—such songs as [...] 'O sole mio, Torna a Surriento, Funiculì funiculà, etc. The Neapolitan song became a formal institution in the 1830s through the vehicle of an annual song writing competition for the yearly Festival of Piedigrotta, dedicated to the Madonna of Piedigrotta, a well-known church in the Mergellina area of Naples. The winner of the first festival was a song entitled Te voglio bene assaie; it was composed by the prominent opera composer, Gaetano Donizetti. The festival ran regularly until 1950 when it was abandoned. A subsequent Festival of Neapolitan Song on Italian state radio enjoyed some success in the 1950s but was eventually abandoned as well. The period since 1950 has produced such songs as Malafemmena by Totò, Indifferentemente by Mario Trevi and Carmela by Sergio Bruni. [...] Although separated by some decades from the earlier classics of this genre, they have now become [...] "classics" [...] in their own right. (See main article for more information.) ...|$|E

2500|$|Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter {{described}} Blindness as [...] "provocative but predictable cinema", startling but {{failing to}} surprise. Honeycutt criticized the film's two viewpoints: Julianne Moore's character, {{the only one}} who can see, is slow to act against atrocities, and the behavior of Danny Glover's character comes off as [...] "slightly pompous". Honeycutt explained, [...] "This philosophical coolness <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>most</b> undermines the emotional response to Meirelles' film. His fictional calculations are all so precise and a tone of deadly seriousness swamps the grim action." [...] Justin Chang of Variety described the film: [...] "Blindness emerges onscreen both overdressed and undermotivated, scrupulously hitting the novel's beats yet barely approximating, so to speak, its vision." [...] Chang thought that Julianne Moore gave a strong performance but did not feel that the film captured the impact of Saramago's novel. Roger Ebert called Blindness [...] "one of the most unpleasant, not to say unendurable, films I've ever seen." [...] A. O. Scott of The New York Times stated that, although it [...] "is not a great film, ... it is, nonetheless, full of examples of what good filmmaking looks like." ...|$|E

2500|$|Investment and {{accumulation}} goals: planning how {{to accumulate}} enough money – for large purchases and life events – <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>most</b> people {{consider to be}} financial planning. [...] Major reasons to accumulate assets include, purchasing a house or car, starting a business, paying for education expenses, and saving for retirement. Achieving these goals requires projecting what they will cost, and {{when you need to}} withdraw funds that will be necessary to be able to achieve these goals. [...] A major risk to the household in achieving their accumulation goal is the rate of price increases over time, or inflation. [...] Using net present value calculators, the financial planner will suggest a combination of asset earmarking and regular savings to be invested in a variety of investments. [...] In order to overcome the rate of inflation, the investment portfolio has to get a higher rate of return, which typically will subject the portfolio to a number of risks. [...] Managing these portfolio risks is most often accomplished using asset allocation, which seeks to diversify investment risk and opportunity. [...] This asset allocation will prescribe a percentage allocation to be invested in stocks (either preferred stock or common stock), bonds (for example mutual bonds or government bonds, or corporate bonds), cash and alternative investments. [...] The allocation should also take into consideration the personal risk profile of every investor, since risk attitudes vary from person to person.|$|E
