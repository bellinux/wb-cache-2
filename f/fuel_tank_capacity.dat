They inspected cockpits for layout and control locations, and armour plate. They recovered armaments and noted their locations and mounts.

50|$|As {{its weight}} changes during riding, the dry {{weight of a}} {{motorcycle}} typically excludes the gasoline (or other fuel). Dry weight, in this sense, can directly be used for comparison with (FIM) weight limits, which pertain to the motorcycle in operating condition.

This dry weight could also be useful in comparing different models, with different <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> <b>capacities.</b> However, manufacturers may also exclude {{some or all of the}} following: engine oil, coolant, or brake fluid, and this makes such a comparison difficult. When any of these is excluded, the specified dry weight no longer pertains to the motorcycle in running order. Some manufacturers even exclude the battery, notwithstanding the weight of the battery is mainly in solid components (usually lead), not liquid (electrolytes).|$|R

5000|$|In {{commercial}} operations, the CL-44 {{proved to}} be an extremely profitable aircraft to run with a fuel burn half that of a Boeing 707. The CL-44 burned 5,500 pounds of fuel (less when operating at its higher flight levels) per hour. This fuel consumption and its <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks</b> <b>capacity</b> (80,800 lb) gave 15 hours and longer in the air, cruising at an airspeed of 300 kts. It had a payload of 27 metric tons. After 40 years, out of the 39 aircraft built, 18 had either crashed or been destroyed in operation, 13 had been cut up, and two (including the Guppy) remain more or less operational. The remaining eight aircraft are parked around the world or have already been scrapped. Not a single CL-44 had been conserved or been prepared for a museum although the Ecuadorian Air Force salvaged #13 for eventual display at a new aviation museum in Guayaquil, Ecuador.
