5|$|In 1991, the American Institute of Architects {{condemned}} the bombardment of the city's buildings. The Institute for the Protection of Cultural Monuments, {{in conjunction with}} UNESCO, found that, of the 824 buildings in the Old Town, 563 (or 68.33 percent) {{had been hit by}} projectiles <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>siege.</b> Of these 563, nine buildings had been completely destroyed by one of several major fires that occurred <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>siege.</b> In 1993, the Institute for the Rehabilitation of Dubrovnik and UNESCO estimated the total cost for restoring public, private, and religious buildings, streets, squares, fountains, ramparts, gates, and bridges at $9,657,578. By the end of 1999, over $7,000,000 had been spent on restoration. It {{is a testament to the}} resilience of the ancient walls that more buildings in the old town were not destroyed during the bombardment; the ancient walls in fact were more effective at resisting modern weaponry than contemporary structures in the city's periphery.|$|E

5|$|Nothing {{is known}} of his {{activities}} from then until early 545, by which time he was the garrison commander of Rome. Along with the general Conon {{he was responsible for}} the city's defence <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>siege</b> by Totila in 546. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>siege</b> he restricted himself to passive defence, refusing to sally forth from the walls even when Belisarius, who had returned from the east and landed with reinforcements at the nearby Portus Romanus, ordered him to do so. As a result, Belisarius' attempts to succour the beleaguered city failed. Procopius heavily criticizes Bessas for his conduct <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>siege.</b> He neglected of the civilian population of the city and enriched himself by selling the starving populace the grain he had hoarded at exorbitant prices. The civilians were so exhausted by famine that when he finally allowed those who wanted to leave the city to do so, many simply died on the wayside, while others were killed by the Goths. Finally, he proved negligent in the conduct of the defence, and allowed security measures to grow lax: guards slept at their posts, and patrols were discontinued. This allowed four Isaurian soldiers to contact Totila, and on 17 December 546, the city was betrayed to the Goths. Bessas managed to escape with the greater part of the garrison, but the treasure that he had amassed was left behind for the Goths to enjoy. Following his dismal performance in Italy, Bessas was apparently recalled to Constantinople.|$|E
