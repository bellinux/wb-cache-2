40|$|Shale gas {{reservoirs}} with multistage hydraulic fractures {{are commonly}} characterized by analyzing long-term gas production data, but <b>water</b> <b>flowback</b> data {{is usually not}} included in the analysis. However, this work shows there can be benefits to including post-frac <b>water</b> <b>flowback</b> and long-term <b>water</b> production data in well analysis. In addition, field data indicate that only 10 - 40 % of the frac water is recovered after the flowback. This work addresses two main question: Where is the rest of the injected frac fluid that is not recovered and what is the mechanism that is trapping it? And how can the <b>water</b> <b>flowback</b> data be used in estimating effective fracture volume using production data analysis tools? A number of simulation cases were run for single and two phase (gas/water) for modeling flowback and long-term production periods. Various physical assumptions were investigated for the saturations and properties that exist in the fracture/matrix system after hydraulic fracturing. The results of these simulations were compared with analytical solutions and data from actual wells using diagnostic and specialized plots. The results of these comparisons led to certain conclusions and procedures describing possible reservoir conditions after hydraulic fracturing and during production. Past publications have suggested that the lost frac water is trapped in the natural fracture or imbibed into the rock matrix near the fracture face. Natural fracture spacing could be a possible explanation of the lost frac water. These concepts are tested and the challenge of simulating a natural fracture with trapped water without imbibition is solved using a new hybrid relative permeability jail. This concept was tested for the period of flowback, shut-in and production. This work presents the benefits of a new method for combining <b>water</b> <b>flowback</b> and long-term <b>water</b> production data in shale gas analysis. Water production analysis can provide effective fracture volume which was confirmed by the cumulative produced water. This will help when evaluating fracture-stimulation jobs. It also shows the benefits of combining <b>flowback</b> and long-term <b>water</b> production data in the analysis of shale gas wells. In some cases, the time shift on diagnostic plots changes the apparent flow regime identification of early gas production data. This leads to different models of the fracture/matrix system.

40|$|In many forward osmosis applications, flux is maximised (and {{capital costs}} minimised) when the {{membrane}} is oriented {{such that the}} feed solution faces the support layer (PRO mode). Here, a framework is developed to understand the factors that determine the membrane orientation that maximises flux. In the absence of fouling, a dimensionless form of the water transport equations reveals the importance of three dimensionless groups: the ratio of draw to feed osmotic pressure, the ratio of draw to feed solute diffusivity, and the resistance to water transport of the support layer relative to the active layer. A parametric study of these parameters and an application of the dimensionless equations to three important FO processes reveal that having the draw solution face the support layer (FO mode) can maximise flux in specific instances. Interestingly, this implies that operation in FO mode can both maximise flux and minimise fouling for fertigation applications and the concentration of <b>flowback</b> <b>waters</b> from hydraulic fracturing.

This {{became known as the}} “BLM fracking rule”, and would take effect on March 31 extending into Federal, Indian, and Public lands. This rule would apply to more than 750 million areas of Federal and Indian lands and regulated chemical disclosure, well integrity, and <b>flowback</b> <b>water</b> management. This rule would require companies to identify the chemicals being used in hydraulic fracturing and their purpose. This requirement would only extend to chemicals used after, not before, fracking to protect company chemical mix recipes. But, not knowing the chemicals beforehand eliminates the government's ability to test the water for a baseline reading to know if the process is contaminating water sources or not. Well integrity is vital to ensure that oil, gas, and other fracking chemicals are not being leached into direct drinking water sources. The rule would require operators to submit a cement bond log to ensure that drinking water has been properly isolated from the water that will be used. Finally, the BLM requires companies to provide their estimated waste water totals along with a disposal plan. The fracking rule was met with critiques for not requiring more transparency from corporations on chemicals being used before drilling into wells.|$|E

Since 2008, these technological developments have spurred exponential growth of gas well drilling across the U. S. While the new drilling for shale gas and hydraulic fracturing technologies have dramatically changed the energy landscape in the U.

This paper provides key observations for the potential risks of shale gas drilling and hydraulic fracturing {{on the quality of}} water resources and include: (1) stray gas contamination of shallow groundwater overlying shale gas basins; (2) pathways and hydraulic connectivity between the deep shale gas formations and the overlying shallow drinking water aquifers; and (3) inadequate disposal of produced and <b>flowback</b> <b>waters</b> associated with shale gas exploration that causes contamination of surface waters and long-term ecological effects.

40|$|Acid mine {{drainage}} (AMD) is {{an environmental}} pollutant that degrades water bodies and harms aquatic life. In the Appalachian Mountains {{of the eastern}} U. S., over 7, 500 miles of streams are impacted by AMD. Current methods of active treating AMD such as neutralization with limestone are labor-intensive and costly. Passive treatments with lower maintenance and management costs are the more sustainable alternatives for AMD management. The research reported herein explores the possibility of applying <b>flowback</b> <b>water</b> from natural gas drilling operations and the chelating agent 3 -glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GOPS) as additive to passively treat AMD. The hypothesis is that chemicals present in the <b>flowback</b> <b>water</b> will form insoluble salts {{with those in the}} mine residue and precipitate on the mine rock to passivate the surface [...] Additionally, GOPS will improve upon the passivation process by complexing with metal ions in the precipitate to form a multilayer hydrophobic coating. In order to develop a protocol for measuring the optimal dosage of <b>flowback</b> <b>water</b> and GOPS for AMD prevention, several preliminary batch tests were conducted. These tests evaluated the reaction time and volumes of <b>flowback</b> <b>water</b> and GOPS appropriate for further column testing, as measured by concentrations of Fe, Ba, and SO 42 -.

However, data for establishing such standards has only recently been studied for other components of produced water, such as bicarbonate (HCO 3 −), which has acute median lethal concentrations (LC 50 s) ranging from 699 to N 8000 mg/L and effects on chronic toxicity from 430 to 657 mg/L. While Cl− is an ion of considerable importance inmultiple geographical regions, knowledge about the effects of hardness (calciumand magnesium) on its toxicity and about mechanisms of toxicity is not well understood. A multiple-approach design that combines studies of both individuals and populations, conducted both in the laboratory and the field, was used to study toxic effects of bicarbonate (as NaHCO 3). This approach allowed interpretations about mechanisms related to growth effects at the individual level that could affect populations in the wild. However, additional mechanistic data for HCO 3 −, related to the interactions of calcium (Ca 2 +) precipitation at the microenvironment of the gill would dramatically increase the scientific knowledge base about how NaHCO 3 might affect aquatic life.

Particle size distribution analysis and fouling mechanism identification of the two mixtures were performed to understand the cause of membrane fouling. The dominant fouling mechanisms {{in the early stages of}} Mixture 1 filtration were standard blocking (pore constriction) and complete blocking (pore blocking) caused by particles in the <b>flowback</b> <b>water</b> with size in the range of membrane pore diameter.

Additional filtration experiments were conducted using two barium sulfate solutions containing an order of magnitude difference in precipitate concentration.

However, the reuse of <b>flowback</b> <b>water</b> requires the removal of scale-forming cations, namely barium, strontium, and calcium.

This study focused on both fundamental and practical aspects of chemical precipitation in Marcellus Shale <b>flowback</b> <b>water</b> by the addition of sulfate and carbonate. Thermodynamic equilibrium programs (MINEQL+ & PhreeqcI) based on ion association theory (Davis equation and ¡°WATEQ¡± Debye-H¨¹ckel equation) and ion interaction theory (Pitzer equations) were utilized to predict and interpret experimental results and understand the impact of ionic strength on chemical reactions of interest. A treatability study of <b>flowback</b> <b>water</b> conducted with sulfate addition indicated that celestite (SrSO 4) precipitation is a much slower than barite (BaSO 4) precipitation. The degree of sulfate supersaturation had a positive impact while ionic strength and presence of other divalent cations had negative impacts on the kinetics of barite and celestite precipitation. The presence of organics did not show any impact on the precipitation kinetics. Chemical equilibrium in this complex water system can be predicted reasonably well using the Pitzer model. This study also documented that carbonate is a good precipitation reagent for calcium and strontium removal. Addition of carbonate without any pH adjustment (pH = 8) accomplished better removal of strontium than when the pH was increased to 10 to aid in calcium removal.

This study investigated {{the potential impact of}} <b>flowback</b> <b>water</b> on four representative soils from shale gas regions in Northeast China using synthetic flowback solutions. The compositions of the solutions were representative of <b>flowback</b> <b>water</b> arising at different stages after fracturing well establishment. The effects of solution composition of <b>flowback</b> <b>water</b> on soil ecosystem were assessed in terms of metal mobility and bioaccessibility, as well as biological endpoints using Microtox bioassay (Vibrio fischeri) and enzyme activity tests. After one-month artificial aging of the soils with various flowback solutions, the mobility and bioaccessibility of As(V) and Se(VI) decreased as the ionic strength of the flowback solutions increased. The results inferred a stronger binding affinity of As(V) and Se(VI) with the soils. Nevertheless, the soil toxicity to Vibrio fischeri only presented a moderate increase after aging, while dehydrogenase and phosphomonoesterase activities were significantly suppressed with increasing ionic strength of flowback solutions. On the contrary, polyacrylamide in the flowback solutions led to higher dehydrogenase activity.

Mathematical models for the reverse osmosis and nanofiltration processes were developed to assess the performance of these processes in the treatment of <b>flowback</b> <b>water</b> produced during the hydraulic fracturing for natural gas production from shale plays. The models, based on the mass balance and thermodynamics, were verified and implemented in Matlab version R 2015. The models were used to perform a sensitivity analysis for the two processes in order to determine the effect of the operating variables on the membrane performance in terms of solute concentration and filtration time. For the reverse osmosis, it was found that pressure drop, inlet flow rate and membrane area were the major parameters governing the process. For nanofiltration, on the other hand, pressure drop, reflection coefficient and membrane area were the most important parameters affecting the process performance. The models were also used to assess and compare the performance of four different commercial reverse osmosis and three nanofiltration membranes using actual field data, such as inlet flowrate and <b>flowback</b> <b>water</b> composition. The predictions of the two models showed that the reverse osmosis was significantly superior to the nanofiltration membranes in the removal of Na+ and Ca 2 +.

Attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy provided direct evidence of inner- and outer-sphere boron complexation with coagulant surface hydroxyl groups.

40|$|This study {{considers}} the flux of radioactivity in flowback fluid from shale gas development in three areas: the Carboniferous, Bowland Shale, UK; the Silurian Shale, Poland; and the Carboniferous Barnett Shale, USA. The radioactive flux from these basins was estimated, given {{estimates of the}} number of wells developed or to be developed, the flowback volume per well and the concentration of K (potassium) and Ra (radium) in the <b>flowback</b> <b>water.</b> For comparative purposes, the range of concentration was itself considered within four scenarios for the concentration range of radioactive measured in each shale gas basin, the groundwater of the each shale gas basin, global groundwater and local surface water. The study found that (i) for the Barnett Shale and the Silurian Shale, Poland, the 1 % exceedance flux in <b>flowback</b> <b>water</b> was between seven and eight times that would be expected from local groundwater. However, for the Bowland Shale, UK, the 1 % exceedance flux (the flux that would only be expected to be exceeded 1 % of the time, i. e. a reasonable worst case scenario) in <b>flowback</b> <b>water</b> was 500 times that expected from local groundwater. (ii) In no scenario was the 1 % exceedance exposure greater than 1 mSv—the allowable annual exposure allowed for in the UK. (iii) The radioactive flux of per energy produced was lower for shale gas than for conventional oil and gas production, nuclear power production and electricity generated through burning coal...|$|E
40|$|Shale gas {{has emerged}} as a {{potential}} resource to transform the global energy market. Nevertheless, gas extraction from tight shale formations is only possible after horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, which generally demand large amounts of water. Part of the ejected fracturing fluid returns to the surface as <b>flowback</b> <b>water,</b> containing a variety of pollutants. For this reason, water reuse and water recycling technologies have received further interest for enhancing overall shale gas process efficiency and sustainability. Water pretreatment systems (WPSs) can play an important role for achieving this goal. This paper introduces a new optimization model for WPS simultaneous synthesis, especially developed for <b>flowback</b> <b>water</b> from shale gas production. A multistage superstructure is proposed for the optimal WPS design, including several water pretreatment alternatives. The mathematical model is formulated via generalized disjunctive programming (GDP) and solved by re-formulation as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, to minimize the total annualized cost. Hence, the superstructure allows identifying the optimal pretreatment sequence with minimum cost, according to inlet water composition and wastewater-desired destination (i. e., water reuse as fracking fluid or recycling). Three case studies are performed to illustrate the applicability of the proposed approach under specific composition constraints. Thus, four distinct <b>flowback</b> <b>water</b> compositions are evaluated for the different target conditions. The results highlight the ability of the developed model for the cost-effective WPS synthesis, by reaching the required water compositions for each specified destination.

40|$|The {{environmental}} impact of shale {{oil and gas production}} by hydraulic fracturing (fracking) is of increasing concern. The biggest potential source of environmental contamination is <b>flowback</b> and produced <b>water,</b> which is highly contaminated with hydrocarbons, bacteria and particulates, meaning that traditional membranes are readily fouled. We show the chemical functionalisation of alumina ceramic microfiltration membranes (0. 22 μm pore size) with cysteic acid creates a superhydrophilic surface, allowing for separation of hydrocarbons from frac and produced waters without fouling. The single pass rejection coefficients was[*]> 90 % for all samples. The separation of hydrocarbons from water when the former have hydrodynamic diameters smaller than the pore size of the membrane is due to the zwitter ionically charged superhydrophilic pore surface. Membrane fouling is essentially eliminated, while a specific flux is obtained at a lower pressure (< 2 [*]bar) than that required achieving the same flux for the untreated membrane (4 – 8 [*]bar) ...|$|R
40|$|Organic {{contaminants}} in shale gas <b>flowback</b> and produced <b>water</b> (FPW) are traditionally expressed as {{total organic carbon}} (TOC) or chemical oxygen demand (COD), though these parameters do not provide information on the toxicity and environmental fate of individual components. This review addresses identification of individual organic {{contaminants in}} FPW, and stresses the gaps in the knowledge on FPW composition that exist so far. Furthermore, the risk quotient approach was applied to predict the toxicity of the quantified organic compounds for fresh water organisms in recipient surface waters. This resulted in an identification {{of a number of}} FPW related organic compounds that are potentially harmful namely those compounds originating from shale formations (e. g. polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, phthalates), fracturing fluids (e. g. quaternary ammonium biocides, 2 -butoxyethanol) and downhole transformations of organic compounds (e. g. carbon disulphide, halogenated organic compounds). Removal of these compounds by FPW treatment processes is reviewed and potential and efficient abatement strategies are defined...|$|R
