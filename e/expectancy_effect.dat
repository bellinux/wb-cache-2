40|$|A {{critique}} of Harris and Rosenthal's (1985) 31 meta-analyses of {{the mediation of}} interpersonal <b>expectancy</b> <b>effects</b> raises two issues. First, the study of interpersonal <b>expectancy</b> <b>effects</b> requires {{an examination of the}} expectancy-mediator-changes (B-C-D) chain in toto. Harris and Rosenthal's meta-analytic exercise fails to substantiate such a chain, and also fails to enhance understanding of the subtle and unwitting nature of the expectancy-mediator (B-C) and the mediator-changes (C-D) links. Second, mixing studies of uneven quality in a meta-analysis still appears to be a cause for concern...|$|R
40|$|The primary aim of {{the present}} thesis was to {{investigate}} the role that individual and situational factors play in moderating the impact that pre-event expectancies have on judgements of a tennis player's performance. The current programme of research utilised a between subjects design with competitive tennis players (Studies 1 and 2) and undergraduate volunteers (Studies 3, 4 and 5) being assigned to one of four experimental conditions in each study. The results of Study 1 supported past research findings (Buscombe et al., 2006) confirming the role that body language plays in influencing the impressions formed of tennis players. However, the results did not demonstrate <b>expectancy</b> <b>effects</b> with early judgements of a performer failing to influence subsequent ratings of that individual's play. Study 2 found that the participants' level of trait confidence and trait anxiety did not moderate the impact of body language on judgements of performance. Study 3 demonstrated an interaction between body language and time pressure (F(l, 53) = 12. 00, p=. OOl) such that when under time pressure the participants rated the target's play more favourably having previously viewed the player displaying positive (M= 42. 76, SD= 7. 25) as opposed to negative (M= 24. 2 S, SD= 5. lS) body language. As such, it was concluded that time pressure may serve to moderate <b>expectancy</b> <b>effects</b> in sport. Study 3 also indicated that a perceiver's dispositional need for closure did not exert any influence over judgments of the performer. Study 4 demonstrated that increasing the participants' accountability for their judgements did not moderate <b>expectancy</b> <b>effects.</b> However, in line with the results of Study 3, the player's body language was seen to influence ratings of that individual's performance. Employ a reallife target performer, Study 5 demonstrated that prior knowledge of the target player's recent win/loss record influenced the participants' subsequent ratings of that individual's performance (F(l, llS) =lO. 72,p=. OOl). Specifically, the participants' ratings of play were more favourable having been presented with a positive (M= 41. 7, SE=. S 7), as opposed to a negative (M= 37. 74, SE=. S 3) prior playing record for the performer. Overall, the thesis indicates that <b>expectancy</b> <b>effects</b> are evident in sport and that the length of time permitted to a perceiver to form a judgement of an athlete may moderate these effects. This thesis provides the first structured examination in the extant literature of the role that individual and situational factors play in moderating <b>expectancy</b> <b>effects</b> in sport. Furthermore, the thesis provides the first indication that <b>expectancy</b> <b>effects</b> may be witnessed in real-life contests between two sports performers.

40|$|Per definition, alcohol expectancies (after alcohol I expect X), and {{drinking}} motives (I drink to achieve X) are conceptually distinct constructs. Theorists {{have argued that}} motives mediate the association between expectancies {{and drinking}} outcomes. Yet, given the use of different instruments, do these constructs remain distinct when assessment items are matched? The present study tested to what extent motives mediated the link between expectancies and alcohol outcomes when identical items were used, first as expectancies and then as motives. A linear structural equation model was estimated based on a national representative sample of 5, 779 alcohol-using students in Switzerland (mean age = 15. 2 years). The results showed that expectancies explained up to 38 % {{of the variance in}} motives. Together with motives, they explained up to 48 % of the variance in alcohol outcomes (volume, 5 + drinking, and problems). In 10 of 12 outcomes, there was a significant mediated effect that was often higher than the direct <b>expectancy</b> <b>effect.</b> For coping, the <b>expectancy</b> <b>effect</b> was close to zero, indicating the strongest form of mediation. In only one case (conformity and 5 + drinking), there was a direct <b>expectancy</b> <b>effect</b> but no mediation. To conclude, the study demonstrates that motives are distinct from expectancies even when identical items are used. Motives are more proximally related to different alcohol outcomes, often mediating the effects of expectancies. Consequently, the effectiveness of interventions, particularly those aimed at coping drinkers, should be improved through a shift in focus from expectancies to drinking motives...|$|E

40|$|Nicotinic {{mechanisms}} {{may play}} a role in the cognitive deficits of Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s disease (PD). Recently, on a cognitively demanding strategy-based priming task, nicotine selectively affected controlled semantic processing in young adult non-smokers as reported by Holmes et al. (International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology 11, 389 - 399, 2008). Such controlled semantic processing is compromised in PD. This study investigated the effects of acute transdermal nicotine on controlled semantic processing in nonsmokers with PD (n = 10) and non-smoking matched controls (n = 16) using a strategy-based semantic priming paradigm. Transdermal nicotine patches (7 mg/ 24 h) were administered in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. Participants were instructed to expect target words from specified semantic categories based on the primes, while unexpected targets were also presented. Priming conditions included those concurring with trained expectations (expected-related and expected-unrelated), those which did not (unexpected-related and unexpected-unrelated), and neutral-baseline conditions. Controls evidenced significant expectancy effects (i. e. reaction-time differences for expected vs. unexpected conditions) under both drug states. An <b>expectancy</b> <b>effect</b> was not evident for PD under placebo due to a lack of reaction-time slowing for unexpected conditions. However, under nicotine an <b>expectancy</b> <b>effect</b> was present for PD at a level comparable to controls.

40|$|The general pourpose of {{the present}} {{investigation}} was to study the <b>expectancy</b> <b>effect</b> on Experimenter's behavior proposed by Rosenthal, R. (1964) {{as well as the}} effect of Subject's role on the interpersonal non-intentional communication of the two. 1. Procedure: 18 female undergraduate experimenters employing a Taffel-type task conducted a verbal conditioning experiment with 87 male undergraduate subjects. For half the experimenters, the instructions claimed that their subjects had such personality characteristics that they would be easily conditioned. The rest of the experimenters were not especially given such instructions. In addition, the subjects in each group were divided into two subgroups-apprehensive subjects and un-apprehensive subjects. Therefore, a 2 × 2 matrix was adopted in this study. 2. Results: <b>Expectancy</b> <b>effect</b> on Experimenter's behavior showed as differentiated voice expresseions (like speaking fast or vividly). Meanwhile, the awareness of subjects under non-expectancy condtion was enhanced. Apprehensive subjects caused experimenters to behave positively toward them (like nodding, smiling) and regarded experimenters favorably. At the same time they were evaluated favorably by their experimenters. How preferably the experimenters evaluated un-apprehensive subjects negatively correlated with the magunitude of verbal condtioning under expectancy condition, while under non-expectancy condition positive correlation between them was found. These findings could be explained by "Congruency Model" reported by Smith F. J. & Luginbuhl, E. R. (1976). However, this model was not necessarily sufficient for the complete explanation as apprehensive subjects got less feedback from experimenters...|$|E
50|$|In {{discussing}} work {{related to}} this model, Brophy (1983) made several important observations about teacher expectation effects. First and foremost, he argued {{that most of the}} beliefs teachers hold about student are accurate, and so their expectations usually reflect students' actual performance levels. As a result, Brophy contended that selffulfilling prophecy effects have relatively weak effects on student achievement, changing achievement 5% to 10%, although he did note that such effects usually are negative expectation effects rather than positive effects. Second, he pointed out that various situational and individual difference factors influence the extent to which teacher expectations will act as self-fulfilling prophecies. For instance, Brophy stated that <b>expectancy</b> <b>effects</b> may be larger in the early elementary grades, because teachers have more one-on-one interactions with students then, as they attempt to socialize children into the student role. In the upper elementary grades more whole-class teaching methods are used, which may minimize expectation effects. Some evidence supports this claim; <b>expectancy</b> <b>effects</b> in Rosenthal and Jacobson's (1968) study were strongest during the earlier grades. Raudenbush's (1984) meta-analysis of findings from different teacher expectancy studies in which expectancies were induced by giving teachers artificial information about children's intelligence showed that <b>expectancy</b> <b>effects</b> were stronger in Grades 1 and 2 than in Grades 3 through Grade 6, especially when the information was given to teachers during the first few weeks of school. These findings are particularly relevant because they show a form of the expectancy theory: how teachers have certain expectations of students, and how they treat the students differently because of those expectations.|$|R

40|$|While {{much of the}} {{attention}} focused on college alcohol use {{has been on the}} prevalence of heavy drinking and alcohol-related physical and behavioral harm, little is known about individual drinkers' experiences with alcohol, that is, their fluctuations in alcohol consumption and consequences over time. The present study used an intensive repeated measures within-person design to explore the extent to which intraindividual variation in the experience of alcohol-related consequences was a function of frequency of intoxication and the role alcohol expectancies played in those relationships. Across 10 consecutive weeks in one semester, 200 first-year college students completed weekly telephone interviews. Testing hypotheses based on harm reduction principles, hierarchical linear models were used to examine: (1) whether the concept of the point of diminished returns applied to first-year college students' alcohol use, and (2) whether there was an <b>expectancy</b> <b>effect</b> in the relationship between frequency of intoxication and the experience of alcohol-related consequences. Within-person (Level 1) analyses examined whether students' reports of heavy alcohol use were associated with a differential likelihood of experiencing positive and negative consequences compared to when moderate amounts of alcohol were consumed. Between-person (Level 2) analyses examined the extent to which within-person co-variation between alcohol use and consequences was moderated by alcohol expectancies. The results supported the general hypothesis of harm reduction, that negative consequences were minimized with low to moderate amounts of alcohol consumption. In contrast, positive consequences increased with more days of intoxication, not supporting the concept of the point of diminished returns in this population. Finally, an <b>expectancy</b> <b>effect</b> was found for moderate drinking weeks, but not for intoxicated drinking weeks. Students who felt it was more important to experience positive and to avoid experiencing negative consequences reported more positive and fewer negative consequences on weeks of moderate drinking. Discussion focuses on implications for harm reduction in general and programming targeted for the college population...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background When {{subjects}} use cues {{to prepare}} for a likely stimulus or a likely response, reaction times are facilitated by valid cues but prolonged by invalid cues. In studies on combined <b>expectancy</b> <b>effects,</b> two cues can independently give information regarding two dimensions of the forthcoming task. In certain situations, cueing effects on one dimension are reduced when the cue on the other dimension is invalid. According to the Adjusted Expectancy Model, cues affect different processing levels and a mechanism is presumed which is sensitive to the validity of early level cues and leads to online adjustment of <b>expectancy</b> <b>effects</b> at later levels. To examine the predictions of this model cueing of stimulus modality was combined with response cueing. Results Behavioral measures showed the interaction of cueing effects. Electrophysiological measures of the lateralized readiness potential (LRP) and the N 200 amplitude confirmed the predictions of the model. The LRP showed larger effects of response cues on response activation when modality cues were valid rather than invalid. N 200 amplitude was largest with valid modality cues and invalid response cues, medium with invalid modality cues, and smallest with two valid cues. Conclusion Findings support the view that the validity of early level <b>expectancies</b> modulates the <b>effects</b> of late level expectancies, which included response activation and response conflict in the present study. </p...|$|R

We thus attribute the strong correlation between the formation of human capital and life expectancy not merely to a higher marginal benefit arising from a longer payback period but also to a lower marginal cost arising from a prolonged intergenerational overlap.

40|$|The {{endogenous}} orienting {{of spatial}} {{attention has been}} studied with both informative central cues and informative peripheral cues. Central cues studies are difficult to compare with studies that have used uninformative peripheral cues due to the differences in stimulus presentation.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to determine the impact of expectation associated with placebo and caffeine ingestion. We used a three-armed, randomized, double-blind design. Two three-armed experiments varying instruction (true, false, control) investigated the role of expectations of changes in arousal (blood pressure, heart rate), subjective well-being, and reaction time (RT). In Experiment 1 (N = 45), decaffeinated coffee was administered, and expectations were produced in one group by making them believe they had ingested caffeinated coffee.

40|$|Energy drinks {{have become}} very popular {{over the past few}} years with over half the student {{population}} in colleges and universities consuming them at least once a month (Malinauskas et al., 2007). It has been reported that the most common reasons why students consume energy drinks are to maintain alertness, reduce symptoms of hangover, increase energy, to help with driving and to prevent sleepiness (Attila and Cakir, 2011; Malinauskas et al., 2007). Previous research has suggested that energy drinks enhance sensorimotor speed, behaviour, and reduce levels of fatigue (Alford et al., 2001; Horne and Reyner, 2001; Howard and Marczinski, 2010; Kennedy and Scholey, 2004; Smit et al., 2004). The two key ingredients found in energy drinks are caffeine and glucose which have been examined together and alone, which have indicated enhanced reaction times, improvement in both verbal memory and sustained attention and more recently there is evidence to show that expectancy may play a key role in predicting intentions of future consumption (Adan and serra-Grabulosa, 2010). According to Kirsch (1997) people have specific expectations when they consume psychoactive substances that trigger physiological and psychological reactions, which tend to be independent of the psychoactive substance ingested. The concept of expectancy effects can be unambiguous especially when the information provided to the participants prior to the experimental study is specific to a possible outcome response. This thesis investigated the extent of <b>expectancy</b> <b>effect</b> on cognition and mood when psychoactive drinks containing caffeine and glucose were consumed in comparison to non-psychoactive drinks. The investigation commenced with examining the independent effects of caffeine and glucose, followed by the combination of caffeine and glucose as an energy drink on mood and cognition. The investigation advanced by comparing drink presentation effects (i. e., consuming the experimental drink from a branded bottle versus from a glass) irrespective of drink content on mood and cognition. Finally, the investigation lead to exploring what factors may predict expectancy effects when participants’ consumed psychoactive drinks among healthy adults. This was done by applying the Theory of Planned Behaviour model (TPB) (Azjen, 1991) to explore the contribution of specific attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control to the extent of expectancy effects as well as to behavioural intention, with additional variables including; beliefs, habits, past-behaviour, selfidentity. Self-identity representing someone who drinks energy drinks regularly. The level of internal consistency for Cronbach’s alpha was conducted for each variable within the TPB model and for the additional variables included for test reliability. This thesis consisted of four studies, which found that consumption of caffeine and glucose independently and also in combination resulted in psychoactive effects on mood and cognition. Experiment 2 was the only study, which indicated an <b>expectancy</b> <b>effect</b> for immediate verbal recall task and the mood subscale tension. Conversely, for experiment 4 there was a reverse effect found for the immediate verbal recall task. However, there were significant expectancy and psychoactive effects found for mood subscales throughout the four studies. It was also found that the TPB model had two significant variables past-behaviour and self-identity predicted intentions suggesting that participants who regularly consume psychoactive beverages have salient beliefs about consuming psychoactive drinks and the TPB model can be utilised to predict their intentions. Furthermore, the Theory of planned behaviour model found that habit and self-identity significantly predicted participants’ expectancy effects on the vigour. Indicating consumers of energy drinks are familiar with expected outcome response. This model was unsuccessful in predicting expectancy response for cognitive performance. Thus, overall the findings from the four studies indicated that caffeine and glucose have cognitive enhancing properties, which also positively improve mood. However, expectancy effects have been identified for mood only, whereas the overall findings within this thesis were unable to identify significant predictors of <b>expectancy</b> <b>effect</b> and response...|$|E

A series of hypotheses were derived which predicted that the external inhibition treatment would produce significant reductions in the self-report, behavioral, and physiological channels being assessed. It was also predicted that these reductions in anxiety for subjects receiving the external inhibition treatment would be significantly greater than those evidenced by subjects receiving procedures designed to control for <b>expectancy</b> <b>effects</b> and repeated stimulus exposures.

Three separate selection criteria were utilized to help insure that only those subjects who were highly fearful of spiders were selected for participation in the study: (1) a total score on the SPQ that was within the upper 25...|$|R
40|$|Attentional {{behavior}} in complex visual workspaces {{is driven by}} the physical and temporal characteristics of the display, the goals and knowledge of the operator, and task demands. Accordingly, to develop effective displays, designers must understand how these factors interact to influence attentional allocation within the display and the detectability of critical alerts. In the current study, participants performed a central highway-in-the-sky (HITS) manual tracking task and a peripheral alert detection task concurrently while alert eccentricity, salience, expectancy, and central task workload were manipulated. Eccentricity and <b>expectancy</b> <b>effects</b> were observed in both hit rates and response times (RTs). RT evinced interactions of salience with both eccentricity and expectancy, indicating that the absence of dynamic distractors allowed for more rapid detection of near alerts and more effective use of top-down attentional guidance in the detection of targets in high <b>expectancy</b> locations. <b>Effects</b> also manifested in PDT, with interactions between workload, salience, and target expectancy. Results demonstrate interactions among multiple bottom-up and top-down factors in the control of visual attention within a complex workspace...|$|R
