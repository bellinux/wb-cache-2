5|$|All Operation Crossroads {{operations}} were <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> personnel from {{being exposed to}} more than 0.1 roentgen (R) per day. At the time, this {{was considered to be}} an amount of radiation that could be tolerated for long periods without any harmful effects on health. Since there was no special clothing or radiation shielding available, the protection plan relied on managing who went where, when, and for how long.|$|E
5|$|In 1859, {{the castle}} was re-equipped with heavier artillery, a {{combination}} of 32-pounder (15kg) and 68-pounder (31kg) guns. A new magazine was constructed, comprising a large, brick-built building divided into three rooms for storing gunpowder, specially <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the powder dry. The exterior gun emplacements were also redesigned, reusing the 1806 foundations; the two surviving emplacements, in the north-east and north-west bastions, date from 1859.|$|E

This act placed severe penalties on persons who used intimidation, bribery, or physical assault to prevent citizens from voting and placed elections under Federal jurisdiction.|$|E
5|$|Four EEF {{infantry}} brigades of 10,000 rifles attacked four Ottoman regiments of 4,500 rifleswhich were {{reinforced by}} two divisions to over 8,000. Both sides suffered heavy losses. The attacks {{were to be}} carried out by well-prepared troops, with overwhelming artillery support and six Mark IV tanks. These attacks were <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the Gaza garrison of 8,000 riflemen supported by 116 guns in place after the capture of Beersheba and during preparations for the main EEF attacks on Hareira and Sheria.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, {{the corps}} began {{a number of}} {{training}} initiatives with the Republic of Korea Army. These included Operation Key Resolve, a command post exercise simulating major, high intensity combat operations. The exercises were held in Yongin, South Korea. These operations were <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the corps familiar with commanding during large-scale conventional warfare, as opposed to counter-insurgency tactics it employed during its two tours in Iraq. Upon return to the United States, the corps conducted similar exercises at Fort Hood.|$|E
5|$|Ship's {{regulations}} were <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> third class passengers confined to their {{area of the}} ship. The Titanic was fitted with grilles to prevent the classes from mingling and these gates were normally kept closed, although the stewards could open them {{in the event of}} an emergency. In the rush following the collision, the stewards, occupied with waking up sleeping passengers and leading groups of women and children to the boat deck, did not have time to open all the gates, leaving many of the confused third class passengers stuck below decks.|$|E

2500|$|Most {{higher quality}} {{instruments}} are <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> prevent or reduce galvanic corrosion between any steel in the valves and springs, and the brass of the tubing. [...] This {{may take the}} form of desiccant <b>design,</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the valves dry, sacrificial zincs, replaceable valve cores and springs, plastic insulating washers, or nonconductive or noble materials for the valve cores and springs. Some instruments use several such features.|$|R

5|$|The {{cities where}} {{emperors}} lived frequently in this period—Milan, Trier, Arles, Sirmium, Serdica, Thessaloniki, Nicomedia and Antioch—were treated as alternate imperial seats, {{to the exclusion}} of Rome and its senatorial elite. A new style of ceremony was developed, emphasizing the distinction of the emperor from all other persons. The quasi-republican ideals of Augustus' primus inter pares were abandoned for all but the tetrarchs themselves. Diocletian took to wearing a gold crown and jewels, and forbade the use of purple cloth to all but the emperors. His subjects were required to prostrate themselves in his presence (adoratio); the most fortunate were allowed the privilege of kissing the hem of his robe (proskynesis, προσκύνησις). Circuses and basilicas were <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the face of the emperor perpetually in view, and always in a seat of authority. The emperor became a figure of transcendent authority, a man beyond the grip of the masses. His every appearance was stage-managed. This style of presentation was not new—many of its elements were first seen in the reigns of Aurelian and Severus—but it was only under the tetrarchs that it was refined into an explicit system.|$|E
5|$|The UChicago Arts program joins {{academic}} {{departments and}} {{programs in the}} Division of the Humanities and the College, as well as professional organizations including the Court Theatre, the Oriental Institute, the Smart Museum of Art, the Renaissance Society, University of Chicago Presents, and student arts organizations. The university has an artist-in-residence program and scholars in performance studies, contemporary art criticism, and film history. It has offered a doctorate in music composition since 1933 and in cinema and media studies since 2000, a master {{of fine arts in}} visual arts (early 1970s), and a master of arts in the humanities with a creative writing track (2000). It has bachelor's degree programs in visual arts, music, and art history, and, more recently, cinema and media studies (1996) and theater and performance studies (2002). The College's general education core includes a “dramatic, musical, and visual arts” requirement, inviting students to study the history of the arts, stage desire, or begin working with sculpture. Several thousand major and non-major undergraduates enroll annually in creative and performing arts classes. UChicago is often considered the birthplace of improvisational comedy as the Compass Players student comedy troupe evolved into The Second City improv theater troupe in 1959. The Reva and David Logan Center for the Arts opened in October 2012, five years after a $35 million gift from alumnus David Logan and his wife Reva. The center includes spaces for exhibitions, performances, classes, and media production. The Logan Center was designed by Tod Williams and Billie Tsien. This building is actually entirely glass. The brick is a facade <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the glass safe from the wind. The architects later removed sections of the bricks when pressure arose in the form of complaints that the views of the city were blocked.|$|E

25|$|For maximum {{efficiency}} of particle removal and to decrease resistance to airflow through the filter, particulate filters are <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> {{the velocity of}} air flow through the filter as low as possible.

25|$|The {{design of}} Jika Jika {{was based on}} the idea of six {{separate}} units at the end of radiating spines.

The furnishings were sparse and prisoners exercised in aviary-like escape proof yards.|$|E
50|$|The first wire race bearing {{was invented}} in 1934 by Erich Franke, co-founder of Franke & Heydrich KG in Aalen, Germany (nowadays Franke GmbH). As a young design {{engineer}} of Carl-Zeiss-Werke in Jena, Franke intended <b>to</b> <b>design</b> a very space-saving bearing for an optical device. The aim of his thoughts was a much closer relation between bearing and enclosing <b>design</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> it as compact and as lightweight as possible.|$|R
