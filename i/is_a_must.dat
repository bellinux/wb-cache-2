5|$|The kulintang player’s {{ability to}} improvise within the {{parameters}} of a rhythmic mode <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>must.</b> As with gamelan orchestras, each kulintang mode {{has a kind of}} theme the kulintang player “dresses up” by variations of ornamentation, manipulating segments by inserting repetitions, extensions, insertions, suspensions, variations and transpositions. This occurs at the discretion of the kulintang player. Therefore, the kulintang player functions not only as the one carrying the melody, but also as the conductor of the entire ensemble. She determines the length of each rendition and could change the rhythm at any time, speeding up or slowing down, accord to her personal taste and the composition she plays.|$|E

25|$|Phenytoin {{was once}} another {{first-line}} therapy, although the prodrug fosphenytoin can be administered {{three times as}} fast and with far fewer injection site reactions. If these or any other hydantoin derivatives are used, then cardiac monitoring <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>must</b> if they are administered intravenously. Because the hydantoins take 15–30 minutes to work, a benzodiazepine or barbiturate is often coadministered. Because of diazepam's short duration of action, they were often administered together anyway.|$|E

25|$|This breed {{requires}} expert veterinary {{attention in}} areas such as birthing and dental care. Dental care <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>must</b> for these small dogs, whose jaw size makes for weaker teeth. Although daily brushing provides the best preventative measure, feeding a dental diet or using dental chews for dogs is an effective approach pet owners can take to help prevent and control accumulation of plaque and tartar to avoid consequences of severe periodontal disease. The best physical characteristics of dog food to contribute to cleaning a dog's teeth would be food that is large and dense, that way there is more time spent chewing which leads {{to the surface of the}} teeth being cleaned.|$|E
25|$|Kapugedara was {{appointed}} as the vice {{captain of the}} ODI squad for the series against India in late July 2017.

He captained third ODI, which <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>must</b> win game for series alive. However, he won the toss and elected to bat first. The decision went wrong very quickly, where Sri Lanka only managed to score 218 at the end. India won the match easily and won eighth consecutive bilateral ODI series win against Sri Lanka.

25|$|To {{accurately}} {{control the}} pulse, a full {{characterization of the}} pulse spectral phase <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>must</b> {{in order to get}} certain pulse spectral phase (such as transform-limited). Then, a spatial light modulator can be used in the 4f plane to control the pulse. Multiphoton intrapulse interference phase scan (MIIPS) is a technique based on this concept. Through the phase scan of the spatial light modulator, MIIPS can not only characterize but also manipulate the ultrashort pulse to get the needed pulse shape at target spot (such as transform-limited pulse for optimized peak power, and other specific pulse shapes). If the pulse shaper is fully calibrated, this technique allows controlling the spectral phase of ultrashort pulses using a simple optical setup with no moving parts. However the accuracy of MIIPS is somewhat limited with respect to other techniques, such as frequency-resolved optical gating (FROG).|$|E
