5|$|Blakeney Point has a mixed {{colony of}} about 500 harbour and grey seals. The harbour seals have their young between June and August, and the pups, which can swim almost immediately, {{may be seen}} on the mud flats. Grey seals breed in winter, between November and January; their young cannot swim until they have lost their first white coat, so they are {{restricted}} to dry land for their first three or four weeks, and can be viewed on the beach during this period. Grey seals colonised a site in east Norfolk in 1993, and started breeding regularly at Blakeney in 2001. It is possible that they now outnumber harbour seals off the Norfolk coast. Seal-watching boat trips run from Blakeney and Morston harbours, giving good views without disturbing the seals. The corpses of 24 female or juvenile harbour seals were found in the Blakeney area between March 2009 and August 2010, each with spirally cut wounds consistent with the animal having been drawn through a <b>ducted</b> <b>propeller.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{resulting}} aircraft—a midwing monoplane {{of mostly}} wooden construction dubbed the Stipa-Caproni or Caproni Stipa—was strikingly ungainly in appearance. The fuselage was a barrel-like tube, short and fat, open {{at both ends}} to form the tapered duct, with twin open cockpits in tandem mounted in a hump on top of it. The wings were elliptical and passed through the duct and the engine nacelle inside it. The duct itself had a profile {{similar to that of}} the airfoils, and a fairly small rudder and elevators were mounted on the trailing edge of the duct, allowing the <b>ducted</b> <b>propeller</b> wash to flow directly over them as it exited the fuselage to improve handling. The propeller was mounted inside the fuselage tube, flush with the leading edge of the fuselage, and the 120-horsepower de Havilland Gipsy III engine that powered it was mounted within the duct behind it at the midpoint of the fuselage. The aircraft had low, fixed, spatted main landing gear and a tailwheel, making it look as if it was squatting when on the ground. It was painted in a blue-and-cream scheme of the type used on racing aircraft of the day, and its rudder bore the colors of the Italian flag.|$|E

2500|$|The aircraft's {{wing and}} <b>ducted</b> <b>propeller</b> were tested on a piston-engined test bed, the XAZ-1 Marvelette.

It successfully completed a 100-hour flying program for the US Army in 1969, where it demonstrated good STOL performance, taking off within 125ft (38m), and although the boundary layer control system was not as effective as hoped, it still provided {{a large amount of}} test data.

2500|$|The {{resultant}} {{design was}} a shoulder-winged monoplane {{powered by a}} single Allison T63 turboprop engine driving a pusher <b>ducted</b> <b>propeller.</b> The aircraft's structure was made completely of fiberglass, making the Marvel the first example of an all-composite aircraft. The boundary layer control system used a blower driven by the engine to draw suction through {{more than one million}} tiny holes in the wings and fuselage, while instead of conventional flaps the Marvel used a form of wing warping to deflect the wing trailing edges to vary the wing's camber. The aircraft's tail surfaces were attached to the duct around the propeller, extending behind the duct. The undercarriage, of the so-called [...] "Pantobase" [...] configuration, with tandem wheels fitted within two sprung wooden pontoons, was meant to allow operation from rough surfaces, or even from water. [...] It was constructed mainly of fiberglass, with steel used for reinforcement and as heat shields around the engine.|$|E
2500|$|Aérotrain I80 was a {{full-size}} passenger-carrying car for intercity service. It was 25.6m long, 3.2m wide, 3.3m high, had {{a mass of}} 11.25t empty, and had 80 passenger seats. In its original configuration (as I80-250 for 250km/h), it was propelled by twin Turboméca TurmoIIIE3 turboshaft ( [...] each) powering a <b>ducted</b> <b>propeller,</b> 2.3m in diameter, with seven blades of variable pitch. A Turboméca Turmastazou14 turboshaft engine powered the air compressors (six horizontal for the support and six vertical for guidance).

40|$|The use of <b>ducted</b> <b>propellers</b> {{is common}} in VTOL UAV design. The {{presence}} of a <b>duct</b> improves <b>propeller</b> efficiency, provides protection and improves safety. The aim {{of this paper is}} to employ a sensitivity study for the total thrust of a <b>ducted</b> twin counter-rotating <b>propeller</b> system design for UAV applications using computational fluid dynamics. Two factors were investigated: propeller spacing and difference between blades pitch angle. Using 4 discrete values for both factors, 16 designs were analyzed and evaluated.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{autonomous}} underwater vehicles, AUV, {{are equipped with}} commercial <b>ducted</b> <b>propellers,</b> most of them produced originally for the remote operated vehicle, ROV, industry. However, AUVs and ROVs are supposed to work quite differently since the ROV operates in almost the bollard pull condition, while the AUV works at larger cruising speeds. Moreover, they can have an influence in the maneuverability of AUV due to the lift the duct generates in the most distant place of the vehicle's center of mass. In this work, it is proposed the modeling of the hydrodynamic forces and moment on a <b>duct</b> <b>propeller</b> according to a numerical (CFD) simulation, and analytical and semi-empirical, ASE, approaches. Predicted values are compared to experimental results produced in a towing tank.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the validation of a generalised semi-analytical actuator disk model {{as applied to}} the study of the flow around <b>ducted</b> <b>propellers.</b> The method, which returns the exact solution as a superposition of ring vortex, duly accounts for the rotation of the wake, the convergence of the slipstream, and the nonlinear mutual interaction between the <b>duct</b> and the <b>propeller.</b> Furthermore, it can deal with an arbitrary radial distribution of the load and ducts of general shape. In order to validate the previously mentioned actuator disk model, results obtained through it are compared with those provided by the so-called "CFD actuator disk method".
