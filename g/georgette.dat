5|$|Within {{hours of}} {{becoming}} a depression on September20, strong wind shear caused convection to diminish. However, data from an ASCAT scatterometer pass revealed that the system attained gale-force winds, resulting in the depression being upgraded to a tropical storm on 0000 UTC September21. Operationally, the first advisory on storm was not issued until 1200 UTC, where it was named <b>Georgette.</b> Meanwhile, thunderstorm activity increased {{near the center of}} the storm. Little change took place throughout the day as the storm approached Baja California Sur. Around 1800UTC, <b>Georgette</b> made landfall near San Jose del Cabo with winds of 40mph (65km/h). Additionally, a barometric pressure of 999mbar (hPa; 29.5inHg) was measured. Shortly before entering the Gulf of California, <b>Georgette</b> weakened to a tropical depression. Maintaining winds of 35mph (55km/h), the storm later made a second landfall near San Carlos in Sonora. Shortly after moving inland, the low-level circulation dissipated over the mountains of western Mexico.|$|E

5|$|The {{season began}} with record-breaking {{activity}} with four named storms, including two major hurricanes, developing {{by the end}} of June. Accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) values exceeded 300percent of the average for the month of June. Activity abruptly diminished thereafter, with July, August, and September seeing record low storm development. The Eastern Pacific season proper ended with Tropical Storm <b>Georgette's</b> dissipation on September23, a month before the climatological mean. The year's final cyclone, Omeka, developed in the off-season on December18, marking a record-late formation date in the satellite-era. Although there were relatively few storms, the season proved exceptionally deadly and destructive. Torrential rains associated with Agatha and Eleven-E killed well over 200people in Central America and Mexico and left more than $1.5billion in damage.|$|R
5|$|The {{origins of}} Tropical Storm <b>Georgette</b> {{were from a}} {{tropical}} wave that moved off {{the west coast of}} Africa on September1. Lacking organization, the wave was difficult to track as it moved across the Atlantic basin. Convection eventually increased on September7, as the system approached the Lesser Antilles. On September14, Hurricane Karl developed from the northern portion of the system over the western Caribbean Sea; however, the southern portion of the wave crossed northern Central America and entered the Pacific Ocean on September17. The area of disturbed weather was first mentioned on the National Hurricane Center (NHC) around that time, but signification development was initially not anticipated. Wind shear was forecast to decrease slightly; however, and based on this the NHC gave the system a medium chance of undergoing tropical cyclogenesis during the next two days.|$|E
5|$|Chi's {{character}} is voiced by Rie Tanaka, and <b>Georgette</b> Rose in its English counterpart. The anime and manga storylines are essentially the same, but they differ slightly. These differences include {{the events in}} the ending, other things such as describing Elda's memory loss, and her special program. In the anime for example, it is explained that Hibiya reset Elda's memories after her husband's death rather than Elda losing them when she took Freya's program in. Another difference is the special program that was placed into Elda in the anime, this program appears to have an alternate effect. If Chi finds the Person just for her, all persocoms would be granted the ability to feel emotion. The reason for this is since Ichiro Mihara was the creator of persocoms, he viewed them all as his children. His wish was that if Chi were able to find someone who loved her in return, all his children would be able to share in this happiness by being able to feel emotions the way humans do.|$|E
5|$|Throughout its duration, Leon-Eline lasted 29days, {{a record}} {{longevity}} for a storm {{in the southern}} Indian Ocean. The track was over 11,000km (6,800mi), or about 25% of the Earth's circumference. However, Eline was in the south-west Indian Ocean for 21days, which is the third most on record. It was behind Cyclone Alibera in 1989 and Cyclone <b>Georgette</b> in 1968, the latter of which lasted 24days in the basin. The MFR noted that Eline was the strongest cyclone to strike the nation in several decades. The storm was uncommon in its landfall on mainland Africa; only 5% of storms in the basin do so, and most that cross or form in the Mozambique Channel turn to the south. Eline was unusual in maintaining its identity so far inland, aided by increased moisture and enhanced upper-level environmental conditions over southern Africa. The storm's long track brought heavy rainfall across Madagascar and southern Africa, causing additional widespread flooding.|$|E
50|$|Ng {{returned}} to Singapore mainly for three reasons: {{one was to}} set up a workshop and embark his ceramic practice teaching pottery-making. The second was due to his concerns for his family and wanting to provide support to them. The third reason was to heed <b>Georgette's</b> plea to her students to come back to help their alma mater, the Academy, and in Ng's mind he thought that he could start a pottery workshop in the Academy - only to find his suggestion rejected by the Academy administration. Ng started his workshop {{with the help of his}} father, and first designed a series of works created using slip casting and press moulding, and hoped they can make some money but it was not successful. His financial resources depleted soon and Ng decided to seek employment. Through the recommendation of fellow artist Vincent Hoisington, he found employment with the International Planned Parenthood Federation. Thus in 1968 he joined the Federation, working as a visual aids officer for a year.|$|R

A native of Macon, Dallmeyer began her college career at UGA where she received the B. S. degree in geology magna cum laude, with general honors, and with honors in geology in 1973. She was a National Merit Scholar and was named the outstanding senior in geology. She also twirled with the University of Georgia Redcoat Band as a member of the Fabulous <b>Georgettes</b> from 1970 - 1975. In 1977, Dallmeyer received an M. S. degree in geology for her research on the effects of climate change on deep-sea benthic organisms. She then worked with UGA professor James W. Porter for over three years, conducting research in tropical marine biology and ecology in Jamaica and off the Georgia coast. Her coral reef research culminated with a week-long saturation dive in the underwater habitat HYDROLAB in the U. S. Virgin Islands. To pursue her interest in conservation law and policy, Dallmeyer returned to the classroom in 1981, this time at the UGA School of Law. She received her J. D. degree cum laude in 1984. She served as executive articles editor for the Georgia Law Review and was named the Woman of the Year in 1984 by the Georgia Association of Women Lawyers.

5|$|The {{situation}} became dire, forcing {{troops to}} withdraw towards Ham, which itself {{had to be}} evacuated. The Third and Fifth Armies went into retreat. The 1st King's, occupying positions near Vélu Wood during the Battle of Bapaume, came under attack on the 24th but held out until their deteriorating flanks compelled a retreat that was covered by about 30 men from its headquarters. The battalion commander, Lieutenant-Colonel Murray-Lyon, had just 60 men at his command {{when they arrived at}} Beaulencourt later in the day. On 28 March, the offensive was extended to Arras, which was soon repulsed by the Allies. Having lost its momemtum and suffered about 250,000 casualties, comparable to Allied losses, Germany abandoned the operation on 5 April. The German Army did not relent and launched Operation <b>Georgette</b> in Flanders on 9 April. The first-day of the Battle of the Lys involved the three King's battalions of the 165th Brigade, situated at Estaires. The bombardment against Allied positions began at 0410 and the subsequent infantry attack displaced Portuguese forces by 0800, exposing the left flank of the 165th. The King's repulsed the frontal assaults with heavy casualties but continued to be attacked from the flanks.
