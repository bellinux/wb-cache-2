The present study examines the effects of chronic sulfonylurea treatment on in vivo insulin action. Peripheral insulin levels, hepatic glucose production (Ra), and overall glucose disposal (Rd) were studied in six awake, normal dogs given both 0. 5 and 1. 0 mU/kg per min pork insulin for 2. 5 h. This produces stable hyperinsulinemia from 15 to 150 min. Fasting euglycemia was held constant by the glucose clamp technique and averaged 99 % basal glucose in all studies. Ra and Rd were determined from infusion of [3 -(3) H]glucose, begun 90 min prior to insulin infusion. 10 mg of the sulfonylurea <b>glipizide,</b> was given daily to the test animals for the 10 to 20 d following appropriate control studies, then was withheld for 24 h, and the dogs were restudied. <b>Glipizide</b> treatment did not significantly alter basal glucose turnover, Ra, mean glucose values, or mean insulin levels as determined by radioimmunoassay.

Dapagliflozin, a selective inhibitor of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT 2), reduces hyperglycemia by increasing urinary glucose excretion independent of insulin and may cause fewer of these adverse effects. We compared the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of dapagliflozin with the sulfonylurea <b>glipizide</b> in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin monotherapy. Research design and methods: This 52 -week, double-blind, multicenter, active-controlled, noninferiority trial randomized patients with type 2 diabetes (baseline mean HbA 1 c, 7. 7 %), who were receiving metformin monotherapy, to add-on dapagliflozin (n = 406) or <b>glipizide</b> (n = 408) up-titrated over 18 weeks, based on glycemic response and tolerability, to ≤ 10 or ≤ 20 mg/day, respectively. Results: The primary end point, adjusted mean HbA 1 c reduction with dapagliflozin (- 0. 52 %) compared with <b>glipizide</b> (- 0. 52 %), was statistically noninferior at 52 weeks. Key secondary end points: dapagliflozin produced significant adjusted mean weight loss (- 3. 2 kg) versus weight gain (1. 2 kg; P < 0. 0001) with <b>glipizide,</b> significantly increased the proportion of patients achieving ≥ 5 % body weight reduction (33. 3 %) versus <b>glipizide</b> (2. 5 %; p < 0. 0001), and significantly decreased the proportion experiencing hypoglycemia (3. 5 %) versus <b>glipizide</b> (40. 8 %; p < 0. 0001). Events suggestive of genital infections and lower urinary tract infections were reported more frequently with dapagliflozin compared with <b>glipizide</b> but responded to standard treatment and rarely led to study discontinuation. Conclusions: Despite similar 52 -week glycemic efficacy, dapagliflozin reduced weight and produced less hypoglycemia than <b>glipizide</b> in type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin.

40|$|Thus, large spherical microcapsules with a coat {{consisting}} of alginate and a mucoadhesive polymer (sodium CMC, methylcellulose, Carbopol, or HPMC) could be prepared by an orifice-ionic gelation process. The microcapsules exhibited good mucoadhesive properties in an in vitro test. <b>Glipizide</b> release from these mucoadhesive microcapsules {{was slow and}} extended over {{longer periods of time}} and depended on composition of the coat. Drug release was diffusion controlled and followed zero-order kinetics after a lag, period of 1 hour. In the in vivo evaluation, alginate-Carbopol microcapsules could sustain the hypoglycemic effect of <b>glipizide</b> over a 14 -hour period. These mucoadhesive microcapsules are, thus, suitable for oral controlled release of <b>glipizide...</b>|$|E
40|$|A Reversed Phase Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatographic (RP-UPLC) {{method was}} {{developed}} for the determination of <b>glipizide</b> (GLI) in in-vitro study during formulation development. The chromatographic separation was achieved on a Acquity UPLC BEH C 18 (50 mm × 2. 1 mm, 1. 7 µm) column, {{with a mixture of}} 55 volumes of methanol and 45 volumes of buffer contain 0. 001 M sodium dihydrogen phosphate in isocratic elution with flow rate of 0. 3 mL/min. The eluted compound was monitored at a wavelength of 276 nm using a UV detector. The method described herein separated <b>glipizide</b> and <b>glipizide</b> related compound-A from all other formulation components within a run time of 1. 2 min. The RP-HPLC method was developed and validated according to the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines. This method was successfully applied in the quantitative determination of <b>glipizide</b> in in-vitro study during formulation development. The procedure described herein is simple, selective, and reliable for routine quality control analysis as well as stability testing...|$|E
40|$|This study {{assessed}} the possible interactions of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indobufen with one sulphonylurea, <b>glipizide,</b> and with two beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, {{one of which}} is extensively metabolised already in the first passage through the liver (propranolol) while the other essentially escapes biotransformation (atenolol). Indobufen was first given as a single 200 mg dose and then for a 5 day period in a dosage of 200 mg twice daily, to six healthy volunteers. <b>Glipizide</b> (5 mg), propranolol (80 mg) and atenolol (100 mg) were given as single doses before and during indobufen medication. The drug concentrations were measured by selective and sensitive h. p. l. c. methods. The findings suggest that the lipophilic acid indobufen can inhibit the metabolic inactivation of another lipophilic acid, <b>glipizide,</b> but does not interfere with the disposal of the two basic drugs, propranolol and atenolol. The increased <b>glipizide</b> concentrations following indobufen were associated with an enhanced blood glucose reduction. Hence, this interaction may be clinically relevant...|$|E
40|$|The {{metabolic}} clearance rate of insulin (MCRI) in 10 non-obese {{type 2 diabetic}} patients treated with either insulin alone or combined insulin plus sulfonylurea therapy is investigated. A classical 2 -hour euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic glucose clamp using the artificial pancreas was performed in a randomized order after two 6 -week periods of treatment: either with subcutaneous injections of insulin alone or with insulin plus oral administration of the sulfonylurea compound <b>glipizide</b> at the dose of 3 x 10 mg/day. The MCRI was calculated knowing the constant insulin infusion rate (0. 1 U. kg- 1. h- 1) and measuring basal and steady-state plasma free insulin and C-peptide levels. When the test was performed {{at the end of}} the period of treatment with insulin plus <b>glipizide</b> and 30 min after the ingestion of the last dose of 10 mg <b>glipizide,</b> plasma C-peptide levels were significantly increased and steady-state free insulin levels tended to be slightly higher whereas the {{metabolic clearance}} rate of glucose was not affected. The MCRI was significantly reduced by <b>glipizide</b> from 23. 3 +/- 2. 9 to 18. 9 +/- 2. 0 ml. kg- 1. min- 1 p < 0. 05. These results demonstrate that the sulfonylurea <b>glipizide</b> decreases the MCRI. This effect may play a role in the hypoglycemic action of sulfonylureas. Peer reviewe...|$|E
