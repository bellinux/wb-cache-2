50|$|During World War II {{large-scale}} {{battles between}} the Japanese and Allied Navies {{occurred in the}} vicinity of Bawean island, especially during the Dutch East Indies campaign of 1941-1942. On 25 February 1942, the island was captured by the Japanese troopers. On 28 February, in the first Battle of the Java Sea, the Japanese sunk several Allied ships, killing the commander of the East Indies Fleet, Rear Admiral Karel Doorman, on the light cruiser De Ruyter. The Second Battle of the Java Sea, also known as The Battle off Bawean, was fought on 1 March 1942. It resulted in sinking of all the participating Allied ships, including the heavy cruiser HMS Exeter and <b>effective</b> <b>termination</b> of the Anglo-Dutch resistance in the region.

50|$|On 21 July 1938, a {{successful}} mid-air launch of Mercury was executed off {{the west coast}} of Ireland while carrying a 600 lb payload of mixed cargo and mail; it arrived at Boucherville, Montreal, Canada 2860 mi 22 hrs 22 min later, having achieved an average speed of 141 mph. In further flights, the Empire-Mercury combination went on to set a number of long distance records; one such flight was conducted on 6 October 1938, flying from Dundee, Scotland to Orange River, South Africa, covering 6045 mi in 42 hrs 5 min.

50|$|The {{olfactory}} neuroepithelium, which {{lines the}} posterior nasal cavity, {{is exposed to}} a wide range of odorants and airborne toxic compounds. Odorants, which are mostly small lipophilic molecules, enter the mucus flow and reach the odorant receptors on sensory neurons. Odorant sensing is generally a transient process, requiring an <b>effective</b> signal <b>termination,</b> which could be provided by biotransformation of the odorant in the epithelial supporting cells. Xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes in the olfactory epithelium have been suggested to catalyze inactivation and facilitate elimination of odorants.|$|R

5000|$|Norrish and Smith, Trommsdorff, and later, Schultz and Harborth, {{concluded}} that autoacceleration must {{be caused by}} a totally different polymerization mechanism. They rationalized through experiment that a decrease in the termination rate was the basis of the phenomenon. This decrease in termination rate, kt, is caused by the raised viscosity of the polymerization region when the concentration of previously formed polymer molecules increases. Before autoacceleration, chain termination by combination of two free-radical chains is a very rapid reaction that occurs at very high frequency (about one in 104 collisions). However, when the growing polymer molecules - with active free-radical ends - are surrounded in the highly viscous mixture consisting of a growing concentration of [...] "dead" [...] polymer, the rate of termination becomes limited by diffusion. The Brownian motion of the larger molecules in the polymer [...] "soup" [...] is restricted, therefore limiting the frequency of their <b>effective</b> (<b>termination)</b> collisions.|$|E

The court noted that the Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip of 28 September 1995 also referred a number of times to the Palestinian people and its [...] "legitimate rights". According to Thomas Giegerich, with respect to the Palestinian people's right to form a sovereign independent state, [...] "The right of self-determination gives the Palestinian people collectively the inalienable right freely to determine its political status, while Israel, having recognized the Palestinians as a separate people, is obliged to promote and respect this right in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations".|$|E

30|$|We {{present a}} level set-based method for object {{segmentation}} in polarimetric {{synthetic aperture radar}} (PolSAR) images. In our method, a modified energy functional via active contour model is proposed based on complex Gaussian/Wishart distribution model for both single-look and multilook PolSAR images. The modified functional has two interesting properties: (1) the curve evolution does not enter into local minimum; (2) the level set function has a unique stationary convergence state. With these properties, the desired object can be segmented more accurately. Besides, the modified functional allows us to set an <b>effective</b> automatic <b>termination</b> criterion and makes the algorithm more practical. The experimental results on synthetic and real PolSAR images demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Lithospermum {{has been}} widely used in clinic for a long time.

40|$|Abstract—The Rudin-Osher-Fatemi (ROF) {{algorithm}} for denoising and de-blurring {{of still}} digital images {{is well known}} to offer excellent image restoration performance. However, application of the ROF algorithm {{in the past has}} indicated that one can get the best results from the algorithm only when one terminates the algorithm at the “right time ” which turns out to be way before the corresponding parabolic partial differential equation converges to its steady-state solution, and the determination of that right time for terminating the algorithm becomes a key issue for the best utilization of the algorithm. In this paper, a simple yet <b>effective</b> <b>termination</b> criterion for the ROF algorithm is proposed. Performance results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed criterion when it is incorporated with the ROF algorithm. I...|$|E

In low-input cropping systems, mechanical termination of hairy vetch could replace a glyphosate application to control weeds.

40|$|Background: Both {{nifekalant}} hydrochloride (NIF), {{a selective}} IKr blocker, and intravenous amiodarone (AMD), a multi-channel (including IKr blocking) blocker, {{have been reported}} to be efficacious for refractory arrhythmias. However, the optimal use of those antiarrhythmic drugs for refractory arrhythmia with severe heart failure has not been established. Intravenous AMD might be effective for arrhythmias refractory to NIF in patients with severe heart failure. Here, we report that intravenous amiodarone was effective in the treatment of nifekalant-resistant in a group of arrhythmia patients with severe heart failure. Methods: Eleven severe heart failure patients who had received intravenous AMD for treatment of NIF-resistant arrhythmias were included in this study, and retrospective analysis was performed. Clinical efficacy (terminative and preventive effects on arrhythmia) of intravenous AMD was evaluated. Results: All cases were emergent cases and had depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (30 ± 13 %). Clinical arrhythmias were ventricular fibrillation (VF) in four patients, ventricular tachycardia (VT) in six patients, and atrial fibrillation (AF) in one patient. NIF was administered to all patients by intravenous injection. After administration of NIF, VT/VF/AF was terminated in seven of the 10 patients, but a preventive effect was not obtained in any of the patients (NIF-resistance). Intravenous AMD (maintenance dose: 484 ± 166 mg/day) was <b>effective</b> both in <b>termination</b> (80 %) and in prevention (80 %) of VT/VF events in those patients. It was also <b>effective</b> in <b>termination</b> (80 %) and prevention (60 %) of AF events refractory to NIF. During continuous AMD administration, no significant adverse effects or proarrhythmic effects were observed in any of the patients. Five patients died within one month, but there was no arrhythmic deaths. Conclusions: Intravenous AMD was effective in NIF-resistant lethal arrhythmias and was relatively safe in emergent cases with severe heart failure...|$|R
