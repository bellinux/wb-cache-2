25|$|Australia and New Zealand have a {{dividend}} <b>imputation</b> <b>system,</b> wherein companies can attach franking credits or imputation credits to dividends. These franking credits represent the tax {{paid by the}} company upon its pre-tax profits. One dollar of company tax paid generates one franking credit. Companies can attach any proportion of franking up to a maximum amount that is calculated from the prevailing company tax rate: for each dollar of dividend paid, the maximum level of franking is the company tax rate divided by (1 - company tax rate). At the current 30% rate, this works out at 0.30 of a credit per 70 cents of dividend, or 42.857 cents per dollar of dividend. The shareholders {{who are able to}} use them, apply these credits against their income tax bills at a rate of a dollar per credit, thereby effectively eliminating the double taxation of company profits.|$|E

50|$|The basic {{structure}} of the tax, where company profits were taxed as profits, and dividend payments were then taxed as income, remained unchanged until 1973, when a partial <b>imputation</b> <b>system</b> was introduced for dividend payments. Unlike the previous <b>imputation</b> <b>system,</b> the tax credit to the shareholder was less than the corporation tax paid (corporation tax was higher than the standard rate of income tax, but the imputation, or set-off, was only of standard rate tax). When companies made distributions, they also paid the advance corporation tax (known as ACT), which could be set off against the main corporation tax charge, subject to certain limits (the full amount of ACT paid could not be recovered if significantly large amounts of profits were distributed). Individuals and companies who received a dividend from a UK company received a tax credit representing the ACT paid. Individuals could set off the tax credit against their income tax liability.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} how industrialised countries have grappled with these challenges in reforming their taxation of financial intermediation. Despite the inherent difficulties of tax reform, most countries have undergone significant reforms since the 1980 s.

40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of the Australian <b>imputation</b> tax <b>system,</b> there have been problems both in the measurement of the market value of franking (imputation tax) credits and in their application to estimating cash ﬂows and the cost of capital. In the present paper, we provide a convenient and robust resolution to the above problems {{in the context of an}} internally consistent set of equations for the cost of capital, asset valuation and the capital asset pricing model (CAPM). The equations apply under both classical and <b>imputation</b> tax <b>systems</b> and under differential taxation of dividends, capital gains and interest. The simple form of the CAPM presented here is shown to encompass more complex versions of the CAPM, which attempt to accommodate the effect of personal taxes. The valuation equations require an estimate of the market value of $ 1 of the ﬁrm&# 039;s dividends, within which is embedded the market value of the imputation tax credits. Separate estimates of the value of imputation tax credits, or Ofﬁcer&# 039;s gamma factor, are not required...|$|R

We explore three different approaches based on the frequency at the trip/tour level and imputation probability at the epoch level, for each transportation mode.

50|$|Australia, like New Zealand, has a {{dividend}} <b>imputation</b> <b>system,</b> which entitles shareholders {{to claim a}} tax credit for the franking credits attached to dividends, being {{a share of the}} corporate tax paid by the corporation. A recipient of a fully franked dividend on the top marginal tax rate will effectively pay only about 15% tax on the cash amount of the dividend. In effect, when distributed as dividends, the profits of a corporation are taxed at the average of the shareholders' marginal tax rates; otherwise they are taxed at the corporate tax rate.|$|E
50|$|The top company {{tax rate}} is 30%, though through the {{dividend}} <b>imputation</b> <b>system</b> Australian residents only pay this company income tax once as shareholders {{of the company}} on the profits distributed as dividends by Australian-resident corporations. Double taxation relief on resident owners of resident corporations is common in other countries. When an Australian corporation pays corporate income tax, franking credits are generated and can then be applied to dividend payments at a maximum rate of 30 cents per dollar of dividend. Shareholders may then use these credits to offset their own personal income tax payable, including claiming a refund for excess franking credits left over after offsetting all payable income tax.|$|E
50|$|Originally {{introduced}} as a classical tax system, in which companies {{were subject to}} tax on their profits and companies' shareholders were also liable to income tax on the dividends that they received, the first major amendment to corporation tax saw it move to a dividend <b>imputation</b> <b>system</b> in 1973, under which an individual receiving a dividend became entitled to an income tax credit representing the corporation tax already paid by the company paying the dividend. The classical system was reintroduced in 1999, with the abolition of advance corporation tax and of repayable dividend tax credits. Another change saw the single main rate of tax split into three. Tax competition between jurisdictions reduced the main corporate tax rate from 28% in 2008-2010 to a flat rate of 20% as of April 2015.|$|E
40|$|Statistical Data Editing (SDE) is {{the process}} of {{checking}} and correcting data for errors. Winkler (1999) defines it the set of methods used to edit (clean-up) and impute (fill-in) missing or contradictory data. The result of SDE is data {{that can be used for}} analytic purposes. Editing literature goes back to 60 ’s with the contributions of Nordbotten (1965), Pritzker et al. (1965) and Freund and Hartley (1967).

This paper presents a simple equilibrium model which answers that question under certain simplifying assumptions.

40|$|Dividend {{policy is}} always an {{interesting}} topic in financial research. One reason is dividend policy affects capital structure of firms when retained earnings intent to fund the firm (AL-Shubiri, 2011). There are also so many arguments and hypotheses about dividend policy. The motivation {{of this paper is}} to research about factors that might be significant in determining USA and UK dividend policy. Furthermore, the paper wants to give investors a clear understanding of the difference between UK and USA dividend policy. The data used in this paper all comes from DataStream 5. 1 which constituent data of the London Stock Exchange (LSE) of the UK stock market and NASDAQ and New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) of the USA stock market in the period of ten years that from 2001 to 2010. According to the comparison, the dividend payment behaviours of two countries are differently. UK firms always pay higher dividends than USA firms. Dividend pay-outs of UK and USA are affected by different determinants according to the results of fixed effect models. Sales growth is negative correlated with dividend pay-out but leverage is positive correlated with dividend pay-outs in UK. However, just tax is statistically significant for USA firms which positive correlated with dividend pay-outs. Furthermore, regional difference can be found between UK and USA which affects the dividend pay-outs. Miller (1986) claimed that tax is a very important factor that affects dividend pay-out in many countries. The major difference between UK and USA is their tax systems. UK follows an <b>imputation</b> tax <b>system</b> but USA follows a classical tax system. USA firms have a heavy tax burden under classical tax system because double tax should be paid. Simultaneously, dividend payments of firms under <b>imputation</b> tax <b>system</b> are always higher than classical tax system (Alzahrani and Lasfer, 2008) which because USA firms should pay more taxes than UK firms. Hence UK firms have more retained earnings than USA firms. Furthermore, UK firms are encouraged to pay dividends under <b>imputation</b> tax <b>system.</b> Finally, tax reforms also have significant impact on dividend policy. The 2003 dividend tax reforms in USA result in an increase in dividend pay-outs but 1997 ACT reforms in UK reduce dividend pay-outs of firms. Thus, tax actually has significant impact on dividend policy...|$|R
50|$|Until 1973, company {{profits were}} taxed as profits, and {{dividend}} payments were then taxed as income. In 1973, a partial <b>imputation</b> <b>system</b> was introduced for dividend payments, under which companies {{were required to}} withhold tax on dividends, called an advance corporation tax, before they were distributed to shareholders. UK companies could set off the ACT amount withheld against the overall company tax liability, subject to certain limits. (The full amount of ACT paid could not be recovered if significantly large amounts of profits were distributed.) Shareholders of a UK company who received a dividend received a tax credit representing the ACT paid, which could be set off against their overall income tax liability. Non-taxable shareholders, such as pension funds, were entitled to a refund of the ACT amount.|$|E
