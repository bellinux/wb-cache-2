50|$|A {{bridge bearing}} is a {{component}} of a bridge which typically provides a resting surface between bridge piers and the bridge deck. The purpose of a bearing is to allow controlled movement and thereby reduce the stresses involved. Movement could be thermal expansion or contraction, or movement from other sources such as seismic activity. There are several different types of bridge bearings which are used depending {{on a number of}} different factors including the bridge span. The oldest form of bridge bearing is simply two plates resting on top of each other. A common form of modern bridge bearing is the elastomeric bridge bearing. Another type of bridge bearing is the mechanical bridge bearing. There are several types of mechanical bridge bearing, such as the pinned bearing, which in turn includes specific types such as the rocker bearing, and the roller bearing. Another type of mechanical bearing is the <b>fixed</b> <b>bearing,</b> which allows rotation, but not other forms of movement.|$|E

Method: This randomized prospective study aims to compare the effectiveness and efficiency of a standard Rotating platform(mobile bearing) versus <b>Fixed</b> <b>bearing</b> prosthesis in primary TKA, and to evaluate clinical and radiological outcome, in consecutive primary osteoarthritis patients getting admitted for primary TKR at our hospital. We included 32 patients (16 in each group) who were randomly selected, operated and both the groups were followed in prospective manner for 1 year and data collected was assessed by statistical methods.

40|$|Abstract. Characterizing the {{relative}} performance between mobile bearing and <b>fixed</b> <b>bearing</b> knee prosthesis remains {{seen as a}} difficult task as the previous short-term and mid-term clinical studies disable to observe any evidence of superiority of one design over another. The aim {{of the present study}} is to characterize the mechanics comparison between both designs of prosthesis during deep flexional motion with tibial rotation. Three dimensional (3 D) FE model of clinically used mobile bearing posterior stabilized (PS) prosthesis was developed from its CAD data. Explicit finite element model was used to simulate the dynamic loaded deep flexional motion from 0 to 135 ° with neutral and 10 ° tibial rotation. <b>Fixed</b> <b>bearing</b> prosthesis was represented by fixing the tibial insert to the tibial component. The <b>fixed</b> <b>bearing</b> design was found relatively sensitive to flexion motion and tibial rotation in terms of contact area and maximum shear stress as compared to the mobile bearing design. Tibial rotation increased the peak value of maximum shear stress up to 58 MPa for the <b>fixed</b> <b>bearing,</b> on the contrary, the mobile bearing maintained the peak value of maximum shear stress at 31 MPa even with tibial axial rotation. The influence of post-cam design was also discussed in this study.

The aim of our in vitro {{study was to investigate}} wear of a PE tibial insert on a rotating platform as compared to the same insert fixed to the tibial baseplate and articulating with a similar femoral component. All tests were performed at Endolab Laboratories, Rosenheim, Germany using a knee joint simulator following ISO 14243 - 1. Three specific configurations were tested and compared to a loaded soak control : (1) the rotating platform using machined polyethylene (PE), (2) <b>fixed</b> <b>bearing</b> using machined PE, (3) <b>fixed</b> <b>bearing</b> using compressionmoulded PE. Calf serum with a high protein concentration of 30 g/l was chosen as test lubricant. PE wear was measured gravimetrically using the ISO 14243 - 2 protocol. The total wear rates found for all systems tested were low. The mean wear rate was 1. 40 mg per million cycles for the moulded <b>fixed</b> <b>bearing,</b> 4. 07 mg per million cycles for the machined <b>fixed</b> <b>bearing</b> type and 0. 82 mg per million cycles for the machined rotating platform bearing type.

The study was designed as a randomised controlled multi-centre trial. Methods Participants were assigned to interventions by using block-stratified, random allocation. Outcome parameters were active flexion, passive flexion, and Knee Society Score (KSS). Outcome parameters were assessed preoperatively and at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively by an independent nurse. Results Ninety-two patients from one centre were inclu-ded, 46 in each group. Active flexion was comparable for the two groups, 99. 9 for the mobile bearing group and 101 for the <b>fixed</b> <b>bearing</b> group with a baseline controlled difference of 1. 0 (95 % CI- 3. 9 to 5. 8, n. s.). The Clinical KSS was comparable between the two bearing groups (Mobile 90. 0 vs. fixed 92. 4, n. s.).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} {{is to determine the}} functional performance of the mobile bearing total knee replacement prosthesis as compared to the <b>fixed</b> <b>bearing</b> type total knee replacement prosthesis.

A control group of 10 normal subjects, matched by sex and age, was also analysed. No significant biomechanical differences in patients with different total knee replacement designs have been reported from level-walking studies. Slightly better performance of posterior retaining with respect to cruciate sacrificing total knee replacement designs have been claimed from stair climbing studies. Only one study has been conducted regarding mobile versus <b>fixed</b> <b>bearing</b> total knee replacement assessed by gait analysis. This study did not show any biomechanical differences between the two groups. Motion analysis was used to quantify the knee kinematics, kinetics, and electromyography (right and left longissimus dorsi, gluteus medius, rectus femoris, biceps femoris, semitendinosus, gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior muscles) during stair ascent and descent. The mobile bearing group demonstrated a reduced knee extensor moment during stair climbing and descending, and a reduced knee adductor moment during stair climbing. When ascending stairs, most of the mobile bearing patients show a peak knee flexion and a peak knee flexion moment at the late stance phase during the double support period. This kinematic and kinetic pattern is absent in normal subject. Both mobile bearing and <b>fixed</b> <b>bearing</b> groups showed abnormal electromyography patterns in both descending and ascending. During stair climbing, the mobile bearing design demonstrates a different kinematic pattern to the <b>fixed</b> <b>bearing</b> total knee replacement. Lower limb compensatory mechanisms seemed to be adopted particularly by the mobile bearing patients during ascending stairs. Total knee replacement patient with mobile bearing design can feel excessive femoro-tibial motion during daily living activities such as stair climbing and descending.

40|$|In January 2010 European design {{standards}} for structures entered Sweden, replacing the previous standards of railway bridges, Bro 2004 and BV Bro, version 9. This brings {{changes of the}} rules concerning calculations of the forces which act on the superstructure of the bridge, and consequently the forces on the <b>fixed</b> <b>bearings,</b> due to traction and braking. In EN 1991 - 2, which determines the traffic loads on railway bridges according to the European constructions standards, there are different methods to take {{the interaction between the}} track and the superstructure of the bridge into account. For example interaction occurs because of accelerating and braking forces in the rails. This master thesis has been initiated in order to clarify the limits of the methods, how to use them and {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} each method. The methods consist of one general method and two simplified methods applicable under different conditions. In addition to the methods given in EN 1991 - 2 this report also includes well-known methods produced by Banverket (the Swedish railway administration), International Union of Railways (UIC) and Ladislav Frýba. Moreover a simplified, theoretical method is derived according to the current standard. The interaction between the track and the superstructure of the bridge due horizontal forces depends of a couple of parameters. Some examples are the configuration and properties of the track and the structure of the bridge. This means that the track over and next to the bridge and the superstructure, <b>fixed</b> <b>bearings,</b> substructure and the foundation of the bridge should be included in the analysis. It is important to consider the connection between the track and the superstructure of the bridge and its resistance to shear forces in longitudinal direction. The force-displacement behavior of the coupling has proved to be nonlinear, which is simplified as a bilinear behavior with elastic and plastic part. Because of this a nonlinear analysis is required when the forces in the couplings exceeds the yielding force. The analytical model in this report is however only valid for elastic behavior. In the analysis of the effects due to traction and braking the stiffness in longitudinal direction is the essential parameter concerning to the superstructure, <b>fixed</b> <b>bearings,</b> substructure and foundation of the bridge. This report consists of several case studies in order to determine the reduction factor ξ for the determination of the longitudinal forces in the superstructure of the bridge and the <b>fixed</b> <b>bearings</b> due to acceleration and braking forces. The case studies include five existing bridges and a sensitivity analysis. The bridges, whose lengths are in parentheses, are two portal frames (15 / 23 m), two girder bridges (52 / 150 m) and one truss bridge (82 m), where the girder bridges are continuous while portal frames and the truss bridge consist of only a single span. Furthermore the analysis of the portal frames take a spread foundation into account, but analysis of the other bridges take both spread and pile foundation into account. In the sensitivity analysis the theoretical model of calculation is used to clearly identify the main parameters with regard to the reduction factor ξ. The methodology which is expected to describe the real behavior in the most proper way is the general method according to EN 1991 - 2, where the FE-program FEMAP is used for the nonlinear analysis. Modeling in FEMAP includes the parts of the bridges and associated factors which are important for the results. Furthermore FEMAP is used to calculate necessary parameters for the other calculation methods. According to the analysis in FEMAP with spread and pile foundation the reduction factor ξ are 0. 51 (15 m) and 0. 52 (23 m) for the portal frames, 0. 65 / 0. 72 (52 m) and 0. 74 / 0. 73 (150 m) for the girder bridges and 0. 79 / 0. 77 (82) for the truss bridge, where the value in the parentheses. The results from FEMAP have a very good conformance compared with the results from the analytical methodology of calculation within its validity range. The biggest difference between the methods is 5 percentage points. The methods according to Banverket and UIC also appear to match the results from FEMAP moderately, but not to the same extent as the analytical method. The simplified approach according to Frýba differs markedly from the other methods. The simplified methods according to EN 1991 - 2 results in a reduction factor ξ close to 1. 0 for the portal frames, which means no reduction of the acceleration and braking forces. Thus the results differ markedly from the general method, where FEMAP is used. For the girder bridge with a length of 52 m the results appear to match in the case with pile foundation, but not to the same extent in the case with spread foundation. Because the calculations methods according to EN 1991 - 2 result in various degree of reduction due to acceleration and braking forces they are beneficial to use in different situations. The analytical method is recommended over the other simplified methods as a result of the accordance to the output from FEMAP. Moreover the analytical method includes all of the parameters, which have a significant impact on the reduction factor according to the sensitivity analysis. The actual parameters are the stiffness of the <b>fixed</b> <b>bearings,</b> the length of the bridge and to some extent the superstructure of the bridge and the shear resistance in longitudinal direction. The conclusion from the case studies is that a simplified method should be used to take the interaction between track and superstructure of the bridge due to acceleration and braking forces into account. The reason for this is to reduce the required to calculate the loads on the structure. It is possible to use the analytical model up to a theoretical length of 60 to 100 m depending on the bridge design, and over this length it is appropriate to use the general method with any FE-program. A possible way to simplify the calculations further is to create a model where the only length of the bridge gives the reduction factor ξ. To create such model the most common type of bridge may be studied for different lengths with respects to the longitudinal stiffness of the <b>fixed</b> <b>bearings,</b> which subsequently gives the reduction factor. The literature study in the report also indicate that the values which describe the resistance of the track in longitudinal direction according Eurocode can be strongly conservative in relation to measurements of the prevailing conditions in Sweden. In order to clarify if these indications are correct an investigation is proposed for the shear resistance of the track in longitudinal direction. Validerat; 20110119 (anonymous...|$|R

40|$|This is {{an account}} of the forms and {{semantic}} dimensions of spatial relations in Manange (Tibeto-Burman, Tamangic; Nepal), with comparison to sister language Nar-Phu. Topological relations (“IN/ON/AT/NEAR”) in these languages are encoded by locative enclitics and also by a set of noun-like objects termed as “locational roots. ” In Manange, the general locative enclitic is more frequently encountered {{for a wide range of}} topological relations, while in Nar-Phu, the opposite pattern is observed, i. e. more frequent use of locational roots. While the linguistic frame of reference system encoded in these forms is primarily relative (i. e. oriented on the speaker’s own viewing perspective), a more extrinsic/absolute system emerges with certain verbs of motion in these languages, with verbs like “come,” “go,” and certain verbs of placement or posture orienting to arbitrary <b>fixed</b> <b>bearings</b> such as slope. This account also provides some examples of cultural or metaphorical extensions of spatial forms as they are encountered in connected speech...|$|R
