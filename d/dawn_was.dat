5|$|Horizon Zero <b>Dawn</b> <b>was</b> {{the best-selling}} game during its release {{week in the}} UK. It surpassed No Man's Sky as the biggest launch of a new {{intellectual}} property on the PlayStation 4 and is the most successful launch of any kind on the PlayStation 4 since , as well as Guerrilla Games' biggest debut to date. The game sold close to 117,000 copies in its first week in Japan, becoming the second best-selling game that week. Horizon Zero <b>Dawn</b> <b>was</b> the second most downloaded game on the PlayStation 4 US store {{for the month of}} February. Because its launch day occurred {{on the last day of}} February, only one day of sales was counted. It was the best-selling game in its week of release in Australia. For the month of March, it was the second best-selling game in the United Kingdom and the highest selling PlayStation 4 game. Horizon Zero <b>Dawn</b> <b>was</b> also the best-selling game on PlayStation Store that month. As of 13 March 2017, the game had sold over 2.6 million copies worldwide. It was ranked number one in the UK sales chart of 22 April 2017, and took eighth place in the Japanese chart of 16 April. 3.4 million copies had been sold by the month of June 2017 – of which, 915,000 were digital.

5|$|Knightly <b>Dawn</b> <b>was</b> {{entered into}} the race on June 6 and was thought to bring early speed to the race and alter the way it would be run. Before Knightly Dawn's entry, Secretariat was speculated to lead from the race's start. With the {{presence}} of Knightly Dawn, William Bonifice believed that Secretariat would have to run faster earlier on, thus making the final half-mile more unpredictable. Pancho Martin, the trainer of Knightly Dawn, said he would only run the horse if it rained as Knightly Dawn's only previous success {{had been in the}} Jersey Derby on a sloppy track. However, Knightly <b>Dawn</b> <b>was</b> scratched prior to race day. The horse's scratch also reduced the winner's share from $150,200 to $90,120.|$|E

5|$|The concept art {{as well as}} the game's codename, Horizon, were leaked in September 2014. Horizon Zero <b>Dawn</b> <b>was</b> officially {{announced}} during Sony Interactive Entertainment's E3 2015 press conference. The {{game was}} featured as the cover story in the September 2015 issue of Edge and the October 2016 issue of Game Informer. At E3 2016, Sony had a life-sized cosplay version of one of the machines greet the trade show attendees. Originally set to be released in 2016, the game was later delayed to February 2017 so as to give additional time for the development team to polish the game. It was released to manufacturing in late January 2017. The game launched to North American markets on 28 February 2017, in Europe on 1 March and Asia on 2 March for the PlayStation 4. Horizon Zero Dawn is forward compatible with the PS4 Pro, allowing it to run up to 4K resolution. In April 2017, a 47-minute documentary about the making of Horizon Zero <b>Dawn</b> <b>was</b> released by Dutch public television. By March 2017, a story expansion had already been set in motion.

5|$|Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn is a live-action {{film and}} miniseries {{set in the}} Halo universe. Although shot as a feature-length film, Forward Unto <b>Dawn</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} released as a webseries consisting of five roughly 15-minute episodes, {{the first of which}} was released on October 5, 2012, with the last episode released on November 2, 2012. The series' plot, occurring {{in the early days of}} the Human-Covenant War circa 2526, revolves around Thomas Lasky, a young cadet at Corbulo Academy of Military Science, and how John-117 inspired him to eventually become a leader. Lasky is also a prominent character in Halo 4 as a commander on the UNSC Infinity. The name of the series, aside from being a reference to the UNSC frigate Forward Unto Dawn, is given new significance in the series as part a running motif based on a poem.

5|$|Wade {{has written}} for The New York Times since 1981 as an {{editorial}} writer, science editor and a reporter, including articles supporting the idea of recent human evolution and racial differentiation. His motivation for writing Before the Dawn began during his reporting of genetics, particularly since the sequencing {{of the human genome}} in 2003, as he started to realise how it could be related to the human past. He sought to put all of the recent research of archaeology, paleoanthropology and linguistics together into one narrative revolving around genetics. Before the <b>Dawn</b> <b>was</b> published in hardcover in 2006, and then in an updated paperback in 2007, by the Penguin Group.|$|E
5|$|During the 1920s and 1930s, Japan {{was one of}} the world's {{two largest}} {{producers}} of motion pictures, along with the United States. Though the country's film industry {{was among the first to}} produce both sound and talking features, the full changeover to sound proceeded much more slowly than in the West. It appears that the first Japanese sound film, Reimai (<b>Dawn),</b> <b>was</b> made in 1926 with the De Forest Phonofilm system. Using the sound-on-disc Minatoki system, the leading Nikkatsu studio produced a pair of talkies in 1929: Taii no musume (The Captain's Daughter) and Furusato (Hometown), the latter directed by Kenji Mizoguchi. The rival Shochiku studio began the successful production of sound-on-film talkies in 1931 using a variable-density process called Tsuchibashi. Two years later, however, more than 80 percent of movies made in the country were still silents. Two of the country's leading directors, Mikio Naruse and Yasujirō Ozu, did not make their first sound films until 1935 and 1936, respectively. As late as 1938, over a third of all movies produced in Japan were shot without dialogue.|$|E
