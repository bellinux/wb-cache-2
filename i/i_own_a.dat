500|$|Colbert {{describes}} himself as racially color-blind and unable to visually identify a person's race, explaining, [...] "Now, I don't see race ... People tell me I'm white, and I believe them, because <b>I</b> <b>own</b> <b>a</b> lot of Jimmy Buffett albums." [...] His race-blindness is a recurring joke, and this statement is often repeated on the show with different punch lines. For this same reason he believed that he was black when he had an emotional breakdown after watching Obama's inauguration video. He later qualified these statements in his book, stating, [...] "When I say I don't see race, I mean I don't see Black people. But I can spot a Mexican at a hundred paces." [...] Despite all these claims, Colbert often boasts {{that he has a}} large number of token minority friends (including Jon Stewart as [...] " [...] Jewish friend" [...] and Oprah Winfrey as [...] " [...] black friend"), although in the photos shown these friends appear decidedly uninterested in him. He has stated a similar inability to distinguish between the sexes, claiming to only [...] "see an American". This comes in contradiction of his at times sexist behavior, for instance, calling only on men during an open discussion with his audience on women's issues.|$|E
