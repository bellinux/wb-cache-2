Weak legal remedies for victims of securities fraud, especially poor law enforcement and <b>judicial</b> <b>governance,</b> have led to a waste of judicial resources. In particular, China’s courts have adopted a passive attitude to securities disputes (typically prior to 2003, when the courts were absent in dealing with private securities actions), although this situation is changing gradually. This article analyses procedural reforms such as shareholders’ derivative actions, class actions and shifting evidential proof for defendants. Judicial practices in securities fraud, including false statements, market manipulation and insider trading, are also addressed. This article then highlights the importance of establishing an active and independent system of legal enforcement for the protection of investors. In conclusion, it suggests introducing class actions, the inversion of the burden of proof and facilitating private remedies for individual shareholders by enhancing judicial review, judicial independence and <b>judicial</b> <b>governance...</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{estimates}} {{the effect of}} <b>judicial</b> institutions on <b>governance</b> and corruption in local governments. Our estimation strategy exploits a unique institutional feature of state judiciary branches in Brazil which assigns prosecutors and judges to the most populous among contiguous counties forming a judiciary district.

Conditional on observable county characteristics, offenses per civil servant are about 35 % lower in counties that have a local seat of the state judiciary. The lower incidence of infractions stems mostly from fewer violations of financial management regulations by local administrators, fewer instances of problems in project execution and project management, fewer cases of non-existent or ineffective civil society oversight and fewer cases of improper handling of remittances to local residents...|$|R

40|$|Esta tese teve como objetivo geral {{investigar}} relações entre construtos teóricos e variáveis observáveis relacionadas à governança judicial de Tribunais de Justiça brasileiros. A importância do tema decorre de lacunas teóricas e metodológicas, aliadas a dificuldades crônicas de acessibilidade da população de menor renda à Justiça, de morosidade e de baixa eficácia das deliberações judiciais enfrentadas pela administração da Justiça. Os objetivos específicos deste estudo foram desenvolvidos nos capítulos 2 a 5, estruturados na forma de quatro artigos individuais e interdependentes, precedidos da introdução geral apresentada no Capítulo 1 e sucedidos pelo Capítulo 6, no qual são tratadas as conclusões gerais e recomendações da pesquisa. O Capítulo 2 traz resultados de revisão de estudos teórico-empíricos relacionados ao conceito de governança judicial. O Capítulo 3 apresenta o desenvolvimento de um modelo teórico-metodológico de governança judicial. Premissas da Teoria da Agência e da Teoria de Custos de Transação, dirigidas originalmente para empresas, foram transpostas para elaboração do modelo. Os procedimentos de coleta de dados incluíram análise documental e realização de 10 entrevistas. O modelo proposto inclui a sistematização de sete construtos teóricos - Accountability; Acessibilidade; Independência; Recursos e Estrutura; Práticas de Governança; Ambiente Institucional; Desempenho – e variáveis componentes desses construtos. O Capítulo 4 descreve o processo de desenvolvimento e validação de Escala de Governança Judicial. A amostra foi composta de 490 respondentes, sendo 46 magistrados, 390 servidores e 54 que não informaram o cargo. A partir de análise fatorial exploratória e de análise fatorial confirmatória, verificou-se que o modelo de mensuração final apresentou todas as cargas fatoriais e correlações significativas. O modelo final da Escala, com 27 itens, apresentou evidências de validade convergente e discriminante dos seis construtos medidos pelo instrumento e índices de ajustes em valores considerados razoáveis. O Capítulo 5 apresenta a avaliação de evidências empíricas da relação entre construtos teóricos e variáveis observáveis do modelo teórico-metodológico de governança judicial, realizados com o auxílio da técnica estatística de Modelagem por Equações Estruturais. Os modelos estruturais testados apresentaram índices de ajustes em valores considerados razoáveis. A hipótese relativa à regressão entre o construto Ambiente Institucional sobre o construto Desempenho foi rejeitada. As demais hipóteses testadas indicaram a validade das premissas do modelo teóricometodológico avaliado. Destacam-se como principais contribuições desta tese as duas proposições validadas para a amostra estudada: o modelo teóricometodológico de governança judicial apresentado no Capítulo 3 e validado no Capítulo 5 e a Escala de Governança Judicial apresentada no Capítulo 4. _________________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTThe {{main purpose}} of this thesis {{was to investigate the}} relationships between theoretical constructs and observable variables related to <b>judicial</b> <b>governance</b> of Brazilian Courts of Justice. The importance of this theme stems from theoretical and methodological gaps and from chronicle difficulties related to accessibility of low income population to justice, to slowness and to low effectiveness of judicial decisions faced by justice management. The specific objectives of this study were developed in chapters 2 - 5, which were structured in the form of four individual and interdependent articles. They were preceded by the general introduction presented in Chapter 1 and succeeded by Chapter 6, which addresses the general conclusions and recommendations of the research. Chapter 2 reveals the results of the review of theoretical-empirical studies related to the concept of <b>judicial</b> <b>governance.</b> Chapter 3 presents the development of a theoretical-methodological model of <b>judicial</b> <b>governance.</b> Assumptions of Agency Theory and the Transaction Cost Theory, originally directed to private companies, were incorporated to the model. Procedures for data collection included document analysis and 10 interviews. The proposed model includes the systematization of seven theoretical constructs Accountability, Accessibility, Independence, Resources and Structure; Governance Practices, Institutional Environment; Performance - and variable components of these constructs. Chapter 4 shows the process of development and validation of the <b>Judicial</b> <b>Governance</b> Measurement Scale. The sample consisted of 490 respondents, including 46 judges, 390 civil servants and other 54 who did not inform their job title. After conducting exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis, {{it was found that the}} final measurement model presented significant factor loadings and correlations for all variables. The final version of the scale, composed by 27 items, presented evidence of convergent and discriminant validity of the six constructs measured by the scale and the overall fit index in values considered acceptable. Chapter 5 brings the evaluation of empirical evidences of the relationship between theoretical constructs and observable variables of the theoretical-methodological model of <b>judicial</b> <b>governance,</b> carried out with the aid of the statistical technique of Structural Equation Modeling. Structural models tested showed levels of general fit index in values considered acceptable. The hypothesis of regression of the Institutional Environment construct on Performance construct was rejected. The remaining hypotheses tests indicated the validity of the assumptions of the theoretical-methodological model. The main contributions of this thesis to be highlighted are the two propositions validated in the studied sample: the theoreticalmethodological <b>judicial</b> <b>governance</b> model presented in Chapter 3 and validated in Chapter 5 and the <b>Judicial</b> <b>Governance</b> Measurement Scale presented in Chapter 4...|$|E

40|$|Since the mid- 1980 s, U. S. {{and foreign}} parties have filed more than 100, 000 {{lawsuits}} in U. S. federal courts asking for adjudication of disputes arising from transnational activity. These lawsuits raise a fundamental question of global governance: Who governs? Should the United States assert its authority to adjudicate a transnational dispute, or should it {{defer to the}} adjudicative authority of a foreign state that also has connections with the underlying activity? Should the United States assert its authority to prescribe the rules governing that activity, or should it defer to foreign prescriptive authority? U. S. district courts routinely face these questions in transnational litigation, and by answering them they help allocate governance authority among states. To {{shed light on the}} role of domestic courts in global governance, this dissertation asks: How often and under what circumstances do U. S. district courts defer to foreign authority to govern transnational activity rather than asserting domestic authority? Drawing on private international law scholarship and theories of international relations, judicial behavior, and bounded rationality, I develop a series of hypotheses about the legal and political factors that influence <b>judicial</b> allocation of <b>governance</b> authority. I then statistically test these hypotheses using original data on U. S. district court decisionmaking in two transnational litigation settings: the allocation of adjudicative authority under the forum non conveniens doctrine, and the allocation of prescriptive authority under various choice-of-law methods. Contrary to the conventional wisdom that U. S. judges are reluctant to defer to foreign authority, I find that they defer at a rate of approximately 50 % in both settings. And notwithstanding claims that legal doctrine does not significantly affect judicial decisionmaking, I present evidence suggesting that the forum non conveniens doctrine and choice-of-law doctrine both influence <b>judicial</b> allocation of <b>governance</b> authority. There is evidence of both direct doctrinal effects, as contemplated by legalist theory, and indirect doctrinal effects, resulting from the use of judicial heuristics which allow judges to conserve scarce decisionmaking resources while making decisions that achieve acceptable levels of legal quality. Significant political factors include whether the foreign state is a liberal democracy, the domestic political environment, and U. S. parties' preferences. Dissertatio...|$|R

40|$|Law and {{governance}} {{need to be}} justified vis-à-vis citizens {{in order to be}} accepted as legitimate and supported by civil society. This contribution argues that the legal and judicial methodologies of multilevel governance for international public goods need to be changed in order to protect basic needs and human rights of citizens more effectively. I define legal methodology in terms of the conceptions of the sources and ‘rules of recognition’ of law, the methods of interpretation, the functions and systemic nature of multilevel legal systems like IEL, and of the relationships between rules, principles, political and legal institutions and related practices. Section I recalls the historical evolution from ‘good governance’ to third-party adjudication and individual rights of access to justice. Section II discusses eight models of multilevel <b>judicial</b> <b>governance</b> in Europe. Section III uses constitutional and ‘public goods’ theories in order to explain the multiple functions of courts of justice and the increasing importance of judicial cooperation (comity) in protecting transnational rule of law in European and international economic law (IEL). Section IV argues that the diverse ‘constitutional methods’ applied by the EU Court of Justice (CJEU), the European Free Trade Area (EFTA) Court and the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) offer important lessons for multilevel <b>judicial</b> <b>governance</b> in IEL beyond Europe. Section V concludes by emphasizing the judicial task of administering justice in IEL and the need for limiting the existing ‘legal’ and ‘doctrinal fragmentation’ through multilevel judicial protection of transnational rule of law for the benefit not only of governments, but also of citizens as legal subjects and ‘democratic owners’ of IEL...|$|E

The Small Revolution proved that the Austrian army was insufficient on its own to keep order without some popular support.

When Charlemagne came to power, he had two goals; territorial expansion and the conversion of all Franks to Christianity, including those recently added to the kingdom. Charlemagne's desire to extend his empire was inseparable from his desire to extend Christianity, so the conquering of other kingdoms was a method often used. This Frank expansion into other realms and their contrast with those people and their religions, for example the arrival of Islam in Spain, has to be considered when considering legal and religious reforms such as [...] and the fever in which they were carried out. Charlemagne was the champion of orthodoxy, and to address his perceived failings of the church and the moral and spiritual health of the Franks, he set out to reform the church and his subjects with the capitulary [...]|$|R
