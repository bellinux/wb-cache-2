Nonviral Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon vectors have a significantly safer insertion profile, but efficient delivery into relevant cell/tissue types is a limitation. In an attempt to combine the favorable features of the two vector systems we established a novel <b>hybrid</b> <b>vector</b> technology based on SB transposase-mediated insertion of lentiviral DNA circles generated during transduction of target cells with integrase (IN) -defective LVs (IDLVs).

Previously we explored the hyperactive Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposase (HSB 5) for somatic integration from the high-capacity adenoviral vectors genome. To further improve this <b>hybrid</b> <b>vector</b> system we hypothesized that the previously described hyperactive SB transposase SB 100 X will result in significantly improved efficacies after transduction of target cells. Plasmid based delivery of the SB 100 X system revealed significantly increased integration efficiencies compared with the previously published hyperactive SB transposase HSB 5. After optimizing experimental setups for high-capacity adenoviral vectors-based delivery of the SB 100 X system we observed up to eightfold and 100 -fold increased integration efficiencies compared with the previously published hyperactive SB transposase HSB 5 and the inactive transposase mSB, respectively. Furthermore, transposon copy numbers per cell were doubled with SB 100 X compared with HSB 5 when using the identical multiplicity of infection. We believe that this improved <b>hybrid</b> <b>vector</b> system represents a valuable tool for achieving stabilized transgene expression in cycling cells and for treatment of numerous genetic disorders.

To prolong {{transgene}} expression, we have developed new <b>hybrid</b> <b>vectors</b> which associate key elements from adeno-associated virus (AAV) with the elevated transducing capacity of baculovirus. The <b>hybrid</b> <b>vectors</b> contain a transgene cassette composed of the β-galactosidase (β-Gal) reporter gene and the hygromycin resistance (Hygr) gene flanked by the AAV inverted terminal repeats (ITRs), which are necessary for AAV replication and integration in the host genome.

A high-titer preparation of baculovirus-AAV (Bac-AAV) chimeric virus containing the ITR–Hygr–β-Gal sequence was obtained with insect cells only when the rep gene was placed in an antisense orientation to the polyheidrin promoter. Infection of 293 cells with Bac-AAV virus expressing the rep gene results in a 10 - to 50 -fold {{increase in the number of}} Hygr stable cell clones.

40|$|Abstract: Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV- 1) amplicons can {{accommodate}} foreign DNA {{of any size}} up to 150 kbp and, therefore, allow extensive combinations of genetic elements. Genomic sequences as well as cDNA, large transcriptional regulatory sequences for cell type-specific expression, multiple transgenes, and genetic elements from other viruses to create <b>hybrid</b> <b>vectors</b> may be inserted in a modular fashion. Hybrid amplicons use genetic elements from HSV- 1 that allow replication and packaging of the vector DNA into HSV- 1 virions, and genetic elements from other viruses that either direct integration of transgene sequences into the host genome or allow episomal maintenance of the vector. Thus, {{the advantages of the}} HSV- 1 amplicon system, including large transgene capacity, broad host range, strong nuclear localization, and availability of helper virus-free packaging systems are retained and combined with those of heterologous viral elements that confer genetic stability to the vector DNA. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) has the unique capability of integrating its genome into a specific site, designated AAVS 1, on human chromosome 19. The AAV rep gene and the inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) that flank the AAV genome are sufficient for this process.

Here, a dual high-capacity adenovirus-adeno-associated virus (hcAd/AAV) vector with two full-length human dystrophin-coding sequences flanked by AAV integration-enhancing elements is presented. These vectors are generated from input linear monomeric DNA molecules consisting of the Ad origin of replication and packaging signal followed by the recently identified AAV DNA integration efficiency element (p 5 IEE), the transgene(s) of interest, and the AAV inverted terminal repeat (ITR).
