40|$|Plastic <b>worm</b> <b>wheel</b> {{is widely}} used in the vehicle {{manufacturing}} field because it is favorable for weight lightening, vibration and noise reduction, as well as corrosion resistance. However, {{it is very difficult}} for general plastics to secure the mechanical properties that are required for vehicle gears. If the plastic resin is reinforced by glass fiber in the fabrication process of plastic <b>worm</b> <b>wheel,</b> it is possible to achieve the mechanical properties of metallic material levels. In this study, the mechanical characteristic analysis of the glass-reinforced plastic <b>worm</b> <b>wheel,</b> according to the contents of glass fiber, is performed by analytic and experimental methods. In the case of the glass fiber-reinforced resin, the orientation and contents of glass fibers can influence the mechanical properties.

40|$|Effect of {{tilting angle}} on the {{dynamics}} of tilting table driven by <b>worm</b> and <b>worm</b> <b>wheel</b> Wenming Wei, Jun Zhang, Dun Lu and Wanhua Zhao The dynamics of tilting table behaves differently during five-axis machining due to the constant changes {{of the position of}} its center of mass which leads to different forces acting on parts of the transmission system. In this research, the lumped parameter method is used to model {{the dynamics of}} tilting table driven by <b>worm</b> and <b>worm</b> <b>wheel</b> in the tilting direction, where the varying stiffness of the transmission system at different tilting angles is considered. The impact testing experiments of tilting table system with tilting angles from 0 to 90 are also performed to verify the analytical model. The results from sensitivity analysis show that the three stiffnesses have a great effect on the variation of system natural frequency in the tilting direction, including the equivalent tangential meshing stiffness of <b>worm</b> and <b>worm</b> <b>wheel,</b> the torsional stiffness of <b>worm</b> <b>wheel</b> shaft, and the axial stiffness of worm supporting bearings.

40|$|Nowadays {{worm gear}} drives usually show run-in capable {{material}} pairing. In {{most cases the}} worm is made of case hardened steel and the <b>worm</b> <b>wheel</b> of copper-tin alloy. This choice of material leads to an effective avoidance of the appearance of scuffing. The wear of the <b>worm</b> <b>wheel,</b> which is desirable in the running-in phase, limits, along with the known load carrying capacities of other gear types, the life expectancy of the gear set. The {{aim of this study}} is to optimize the copper-tin alloys of the <b>worm</b> <b>wheel</b> with respect to the wear properties. Extensive tests on worm gear drives with different copper-tin alloys allow statements concerning the effects of varying the different material parameters to the wear behaviour. The result is a wear optimized <b>worm</b> <b>wheel</b> material and an extended load carrying capacity calculation. Furthered load carrying capacity calculation makes a contribution which forms the existing calculation procedure more accurately. The derivation of a statistical evaluation procedure for the test results leads to a wear life expectancy with a specification of an appearance probability. The physical based wear parameter allows the prediction of the wear behaviour of copper-tin alloys using the material properties. Detailed measurements of the power losses in the worm gear drives make possible the calculation of the tooth coefficient of friction of the various material pairing. The introduced order- and purchase regulations guarantee, that in the future, the optimized bronze can be reproduced and supplied. (orig.)
