During the <b>double-blind</b> <b>phase,</b> once daily 5 g, 10 g, and 15 g ZS-9 maintained serum potassium at normal levels in a significantly higher proportion of patients (80%, 90%, and 94%, respectively) than placebo (46%).

50|$|Evidence showing Neurturin’s role in neuron {{survival}} and management {{has made it}} a popular candidate for the potential treatment or reversal of neurodegeneration. In addition, mice models have shown the dying neurons exposed to trophic factors can be rescued. Neurturin {{is an example of}} a trophic factor that is difficult to utilize clinically because of its inability to cross the blood-brain barrier of the CNS (central nervous system). Ceregene sponsored a <b>double-blind</b> <b>phase</b> II clinical trial of CERE-120, a viral vector mediated gene transfer drug that allows for the continuous delivery of neurturin to the nigrostratial system. The hope was to reverse damaged and diseased tissue in Parkinsons patients and overall slow the progression of the disease. However, results were inconclusive and showed that while the drug appears to be relatively safe, there was no statistically significant data supporting the improvement of motor function or neuronal health. Neurturin’s therapeutic potential is unknown and future studies aim to improve delivery of the drug.|$|E
5000|$|Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), {{also known}} as primary biliary cirrhosis, is an auto-immune, {{inflammatory}} liver disease which produces bile duct injury, fibrosis, cholestasis and eventual cirrhosis. It is much more common in women than men and can cause jaundice, itching (pruritus) and fatigue. Ursodeoxycholic acid therapy is beneficial, but the disease often progresses and may require liver transplantation. Animal studies suggested that treatment with FXR agonists should be beneficial in cholestatic diseases such as PBC. OCA at doses between 10 mg and 50 mg was shown to provide significant biochemical benefit, but pruritus was more frequent with higher doses.
