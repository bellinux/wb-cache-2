5|$|All tracks {{except the}} <b>few</b> <b>yards</b> {{embedded}} in the quayside at Watchet were removed by 1920, but other features were removed or altered piecemeal over time. By 1940, for example, no trace remained of Washford station, but both sets of level crossing gates remained in place.|$|E
5|$|On May 1994, {{the student}} {{government}} dedicated a permanent {{memorial to the}} wall in Pfiefer Lounge (later a Starbucks and now the new Student Center) a <b>few</b> <b>yards</b> from the wall's edge. The student memorial to the protests included the wall painting of President Day's head in a guillotine.|$|E
5|$|The reserve has free admission. It is {{maintained}} by London Wildlife Trust staff {{with the help}} of volunteers. There is a varied programme of activities including wildlife walks, fungus forays, open days and talks. The reserve is used regularly by school and community groups, and for team-building work days by corporate groups. Its entrance, with a wooden five-bar gate flanked by hedges, is on the south of Bollo Lane, a <b>few</b> <b>yards</b> from Chiswick Park tube station.|$|E
5000|$|Charlotte’s defense set {{records for}} <b>fewest</b> <b>yards</b> allowed (112), <b>fewest</b> passing <b>yards</b> allowed (9) and most tackles for loss (19).|$|R
50|$|Arizona State College {{accumulated}} only 1,943 total offensive yards, {{which is}} the <b>fewest</b> <b>yards</b> collected in a single season.|$|R
50|$|The Chiefs defense {{he played}} with in 1989 led the AFC in <b>fewest</b> total <b>yards</b> allowed and <b>fewest</b> passing <b>yards</b> allowed.|$|R
5|$|United {{were denied}} victory by Bayern Munich twice, home and away. In Munich, the home side {{equalised}} with {{two minutes to}} go with United leading 2–1, after Schmeichel uncharacteristically went for and missed Bixente Lizarazu's throw-in, allowing Giovane Élber to tap in from a <b>few</b> <b>yards</b> out and score his second of the match. The return leg ended in a stalemate; Roy Keane scored just before half-time via a low header before Hasan Salihamidžić equalised for the visitors.|$|E
5|$|A British Transport Police {{police station}} was based at Waterloo by the Victory Arch, with a custody suite of three cells. Although {{relatively}} cramped, {{until the late}} 1990s it served over 40 police officers. Following {{the closure of the}} Eurostar Terminal at Waterloo, the police station shut in February 2009, and the railway station is now policed from a new Inner London Police Station a <b>few</b> <b>yards</b> from Waterloo at Holmes Terrace. Until July 2010, the Neighbourhood Policing Team for Waterloo consisted of an inspector, a sergeant, two constables, special constables, and 13 police community support officers.|$|E
5|$|At about noon, {{several hundred}} special constables were led onto the field. They formed two {{lines in the}} crowd a <b>few</b> <b>yards</b> apart, {{in an attempt to}} form a {{corridor}} through the crowd between the house where the magistrates were watching and the hustings, two waggons lashed together. Believing that this might be intended as the route by which the magistrates would later send their representatives to arrest the speakers, some members of the crowd pushed the waggons away from the constables, and pressed around the hustings to form a human barrier.|$|E
50|$|The Seahawks again {{allowed the}} fewest {{points in the}} NFL, the first NFL defense to {{accomplish}} this three seasons in a row since the 1969-1971 Minnesota Vikings. They also allowed the <b>fewest</b> <b>yards,</b> becoming the first defense since the 1985-1986 Chicago Bears to allow the <b>fewest</b> points and <b>yards</b> two seasons in a row. They allowed the <b>fewest</b> passing <b>yards</b> and passing touchdowns, though they ranked 20th in interceptions.|$|R
50|$|The 1959 New York Giants {{season was}} the 35th {{season for the}} club in the National Football League. The Giants' defense became the second defense {{in the history of}} the NFL to lead the league in <b>fewest</b> rushing <b>yards,</b> <b>fewest</b> passing <b>yards</b> and <b>fewest</b> total <b>yards.</b> The 1959 Giants scored 284 points. More than in any of the {{previous}} four seasons in which Vince Lombardi was their offensive co-ordinator.|$|R
50|$|Redding {{had another}} solid season in 2011, {{recording}} 4 sacks {{and helping the}} Ravens defense allow the 2nd <b>fewest</b> <b>yards</b> in the league.|$|R
5|$|Crossing {{the river}} by ferry or the long Shaldon Bridge brings walkers to Teignmouth, beyond which the coast path follows the South Devon Railway sea wall to Hole Head where the Parson and Clerk rocks look out to sea. Passing beneath the railway, the path climbs {{up to the}} main road, which it follows for a <b>few</b> <b>yards</b> before turning back towards the cliff top (in stormy weather the sea wall is too {{dangerous}} and this road must be followed {{most of the way}} from Teignmouth). Entering Dawlish along a now by-passed toll road, the coast path descends back {{to the level of the}} railway which it follows to Dawlish Warren, although a slightly more landward route is necessary at high tides.|$|E
5|$|Georgia Tech's offense {{began the}} final drive {{of the first}} half with 2:55 remaining. The Yellow Jackets started from their 36-yard line and began slowly: Their first play gained no yards, and their second gained eight before a fumble that was {{recovered}} by a fellow Yellow Jacket. A short running play gained three yards, enough for a first down, and the drive continued. Consecutive rushing plays gained <b>few</b> <b>yards</b> at a time, and Georgia Tech used its timeouts to stop the game clock and prevent time from running out in the half. A 10-yard pass interference penalty pushed Georgia Tech inside the Clemson 20-yard line, and kicker Blair again converted a field goal. The successful kick gave Georgia Tech a 16–13 lead heading into halftime.|$|E
5|$|Muntz Street was readily {{accessible}} by public transport. In the early years, horse-drawn buses {{ran along the}} Coventry Road, linking Small Heath with the city centre and with other nearby districts. In 1882, {{the building of a}} tramline along the Coventry Road to Small Heath Park was authorised, and four years later, the Coventry Road steam tramway route was opened to a terminus near Dora Road, a <b>few</b> <b>yards</b> past the ground. In {{the early years of the}} 20th century, this line was converted for use by electric trams.|$|E
50|$|The Bears defense set several NFL {{records in}} 1985, {{and led the}} league in {{turnovers}} forced and surrendered the <b>fewest</b> <b>yards,</b> points, and first downs.|$|R
50|$|Hardison {{helped the}} Bills win the 1980 AFC East Division {{and helped the}} Bills defense lead the NFL in <b>fewest</b> passing <b>yards</b> allowed in 1978 and the AFC in 1979 and 1980 and NFL in <b>fewest</b> total <b>yards</b> allowed in 1980 and the Chiefs lead the NFL in <b>fewest</b> passing <b>yards</b> allowed in 1988.|$|R
50|$|The 1954 Cleveland Browns {{season was}} the teams fifth {{season with the}} National Football League. The Browns defense became the first defense {{in the history of}} the NFL to lead the league in <b>fewest</b> rushing <b>yards</b> allowed, <b>fewest</b> passing <b>yards</b> allowed and <b>fewest</b> total <b>yards</b> allowed. Assistant coach Weeb Ewbank left the club to coach the Baltimore Colts.|$|R
5|$|Playing college {{football}} for Louisiana State University (LSU), Taylor led the Southeastern Conference (SEC) in scoring in 1956 and 1957 and earned first-team All-America honors as a senior. He {{was selected by}} the Packers {{in the second round}} of the 1958 NFL Draft and was used sparingly as a rookie, but with the arrival of coach Vince Lombardi in 1959 Taylor soon became the team's all-purpose back, especially when only a <b>few</b> <b>yards</b> were needed. In this role, his spirited performance against the Giants in the 1962 NFL Championship Game came to define his mental and physical toughness.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{opens with}} Lewis (Clark Johnson) and Crosetti (Jon Polito) {{looking for a}} {{projectile}} a <b>few</b> <b>yards</b> {{away from the body}} of a man shot to death. The man's girlfriend (Oni Faida Lampley), who {{was shot in the head}} during the incident but survived, tells police during questioning that her aunt Calpurnia Church hired a hitman to kill her for insurance money. The detectives learn Church previously collected life insurance from five deceased husbands. Suspecting Church of murdering her husbands, Lewis and Crosetti have the body of her most recent husband exhumed for an autopsy, but reach a dead-end when it turns out to be the wrong body in his grave.|$|E
5|$|After Bab el Wad, {{the road}} wound to Jerusalem through deep, narrow valleys, over steep spurs, {{and around the}} {{shoulders}} of rocky hills. There were other ways through the hills, but they were a tangle of unmapped, rough and rocky hill tracks and pathways—often little more than donkey tracks—which made movement by infantry, dismounted cavalry, and artillery very difficult. The rough tracks meandered through narrow valleys and over distorted piles of razor-backed ridges, which were broken by groups of cone-shaped hills and successive shelves of rock jutting out from every hillside at intervals of a <b>few</b> <b>yards.</b> It was virtually impossible for advances to the north or south of the main road to be supported by artillery. In heavy rain and cold, wet and muddy conditions, it {{was found to be}} impossible to deploy the 75th Division's guns off the road. These guns had been brought forward by teams of up to eight horses to a gun the day before.|$|E
50|$|The 49ers defense he {{was part}} of in 1987 allowed the <b>fewest</b> total <b>yards</b> (4,095/273 per game) and <b>fewest</b> passing <b>yards</b> (2,484/165.6 per game) of any NFL team.|$|R
50|$|The Sun Devils set a school-record by {{recording}} the <b>fewest</b> <b>yards</b> per punt with a 32.2 Yard Avg. They compiled 47 Total Punts for only 1,511 Total Yards.|$|R
50|$|In 1970, the Vikings defense {{recorded}} 49 {{sacks and}} once again gave up the fewest points and <b>fewest</b> <b>yards.</b> Meanwhile, Page, Eller and Larsen all made the Pro Bowl.|$|R
5|$|Both teams' {{defenses}} {{controlled the}} third quarter, allowing no points to be scored. Navy's McKee completed three more pass plays before his first incompletion, which came on his fourteenth attempt. Washington's offense had little {{success in the}} third quarter, being held to only a <b>few</b> <b>yards</b> gained and turning the ball over once. In the fourth quarter, after several unsuccessful drives by each team, Navy made a major error. After being stopped on their own 26-yard line, Navy improperly lined up in a punt formation, and the center snapped the ball over the punter's head. The ball was recovered by Washington on the Navy ten-yard line. Washington lost two yards in three plays, and faced a fourth down from the Navy 12-yard line. Washington stacked their offensive line, allowing their left guard, James Bryan, to become an eligible receiver. Fred Abel passed the ball to Bryan, who caught it {{just short of the}} goal line and walked into the end zone for the touchdown. Washington's kicker then converted the extra point, tying the game at 14.|$|E
5|$|During the Williamite Wars of 1690–1691, the {{garrison}} espoused {{the cause of}} James II in contrast with that of Birr, which took the side of William. A stone bridge across the Shannon was erected in 1685, and a Williamite army advancing from Birr in 1690 attempted to break it down but abandoned the attempt as too risky in consequence {{of the presence of}} Sarsfield's Army on the Connacht side. A broken arch of this bridge is still to be seen on that side a <b>few</b> <b>yards</b> below the present bridge of seven arches, which was erected by the Commissioners for the Improvement of Navigation of the Shannon in 1841–1843. The square tower on the lower side of the bridge at the Galway end was erected to protect the old bridge, as was the Salt Battery, with emplacements for four cannons facing west and north, a few hundred yards from town along the Crank Road.|$|E
5|$|Monitor, to the {{surprise}} of Virginias crew, had emerged from behind Minnesota and went straight for the approaching Virginia and positioned herself between her and the grounded Minnesota, preventing the Confederate ironclad from further engaging the vulnerable wooden ship at close range. At 8:45am Worden gave the order to fire where Greene fired the first shots of the battle between the two ironclads which harmlessly deflected off the Confederate ironclad. During the battle Monitor fired solid shot, about once every eight minutes, while Virginia fired shell exclusively. The ironclads generally fought at close range for about four hours, ending at 12:15pm, ranging from a <b>few</b> <b>yards</b> to more than a hundred. Both ships were constantly in motion, maintaining a circular pattern. Because of Virginias weak engines, massive size and weight and with a draft of , she was slow and difficult to maneuver, taking her half an hour to complete a 180-degree turn.|$|E
50|$|The Valiant Soldier {{public house}} is a <b>few</b> hundred <b>yards</b> upriver from the store and can provide accommodation. St Luke's church is a <b>few</b> hundred <b>yards</b> down river, towards Washford.|$|R
50|$|He {{played on}} {{defenses}} {{that led the}} NFC in fewest points allowed in 1976 and the NFL in <b>fewest</b> total <b>yards</b> allowed in 1975 and <b>fewest</b> passing <b>yards</b> allowed in 1976.|$|R
5000|$|It was {{the second}} defense to rank No. 1 in <b>fewest</b> <b>yards</b> yielded without sending a player to the Pro Bowl. The 1983 Cincinnati Bengals, who had a losing record were the first.|$|R
5|$|On 9June 2004, the {{day after}} the first of a 21st-century pair of Venus transits {{occurred}} as predicted by Horrocks, a commemorative street nameplate in memory of William Crabtree was unveiled at the junction of Lower Broughton Road and Priory Grove, which marks the northern boundary of Crabtree Croft. In December 2005, a commemorative plaque was unveiled a <b>few</b> <b>yards</b> away near Ivy Cottage on Lower Broughton Road, which is thought to have been the home of Crabtree and his family {{at the time he was}} collaborating with Horrocks. The second transit of the pair occurred on 5 and 6June 2012, and was marked by a celebration held in the church at Much Hoole, which was streamed live worldwide on the NASA website. A celebration was also held at Crabtree's former home in Broughton when NASA broadcast a re-creation of the observation at Ivy Cottage, inspired by the Ford Madox Brown mural, to millions of viewers, and projected a live video stream of the transit from Hawaii onto the side of the house.|$|E
5|$|Quarterback Doc Kuhn {{started the}} second half after sitting out the first because of injuries, invigorating the Commodores. The second scoring drive started when Paul Stumb intercepted a pass. Neely ran for 21 yards around the right end before Kuhn {{connected}} with Tot McCullough for a 25-yard pass. Rupe Smith (or Kuhn) then ran the remaining <b>few</b> <b>yards</b> for the touchdown. Alabama {{had a chance to}} score, making it to Vanderbilt's 18-yard line. The Commodore defense prevailed, Alabama's forward passes failed, and the ball went over on downs. Other chances included Alabama halfback Rosenfeld intercepting a pass with a clear field ahead of him, returning it 32 yards before Vanderbilt's Red Rountree tackled him from behind. Alabama back Charles Bartlett also returned a punt 25 yards before he was tackled by the last Commodore who could have done so. The Crimson Tide was captained by sophomore end Al Clemens, later captain of the first Alabama team coached by Wallace Wade.|$|E
5|$|The grenade did possess several {{problems}} with its design. Users were urged to actually {{run up to}} the tank and place it by hand, rather than throw it, thus the adhesive could very easily stick to their uniform in the process; the user would then {{be placed in the}} unenviable situation of attempting to pry the grenade loose whilst still holding onto the lever. It was also discovered that as time passed the nitroglycerin began to deteriorate and become unstable, which made it even more difficult to use. As the grenade was a short-range weapon, users were trained to hide in a trench or other place of concealment until the tank went past them, and then to stick the grenade {{to the rear of the}} tank, where its armour was thinnest. Users were relatively safe from a <b>few</b> <b>yards</b> away, as long as they were not in line with the handle when it detonated. The Mark II design used a plastic casing instead of glass, and a detonator instead of a cap.|$|E
50|$|The Reds {{had one of}} {{the most}} anemic offenses {{in the history of the}} National Football league, setting records in {{futility}} for <b>fewest</b> <b>yards,</b> passing attempts, pass completions and passing touchdowns in a season.|$|R
50|$|This was the Bears' last {{playoff berth}} {{prior to the}} AFL-NFL merger, and their last NFL {{championship}} until 1985 and Super Bowl XX. The Bears' defense in 1963 was the third in history to lead the NFL in <b>fewest</b> rushing <b>yards,</b> <b>fewest</b> passing <b>yards,</b> and <b>fewest</b> total yards; the defense also allowed only 144 points, formerly an NFL record.|$|R
25|$|New England's {{defense was}} {{retooled}} before the 2003 season {{when the team}} signed veteran safety Rodney Harrison {{as a free agent}} and traded for defensive lineman Ted Washington. With these additions, the Patriots led the league in <b>fewest</b> passing <b>yards</b> allowed per attempt (5.64), fewest passing touchdowns allowed (11), and most interceptions (29). They also ranked 4th in <b>fewest</b> rushing <b>yards</b> allowed (1,434) and 7th in <b>fewest</b> total <b>yards</b> (4,919).|$|R
