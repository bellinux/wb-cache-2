40|$|We review {{data from}} three neuroimaging studies of syllogistic {{reasoning}} {{that point to}} dual neural pathways for human reasoning. A frontal-temporal system processes familiar, conceptually coherent material while a parietal system processes unfamiliar, nonconceptual or <b>incoherent</b> <b>material.</b> We suggest that {{this is consistent with}} a dual mechanism account of reasoning consisting of heuristic and universal or formal processes. The frontal-temporal pathway corresponds to the “heuristic ” system while the parietal pathway corresponds to the “universal ” system. Reasoning about familiar situations automatically utilizes situation-specific heuristics, which are based on background knowledge and experience. Where no such heuristics are available (as in reasoning about unfamiliar situations), universal/formal methods must be used to solve the problem. In the case of syllogistic reasoning this involves a visuo-spatial system. Goel 3 of 16 Logical Reasoning is the cognitive activity of evaluating arguments.

40|$|International audienceIn a {{previous}} set of experiments {{we showed that}} audio-visual fusion during the McGurk effect may be modulated by context. A short context (2 to 4 syllables) composed of incoherent auditory and visual material significantly decreases the McGurk effect. We interpreted this as showing {{the existence of an}} audiovisual "binding" stage controlling the fusion process, and we also showed the existence of a "rebinding" process when an <b>incoherent</b> <b>material</b> is followed by a short coherent material. In this work we evaluate the role of acoustic noise superimposed to the context and to the rebinding material. We use either a coherent or incoherent context, followed, if incoherent, by a variable amount of coherent "rebinding" material, with two conditions, either silent or with superimposed speech-shaped noise. The McGurk target is presented with no acoustic noise. We confirm the existence of unbinding (lower McGurk effect with incoherent context) and rebinding (the McGurk effect is recovered with coherent rebinding). Noise uniformly increases the rate of McGurk responses compared to the silent condition. We conclude on the role of audiovisual coherence and noise in the binding process, in the framework of audiovisual speech scene analysis and the cocktail party effect...|$|E

It will be enough that by its mass we are assured of its sufficiency and strength; and there is the less reason for endeavoring to diminish the extent of its surface by delicacy of adjustment, because on the breadth of that surface we are to depend for the better display of the color, which is to be the chief source of our pleasure in the building. The main body of the work, therefore, will be composed of solid walls and massive piers; and whatever expression of finer structural science we may require, will be thrown either into subordinate portions of it, or entirely directed to the support of the external mail, where in arches or vaults it might otherwise appear dangerously independent of the material within.|$|R
40|$|Ultrasonic {{inspection}} of ordinary samples with {{more or less}} rough surfaces is an everyday problem in industrial NDE. Contact techniques require flat or other regular (e. g., cylindrical) surfaces of negligible roughness {{with respect to the}} acoustic wavelength. Immersion techniques are less susceptible to surface topography, but they still require that the surface radius be larger than the beam diameter and the surface roughness be comparable or less than the wavelength in the immersion fluid. This difference {{is due to the fact}} that in immersion inspection surface irregularities do not significantly reduce the energy transmission into the specimen but rather randomize the field through incoherent scattering. Figure 1 shows the schematic diagram of ultrasonic {{inspection of}} a rough specimen by the immersion method. The probability of detection of a given flaw is ultimately limited by the signal-to-noise ratio produced at the receiver. The flaw signal results from coherent reflection from a single, relatively large and strong scatterer. In comparison, the noise is incoherent scattering from a large number of randomly distributed, relatively small and weak scatterers such as material inhomogeneities or geometrical irregularities. Surface roughness can substantially reduce the signal-to-noise ratio with respect to an otherwise similar smooth sample. First, surface roughness attenuates the coherent flaw signal much more than the <b>incoherent</b> <b>material</b> noise [1, 2]. Second, surface roughness increases the overall noise level by adding another incoherent component to the material noise. This paper discusses the adverse effect of the excess surface noise on ultrasonic flaw detection in rough samples...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} a deposit of <b>incoherent</b> <b>materials</b> {{can be carried out}} by {{chemical}} and mineralogical analysis, or, adopting a new approach, by image analysis of surface properties. The aim of this methodology is to establish a link between image parameters (texture and colour), defined on the basis of optical properties, and physico-chemical parameters characterising the set of particles to be evaluated. The technique was applied to an ore deposit of mineral sand composed by three different lithotypes. An appropriate number of samples for each lithotype was selected. Then, a vector of attributes (pattern vector), composed by either texture or colour parameters was associated to each sample. Image parameters are quite sensitive to the conditions in which the images were acquired: optical properties may be strongly influenced by physical condition, in terms of water content and illumination conditions, and by image acquisition accuracy, such as a correct focal point. The standard conditions in acquiring image were chosen in relation to the conditions found on the deposit during sampling. To verify the reliability of the proposed methodology, 45 images were acquired under different conditions of humidity, focusing and illumination. The textural analysis was arranged on these images to evaluate the influence of this parameters on image properties. The data acquired by image analysis are to be used for remote controlling of feeding in mineral processing plants...|$|R
40|$|Mud {{and clay}} vermiculations are {{irregular}} and discontinuous deposits of <b>incoherent</b> <b>materials,</b> almost ubiquitous. Found {{both inside and}} outside of caves, overlying limestone or other materials, they are formed from many substances (clay, mud, candle-black, colloidal silica, etc.). Also their shape dimensions vary greatly. The following genetical hypotheses have been proposed: fossil fillings; chemico-genetical deposition; biological formation; mechanical deposition from moving water or air; clay-layer drying process (Montoriol-Pous hypothesis); physicochemical deposition from drying liquid films. The last is proposed by the authors who, having discussed the various hypotheses, give many examples and the results of some experiments. They distinguish two types of vermiculations: Type 1 or negative vermiculations and Type II or normal vermiculations. The genesis of type I is explained by the Montoriol-Pous hypothesis; these vermiculations are large and made of clay or other colloidal material, and are due to the gradual drying of a layer of clay or other substance. The last stage of this drying process causes the vermiculations to form in a more or less dried state. The vermiculations of the second type are small and thin, much ramified and always with a clear 2 ̆ 2 halo 2 ̆ 2 around them. Vermiculations consisting of many materials have been observed, usually as macroscopic aggregates. They are caused by the drying of a liquid film containing suspended colloidal particles. The proposed mechanism provides a good explanation of all the observed characteristics of vermiculations...|$|R
40|$|Ten {{skilled and}} eleven less skilled sight-readers, {{advanced}} adult pianists, undertook {{two sets of}} studies. First, controlled preview experiments measured dependence of maximised sight-reading tempo on preview size with monophonic, two-part and four- part notation. Secondly, monophonic experiments measured isolated, sight-reading related perceptual and motor sub-skills: a transcription based error detection task and a test of visually unmonitored, unrehearsed output. All experiments employed tonally coherent and <b>incoherent</b> <b>materials,</b> {{with the aim of}} testing the theory that the ability of skilled readers lies in their use of larger preview than less skilled readers, courtesy of their greater sensitivity to musical structure. The skilled group sight-read consistently faster than the less skilled group, achieving larger effective preview with monophonic and four-part, but crucially not with two- part materials. Extra preview use with the former materials was found {{to be a source of}} only small gains, the evidence overall indicating skilled readers' faster performance to have been primarily dependent on a more efficient processing of smaller preview amounts than less skilled readers. Both skill groups demonstrated similar, limited tempo responses to the structural distinction in experimental materials, with no structural effect on preview for skilled readers. These results suggest, therefore, that the skilled group's superior performance was primarily due to perceptuo-motor factors. This finding is confirmed by the skilled group's faster performance on the two sub- skill studies. On the perceptual study, both groups display similar patterns of response and sensitivity to structure. In terms of motor skill, compared to less skilled readers, skilled readers are either better at unrehearsed output, non-visually monitored performance, or both. Finally, individual participant data suggest sight-reading to be a complex combination of skills: many participants show significant variation in performance across the studies, and there is evidence for a number of different factors limiting skill development amongst less skilled readers...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{investigated}} the biogeophysical and biogeochemical weathering associated {{to the growth}} of epilithic lichens on recent lava flows from Mt. Etna (Sicily) and Mt. Vesuvius (Campania). The chosen lichen species were the crustose Lecidea fuscoatra, the foliose Xanthoparmelia conspersa and the fruticose Stereocaulon vesuvianum. An integrated approach based on the study of both disturbed and undisturbed samples of lichenized rock was applied in order to allow for the complexity of the rock???lichen interface environment in terms of micromorphological, mineralogical and chemical properties. To this aim, a number of rock blocks colonised by intact thalli of different lichen species were collected in order to have at least 10 thalli for each species in each environment. XRD and XRF analyses coupled to microscopic (OM), submicroscopic (SEM) and microanalytical (EDS) observations were the used techniques. In both study environments, the chemical, mineralogical and micromorphological properties of the <b>incoherent</b> <b>materials</b> found at the rock???lichen interface suggested that they mostly consist of rock fragments eroded from the surroundings and accumulated in cavities and fissures of the rough lava flows. According to the thallus morphology, the lichens colonising the lava preserve the interface materials from further wind and water erosion, provide such materials with organic matter and moisture, and entrap allochthonous quartz, sea salts, iron oxides and clay minerals. Calcium oxalate production by L. fuscoatra and X. conspersa, Al enrichment around S. vesuvianum hyphae and iron accumulation at the interface constitute evidence of lichen interaction with the underlying sediments. Larger differences between rock and interface materials occur at Vesuvius vs Etna site. In line with the young age of the lavas, recent lichen colonisation only results in a physical reorganisation and slight chemical modification of the materials accumulated at the rock???lichen interface, whose abundance should not be considered an indicator of bioweathering. In volcanic environments, the ability of lichens to retain a considerable amount of unconsolidated material...|$|R
40|$|A {{regolith}} {{is defined}} as a layer or mantle of loose, <b>incoherent,</b> rocky <b>material</b> of whatever origin, that nearly everywhere forms the surface of the land and rests on coherent bedrock.

The present investigation is concerned with the special case of regolith formation and evolution on small objects, such as asteroids and meteorite parent bodies. First order models of regolith evolution on asteroidal surfaces are constructed on the basis of data provided by studies of lunar samples and meteorites. It appears that regolith formation proceeds by deposition of discrete layers of the widely spread ejecta primarily from the larger impacts.

40|$|International audienceSpeech Perception {{involves}} {{fusion of}} multiple sensory input and it doesn’t fuse automatically, perhaps {{it depends on}} numerous external/internal factors (e. g. attention, noise or age). In this paper, we exploit a specific paradigm in which a short audiovisual context made of coherent or <b>incoherent</b> speech <b>material</b> is displayed before an incongruent audiovisual target likely to provide fusion (McGurk effect, McGurk & MacDonald, 1976). We confirm that incoherent context leads to unbinding, that is {{a reduction in the}} amount of fusion. Importantly, adding acoustic noise in the context though not in the target increases fusion. This suggests that listeners systematically evaluate the reliability of their sensory channels and weight them accordingly in the fusion process. We also show that older subjects display more unbinding, and discuss the potential consequences concerning their ability to understand speech in adverse conditions. We relate all these data to a “Binding-and-Fusion” model of audiovisual speech perception...|$|R
40|$|The {{shape of}} {{volcanic}} particles {{is an important}} parameter holding information related to physical and geochemical processes. The study of particle shape may help improving knowledge on the main eruptive processes (fragmentation, transport and sedimentation) during explosive activity. In general, volcanic ash is formed by different components, namely juvenile, lithic and crystal particles, each one characterized by peculiar morphology. Moreover, quantifying the shape of pyroclasts is needed by the most recent dispersal models that consider shape parameters as input data to simulate tephra dispersal. However, measuring and quantifying the particle shape of volcanic particles are hard challenges especially {{when the number of}} the particles to investigate is high and the size small (e. g. sub-millimetric). Several methods are currently used in volcanology, the most common probably being quantitative shape analysis by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), based on the acquisition and subsequent analysis of digital images. Here, we describe a new methodology to measure the shape of volcanic particles by CAMSIZER®, a compact laboratory instrument developed by Retsch Technology (see [URL] for the simultaneous measurement of particle size distribution and particle shape of <b>incoherent</b> <b>materials</b> in the range of 30 µm to 30 mm, based on digital image processing. The sample is fed in from a vibrating feed channel that controls particles falling through the measurement field, where images of the particle are recorded by two digital cameras (Basic and Zoom) with different resolutions. Software, created by Retsch Technology, enables digital image processing to provide grain-size and shape parameters. This instrument, very common for quality control in industry, research and production monitoring of very different kinds of materials, has been installed at Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Sezione di Catania (INGV-CT) to measure and validate grain-size distribution of volcanic particles (Lo Castro and Andronico, 2008; 2009). Recently, we made a new study to assess its use in analysing the shape of volcanic particles. Size and shape of particles are calculated by applying a number of mathematical models related to different geometric parameters that influence the final results. Measures of shape parameters (e. g. Feret diameter, roundness, symmetry, width, length) are performed under a high resolution scanning of each particle in 64 different directions. In order to study volcanic particle shape characteristics, we performed different tests on volcanic and non-volcanic materials, considering the most commonly used shape parameters. Finally, we compared and validated the obtained results with those carried out by binocular microscope image analysis on the same samples. Furthermore, {{on the basis of these}} measurements, a clustering analysis is proposed. In particular, the Self Organized Map (SOM) and the K-means algorithm have been used jointly in order to partition a generic sample of volcanic ash particles into subsets sharing some common shape features. A fuzzy c-mean analysis has also been used to verify and compare results. These analyses were aimed at developing an automatic shape clustering of the volcanic ash particles. Preliminary results of both image analysis and statistical testing are shown to understand if CAMSIZER is a suitable tool for quantifying and characterizing volcanic particle shapes...|$|R
40|$|Grain size {{distribution}} {{is a key}} parameter in physical volcanology to describe and characterize tephra fall deposits. Walker (1973) used grain size parameters to propose a classification scheme of explosive volcanic eruptions. More recently, the role of grain size populations of eruptive mixtures at the vent has been widely considered a crucial input parameter {{for the application of}} numerical models simulating both plume and tephra dispersal (e. g. Cioni et al., 2003; Andronico et al., 2008; Scollo et al., 2008). Grain size analysis can be performed by various techniques that differ in their applicability, technology and affordability. The most commonly used technique is sieving, performed by a nested column of sieves arranged in decreasing order of aperture size ([URL] Sieving can be performed manually or by machine shaking, usually in the particle range from 64 mm to less than 32 µm. Both these procedures are cumbersome, time-consuming and subject to many errors. Here, we present a new methodology to measure the distribution of volcanic particles by CAMSIZER® (Figure 1), an instrument developed by Retsch Technology GmbH (Haan) and Jenoptik AG (Jena) in Germany (see at [URL] CAMSIZER is a compact laboratory instrument for the simultaneous measurement of particle {{size distribution}} and particle shape of <b>incoherent</b> <b>materials</b> in the range of 30 µm to 30 mm, based on digital image processing. The sample is fed in from a vibrating feed channel that controls particles falling through the measurement field, where images of the particle flow are recorded by two digital cameras (Basic and Zoom) with different resolutions (Andronico et al., 2009). The Basic camera provides the analysis of the larger particles, while the Zoom camera focuses on smaller particles furnishing high resolution images of the finer classes of the wide measuring range. Software created by Retsch Technology enables processing digital images and providing grain size and shape parameters. Although this instrument is becoming very common in industry for quality control, research and production monitoring of very different kinds of materials, it has never been used before in volcanology. CAMSIZER has recently been installed at Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Sezione di Catania (INGV-CT) to measure grain-size distribution of volcanic particles within the volcanic monitoring activity of Eastern Sicily (Lo Castro and Andronico, 2008). As is well-known, this area is characterized by the presence of two of the most active volcanoes in the world, Mt. Etna and Stromboli, which commonly produce large quantities of tephra (e. g. Rosi et al., 2000; Alparone et al., 2007). The use of CAMSIZER on volcanic products ranging from fine lapilli to ash have allowed us to obtain detailed particle size analysis and drastically reduce the work and measuring time needed in classical sieve analysis. To optimize these objectives, CAMSIZER has been tested on different materials, not only volcanic, in order to calibrate the instrument and compare results with those obtained by sieving. In particular, we present results derived by two different kinds of test: the first regards repeatability by measuring the same sample several times to determine the accuracy of the instrument, the second concerns the compatibility between sieve analysis and CAMSIZER results. Our work suggests that CAMSIZER may constitute a good tool to improve grain size analysis in volcanology and thus help in tephra hazard assessments...|$|R

40|$|Definitions of {{regolith}} have proliferated in the 106 {{years since}} the work of Merill (1897). He wrote of the <b>incoherent</b> mass of <b>material</b> covering underlying rocks: “In places this covering {{is made up of}} material originating through weathering in-situ. In other instances it is of fragmental and more or less decomposed material drifted by wind, water or ice from other sources. This entire mantle of unconsolidated material, whatever its nature or origin, it is proposed to call the regolith from the Greek words regos (rehgos), meaning blanket, and lijos (lithos), a stone. ” Subsequently other definitions came into vogue. One widely accessible example is that of Gary et al.

It includes rock debris (weathered in place) of all kinds, volcanic ash, glacial drift, alluvium, loess and eolian deposits, vegetal accumulations, and soils. ” This definition introduced the term to the geological community and captured the essential nature of regolith, that it formed the cover to bedrock.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Materials Science and Engineering Program, Washington State UniversityNano-scale {{strengthening}} mechanisms for thin films were investigated for systems governed by two different strengthening techniques: nano-laminate strengthening and oxide dispersion strengthening. Films were tested under elevated temperature conditions to investigate changes in deformation mechanisms at different operating temperatures, and the structural stability. Both systems exhibit remarkable stability after annealing and thus long-term reliability. Nano-scale metallic multilayers with smaller layer thicknesses show a greater relative resistance to decreasing strength at higher temperature testing conditions {{than those with}} larger layer thicknesses. This is seen in both Cu/Ni/Nb multilayers {{as well as a}} similar tri-component bi-layer system (Cu-Ni/Nb), which removed the coherent interface from the film. Both nanoindentation and micro-pillar compression tests investigated the strain-hardening ability of these two systems to determine what role the coherent interface plays in this mechanism. Tri-layer films showed a higher strain-hardening ability as the layer thickness decreased and a higher strain-hardening exponent than the bi-layer system: verifying the presence of a coherent interface increases the strain-hardening ability of these multilayer systems. Both systems exhibited hardening of the room temperature strength after annealing, suggesting a change in microstructure has occurred, unlike that seen in other multilayer systems. Oxide dispersion strengthened Au films showed a marked increase in hardness and wear resistance with the addition of ZnO particles. The threshold for stress-induced grain-refinement as opposed to grain growth is seen at concentrations of at least 0. 5 vol%. These systems exhibited stable microstructures during thermal cycling in films containing at least 1. 0 %ZnO. Nanoindentation experiments show the drop in hardness following annealing is almost completely attributed to the resulting grain growth. Four-point probe resistivity measurements on annealed films showed a significant drop in resistivity for the higher concentration ZnO films, which is proposed {{to be the result of}} a change in the particle-matrix interface structure. A model connecting the hardness and resistivity as a function of ZnO concentration has been developed based on the assumption that the impact of nm-scale ZnO precipitates on the mechanical and electrical behavior of Au films is likely dominated by a transition from semi-coherent to <b>incoherent</b> interfaces. <b>Materials</b> Science and Engineering Program, Washington State Universit...|$|R
40|$|The main {{aspects of}} {{environmental}} degradation can be ascribed to soil (erosion, soil compaction, soil crusting, deterioration of soil structure, flooding, losses of organic matter, salinisation, onsite and offsite damages, etc.) following the impact of human activities. Since agricultural conventional production systems have resulted in excessive erosion and soil degradation, there is need to control and fight such degradation. Scientific results have clearly showed that the agricultural management systems {{can play an important}} role in preventing soil degradation provide that appropriate management practices are adopted. Long-term field experiments in different types of soils have shown that alternative tillage systems, like minimum tillage, ripper subsoiling, etc., improve the soil structural quality. The continuous conventional tillage causes a decrease of soil organic matter content that is associated to a decrease of aggregate stability, leading, as a consequence, to the formation of surface crusts, with an increase of runoff and erosion risks. Other aspects of very dangerous soil degradation (erosion) in the hilly environments are represented by land levelling and scraping. After levelling, slopes being prepared for plantation (in particularly vineyard) are almost always characterised by the presence of large amounts of <b>incoherent</b> earth <b>materials</b> accumulated with scraper. In this vulnerable condition, a few summer storms can easily cause soil losses exceeding 500 Mg ha- 1 y- 1. Moreover, the land levelling and the following soil loss causes drastic alteration of the landscape and loss of the cultural value of soil. Subsoil compaction is strongly under evaluated, even though the presence of a ploughpan at the lower limit of cultivation is largely widespread in the alluvial soils of the plains cultivated by monoculture and it is responsible of the frequent flooding of such plains in occasion of heavy rains concentrated in a short time (rainstorm), because the presence of this ploughpan strongly reduced drainage. Alternative tillage practices, like ripper subsoiling, are able to avoiding the formation of this compact layer. The soil conservation can be realised through a correct soil management and, therefore, it is essential to know this resource and to have pedological data bases of appropriate detail...|$|R

For this purpose, three important dates (1955, 1977, 2000) of the district history have been considered and two different periods are analysed (1955 - 1977 and 1977 - 2000). Multitemporal analysis was carried out through the study of aerial photographs {{which resulted in the}} production of three 1 : 10. 000 land cover maps. Vegetational data were obtained through the phytosociological study of the area. The results show the evolution of the natural vegetation as general trend in the territory. Particular analysis was carried out on the mining areas (mining dumps, surface mines and tailing dams) to understand how much and how have been re-colonized by the native vegetation. For the mining dumps the main transformations are towards the mediterranean maquis, the garrigue and the corkoak woods. The surface mines was stable in the first period for 73. 6 % and the main changes are due to the diffusion of natural vegetation (e. g. to mediterranean maquis 14. 7 %). With regard to the tailing dams we observed an increase of stability (from 81. 6 % to 96. 1 %) together with a global increase of surface from 1955 to 2000.

This study looked at the prevalence of damages in relation to ground conditions. Municipal roads in Nedre Eiker were used as a case in this work, and the study {{concludes that the}}re are four prominent types of injuries that occur in 4 different soil conditions. The 4 damage types are cracks, crazing, desiccation and patching. The 4 different zones with soil conditions are zone 41 (Ocean and fjord deposition, continuous cover, often with large thickness), 50 (River and stream deposition), 72 (Weathering <b>Material,</b> <b>incoherent</b> or thin cover over the bedrock) and 120 (Filling material (anthropogenic material)) from the maps from Norges Geologiske Undersøkelse. Through literature search, data collection and analysis, and evaluating results against the literature, this study shows that the proven damage {{is related to the}} ground where the road is built. Using the available literature, the study proposes what measures will be most sustainable, efficient and economical for the roads. The measures are as follows: Soil zone 41 : The zone contains frost hazardous materials, and the best action would be to build up the road again with a new substructure. The costs can be kept down if some work can be performed in combination with water and sewer upgrade. An effective drainage can extend the life of the asphalt surface, but will not eliminate problems with frost. Soil zone 50 : The zone contains a lot of sand and gravel, which suggests that a good drainage will be able to extend the road life. In addition, it will be effective to lower the groundwater level whenever possible. Soil zone 72 : The zone contains a thin <b>incoherent</b> layer weathering <b>material.</b> An efficient drainage system could extend its lifetime. Construction of a new thick substructure will probably have a poor benefit / cost. Alternatively, it could pay off with a thin supporting layer under the asphalt surface if the road will be dug up for other reasons. Soil zone 120 : This is a zone which may contain many different soil qualities. This area must be carried out geological surveys to determine the best actions. But drainage is an action that always will provide an improvement, so this will give (small) gains if there is no economy to greater improvements and sampling. This report concludes finally that there are effective solutions to road maintenance even though the road is built on a poor foundation. An extended study can find good solutions for several types of soils and ground conditions than is presented in this report. The Norwegian road network represents great values that require continuous monitoring and maintenance to maintain the desired quality. Since municipalities as road owner often have limited resources, it is important to prioritize measures where these provide the greatest economic benefit. Many of the municipal roads in Norway is in poor condition, probably both because of the bad economy and lack of expertise at the time these roads were established. The results presented in this thesis is arrived at through an extensive registration of damage to municipal roads in Nedre Eiker, study of maps from Norges Geologiske Undersøkelse, Statens Kartverk, Statens Vegvesen and from PMS RoSy. All map data is compiled in the GIS tool QGIS where special features are used to extract relevant data from the maps in form of tables. Then all data recorded in the tables processed and analyzed using Excel...|$|R
