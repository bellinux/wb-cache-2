Nevertheless, a few days after Henry's death, on 4 February, the executors chose to invest almost regal power in Edward Seymour, now Duke of Somerset. Thirteen out of the sixteen (the others being absent) agreed to his appointment as Protector, which they justified as their joint decision [...] "by virtue of the authority" [...] of Henry's will.

500|$|Perot {{participated in}} the first of three presidential debates for the 1992 election, on October 11 in Clayton, Missouri, along with George Bush and Bill Clinton. It {{was the first time that}} a third party {{candidate}} was involved in a national televised debate since John B. Anderson in 1980, and was the first presidential debate to ever feature three candidates. During the event, Perot discussed a wide range of issues including the budget deficit, education and drug use, and proclaimed that as president, he would eliminate the influence of lobbyists. He also had a few memorable quips. When asked to address detractors' criticism of his lack of government experience, he remarked: [...] "Well, they've got a point. I don't have any experience running up a $4 trillion debt." [...] When discussing what would happen if one of his opponents won, he commented: [...] "then they will have heard the harsh reality of what we have to do. I'm not playing Lawrence Welk music here tonight." [...] After the debate, three out of four polls declared Perot as the winner. The average of all four showed Perot at 37% followed by Clinton with 30% and Bush with 18%, but election polls still showed Perot in third with 14%, far behind both Bush and Clinton. His running mate, James Stockdale, participated in a Vice Presidential debate in Atlanta, with fellow Vice Presidential nominee Al Gore and Vice President Dan Quayle. Largely unknown to the general public, Stockdale memorably opened the debate by unexpectedly asking the philosophical question, [...] "Who am I? Why am I here?" [...] He was unprepared to <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the substantive issues raised, and his struggling performance may have damaged the Perot campaign.|$|E
