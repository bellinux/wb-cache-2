5|$|The {{period of}} <b>Daylight</b> <b>Saving</b> <b>Time</b> before the longest day is {{shorter than the}} period after, in several {{countries}} including the United States and Europe. This unequal split is an energy saving measure. For example, in the U.S. the period of <b>Daylight</b> <b>Saving</b> <b>Time</b> {{is defined by the}} Energy Policy Act of 2005. The period for <b>Daylight</b> <b>Saving</b> <b>Time</b> was extended by changing the start date from the first Sunday of April to the second Sunday of March, and the end date from the last Sunday in October to the first Sunday in November.|$|E
5|$|<b>Daylight</b> <b>saving</b> <b>time</b> (abbreviated DST), {{commonly}} referred to as daylight savings time in speech, and known as summer time in some countries, is the practice of advancing clocks during summer months so that evening daylight lasts longer, while sacrificing normal sunrise times. Typically, regions that use <b>daylight</b> <b>saving</b> <b>time</b> adjust clocks forward one hour close to the start of spring and adjust them backward in the autumn to standard time.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} time in the United States {{includes}} DST during both world wars, but no standardization of peacetime DST until 1966. In May 1965, for two weeks, St. Paul, Minnesota and Minneapolis, Minnesota were on different times, when the capital city decided to join most of the nation by starting <b>Daylight</b> <b>Saving</b> <b>Time</b> while Minneapolis opted to follow the later date set by state law. In the mid-1980s, Clorox (parent of Kingsford Charcoal) and 7-Eleven provided the primary funding for the <b>Daylight</b> <b>Saving</b> <b>Time</b> Coalition behind the 1987 extension to U.S. DST, and both Idaho senators voted for it {{based on the premise that}} during DST fast-food restaurants sell more French fries, which are made from Idaho potatoes.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{controversial}} measures Daniels successfully pushed through was the state adoption of <b>Daylight</b> <b>Saving</b> <b>Time,</b> which Daniels argued would save the state money on energy costs. Although the state is in the Eastern Time Zone, Indiana's counties had adopted their own time zone practices, and in practice the state effectively observed two different times, and {{the central part of the}} state maintained a single time—Eastern Standard—year round. Interests for both EST and CST time zones had prevented the official adoption of daylight saving since the 1930s, and had led to decades of debate. Daniels pressed for the entire state to switch to Central Time, but the General Assembly could not come to terms. Ultimately after a long debate, they adopted Eastern <b>Daylight</b> <b>Saving</b> <b>Time</b> in April 2005, the measure passing by one vote, putting all but northwestern and southwestern Indiana on the same time for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Broadly speaking, <b>daylight</b> <b>saving</b> <b>time</b> was {{abandoned}} {{in the years after}} the war (with some notable exceptions including Canada, the UK, France, and Ireland). However, it was brought back for periods of time in many different places during the following decades and commonly during World War II. It became widely adopted, particularly in North America and Europe, starting in the 1970s {{as a result of the}} 1970s energy crisis.|$|E

5|$|These {{limitations}} {{have caused}} problems. For example, before 2005, DST in Israel varied {{each year and}} was skipped some years. Windows 95 used rules correct for 1995 only, causing problems in later years. In Windows 98, Microsoft marked Israel as not having DST, forcing Israeli users to shift their computer clocks manually twice a year. The 2005 Israeli Daylight Saving Law established predictable rules using the Jewish calendar but Windows zone files could not represent the rules' dates in a year-independent way. Partial workarounds, which mishandled older time stamps, included manually switching zone files every year and a Microsoft tool that switches zones automatically. In 2013, Israel standardized its <b>daylight</b> <b>saving</b> <b>time</b> according to the Gregorian calendar.|$|E

In May 2016, the Azerbaijan government decided to abandon the use of <b>daylight</b> <b>saving</b> <b>time,</b> prompting event organisers to change the start time of the race. The revised start time negated the clash between the start of the Grand Prix and the race in Le Mans.|$|E
5|$|The 1973–1974 {{oil embargo}} had lasting {{effects on the}} United States and other industrialized nations, which {{established}} the International Energy Agency in response, as well as national emergency stockpiles designed to withstand months of future supply disruptions. Oil conservation efforts included lower speed limits on highways, smaller and more energy-efficient cars and appliances, year-round <b>daylight</b> <b>saving</b> <b>time,</b> reduced usage of heating and air-conditioning, better insulation, increased support of mass transit, and greater emphasis on coal, natural gas, ethanol, nuclear and other alternative energy sources. These long-term efforts became effective enough that US oil consumption would rise only 11 percent during 1980–2014, while real GDP rose 150 percent. But in the 1970s, OPEC nations demonstrated convincingly that their oil {{could be used as}} both a political and economic weapon against other nations, {{at least in the short}} term.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{plans for}} {{the facade of the}} dam, the power plant, the outlet tunnels and {{ornaments}} clashed with the modern look of an arch dam. The Bureau of Reclamation, more concerned with the dam's functionality, adorned it with a Gothic-inspired balustrade and eagle statues. This initial design was criticized by many as being too plain and unremarkable for a project of such immense scale, so Los Angeles-based architect Gordon B. Kaufmann, then the supervising architect to the Bureau of Reclamation, was brought in to redesign the exteriors. Kaufmann greatly streamlined the design, and applied an elegant Art Deco style to the entire project. He designed sculptured turrets rising seamlessly from the dam face and clock faces on the intake towers set for the time in Nevada and Arizona— both states are in different time zones, but since Arizona does not observe <b>Daylight</b> <b>Saving</b> <b>Time,</b> the clocks display the same time for more than half the year.|$|E

50|$|In 2005, the Maine state {{legislature}} considered switching {{the entire state}} to Atlantic Standard Time all year long, therefore eliminating <b>Daylight</b> <b>Savings</b> <b>Time.</b> This is because in the winter, sunset can come in some areas as early as 3:42 PM.
