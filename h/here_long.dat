2500|$|Aleppo's large Christian {{population}} swelled {{with the}} influx of Armenian and Assyrian-Syriac Christian refugees during the early 20th-century and after the Armenian and Assyrian genocides of 1915. After {{the arrival of the}} first groups of Armenian refugees (1915–1922) the population of Aleppo in 1922 counted 156,748 of which Muslims were 97,600 (62.26%), native Christians -mostly Catholics- 22,117 (14.11%), Jews 6,580 (4.20%), Europeans 2,652 (1.70%), Armenian refugees 20,007 (12.76%) and others 7,792 (4.97%). However, even though a large majority of the Armenians arrived during the period, the city has had an Armenian community since at least the 1100s, [...] when a considerable number of Armenian families and merchants from the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia settled in the city. The oldest Armenian church in the city is from 1491 as well, which indicates that they have been <b>here</b> <b>long</b> before.|$|E
2500|$|Probably {{the major}} issue troubling American {{archaeology}} {{over the last}} several decades has been establishing when the first humans arrived in the western hemisphere. [...] For nearly half a century the very large majority of working archaeologists adhered to the notion that people making and using the very distinctive Clovis [...] "point" [...] and its associated lithic technology were the first to arrive about 13,500 calendar years ago and to have spread quickly throughout the Americas. [...] However, there was always a small archaeological minority who contended that the first Americans (in the broadest, two-continent, sense) had been <b>here</b> <b>long</b> before Clovis times on both the east and west margins of both continents. [...] In the last several decades, with the location, investigation, and reporting {{of a growing number of}} sites with reliable dating, more and more American archaeologists now believe the western hemisphere was occupied at least several thousand years prior to the appearance of diagnostic Clovis materials.|$|E
2500|$|Chrétien's {{most notable}} {{achievement}} at Indian Affairs was the 1969 White Paper, {{a proposal to}} abolish the Indian Act. The paper was widely opposed by First Nations groups, and later abandoned. It was the 1969 White Paper that first brought Chrétien to widespread public attention in English Canada. At a press conference announcing the White Paper, Chrétien openly clashed with Indian activists with one First Nations women asking Chrétien [...] "When did we lose our identity?", to which the minister replied [...] "When you signed the treaties", which prompted boos and jeers. Another women from the Iroquois reserve at Brantford asked Chrétien [...] "How can you come here and ask us to become citizens, when we were <b>here</b> <b>long</b> before you?", noting the Crown had granted the Grand River valley to Joseph Brant in 1784, to which Chrétien had no reply. The Cree activist Harold Cardinal in his bestselling 1969 book The Unjust Society attacked Chrétien and Trudeau for the White Paper, accusing them of [...] "cultural genocide" [...] against the First Nations. To counteract such criticism, Chrétien during a 1970 visit to the Northwest Territories adopted from the local orphanage in Inuvik an Inuit boy, whom he named Michel, whose mother was an alcoholic prostitute and whose unknown father {{had been one of}} her johns. As Indian Affairs Minister, Chrétien {{fell in love with the}} far north of Canada, whose beauty moved him, and he vacationed in the north every summer during his time while holding the Indian Affairs portfolio.|$|E
