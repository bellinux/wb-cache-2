5|$|A {{narrative}} rational for {{the concept}} of Hell {{can be found in}} the Hindu epic, Mahabharata. This narrative ends with Yudhishthira's visit to hell after being offered acceptance into heaven. This journey creates a scene for the audience that helps illustrate the importance of understanding hell as well as heaven before accepting either extreme. This idea provides an essential lesson regarding Dharma, a primary theme within the Mahabharata. Dharma is not a black and white concept, and all people are not entirely good or entirely evil. As such, tolerance is essential in order to truly understand the “right way of living”. We all must understand the worst to truly understand and appreciate the best just as we must <b>experience</b> <b>the</b> best before we can <b>experience</b> <b>the</b> worst. This narrative utilizes the Hindu religion in order to teach lessons on tolerance and acceptance of one another's faults as well as virtues.|$|E

5000|$|The Other (when {{written with}} a capital [...] "O") is a concept more {{properly}} belonging to phenomenology and its account of intersubjectivity. However, the concept has seen widespread use in existentialist writings, and the conclusions drawn from it differ slightly from the phenomenological accounts. <b>The</b> <b>experience</b> of <b>the</b> Other is <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> of another free subject who inhabits the same world as a person does. In its most basic form, it is this <b>experience</b> of <b>the</b> Other that constitutes intersubjectivity and objectivity. To clarify, when one experiences someone else, and this Other person <b>experiences</b> <b>the</b> world (the same world that a person experiences)—only from [...] "over there"—the world itself is constituted as objective {{in that it is}} something that is [...] "there" [...] as identical for both of the subjects; a person <b>experiences</b> <b>the</b> other person as <b>experiencing</b> <b>the</b> same things. This <b>experience</b> of <b>the</b> Other's look is what is termed the Look (sometimes the Gaze).|$|R
