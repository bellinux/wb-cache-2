5|$|By 1936 {{there was}} already a demand for reprints of Tintin <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviets, with Lesne sending a letter to Hergé enquiring if this was possible. The {{cartoonist}} was reluctant, stating that the original plates for the story were now in a poor condition and {{that as a result}} he would have to redraw the entire story were it to be re-published. Several years later, amid the German occupation of Belgium during World War II, a German-run publishing company asked Hergé for permission to republish Tintin <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviets, with the intent of using it as anti-Soviet propaganda, but again Hergé declined the offer.|$|E

5|$|Grim Fandango {{takes place}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dead (the Eighth Underworld), where {{recently}} departed souls {{aim to make}} their way to the Land of Eternal Rest (the Ninth Underworld). Good deeds in life are rewarded by access to better travel packages to assist in making the journey of the soul, the best of which is the Number Nine, a train that takes four minutes to reach the gate to the Ninth Underworld. Souls who did not lead a kind life are left to travel through the Land of the Dead on foot, which would take around four years. Such souls often lose faith in the existence of the Ninth Underworld and instead find jobs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dead. The travel agents of the Department of Death act as the Grim Reaper to escort the souls from the mortal world to the Land of the Dead, and then determine which mode of transport the soul has merited. Each year on the Day of the Dead, these souls are allowed to visit their families <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Living.|$|E
5|$|A {{version of}} the game with VGA {{graphics}} and sound card audio appeared in 1991. Leisure Suit Larry 1: <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lounge Lizards used the new game engine Sierra's Creative Interpreter and was released in 1991 for the Amiga, DOS, and Macintosh platforms. For the first remake, Al Lowe served as director and designer, also helping to program the game, and Ken Williams became executive producer. Other key people included Stuart Moulder (producer), William R. Davis Sr. (creative director), William D. Skirvin (art designer), Mark Seibert (music director), Oliver Brelsford (lead programmer), and the music other than the theme song was composed by Chris Braymen.|$|E

5|$|Eskimo was not {{the first}} {{dramatic}} film to use an all-native cast for the native roles; that was the 1914 silent film <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Head Hunters. It was, however, the first motion picture to be filmed in the language of a Native American people, and the first feature film shot in Alaska. Ray Mala became nationally famous for his work in Eskimo, and subsequently had a long career as a lead and supporting actor in Hollywood.|$|E
5|$|Following on from Tintin <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviets and {{bolstered by}} {{publicity}} stunts, Tintin in the Congo was a commercial success within Belgium {{and was also}} serialised in France. Hergé continued The Adventures of Tintin with Tintin in America in 1932, and the series subsequently became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. In 1946, Hergé re-drew and coloured Tintin in the Congo in his distinctive ligne-claire style for republication by Casterman, with further alterations made {{at the request of}} his Scandinavian publisher for a 1975 edition.|$|E
5|$|Literary critic Tom McCarthy {{thought that}} The Black Island linked to Hergé's other Adventures in various ways; he {{connected}} the counterfeit {{money in the}} story to the counterfeit idol in The Broken Ear and the fake bunker in Tintin <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviets. He also connected Tintin's solving of the puzzle in the airman's jacket to his solving of the pirate puzzles in The Secret of the Unicorn, and that in transmitting from a place of death, Ben Mor, or mort (death), it linked to Tintin's transmitting from the crypt of Marlinspike Hall in The Secret of the Unicorn.|$|E

5|$|Although Hergé {{wanted to}} send Tintin to the United States, Wallez ordered him to set his {{adventure}} in the Soviet Union, acting as anti-socialist propaganda for children. The result, Tintin <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviets, was serialised in Le Petit Vingtième from January 1929 to May 1930. Popular in Francophone Belgium, Wallez organised a publicity stunt at the Gare du Nord station, following which he organised {{the publication of the}} story in book form. The story's popularity led to an increase in sales, so Wallez granted Hergé two assistants. At Wallez's direction, in June he began serialisation of the second story, Tintin in the Congo, designed to encourage colonial sentiment towards the Belgian Congo. Authored in a paternalistic style that depicted the Congolese as childlike idiots, in later decades it was accused of racism, however at the time was un-controversial and popular, and further publicity stunts were held to increase sales.|$|E
5|$|As hats {{go out of}} fashion, the {{anthropomorphic}} bear Popol the Hatter {{heads into}} the American West with his wife Virginia and blue donkey, Bluebell. Setting up camp <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bunnokee, a tribe of anthropomorphic rabbit Native Americans, he does good business there. This infuriates the Bunnokee medicine man, whose feather headdress business has declined as a result. He and the Chief of the Bunnokees conspire to eradicate the economic threat, launching war against Popol. Using technology that is more advanced than the Bunnokee's bow and arrows, Popol defeats the rabbits' initial attacks, but they retaliate by abducting Virginia and threatening to torture her. Popol then rescues her, and together they escape, coming upon a river in which they discover gold.|$|E
5|$|Born {{to a lower}} middle-class {{family in}} Etterbeek, Brussels, Hergé began his career by {{contributing}} illustrations to Scouting magazines, developing his first comic series, The Adventures of Totor, for Le Boy-Scout Belge in 1926. Working for the conservative Catholic newspaper Le Vingtième Siècle, he created The Adventures of Tintin in 1929 {{on the advice of}} its editor Norbert Wallez. Revolving around the actions of boy reporter Tintin and his dog Snowy, the series' early instalments – Tintin <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviets, Tintin in the Congo, and Tintin in America – were designed as conservative propaganda for children. Domestically successful, after serialisation the stories were published in book form, with Hergé continuing the series and also developing both the Quick & Flupke and Jo, Zette and Jocko series for Le Vingtième Siècle. Influenced by his friend Zhang Chongren, from 1934 Hergé placed far greater emphasis on conducting background research for his stories, resulting in increased realism from The Blue Lotus onward. Following the German occupation of Belgium in 1940, Le Vingtième Siècle was closed but Hergé continued his series in Le Soir, a popular newspaper controlled by the Nazi administration.|$|E

5|$|In 550, a pro-Persian revolt {{broke out}} among the Abasgians, a people that neighboured Lazica to the north. This {{provided}} {{an opportunity for a}} high-ranking Lazic noble, called Terdetes, who had quarrelled with Gubazes, to betray to the Persians Tzibile, an important fort <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Apsili, a tribe under Lazic suzerainty. The Apsili retook the fort, but refused to accept Lazic rule until persuaded to do so by the Byzantine general John Guzes. In 551, the Byzantines finally took and razed Petra, but a new army under Mihr-Mihroe was able to establish Persian control over the eastern part of Lazica. The Byzantine forces in Lazica withdrew west to the mouth of the Phasis, while the Lazi, including Gubazes and his family, sought refuge in the mountains. Despite enduring harsh conditions in the winter of 551/552, Gubazes rejected the peace offers conveyed by envoys from Mihr-Mihroe. In 552, the Persians received substantial reinforcements, but their attacks on the fortresses held by the Byzantines and the Lazi were repulsed.|$|E
