40|$|Although <b>inner</b> star-forming <b>rings</b> {{are common}} in optical images of barred spiral galaxies, {{observational}} evidence for the accompanying molecular gas has been scarce. In this paper we present images of molecular <b>inner</b> <b>rings,</b> traced using the CO (1 - 0) emission line, from the Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland-Association Survey of Nearby Galaxies (BIMA SONG). We detect <b>inner</b> <b>ring</b> CO emission from all five SONG barred galaxies classified as <b>inner</b> <b>ring</b> (type (r)). We also examine the seven SONG barred galaxies classified as inner spiral (type (s)); in one of these, NGC 3627, we find morphological and kinematic evidence for a molecular <b>inner</b> <b>ring.</b> <b>Inner</b> <b>ring</b> galaxies have been classified as such based on optical images, which emphasize recent star formation. We {{consider the possibility that}} there may exist <b>inner</b> <b>rings</b> in which star formation efficiency is not enhanced. However, we find that in NGC 3627 the <b>inner</b> <b>ring</b> star formation efficiency is enhanced relative to most other regions in that galaxy. We note that the SONG (r) galaxies have a paucity of CO and H alpha emission interior to the <b>inner</b> <b>ring</b> (except near the nucleus), while NGC 3627 has relatively bright bar CO and H alpha emission; we suggest that galaxies with <b>inner</b> <b>rings</b> such as NGC 3627 may be misclassified if there are significant amounts of gas and star formation in the bar.
