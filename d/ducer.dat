40|$|Vibrothermography, {{also known}} as Sonic IR and Thermosonics, is an NDE {{technique}} for finding cracks and flaws based on vibration-induced frictional rubbing of unbonded surfaces. The vibration is usually generated by a piezoelectric stack transducer which transduces electri- cal energy into large amplitude mechanical vibrations. The {{purpose of this study}} is to develop an understanding of the excitation process for vibrothermography so that optimal parameters and transducers for the testing can be selected. The amplitude and impedance transfer charac- teristics of the transducer system control the vibration of the sample. Within a linear contact (no tip chatter) model, the interaction between the transducer system and the specimen can be characterized using the theory of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems and electro-mechanical Norton equivalence. This work presents quantitative measurements of the performance of piezoelectric stack transducers in a vibrothermography excitation system and the effect of transducer perfor- mance and specimen characteristics on the induced vibration in the specimen. We show that with compliant coupling, the specimen vibration is directly proportional to the transducer open circuit velocity and that the system resonances generated because of metal-metal contact of specimen and transducer are disconnected by adding a couplant between specimen and trans- <b>ducer.</b> We then give suggestions for transducer and couplant selection for vibrothermography and suggest methods to flatten the velocity spectrum of the transducer.

Pea rust (Uromyces pisi) is a {{widespread}} disease of pea (Pisum sativum) worldwide. We previously reported induction of systemic acquired resistance to rust infection in pea by exogenous applications of BTH and BABA based on a reduction of appressorium formation, as well as growth of infection hyphae and haustorium formation. This was related to activation of the phenylpropanoid pathway increasing levels of total phenolic compounds. In this work we attempted to discern by high performance liquid chromatography the particular phenolic compounds involved in reducing rust infection in pea following BABA and BTH induction of resistance. For the experiment we used cv. Messire, susceptible, and PI 347321 characterized with partial resistance to U. pisi no associated with host cell death. Following SAR in <b>ducer</b> application we observed {{an increase in the}} amount of total but a lso in the excreted fraction of coumarins, particularly scopoletin, medicarpin and pisatin although the nature and proportion of the particular coumarins differed between treatments. Interestingly BTH treatment was more actively related with phenolic accumulation than BABA suggest ing differing pathways for the induction of resistance. In addition, exogenous application of scopoletin, medicarpin and pisatin to the leaves lead to a reduction of the different fungal growth stages. Thus, the data suggested that BTH and BABA had an effect on the production and secret ion of particular phytoalexins and other unknown fungitoxic compounds to the leaf surface that hampered pre and post penetration fungal stages. Further studies are being carried out to determine the nature of the unknown phenolic compounds induced by BABA and BTH. Peer Reviewe...|$|E

In {{the present paper}} we examine theoretical relationships between producer and national benefits from levy-funded research, and consider the implications for the appropriate rates of matching government grants, applied {{with a view to}} achieving a closer match between producer and national interests. In many cases the producer and national optima coincide. First, regardless of the form of the supply shift, when product demand is perfectly elastic, or all the prod uct is exported, domestic benefits and costs of levy-funded research all go to pro <b>ducers</b> and they have appropriate incentives. Second, if research causes a parallel supply shift, the producer share of research benefits is the same as their share of costs of a levy, and their incentives are compatible with national interests. In such cases, a matching grant would cause an over-investment in research from a national perspective. However, if demand is less than perfectly elastic, and research causes a pivotal supply shift, the producer share of benefits is smaller than their share of costs of the levy, and they will under-invest in research from a national point of view. A matching grant can be justified in such cases, however the magnitude of the optimal grant is sensitive to market conditions. 1...|$|R
