40|$|Much of {{the current}} {{literature}} relating to events {{that take place in}} the teaching English to speakers of other languages (TESOL) classroom would seem to suggest that activities and tasks follow particular formats, where the linguistic focus of the lesson is introduced, and the students are encouraged to use it themselves in some form of structured interaction, with decreasing levels of teacher support. Skills lessons are reputed to have a slightly different format, perhaps including some inductive or deductive elements, but still basically focus on increasing student independence in a particular area. This paper argues that such an understanding {{of the way in which}} lessons progress has often been based on observed lessons, involving an additional person in the classroom collecting information. However, the Observer's Paradox would seem to suggest that the presence of an observer impacts on what actually <b>happens</b> <b>whilst</b> they are there, therefore such lessons may not, in fact, be a true representation of pedagogic practice in the language classroom. This paper draws on data from classroom transcripts of observed and non‐observed lessons, and analyses them using both external and internal features (self‐evaluation of teacher talk) in order to investigate some of the individual characteristics. It concludes that TESOL interaction and classroom discourse can take many different forms, and that a ‘typical language lesson’ is not typical, although it may be much more common in the context where an observer is present...|$|E
40|$|Abstract This thesis {{focuses on}} the design of {{stereoscopic}} 3 D user interfaces (UIs) for mobile devices. 3 D output is no longer limited to large screens in cinemas or living rooms. Nowadays more and more mobile devices are equipped with autostereoscopic 3 D (S 3 D) touchscreens, which do not require the use of special eyewear to perceive the depth effect. As a consequence, interaction with 3 D content now also <b>happens</b> <b>whilst</b> users are on the move. This thesis presents an empirical study that was carried out to assess how users interact with mobile S 3 D devices, both whilst static and when walking. Following this, the design and implementation of a prototype S 3 D application for indoor navigation is presented. A user study (n= 27) that investigated differences in touch accuracy between 2 D touchscreens and mobile S 3 D touchscreens was carried out. The touch target sizes and aspect ratios required for reliable user interaction in each case were calculated, for example concluding that the increase in minimum touch target size caused by walking is larger for a S 3 D UI than for a 2 D UI. This thesis also identifies differences in the angle at which users held the S 3 D device vs. the 2 D device, and reports on depth perception, both in static and mobile contexts. Following on from the empirical study, a prototype S 3 D indoor navigation application was designed and implemented. Several findings related to visualisation issues in such interfaces are described, e. g. the correct way to use drop shadows as visual cues. This thesis provides valuable information to developers of the next generation of UIs and applications for mobile S 3 D displays and devices...|$|E
40|$|Background and Objectives: In Australia, {{public health}} {{messages}} have {{warned of the}} dangers of excessive UV exposure for more than thirty years, predominantly through promoting increased sun protection and decreased deliberate sun tanning. Research has pushed for increased knowledge of risks, and a reduction in positive attitudes toward tanning. These messages target the reflective, intentional element of behaviour. While this approach has shown some success, it is limited in its ability to be adapted to regions such as North Queensland where comparatively few people intentionally sunbathe. Despite this, the incidence of skin cancer in North Queensland is {{among the highest in the}} world. This would indicate that much of the damage due to UV exposure <b>happens</b> <b>whilst</b> going about normal daily activities - by incidental sun exposure. Incidental exposure is not planned or deliberate, thus theoretical modeling used in research should reflect this. The overall aim of the current study is to adopt a dual-processing framework to examine the psychosocial variables associated with incidental sun exposure. Method: The current study explored perceptions associated with sun related prototypes. Prototypes are social constructs with social consequences. In a sun protection paradigm these are perceptions about the typical person who deliberately suntans, the typical person who protects themselves from the sun, and the typical person who acquires a tan incidentally. Semi-structured interviews were initially conducted as an exploration followed by a survey which sought to identify the specific characteristics of each of the 'prototypes'. Results: Preliminary results indicated that distinct prototypes exist within a sun protection paradigm. Unlike perceptions surrounding incidental tanners and sun protectors, participants held negative perceptions toward the deliberate tanner prototype. Furthermore, individuals tend to align with the incidental prototype - despite engaging in deliberate tanning behaviours. These unrealistic self perceptions may influence whether individuals attend to health promotion messages which aim to reduce deliberate tanning behaviours. Conclusions: Individuals' prototype perceptions may influence not only sun protective behaviours but also attention to health information. Alignment with a 'prototype' that is incongruent with actual behavior, while holding negative perceptions toward the deliberate tanner may polarise individuals and inhibit behavioural change. Thus, current health promotion campaigns may not be applicable to North Queensland and other climates where comparatively few people deliberately tan...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT With {{the global}} economy left in {{shatters}} after {{the events of the}} subprime mortgage crisis, the general public is left looking for answers as to how such a catastrophe could possibly have <b>happened.</b> <b>Whilst</b> the blame does not fall entirely on the banks, their negligent approach to risk management was a major factor. As the world strives to rebuild its economies, a change in attitude is needed by the banks to prevent a repeat of the events that caused the financial crisis. Focusing on the risk disclosures of four UK based banks and one Spanish bank, this dissertation aims to discover whether banks are improving their approach to risk management. This is done through a content analysis of the annual reports straddling a time-line surrounding the financial crisis. The analysis leads to the conclusion that risk attitudes have been improving since the crisis but there is still much room for improvement, especially with regard to liquidity risk management, which was a key factor in the huge capital losses suffered by the banks...|$|R
