500|$|The {{office workers}} are stuck working {{overtime}} {{on a major}} assignment. After asking Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) to confirm {{that he has not}} made any plans for the evening in anticipation of the overtime assignment, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) calls corporate and declares that he is releasing the workers from overtime. Michael then proceeds to invite Jim and his girlfriend Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) to join him and his girlfriend Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin) for dinner at his condominium after Jim had previously turned him down nine times. When Jim begins to formulate an excuse, Michael reminds him that he just said he hadn't made any plans. Jim begins to suspect that Michael fabricated the overtime assignment and the call to corporate just to maneuver him and Pam into coming to dinner. Michael also invites Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) and Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey), but excludes Angela's former boyfriend Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), much to Dwight's dismay. On a tour of the condominium, Jan shows the workspace from which she runs her candle-making <b>home</b> <b>business.</b> Jan's dominance in the relationship is apparent from the living arrangements; Michael sleeps on a small bench due to Jan's [...] "space issues", and his sole comfort is a very small [...] "plasma TV," [...] which he bought for $200. It is also later revealed that Michael underwent three vasectomies in the course of trying to please Jan. Throughout the evening, Jan plays a song by her former assistant, Hunter. Titled [...] "That One Night", the lyrics of the song strongly suggest an intimate encounter once occurred between Jan and Hunter.|$|E

2500|$|Georgia's {{electricity}} generation and consumption {{are among the}} highest in the United States, with natural gas being the primary electrical generation fuel, followed by coal.

2500|$|In May 1997, Paul Bearer {{attempted}} to rejoin The Undertaker, using the ultimatum of revealing The Undertaker's [...] "deepest, darkest secret" [...] to the world. Bearer accused The Undertaker of having burned down the family funeral <b>home</b> <b>business</b> {{when he was}} a child, killing his parents and ostensibly his younger half-brother as well. The Undertaker denied all this; however, Bearer claimed to having proof in the form of The Undertaker's alive and well half-brother Kane, who had survived though horribly scarred and burned. Bearer raised Kane after the fire, having him institutionalized from the date of the fire all the way into adulthood. Ever since the fire, Kane had been awaiting to exact vengeance on his older half-brother. In defense, Undertaker responded that Kane, a pyromaniac, had been the one to set the fire and could not have possibly even survived. Also during the period, Bearer had unintentionally admitted to Undertaker's mother having an affair with him. As a result, it was revealed to The Undertaker that Kane was actually his half-brother. Until that point, Undertaker spent his life (entirety of the father's life) under the impression that Kane was fully related to him and his family. It was during this time that The Undertaker also made an appearance in Michinoku Pro Wrestling, defeating Hakushi in a singles match.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, I don't say {{the flats}} {{are in the}} right of it," [...] said her husband, when she denounced their stupid {{inadequacy}} to the purposes of a Christian home. [...] "But I'm {{not so sure that}} we are, either. I've been thinking about that <b>home</b> <b>business</b> ever since my sensibilities were dragged--in a coupe--through that tenement-house street. Of course, no child born and brought up in such a place as that could have any conception of home. But that's because those poor people can't give character to their habitations. They have to take what they can get. But people like us--that is, of our means--do give character to the average flat. It's made to meet their tastes, or their supposed tastes; and so it's made for social show, not for family life at all. Think of a baby in a flat! It's a contradiction in terms; the flat is the negation of motherhood. The flat means society life; that is, the pretence of social life. It's made to give artificial people a society basis on a little money--too much money, of course, for what they get. So the cost of the building is put into marble halls and idiotic decoration of all kinds. I don't object to the conveniences, but none of these flats has a living-room. They have drawing-rooms to foster social pretence, and they have dining-rooms and bedrooms; but they have no room where the family can all come together and feel the sweetness of being a family. The bedrooms are black-holes mostly, with a sinful waste of space in each. If {{it were not for the}} marble halls, and the decorations, and the foolishly expensive finish, the houses could be built round a court, and the flats could be shaped something like a Pompeiian house, with small sleeping-closets--only lit from the outside--and the rest of the floor thrown into two or three large cheerful halls, where all the family life could go on, and society could be transacted unpretentiously. Why, those tenements are better and humaner than those flats! There the whole family lives in the kitchen, and has its consciousness of being; but the flat abolishes the family consciousness. It's confinement without coziness; it's cluttered without being snug. You couldn't keep a self-respecting cat in a flat; you couldn't go down cellar to get cider. No! the Anglo-Saxon home, as we know it in the Anglo-Saxon house, is simply impossible in the Franco-American flat, not because it's humble, but because it's false." ...|$|E
