After Skip told Lou he wanted to start coaching, Lou put together a list of potential coaches who would give him the best training. The list included Tom Osborne, Joe Paterno, and Terry Donahue, but upon hearing of Skip's interest, Florida State head coach Bobby Bowden said, [...] "if you can be here in two days, I've got a <b>job</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> at Florida State." ...|$|E

5000|$|Sneaker - He {{likes to}} sneak around {{and he takes}} things without asking people, hence why {{he looks like a}} burglar and talks a sneaky tone of voice (which may sound a little like Michael Caine).
