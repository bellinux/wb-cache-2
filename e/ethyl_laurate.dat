Transesterification was strarted by preparing sodium ethoxyde from sodium hydroxyde and ethanol and then mixed {{it with the}} coconut oil: ratio ethanol/oil (1 : 2), stirring speed 500 rpm, 2 % NaOH catalyst concentration, and reaction time of 60 minutes at room temperature. Ethyl ester which was obtained in every treatment was separated, washed and filtered, which was then characterized by GC-MS. Then ethyl ester formed separated using distillation under reduced pressure method based on differences in boiling point. At this stage fractionation by three fractions, namely the fraction 1 ( 170 o C). Each fraction was analyzed composition of {{fatty acid ethyl ester}}s using gas chromatography (GC).

40|$|The {{solid liquid}} {{equilibrium}} diagrams of binary and ternary mixtures formed by dodecylcyclohexane and the fatty acid esters <b>ethyl</b> <b>laurate</b> and ethyl palmitate was determined herein. The liquidus and solidus lines were obtained through differential scanning calorimetry. The thermograms of pure compounds were resolved into the corresponding overlapping peak components by a fitting analysis, allowing a better estimation of phase-change properties of polymorphs. All binary systems show immiscibility in the solid phase, although those containing dodecylcyclohexane present small regions of partial miscibility. The system formed by ethyl palmitate and dodecylcyclohexane presents a peritectic transition, {{which was also}} observed in the ternary system. The thermodynamic modeling was conducted using different models for liquid-phase non-ideality and considering different polymorphs in solid phase. The modeling shows that a probable inversion of polymorphs relative stability occurs for the binary system formed by <b>ethyl</b> <b>laurate</b> and dodecylcyclohexane. The results from this work may contribute to enhancing the understanding and description of the complex behavior of biodiesel/diesel mixtures at low temperatures. (c) 2015 Elsevier B. V.

30|$|Apart from ethyl esters, {{considerable}} methyl esters {{were observed}} in this study (Fig.  2), likely {{to be due to}} the inductive agent (methanol) of the expression system, where the yeast had priority in utilizing methanol in place of ethanol if sufficient methanol was present. In particular, either of the recombinant strain resulted in significantly higher levels of methyl decanoate. Indeed, methyl and ethyl decanoate accounts for 50.4 and 54.2  % of the total volatile aroma esters generated by P. pastoris-EHT 1 and P. pastoris-EEB 1, respectively, indicating a high-availability of decanoyl-CoA as a substrate. Moreover, the two recombinant yeasts both produced methyl nonanoate but not ethyl nonanoate, further indicating the significance of substrate availability. More interestingly, methyl laurate was observed in both strains whereas <b>ethyl</b> <b>laurate</b> was only obtained in P. pastoris-EHT 1. Given the presence of <b>ethyl</b> <b>laurate</b> is relatively low level, it is proposed that the difference between P. pastoris-EHT 1 and P. pastoris-EEB 1 was little. Furthermore, the formation of methyl esters also provides an explanation for the absence of high level ethyl esters in the volatile products. In future research {{it would be interesting to}} compare affinity of both recombinant enzymes for methanol and ethanol using biochemical in vitro tests, which could provide insights on the production of either ethyl or methyl esters.|$|E
40|$|An {{analytical}} procedure for the separation and quantification of ethyl acetate, ethyl butyrate, ethyl hexanoate, ethyl lactate, ethyl octanoate, ethyl nonanoate, ethyl decanoate, isoamyl octanoate, and <b>ethyl</b> <b>laurate</b> in cachaca, rum, and whisky by direct injection gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was developed. The analytical method is simple, selective, and appropriated for {{the determination of}} esters in distilled spirits. The limit of detection ranged from 29 (ethyl hexanoate) to 530 (ethyl acetate) mu g L- 1, whereas the standard deviation for repeatability was between 0. 774 % (ethyl hexanoate) and 5. 05 % (isoamyl octanoate). Relative standard deviation values for accuracy vary from 90. 3 to 98. 5 % for ethyl butyrate and ethyl acetate, respectively. Ethyl acetate was shown to be the major ester in cachaca (median content of 22. 6 mg 100 mL(- 1) anhydrous alcohol), followed by ethyl lactate (median content of 8. 32 mg 100 mL(- 1) anhydrous alcohol). Cachaca produced in copper and hybrid alembic present a higher content of ethyl acetate and ethyl lactate than those produced in a stainless-steel column, whereas cachaca produced by distillation in a stainless-steel column present a higher content of ethyl octanoate, ethyl decanoate, and <b>ethyl</b> <b>laurate.</b> As expected, ethyl acetate is the major ester in whiskey and rum, followed by ethyl lactate for samples of rum.

The results showed {{a relationship between the}} extracts/fractions activities and their flavonoid contents. Moreover, the chloroform extract which was enriched with the aglycone flavonoid isorhamnetin exhibited the highest activities. The activities of N. retusa flavonoids were compared to those of model flavonoids, quercetin, isoquercitrin and rutin. In all cases, the aglycone compounds were more active than their glycosylated derivatives.

Cold stabilisation treatment involved holding of the brandy at - 1 °C during 24 hours. Five depth filter sheets with the nominal retention rate of 0. 3 μm, 0. 5 - 0. 7 μm, 0. 7 - 1. 0 μm, 1. 0 - 2. 0 μm and 2. 5 - 4. 0 μm, were tested in the study. It was shown that all assessed filter sheets were efficient in removing chill haze by significantly reducing the content of fatty acid esters (primarily ethyl palmitate and <b>ethyl</b> <b>laurate).</b> Other volatile and aromatic compounds were not significantly influenced by the applied treatments. However, the filter sheets with higher nominal retention rate (> 0. 7 μm), had a smaller impact on the sensory characteristics of the apricot brandy.

40|$|Static {{secondary}} ion mass spectrometry {{was used to}} study the chemical reactions and lateral distributions of fatty amines, alcohols and esters spin coated onto gold surfaces and commercial aluminium–magnesium (Al–Mg) alloy surfaces, cleaned using UV–ozone. The {{aim of this study}} is to develop an understanding of the interactions of model lubricants with metal surfaces, such as gold and aluminium. This static SIMS study of organic thin films has been able to identify specific reaction products on the aluminium surface for each functional group. This work demonstrates that organic molecules with alcohol, ester and amine functional groups undergo specific chemical reactions with oxidized Al–Mg alloy surfaces. For example, films composed of the fatty alcohol dodecanol were observed to emit monomers, dimers and trimers with discrete distributions. In addition, negative {{secondary ion}} mass spectra indicate that a surface carboxylate is formed from the alcohol. The formation of carboxylate reaction products was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. On Al–Mg alloy surfaces, a direct interaction with the amine and aluminium oxide surface is observed by the detection of a molecular ion that corresponds to the mass of dodecylamine and AlO−, characteristic of aluminium oxide. <b>Ethyl</b> <b>laurate</b> was shown to eliminate the ethyl group, leaving the laurate anion.

40|$|We {{report the}} {{synthesis}} {{of a family of}} gelators in which alkyl chains are connected to the amino groups of L-lysine methyl ester using a range of different hydrogen bonding linking groups (carbamate, amide, urea, thiourea and diacylhydrazine) using simple synthetic methodology based on isocyanate or acid chloride chemistry. The ability of these compounds to gelate organic solvents such as toluene or cyclohexane can be directly related to the ability of the linking group to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds. In general terms, the ability to structure solvents can be considered as: thiourea <carbamate <amide <urea similar to diacylhydrazine. This process has been confirmed by thermal measurements, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and infrared and circular dichroism spectroscopies. By deprotecting the methyl ester group, we have demonstrated that a balance between hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups is essential-if the system has too much hydrophilicity (e. g., diacylhydrazine, urea) it will not form gels due to low solubility in the organic media. However, the less effective gelators based on amide and carbamate linkages are enhanced by converting the methyl ester to a carboxylic acid. Furthermore, subsequent mixing of the acid with a second component (diaminododecane) further enhances the ability to form networks, and, {{in the case of the}} amide, generates a two-component gel, which can immobilise a wide range of solvents of industrial interest including petrol and diesel (fuel oils), olive oil and sunflower oil (renewable food oils) and <b>ethyl</b> <b>laurate,</b> isopropyl myristate and isopropyl palmitate (oils used in pharmaceutical formulation).

30|$|The {{recombinant}} P. pastoris expressing EHT 1 or EEB 1, {{as well as}} P. pastoris containing empty vector (control), were cultivated on brewer’s wort. After 12  h methanol induction, {{formation of}} volatile compounds was assessed by SPME GC–MS analysis. Phenethyl alcohol was detected from all the cell cultures, indicating this compound is an endogenous metabolite derived from P. pastoris yeast itself from wort medium used. Apart from phenethyl alcohol, none of volatile ester compounds was observed from the control strain. For the recombinant strains, production of ethyl esters was observed to increase with the increasing chain length from C 6 to C 10. As shown in Fig.  2, recombinant yeast P. pastoris-EHT 1 produced fatty acid ethyl esters including ethyl hexanoate (C 6), ethyl octanoate (C 8) and ethyl decanoate (C 10), corresponding to 2, 10 and 11  % of total volatiles, respectively. Similarly, during fermentation with the P. pastoris-EEB 1, the levels were 1, 7 and 13  % of total volatiles for ethyl hexanoate (C 6), ethyl octanoate (C 8) and ethyl decanoate (C 10), respectively. In addition, {{it is interesting to}} note that <b>ethyl</b> <b>laurate</b> (C 12) and ethyl myristate (C 14) were produced by P. pastoris-EHT 1, but not by P. pastoris-EEB 1, although they were only present in relatively small quantities.

The larvae stage of this insect {{is the most dangerous}} stage as it is within the pulp of the fruit, making it hard to detect by visual inspection. In most countries at ports of entry the inspector check a small sample of fruit by visual inspection or by cutting the produce and searching for fungus and pests. This paper will investigate a quick, reliable and sensitive method to determine the presence of fruit flies. Our research focuses on developing the technology for detecting hidden infestations by using the Head Space-Soild Phase Micro Extraction (HS-SPME) method coupled with Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrocopy (GC-MS) technique. Five different types of fruit were infested with an early stage of Medfly Ceratitis capitata Wiedemann (Diptera: Tephidae). We investigated to detect the differences in volatile organic compounds (VOC’s) between infested and non- infested fruits by using HS-SPME with (GC-MS). The results indicated that for few chemicals no significant differences between infested and non-infested fruit can be seen, especially in the fruits with first instar. However, in case of third instar larvae infested fruits significant differences in the chemicals can be seen as compare to non infested fruits and other instar infestations.

40|$|Ethanol is {{a poison}} that {{adversely}} affects {{the health of}} individuals and is detrimental to society as a whole. Analysis of ethanol in biological matrices is the most frequent test carried out in forensic toxicology laboratories with application {{across a range of}} cases types including fatalities, road traffic accidents, criminal investigations and workplace drug testing. The interpretation of ethanol concentrations in post mortem samples can be challenging in relation to medico-legal investigations. The source of ethanol can be {{as a result of the}} ingestion of an alcoholic beverage or it may have been formed after death. The stability of alcohol is also adversely affected by the presence of bacteria, high temperatures and unsuitable storage containers. A robust and sensitive method was developed for the analysis of common volatiles such as ethanol, methanol, isopropanol, acetone and n-propanol using headspace gas chromatography coupled with a flame ionization detector (HS-GC-FID). The method was validated in accordance with ISO/IEC 17025, and was used to investigate the stability of volatiles in blood when stored under different conditions, and to investigate the prevalence of volatiles in different biological matrices collected post-mortem. Storage of blood samples in the freezer within sample vials containing preservative and antioxidant improved the stability of all volatiles with the exception of methanol which remained stable under all conditions investigated. The identification of ethanol or acetone in vitreous humour was found to be a suitable alternative matrix in cases where femoral blood was unavailable or ethanol production was suspected. The concentration of ethanol in bile correlated well with femoral blood but to a lesser extent than vitreous humour. Urine was not a suitable matrix for estimating blood ethanol concentrations. Alcohol biomarkers, Beta-Hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) have been reported as useful markers for, investigating the role of alcoholic ketoacidosis (AKA) in post-mortem cases, and foetal exposure to chronic maternal alcohol consumption, respectively. Methods were developed and validated in accordance with ISO/IEC 17025 for BHB in blood and urine using gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (GC/MS), and for FAEEs in meconium by liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). Post-mortem case samples submitted to the Forensic Medicine and Science (FMS) toxicology laboratory for routine tests were analysed for BHB using the validated method. The findings highlighted the importance of measuring BHB in blood in all cases where the deceased has a history of alcohol misuse and where the cause of death cannot be determined following the post-mortem. The role of alcoholic ketoacidosis in the cases analysed in this study was significantly under-reported. Meconium samples collected from infants born at the Princess Royal Maternity Hospital, Glasgow, were analysed for FAEEs, using the validated method to investigate the prevalence of each FAEE (<b>ethyl</b> <b>laurate,</b> ethyl myristate, ethyl palmitate, ethyl stearate, ethyl oleate, ethyl linoleate, ethyl linolenate, and ethyl arachidonate). The study found evidence of chronic maternal alcohol consumption in approximately one third of the cases tested, in contrast to self-reported use and highlights the importance of screening for the presence of FAEEs in meconium. The identification of suitable biomarkers of excessive maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy, carried out as part of screening program, in addition to clinical evaluation would help to diagnose and support newborns with Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). The method developed for the analysis of BHB in blood and urine was successfully adapted and validated for analysis of structurally similar drugs such as Beta-hydroxy-Beta-methylbutyrate (HMB), a legal dietary supplement, in plasma and urine collected from 8 subjects, pre- and post-administration of a 3 g dose of HMB.
