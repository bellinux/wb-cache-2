500|$|Upon its publication, The Shortest Way {{provoked}} {{immediate and}} passionate reactions {{from both sides}} of the debate. Some made use of it as a genuine vindication of the anti-Dissenter opinion, although speculation later occurred over whether it was ironic. The pamphlet generated a great deal of publicity over the handling of the issue by the Tory ministry. This resulted in the issuing of a warrant by the High Tory Secretary of State for the Southern Department, the Earl of Nottingham, for the arrest of Defoe on the charge of seditious libel, the order being given to [...] "… make Strict and diligent Search for Daniel Fooe and him having <b>found</b> <b>you</b> are to apprehend and seize together with his Papers for high Crime and misdemeanours and to bring him before me …" ...|$|E

500|$|The second side of {{the album}} begins with [...] "Bloody Mary Morning", with the male narrator {{ordering}} drinks on a flight from Los Angeles, California to Houston, Texas after his wife unexpectedly left him, with [...] "the smog and haze reminding me of how I feel". In [...] "Phases and Stages/No Love Around" [...] he recalls dragging in at sunrise after another night of carousing: [...] "I come home last Saturday morning, I come home and <b>found</b> <b>you</b> gone." [...] In the sad [...] "I Still Can't Believe You're Gone", [...] the man realizes the vast impact on his life of her leaving. [...] "It's Not Supposed to Be That Way" [...] reflects his inability to accept the situation and his grief, but still in a self-centered way. In [...] "Heaven and Hell", the man expresses his ambivalence about living without his wife, with the lyric: [...] "Sometimes it's heaven, sometimes it's hell, and sometimes I don't even know." [...] The final track is [...] "Phases and Stages/Pick Up the Tempo/Phases and Stages", in which the man reveals his inability to change his character, and accepts his nature and its consequences.|$|E

500|$|Presiding {{over the}} trial was Sir William Chapple, a senior and {{respected}} judge in his early sixties. [...] The prosecution was directed by King's Counsel Thomas Place and Richard Crowle (brother of George), and proceedings were recorded by a York resident, Thomas Kyll. [...] Turpin had no defence barrister; {{during this period of}} English history, those accused had no right to legal representation, and their interests were cared for by the presiding judge. [...] Among the seven witnesses called to testify were Thomas Creasy, and James Smith, the man who had recognised Turpin's handwriting. [...] Turpin offered {{little in the way of}} questioning his accusers; when asked if he had anything to ask of Creasy, he replied [...] "I cannot say anything, for I have not any witnesses come this day, as I have expected, and therefore beg of your Lordship to put off my trial 'till another day", and when asked about Smith, he claimed not to know him. [...] When questioned himself, Turpin told the court that he had bought the mare and foal from an inn-keeper near Heckington. [...] He repeated his original story of how he had come to use the pseudonym Palmer, claiming that it was his mother's maiden name. [...] When asked by the judge for his name before he came to Lincolnshire, he said [...] "Turpin". [...] Without leaving the courtroom the jury found Turpin guilty of the first charge of stealing the mare and foal, and following further proceedings, guilty of stealing the gelding. [...] Throughout the trial Turpin had repeatedly claimed that he had not been allowed enough time to form his defence, that proceedings should be delayed until he could call his witnesses, and that the trial should be held at Essex. [...] Before sentencing him, the judge asked Turpin if he could offer any reason why he should not be sentenced to death; Turpin said: [...] "It is very hard upon me, my Lord, because I was not prepar'd for my Defence." [...] The judge replied: [...] "Why was you not? [...] You knew the Time of the Assizes as well as any Person here." [...] Despite Turpin's pleas that he had been told the trial would be held in Essex, the judge replied: [...] "Whoever told you so were highly to blame; and as your country have <b>found</b> <b>you</b> guilty of a crime worthy of death, it is my office to pronounce sentence against you", sentencing him to death.|$|E

2500|$|Born {{and brought}} up in Belfast, Best began his club career in England with Manchester United, with the scout who had spotted his talent {{at the age of}} 15 sending a {{telegram}} to manager Matt Busby which read: [...] "I think I've <b>found</b> <b>you</b> a genius."

2500|$|El-Faisal {{was sentenced}} on 7 March 2003 to {{nine years in}} prison. He {{received}} seven years for soliciting murder, 12 months to run concurrently for using threatening words with intent to stir up racial hatred, and a further two years (to run consecutively) for distributing threatening recordings with intent to stir up racial hatred. Old Bailey judge Peter Beaumont delivered the sentence. He said el-Faisal had [...] "fanned the flames of hostility", and told him: [...] "As the jury <b>found,</b> <b>you</b> not only preached hate, but the words you uttered in those meetings were recorded to reach a wider audience. You urged those who listened and watched to kill {{those who did not}} share your faith." [...] The judge suggested that el-Faisal serve at least half his sentence, and then be deported.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the age of}} 15, Best was {{discovered}} in Belfast by Manchester United scout Bob Bishop, whose telegram to United manager Matt Busby read: [...] "I think I've <b>found</b> <b>you</b> a genius." [...] His local club Glentoran had previously rejected him for being [...] "too small and light". Best was subsequently given a trial and signed up by United's chief scout Joe Armstrong. His first time moving to the club, Best quickly became homesick and stayed for only two days before going back home to Northern Ireland. He returned to Manchester and spent two years as an amateur, as English clubs {{were not allowed to}} take Northern Irish players on as apprentices. He was given a job as an errand boy on the Manchester Ship Canal, allowing him to train with the club twice a week.|$|E
2500|$|The government's {{increasingly}} hardline {{approach to}} civil liberties prompted Queensland National Party president Robert Sparkes {{to warn the}} party that it was developing a dangerous [...] "propaganda-created" [...] ultra-conservative, almost fascist image. He told a party conference: [...] "We must studiously avoid any statements or actions which suggest an extreme right-wing posture." [...] Bjelke-Petersen ignored the advice. He condemned the use of Australian foreign aid to prop up communist regimes, urged Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser to stop criticising the governments of South Africa and Rhodesia and from 1977 proposed Queensland secede from Australia and establish its own currency. [...] He also accused political opponents of being covert communists bent on anarchy, observing: [...] "I have always <b>found...</b> <b>you</b> can campaign on anything you like but nothing {{is more effective than}} communism...

I felt good crying in your presence." [...] Alain Delon told Truffaut that [...] "The Green Room, along with Clément, Visconti and very few others, is part of my secret garden." [...] Éric Rohmer told him that [...] "I found your film deeply moving. I <b>found</b> <b>you</b> deeply moving in your film."

[...] For the next hour, she paced or sat nervously in an adjoining room with Frank holding her hands, weeping, and praying. [...] Goodale, who had kept track of the disappearance in the papers, made this statement to police: [...] "The body appears to have been in the water for about a month, which would tally with the date of Elsie Paroubek's disappearance. The child, when she left home, was without hat, and her clothing tallies in every respect with that found on the dead body. There was no ring or other ornament, and in that respect, the descriptions correspond.

2500|$|Her autobiography, , was {{published}} during July 2003 by HarperCollins. In the book, Lords chronicled her childhood, career and mostly her {{past in the}} porno movie industry. The book received positive reviews from critics and was a commercial success making The New York Times Best Seller list. It was criticized by porno movie industry insiders. In the book, Lords revealed that she received only $35,000 as total compensation for all her porno movies, including the $5,000 for her underage appearance in Penthouse. Lords continued to use the now famous stage name that she had given herself as a minor, and ultimately made it her legal name. She explained, [...] "I chose to stop running from it. Instead, I won it, legally changing my name to Traci Elizabeth Lords. That's who I was, and that's who I was going to be."

2500|$|After {{the debacle}} of the Katt affair in 1730, the Crown Prince lived in virtual house arrest in Rheinsberg; by 1733, after visiting his {{recalcitrant}} son, Frederick William eased {{the restrictions on}} the prince's life, and sent him on the Imperial military campaign in the Rhineland. Bredow was assigned by Frederick William I to teach the Crown Prince [...] "order and economy" [...] (Ordung und Haushaltung). [...] He was not only an [...] "observer", assigned to watch over the prince and report back to the king any problems, and presumably to report back to the king, Bredow developed a good mentoring relationship with Frederick. He stayed with the Crown Prince from early 1734 through December, when Frederick returned to Berlin. Bredow traveled between the front, Berlin, and Bayreuth several times. In February of that year, Frederick wrote to his sister: [...] "Captain Bredow has scared us all so much, especially me, {{when he said he}} <b>found</b> <b>you</b> so altered he did not recognize you and that you would not eat anything." ...|$|E

She was last seen wearing grey tracksuit bottoms, a white, long sleeved T-shirt and black Nike trainers... We will interview friends, her boyfriend and all her associates." [...] Ross Hemphill, who hadn't seen Nelson {{on the day of the}} murder, was interviewed by detectives and ruled out as a suspect. Police began checking CCTV and telephone records as well as interviewing friends and family and carrying out house-to-house enquiries. Witnesses reported seeing a fire on Monkey Hill at around 11.20pm on the night of the murder. D/Supt Robertson said: [...] "We know there was a fire at 11.20pm on Saturday in exactly the spot where Zoe was <b>found.</b> <b>You</b> would need local knowledge to go there. We firmly believe the answers in this case lie in this community... It had only got dark at 10pm and it was the hottest day of the year so there must have been people around this area." ...|$|E
2500|$|Yoakum {{reportedly}} had {{his followers}} distribute nickels to indigents on skid row, a sum {{that would permit}} them to ride the train to the station near Pisgah Home. [...] As the crowds of [...] "down and outs" [...] continued to come to Pisgah Home, the movement drew the enmity of neighbors. [...] And indeed, Yoakum's flock {{was the source of}} some crime in the area. [...] In 1912, two of the [...] "inmates" [...] from Pisgah Home were arrested for the attempted robbery of a safe at a nearby business. [...] In 1913, Halstead [...] "Billy" [...] Stiles, claiming to be a reformed gunslinger who was part of the James-Younger Gang when it attempted the Northfield, Minnesota bank robbery, moved into the Pisgah Home. [...] Stiles' story was published in the Pisgah publication (with a reported circulation of 100,000), in which he wrote: [...] "My soul was black with many a crime, but he Lord took me and washed me as white as wool. [...] I was not reformed, but transformed." [...] Later still, a large crowd assembled when boxing champion and accused murderer Kid McCoy (the man for whom the expression the [...] "real McCoy" [...] was coined) came to Pisgah Home [...] "under heavy guard" [...] to visit his mother, a resident. [...] Other problems included elderly inmates wandering off in a [...] "dazed condition" [...] from the home.
