40|$|Coastal {{communities}} in the southeast United States have regularly experienced severe hurricane impacts. To better facilitate recovery efforts in these communities following natural disasters, {{state and federal agencies}} must respond quickly with information regarding the extent and severity of hurricane damage and the amount of tree debris volume. A tool was developed to detect <b>downed</b> <b>trees</b> and debris volume to better aid disaster response efforts and tree debris removal. The tool estimates <b>downed</b> <b>tree</b> debris volume in hurricane affected urban areas using a Leica Airborne Digital Sensor (ADS 40) and very high resolution digital images. The tool employs a Sobel edge detection algorithm combined with spectral information based on color filtering using 15 different statistical combinations of spectral bands. The algorithm identified <b>downed</b> <b>tree</b> edges based on contrasts between tree stems, grass, and asphalt and color filtering was then used to establish threshold values. Colors outside these threshold values were replaced and excluded from the detection processes. Results were overlaid and an “edge line” was placed where lines or edges from longer consecutive segments and color values within the threshold were met. Where two lines were paired within a very short distance in the scene a polygon was drawn automatically and, in doing so, <b>downed</b> <b>tree</b> stems were detected. Tree stem diameter–volume bulking factors were used to estimate post-hurricane tree debris volumes. Images following Hurricane Ivan in 2005 and Hurricane Ike in 2008 were used to assess the error of the tool by comparing <b>downed</b> <b>tree</b> counts and subsequent debris volume estimates with post-hurricane photo-interpreted <b>downed</b> <b>tree</b> counts and actual field measured estimates of <b>downed</b> <b>tree</b> debris volume. The errors {{associated with the use of}} the tool and potential applications are also presented. JRC. H. 5 -Land Resources Managemen...|$|R

5|$|Aletta {{produced}} moderate rainfall across Mexico, {{including a}} 24-hour rainfall total of 100.2mm (3.94inches) in Jacatepec, Oaxaca on May30, and 96.0mm (3.78inches) in La Calera, Guerrero, the next day. High winds knocked <b>down</b> <b>trees</b> and caused minor structural damage. In Zihuatanejo, a ship with nine people was rescued after being reported as lost, {{which may have}} been a result of high seas generated by Aletta. However, there were no reports of fatalities associated with Aletta.|$|E
5|$|As a {{tropical}} cyclone, Paine brought rainfall {{to most of}} Mexico, including heavier amounts along the coastline and interior northern Oaxaca. The highest total in the country was 12.01inches (30.5cm) in Apazulco, Jalisco. Light precipitation fell in the southern portion of the Baja California Peninsula, and where Paine moved ashore, upwards of 7inches (18cm) fell across its path. In the area around where it made landfall, strong winds knocked <b>down</b> <b>trees</b> and caused disruptions to city services.|$|E
50|$|On June 13, 1989, a Loch Ness train {{collided}} with a <b>downed</b> <b>tree.</b> Just after two trains had left the station, operators learned of a rapidly approaching storm and began shutting down the ride, unaware of a <b>downed</b> <b>tree</b> crossing the tracks.

5|$|As an extratropical cyclone, Charley brought heavy {{rainfall}} and strong winds to Ireland and the United Kingdom, causing at least 11deaths. In Ireland, the rainfall set records for 24-hour totals, including {{an accumulation of}} more than 7.8in (200mm) which set {{the record for the}} greatest daily rainfall total in the country. In the country, the rainfall caused widespread flooding, causing two rivers to exceed their banks. In the Dublin area, 451buildings were flooded, some up to a depth of 8ft (2.4m). In the United Kingdom, the storm flooded rivers and brought <b>down</b> <b>trees</b> and power lines.|$|E
5|$|Beavers, rodents {{weighing}} up to , have sometimes caused problems along Fanno Creek. In 2014 and 2015, a growing population of beavers gnawed <b>down</b> <b>trees</b> and dammed the creek in Greenway Park in Beaverton. Rising waters have covered {{one of the}} side trails in the park, which has been gated and closed. During heavy rains, water from the beaver pond sometimes covers the main trail. Park officials are considering a variety of options, including re-routing the trails, building a boardwalk over the water, or removing the beaver dams.|$|E
5|$|High winds from Jimena knocked <b>down</b> <b>trees</b> {{and damaged}} power lines, leaving 1,300 {{residents}} without electricity. Heavy rainfall {{from the storm}} also caused minor flooding {{on the eastern side}} of the Big Island. Offshore, high surf and strong currents brought by the storm resulted in 350 swimmers being rescued by the United States Coast Guard, residents, and state and local police and fire departments. Overall there were no fatalities or injuries from Hurricane Jimena. The name Jimena was not retired by the World Meteorological Organization in the spring of 2004 and was used in the 2009 season.|$|E

5|$|Wind gusts reached 60mph (95km/h) {{in northeastern}} Pennsylvania, {{resulting}} in scattered reports of <b>downed</b> <b>trees</b> and power lines. Tens of thousands were left without power. A few <b>downed</b> <b>trees</b> hit cars and houses, with damage totaling about $350,000 (2003USD, $410,000 in 2008USD). The fallen trees also closed some roads. In the central {{portion of the}} state, the storm dropped moderate precipitation of over 3inches (75mm), while wind gusts reached 73mph (117km/h) at a station in Lancaster County. The combination of the wind gusts and moist grounds from previous rainfalls resulted in hundreds of <b>downed</b> <b>tree</b> limbs, primarily in Dauphin and Lancaster Counties. Lancaster County reportedly suffered the worst wind damage since Hurricane Hazel in 1954.|$|R
5|$|In two months, Cornelius and his 200 men cut <b>down</b> <b>trees,</b> {{burned down}} {{vegetation}} and dug away {{the earth to}} reveal the monument.
