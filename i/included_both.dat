Intuitively, {{the value of}} an integrated roughness measure that <b>includes</b> <b>both</b> types of uncertainty should be larger than that of a measure that considers only one type of uncertainty. However, rough entropy does not satisfy this requirement: although rough entropy <b>includes</b> <b>both</b> types of uncertainty, the numerical values can be smaller than those of the knowledge uncertainty measure, as shown in Table  1.|$|R
