It runs on eAdventure game engine and it is designed for students of second triennium in elementary schools. The game's main goal is to strengthen students' algorithmic thinking, approaching programming concept of one and two <b>dimensional</b> <b>arrays</b> to students and connecting these concepts with real life forms of arrays. Since the elementary school curriculum does not include distinctly programming courses, the game can be used as part of computer literacy course or extracurricular computer science activities. Oto's index provides the player with appropriate challenges and motivates him via feedback to achieve set educational goals. Players do not need any special prior knowledge to play and the game itself is designed to be simple and understandable for use. It runs in a single player mode and each player has an option of advancing at his own tempo. The main content goal is the care for a dog called Oto, who represents the key motivation for solving problems inside the game. With successful completion of tasks, the player collects different goods for his Oto and thus increases Oto's satisfaction.

40|$|Data Decomposition {{involves}} the mapping of array elements to processors of a Distributed Memory Machine {{with the goal}} to obtain the best possible performance of a program by keeping communication costs low while exploiting parallelism. Data decomposition is typically divided into two subproblems: alignment and partitioning. Alignment deals with the relative allocation of different arrays. Partitioning {{is concerned with the}} actual distribution of the array elements among processors. Conflicting alignments may cause communication. This paper presents a technique for reducing communication by honoring multiple alignments and applies this approach in a distributed memory implementation of the strict functional language Sisal. Multiple alignment leads to recomputation and replication of array elements, which is safe in a functional, and hence side effect free, setting. We present performance improvements of up to 80 % for one <b>dimensional</b> <b>arrays,</b> and up to 50 % for two <b>dimensional</b> <b>arrays,</b> comp [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|A manual {{subjective}} test is implemented {{to determine the}} MRTD. An operator uses a series of 4-bar targets of different spatial frequencies.

[...] The positive and negative temperature differences are stored into a two <b>dimensional</b> <b>array.</b> The corresponding spatial frequencies used in each test are also stored into an array. The MRTD curve is a plot of these arrays (just resolvable temperature difference versus target spatial frequency). From the experimental MRTD data, a general polynomial best fit is calculated {{and the result is}} the MRTD curve which gives direct insight into the quality of the image. i.e. the infrared camera's ability to resolve detail, in this case temperature.|$|E
5000|$|One theory, {{addressed}} as the [...] "isomorphic filling-in theory" [...] {{according to the}} definition of Von der Heydt, Friedman et al. (2003), postulates that perception is based on an image representation held in a two <b>dimensional</b> <b>array</b> of neurons, typically arranged retinotopically, in which colour signals spread in all directions except across borders formed by contour activity. The process is thought to be analogous to physical diffusion, with contours acting as diffusion barriers for the colour and brightness signals. An alternative hypothesis is that image information is transformed at the cortical level into an oriented feature representation. Form and colour would be derived at a subsequent stage, not as the result of an isomorphic filling-in process, but as an attribute of an object or proto-object. This theory is called the symbolic filling-in theory.|$|E
50|$|In {{considering}} {{the transition from}} the text being presented by the computer to the user moving a camera across a printed page, Bliss realized that there was a critical flaw {{in the design of the}} Veteran Administration Stereotoner. Since English alphabetic characters can be adequately displayed with 12 vertical pixels, the Stereotoner designer had assumed that only 12 photocells would be needed in the camera. However, this assumes perfect alignment between the camera and the printed text, which is never the case with a hand held camera. When the alignment is random, as with a hand held camera, a well known engineering theorem states that twice as many pixels are needed. Therefore, the Optacon was designed with 24 vertical pixels instead of 12. This theorem isn’t applicable in the horizontal dimension, so the columns in a two <b>dimensional</b> <b>array</b> can be twice as far apart as the rows.|$|E

5000|$|After {{spending}} {{a short period}} of time dabbling in professional audio, Polk Audio turned its attention to high end home audio. With the release of the first successful model in 1974, the Monitor 7, Polk Audio started to become a recognized name in audiophile circles. Polk used a two way configuration on the vast majority of its speakers like the popular Monitor 10 and Monitor 12, typically with high performance 6.5" [...] mid/bass drivers with rubber surrounds and passive radiators. The Monitor 12 was quite capable for its day, having bass response to 18 Hz, a free-air mounted tweeter and 500 watt RMS power handling. Later Polk speaker models used arrays of drivers, called SDA for Stereo <b>Dimensional</b> <b>Array,</b> to modify the crosstalk from the left speaker to the right ear and from the right speaker to the left ear, so as to expand the stereo image beyond the space between two stereo speakers. The SDA concept is still used in some current Polk branded speaker products. Polk has also ventured into automobile speakers.|$|E
