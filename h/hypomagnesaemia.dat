40|$|BACKGROUND: Magnesium (Mg(2 +)) is an {{essential}} ion for cell growth, neuroplasticity and muscle contraction. Blood Mg(2 +) levels < 0. 7 mmol/L may cause a heterogeneous clinical phenotype, including muscle cramps and epilepsy and disturbances in K(+) and Ca(2 +) homeostasis. Over the last decade, the genetic origin of several familial forms of <b>hypomagnesaemia</b> has been found. In 2000, mutations in FXYD 2, encoding the gamma-subunit of the Na(+) -K(+) -ATPase, were identified to cause isolated dominant <b>hypomagnesaemia</b> (IDH) in a large Dutch family suffering from <b>hypomagnesaemia,</b> hypocalciuria and chondrocalcinosis. However, no additional patients have been identified since then. METHODS: Here, two families with <b>hypomagnesaemia</b> and hypocalciuria were screened for mutations in the FXYD 2 gene. Moreover, the patients were clinically and genetically characterized. RESULTS: We report a p. Gly 41 Arg FXYD 2 mutation in two families with <b>hypomagnesaemia</b> and hypocalciuria. Interestingly, {{this is the same}} mutation as was described in the original study. As in the initial family, several patients suffered from muscle cramps, chondrocalcinosis and epilepsy. Haplotype analysis revealed an overlapping haplotype in all families, suggesting a founder effect. CONCLUSIONS: The recurrent p. Gly 41 Arg FXYD 2 mutation in two new families with IDH confirms that FXYD 2 mutation causes <b>hypomagnesaemia.</b> Until now, no other FXYD 2 mutations have been reported which could indicate that other FXYD 2 mutations will not cause <b>hypomagnesaemia</b> or are embryonically lethal...|$|E
40|$|Gitelman {{syndrome}} is an inherited tubulopathy {{leading to a}} hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis with <b>hypomagnesaemia</b> and hypocalciuria.

Chronic <b>hypomagnesaemia</b> can lead to chondrocalcinosis, which often affects knees but can affect other joints. Here we present a case of Gitelman syndrome complicated by cervical chondrocalcinosis leading to neck pain and numbness of the fingers.

40|$|Abstract. Over {{recent decades}} {{there have been}} several papers that {{documented}} hypomagnesaemia*, in cancer patients treated, with cisplatin, with combined che-motherapies and more recently, with cetuximab an antibody against the epidermal growth factor receptor. Recently, however, the clinical read-out of cetuximab-induced <b>hypomagnesaemia</b> has received different interpretations. Some reports called the readers ’ attention to the importance of magnesium supplementation in relieving patient’s discomfort or preventing the most severe complications of <b>hypomagnesaemia.</b> Other reports claimed that magnesium deficiency could con-tribute to the oncologic efficacy of cetuximab. This latter interpretation implies that the decision on magnesium supplementation should consider {{the pros and cons of}} returning magnesium to normal levels. Given that decreased magnesium availability inhibits cell proliferation, <b>hypomagnesaemia</b> may slow down tumor growth. Unfortunately, one view does not fit all.

40|$|Currently, {{targeted}} anti-epidermal {{growth factor}} receptor (EGFR) agents {{have an important}} role in the treatment of various cancers. These drugs, particularly anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies, may induce electrolyte disorders, such as <b>hypomagnesaemia</b> and hypocalcaemia. Early symptoms of magnesium deficiency can easily go unrecognized. However, <b>hypomagnesaemia</b> can in rare cases lead to serious clinical manifestations, including cardiac arrhythmias or convulsions. The elective tubular expression of renal EGF/EGFR explains the mechanism of this class-related drug side effect. Inhibition of the EGFR induces a mutated-like transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily M, member 6 (TRPM 6) syndrome, characterized by urinary magnesium and calcium wasting. The risk of <b>hypomagnesaemia</b> is associated with treatment duration. It is a reversible toxicity; the recovery of magnesium serum levels is usually seen 4 - 6  weeks of stopping the anti-EGFR antibody.
