50|$|Similarly to {{the ratio}} <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> falling to altitude, the number <b>of</b> <b>days</b> in which <b>snow</b> settles {{on the ground}} {{increases}} by five days per every 100 m increase in altitude. In the south-west, it is rare that snow settles on the ground. From 1979 to 2000 on average, lowland areas did not record any <b>lying</b> <b>snow</b> in {{one out of every}} three years. During this period, snow settled, on average, fewer than three days per year across the Isles of Scilly and on the coasts of Devon and Cornwall. Inland areas had an average <b>of</b> 5-10 <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> <b>lying</b> per year and, as with the <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> falling; this was higher towards the north-east of the region. More than 20 <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> <b>lying</b> can be expected on the high grounds of Dartmoor and Exmoor.|$|R
5|$|Birmingham is a snowy city {{relative}} to other large UK conurbations, due to its inland location and comparatively high elevation. Between 1961 and 1990 Birmingham Airport averaged 13.0 <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> <b>lying</b> annually, compared to 5.33 at London Heathrow. Snow showers often pass through the city via the Cheshire gap on north westerly airstreams, but can also come off the North Sea from north easterly airstreams.|$|R

50|$|Severe {{cold weather}} is {{uncommon}} in Ireland {{with the majority}} of winter precipitation coming in the form of rain, although hills and mountainous regions in the country can commonly see up to 30 <b>days</b> <b>of</b> snowfall annually, with the Wicklow Mountains sometimes seeing 50 or more <b>days</b> <b>of</b> snowfall annually.

500|$|The west of Scotland {{is usually}} warmer than the east, {{owing to the}} {{influence}} of Atlantic ocean currents and the colder surface temperatures of the North Sea. Tiree, in the Inner Hebrides, is one of the sunniest places in the country: it had more than 300 hours of sunshine in May 1975. Rainfall varies widely across Scotland. The western highlands of Scotland are the wettest, with annual rainfall in a few places exceeding [...] In comparison, much of lowland Scotland receives less than [...] annually. Heavy snowfall is not common in the lowlands, but becomes more common with altitude. Braemar has an average <b>of</b> 59 <b>snow</b> <b>days</b> per year, while many coastal areas average fewer than 10 <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>lying</b> <b>snow</b> per year.|$|R
50|$|The snowiest {{weather station}} is Clones, County Monaghan, which receives, on average, nearly 30 <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> and/or sleet per year. <b>Of</b> these, 10.8 <b>days</b> have <b>snow</b> <b>lying</b> at 09:00. The least snowy weather station is Valentia Island, County Kerry; which receives, on average, 5.6 <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> and/or sleet per year. <b>Of</b> these, 0.8 <b>days</b> have <b>snow</b> <b>lying</b> at 09:00.|$|R

50|$|Whilst E. coccifera is {{considered}} fairly frost-hardy, rare extreme frost events {{are thought to}} be one of the principle determinants of subalpine species distribution. Similarly, the duration <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> <b>lie</b> dictates, to a large extent, the species that can persist in alpine/sub-alpine habitats. As <b>snow</b> <b>lie</b> in Tasmania is not permanent, woody species such as E. coccifera and its underlying shrub population can persist at higher altitudes.|$|R
50|$|In the {{south-west}} {{the number}} <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> snowfall increases with altitude: per approximately every 100 m increase in altitude, the number <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> falling increases by five days. From 1979 to 2000, on average {{there were fewer}} than 10 days per winter in which snow fell in the islands of the south-west and the coastal areas of Devon and Cornwall, and slightly more than 10 days on average near to the Severn Estuary. Inland areas received between 8-15 <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> falling; more <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> fall were noted particularly to the north-east. Some upland areas received, on average, over 25 <b>days</b> per year <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> falling.|$|R

Many of the largest historical floods were caused by snowmelt, but the last such episode occurred when the bitter winter of 1946-7 was followed by a rapid thaw due to rain in March 1947 and caused severe flooding all along the Trent valley.|$|R
50|$|The hut's mode of {{construction}} and dimensions {{are similar to}} that of the Romney hut, as was its purpose. Both were used to accommodate facilities for which abnormal roof spans were required. On some airfields, two or more Romney or Iris huts would be erected to accommodate large stores and workshops. However, the Iris hut had a major design flaw; it was unable to resist the weight <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> <b>lying</b> on the roof and had a tendency to collapse after snowfalls. For this reason, it was superseded by the Romney hut by 1941.|$|R
60|$|The {{head of the}} lake--that is, {{the eastern}} end of it--is {{surrounded}} with mountains, the slopes of which seem to rise very abruptly from the water, and ascend to such a height that patches <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> <b>lie</b> on the summits of them all the summer.
