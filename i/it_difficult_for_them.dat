5|$|Sponges are {{worldwide}} in their distribution, {{living in a}} wide range of ocean habitats, from the polar regions to the tropics. Most live in quiet, clear waters, because sediment stirred up by waves or currents would block their pores, making <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to feed and breathe. The greatest numbers of sponges are usually found on firm surfaces such as rocks, but some sponges can attach themselves to soft sediment by means of a root-like base.|$|E
5|$|According to {{traditional}} gender roles in Malawi, men operate {{primarily in the}} formal work sector and are responsible for supporting their families through paid labor, whereas women, who are valued for their domestic skills, are responsible for agricultural labor and care work; this gender-based division of labor decreases women's autonomy, thereby increasing their vulnerability to HIV/AIDS. Even within the home, women often lack bargaining power because they have limited access to education, formal employment, and other resources that could give {{them a sense of}} financial and personal independence. Women who are able to work in the formal sector typically earn significantly less money than men, even when they are completing the same tasks, making <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to elevate their status.|$|E
5|$|Polygamy is common, with 39% {{of women}} living in such unions. This is sanctioned by law, which {{automatically}} permits polygamy unless spouses specify that this is unacceptable upon marriage. Although violence against women is prohibited, domestic violence is common. Female genital mutilation is also prohibited, but the practice is widespread and deeply rooted in tradition; 45% of Chadian women undergo the procedure, with the highest rates among Arabs, Hadjarai, and Ouaddaians (90% or more). Lower percentages were reported among the Sara (38%) and the Toubou (2%). Women lack equal opportunities in education and training, making <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> {{to compete for the}} relatively few formal-sector jobs. Although property and inheritance laws based on the French code do not discriminate against women, local leaders adjudicate most inheritance cases in favour of men, according to traditional practice.|$|E

5|$|The airline {{reached a}} non-public {{settlement}} with Thor Tjøntveit on 10 September regarding the latter's right to purchase one of Norway Airline's aircraft. Norway Airlines lost NOK12 million in 1990. In January 1991, the airline won {{the contract to}} fly personnel the Norwegian Armed Forces, as the airline priced half a million krone lower than Busy Bee. Operations started in April and secured sufficient business that the airline could order its third aircraft, along with a contract from Gullivers Reiser for additional charter flights. Within a week it received concession to operate scheduled flights between Oslo, Copenhagen and Stockholm to London. A similar concession was also granted to Braathens SAFE, but they stated that the intense competition on the route would make <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to start a service. However, the five-year concession required that Norway Airlines not have any foreign citizens in the board; as two representatives for ILG sat on the board, {{they would have to}} resign for the concession to be valid. The Progress Party called for the law to be changed. Norway Airlines also applied for a route from Bergen and Stavanger to London.|$|E
5|$|The {{only way}} Germany could acquire {{large numbers of}} horses after the war began was by conquest. More than 375,000horses were taken from German-occupied French {{territory}} {{for use by the}} German military. Captured Ukrainian territory provided another 140,000. The Ardennes was used to pull artillery for the French and Belgian armies. Their calm, tolerant disposition, combined with their active and flexible nature, made them an ideal artillery horse. The breed was considered so useful and valuable that when the Germans established the Commission for the Purchase of Horses in October 1914 to capture Belgian horses, the Ardennes was one of two breeds specified as important, the other being the Brabant. The Germans were not able to capture the horses belonging to the Belgian royal family, as they were successfully evacuated, although they captured enough horses to disrupt Belgian agriculture and breeding programs. Horses used for the transport of goods were also taken, resulting in a fuel crisis in Belgium the next winter as there were no horses to pull coal wagons. The Germans sold some of their captured horses at auction. Prevented by the Allies from importing remounts, the Germans ultimately ran out of horses, making <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to move supplies and artillery, a factor contributing to their defeat.|$|E

For this reason, it's necessary that some program should be developed to connect those men with the small and medium-sized enterprises. In addition, this program should be developed to be able to analyze and diagnose whether the men meet the standards that the enterprises require.

25|$|A bouncer is a ball {{aimed to}} pitch {{in the first half}} of the pitch, meaning it has had time to rise sharply to chest or head height by the time it reaches the batsman. This causes two {{problems}} for the batsman who receives the ball. If he or she attempts to play it, their bat will be at eye-level making <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to watch the ball onto the bat and time their shot correctly. If he or she leaves or misses the ball, it may strike him or her a painful blow on the head or chest and occasionally result in injury.

25|$|Football {{was adopted}} {{by a number of}} public schools as a way of {{encouraging}} competitiveness and keeping youths fit. Each school drafted its own rules, which varied widely between different schools and were changed over time with each new intake of pupils. Two schools of thought developed regarding rules. Some schools favoured a game in which the ball could be carried (as at Rugby, Marlborough and Cheltenham), while others preferred a game where kicking and dribbling the ball was promoted (as at Eton, Harrow, Westminster and Charterhouse). The division into these two camps was partly the result of circumstances in which the games were played. For example, Charterhouse and Westminster at the time had restricted playing areas; the boys were confined to playing their ball game within the school cloisters, making <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to adopt rough and tumble running games.|$|E

25|$|Props {{have to take}} in {{pressure}} from the locks and loose forwards pushing from behind and the opposition pushing against them, so they are often among the strongest players in a team. Some of the more successful props have short necks and broad shoulders to absorb this force as well as powerful legs to drive the scrum forward. Since the game has become professional, non-specialist props or hookers cannot play in the front row. If, through sendings-off or injuries, a team {{does not have enough}} specialist front row players, the scrums become 'uncontested' (i.e. no pushing is allowed and the team putting the ball into the scrum wins it). On their own scrum, the loosehead's role is to provide the hooker with a clear view to strike the ball, while the tighthead tries to keep the scrum stable. When the opposition is putting the ball in, the tighthead attempts to disrupt the opposing hooker or loosehead, making <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to win the ball.|$|E
