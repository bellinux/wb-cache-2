5|$|Despite {{not making}} {{landfall}} on the United States, the hurricane caused widespread damage. Extensive precautionary measures were undertaken across the coast, particularly <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>England.</b> The heightened precautions were {{due in part}} to fears that effects from the storm would be similar to that of a devastating hurricane that struck the region two years prior. Most of the damage associated with the hurricane occurred in New Jersey, where the combination of moisture from the hurricane and a stationary front produced record rainfall, peaking at 24in (610mm) in the town of Ewan. This would make the storm the wettest in state history. The resultant floods damaged infrastructure, mostly to road networks. Damage in the state amounted to $4million. Farther north <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>England,</b> strong winds were reported, though damage remained minimal. Although the storm made two landfalls in Atlantic Canada, damage there too was minimal, and was limited to several boating incidents caused by strong waves. Overall, the hurricane caused seven fatalities.|$|E
