We find that women, natives and individuals with higher school attainment have a higher probability of participating in the survey. Although the differences are small, they are mostly statistically significant (as indicated by respective p-values). However, as explained above, we do not know whether these differences arise due to selective non-response behavior or because the gross sample and the refusals still contain individuals who do not belong to the target population.

Secondly, statistical procedures exist in which pseudo-populations actually have to be generated.

40|$|Abstract ‘‘Total survey error’ ’ is a {{conceptual}} framework describing statistical error properties of sample survey statistics. Early {{in the history of}} sample surveys, it arose as a tool to focus on implications of various gaps between the conditions under which probability samples yielded un-biased estimates of finite population parameters and practical situations in implementing survey design. While the framework permits design-based estimates of various error components, many of the design burdens to produce those estimates are large, and in practice most surveys do not implement them. Further, the framework does not incorporate other, non-statistical, dimensions of quality that are commonly utilized in evaluating statistical information. The importation of new modeling tools brings new promise to measuring total survey error components, but also new chal-lenges. A lasting value of the total survey error framework is at the design stage of a survey, to attempt a balance of costs and various errors. Indeed, this framework is the central organizing structure of the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>survey</b> methodology...|$|E
