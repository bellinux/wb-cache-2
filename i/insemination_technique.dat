50|$|Sperm washing is {{the process}} in which {{individual}} sperms are separated from the semen. Washed sperm is used in artificial insemination using the intrauterine insemination (IUI) technique and in in vitro fertilization (IVF). It may {{also be used to}} decrease the risk of HIV transmission by an HIV-positive male, in which case the washed sperm is injected into a female using an artificial <b>insemination</b> <b>technique.</b>|$|E
50|$|ICI is painless and is {{the easiest}} and most common <b>insemination</b> <b>technique.</b> The process closely {{replicates}} the ejaculation of sperm by the penis during sexual intercourse, with fresh semen being directly deposited onto {{the neck of the}} cervix. It is the simplest artificial insemination method and unwashed or raw semen is normally used, but semen supplied by a sperm bank which has been prepared for IUI use may also be used. The procedure is commonly used in home, self-insemination and practitioner insemination procedures, and for insemination where semen is provided by private donors. When performed at home without the presence of a professional this procedure is sometimes referred to as intravaginal insemination (IVI).|$|E
50|$|Artificial {{insemination}} may employ assisted reproductive technology, {{sperm donation}} and animal husbandry techniques. Artificial insemination techniques available include intracervical insemination and intrauterine insemination. The beneficiaries of artificial insemination {{are women who}} desire {{to give birth to}} their own child who may be in a lesbian relationship, single women or women who are in a heterosexual relationship but with a male partner who suffers from male infertility. Intracervical insemination (ICI) is the easiest and most common <b>insemination</b> <b>technique</b> and can be used in the home for self-insemination without medical practitioner assistance. Compared with natural insemination (i.e., insemination by sexual intercourse), artificial insemination can be more expensive and more invasive, and may require professional assistance.|$|E

40|$|The silkworm, Bombyx mori, has a dimorphic sperm system. The eupyrene sperm is {{the sperm}} to {{fertilize}} eggs and the apyrene sperm plays {{a crucial role}} for assisting fertilization. Heat-treated (331 C for 96 h) Daizo (DH) males, one of the strains in the silkworm, produce only eupyrene sperm, while in triploid males only apyrene sperm are functional. Though both types of males are found to be sterile, double copulation of the two males with a single female greatly increases fertility. Here we examined the fertilizing ability of eupyrene and apyrene sperm by means of an artificial <b>insemination</b> <b>technique</b> previously established in B. mori. Neither the eupyrene sperm collected from DH males, nor the apyrene sperm from triploid males have the ability to fertilize eggs. Artificial insemination with the mixture of eupyrene and apyrene sperm leveled up the frequency of fertilized eggs to more than 80 %. When cryopreserved DH sperm (eupyrene sperm) were subjected to the same experiment, more than 95 % fertilized eggs were obtained. These results confirmed that apyrene sperm play an important and indispensable role in fertilization in B. mori.

40|$|STUDY QUESTION Is it {{feasible}} to identify factors that significantly affect the clinical outcome of IVF-ICSI cycles {{and use them}} to reliably design a predictor of implantation? SUMMARY ANSWER The Bayesian network (BN) identified top-history embryos, female age and the <b>insemination</b> <b>technique</b> as the most relevant factors for predicting the occurrence of pregnancy (AUC, area under curve, of 0. 72). In addition, it could discriminate between no implantation and single or twin implantations in a prognostic model that can be used prospectively. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY The key requirement for achieving a single live birth in an IVF-ICSI cycle is the capacity to estimate embryo viability in relation to maternal receptivity. Nevertheless, the lack of a strong predictor imposes several restrictions on this strategy. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION Medical histories, laboratory data and clinical outcomes of all fresh transfer cycles performed at the International Institute for Reproductive Medicine of Lugano, Switzerland, in the period 2006 - 2008 (n = 388 cycles), were retrospectively evaluated and analyzed. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS Patients were unselected for age, sperm parameters or other infertility criteria. Before being admitted to treatment, uterine anomalies were excluded by diagnostic hysteroscopy. To evaluate the factors possibly related to embryo viability and maternal receptivity, the class variable was categorized as pregnancy versus no pregnancy and the features included: female age, number of previous cycles, <b>insemination</b> <b>technique,</b> sperm of proven fertility, the number of transferred top-history embryos, the number of transferred top-quality embryos, the number of follicles > 14 mm and the level of estradiol on the day of HCG administration. To assess the classifier, the indicators of performance were computed by cross-validation. Two statistical models were used: the decision tree and the BN. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHOICE The decision tree identified the number of transferred top-history embryos, female age and the <b>insemination</b> <b>technique</b> as the features discriminating between pregnancy and no pregnancy. The model achieved an accuracy of 81. 5 % that was significantly higher in comparison with the trivial classifier, but the increase was so modest that the model was clinically useless for predictions of pregnancy. The BN could more reliably predict the occurrence of pregnancy with an AUC of 0. 72, and confirmed the importance of top-history embryos, female age and <b>insemination</b> <b>technique</b> in determining implantation. In addition, it could discriminate between no implantation, single implantation and twin implantation with the AUC of 0. 72, 0. 64 and 0. 83, respectively. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION The relatively small sample of the study did not permit the inclusion of more features that could also have a role in determining the clinical outcome. The design of this study was retrospective to identify the relevant features; a prospective study is now needed to verify the validity of the model. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS The resulting predictive model can discriminate with reasonable reliability between pregnancy and no pregnancy, and can also predict the occurrence of a single pregnancy or multiple pregnancy. This could represent an effective support for deciding how many embryos and which embryos to transfer for each couple. Due to its flexibility, the number of variables in the predictor can easily be increased to include other features that may affect implantation.

40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this {{bachelor}} thesis is to describe the use of artificial insemination (AI) in sheep and discuss the possibilities for AI in Sweden. Male and female fertility, heat detection, semen handling and <b>insemination</b> <b>techniques</b> in sheep are described. Advantages and disadvantages of AI are discussed. In order to achieve genetic progress it is important with well planned and implemented breeding programs. The Swedish Sheep Recording Scheme and computer software from Elitlamm are the basis for sheep breeding in Sweden. Natural mating of ewes are most common {{and the use of}} AI is limited. However, there is an increasing interest for use of AI for importation of genetic material and for storage of semen from endangered breeds. In Norway the use of AI has increased in recent years. Two different methods, cervical and vaginal insemination, are used. When using AI it is advantageous if all ewes in the herd are in heat at the same time. Oestrus synchronization can be implemented by means of synthetic hormones or with use of so-called teaser rams. The technique that works best and is recommended in Norway is vaginal <b>insemination.</b> This <b>technique,</b> together with ram synchronized heat is good practice also in Swedish sheep breeding...|$|R

40|$|Summary. (1) Variation in {{the quality}} of rabbit {{spermatozoa}} has been related to variation in the conception rate, gestation length, litter size, birth weight and mortality from birth to weaning, after homospermic and heterospermic insemination.

The importance of spermatozoan quality and of the number of spermatozoa inseminated has been discussed in relation to heterospermic insemination.

40|$|Abstract Background We {{present a}} case of primary {{infertility}} related to extreme cervical stenosis, a subset of cervical factor infertility which accounts for approximately 5 % of all clinical infertility referrals. Case presentation A 37 year-old nulligravida was successfully treated with ovulation induction via recombinant follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and direct intraperitoneal insemination (IPI). Anticipating controlled ovarian hyperstimulation with in vitro fertilization/embryo transfer (IVF), the patient underwent hysteroscopy and cervical recanalization, but safe intrauterine access was not possible due to severe proximal cervical stricture. Hysterosalpingogram established bilateral tubal patency and confirmed an irregular cervical contour. Since the cervical canal could not be traversed, neither standard intrauterine insemination nor transcervical embryo transfer could be offered. Prepared spermatozoa were therefore placed intraperitoneally at both tubal fimbria under real-time transvaginal sonographic guidance using a 17 gage single-lumen IVF needle. Supplementary progesterone was administered as 200 mg/d lozenge (troche) plus 200 mg/d rectal suppository, maintained from the day following IPI to the 8 th gestational week. A singleton intrauterine pregnancy was achieved after the second ovulation induction attempt. Conclusions In this report, we outline the relevance of cervical factor infertility to reproductive medicine practice. Additionally, our andrology evaluation, ovulation induction approach, spermatozoa preparation, and <b>insemination</b> <b>technique</b> in such cases are described. </p...|$|E

The changes in fat body and ovary development support {{the concept of a}} fat body timer responsible for maintaining diapause. Eggs laid by new queens of B. occidentalis were largely nonviable and those which hatched died. A discussion of the problem in terms of queen motivation and inadequate releasers for maternal behaviors is presented. Artificial insemination of bumble bee queens is feasible. Sperm collection, <b>insemination</b> <b>techniques,</b> the female reproductive anatomy, and suggestions for improvements are included...|$|R
40|$|The {{accuracy}} and data rate of Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) are {{strongly influenced by}} several parameters. To optimize measurements, a system for setting up the velocimeter, not influenced by the specific environment, is needed. It is necessary to choose several optical parameters, to evaluate <b>insemination</b> <b>techniques</b> (not influenced by specific flow fields) and to compare seeding performance in a right range of velocities. A supersonic wind tunnel was constructed, to evaluate the measurement LDV system {{in a range of}} velocities from 50 m/s to 450 m/s using various kinds of seeding. Tests were performed both in accelerating velocity zones and in the presence of shock waves. Comparative tests were made using suspension in water of various materials as seeding: Polystyrene (PSL), microballoons, four kinds of commercial aluminum oxide powder in distillate (pH = 6) and acid water (pH = 2), plus other oxides like TiO 2 and ZrO 2.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{accurate}} {{measurement of}} semen fertilizing potential {{is of great}} importance in determining the acceptability of processed semen for breeding purposes. A good sperm preparation technique results in a sample with high viability and motility and also takes into account other parameters such as the capacitation and apoptotic state which could compromise the ability to fertilize an oocyte. In this study, we investigate the effects of 4 sperm preparation techniques (a dextran/swim-up procedure, discontinuous Percoll density gradient centrifugation, sucrose washing, and filtration) on ram sperm quality parameters. Besides the evaluation of viability and the capacitation state, we also analyzed the apoptotic status of the sperm samples by assessing the phosphatidylserine translocation and caspase- 3 and- 7 activities. This is the first report, to our knowledge, that evidences the presence of active caspases in ram sperm. The results confirm the better ability of the dextran/swimup procedure to select nonapoptotic spermatozoa, in addition to viable and noncapacitated sperm, compared with other sperm preparation methods. This should be considered to enhance results of artificial <b>insemination</b> <b>techniques</b> in ovine reproduction...|$|R
