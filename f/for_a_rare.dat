5|$|Eleven {{people have}} served as {{governor}} of the State of Alaska over 13 distinct terms, though Alaska had over 30 civilian and military governors during its long history as a United States territory. Only two governors, William Allen Egan and Bill Walker, were born in Alaska. Two people, Egan and Wally Hickel, have been elected to multiple non-consecutive terms as governor. Hickel is also noted <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> third party win in American politics, having been elected to a term in 1990 representing the Alaskan Independence Party. The longest-serving {{governor of the state}} was Egan, who was elected three times and served nearly 12 years. The longest-serving territorial governor was Ernest Gruening, who served 13½ years.|$|E
5|$|In {{the bottom}} half of the inning, Yankees ace Jack McDowell, who had entered the game in the 9th inning <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> relief appearance, faced Joey Cora, Ken Griffey, Jr., and Edgar Martínez—the second, third, and fourth batters in the Mariners' order, respectively. Second baseman Cora dragged a bunt down the first base line and reached first base safely on an infield hit. Yankees manager Buck Showalter argued the call, believing Cora should have been called out for running off the baselines; however, the umpires' ruling stood. Center fielder Griffey singled to short right-center field, {{allowing}} Cora to reach third base. Designated hitter Martinez then doubled down the left field line, scoring Cora with the tying run and Griffey with the winning run. The Mariners' dugout emptied and mobbed Griffey, Martinez, and Cora on the field in celebration of the franchise's first ever playoff series victory.|$|E

5|$|There {{have been}} 68 post-Revolution {{governors}} of the state, serving 72 distinct spans in office. The longest terms in office {{were in the}} state's early years, when four governors were elected to nine or more one-year terms.

5|$|Levels {{of genetic}} {{diversity}} within individual populations of B.cuneata are unusually high <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> and endangered species, but the populations {{fall into two}} genetically distinct groups. These are separated not by geographical distance but by the Salt River, an ephemeral saline river system that provides a habitat unsuitable for both B.cuneata and the birds that pollinate it. It thus functions {{as a barrier to}} the exchange of genetic material, allowing populations on different sides of the river to diverge through genetic drift. The implication for conservation is that effort should be invested {{on both sides of the}} river in order to conserve as much genetic diversity as possible. It was suggested that one large population from each population group would probably be adequate. More recently, however, a model-based risk analysis found that the population size required to reduce extinction risk to acceptable levels is more than ten times the current population size. This leads to the conclusion that all populations, and all available habitat, should be protected.|$|E
