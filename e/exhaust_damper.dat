The overall aim of the present research is to design the support systems for this new Steiner tunnel, to commission the tunnel for operation and to characterize the final tunnel operation against a series of materials with known fire performance characteristics. The first stage of commissioning is to design and implement the safety controls system for the Steiner tunnel, fulfilling all {{the requirements of the}} safety regulations and provide additional safety calculations needed for approval of the system. Following this, the overall tunnel operation is tested with the tunnel installed at its full 25 foot length. In the first phase of testing, a series of `pre- calibration' experiments is conducted using various off-the-shelf wood product samples. These tests are designed to examine the behaviour of the tunnel prior to the much more costly, formal red oak calibration test, since {{it has been reported that}} red oak calibration criteria can be fairly difficult to meet, especially for newly constructed tunnels. Tests are conducted on various wood products including red oak, OSB, particle board, and plywood to evaluate the tunnel performance. The three specific parameters that are found to have significant influence on tunnel operation are gas flow to the burner, draft pressure within the main tunnel section, and the <b>exhaust</b> <b>damper</b> position. During calibration tests, it is found that of the three parameters that are studied (gas flow, tunnel draft, and damper position), the damper position has the most influence on FSI. The far damper should be utilized to control tunnel air flow. If this is not possible, the damper position should be kept 18 pipe diameters from the end of the tunnel. Gas flow effects are found to be largely dependent on outside temperatures, and most likely is outside of lab facilities control. For gas flow, flame spread results are most affected for flow rates below 7. 0 m^ 3 /hr which corresponded to maintaining inlet gas temperature above 18 C. Therefore, it is determined that the tunnel should only be operated when the lab temperature is above 18 C. Airflow through the tunnel as indicated by tunnel draft pressure is found to greatly impact measured flame spread characteristics for most samples tested. The appropriate range for the tunnel draft pressure is determined to be between 0. 090 - 0. 110 in-WC (22. 4 - 27. 4 Pa) so that it would not have a significant effect on flame spread results. Since sudden changes in draft pressure are found to essentially obstruct flame progression, FSI results are improved when fan control measures are implemented to stabilize the draft pressure within the main tunnel enclosure...|$|E

A poem by William McGonagall, published just after the shipwreck, contained the lines: But the sufferings of the survivors are pitiful to hear,And I think all Christian people for them will drop a tear,Because the rowers of the boats were <b>exhausted</b> with <b>damp</b> and cold;And the heroine of the wreck was Miss Greta Williams, be it told.She remained in as open boat with her fellow-passengers and crew,And sang [...] "O rest in the Lord, and He will come to our rescue";And for fourteen hours they were rowing on the mighty deep,And when each man was done with his turn he fell asleep.|$|R

40|$|Techniques are {{described}} {{that may be}} implemented in an adaptive control device to regulate multiple zone environmental units based upon multiple temperature values and multiple airflow values, where each temperature value and each airflow value {{is related to the}} temperature and the airflow in a specific zone. In an implementation, the input interface of the adaptive control device is configured to receive multiple temperature values and multiple air flow values from multiple zone sensors. The adaptive control device may calculate multiple operational values based on the multiple temperature values and the multiple air flow values. An operational value indicates a power state (e. g. power on/power off) for a zone environmental unit 2 ̆ 7 s fan, compressor, heater, <b>exhaust</b> fan, and <b>damper.</b> The adaptive control device 2 ̆ 7 s output interface is operable to transmit multiple sequencing commands to the plurality of zone environmental units...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, a {{study of}} an exhaust system on a single {{cylinder}} internal combustion engine was performed at AVL in Södertälje, from September 2011 to January 2012. AVL works with engine and drivetrain development and {{is involved in the}} whole chain of development, from simulation to construction of hardware and at the end tools for testing, measuring and certification. The single cylinder engine is used for tests and research due to its simple construction. AVL´s single cylinder (SC) engine is a hybrid based on an LNF (SAAB/GM engine family) head with a long stroke crankshaft and a displacement of 550 cc, which would result in a 2. 2 liter four cylinder engine. The LNF is a turbocharged, direct or port fuel injected 4 -stroke, with dual overhead camshafts and four valves internal combustion engine. AVL needed an optimized exhaust system for this engine. Cylinder and exhaust pressure during the exhaust stroke where subjects of focus as the initial pressure oscillated round the average exhaust pressure level. Measurements were made on the engine for all the necessary data for comparison and calibration of the simulated GT-Power model. GT-Post was used for analysis and displaying data and graphs. Remodeling of the computer models exhaust system was performed in Gem 3 D, a 3 -dimensional pipe analysis submissive program to GT-Power. Simulations showed that the solution for the pulse oscillations were to use a perforated pipe inside a wool filled box. The finished product was modeled in NX and constructed to fit the test bed. The new exhaust system was also made easier to assemble and maintain in the SC engine test bed. The new <b>exhaust</b> system/pulse <b>damper</b> was tested and verified. The cylinder pressure during the exhaust stroke did not meet the simulations behavior, but the pressure waves in the exhaust system were reduced. In conclusion, suggestions were made of what future work can consist of in order to improve the performance of the created pulse damper. Validerat; 20130918 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|R
