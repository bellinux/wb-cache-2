40|$|This paper {{examines}} the behaviour of {{continuous reinforced concrete}} beams exposed to fire on three sides, in order to investigate the effect of different lengths of the top reinforcing bars over the supports. The study was performed with 2 D finite element analysis using SAFIR. The effect of continuity was investigated with rectangular crosssection beams spanning over two and three bays subjected to the ISO 834 fire. Compared to a single span beam, the continuous beams resisted the fire exposure {{for a longer period}} of time. It was found that different lengths of the top reinforcing bars resulted in different failure mechanisms, but did not greatly affect the fire resistance of the beams. The influence of the <b>full</b> process of <b>fire</b> <b>development</b> was analysed using the ISO fire for 30, 60 and 90 minutes followed by a decay phase. Structural failure only occurred if the fully developed phase of the fire continued until very close to the failure time reached with no decay phase...|$|R

The natural ventilation rate, {{a major factor in the}} internal flow patterns and <b>fire</b> <b>development</b> is reviewed. The flow about the fuselage as affected by the wind and external fire is studied. An analysis was performend which estimated the rates of ventilation produced by the wind for a limited idealized environmental configuration. The simulation utilizes the empirical pressure coefficient distribution of an infinite circular cylinder near a wall with its boundary later flow to represent the atmospheric boundary layer. The resulting maximum ventilation rate for two door size openings, with varying circumferential location in a common 10 mph wind was an order of magnitude greater than the forced ventilation specified in <b>full</b> scale <b>fire</b> testing. The parameter discussed are: (1) fuselage size and shape, (2) fuselage orientation and proximity to the ground, (3) fuselage-openings size and location, (4) wind speed and direction, and (5) induced flow of the external fire plume is recommended. The fire testing should be conducted to a maximum ventilation rate at least an order of magnitude greater than the inflight air conditioning rates...|$|R

It is shown that designing parameters provided by API are more credible and large foam monitors act as the main fire extinguish facilities. The fire water supplying system is designed according to “Fire prevention code of petrochemical enterprise design”. The results show that the capability of the present fire fighting system should be raised up to at least 6 - 10 times to meet the need to extinguish <b>full</b> surface <b>fires</b> of large scale floating roof tanks.

40|$|The five {{relative}} {{energy release}} criteria (RERC) {{which are a}} first step towards formulating a unified concept {{that can be applied}} to the <b>development</b> of <b>fires</b> in enclosures, place upper bounds on the rate and amount of energy released during a fire. They are independent, calculated readily, and may be applied generally to any enclosure regardless of size. They are useful in pretest planning and for interpreting experimental data. Data from several specific fire test programs were examined to evaluate the potential use of RERC to provide test planning guidelines. The RERC were compared with experimental data obtained in full-scale enclosures. These results confirm that in general the RERC do identify the proper limiting constraints on enclosure <b>fire</b> <b>development</b> and determine the bounds of the <b>fire</b> <b>development</b> envelope. Plotting actual fire data against the RERC reveals new valid insights into fire behavior and reveals the controlling constraints in <b>fire</b> <b>development.</b> The RERC were calculated and plotted for several descrpitions of full-scale fires in various aircraft compartments...|$|R

The aim {{of this research is}} to use experiments, particularly a full-scale passenger train fire experiment, to increase understanding of fire behaviour in passenger trains and evaluate existing design fire estimation methods applied to passenger trains. A design fire represents a <b>fire</b> <b>development</b> scenario in terms of a heat release rate (HRR) vs time curve. The design fire is the most critical input affecting fire safety design of trains, tunnels and surrounding infrastructure. Large fires involving at least an entire carriage are rare but can result in severe consequences and require design consideration. Current understanding of <b>fire</b> <b>development</b> on passenger trains is limited. Very limited experimental research has been conducted, particularly full-scale HRR measurement of entire carriages. As a result, existing methods for design fire estimation applied to trains are based on crude assumptions and appropriate design fires for passenger trains are uncertain...|$|R

40|$|Accurately {{predicting}} {{temperature distribution}} in flashover fire {{is a key}} issue for evacuation and fire-fighting. Now many good flashover fire experiments have be conducted, {{but most of these}} experiments are proceeded in enclosure with fixed openings; researches on <b>fire</b> <b>development</b> and temperature distribution in flashover caused by backdraft fire did not receive enough attention. In order to study flashover phenomenon caused by backdraft fire, a full-scale fire experiment was conducted in one abandoned office building. Process of <b>fire</b> <b>development</b> and temperature distribution in room and corridor were separately recorded during the experiment. The experiment shows that <b>fire</b> <b>development</b> in enclosure is closely affected by the room ventilation.

Based on BFD curve and experimental data, mathematical models are proposed to predict temperature curve in flashover fire caused by backdraft at last.
