An analysis of the activity of blue wildebeest at the Serengeti National Park showed that the animals devoted over half of their total time to rest, 33% to grazing, 12% to moving about (mostly walking) and a little to social interactions. However, there were variations among different age and sex groups.|$|E

5|$|Meat ants {{have been}} {{observed}} blocking banded sugar ant nesting holes with pebbles and soil {{to prevent them from}} leaving their nest during the early <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> Banded sugar ants counter this by preventing meat ants from leaving their nest by blocking their nesting holes with debris, a behaviour known as nest-plugging. If meat ant nests are encroached by trees or other shade, banded sugar ants may invade and take over the nest, since the health of the colony may deteriorate from overshadowing. Members of an affected meat ant colony later move to a nearby satellite nest that is placed in a suitable area, while invading banded sugar ants fill nest galleries up with a black resinous material. Meat ants sometimes attract cats because of the chemicals they secrete (dihydronepetalactone, isodihydronepetalactone and iridomyrmecin).|$|E

5|$|Méliès's film studio, {{which he}} had built in Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis in 1897, was a greenhouse-like {{building}} with glass walls and a glass ceiling to let in as much sunlight as possible, a concept used by most still photography studios from the 1860s onward; it was built with the same dimensions as Méliès's own Théâtre Robert-Houdin (13.5×6.6m). Throughout his film career, Méliès worked on a strict schedule of planning films in the morning, filming scenes during the brightest <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> tending to the film laboratory and the Théâtre Robert-Houdin in the late afternoon, and attending performances at Parisian theaters in the evening.|$|E

5|$|On March 12, all South Vietnamese {{soldiers}} who had survived the North Vietnamese assault gathered {{at the headquarters of}} the 23rd Infantry Division and Hoa Binh airfield. Unfortunately, those soldiers were without their leaders, because both Colonels Nguyen Trong Luat and Vu The Quang were captured by the North Vietnamese in the early <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> From Saigon, President Nguyen Van Thieu ordered Phu to hold all South Vietnamese positions at the eastern end of Ban Me Thuot, where they could stage a counter-attack. Phu drew up a plan to retake Ban Me Thuot that would involve the last two remaining regiments (44th and 45th Infantry Regiments) of the ARVN 23rd Infantry Division and the {{soldiers who}} had gathered at the 23rd Infantry Division headquarters and Hoa Binh airfield. Thieu approved the plan at dawn, and authorised Phu to make full use of three Republic of Vietnam Air Force units (6th Air Force Division belonging to the ARVN 2nd Brigade, 1st Air Force Division at Da Nang Air Base, and the 4th Air Force Division at Cần Thơ).|$|E
5|$|Other divine {{groups were}} {{composed}} of deities with interrelated roles, or who together represented {{a region of}} the Egyptian mythological cosmos. There were sets of gods for the <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> and night and for each nome (province) of Egypt. Some of these groups contain a specific, symbolically important number of deities. Paired gods can stand for opposite but interrelated concepts {{that are part of}} a greater unity. Ra, who is dynamic and light-producing, and Osiris, who is static and shrouded in darkness, merge into a single god each night. Groups of three are linked with plurality in ancient Egyptian thought, and groups of four connote completeness. Rulers in the late New Kingdom promoted a particularly important group of three gods above all others: Amun, Ra, and Ptah. These deities stood for the plurality of all gods, as well as for their own cult centers (the major cities of Thebes, Heliopolis, and Memphis) and for many threefold sets of concepts in Egyptian religious thought. Sometimes Set, the patron god of the Nineteenth Dynasty kings and the embodiment of disorder within the world, was added to this group, which emphasized a single coherent vision of the pantheon.|$|E

30|$|It {{is worth}} noting that the {{achieved}} results have been obtained without explicitly considering <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> In fact, with regard to the future developments, a very important aspect {{that will have to be}} considered is that ionospheric characteristics depend inherently on <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> At <b>the</b> solar terminator (hours around sunrise and sunset), regardless <b>of</b> <b>the</b> large-scale latitudinal spatial gradients, the electron density spatial distribution manifests also large longitudinal gradients on small spatial scales. On the contrary, under ionospheric stationary conditions (hours around noon and midnight) the electron density spatial distribution does not show large longitudinal differences and hence the ionospheric variability is characterized by small gradients on both large and small spatial scale. These considerations imply that <b>the</b> choice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> variogram model should depend on <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> real {{evolution}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Christian {{service in}} the first century is shrouded in mystery. By the second and third centuries, such Church Fathers as Clement of Alexandria, Origen, and Tertullian wrote of formalised, regular services: <b>the</b> practice <b>of</b> Morning and Evening Prayer, and prayers at <b>the</b> third <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> (terce), <b>the</b> sixth <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> (sext), and <b>the</b> ninth <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> (none). With reference to the Jewish practices, it is surely no coincidence that these major <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> prayer correspond to the first and last <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conventional <b>day,</b> and that on Sundays (corresponding to the Sabbath in Christianity), the services are more complex and longer (involving twice as many services if one counts the Eucharist and the afternoon service). Similarly, the liturgical year from Christmas via Easter to Pentecost covers roughly five months, the other seven having no major services linked to <b>the</b> work <b>of</b> Christ. However, {{this is not to say}} that the Jewish services were copied or deliberately substituted, see Supersessionism.|$|R

25|$|According to an Ancient Greek and Roman custom, the day was, {{like the}} night, {{divided into four}} parts, each {{consisting}} of three hours.

This division of the day was in vogue also among the Jews, from whom the Church borrowed it. In addition to Morning and Evening Prayer to accompany the sacrifices, there was prayer at the Third, Sixth and Ninth <b>Hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day.</b>|$|E
