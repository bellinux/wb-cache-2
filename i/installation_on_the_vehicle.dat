40|$|In 2007, the NASA Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD) {{chartered}} the NASA Engineering Safety Center (NESC) {{to demonstrate}} an alternate launch abort concept as risk mitigation for the Orion project's baseline "tower" design. On July 8, 2009, a full scale, passive aerodynamically stabilized Max Launch Abort System (MLAS) pad abort demonstrator was successfully launched from NASA Goddard Space Flight Center's Wallops Flight Facility. Aerodynamic close-outs {{were required to}} cover openings on the MLAS fairing to prevent aerodynamic flow-through and to maintain the MLAS OML surface shape. Two-ply duct tape covers were designed to meet these needs. The duct tape used was a high strength fiber reinforced duct tape with a rubberized adhesive that demonstrated 4. 6 lb/in adhesion strength to the unpainted fiberglass fairing. Adhesion strength was observed to increase {{as a function of}} time. The covers were analyzed and experimentally tested to demonstrate their ability to maintain integrity under anticipated vehicle ascent pressure loads and to not impede firing of the drogue chute mortars. Testing included vacuum testing and a mortar fire test. Tape covers were layed-up on thin Teflon sheets to facilitate <b>installation</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Custom cut foam insulation board was used to fill mortar hole and separation joint cavities and provide support to the applied tape covers. Flight test results showed that the tape covers remained adhered during flight...|$|E

40|$|An {{electro-optical}} flight deflection {{measurement system}} {{was developed for}} NASA for use <b>on</b> <b>the</b> highly maneuverable aircraft technology (HiMAT) remotely piloted research vehicle (RPRV) to provide a means of evaluating {{the performance of the}} HiMAT's aeroelastically tailored composite wing and canard. A description of the flight deflection measurement system is presented from a user's viewpoint and includes the general method of operation, system capabilities and limitations, method of <b>installation</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> HiMAT <b>vehicle,</b> and calibration of targets. Also included is a general description of the HiMAT RPRV and its design goals. Preliminary flight deflection and bending moment data were obtained at Mach 0. 8 and were extrapolated to the Mach 0. 9 maneuver design condition for comparison to NASTRAN predictions and ground loads test results. The preliminary flight test results tended to agree with the results obtained from the static ground loads tests, that is, that the NASTRAN model overpredicted the streamwise twist of the composite outer wing panel...|$|R

40|$|The systems {{engineering}} approach employs iterative evaluation of human factors issues throughout the system design process. Formative evaluation and refinement of user interfaces promotes cost savings by continuously validating design concepts and defining needs {{for improving the}} designs at the earliest possible point in the engineering process. Testing may use varying levels of prototypes of the system or simulations of its responses and user interfaces. While human factors evaluation frequently uses paper or foam board mockups, immersive driving simulators enhance the process by incorporating realistic road geometries and traffic flows and by requiring driver perception, decision making, and control actions in realistic scenarios and timelines. Three studies conducted in the Western Transportation Institute driving simulation laboratory are summarized. These used an immersive driving simulator to evaluate driversâ€™ responses to (1) Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) deployments on a rural highway, (2) the user interface to a lane departure warning system, and (3) a proprietary cooperative warning system for <b>installation</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> exterior of <b>vehicles...</b>|$|R

40|$|Winds blowing over a <b>vehicle</b> {{mounted in}} <b>the</b> launch {{position}} may induce dynamic loads which are {{large enough to}} cause structural damage. In an attempt to prevent the formation of excessive wind-induced loads <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Scout <b>vehicle,</b> spoiler strips of <b>the</b> type used <b>on</b> <b>the.</b> Vanguard <b>vehicle</b> were to be mounted along the upper two stages of the Scout. These spoilers were designed to blow off shortly after launch and might hit and damage the fins {{at the base of}} the Scout. In order to determine whether the spoilers planned for <b>installation</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Scout were needed, measurements of the response to dynamic loads imposed by winds at average velocities up to approximately 33 mph were made on a full-scale Scout <b>vehicle</b> mounted vertically <b>on</b> <b>the</b> launching tower at the NASA Wallops Station. From these measurements, it has been concluded that the deflections and bending moments measured in response t o wind-induced dynamic loads were small and should present no structural problems to <b>the</b> <b>vehicle.</b> No significant difference exists between the responses measured with and without spoilers of <b>the</b> type used <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Vanguard <b>vehicle...</b>|$|R
