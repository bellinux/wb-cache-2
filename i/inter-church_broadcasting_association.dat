40|$|In {{the past}} decades, Dutch society {{has changed a}} lot in a social-cultural sense. Three trends can be distinguished; a process of individualization, a {{changing}} emphasis on equality and solidarity, and de-ideologization. In this article we study whether membership of Dutch public <b>broadcasting</b> <b>associations</b> has changed in accordance with these trends, and whether they still represent the social-cultural diversity in Dutch society. The study is {{based on data from}} six national surveys between 1979 and 2005. A three dimensional joint correspondence analysis shows that membership of the Dutch public <b>broadcasting</b> <b>associations</b> has indeed changed in accordance with societal trends, though not at the same pace. The membership of the religious <b>broadcasting</b> <b>associations</b> has changed much more than the membership of the neutral, socialist, and intellectual <b>broadcasting</b> <b>associations.</b> Over the years, the members of the Dutch public <b>broadcasting</b> <b>associations</b> have social-culturally become more alike, though the differences are still considerable. Also, the membership of the public <b>broadcasting</b> <b>associations</b> is declining, becoming older, and higher educated. Thus, considering all of this, there is ample reason to reconsider the system of representation of social-cultural diversity in the Netherlands through social-culturally diverse public <b>broadcasting</b> <b>associations...</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Nederland 24 {{channels}} were {{an expansion}} of the Dutch public broadcasting system, in which public <b>broadcasting</b> <b>associations</b> provide general programming. Based on the amount of active members, <b>broadcasting</b> <b>associations</b> receive airtime on three national public television stations (NPO 1, NPO 2 and NPO 3). The thematic channels offered these <b>broadcasting</b> <b>associations</b> more airtime to expand its core programming. These channels broadcast round-the-clock, all day, hence the [...] "24" [...] part of the name.|$|R
50|$|The <b>{{broadcast}}ing</b> <b>associations</b> MAX, VARA and VPRO, which {{broadcast on}} public television channels such as Nederland 1 and also on public radio stations, are located on the Media Park site. The news and sports broadcaster NOS is also located on the site {{but it is not}} technically a <b>broadcasting</b> <b>association</b> (cf. television in the Netherlands). Other <b>broadcasting</b> <b>associations</b> are located elsewhere in the city of Hilversum: TROS for example is located just south of Media Park on the Lage Naarderweg.|$|R

50|$|The Media Act of 1988 meant several {{changes to}} NOS and the {{broadcasting}} system. The Services Department, {{which was made}} up of the technical, broadcast and transmission facilities of the NOS, was privatised, which meant the <b>broadcasting</b> <b>associations</b> were required to pay to use the facilities. The Netherlands Broadcast Production Company (NOB) consisted of those facilities, mainly based in Media Park in Hilversum. The Media Act also required <b>broadcasting</b> <b>association</b> members take up positions on the NOS Board of Directors. A new government commission oversaw content and financial matters, as well as admitting potential new <b>broadcasting</b> <b>associations.</b>|$|R
