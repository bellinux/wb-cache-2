The {{force of the}} clock's mainspring or a driving weight hanging from a pulley, transmitted through the clock's gear train, causes the wheel to turn, and a tooth presses {{against one of the}} pallets (h), giving the pendulum a short push.

2500|$|This {{machine was}} {{completely}} different from Harrison's watch. It was a mahogany box of approximately [...] that housed a movement that, though relatively simple, {{was close to the}} same size as Harrison's, with a balance of a similar diameter. The radical difference, however, was a newly designed escapement that featured a horizontally placed pivoted detent that allowed the balance to vibrate freely, except when impulsed by the <b>escape</b> <b>wheel.</b> The spiral balance spring also had a temperature compensation device similar to those in Arnold's watches, and based on Harrison's bimetallic strip of brass and steel. Arnold proposed manufacture of these timekeepers at 60 guineas each.|$|E
5000|$|The anchor is very {{tolerant}} of variations in its geometry, so its shape varied widely. [...] In late 19th century, in Britain, the usual design was a 90° angle between the pallets, which meant locating the anchor pivot {{a distance of}} √2 ≈ 1.4 times the <b>escape</b> <b>wheel</b> radius from the <b>escape</b> <b>wheel</b> pivot. In a grandfather clock, which had a pendulum which swung once per second, the <b>escape</b> <b>wheel</b> often had 30 teeth, which made the <b>escape</b> <b>wheel</b> rotate once per minute so the second hand could be attached to its shaft. In a 30 tooth <b>escape</b> <b>wheel</b> the pallets span about 7½ teeth. The impulse angle of the pallets, which determined the swing of the pendulum, was 3°-4°.|$|E
50|$|This was {{the first}} example of the échappement naturel and was {{constructed}} with the escapement on a detachable platform. Breguet used this arrangement in many of his marine chronometers so that his best escapement makers could perform the delicate construction and adjustments more easily. For this watch, the two <b>escape</b> <b>wheels</b> were of the same size, each having 10 impulse teeth arranged as pegs standing up from the rims of the wheels.|$|R
50|$|The duplex watch {{escapement}} {{was invented}} by Robert Hooke around 1700, improved by Jean Baptiste Dutertre and Pierre Le Roy, and put in final form by Thomas Tyrer, who patented it in 1782.The early forms had two <b>escape</b> <b>wheels.</b> The duplex escapement was difficult to make but achieved much higher accuracy than the cylinder escapement, and could equal that of the (early) lever escapement and when carefully made was {{almost as good as}} a detent escapement.|$|R

50|$|The anchor {{escapement}} {{consists of}} two parts: the <b>escape</b> <b>wheel,</b> which is a vertical wheel with pointed teeth on it rather like saw teeth, and the anchor, shaped vaguely like a ship's anchor, which swings {{back and forth on}} a pivot just above the <b>escape</b> <b>wheel.</b> On the two arms of the anchor are curved and flat faces which the teeth of the <b>escape</b> <b>wheel</b> push against, called pallets. The central shaft of the anchor is attached to a fork pushed by the pendulum, so the anchor swings back and forth, with the pallets alternately catching and releasing an <b>escape</b> <b>wheel</b> tooth on each side.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to the backward slant of the anchor <b>escape</b> <b>wheel</b> teeth, the deadbeat <b>escape</b> <b>wheel</b> teeth are radial or slant forward {{to ensure that the}} tooth makes contact with the 'dead' face of the pallet, preventing recoil.|$|E
50|$|Actually, the {{earliest}} description of an escapement, in Richard of Wallingford's 1327 manuscript Tractatus Horologii Astronomici {{on the clock}} he built at the Abbey of St. Albans, was not a verge, but a variation called a strob escapement. It consisted {{of a pair of}} <b>escape</b> <b>wheels</b> on the same axle, with alternating radial teeth. The verge rod was suspended between them, with a short crosspiece that rotated first in one direction and then the other as the staggered teeth pushed past. Although no other example is known, it is possible that this was the first clock escapement design.|$|R
5000|$|The first way {{consists}} {{of making the}} moving parts of alloys chosen to be insensitive to magnetic fields. These alloys include Invar (iron-nickel-carbon-chromium alloy), Glucydur (beryllium-bronze alloy), Nivarox (iron-nickel-chromium-titanium-beryllium alloy) and Elinvar (an alloy similar to Invar, though less resistant to magnetism and more resistant to thermal influence). These alloys are preferred by different watchmakers due to their differing properties. Since the 1950s, Nivarox and Glucydur were extensively used by watchmakers. In the 1960s, almost all Swiss watches had Glucydur balance and Nivarox hairsprings. The anchors, <b>escape</b> <b>wheels</b> and other watch mechanisms were also made of non-magnetic metals or alloys.|$|R
5000|$|The 'Double Three-legged Gravity Escapement' {{shown here}} {{is a form of}} {{escapement}} first devised by a barrister named Bloxam and later improved by Lord Grimthorpe. It is the standard for all really accurate 'Tower' clocks. [...] In the animation shown here the two [...] "gravity arms" [...] are coloured blue and red. The two three-legged <b>escape</b> <b>wheels</b> are also coloured blue and red. They work in two parallel planes so that the blue wheel only impacts the locking block on the blue arm and the red wheel only impacts the red arm. In a real escapement these impacts give rise to loud audible [...] "ticks" [...] and these are indicated by the appearance of a * beside the locking blocks. The three black lifting pins are key to the operation of the escapement. They cause the weighted gravity arms to be raised by an amount indicated by the pair of parallel lines {{on each side of the}} escapement. This gain in potential energy is the energy given to the pendulum on each cycle. For the Trinity College Cambridge Clock a mass of around 50 grams is lifted through 3 mm each 1.5 seconds - which works out to 1 mW of power. The driving power from the falling weight is about 12 mW, so t{{here is a}} substantial excess of power used to drive the escapement. Much of this energy is dissipated in the acceleration and deceleration of the frictional [...] "fly" [...] attached to the <b>escape</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{fourth wheel}} also drives the <b>escape</b> <b>wheel</b> of the lever escapement. The <b>escape</b> <b>wheel</b> teeth {{alternately}} catch on two fingers called pallets {{on the arms}} of the pallet lever, which rocks back and forth. The other end of the lever has a fork which engages with an upright impulse pin on the balance wheel shaft. Each time the balance wheel swings through its center position, it unlocks the lever, which releases one tooth of the <b>escape</b> <b>wheel,</b> allowing the watch's wheels to advance by a fixed amount, moving the hands forward. As the <b>escape</b> <b>wheel</b> turns, its tooth pushes against the lever, which gives the balance wheel a brief push, keeping it swinging back and forth.|$|E
50|$|<b>Escape</b> <b>wheel</b> - This {{wheel is}} {{released}} one tooth {{at a time}} by the escapement, with each swing of the pendulum or balance wheel. The <b>escape</b> <b>wheel</b> keeps the pendulum or balance swinging by giving it a small push each time it moves forward.|$|E
50|$|As the powered <b>escape</b> <b>wheel</b> rotates clockwise, the {{entrance}} tooth slides across the sloping impulse plane of {{the entrance}} pallet. This turns the pallets about their axis, which places the exit pallet {{into the path of}} the rotating <b>escape</b> <b>wheel.</b> Once the entrance tooth leaves the impulse {{plane of the}} entrance pallet, the wheel is able to turn a small amount (called the drop) until the exit tooth of the <b>escape</b> <b>wheel</b> lands on the locking face of the exit pallet. The wheel is said to be locked on the exit pallet. From the release from the entrance pallet to this point, the <b>escape</b> <b>wheel</b> will have turned through exactly one half of the 24 degree angle between two teeth.|$|E

50|$|The {{first group}} {{contains}} four watches which were made {{as part of}} the development of the escapement. Each watch in this group is different and each watch is part of a linear development of the escapement from the first watch, started in 1802, to the last started in 1806. The four watches seem to be of two types. The first two watches share the features of both being small, having the rarer gold dials and apparently were planned to have new escapement at the outset. The second two watches were of the usual size for men’s watches, they had the more normal silver and enamel dials and it would appear that neither was initially planned to contain the new escapement but were taken from stock and upgraded. They also show some of the improvements in design that led to the final use of the escapement in a series of tourbillon garde-temps made after 1808. For example, the driven <b>escape</b> <b>wheels</b> are smaller than the drivers and a sprung setting for the detent is introduced.|$|R
5000|$|The anchor {{consists}} of an <b>escape</b> <b>wheel</b> with pointed, backward slanted teeth, and an [...] "anchor"-shaped piece pivoted above it which rocks from side to side, linked to the pendulum. The anchor has slanted pallets on the arms which alternately catch on {{the teeth of the}} <b>escape</b> <b>wheel,</b> receiving impulses. Mechanically its operation has similarities to the verge escapement, and it has two of the verge's disadvantages: (1) The pendulum is constantly being pushed by an <b>escape</b> <b>wheel</b> tooth throughout its cycle, and is never allowed to swing freely, which disturbs its isochronism, and (2) it is a recoil escapement; the anchor pushes the <b>escape</b> <b>wheel</b> backward during part of its cycle. This causes backlash, increased wear in the clock's gears, and inaccuracy. These problems were eliminated in the deadbeat escapement, which slowly replaced the anchor in precision clocks.|$|E
50|$|Breguet {{realised}} {{that this}} problem (more serious {{at the time}} because of the rather poorer oils then available) could be removed {{and many of the}} advantages of the detent escapement retained if an impulse were given in both directions of the balance. In order to do this he geared two escape wheels together, one <b>escape</b> <b>wheel</b> driven by the fourth wheel of the wheel train, which in turn was geared to and drives a second <b>escape</b> <b>wheel.</b> A pivoted detent swings freely between them and locks each <b>escape</b> <b>wheel</b> in turn on a coaxial set of locking teeth.|$|E

50|$|It {{could be}} {{regarded}} as having its distant origins in the escapement invented by Robert Robin, C.1792, which gives a single impulse in one direction; with the locking achieved by passive lever pallets, {{the design of the}} coaxial escapement is more akin to that of another Robin variant, the Fasoldt escapement, which was invented and patented by the American Charles Fasoldt in 1859.Both Robin and Fasoldt escapements give impulse in one direction only.The latter escapement has a lever with unequal drops; this engages with two <b>escape</b> <b>wheels</b> of differing diameters. The smaller impulse wheel acts on the single pallet {{at the end of the}} lever, whilst the pointed lever pallets lock on the larger wheel.The balance engages with and is impelled by the lever through a roller pin and lever fork. The lever 'anchor' pallet locks the larger wheel and, on this being unlocked, a pallet on the end of the lever is given an impulse by the smaller wheel through the lever fork. The return stroke is 'dead', with the 'anchor' pallets serving only to lock and unlock, impulse being given in one direction through the single lever pallet.As with the duplex, the locking wheel is larger in order to reduce pressure and thus friction.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>escape</b> <b>wheel</b> {{is geared}} to the watch's wheel train, which applies torque to it from the mainspring. The {{rotation}} of the <b>escape</b> <b>wheel</b> {{is controlled by the}} pallets. The <b>escape</b> <b>wheel</b> has specially shaped teeth of either ratchet or club form, which interact with the two jewels called the entrance and exit pallets. The <b>escape</b> <b>wheel,</b> except in unusual cases, has 15 teeth and is made of steel. These pallets are attached solidly to the lever, which has at its end a fork to receive the ruby impulse pin of the balance roller which is fixed to the balance wheel shaft. The balance wheel is returned towards its static center position by an attached balance spring (not shown in the diagram). In modern design it is common for the pallet mountings and the fork to be made as a single component. The lever is mounted on a shaft and is free to rotate between two fixed banking pins.|$|E
