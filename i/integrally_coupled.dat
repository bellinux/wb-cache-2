40|$|The {{paper is}} devoted to the {{development}} of the concept of dual-bed internal circulating fluidized bed (ICFB) gasifier. The concept is also known as fast internal circulating fluidized bed (FICFB) or dual fluidized bed (DFB) gasification and refers to the promising gasification process basing on two interconnected reactors. In an ICFB process developed at JRC-IE Petten, the highly endothermic gasification reactions taking place in the fluidized bed are supported by heat and material exchange from the riser column (combustor) operating in pneumatic transport mode. In contrast to other designs, both reactors are <b>integrally</b> <b>coupled</b> and the riser is coaxially immersed in the gasifier. The obvious advantages of this approach such as excellent heat transfer and overall compactness are accompanied by certain drawbacks such as complication of the facility and problems with separation of gases between reactors. The paper reports on the design of the ICFB gasifier and the modifications leading to improvements in its general operating features. Some preliminary results are also provided together with overall operating experiences we gained during the start-up phase of the facility. JRC. F. 2 -Cleaner energ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe second {{battle of}} Hakata Bay, {{known as the}} battle of Koan, was the second attempt by Koryo (Korea) and Mongol to invade Japan {{in the summer of}} 1281. In August 1281, Ryo-Mong {{invasion}} attempt failed due to the typhoon which sunk a sizable portion of the Mongolian fleets. The Japanese called this typhoon as divine wind (Kamikaze in Japanese). In this study an <b>integrally</b> <b>coupled</b> wave-tide-surge model was used to the simulation of wave and storm surge due to the typhoon in August 1281. The track and strength of this typhoonare reported to be similar to those of typhoon Songda recently experienced in 2004 (typhoon 200418) (Imamura, 2005). Because of the lack of observations and historical records for 1281, the meteorological data in August 1281 were estimated using the Dynamic Holland model and information of typhoon Songda. The tide and storm surge simulation for typhoon Songda using the same method to acquire meteorological data as that of the typhoon in August 1281 (the battle of Koan) was performed for the model validation. The model based on this method reproduced reasonably the water levels in Kyushu and the Seto Inland Sea, Japan. This study estimated the wind field, wave properties and tide and storm surge for August 1281. It is supposed that the maximum wave height was almost two times higher than the significant wave height computed by the model, i. e., the maximum wave height was approximately 4 - 6 m, which was sufficiently large damaging river-run flat-bottomed fleet, and the high surge storm surgedid not arise due to the counter-clockwise wind of the typhoon in 1281...|$|E
40|$|Efficient {{harvesting}} of unlimited {{solar energy}} and its conversion into valuable chemicals {{is one of}} the ultimate goals of scientists. With the ever-increasing concerns about sustainable growth and environmental issues, numerous efforts have been made to develop artificial photosynthetic process for the production of fuels and fine chemicals, thus mimicking natural photosynthesis. Despite the research progress made over the decades, the technology {{is still in its infancy}} because of the difficulties in kinetic coupling of whole photocatalytic cycles. Herein, we report a new type of artificial photosynthesis system that can avoid such problems by <b>integrally</b> <b>coupling</b> biocatalytic redox reactions with photocatalytic water splitting. We found that photocatalytic water splitting can be efficiently coupled with biocatalytic redox reactions by using tetracobalt polyoxometalate and Rh-based organometallic compound as hole and electron scavengers, respectively, for photoexcited [Ru(bpy) 3] 2 +. Based on these results, we could successfully photosynthesize a model chiral compound (L-glutamate) using a model redox enzyme (glutamate dehydrogenase) upon in situ photoregeneration of cofactors. close 0...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between photosynthesis and photorespiration was determined in normal and 26 mutants of barley (Hordeum vulgare L. var. Himalaya). The rate of apparent photosynthesis ranged from 1 to 30 milligrams of CO 2 per square decimeter per hour. The variation in rate of photosynthesis was due, in some cases, {{to differences in}} chlorophyll content, in others to stomatal resistance, and in still others to unknown factors; but no single factor accounted for the variation. Photorespiratory activity, {{as determined by the}} 14 CO 2 / 12 CO 2 technique, CO 2 evolution into CO 2 -free air, and the response of photosynthesis to low and high O 2 concentrations, was positively and significantly correlated with photosynthesis. This supports the idea that the two processes are <b>integrally</b> and tightly <b>coupled.</b> There appears to be no competition between photosynthesis and photorespiration, and the probability of finding plants with high rates of photosynthesis and low rates of photorespiration measured under natural conditions, appears to be very low...|$|R
