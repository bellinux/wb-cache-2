5|$|<b>Dysarthria</b> is {{the most}} common {{communication}} problem in individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS), however, significant difficulties with speech and intelligibility are uncommon. Individuals with MS vary widely in their motor control capacity and the presence of intention tremor, and methods of access to AAC technology are adapted accordingly. Visual impairments are common in MS and may necessitate approaches using auditory scanning systems, large-print text, or synthetic speech feedback that plays back words and letters as they are typed.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2006 edition, Dick Clark Productions {{announced}} that Seacrest {{had agreed to}} remain a host for future editions of New Year's Rockin' Eve. As he was still afflicted with speech impediments that resulted from <b>dysarthria,</b> a lingering effect of his stroke, Clark's role in the special was reduced; he continued to make limited on-air appearances from Times Square Studios as co-host near midnight, and still conducted his traditional countdown, but Seacrest hosted {{the majority of the}} program outside in Times Square itself.|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} {{can cause}} a variety of symptoms including changes in sensation (hypoesthesia), muscle weakness, abnormal muscle spasms, impaired movement, difficulties with coordination and balance, problems in speech (known as <b>dysarthria)</b> or swallowing (dysphagia), visual problems (nystagmus, optic neuritis, or diplopia), fatigue and acute or chronic pain syndromes, bladder and bowel difficulties, cognitive impairment, or emotional symptoms (mainly depression). At the same time for each symptom there are different treatment options. Treatments should therefore be individualized depending both on {{the patient and the}} physician.|$|E
5|$|Language {{assessment}} {{will allow}} the recognition of medical conditions presenting with aphonia or <b>dysarthria,</b> neurological conditions such as stroke or dementia presenting with aphasia, and specific language disorders such as stuttering, cluttering or mutism. People with autism or Asperger syndrome may have abnormalities in paralinguistic and pragmatic aspects of their speech. Echolalia (repetition of another person's words) and palilalia (repetition of the subject's own words) can be heard with patients with autism, schizophrenia or Alzheimer's disease. A person with schizophrenia might use neologisms, which are made-up words which have a specific meaning to the person using them.|$|E
5|$|Traumatic {{brain injury}} {{can result in}} severe motor speech disorders; <b>dysarthria</b> {{is the most common}} such disorder, {{accounting}} for roughly a third of all cases. Depending on the stage of recovery, AAC intervention may involve identifying consistent communication signals, the facilitation of reliable yes/no responses to questions, and the ability to express basic needs and answer questions. Individuals who do not recover natural speech to a degree sufficient to meet their communication needs typically suffer from severe impairments related to cognition. Difficulties with memory and learning new skills may influence AAC choices; well-established competencies such as spelling may be more effective than AAC systems that require navigation through multiple pages to access information.|$|E
5|$|Unaided AAC {{systems are}} {{those that do not}} require an {{external}} tool, and include facial expression, vocalizations, gestures, and sign languages and systems. Informal vocalizations and gestures such as body language and facial expressions are part of natural communication, and such signals may be used by those with profound disabilities. More formalized gestural codes exist that lack a base in a naturally occurring language. For example, the Amer-Ind code is based on Plains Indian Sign Language, and has been used with children with severe-profound disabilities, and adults with a variety of diagnoses including dementia, aphasia and <b>dysarthria.</b> The benefits of gestures and pantomime are that they are always available to the user, usually understood by an educated listener, and are efficient means of communicating.|$|E
5|$|Dysphagia and dysarthria: {{dysphagia}} is {{a difficulty}} with eating and swallowing which may cause choking and aspiration of food or liquid into the lungs, while <b>dysarthria</b> is a neurological motor speech disorder characterized by poor {{control over the}} subsystems and muscles responsible for speech ("articulation"). A {{speech and language therapist}} may give advice on specific swallowing techniques, on adapting food consistencies and dietary intake, on techniques to improve and maintain speech production and clarity, and on alternative communication approaches. In the case of advanced dysphagia, food can be supplied by a nasogastric tube, which is a tube that goes through the nose directly to the stomach; or a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), which is a procedure for placing a tube into the stomach and therefore administering food directly to it. This second system, although more invasive, has better results in the long term than nasogastric intake.|$|E
5|$|Parkinson's {{disease is}} a {{progressive}} neurological condition in which <b>dysarthria</b> may develop later in the progression of the disease. Some individuals eventually lose all functional speech. AAC approaches are generally used to supplement and support natural speech. A portable amplifier, for example, {{may be used to}} increase the volume of speech and thus its intelligibility. The individual may be taught to point to the first letter of each word they say on an alphabet board, leading to a reduced speech rate and visual cues for the listener to compensate for impaired articulation. Entire words can be spelled out if necessary. In users that have reduced range and speed of movement, a smaller than usual selection display may be preferred. High-tech AAC keyboard speech-generating devices are also used; keyguards may be required to prevent accidental keystrokes caused by the tremor typical of the disease. Factors affecting AAC use in Parkinson's disease include motor deficits and cognitive changes; the latter may result in unawareness of their problems with spoken communication.|$|E
5|$|The basal ganglia—the part of {{the brain}} most {{prominently}} affected in early HD—play a key role in movement and behavior control. Their functions are not fully understood, but current theories propose that they are {{part of the}} cognitive executive system and the motor circuit. The basal ganglia ordinarily inhibit a large number of circuits that generate specific movements. To initiate a particular movement, the cerebral cortex sends a signal to the basal ganglia that causes the inhibition to be released. Damage to the basal ganglia can cause the release or reinstatement of the inhibitions to be erratic and uncontrolled, which results in an awkward start to motion or motions to be unintentionally initiated, or a motion to be halted before, or beyond, its intended completion. The accumulating damage to this area causes the characteristic erratic movements associated with HD. The spontaneous and erratic physical movements associated with HD are classified as a type of hyperkinetic <b>dysarthria.</b> Because of the basal ganglia's inability to inhibit movements, individuals affected by it will inevitably experience a reduced ability to produce speech and swallow foods and liquids (dysphagia).|$|E
25|$|<b>Dysarthria</b> {{is a form}} {{of speech}} disorder.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, <b>dysarthria,</b> another motor speech disorder, is {{characterized}} by difficulty articulating sounds. The difficulty in articulation does not occur due in planning the motor movement, as happens with AOS. Instead, <b>dysarthria</b> is caused by inability in or weakness of the muscles in the mouth, face, and respiratory system.|$|E
25|$|Between attacks {{they have}} {{nystagmus}} and <b>dysarthria.</b> These patients are responsive to acetazolamide.|$|E
25|$|Speech and {{language}} disorders {{are common in}} people with cerebral palsy. The incidence of <b>dysarthria</b> is estimated to range from 31% to 88%, and around a quarter of people with CP are non-verbal. Speech problems are associated with poor respiratory control, laryngeal and velopharyngeal dysfunction, and oral articulation disorders that are due to restricted movement in the oral-facial muscles. There are three major types of <b>dysarthria</b> in cerebral palsy: spastic, dyskinetic (athetosis), and ataxic.|$|E
25|$|People with Parkinson's {{disease can}} also develop <b>dysarthria</b> which is {{characterized}} by reduced speech intelligibility. Prosodically-based treatments may help.|$|E
25|$|Related {{conditions}} can include apraxia, <b>dysarthria</b> or other communication disorders, sensory impairments, urinary incontinence, fecal incontinence, or behavioural disorders.|$|E
25|$|Apraxia {{of speech}} can also occur in {{conjunction}} with <b>dysarthria</b> (muscle weakness affecting speech production) or aphasia (language difficulties related to neurological damage).|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{patients}} with <b>dysarthria,</b> whose speech problems are secondary, show a normal capacity for rehearsal. This {{suggests that it}} is the subvocal rehearsing that is crucial.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{side effects of}} tremor surgery include <b>dysarthria</b> (problems with motor control of speech), {{temporary}} or permanent cognitive impairment (including visual and learning difficulties), and problems with balance.|$|E
25|$|Weakness of {{the muscles}} {{involved}} in speaking may lead to <b>dysarthria</b> and hypophonia. Speech may be slow and slurred, or have a nasal quality. In some cases, a singing hobby or profession must be abandoned.|$|E
25|$|The {{severity}} of impairment and related prognosis {{is dependent on}} the location and {{severity of}} brain lesions. Up to 50% of patients will achieve some degree of ambulation. Speech problems, such as <b>dysarthria,</b> are common to these patients.|$|E
25|$|Juvenile Tay–Sachs disease. Juvenile Tay–Sachs {{disease is}} rarer than {{other forms of}} Tay–Sachs, and usually is {{initially}} seen in children between two and ten years old. People with Tay–Sachs disease develop cognitive and motor skill deterioration, <b>dysarthria,</b> dysphagia, ataxia, and spasticity. Death usually occurs between {{the age of five}} to fifteen years.|$|E
25|$|The {{neurological}} {{symptoms are}} progressive {{and can lead}} to severe spasticity, bulbar symptoms and <b>dysarthria</b> within one to two decades. The life span is shorter than normal. Death occurs between 2 and 30 years of age, depending on the severity of the syndrome. The immediate cause of death is pneumonia, fulminant intestinal bleeding or multiple organ dysfunction.|$|E
25|$|Common (1–10% of patients): blurred vision, diplopia, {{increased}} {{appetite and}} subsequent weight gain, euphoria, confusion, vivid dreams, changes in libido (increase or decrease), irritability, ataxia, attention changes, feeling high, abnormal coordination, memory impairment, tremors, <b>dysarthria,</b> parasthesia, vertigo, dry mouth and constipation, vomiting and flatulence, erectile dysfunction, fatigue, peripheral edema, feeling {{the effects of}} drunkenness, abnormal walking, asthenia, nasopharyngitis, increased creatine kinase level.|$|E
25|$|A {{differential}} diagnosis {{must be used}} in order to rule out other similar or alternative disorders. Although disorders such as expressive aphasia, conduction aphasia, and <b>dysarthria</b> involve similar symptoms as apraxia of speech, the disorders must be distinguished in order to correctly treat the patients. While AOS involves the motor planning or processing stage of speech, aphasic disorders can involve other language processes.|$|E
25|$|Electrophysial {{functional}} mapping, a tool {{used in both}} {{methods to}} verify the target nuclei, has come under scrutiny due to its associated risks of hemorrhages, <b>dysarthria</b> or tetanic contractions. Recently, susceptibility-weighted imaging, a type of MRI, has shown incredible power {{in its ability to}} distinguish these deep brain nuclei and is being used in DBS to reduce the overuse of EFM.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, {{people in the}} Grassy Narrows and Whitedog First Nations populations started to suffer {{symptoms}} of mercury poisoning. Several Japanese doctors who {{had been involved in}} studying Minamata disease in Japan travelled to Canada to investigate the mercury poisoning in these people. Blood mercury levels were above 100ppb in a significant number of individuals and above 200ppb in several others. Symptoms included sensory disturbances, such as narrowing of the visual field, and impaired hearing, abnormal eye movements, tremor, ataxia (impaired balance), and <b>dysarthria</b> (poor articulation of speech).|$|E
25|$|Singing {{is a form}} of {{rehabilitation}} for neurological impairments. Neurological impairments following a brain injury can be in the form of apraxia – loss to perform purposeful movements, <b>dysarthria,</b> muscle control disturbances (due to damage of the central nervous system), aphasia (defect in expression causing distorted speech), or language comprehension. Singing training has been found to improve lung, speech clarity, and coordination of speech muscles, thus, accelerating rehabilitation of such neurological impairments. For example, melodic intonation therapy is the practice of communicating with others by singing to enhance speech or increase speech production by promoting socialization, and emotional expression.|$|E
25|$|Status epilepticus: Although rare, focal motor {{status or}} hemiconvulsive status epilepticus {{is more likely}} to occur than {{secondarily}} generalised convulsive status epilepticus, which is exceptional. Opercular status epilepticus usually occurs in children with atypical evolution or may be induced by carbamazepine or lamotrigine. This state lasts for hours to months and consists of ongoing unilateral or bilateral contractions of the mouth, tongue or eyelids, positive or negative subtle perioral or other myoclonus, <b>dysarthria,</b> speech arrest, difficulties in swallowing, buccofacial apraxia and hypersalivation. These are often associated with continuous spikes and waves on an EEG during NREM sleep.|$|E
25|$|Over time, people {{experience}} increasing difficulty moving, swallowing (dysphagia), and speaking or forming words (<b>dysarthria).</b> Symptoms of upper motor neuron involvement include tight and stiff muscles (spasticity) and exaggerated reflexes (hyperreflexia) including an overactive gag reflex. An abnormal reflex commonly called Babinski's sign also indicates upper motor neuron damage. Symptoms of lower motor neuron degeneration include muscle weakness and atrophy, muscle cramps, and fleeting twitches of muscles {{that can be}} seen under the skin (fasciculations) although twitching is not a diagnostic symptom and more of a side effect so twitching would either occur after or accompany weakness and atrophy.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{symptoms}} of primidone overdose are coma with loss of deep tendon reflexes and, during the recovery period, {{if the patient}} survives, disorientation, <b>dysarthria,</b> nystagmus, and ataxia, lethargy, somnolence, vomiting, nausea, and occasionally, focal neurological deficits which lessen over time. Complete recovery comes within five to seven days of ingestion. The symptoms of primidone poisoning have generally been attributed to its biotransformation to phenobarbital; however, primidone has toxic effects independent of its metabolites in humans. The massive crystalluria that sometimes occurs sets its symptom profile apart from that of phenobarbital. The crystals are white, needle-like, shimmering, hexagonal plates consisting mainly of primidone.|$|E
25|$|People with aphasia may {{experience}} {{any of the}} following behaviors due to an acquired brain injury, although some of these symptoms may be due to related or concomitant problems such as <b>dysarthria</b> or apraxia and not primarily due to aphasia. Aphasia symptoms can vary based on the location of damage in the brain. Signs and symptoms {{may or may not be}} present in individuals with aphasia and may vary in severity and level of disruption to communication. Often those with aphasia will try to hide their inability to name objects by using words like thing. So when asked to name a pencil they may say it is a thing used to write.|$|E
25|$|Neurological {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} include cerebellar ataxia (unsteady walking with uncoordinated limb movements), <b>dysarthria</b> (slurred speech), dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing), tremor, epilepsy (both partial and generalized), vertical supranuclear palsy (upgaze palsy, downgaze palsy, saccadic palsy or paralysis), sleep inversion, gelastic cataplexy (sudden loss of muscle tone or drop attacks), dystonia (abnormal movements or postures caused by contraction of agonist and antagonist muscles across joints), most commonly begins with in turning of one foot when walking (action dystonia) and may spread to become generalized, spasticity (velocity dependent increase in muscle tone), hypotonia, ptosis (drooping of the upper eyelid), microcephaly (abnormally small head), psychosis, progressive dementia, progressive hearing loss, bipolar disorder, major and psychotic depression that can include hallucinations, delusions, mutism, or stupor.|$|E
25|$|Because PPS can fatigue facial muscles, {{as well as}} cause {{dysphagia}} (difficulty swallowing), <b>dysarthria</b> (difficulty speaking) or aphonia (inability {{to produce}} speech), persons with PPS may become malnourished due to difficulty eating. Compensatory routines can help relieve these symptoms such as eating smaller portions {{at a time and}} sitting down whilst eating. PPS with respiratory involvement requires special management such as breathing exercises, chest percussion with a stethoscope on regular occasions for observation of the disease and management of secretions. Failure to properly assess PPS with respiratory involvement can increase the risk of missing aspiration pneumonia (an infection of the lower respiratory tract) in an individual. Severe cases may require permanent ventilation or tracheostomy. Sleep apnoea may also occur. Other management strategies that may lead to improvement include smoking cessation, treatment of other respiratory diseases and vaccination against respiratory infections such as influenza.|$|E
25|$|Most {{children}} with A-T have difficulty in school {{because of a}} delay in response time to visual, verbal or other cues, slurred and quiet speech (<b>dysarthria),</b> abnormalities of eye control (oculomotor apraxia), and impaired fine motor control. Despite these problems, {{children with}} A-T often enjoy school if proper accommodations to their disability can be made. The decision {{about the need for}} special education classes or extra help in regular classes is highly influenced by the local resources available. Decisions about proper educational placement should be revisited as often as circumstances warrant. Despite their many neurologic impairments, most individuals with A-T are very socially aware and socially skilled, and thus benefit from sustained peer relationships developed at school. Some individuals are able to function quite well despite their disabilities and a few have graduated from community colleges.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{research}} has established {{the existence of}} primary progressive apraxia of speech caused by neuroanatomic motor atrophy. For a long time, this disorder was not distinguished from other motor speech disorders such as <b>dysarthria</b> and in particular primary progressive aphasia. Many {{studies have been done}} trying to identify areas in the brain in which this particular disorder occurs or at least to show that it occurs in different areas of the brain than other disorders. One study observed 37 patients with neurodegenerative speech disorders {{to determine whether or not}} it is distinguishable from other disorders, and if so where in the brain it can be found. Using speech and language, neurological, neuropsychological and neuroimaging testing, the researchers came to the conclusion that PAS does exist and that it correlates to superior lateral premotor and supplementary motor atrophy. However, because PAS is such a rare and recently discovered disorder, many studies do not have enough subjects to observe to make data entirely conclusive.|$|E
25|$|Medical {{treatment}} with anti-vertigo medications {{may be considered}} in acute, severe exacerbation of BPPV, {{but in most cases}} are not indicated. These primarily include drugs of the anti-histamine and anti-cholinergic class, such as meclizine and hyoscine butylbromide (scopolamine) respectively. The medical management of vestibular syndromes has become increasingly popular over the last decade, and numerous novel drug therapies (including existing drugs with new indications) have emerged for the treatment of vertigo/dizziness syndromes. These drugs vary considerably in their mechanisms of action, with many of them being receptor- or ion channel-specific. Among them are betahistine or dexamethasone/gentamicin for the treatment of Ménière's disease, carbamazepine/oxcarbazepine for the treatment of paroxysmal <b>dysarthria</b> and ataxia in multiple sclerosis, metoprolol/topiramate or valproic acid/tricyclic antidepressant for the treatment of vestibular migraine, and 4-aminopyridine for the treatment of episodic ataxia type 2 and both downbeat and upbeat nystagmus. These drug therapies offer symptomatic treatment, and do not affect the disease process or resolution rate. Medications may be used to suppress symptoms during the positioning maneuvers if the patient's symptoms are severe and intolerable. More dose-specific studies are required, however, {{in order to determine the}} most effective drug(s) for both acute symptom relief and long-term remission of the condition.|$|E
