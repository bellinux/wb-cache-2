5|$|Parker's {{proposal}} {{was for a}} 7-bay fire station on a site {{more than double the}} size of the one proposed on Newton Street. The choice of London Road was influenced by its proximity to a development of warehouses on Whitworth Street and Princess Street. Parker convinced the city council to choose <b>his</b> <b>proposals</b> rather than those on Newton Street.|$|E
5|$|A Republican, Harrison {{was elected}} to the {{presidency}} in 1888, defeating the Democratic incumbent, Grover Cleveland. Hallmarks of Harrison's administration included unprecedented economic legislation, including the McKinley Tariff, which imposed historic protective trade rates, and the Sherman Antitrust Act. Harrison also facilitated the creation of the national forest reserves through an amendment to the Land Revision Act of 1891. During his administration six western states were admitted to the Union. In addition, Harrison substantially strengthened and modernized the U.S. Navy and conducted an active foreign policy, but <b>his</b> <b>proposals</b> to secure federal education funding as well as voting rights enforcement for African Americans were unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|After leaving Columbia in September 1948, Monroe {{became the}} protégée of Johnny Hyde, {{who was the}} vice {{president}} of the William Morris Agency. Hyde represented her and their relationship soon became sexual, although she refused <b>his</b> <b>proposals</b> of marriage. To advance Monroe's career, he paid for a silicone prosthesis to be implanted in her jaw and possibly for a rhinoplasty, and arranged a bit part in the Marx Brothers film Love Happy (1950). Monroe also continued modeling, and in May 1949 she posed nude for photos taken by Tom Kelley. Although her role in Love Happy was very small, she was chosen to participate in the film's promotional tour in New York that year.|$|E

5|$|Ironside {{arrived at}} British General Headquarters at 06:00am on 20 May, {{the same day}} that {{continental}} communications between France and Belgium was cut. When Ironside made <b>his</b> <b>proposals</b> known to Gort, Gort replied such an attack was impossible. Seven of his nine divisions were engaged on the Scheldt and even if it was possible to withdraw them, it would create a gap between the Belgians and British which the enemy could exploit and encircle the former. The BEF had been marching and fighting for nine days and was now running short of ammunition. The main effort had to be made by the French to the south.|$|E
5|$|Romney used a {{bully pulpit}} {{approach}} towards promoting his agenda, staging well-organized media events to appeal {{directly to the}} public rather than pushing <b>his</b> <b>proposals</b> in behind-doors sessions with the state legislature. He dealt with a public crisis of confidence in Boston's Big Dig project– that followed a fatal ceiling collapse in 2006– by wresting control of the project from the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority. After two years of negotiating the state's participation in the landmark Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative that instituted a cap-and-trade arrangement for power plant emissions in the Northeast, Romney pulled Massachusetts out of the initiative shortly before its signing in December 2005, citing a lack of cost limits for industry.|$|E
5|$|Slaughter's unpopularity led to {{the demise}} of many of <b>his</b> <b>proposals,</b> {{regardless}} of their merits. He suggested a comprehensive system of public schools and, though the idea had been proposed by previous governors, Slaughter devised a means of funding it. The hostile legislature refused the plan and overrode Slaughter's vetoes of bills that allowed individual schools to be supported by lotteries. Slaughter further proposed a reform of the penal system and recommended internal improvements, including the creation of a state library. These measures were also rejected.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after his}} {{concepts}} had become U.S. policy, Kennan began {{to criticize the}} foreign policies that he had seemingly helped begin. Subsequently, prior {{to the end of}} 1948, Kennan became confident that positive dialogue could commence with the Soviet government. <b>His</b> <b>proposals</b> were discounted by the Truman administration and Kennan's influence was marginalized, particularly after Dean Acheson was appointed Secretary of State in 1949. Soon thereafter, U.S. Cold War strategy assumed a more assertive and militaristic quality, causing Kennan to lament about what he believed was an abrogation of his previous assessments.|$|E
5|$|The {{next year}} the Capitols went 28–20 but were {{eliminated}} from the playoffs in a one-game Western Division tie-breaker. In the 1948–49 BAA season, the Caps won their first 15 games and finished the season at 38–22. The team reached the BAA Finals, but were beaten by the Minneapolis Lakers, who were led by Hall-of-Fame center George Mikan. In the next season, the BAA and the rival league National Basketball League merged to become the NBA, and Auerbach {{felt he had to}} rebuild his squad. However, owner Uline declined <b>his</b> <b>proposals,</b> and Auerbach resigned.|$|E
5|$|Although Democrats held a {{majority}} {{in both houses of}} the General Assembly, they were divided by factionalism, which made it difficult for Chandler to find sufficient support for his programs. Some of the factionalism came from Clements and Combs supporters who were not willing to cooperate with Chandler, their chief political enemy. Still other resistance to Chandler came from a group of more liberal lawmakers like John B. Breckinridge who simply had philosophical differences with the governor. Near the end of the 1958 legislative session, this group demanded a special session to deal with the need for more money for schools and welfare programs, but Chandler refused to call the session when the liberals would not agree to pass only the measures he put before them. Because of the factionalism, Chandler had to ally with Republican legislators throughout his term in order to pass many of <b>his</b> <b>proposals,</b> including his tax plan. Frequently, this meant promising to build or repair roads in Republican districts in return for their support of his programs.|$|E

5|$|Democrats won a {{majority}} in the Indiana House of Representatives in the 2006 and 2008 elections. This caused Indiana to have a divided government, with Democrats controlling the Indiana House of Representatives and the Republicans controlling the governor's office and the Indiana Senate. This also lead to a stalemate in the budget debate, which caused Mitch Daniels call a special session of the Indiana General Assembly. The state was faced with a $1 billion shortfall in revenue for the 2009–11 budget years. Daniels proposed a range of spending cuts and cost-saving measures in his budget proposal. The General Assembly approved some of <b>his</b> <b>proposals,</b> but relied heavily on the state's reserve funds to pay for the budget shortfall. Daniels signed the $27 billion two-year budget into law.|$|E
5|$|Frustrated at {{not being}} {{accepted}} as a serious actor, Leno became obsessed {{with the idea of}} playing Richard III and other great Shakespearean roles, inundating the actor–manager Herbert Beerbohm Tree with <b>his</b> <b>proposals.</b> After his final run of Mother Goose at the Drury Lane Theatre in early 1903, Leno's delusions overwhelmed him. On the closing evening, and again soon afterwards, he travelled to the home of Constance Collier, who was Beerbohm Tree's leading lady at His Majesty's Theatre, and also followed her to rehearsal there. He attempted to persuade her to act alongside him in a Shakespearean season that Leno was willing to fund. On the second visit to her home, Leno brought Collier a jewellery box holding a diamond-encrusted plaque. Recognising that Leno was having a mental breakdown, she sadly and gently refused his offer, and Leno left distraught.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{tendered}} {{his resignation}} from office on December 1, 1794, giving Washington two months' notice, {{in the wake of}} his wife Eliza's miscarriage while he was absent during his armed repression of the Whiskey Rebellion. Before leaving his post on January 31, 1795, Hamilton submitted a Report on a Plan for the Further Support of Public Credit to Congress to curb the debt problem. Hamilton grew dissatisfied with what he viewed as a lack of a comprehensive plan to fix the public debt. He wished to have new taxes passed with older ones made permanent and stated that any surplus from the excise tax on liquor would be pledged to lower public debt. <b>His</b> <b>proposals</b> were included into a bill by Congress within slightly over a month after his departure as treasury secretary. Some months later Hamilton resumed his law practice in New York to remain closer to his family.|$|E

5|$|Howe's {{impatience with}} the {{necessity}} for parliamentary debate of <b>his</b> <b>proposals</b> won him few friends, and he was often accused of dictatorial conduct by the Opposition. As the Liberal government entered its third decade, it and Howe {{came to be seen}} as arrogant. The Government's attempt to impose closure in the 1956 Pipeline Debate led to major controversy in the House of Commons. In the 1957 election, Howe's actions and policies were made an issue by Opposition leader John Diefenbaker. Howe faced a serious challenge in his riding, but was expected to make speeches elsewhere as a major Liberal leader. Howe lost his seat in the election, and Diefenbaker became Prime Minister, ending almost 22years of Liberal rule. Howe returned to the private sector, accepting a number of corporate directorships. The former minister died suddenly {{of a heart attack in}} December 1960.|$|E
5|$|Johnson's work on The Plays of William Shakespeare took {{up most of}} his time. On 8 June 1756, Johnson {{published}} <b>his</b> <b>Proposals</b> for Printing, by Subscription, the Dramatick Works of William Shakespeare, which {{argued that}} previous editions of Shakespeare were edited incorrectly {{and needed to be}} corrected. Johnson's progress on the work slowed as the months passed, and he told music historian Charles Burney in December 1757 that it would take him until the following March to complete it. Before that could happen, he was arrested again, for a debt of £40, in February 1758. The debt was soon repaid by Jacob Tonson, who had contracted Johnson to publish Shakespeare, and this encouraged Johnson to finish his edition to repay the favour. Although it took him another seven years to finish, Johnson completed a few volumes of his Shakespeare to prove his commitment to the project.|$|E
5|$|Menem {{began his}} {{presidency}} assuming a non-confrontational approach, and appointing {{people from the}} conservative opposition, and business people to his cabinet. To prevent successful legal cases against the projected privatizations, the Supreme Court's numbers were increased from five to nine judges; the new judges ruled in support of Menem and usually had the majority. Other institutions that restrained or limited executive power were controlled as well. When Congress resisted some of <b>his</b> <b>proposals,</b> he used the Necessity and Urgency Decree {{as an alternative to}} send bills to it. He even considered it feasible to dissolve Congress and rule by decree, but this step was never implemented. In addition, he developed a bon vivant lifestyle, taking advantage of his authority. For instance, he made a journey from Buenos Aires to Pinamar driving a Ferrari Testarossa in less than two hours, violating speed limits. He divorced his wife Zulema Yoma and expanded the Quinta de Olivos presidential residence with a golf course, a small zoo, servants, barber, and even a buffoon.|$|E

5|$|The {{actions taken}} against the {{military}} {{contributed to a}} strong showing by the UCR in the November 1985 legislative elections. They gained one seat in the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of Congress, which meant control of 130 of the 254 seats. The Justicialists lost eight seats (leaving 103) and smaller, provincial parties made up the difference. Alfonsín surprised observers in April 1986 by announcing {{the creation of a}} panel entrusted to plan a transfer of the nation's capital to Viedma, a small coastal city 800km (500mi) south of Buenos Aires. <b>His</b> <b>proposals</b> boldly called for constitutional amendments creating a Parliamentary system, including a Prime Minister, and were well received by the Chamber of Deputies, though they encountered strong opposition in the Senate.|$|E
5|$|The {{convention}} {{spent several}} weeks in August in debating {{the powers of}} Congress. Although Mason was successful in some of <b>his</b> <b>proposals,</b> such as placing the state militias under federal regulation, and a ban on Congress passing an export tax, he lost on some that he deemed crucial. These losses included the convention deciding to allow importation of slaves to continue to at least 1800 (later amended to 1808) and to allow a simple majority to pass navigation acts that might require Virginians to export their tobacco in American-flagged ships, when it might be cheaper to use foreign-flagged vessels. The convention also weakened the requirement that money bills begin in the House and {{not be subject to}} amendment in the Senate, eventually striking the latter clause after debate that stretched fitfully over weeks. Despite these defeats, Mason continued to work constructively to build a constitution, serving on another grand committee that considered customs duties and ports.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea of the}} circumstellar {{habitable}} zone {{was introduced}} in 1953 by Hubertus Strughold and Harlow Shapley and in 1959 by Su-Shu Huang as the region around a star in which an orbiting planet could retain water at its surface. From the 1970s, planetary scientists and astrobiologists began to consider various other factors required for the creation and sustenance of life, including the impact that a nearby supernova may have on life's development. In 1981, Jim Clarke proposed that the apparent lack of extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way {{could be explained by}} Seyfert-type outbursts from an active galactic nucleus, with Earth alone being spared from this radiation by virtue of its location in the galaxy. In the same year, Wallace Hampton Tucker analyzed galactic habitability in a more general context, but later work superseded <b>his</b> <b>proposals.</b>|$|E
