40|$|Part 13 : Design Science and Business Models - Design Science ResearchInternational audienceThis study explores {{strategic}} agility of an automotive {{corporate group}} {{and its influence}} on facility layouts and operational performance. Strategic agility is viewed here as a firm’s strategic intent to achieve agile operations through collaboratively deploying the layouts {{of a set of}} facilities, driven by a management focus on improving its responsiveness and adaptability to customers’ requirements. Our “collaborative multi-facility layout problem” involves the physical organization of departments between and inside several facilities geographically dispersed, that collaborate in manufacturing a complex product in a given time window. The model proposed in this work allows us to analyse the benefits of new horizontal collaboration forms with respect to several objectives, namely costs (material handling inside and between facilities, re-layout) and adjacency between departments. A case study of a <b>first</b> <b>tier</b> <b>supplier</b> in the automotive industry shows the applicability potential of the approach to real-life problems.

40|$|The world {{automotive}} industry has evolved through different manufacturing methodologies over many decades. It originated from craft production, but was transformed to mass production by Henry Ford {{in response to}} increased market demand. The methodology developed by Henry Ford {{made it possible to}} produce quality vehicles in large numbers and at affordable cost to the general public. However, it cannot deliver a great variety of products to the marketplace. Mass production was overtaken by a new automotive manufacturing methodology developed in Japan after World War II. The methodology, commonly referred to as lean production, yields consistently high quality products at even lower costs, whilst being able to deliver a variety of products to the consumer. The effectiveness of the lean production methodology hinges upon the strength and closeness of the relationships that exist between the assembler and its suppliers. Different models have been developed over time to describe the relationships between automotive assemblers and their suppliers. The lean supply model is generally accepted as an effective way of describing the relationships that exist between an automotive assembler and its <b>first</b> <b>tier</b> <b>suppliers</b> in a lean manufacturing environment. The research study aims at gaining an improved understanding of the relationships that exist between a selected Eastern Cape automotive assembler and its <b>first</b> <b>tier</b> <b>suppliers.</b> The effect of its supplier support practices towards lean manufacturing implementation amongst its <b>first</b> <b>tier</b> <b>suppliers</b> is evaluated.

But hidden behind the clean surface of Apple’s advanced gadgets lies a dirty world of work. This paper focuses on the dark side of the information age by looking at working conditions in the workshops of Apple’s contract manufacturers in China. For this purpose I suggest a systematic model of working conditions that can be used for assessing and comparing work in different industries. Departing from Karl Marx’s circuit of capital it identifies elements that shape working conditions throughout the capital accumulation process including productive forces, relations of production, the production process, products, and labour legislation. Subsequently I apply this model to the realm of electronics manufac-turing. Based on research conducted by corporate watchdogs this paper provides detailed insights into the work and life reality of workers in Apple’s <b>first</b> <b>tier</b> <b>supplier</b> factories.

40|$|International audienceThe {{performance}} of mixed-model assembly lines used in sectors {{such as the}} automotive industry depends on theavailability {{of a large number}} of components that have to be supplied to the line on time and at minimum cost. Insuch settings, components may have different features such as volume, weight, bill of material coefficient, etc. Additionally, a given component may have several alternative variants among which a single one is used in theassembly of end products. Each variant is thus characterized by a varying degree of usage rate. Hence, thediversity of parts requires the selection of the best assembly line feeding mode that aims at minimizing theaverage total operating cost which mainly consists of labor costs associated with parts preparation beforeassembly, transportation to the line, picking operations during assembly, as well as parts storage cost. This paperproposes an optimization model that assigns each individual component to the most efficient line feeding modeamong three alternatives which are line stocking, kitting and sequencing modes. The developed mixed integerprogram is applied to a <b>first</b> <b>tier</b> <b>supplier</b> plant in the automotive sector.

This study aims {{to find out how}} apparel and footwear brands implement environmental management in their supply chain. Furthermore, what motivates them to carry out environmental management, and lastly, what challenges the industry encounters in carrying out effective environmental management. Primary and secondary data research were carried out in this study. Primary research, in a form of self-administered survey, was conducted for 11 brands and 15 of their respective suppliers. Secondary research was conducted through desktop research to gather additional information from brands, NGOs, academic studies and news. The study revealed environmental management in apparel and footwear supply chain is becoming more important. However, most of the brands’ approaches on environmental management are loose (i. e. lack industry-wide sustainably environmental management strategy), and small in scope (i. e. <b>first</b> <b>tier</b> <b>supplier</b> only).

40|$|This report {{presents}} the research performed at Center of Excellence Design for Robustness at GKN Aerospace, Trollhättan, Sweden. GKN Aerospace is a <b>first</b> <b>tier</b> <b>supplier</b> for manufacturing of components for civil and military aircrafts, and space propulsion. In manufacturing industries, variation {{is inevitable and}} can occasionally affect products and processes with undesirable consequences. To handle variation in manufacturing, {{it has to be}} measured and understood. The baseline for this research has been to, on a holistic perspective, identify and depict insufficiencies in the current measurement systems´ ability to generate feedback from the manufacturing processes for initiation of continuous process improvement efforts. Apprehending information from the measurement systems feedback allows personnel to engender knowledge about the processes inflicting variation and behavior. Enquiring this knowledge is a major prerequisite for a fact-based decision strategy for correct improvement adjustments. When the feedback and generation of information is insufficient, data-associated projects are captivated to achieve their stated objectives of improvements. By merging knowledge from theoretical and practical fields, improvement proposals were conducted in an aggregated model consisting of principles, practices and tools. The practical proposals recommends to disintegrate the manufacturing process into sub-process steps, and apply a registering approach towards the production flow. The theoretical proposals strive to illuminate practices and tools to embed in order to achieve disintegrated elements of the overarching goal, namely the principles to strive for. By the conducted model and the empirical study, the result of the research answered two elements within the aim of the study, namely to describe the current state and develop an enhanced future state for the measurement system.

40|$|Industrial {{globalisation}} and {{the increased}} complexity of products promote new product development (NPD) by distributed teams. These teams facilitate the transfer of designs to manufacturing facilities, the adaptation of products to local markets and the access to engineering design talents. However, there are many industrial experiences of under performing distributed teams, such as {{the development of the}} Ford Mondeo which ran a year late and cost £ 4 billion. This Engineering Doctorate project CETGI (Concurrent Engineering and Teamwork across Global Industries) aimed to investigate and advise companies on the enabling practices of global concurrent engineering (GCE). An assessment tool for GCE was developed, embedding its enabling practices in a knowledge base and providing structured advice to manufacturing companies of electro-mechanical products. Preliminary investigation was conducted towards the development of the CETGI tool: literature review on GCE; a benchmark study of nine current concurrent engineering assessment tools; a comparative analysis of NPD practices in the UK and the USA; a survey of NPD practices of global companies developing products in the UK; and thirteen case studies of GCE projects. The CETGI tool was then developed, consisting of an assessment process involving multifunctional teams and executives. CETGI is different to previous tools because of its knowledge base of GCE practices and its three analytical algorithms: the first, aggregates the individual answers; the second, provides a customised list of prioritised actions; and the third, generates maturity charts, providing a performance perspective and supporting benchmarking. Another novel feature of CETGI is the Internet enabled software application that supports its assessment process. The latter software is a multi-participant decision-making support system. The CETGI tool has been applied to three <b>first</b> <b>tier</b> <b>supplier</b> companies, two from the automotive industry and one from the transport industry aimed at fine-tuning and validating the tool.

40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} to the Luton Business School, University of Luton, in fulfilment ofthe requirements for the degree of Doctor of PhilosophySuccessful Concurrent Engineering (CE) with suppliers requires a pre-disposition {{on the part of}} the prime company and the supplier to work in this manner. This thesis explores the impact of design ethos on the implementation of Supplier-inLoop (SIL) CE between an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and a <b>first</b> <b>tier</b> <b>supplier.</b> Design ethos for the purpose of this thesis is described as 'a characteristic manner or approach to constraints on SIL displayed by personnel involved in the design of new products'. This research employs a mixed-method to understand SIL constraints across industry sectors. A design ethos framework is developed and a military design community is characterised in terms of anomalies to the existing literature. These anomalies are then tested through a questionnaire and then interpreted in terms of the design ethos framework. The results of this comparison show that some characteristics are common to both the civil and military design communities and some are not. A case is made that design ethos, in the context of SIL, is primarily determined by: suppliers' aptitude, skill level and contracts; problems with data I information exchange mechanisms; existing processes, relationships and management support; supplier history; technological view of the product; external influences on the process; existing design milestones; visibility of supplier capability; and, continuity of service in terms of skill and data security. The research concludes that the implementation of SIL is directly impacted by design ethos, and that for SIL to be a success in the military sector design ethos must be managed in line with business objectives. The contribution to knowledge that this thesis provides is the insight it offers into the human issues associated with implementing concurrent engineering with external suppliers, and the identification of sector-specific issues as well as those which will benefit from cross sectoral learning. It is of value to military and civil OEMs for purpose of change management, also to their suppliers in understanding the different needs of military and civil customers when working in a concurrent engmeenng manner...|$|E
40|$|GKN Aerospace is the <b>first</b> <b>tier</b> <b>supplier</b> to {{the global}} {{aviation}} industry and produces products with a great complexity and quality. However, GKN is as many other producing companies confronted with internal reoccurring problems in the manufacturing. Reoccurring problems consume resources in terms of material and time for the employees. This case study was made with the purpose to identify possible improvement areas for the problem solving process at GKN {{in order to make}} it more robust. GKN are aware of that they have reoccurring non-conformances in manufacturing, they are measured, but the level is quiet constant. Through interviews, survey and review of internal documents the researchers found that there is room for improvement for the information collected and documentation. The initial documentation of non-conformances is sometimes poor. In addition, the problem characterisation made in the documentation template PPL is occasionally performed poorly, lacking useful information. The following root cause analysis has sometimes shortcomings in the method of breaking down the causes to identify the root cause. The literature study made suggests a more extensive way of working with the root cause analysis tool 5 Why, compared to how GKN works today. By studying the prerequisites to identify the root cause the authors found some possibilities for improvements. More time is needed for problem solving. Currently the time is insufficient, 95 % of the Production Engineers agree upon this. Further, the Operators must be more incorporated in the problem solving to understand the purpose of performing a good problem solving. They need to get proper education on the subject in addition to their expertise. In general the thesis concerns the understanding of how information is used and affects the problem solving as a whole. At GKN training is needed to emphasize the importance of problem characterization, to be able to identify root causes for problems. What GKN gains on illuminating focus on the problem characterization, the problem descriptions and the root cause analysis with improved prerequisites, is that GKN improves the process of identifying root causes of problems and thereby can avoid reoccurring non-conformances...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSince {{the seminal}} work of J. March (1991), {{balancing}} exploration and exploitation activities is an important topic in management research. Though the literature is abundant on the management of exploitation activities, exploration activities remain a much less studied area. How should be compared and contrasted: exploration activity, R&D, new product development project and advance engineering? This is central to understand the specificities of exploration processes. In this paper we propose to dig into the exploration process based on the comparison between two case study researches. These longitudinal researches were conducted in two different firms in the automotive industry, one in a <b>first</b> <b>tier</b> <b>supplier</b> company (Ben Mahmoud-Jouini, 2 Charue-Duboc and Fourcade 2007), the second in an OEM company (Lenfle and Midler 2003). These two companies created an entity specifically in charge of exploring novel innovative opportunities in a specified but broad field. The mission of these entities was to identify novel opportunities that could support the existing business in changing or expanding their scope but not in creating an entirely new business. In order to dig into exploration processes, we propose to delineate more precisely the specificities of these exploratory entities. We stress three dimensions: (i) five characteristics of the “situation” the team of the exploratory entities face (the strategic issues raised, {{the purpose of the}} exploration, the type of results expected, the time span, the approach) (ii) five activities undertaken within the entities (creativity processes, external communication, interactions with the customer, formulation of a technological strategy, analysis of acquisition targets) (iii) and the organizational design that supported these activities. Based on these cases, we highlight an interplay between exploration and exploitation activities. Hence, on the one hand the exploratory entity relies largely on the competences and expertise located in the existing business of the firm on the other hand the entity develops new knowledge either on technology new to the company or on market that are useful for the established divisions of the company and used by them. We raise the question of the evolution of the boundaries between exploratory entities {{and the rest of the}} firm across time, which remains open in the literature. Hence, exploratory entities are not necessarily designed to develop innovative products up to their commercialization. Rather the latest phases of new product development can be transferred to more exploitative entities...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} aims at {{contributing to}} the {{knowledge of how to}} effectively and efficiently integrate materials supply system (MSS) design at an early stage of product development projects (PDPs) and how to effectively and efficiently design the MSS in parallel with the product {{and the rest of the}} production system. The increasing interest in and importance of shortening product development times have underlined the necessity of working with overlapping activities in PDPs, i. e. concurrent engineering. In the literature it has been argued that MSS design should form one dimension of concurrent engineering and be coordinated with product and production systems design, where preliminary and partial information is released and used as it emerges. However, the research on the integration of MSS design into PDPs is fragmented. It is limited to one MSS design area (e. g. packaging), to the discussion of some MSS design areas as parts of the production system without considering these in relation to PDPs, or else focuses on coordinating decisions related to one or a few specific questions at a time (e. g. postponement structure and product architecture) without any reference to PDPs. The research presented in this thesis is based on literature studies on the subjects of materials supply, production systems design, design and development processes and PDPs as well as on three case studies conducted at two companies within the automotive industry; two studies at an end producer and one study at a <b>first</b> <b>tier</b> <b>supplier.</b> An MSS design process has been developed in order to achieve systematic MSS design as well as its integration at an early stage of PDPs, thus allowing the MSS to be designed in parallel with the product and the rest of the production system. The design process is structured in accordance with the following phases: Planning, Concept development, System-level design, and Detail design. The MSS is modelled with materials flows as sub systems and six design areas as components. The six design areas are materials feeding, storage, transportation, handling, packaging, and manufacturing planning and control. In addition, difficulties related to release and use of information for MSS design during PDPs as well as approaches for dealing with them are described and categorised. Attention is drawn to the fact that several of the difficulties experienced by MSS designers are not related to a concurrent engineering context with overlapping activities but to release and use of information between different departments on a more general level. It has also been underlined that responsibility for improving information management rests both with the MSS designers and with those who produce the information required for the MSS design as well as with the company as a whole...|$|E
40|$|The {{construction}} {{industry has been}} accused of being, at its worst, wasteful, inefficient and ineffective, wasting over £ 1 billion in 1999 due to errors and rework (Nicholson, 1999). Competitive pressures from within industry, as well as external political, economic and other considerations are forcing the industry to re-examine and improve its modus operandi (Anumba et al, 2000). The message is that to survive and prosper, the industry must change its management and practice. Nevertheless it took the publication of both the Latham (1994) and Egan (1998) Reports, both advocating the use of performance measurement, for the industry to recognise that it needed to modernise in order to tackle the severe problems facing it. However, in order for it to improve, the Construction Industry is faced with a bewildering range of business improvement models and approaches, all with their unique features, to use on their quality journey, all proclaiming to improve organisational capability and results. Hence, the aim of this research is to provide guidance on how these business improvement models and approaches can be used to support and improve bottom-line results to achieve business excellence. The scope of this research is to focus on three industry sectors and companies: Construction (Morgan Est Pic), automotive (Lear, a <b>first</b> <b>tier</b> <b>supplier)</b> and aerospace (Rolls Royce), as proof of concepts. An analysis of the overlap between the business improvement models and approaches, conducted in the literature review, confirms the need for this research. The initial concept adopted in this research is to pursue and evaluate the most popular business improvement models; ISO 9001; the European Foundation for Quality Management (EFQM) Excellence Model and the American Baldrige Model and the business improvement approaches such as Total Quality Management (TQM), Business Improvement Review (BPIR), Six Sigma and other "tools" that help Managers understand the business, such as Balanced Scorecards and the Process Classification Framework (PCR). Accordingly, a theoretical evaluation model was developed to demonstrate where the approaches support the business improvement models. The model was subjected to the empirical feedback of expert interviews and case studies and to confirm its suitability for use within the {{construction industry}}. The now developed evaluation model demonstrated that these models and approaches are "TQM" with ISO 9001 providing the support and consistency between them all. Furthermore, the results of a questionnaire survey revealed that ISO 9001 can be the starting point for the journey towards world-class performance. It provides the platform for taking the organisation forward by achieving control over leadership, customer focus and continual improvement. However, it needs to be implemented with a view to excellence rather than compliance. The main finding from this research is that the construction sector still needs to provide major investment in improvement models and approaches to deliver bottom-line results and achieve business excellence.

Nevertheless it took the publication of both the Latham (1994) and Egan (1998) Reports, both advocating the use of performance measurement, for the industry to recognise that it needed to modernise in order to tackle the severe problems facing it. However, in order for it to improve, the Construction Industry is faced with a bewildering range of business improvement models and approaches, all with their unique features, to use on their quality journey, all proclaiming to improve organisational capability and results. Hence, the aim of this research is to provide guidance on how these business improvement models and approaches can be used to support and improve bottom-line results to achieve business excellence. The scope of this research is to focus on three industry sectors and companies: Construction (Morgan Est Pic), automotive (Lear, a <b>first</b> <b>tier</b> <b>supplier)</b> and aerospace (Rolls Royce), as proof of concepts. An analysis of the overlap between the business improvement models and approaches, conducted in the literature review, confirms the need for this research. The initial concept adopted in this research is to pursue and evaluate the most popular business improvement models; ISO 9001; the European Foundation for Quality Management (EFQM) Excellence Model and the American Baldrige Model and the business improvement approaches such as Total Quality Management (TQM), Business Improvement Review (BPIR), Six Sigma and other "tools" that help Managers understand the business, such as Balanced Scorecards and the Process Classification Framework (PCR). Accordingly, a theoretical evaluation model was developed to demonstrate where the approaches support the business improvement models. The model was subjected to the empirical feedback of expert interviews and case studies and to confirm its suitability for use within the construction industry. The now developed evaluation model demonstrated that these models and approaches are "TQM" with ISO 9001 providing the support and consistency between them all. Furthermore, the results of a questionnaire survey revealed that ISO 9001 can be the starting point for the journey towards world-class performance. It provides the platform for taking the organisation forward by achieving control over leadership, customer focus and continual improvement. However, it needs to be implemented with a view to excellence rather than compliance. The main finding from this research is that the construction sector still needs to provide major investment in improvement models and approaches to deliver bottom-line results and achieve business excellence...|$|E
40|$|The Czech Republic {{has succeeded}} in {{building}} a new comparative advantage in the motor vehicle and motor component production. Yet the Czech-owned companies only weakly contribute to the Czech upgrading. The Czech-owned companies are totally absent from the <b>first</b> <b>tier</b> <b>suppliers</b> and are only linked by casual technological relationships to foreign-owned multinational subsidiaries. This kind of relationship limits the vertical spillovers from foreign-owned multinational subsidiaries and {{is responsible for the}} existence of a weak link in the Czech automotive system that may foster the relocation of foreign-owned subsidiaries in foreign countries...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{focuses on}} the main {{question}} as to whether clustering enhances companies performance. It explores the various linkages of knowledge flow in the Jababeka Industrial Cluster, Indonesia. The research is based on semi- structured interviews and ethnographic fieldwork. Specifically {{there are two types of}} linkages in the Jababeka cluster. The first is the vertical hierarchical linkage cultivated by the Keiretsu between automaker and <b>first</b> <b>tier</b> <b>suppliers,</b> the second is the horizontal linkage between second tier and third tier industries. These linkages form clusters within clusters. However the horizontal linkage between academia and industry is limited and restricted...|$|R
