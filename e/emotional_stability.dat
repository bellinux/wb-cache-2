During the day, Truman notices strange occurrences that all seem {{centered}} on him (a falling spotlight, rain that only falls on him). Truman spots a disheveled man and recognizes him as his father, who had snuck back into the set, but actors quickly drag the man away. Despite efforts by Meryl and Truman's best friend Marlon to reassure Truman, Truman becomes even more suspicious about his life. One day, he takes Meryl by surprise by going on an impromptu road trip, but their way is blocked by apparent and increasingly implausible emergencies. Meryl begins to break down from the stress, and during an argument with Truman, breaks character and is later taken off the show. Truman, depressed and confused, is consoled by Marlon, and Christof uses the opportunity to re-introduce Truman's father to the show properly, {{under the guise of}} having lost his memory after the boating accident, in the hope of bringing Truman back to some <b>emotional</b> <b>stability</b> and a controllable state.|$|E

40|$|Given that sexually {{offensive}} {{behavior on}} the part of people with intellectual disabilities has been identified as a significant problem, we developed a risk assessment questionnaire, that takes not only various static and dynamic factors into account but also environmental risk variables. Psychologists and staff members completed this Risk lnventarization Scale on Sexually Offensive Behavior of Clients with Intellectual Disabilities for 56 intellectually disabled clients with sexually offensive behavior problems. The scale contains static client variables (rated using two- or five-point likert scales and open questions) and both dynamic client and environmental variables (rated using a five-point likert scale). Factor analyses of the dynamic client and environmental variables revealed three subscales: quality of supervision, offending behavior and <b>emotional</b> and social <b>stability.</b> Reliability analyses showed sufficient to good reliability for both the total scale (r = 0. 82) and the identified subscales (quality of guidance r = 0. 94; offending behavior r= 0. 75, and <b>emotional</b> and social <b>stability</b> r = 0. 58). Correlational analyses of the quality of guidance subscale showed high positive correlations with such static variables as values and norms, living conditions, and criminal offenses in early youth. Because both dynamic and environmental variables can be altered, the implications for treatment of the sexually offensive behavior of clients with intellectual disabilities are discussed further...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Pastoral)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. The {{research}} on pastoral counseling of persons struggling with complex trauma was undertaken {{with the aim}} of designing a practice-orientated model for pastoral counseling in order to guide such persons to <b>emotional</b> healing, <b>stability</b> and spiritual growth. An exegetical study throws light on the role of prayer and trust in God. One can entrust to God one's problems and one's supplication for help in the firm belief that He will provide a way out. An investigation into counseling perspectives in the Scriptures and in the literature on Christian counseling brought to light that pastoral counseling, which is a mandate given to believers, affords a unique opportunity for lovingly encouraging and consoling people with complex trauma. Contributions by psychiatry and psychology emphasise the phase approach. They stress security and stability, the processing of the traumatic memory and mourning, as well as a renewed commitment to new relationships. The core of the findings is that persons with complex trauma - which is an intricate syndrome relating to a spectrum of post-traumatic disturbances following intense, protracted and repeated trauma - can be guided by pastoral counseling to <b>emotional</b> healing, <b>stability</b> and spiritual growth. Specific reference is made to victims of prolonged family violence and/or physical and/or emotional and/or sexual abuse and/or protracted physical and/or emotional neglect in family context. The empirical research confirmed that the children of the Abraham Krielkinderhuis, Potchefstroom, who were subjected to these traumatic experiences in their parental homes exhibit the typical symptomatology of complex trauma. These entail emotional disturbances like anger and self-injury, disturbances of consciousness like dissociation, disturbances of self-image like stigma, guilt and shame, disturbances {{in the image of the}} perpetrator, like unrealistic expectations and finally disturbances in relationships like distrust and loss of faith. The principles and outcome of the empirical research are eventually applicable to all persons struggling with complex trauma. A practice-orientated counseling model was designed which focuses on stabilisation and security, the processing of the traumatic memory and mourning, as well as a renewed commitment to life in abundance and new relationships. In this therapeutic relationship of faith the distress narrative and the narrative of the past are central. God allows everything to turn out for the best for those who trust in Him. In Christ people are more than victors through God's will for their lives. Doctora...|$|R

40|$|Background Bipolar Spectrum Disorder (BPSD) is {{associated}} with changes in self-related processing and affect, yet the relationship between self-image and affect in the BPSD phenotype is unclear. Methods 47 young adults were assessed for hypomanic experiences (BPSD phenotype) using the Mood Disorders Questionnaire. Current and future self-images (e. g. I am… I will be…) were generated and rated for <b>emotional</b> valence, <b>stability,</b> and (for future self-images only) certainty. The relationship between self-image ratings and measures of affect (depression, anxiety and mania) were analysed {{in relation to the}} BPSD phenotype. Results The presence of the BPSD phenotype significantly moderated the relationship between (1) affect and stability ratings for negative self-images, and (2) affect and certainty ratings for positive future self-images. Higher positivity ratings for current self-images were associated with lower depression and anxiety scores. Limitations This was a non-clinical group of young adults sampled for hypomanic experiences, which limits the extension of the work to clinical levels of psychopathology. This study cannot address the causal relationships between affect, self-images, and BPSD. Future work should use clinical samples and experimental mood manipulation designs. Conclusions BPSD phenotype can shape the relationship between affect and current and future self-images.

Secondly, relationship enhancing traits (e.g. trust, affiliation) are important for subjective well-being. Happy people tend to have strong relationships and be good at fostering them. Thirdly, the way people think about and explain events is important for subjective well-being. Appraising events in an optimistic fashion, having a sense of control, and making active coping efforts facilitates subjective well-being. Trust, a trait substantially related to SWB, as opposed to cynicism involves making positive rather than negative attributions about others. Making positive, optimistic attributions rather than negative pessimistic ones facilitates subjective well-being.|$|E

25|$|Melodic Intonation Therapy is used {{to treat}} non-fluent aphasia and {{has proved to be}} {{effective}} in some cases. However, there is still no evidence from randomized controlled trials confirming the efficacy of MIT in chronic aphasia. MIT {{is used to}} help people with aphasia vocalize themselves through speech song, which is then transferred as a spoken word. Good candidates for this therapy include left hemisphere stroke patients, non-fluent aphasias such as Broca's, good auditory comprehension, poor repetition and articulation, and good <b>emotional</b> <b>stability</b> and memory. It has been hypothesized that MIT is effective because prosody and singing both rely on areas of the right hemisphere; it may be these right-hemisphere areas that are recruited for natural speech production after intensive training. An alternative explanation is that the efficacy of MIT depends on neural circuits involved in the processing of rhythmicity and formulaic expressions (examples taken from the MIT manual: “I am fine,” “how are you?” or “thank you”); while rhythmic features associated with melodic intonation may engage primarily left-hemisphere subcortical areas of the brain, the use of formulaic expressions is known to be supported by right-hemisphere cortical and bilateral subcortical neural networks.|$|E
25|$|As earlier stated, extraverts {{are often}} {{found to have}} higher levels of {{happiness}} and positive affect than introverts. An influential review article concluded that personality, specifically extraversion and <b>emotional</b> <b>stability,</b> was the best predictor of subjective well-being. As examples, Argyle and Lu (1990) found that the trait of extraversion, as measured by Extraversion Scale of the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ), was positively and significantly correlated with happiness, as measured by the Oxford Happiness Inventory. Using the same happiness and extraversion scales, Hills and Argyle (2001) found that happiness was again significantly correlated with extraversion. Also, the study by Emmons and Diener (1986) showed that extraversion correlates positively and significantly with positive affect but not with negative affect. Similar results were found in a large longitudinal study by Diener, Sandvik, Pavot, and Fujita (1992), which assessed 14,407 participants from 100 areas of continental United States. Using the abbreviated General Well-Being Schedule, which tapped positive and negative affects, and Costa and McCrae's (1986) short version of the NEO's Extraversion scale, the authors reported that extraverts experienced greater well-being at two points in time, during which data were collected: first between 1971 and 1975, and later between 1981 and 1984. Furthermore, Larsen and Ketelaar (1991) showed that extraverts respond more to positive affect than to negative affect, since they exhibit more positive-affect reactivity to the positive-affect induction, yet they do not react more negatively to the negative-affect induction.|$|E
