He was the {{youngest}} ever cabinet member from the Christian Democratic Party, and the first Christian Democratic to hold the post. The second cabinet Bondevik did not survive the 2005 elections, and as such Hareide <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>step</b> down from office that year. His successor was Helen Bjørnøy. Until 2009, Hareide had never been elected to the Norwegian Parliament, but served as a deputy representative during the terms 19972001, 20012005 and 20052009.

Along with the Diocese of Nicopoli headed by Filip Stanislavov, Marcianopolis {{was one of the}} two sees which succeeded the Bulgarian Custody as the governing body of Catholicism in Bulgaria. Parchevich also held the position of Bulgarian internuncio to the Viennese court. In 1661, Parchevich <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>step</b> down as Archbishop of Marcianopolis due to pressure from Rome, which condemned his clerical inactivity, though in 1668 he became apostolic vicar to Moldavia despite continuing suspicion.|$|E

5|$|The third {{series of}} Spooks was {{produced}} by Kudos Film and Television for the BBC. Much of the production crew from the first two series returned. New crew members were brought in with the requirement that they were fans of the series and have ambition, {{so that they can}} understand Spooks. Andrew Woodhead was the series producer, with Jane Featherstone, Simon Crawford Collins and Gareth Neame as executive producers. Collins, who was the producer for the first two series, <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>step</b> back to executive producer, as he was overcommitted producing Kudos crime series Hustle. Woodhead replaced him as he was accustomed to the show, but also added more vitality to the show. Christopher Aird was the assistant producer. The third series included five writers. Howard Brenton wrote the first, second and eighth episodes. Rupert Walters wrote the third and ninth episodes. Ben Richards wrote the fourth, sixth and tenth episodes. Richards previously wrote the ninth episode of series two, and accepted the offer to return. His script in the second series was his first script for television; he found writing easier as time went by. Raymond Khoury wrote the seventh episode. Series creator David Wolstencroft wrote the fifth episode. Wolstencroft was poised to write the next episode, but found himself committed to other projects.|$|E
5|$|Maribor {{football}} club {{was founded on}} 12 December 1960. The board of the newly established club then organized the presidential elections and Dr. Srečko Koren was appointed as the first club president, while Andrija Pflander was appointed as the first head coach and Oto Blaznik as the first team captain. The club played their first match on 5 February 1961, when they defeated city rivals Kovinar 2–1 (0–0), with Stefan Tolič scoring both goals. Although the team colours, purple and white, were chosen from the beginning, the team played its first match in a green and blue combination, as their violet jerseys were not available {{in time for the}} first match. The team won the Slovenian Republic League (third tier of Yugoslav football) in their first season and therefore won the right to contest the qualifications for the Yugoslav Second League. Andrija Pflander was the head coach of the team that won the Republic league. However, he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>step</b> down from the position right {{before the start of the}} promotion play-off due to illness. His successor was Vladimir Šimunić, the man who eventually guided the team to their promotion to the Yugoslav First League six years later. Maribor won the first two rounds of the qualifying play-off and eventually defeated Croatian side Uljanik from Pula in the final qualifying phase with the score 2–1 on aggregate, therefore securing the right to play in the second Yugoslav division.|$|E

25|$|Like many {{psychiatric}} hospitals, Dixmont became overcrowded {{during the}} 1920s {{due to the}} rise of PTSD patients from World War I. The hospital took in as many patients as they could fit until beds lined the hallways, but was eventually forced to stop accepting new admissions. Dixmont began experiencing financial difficulties as early as the Great Depression where they could only afford to supply employees with room and board; no salary. In 1946, the PA Department of Welfare <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>step</b> in and Dixmont became a state-owned hospital. During this time, the hospital began using previously decried procedures such as lobotomies, electro-shock therapy, and use of restraints.|$|E
25|$|The {{creation}} of the Home Guard (initially as the Local Defence Volunteers) following Anthony Eden's broadcast appeal to the Nation on Tuesday 14 May 1940 also created further demand for arms production to equip this new force. BSA, as the only rifle producer in Britain, <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>step</b> up to the mark and the workforce voluntarily went onto a seven-day week. Motorcycle production was also stepped up from 500 to 1,000 machines per week which meant a finished machine coming off the production line every 5 minutes. The motorcycle department had been left intact in 1939 due to demand which was doubled following Dunkirk. At the same time BSA staff were providing lectures and demonstrations on motorcycle riding and maintenance to 250,000 officers and men {{in all parts of}} the UK.|$|E
25|$|Although the Boeing design {{had been}} the first to enter series production, the 247 proved to have some serious design deficiencies. Air {{carriers}} considered its limited capacity a drawback since it carried only ten passengers, in five rows with a seat {{on each side of the}} aisle, as well as a flight attendant. Compared to the more spacious DC-2 and later DC-3, the passenger count was too few to make it a commercially viable airliner. Another feature influencing passenger comfort was that the 247's main wing spar ran through the cabin, so persons moving through the cabin <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>step</b> over it. The Lockheed Model 10 Electra had a similar configuration and while it was a more compact design, the Electra managed to carry the same number of passengers at a slightly better overall performance, and more importantly, at a lower cost-per-mile.|$|E
