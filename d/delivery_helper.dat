40|$|Background: Although the {{important}} of breast milk {{has been well}} known world wide, the number of exclusive breastfeeding is still low in most countries, including Indonesia. This research objective is to identify social demography characteristic {{and the influence of}} breast milk and weaning food information to 6 months exclusive breastfeeding in West Sumatera. Methods: Cross-sectional study design has been used. Population of this study was house holds and samples that had been chosen by simple randomized were mothers who had a baby aged 6 – 12 months (n = 637). Variables that had been analyzed were sample identity, information factor of breast milk and weaning food promotion and other supportive factors. To compare categorical variable which was respondent characteristic of exclusive breast milk and non-exclusive breast milk group, chi-square test had been used. Results: It is found a significant relationship between having information about breast milk and weaning food status and breastfeeding practice. Also it shows a significant relationship between colostrum feeding status and the continuing breastfeeding practice. However, there is no significant relationship between social-demography characteristic and the place of getting breast milk/weaning food information, the information for breast milk/weaning food, interpersonal contact about breast milk/weaning food and type of media information about breast milk/weaning food and breast feeding practice. Conclusion: having information of breast milk/weaning food, also colostrum feeding status are factors that influence breastfeeding status in West Sumatera. However, the place and medical birth <b>delivery</b> <b>helper</b> have less association to exclusive breast feeding practice.   Key words: Exclusive breastfeeding, Breast milk and Weaning Food information, Social-demograhy Characteristic</p...|$|E
30|$|In section 4.2. 1 {{we compare}} the {{distribution}} of PDs across freight vehicles that parked in different locations: we observe that durations of freight vehicles parked at the LB are significantly different from those parked on-street and inside the carpark. We then focus {{the rest of the}} analysis only on the PDs for the vehicles that parked in the LB and plot its distribution in section 4.2. 2 and identify the lognormal distribution as the best fit to the data. Section 4.2. 3 analyses the time series of PDs of individual freight vehicles and introduce the concept of weak stationarity. Finally, in Section 4.2. 4 we perform a regression analysis on the log(PD) over multiple observed variables (size of <b>delivery,</b> number of <b>helpers</b> etc.) to shed light on which factors explain longer durations.|$|R
40|$|Two central issues {{relevant}} to services delivered to older adults {{by family members}} (including extended family) were analyzed: the method used in delivering the services and the geographic proximity required to deliver the service. The analysis involved a study of 1, 400 people aged 65 and over and 800 of their <b>helpers.</b> <b>Delivery</b> of services was categorized according to. telephone or face-to-face; the frequency of each was measured. Services were categorized as "household " (housekeeping, paying bills, making repairs) and "normal kin " (checking on persons, bringing meals, giving gifts, talking {{to them when they}} are depressed). The farther away the helper lived, the smaller the proportion who received household help. By contrast, kinship services were far less affected by geographic distance. Also, in terms of geographic proximity, it appears that when older people were both sick and single, they wer...|$|R
40|$|The {{experiments}} {{described in}} this paper show that activated B cells can deliver help for antiviral cytotoxic T (Tc) cell responses in vitro. This conclusion is based on four observations. (i) Influenza viruses induced secondary Tc cell responses in vitro {{in the absence of}} CD 4 + T cells. This capacity correlated with the B-cell mitogenicity of these viruses. (ii) Depletion of both CD 4 + T cells and B cells prevented the generation of anti-influenza Tc cell responses, whereas depletion of either CD 4 + T cells or B cells alone failed to do so. In addition, supplementation of unprimed B cells restored the Tc cell responsiveness of primed splenocytes that had been depleted of both CD 4 + T cells and B cells. (iii) Contact between T and B cells was not obligatory for the <b>delivery</b> of B-cell <b>helper</b> signal, and hence help was mediated by a soluble factor(s). (iv) Lipopolysaccharide-activated B cells could replace the CD 4 + T-cell requirement in the induction of Tc cell responses to nonmitogenic influenza virus in vitro...|$|R
40|$|Biomaterials {{provide a}} unique {{opportunity}} to control the display, release, and in vivo trafficking of vaccine components. We have designed and characterized a system for vaccine delivery that uses a "lipid surfactants" approach to combine a degradable polymer core with a two-dimensionally fluid lipid bilayer shell. Using optical and electron microscopy, we characterized the distribution, lamellarity, nanostructure, and mobility of the lipid shell. Single, tightly apposed bilayers could be formed around either microparticles or nanoparticles, mimicking bacteria or viruses in size. Alternative nanostructures could be formed at different lipid concentrations and compositions, such as multilamellar lipid "onions" stacked against a polymer core, or lipid "flowers" with petal-like projections emanating from a polymer core. The lipid nanostructure was characterized during the process of emulsion and solvent evaporation, and during degradation by hydrolysis. Design of this carrier was guided foremost by the goal of properly displaying minimal peptide epitopes from the Membrane-Proximal External Region of HIV gp 41 (MPER) and enhancing their immunogenicity. Display within a lipid context was needed to provide the chemical environment appropriate for neutralizing antibodies, such as 4 E 10, to bind efficiently. Multifunctional vaccines were created through a combination of multivalent display, <b>delivery</b> of <b>helper</b> stimuli, and insertion of lipophilic adjuvant molecules in the lipid shell. We further explored the ability of this system to potentiate humoral immune responses against recombinant protein vaccines, using ovalbumin as a model antigen. In studies of both cellular and humoral immune responses, we found that lipid-coated microparticles co-displaying protein and lipophilic adjuvant molecules could potentiate immune responses in vivo. Notably, we found that the dose-sparing capabilities of the particles reached a potency that is seldom reported: a single injection of 2 ng antigen co-displayed on particles with c-galactosylceramide elicited measurable titers, and a prime-boost regimen of 2. 5 ng ovaparticles adjuvanted with monophosphoryl lipid A elicited high titers that were sustained for > 150 days. No studies to our knowledge have reported dose sparing to this degree with titers sustained over time. The mechanism of this dose sparing effect is of great interest, and will be a subject of future work. by Anna Bershteyn. Thesis: Ph.

40|$|Recent {{theory and}} {{empirical}} studies of avian biparental systems suggest that animals resolve conflict over parental care via {{a process of}} behavioral negotiation or “rules for responding. ” Less is known, however, about whether negotiation over helping effort occurs in cooperatively breeding animal societies or whether behavioral negotiation requires a relatively large brain. In this study, we tested whether negotiation over help occurs in a social insect, the paper wasp Polistes dominulus, by recording individual responses to both observed and experimentally induced foraging returns by other group members. In our experiments, we manipulated food delivery to the nest in 2 ways: 1) by catching departing foragers and giving them larval food to take back to the nest and 2) by giving larval food directly to wasps on the nest, which they then fed to larvae, so increasing food <b>delivery</b> independently of <b>helper</b> effort. We found no evidence from Experiment 1 that helpers adjusted their own foraging effort according to the foraging effort of other group members. However, when food was provided directly to the nest, wasps did respond by reducing their own foraging effort. One interpretation of this result is that paper wasp helpers adjust their helping effort according {{to the level of}} offspring need rather than the work rate of other helpers. Negotiation based on indicators of demand rather than work rate is a likely mechanism to resolve conflict over investment in teams where helpers cannot observe each other’s work rate directly, as is commonly the case in insect and vertebrate societies...|$|R
