5|$|In September 1937 the Spitfire prototype, K5054, {{was fitted}} with ejector type <b>exhausts.</b> Later {{marks of the}} Spitfire used a {{variation}} of this exhaust system fitted with forward-facing intake ducts to distribute hot air out to the wing-mounted guns to prevent freezing and stoppages at high altitudes, replacing an earlier system that used heated air from the engine coolant radiator. The latter system had become ineffective due to improvements to the Merlin itself which allowed higher operating altitudes where air temperatures are lower. Ejector <b>exhausts</b> were also fitted to other Merlin-powered aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Like {{previous}} games, Sonic collects golden rings, which {{protect him}} from a single hit by an enemy or obstacle, though they will scatter and blink before disappearing. Sonic starts {{the game with a}} limited number of lives; if he is hit with no rings in his possession, he will lose a life. If a player <b>exhausts</b> their lives, they will receive a game over.|$|E
5|$|The Patrouille Suisse flight {{demonstration}} {{team were}} prominent fliers of the Hawker Hunter for several decades. Squadron aircraft were fitted with smoke generators {{on the engine}} <b>exhausts</b> and, later on, were painted in a distinctive red-and-white livery. The group officially formed on 22 August 1964, and used the Hunter as its display aircraft until it was withdrawn from use in 1994, the team continued to perform flight display using newer aircraft.|$|E
40|$|AbstractExhaust {{efficiency}} in tunnel fires with mechanical means was discussed. Heat <b>exhaust</b> efficiency and smoke <b>exhaust</b> efficiency were defined and studied under two different <b>exhaust</b> modes (longitudinal <b>exhaust</b> and transverse <b>exhaust)</b> respectively. <b>Exhaust</b> efficiency depends on smoke generation rate, <b>exhaust</b> rate, heat loss through walls of tunnel, configuration of extraction installations and so on. Under smoke extraction, smoke <b>exhaust</b> efficiency equals 1 if a quasi-steady vented stage without upstream outflow forms, otherwise smoke <b>exhaust</b> efficiency {{is less than}} 1. Heat <b>exhaust</b> efficiency is always less than 1 since part of the heat released by the fire is lost through the solid boundaries of tunnel by radiative and convective heat transfer between the smoke and ceiling lining. Based on experimental data obtained {{from a series of}} fire tests in a model tunnel, heat <b>exhaust</b> efficiency was estimated and influencing factors were discussed. In tunnel fires with transverse mechanical <b>exhaust</b> system, heat <b>exhaust</b> efficiency varies from 20 % to 50 %. Heat <b>exhaust</b> {{efficiency in}}creases along with the reduction of the number of <b>exhaust</b> inlets turned on while extracting and decreases along with the increase of the area of <b>exhaust</b> inlet. However, quantitative influence of inlet position on <b>exhaust</b> efficiency still need further study and will be reported later...|$|R

50|$|The turbine <b>exhaust</b> ducting and turbine <b>exhaust</b> hoods were of welded {{sheet metal}} construction. Flanges {{utilizing}} dual seals were used at component connections. The <b>exhaust</b> ducting conducted turbine <b>exhaust</b> gases to the thrust chamber <b>exhaust</b> manifold which encircled the combustion chamber approximately {{halfway between the}} throat and the nozzle exit. <b>Exhaust</b> gases passed through the heat exchanger and <b>exhaust</b> into the main combustion chamber through 180 triangular openings between the tubes of the combustion chamber.|$|R
5|$|Titanium metal {{is used in}} {{automotive}} applications, {{particularly in}} automobile and motorcycle racing where low weight and high strength and rigidity are critical. The metal is generally too expensive for the general consumer market, though some late model Corvettes have been manufactured with titanium <b>exhausts,</b> and a Corvette Z06's LT4 supercharged engine uses lightweight, solid titanium intake valves for greater strength and resistance to heat.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the silky shark is viviparous: once the {{developing}} embryo <b>exhausts</b> its supply of yolk, the depleted yolk sac is converted into a placental connection through which the mother delivers nourishment. Relative to other viviparous sharks, the placenta of the silky shark is less similar to the analogous mammalian structure in that no interdigitation exists between the tissues of the fetus and mother. Furthermore, the fetal red blood cells are much smaller than maternal blood cells, which is opposite the pattern seen in mammals. Adult females have a single functional ovary (on the right side) and two functional uteri, which are divided lengthwise into separate compartments for each embryo.|$|E
5|$|MIND MGMT is a {{government}} agency of spies, formed during or after World War I, who have psychic abilities. Henry Lyme is recruited as a child, and becomes their greatest agent. The work <b>exhausts</b> him, and Lyme is retired to Zanzibar. While there, he has a breakdown and loses control of his abilities, causing the city's inhabitants to murder one another. Lyme decides MIND MGMT is too dangerous to exist, and flees. In an effort to cover his escape, he accidentally causes everyone aboard a plane with him to develop amnesia.|$|E

50|$|The {{magnitude}} of the <b>exhaust</b> scavenging effect is a direct function of the velocity of the high and medium pressure components of the <b>exhaust</b> pulse. Performance headers work to increase the <b>exhaust</b> velocity as much as possible. One technique is tuned-length primary tubes. This technique attempts to time the occurrence of each <b>exhaust</b> pulse, to occur {{one after the other}} in succession while still in the <b>exhaust</b> system. The lower pressure tail of an <b>exhaust</b> pulse then serves to create a greater pressure difference between the high pressure head of the next <b>exhaust</b> pulse, thus increasing the velocity of that <b>exhaust</b> pulse. In V6 and V8 engines where {{there is more than one}} <b>exhaust</b> bank, 'Y-pipes' and 'X-pipes' work on the same principle of using the low pressure component of an <b>exhaust</b> pulse to increase the velocity of the next <b>exhaust</b> pulse.|$|R

5|$|The large {{population}} in Antananarivo {{and the high}} density of its residential zones pose challenges to public health, sanitation and access to clean drinking water. Processing and disposal of industrial and residential waste is inadequate. Waste water is often discharged directly into the city's waterways. Air pollution from vehicle <b>exhausts,</b> residential coal-burning stoves and other sources is worsening. While the city has set up clean water pumps, they remain inadequate and are not distributed according to population density, worsening access in the poorest and most populous parts of the city. Antananarivo {{is one of the}} two urban areas in Madagascar where bubonic plague is endemic.|$|E
5|$|It was {{originally}} intended that the electrical {{supply to the}} line and stations would be provided by a dedicated generating station at St George's Road, Southwark. This idea was abandoned in 1902 and electricity was instead provided by Lots Road Power Station, operated by the UERL. Six ventilation fans were installed along the line to draw 18,500 cubic feet per minute through the tunnels and out through <b>exhausts</b> placed {{on the roof of}} the stations. Fresh air was drawn back down from the surface via the lift and staircase shafts, thus replenishing the air in the tunnels. To reduce the risk of fire, the station platforms were built of concrete and iron and the sleepers were made from the fireproof Australian wood Eucalyptus marginata or jarrah.|$|E
5|$|The A-10 was envisioned to {{fly from}} forward air bases and semi-prepared runways with {{high risk of}} foreign object damage to the engines. The unusual {{location}} of the General Electric TF34-GE-100 turbofan engines decreases ingestion risk, and allows the engines to run while the aircraft is serviced and rearmed by ground crews, reducing turn-around time. The wings are also mounted closer to the ground, simplifying servicing and rearming operations. The heavy engines require strong supports: four bolts connect the engine pylons to the airframe. The engines' high 6:1 bypass ratio contributes to a relatively small infrared signature, and their position directs exhaust over the tailplanes further shielding it from detection by infrared homing surface-to-air missiles. The engines and <b>exhausts</b> are angled upward by nine degrees to cancel out the nose-down pitching moment that would otherwise generate from being mounted above the aircraft's center of gravity and avoids the need to trim the control surfaces to prevent pitching.|$|E
50|$|Early/late <b>exhaust</b> valve closingEarly {{and late}} <b>exhaust</b> valve closing can also reduce emissions. Traditionally, the <b>exhaust</b> valve opens, and <b>exhaust</b> gas is {{pushed out of}} the {{cylinder}} and into the <b>exhaust</b> manifold by the piston as it travels upward. By manipulating {{the timing of the}} <b>exhaust</b> valve, engineers can control how much <b>exhaust</b> gas is left in the cylinder. By holding the <b>exhaust</b> valve open slightly longer, the cylinder is emptied more and ready to be filled with a bigger air/fuel charge on the intake stroke. By closing the valve slightly early, more <b>exhaust</b> gas remains in the cylinder which increases fuel efficiency. This allows for more efficient operation under all conditions.|$|R

The fan forces the <b>exhaust</b> through the <b>exhaust</b> stack, and the <b>exhaust</b> is then discharged into the atmosphere at a sufficient velocity and momentum {{to ensure that the}} <b>exhaust</b> reaches an environmentally sound altitude. A variable speed drive (36), programmable controller (34), flow signals (26), and static pressure and total pressure signals (20) are utilized to modulate the speed of the fan and the area of the <b>exhaust</b> stack to maintain the desired fan inlet pressure and <b>exhaust</b> velocity...|$|R
5|$|The DNC {{objected to}} the loss of the {{mainmast}} as he believed that it was needed to support a boat-handling derrick, but was overruled by the Admiralty, which preferred to position the tripod foremast behind the forward funnel with the tripod legs facing forward to allow the vertical leg to be used to support the derrick. This all but guaranteed that the hot funnel gases could render the spotting top uninhabitable. The short height of the funnel also bedevilled the bridge with smoke until it was raised in 1912, although this exacerbated the problem for the spotting top. The decision to space the wing turrets more closely together also made the smoke problem worse; because it reduced the space available to the aft boiler room which meant that the forward funnel had to accommodate the <b>exhausts</b> of a dozen boilers compared to the aft funnel's six, further increasing the smoke from the forward funnel.|$|E
5|$|Concorde {{produced}} {{nitrogen oxides}} in its exhaust, which, despite complicated interactions with other ozone-depleting chemicals, are understood {{to result in}} degradation to the ozone layer at the stratospheric altitudes it cruised. It has been pointed out that other, lower-flying, airliners produce ozone during their flights in the troposphere, but vertical transit of gases between the layers is restricted. The small fleet meant overall ozone-layer degradation caused by Concorde was negligible. In 1995, David Fahey, of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the United States, warned that a fleet of 500 supersonic aircraft with <b>exhausts</b> similar to Concorde might produce in a 2 per cent drop in global ozone levels, much higher than previously thought. Each 1 per cent drop in ozone is estimated to increase the incidence of non-melanoma skin cancer worldwide by 2 per cent. Dr Fahey said if these particles are produced by highly oxidised sulphur in the fuel, as he believed, then removing sulphur in the fuel will reduce the ozone-destroying impact of supersonic transport.|$|E
5|$|Suffering {{withdrawal}} syndrome from {{the lack of}} cable, Peter straps a television-sized cardboard cutout to himself, making it appear as though his whole world is actually a television programme. When Meg can no longer deal with the public scorn, she reveals that her father is really responsible for Quahog's loss of television, causing the town to turn against him. In an attempt to save Peter from further scorn and verbal attacks, Lois gives a heartfelt speech to the community about how television has kept them all from enjoying one another. Inspired by the speech, Peter drags the family to one outdoor activity after another, which quickly <b>exhausts</b> them. Once the family can no longer keep up with him, Peter decides to go off with William Shatner, who has appeared on the Griffin family doorstep after experiencing a flat tire, to a nearby festival. Meanwhile, Stewie's weather machine creates a huge rainstorm. The storm's lightning strike destroys Stewie's weather machine and blows Stewie off the roof and on the ground. While Meg is practicing driving with Lois, the storm causes her to accidentally hit Shatner and Peter, killing Shatner and hospitalizing Peter. As her father recovers, in a full-body cast, he is forced to watch television, causing him to become addicted once again, much to his family's relief.|$|E
50|$|<b>Exhaust</b> brakes are simpler in {{operation}} than an engine brake. Essentially, the <b>exhaust</b> pipe {{of the vehicle}} is restricted by a valve. This raises the pressure in the <b>exhaust</b> system, forcing the engine to work harder on the <b>exhaust</b> stroke of its cylinders, so again the engine is acting as an air compressor, with the power required to compress the air being withheld from the <b>exhaust</b> pipe, retarding the vehicle. Turbocharger retarders that restrict the flow of <b>exhaust</b> gas can also help in increasing the <b>exhaust</b> pressure {{to achieve the same}} objective.|$|R
25|$|The <b>exhaust</b> {{manifold}} (<b>exhaust</b> tee, <b>exhaust</b> cover, whiskers) is the ducting {{that protects}} the <b>exhaust</b> valve(s) and diverts the exhaled air to the sides {{so that it does}} not bubble up in the diver's face and obscure the view.

5000|$|These {{conflicting}} {{requirements are}} reconciled by constructing the <b>exhaust</b> pipe with diverging and converging conical sections to create pressure wave reflections which travel {{back up the}} pipe and are presented at the <b>exhaust</b> port. The <b>exhaust</b> port opens while there is still significant pressure in the cylinder, which drives the initial outflow of <b>exhaust.</b> As the pressure wave from the pulse of <b>exhaust</b> gas travels down the pipe, it encounters a diverging conical section; this causes a wave of negative pressure to be reflected back up the pipe, which arrives at the <b>exhaust</b> port {{towards the end of}} the <b>exhaust</b> phase, when the cylinder pressure has fallen to a low level, and helps to draw the remaining <b>exhaust</b> gas out of the cylinder. Further along the <b>exhaust</b> pipe, the <b>exhaust</b> pressure wave encounters a converging conical section, and this reflects a positive pressure wave back up the pipe. This wave is timed to arrive at the <b>exhaust</b> port after scavenging is completed, thereby [...] "plugging" [...] the <b>exhaust</b> port to prevent spillage of fresh charge, and indeed may also push back into the cylinder any charge which has already spilled.|$|R
50|$|An <b>exhaust</b> brake is {{a device}} that {{essentially}} creates a major restriction in the <b>exhaust</b> system, and creates substantial <b>exhaust</b> back pressure to retard engine speed and offer some supplemental braking. In most cases, an <b>exhaust</b> brake is so effective that it can slow a heavily loaded vehicle on a downgrade without ever applying the vehicle's service brakes. <b>Exhaust</b> brakes are manufactured by many companies. The brakes vary in design, but essentially operate as described above. More advanced <b>exhaust</b> brakes have <b>exhaust</b> pressure modulation (EPM) that controls the back pressure which in turn improves the braking performance {{across a range of}} engine speeds.|$|R
50|$|The primary <b>exhaust</b> {{rocker arm}} {{contacts}} a low-profile camshaft lobe during low-RPM engine operation. Once VTEC engagement occurs, the oil pressure {{flowing from the}} <b>exhaust</b> rocker shaft into the primary <b>exhaust</b> rocker arm forces the VTEC switching piston into the secondary <b>exhaust</b> rocker arm, thereby locking both <b>exhaust</b> rocker arms together. The high-profile camshaft lobe which normally contacts the secondary <b>exhaust</b> rocker arm alone during low-RPM engine operation is able to move both <b>exhaust</b> rocker arms together which are locked as a unit. The same occurs for the intake rocker shaft, except that the high-profile camshaft lobe operates the primary rocker arm.|$|R
