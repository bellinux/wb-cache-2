There is a mechanical {{separation of the}} contaminants within a machine called a ‘screen changer’. A typical system will consist of a steel housing with the filtration medium contained in moveable pistons or slide plates that enable the processor to remove the screens from the extruder flow without stopping production. The contaminants are usually collected on woven wire screens which are supported on a stainless steel plate called a ‘breaker plate’ -- a strong circular piece of steel drilled with large holes to allow {{the flow of the}} polymer melt.

50|$|The product {{must now}} be cooled and this is usually {{achieved}} by pulling the extrudate through a water bath.

A serrated knife should not be used on a plastic cutting board. The sharper the knife, the longer the cutting board will last.

40|$|Extruders are a {{fundamental}} {{part of any}} <b>extrusion</b> or compounding <b>line.</b> Single-screw extruders are of general-purpose application, while intermeshing twin-screw machines have found special application niches, mainly because of their good mixing capabilities. When only small quantities of (expensive or experimental) materials are available, it is often necessary to extrude at small, laboratorial scales. In addition, the in-situ characterization of material structure and viscoelastic properties is essential for understanding the interplay between process parameters and the final properties of the extrudate. The aim of this work is to couple a novel small scale modular single / twin-screw extrusion system, with well-controlled outputs in the range 30 - 300 g/h, to a slit die able to perform in-line rheo-optical characterization. The mini-extruder is equipped with ports that allow sample collection or non-intrusive analysis to be performed along its axis at desired locations. Rheometrical functions such as shear viscosity and normal-stress differences can be measured simultaneously with small angle light scattering patterns or optical microscopy imaging. Both rheological and optical validations of the equipment are presented and a preliminary study of a model polymer blend is reported.

40|$|The {{process of}} {{aluminium}} extrusion has great {{importance in the}} metal forming industry because {{of its ability to}} produce profiles of various complicated geometries, shapes and sizes. The flow of metal within the extrusion die influences the mechanical properties of extruded products. Metal flow being the core of process, attracts academia and industries to develop better understanding how does metal flow occur during extrusion. Extrusion welding is another prominent topic which has attained attention of industry that is keen to produce hollow profiles with sound extrusion welds. The aim of my research work has been to gain increased understanding about metal flow, extrusion welding and deformation characteristics of aluminium when extruding through a porthole die. I have focused to encircle the topic of flow of metal and to characterize welding conditions during production of aluminium hollow profiles. The art to achieve real metal flow from extrusion process has been developing for some decades. Initially it was the intention to expand the study {{to the end of the}} work by including 3 Dsituations of extrusion welding corresponding to that occurring in industrial extrusion. But as the work proceeded it was realized that the conditions are so complex in extrusion welding, that it was sufficient challenge to map what takes place in the simplified 2 D-extrusion process. A state of the art grid pattern technique has been used to achieve metal flow from extrusion experiments where the conditions are close to perfect 2 D-flow creating an extruded strip with an interior extrusion seam weld. The work comprises of concept development to the final results both for symmetric and non-symmetric metal flow during extrusion. The FE-models have been made to mimic the experimental results and obtain information about different aspects of extrusion process and their influence on metal flow, deformation characteristics and weld formation. The work has substantially increased the knowledge about the non-symmetric flow of metal around the die bridge for hollow profile production. It is found that there is more volume of metal flow and at higher velocity through the bigger porthole of the die. The <b>extrusion</b> weld <b>line</b> is therefore pushed towards the big porthole side at the rear end of the bridge and displaced towards the side of small porthole over the length of extruded profile. It has been shown that by FEA it is straight forward to investigate the local metal flow at the rear end of the bridge where the extrusion weld is created. The analysis shows that a dead (or stagnant) zone of metal will appear at the rear end of the die bridge (where welding occurs) when both pointed and butt-ended rear end of the bridge are used. Because of slow flow velocity in the dead zone, and much increased velocity at the tail end behind it, the material here will become severely stretched. The term stretching zone has therefore been attributed to this region where the material elongates strongly. It is clear that the presence of this stretching zone at this location and the phenomenon of the material becoming heavily stretched contribute to give favourable seam welding conditions here. A comprehensive picture of the topic is made by creating new knowledge both with the help of FEA and experimental results of metal flow. Grid patterns made from contrast pins combined with finite element analysis for study of metal flow of metal forming has proved to be very useful for understanding the complex mechanics of Al extrusion.

30|$|During {{the initial}} {{fragmentation}} stage of Perthes disease, the principle focus {{is to achieve}} containment of the femoral head within the acetabulum. Whether by bracing, abduction casts, femoral and/or pelvic osteotomy, the goals are to maximize the range of hip motion and to avoid incongruity, hoping to avert subsequent femoro-acetabular impingement or hinge abduction. A more subtle and insidious manifestation of the disease relates to growth disturbance involving the femoral neck. We have chosen to tether the greater trochanteric physis, combined with a medial soft tissue release, {{as part of our}} non-osteotomy management strategy for select children with progressive symptomatology and related radiographic changes. In addition to providing containment, we feel that this strategy addresses potential long-range issues pertaining to limb length and abductor mechanics, while avoiding iatrogenic varus deformity caused by osteotomy. This is a retrospective review of 12 patients (nine boys, three girls), average age 7.3  years old (range 5.3 – 9.7), who underwent non-osteotomy surgery for Perthes disease. An eight-plate was applied to the greater trochanteric apophysis at the time of arthrogram, open adductor and iliopsoas tenotomy, and Petrie cast application. We compared clinical and radiographic findings at the outset to those at an average follow-up of 49  months (range 14 – 78  months). Six plates were subsequently removed; the others remain in situ. Eleven of twelve patients experienced improvement in pain, and alleviation of limp and Trendelenburg sign at latest follow-up. The majority had improved or maintained range of motion and prevention of trochanteric impingement demonstrated by near normalization of abduction. Neck-shaft angles, Shenton’s <b>line,</b> <b>extrusion</b> index, center edge angles and trochanteric height did not change significantly. One patient underwent subsequent trochanteric distalization and no other patients have undergone subsequent femoral or periacetabular osteotomies. Leg length discrepancy worsened in four patients and was treated with contralateral eight-plate distal femoral epiphysiodesis. As a group the mean leg length discrepancy did not change significantly. There were no perioperative complications. six trochanteric plates were subsequently removed after an average of 43.7  months (range 28 – 69) due to irritation of hardware; the others remain in situ, pending further growth. We employed open adductor and iliopsoas tenotomy and Petrie cast application and guided growth of the greater trochanter as a means of redirecting the growth of the common proximal femoral chondroepiphysis. The accrued benefits of preventing relative trochanteric overgrowth with a flexible tether are the avoidance of iatrogenic varus and weakening of the hip abductors. The goals are to preserve abductor strength and avoid trochanteric transfer or intertrochanteric osteotomy.|$|R

Conversely, its processing properties are not always optimal, e. g. insufficient melt strength at higher temperatures (necessary in extrusion coating processes). This thesis reports on research to improve properties of commercial PLLA grade (3051 D from NatureWorks), to satisfy and extend end-use applications, such as food packaging by blending with modified PLLA. Adjustment of the processability by chain branching of commercial poly-L-lactide initiated by peroxide was evaluated. Several well-defined branched structures with four arms (sPLLA) were synthesized using pentaerythritol as a tetra-functional initiator. Finally, several block copolymers consisting of polyethylene glycol and PLLA (i. e. PEGLA) were produced to obtain a well extruded material with improved heat sealing properties. Reactive extrusion of poly-L-lactide {{was carried out in}} the presence of 0. 1, 0. 3 and 0. 5 wt% of various peroxides [tert-butyl-peroxybenzoate (TBPB), 2, 5 -dimethyl- 2, 5 -(tert-butylperoxy) -hexane (Lupersol 101; LOL 1) and benzoyl peroxide (BPO) ] at 190 C. The peroxide-treated PLLAs showed increased complex viscosity and storage modulus at lower frequencies, indicating the formation of branched/cross linked architectures. The material property changes were dependent on the peroxide, and the used peroxide concentration. Gel fraction analysis showed that the peroxides, afforded different gel contents, and especially 0. 5 wt% peroxide, produced both an extremely high molar mass, and a cross linked structure, not perhaps well suited for e. g. further use in a blending step. The thermal behavior was somewhat unexpected as the materials prepared with 0. 5 wt% peroxide showed the highest ability for crystallization and cold crystallization, despite substantial cross linking. The peroxide-modified PLLA, i. e. PLLA melt extruded with 0. 3 wt% of TBPB and LOL 1 and 0. 5 wt% BPO was added to linear PLLA in ratios of 5, 15 and 30 wt%. All blends showed increased zero shear viscosity, elastic nature (storage modulus) and shear sensitivity. All blends remained amorphous, though the ability of annealing was improved slightly. Extrusion coating on paperboard was conducted with PLLA, and peroxide-modified PLLA blends (90 : 10). All blends were processable, but only PLLA with 0. 3 wt% of LOL 1 afforded a smooth high quality surface with improved line speed. Adhesion levels between fiber and plastic, as well as heat seal performance were marginally reduced compared with pure 3051 D. The water vapor transmission measurements (WVTR) of the blends containing LOL 1 showed acceptable levels, only slightly lower than for comparable PLLA 3051 D. A series of four-arm star-shaped poly-L-lactide (sPLLA) with different branch length was synthesized by ring opening polymerization (ROP) of L-lactide using pentaerythritol as initiator and stannous octoate as catalyst. The star-shaped polymers were further blended with its linear resin and studied for their melt flow and thermal properties. Blends containing 30 wt% of sPLLA with low molecular weight (30 wt%; Mwtotal: 2500 g mol- 1 and 15000 g mol- 1) showed lower zero shear viscosity and significantly increased shear thinning, {{while at the same time}} slightly increased crystallization of the blend. However, the amount of crystallization increased significantly with the higher molecular weight sPLLA, therefore the star-shaped structure may play a role as nucleating agent. PLLA-polyethylene glycol–PLLA triblock copolymers (PEGLA) with different PLLA block length were synthesized and their applicability as blends with linear PLLA (3051 D NatureWorks) was investigated with the intention of improving heat-seal and adhesion properties of extrusion-coated paperboard. PLLA-PEG-PLLA was obtained by ring opening polymerization (ROP) of L-lactide using PEG (molecular weight 6000 g mol- 1) as an initiator, and stannous octoate as catalyst. The structures of the PEGLAs were characterized by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1 H-NMR). The melt flow and thermal properties of all PEGLAs and their blends were evaluated using dynamic rheology, and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). All blends containing 30 wt% of PEGLAs showed slightly higher zero shear viscosity, higher shear thinning and increased melt elasticity (based on tan delta). Nevertheless, no significant changes in thermal properties were distinguished. High molecular weight PEGLAs were used in <b>extrusion</b> coating <b>line</b> with 3051 D without problems...|$|R
