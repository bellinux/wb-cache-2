Since the future weather condition is only predictable with {{a certain degree of}} accuracy, managing traffic in the weather-affected airspace is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a geometric model to generate an optimal combination of ground delay and route choice to hedge against weather risk. The geometric recourse model (GRM) is a strategic Probabilistic Air Traffic Management (PATM) model that generates optimal route choice, incorporating route hedging and en-route recourse to respond to weather change: hedged routes are routes other than the nominal or the detour one, and recourse occurs when the weather restricted airspace becomes flyable and aircraft are re-routed to fly direct to the destination. Among several variations of the GRM, we focus on the hybrid <b>Dual</b> <b>Recourse</b> Model (DRM), which allows ground delay as well as route hedging and recourses, when the weather clearance time follows a uniform distribution. The formulation of the hybrid DRM involves two decision variables – ground delay and route choice – and four parameters: storm location, storm size, maximum storm duration time, and ground-airborne cost ratio. The objective function has two components: expected total ground delay cost and expected total airborne cost. We propose a solution algorithm that guarantees to find the global optimum of the hybrid-DRM. Based on the numerical analysis, we find that ground-holding is effective only when combined with the nominal route. Otherwise, it is optimal to fly on the route determined by the DRM without ground delay. We also find the formula of the threshold ground-airborne cost ratio, which we call the Critical Cost Ratio (CCR), that determines the efficacy of ground delay: the higher the CCR, the more effective the strategies involving ground delay. We conclude that both ground delay and route hedging should be considered together to produce the best ATM decisions...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} growing {{interest}} in air transportation community to develop a routing decision model based on probabilistic characterization of severe weather. In the probabilistic air traffic management (PATM), decisions are made based on the stochastic weather information in the expected total cost sense. Probabilistic approach aims to enhance routing flexibility and reduce {{the risks associated with}} uncertainty of the future weather. In this research, a geometric model is adopted to generate optimal route choice when the future weather is stochastic. The geometric recourse model (GRM) is a strategic PATM model that incorporates route hedging and en-route recourse options to respond to weather change. Hedged routes are routes other than the nominal or detour route, and aircraft is re-routed to fly direct to the destination, which is called recourse, when the weather restricted airspace become flyable. Aircraft takes either the first recourse or the second recourse: The first recourse occurs when weather clears before aircraft reaches it flying on the initial route. The second recourse occurs when the aircraft is at the weather region. There are two variations of GRM: Single Recourse Model (SRM) with first recourse only and <b>Dual</b> <b>Recourse</b> Model (DRM) with both the first and second recourse options. When the weather clearance time follows a uniform distribution, SRM becomes convex with optimal route being either the detour or a hedged route. The DRM has a special property when the maximum storm duration time is less than the flight time to the tip of the storm on the detour route: it is always optimal to take the nominal route. The performance study is conducted by measuring the cost saving from either SRM or DRM. The result shows that there are cases with substantial cost saving, reaching nearly 30 % with DRM. The ground-airborne hybrid model is an extension of the GRM, where both ground holding as well as route hedging are considered. The optimal combination of ground delay and route choice is determined by weather characteristics as well as the ground-airborne cost ratio. The numerical analysis reveals that whenever ground delay is required, the optimal route choice is the nominal one, while a non-nominal route is optimal when the ground delay is zero. There exists a unique critical cost ratio associated with given weather condition, which determines whether ground holding is optimal or not...|$|E

We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} bounding the expected value of a linear program (LP) containing random coeffecients, with applications to solving two-stage stochastic programs. An upper bound for minimizations is derived from a restriction of an equivalent, penalty-based formulation of the primal stochastic LP, and a lower bound is obtained from a restriction of a reformulation of the <b>dual.</b> Our "restricted <b>recourse</b> bounds" are more general and more easily computed than most other bounds because random coefficients may appear anywhere in the LP, neither independence nor boundedness of the coefficients is needed, and the bound is computed by solving a single LP or nonlinear program. Analytical examples demonstrate that the new bounds can be stronger than complementary Jensen bounds. (An upper bound is "complementary" to a lower bound, and vice versa). In computational work, we apply the bounds to a two-stage stochastic program for semiconductor manufacturing with uncertain demand and production rates...|$|R
