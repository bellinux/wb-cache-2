50|$|The faunal species {{reported}} {{from the park}} are the following: Maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus), pampas deer (Ozotoceros bezoarticus), giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), bush dog (Speothos venaticus), giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis), giant armadillo (Priodontes giganteus), black howler monkey (Alouatta caraya), <b>forest</b> <b>rabbit</b> (Sylvilagus brasiliensis), Juscelinomys candangus, cavy (Galea spixii), Calhartes burrovianus urubutinga, Mussurana (Portuguese muçurana) and tegu (Tupinambis teguixin). Also reported are Black-tufted marmoset (Callithrix penicillata), capybara, jaguar, wild pig and puma.|$|E
50|$|Sylvilagus insonus {{differs from}} S. brasiliensis (<b>forest</b> <b>rabbit)</b> and S. dicei (Dice's cottontail) {{in that it}} has a larger, skull, wider {{zygomatic}} bone, deeper rostrum, wider carotid foramina and dorsal extensions of the premaxillaries that extend posterior to the nasal instead. S. insonus also has a narrower basioccipital and narrower post-dental. In external appearance, the Omilteme cottontail has a longer bicoloured tail (rufous and black) instead of a uni-coloured tail (solely brown); hind feet with white and brown versus hind feet of only brown; and longer ears.|$|E

Drummer the Woodpecker gave a frightened scream and flew deep into the Green <b>Forest.</b> Peter <b>Rabbit</b> {{flattened}} himself under a friendly bramble bush. Johnny Chuck dived headfirst down his doorway.|$|R
50|$|The Omilteme cottontail {{lives at}} the summit of a {{mountain}} range which has steep slopes and ravines covered with dense cloud forests. Some pine and pine-oak forests are present as well. It shares its habitat with 37 other mammal species. In the dense cloud <b>forests,</b> the <b>rabbit</b> lives amongst the undergrowth where it makes runways and burrows under objects such as rocks.|$|R
50|$|It {{rises in}} northwestern Grand County, in the Routt National <b>Forest</b> west of <b>Rabbit</b> Ears Pass at the {{continental}} divide. It flows south, east, then southwest, and joins the Colorado near Kremmling.|$|R
50|$|Upon hearing this, the Dragon King of the Southern Sea grants {{the rabbit}} {{permission}} {{to go back to}} the forest with the terrapin after the rabbit promises that he will return with his liver. Once in the <b>forest,</b> the <b>rabbit</b> ridicules the King's and terrapin's stupidity and is never seen again. But the rabbit is also actually quite moved by the terrapin's faithfulness to the King.|$|R

50|$|The forest {{occupies}} {{an area of}} 629.51 ha. Red oak {{is particularly}} represented in its territory, as a fragment of the old, once enormous, lowland forest wetland. In the forest, there is a total of 185 recorded species, of which 15 have the status of protected and strictly protected species. One hundred and sixty-five (165) species of fungi grow in the forest, 15 of which with protection status, while two species are on the European Red List of mushrooms in Europe. Besides the oak, the forest is rich with hornbeam and linden, there are also poplar, dogwood, elderberry and wild rose. Wild garlic grows {{in one part of}} the forest, while in the spring there are a lot of wild strawberries, in swampy areas there is iris, and very frequently fennel.One hundred and eight (108) species of birds were recored in the forest, i.e. 30% of the total number of bird species recorded in Serbia. Also, there are 10 species of amphibians and reptiles, of which as many as 8 species is protected by law. When it comes to animals which roam freely through the <b>forest,</b> <b>rabbits</b> and elk can be seen. Swineherds keep their pigs in the forest, and wild pigs that feed on acorns can also be found. A large number of insects also lives there, of which the most notable are mosquitoes, horseflies and hornets.The area is still relatively preserved, has great natural value, but it is in danger of further degradation due to its proximity to the urban zone, which is why it has been put under protection.|$|R
5|$|In July 2008, the Amami Rangers {{for nature}} {{conservation}} obtained {{a photograph of}} a feral cat carrying a rabbit corpse (rabbit bones and fur found in cat or dog droppings had already been found), prompting discussions on better ways to control pets. A small area of the Amami Island has the Amami Gunto Quasi-National Park that further protects the population. Some attempt at habitat restoration has been made, but the Amami rabbit needs a mosaic of mature and young forest in close proximity, and when a young forest is regrown nowhere near a mature <b>forest,</b> this <b>rabbit</b> is not likely to inhabit it. Research and population monitoring also is underway to try to keep the numbers from declining, even if they can not be increased.|$|R

5000|$|The name of {{this town}} was {{originally}} Chinna Ballaporum. Originating from the Telugu word Chinna meaning small while [...] "balla" [...] means the measure to quantify food grains, and [...] "porum" [...] means [...] "town". The ruler of Avathi Mallabiregowda's son Marigowda was hunting one day in Kodimanchanahalli <b>forest.</b> A <b>rabbit</b> {{stood in front of}} the fierce hunting dogs without fear. Seeing this, ruler was elated and told his son that the strength of the rabbit is due to the valor of the region's citizenry. As such the ruler took permission from King of Vijaynagar and built an elaborate fort and formed a city which is now known as Chikkaballapura. Baichegowda, King of Mysore later attacked the fort but had to withdraw due to the valiant efforts of the Chikkaballapura citizenry and aid from the Marathas. Sri Dodda Byregowda who came to power after Baichegowda acquired the land, which was taken by Mysore king. In 1762 during the ruling of Chikkappanayaka, Hyder Ali captured the town for a period of 3 months. Then Chikkappanayaka agreed to pay 5-lakhs pagodas, and then the army was taken back.|$|R
50|$|This Taluka {{falls to}} the {{foothill}} of Sahyadri Mountain range and which is towards {{the west side of}} Pune city. This taluka gets divided into two parts i.e. north and south because of the Pune Nasik highway which passes through this area. In the north the degree of rainfall is very low therefore the area is dry and on the contrary in south the rainfall is heavy and the area is also hilly. In north wheat, jawari and bajari are most commonly grown crops where as in south rice is grown. Trees like Sag, Teak, Oak, Mango, are found in these <b>forests.</b> Animals like <b>Rabbit,</b> Deer, Wolf, Fox, Tiger and Leopards are found here and the birds like Peacock, Bulbul, Parrot mostly occur in these forest.|$|R
60|$|Foolish Peter Rabbit! There he was boasting and bragging {{to himself}} {{of what he}} would do to some one whom he hadn't even seen, all because he had found a sign that told him the Old Pasture, in which he had made up his mind to make his new home, was already the home of some one else. Peter was like a lot of other people; he wasn't fair. No, Sir, he wasn't fair. He let his own desires destroy his sense of fair play. It was all right for him to put up signs in the dear Old Briar-patch and the Green <b>Forest,</b> warning other <b>Rabbits</b> that they must keep away, but it was all wrong for another Rabbit {{to do the same thing}} in the Old Pasture. Oh, my, yes! That was quite a {{different}} matter! The very thought of it made Peter very, very angry. When he thought of this other Rabbit, it was always as the stranger. That shows just how unfair Peter was, because, you see, Peter himself was really the stranger. It was his first visit to the Old Pasture, while it was very plain that the other had lived there for some time.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We have {{compared}} {{the behavior of}} wild-type mouse NEDD- 2, a neural precursor cell [...] e_xpressed, developmentally down-regulated cysteine protease gene, to various mutant forms of the gene in both apoptotic activity in neuronal cells and proteolytic cleavage in the Semliki <b>Forest</b> virus and <b>rabbit</b> reticulocyte protein expression systems. Our results confirm that NEDD- 2 processing and apoptotic activity are linked phenom-ena. They identify aspartate residues as likely targets for autocatalytic cleavage. They establish that cleavage events only occur at specific sites. Finally, they pinpoint differential effects of individual mutations on the overall proteolytic cleavage patterns, raising interesting questions related to the mechanisms of subunit assembly. O VER the past two years, proteolysis has emerged as an important mechanism underlying programmed cell death (PCD). 1 A major step toward {{the development of this}} concept has been the discovery of structural homology between interleukin (IL) -I ~ converting enzyme (ICE), a protease involved in the processing of IL- 113 precursor in monocytes, and ced- 3, a protein required for cells to undergo PCD in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (Yuan et al., 1993). ICE and ced- 3 are prototypes of a family of cysteine proteases to which were added ICH- 1...|$|R
40|$|Treated biosolids {{have been}} applied to 750 -ha of a Pinus radiata <b>forest</b> {{plantation}} on <b>Rabbit</b> Island near Nelson City in New Zealand since 1996. A long-term research trial was established in 1997 to investigate {{the effects of the}} biosolids applications on the receiving environment and tree growth. An analysis of the likely economic impact of biosolids application shows that biosolids application has been beneficial. Stem volume of the high treatment (biosolids applied at 600 kg N ha- 1 every three years) was 36 % greater than the control treatment (no biosolids applied), and stem volume of the standard treatment (300 kg N ha- 1) was 27 % greater than the control treatment at age 18 years of age. Biosolids treatments have effectively transformed a low productivity forest site to a medium productivity site. Although this increased productivity has been accompanied by some negative influences on wood quality attributes with reduced wood stiffness, wood density, and larger branches, an economic analysis shows that the increased stem volume and greater average log diameter in the biosolids treatments outweighs these negative effects. The high and standard biosolids treatments are predicted to increase the net stumpage value of logs by 24 % and 14 % respectively at harvesting, providing a large positive impact on the forest owner’s economic return...|$|R
40|$|The New Zealand alpine zone {{has many}} fleshy-fruited plant species, but {{now has a}} {{relatively}} depauperate animal fauna. The key question is, therefore, are native alpine plants still being dispersed, if so where to and by what? I first measured fruit removal rates among nine common species using animal-exclusion cages to compare natural fruit removal by all animals, and by lizards only. Over two years, mean percent of fruit removed by early winter ranged from 25 – 60 % among species. Speed of fruit removal also varied depending on species. Secondly, I quantified which animals disperse (or predate) seeds of those fruits, into which habitats they deposit the seeds, and {{the relative importance of}} each animal species for dispersal, in two ways. A 2 -year study using fixed-area transects to monitor faecal deposition showed that introduced mammals (especially possums, rabbits, hares, sheep, pigs and hedgehogs) were abundant and widespread through alpine habitat. Of the 25, 537 faeces collected, a sub-sample of 2, 338 was dissected. Most mammals dispersed most (> 90 %) seeds intact. However, possums (numerically the important disperser) moved most seeds into mountain beech (Nothofagus solandri) <b>forest,</b> while <b>rabbits,</b> hares, and sheep dispersed seeds mainly into open grassland dominated by thick swards of exotic grasses (e. g. Agrostis capillaris and Anthoxanthum odoratum); all are less suitable microsites. Kea (Nestor notabilis), the largest and most mobile of only three remaining native alpine bird species, are potentially useful as a long-distance seed disperser, even though parrots are typically seed predators. I found that kea are numerically more important than all other birds combined, damage very few seeds, and are probably responsible for most dispersal of seeds between mountain ranges. Finally, I investigated the effects of seed deposition microsite (shady/high-light), pulp-removal (whole/cleaned), competition (soil dug/not-dug) and predation (caged/ not) on germination, growth and survival of eight subalpine plant species. There were strong positive effects of shady microsites for seed germination and seedling survival to 3. 5 years for six of the eight species. Effects of other treatments were less important and varied among species and stages. Hence, both native birds and introduced mammals are dispersing alpine seeds, but the mammals often deposit seeds in habitats unsuitable for establishment. Any evaluation of the dispersal effectiveness of frugivores must consider their contribution towards the long-term success for plant recruitment through dispersal quantity and quality...|$|R
