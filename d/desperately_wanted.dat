5|$|Louis XVIII {{negotiated}} Marie-Thérèse's {{release from}} her Paris prison in 1795. He <b>desperately</b> <b>wanted</b> {{her to marry}} her first cousin, Louis-Antoine, Duke of Angoulême, {{the son of the}} Count of Artois. Louis XVIII deceived his niece by telling her that her parents' last wishes were for her to marry Louis Antoine, and she duly agreed to her uncle-king's wishes.|$|E
5|$|Eleanor and her {{daughter}} Anna became estranged after she took over some of her mother's social duties at the White House. The relationship was further strained because Eleanor <b>desperately</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to go with her}} husband to Yalta in February 1945 (two months before FDR's death), but he took Anna instead. A few years later, the two were able to reconcile and cooperate on numerous projects. Anna took care of her mother when she was terminally ill in 1962.|$|E
5|$|In April 2010, Linguswamy's Paiyaa released. A romantic road-trip film, {{featuring}} a blockbuster album by Yuvan Shankar Raja, {{it was very}} successful. For the first time, he enacted a character that lives in an urban area. He said that he accepted the film because he <b>desperately</b> <b>wanted</b> to play a cool dude on screen. Karthi's performances in Aayirathil Oruvan and Paiyaa earned him further nominations at the 58th Filmfare Awards South in the Best Actor category. Both films were dubbed into Telugu as Yuganiki Okkadu and Aawara, respectively, and were successful.|$|E

5|$|Napoleon's use of {{propaganda}} {{contributed to his}} rise to power, legitimated his régime, and established his image for posterity. Strict censorship, controlling aspects of the press, books, theater, and art, {{was part of his}} propaganda scheme, aimed at portraying him as bringing <b>desperately</b> <b>wanted</b> peace and stability to France. The propagandistic rhetoric changed in relation to events and to the atmosphere of Napoleon's reign, focusing first on his role as a general in the army and identification as a soldier, and moving to his role as emperor and a civil leader. Specifically targeting his civilian audience, Napoleon fostered a relationship with the contemporary art community, taking an active role in commissioning and controlling different forms of art production to suit his propaganda goals.|$|E
5|$|However, Matsui {{had made}} it clear to his {{superiors}} even before he had left Japan in August that he was determined to capture the capital city of China, Nanking, which lay 300 kilometers west of Shanghai. Matsui forcefully asserted that the war with China would not end until Nanking was in their control, and he envisaged that the fall of Nanking would result in the total collapse of Chiang Kai-shek's government. After Chiang's fall Matsui hoped {{to play a role in}} forming a new government in China which, according to his own conception, would be a democracy that would better serve the interests of both Japan and the people of China. However, the historian Tokushi Kasahara also sees personal motives behind Matsui's insistence on capturing Nanking. Kasahara suspects that Matsui, as an aging general with a relatively undistinguished military record, <b>desperately</b> <b>wanted</b> to crown his career with one last battlefield victory like the capture of the Chinese capital.|$|E
5|$|Since 1888, when Mahdist rebels {{forced the}} {{evacuation}} of then governor Emin Pasha, the Lado Enclave had been occupied by rebels {{under the leadership of}} Emir Arabi Dafalla. Rejaf was their strongest fortified position in the area, and it was there Arabi Dafalla stationed his equipment and soldiers. The establishment of Mahdist Sudan had provided the context for European powers to commence the invasion and colonization of the Sudan, in which King Leopold <b>desperately</b> <b>wanted</b> to take part in order to expand his Congolese empire. However, a direct military campaign into the area was not an option; Leopold {{would not have been able}} to get permission from either the French or the British according to the rules laid out in the 1884 Berlin Conference, especially considering both nations were looking to annex the Sudan themselves. King Leopold II therefore decided to disguise his campaign into the Sudan as an expeditionary force sent to reclaim the Lado Enclave from the Mahdists, although he inended to give his commanders covert orders to continue their advance far past the boundaries of Belgian territory, first to Fashoda and then on to Khartoum. After receiving a new loan of 6.5 million francs from the Belgian government in 1895, Leopold ordered preparations to be made for the execution of his plan.|$|E

5|$|The Brindle Tails <b>desperately</b> <b>wanted</b> Clayton {{out of the}} governor's office. Conveniently, Lieutenant Governor James M. Johnson was a Brindle Tail, so {{the natural}} course of action {{was to try to}} get rid of Clayton and let Johnson succeed him. Clayton was well aware of their plans, and when he left the state briefly for New York on {{business}} concerning the Holford Bonds, he informed no one. When Johnson, who was at home some distance from the capital, found out he tried to head to the capital to take control and have Clayton arrested and impeached. He arrived too late. Subsequently, after Johnson made a speech demanding changes in the administration, the Minstrels started to target Johnson. On January 30, 1871, they introduced articles of impeachment in the General Assembly against him. The chief charge was that Johnson, acting as the President of the Senate, had administered the oath of office to Joseph Brooks, who had recently been elected as state senator, and then recognized him on the floor. Although this was legitimately within his powers as the lieutenant governor to do, he escaped impeachment by only two votes. The scrutiny of the proceedings seriously damaged his reputation, even though he had done nothing wrong, and his political career never recovered.|$|E

25|$|An {{alternative}} view {{of these}} events was proposed by a British historian, Stephen Christopher Rowell, where he believes that Gediminas never intended to become a Christian himself, since that would have offended the staunchly pagan inhabitants of Žemaitija and Aukštaitija. Both the pagans of Aukštaitija and the Orthodox Rus' threatened Gediminas with death if he decided to convert, where a similar scenario also happened to Mindaugas, which he <b>desperately</b> <b>wanted</b> to avoid.|$|E
25|$|The {{shock of}} the {{disaster}} reverberated into every corner of Philip's dominions, loosening everywhere the frayed bonds of his system, and threatening to complete what Essex's successful Cadiz campaign had left undone. After the defeat at Cadiz bankruptcy had stared the King of Spain {{in the face and}} {{in the aftermath of the}} Armada he was forced to suspend payment to creditors. Philip had declared the third major bankruptcy of his reign. Nevertheless, the King <b>desperately</b> <b>wanted</b> only a postponement of the Armada not an abandonment and therefore was obliged to borrow yet more money, but this time from his Italian holdings.|$|E
25|$|Firstly, they {{required}} paying in hard currency, not in worthless Soviet rubles. Stalin <b>desperately</b> <b>wanted</b> their weapons, including anti-aircraft guns, howitzers, anti-tank guns, machine guns etc., {{but he was}} critically short of money. As Russia had been a major wheat exporter before the First World War, he decided to expel his recalcitrant kulak peasant farmers to the wastes of Siberia and create huge collective farms on their land like the 50,000 hectare farm that Krupp had created in the North Caucasus. Thus, in 1930 and 1931, a huge deluge of Soviet wheat at slave labour prices flooded unsuspecting world markets, where surpluses already prevailed, thereby causing poverty and distress to North American farmers. However, Stalin secured the precious foreign currency to pay for German armaments.|$|E

25|$|Under these {{circumstances}} any political bargaining {{might well have}} been disastrous to Home Rule. Redmond <b>desperately</b> <b>wanted</b> and needed a rapid enactment of the Home Rule Act, and undoubtedly his words were a means to that end. He called on the country to support the Allied and British war effort and Britain's commitment under the Triple Entente; this was a calculated response to the situation principally in the belief that the attained measure of self-government would be granted in full after the war and to be in a stronger position to stave off a final partition of Northern Ireland. His added hope was that the common sacrifice by Irish nationalists and Unionists would bring them closer together, but above all that nationalists could not afford to allow Ulster Unionists to reap the benefit of being the only Irish to support the war effort, when they spontaneously enlisted in their 36th (Ulster) Division. He said Let Irishmen come together in the trenches and risk their lives together and spill their blood together, and I say there is no power on earth that when they come home can induce them to turn as enemies upon one another.|$|E
500|$|Lucas sent Huyck and Katz a 500-page {{transcript}} of their taped conversations {{to help them}} with the script. The first draft was written in six weeks, in early August 1982.

500|$|Of {{his time}} in the Army, Gore later stated, [...] "I didn't do the most, or run the gravest danger. But I was proud to wear my country's uniform." [...] He also later stated that his {{experience}} in Vietnam didn't change my conclusions about the war being a terrible mistake, but it struck me that opponents to the war, including myself, really did {{not take into account the}} fact that there were an awful lot of South Vietnamese who <b>desperately</b> <b>wanted</b> to hang on to what they called freedom. Coming face to face with those sentiments expressed by people who did the laundry and ran the restaurants and worked in the fields was something I was naively unprepared for.|$|E

[...] Her story Yasmina, about a young Bedouin woman who {{falls in love with a}} French officer and the [...] "tragedy this impossible love brings into her life", was published in a local French newspaper. Her mother, who had been suffering from heart problems, died in November 1897 of a heart attack, and was buried under the name of Fatma Mannoubia. Eberhardt was grief-stricken. Trophimowsky, who had been summoned when his partner's health had deteriorated but arrived after her death, showed no sympathy towards Eberhardt. When she told him she <b>desperately</b> <b>wanted</b> to die and rejoin her mother, he responded by calmly offering her his revolver, which she declined.|$|E

Later in the month, Disney set a May 1, 2015 release date. When asked about his decision to return, Whedon said, [...] "Avengers 2, it wasn't a tough decision.
