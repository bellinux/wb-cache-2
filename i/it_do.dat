5|$|In {{psychological}} assessments, the name-letter {{effect has}} been exploited to measure self-esteem. There {{are two types of}} self-esteem: explicit self-esteem (a person's deliberate and conscious evaluation of themselves) and implicit self-esteem. Because by definition implicit self-esteem is not accessible to introspection, measures of <b>it</b> <b>do</b> not rely on direct self-reports but on the degree to which objects associated with the self generate positive versus negative thoughts.|$|E
5|$|Groups are {{frequently}} studied through group representations. In their most general form, these {{consist of a}} choice of group, a set, and an action of the group on the set, that is, an operation which takes {{an element of the}} group and an element of the set and returns an element of the set. Most often, the set is a vector space, and the group represents symmetries of the vector space. For example, there is a group which represents the rigid rotations of space. This is a type of symmetry of space, because space itself does not change when it is rotated even though the positions of objects in <b>it</b> <b>do.</b> Noether used these sorts of symmetries in her work on invariants in physics.|$|E

25|$|Those {{trials in}} which the subject reacted to the go-signal impulsively without seeing a {{subsequent}} signal show a quick RT of about 600ms.

Those trials in which a decide signal was shown, and the participant decided not to press the go-button, also do not show a response time. Those trials in which a decide signal was shown, and the participant had not already enacted their impulse to press the go-button, but (in which it was theorised that they) had {{had the opportunity to}} decide what to do, show a comparatively slow RT, in this case closer to 1400ms.|$|E

25|$|Sphagnum is a genus of {{approximately}} 380 accepted species of mosses, {{commonly known as}} peat moss. Accumulations of Sphagnum can store water, since both living and dead plants can hold large quantities of water inside their cells; plants may hold 16–26 times as much water as their dry weight, depending on the species. The empty cells help retain water in drier conditions. Hence, as sphagnum moss grows, it can slowly spread into drier conditions, forming larger mires, both raised bogs and blanket bogs. These peat accumulations then provide habitat for {{a wide array of}} peatland plants, including sedges and ericaceous shrubs, as well as orchids and carnivorous plants. Sphagnum and the peat formed from <b>it</b> <b>do</b> not decay readily because of the phenolic compounds embedded in the moss's cell walls. In addition, bogs, like all wetlands, develop anaerobic soil conditions, which produces slower anaerobic decay rather than aerobic microbial action. Peat moss can also acidify its surroundings by taking up cations, such as calcium and magnesium, and releasing hydrogen ions. Under the right conditions, peat can accumulate to a depth of many meters. Different species of Sphagnum have different tolerance limits for flooding and pH, so any one peatland may have a number of different Sphagnum species.|$|E
25|$|The first {{incarnation}} of the Portuguese Cup was in 1912, but very few clubs could participate and thus {{it was not a}} regular competition, the fact which ended it in 1918, the Portuguese Federation doesn't take in account its existence. It was named Taça do Império since S.C. Império organized <b>it</b> (<b>do</b> not confuse with Taça Império, which was the trophy of the inaugural game at the National Stadium where the Champion and the Cup winner played against each other). In 1922 the Championship of Portugal (Campeonato de Portugal) was created and was played every season with all the clubs participating in elimination rounds, the winners were named Champions of Portugal (although the winners of the Championship of Portugal no longer count as Portuguese football champions) and it was the primary tournament in Portugal, until the creation of the round-robin competition in the middle 1930s. With the success of this competition {{and the beginning of the}} recently created and official Portuguese Championship, in the 1938–39 season the Taça de Portugal (Portuguese Cup) was created and the tournament quickly became the second-most important in Portugal. It is organized by the Portuguese Football Federation (Federação Portuguesa de Futebol) and is played by all the teams in the Primeira Liga, Segunda Liga (excluding the B teams), Campeonato Nacional de Seniores (excluding reserve teams), 22 District Championships runners-up and by 18 District Cups winners.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} is {{about a woman who}} teaches her partner how to love her in the right way, {{throughout}} which she uses sexual references. MTV News' Jocelyn Vena concluded that song has [...] "sassy" [...] lyrics, but its melody is soft enough and makes you forget that [...] "the track is actually kind of dirty". Chris Coplan of Consequence of Sound stated that during the interpretation of the lyrics, Rihanna is proud and sexual and her confidence comes from elsewhere. Rihanna reveals her sex fantasies through singing the lyrics: [...] "I'mma do <b>it</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>do</b> it/On the bed on the floor on the couch/Only cause your lips say make it to my mouth/Just because I can't kiss back/Doesn't mean you can't kiss that", which were described as the [...] "nastiest" [...] on the song by Brad Wete of Complex. As the song continues further, Rihanna is [...] "not-so-subtly" [...] instructing her lover within the lines [...] "It’s your turn now / Watch and learn now / Watch and learn how / If you learn how / I'll stay".|$|E

To the production staff's surprise, the scene would make the audience [...] "erupt with laughter" [...] when screened at animation conventions and college presentations, so they decided to insert it in this episode.|$|E

Where does it take you?" [...] A trademark of Thordendal is jazz fusion-like soloing and improvisation. He is also known for the usage of a [...] "breath controller" [...] device. Haake is known for his cross-rhythm drumming with [...] "jazzlike cadence". The vocal style of Jens Kidman varies between hardcore-style shouts and [...] "robotic" [...] death metal vocals.|$|E

500|$|In Part I, Varner offers {{considerable}} {{endorsement of}} Harean philosophy. Varner interprets Hare as understanding that utilitarianism derives from prescriptivism, and affirms Hare's argument on this point. He {{goes on to}} discuss the utility of Intuitive-Level System (ILS) rules; these are the rules that one lives by in day-to-day life, which, though ultimately justified by <b>it,</b> <b>do</b> not derive their content from utilitarian calculation. There are, for Varner, four key kinds of ILSs: [...] "common morality, personal morality, professional ethics, and laws". Though these are deontological in [...] "flavor", following the precepts of these ILSs is generally justified under two-level utilitarianism. Further arguments—these are original, rather than being derived from Hare's own—are then offered for Hare's prescriptivism.|$|E
500|$|The {{hypothesis}} of a reign {{more than three}} decades long for Nyuserre Ini is supported, albeit indirectly, by reliefs discovered in his solar temple showing him participating in a Sed festival. This festival was meant to rejuvenate the king and was normally first celebrated after 30 years of rule. Representations of the festival were part of the typical decorations of temples associated to the king during the Old Kingdom and mere depictions of <b>it</b> <b>do</b> not necessarily imply a long reign. For example, a relief showing [...] Sahure in the tunic of the Sed festival has been found in his mortuary temple, although both historical sources and archeological evidence agree that he ruled Egypt for less than 14 full years.|$|E
