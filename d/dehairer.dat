40|$|Many {{classes of}} alpaca fibres contain {{a certain amount}} of coarse fibres, which are strong and stiff, and cause {{discomfort}} to the end users of the alpaca fibre products. It is therefore desirable to separate the coarse fibres from the fine alpaca fibres. This paper reports trial results on alpaca <b>dehairing</b> using a cashmere <b>dehairing</b> machine. The diameters of alpaca fleece, dehaired alpaca fibres and removed alpaca fibres were analysed, and the fibre lengths before and after <b>dehairing</b> have been compared. The results indicate that it is feasible to <b>dehair</b> alpaca fibres using a cashmere <b>dehairing</b> facility. The dehaired alpaca fibres are cleaner, bulkier and softer, with around 1. 5 μm reduction in average fibre diameter, but the <b>dehairing</b> process shortens the dehaired fibre length considerably. The <b>dehairing</b> effectiveness of coarse fibre removal using the cashmere <b>dehairing</b> technology has also been discussed in this paper. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Cashmere is {{a luxury}} fiber with high {{international}} demand. Australian cashmere fleece is shorn rather than hand combed, and the shorn fleece contains a large quantity of coarse guard hair. Normally raw cashmere fleece is scoured first, followed by <b>dehairing</b> to eliminate the coarse guard hair. But scouring the unwanted guard hair consumes a large quantity of water, and increases the cost of cashmere processing in Australia. Ideally, the guard hair should be removed first and then the fine cashmere fibers are scoured for further processing. This paper reports trial results on <b>dehairing</b> greasy rather than scoured Australian cashmere fleece, {{with the aim of}} reducing scouring cost and water consumption. The quality of cashmere fibers after the conventional <b>dehairing</b> process and the new greasy <b>dehairing</b> process has been assessed.

40|$|Melanin is {{a natural}} pigment of skin and hair, which {{provides}} a protective function against sunlight. The non-removal of pigments from the skin gives the finished leather a patchy appearance. As leather industry is undergoing a paradigm shift towards bioprocessing, enzyme based <b>dehairing</b> and fibre opening are becoming ecologically important. However, the enzymatic <b>dehairing</b> and fiber opening of buff calfskins from certain origin results in non-removal of pigments.

30|$|The leather {{processing}} industry contributes {{significantly to the}} country’s economic development. Waste from the leather industry leads to environmental pollution. Alkaline proteases have <b>dehairing</b> properties {{and can be used}} in the leather {{processing industry}}. Conventional methods in leather processing involve the use of hydrogen sulphide and other chemicals which are pollutants. Thus, for environmental reasons, the enzymatic <b>dehairing</b> process has more advantages over the chemical <b>dehairing</b> process (Andersen 1998). Proteases are used during the soaking, <b>dehairing</b> and bating states of preparing skins and hides. Pancreatic proteases are used in the bating process and the use of microbial alkaline proteases are popular (Varela et al. 1997). Alkaline proteases swell hair roots and attack hair follicle proteins, resulting in the easy removal of hair. These enzymes have been widely studied and their production from Bacillus sp. has gained momentum; moreover, the high activity and stability of these enzymes at various temperature and pH ranges have also attracted the attention of researchers. <b>Dehairing</b> proteases have been characterized from various Bacillus sp., e.g. B. subtilis 11 QDB 32 (Varela et al. 1997), B. amyloliquefaciens (George et al. 1995), B. subtilis K 2 (Hameed et al. 1996; Hameed et al. 1999) and B. circulans (Subba Rao et al. 2009).|$|R

40|$|<b>Dehairing</b> {{is one of}} {{the highly}} polluting {{operations}} in the leather industry. The conventional lime-sulfide process used for <b>dehairing</b> produces large amounts of sulfide, which poses serious toxicity and disposal problems. This operation also involves hair destruction, a process that leads to increased chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD), and total suspended solid (TSS) loads in the effluent. With these concerns in mind, enzyme-assisted <b>dehairing</b> has often been proposed as an alternative method. The main enzyme preparations so far used involved keratinases. The present paper reports on the purification of an extracellular keratinase (KERUS) newly isolated from Brevibacillus brevis strain US 575. Matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS) analysis revealed that the purified enzyme was a monomer with a molecular mass of 29121. 11 Da. The sequence of the 27 N-terminal residues of KERUS showed high homology with those of Bacillus keratinases. Optimal activity was achieved at pH 8 and 40 °C. Its thermoactivity and thermostability were upgraded in the presence of 5 mM Ca(2 +). The enzyme was completely inhibited by phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and diiodopropyl fluorophosphates (DFP), which suggests that it belongs to the serine protease family. KERUS displayed higher levels of hydrolysis, substrate specificity, and catalytic efficiency than NUE 12 MG and KOROPON® MK EG keratinases. The enzyme also exhibited powerful keratinolytic activity that made it able to accomplish the entire feather-biodegradation process on its own. The kerUS gene encoding KERUS was cloned, sequenced, and expressed in Escherichia coli. The biochemical properties of the extracellular purified recombinant enzyme (rKERUS) were similar to those of native KERUS. Overall, the findings provide strong support for the potential candidacy of this enzyme as an effective and eco-friendly alternative to the conventional chemicals used for the <b>dehairing</b> of rabbit, goat, sheep and bovine hides in the leather processing industry...|$|R

To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of chemical <b>dehairing</b> of cattle hides on the prevalence of Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 and the levels of aerobic bacteria and Enterobacteriaceaeon carcasses. Samples from 240 control (conventionally processed) and 240 treated (chemically dehaired before hide removal) hides (immediately after stunning but before treatment) and preevisceration carcasses (immediately after hide removal) were obtained from four visits to a commercial beef processing plant.

30|$|Cow dung, a {{cheap and}} easily {{available}} source of energy, {{was used as}} the substrate for the production of alkaline protease by solid-state fermentation using the Bacillus subtilis strain VV. In order to achieve the maximum yield of this enzyme, the following optimum process parameters are needed: fermentation period (72 h), pH (10.0), moisture content (140 %), inoculum (25 %), temperature (30 – 40 °C), carbon source (2 % (w/w) maltose) and nitrogen source (1 % (w/w) urea). The protease was stable over a broad temperature range (30 – 50 °C) and pH (8.0 - 10.0), with maximum activity at 50 °C and pH 10.0. Among the divalent ions tested, Ca 2 + (0.01 M) increased enzyme activity. The purified protease, after being subjected to sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, was found to have a molecular mass of 38.5 kDa.

40|$|Contamination {{of fresh}} meat by {{pathogenic}} and spoilage microorganisms can occur at any {{stage of the}} slaughter process. Pathogens which are frequently found in fresh meat and which pose a public health problem include Salmonella spp. Campylobacter spp. and Yersinia spp. Contamination with spoilage bacteria affects the storage stability and shelf life of meats. Factors that contribute to meat spoilage include physical damage, biochemical changes in the meat tissues and the activity of microorganisms, of which bacteria are undoubtedly the most important. Fresh meats present a rich medium {{for the support of}} microbial growth and will ultimately be rendered unacceptable to consumers as a consequence of spoilage due to such growth. The source of spoilage bacteria can be the slaughter animals themselves, the environment, water and personnel working in the processing plants. This study was conducted to determine the effect of some processing operations on the level of contamination of the pig carcass with aerobic bacteria and to establish microbial quality control points based on the Hazards Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) principles. As a component of the HACCP system and a step in the setting up of an HACCP plan for microbial quality control of fresh carcass meat, this study aims at identifying hazards at various stages of processing, evaluating preventive measures and establishing critical control points. Where appropriate, corrective measures to ensure that bacterial contamination is within an acceptable level are recommended. The study was carried out at a processing plant in the North Island of New Zealand during the period April to July 1998. Based on observations at the plant, a flow chart of pig processing was drawn up. A number of processing stages were selected as points where potential risks of bacterial contamination were most likely to occur. These points initially included <b>dehairing,</b> polishing and scraping, evisceration, and inspection. Eight visits to the abattoir were made and a total of 32 paired swab samples from carcasses at each process stage were collected. With four process stages selected for sampling, the total number of samples was 128. In addition, 12 scalding tank water samples were collected for analysis. All samples were processed in the Microbiology Laboratory at Massey University. The aerobic plate count (APC) technique employing incubation at 30 °C for 3 days was used for enumeration of aerobic bacteria. A matrix table was designed for entering APC data after each count. The mean of colony forming units per square cm (CFU/cm 2) for pig carcass surfaces and CFU/ml for scalding water were calculated and log 10 transformation was performed. The highest mean APC was found after the carcasses had passed the <b>dehairing</b> machine (5. 1 log 10 /cm 2, ST. D. = 0. 57) and the lowest number before the <b>dehairing</b> step (4. 31 log 10 /cm 2, ST. D. = 0. 61). A rapid increase in APC at the <b>dehairing</b> stage indicated a heavy recontamination of the pig carcass with bacteria from the equipment and from detritus accumulated during the operation. After the operation, the count gradually decreased to 4. 4 log 10 /cm 2, ST. D. = 0. 38 at the post-evisceration point but then slightly rose again to 4. 5 log 10 /cm 2, ST. D. = 0. 4 at the post-inspection step. The increase in the APC at the <b>dehairing</b> stage by 0. 8 log 10 /cm 2 (p = 0. 0002, n = 16) is significant. There was little change in the APC at the polishing and scraping and evisceration stages. There was an insignificant difference of 0. 2 log 10 /cm 2 in the APC between samples taken at the start {{and at the end of}} the shift. The scalding water temperature fluctuated between 60 °C and 67. 5 °C (mean = 63. 2, n = 12). Bacterial contamination of the scalding water remained almost unchanged with time (2. 55 log 10 /ml at the beginning and 2. 62 log 10 /ml at the end of the shift). An expected inverse correlation between scalding water counts and water temperature could not be verified. Although this study is confined to the microbiological assessment of only a few operational stages that can contribute to the storage quality of fresh pork, the results showed that recontamination of the pig carcass at the <b>dehairing</b> stage is serious and may pose potential safety and quality hazards. Control of bacterial contamination at this step is likely to have a beneficial effect on the microbial quality and safety of the final products. A quality Critical Control Point should be established at the <b>dehairing</b> step which can be considered as a safety CCP as well. However, some technological modification at this step such as installation of hot water showers to make the operation "specifically designed", may be needed to meet the criteria for establishing a CCP. At the polishing and scraping step the results of the study indicated a slight decline in bacterial numbers, provided that brushing and washing of the carcasses was done properly. Any deviation from the normal procedure e. g. inadequate water supply to the brush and scraping table, reduced frequency of hand and knife washing, or increased frequency of touching the carcass by the worker's hands, is likely to result in an increased level of bacterial contamination. Monitoring measures and corrective actions at this stage could be crucial for maintaining an effective CCP. At the evisceration step, preventive measures such as plugging or tying the anus should be considered. This step could be an important CCP for both quality and safety. Further investigations are required to assess the effect of meat inspection procedures on the spread of bacteria from multiple incisions of lymph nodes, internal organs and tonsils. If this step were to be considered a CCP, it would mainly have safety implications...|$|R

In support of this programme, and as part of a large risk-based study, a risk assessment and cost-effectiveness analysis were developed to investigate the effect of the following interventions: vaccination, feeding of organic acids, rodent control, anal bunging and washing and drying of the carcass at <b>dehairing...</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a use-wear study {{that deals with}} microwear on stone endscrapers used on one worked material: animal skins. The {{first part of the}} study defines and {{describes}} the process of rendering freshly skinned pelts into functional leather or rawhide products, addressing confusing terminology found in the literature as well. Problems with past use-wear experiments dealing with animal skins are also confronted and explained. The second part of the study examines endscrapers used to flesh and <b>dehair</b> bison hides and compares the use-wear traces left on the tool edge by each activity. This suite of characteristics is then compared to those found on an assemblage of Clovis-age scrapers from the Gault site in central Texas...|$|R
40|$|Besides mixing, the {{dissolved}} barium distribution i the oceanic {{water column}} is controlled {{to a significant}} extent also by particle-solute interaction. In vitro uptake experiments involving diatom cultures suggest hat passive uptake prevails over active uptake. The overall effect of these processes i that barium behaves as a non-limiting nutrient element with ratios of dissolved over particulate concentrations varying between 100 and 1000. Uptake of barium by plankton particles eventually results {{in the formation of}} barium sulphate (baryte). There is increasing evidence that this baryte formation is closely linked with the formation of micro-environments composed of detrital organic matter, in which BaSO 4 saturation is eventually reached during the process of bacterial decay (Bishop, 1988; <b>Dehairs</b> et al., 1980). This mechanism sets the link between oceanic baryte and oceanic productivity and as a result oceanic baryte is now increasingly recognised to represent a good proxy for palaeoproductivity (Francois eta /., 1995). Using an extensive data set obtained mainly from the Southern Ocean we investigated the different main processes affecting the oceanic barium cycle. For particulate barium in surface waters regional variability can be important and this is clearly associated with variation of planktonic production and biomass uch as occurring, for instance, across the Polar Front Zone (PFZ). We observed that on a time scale of approximately three weeks water column stocks of micro-crystalline baryte co-vary with seasonal change in surface water productivity (<b>Dehairs</b> et al. 1997). This phase lag of about hree weeks is consistent with the time lapse required for baryte to be formed during in vitro experiments using decaying detritus from a diatom culture. This proces...|$|R
40|$|An {{antigenic}} glycosylated cysteine protease {{has been}} purified from the latex of Euphorbia nivulia Buch. -Ham. It exhibits remarkable protease {{activity in the}} presence of metal ions, oxidizing agents, organic solvents, and detergents. This enzyme showed potential role in leather processing industry due to its <b>dehairing</b> activity for animal hide without hydrolyzing fibrous proteins, producing, by this way, a better quality product. The enzyme can also be used for silver recovering from X-ray plates. In addition, the stability (temperature and surfactants) and hydrolysis of blood stain data also revealed its application in detergent industries. Agriculturally, this protease finds application in biocontrol process against the infectious management of root knot nematode, Meloidogyne incognita. Biologically, it shows noticeable wound healing, haemostatic and antibacterial activity...|$|R
