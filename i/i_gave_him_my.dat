2500|$|Some {{months after}} Truffaut's Stolen Kisses Claude Jade starred in Alfred Hitchcock's Topaz (1969), as Michèle Picard, a secret agent's anxious daughter, {{married to a}} {{reporter}} (Michel Subor). Recommended to Hitchcock by Truffaut, she was 19 years old when cast, with Dany Robin playing her mother. Hitchcock said he chose the two actresses to provide glamor, and later quipped, [...] "Claude Jade is a rather quiet young lady, but I wouldn't guarantee [...] about her behavior in a taxi". Jade recounted that they [...] "talked in a Paris hotel about cooking, and <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>my</b> recipe for soufflé and told him I liked Strangers on a Train, and that was that." ...|$|E

60|$|Don. Louisa. Sir, in {{obedience}} to your commands, <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>my</b> hand within this hour.|$|E
60|$|I cannot tell <b>him</b> very well. <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>my</b> hand, {{which he}} holds in his.|$|R

60|$|So <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> {{the five}} francs, and explain my little scheme {{of making it}} a loan, and not a gift; and then <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>my</b> address.|$|R
60|$|He fervently {{replied that}} indeed indeed {{they would have}} been. <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>my</b> hand again.|$|E
6000|$|... "I did. Remembering Jake's theory, I {{saw it was}} {{possible}} {{he had come to}} push me off, but I knew he hadn't. That's why <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>my</b> hand afterwards." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So," [...] said Mary, [...] "I could but {{answer him}} as I did, Sadler and Somer being both nigh. <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>my</b> purse, with {{all there was}} therein. How much was it, Andrew?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Chief Pontiac is mistaken, <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>my</b> word upon it," [...] {{answered}} Dave. And then he added. [...] "What do {{you propose}} to do with me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yesterday,' {{answered}} the earl, 'my two sons were seized, while thy were hunting, by a monster who dwells on those mountains yonder, and he vows {{that he will}} not let them go unless <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>my</b> daughter to wife.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The priest {{comes of}} a White Rose house--I trust not him. Ay, goodwife, beware of showing thyself to <b>him.</b> <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>my</b> dues, {{that he may}} have no {{occasion}} against me or Sir Lancelot, but I would not have him pry into knowledge that concerns him not.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Festing {{spread out}} his hands. [...] "Certainly. What can I do? Charnock hustled me into it; {{he has a}} way of getting {{somebody}} else to do the things he shirks. But <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>my</b> word." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{met him in}} {{the hall}} {{at the foot of}} the stairs, and put a witless cheeriness into the voice I bade him good-evening with, while <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>my</b> hand and led the way into the parlor.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>my</b> general {{impression}} {{as to the}} future. The bare idea [...] that Parnell might find no inconsiderable following came upon him [...] {{as if it had}} been a thunder-clap. He listened, and catechised, and [...] knit his brow.|$|E
2500|$|On 21 March, President Jacques Chirac {{announced}} {{his support for}} Sarkozy. Chirac pointed out that Sarkozy had been chosen as presidential candidate for the ruling UMP party, and said: [...] "So it is totally natural that <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>my</b> vote and my support." [...] To focus on his campaign, Sarkozy stepped down as interior minister on 26 March.|$|R
5000|$|May 5, 1947 [...] "But have <b>I</b> <b>given</b> <b>Him</b> <b>my</b> heart? There {{must be some}} holding back, or my {{difficulties}} with people wouldn't be as they are. Through long habit & also because of native ego (that is --a desire rampant in me from birth to impress & dominate people) I am weak and unconsciously become of the devil's party by thinking of myself instead of Him." ...|$|R
6000|$|CHR. <b>I</b> have <b>given</b> <b>Him</b> <b>my</b> faith, and sworn my {{allegiance}} to Him; how, then, can I go back from this, {{and not be}} hanged as a traitor? ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>my</b> hand, of course, because I {{could not}} help it; but the sympathy I had been {{prepared}} to feel for Clara's father was immediately soured by his appearance, and the wheedling, unreal tones in which he spoke.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>my</b> card. My cards, {{being part}} of my wedding outfit, {{necessarily}} had the false name printed on them--Mrs. Eustace Woodville. The servant showed me into a front room on the ground-floor, and disappeared with my card in his hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ezra, my father! our father! He {{followed}} me. I {{wanted him}} to come in. I said you would let him come in. And he said No, he would not--not now, but to-morrow. And he begged for money from me. And <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>my</b> purse, and he went away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "God!" [...] {{cried the}} man. [...] "Is there {{no way that}} you can dissuade him? Promise him {{anything}}. Anything that you want. I have money, more money than that poor fool could imagine there was in the whole world. With it he can buy anything that money will purchase, fine clothes and food and women, all the women he wants. Tell him this and tell him that if he will spare you <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>my</b> word that <b>I</b> will fetch it all to him." ...|$|R
6000|$|She smiled faintly as she answered, [...] "This {{is not the}} age of savagery, Ralph; {{your fingers}} are {{bruising}} me. What answer could <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> after <b>my</b> promise to you? I said, 'No.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And how {{may that}} be?" [...] said the prior; [...] "the false fiend hath deceived me; <b>I</b> have <b>given</b> <b>him</b> <b>my</b> soul, but have {{received}} no worldly benefit in return. Brother! dear brother! how may I escape?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She can't, {{unless she}} has freed her hands," [...] he admitted. [...] "Let us touch hands." [...] <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>my</b> left hand, and sitting thus, with all hands {{accounted}} for, we entered into {{communication with the}} [...] "spirit" [...] that was busy in {{the centre of the}} table.|$|E
6000|$|... "And leave Eva! They'd have to {{look very}} sharp before they could do that. But of course I'll come." [...] Then <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>my</b> blessing, told him what {{arrangements}} I had made for his income, {{and went down to}} my breakfast, which was to be my last meal in Britannula.|$|E
60|$|I {{told him}} it was a {{reasonable}} caution in him, and I would assure him that, whatever he said should not do them any prejudice; and, to convince him of it, <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>my</b> word that I would not put them to death on any account whatsoever, merely for his sake.|$|E
6000|$|He {{played and}} paid {{with his head}} and it's right that we pay him back, [...] And <b>give</b> <b>him</b> more than he gave, for he comes in here as a guest: [...] So <b>I</b> will <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>my</b> head.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I do {{not know}} what answer you want. When George was here, I hardly spoke to him. If Uncle Michel is afraid of me, <b>I</b> will <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>my</b> solemn promise never to marry any one without his permission.' ...|$|R
60|$|As we rode along, my kind friend {{questioned}} me closely about myself, and <b>I</b> {{ended by}} <b>giving</b> <b>him</b> <b>my</b> entire history.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{next morning}} at eleven, sharp, I rang the {{door-bell}} of that World's Fair main building. After about three-quarters of an hour an old nigger man about eighty showed up and asked what I wanted. <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>my</b> business card, and said I {{wanted to see the}} colonel. He showed me in.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, perhaps I {{ought to}} tell you that I haven't been inside the Saratoga Club or bet on the races since I've been here. That's my name in full,"--and <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>my</b> card,--"and I'm in the {{literary}} line; that is, I'm the editor of a magazine in New York--the Every Other Week." ...|$|E
6000|$|His departing guest {{looked at}} him mildly, almost benignantly, from head to foot, and then with closed eyes and some {{collapse}} of strength, [...] "I'm afraid so, I can't stand more," [...] he went on. <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>my</b> arm and we crossed the threshold. As we passed out I heard Miss Searle break into loud weeping.|$|E
6000|$|... "Moreover, {{it happens}} that Governor Maguire is a {{personal}} friend of mine, and I shall call upon him {{and tell him that}} I have a sick friend staying with me and, without letting him know who you are, say that <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>my</b> word of honour that you will, while with me, remain in the grounds, and will make no inquiries concerning his fortifications and plans of defence. He will understand what I mean, and if anyone should make a report to him it will, at any rate, cause no trouble; though I do not say that he might not feel obliged to give me notice that you had best go.|$|R
