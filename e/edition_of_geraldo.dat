He joined Coritiba's main squad in 2010, playing his first Série B game on May 8, 2010, at Estádio dos Aflitos, Recife, when his club was defeated 3-1 to Náutico and he came {{as a substitute for}} Renatinho.

50|$|Fabiana de Barros did {{not forget}} the history that led to her rich artistic life. Since 1989, she very {{actively}} runs the photographic legacy <b>of</b> <b>Geraldo</b> de Barros. She organised important shows at the Museum Ludwig in Cologne, Germany (1999), The Élysée Museum in Lausanne, Switzerland (2000) and The MoMA in New-York (2007). She also took good care <b>of</b> the <b>edition</b> <b>of</b> the books SOBRAS and FOTOFORMAS, that reproduce most of the photographic work <b>of</b> <b>Geraldo</b> de Barros. She also produced a long-feature film about his work, directed by Michel Favre: Sobras em Obras presented at the 30th Mostra of São Paulo, at Beyrouth's Docuday and at the festival Visions du Réel in Nyon, Switzerland. The movie was primed twice: once in Rio de Janeiro in 2000 and once in Solznok, Hungary.|$|R

5000|$|Zeena Schreck {{served as}} Radio Werewolf co-director from 1988-1993, the group's most {{prolific}} period, which saw {{the release of}} their recordings Songs for the End of the World, The Lightning and the Sun, Bring Me the Head <b>of</b> <b>Geraldo</b> Rivera!, Witchcraft-Boots: A Tribute to the Sinatras [...] and Love Conquers All.|$|R

50|$|Delaney {{specialised}} in up-tempo {{dance hall}} music, often carrying a rock 'n' roll label but closer in spirit to that <b>of</b> <b>Geraldo</b> and Joe Loss. As with many similar artists, the music he performed became less popular after The Beatles entered the musical scene. He remained active touring in the UK, notably in holiday resorts, nonetheless.|$|R
5000|$|Reasons for loss: The Universal {{executives}} disliked that Geraldo only {{showed the}} children having fun {{and not the}} adults. On top of that, his fundraising performance proved very disappointing for a final task, falling far short of both his previous efforts this season, and the other candidates weren't nearly as complimentary <b>of</b> <b>Geraldo</b> as they were Leeza.|$|R
