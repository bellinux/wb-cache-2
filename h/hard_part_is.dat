You hear the same music when Dussander is turning the tables on Todd, which makes you remember the first scene... You hope people are subliminally making the connection that the tables are turning back and forth.|$|E

2500|$|The Dillinger Escape Plan {{announced}} their departure from Relapse Records in 2009. The band had become {{dissatisfied with the}} music industry and music media, and decided {{to create their own}} record label to release their fourth studio album.

You listen to every single song back to front a million times, it'd be worn out to death before you moved onto another record. You'd read everything in the booklet, you'd read all the lyrics, you'd read all the notes, you'd discover something new." [...] Speaking to Kerrang! about the decision, he said: [...] "The most important thing was to keep evolving and changing. We didn't want to be stuck in some long contract that won't be relevant in a few years time... Or possibly even tomorrow. So half out of necessity, half out of choice, we decided to do this ourselves.

Of course this insight alone is easy to make; the <b>hard</b> <b>part</b> <b>is</b> encoding this huge amount of information into an understandable and easy-to-represent form. With TDA, there is a mathematical interpretation when the information is a homology group.
