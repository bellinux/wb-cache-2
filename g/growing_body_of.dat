5|$|Delayed gratification, or {{deferred}} gratification, is {{the ability}} to resist the temptation for an immediate reward and wait for a later reward. Generally, delayed gratification is associated with resisting a smaller but more immediate reward in order to receive a larger or more enduring reward later. A <b>growing</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> literature has linked the ability to delay gratification to a host of other positive outcomes, including academic success, physical health, psychological health, and social competence.|$|E

A <b>growing</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> research, though, has examined environmentally persistent E. coli which can survive for extended periods outside a host.|$|E
5|$|A <b>growing</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> {{research}} suggests that self-control is akin to a muscle that can be strengthened through practice. In other words, self-control abilities are malleable, a fact {{that can be a}} source of hope for those who struggle with this skill. In psychotherapy, treatment for impulse-control issues often involves teaching individuals to realize the downsides of acting on immediate urges and in turn to practice delaying gratification. In anxiety disorders, this process occurs through exposure to a feared situation – which is very uncomfortable at first, but eventually becomes tolerable and even trains a person's mind and body that these situations are less threatening than originally feared. Exposure therapy is only effective if an individual can delay gratification and resist the urge to escape the situation early on. To shed insight on the tradeoff between short- and long-term gains, therapists might also help individuals construct a pro-con list of a certain behavior, with sections for short-term and long-term outcomes. For maladaptive coping behaviors such as self-injury, substance use or avoidance, there are generally no long-term pros. Meanwhile, abstinence from acting on a harmful urge (i.e., delayed gratification) generally results in long-term benefits. This realization can be a powerful impetus for change.|$|E

40|$|A {{hallmark}} {{feature of}} addiction, including nicotine dependence, is persistent drug use despite the adverse {{consequences of such}} behaviour.

However, despite <b>growing</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> research investigating both altered reward sensitivity and error monitoring deficits there is a paucity of empirical work investigating sensitivity to punishment in nicotine dependence. The main aim of this thesis was therefore to investigate the effects of satiation level (abstinent/satiated) and smoking history (current/former/never) on behavioural measures of punishment sensitivity. Furthermore, the related phenomenon of loss aversion (the tendency for individuals to be more sensitive to losses compared to gains) was investigated in former smokers alongside a range of self-control indices...|$|R

Drawing upon <b>growing</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> ethnographic literature within anthropology, geography and sociology, this paper unravels the complex and ambivalent ways in which laypeople think about the biological and genetic constitution of racial identities.

40|$|Abstract In {{contrast}} with neoclassical economic models that assume that individ-uals hold preferences independently of others, there exist <b>growing</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> research demonstrating that preferences are often interdependent and based upon relative com-parisons. This paper reviews research concerning salary dispersion within firms through {{the framework of}} four hypotheses that are generated by evolutionary perspectives. Con-trary to some characterizations of evolutionary social science, this review presumes that there exist multiple evolutionary perspectives that have applicability to matters of practical importance. Basic findings include recognition of a strong evolutionarily-sensible preference for relatively high salary standings that is independent of absolute salary amounts. Synthetic findings include identification of research problems that future, directed studies can profitably address. For practical application, my review finds that evolved preferences appear more aligned with salary structures that are dispersed relatively evenly among co-workers when compared with tournament-style compensation patterns...|$|R

Rather than providing answers to specific questions of impacts, SMs aim to produce searchable databases of studies, along with detailed descriptive information. These maps (consisting of a report, a database, and sometimes a geographical information system) can prove highly useful for research, policy and practice communities, by providing assessments of knowledge gaps (subjects requiring additional research), knowledge gluts (subjects where full SR is possible), and patterns across the research literature that promote best practice and direct research resources towards the highest quality research.

25|$|The {{chloroplast}} membranes sometimes protrude {{out into}} the cytoplasm, forming a stromule, or stroma-containing tubule. Stromules are very rare in chloroplasts, and are much more common in other plastids like chromoplasts and amyloplasts in petals and roots, respectively. They may exist to increase the chloroplast's surface area for cross-membrane transport, because they are often branched and tangled with the endoplasmic reticulum. When they were first observed in 1962, some plant biologists dismissed the structures as artifactual, claiming that stromules were just oddly shaped chloroplasts with constricted regions or dividing chloroplasts. However, there is a <b>growing</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> evidence that stromules are functional, integral features of plant cell plastids, not merely artifacts.|$|E

Greater negative affectivity was associated with more avoidance of high-loss options; greater positive affectivity was associated with more choices from high-gain options.
