25|$|The {{feeling that}} the early 20th century was an era of {{economic}} growth due to technological advances contrasted dramatically with {{the standard of living}} of lower social classes. The growth of the previous decades led to an unprecedented population explosion starting in 1929. The Great Depression caused the collapse of the nitrate industry in the north, leaving 60,000 unemployed, which added to the decline in agricultural exports, resulting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>total</b> <b>number</b> for the unemployed to be about 300,000 nationwide. These unemployed workers saw Santiago and its booming industry as the only chance to survive. Many migrants arrived in Santiago with nothing and thousands had to survive on the streets due to the great difficulty in finding a place they could rent. Widespread disease, including tuberculosis, claimed the lives of hundreds of the homeless. Unemployment and living costs increased dramatically whilst the salaries of the population of Santiago fell.|$|E

50|$|The {{number of}} regular Sanggunian members {{is based on}} the income of the {{province}} as classified by the Department of Finance. The Commission on Elections issues resolutions allocating the number of regular members of the Sanggunian a province may elect should a province's income classification change. First-class and second-class provinces are entitled to 10 regularly elected members, 8 for third- and fourth-class provinces and 6 for fifth- and sixth-class provinces. Exceptions to the rule are provinces which are divided into more than five congressional districts.

30|$|Congruent {{with the}} {{observed}} trend, the 87 intensities with the EMS- 98 estimations were integrated with 109 additional MCS intensities increased {{by half a}} degree, which resulted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>total</b> <b>number</b> of 196 macroseismic observations (Fig.  1 c). The extra uncertainty added by this procedure outweighs the disadvantage of an otherwise extremely partial scenario that only considered a small epicentral area. The integrated MCS points are characterized by low intensities (87 points with intensity V and 17 with intensity V–VI). The intensity increase of half a degree is conservative and it accounts for low damage level on a wide area.|$|E
30|$|We {{adopted an}} {{alternative}} naïve equation that measures {{the percentages of}} information loss after anonymization, denoted by Disruption (Ɗ). The disruption value is a benchmark that gives a general indication {{of the size of}} anonymization loss.

Each block of data is a data bag produced by grouping a set of tuples.
