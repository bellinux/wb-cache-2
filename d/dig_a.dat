5|$|At Syracuse, he {{repaired}} {{the city}} walls and the temples of the gods. He had new roads built and pushed to keep roads in good condition. He had planned to rebuild the palace of Polycrates at Samos, to finish the temple of Didymaean Apollo at Ephesus and to found a city {{high up in the}} Alps. He planned to <b>dig</b> <b>a</b> canal through the Isthmus of Corinth in Greece and sent a chief centurion to survey the work.|$|E

50|$|A skid-steer loader can {{sometimes}} be used {{in place of a}} large excavator by <b>digging</b> <b>a</b> hole from the inside. The skid loader first <b>digs</b> <b>a</b> ramp leading {{to the edge of the}} desired excavation. It then uses the ramp to carry material out of the hole. The skid loader reshapes the ramp making it steeper and longer as the excavation deepens. This method is particularly useful for <b>digging</b> under <b>a</b> structure where overhead clearance does not allow for the boom of a large excavator, such as <b>digging</b> <b>a</b> basement under an existing house. Several companies make backhoe attachments for skid-steers. These are more effective for <b>digging</b> in <b>a</b> small area than the method above and can work in the same environments. Other applications may consist of transporting raw material around a job site, or assisting in the rough grading process.|$|R

In 2007, Digs launched What the <b>Digs,</b> <b>a</b> mash-up style show which consisted of Digs' previous showed mixed up, and edited in a surreal manner. Following this, Digs created Late Night Television with JR Digs which ran for one season.|$|R
5|$|Collins and his {{partners}} brought in slaves from Africa to <b>dig</b> <b>a</b> canal from Lake Phelps to the Scuppernong River. The canal served two purposes: first, {{as a means of}} transporting goods and people to and from the plantation; and second, it served as a massive drainage ditch as the slaves of Somerset Place worked to drain the surrounding swamps. Later, the canal system was expanded to provide irrigation for the rice and corn fields of the plantation.|$|E
5|$|After {{their water}} ran out, the Beck/Fiszer group {{developed}} a routine whereby {{some of the}} group worked to <b>dig</b> <b>a</b> well, while others watched out for approaching Germans, and yet others ventured outside the bunker to scavenge for useful items. The group eventually dug their way to two water canals and built a well. On November 17, during an excursion outside the bunker, the group made contact with a small partisan unit, also in hiding, led by a Russian soldier POW who had been liberated during the uprising. Subsequently, several of the group would join the partisans for small scale attacks on German troops. The group survived until the entry of the Red Army in mid-January.|$|E

Mr. Tod, a fox, has multiple homes but keeps moving. Often Tommy lodges in his homes. Peeping through the bedroom window, the rabbits see Tommy asleep in Mr. Tod's bed, and, peeping through the kitchen window, they see the table set for a meal. They realise the bunnies are alive, but shut in the oven. They try to <b>dig</b> <b>a</b> tunnel into the house but hide when Mr. Tod suddenly arrives in a very bad temper, which has caused him to move house.|$|E

After Bart breaks down crying, Homer finally has had enough: he decides to <b>dig</b> <b>a</b> tunnel and rescue Bart himself. Groundskeeper Willie sees this and joins Homer, starting an excavation operation. Bart is finally rescued with help from Sting and other residents, and Willie puts up a small warning sign near the well to prevent future accidents.|$|E
5|$|On 22 April 2012, Chen {{escaped from}} house arrest. Chen's fellow activist Hu Jia stated that Chen had been {{planning}} escape for a long time, and had previously attempted to <b>dig</b> <b>a</b> tunnel for escape. In {{the weeks leading up}} to his escape, Chen gave his guards the impression that he was ill in bed, and stopped appearing outside the house, which allowed him several days before any absence would be discovered. Under cover of darkness and with the help of his wife, Chen climbed over the wall around his house, breaking his foot in the process.|$|E
5|$|To keep up morale {{following}} Amherst's departure, Maxwell began organising {{his remaining}} 200 men (and one woman) {{to secure their}} position and gather supplies. The men were divided into parties, with one ordered to <b>dig</b> <b>a</b> well while another returned to the wreck of Alceste to salvage what weapons and equipment they could. A third party was ordered to clear a path to the island's central hill, where a cool cave {{could be used as}} a larder and trees felled to form a protective stockade. By the end of the first day the well was producing a steady supply of water.|$|E

5|$|As {{punishment}} for his escape, he {{is forced to}} repeatedly <b>dig</b> <b>a</b> grave-sized hole in the prison camp yard, fill it back in, and then be beaten. The prisoners observe his persecution, singing spirituals. Finally, as the other prisoners watch from {{the windows of the}} bunkhouse, an exhausted Luke collapses in the hole, begging God for mercy and pleads with the bosses not to hit him again. Believing Luke is finally broken, the Captain stops the punishment. Boss Paul warns Luke that he will be killed if ever he runs away again, which Luke promises in tears not to do. The prisoners begin to lose their idealized image of Luke, and one tears up the photograph of Luke with the women.|$|E
5|$|As the two armies {{faced the}} {{stalemate}} of trench warfare at Petersburg in July 1864, Burnside {{agreed to a}} plan suggested by a regiment of former coal miners in his corps, the 48th Pennsylvania: <b>dig</b> <b>a</b> mine under a fort named Elliot's Salient in the Confederate entrenchments and ignite explosives there to achieve a surprise breakthrough. The fort was destroyed on July 30 in {{what is known as}} the Battle of the Crater. Because of interference from Meade, Burnside was ordered, only hours before the infantry attack, not to use his division of black troops, which had been specially trained for this mission. He was forced to use untrained white troops instead. He could not decide which division to choose as a replacement, so he had his three subordinate commanders draw lots.|$|E
5|$|During extreme conditions, some frogs enter a {{state of}} torpor and remain {{inactive}} for months. In colder regions, many species of frog hibernate in winter. Those that live on land such as the American toad (Bufo americanus) <b>dig</b> <b>a</b> burrow and make a hibernaculum in which to lie dormant. Others, less proficient at digging, find a crevice or bury themselves in dead leaves. Aquatic species such as the American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) normally sink {{to the bottom of}} the pond where they lie, semi-immersed in mud but still able to access the oxygen dissolved in the water. Their metabolism slows down and they live on their energy reserves. Some frogs can even survive being frozen. Ice crystals form under the skin and in the body cavity but the essential organs are protected from freezing by a high concentration of glucose. An apparently lifeless, frozen frog can resume respiration and the heart beat can restart when conditions warm up.|$|E

5|$|During {{the hunting}} trip, Jimbo proclaims Kenny his honorary nephew, {{upsetting}} Stan. When night falls, Cartman {{tells the story}} of Scuzzlebutt, a creature that has a piece of celery in place of one of its hands and Patrick Duffy for a leg. The boys are skeptical, so Cartman decides to dress up as the creature the next morning in order to convince and scare them. When he disappears the next morning, the others set out to find him. They then see Cartman disguised as Scuzzlebutt and start shooting at him. When they catch up with Cartman {{at the base of the}} mountain, Stan tries to shoot him in order to redeem himself in his uncle's eyes. However, he is unable to do so and the delay gives Cartman time to remove the costume. At a lower elevation, Randy orders the South Park residents to <b>dig</b> <b>a</b> trench to divert the lava away from the town.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} half of the 19thcentury the {{population}} of London more than doubled, from a little under a million people in 1801 to almost two and a half million in 1851. The city's dead had been buried in and around the local churches. With a limited amount of space for burials, the oldest graves were regularly exhumed to free space for new burials. Despite the rapid growth in population, the amount of land set aside for use as graveyards remained unchanged at approximately 300acres (0.5sqmi; 1.2km2), spread across around 200 small sites. Even relatively fresh graves had to be exhumed to free up space for new burials, their contents being unearthed and scattered. Decaying corpses contaminated the water supply, and the city suffered regular epidemics of cholera, smallpox, measles and typhoid. A Royal Commission established in 1842 to investigate the problem concluded that London's burial grounds had become so overcrowded that it was impossible to <b>dig</b> <b>a</b> new grave without cutting through an existing one. In 1848–49 a cholera epidemic killed 14,601 people in London and overwhelmed the burial system completely.|$|E
5|$|Storm petrels {{normally}} nest in crevices between {{or under}} rocks, or burrow in the soil. When {{they make their}} own tunnels, they loosen the earth with their bills and kick out the debris with their feet. The birds less commonly nest in walls, under buildings or down rabbit burrows. Disused or occupied burrows of Atlantic puffins and Manx shearwaters are sometimes used, and the petrel pair may share a common entrance with those seabirds, rabbits or other pairs of its own species. Where other occupants are present, the petrels <b>dig</b> <b>a</b> side burrow or use an existing low-roofed tunnel which the larger birds or rabbits cannot easily enter. Even so, puffins and shearwaters will sometimes access and destroy nests, and adult petrels may be killed by their larger neighbours. Human-made plastic nesting tubes are readily used, and may provide protection against predators. Birds usually mate for life and use the same hole every year.|$|E

5|$|Teller {{was one of}} {{the strongest}} and best-known advocates for {{investigating}} non-military uses of nuclear explosives, which the United States explored under Operation Plowshare. One of the most controversial projects he proposed was a plan to use a multi-megaton hydrogen bomb to <b>dig</b> <b>a</b> deep-water harbor more than a mile long and half a mile wide to use for shipment of resources from coal and oil fields through Point Hope, Alaska. The Atomic Energy Commission accepted Teller's proposal in 1958 and it was designated Project Chariot. While the AEC was scouting out the Alaskan site, and having withdrawn the land from the public domain, Teller publicly advocated the economic benefits of the plan, but was unable to convince local government leaders that the plan was financially viable.|$|E
5|$|The Ustaše {{used the}} mysterious deaths {{of two of}} their local {{followers}} as a pretext for the killings. The victims were drawn from Gudovac and its surroundings on 28 April. Most were arrested under the guise that they were Serb rebels loyal to the ousted Yugoslav government. They were taken to a nearby field and collectively shot by a firing squad of up to 70 Ustaše guards. Five of the prisoners managed to survive the initial volley and crawled away to safety. The Ustaše forced Gudovac's surviving inhabitants to <b>dig</b> <b>a</b> mass grave for the victims and pour quicklime on the bodies to speed up decomposition. The following day, relatives {{of one of the}} victims informed the Germans of what had transpired. The Germans ordered a partial exhumation of the mass grave, and had 40 suspected perpetrators arrested. Mladen Lorković, a senior Ustaše official, used his influence to have the detained men released and promised German ambassador Siegfried Kasche that the Croatian authorities would carry out a thorough investigation. No investigation took place.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of the site was first {{brought to the attention}} of Professor Richard Daugherty in 1952 by a rancher named John McGregor. Excavations at the site were started by Daugherty and Roald Fryxell, a geologist, under the auspices of Washington State University (WSU)and the National Park Service in 1962, and continued until 1964. In 1965, Fryxell returned to the site along with Professor Carl Gustafson and students from WSU, and had Roland Marmes <b>dig</b> <b>a</b> trench in front of the rockshelter with his bulldozer, which turned up human and elk bones. Radiocarbon dating indicated that the human remains were about 10,000 years old. In 1968, Fryxell returned, this time with several WSU professors (including a visiting professor from Poland) and members of the United States Geological Survey, and found more human and animal remains, along with bone tools. April 29 of that year, Washington Senator Warren Magnuson made a public announcement of the finds.|$|E
