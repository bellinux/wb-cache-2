40|$|A {{simple and}} rapid method for {{specific}} identification of beef or bovine-derived products in processed food and in animal <b>feed</b> <b>concentrates</b> {{was developed and}} evaluated using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). The mitochondrial cytochrome-b (mtcyt-b) gene {{was used as a}} target DNA for PCR amplification. Three primers derived from a highly conserved region of bovine mtcyt-b gene were used. The outer pair of primers (RSL 1 and CSR 2) produced a 365 base pair (bp) PCR ampilicon from bovine DNA, while the internal semi-nested pair of primers (CSL 1 and CSR 2) were used to amplify a 284 bp PCR ampilicon, internal to the annealing sites of primers (RSL 1 and CSR 2). Both ampilicons were identified easily after visualization on agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. The specificity studies indicated that the primary or the semi-nested PCR products were not amplified from DNA extracted from different ruminant species including, sheep, goat and ghazals; or from non-ruminant animals including camels, horses and pigs.

50|$|Thiamine {{availability}} {{is controlled}} by the direct dietary consumption of thiamine. Thiamine availability is also regulated by thiaminases, which are enzymes that readily cleave thiamine molecules and inhibit essential thiamine-regulated pathways such as the metabolism of glucose. Ruminants have working rumen microbes that synthetize thiamine molecules for the body; therefore ruminants do not need to ingest thiamine rich foods for thiamine. However, feed concentrates given to ruminants, specifically sheep and cattle, are often heavily stocked with thiaminases. The presence of thiaminases counter the production of thiamine by breaking them down, resulting in a futile cycle between rumen microbes and thiaminases. Eventually, when the rate of synthesis production can not exceed thiaminase intake, a state of thiamine deficiency will be reached. Thiaminase rich foods include different grains, fresh water fish, and ferns, all of which are often processed together to make <b>feed</b> <b>concentrate.</b>|$|E

Design/methodology/approach: After acceptance of the soybean meal the analysis for the protein and moisturecontend is made by the use of Inframatic. The average monthly sample is sent to an external laboratory for testingfor GMO content. According to the regulations the GMO content must not exceed 0, 9 % and is determined by thePCR (polymeraze chain reaction) method. The soybean meal is processed into the <b>feed</b> <b>concentrate</b> by the use ofhammer mill, feed mixer and pellet mill. Ten analyses for GMO content have been performed by establishing theinfluence of the origin on the GMO content; the average percentage of GMO in the soybean meal was 0. 3 %. Findings: In two cases the results of analyses of the soybean meal were negative, which means that the soybeanmeal did not contain any GMO; in eight cases the test was positive, but none of them exceeded the sill of 0. 9 %. Irrespective of the supplier or origin the average percentage of the GMO in soybean meal is approximatelyidentical, i. e., 0. 3 %. Only the soybean meal, arriving from Brazil, has a smaller percentage of the GMO, i. e., 0. 22 %.

40|$|Conservation {{agriculture}} (CA) {{has been}} promoted as a strategy to cope with deterioration in soil fertility, but its adoption on smallholder farms in tropical areas remains limited. In Madagascar, livestock production is facing shortages in forage especially during the dry season. The value of cover crops used in CA as livestock feed could be an incentive to make this form of agriculture more acceptable in rural areas. To do so, farmers must find a trade-off {{between the use of}} biomass from cover crops for animal production and its maintenance on the soil to meet CA's criteria. In this study, we evaluated the impact of biomass flows (cover crops and manure) between cropping and cattle production in crop-livestock farms in the Lake Alaotra region. Surveys among crop-livestock farmers were used to calculate <b>feed</b> <b>concentrate</b> and mineral fertilizer equivalents. Our results show that on average 42, 22 and 10 % of biomass production (dry matter basis) of Brachiaria spp., Stylosanthes guianensis and Vicia villosa, respectively, are used for livestock feeding.

Variables measured were daily weight gain, feed efficiency, sexual performance, and semen production. Semen was collected twice a week for 8 weeks. The results showed that <b>feeding</b> <b>concentrate</b> either containing local fish meal (treatment B) or imported fish meal (treatment C) gave no significantly different effect on daily weight gain, feed efficiency, sexual performance, and semen production. However both treatments gave better effect on the variables than those <b>feeding</b> <b>concentrate</b> containing soy bean meal and urea (treatment A). Based on these results, it could be concluded that quality of local fish meal was {{not significantly different from}} imported ones. Thus, {{it can be used to}} argue the perception of fish meal consumers that quality of local fish meal is lower than imported ones.

50|$|The {{composition}} of the diet, especially the amount of protein provided, {{is also an important}} factor regulating animal growth. Ruminants, which may digest cellulose, are better adapted to poor-quality diets, but their ruminal microorganisms degrade high-quality protein if supplied in excess. Because producing high-quality protein animal feed is expensive (see also Environmental impact below), several techniques are employed or experimented with to ensure maximum utilization of protein. These include the treatment of feed with formalin to protect amino acids during their passage through the rumen, the recycling of manure by feeding it back to cattle mixed with <b>feed</b> <b>concentrates,</b> or the partial conversion of petroleum hydrocarbons to protein through microbial action.|$|R
40|$|Short-chain {{fatty acids}} (SCFAs) and lactate are endproducts of rumen {{fermentation}} and important energy {{sources for the}} host ruminant. Because their rapid accumulation results in ruminal acidosis, enhancement of the absorption of SCFA and lactate across reticuloruminal wall is instrumental in increasing energy supply and preventing ruminal acidosis in cattle. This study investigated whether the reticuloruminal absorption of SCFAs and lactate was altered by different strategies of high <b>concentrate</b> <b>feeding.</b> Eight rumen-cannulated, non-lactating Holstein cows were fed a forage-only diet (baseline) and then gradually adapted over 6 d to a 60 % concentrate level. Thereafter, this concentrate-rich diet was fed for 4 wk either continuously (Con; n = 8) or interruptedly (Int; n = 8). Absorption of SCFAs and lactate was determined in vivo from the experimental buffer introduced into the washed reticulorumen. The buffer contained acetate, propionate, butyrate and lactate at a concentration of 60, 30, 10 and 5 mmol/L, respectively and Cr-EDTA as a marker for correcting ruminal water fluxes. The reticuloruminal absorption after 35 and 65 min of buffer incubation was measured at the baseline, after 1 wk of 60 % <b>concentrate</b> <b>feeding</b> in the interrupted model (Int- 1) and after 4 wk of <b>concentrate</b> <b>feeding</b> in both feeding models (Int- 4 and Con- 4). Data showed that the absorption rates of individual and total SCFAs during the first 35 min of incubation of Con- 4 were highest (~ 1. 7 times compared to baseline), while Int- 1 and Int- 4 were similar to respective baseline. Lactate was not absorbed during forage-only baseline and 1 -wk <b>concentrate</b> <b>feeding,</b> but after 4 -wk <b>feeding</b> of <b>concentrates</b> in both models. In conclusion, SCFAs absorption across the reticulorumen of non-lactating cattle was enhanced by the 4 -wk continuous <b>concentrate</b> <b>feeding,</b> {{which seems to be}} more advantageous in terms of rumen acidosis prevention compared to the interrupted feeding model. The study provides evidence of lactate absorption across the reticulorumen of non-lactating cattle after both continuous and interrupted 4 -wk <b>concentrate</b> <b>feeding...</b>|$|R
