25|$|A {{science and}} {{mathematics}} graduate from the University of Western Australia, Jack Rutherford was a right-handed opening batsman, inclined to be defensive, and an occasional leg-break bowler who played for Western Australia from the 1952–53 season. Until 1956–57, Western Australia played the other Sheffield Shield state cricket teams only once a season, so Rutherford's record of five first-class centuries in his first four seasons was notable enough to win him selection for the 1956 Australian tour to England. In a damp summer, though, {{he was not a}} success, scoring only 640 runs at an average of fewer than 23 runs per innings. Only fleetingly, early in the tour, <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>look</b> likely to break into the Test team: against MCC at Lord's, he scored a dour 98 and shared a second wicket partnership of 282 with Neil Harvey, who scored 225. But when the team was announced for the first Test, the Australians reverted to the first-choice opening pair of Colin McDonald and Jim Burke.|$|E
500|$|In 2003, Nesbitt played {{undercover}} {{police detective}} Tommy Murphy {{in the first}} series of Murphy's Law, after starring in a successful pilot episode in 2001. The series was conceived when Nesbitt was working on Playing the Field; he and producer Greg Brenman approached author Colin Bateman about creating a television series for Nesbitt {{in a similar vein}} to Bateman's Dan Starkey novels. Bateman and Nesbitt were already well acquainted; Nesbitt had been considered for a main role in Divorcing Jack (David Caffrey, 1998), based on Bateman's original novel. A 90-minute pilot of Murphy's Law was commissioned by the BBC, initially as a [...] "comedy action adventure". Bateman created a complex backstory for Murphy, which was cut {{at the request of the}} producers. After the broadcast of the pilot, Guardian critic Gareth McLean wrote, [...] "the likeable James Nesbitt turned in a strong, extremely watchable central performance, though rarely <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>look</b> taxed by his efforts, and his chemistry with [...] Harrison was promising and occasionally electric." [...] In 2003, Nesbitt won the Irish Film & Television Award (IFTA) for Best Actor in a TV Drama for the role. The second series was broadcast in 2004.|$|E
2500|$|Ahmed Shah I {{laid the}} {{foundation}} of Bhadra Fort starting from Manek Burj, the first bastion {{of the city in}} 1411 which was completed in 1413. He also established the first square of the city, Manek Chowk, both associated with the legend of Hindu saint Maneknath. Square in form, enclosing an area of about forty-three acres, and containing 162 houses, the Bhadra fort had eight gates, three large, two in the east and one in the south-west corner; three middle-sized, two in the north and one in the south; and two small, in the west. The construction of Jama Masjid, Ahmedabad completed in 1423. As the city expanded, the city wall was expanded. Ahmed Shah I died in 1443 and was succeeded by his eldest son Muizz-ud-Din Muhammad Shah (Muhammad Shah I) who expanded the kingdom to Idar and Dungarpur. He died in 1451 and was succeeded by his son Qutbuddin Ahmad Shah II who ruled for short span of seven years. After the death of Qutbuddin Ahmad Shah II in 1458, the nobles raised his uncle Daud Khan to the throne. But within a short period of seven or twenty-seven days the nobles deposed him and set on the throne Fath Khan, son of Muhammad Shah II. Fath Khan, on his accession, adopted the title Abu-al Fath Mahmud Shah but he was popularly known as Mahmud Begada. He received the sobriquet Begada , which literally means conqueror of two forts, probably after conquering Girnar and Champaner forts. So the second fortification was carried out by Mahmud Begada in 1486, the grandson of Ahmed Shah, with an outer wall 10km (6.2mi) in circumference and consisting of 12 gates, 189 bastions and over 6,000 battlements as described in Mirat-i-Ahmadi. He planted its streets with trees, adorned the city and suburbs with splendid buildings, and with much care fostered its traders and craftsmen. [...] Though Champaner became capital of the sultanate in 1484, Ahmedabad was still greater, very rich and well supplied with many orchards and gardens, walled, and embellished with good streets, squares, and houses. So closely <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>look</b> after its welfare that if he heard of an empty house or shop he ordered it to be filled. In 1509, Ahmedabad trade started to affected by entry of Portuguese. Mahmud died on 23 November 1511.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Howel complied, {{and when}} <b>he</b> had <b>done,</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> expectingly at the lady.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't {{know but}} they might,' he replied, wiping the {{moisture}} from his white face. 'People say such things. How <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>look</b> now?' ...|$|R
60|$|And perplexed enough <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>look</b> at {{the sight}} of his {{prostrate}} file of patients, plunged, apparently, in such unaccountable slumbers.|$|E
6000|$|... "Er--Will--held Duncan pretty tight--didn't you? He's a {{hard one}} to fool, too. Never {{suspected}} a mite, <b>did</b> <b>he?</b> <b>Look</b> out for your watch!" ...|$|E
60|$|Why <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>look</b> so melancholy? {{the ladies}} asked {{of one another}} when they withdrew. In after days they remembered his pale face.|$|E
6000|$|... "But where shall I find God?" [...] insisted Tarzan. [...] "You {{are very}} old; {{if there is}} a God you must have seen Him. What <b>does</b> <b>He</b> <b>look</b> like? Where <b>does</b> <b>He</b> live?" ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>Does</b> <b>he</b> <b>look</b> for a companion? [...] No, no, don't think it. [...] He doesn't {{know he is}} alone; [...] Isolation is his birthright, [...] This atom.|$|R

60|$|When he had {{finished}} reading, Chauvelin quietly folded the paper up again, and then only <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>look</b> at {{the man and the}} woman before him.|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear, you {{interest}} me indescribably. Do you suppose {{he was in}} our rank of life? I mean, of course, <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>look</b> like a gentleman?" ...|$|E
6000|$|I:3:9 [...] SOL. [...] Thus <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>look,</b> thus speak, [...] When to {{my heart}} he clung, and I to him [...] Breathed my first love--and last.|$|E
6000|$|... 'He married! The Lord so 's, {{what shall}} we hear next? <b>Do</b> <b>he</b> <b>look</b> married now? His are not the abashed eyes and lips of a married man.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All night I waited!" [...] he cried. [...] "I {{could not}} sit still. I could {{scarcely}} breathe. Tell {{me what he}} is like, Julia? Tell me what <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> like? Is <b>he</b> strong? <b>Does</b> <b>he</b> <b>look</b> strong enough for the work?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I can't stand {{much more}} of this," [...] {{exploded}} Flambeau. [...] "Who is this fellow? What <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>look</b> like? What is the usual get-up of a mentally invisible man?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Why <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>look</b> so {{into her}} eyes? Why {{did he not}} speak to her? Could it be that he looked for her {{to make the first}} sign? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} he will be ill? <b>Did</b> <b>he</b> <b>look</b> so?" [...] And as Jean spoke, a thrill of fear passed over her, lest death should rob her of her prize.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is so {{like a man}} and {{so unlike}} a woman. What did he say? What did he do? How <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>look?</b> What did you say? What did you do? How did you look?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh! I am so happy, and so thankful. My sweet bairn! Where did {{you find}} him? How did you rescue him? I felt sure you would do it. How <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>look</b> when he saw you? and--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Thank you,' said Elizabeth, {{her eyes}} beaming with pleasure; 'I {{am sure that}} was very kind of you. And how <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>look,</b> poor little fellow, {{and what did he}} say, and was not he delighted to see you?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That nasty old North River?" [...] objected Hetty. [...] "It smells {{to me like}} soap {{factories}} and wet setter-dogs--oh, you mean the stew. Well, I wish we had an onion for it. <b>Did</b> <b>he</b> <b>look</b> like he had money?" ...|$|E

60|$|Taken aback, Tyler {{hesitated for}} a second, whilst Crispin waited with hand outstretched. Vainly <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>look</b> round for sign or word of help or counsel. None was afforded him by his fellow-revellers, who one and all hung back in silence.|$|E
6000|$|Women who had waited, and got {{patient at}} last {{after years of}} waiting, could not endure these {{additional}} few hours. Despair was endurable, but suspense! [...] "Ah, God! Was their man alive? What <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>look</b> like? Had he aged much?" ...|$|E
