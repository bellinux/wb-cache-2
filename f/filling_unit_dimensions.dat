CSE blocks are manufactured with different <b>unit</b> <b>dimensions.</b> This research is focused on determination of effect of <b>unit</b> <b>dimensions</b> of CSE blocks on masonry construction. <b>Unit</b> <b>dimensions</b> basically affect on the compressive strength and cost of construction of masonry. Ratio of height to least horizontal dimension (H/W) is a governing factor of compressive strength.

Four different sizes of blocks with H/W ratio of less than 0. 6 were used for the test. Relationships between Characteristic compressive strength of masonry, unit strength, and H/W ratio and load deformation characteristics were developed. Studies were done to determine the cost of construction of each panel. Results show that strengths of all panels are adequate for load bearing construction. Wall strengths increases with the H/W ratio. Panels provide a sufficient warning before ultimate failure.

40|$|This work {{examines}} dynamic cluster {{assignment for}} a clustered trace cache processor (CTCP). Previously pro-posed cluster assignment techniques run into unique prob-lems as issue width and cluster count increase. Realistic design conditions, such as variable data forwarding laten-cies between clusters and a heavily partitioned instruction window, increase {{the degree of}} difficulty for effective cluster assignment. In this work, the trace cache and <b>fill</b> <b>unit</b> are used to per-form dynamic cluster assignment. The retire-time <b>fill</b> <b>unit</b> analysis is aided by a dynamic profiling mechanism em-bedded within the trace cache. This mechanism provides information about inter-trace data dependencies, an ele-ment absent in previous retire-time CTCP cluster assign-ment work. The strategy proposed in this work leads to more intra-cluster data forwarding and shorter data forwarding distances. In addition, performing cluster assignment at re-tire time reduces issue-time complexity and eliminates early pipeline stages. This increases overall performance for in-teger programs by 11. 5 % over our base CTCP architecture. This speedup is significantly higher than a previously pro-posed retire-time CTCP assignment strategy. Dynamic clus-ter assignment is also evaluated for several alternate cluster designs {{as well as for}} media benchmarks. 1...|$|R

40|$|JPL {{collaborated with}} experts from {{industry}} {{and other organizations}} to develop a conceptual model of quantities, <b>units,</b> <b>dimensions,</b> and values based on the current work of the ISO 80000 committee revising the International System of Units & Quantities based on the International Vocabulary of Metrology (VIM). By providing support for ISO 80000 in SysML via the International Vocabulary of Metrology (VIM), this conceptual model provides, for the first time, a standard-based approach for addressing issues of unit coherence and dimensional analysis into the practice of systems engineering with SysML-based tools. This conceptual model provides support for two kinds of analyses specified in the International Vocabulary of Metrology (VIM) : coherence of units {{as well as of}} systems of <b>units,</b> and <b>dimension</b> analysis of systems of quantities. To provide a solid and stable foundation, the model for defining quantities, <b>units,</b> <b>dimensions,</b> and values in SysML is explicitly based on the concepts defined in VIM.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a knowledge-based approach {{to represent the}} <b>dimension</b> <b>units</b> of numerical values in CAD data models. Although numerical quantities are associated with <b>dimension</b> <b>units</b> in typical engineering data, these units are missing in most product data models. Some extended data models allow to store information about <b>dimension</b> <b>units,</b> but this information {{is limited to a}} fixed and predefined number of units. The presented approach helps to model parts of the semantics of product data by extending numerical values to semantic entities that can be converted automatically. Further, the evaluation of simple units (e. g. mm und cm) or more complex units (e. g. N=kg*m/s 2) in arithmetical operations (e. g. addition, multiplication or division) is described. The approach works on any set of units with any complexity. Users are able to define new units by so-called reduce and substitute rules. In order to evaluate <b>dimension</b> <b>units</b> in arithmetical operations, all units are converted first into a standard form, using the defined reduce and substitute rules. Next, the <b>dimension</b> <b>unit</b> of the complete operation is calculated by reducing fractions, combining units, calculating numerical values, and converting the result of the complete operation into the desired unit. This paper also describes an implementation of the presented approach that integrates the concept of representing and evaluating <b>dimension</b> <b>units</b> in a shared CAD database system...|$|R
