40|$|Although a “One Health” {{approach}} has been successfully implemented for emerging infectious zoonotic diseases with pandemic potential, we still lack a conceptual framework to address <b>enzootic</b> <b>diseases</b> like brucellosis. The vast majority of published brucellosis studies {{in the developing world}} rely solely on serology. An important shortcoming of brucellosis serology is the impossibility to infer which (smooth) Brucella spp. induced antibodies in the host. In this respect, mixed farming and especially raising small ruminants along with cattle, a common practice in the developing world, is reported to be a risk factor and a central question that has to be answered is whether cattle are infected with B. melitensis or with B. abortus or with both Brucella species. Therefore the isolation, identification and molecular characterization of Brucella spp. in human and the different livestock species needs to be undertaken to define a sound conceptual framework, identify the source of infection and plan appropriate control measures.

40|$|Shell {{disease in}} Crustacea {{is a widely}} {{recognized}} syndrome having a polymicrobial etiology, and manifesting itself as lesions of the shell with a variable structure and shell location. We characterized major members of bacterial communities in epizootic shell disease lesions of the American lobster (Homarus americanus, Milne Edwards) and compared these communities with the ones found in study cases of impoundment and <b>enzootic</b> shell <b>disease.</b> Bacteria belonging to several Flavobacteriaceae genera (Aquimarina, Tenacibaculum, Polaribacter, Maribacter, Cellulophaga) within the phylum Bacteroidetes appear to have particular attraction to lobster lesions. The most prominent Bacteroidetes in lobster lesions were representatives of the genus Aquimarina sp., but only Aquimarina ‘homaria’ was detected in all analyzed lesions of epizootic, impoundment, and <b>enzootic</b> shell <b>disease.</b> It was found on 45 % of surfaces unaffected by shell disease, but in smaller numbers compared with lesions. Alphaproteobacteria represent the most diverse class of proteobacteria found in both lesions and on unaffected surfaces. Three bacteria of this class appear to be ubiquitous in shell disease lesions, but only one specific alphaproteobacterium tentatively assigned to the genus Thalassobius (herein designated as ‘Thalassobius’ sp.) was present in all analyzed lesions of epizootic, impoundment, and <b>enzootic</b> shell <b>disease.</b> A ubiquitous gammaproteobacterium called ‘Candidatus Homarophilus dermatus’ was also prevalent in lesions, but just as commonly it was associated with surfaces unaffected by shell disease. The bacteria A. ‘homaria’ and ‘Thalassobius’ sp. are dominant and appear obligatory in lobster shell lesions, and are only occasionally detected on unaffected surfaces, which serve as intermediate reservoirs for the two potential pathogens.

Importantly, this bacterium {{can be transferred}} to humans through contact with nasal secretions or bites from infected animals. Few virulence factors have been identified and characterized for their role in P. multocida virulence. The multidomain, filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) -like protein, PfhB 2, is implicated in virulence, but its activity is unknown. The FHA and Fic domains {{have been shown to}} provide protective immunity in turkeys and to adenylylate Rho GTPases in vitro, respectively. In contrast, the YopT-like domain of PfhB 2 has not been examined. Here, we show that the PfhB 2 YopT domain does not display cysteine protease activity against mammalian Rho GTPases in vitro, unlike its close homolog from Yersinia. Instead, PfhB 2 YopT behaves more like its homolog from Histophilus somni, IbpA, and does not induce cytotoxicity of mammalian cells. Further, PfhB 2 YopT does not display protease activity against a general protease substrate, FITC-labeled casein. Thus, the activity of PfhB 2 YopT is likely toward a specific substrate, possibly of bacterial origin. It remains to be determined whether PfhB 2 YopT functions in its own autoproteolysis, similar to what has been reported for another YopT family homolog, AvrPphB from Pseudomonas syringae. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{profound}} changes in breeding and rearing systems {{along with the}} intensification of tropical aquaculture production, especially in South-East Asia, tend to increase the occurrence of epizooties and <b>enzootic</b> <b>diseases,</b> of which the socio-economic and environmental impacts amount to {{hundreds of millions of}} US $ per year. Because of the variety of cultured species and culture environments, diseases are numerous and their natures are generally multi-factorial, thus complicating health management. Until now, Asian fish-culturists have explored exclusively or essentially the chemotherapeutic register, which is known to result in the accumulation of residues in the environment and/or fish flesh, and to promote antibiotic resistance, including through the transfer of resistance between bacterial species. Alternatives to this chemical strategy are urgently needed to secure the health management of cultured fish, in particular in the field of epidemiology and ecopathology. Ecopathology is a branch of analytical epidemiology that explores and analyzes the different variables of an animal production system in order to individualize the risk factors responsible for creating the setting of a pathogen or disease breakthrough. This holistic approach, which regards pathology as one of the outcomes of a productive system, is very rarely used in aquaculture. This article provides a synthesis on the health issues of fish breeding systems in the tropics, with emphasis on South East Asia, and illustrates the benefits of an ecopathological strategy that was deployed to elucidate then alleviate the mortality of Pangasius spp. reared in floating cages in the Mekong River, Vietnam...|$|R

40|$|The main {{characteristic}} of swine herds {{in the territory}} of the Republic of Serbia is an unsatisfactory health status accompanied by increased incidence of contagious parasitic, genetic and other disorders. All this is a consequence of long-term unfavorable production conditions (maintenance of animals, diet, treatment, prevention, etc), which to a large extent altered the course and outcome of the mentioned diseases, and which had direct impact on the parameters which determine the health status of animals in a population. The health status of swine populations in our country are mostly determined by the presence of swine plague, but also diseases of pluricausal character, such as coli in fections, actinobđcillosis, atrophic rhinitis dysentery, and others. One must also not forget the presence of diseases which can be maintained in herds for a long time as <b>enzootic</b> <b>diseases</b> (Aujeszkyi, leptospirosis, tuberculosis, etc). Among parasitic diseases trichinellosis deserves special attention since it endangers the health of humans more and more every day. Most of the mentioned diseases are exhibited in very different clinical forms, so that their timely detection is very difficult and their control complex. That is why swine production in our country is characterized by a low percentage of fertilization, small number of live and large number of still-born piglets, and a high level of mortality in all categories. A logical consequence of this is a small number of produced porkers per sow, mostly of poor quality. In conditions where there are many diseases of different etiology, their control is complex and consequences always connected to a reduction or complete annulment of the expected benefits from an animal of high genetic potential veterinary-medical protection must cede its place to health protection as a technology which is based on a policy of disease prevention. This implies the establishment and maintenance of a high health status in swine herds with a clear definition of special criteria for elite, reproductive and production herds. The mentioned concept requires a well-prepared, organized and equipped veterinary service, in which relations are adequately coordinated and tasks are well distributed among experts on farms, in specialized institutions, faculties, and inspection services...|$|R

Forty of these viruses were obtained from Central America during 1982 to 1985. The other three were older isolates, including a 1970 isolate from Culex nigripalpus mosquitos in Guatemala, a 1960 bovine isolate from Panama, and a 1976 isolate from mosquitos (Mansonia indubitans) in Ecuador. The data indicate that extensive genetic diversity exists among virus isolates from this predominantly <b>enzootic</b> <b>disease</b> zone. Six distinct T 1 fingerprint groups were identified for the Central American VSV NJ isolates from 1982 to 1985. The 1960 VSV NJ isolate from Panama and the 1976 isolate from Ecuador formed two additional distinct fingerprint groups. This finding is {{in sharp contrast to}} the relatively close genetic relationship existing among VSV NJ isolates obtained from predominantly epizootic disease areas of the United States and Mexico during the same period (S. T. Nichol, J. Virol. 61 : 1029 - 1036, 1987). In this previous study, RNA genome T 1 fingerprint differences were observed among isolates from different epizootics; however, the isolates were all clearly members of one large T 1 fingerprint group. The eight T 1 fingerprint groups described here for Central American and Ecuadorian viruses are distinct from those characterized earlier for virus isolates from the United States and Mexico and for the common laboratory virus strains Ogden and Hazelhurst. Despite being isolated 14 years earlier, the 1970 insect isolate from Guatemala is clearly a member of one of the 1982 to 1985 Central American virus fingerprint groups. This indicates that although virus genetic diversity in the region is extensive, under certain natural conditions particular virus genotypes can be relatively stably maintained for an extended period. The implications of these findings for the evolution of VSV NJ and epizootiology of the disease are discussed...|$|E

40|$|A major {{obstacle}} to anticipating the cross-species transmission of zoonotic diseases and developing novel strategies for their control is the scarcity of data informing how these pathogens circulate within natural reservoir populations. Vampire bats are the primary reservoir of rabies in Latin America, where the disease remains {{among the most important}} viral zoonoses affecting humans and livestock. Unpredictable spatiotemporal dynamics of rabies within bat populations have precluded anticipation of outbreaks and undermined widespread bat culling programs. By analysing 1146 vampire bat-transmitted rabies (VBR) outbreaks in livestock across 12 years in Peru, we demonstrate that viral expansions into historically uninfected zones have doubled the recent burden of VBR. Viral expansions are geographically widespread, but severely constrained by high elevation peaks in the Andes mountains. Within Andean valleys, invasions form wavefronts that are advancing towards large, unvaccinated livestock populations that are heavily bitten by bats, which together will fuel high transmission and mortality. Using spatial models, we forecast the pathways of ongoing VBR epizootics across heterogeneous landscapes. These results directly inform vaccination strategies to mitigate impending viral emergence, reveal VBR as an emerging rather than an <b>enzootic</b> <b>disease</b> and create opportunities to test novel interventions to manage viruses in bat reservoirs...|$|E

However, rabbit population trends in Spain have not been accurately documented. In the present study, we analysed trends in a population of European rabbits monitored over 23 years in the Doñana National Park, {{home to one of}} the most diverse and densest predator communities in Europe. Rabbit abundance and population trends were estimated using roadside counts. Results show that the rabbit population declined sharply by ∼ 60 % during the first wave of epizootic rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHD) in 1990. Since then, rabbit numbers have declined at a relatively constant rate and the species has become progressively scarcer in the area. The current population is less than 10 % of that before the arrival of RHD. However, after the RHD epizootic we observed increasing intra-annual population recruitment. We hypothesise that density-dependent factors caused by <b>enzootic</b> viral <b>diseases</b> (myxomatosis, RHD) and higher predation of rabbits are the main factors preventing recovery of rabbit numbers. The effects of a decline in the prey species on the ecology of sympatric rabbit predators are discussed, and measures to improve ongoing rabbit conservation efforts are suggested. © CSIRO 2007.

In this paper, for the context of veterinary epidemiology, we review the main proposals, precision, repeatability, reproducibility, and intermediate precision, in agreement with ISO (international Organization for Standardization) practice, generalize these by placing them within the linear mixed model framework, which we then extend to the generalized linear mixed model setting, so that both Gaussian as well as non-Gaussian data can be employed. Similarities and differences are discussed between the classical ANOVA (analysis of variance) approach and the proposed mixed model settings, on the one hand, and between the Gaussian and non-Gaussian cases, on the other hand. The new proposals are applied to five studies in three diseases: Aujeszky's <b>disease,</b> <b>enzootic</b> bovine leucosis (EBL) and bovine brucellosis. The mixed-models proposals are also discussed in the light of their computational requirements. accuracy, analysis of variance, Aujeszky's disease, bias, bovine brucellosis, enzootic bovine leucosis, generalized linear mixed models, linear mixed models, quality control,...|$|R
40|$|The {{diagnosis}} of tick-borne {{diseases such as}} babesiosis still depends on observing the parasite in the infected erythrocyte. Microscopic observation is tedious and often problematic in both early and carrier infections. Better diagnostic methods are needed to prevent clinical disease, especially when susceptible cattle are being moved into <b>disease</b> <b>enzootic</b> areas. This study evaluates two techniques for early {{diagnosis of}} Babesia bovis infections in cattle, DNA probes specific for the organism and fluorescent probes specific nucleic acid. The radioisotopically labeled DNA probes are used in slot blot hybridizations whith lysed blood samples, not purified DNA. Thusfar, the probe is specific for B. bovis and can detect as few as 1000 B. bovis parasites in 10 µl of blood. The specificity of the fluorescent probe depends on the characteristic morphology of the babesia in whole blood samples, as determined microscopically. The fluorescent probe detects as afew as 10, 000 B. bovis parasites in 10 *l as blood. The application of each method for alboratory and field use is discussed...|$|R
