5000|$|In {{database}} and information retrieval theory {{the distinction between}} concepts and relations and the classification of relations into different types was also developing at this time. The “relation operators” for example of J. Farradane published in papers dating back to 1966 included such notions as space/time factors, dimensional relations, causation (or functional dependence) and association. An attempt was made by Perry, Kent and Berry to break down subjects into semantic factors (reminiscent of earlier work by J.Kaiser (1915) and S. R. Ranganathan (1933) in their work on library classification systems) but was abandoned due to the immense complexity of relations involved even for the simplest subjects.The advent of computer technology was of revolutionary importance in allowing these general ideas to be taken forward. The earliest models in electronic database managements systems (DBMS), the hierarchical and network models, were superseded in 1970 when E.F.Codd proposed the “relational model” which was then developed and transformed into the database programming language SQL (Structured Query Language). Eugen Wüster, in what he called terminology science, also drew on the important distinction between concepts and relations and, borrowing ideas from David Hume (see above) regarding types of relation, set out his findings in his General Theory of Terminology (1974). Further work on Wüster’s concept systems and concept relations was published in 1994 by Anita Nuopponen [...] and taken up {{in the preparation of}} ISO 12620 <b>Data</b> <b>Categories</b> and in the further development of <b>data</b> <b>categories</b> in 1999 by researchers at Brigham Young and Kent Universities in the USA.

A PC-based application, built in PC-FOCUS, was fielded for beta testing in late 1988 within the 63rd Army Reserve Command and was expanded USAR-wide the following year.

50|$|In the {{normalized}} approach, {{the data}} in the data warehouse are stored following, to a degree, database normalization rules. Tables are grouped together by subject areas that reflect general <b>data</b> <b>categories</b> (e.g., data on customers, products, finance, etc.). The normalized structure divides data into entities, which creates several tables in a relational database. When applied in large enterprises the result is dozens of tables that are linked together by a web of joins. Furthermore, each of the created entities is converted into separate physical tables when the database is implemented (Kimball, Ralph 2008).The main advantage {{of this approach is}} that it is straightforward to add information into the database. Some disadvantages of this approach are that, {{because of the number of}} tables involved, it can be difficult for users to join data from different sources into meaningful information and to access the information without a precise understanding of the sources of data and of the data structure of the data warehouse.|$|E
30|$|We {{propose a}} novel and general {{framework}} called the multithreading cascade of Speeded Up Robust Features (McSURF), which {{is capable of}} processing multiple classifications simultaneously and accurately. The proposed framework adopts SURF features, but the framework is a multi-class and simultaneous cascade, i.e., a multithreading cascade. McSURF is implemented by configuring an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of the weak SURF classifier for each <b>data</b> <b>category</b> into a real-value lookup list. These non-interfering lists are built into thread channels to train the boosting cascade for each <b>data</b> <b>category.</b> This boosting cascade-based approach can be trained to fit complex distributions and can simultaneously and robustly process multi-class events. The proposed method takes facial expression recognition as a test case and validates its use on three popular and representative public databases: the Extended Cohn-Kanade, MMI Facial Expression Database, and Annotated Facial Landmarks in the Wild database. Overall results show that this framework outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.|$|R
