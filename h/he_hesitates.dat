5|$|Raskolnikov is at {{this point}} {{completely}} torn; he is urged by Sonya to confess, and Svidrigaïlov's testimony could potentially convict him. Furthermore, Porfiry confronts Raskolnikov with his suspicions and assures him that confession would substantially lighten his sentence. Meanwhile, Svidrigaïlov attempts to seduce Dunya, but when he realizes that she will never love him, he lets her go. He then spends a night in confusion and in the morning shoots himself. This same morning, Raskolnikov goes again to Sonya, who again urges him to confess and to clear his conscience. He makes his way to the police station, where he is met by the news of Svidrigaïlov's suicide. <b>He</b> <b>hesitates</b> a moment, thinking again that he might get away with a perfect crime, but is persuaded by Sonya to confess.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Walt's wife Skyler (Anna Gunn) observes {{his car in}} her {{driveway}} and, not wishing her son Walter Jr. (RJ Mitte) to see it, drives it a {{few blocks}} away to conceal it. Concerned about Walt's apparent disappearance, she calls their lawyer Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk), but he has become paranoid from Walt's falling out with Gus and is too busy checking his office for listening devices. Skyler hires a locksmith to break into Walt's condo for her, claiming it belongs to her. When <b>he</b> <b>hesitates</b> to do so without identification, Skyler claims her purse was stolen and fakes a panic attack until he finally agrees. She finds little of interest inside the condo. Elsewhere, Skyler's sister Marie (Betsy Brandt) struggles to maintain her composure while caring for her belligerent husband Hank (Dean Norris), who is still bedridden after the attempt on his life.|$|E

25|$|The {{conflict}} {{reaches a}} climax when Miao Renfeng challenges Hu Fei to a duel thinking mistakenly that Hu has intentionally molested his daughter, Miao Ruolan. They fight for several rounds but neither emerges the victor. They are stranded on a cliff about to collapse under their weight when the novel ends. Hu Fei {{has an opportunity}} to attack Miao Renfeng and knock him off the cliff, but <b>he</b> <b>hesitates</b> because Miao might become his future father-in-law. However, if he does not attack, either they will fall to their deaths or Miao will kill him. The novel ends on a deliberate cliffhanger and leaves the conclusion to the reader's imagination.|$|E
25|$|The hrossa honour Ransom greatly {{by asking}} him to join them in a hunt for a hnakra (plural hnéraki), a fierce water-creature {{which seems to be}} the only {{dangerous}} predator on the planet, resembling both a shark and a crocodile. While hunting, Ransom and his hrossa companions are told by an eldil, an almost invisible creature reminiscent of a spirit or deva, that Ransom must go to meet Oyarsa, the eldil who is ruler of the planet—and indeed that he already should have done so. <b>He</b> <b>hesitates</b> to respond to the summons, as he wishes to proceed with the hunt. Hyoi, after killing the hnakra with Ransom's help, is shot dead by Devine and Weston, who are seeking Ransom in order to take him prisoner and hand him over to the séroni. Ransom is told by Hyoi's friend (another hross named Whin) that this is the consequence of disobeying Oyarsa, and that Ransom must now cross the mountains to escape Weston and Devine and fulfil his orders. On his journey, Ransom finally meets a sorn, as he long feared he might. He finds, however, that the séroni are peaceful and kindly. Augray (the sorn) explains to him the nature of Oyarsa's body, and that of all eldila. The next day, carrying the human on his shoulders, Augray takes Ransom to Oyarsa.|$|E

500|$|As {{the game}} itself opens with Maxwell snidely informing the player of their gaunt {{appearance}} and includes little further story, the game's setup is told through its trailer. On a dark and stormy night, Wilson appears to be getting nowhere in a chemistry experiment until he is startled by his radio speaking to him. It reveals that it has noticed his trouble and has [...] "secret knowledge" [...] for him. When he eagerly agrees, a flurry of equations and diagrams encircle him and fill his head with this information. Using white rats, a typewriter, and his own blood, among other tools and materials, Wilson creates a giant machine. The radio commends his work and tells him to pull the machine's switch. <b>He</b> <b>hesitates,</b> but at the radio's insistence, he does it; the machine rattles violently {{and a pair of}} ghostly arms whisk him into a different world while an apparition of Maxwell cackles.|$|E

"Having now {{mentioned}} the principal facts {{contained in the}} evidence offered to Parliament by the petitioners of Great Britain, in behalf of {{the abolition of the}} slave trade, we cannot close this compilation better than in the words of Mr Hercules Ross: he says, “finally, as the result of his observations and most serious reflection, <b>he</b> <b>hesitates</b> not to say, that the trade for slaves ought to be abolished, not only as contrary to sound policy, but to the laws of God and nature; and were it possible, by the present inquiry, to convey a just knowledge of the extensive misery it occasions, every Kingdom of Europe must unite in calling on their legislatures to abolish the human traffic…” ...|$|E

[...] <b>He</b> <b>hesitates</b> over various means of death, poison, a noose, etc. [...] He stabs himself with a saber; the blade goes in and out his sleeve. [...] Then he gets a gun, unhooks the mirror from the wall, sets it against the carafe, stands in a good {{position}} to see himself, his image appearing in the mirror. [...] The shot rings out and Pierrot falls, thinking himself dead. [...] When he comes to, he flees the theater of his crime, boards a boat, is taken with seasickness, shipwrecks {{in the middle of the}} most terrifying storm, swims to safety and collapses, exhausted, on a desert island.|$|E

2500|$|According to the Fu Zi, {{before the}} Battle of Guandu, Cao Cao wanted to attack Liu Bei (who had rebelled and {{seized control of}} Xu Province) first before dealing with Yuan Shao. However, some of Cao Cao's {{advisers}} expressed their worries that Yuan Shao would {{take advantage of their}} absence to attack them, rendering them trapped between Yuan and Liu Bei. Cao Cao faced a dilemma so he asked Guo Jia for his opinion. Guo Jia suggested, [...] "Yuan Shao is suspicious and <b>he</b> <b>hesitates</b> before he makes any decision, so he won't make his move fast. Liu Bei had just taken control of Xu Province so his situation isn't stable yet. He can be easily defeated if we attack him fast and hard. This is a critical opportunity, we mustn't lose it." [...] Cao Cao agreed and immediately led an army east to attack Liu Bei and defeated the latter. After his defeat, Liu Bei fled to Hebei to join Yuan Shao. Throughout that period of time, Yuan Shao did not make any move.|$|E
