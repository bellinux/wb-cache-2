40|$|Extensive {{networks}} of deep drains {{are being built}} in Western Australia to reduce the effects of dryland salinity on agricultural lands. Most of these drains discharge into natural river and wetland systems, with little consideration given to the environmental impacts. This study examined the downstream ecological impacts {{of one of the}} oldest deep drain networks in Western Australia, located in the Wakeman subcatchment near Narembeen. Twelve sites were sampled bi-monthly from October 2004 to September 2006. On each occasion, water quality parameters were measured and the macro-invertebrate fauna was sampled. Significant differences in water quality and macro-invertebrates were observed between the untreated sites and those affected by the <b>drain</b> <b>discharge.</b> Surface water at untreated sites was always fresh (< 3 ppt), alkaline (pH 7. 6 – 8. 9) and turbid (49 – 600 NTU), whereas treatment sites were always saline (28 – 147 ppt), acidic (pH 1. 9 – 3. 8) and mostly clear (0 – 100 NTU). No recovery of water quality was observed with distance from discharge point (20 km). Invertebrates reflected differences in water quality, with <b>drain</b> <b>discharge</b> resulting in a sharp decline in species richness, and significant changes in macro-invertebrate community composition. Sites affected by <b>drain</b> <b>discharge</b> were dominated by fly larvae such as Orthocladiinae and Ceratopogonidae. Microcrustaceans were far more abundant at sites unaffected by drainage.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{allowing the}} rapid release of stored water to streams are poorly understood. Here {{we use a}} tile drained field site to combine naturally structured soils at the hillslope scale with the advantage of at least partly controlled lower boundary conditions. We performed {{a series of three}} irrigation experiments combining hydrometric measurements with stable isotope and bromide tracers to better understand macropore-matrix interactions and stored water release processes at the hillslope scale. Stable isotope concentrations were monitored in the irrigation water, the tile <b>drain</b> <b>discharge</b> and the soil water before and after the experiment. Bromide was measured at mainly every 5 – 15 min in the tile drain hydrograph. Different initial conditions for each experiment were used to examine how pre-event soil moisture conditions influenced flow and transport. Different amounts of irrigation water were necessary to increase tile <b>drain</b> <b>discharge</b> above the base flow level. Hydrograph separation based on bromide data revealed that irrigation water contributions to peak tile <b>drain</b> <b>discharge</b> were on the order of 20 %. Oxygen- 18 and deuterium data were consistent with the bromide data and showed that pre-event soil water contributed significantly to the tile drain event flow. However, the isotopic composition of soil water converged towards the isotopic composition of irrigation water through the course of the experiment. Mixing calculations revealed {{that by the end of}} the irrigation experiments 20 % of the soil water in the entire profile was irrigation water.

A four-year study (2011 - 2015) was conducted to quantify the effects of subsurface drainage on the saturated hydraulic conductivity, water table, <b>drain</b> <b>discharge</b> and winter crop yields. Subsurface drainage systems with two drain depths of 0. 65 and 0. 90 m and two drain spacings of 15 and 30 m were installed at the consolidated paddy fields of Sari Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources University, Iran. During four successive winter seasons, the water table depth and <b>drain</b> <b>discharge</b> were measured daily. Soil saturated hydraulic conductivity was measured twice; before drainage system installation and four years following the installation. Canola grain yields were determined at harvest of each cultivation season. During the study period, the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity increased with the highest increase in the top 0 - 30 cm. The deeper drains were more effective in controlling the water table compared to the shallow, and the daily <b>drain</b> <b>discharge</b> of the deeper drains in the fourth year were {{higher than those of}} shallow drains. The canola grain yield of all drainage systems increased significantly by the seasons, and the largest difference in canola grain yield between first and fourth seasons was 2191 kg· ha - 1 (318 % increase) in the fields with 0. 90 m drain depth and 30 m drain spacing.

40|$|Natural {{prefabricated}} vertical drains (NPVDs) {{produced from}} biodegradable {{materials such as}} jute and coir have some distinct advantages over conventional polymeric prefabricated vertical drains (CPVDs). For instance, NPVDs are not only able to discharge excess pore pressure effectively but are also beneficial to the environment thanks to their biodegradability. However, due to the biodegradability of the natural fibres, NPVDs can sometimes deteriorate too quickly in an adverse environment such as in highly acidic clay, which hampers the dissipation of excess pore pressure. In this paper, an analytical solution for radial consolidation that considers the time-dependent decay of <b>drain</b> <b>discharge</b> capacity is therefore proposed. The solution is applied to an exponential form of reduction of the <b>drain</b> <b>discharge</b> capacity, and then verified with the experimental results obtained in previous studies. The effect of drain degradation on soil consolidation is simulated using a finite element method (ABAQUS) and these numerical results are then compared to those obtained from the analytical approach. In addition, a new and flexible method using a matching factor to convert the parameters from axisymmetric to plane strain models is introduced and applied to radial consolidation. The modelling outcomes indicate a significant retardation of excess pore pressure dissipation due to drain degradation and this suggests the need to exercise caution when using biodegradable NPVDs...|$|E
