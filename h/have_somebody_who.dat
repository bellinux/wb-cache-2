500|$|A billionaire socialite who dedicates {{himself to}} {{protecting}} Gotham City from its criminal underworld as a bat-masked vigilante who is hailed as its [...] "Dark Knight" [...] at night. Bale {{said he was}} confident in his choice to return in the role because of the positive response to his portrayal in Batman Begins. He continued training in the Keysi Fighting Method and performed many of his own stunts, but did not gain as much muscle {{as in the previous}} film because the new Batsuit allowed him to move with greater agility. Bale described Batman's dilemma as whether [...] " [...] something that has an end. Can he quit and have an ordinary life? The kind of manic intensity someone has to have to maintain the passion and the anger that they felt as a child, takes an effort after a while, to keep doing that. At some point, you have to exorcise your demons." [...] He added, [...] "Now you have not just a young man in pain attempting to find some kind of an answer, you <b>have</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> actually has power, who is burdened by that power, and is having to recognize the difference between attaining that power and holding on to it." [...] Bale felt Batman's personality had been strongly established in the first film, so it was unlikely his character would be overshadowed by the villains, stating: [...] "I have no problem with competing with someone else. And that's going to make a better movie." ...|$|E

Nation [...] "...thought {{it would be interesting to}} have a girl who was aggressive, to <b>have</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> would kill first and ask questions later, and it was nice to give what are generally masculine attitudes to a woman". Josette Simon was chosen to play Dayna; Simon had recently graduated from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and did not have an Equity card.|$|E

5000|$|Greene's first DC superhero {{work was}} inking Gil Kane on a backup Atom story in The Atom #8 (Sept. 1963). Along with Murphy Anderson, {{he became one}} of Kane's two regular inkers on that series, which {{generally}} featured two Atom stories each issue. Greene also soon became Kane's regular inker on Green Lantern, beginning with issue #29 (June 1964). As historian Daniel Herman wrote, [...] "Finally, Kane <b>had</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> could keep up with his frenetic pacing and full-bodied anatomy." ...|$|R
5000|$|Stromberg later {{claimed in}} an {{interview}} that he employed an [...] "age-old" [...] emotional storytelling for the film and called it [...] "the biggest thrill" [...] against all technology advances. [...] "And the way we play with that is we <b>have</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>who's</b> perhaps in love but betrayed and doesn't believe that true love exists. So the moral to it is we can all feel dark ourselves but not to lose hope because there is light in places where we might not be expecting", he explained.|$|R
2500|$|By September 1943, Disney {{assigned}} Dick Huemer and Joe Grant {{to begin}} work on Cinderella as story supervisors and given a preliminary budget of $1 million. However, by 1945, their preliminary story work was halted. During the writing stages of Song of the South, Dalton S. Reymond and Maurice Rapf entered into a personal dispute, in which Raft was reassigned to write for Cinderella. In his version, Cinderella was written to be a less passive character than Snow White, and more rebellious against her stepfamily. Raft explained, [...] "My thinking was you can't <b>have</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> comes in and changes everything for you. You can't be delivered it on a platter. You've got to earn it. So in my version, the Fairy Godmother said, 'It's okay till midnight but from then in it's up to you.' I made her earn it, and {{what she had to}} do achieve it was to rebel against her stepmother and stepsisters, to stop being a slave in her own home. So I had a scene where they're ordering her around and she throws the stuff back at them. She revolts, so they lock her up in the attic. I don't think anyone took (my idea) very seriously." ...|$|E

50|$|It's not rocket science. To win a {{campaign}} {{you have to}} get a lot of people engaged in supporting you.

There are relationships you build in Louisiana where people put aside their partisanship and see people for who they are and build those relationships. That's something that being in D.C.

60|$|He made a {{great show}} of living sociably with him, on the {{principle}} that the more friendly you are with a man the more easily you may catch him tripping; and also for the reason that he wanted to <b>have</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> would listen to his stories of manifestations, apparitions, ghosts, {{and all the rest of}} the imbecile spook-lore. He had it all at his fingers' ends; and he spun those ghostly yarns in a persistent, colourless voice, giving them a futile turn peculiarly his own.|$|E

You're a Nihilist or a Fenian or {{something}} of that sort, and you don't shoot anything but czars and grand dukes, do you? I believe you want to cut all our heads off and have a red republic. Well, I'm sure that's very refreshing; for down here we're all as dull as sticks together; Tories, every one of us to a man; perfect unanimity; no differences of opinion; all as conventional and proper as the vicar's sermons. Now, to <b>have</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> wants to cut your head off, in the house, is really delightful. I love originality. Not that I've ever seen anybody original in all my life, for I haven't, but I'm sure it would be delightful if I did. One reads about original people in novels, you know, Dickens and that sort of thing; and I often think I should like to meet some of them (good stroke again; legs, legs, legs, if you please--no, it hasn't legs enough); but here, or for the matter of that, in town either, we never see anybody but the same eternal round of Algies, and Monties, and Berties, and Hughs--all very nice young men, no doubt; exceedingly proper, nothing against them; good shots, capital partners, excellent families, everything on earth that anybody could desire, except a single atom of personal originality. I assure you, if they were all shaken up in a bag together and well mixed, in evening clothes (so as not to tell them apart by the tweeds, you know), their own mothers wouldn't be able to separate them afterwards. But if you don't shoot and don't play billiards, I'm sure I don't know what you'll ever find to do with yourself here at Dunbude.' ...|$|E
60|$|When {{she said}} this {{he had to take}} his leave. It was {{impossible}} that he should further press his case upon her, though he would have been very glad to extract from her some kindly word. It is such a help in a difficulty to <b>have</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> will express even a hope that the difficulty is perhaps not invincible! He had no one to comfort him in this matter. There was one dear friend,--as a friend dearer than any other,--to whom he might go, and who would after some fashion bid him prosper. Mabel would encourage him. She had said that she would do so. But in making that promise she had told him that Romeo would not have spoken of his love for Juliet to Rosaline, whom he had loved before he saw Juliet. No doubt she had gone on to tell him that he might come to her and talk freely of his love for Lady Mary,--but after what had been said before, he felt that he could not do so without leaving a sting behind. When a man's love goes well with him,--so well as to be in some degree oppressive to him even by its prosperity,--when the young lady has jumped into his arms and the father and mother have been quite willing, then he wants no confidant. He does not care to speak very much of the matter which among his friends is apt to become a subject for raillery. When you call a man Benedick he does not come to you with ecstatic descriptions of the beauty and the wit of his Beatrice. But no one was likely to call him Benedick in reference to Lady Mary.|$|E

So I wouldn't say my children were an inspiration in the sense of what I thought would have been a spiritual inspiration before I had children. More so I think meeting the challenges of motherhood with what I had learned made my practice very rich.|$|R
