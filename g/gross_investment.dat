Unlike depreciation in business accounting, CFC in {{national accounts}} is, in principle, not a method of allocating the costs of past expenditures on fixed assets over subsequent accounting periods.

Overall growth in agriculture continued to fall after {{the creation of the}} APKs. Also, the goal of freeing farm workers to take industrial jobs was not reached. On the contrary, the annual reduction in agricultural employment dropped from 4 to 2 percent while farm labor productivity declined. As a result, agriculture's share of <b>gross</b> <b>investment</b> in fixed capital fell to 18 percent by 1976, a level last seen in the mid-1950s. In 1978, this failure triggered a new policy emphasizing smaller complexes.

We first develop a simple theoretical model to motivate the analysis. The empirical analysis shows that debt as a whole may {{have a negative impact}} on the choice of output and investment levels of the firms. However, the short-term debts make firms behave in a conservative fashion while the long-term debts make firms behave more aggressively in this respect. Debt, irrespective of its structure, forces the firms to upgrade their technology.
