5|$|Whoever {{looks in}} the past and thinks about the time of 1919 to 1932 will be {{overpowered}} by great pain {{in the face of the}} mistakes that have been made. When Hitler published his book Mein Kampf, it was time to begin the most stringent battle against the theories proposed in that book. Hitler proposed to do away with all present parties and institutions, even those brought about after centuries of sacrifices and great exertion. What would a man do if a thief announced a proposed break-in? Anybody would make security arrangements. And what did the government and the representatives of the people <b>do?</b> <b>As</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> nothing. A tired, weak and sick population, as well as a weak government, let a charlatan of the worst sort promise them healing. For every problem this quack had the only right medicine. He alone possessed the magic wand that would uproot human weakness and produce angels.|$|E

Bokova {{declared}} that media outlets {{should not be the}} target of military activities. On 11 August, after the NATO airstrike on Majer (on 9 August) that allegedly killed 85 civilians, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called on all sides to <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> possible to avoid killing innocent people.|$|E
500|$|... is a manga series {{written and}} drawn by Nobuhiro Watsuki. It follows Kazuki Muto, who becomes an alchemical warrior {{in the battle}} against alchemical monsters known as homunculi. Watsuki envisioned the manga as his last shōnen manga, and then he tried to <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> he could with that genre. It was {{serialized}} in Shueisha's magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump from June 2003 to April 2005. The individual chapters were republished by Shueisha in ten tankōbon volumes. The series has been licensed by Viz Media for North American release.|$|E

500|$|For dream {{sequences}} in Inception, Nolan used little computer-generated imagery, preferring {{practical effects}} whenever possible. Nolan said, [...] "It's always {{very important to}} me to <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> possible in-camera, and then, if necessary, computer graphics are very useful to build on or enhance what you have achieved physically." [...] To this end, visual effects supervisor Paul Franklin built a miniature of the mountain fortress set and then blew it up for the film. For the fight scene that takes place in zero gravity, he used CG-based effects to [...] "subtly bend elements like physics, space and time." ...|$|E
500|$|Commercially, {{the song}} had limited success, {{reaching}} number 27 on the US Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs chart but only managing to peak at 99 Billboard Hot 100. Later {{in an interview}} with Billboard magazine, Garrett revealed that the song would not be included on Pink Friday and that the poor performance of the song was out of his control, [...] "I was only able to <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> I was allowed to do. Sometimes you have to step back and get off the wheel. I didn't have control of the entire creative process. A lot of [...] artists trust me enough and allow me to do what I know is best to do as a producer".|$|E
2500|$|In September 2006, Aiken was {{appointed}} to the Presidential Committee for People with Intellectual Disabilities by President George W. Bush. Appointees serve a two-year term; Aiken was sworn in September 14, 2006, by HHS Assistant Secretary for Children and Families Wade F. Horn, PhD In April 2008, Aiken told People Magazine that he was too busy to <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> he would like, but [...] "If there's something I can do remotely, I would've been happy to do it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear father," [...] John interrupted, [...] "I {{have told}} {{you that there is}} nothing at all out of the way in what we have done. Jonas and the others <b>did</b> just <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> I <b>did,</b> and methinks that some of them make much more than is needful of our skirmishes, and praise me because in so doing they praise themselves, who <b>did</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> I did." ...|$|R

6000|$|Norman's colour {{rose with}} the extreme pain this unjust {{accusation}} caused him, and his voice, though low, {{was not without}} irritation, [...] "I have tried. I have not <b>done</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> I ought, perhaps, but--" ...|$|R
2500|$|Paying fines {{broke the}} society into {{economic}} and social demographics in that the wealthy were free to <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> they could afford, whereas the fines themselves placed different values on the gender and ethnic demographics. [...] This social capital {{is evident in the}} differences in the Salic Law's punishment for murder based on a woman's ability to bear children. Women who could bear children were protected by a 600 shilling fine while the fine for murdering a woman who could no longer bear children was only 200 shillings. It is also interesting that all crimes committed against Romans had lesser fines than other social classes.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the first}} time ever Danilova has brought in session musicians: Nick Johnson (drums, who {{is also a member of}} her live band), Sean McCann (viola, violin) and Ryan York (cello, double bass). [...] "I can't play violin or cello or {{stand-up}} bass, or drums. I can play keyboards, kind of. So all the keyboard parts I wrote and played, and then I would send the string parts that I had wrote on the keyboard to the string players and they would just mimic that. Same with the drums. I try to <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> possible, still, but I wish I could play drums", she explained.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2014, the Kansas City Royals {{announced}} that they had hired Sweeney as a special assistant to baseball operations. Sweeney's response to receiving the new job: [...] "The only thing I was unable to accomplish during my playing days was to bring October baseball back to Kansas City. With this new position, my goal is <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> I can to help the Royals get back to {{being one of the}} prized organizations in baseball, {{as it was in the}} 1980s." [...] Sweeney settled into the role quite quickly, attending the Royals' spring training in Surprise, Arizona as a guest instructor that same month. That year, the Royals made the postseason for the first time in 29 years.|$|E

50|$|The {{science fiction}} and fantasy author Emil Petaja (1915-2000) was lifelong friend of Bok and {{collector}} of his work. After Bok's death, Petaja <b>did</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> anyone {{to keep the}} artist's work before the public eye.|$|R

2500|$|Smooth-talking and debonair, {{known as}} [...] "Jerry Belvedere" [...] {{to those who}} have no idea of his true identity, the Devil (played by Ray Wise) claims the rights to Sam's soul thanks to a deal he made with Sam's parents before Sam was even born. Although he knows how it all ends ("God wins"), he is {{determined}} to <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> he can to oppose God until the end. He also convinces Sam that he (Sam) is doing good by clearing the world of the escaped evil souls. Aside from Sam, Morgan, Cady, and Andi at least once, the Devil never appears before any of Sam's friends face-to-face, despite the Devil knowing all about Sock and Ben, and them being aware that they know Sam's secret job of being a reaper for the Devil. In the finale of Season Two Andi sells her soul to the devil in an attempt to free Sam from his own deal.|$|E
2500|$|In 1972, DeLorean was {{appointed}} to the position of vice president of car and truck production for the entire General Motors line, and his eventual rise to president seemed inevitable. However, the idea of him assuming that position was almost intolerable to GM executives, and on April 2, 1973, he announced that he was leaving the company, telling the press [...] "I want to do things in the social area. I have to do them, and unfortunately the nature of our business just didn't permit me to <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> I wanted." [...] although it was rumored that he had been fired. GM gave him a Florida Cadillac franchise as a retirement gift, and DeLorean did in fact take over the presidency of The National Alliance of Businessmen, a charitable organization with the mission of employing Americans in need, founded by Lyndon Johnson and Henry Ford. GM was a major contributor to the group, and agreed to continue his salary while he remained president of NAB. DeLorean was sharply critical of the direction GM had taken by the start of the 1970s, saying [...] "There's no forward response at General Motors to what the public wants today." [...] He also objected to the idea of using rebates to sell cars on the grounds that [...] "A car should make people's eyes light up when they step into the showroom. Rebates are merely a way of convincing customers to buy bland cars they're not interested in." ...|$|E
2500|$|Because {{treating}} people equally is not {{by itself}} enough to achieve equality for everyone, the law requires that employers owe positive duties to disabled people to give preferential treatment. According to Chacón Navas v Eurest Colectividades SA disabilities involve an impairment [...] "which hinders {{the participation of the}} person concerned in professional life". This includes all varieties of mental and physical disabilities. Because treating disabled people equally based on ability to perform tasks could easily result in persistence of exclusion from the workforce, employers are bound to <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> reasonably possible to ensure participation is not hindered in practice. Under the Equality Act 2010 sections 20 to 22, employers have to make [...] "reasonable adjustments". For example, employers may have to change physical features of a workplace, or provide auxiliary aids to work, or adjust their working habits and expectations. In effect, the law views society as being the cause of the [...] "disability" [...] if it fails to ensure people are accommodated, rather than seeing the person's handicap as being merely a personal misfortune. EA 2010 Schedule 8 lists more examples of reasonable adjustments, and the Equality and Human Rights Commission provides guidance. In the leading case, Archibald v Fife Council, it was held that the council had a duty to exempt a lady from competitive interviews for a new job. Mrs Archibald, previously a road sweeper, had lost the ability to walk after complications in surgery. Despite over 100 applications for grades just above a manual worker, in her submission, the employers were fixated on her past history as a sweeper. The House of Lords held it could be appropriate, before such an ordeal, for a worker to fill an existing vacancy without a standard interview procedure. By contrast, in O’Hanlon v Revenue and Customs Commissioners the Court of Appeal rejected {{that it would be a}} reasonable adjustment, as Ms O'Hanlon was requesting after falling into clinical depression, for an employer to increase sick pay to full pay, after the expiry of a six-month period that applied to everyone else. The aim is always to ensure that disabilities are not a barrier to full participation in working life, as much as possible.|$|E
50|$|Johnson {{says people}} who aim {{to do great}} things for {{humanity}} often end up feeling {{that they have not}} <b>done</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> they should. This should not discourage us, however; {{the important thing is to}} do whatever we can.|$|R
50|$|Bjørnson had <b>done</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> {{any other}} man to rouse Norwegian nationalistic feeling, but in 1903, {{on the verge of}} the rupture between Norway and Sweden, he preached {{conciliation}} and moderation to the Norwegians. However, in 1905 he largely remained silent.|$|R

50|$|The Water Boards governed territories {{that spanned}} several municipalities. Because of the {{complications}} this extra dimension gave to local governance, city planning was <b>done</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> possible {{in accordance with}} water management plans. To save time, the meetings were <b>done</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> possible near to the areas in question. This meant that the Dike-Reeve and his men needed to travel a lot. Since the Water Boards received their own income from taxes, they had enough {{money to spend on}} meeting halls, and they built meeting halls for convenience in out-of-the-way places. For this reason many meeting halls were unusually large that were located in very small towns, such as the Gemeenlandshuis Zwanenburg in Halfweg, or the Waterschapshuis in Onderdendam. These were locations that were strategically suited for meetings when the waterworks were being inspected.|$|R
