2500|$|Coonskin is said by its {{director}} {{to be about}} blacks and for whites, and by its ads to be for blacks and against whites. Its title was originally intended to break through racial stereotypes by its bluntness, but now the ads say the hero and <b>his</b> <b>pals</b> are out [...] "to get the Man to stop calling them coonskin." [...] The movie's original distributor, Paramount, dropped it after pressure from black groups. Now it's being sold by Bryanston as {{an attack on the}} system.

2500|$|Gleason did {{not make}} a strong {{impression}} on Hollywood at first; at the time he developed a nightclub act that included comedy and music. At the end of 1942, Gleason and Lew Parker led a large cast of entertainers in the road show production of Olsen and Johnson's New 1943 Hellzapoppin. He also became known for hosting all-night parties in his hotel suite; the hotel soundproofed his suite out of consideration for its other guests.

After Marvin's absurd death, Vincent and Jules wash up in Jimmie's bathroom, where they get into a contretemps over a bloody hand towel.

[...] "Ladies and gentleman, I would like to make the following statement", along with the lines [...] "the young generation, that sick generation" [...] and [...] "impressionable young people, brutal honesty will be shown on this screen" [...] are all taken from The Undertaker and <b>His</b> <b>Pals</b> (1966).

[...] "Return of the Phantom Stranger" [...] features the quote [...] "she lays there, waiting for the sacrifice" [...] from the film The Satanic Rites of Dracula (1973). Hellbilly Deluxe closes with the final song, [...] "The Beginning of the End". The song is an instrumental track, described as [...] "spastic" [...] and is said to [...] "suggest even more bizarre things are yet to come." [...] The track features the sound of industrial machine factory like noise layered over the music.|$|E
