5|$|In 1938, the T-26 was {{upgraded}} {{to the model}} 1938 version, which had a new conical turret with better anti-bullet resistance but the same welded hull as the T-26 mod. 1933 produced in 1935–1936. This proved insufficient in the Battle of Lake Khasan in 1938, so the tank was upgraded once more in February 1939 to have an underturret box with sloped (23°) 20mm side armoured plates. The turret featured an increase to 20mm at 18 degrees sloping. This time it was designated T-26-1 (known as the T-26 mod. 1939 in modern sources). There were subsequent attempts to thicken the <b>front</b> <b>plate,</b> but T-26 production soon ended in favour of other designs, such as the T-34.|$|E
25|$|The normal {{method of}} {{installation}} of a large spinner on a light aircraft involves installing a circular spinner back plate over the engine driveshaft, then the propeller, followed by a spinner <b>front</b> <b>plate.</b> The spinner dome is then mounted over this assembly and secured with screws to the back and front plates. Small plates are usually fitted behind the propeller {{to fill in the}} spinner dome cutouts and are secured to the backplate again with screws. Some spinner designs do not incorporate the <b>front</b> <b>plate,</b> although these are not suitable for higher-powered engines.|$|E
25|$|Some common {{exceptions}} include Trailers, {{which are}} issued only one plate, even {{in states that}} otherwise issue two plates to all passenger vehicles, while certain other non-passenger types, such as apportioned, may be issued in pairs even in states that otherwise issue only rear plates to passenger vehicles. Pennsylvania, for example, requires a <b>front</b> <b>plate</b> for semi-trailer trucks. Some vanity and specialty plates in Arizona and Kansas are issued in pairs, but only the rear plate is required on the vehicle; the <b>front</b> <b>plate</b> is free and fully optional.|$|E

25|$|Work {{on a more}} {{advanced}} armoured fighter, conceived as an armoured version of the Sopwith Snipe, began early in 1918. The forward portion of the fuselage was a 605lb (275kg) box of armour plate, forming {{an integral part of}} the aircraft structure, protecting the pilot and fuel system, with a 0.315 in (8mm) <b>front</b> <b>plate,</b> a 0.433 in (11mm) bottom plate, 0.236 in (6mm) side plates and rear armour consisting of an 11-gauge and 6-gauge plate separated by an air gap. The rear (unarmoured) section of the fuselage was a generally similar structure to the Snipe’s, but flat sided, to match the forepart. The two-bay wings and tailplane were identical in form to those of the Snipe, but were strengthened to cope with the extra weight, while the fin and rudder were identical to the Snipe. The new aircraft used the same Bentley BR2 rotary engine as the Snipe, covered by an unarmoured cowling – the foremost armour plate forming the firewall.|$|E

As a result, the type had the thinnest armour of any main battle tank produced at the time. The turret has a maximum armour thickness of , the armour sloped at 70 degrees on the <b>front</b> <b>plate</b> and 23 degrees on the side, offering protection against [...] armour piercing projectiles.

500|$|Several years later, Dibnah and {{his family}} went on holiday, to Blackpool. The trip was filmed for {{television}} and showed Dibnah's preference for working rather than holidaying. He did however manage to undertake the removal of a small chimney stack from a business in the town, under a distinctly grey sky and aided by his wife, Alison. His payment for the job was a new <b>front</b> <b>plate</b> for the boiler of his traction engine. Dibnah, however, refused to take any more holidays and, after 18years of marriage, Alison booked and paid for a holiday to Greece, taking their three children (Jayne, Lorna and Caroline) with her. Dibnah remained at home and was surprised when, upon her return, she asked for a divorce. One day in October 1985, Dibnah attended a solid fuel exhibition in nearby Bury. Upon his return he discovered that Alison had left the house, taking with her their three children, the dog and some items of furniture.

A Nebelkerzenabwurfvorrichtung (smoke grenade discharger rack) was mounted on the rear of the hull starting in July 1938 and was back fitted to earlier Ausf.A and Ausf.B chassis starting in August 1938. Forty-two Panzer IV Ausf.Bs were manufactured before the introduction of the Ausf.C in 1938.

2500|$|In Nevada, all motor vehicles, {{with the}} {{exception}} of motorcycles and trailers, are issued two license plates. According to state law, most standard passenger vehicles issued two plates are required to display them on both the front and rear bumpers of the vehicle. Display of the front license plate, however, is optional for vehicles that either were not designed to have a <b>front</b> <b>plate,</b> or the manufacturer did not provide a plate bracket or other means for front display of a license plate. As a result, the law to display both the front and rear plates is rarely enforced, and {{it is not uncommon for}} owners of vehicles with Nevada license plates to remove the manufacturer-supplied front license plate brackets from their vehicles and display only the rear plate. In 2015, Wyoming passed a law, similar to Nevada, that does not require a front license plate on vehicles that either are not specifically designed to have a <b>front</b> <b>plate,</b> or the manufacturer did not provide a plate bracket or other means for front display of a license plate. Nebraska passed an identical law in 2016.

2500|$|A played note of E or F has a {{frequency}} {{which is often}} {{very close to the}} natural resonating frequency of the body of the instrument, [...] and if the problem is not addressed this can set the body into near resonance. [...] This may cause an unpleasant sudden amplification of this pitch, [...] and additionally a loud beating sound results from the interference produced between these nearby frequencies; this is known as the “wolf tone” because it is an unpleasant growling sound. The wood resonance appears to be split into two frequencies by the driving force of the sounding string. These two periodic resonances beat with each other. This wolf tone must be eliminated or significantly reduced for the cello to play the nearby notes with a pleasant tone. This can be accomplished by modifying the cello <b>front</b> <b>plate,</b> attaching a wolf eliminator (a metal cylinder or a rubber cylinder encased in metal), or moving the sound post.|$|E
2500|$|The Germans {{also noted}} that the T-34 was very slow to find and engage targets, while their own tanks could {{typically}} get off three rounds for every one fired by the T-34. When new German tanks types with thicker armour began appearing in mid-1942, the T-34's 76.2mm cannon had to fire at their flanks to assure penetration. As a result, the T-34 was upgraded to the T-34-85 model. This model, with its 85mm (3.35in) ZiS gun, provided greatly increased firepower compared to the previous T-34's 76.2mm gun. The 85mm gun could penetrate the turret front of a Tiger I tank from [...] and the driver's <b>front</b> <b>plate</b> from [...] at the side angle of 30 degrees, and the larger turret enabled the addition of another crew member, allowing the roles of commander and gunner to be separated and increasing the rate of fire and overall effectiveness. Against the frontal armour of the Panther at 30 degree sidewards, the T-34-85 could not penetrate the non-mantlet of its turret at , meaning that even upgraded models of the T-34 usually needed tungsten rounds or had to flank a Panther to destroy it.|$|E

From head to foot I was splashed and crimsoned with blood, partly my own, but mostly that of others. My headpiece was dinted with blows.

Two or three other cracks and stars showed where the good sheet of proof steel had saved me. My left arm was stiff and well-nigh powerless from the corporal's stab, but on stripping off my doublet and examining the place, I found that though there had been much bleeding the wound was on the outer side of the bone, and was therefore of no great import. A kerchief dipped in water and bound tightly round it eased the smart and stanched the blood. Beyond this scratch I had no injuries, though from my own efforts I felt as stiff and sore all over as though I had been well cudgelled, and the slight wound got in Wells Cathedral had reopened and was bleeding. With a little patience and cold water, however, I was able to dress it and to tie myself up as well as any chirurgeon in the kingdom.|$|E
