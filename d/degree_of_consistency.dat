This method revealed a high <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>consistency,</b> suggesting that most if not all of the glyphs represent astronomical and navigational concepts. Dietrich argues that other researchers have been misled by the literal resemblances of the glyphs, not realizing that they are abstract symbols for the stars (cf. western astronomical symbols). This fits a pattern consistent among many cultures, in which constellations are identified with people, animals, objects, and mythological beings.|$|E

60|$|The cavilling {{of these}} people, awkwardly contrasted with their {{personal}} absurdity and insipidity, at length provoked the serious {{notice of the}} two illustrious associates: the result was this German Dunciad; a production of which the plan was, that it should comprise an immense multitude of detached couplets, each conveying a complete thought within itself, and furnished {{by one of the}} joint operators. The subjects were of unlimited variety; 'the most,' as Schiller says, 'were wild satire, glancing at writers and writings, intermixed with here and there a flash of poetical or philosophic thought.' It was at first intended to provide about a thousand of these pointed monodistichs; unity in such a work appearing to consist in a certain boundlessness of size, which should hide the heterogeneous nature of the individual parts: the whole were then to be arranged and elaborated, till they had acquired the proper <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>consistency</b> and symmetry; each sacrificing something of its own peculiar spirit to preserve the spirit of the rest. This number never was completed: and, Goethe being now busy with his Wilhelm Meister, the project of completing it was at length renounced; and the Xenien were published as unconnected particles, not pretending to constitute a whole. Enough appeared to create unbounded commotion among the parties implicated: the Xenien were exclaimed against, abused, and replied to, on all hands; but as they declared war not on persons but on actions; not against Gleim, Nicolai, Manso, but against bad taste, dulness, and affectation, nothing criminal could be sufficiently made out against them.[31] The Musen-Almanach, where they appeared in 1797, continued to be published till the time of Schiller's leaving Jena: the Horen ceased some months before.|$|E
60|$|It is obvious, too, {{that even}} when the probabilities are derived from {{observation}} and experiment, a very slight improvement in the data, by better observations, or by taking into fuller consideration the special circumstances of the case, is of more use than the most elaborate application of the calculus to probabilities founded on the data in their previous state of inferiority. The neglect of this obvious reflection {{has given rise to}} misapplications of the calculus of probabilities which have made it the real opprobrium of mathematics. It is sufficient to refer to the applications made of it to the credibility of witnesses, and to the correctness of the verdicts of juries. In regard to the first, common sense would dictate {{that it is impossible to}} strike a general average of the veracity and other qualifications for true testimony of mankind, or of any class of them; and even if it were possible, the employment of it for such a purpose implies a misapprehension of the use of averages, which serve, indeed, to protect those whose interest is at stake, against mistaking the general result of large masses of instances, but are of extremely small value as grounds of expectation in any one individual instance, unless the case be one of those in which the great majority of individual instances do not differ much from the average.

40|$|In {{geographic}} information systems, {{the reliability of}} querying, analysing, or reasoning results depends on the data quality. One central criterion of data quality is consistency, and identifying inconsistencies is crucial for maintaining the integrity of spatial data from multiple sources or at multiple resolutions. In traditional methods <b>of</b> <b>consistency</b> assessment, vector data are used as the primary experimental data. In this manuscript, we describe {{the use of a}} new type of raster data, tile maps, to access the <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> information from multiscale representations of the water bodies that make up drainage systems. We describe a hierarchical methodology to determine the spatial <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> tile-map datasets that display water areas in a raster format. Three characteristic indices, the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> global feature <b>consistency,</b> the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> local feature <b>consistency,</b> and the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> overlap, are proposed to measure the <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> multiscale representations of water areas. The perceptual hash algorithm and the scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) descriptor are applied to extract and measure the global and local features of water areas. By performing combined calculations using these three characteristic indices, the <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> multiscale representations of water areas can be divided into five grades: exactly consistent, highly consistent, moderately consistent, less consistent, and inconsistent. For evaluation purposes, the proposed method is applied to several test areas from the Tiandi map of China. In addition, we identify key technologies that are related to the process of extracting water areas from a tile map. The accuracy <b>of</b> the <b>consistency</b> assessment method is evaluated, and our experimental results confirm that the proposed methodology is efficient and accurate...|$|R

We show that, in analogy to convex temporal problems and discrete row-convex problems, convexity properties of the solution spaces can be exploited to compute minimal and decomposable networks using path consistency algorithms. Based on these properties, we also show that a certain class of non binary CSPs can be solved using strong 5 -consistency. ...|$|R
