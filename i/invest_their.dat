It overthrew Antonescu in August, by means of the successful King Michael Coup.|$|E

Of all the local authorities, Kent County Council has the most money invested in Icelandic banks, currently £50 million.

Local authorities were working under government advice to <b>invest</b> <b>their</b> money across many national and international banks as a way of spreading risk. Other UK organisations said to have invested heavily include police services and fire authorities, and even the Audit Commission. It is hoped that about one-third of the deposited money will be available fairly rapidly, corresponding to the liquid assets of the UK subsidiaries: liquidation of other assets, such as loans and offices, will take longer.|$|E

25|$|Lesbian {{feminism}} typically situates {{the state}} of being a lesbian {{as a form of}} resistance to patriarchal institutions. Sexual orientation is posited here as a choice, or at least a conscious response to a situation. It is also seen as a critique of male supremacy, chauvinism, and masculinity in general. Lesbian separatism is a form of separatist feminism specific to lesbians. In separatist feminism, lesbianism is posited as a key feminist strategy that enables women to <b>invest</b> <b>their</b> energies in other women, creating new space and dialogue about women's relationships, and typically limits their dealings with men.|$|E
25|$|The {{economist}} Michèle Tertilt {{concludes that}} countries that practice polygyny are less economically stable {{than those that}} practice monogamy. Polygynous countries usually have a higher fertility rate, fewer savings reserves, and a lower GDP. Fertility would decrease by 40%, savings would increase by 70%, and GDP would increase by 170% if polygyny was banned. Monogamous societies present a surge in economic productivity because monogamous men are able to save and <b>invest</b> <b>their</b> resources due to having fewer children. Polygynous societies have a higher concentration of men investing into methods of mating with women, whereas monogamous men invest more into their families and other related institutions.|$|E

25|$|Certain {{insurance}} products and practices {{have been described}} as rent-seeking by critics. That is, some {{insurance products}} or practices are useful primarily because of legal benefits, such as reducing taxes, as opposed to providing protection against risks of adverse events. Under United States tax law, for example, most owners of variable annuities and variable life insurance can <b>invest</b> <b>their</b> premium payments in the stock market and defer or eliminate paying any taxes on their investments until withdrawals are made. Sometimes this tax deferral is the only reason people use these products. Another example is the legal infrastructure which allows life insurance to be held in an irrevocable trust which is used to pay an estate tax while the proceeds themselves are immune from the estate tax.|$|E
25|$|Companies {{occupy a}} special place in private law, because they have a legal {{personality}} separate from those who <b>invest</b> <b>their</b> capital and labour to run the business. The general rules of contract, tort and unjust enrichment operate in the first place against the company as a distinct entity. This differs fundamentally from other forms of business association. A sole trader acquires rights and duties as normal under the general law of obligations. If people carry on business together with a view to profit, they are deemed to have formed a partnership under the Partnership Act 1890 section 1. Like a sole trader, partners will be liable on any contract or tort obligation jointly and severally in shares equal to their monetary contribution, or according to their culpability. Law, accountancy and actuarial firms are commonly organised as partnerships. Since the Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2000, partners can limit the amount they are liable for to their monetary investment in the business, if the partnership owes more money than the enterprise has. Outside these professions, however, the most common method for businesses to limit their liability is by forming a company.|$|E

Most people in this municipality <b>invest</b> <b>their</b> hard-earned income for the education of their children through farming, employment, small businesses or through the remittances of a family member working abroad. Due to strong family ties, there is also a practice among children of bigger families on supporting each other to get college education.

25|$|Corporations are {{chartered}} {{under state}} law, the larger mostly in Delaware, but leave investors free to organize voting rights and board representation as they choose. Because of unequal bargaining power, but also historic caution of labor unions, shareholders monopolize voting rights in American corporations. From the 1970s employees and unions sought representation on company boards. This could happen through collective agreements, as it historically occurred in Germany or other countries, or through employees demanding further representation through employee stock ownership plans, but they aimed for voice independent from capital risks {{that could not}} be diversified. By 1980, workers had attempted to secure board representation at corporations including United Airlines, the General Tire and Rubber Company, and the Providence and Worcester Railroad. However, in 1974 the Securities and Exchange Commission, run by appointees of Richard Nixon, had rejected that employees who held shares in AT were entitled to make shareholder proposals to include employee representatives on the board of directors. This position was eventually reversed expressly by the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 §971, which subject to rules by the Securities and Exchange Commission entitles shareholders to put forward nominations for the board. Instead of pursuing board seats through shareholder resolutions the United Auto Workers, for example, successfully sought board representation by collective agreement at Chrysler in 1980. The United Steel Workers secured board representation in five corporations in 1993. Some representation plans were linked to employee stock ownership plans, and were open to abuse. At the energy company, Enron, workers were encouraged by management to invest an average of 62.5 per cent of their retirement savings from 401(k) plans in Enron stock against basic principles of prudent, diversified investment, and had no board representation. When Enron collapsed in 2003, employees lost a majority of their pension savings. For this reason, employees and unions have sought representation because they <b>invest</b> <b>their</b> labor in the firm, and do not want undiversifiable capital risk. Empirical research suggests by 1999 there were at least 35 major employee representation plans with worker directors, though often linked to corporate stock.|$|E

500|$|The film {{switches}} the infertility from male {{to female}} but never explains its cause: environmental destruction and divine punishment are considered.

It's become now what I call a medium for lazy readers... Cinema is a hostage of narrative. [...] And I'm very good at narrative as a hostage of cinema." [...] Cuarón's disdain for back-story and exposition led him to use the concept of female infertility as a [...] "metaphor for the fading sense of hope". [...] The [...] "almost mythical" [...] Human Project is turned into a [...] "metaphor for the possibility of the evolution of the human spirit, the evolution of human understanding." [...] Without dictating how the audience should feel {{by the end of the}} film, Cuarón encourages viewers to come to their own conclusions about the sense of hope depicted in the final scenes: [...] "We wanted the end to be a glimpse of a possibility of hope, for the audience to <b>invest</b> <b>their</b> own sense of hope into that ending. So if you're a hopeful person you'll see a lot of hope, and if you're a bleak person you'll see a complete hopelessness at the end." ...|$|E

[...] They also removed the darker elements of Lee's work, including Helen Chao's suicide after her desperate fling with Ta, added the festive nightclub subplot and emphasized the romantic elements of the story. [...] According to David Lewis in his book about the musical, [...] "Mr. Hammerstein and his colleagues were evidently in no mood to write a musical drama or even to <b>invest</b> <b>their</b> comedic approach with dramatic counterpoint of the sort that Jud Fry had given Oklahoma!... took the safest commercial route by following the eldest son's search for love – the most popular theme at the time with Broadway audiences." [...] Lewis notes that Chao's role, though diminished in the musical, nevertheless gives it some of its darkest moments, and she serves much the same purpose as Jud Fry: [...] to be, in Hammerstein's words, [...] "the bass fiddle that gives body to the orchestration of the story". [...] Though the new story was less artistically adventurous than the earlier Rodgers and Hammerstein hits, it was innovative, even daring in its treatment of Asian-Americans, [...] "an ethnic group that had long been harshly caricatured and marginalized in our mainstream pop culture." ...|$|E

The liability of a company itself is unlimited (companies have to pay all they owe with the assets they have), but the liability of those who <b>invest</b> <b>their</b> capital in a company is (generally) limited to their shares, and those who <b>invest</b> <b>their</b> labour can only lose their jobs.

A bank, for instance, may not lend to a small company unless the company's director gives his own house as security for the loan (e.g., by mortgage).
