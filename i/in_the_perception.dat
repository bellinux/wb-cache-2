5|$|Vertigo {{refers to}} the {{inappropriate}} perception of motion. This is due to dysfunction of the vestibular system. One common type of vertigo is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, when an otolith is displaced from the ventricles to the semicircular canal. The displaced otolith rests on the cupola, causing a sensation of movement when there is none. Ménière's disease, labyrinthitis, strokes, and other infective and congenital diseases may also result <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> of vertigo.|$|E
