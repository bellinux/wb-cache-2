5000|$|Disinfection by {{chlorination}} can be problematic, in some circumstances. Chlorine {{can react}} with naturally occurring organic compounds {{found in the}} water supply to produce compounds known as disinfection by-products (DBPs). The most common DBPs are trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs). Trihalomethanes are the main disinfectant by-products created from chlorination with two different types, bromoform and <b>dibromochloromethane,</b> which are mainly responsible for health hazards. Their effects depend strictly on the duration of their exposure to the chemicals and the amount ingested into the body. In high doses, bromoform mainly slows down regular brain activity, which is manifested by symptoms such as sleepiness or sedation. Chronic exposure of both bromoform and <b>dibromochloromethane</b> can cause liver and kidney cancer, as well as heart disease, unconsciousness, or death in high doses. Due to the potential carcinogenicity of these compounds, drinking water regulations across the developed world require regular monitoring of the concentration of these compounds in the distribution systems of municipal water systems. The World Health Organization has stated that [...] "the risks to health from these by-products are extremely small {{in comparison with the}} risks associated with inadequate disinfection".|$|E

50|$|Trihalomethanes {{are formed}} as a {{by-product}} predominantly when chlorine is used to disinfect water for drinking. They represent one group of chemicals generally referred to as disinfection by-products. They result from the reaction of chlorine or bromine with organic matter present in the water being treated.

However, trihalomethanes are only one group of many hundreds of possible disinfection by-products - {{the vast majority of}} which are not monitored - and it has not yet been clearly demonstrated which of these are the most plausible candidate for causation of these health effects.

Using questionnaires, demographics and drinking water consumption rates were determined. Individual and population based exposures and risks were estimated by employing deterministic and probabilistic approaches, respectively. Trihalomethanes (THMs) (i. e., chloroform, bromodichloromethane, <b>dibromochloromethane,</b> and bromoform), benzene, toluene, p-xylene, and naphthalene were the most frequently detected VOCs in İzmir drinking water with concentrations ranging from below detection limit to 35. g/l. None of the samples exceeded the maximum contaminant levels stated in the Turkish, European, and American drinking water regulations. For all VOCs, the concentrations measured in metropolitan area were greater than those in other districts. All THM species were detected in higher concentrations in tap water. Noncarcinogenic risks attributable to ingestion of VOCs in İzmir drinking water were negligible whereas the mean carcinogenic risk estimates for bromodichloromethane and <b>dibromochloromethane</b> were above the acceptable level of {{one in a million}} (10 - 6).

Chloroform, bromoform, <b>dibromochloromethane</b> and dichloroacetonitrile were the most frequently detected compounds.

30|$|THMs {{consist of}} several methane {{derivative}} compounds {{and the four}} chemical species, comprise chloroform (CF), bromodichloromethane (BDCM), <b>dibromochloromethane</b> (DBCM) and bromoform (BF). THMs were suspected to cause not only cancer but also liver and kidney damage, retarded fetus growth, birth defects and possibly miscarriage (Wright et al. 2004). The US Department of Health and Human Services has determined that chloroform may be anticipated to be a carcinogen. Also, {{it has been shown}} that <b>dibromochloromethane</b> and bromoform could damage the nervous system (USEPA 2001). Though the reported concentrations of halonitromethanes (HNMs) were much lower than THMs and HAAs and have not been regulated, cytotoxicity and genotoxicity posed by HNMs are comparable or even higher as compared to THMs and HAAs (Richardson et al. 2007). To minimize the risk of cancer, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have introduced regulations for levels of some DBPs in drinking water. USEPA regulation for THMs concentrations was set at 80  μg/L (USEPA 2001). WHO has suggested a provisional guideline value of 20  μg/L for DCAN, while DBAN guideline value was set at 70  μg/L (WHO 2008).

Questionnaires were administered to one participant in each house to determine demographics and drinking water consumption rates. Oral exposure and risks were estimated for each participant and İzmir population by deterministic and probabilistic approaches, respectively. The four trihalomethane (THM) species (i. e., chloroform, bromodichloromethane, <b>dibromochloromethane,</b> and bromoform), benzene, toluene, p-xylene, and naphthalene were the most frequently detected VOCs with concentrations ranging from below detection limit to 35 μg/l.

For all VOCs, the concentrations measured in metropolitan area were greater than those in other districts. All THM species were detected in higher concentrations in tap water, whereas nontap water contained more benzene, toluene, p-xylene, and naphthalene. Therefore, the concentrations of the latter four compounds and associated risks increased with increasing income and education level since bottled water was used in larger proportions within these subgroups.

30|$|Natural {{organic matter}} (NOM) which is {{ubiquitous}} in aquatic environments, ground and soil waters, has recently {{become an issue}} of worldwide concern in drinking water treatment (Rao et al. 2011). The major components of NOM are humic substances (HS) which are typically naturally occurring compounds that account for 30 – 80 % of the dissolved organic matters in natural water (Yang et al. 2004). HS mainly consist of humic acid (HA), fulvic acid (FA), and humin (Matilainen et al. 2011). Since the early 1970 s, water quality and treatment issues related to NOM have been reported, where these substances in natural water facilitated bacteria reproduction during drinking water distribution and produced harmful disinfection by-products (DBP), such as trihalomethanes (THMs), during chlorination process. They also caused {{a reduction in the}} effectiveness of water purification by interfering with various oxidants, increasing the solubility of heavy metals due to complexation with metals and adsorbed organic pollutants (Yang et al. 2007). Four main THM compounds are chloroform (CHCl 3), dichlorobromomethane (CHBrCl 2), <b>dibromochloromethane</b> (CHBr 2 Cl) and bromoform (CHBr 3). They are classified as potentially carcinogenic chlorine organic compounds (Lee et al. 2009).|$|E

Disinfection by-products (DBPs) are ubiquitous contaminants in tap drinking water {{with the potential to}} produce adverse health effects. Filtering and boiling tap water can lead to changes in the DBP concentrations and modify the exposure through ingestion. Changes in the concentration of 4 individual trihalomethanes (THM 4) (chloroform (TCM), bromodichloromethane (BDCM), <b>dibromochloromethane</b> (DBCM), and bromoform (TBM)),MX, and bromate were tested when boiling and �ltering high bromine-containing tapwater fromBarcelona. For �ltering, we used a pitcher-type �lter and a household reverse osmosis �lter; for boiling, an electric kettle, a saucepan, and amicrowave were used. Samples were taken before and aer each treatment to determine the change in the DBP concentration. pH, conductivity, and free/total chlorine were also measured. A large decrease of THM 4 (from 48 % to 97 %) andMX concentrations was observed for all experiments. Bromine-containing trihalomethanes weremostly eliminated when �ltering while chloroform when boiling. ere was a large decrease in the concentration of bromate with reverse osmosis, but ther...|$|E
