25|$|In {{addition}} to these two loose groupings, a number of prominent Irish poets {{of the second half}} of the 20th century could be described as outsiders, although these poets could also be considered leaders of a mainstream tradition in the Republic which was critically eclipsed by the Ulster-centric focus of American and British-based Irish Studies academics and the prejudices of others who are gender study specialists. These include Thomas Kinsella (born 1928), whose early work was influenced by Auden. Kinsella's later work exhibits the influence of Pound in its looser metrical structure and use of imagery but is deeply personal in manner and matter. He <b>is</b> <b>Professor</b> <b>of</b> English at Temple University, Philadelphia.
