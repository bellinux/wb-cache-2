5|$|The loggerhead {{sea turtle}} is omnivorous, feeding mainly on bottom-dwelling invertebrates. Its large and {{powerful}} jaws serve as an effective tool for <b>dismantling</b> its prey.

Once the turtles reach adulthood, their formidable size limits predation to large marine animals, such as sharks.|$|E
5|$|After the Six-Day War, Jerusalem's {{municipal}} borders were {{expanded to}} include the Old City and beyond. Barricades that had lined the border were torn down. Many buildings on Mamilla's eastern end were in shambles from the fighting and lack of maintenance. Several historic buildings were condemned. One was the Stern House, which housed Zionist leader Theodor Herzl on his 1898 visit. However, popular outcry brought Supreme Court involvement {{which led to the}} temporary <b>dismantling</b> and reassembly nearby of this historical landmark.|$|E

5|$|It {{was hoped}} that the Air Force would guard the plane, but, lacking hangar space, it was left {{outdoors}} on a remote part of the air base, exposed to the elements.

The components were transported to the Smithsonian storage facility at Suitland, Maryland, on 21 July 1961.|$|E
50|$|Only {{the southeastern}} corner guard tower has survived. To avoid disrupting rail {{service at the}} nearby main train station while the metro was being built, the metro was routed {{away from the city}} walls and the southeastern corner guard tower. Thus the tower survived, along with a section of the Inner city wall. The northeastern tower was <b>dismantled</b> in 1920 and its {{platform}} in 1953. The northwestern tower was destroyed by Russian cannon fire in 1900 during the Boxer Rebellion. Its platform was <b>dismantled</b> in 1969.

5|$|Set against this, the purges of the Red Army leadership, {{in which}} Molotov participated, {{weakened}} the Soviet Union's defence capacity {{and contributed to}} the military disasters of 1941 and 1942, which were mostly caused by unreadiness for war. The purges also led to the <b>dismantling</b> of privatised agriculture and its replacement by collectivised agriculture. This left a legacy of chronic agricultural inefficiencies and under-production which the Soviet regime never fully rectified.|$|E
5|$|St Mihangel's Church in {{the village}} of Llanfihangel yn Nhowyn is a former parish church now used as the chapel for RAF Valley in Anglesey, north Wales. The date of the first church on the site is uncertain, but in 1862 the {{then-existing}} church was rebuilt. St Mihangel's became the chapel for the nearby Royal Air Force base in 1998, after the Church in Wales had ceased using it for services. It was then extended by <b>dismantling</b> and reassembling another Anglesey church, St Enghenedl's, at the west end of the building.|$|E

At the Battle of Ankara, Timur's forces routed Bayezid I's forces, a shocking defeat for which no one was prepared. In the aftermath, the Ottoman Turks began fighting each other led by Bayezid's sons.|$|E

5|$|The {{house was}} used by Ames, and later by Connecticut College, as a rental property, until the {{structure}} was slated for demolition in 2004. The push to restore the house is credited to Doug Royalty, who worked with the college's Abigail Van Slyck. Completed in 2013, restoration cost $500,000 and involved several phases, including the <b>dismantling,</b> transportation, and reassembly of the house. The house {{was added to the}} Connecticut Historic Register in July 2007 and it was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 28, 2009.|$|E
5|$|When invading another's house, {{the player}} can attempt to deter these {{defenses}} in such ways as smashing windows, <b>dismantling</b> walls, short-circuiting machines, and even drugging guard dogs with tainted meat, {{in addition to}} killing any residents that are armed. Reaching a vault is always possible with enough skill; the game forces players to escape their own traps before other players can access them. Being caught in one's own traps has the same consequence as any other trap in the game: permadeath.|$|E
5|$|After the war ended, {{the fort}} {{remained}} standing into the 1840s; {{in the immediate}} aftermath of the war's conclusion the site was occupied by two squatters. In 1847 George Bainbridge purchased the land and the fort from the United States federal government. Bainbridge salvaged what logs were usable from the fort, <b>dismantling</b> it in the process, and used them to construct a barn on his property. The fort site remained relatively undisturbed in the ensuing years. In 1994 the non-profit Apple River Historical Foundation was organized and archaeological investigation was conducted in 1995. In June 1997 a reconstruction effort ended, and today a replica of the fort stands to the south of the original site, which remains undisturbed to preserve its archaeological integrity.|$|E
