2500|$|In 2005, the {{chiropractic}} subluxation {{was defined}} by the World Health Organization as [...] "a lesion or dysfunction in a joint or motion segment in which alignment, movement integrity and/or physiological function are altered, although contact between joint surfaces remains intact. It is essentially a <b>functional</b> <b>entity,</b> which may influence biomechanical and neural integrity." [...] This differs from the medical definition of subluxation as a significant structural displacement, which can be seen with static imaging techniques such as X-rays. This exposes patients to harmful ionizing radiation for no evidentially supported reason. The 2008 book Trick or Treatment states [...] "X-rays can reveal neither the subluxations nor the innate intelligence associated with chiropractic philosophy, {{because they do not}} exist." [...] Attorney David Chapman-Smith, Secretary-General of the World Federation of Chiropractic, has stated that [...] "Medical critics have asked how there can be a subluxation if it cannot be seen on X-ray. The answer is that the chiropractic subluxation is essentially a <b>functional</b> <b>entity,</b> not structural, and is therefore no more visible on static X-ray than a limp or headache or any other functional problem." [...] The General Chiropractic Council, the statutory regulatory body for chiropractors in the United Kingdom, states that the chiropractic vertebral subluxation complex [...] "is not supported by any clinical research evidence that would allow claims to be made that it is the cause of disease." ...|$|E

The implicit target was Dobrogeanu-Gherea, depicted by Negulescu as a pale imitator of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and his [...] "social destination" [...] of art. However, with Religiunea și arta, Negulescu went beyond Maiorescu's theories, and closer to Dobrogeanu-Gherea's, proposing that poetic art was not just a luxury of advanced societies, but also a <b>functional</b> <b>entity</b> that contributed to social progress. He also proposed interpreting style and tastefulness as variables emerging from objective psychological criteria, such as the [...] "economy of attention" [...] and [...] "nervous excitement". On this basis, he proposed a general hierarchy of art by appeal and subject matter, ranking old Egyptian murals below Italian Renaissance painting, but above the minor art of medieval goldsmiths. He believed that art and religion served similar purposes in stirring up vital emotions, and amended the art for art's sake theory with his ideas on [...] "impersonality", implying objectivity for the artist, but also a subjective, self-absorbed, relevancy for his artistic creation.|$|E
