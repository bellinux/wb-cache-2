5|$|Avadhi, {{which is}} a dialect of Hindi, is {{primarily}} from a region in Uttar Pradesh. It was chosen to give the <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> language spoken during that era. However, the language was diluted, and modern viewers can understand it. The dialogues, which were a combination of three dialects (Avadhi, Bhojpuri and Braj Bhasha) were penned by Hindi writer K. P. Saxena.|$|E
5|$|Meyer {{had never}} been happy with the brightly lit {{corridors}} and <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enterprise, a dissatisfaction that extended to his work on The Wrath of Khan. For The Undiscovered Country, Meyer wanted the Enterprise interiors to feel grittier and more realistic; the metal was worn around the edges to look used without looking beat up. Narita's plans to transform {{the look of the}} Enterprise on a scale not seen since The Wrath of Khan were complicated by the necessary use of existing sets.|$|E

5|$|Production {{designer}} Kenneth Mak included Western {{elements in}} his design, since Foshan, in earlier years, {{was a unique}} place where Chinese and Western cultures converged. Pillars were made to resemble English lampposts, and Western lighting, chairs and tableware were also used. To convey the culture and <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time, the buildings were made to look obsolete and worn out. Apart from historical references, Mak also created a glass house which was used in a scene in the film.|$|E
5|$|Written by Gareth Roberts. A story idea {{considered}} for the seventh and eighth episodes of the fourth series. It would have seen Sarah Jane being kidnapped and replaced by an identical look-alike. It was ultimately replaced by The Empty Planet as the production team was concerned it had {{too much of the}} <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1970s Gerry Anderson science-fiction series, UFO.|$|E
5|$|As {{the houses}} in the Ghetto age, and {{as the number of}} {{students}} wishing to live in the Ghetto expands, the university has begun a renovation and replacement program with the goal of keeping the current <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> area intact. In 2000, construction began on several new duplexes to fill land that was unused, resulting in housing for several dozen additional students. The duplexes housed six students per side, for a total of 12 students each. In 2003, the university continued the project by tearing down several houses on Stonemill Road and replacing them with a new five-person design. Several more of these houses have now been built throughout the Ghetto.|$|E

25|$|Common {{myths about}} Kant's {{personal}} mannerisms are listed, explained, and refuted in Goldthwait's introduction to his translation <b>of</b> Observations on <b>the</b> <b>Feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Beautiful and Sublime. It is often held that Kant lived a very strict and disciplined life, {{leading to an}} oft-repeated story that neighbors would set their clocks by his daily walks. He never married, but {{seemed to have a}} rewarding social life — he was a popular teacher and a modestly successful author even before starting on his major philosophical works. He had a circle of friends whom he frequently met, among them Joseph Green, an English merchant in Königsberg.|$|R
5|$|From 21 April 2001, Live & Kicking began {{broadcasting}} from BBC Scotland in Glasgow and saw Farley, Cawood and Deley {{joined by}} Heather Suttie who replaced Hill. The set {{remained the same}} after having been transported up to Glasgow from London, however a new seating area was added, consisting of pouffes and beanbags. The <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> show also changed and was also split into three sections. The first hour became Kicking Toons which bunched all the cartoons together, the next hour would feature {{the main components of}} Live & Kicking including the games and sketches and the final hour became Live & Loud which featured all the music performances.|$|E
5|$|Hawke {{starred in}} the 2005 action thriller Assault on Precinct 13, a loose remake of John Carpenter's 1976 film of the same title, with an updated plot. The film {{received}} ambivalent reviews; some critics praised the dark swift <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film, while others compared it unfavorably to John Carpenter's original. Hawke also appeared that year in the political crime thriller Lord of War, playing an Interpol agent chasing an arms dealer played by Nicolas Cage. In 2006, Hawke was cast in a supporting role in Fast Food Nation, directed by Richard Linklater based on Eric Schlosser's best-selling 2001 book. The same year Hawke directed his second feature, The Hottest State, based on his eponymous 1996 novel. The film was released in August 2007 to a tepid reception.|$|E
5|$|Many fans wanted Snake Eater {{to use a}} 3D camera, {{but this}} was {{ultimately}} not implemented in the game. Kojima views Metal Gear Solid, Sons of Liberty and Snake Eater as a trilogy, and wished to keep the camera {{the same as the}} previous two {{in order to keep the}} <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three games the same. He did, however, acknowledge that the current trend for video games is to use the 3D camera. The camera was later implemented in an updated version of Snake Eater titled , and further installments in the franchise.|$|E

5|$|New {{memorial}} buildings {{could also}} adopt a medieval style. The Scottish National War Memorial, for example, a Scots baronial styled memorial hall complete with stained glass in Edinburgh Castle, attempts {{to blend in}} with the surrounding medieval fortress. In Germany, the totenburgen usually looked to the past for their style; Tannenberg, for example, was heavily medieval in appearance, resembling a castle, albeit combined with a huge cross and mass graves. The dolmen boulders used around the outside of many German memorials reinforced the archaic <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> monuments. In other cases Germans chose to preserve or rebuild real medieval buildings and architecture to form war memorials, such as parts of Dorsten and Dülken.|$|E
5|$|Nidhogg is a side-scrolling two-player {{fighting}} {{video game}} developed {{and published by}} Messhof. Players duel with swords in a pixelated environment. The game was commissioned for the New York University Game Center's annual multiplayer show, and was revised and demoed at private events {{over the next four}} years before its final release. It won Indiecade 2013's Game Design award and the 2011 Independent Games Festival's Nuovo award. It was released for Microsoft Windows on January 13, 2014, and later ported to OS X, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation Vita. Critics praised the <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gameplay and its balance, but considered its single-player mode unsatisfying. Messhof released a sequel in 2017 with a higher resolution art style and additional weapons and arenas.|$|E
5|$|The team {{tried to}} capture the <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{original}} game with updated graphics and sounds in the demo. It was to feature ten short interactive scenes from Chrono Trigger. Despite receiving requests from fans, the development team {{did not intend to}} create a complete remake of the original game since they would not have the necessary resources, and because they thought the result would not have been on par with Square Enix-developed titles. The story of the game was altered slightly to allow for the ten scenes to better flow from one to the other.|$|E

5|$|There {{are also}} several alumni owned {{vehicles}} that are painted {{to resemble the}} Wreck. These vehicles mimic the look and <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Reck but are not the Ramblin' Wreck. One {{of the most famous}} instances of mistaken identity occurred in 1988. A father-son duo of Georgia Tech alums attempted to lead the Tech football team onto the field at Sanford Stadium in Athens. After getting inside of the stadium with their gold 1924 Ford Model T, the two were finally stopped by Georgia officials who were informed the real Ramblin' Wreck had remained in Atlanta.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Willamette University {{purchased}} the old building from the YWCA. The $1.35 million purchase included the main YWCA building {{adjacent to the}} former library {{for a total of}} , with the YWCA continuing their operations in the building for three years after the sale. After that group left the building in 2006, Willamette spent $4.6 million ($2 million more than originally planned) to remodel the old library building over a year's time and convert it into the Oregon Civic Justice Center as part of the College of Law. The remodeling project began in the summer of 2007 and included removing a swimming pool structure that had been added to the south of the building, while also adding a new entrance to the former library on the same side as where the pool was located. Renovations also removed a mezzanine that the YWCA had added to the upper portion of the main floor. Other renovations included new heating, cooling, and ventilation systems, upgrades for technology, all while retaining the historical look and <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original 1912 building.|$|E
5|$|Pillsbury's {{management}} {{made several}} attempts at reorganization or {{restructuring of the}} restaurant chain in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The most prominent change came in 1978 when Burger King hired McDonald's executive Donald N. Smith to help revamp the company. In a plan called Operation Phoenix, Smith initiated a restructuring of corporate business practices {{at all levels of}} the company. Changes to the company included updated franchise agreements, a broadening of the menu, and new store designs to standardize the look and <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company. While these efforts were initially effective, many of them were eventually discarded, resulting in Burger King falling into a fiscal slump that damaged the financial performance of both Burger King and its parent. Poor operating performance and ineffectual leadership continued to bog the company down for many years, even after it was acquired in 1989 by the British entertainment conglomerate Grand Metropolitan and its successor Diageo. Eventually, the institutional neglect of the brand by Diageo damaged the company to the point where major franchises were driven out of business and its total value was significantly decreased. Diageo eventually decided to divest itself of the loss-making chain and put the company up for sale in 2000.|$|E

5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{was generally}} well received by reviewers. Famitsu generally praised the gameplay elements. One reviewer found the dual screen and mid-battle save features convenient, {{even though the}} latter diluted the tension of battle. Another felt that Shadow Dragon was the best Fire Emblem title to that date. 1UP.com's Kurtis Seid enjoyed the gameplay and strategic elements surrounding character management, but said that the multiplayer options risked upsetting the balance; {{he also noted that}} the inclusion of features for newcomers might alienate hardcore fans. Tom Bramwell, writing for Eurogamer, praised the overall <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game, from the dual screen functionality to the battle and character class systems, although noted nothing that elevated the game to new heights, and said that the inclusion of newcomer-friendly mechanics clashed with the permanent death mechanic. Shiva Stella of GameSpot enjoyed the tactical elements, openness to newcomers and multiplayer elements; but found the weakness of new recruits and map restrictions detracted from the experience. IGN's Daemon Hatfield, while again noting a lack of innovation, found {{it one of the most}} balanced strategy games available at the time. Stuart Reddick of Nintendo Life greatly enjoyed the gameplay experience and praised the developer's efforts at balancing the various elements, but noted that it felt dated compared to both later Fire Emblem titles and other recent titles within the genre. Fred Dutton of Official Nintendo Magazine was highly positive, praising the classic gameplay, new features, and multiplayer functions. His one major complaint was a lack of innovation.|$|E
