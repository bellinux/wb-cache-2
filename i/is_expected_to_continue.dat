5|$|Accelerating growth {{since the}} early 2000s brought the inner urban area to roughly 260,000 {{inhabitants}} by 2014. The rapid growth <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> until at least 2030 when Aarhus municipality has set an ambitious target for 375,000 inhabitants.|$|E
50|$|Revenues from diamond {{operations}} <b>are</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{the mainstay}} of the country’s economy for the foreseeable future, although Debswana has scheduled lower production volumes. Copper, gold, nickel, and soda ash production and processing also <b>are</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> notable factors in the country’s economy.|$|R

30|$|The {{trend of}} pushing cloud {{computing}} {{to the edge}} of mobile networks <b>are</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> accelerate in years to come. According to [10] the challenges and open issues associated with MEC includes data interoperability, resource management, and orchestration, service discovery and security.|$|R
5|$|The Department of Energy {{continues}} {{to monitor the}} site {{as part of their}} remediation program. This <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> until 2025, after which the site is intended to become a restricted access wildlife preserve.|$|E
5|$|The current {{trend of}} {{enhancing}} {{security at the}} cost of passenger and baggage handling efficiency at international airports <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> in the future. This places financial burden on airports, risks the flow of servicing processes, and has implications for the privacy of passengers. International flights often require a higher level of physical security than do domestic airports, although in recent years, many countries have adopted the same level of security for both.|$|E
5|$|The {{theory of}} plate {{tectonics}} {{demonstrates that the}} continents of the Earth are moving across the surface {{at the rate of}} a few centimeters per year. This <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue,</b> causing the plates to relocate and collide. Continental drift is facilitated by two factors: the energy generation within the planet and the presence of a hydrosphere. With the loss of either of these, continental drift will come to a halt. The production of heat through radiogenic processes is sufficient to maintain mantle convection and plate subduction {{for at least the next}} 1.1 billion years.|$|E
50|$|Since the 1970s, Round Lake has {{embarked}} on an expansive annexation program. With ongoing development of those areas, Round Lake <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> grow.|$|R
50|$|Kim {{completed}} his assignment to South Korea in late October 2014 {{and returned to}} the United States, where he <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> work on diplomacy involving East Asia. Mark Lippert was sworn in to succeed Kim as ambassador on October 24, 2014, in Washington.|$|R
25|$|The FDA {{approved}} Phase 1 {{clinical trials}} on thalassemia major {{patients in the}} US for 10 participants in July. The study <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> until 2015.|$|R
5|$|Calculations for {{solution}} chemistry {{indicate that}} again, the maximum oxidation state of dubnium, +5, {{will be more}} stable than that of niobium and tantalum, and the +3 state will be less stable than those of niobium and tantalum. The propensity towards hydrolysis of cations in the highest oxidation state <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> to decrease within group 5; however, it is still expected to be quite rapid. Complexation of dubnium is expected to follow group 5 trends in its richness. Calculations for hydroxo-chlorido- complexes have been conducted; they show reversal in the trends of complex formation and extraction of group 5 elements, with dubnium being more prone to do so than tantalum.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to habitat destruction, the pygmy slow loris is seriously threatened by hunting and trade. Within its geographic range and neighbor countries, {{the trade in}} the pygmy slow loris has recently increased due to economic changes and human population growth, and the trend <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue.</b> Decreased sightings {{in the field and}} at animal markets indicate that wild populations are being depleted since the low reproduction rate of the pygmy slow loris cannot keep pace with these large-scale off-takes. Accordingly, conservationists and field biologists fear local extinctions in the near future. Between 1998 and 2006, 70% of pygmy slow lorises seized by authorities died before reaching a sheltering zoo, resulting in replacement demand and additional captures from the wild.|$|E
5|$|Understanding {{of how the}} Sun <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> {{to evolve}} {{required}} {{an understanding of the}} source of its power. Arthur Stanley Eddington's confirmation of Albert Einstein's theory of relativity led to his realisation that the Sun's energy comes from nuclear fusion reactions in its core, fusing hydrogen into helium. In 1935, Eddington went further and suggested that other elements also might form within stars. Fred Hoyle elaborated on this premise by arguing that evolved stars called red giants created many elements heavier than hydrogen and helium in their cores. When a red giant finally casts off its outer layers, these elements would then be recycled to form other star systems.|$|E
5000|$|The {{longwall}} mining {{operations at the}} mine began in 1998. [...] Extraction occurs roughly 200 metres below the surface. Operations <b>are</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> till around 2033.|$|R

5|$|One of {{the largest}} {{employers}} is the centrally located supermarket, which as of January 2006 was considering further expansion. It {{is one of the}} major attractions to the town's shopping centre, however there are fears that its expansion could lead it to become too dominant, at the cost of smaller shops in the town. Apart from tourism and retail, many jobs are also provided in the manufacturing industry, mainly located in industrial estates on the outskirts of the town, which produce goods such as kitchen furniture and factory machinery. A high number of construction jobs have been created by redevelopment of the seafront, which <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> with the proposed regeneration of the town centre. The elderly population of the town has led to many Health and Social Care jobs at local care homes and at the town's Queen Victoria Memorial Hospital. As of the 2001 census, 1.9% of the town's population resided in a medical or care establishment, compared with the national average of only 0.8%.|$|E
