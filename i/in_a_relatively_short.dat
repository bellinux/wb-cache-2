5|$|Bottom-dwelling and inactive, {{the tiger}} {{catshark}} feeds {{on a wide}} variety of fishes and invertebrates from on or near the sea floor. An oviparous species, the female retains her eggs internally until the embryos are at an advanced state of development, resulting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>short</b> hatching time after laying. Between 12 and 22 encapsulated eggs are produced at a time, which the female attaches to the bottom. The tiger catshark is caught incidentally by commercial and recreational fishers but has no economic value. It has been listed as Data Deficient by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), pending more information.|$|E

Thus, inhibition of this enzyme could be a novel approach for the therapeutic interventions of ocular inflammatory complications such as uveitis. Since AR inhibitors have already undergone phase III clinical trials for the treatment of diabetic complications and were found to be safe without any major toxicity, they could be developed as novel anti-inflammatory drugs for the prevention of uveitis complications <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>shorter</b> time...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} improve the energy {{utilization}} of rotary hearth furnace (RHF), some methods were raised to solve the problem. Through changing the inlet angle of the nozzle, a higher and more uniform temperature field can be got. Thus, the burden in the furnace can be heated to the reduction temperature <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>shorter</b> time. By using multilayer pellets technology, the energy can be utilized as much as possible. However, the top layer pellets would be reoxidized when the middle and bottom layer pellets were reduced. The average metallization of the reduced pellets get the maximum value at 25 min, {{which is consistent with}} the reality operation...|$|R
5|$|After the {{development}} of larger and faster-growing hogs (due to crosses between European and Asian breeds) in the 18th and 19th century in the United States, backyard and small-scale hog production provided an inexpensive means of converting waste food, crop waste, and garbage into calories (in a relatively small space and <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>short</b> period of time). Many of those calories {{came in the form}} of fat and rendered lard. Lard was used for almost all cooking and was a fundamental component in many common homestead foods (many that today are still regarded as holiday and comfort foods) like biscuits and pies. The economic/caloric necessity of consuming lard and other saved fats may have led to the popularity of fried foods, not only in the US, but worldwide. In the 19th century cast iron became widely available for use in cooking. The combination of flour, lard, a chicken and a heavy pan placed over a relatively controllable flame became the beginning of today's fried chicken.|$|E
5|$|In early August as the Battle of Pusan Perimeter was beginning, the Eighth United States Army ordered Lieutenant Colonel John H. McGee, {{the head}} of its G-3 Operations Miscellaneous Division, to seek volunteers for a new {{experimental}} Army Ranger unit. McGee was given only seven weeks to organize and train the unit before it was sent into combat, as commanders felt the need for Rangers was dire, and that existing soldiers could be trained as Rangers <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>short</b> period of time. Because of this limitation, volunteers were solicited only from existing Eighth Army combat units in Korea, though subsequent Ranger companies were able to recruit Ranger veterans from World War II. From the Eighth Army replacement pool, McGee recruited Second Lieutenant Ralph Puckett, newly commissioned from West Point and with no combat experience, {{to serve as the}} company commander. Second Lieutenants Charles Bunn and Barnard Cummings, Jr., became Puckett's two platoon leaders. Several hundred enlisted men volunteered from the Eighth Army, though few had combat experience. Through a quick and informal selection process, Puckett picked the men to fill out the company based on weapons qualifications, athleticism, and duty performance. There was no time to administer physical fitness tests for the applicants, and unmarried men younger than 26 were preferred. Recruits were told they would receive no hazard pay.|$|E
5|$|Once in the environment, {{neptunium}} generally oxidizes fairly quickly, {{usually to}} the +4 or +5 state. Regardless of its oxidation state, the element exhibits {{a much greater}} mobility than the other actinides, largely due to its ability to readily form aqueous solutions with various other elements. In one study comparing the diffusion rates of neptunium(V), plutonium(IV), and americium(III) in sandstone and limestone, neptunium penetrated more than ten times {{as well as the}} other elements. Np(V) will also react efficiently in pH levels greater than 5.5 if there are no carbonates present and in these conditions it has also been observed to readily bond with quartz. It has also been observed to bond well with goethite, ferric oxide colloids, and several clays including kaolinite and smectite. Np(V) does not bond as readily to soil particles in mildly acidic conditions as its fellow actinides americium and curium by nearly an order of magnitude. This behavior enables it to migrate rapidly through the soil while in solution without becoming fixed in place, contributing further to its mobility. Np(V) is also readily absorbed by concrete, which because of the element's radioactivity is a consideration that must be addressed when building nuclear waste storage facilities. When absorbed in concrete, it is reduced to Np(IV) <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>short</b> period of time. Np(V) is also reduced by humic acid if it is present on the surface of goethite, hematite, and magnetite. Np(IV) is absorbed efficiently by tuff, granodiorite, and bentonite; although uptake by the latter is most pronounced in mildly acidic conditions. It also exhibits a strong tendency to bind to colloidal particulates, an effect that is enhanced when in soil with a high clay content. The behavior provides an additional aid in the element's observed high mobility.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} new simple {{algorithm}} for efficient, and relatively accurate computation of the Faddeyeva function w(z). The algorithm carefully exploits previous approximations by Hui et al [1978] and Humlicek [1982] along with asymptotic expressions from Laplace continued fractions.

40|$|We propose an {{efficient}} heuristic algorithm for two-stage hybrid flowshop scheduling with sequence-dependent setup times.

In this study, due to practical reasons of the application that we consider, we need to obtain {{the solution of the}} problem within a reasonably short computational time, even for large-sized problems. In this study, we devise the proposed algorithm as a hybrid of two methods, that is, the beam search and NEH method, and we compare the performances with other existing local search methods. The results of the computational experiments show that the proposed algorithm solves the problems <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>shorter</b> computation time, while the scheduling performances are superior to the existing methods...|$|R

40|$|Adaptive {{learning}} is a new approach for e-learning systems. In comparison to traditional e-learning systems, which present same things for all learners, these systems automatically adapt with learner characteristics. In this paper, {{we are going to}} propose a new method for Adaptive learning, and consider adaptation from three viewpoints: 1) learner learning style, 2) learner’s knowledge level, 3) learner’s score. Due to similarity between learning objects graph and petri net, and In order to provide adaptive learning, we use an approach based on a high level petri net (HLPN). Also we propose a method to evaluate performance in this system. We compare our system with a non adaptive system, through our performance evaluating method. The results show response time for our system is less than non adaptive system and learners finish course <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>shorter</b> period of time. Since our proposed system considers individual features of learner, we can be sure that learner would not be confused in learning materials...|$|R
