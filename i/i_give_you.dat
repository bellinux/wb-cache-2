500|$|... "Nothing Really Matters" [...] {{has been}} noted as one of Madonna's most underrated singles to date. Louis Virtel from NewNowNext listed the song at number 94 on their Top 100 Madonna Songs list, stating, [...] "Copping both new-age maxims and Beatle sentiments ('Everything <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> all comes back to me'), 'Nothing Really Matters' is as queer and curious as a red patent-leather geisha costume." [...] The Gaultier kimono has been cited by several {{publications}} as one of Madonna's most notable re-inventions and looks, including fashion magazines like InStyle, Elle and Harper's Bazaar. Alongside this, the kimono has been {{recognized as one of}} the Grammy's best and worst looks.|$|E
500|$|The opening {{lines of}} [...] "XO" [...] are echo-laden and in {{contrast}} to other songs on Beyoncé, the ballad contains several hooks. Beyoncé starts the song by asking a loved one to kiss her. Some of the ascending chorus lines are call and response; Beyoncé is backed by a sing-along crowd as she sings about how her [...] "darkest nights" [...] are enlightened by the lover's face: [...] "In the darkest night hour / I search through the crowd / Your face is all that I see / <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> everything". The chorus ends with the singer adding, [...] "Baby love me, lights out", with a croak in her voice.|$|E

500|$|By January 1969, {{the single}} [...] "If I Can Dream", {{written for the}} special, reached number 12. The soundtrack album broke into the top ten.

He was out of prison, man." [...] Binder said of Presley's reaction, [...] "I played Elvis the 60-minute show, and he told me in the screening room, 'Steve, it's the greatest thing I've ever done in my life. <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> my word I will never sing a song I don't believe in.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Although Balzac did {{not draw}} {{specifically}} {{from the women}} in his life to create Valérie, parallels have been observed in some areas. The tumultuous end of his affair with Louise Breugniot and the advantage she gains from his devotion to Mme. Hanska is {{similar in some ways}} to Valérie's manipulation of Steinbock. Critics also connect the pride and anguish felt by Balzac during Mme. Hanska's pregnancy and miscarriage to the same emotions felt by Baron Hulot when Valérie conceives and loses her child. Although he never ascribed to Mme. Hanska any of the traits in Valérie's treacherous character, he felt a devotion similar to that of Hulot. He once wrote to her: [...] "je fais pour mon Eve toute les folies qu'un Hulot fait pour une Marneffe, je te donnerai mon sang, mon honneur, ma vie" [...] ("I commit for [...] all the follies that a Hulot commits for Madame Marneffe; <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> my blood, my honor, my life").|$|E
500|$|Finally, a Bedouin story {{states that}} Allah created the Arabian horse {{from the south}} wind and exclaimed, [...] "I create thee, Oh Arabian. To thy forelock, I bind Victory in battle. On thy back, I set a rich spoil and a Treasure in thy loins. I {{establish}} thee {{as one of the}} Glories of the Earth... I give thee flight without wings." [...] Other versions of the story claim Allah said to the South Wind: [...] "I want to make a creature out of you. Condense." [...] Then from the material condensed from the wind, he made a kamayt-colored animal (a bay or burnt chestnut) and said: [...] "I call you Horse; I make you Arabian and <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> the chestnut color of the ant; I have hung happiness from the forelock which hangs between your eyes; you shall be the Lord of the other animals. Men shall follow you wherever you go; you shall be as good for flight as for pursuit; you shall fly without wings; riches shall be on your back and fortune shall come through your meditation." ...|$|E

500|$|The song {{begins with}} a [...] "strange, electronic, {{slightly}} broken noise" [...] that spans between {{the start of the}} song up until 54 seconds. The ambient-influenced beginning gives the impression that [...] "Nothing Really Matters" [...] would be a ballad, but in the minute mark, it changes to a mid-tempo dance-pop song. The ambient music becomes restrained, although a cursory bleeping sound can be heard from the right to the left. The background has a number of faint strings in it, which signifies the depth of the stereo field. The chorus starts with a fast-pacing dance sound, over which Madonna sings, [...] "Nothing really matters / love is all we need / everything <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> / all comes back to me." [...] Throughout the entire song, it includes two verses, three choruses, one bridge section, and an outro. The bridge is backed by piano sounds with a descending sequence by a couple of bars. Madonna sings the same lyrics in the outro, but is slowed down and echoed longer until the music fades out.|$|E
500|$|The {{head of the}} {{household}} takes a jug of wine and pours some on the badnjak; in some regions, he may strew wheat grains over the logs. He then proposes a toast: [...] "Grant, O God, that there be health and joy in this home, that our grain and grapevines yield well, that children be born healthy to us, that our property increase in the field, pen, and barn!" [...] or, [...] "Hail, badnjak, veseljak! <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> wheat and wine, and you give me every good thing and peace!" [...] or similar. The name veseljak, literally [...] "jovial one", is used along with badnjak in some areas. The head drinks a draught of wine from the jug, after which it is passed to other members of household. In the clan of Kuči, wine is poured on the [...] "beard" [...] of the badnjak, and then a little girl sits for a moment on the log—for the well-being of the cattle. Christmas Eve dinner follows, which traditionally includes a round loaf of unleavened bread, beans, fish, walnuts, honey, and red wine. The bread is not cut with a knife, but broken with hands.|$|E
500|$|Delft, {{captured}} {{in the early stages}} of the battle, was under the command of the Dutch Lieutenant Heilberg and the British Lieutenant Charles Bullen, with a small prize crew of 69 men. Ninety-three Dutch prisoners had been removed, and among the remaining Dutch sailors were 76 wounded men. As the gale intensified, it rapidly became clear that despite a tow line attached from Veteran the ship would never reach Britain, and a large board was raised on deck with the chalked message [...] "The ship is sinking". Reacting at once, boats from nearby ships organised an evacuation and began loading the Dutch prisoners for transfer to more seaworthy vessels. Bullen offered a place in the first rescue boat, from Veteran, to Heilberg, but the Dutch officer refused, gesturing to the immobile wounded who had been brought onto the maindeck as the lower decks had flooded and replying [...] "But how can I leave these men?". In response, Bullen cried out [...] "God bless you, my brave fellow! Here is my hand; <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> my word I will stay her with you!". The prize crew left on the second rescue boat sent from Russell, and Bullen and Heilberg waited for a third trip to bring them off with the remaining 30 wounded men and three junior Dutch officers who had also elected to stay. Before further help could arrive, however, Delft suddenly foundered, Bullen and Heilberg throwing themselves clear as the ship sank. Both were seen in the water but only Bullen reached safety, swimming to Monmouth alone.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Party" [...] {{features}} Beyoncé as {{the female}} protagonist [...] "in {{the mood for}} some loving" [...] as she references to a get-together for two persons. West rhymes about [...] "swag sauce" [...] and [...] "swagu" [...] in the introductory lines, [...] "You a bad girl, your friends bad too / You got the swag sauce, you're drippin' Swagu", before passing the torch to Beyoncé, who begins to sing the first verse slowly and steadily, [...] "I may be young but I'm ready / To give you all my love / I told my girls {{you can get it}} / Don't slow it down, just let it go / So in love / I'll give it all away / Just don't tell nobody tomorrow". In the chorus lines, she harmonizes over the sample from [...] "La Di Da Di", [...] "Cause tonight's the night that <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> everything / Music knocking until the morning light / 'Cause we like to party". In the second verse, Beyoncé belts out [...] "in a thick stack of smooth, layered vocals". After chanting the chorus for a second time, André 3000 surfaces around the 2:15 mark with [...] "some very naughty references" [...] to milk on the verses he raps, [...] "... another homeboy, that nigga named Cheese / Fuck wit' me baby, I make it milk 'til it drip down yo' knees", before switching gears altogether and getting philosophical about his own career, [...] "Kiddo say he looks up to me, this just makes me feel old / Never thought that we could become someone else's hero / Man, we were just in the food court eating our gyros", and finally adopting a [...] "multi-syllabic tongue twister" [...] to rap some of the finishing lines. The song runs out with Beyoncé reiterating the lines, [...] "Cause we like to party, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey", and West then [...] reprises the opening lines.|$|E
