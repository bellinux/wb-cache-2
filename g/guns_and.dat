5|$|Autocannons {{are often}} found in aircraft, where they {{replaced}} machine <b>guns</b> <b>and</b> as shipboard anti-aircraft weapons, as they provide greater destructive power than machine guns.|$|E
5|$|Dubourdieu (as commodore) led a {{squadron}} consisting of six frigates (four of 40 <b>guns</b> <b>and</b> two of 32 guns), a 16-gun brig, two schooners, one xebec, and two gunboats. Three of his ships {{were from the}} French Navy, and the others from the Navy of the Kingdom of Italy. In addition the squadron carried 500 Italian soldiers. In the absence of Montagu, Hoste's squadron consisted of three frigates (one of 38 <b>guns</b> <b>and</b> two of 32 <b>guns)</b> <b>and</b> one 22-gun post ship. The island of Lissa itself was defended by {{a small number of}} local troops under the command of two midshipmen.|$|E

50|$|Accident {{statistics}} {{are hard to}} obtain, but much data {{is available on the}} issue of <b>gun</b> ownership <b>and</b> <b>gun</b> related deaths. The United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute (UNICRI) has made comparisons between countries with different levels of <b>gun</b> ownership <b>and</b> investigated the correlation between <b>gun</b> ownership levels <b>and</b> <b>gun</b> homicides, <b>and</b> between <b>gun</b> ownership levels <b>and</b> <b>gun</b> suicides. A strong correlation is seen in both.|$|R

5|$|The 1st Bn., 24th Aviation Reg {{destroyed}} 32 Iraqi tanks, 49 BMPs, 37 trucks, 8 Frog Missile launchers, {{numerous other}} assorted artillery pieces, anti-aircraft <b>guns,</b> <b>and</b> support vehicles.|$|E
5|$|The Ottoman Army {{lost over}} 1,000 {{casualties}} and 750 prisoners; the British infantry captured 24 machine <b>guns</b> <b>and</b> three automatic rifles.|$|E
5|$|These three {{divisions}} {{were supported}} by the 116 guns of the Ottoman XXII Corps artillery, six large naval <b>guns</b> <b>and</b> several batteries of 150mm howitzers.|$|E
50|$|Filyaw {{was five}} miles from his house, {{carrying}} a taser, pellet <b>gun,</b> <b>and</b> knife, when he was arrested. He was charged with kidnapping, possession of an incendiary device (a flare <b>gun),</b> <b>and</b> impersonating a police officer, with other charges pending.|$|R
50|$|As built, {{they were}} armed with one 8 in 68-pounder (87cwt) muzzle-loading smoothbore <b>gun</b> <b>and</b> two 24-pounder howitzers.

50|$|Unfortunately {{the system}} needed two {{high-voltage}} power supplies, {{one for the}} initial acceleration in the <b>gun,</b> <b>and</b> a second between the <b>gun</b> <b>and</b> the reflector. And, due {{to the way it}} worked, the system was generally limited to milliwatts of power.|$|R
5|$|This {{armament}} {{was identical}} to that on the preceding , {{with the exception of}} ammunition stores. The Roon-class ships carried 380 shells for the main battery, 1,600 rounds for the 15cm <b>guns,</b> <b>and</b> 2,100 shells for the 8.8cm guns. The planned conversion for Roon to a seaplane carrier called for six 15cm L/45 <b>guns</b> <b>and</b> six 8.8cm Flak guns, with 2,400 rounds, though this was never carried out.|$|E
5|$|A gun {{emplacement}} is {{a position}} or platform specially prepared to support large heavy <b>guns</b> <b>and</b> artillery. The first type of gun put on Fort Pasir Panjang was the 7-inch Rifled Muzzle-Loading (R.M.L.). Two of these guns were first installed in 1878 {{so as to}} provide a temporary defence for the fort. They were, however, removed soon after.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} Maratha gunners who had feigned death when the British {{advanced}} over their position re-manned their <b>guns</b> <b>and</b> began to pour cannon fire {{into the rear}} of the 74th and Madras infantry. Wellesley ordered his four sepoy battalions to re-form and ward off any threat from the Maratha infantry and cavalry while the 78th were sent back to retake the Maratha gun line. Wellesley, meanwhile, galloped back to 7th Madras Native Cavalry, which had been held back in reserve to the east, and led a cavalry charge from the opposite direction. The gunners again stood their ground but were eventually driven from their <b>guns</b> <b>and</b> this time it was ensured that all those who remained were dead.|$|E
50|$|In 1899 the 250mm <b>gun</b> <b>and</b> two 150mm <b>guns</b> were removed, <b>and</b> the {{remainder}} artillery was redistributed.|$|R
25|$|The Leclerc is also {{equipped}} with a 12.7mm coaxial machine <b>gun</b> <b>and</b> a remote-controlled 7.62mm machine gun, whereas most other NATO tanks use 7.62mm weapons for both their coaxial <b>and</b> top machine <b>gun</b> mounts; the major exception is the American M1 Abrams, which has a 7.62mm coaxial machine <b>gun</b> <b>and</b> two top-mounted machine <b>guns,</b> one 7.62mm <b>and</b> one 12.7mm.|$|R

5|$|After {{the start}} of the Second World War in September, {{construction}} continued desultorily until October when it was suspended by the Admiralty for one year to release labour and material for escorts needed to protect merchant convoys. Construction of the 16-inch <b>guns</b> <b>and</b> their turrets was to continue, however. The question was raised again on 12 November 1940 and the decision to suspend construction was reaffirmed. All three ships ordered were cancelled in 1942, but Lions keel was not scrapped until {{after the end of the}} war. Only four 16-inch <b>guns,</b> <b>and</b> no turrets, were ever completed.|$|E
5|$|Although {{an earlier}} {{organization}} included a divisional anti-tank battalion (two companies of 37mm <b>guns</b> <b>and</b> one company of 75 mm guns), in December 1941 these AT battalions {{were removed from}} the divisional structure and reorganized as independent tank destroyer battalions; their towed guns were replaced with self-propelled ones as soon as the latter became available.|$|E
5|$|An early-war Army {{anti-aircraft}} company (Flugabwehr-Kompanie) {{was organized}} in three platoons {{with a total}} of eighteen Sd.Kfz. 10/4s, twelve with <b>guns</b> <b>and</b> six carrying ammunition. When the four-barrel 2 cm Flakvierling 38 was fielded in 1941 each platoon had four Sd.Kfz. 10/4s towing the <b>guns</b> <b>and</b> another for ammunition. Later these companies were reorganized {{with a total of}} eight Sd.Kfz. 10/4s carrying guns, two towing Flakvierlings and three carrying ammunition. These are just examples of some of the Army organizations which differed depending on the unit and the period. Sd.Kfz. 10/5s were substituted for 10/4s on a one for one basis. Detailed records do not survive for the Luftwaffe light anti-aircraft units, but they appear to have been organized into batteries of nine or twelve guns.|$|E
50|$|Battle for the Pacific {{features}} a single player campaign and a multiplayer mode with a decent number of weapons to choose from, {{ranging from the}} American Thompson submachine <b>gun</b> <b>and</b> M1 Garand rifle to the Japanese Type 100 submachine <b>gun</b> <b>and</b> Type 38 carbine.|$|R
50|$|Ferret {{was armed}} with one 12-pounder <b>gun</b> <b>and</b> two bow torpedo tubes. Later {{in her career}} she was fitted out for boom {{breaking}} as an experiment. Her forebridge, <b>gun</b> <b>and</b> bow tube were removed and the turtle backed forecastle was strengthened for this purpose.|$|R
50|$|Shortly before World War I, Gor was rebuilt as a mine layer. During this rebuild, {{the heavy}} <b>gun</b> <b>and</b> {{one of the}} 37 mm guns was {{replaced}} with two more potent 76 mm guns. Since the heavy <b>gun</b> <b>and</b> ammunition was removed, Gor could carry 55 mines.|$|R
5|$|Andrianjaka {{moved his}} capital from Ambohidrabiby to Ambohimanga upon {{ascending}} {{to the throne}} around 1610 or 1612. He was reportedly the first Merina leader to receive Europeans around 1620 and traded slaves in exchange for <b>guns</b> <b>and</b> other firearms {{to aid in the}} pacification of rival principalities, obtaining 50 <b>guns</b> <b>and</b> three barrels of gunpowder to equip his army. He unified the principalities on what he later designated as the twelve sacred hills of Imerina at Ambohitratrimo, Ambohimanga, Ilafy, Alasora, Antsahadita, Ambohimanambony, Analamanga, Ambohitrabiby, Namehana, Ambohidrapeto, Ambohijafy and Ambohimandranjaka. These hills became and remain the spiritual heart of Imerina, which was further expanded over a century later when Andrianampoinimerina redesignated the twelve sacred hills to include several different sites.|$|E
5|$|At 18:35, {{although}} Meldrum {{believed they}} {{could at least}} hold where they were, the regiment was ordered by Chetwode to withdraw. At 19:00 horse teams arrived to recover the <b>guns,</b> <b>and</b> at 19:45 they slowly retired back to the suburbs of Gaza. At 21:40 they rejoined the brigade and left the town. The next morning at 08:30 they arrived at Deir El Belah, where the division was now located. Casualties during the battle had again been rather light, at one dead and nineteen wounded. They had captured 197 prisoners, {{as well as the}} <b>guns</b> <b>and</b> field hospital.|$|E
5|$|By the 1890s, the castle's defences {{had become}} {{obsolete}} once again {{due to the}} development of torpedo boats and superior breech-loading guns. In response, five 6-pounder quick-firing <b>guns</b> <b>and</b> searchlights were installed to deal with the torpedo boat threat and, between 1899 and 1901, the east battery was converted to hold breech-loading guns at a cost of £16,670.|$|E
50|$|Since the Tortoise had a fixed casemate {{superstructure}} {{instead of}} a turret, it can be classified as a self-propelled gun or an assault <b>gun</b> <b>and</b> not a tank. The crew included a commander, driver, and gunner, with two loaders for the 32-pounder <b>gun</b> <b>and</b> two machine gunners.|$|R
50|$|The Leclerc is also {{equipped}} with a 12.7 mm coaxial machine <b>gun</b> <b>and</b> a remote-controlled 7.62mm machine gun, whereas most other NATO tanks use 7.62mm weapons for both their coaxial <b>and</b> top machine <b>gun</b> mounts; the major exception is the American M1 Abrams, which has a 7.62mm coaxial machine <b>gun</b> <b>and</b> two top-mounted machine <b>guns,</b> one 7.62mm <b>and</b> one 12.7mm.|$|R
