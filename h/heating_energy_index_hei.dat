The proposed criterion, based on the concept of <b>energy</b> harvest <b>index</b> (<b>HEI),</b> measures the capability of a storage system to capture renewable energy. The overall efficiency of the CAES system and optimum control and design from the technical and economic point of view is presented. A possible application of this idea is an isolated community with significant wind energy resource. A case study reveals the usefulness of the proposed criterion in design, control and implementation of a small CAES system in a hybrid power system (HPM) for an isolated community. <b>Energy</b> harvested <b>index</b> and its effectiveness in increasing the wind penetration rate in the total energy production is discussed...|$|R
