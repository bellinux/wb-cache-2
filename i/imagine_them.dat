5|$|In the manga The Saga of Darren Shan, the titular {{character}} is fascinated by spiders. He kept them as pets until he killed {{one that he}} got when he was nine years old. He used {{to let them go}} into his mouth and he'd <b>imagine</b> <b>them</b> eating him from the inside out. Normally, the spiders would stay with him for about a day or two, but some lasted longer. Later on, we find out that he can communicate with spiders.|$|E
500|$|The game's visuals and {{atmosphere}} received similar praise. GameSpot reviewer Kevin VanOrd remarked that Mass Effect 2 is more detailed and darker than its predecessor. He wrote that [...] "deep reds and glowing indigos saturate certain scenes, making them {{richer and more}} sinister; eerie fog limits your vision in one side mission, while rain pours down upon you in another. Subtle, moody lighting gives certain interactions great impact." [...] Reviewer Adriaan den Ouden of RPGamer credited the conversations and cutscenes for being better shot than the first game, stating that [...] "it's hard to <b>imagine</b> <b>them</b> becoming much better in Mass Effect 3". Critics also gave high marks to the game's extensive cast of voices, in particular Martin Sheen's performance of the Illusive Man, which was singled out for [...] "steal the show". Andrew Reiner, writing for Game Informer, opined that the music [...] "flows beautifully" [...] in both the story and action sequences. The game's presentation and direction were considered [...] "miles ahead of the competition".|$|E
500|$|A Hollywood executive, not {{involved}} with the film, felt it succeeded because it [...] "has a self-deprecating tone that’s riotous. It’s never been done before. It’s poking fun at Marvel. That label takes itself so seriously; can you <b>imagine</b> <b>them</b> making fun of themselves in a movie?" [...] James Gunn, director of Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, refuted this and said Deadpool was a success because [...] "it’s original, it’s damn good ... and it wasn’t afraid to take risks". Gunn hoped studios would learn [...] "the right lesson" [...] from the film and not just try to make more films [...] "like Deadpool". After Fox's Logan (2017) also became a success, Forbes Paul Tassi reiterated Gunn's sentiments, saying the rating was [...] "appropriate given the 'adult' nature of these two heroes", but [...] "too much stock is being put into unrestrained violence rather than people examining what actually makes these movies work". Graeme McMillan at The Hollywood Reporter concurred, adding, [...] "Why not take the freedom that comes from that rating and try to re-approach the mainstream genre with that attitude?" ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{finishing}} Vernon, Florida, Morris {{tried unsuccessfully}} to get funding {{for a variety of}} projects. There was Road, a story about an interstate highway in Minnesota; a project about Robert Golka, the creator of laser-induced fireballs in Utah; and the story of Centralia, Pennsylvania, the coal town in which an inextinguishable subterranean fire ignited in 1962. He eventually got funding in 1983 to write a script about John and Jim Pardue, a pair of Missouri bank robbers who had killed their father and grandmother and robbed five banks. Morris's pitch went, [...] "The great bank-robbery sprees always take place at a time when something is going wrong in the country. Bonnie and Clyde were apolitical, but it's impossible to <b>imagine</b> <b>them</b> without the Depression as a back-drop. The Pardue brothers were apolitical, but it's impossible to <b>imagine</b> <b>them</b> without Vietnam." [...] Morris wanted Tom Waits and Mickey Rourke to play the brothers, and he wrote the script, but the project eventually failed. Morris worked on writing scripts for various other projects, including a pair of ill-fated Stephen King adaptations.|$|E
2500|$|The {{vacuum state}} of the [...] "free" [...] {{electromagnetic}} field (that with no sources) {{is defined as the}} ground state in which [...] for all modes [...] The vacuum state, like all stationary states of the field, is an eigen{{state of the}} Hamiltonian but not the electric and magnetic field operators. In the vacuum state, therefore, the electric and magnetic fields do not have definite values. We can <b>imagine</b> <b>them</b> to be fluctuating about their mean value of zero.|$|E

2500|$|When {{asked in}} August 2017 about a {{possible}} reunion with a classic Savatage lineup (with Chris Caffery filling in for the late Criss Oliva on guitar), original drummer Steve [...] "Doc" [...] Wacholz mentioned a Savatage tour taking place in 2018. However, he stated, [...] "I really can't <b>imagine</b> <b>them</b> having TWO drummers on stage, so Jeff will be doing the drumming duties on his own (which he does a great job), although I would love to finish what I started with the Oliva's so long ago. That {{would be a great}} accomplishment, but I do not see it happening." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "No one on {{this earth}} can avoid affliction; and {{although}} the afflictions which the Lord sends are not great men <b>imagine</b> <b>them</b> beyond their strength and are crushed by them. This is because they will not humble their souls and commit themselves {{to the will of}} God. But the Lord Himself guides with His grace those who are given over to God's will, and they bear all things with fortitude for the sake of God Whom they have so loved and with Whom they are glorified for ever. It is impossible to escape tribulation in this world but the man who is given over to the will of God bears tribulation easily, seeing it but putting his trust in the Lord, and so his tribulations pass." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{boxes were}} draped with {{cardinal}} silk plush curtains, lined with gold, and trimmed with lace. [...] In {{the center of}} the proscenium arch one beheld a portrait of William Shakespeare and above this portrait against a light-blue background was [...] "a group of cherubs, gracefully posed, representing music and the drama." [...] Surrounding the main chandelier in the auditorium were more [...] "cunning little cherubs" [...] trailing garlands of flowers. [...] In the words of the Coldwater Republican, [...] "The delicate coloring of the background brings out the figures in strong relief so one may almost <b>imagine</b> <b>them</b> floating in space and inhale the odor of their fragrant burden." [...] The cove around the auditorium also was decorated with [...] "vases of flowers, bouquets and conventional vines and figures." [...] L. B. Chevelier, who painted many of the stage's backdrops, was the artistic genius behind such beautiful creations.|$|E
50|$|The Lazarus Long set {{of books}} involve time travel, {{parallel}} dimensions, free love, individualism, and {{a concept that}} Heinlein named World as Myth—the theory that universes are created by the act of <b>imagining</b> <b>them,</b> such that even fictional worlds are real.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{must leave}} him here till morning," [...] said Phil, {{replacing}} the stone. [...] "He hasn't mewed for five minutes. Perhaps the mews we heard were his dying groan. Or perhaps we merely <b>imagined</b> <b>them,</b> under {{the strain of}} our guilty consciences." ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{original}} {{concept of}} the kender held that they were [...] "savage, warrior children, ever curious, ever alert." [...] This concept was altered dramatically when Janet Pack became involved in dramatic readings of the works, as Pack's personal characteristics had a strong impact on how {{those involved in the}} process viewed the kender. According to Jeff Grubb, she, [...] "and as a result all kender since her, was cute. Extremely cute. Sweetly, lovably, frustratingly cute.... And it's hard, after seeing Janet play Tas, to <b>imagine</b> <b>them</b> any other way." [...] Two of the other key characteristics of kender—their curiosity and kleptomania—were introduced by Hickman. Hickman was uncomfortable with the notion of a [...] "race of thieves" [...] in his games, but still wanted the skills typically associated with thieves, so he added their [...] "innocent tendency to 'borrow' things for indeterminate periods of time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nothing Personal was {{met with}} mixed-to-positive reviews. AbsolutePunk {{reviewer}} Drew Beringer praised the album for its [...] "massive hooks" [...] and complimented the [...] "nature of the lyrics". He also noted a few flaws on the album, saying [...] "Hello, Brooklyn" [...] is an [...] "awful song" [...] and [...] "Too Much" [...] is everything that the title implies. He closed by saying, [...] "the rest of 2009 is {{shaping up to be}} All Time Low’s year". Alternative Press, commenting on the album's first single, said [...] "'Weightless' is an insta-classic." [...] However, the reviewer was disappointed in the producers for their use of Auto-Tune, saying [...] "This boy (Gaskarth) can sing, let him already." [...] The article also contradicted AbsolutePunk's view of the song [...] "Too Much", saying it [...] "is a remarkable progression for the quartet: a slow, electronic-tinged number". The Washington Post was also hugely favorable of the album. Reviewer Nancy Dunham said: [...] "The songs on Nothing Personal are what pop-punk is all about -- or should be, anyway." [...] She felt the album [...] "will likely gain the band plenty of media and popular attention" [...] and that [...] "the album's 12 tunes are so jaunty and their lyrics about first love, betrayal and parties so angst-filled you can easily <b>imagine</b> <b>them</b> playing in the background of the TV shows The Hills or 90210".|$|E
6000|$|... "Nor I," [...] said Mrs. Blythe. [...] "I hate {{going to}} bed now. All my life I've liked {{going to bed}}, to have a gay, mad, splendid half-hour of imagining things before sleeping. Now I <b>imagine</b> <b>them</b> still. But such {{different}} things." ...|$|E
5|$|The {{courage and}} obstinacy {{with which the}} Americans fought were the astonishment of everyone, and we now became fully {{convinced}} {{that they are not}} that contemptible enemy we had hitherto <b>imagined</b> <b>them,</b> incapable of standing a regular engagement and that they would only fight behind strong and powerful works.|$|R
5000|$|At 13, Howard, {{being of}} Scottish-Irish descent, began his studies of Scottish history and became fascinated {{with what he}} calls [...] "the small dark Mediterranean aborigines of Britain."

6000|$|... "I don't know, Mr. Darnay; I {{told you}} it was a foolish fancy, but you asked for it. When I have yielded myself to it, I have been alone, and then I have <b>imagined</b> <b>them</b> the {{footsteps}} {{of the people who are}} to come into my life, and my father's." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{believe they}} have sense enough to think of that," [...] said her husband. [...] "The curse of their origin is on them, I suppose. I tried to <b>imagine</b> <b>them</b> when I was only fit to imagine a man hating a woman with all his might." ...|$|E

50|$|Lauscha is {{the setting}} for the novel The Glassblower by Petra Durst-Benning (originally {{published}} in German in 2003).

60|$|He was {{challenged}} {{over and over}} again in the same way, and so were his friends who were carrying papa and maman and the children; but they were always ready with a reply, ready with an invective or a curse; with eyes that could not see, one could <b>imagine</b> <b>them</b> as hideous, as vengeful, as cruel as the rest of the crowd.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{answered}} MacShaughnassy, [...] "if one {{admits the}} possibility of spirits retaining any interest {{in the affairs of}} this world at all, it is certainly more reasonable to <b>imagine</b> <b>them</b> engaged upon a task such as you suggest, than to believe that they occupy themselves with the performance of mere drawing-room tricks.

5000|$|There is no {{standard}} {{description of}} the appearance of kallikantzaroi; there are regional variations as to how their appearance is described. Some Greeks have <b>imagined</b> <b>them</b> with some animal parts, such as hairy bodies, horse legs, or boar tusks. Sometimes they are enormous, at other times diminutive. Others see them as humans of small size that smell horrible. They are predominantly male, often with protruding sexual characteristics. [...] Many Greeks have <b>imagined</b> <b>them</b> as tall, black and hairy, with burning red eyes, goats' or donkeys' ears, monkeys' arms, tongues that hang out and heads that are huge. Nonetheless, the most common belief {{is that they are}} small, black creatures, humanoid apart from their long black tails, and said to resemble little black devils. They are also mostly blind, speak with a lisp and love to eat frogs, worms, and other small creatures.|$|R
