Slaughter's New York's 28th congressional district was 29 percent African American, and minorities comprised nearly 40 percent of the Democratic primary vote. Charles B.

50|$|The {{federal agency}} {{overseeing}} the project inventories the project area (or contracts with a qualified consultant) {{to determine the}} presence or absence of historic properties. They then submit to the SHPO a Determination of Effect/Finding of Effect (DOE/FOE) outlining to the SHPO the project, the efforts taken identify historic properties, and what effects, if any, the project may have on historic properties. If the project is believed to have no adverse effect on eligible historic resources and the SHPO and other <b>consulting</b> <b>parties</b> agree, then the Section 106 process is effectively closed and the project may proceed. Alternatively, if an adverse effect is expected, the agency is required to work with the local State Historic Preservation Office to ensure that all interested parties are given an opportunity to review the proposed work and provide comments. This step seeks ways for the project to avoid having an adverse effect on historic properties. Ideally, a Memorandum of Agreement is reached between all <b>consulting</b> <b>parties</b> outlining agreed to mitigation or avoidance of historic properties, but this is not always the case. Without this process historical properties would lose a significant protection. This process helps decide different approaches and solutions to the project, but does not prevent any site from demolition or alteration.|$|R

The branch chairmen of UKIP were canvassed on their opinion regarding Kilroy-Silk's challenge for the party leadership. Only a minority (13%) were sympathetic to him; Kilroy-Silk did not think this was significant, as he believed that too few party members had been <b>consulted.</b> <b>Party</b> officials threatened him with disciplinary action if he continued his challenge.|$|R

The typical Section 106 Review involves four primary steps: 1 - Initiation of the Section 106 Review; 2 - Identification of Historic Properties; 3 - Assessment of Adverse Effects; and 4 - Resolution of Adverse Effects. Further steps may be required if there is a disagreement among the <b>consulting</b> <b>parties</b> on adverse effects or the resolution of the effects.|$|R

5|$|Sherman's {{financial}} expertise and {{his friendship with}} Hayes made him a natural choice for Treasury Secretary in 1877. Like Grant before him, Hayes had not <b>consulted</b> <b>party</b> leaders about his cabinet appointments, and the Senate took the then-unusual step of referring {{all of them to}} committee. Two days later, senators approved Sherman's nomination after an hour of debate, and he began lobbying his former colleagues to approve the other nominations, which they eventually did. Hayes and Sherman became close friends in the next four years, taking regular carriage rides together to discuss matters of state in private. In the Treasury, as in the Senate, Sherman was confronted with two tasks: first, to prepare for specie resumption when it took effect in 1879; second, to deal with the backlash against the diminution of silver coinage.|$|R

50|$|The {{procedure}} of investing a new Government is {{initiated by the}} President, who designates a candidate {{to the office of}} Prime Minister after <b>consulting</b> the <b>party</b> which <b>holds</b> a majority of seats in Parliament. If no such majority exists, the President <b>consults</b> all the <b>parties</b> represented in Parliament. Once nominated, the candidate establishes a list of members and a government platform; this is to be done in 10 days. The 10-day interval is not a strict deadline, rather it represents the time period deemed optimal to establish a competent legal Government. The expiry of this interval allows the President to revoke the candidate and designate a new one, though this is not mandatory.|$|R

500|$|After his nomination, Garfield {{met with}} party leaders {{in an attempt}} to heal the schism between the Stalwarts and Half-Breeds. In his formal letter to the party {{accepting}} his nomination, written with advice from party leaders, he endorsed the ideas of high tariffs and sound money, but drew particular attention to the issues of Chinese immigration and civil service reform. On both, Garfield sought a moderate path. He called for some restrictions on the former, through treaty renegotiation with the Chinese government. He straddled the divide on civil service reform, saying that he agreed with the concept, while promising to make no appointments without <b>consulting</b> <b>party</b> leaders, a position 20th-century biographer Allan Peskin called [...] "inconsistent". As was traditional at the time, Garfield conducted a [...] "front porch campaign", returning to his home {{for the duration of the}} contest, and leaving the actual campaigning to surrogates.|$|R
