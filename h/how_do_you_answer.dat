Before reading this article further, give yourself a few moments to reflect on this question: “What for you is the best and most special about teaching Religious Education?” <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>answer</b> the question?

Did you reach for the instant cynical remark, “When I finished teaching the class!” Or, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> imagine yourself taking great pride in accomplishing deeper understandings among your students? Maybe your response was one of mixed feelings. These responses are important because the disposition of a teacher towards his or her RE teaching is a key factor in the quality of Religious Education provided to secondary students in Catholic schools.

40|$|I {{have three}} times {{returned}} to New Zealand after spells of 3 - 10 years overseas. Each time I {{have found the}} transition to New Zealand life very difficult- and each has been more difficult than the time before. Speaking with others in similar situations has revealed similar difficulties. In fact, I have been distressed to hear about more serious problems- one friend who has given up on church, even perhaps on God; another who has left her husband; several who has experienced severe depression or burnout. I have found that spiritual direction has helped me in my latest re-entry. I undertook this research project {{in the hope that}} it would help spiritual directors to better understand and minister to returning missionaries. Research Method I explored some of the literature on re-entry and interviewed a number of missionaries and spiritual directors.

"Well, {{here is the}} {{unfilled}} {{duplicate of}} the blank which the Oakland hospital people sent to you by {{the hand of the}} sick-nurse when she came here to nurse your little nephew through his dangerous illness. This blank asks all manner of questions as to the conduct of that sick-nurse: 'Did she ever sleep on her watch? Did she ever forget to give the medicine?' and so forth and so on. You are warned to be very careful and explicit in your answers, for the welfare of the service requires that the nurses be promptly fined or otherwise punished for derelictions. You told me you were perfectly delighted with that nurse--that she had a thousand perfections and only one fault: you found you never could depend on her wrapping Johnny up half sufficiently while he waited in a chilly chair for her to rearrange the warm bed. You filled up the duplicate of this paper, and sent it back to the hospital by the hand of the nurse. <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>answer</b> this question--'Was the nurse at any time guilty of a negligence which was likely to result in the patient's taking cold?' Come--everything is decided by a bet here in California: ten dollars to ten cents you lied when <b>you</b> <b>answered</b> that question." [...] She said, [...] "I didn't; I left it blank!" [...] "Just so--you have told a silent lie; you have left it to be inferred that you had no fault to find in that matter." [...] She said, [...] "Oh, was that a lie? And how could I mention her one single fault, and she so good?--it would have been cruel." [...] I said, [...] "One ought always to lie when one can do good by it; your impulse was right, but, your judgment was crude; this comes of unintelligent practice. Now observe the result of this inexpert deflection of yours. You know Mr. Jones's Willie is lying very low with scarlet fever; well, your recommendation was so enthusiastic that that girl is there nursing him, and the worn-out family have all been trustingly sound asleep for the last fourteen hours, leaving their darling with full confidence in those fatal hands, because you, like young George Washington, have a reputa--However, if {{you are not going to}} have anything to do, I will come around to-morrow and we'll attend the funeral together, for, of course, you'll naturally feel a peculiar interest in Willie's case--as personal a one, in fact, as the undertaker." ...|$|R
40|$|The D-Wave is an {{adiabatic}} quantum computer. It is {{an understatement}} {{to say that it}} is not a traditional computer. It can be viewed as a computational accelerator or more precisely a computational oracle, where one asks it a relevant question and it returns a useful answer. The question is <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> ask a relevant question and <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> use the <b>answer</b> it returns. This paper addresses these issues in a way that is pertinent to machine learning. A Boltzmann machine is implemented with the D-Wave since the D-Wave is merely a hardware instantiation of a partially connected Boltzmann machine. This paper presents a prototype implementation of a 3 -layered neural network where the D-Wave is used as the middle (hidden) layer of the neural network. This paper also explains how the D-Wave can be utilized in a multi-layer neural network (more than 3 layers) and one in which each layer may be multiple times the size of the D-Wave being used...|$|R

What do we want with a {{carriage}} to drive out in, and champagne on the table, and a footman to answer the door? We want {{to love each other}} and be happy. There are thousands of as good gentlemen as I am, in England, with wives and families, who would ask for nothing better than an income of five hundred a year. The fact is, Mr. Farnaby, you're positively saturated with the love of money. Get your New Testament and read what Christ says of rich people.' What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> think he <b>did,</b> when I put it in that unanswerable way? He held up his hand, and looked horrified. 'I can't allow profanity in my office,' says he. 'I have my New Testament read to me in church, sir, every Sunday.' That's the sort of Christian, Rufus, who is the average product of modern times! He was as obstinate as a mule; he wouldn't give way a single inch. His adopted daughter, he said, was accustomed to live in a certain style. In that same style she should live when she was married, so long as he had a voice in the matter. Of course, if she chose to set his wishes and feelings at defiance, in return for all that he had done for her, she was old enough to take her own way. In that case, he would tell me as plainly as he meant to tell her, that she must not look to a single farthing of his money to help her, and not expect to find her name down in his will. He felt the honour of a family alliance with me as sincerely as ever. But he must abide by the conditions that he had stated. On those terms, he would be proud to give me the hand of Regina at the altar, and proud to feel that he had done his duty by his adopted child. I let him go on till he had run himself out--and then I asked quietly, if he could tell me the way to increase my income to two thousand a year. <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> think he <b>answered</b> me?" ...|$|R
