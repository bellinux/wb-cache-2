5|$|Dot {{has been}} {{generally}} well received by critics; she <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> {{as a cultural}} archetype and Brown has won multiple awards for her portrayal. However, aspects of the character such as her smoking and her religious beliefs have been criticised, with religious groups suggesting Dot's faith is used in a pejorative manner. The character has also made an impact on popular culture; she has been spoofed, most notably by Alistair McGowan, and has been credited as inspiration for catwalk collections.|$|E

5|$|Melatonin is a {{powerful}} antioxidant. Melatonin easily crosses cell membranes and the blood–brain barrier. Unlike other antioxidants, melatonin does not undergo redox cycling, which {{is the ability of}} a molecule to undergo repeated reduction and oxidation. Redox cycling may allow other antioxidants (such as vitamin C) to act as pro-oxidants and promote free radical formation. Melatonin, once oxidized, cannot be reduced to its former state because it forms several stable end-products upon reacting with free radicals. Therefore, it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> as a terminal (or suicidal) antioxidant.|$|E
5|$|Oguchi's ensemble, Osuwa Daiko, {{incorporated}} these alterations {{and other}} drums into their performances. They also devised novel pieces that were intended for non-religious performances.

Oedo Sukeroku Daiko {{was formed in}} Tokyo in 1959 under Seidō Kobayashi, and <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> as the first taiko group who toured professionally.

Daniel Craig's part in particular <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> as his breakthrough role. It was also a controversial production, as its stories were partly based on real people and events. Several years passed before it was adapted from a play, performed by the Royal Shakespeare Company, to a television drama, {{due in part to}} the BBC's fear of litigation.|$|E
5|$|The Tribunal {{consists}} of {{not less than}} three judges of the Supreme Court. Its opinions are binding on all other courts.

The Tribunal determined in 1995 that although Article 5(2A) was not in force, Article 22H(1) did not prevent Parliament from restricting the President's discretionary powers through a constitutional amendment. Since then, {{there have been several}} unsuccessful attempts to persuade Cabinet to invoke the Article 100 procedure.|$|E
5|$|The fungus, first {{documented}} by naturalist John Burton Cleland {{in the early}} 20th century, was initially assumed to be the close relative Macrolepiota procera, a European species now known to be absent from Australia. Australian mycologist Cheryl Grgurinovic recognized Cleland's collections as a distinct species, officially describing it in 1997. The fungus <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> by several names: M.konradii, M.gracilenta, and M.mastoidea. Else Vellinga showed using molecular phylogenetic analysis that these names refer to European species and were misapplied by Australian authors.|$|E

5|$|The series' {{popularity}} increased {{sales of}} the A Song of Ice and Fire novels (republished in tie-in editions), which remained {{at the top of}} bestseller lists for months.

With other fantasy series, it has been cited for an increase in the purchase (and abandonment) of huskies and other wolf-like dogs.|$|E
5|$|Acrocanthosaurus may {{be known}} from less {{complete}} remains outside of Oklahoma, Texas, and Wyoming. A tooth from southern Arizona <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> the genus, and matching tooth marks {{have been found}} in sauropod bones from the same area. Several teeth from the Arundel Formation of Maryland have been described as almost identical to those of Acrocanthosaurus and may represent an eastern representative of the genus. Many other teeth and bones from various geologic formations throughout the western United States have also been referred to Acrocanthosaurus, but most of these have been misidentified; there is, however, some disagreement with this assessment regarding fossils from the Cloverly Formation.|$|E

5|$|Because The Assayer {{contains}} such {{a wealth}} of Galileo's ideas on how science should be practised, it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> as his scientific manifesto. Early in 1619, Father Grassi had anonymously published a pamphlet, An Astronomical Disputation on the Three Comets of the Year 1618, which discussed {{the nature of a}} comet that had appeared late in November of the previous year. Grassi concluded that the comet was a fiery body which had moved along a segment of a great circle at a constant distance from the earth, and since it moved in the sky more slowly than the moon, it must be farther away than the moon.|$|E
5|$|Crocodylomorphs are {{abundant}} in the Mussentuchit deposits, being represented largely by teeth. The largest known teeth have been referred to the Pholidosauridae; they are broad with rounded bases, {{and some of them}} bear longitudinal ridges. These large crocodilians would have been capable of preying upon at least juvenile Eolambia at the water's edge. The abundance of juvenile Eolambia specimens in the lakeside fossil material supports this hypothesis; larger Eolambia would have been invulnerable to crocodilians. Smaller crocodilian teeth are also present, with two distinct morphotypes: an ovoid form bearing ridges, which <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> two different species of Bernissartia; and a compressed, triangular form bearing heavy ornamentation, which has been attributed to the Atoposauridae. However, given the uniform small size of these teeth, and the co-occurrence of these morphotypes in some crocodilians, they may belong to the same species.|$|E
5|$|For {{three months}} in 1985, 3,000 minor {{earthquakes}} were detected in the northwestern section of the park, during what <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> as an earthquake swarm, and {{has been attributed to}} minor subsidence of the Yellowstone caldera. Beginning on April 30, 2007, 16 small earthquakes with magnitudes up to 2.7 occurred in the Yellowstone Caldera for several days. These swarms of earthquakes are common, and there have been 70 such swarms between 1983 and 2008. In December 2008, over 250 earthquakes were measured over a four-day span under Yellowstone Lake, the largest measuring a magnitude of 3.9. In January 2010, more than 250 earthquakes were detected over a two-day period. Seismic activity in Yellowstone National Park continues and is reported hourly by the Earthquake Hazards Program of the U.S. Geological Survey.|$|E
