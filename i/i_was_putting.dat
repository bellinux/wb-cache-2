I {{sat down and}} started to work out an agonized craving for the sun and a furious revolt against that terrible cheerless, heartless food by writing down {{descriptions}} of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cooking. Even to write words like apricot, olives and butter, rice and lemons, oil and almonds, produced assuagement. Later I {{came to realize that}} in the England of 1947, those were dirty words <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>putting</b> down.|$|E

My husband and I got involved and were really moved and horrified. As I was writing the song <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>putting</b> myself in that place – {{what would it be like}} to be trapped? Threatened? Alone? Unable to tell anyone what was happening because you're afraid of what would happen?" ...|$|E
500|$|Following her {{critical}} {{success with}} Walk the Line, Witherspoon admits to spending several years [...] "kind of floundering career-wise". Reflecting on {{this period of}} time in a December 2014 interview, Witherspoon attributed it to her separation from her first husband in October 2006 and their subsequent divorce, stating that she spent [...] "a few years just trying to feel better. You know, you can't really be very creative when you feel like your brain is scrambled eggs." [...] She claims that she [...] "wasn't making things I was passionate about. I was just kind of working, you know. And it was really clear that audiences weren't responding to anything <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>putting</b> out there." ...|$|E

"The {{idea for}} it {{happened}} driving {{up and down}} Santa Monica Boulevard in Los Angeles when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>putting</b> together the Patti Smith book [...] last year," [...] Stipe said in 1998. [...] "I had CDs and tape of new songs in the car. I {{came up with this}} one line, 'I found a way to make you smile.' All I knew was The Beach Boys had a record or a song called Smile– is that right?– so I was like, 'Well, this will be my gift to [...] Peter and Mike, and Bill at the time. It was hard to write. It was a high order to say, 'I found a way to make you smile.' I had to come up with, 'OK, what are those ways?' That was tough." [...] Of the line, 'I found a way to make you smile', Stipe later recalled, [...] "I just thought, that's the most beautiful thing in the world." ...|$|E
500|$|Calling {{the show}} a [...] "theatrical {{multimedia}} spectacular", Madonna wanted a huge stage {{with a central}} platform from which {{a flight of stairs}} descended. The central [...] platform was flanked by two lower platforms, which housed the band and the musicians. A large video screen was suspended above the stairs, which descended during the show. Two projectors were situated {{at the front of the}} stage, which projected images of The Pope and President Ronald Reagan during the show. Patrick Leonard, who had produced True Blue, joined as the musical director for the shows. Instead of following every note on the records, Leonard encouraged the musicians to come up with new ideas for the songs. Hence a number of the old songs were rearranged, including introducing a medley of [...] "Dress You Up", [...] "Material Girl" [...] and [...] "Like a Virgin"—which contained a sample from the Four Tops song [...] "I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch)". American choreographer Shabba Doo was signed to choreograph the show. 13-year-old Christopher Finch was signed to play the part of the small boy from the [...] "Open Your Heart" [...] video, since Felix Howard, who played the original part, did not get a working license, and hence could not join the tour. Madonna wanted three backup singers, a team of male dancers and a succession of costume changes. She took inputs from her then husband, actor Sean Penn saying, [...] "I really respect Sean's opinion. He has great taste and is a very brilliant man. When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>putting</b> my tour together, it was always in the back of my mind: 'I wonder what Sean will think of this?' He's extremely opinionated and has really high standards, and that sometimes pushed me into making decisions I wouldn't have otherwise made." [...] The title [...] "Who's That Girl Tour" [...] came to Madonna's mind during rehearsals one-day when she looked at a gigantic image of herself, projected on a screen on the stage. She commented, ...|$|E

They smashed up our furniture and rummaged through our belongings just to maximise their intimidation.

After that, I spent 44 days in solitary confinement where <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>put</b> under a series of emotional, mental and physical tortures.

When I would be writing a song to one, she would be reading it to her comrades and they would be all striving to get acquaintance with me, and to get me to do a song for themselves until they were bothering my head." ...|$|E
2500|$|Keane {{returned}} as captain the side the following season, and guided {{them to a}} treble of the FA Premier League, FA Cup, and UEFA Champions League. In an inspirational display against Juventus in the second leg of the Champions League semi-final, he helped haul his team back from two goals down to win 3–2, scoring the first United goal. His performance in this game {{has been described as}} his finest hour as a footballer. Keane, however, received a yellow card after a trip on Zinedine Zidane that ruled him out of the final. United defeated Bayern Munich 2–1 in the final, but Keane had mixed emotions about the victory due to his suspension. Recalling his thoughts before the game, Keane said, [...] "Although <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>putting</b> a brave face on it, this was just about the worst experience I'd had in football." [...] Later that year, Keane scored the only goal in the final of the Intercontinental Cup, as United defeated Palmeiras in Tokyo.|$|E
2500|$|Safina {{was born}} in Moscow, Russia to Tatar parents. Her mother, Rauza Islanova, was her trainer when she was younger; while her father is {{director}} of the Spartak tennis club in Moscow. Her brother Marat is a former world No. 1 on the ATP Tour. Speaking of growing up in such a successful tennis family, Safina stated: [...] "Being the little sister in such a big tennis family is not an easy situation. Maybe that's why it took me longer to develop. My father is very competitive, but my parents didn't put pressure on me. I wanted to find my identity. I wanted to be something by myself, like being a big player by myself. So at the beginning <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>putting</b> too much pressure on myself. But then gradually I found myself, and I learned how to do better with that situation." [...] At age 8, Safina and her family moved to Valencia, Spain, and as a result Safina speaks fluent Spanish as well as Russian and English.|$|E

2500|$|After being [...] "utterly inspired" [...] by Jonathon Porritt's book Seeing Green, Lucas {{joined the}} Green Party in 1986. She {{recalled}} in 2007: [...] "I thought, right! I'm going there now" [...] to the Green's main office on Clapham High Street, near where she lived. [...] "I'm {{just going to}} dedicate {{the rest of my}} life to this party". Soon afterwards she became the party's National Press Officer (1987–89) and Co-Chair (1989–90). Lucas has a reputation as a party moderniser, in terms of internal slang, a [...] "spiky" [...] rather than a [...] "fluffy". In a 2009 Guardian interview, she told Decca Aitkenhead: [...] "when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>putting</b> people up to go on TV programmes I'd be saying to them, 'What are you planning to wear?', and they'd be slightly offended that I'd even think of asking the question. But I do genuinely think that has changed, a lot. It's a recognition, not that there's some kind of terrible compromise about putting on a tie, but that actually you don't want people to be focusing on what you look like but on what you're saying".|$|E
2500|$|Kubrick {{had already}} written a {{detailed}} treatment, and Kubrick and Herr got together at Kubrick's home every day, {{breaking down the}} treatment into scenes. From that, Herr wrote the first draft. The filmmaker worried that the book's title might be misread by audiences as referring to people who only did half a day's work and changed it to Full Metal Jacket after discovering the phrase while going through a gun catalogue. After the first draft was completed, Kubrick phoned in his orders, and Hasford and Herr mailed their submissions to him. Kubrick read and edited them, and then the team repeated the process. Neither Hasford nor Herr knew how much he had contributed to the screenplay, {{which led to a}} dispute over the final credits. Hasford remembers, [...] "We were like guys on an assembly line in the car factory. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>putting</b> on one widget and Michael was putting on another widget and Stanley {{was the only one who}} knew that this was going to end up being a car." [...] Herr says the director was not interested in making an anti-war film, but [...] "he wanted to show what war is like." ...|$|E
