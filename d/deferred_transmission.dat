30|$|Authors in [14] {{investigate}} the content-centric networking paradigm in vehicular environments, and they design a CCVN framework, which {{relies on the}} main CCN pillars. Without using a completed broadcast method, CCVN enforces a simple counter-based approach coupled with <b>deferred</b> <b>transmission</b> timers and interest retransmission routines. Firstly, it divides Interest packets into B-Int and A-Int upon different functions. When there is an Interest, the requester uses a B-Int packet to locate the producers and then chooses a preferable content node to ask for series of data with an A-Int. Moreover, Interest forwarding in CCVN {{is no longer a}} completed broadcasting mechanism, and nodes forward a packet based on a counter; an Interest packet would be broadcast only the first time it is received. To ensure transmission reliability, CCVN also designs a timer for each Interest to deal with retransmission and prevent data loss. The design idea of CCVN is similar to our RSBLQ to a certain degree: we both think packet flooding is not a suitable way for VANET, and we choose to take advantage of FIB structure to choose several stable routing paths for Interest, but CCVN uses a hop counter as a broadcast limitation. But it is not enough, a hop counter can only decrease the broadcast range, which can also result in useless traffic.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In {{wireless}} ad-hoc networks, {{whenever a}} node overhears a frame, the node should <b>defer</b> its <b>transmission</b> {{to prevent the}} interference with the ongoing transmission. The exact duration value by which the node should defer is contained in the frame. However, due to the wireless transmission errors and {{due to the fact}} that the carrier sensing range is normally greater than the transmission range, a frame overheard by a node may not always be interpretable and thus the node cannot get the precise duration value by which the node should defer. Therefore, an important issue is that whenever a node detects an erroneous frame, how long the node should defer for. In the current IEEE 802. 11 standards, the node will always <b>defer</b> the <b>transmission</b> by a fixed duration (represented by EIFS). We show that this duration is sometimes smaller and sometimes larger than the desired period by which the <b>transmission</b> should be <b>deferred,</b> and it leads to substantial unfairness and throughput degradation. We propose an enhanced carrier sensing (ECS) scheme, which distinguishes among the type of the erroneous frames based on their lengths and <b>defers</b> the <b>transmission</b> accordingly.

30|$|This article {{proposes a}} {{superframe}} duration adjustment scheme (SUDAS) for IEEE 802.15. 4 {{which is the}} extended work from [18] and [31]. In [18], the authors focus on how to decrease the collisions between beacons or even between beacon and data packets by adjusting the beacon starting times of PAN and coordinator nodes for cluster tree topology, which only considers for the part of CAP but not for GTS slot allocation in the corresponding Markov chain model. SUDAS focuses on assigning adjustable length of GTS slot based {{on the length of}} packet and also deciding the precise time for the GTS starting time (GTSstart) and the GTS length (GTSlength) for star topology. SUDAS is expected to effectively allocate GTS to the requested device nodes to improve bandwidth utilization in CFP, while the length of CAP can be used by other device nodes to transmit their data packets which do not receive the allocated GTS. The performance of SUDAS for star topology is analyzed by the Markov chain model modified from [18] for considering packet retransmission, ACK, <b>defer</b> <b>transmission</b> and GTS allocation, which is to obtain the probability of success transmissions, network goodput, energy consumption, and average bandwidth utilization for IEEE 802.15. 4 MAC.|$|R
30|$|The IEEE 802.11 {{standard}} provides {{two techniques}} to handle interference from other nodes: one is physical carrier sensing, {{while the second}} is the RTS/CTS (request to send/clear to send) technique, also known as virtual carrier sensing. The RTS/CTS is basically designed to tackle the hidden terminal problem. In the RTS/CTS mechanism, a sending node sends a RTS message to the receiving node before transmitting a data frame. Once the RTS message is sent, there are two possibilities: (1) If the RTS message is not answered with a CTS message, then the sender reschedules the RTS message. (2) If the RTS message is answered with a CTS message, then the sending node can transmit the data frame, and the other nodes <b>defer</b> their <b>transmission</b> on receipt of the CTS message. The interference range of a node is greater than its transmission range. Therefore, nodes out of the receiver's transmission range cannot receive the CTS message, which would <b>defer</b> their <b>transmission,</b> but can interfere with the transmissions of sending and receiving nodes which are within their interference range. This interference has been reported in [8] and causes performance degradation of the network. To further clarify these interference effects, consider the following example which is taken from [8].|$|R

40|$|Spectrum {{allocation}} {{and application}} requirements often result in severe bandwidth limitations on wireless channels. A fundamental challenge {{is using the}} limited channel capacity in the most efficient way. This dissertation presents several capacityconservation schemes for wireless networks. The proposed algorithms span across the entire protocol stack but share the same objective of eliminatingredundancies and ensuring the timeliness of transmissions. At the lowest level, capacity conservation is improved with a header compression algorithm that unlike previous protocols is capable of compressing MAC headers on multiple-access (shared) channels. Previous header compression schemes are unable to compress MAC headers as they rely on link layer addressing for the correct interpretation of compressed fields. An adaptive encapsulation scheme is presented to maximize the number IP packets sent during a single contention for the channel {{in an effort to}} amortizethe overhead over multiple IP packets. Efficiency is improved by <b>deferring</b> <b>transmissions</b> to accumulate several packets, all while ensuring transport-leveldelay requirements and accounting for the time-varying nature of the transmission overhead as network conditions change. The result is anoutstanding improvement in the effective throughput. Another header compression algorithm is presented which leverages on routing information to minimize the overhead of frequent context initializations during periods of high node mobility. A statelesscompression scheme for control messages is also presented and is used to reduce the overhead of frequent routing updates. Finally, by addressing the redundancy and timeliness issues of multi-hop wireless broadcasting, we improve the capacity conservation {{in one of the most}} important applications in multi-hop wirelessenvironments...|$|R
