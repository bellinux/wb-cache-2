40|$|Aesthetics {{and design}} have become {{critical}} factors for the jewelry industry, especially considering that product value no longer concerns just precious metal content but {{is more and}} more related to fashion trends, innovative design concepts, and new artistic expressions. In the last decade the jewelry industry has therefore shown an increasing interest in innovation, both in terms of design and production capabilities. Digital modeling is becoming essential, allowing designers to fully express themselves. This powerful technique is completely exploited only when coupled to innovative production processes and materials. Designers then have to analyze and further deepen their knowledge of new processes in order to shape their ideas, using technical and constructive parameters completely different from traditional handicraft criteria. Their intensive use is leading to better application of new technologies, taking full advantage of all possible potentials. The aim of this work is to analyze a real-case scenario and to show an example of the "idea to product" path, mainly taking into account technology options and their feasibility and effectiveness.
