40|$|Share {{issuance}} predicts cross-sectional {{returns in}} a non-U. S. sample of stocks from 41 different countries. Issuance predictability has greater statistical significance than either size or momentum, and {{is similar to}} book-to-market. As in the U. S., the international issuance effect is robust across both small and large firms. Unlike the U. S., the effect is driven more by low returns after share creation rather than positive returns following share repurchases. <b>Issuance</b> <b>return</b> predictability is stronger in countries with greater issuance activity, greater stock market development, and stronger investor protection.

40|$|The {{significant}} negative <b>issuance</b> day <b>returns</b> associated with seasoned equity offerings (SEOs) {{have been a}} puzzle. In this paper we provide two explanations for this empirical regularity. First, using an option-based argument, we contend that <b>issuance</b> day <b>returns</b> are negative because of SEO related declines in volatility that reduce the option value of equity. Our empirical examination of US SEOs between 1983 and 2003 strongly supports this contention. Second, {{we find that the}} negative <b>issuance</b> date <b>return</b> is also related to market liquidity around the issuance date. Our findings are robust to various sub-samples and the uncertainty resolution argument, and are not driven by SEO buy-sell order imbalances.

The share issuance measure {{which is the}} annual logarithmic change in shares outstanding that is adjusted for distribution events is not significantly related to expected equity returns in a univariate setting. This {{is due to the}} prevalence of rights offerings in BIST and the consequent mechanical relation between the issuance measure and the book-to-market effect. After controlling for book-to-market, size and momentum factors, there is a significantly negative relation between share <b>issuance</b> and expected <b>returns,</b> especially for longer return horizons.

40|$|The average firm {{going public}} or issuing new equity underperforms {{the market in}} the long run. A {{potential}} explanation of this long-run underperformance {{has to do with the}} endogeneity of the number of new issues. That is, due to the clustering of events after periods of high abnormal returns in issues, ex post measures of average abnormal returns may be negative on average despite zero ex ante abnormal returns. This could lead one to incorrectly infer underperformance. We provide a thorough evaluation of the endogeneity problem in event studies as it relates to long-run underperformance and undertake both theoretical and simulation analyses.

40|$|The average firm {{going public}} or issuing new equity has underperformed {{the market in}} the long run. Endogeneity of the number of new issues has been {{proposed}} as a potential explanation of this long-run underperformance. Under pseudo market timing of new issues, ex post measures of average abnormal returns may be negative on average despite zero ex ante abnormal returns. We show that, under reasonable stationarity assumptions on the process generating events, traditional measures of average abnormal returns are consistent, and the pseudo market timing effect is a small sample problem. In simulations of an empirical model we demonstrate that the bias is small even in moderate sample sizes. An abnormal return measure capturing a feasible investment strategy is not biased. We argue that it is unlikely that pseudo market timing is the explanation for the long-run underperformance in equity <b>issuances.</b> Abnormal <b>return</b> measures; Endogenous events; Event studies; Initial public offerings; Long-run underperformance...|$|R

40|$|This study tests {{early and}} {{aftermarket}} returns of Asia-Pacific and European equities {{traded on the}} New York Stock Exchange as American Depository Receipts (ADRs) {{for a period of}} three years from the date of issue. The results provide evidence that the US markets overpriced on average the Asian ADRs for the entire sample period from January 1987 through September 2000. However, while the sample of Asia-Pacific equities issued from January 1987 through May 1998 underperformed the S&P 500 by almost 23 %, the ADRs issued from May 1998 through September 2000 returned roughly the same as the S&P 500 for the three-year bear market holding period. These results may suggest timing of Asia-Pacific ADR <b>issuance</b> affects excess <b>returns</b> over the S&P 500 in the long run.

40|$|The {{first part}} of this {{dissertation}} reviews the asset pricing literature on Turkish markets. After a general literature review, it focuses on studies associated with share issuance; next, it examines literature on the relationship between macroeconomic factors and stock returns. The second part of this dissertation investigates the predictive power of share <b>issuance</b> on stock <b>returns</b> on the Borsa Istanbul and tests its significance vis-à-vis the well-known factors of market equity, book-to-market and momentum by employing multivariate Fama-MacBeth regressions. The sign of the slope coefficients on book-to-market and market equity are consistent with prior literature; however, the slope coefficient on momentum is negative. In univariate settings, share issuance is not statistically significant because of the mechanical relation between rights offerings and book value; however, when considered jointly with book-to-market, market equity and momentum, share <b>issuance</b> predicts cross-sectional <b>returns,</b> especially for longer return horizons. The analysis shows that after three-month <b>return</b> regressions, share <b>issuance</b> is more significant than market equity and momentum, and is similar to book-to-market in terms of predictive power. The third part of this dissertation analyzes stock exposure to various financial and macroeconomic risk factors through univariate and multivariate estimates of factor betas. It also investigates the performance of these factor betas in predicting the cross-sectional variation in individual stock returns quoted on the Turkish stock market over the sample period 1992 - 2011. The study contributes to the literature through its use of a two-step procedure. First, the factor betas are estimated using stock returns and macroeconomic factors; then, the sensitivities of these factor betas are calculated. The three most important findings are: (i) there exists a negative and significant relation between the interest rate beta of benchmark bonds and future individual stock returns; (ii) the addition of well-known market, book-to-market, size and momentum factors does not alter the statistical significance of the interest rate beta of benchmark bonds; and (iii) univariate portfolio analysis shows that these results are driven by debt/equity (leverage) ratio. In short, the study concludes that the sensitivity to the interest rate of benchmark bonds or leverage is a risk factor for the Turkish stock market...|$|R
40|$|Convertible {{exchangeable}} {{preferred stock}} includes {{an option for}} the issuer to exchange the preferred for convertible bonds with identical pre-tax cash flows and conversion terms. In other respects this innovative corporate security is identical to traditional convertible preferred stock. The exchange feature provides the issuer with a potentially valuable option to swap a non-tax-deductible expense for a tax-deductible one. The exercise of the option imposes a cost on institutional investors, {{but even with the}} option fully priced, the innovative security should dominate the tradtional one as a capital raising vehicle. Thus, it is something of a puzzle that offerings of both security types persist for 15 years. I argue that firms expecting to force conversion quickly place a lower value on the tax shield obtainable by the exchange provision, and hence issue conventional convertible preferred to avoid pooling with lower-quality issuers. Thus, an offering of convertible exchangeable preferred stock should be a more negative signal than the traditional variety. Empirical evidence supports the hypothesis. The common stock price reactions to announcements of convertible exchangeable preferred stock average around – 2 % and are highly statistically significant. Reactions to convertible preferred stock announcements also are negative, but about half as large and less significant. Negative abnormal <b>returns</b> around the <b>issuance</b> date also are larger in the convertible exchangeable preferred sample. Cross- sectional regressions show that announcement and <b>issuance</b> abnormal <b>returns</b> depend {{on the use of the}} exchange option, whether the proceeds are used to refund existing convertibles, pre-offer financial leverage, growth opportunities and growth-related information asymmetry. Even firms with the most profitable growth opportunities experience negative abnormal returns around announcement and issuance, contradicting theories that predict positive information from equity- linked security offerings. convertible exchangeable preferred stock; convertible securities; securities issuance; security design; signaling; growth opportunities...|$|R
