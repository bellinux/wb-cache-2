She later sailed with the Great White Fleet on a circumnavigation of the Earth to showcase the US Navy's growing fleet of blue-water-capable ships. After completing her service with the Great White Fleet, Connecticut participated in several flag-waving exercises intended to protect American citizens abroad until she was pressed into service as a troop transport at the end of World War I to <b>expedite</b> the return of American Expeditionary Forces from France.|$|E
50|$|Desk <b>expediting</b> is {{also known}} as {{telephone}} <b>expediting.</b> It is an important tool for producing companies to monitor order progress with manufacturers. Especially at milestone of a project, desk <b>expediting</b> can be helpful to check whether the project is still within the agreed schedule. Although desk <b>expediting</b> is a quick and easy way to be informed about the current status of a project, it should always be conducted in combination with field <b>expediting</b> to securely verify the actual status.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a single-item, periodic review inventory control problem where discrete stochastic demand must be satisfied. When shortages occur, the unmet demand must {{be filled by}} some form of <b>expediting.</b> We allow a very general form for the cost structure of <b>expediting,</b> which might include costs associated with in-house rush production or outsourcing. We explicitly consider the case where <b>expedited</b> production is allowed to produce up to a positive inventory level. We also considered the case where <b>expedited</b> production beyond the shortfall is not permitted; an alternate application for this model is an inventory system with general lost sales costs. For the infinite horizon discounted problem, we characterize {{the structure of the}} optimal <b>expediting</b> policy and show that an (s, S) policy is optimal for regular production. In certain cases, we demonstrate that it may indeed be optimal to use <b>expedited</b> production to build up inventory. For the special cases where the <b>expediting</b> cost function is concave or consists of a fixed and linear per-unit cost, we show that the optimal <b>expediting</b> policy is generalized (s, S) or order-up-to, respectively. An explicit heuristic for policy calculation is given; a numerical study tests the heuristic and allows us to gain insight into when <b>expediting</b> above zero is cost-effective. We find that, while excess <b>expediting</b> above zero is frequently optimal (particularly when the per-unit costs are close to those of regular production), the actual cost savings from the additional <b>expediting</b> are minimal. ...|$|R

She was laid down on 15 May 1905 and {{launched}} on 23 June 1906 before the dockyards themselves were finished. Her completion was greatly delayed by labour troubles and by the diversion of the 12-inch (305mm) guns intended for her to <b>expedite</b> completion of HMS Dreadnought, and she was not finally completed until June 1908, six months before her sister Lord Nelson.|$|E

40|$|To {{describe}} {{the policies and}} procedures for conducting <b>expedited</b> initial review GENERAL DESCRIPTION The Institutional Review Board (IRB) uses an <b>expedited</b> review process to review studies that meet the categories adopted by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) or the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that involve no greater than “minimal risk. ” The <b>expedited</b> applicability criteria, including the definition of “minimal risk ” and federally mandated categories are attached. <b>Expedited</b> review procedures allow the IRB to review and approve studies that meet the criteria in the attached document without convening {{a meeting of the}} full IRB. The IRB Chair, one or more experienced reviewers from among the Medical IRB membership (regular and alternate members) or the Nonmedical IRB <b>Expedited</b> Review Subcommittee conducts <b>expedited</b> initial review. The <b>expedited</b> reviewers only approve research that meets the federal criteria for approval as specified in 45 CFR 46. 111 and 21 CFR 56. 111. Also, <b>expedited</b> reviewers ensure that the study’s informed consent process and documentation meets the requirements as specified in 45 CFR 46. 116 and 21 CFR 50. 25 unless the IRB waives the requirements in accord with federa...|$|R

5|$|Rwanda's {{legal system}} is {{largely based on}} German and Belgian civil law systems and {{customary}} law. The judiciary is independent of the executive branch, although the President and the Senate {{are involved in the}} appointment of Supreme Court judges. Human Rights Watch have praised the Rwandan government for progress made in the delivery of justice including the abolition of the death penalty, but also allege interference in the judicial system by members of the government, such as the politically motivated appointment of judges, misuse of prosecutorial power, and pressure on judges to make particular decisions. The constitution provides for two types of courts: ordinary and specialised. Ordinary courts are the Supreme Court, the High Court, and regional courts, while specialised courts are military courts and a system of commercial courts created in 2011 to <b>expedite</b> commercial litigations. Between 2004 and 2012, a system of Gacaca courts was in operation. Gacaca, a Rwandan traditional court operated by villages and communities, was revived to <b>expedite</b> the trials of genocide suspects. The court succeeded in clearing the backlog of genocide cases, but was criticised by human rights groups as not meeting legal fair standard.|$|E
5|$|The Prime Minister took {{other steps}} to deter Hitler from aggression. He doubled {{the size of}} the Territorial Army, created a Ministry of Supply to <b>expedite</b> the {{provision}} of equipment to the armed forces, and instituted peacetime conscription. The Italian invasion of Albania on 7 April 1939 led to guarantees being given to Greece and Romania. On 17 June 1939, Handley Page received an order for 200 Hampden twin-engined medium bombers, and by 3 September 1939, the chain of radar stations girdling the British coast was fully operational.|$|E

50|$|An <b>expedited</b> {{removal order}} cannot be appealed. However, it is {{possible}} to submit a challenge to the order to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection to reconsider an <b>expedited</b> removal order. The challenge should be filed within 30 days of the decision. Based on the information and evidence provided, the CBP may exercise its discretion and overturn its prior <b>expedited</b> removal order. If an <b>expedited</b> removal order was issued at a designated port of entry such as an airport, the affected party may also file a complaint with the DHS's Traveler Redress Inquiry Program.|$|R
40|$|In an assemble-to-order system, a {{wide variety}} of {{products}} are rapidly assembled from component inventories, in response to customer orders. Orders must be filled within a product-specific target leadtime. In the event that some of the components required to fill an order are out-of-stock, these components are <b>expedited</b> at a high cost per unit. The objective is to minimize the expected infinite horizon discounted cost of nominal component production and <b>expediting.</b> This discounted formulation captures financial inventory holding costs. The levers for control are (1) sequencing orders for assembly (2) component production (3) component <b>expediting.</b> Under the assumption that <b>expedited</b> components have zero leadtime, the multi-dimensional assemble-to-order control problem separates into single-item inventory control problems. The optimal production and <b>expediting</b> policy for each component is independent of all other components. Hence the literature on single-item inventory management with <b>expediting</b> or lost sales is directly relevant to the control of assemble-to-order systems.

Due to a misunderstanding by the battalion commander, the unit did not burn down the town on 6October, and released the 170hostages it had arrested.

5|$|In 1969, {{plans to}} extend the freeway portion of SR 78 east from the Broadway {{interchange}} through Escondido were delayed by Caltrans director Jacob Dekema {{due to a lack}} of funding until 1980.
