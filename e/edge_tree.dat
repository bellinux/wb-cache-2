40|$|The {{high-level}} {{contribution of}} this paper is to establish benchmarks for the minimum hop count per source-receiver path and the minimum number of <b>edges</b> per <b>tree</b> for multicast routing in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) under different mobility models. In this pursuit, we explore the tradeoffs between these two routing strategies with respect to hop count, number of edges and lifetime per multicast tree with respect to the Random Waypoint, City Section and Manhattan mobility models. We employ the Breadth First Search algorithm and the Minimum Steiner Tree heuristic for determining a sequence of minimum hop and minimum <b>edge</b> <b>trees</b> respectively. While both the minimum hop and minimum <b>edge</b> <b>trees</b> exist for a relatively longer time under the Manhattan mobility model; the number of <b>edges</b> per <b>tree</b> and the hop count per source-receiver path are relatively low under the Random Waypoint model.

The predicted ACD for plot CN 95 was almost double the field-estimated value, irrespective of which area-based model was fitted (e.g. 251 vs 551 Mg C ·ha− 1 for the TCH-only model). Bootstrap values obtained by cross-validation revealed that coefficients estimated when plot CN 95 {{was removed from the}} MLE model were quite distinct from coefficients estimated after removing other plots, underscoring that this plot was unusual. Furthermore, random shifts of the plot’s location around the recorded position resulted in larger variation in TCH estimates for CN 95 than found in any other plot; this variation is expected when a large tree sits just outside a plot boundary and may, or may not, be included in TCH estimates when plot corners are randomly moved.

We aim to better understand lichen community ecology of coral island forests. We used an epiphytic lichen community survey to gauge Pisonia (Pisonia grandis R. BR.), which dominates forest conditions on Heron Island, Australia. Nine survey plots were sampled for lichen species presence and abundance, all tree diameters and species, GPS location, distance to forest-beach edge, and dominant forest type. Results found only six unique lichens and two lichen associates. A Multi-Response Permutation Procedures (MRPP) test found statistically distinct lichen communities among forest types. The greatest group differences were between interior Pisonia and perimeter forest types. Ordinations were performed to further understand causes for distinctions in lichen communities. Significant explanatory gradients were distance to forest <b>edge,</b> <b>tree</b> density (shading), and Pisonia basal area. Each of these variables was negatively correlated with lichen diversity and abundance, suggesting that interior, successionally advanced, Pisonia forests support fewer lichens. Island edge and presumably younger forests—often those with greater tree diversity and sunlight penetration—supported the highest lichen diversity. Heron Island’s Pisonia-dominated forests support low lichen diversity which mirrors overall biodiversity patterns.

40|$|Summary Variable {{retention}} harvesting (VRH) {{has been proposed}} as a silvicultural practice to maintain biodiversity and ecosystem integrity. No previous study has examined tree carbon isotope discrimination to provide insights into water stress {{that could lead to}} dieback and mortality of trees follow-ing VRH. We measured and compared the carbon isotope ra-tios (δ 13 C) in stem wood of trembling aspen (Populus tremu-loides Michx.) before and after VRH. Eight trees were sampled from isolated residual, edge and control (interior of unhar-vested stand) positions from each of seven plots in three re-gions (Calling Lake and Drayton Valley, Alberta and Lac Duparquet, Québec). After VRH, the general trend in mean δ 13 C was residual> edge> control trees. Although this trend is indicative of water stress in residual trees, it also suggests that <b>edge</b> <b>trees</b> received some sheltering effect, reducing their stress compared with that of residuals. A strong inverse relationship was found between the δ 13 C values and the mean annual pre-cipitation in each region. The trend in mean δ 13 C signature was Calling Lake> Drayton Valley> Lac Duparquet trees. These results suggest that residual or <b>edge</b> <b>trees</b> in drier regions are more likely to suffer water stress following VRH. We also ob-served a trend of greater δ 13 C in stout trees compared with slen-der trees, both before and after VRH. The evidence of greater water stress in stout trees likely occurred because of a positive relationship between stem diameter and crown volume per basal area. Our results provide evidence that water stress could be the driving mechanism leading to dieback and mortality of residual trees shortly after VRH. Additionally, the results from <b>edge</b> <b>trees</b> indicate that leaving hardwood residuals in larger patches or more sheltered landscape positions could reduce the water stress to which these trees are subjected, thereby reduc-ing dieback and mortality...|$|R
40|$|In Australia, tree {{planting}} {{has been}} widely promoted to alleviate dryland salinity and one proposed planting configuration is that of strategically placed interception belts. We conducted an experiment {{to determine the effect}} of tree position in a belt on transpiration rate. We also assessed how much the effect of tree position can be explained by advection and environmental conditions. Daily transpiration rates were determined by the heat pulse velocity technique for four edge and 12 inner trees in a 7 -year-old Tasmanian blue gum (Eucalyptus globulus) plantation in South Australia. Various climatic variables were logged automatically at one edge of the plantation. The relationship between daily sap flow and sapwood area was strongly linear for the edge trees (r 2 = 0. 97), but only moderately correlated for the inner trees (r 2 = 0. 46), suggesting an edge effect. For all trees, sap flow normalized to sapwood area (Qs) increased with potential evaporation (PE) initially and then became independent as PE increased further. There was a fairly close correlation between transpiration of the edge and inner trees, implying that water availability was partially responsible for the difference between inner and edge trees. However, the ratio of <b>edge</b> <b>tree</b> to inner tree transpiration differed from unity, indicating differences in canopy conductance, which were estimated by an inverse form of the Penman-Monteith equation. When canopy conductances were less than a critical value, there was a strong linear relationship between Qs of the edge and inner trees. When canopy conductances of the edge trees were greater than the critical value, the slope of the linear relationship was steeper, indicating greater transpiration of the edge trees compared with the inner trees. This was interpreted as evidence for enhancement of transpiration of the edge trees by advection of wind energy. Taylor, P J; Nuberg, I K; Hatton, T...|$|E

The storm Dagmar had an estimated KILE cost of 450 million for the energy companies in Norway. Since a safe power supply is obvious in today's society, the working project group «strong forest» are working to reduce the number of uprooting and stem breakage by shaping strong forests beside the power lines. This study shows the edge effect and the stability in forest beside the power lines by a ratio between diameter and height of individual trees (D/H ratio). From D/H ratio was it calculated what each <b>edge</b> <b>tree</b> manages in windspeed and it was simulated a storm with a windspeed at 22 m/s.

Although the edge effect is not found to be significant. There is a large variation in the edge effect between all 12 stands for both the main tree species and other species.

40|$|There is {{major concern}} internationally, and {{specifically}} in the Ethiopian afromontane biodiversity hotspot, {{about the impact of}} forest habitat fragmentation on biodiversity conservation. This study assessed the effect of land-use change on land-cover pattern, forest patch spatial structure and consequent effects on plant species richness and composition in two areas of southwest Ethiopia: Illubabor and the Gamo highlands of Gamo Gofa. Land-use change analysis was conducted on three sites, I (1500 - 2000 m altitude) and II and III (1878 - 2422 m altitude), each of 47, 648 ha, in Illubabor and one area of 66, 765 ha in the Gamo highlands. Two Landsat images from the years 1986 and 2000 and one Spot image from 2007 covering Illubabor and two Landsat images from 1995 and 2010 covering most of the Gamo highlands study area were analysed. The change in area, number, shape and edge density of patches of each land-cover class were quantified between the years. Field sampling of woody plants was conducted in plots within 30 forest patches in Illubabor stratified between the three sites, and ten in the Gamo highlands stratified between sacred groves and non-sacred forests. Information on local knowledge, cultural association, institutions, practices and threats of the sacred groves was obtained by interviewing 24 of their traditional custodians. The landscape pattern in both Illubabor Zone and Gamo highlands has changed rapidly over 20 years. In highland areas there has been a rapid conversion of forest to farm, settlement and grazing land. At lower altitude forest cover has been retained but it has been degraded by its use for understorey coffee cultivation. The area and number of forest patches has decreased while patch shape and edge density has increased. In Illubabor forests’ woody plant species richness was higher in the lower altitude site I (70. 8 ± 9. 2) than in sites II (50. 9 ± 6. 3) and III (54. 3 ± 4. 9), with little difference in the shape of their species accumulation curves. Species composition also differed between site I and sites II and III; altitude and disturbance were more strongly associated with this difference than were patch size, shape and edge density. There was little difference in tree density or basal area amongst the sites. Within forest patches, tree basal area was higher in the patch interior (96. 8 ± 9. 4 m 2 ha- 1) than in the edge zone (77. 2 ± 15. 3 m 2 ha- 1), however total tree density did not differ significantly. The interior forest had twice the density of trees taller than 22 m and a higher density of small trees (5 - 14. 9 cm DBH) than the <b>edge.</b> <b>Tree</b> species richness did not differ significantly between the two habitats, however including shrubs and vines total woody species richness was higher in the edge (69. 3 ± 5. 9) than interior (52 ± 3. 5) forest. While the upper canopy of interior forest was dominated by species with a wide habitat distribution range, it also had a higher abundance of forest-habitat specialist species than the edge. Species with a distribution associated with forest-margins were, as expected, more abundant in the edge habitat. No association was found between tree density, basal area or height in both habitat types and any fragmentation variables (patch size, shape or edge density) or environmental variables (rainfall, altitude or cumulative disturbance). However, edge habitat basal area was negatively associated with disturbance. Shrub, vine and geophytic angiosperm herb species composition differed between forest edge and interior habitats. Species richness of vascular epiphytes was higher in interior (28. 9 ± 1. 8) than edge (13. 6 ± 1. 4) habitat, as was their individual density (114. 5 ± 6. 5 and 42. 7 ± 3. 7 respectively), which was associated with the density of large DBH trees. Epiphyte density was not associated with any fragmentation variables, rainfall or altitude, however in the edge habitat it was negatively associated with disturbance. Species composition varied between the two habitats, with forest-habitat distribution species, which tended to have herbaceous stems and leaves, being more abundant in the interior habitat. However, the same three epiphyte species were dominant in both habitats, and species with succulent stems and leaves or woody stems had similar abundance in both. Geophytic fern species richness was higher in interior (29. 4 ± 1. 8) than edge (22. 1 ± 1. 4) habitat, as was individual density (104 ± 22. 3 and 59. 8 ± 13. 7 respectively). Species with forest-habitat distribution, those with creeping or erect rhizomes and those with tufted fronds were more abundant in the interior, while generalist distribution species and those with spaced fronds showed no difference. In the Gamo highlands, sampled woody plant species richness and diversity were higher in sacred groves than in non-sacred forests, however, the species accumulation curve showed no difference between the two categories of forest.

However, there is one difference: in the modelling data, G and BAL were computed within 300 -m 2 plots (around 10  m radius) for all trees of the plot, not only for trees near plot center. These values of G and BAL may not describe the competition that <b>edge</b> <b>trees</b> face in the best possible way because trees outside the plot also create competition. This may be called as “sampling error” in the calculation of G and BAL for the <b>edge</b> <b>trees</b> in individual-tree growth modelling. Sampling error results in weaker relationship (underestimated influence) between growth and G or BAL in the growth model. In the current study, this underestimation was counteracted by the distance-dependent computation of G and BAL, which increased their variation. As a result, the predictions may in fact be better than when calculating G and BAL in the same way as they were computed in the data preparation step of growth modelling.|$|R
40|$|Summary Tropical {{forests are}} {{critical}} for protecting global biodiversity and carbon stores. While forest degradation and fragmentation cause negative impacts on trees, many woody lianas benefit, with associated negative effects on carbon storage. Here, {{we focus on the}} key question of how abiotic environmental changes resulting from tropical forest fragmentation mediate the allocation of carbon into trees and lianas. We focus on the globally threatened Brazilian Atlantic Forest, in forest fragments spanning 13 – 23 442 ha in area and at fragment edges and interiors. Within each fragment, we established two transects: one at the edge and one in the interior. Each transect consisted of ten 10 × 10 m plots spaced at 20 m intervals. Within each plot, we sampled living trees with diameter ≥ 4 · 8 cm at 1 · 3 m above ground, living lianas with diameter ≥ 1 · 6 cm at 10 cm above ground, and several microclimatic and soil variables. Fragmentation changed a broad suite of abiotic environmental conditions recognized as being associated with forest carbon stocks: edges and smaller fragments were hotter, windier, and less humid, with more fertile and less acid soils at <b>edges.</b> <b>Tree</b> carbon stocks were thus higher in forest interiors than at edges, and were positively related to fragment size in interiors, but were not impacted by fragment size at <b>edges.</b> <b>Trees</b> and lianas showed different responses to fragmentation: in interiors of small fragments, tree carbon stocks declined whereas liana carbon stocks increased; and at <b>edges,</b> <b>tree</b> carbon stocks were not affected by fragment size, whereas liana carbon stocks were highest in smaller fragments. These patterns were strongly related to changes in abiotic environmental conditions. We conclude that the abiotic changes across the fragmentation gradient, rather than liana proliferation, were more likely to reduce tree carbon stocks. Cutting of lianas is frequently promoted for restoring forest carbon in human-modified tropical forests. However, this approach may not be effective for restoring forest carbon stocks in fragmented forests...|$|R

We assessed {{the ability of}} the species to alter its gas exchange characteristics, leaf physical attributes, and water-use efficiency of foliar carbon assimilation (WUE i) or of total dry matter production (WUE DM). Stomatal conductance (g s) varied five-fold between treatment means, with coppices exhibiting greatest values and mature bush least. Photosynthetic rates followed this trend. Leaf photosynthetic capacity estimated by chlorophyll content varied 1. 3 -fold parallel with variations in leaf thickness, with coppices rating lowest and mature <b>edge</b> <b>trees</b> most highly. WUE i varied 1. 5 -fold between treatments and was greatest in mature inner-bush and <b>edge</b> <b>trees.</b> Leaf photosynthetic capacity and g s were both correlated with WUE i. Carbon isotope composition (δ 13 C values) of new shoot dry matter produced early in a seasonal flush were similar to those of root starch but when averaged over the whole season correlated well with WUE i and gas exchange characteristics of trees of each treatment. Coppices showed poorest WUE i and most negative shoot tip δ 13 C but their WUE DM was high. This discrepancy was suggested to relate to carbon allocation strategies in coppices favouring fast growth of replacement shoots but not of roots. Physiology of coppice growth of E.  kochii is usefully geared towards both rapid and water-use efficient production of woody biomass in water limited environments...|$|R
