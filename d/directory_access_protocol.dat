40|$|Abstract—Researchers have {{proposed}} numerous directory techniques to address multicore scalability whose behavior de-pends on the CPU’s particular configuration, e. g. core count and cache size. As CPUs continue to scale, {{it is essential}} to explore the directory’s architecture dependences. However, this is challenging using detailed simulation given the large number of CPU configurations that are possible. This paper proposes to use multicore reuse distance analysis to study coherence directories. We develop a framework to extract the <b>directory</b> <b>access</b> stream from parallel LRU stacks, enabling rapid analysis of the <b>directory’s</b> <b>accesses</b> and contents across both core count and cache size scaling. We also implement our framework in a profiler, and apply it to gain insights into multicore scaling’s impact on the directory. Our profiling results show that <b>directory</b> <b>accesses</b> reduce by 3. 5 x across data cache size scaling, suggesting techniques that tradeoff access latency for reduced capacity or conflicts become increasingly effective as cache size scales. We also show the portion of on-chip memory devoted to the directory cache can be reduced by 53. 3 % across data cache size scaling, thus lowering the over-provisioning needed at large cache sizes. Finally, we validate our RD-based directory analyses, and find they are within 13 % of cache simulations in terms of access count, on average. I...|$|R
40|$|The {{trend for}} {{multicore}} CPUs is towards increasing core count. One {{of the key}} limiters to scaling will be the on-chip directory cache. Our work investigates moving portions of the directory away from the cores, perhaps to off-chip DRAM, where ample capacity exists. While such multi-level directory caches exhibit increased latency, several aspects of <b>directory</b> <b>accesses</b> will shield CPU performance from the slower direc-tory, including low access frequency and latency hiding un-derneath data accesses to main memory. While multi-level directory caches have been studied pre-viously, no work has of yet comprehensively quantified the <b>directory</b> <b>access</b> patterns themselves, {{making it difficult to}} un-derstand multi-level behavior in depth. This paper presents a framework based on multicore reuse distance for studying di-rectory cache access patterns. Using our analysis framework, we show between 69 – 93 % of directory entries are looked up only once or twice during their liftimes in the directory cache, and between 51 – 71 % of dynamic <b>directory</b> <b>accesses</b> are la-tency tolerant. Using cache simulations, we show a very small L 1 directory cache can service 80 % of latency critical directory lookups. Although a significant number of directory lookups and eviction notifications must access the slower L 2 directory cache, virtually all of these are latency tolerant. 1...|$|R

40|$|The rise of {{machine-to-machine}} communications has rekindled {{the interest}} in random <b>access</b> <b>protocols</b> as a support for a massive number of uncoordinatedly transmitting devices. The legacy ALOHA approach is developed under a collision model, where slots containing collided packets are considered as waste. However, if the common receiver (e. g., base station) is capable to store the collision slots and use them in a transmission recovery process based on successive interference cancellation, the design space for <b>access</b> <b>protocols</b> is radically expanded. We present the paradigm of coded random access, in which {{the structure of the}} <b>access</b> <b>protocol</b> can be mapped to a structure of an erasure-correcting code defined on graph. This opens the possibility to use coding theory and tools for designing efficient random <b>access</b> <b>protocols,</b> offering markedly better performance than ALOHA. Several instances of coded random <b>access</b> <b>protocols</b> are described, as well as a case study on how to upgrade a legacy ALOHA system using the ideas of coded random access.
