25|$|Heavy {{or light}} traffic within the ride system can cause speed {{variations}} as the vehicles {{try not to}} enter the specified safety distance between one another. On busy days, each vehicle may slow to a crawl at intervals within the ride path {{in order to allow}} the vehicle ahead to gain distance, then suddenly jerk back into higher speed. Because of these unexpected variations in speed, the soundtrack to the ride is not of a specific length, in fact, each scene of the attraction has a pre-selected score to play which is already of a certain length. If the vehicle finds itself remaining in one scene {{for an extended period of}} time, the score will play in full or until the vehicle leaves the scene. If the vehicle remains in a scene longer than the length of the score, then an exaggerated soundtrack of the vehicle's engine will <b>fade-in</b> and play to keep riders from experiencing awkward silence. Due to safety reasons, vehicles on the ride path cannot reverse. Contrary to the finale scene when the vehicle reverses away from the boulder, the vehicle is actually stationary while the motion base tilts backwards and the cave walls accelerate past the riders to give the illusion of reversing.|$|E
500|$|Created {{during a}} period when the Beatles had fully embraced the {{recording}} studio {{as a means of}} artistic expression, the recording added further to the message behind the song. Like [...] "Eight Days a Week", the completed track begins with a <b>fade-in,</b> a device that in combination with the fadeout, according to Rodriguez, [...] "provided a circular effect, perfectly matching the song's lack of resolution". Everett similarly recognises McCartney's [...] "clumsy finger-tapping impatience" [...] on the piano over the E79 chord as an apt expression of the struggle to articulate.|$|E
500|$|The Beatles was {{the last}} Beatles album to be mixed {{separately}} for stereo and mono, though the mono version was issued only in the UK {{and a few other}} countries. All but one track exist in official mono mixes; the exception is [...] "Revolution 9", which was a direct reduction of the stereo master. The Beatles had not been particularly interested in stereo until this album, but after receiving mail from fans stating they bought both stereo and mono mixes of earlier albums, they decided to make the two different. Several mixes have different track lengths; the mono mix/edit of [...] "Helter Skelter" [...] eliminates the <b>fade-in</b> {{at the end of the}} song (and Starr's ending scream), and the fade out of [...] "Yer Blues" [...] is 11 seconds longer on the mono mix.|$|E

50|$|The movie uses several {{visual effects}} {{throughout}} {{to capture the}} emotion of its story, using monochromic filters of red, blue, green, yellow and sepia to show feeling with the silent action which is accompanied by music; the movie also uses <b>fade-ins</b> to achieve this effect, expressing the distinct class divide and captivating the attention of viewers for a two-and-a-half-hour film.|$|R
500|$|The UK {{edition of}} Are You Experienced opened with [...] "Foxy Lady", a track that, with the {{exception}} of a few overdubs, was recorded in one session at CBS. Hendrix wrote the song about Heather Taylor, a highly desirable London socialite who later married the Who's Roger Daltrey. It begins with the <b>fade-in</b> of an F note that Hendrix is bending-up to F while applying generous finger vibrato. Using his guitar's control knob, he slowly increases volume until an audio feedback loop develops and he slides into the song's dominant Fm7 chord. Hendrix used a combination of natural amplifier overdrive and fuzz box effects units to create the song's razor-sharp guitar tone. Its blues–inspired solo—his fourth since arriving in England—used pentatonic scales while showcasing his innovative approach to melody; by exploiting the increased sustain created by overdriving his amplifiers, he moved seamlessly between the middle and high registers with a fluid, singing tone. While author Peter Doggett compared its slow beat to Memphis soul, David Stubbs described the track as a prototype for heavy metal bands such as Black Sabbath.|$|E
500|$|... "Hit the Lights" [...] {{was based}} on an {{unfinished}} Leather Charm song written by Hetfield and Hugh Tanner. Hetfield had brought the majority of the song to Ulrich, and the two worked out different arrangements. Performed at 160 beats per minute, [...] "Hit the Lights" [...] opens with <b>fade-in</b> distorted guitars and a short shriek by Hetfield. The song is driven by the 16th note repeated main riff and the continuous eighth note snare drum hits. The lyrics celebrate heavy metal itself and are sung with short and high pitched vocals. The song ends with several lengthy guitar solos by Hammett, who performed cleaner and more melodic versions of Mustaine's leads. [...] "The Four Horsemen" [...] is a revamp of the Mustaine-penned [...] "The Mechanix", which originally had lyrics about having sex at a gas station. A modified version of his composition with the original lyrics appeared on Megadeth's debut Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good! (1985). Although Mustaine told Metallica not to use any of his music, Hetfield wrote lyrics about the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse and added a bridge and cleanly picked guitar solo in the middle. Mustaine said the bridge was inspired by the main riff in Lynyrd Skynyrd's [...] "Sweet Home Alabama".|$|E
500|$|... "Disposable Heroes" [...] is an anti-war {{song about}} a young soldier whose fate is {{controlled}} by his superiors. With sections performed at 220 beats per minute, {{it is one of}} the most intense tracks on the record. The guitar passage at the end of each verse was Hammett's imitation of the sort of music he found in war films. The syncopated riffing of [...] "Leper Messiah" [...] challenges the hypocrisy of the televangelism that emerged in the 1980s. The song describes how people are willingly turned into blind religious followers who mindlessly do whatever they are told. The 136 beats per minute mid-tempo riffing of the verses culminates in a descending chromatic riff in the chorus; it increases to a galloping 184 beats per minute for the middle section that climaxes in a distorted scream of [...] "Lie!". The title derives from the lyrics to the David Bowie song [...] "Ziggy Stardust". [...] "Orion" [...] is a multipart instrumental highlighting Burton's bass playing. It opens with a <b>fade-in</b> bass section, heavily processed to resemble an orchestra. It continues with mid-tempo riffing, followed by a bass solo at half-tempo. The tempo accelerates during the latter part, and ends with music fading out. Burton arranged the middle section, which features its moody bass line and multipart guitar harmonies. [...] "Damage, Inc." [...] rants about senseless violence and reprisal at an unspecified target. It starts with a series of reversed bass chords based on the chorale prelude of Bach's [...] "Come, Sweet Death". The song then jumps into a rapid rhythm with a pedal-point riff in E that Hammett says was influenced by Deep Purple.|$|E
5000|$|Woolery {{created his}} {{trademark}} phrase, [...] "two and two" [...] on Love Connection (and simultaneously on Scrabble, the daytime game show he hosted on NBC {{during the same}} period).

40|$|A {{new method}} for {{detecting}} shot boundaries in video sequences using metrics {{based on information}} theory is proposed.

There are also three external mixer inputs for effects loops or other sound sources. The mixed level can be modulated by control voltages from an LFO or envelope enabling for example <b>fade-ins</b> while playing the keys.|$|R
2500|$|... "Eight Days a Week" [...] is {{noteworthy}} {{as one of}} the first examples of the in-studio experimentation that the band would use extensively in the future. Over two recording sessions totalling nearly seven hours on 6 October devoted exclusively to this song, Lennon and McCartney tried one technique after another before settling on the eventual arrangement. Each of the first six takes featured a strikingly different approach to the beginning and end sections of the song; the eventual chiming guitar-based introduction was recorded during a different session and edited in later. The song's opening <b>fade-in</b> served as a counterpoint to pop songs that close with a fade out. Hertsgaard writes that the surprise provided by the <b>fade-in</b> was heightened for LP listeners due to the track being sequenced at the start of side two.|$|E
2500|$|The video {{begins with}} a white screen {{followed}} by a <b>fade-in</b> of a close-up of a bald Björk. She passionately sings looking into the camera; as she shakes and moves her head, she begins to morph into a polar bear. Towards {{the end of the}} video, she completely transforms into the [...] "techno-bear", before returning to her original state and the image once again fading-out to white.|$|E
2500|$|The {{released}} recording {{begins with}} a gradual <b>fade-in,</b> creating an effect that author Elliot Huntley describes as [...] "shimmering". Over this introduction and during the mid-song instrumental break, Harrison overdubbed electric guitar solos that mark a rare departure from his traditional preference for slide guitar soloing throughout his post-Beatles solo career. Overdubs on the track, including Harrison's backing vocals and Scott's various horn parts, were completed by 13 September 1976, after Harrison had been waylaid with hepatitis {{for much of the}} summer.|$|E
5000|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} on CD in two editions, which are significantly different. The first edition, with the [...] "glam" [...] cover (illustrated in this article) had the original song order reshuffled, with poorly done fade-outs and <b>fade-ins.</b> This edition also came with a second section, a reunion show with (at least) Stiv Bators and Cheetah Chrome present, from 1987. This edition also had extensive liner notes detailing Bators' trick of singing off-mike, and claims he re-recorded the entire album in one take, from memory, while drunk and in the booth with two groupies - in other words, typical Stiv.|$|R
2500|$|The {{original}} {{show was}} shot on high quality 35 mm film, {{but had to}} be downscaled before editing and postprocessing to standard 80s and 90s TV resolution (video quality) for broadcast. [...] The show's final visual effects (e.g. all exterior shots of the starship Enterprise, phaser fire or beaming <b>fade-ins</b> and -outs) were also composed only in standard resolution video. All previous home video and DVD releases used this severely downscaled version. To include such footage on Blu-ray, using only upscaling, {{would have resulted in}} a larger but blurred image, so CBS decided to use a more detailed approach to bring the show to high-definition. They also opted to adhere to the show's original 4:3 aspect ratio.|$|R

This has been done for many celebrities, including Vincent Schiavelli, Macho Man Randy Savage, Elizabeth Taylor, Alex Toth, Harry Goz, Frank Buckles, Andy Griffith, Neil Armstrong, Johnny Cash, John Ritter, Farrah Fawcett, Michael Jackson, Gary Coleman, Richard Dunn, Steve Jobs, Yogi Berra, Prince, Jimmy [...] "Superfly" [...] Snuka and Charlie Murphy.|$|E
2500|$|George Harrison {{recalled}} that the band {{had become more}} sophisticated about recording techniques: [...] "Our records were progressing. We'd started out like anyone spending their {{first time in a}} studio – nervous and naive and looking for success. By this time we'd had loads of hits and were becoming more relaxed with ourselves, and more comfortable in the studio... We were beginning to do a little overdubbing, too, probably a four-track." [...] The sessions resulted in the first use of a <b>fade-in</b> on a pop song, at the start of [...] "Eight Days a Week", and the first time that guitar feedback had been incorporated in a pop recording, on [...] "I Feel Fine".|$|E
5000|$|The {{completed}} song incorporated another Beatles' first, in that {{it begins}} with a <b>fade-in.</b> [...] "Eight Days a Week" [...] marked {{the first time that a}} <b>fade-in</b> had been used to open a pop song. The instrumentation on the track consists of acoustic guitar, electric guitar, drums, bass and overdubbed handclaps. The <b>fade-in</b> and coda both include guitar overdubs, played by George Harrison on his Rickenbacker 12-string.|$|E
5000|$|Some of {{the musical}} {{highlights}} of the album are the transitions between songs, which often blend into each other.

[...] "The Rifleman" [...] includes a number of spoken verses recorded by everyone {{who was in the}} studio that day, and the <b>fade-ins</b> and -outs to different individuals speaking at the same time was mixed live as it was recorded, ultimately fading out to a snippet of [...] "Render Love," [...] from the band's previous album Diamonds and Rain.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — A {{new method}} for {{detecting}} shot boundaries in video sequences by fusing features obtained by singular value decomposition (SVD) and mutual information (MI) is proposed. The first method relies on performing singular value decomposition on a matrix created from 3 D color histograms of single frames. The method can detect cuts and gradual transitions, such as dissolves, fades and wipes. The second method relies on evaluating mutual information between two consecutive frames. It can detect abrupt cuts, <b>fade-ins</b> and fade-outs with very high accuracy. Combination of features derived from these methods and subsequent processing through a clustering procedure results in very efficient detection of abrupt cuts and gradual transitions, {{as demonstrated by}} experiments on TRECVID 2004 video test set containing different types of shots with significant object and camera motion inside the shots.

40|$|New {{methods for}} {{detecting}} shot boundaries in video sequences and for extracting key frames using metrics {{based on information}} theory are proposed. The method for shot boundary de-tection relies on the mutual information (MI) and the joint entropy (JE) between the frames. It can detect cuts, <b>fade-ins</b> and fade-outs. The detection technique was tested on the TRECVID 2003 video test set having different types of shots and containing significant object and camera motion inside the shots. It is demonstrated that the method detects both fades and abrupt cuts with high accuracy. The information theory measure provides us with better results because it exploits the inter-frame information in a more compact way than frame subtraction. It was also successfully compared to other methods published in literature. The method for key frame extraction uses MI as well. We show that it captures satisfactorily the visual content of the shot...|$|R

5000|$|However, shorter songs {{continued}} to use the fade-out for unclear reasons—for example, Fred Astaire's movie theme [...] "Flying Down to Rio" [...] (1933). Even using fade-out as a segue device doesn't seem obvious, though we certainly {{take it for granted}} today. It is possible that movies were an influence here. <b>Fade-ins</b> and fade-outs are often used as cinematic devices that begin and end scenes; film language that developed {{at the same time as}} these early recordings. The term 'fade-out' itself is of cinematic origin, appearing in print around 1918. And jazz, a favorite of early records, was a popular subject of early movies too. The same could be said for radio productions. Within a single programme of a radio production, many different types of fade can be applied. When mixing from speech to music, there are a few ways that fade can be used. Here are three examples.|$|R
50|$|The US version, {{including}} new scenes produced by Roger Corman, {{and directed by}} Steve Barnett. Members of the original cast, {{as well as new}} actors, were brought to Los Angeles a year later to shoot the additional footage. This version was completed in 1987, and also utilizes Borowczyk's out-takes. The new scenes are quite different from the traditional European style that people expect from Emmanuelle films, and are more in the vein of 80s sex-comedy in the style of Bachelor Party (movie). The attempt was to give the story more cohesion, and tighten the pacing, making it more commercial. No final film print edit was done, it was all put together on 3/4 video with a series of <b>fade-ins</b> and bleeds. After a few years, Corman's New Horizon imprint opted for a home video release in 1992, only available in a full-screen transfer. It never screened theatrically. Available on New Horizons DVD in the US.|$|R
5000|$|A single signal {{can pass}} through {{a large number of}} level {{controls}} - such as an individual channel fader, subgroup master fader, master fader and monitor volume control. According to audio engineer Tomlinson Holman, problems are created due to the multiplicity of the controls. Each and every console has their own dynamic range and it is important to utilize this correctly to avoid excessive noise or distortions. Attacking this problem - of the correct setting for the variety of controls - can be accomplished relatively quickly. Holman refers to the scale of the control as a clue for the solution of this problem. With 0 dB being the nominal setting of the controls, many have a [...] "gain in hand," [...] which goes above 0 dB. This means that one can turn it up from the nominal setting to have something that sounds clear. Other controls, such as sub masters and master level controls, are used for slight trims to the overall section-by-section balance or for the main <b>fade-ins</b> and fade-outs of the overall mix.|$|R

5000|$|Judith Crist, in New York Magazine, wrote [...] "...what {{a delight}} {{to have a chance}} to laugh out loud at sex! Like the burlesque it glorifies - and with tender loving care - this boisterous, colorful, {{wiggling}} eulogy to the Lower East Side bump-and-grind culture of the 1920s is plotless, frenetic, funny and just as good as the real thing. It's nostalgic as all get out to see the lumpy dumpy chorus, the snorers and the leerers and the lechers around the runway, the Crazy House bit and the spielers and, beyond the theater, the East Side in its glory from the barrels of half-sours to the knishes to the Murphy-bedded hotel rooms. Director William Friedkin (this was his pre-The Birthday Party film) proves his sense of cinema again by remarkable intersplicing of newsreels and striking use of black-and-white <b>fade-ins</b> to color."

5000|$|On November 1, 1926, Sally Hamlin signed another {{contract}} with Victor, {{this one for}} a two-year period. While her earlier recordings had been made with the acoustic recording process, this group of sides was recorded electrically, and issued as Victor [...] "Orthophonic" [...] 78s. She re-recorded some of her previous readings, utilizing the new electrical recording process, and added some new titles such as [...] "The Little Kitten That Would Not Wash Its Face" [...] and Lewis Carroll's Jabberwocky. Among this group is her record of [...] "The Night Before Christmas" [...] and [...] "The Shoemaker And The Elves". This record contains perhaps the first instance of sampling in a commercial recording. Sally's readings of these two famous Christmas pieces contains musical <b>fade-ins</b> from other records in Victor's back catalogue (among them, Elsie Baker's record of [...] "Silent Night"). Although it was surely done as a cost-cutting measure, being cheaper than hiring an orchestra or a pianist, it nevertheless is sampling by definition. None of Sally Hamlin's work has ever been reissued commercially on long-playing records, or compact discs.|$|R
30|$|Video shot {{boundaries}} can {{be classified}} into two types: abrupt shot boundary (ASB) (as in Fig. 2) and gradual shot boundary (GSB), according to a certain classification of scene transition, which in general is related to content variation over time. This is common in 2 D and 3 D video, {{despite the fact that}} scene transition in 3 D video may include depth changes besides the visual content itself. In ASB, the scene transition occurs over very few frames, usually a single frame defines the boundary. In the case of GSB, the transition takes place gradually over a short span of frames. The most common gradual transitions are <b>fade-ins,</b> fade-outs, dissolves and wipes [26 – 28]. A common problem in SBD is the correct discrimination between camera operations and object motion that originate the gradual transitions, since the temporal variation of the frame content can be of the same order of magnitude and take place over the same number of frames. This similarity of visual effects caused by camera operations and object motion can induce false detections of gradual shot boundaries. This problem is aggravated for video sequences with intense motion.|$|R
