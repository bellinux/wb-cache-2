500|$|Kate Mulgrew {{suggested}} that the show incorporate a new and stronger antagonist, saying: [...] "We need [...] to encounter enemies of such ferocity, enemies who in fact are quite lethal and frightening. Enemies that you would watch and say, 'Oh, boy, <b>how</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> {{going to get out}} of this one?' I don't think the Kazon hit the bill." [...] Mulgrew felt the crew's mission to get home was a more compelling storyline than those related to the Kazon, whom she criticized as [...] "great big stupid giants".|$|E
2500|$|Dr. Clifford Young, {{who oversees}} federal {{relations}} for California State University San Bernardino, {{estimates that the}} school has received $60 million to $70 million for earmarked projects since it retained Copeland Lowery in late 1999. Since hiring the firm, the university has paid the firm about $490,000, according to disclosure reports initially filed by Copeland Lowery; university records showed $702,500 paid. As the earmarks started arriving, Young began receiving calls from other universities and from town and county governments across the Inland Empire of central and southern California. [...] "They were asking, 'Who are you using (in Washington)? What are they doing for you? <b>How</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> doing it for you?' I {{get a lot of}} those calls." ...|$|E
2500|$|Weeks later, on 10 April, Franklin {{wrote to}} Crick for {{permission}} to see their model. Franklin retained her scepticism for premature model building even after seeing the Watson-Crick model, and remained unimpressed. She {{is reported to have}} commented, [...] "It's very pretty, but <b>how</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> going to prove it?" [...] As an experimental scientist, Franklin seems to have been interested in producing far greater evidence before publishing-as-proven a proposed model. As such, her response to the Watson-Crick model was in keeping with her cautious approach to science. Most of the scientific community hesitated several years before accepting the double helix proposal. At first mainly geneticists embraced the model because of its obvious genetic implications.|$|E

2500|$|Needing {{a channel}} to sell Town Coopers and LCBL merchandise, Mahrt looked {{to create an}} online marketplace. He {{launched}} [...] in August 2013. The boutique site is designed to exclusively carry premium baseball brands like Victory and 22Fresh. Mahrt desired an interface unlike the typical online sporting goods store; one that would operate more like CNET does for the computer industry. He would ask, [...] "when a retail chain shows a parent over 60 youth bats, <b>how</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> supposed to pick one?" [...] Countless new offerings inundate the consumer each year, so Gourmet Baseball aims to streamline the buying process with rankings based on user testing. Mahrt's site carries only the top-rated products, showcasing the niche brands, and never offers models from the previous year.|$|E
2500|$|Fifty {{motions to}} reopen divorce cases {{that had been}} handled by Garson were {{received}} by New York's chief administrative judge for matrimonial cases. Of those, three or four were granted a hearing, and eventually settled. However, even in cases that involved both Garson and Siminovsky, rulings were not necessarily reviewed or overturned. To receive a hearing, parties were required to demonstrate some likelihood {{that they had not}} received a fair trial. Criticizing a process that required parties who did not have subpoena powers or wiretaps to prove corruption in each case, the President of the New York State chapter of the National Organization for Women said: [...] "The burden of proof is going to fall on them to show the case is corrupted; and <b>how</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> going to do that?" ...|$|E
2500|$|... {{this movie}} is about visuals. It's about excitement, it's about thrills. Don't worry about the script... I {{remember}} mentioning it to six or seven people that the script was trashy and I always got the same answer... The script doesn't matter. This movie is about visuals... Then {{we go to the}} first edit, the first cut of the movie in the screening room and it's [...] Iovine and me and Joel Silver... And about 20 minutes into the movie Jimmy turns to me and he goes... {{this movie is}} really shitty isn't it? It's really bad. I said, yeah, it's a really bad script. Why didn't anyone notice that the script was bad? It stinks. I can't even watch it... Joel's on the other side going, what am I gonna do next? There's gotta be a next project, and they're sitting there and there's so many lessons I learned during that movie. It went $14 million over budget, I think and I kept saying to Joel, <b>how</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> allowing this? 'Cause they kept screaming at us, it's over the budget. I said, how, and they, you've gotta understand, they built all, Walter Hill didn't want to go to Chicago. The story took place in Chicago, so they built Chicago in LA.|$|E
