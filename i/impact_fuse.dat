2500|$|According to the IDF, {{the weapons}} were {{accompanied}} by user manuals in Persian. The packing slip for the 60mm mortar also included a range table for use with a model AZ111-A2 <b>impact</b> <b>fuse,</b> made exclusively by Iran. In an attempt to mislead would-be inspectors, [...] "Made in Britain" [...] labels were attached {{to all of the}} crates.|$|E
2500|$|Developed during 1942 by the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), {{under the}} {{direction}} of Charles Christian Lauritsen, in response to a requirement by the United States Navy for a rocket capable of being launched from landing craft to provide fire support during amphibious landings, the 4.5-Inch BBR was an improved version of the Mousetrap anti-submarine rocket system, using the Mousetrap's Mk 3 rocket motor mated to a [...] general purpose aerial bomb. An <b>impact</b> <b>fuse</b> was mounted in the nose of the rocket, with an annular fin assembly providing stability. A modified, larger version of the Beach Barrage Rocket, using the Mk 9 rocket motor, was also produced, being introduced into service in late 1944.|$|E

5000|$|Impact: Examples of grenades {{fitted with}} <b>impact</b> <b>fuses</b> are the German M1913 and M1915 Diskushandgranate, and any British grenade fitted with the Allways fuse {{such as the}} No 69 grenade, No 77 grenade and No 82 grenade (Gammon bomb).|$|R
5|$|The {{failure of}} the {{majority}} of the shells to detonate may have had various causes. As the submarines fired armour piercing shells, intended for use against steel ship hulls, the relatively softer brick walls may have failed to trigger the <b>impact</b> <b>fuses.</b> Sea water may have degraded the shells, which the Japanese had stored in deck lockers for several weeks. The age of the shells may also have been a factor; some of the shells recovered from the Newcastle bombardment were found to be of English manufacture; surplus munitions from World War I.|$|R
2500|$|The LCA(HR) ('Hedgerow') {{was another}} support weapon variant. The troop well was filled by a Hedgehog spigot mortar weapon. The {{additional}} weight of this weapon {{and the force}} it placed on the craft when fired required strengthening of the well floor. This was the same Hedgehog used in anti-submarine warfare {{with the addition of}} <b>impact</b> <b>fuse</b> extensions in the projectile nose to detonate the warheads above ground - it fired 24 bombs arranged in four rows of six, each bomb containing about [...] of explosive. When fired successfully the bomb pattern was a 100-yard circle about 250 yards forward. The bombs would clear paths through mines and wire on the beach. Using this principle of 'counter-mining' - the explosions from mortar rounds setting off the mines both above and below the water's edge, proved very successful. They were used at Salerno and Normandy. Later in the war, the US built a similar craft the [...] "Woofus" [...] based on the LCM.|$|E

2500|$|... (d) The {{distribution}} of point impact detonations and air bursts makes it improbable that <b>impact</b> <b>fuses</b> and proximity fuses {{were employed in}} random order, as stated by the Israeli forces. (e) There were no impacts in the second target area which the Israeli forces claim to have shelled. (f) Contrary to repeated denials, two Israeli helicopters and a remotely piloted vehicle {{were present in the}} Qana area {{at the time of the}} shelling. While the possibility cannot be ruled out completely, it is unlikely that the shelling of the United Nations compound was the result of gross technical and/or procedural errors.|$|R

5000|$|The Gammon bomb or grenade was an [...] "improvised hand-thrown bomb {{used by the}} Home Guard, the Special Air Service and the Resistance, {{especially}} {{suitable for}} the destruction of aircraft or vehicles. An explosive charge was wrapped in fabric and sewn to an <b>impact</b> <b>fuse</b> that detonated on sharp contact".|$|E
50|$|The Royal Laboratory {{developed}} the No 1 Grenade in 1908. It contained explosive material {{with an iron}} fragmentation band, with an <b>impact</b> <b>fuse,</b> detonating when {{the top of the}} grenade hit the ground. A long cane handle (approximately 16 inches) allowed the user to throw the grenade further than the blast of the explosion.|$|E
50|$|On impact a {{piezoelectric}} <b>impact</b> <b>fuse</b> in {{the rocket}} triggers the shaped charge warhead, which can penetrate up to 400 millimeters of armour. The fuse is sensitive enough {{to trigger the}} warhead at impact angles up to 70 degrees from the vertical. After firing, the spent rocket container {{is removed from the}} launcher, and a fresh tube is attached.|$|E

5000|$|The MIM-23B to M {{versions}} are 5.03 m long, {{have a body}} diameter of 0.37 m and, with a larger warhead of 75 kg, weighing 638 kg at launch. An improved motor, with a total weight of 395 kg including 295 kg of propellant, increases the maximum range of the MIM-23B to M versions to 35 km and maximum engagement altitude to 18000 m. The minimum range is reduced to 1.5 km. The MIM-23B has a peak velocity of around 500 m/s. The missile is fitted with both radio frequency proximity and <b>impact</b> <b>fuses.</b> The guidance system uses an X-band CW monopulse semi-active radar seeker. The missile can maneuver at 15 g.|$|R
5000|$|According to the IDF, {{the weapons}} were {{accompanied}} by user manuals in Persian. The packing slip for the 60mm mortar also included a range table for use with a model AZ111-A2 <b>impact</b> <b>fuse,</b> made exclusively by Iran.

5000|$|Three [...] "Hedgerow" [...] flotillas of {{specialized}} Landing Craft Assault boats carrying the Hedgehog instead of troops were {{used during the}} Normandy landings. An addition of <b>impact</b> <b>fuse</b> extensions in the projectile noses enabled detonating the warheads above ground. The bombs were used to clear 100-yard-wide paths through mines and barbed wire obstacles on the beach.|$|E
50|$|Early designs {{allowed the}} pilot to escape {{after the final}} {{acceleration}} toward the target. There is no record of any pilot attempting to escape or intending to do so, and this provision was dropped from later Kaitens, so that, once inside, the pilot could not unlock the hatches. The Kaiten was fitted with a self-destruct control, intended for use if an attack failed or the <b>impact</b> <b>fuse</b> failed.|$|E
5000|$|Until {{this time}} the British, at RAF insistence, {{continued}} their World War I use of machine guns, and introduced twin MG mountings for AAAD. The army was forbidden from considering anything larger than [...]50-inch. However, in 1935 their trials showed that the minimum effective round was an <b>impact</b> <b>fused</b> 2 lb HE shell. The following year they decided to adopt the Bofors 40 mm and a twin barrel Vickers 2-pdr (40 mm) on a modified naval mount. The air-cooled Bofors was vastly superior for land use, being much lighter than the water-cooled pom-pom, and UK production of the Bofors 40 mm was licensed. The Predictor AA No 3, as the Kerrison Predictor was officially known, was introduced with it.|$|R
5000|$|... "B" [...] 6.6 kg with 0.66 kg of Picric {{acid and}} dinitro and M88 <b>impact</b> or delay <b>fuse.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{bouncing}} grenade, the VOG-25P, is also available. On impact, a small {{charge in}} {{the nose of the}} grenade is detonated; this raises the grenade 0.5 to 1.5 m in the air, before an <b>impact</b> delay <b>fuse</b> detonates it. The VOG-25P also has a lethal radius of 6 meters.|$|R
5000|$|... 20 Ã— 110 mm TZO M57 {{explosive}} torch cartridge (with {{and without}} illuminator): Chrome-yellow paint with earth-red {{ring in the}} upper third of the grenades and a green ring above the guide ring. The granary is made of steel and has a Trotile explosive filling inside the center, which ignites when a target is hit. The sensitive AZZ UT M57 headlamp screwed onto the grenade is an explosive <b>impact</b> <b>fuse</b> with a self-disengaging device which starts after 4.5 to 9.5 seconds.|$|E
50|$|Overall the RPG-43 was {{an awkward}} and {{difficult}} weapon to use effectively. To use it, the user had to get within throwing range of an enemy tank, which was often dangerous. Despite having a powerful warhead, it took a skilled user {{to make the most}} of it as, like all shaped-charge weapons, it was effective only if the striking angle was close to 90 degrees. It also had to hit hard enough to detonate the <b>impact</b> <b>fuse,</b> or it would bounce harmlessly off the tank.|$|E
50|$|The missile {{used by the}} RBS 23 {{system is}} based on the RBS 70, but unlike its {{predecessor}} (which is laser beam rider) it is a radar command control missile, which means that the missile itself and the target have to be tracked by the fire control radar until impact. A booster has been added also. The missile is claimed to have high acceleration and high manoeuvrability. It is equipped with a fragmentation and shaped charge warhead and with both a proximity fuse and an <b>impact</b> <b>fuse.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In the 1980s the Spanish firm Esperanza y Cia {{developed}} a 120mm caliber mortar bomb which contained 21 anti-armor submunitions. What made the 120mm [...] "Espin" [...] unique was the electrical <b>impact</b> <b>fusing</b> system which totally eliminated dangerous duds. The system operates on a capacitor in each submunition which is charged by a wind generator {{in the nose}} of the projectile after being fired. If for what ever reason the electrical fuse fails to function on impact, approximately 5 minutes later the capacitor bleeds out, therefore neutralizing the submunition's electronic fuse system. Later a similar mortar round was offered in the 81mm caliber and equipped some Spanish Marine units. On signing the Wellington Declaration on Cluster Munitions, Spain withdrew both the 81mm and 120mm [...] "Espin" [...] rounds from its military units.|$|R
5|$|Religious music, {{influenced}} by American gospel, {{has become an}} important part of Dominican popular music in the 1990s. Calypso has also retained much popularity in Dominica, as has Jazz. The band <b>Impact</b> has <b>fused</b> jazz with Caribbean music. Other styles include steelpan, which has declined popularity despite the efforts of groups like Dancehall.|$|R
50|$|Barrel {{bombs are}} cheap to produce, {{potentially}} costing {{as little as}} $200 to $300. They {{can be used with}} any type of aircraft including non-military cargo planes. The explosive payload {{can be as simple as}} fertilizer and diesel. The bomb may contain metal shrapnel such as nuts and bolts or even chemicals such as chlorine. The bomb is barrel-shaped and might be made from improvised material or specially designed. The early versions in Syria used lit fuses and thus had to be carefully timed, otherwise they would fail to explode before breaking apart on the ground or explode too soon in the air. Later models had <b>impact</b> <b>fuses</b> and stabilizing fins which were improved on over time. Earlier barrel bombs also weighed less (100-300 pounds/45-150 kg), while later versions range from 1,000 pounds (454 kg) to 1 ton(ne).|$|R
