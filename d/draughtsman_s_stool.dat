40|$|Abstract Background Children 2 ̆ 019 <b>s</b> <b>stool</b> {{disposal}} {{is often}} overlooked in sanitation programs of any country. Unsafe disposal of children 2 ̆ 019 <b>s</b> <b>stool</b> makes children susceptible to many diseases that transmit through faecal-oral route. Therefore, the study {{aims to examine}} the magnitude of unsafe disposal of children 2 ̆ 019 <b>s</b> <b>stools</b> in India, the factors associated with it and finally its association with childhood diarrhea. Methods Data from {{the third round of}} the National Family Health Survey (NFHS- 3) conducted in 20052 ̆ 01306 is used to carry out the analysis. The binary logistic regression model is used to examine the factors associated with unsafe disposal of children 2 ̆ 019 <b>s</b> <b>stool.</b> Binary logistic regression is also used to examine the association between unsafe disposal of children 2 ̆ 019 <b>s</b> <b>stool</b> and childhood diarrhea.

40|$|Circoviruses {{are known}} to infect birds and pigs and can cause {{a wide range of}} severe {{symptoms}} with significant economic impact. Using viral metagenomics, we identified circovirus-like DNA sequences and characterized 15 circular viral DNA genomes in stool samples from humans in Pakistan, Nigeria, Tunisia, and the United States and from wild chimpanzees. Distinct genomic features and phylogenetic analysis indicate that some viral genomes were part of a previously unrecognized genus in the Circoviridae family we tentatively named "Cyclovirus" whose genetic diversity is comparable to that of all the known species in the Circovirus genus. Circoviridae detection in the <b>stools</b> of U. <b>S.</b> adults was limited to porcine circoviruses which were also found in most U. S. pork products. To determine whether the divergent cycloviruses found in non-U. <b>S.</b> human <b>stools</b> were of dietary origin, we genetically compared them to the cycloviruses in muscle tissue samples of commonly eaten farm animals in Pakistan and Nigeria. Limited genetic overlap between cycloviruses in human stool samples and local cow, goat, sheep, camel, and chicken meat samples indicated {{that the majority of the}} 25 Cyclovirus species identified might be human viruses. We show that the genetic diversity of small circular DNA viral genomes in various mammals, including humans, is significantly larger than previously recognized, and frequent exposure through meat consumption and contact with animal or human feces provides ample opportunities for cyclovirus transmission. Determining the role of cycloviruses, found in 7 to 17 % of non-U. <b>S.</b> human <b>stools</b> and 3 to 55 % of non-U. S. meat samples tested, in both human and animal diseases is now facilitated by knowledge of their genomes...|$|R

40|$|To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} of oral gentamicin with nalidixic acid {{in the treatment of}} acute shigellosis, we studied, in a double blind-trial, 79 comparable children with bloody diarrhoea of less than 72 h duration. Of them Shigella spp. were isolated in 71 patients. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either gentamicin 30 mg/kg/day or nalidixic acid 60 mg/kg/day, both given orally in four equal doses for <b>S</b> days. <b>Stool</b> frequency differed significantly between the groups from day two until completion of the study. Treatment failure was observed in 14 (42 per cent) patients receiving oral gentamicin compared to none of those with nalidixic acid-sensitive strains of Shigella spp. (P= 0. 0002). Although all the shigella isolates were sensitive to gentamicin in vitro, 19 (58 per cent) patients on gentamicin therapy failed to eliminate shigella organisms from stool, compared to none in the nalidixic acid treated group infected with nalidixic acid-sensitive Shigella spp. (P< 0. 001). One patient in each group had a bacteriological relapse. We conclude that gentamicin given orally was therapeutically ineffective in the treatment of acute shigellosis...|$|R
40|$|The {{popularity}} of the endorectal pullthrough {{for the treatment of}} benign mucosal diseases of the rectum has created a controversy regarding the need for a reservoir. The four currently advocated procedures, the straight endorectal anastomosis, the J pouch, the S pouch, and the lateral isoperistaltic ileal reservoir were evaluated in a puppy model with four animals in each experimental group. Measurement of rectal capacitance showed that all groups achieved 80 - 85 % of control values at 6 months after surgery. Intestinal transit time decreased by one-half in all groups. Stool consistency, stool culture, water, and electrolyte absorption did not show any statistical superiority of one group over another. Stool frequency varied widely at 6 months; 10 stools per 8 -hour period were counted in the lateral reservoir group versus 25 with the J pouches, and 16 with the straight and <b>S</b> groups. <b>Stool</b> frequency did not correlate with transit time, stool consistency, or rectal capacitance. Barium enemas showed that straight pullthroughs more closely resembled the measurements of the normal animal's endorectal canal.

40|$|The present {{work was}} {{undertaken}} to evaluate antidiarrheal activity of ethanolic leaf extract of Dissotis multiflora (Sm) Triana (D. multiflora) on Shigella flexneri-induced diarrhea in Wistar rats and its subacute toxicity. Diarrhea was induced by oral administration of 1. 2 × 109 cells/mL S. flexneri to rats. Antidiarrheal activity {{was investigated in}} rats with the doses of 111. 42 [*]mg/kg, 222. 84 [*]mg/kg, and 445. 68 [*]mg/kg. The level of biochemical parameters was assessed and organs histology examined by 14 days’ subacute toxicity. <b>S.</b> flexneri <b>stool</b> load decreased significantly in dose-dependent manner. The level of ALT increased (p< 0. 05) in male rats treated with the dose of 445. 68 [*]mg/kg while creatinine level increased in rats treated with both doses. In female rats, a significant decrease (p< 0. 05) {{of the level of}} AST and creatinine was noted in rats treated with the dose of 222. 84 [*]mg/kg of D. multiflora. Histological exams of kidney and liver of treated rats showed architectural modifications at the dose of 445. 68 [*]mg/kg.

40|$|Eleven diarrheal stool {{specimens}} and 10 control stool specimens from Cairo, Egypt, {{were studied}} by frequency-pulsed electron capture gas-liquid chromatography (FPEC-GLC). Four cases involving Shigella sonnei, three cases involving Shigella boydii, and four cases involving Shigella flexneri were studied. The aqueous stools were centrifuged, extracted with organic solvents, and derivatized to form specific electron-capturing derivatives of carboxylic acids, alcohols, hydroxy acids, and amines. Analyses {{were performed on}} high-resolution glass columns with an instrument equipped with an extremely sensitive electron capture detector that is specific {{for the detection of}} electron-capturing compounds. The diarrheal stools studied had specific FPEC-GLC profiles and contained metabolic markers that readily distinguished between the Shigella spp. studied and Escherichia coli producing heat-stable or heat-labile enterotoxins. <b>S.</b> sonnei <b>stools</b> contained hexanoic acid, 2 -hydroxy- 4 -methylmethiobutyric acid, and some unidentified alcohols that distinguished this organism from other enteric pathogens. S. boydii produced an acid that was unique for this species, and S. flexneri produced alcohols {{that could be used to}} distinguish between it and other enteric organisms. The FPEC-GLC profiles obtained during this study were also very different from those reported earlier for Clostridium difficile and rotavirus. This study presents further evidence that the selectivity and sensitivity of FPEC-GLC techniques can be used to rapidly identify causative agents of diarrhea and detect physiological changes that occur in the gut during the course of diarrheal illness...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The use of {{real-time}} polymerase {{chain reaction}} (PCR) for detection of Strongyloides stercoralis in stool has recently been described. We compared five DNA extraction methods by using normal human stool spiked with Strongyloides ratti and tested by using a real-time PCR. The PowerSoil kit {{was found to be}} the best technique in terms of sensitivity and ease of use. The PCR detected DNA extracted from one spiked S. ratti larva diluted 10 − 2. The PowerSoil kit was then used to extract DNA from 160 human survey samples. All culture positive specimens with a high and moderate larval load were identified by real-time PCR, but only 15 % of specimens with low larval load were positive. Specificity was greater than 99 %. The combination of the PowerSoil kit and real-time PCR reliably detected high to moderate larval numbers of <b>S.</b> stercoralis in <b>stools</b> but was less sensitive when the larval load was low...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn recent years, Staphylococcus aureus {{has become}} a common bowel colonizer in Swedish infants. We aimed to {{identify}} host factors that determine such colonization. Stool samples from 100 Italian and 100 Swedish infants were obtained on seven occasions {{during the first year}} of life and cultured quantitatively for S. aureus. In a subgroup of infants in each cohort, individual strains were identified by random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis. Colonization at each time-point was related to delivery mode, siblings in family and antibiotic treatment. In total, 66 % of the Italian and 78 % of the Swedish infants had S. aureus in their stools on at least one time-point (p 0. 08) and 4 % of Italian and 27 % of Swedish infants were positive on at least six of the seven time-points investigated (p 0. 0001). Most infants analysed regarding strain carriage harboured a single strain in their microbiota for several months. The <b>S.</b> aureus <b>stool</b> populations in colonized infants decreased from 107 to 104 colony-forming units/g between 1 week and 1 year of age in both cohorts. In multivariate analysis, the strongest predictor for S. aureus colonization was being born in Sweden (OR 3. 4 at 1 week of age, p 0. 002). Having (an) elder sibling(s) increased colonization at peak phase (OR 1. 8 at 6 months, p 0. 047). Antibiotic treatment was more prevalent among Italian infants and correlated negatively with S. aureus colonization at 6 months of age (OR 0. 3, p 0. 01). To conclude, S. aureus is a more common gut colonizer in Swedish than Italian infants, a fact that could not be attributed to feeding or delivery mode...|$|R

Strongyloidiasis stercoralis was identified in the stool of 69 (8. 7 %) of 792 participants. Six hundred nine sera were tested using by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which had a sensitivity of 92 % and a specificity of 94 %; 442 (72 %) were positive. In multivariable logistic regression models, having <b>S.</b> stercoralis in <b>stool</b> was associated with hookworm in the same specimen (odds ratio [OR] 4. 44, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 2. 02 – 9. 79), occasionally or never wearing shoes (OR 1. 89, 95 % CI 1. 10 – 3. 27), and increasing age (OR 1. 012 for each one-year increase, 95 % CI 1. 00 – 1. 03).

40|$|The use of {{anaerobic}} incubation for {{the culture}} of Streptococcus pneumoniae from sputum was compared with incubation in carbon dioxide in air. A coagglutination test for pneumococcal antigen {{was used as an}} index of the number of specimens containing pneumococci. A total of 334 specimens were examined. There was evidence of pneumococcal colonisation by culture or coagglutination, or both, in 48 (14. 37 %), of which 41 (12. 27 %) yielded S pneumoniae on culture. Anaerobic incubation was better than incubation in carbon dioxide in air for the primary culture of S pneumoniae from sputum. Primary isolation of S pneumoniae was achieved in 11 of the 41 strains (26. 82 %) by anaerobic incubation alone, by incubation only in carbon dioxide in air in one strain (2. 43 %), and by both anaerobic incubation and incubation in carbon dioxide in air in 29 strains (70. 73 %). Anaerobic incubation gave large moist or mucoid colonies that were easy to recognise, but it suppressed the typical <b>draughtsman</b> colony of <b>S</b> pneumoniae. The factor V supplement routinely used in our medium also inhibited the formation of draughtsman colonies. It is suggested that draughtsman colonies occur because of a relative lack of the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (factor V), which is required as a reducing agent in aspartate and glutamate metabolism. This nutritional deficiency may lead to bacterial cell wall defect and hence to the autolysis which gives the typical draughtsman colony...|$|R
40|$|A {{multiplex}} real-time PCR assay for {{the detection}} and quantification of Schistosoma mansoni and S. haematobium DNA in faecal samples was developed and evaluated as an alternative diagnostic method to study the epidemiology of schistosomiasis. Primers and probes targeting the cytochrome c oxidase gene were designed for species-specific amplification and were combined with an internal control. Using positive control DNA extracted from adult Schistosoma worms and negative control samples (n= 150) with DNA {{from a wide range}} of intestinal microorganisms, the method proved to be sensitive and 100 % specific. For further evaluation, duplicate stool specimens with varying S. mansoni egg loads were collected in northern Senegal from pre-selected individuals (n= 88). The PCR cycle threshold values, reflecting parasite-specific DNA loads in faeces, showed significant correlation with microscopic egg counts both for <b>S.</b> mansoni in <b>stool</b> and <b>S.</b> haematobium in urine. The Schistosoma detection rate of PCR (84. 1 %) was similar to that of microscopy performed on duplicate stool samples (79. 5 %).

40|$|Cellular and humoral immune {{responsiveness}} in 44 Sudanese {{children with}} schistosomiasis was studied {{and related to}} the intensity of infection. The parasite load was quantitated by accurate assessment of the excretion of ova of S. mansoni and <b>S.</b> haematobium in <b>stool</b> and urine, respectively. Lymphocyte subpopulations (T 3 +, T 4 +, T 8 +, TAC+, HNK 1 +, Ia+, SIg+, LGL+, ANAE+) as well as specific IgE and IgG antibodies to adult schistosome antigens were determined. The relationships existing between intensity of infection and cellular and humoral immune responsiveness revealed a distinct pattern of anti-parasite immunity: The percentage of pan-T cells (T 3 +) and the T helper (T 4 +) :T suppressor (T 8 +) ratio were inversely correlated to the intensity of infection. In contrast, the percentage of T suppressor cells positively correlated to the parasite load. Ia+, TAC+, HNK 1 + and T 4 + cell counts did not show a significant relationship to worm burden. Specific IgE and IgG antibodies to S. mansoni and S. haematobium adult worm antigen clearly increased with the parasite load. The dichotomy of decreased T cell parameters and increased antibody response in heavily infected individuals represents a unique feature in helminthic infections...|$|R
40|$|The {{unprecedented}} {{increase in}} number of African refugees arriving in Europe is confronting clinicians and general practitioners {{with the question of}} whether or not and how to screen migrants from endemic regions for Schistosoma mansoni infection.; We assessed the accuracy of 3 different diagnostic tests for <b>S.</b> mansoni infection (<b>stool</b> microscopy [samples prepared by sedimentation technique], serology, and point-of-care circulating cathodic antigen [POC-CCA] urine cassette test) in 107 newly arrived asymptomatic Eritrean refugees in Switzerland.; Sixty-three study participants (59 %) tested positive by at least 1 of the 3 methods. Thirty-seven participants (35 %) were considered to have active schistosomiasis, either due to the detection of parasite eggs in stool and/or the presence of a concordant positive serology and urine POC-CCA test, which we consider to be a suitable surrogate marker of active infection. Of 23 microscopy-positive participants, 22 were positive by serology (95. 7 % sensitivity) and 21 were positive by the urine POC-CCA test (91. 3 % sensitivity). The combination of serology and urine POC-CCA testing detected all 23 microscopy-positive study participants (100 % sensitivity).; With a sensitivity of 100 % (95 % confidence interval, 82. 2 %- 100 %), the combination of serology plus urine POC-CCA testing appears to be the most sensitive screening option for asymptomatic S. mansoni infection in Eritrean refugees, compared with stool sedimentation microscopy...|$|R
40|$|Background—Patients who {{complain}} of constipation {{can be divided}} into those who have lost the natural call to stool, but develop abdominal discomfort after several days without a bowel movement (no urge); and those who experience a constant sensation of incomplete evacuation (urge).  Aims—To determine whether the two groups differ in symptoms, colonic transit, and perceptual responses to controlled rectal distension.  Methods—Forty four patients with constipation were evaluated with a bowel symptom questionnaire, colonic transit (radiopaque markers), and rectal balloon distension. <b>Stool</b> (<b>S)</b> and discomfort (D) thresholds to slow ramp (40 ml/min) and rapid phasic distension (870 ml/min) were determined with an electronic distension device. Fifteen healthy controls were also studied.  Results—All patients had Rome positive irritable bowel syndrome (IBS); 17 were no urge and 27 urge. Mean D threshold to phasic rectal distensions was 28 (3) mm Hg in no urge, 27 (3) mm Hg in urge (NS), but higher in the control group (46 (2) mm Hg; p< 0. 01). Sixty seven per cent of no urge and 69 % of urge were hypersensitive for D. Slow ramp distension thresholds were higher in no urge (S: 26 (3); D: 45 (4) mm Hg) compared with urge (S: 16 (2); D: 31 (3) mm Hg; p< 0. 01), or with controls (S: 15 (1); D: 30 (3); p< 0. 01).  Conclusions—Hyposensitivity to slow rectal distension is found in patients with IBS {{who complain}} of constipation and have lost the call to stool even though their sensitivity to phasic distension is increased. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{long term}} project {{examines}} {{how we are}} currently engaging with both forests and woodlands {{in different parts of}} the world. Forests are both carbon sinks and carbon stores, so they can ameliorate the effects of climate change by keeping soil in place, locking carbon into this soil, and through absorbing carbon dioxide and pollution from the atmosphere. They also provide building materials and can provide heat through firewood. So any forest is a good thing, whether it is a managed forest (or tree farm), or one left to its own devices. There is an increasing trend towards ‘wilding’ woodlands – by letting the trees grow, rather than being ‘grown’. All aspects of the installation involve wood in one form or other. The trees are made from wooden cocktail sticks and the printed paper images of the trees’ foliage come from archetypal drawings of the specific species. They are embedded in giant Encyclopaedia Britannica books (1904), which are stacked on top of wooden stools – the managed forest stool is from Ikea, the ‘wilding’ forest in a 1930 <b>s</b> beech wood <b>stool.</b> The identical encyclopaedia are open at the hybridism page. The installation features two miniature woodlands embedded in books, one showing a miniature managed forest of Sitka pines; the other a mixed native deciduous woodland.

40|$|Abstract Background Intestinal {{colonization}} by Staphylococcus aureus among {{hospitalized patients}} {{has been associated}} with increased risk of staphylococcal infection and could potentially contribute to transmission. We hypothesized that S. aureus intestinal colonization is associated with increased frequency of S. aureus on patients' skin and nearby environmental surfaces. Methods Selected inpatients were cultured weekly for <b>S.</b> aureus from <b>stool,</b> nares, skin (groin and axilla), and environmental surfaces (bed rail and bedside table). Investigator's hands were cultured after contacting the patients' skin and the environmental surfaces. Results Of 71 subjects, 32 (45. 1 %) had negative nares and stool cultures, 23 (32. 4 %) had positive nares and stool cultures, 13 (18. 3 %) were nares carriers only, and 3 (4. 2 %) were stool carriers only. Of the 39 patients with S. aureus carriage, 30 (76. 9 %) had methicillin-resistant isolates. In comparison to nares colonization only, nares and intestinal colonization was associated with increased frequency of positive skin cultures (41 % versus 77 %; p = 0. 001) and trends toward increased environmental contamination (45 % versus 62 %; p = 0. 188) and acquisition on investigator's hands (36 % versus 60 %; p = 0. 057). Patients with negative nares and stool cultures had low frequency of S. aureus on skin and the environment (4. 8 % and 11. 3 %, respectively). Conclusion We found that hospitalized patients with S. aureus nares and/or stool carriage frequently had S. aureus on their skin and on nearby environmental surfaces. S. aureus intestinal colonization was associated with increased frequency of positive skin cultures, which could potentially facilitate staphylococcal infections and nosocomial transmission. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{describes}} a real-time PCR approach with high resolution melting-curve (HRM) assay {{developed for the}} detection and differentiation of Schistosoma mansoni and S. haematobium in fecal and urine samples collected from rural Yemen. The samples were screened by microscopy and PCR for the Schistosoma species infection. A pair of degenerate primers were designed targeting partial regions in the cytochrome oxidase subunit I (cox 1) gene of S. mansoni and S. haematobium using real-time PCR-HRM assay. The overall prevalence of schistosomiasis was 31. 8 %; 23. 8 % {{of the participants were}} infected with S. haematobium and 9. 3 % were infected with S. mansoni. With regards to the intensity of infections, 22. 1 % and 77. 9 % of S. haematobium infections were of heavy and light intensities, respectively. Likewise, 8. 1 %, 40. 5 % and 51. 4 % of S. mansoni infections were of heavy, moderate and light intensities, respectively. The melting points were distinctive for S. mansoni and S. haematobium, categorized by peaks of 76. 49 ± 0. 25 °C and 75. 43 ± 0. 26 °C, respectively. HRM analysis showed high detection capability through the amplification of Schistosoma DNA with as low as 0. 0001 ng/µL. Significant negative correlations were reported between the real-time PCR-HRM cycle threshold (Ct) values and microscopic egg counts for both <b>S.</b> mansoni in <b>stool</b> and <b>S.</b> haematobium in urine (p < 0. 01). In conclusion, this closed-tube HRM protocol provides a potentially powerful screening molecular tool for the detection of S. mansoni and S. haematobium. It is a simple, rapid, accurate, and cost-effective method. Hence, this method is a good alternative approach to probe-based PCR assays...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Objective Strongyloides stercoralis is a soil-transmitted {{intestinal}} nematode {{that has}} been estimated to infect at least 60 million people, especially in tropical and subtropical regions. Strongyloides infection has been described in immunosupressed patients with lymphoma, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus etc. Our case who has rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and bronchial asthma was treated with low dose steroids and methotrexate. Methods A 68 year old woman has bronchial asthma for 55 years and also diagnosed RA 7 years ago. She received immunusupressive agents including methotrexate and steroids. On admission at hospital, she was on deflazacort 5 mg/day and methotrexate 15 mg/week. On her physical examination, she was afebrile, had rhonchi and mild epigastric tenderness. She had joint deformities at metacarpophalengeal joints and phalanges but no active arthritis finding. Results Oesophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed and it showed hemorrhagic focus at bulbus. Gastric biopsy obtained and showed evidence of <b>S.</b> Stercoralis infection. <b>Stool</b> and sputum parasitological examinations were also all positive for S. stercoralis larvae. Chest radiography result had no pathologic finding. Albendazole 400 mg/day was started for 23 days. After the ivermectin was retrieved, patient was treated with oral ivermectin 200 μg once a day for 3 days. On her outpatient control at 15 th day, stool and sputum samples were all negative for parasites. Conclusion S. stercoralis may cause mortal diseases in patients. Immunosupression frequently causes disseminated infections. Many infected patients are completely asymptomatic. Although {{it is important to}} detect latent S. stercoralis infections before administering chemotherapy or before the onset of immunosuppression in patients at risk, a specific and sensitive diagnostic test is lacking. In immunosupressed patients, to detect S. stercoralis might help to have the patient survived and constitute the exact therapy. </p...|$|R
40|$|Human schistosomiasis, mainly due to Schistosoma mansoni species, {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{prevalent}} parasitic diseases worldwide. To overcome the drawbacks of classical parasitological and serological methods in detecting S. mansoni infections, especially in acute stage of the disease, development of cost-effective, simple and rapid molecular methods is still needed for the diagnosis of schistosomiasis. A promising approach is the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) technology. Compared to PCR-based assays, LAMP has the advantages of reaction simplicity, rapidity, specificity, cost-effectiveness and higher amplification efficiency. Additionally, as results can be inspected by the naked eye, the technique has great potential for use in low-income countries. A sequence corresponding to a mitochondrial S. mansoni minisatellite DNA region was selected as a target for designing a LAMP-based method to detect S. mansoni DNA in stool samples. We used a S. mansoni murine model to obtain well defined stool and sera samples from infected mice with S. mansoni cercariae. Samples were taken weekly from week 0 to 8 post-infection and the Kato-Katz and ELISA techniques were used for monitoring the infection. Primer set designed were tested using a commercial reaction mixture for LAMP assay and an in house mixture to compare results. Specificity of LAMP was tested using 16 DNA samples from different parasites, including several Schistosoma species, and no cross-reactions were found. The detection limit of our LAMP assay (SmMIT-LAMP) was 1 fg of S. mansoni DNA. When testing stool samples from infected mice the SmMIT-LAMP detected S. mansoni DNA as soon as 1 week post-infection. We have developed, for the first time, a cost-effective, easy to perform, specific and sensitive LAMP assay for early detection of <b>S.</b> mansoni in <b>stool</b> samples. The method is potentially and readily adaptable for field diagnosis and disease surveillance in schistosomiasis-endemic areas...|$|R

Prior to colonoscopy, effluents (fresh stools, sera-S and urine-U) were harvested and FOBTs performed. Methylation levels were measured in <b>stools,</b> <b>S</b> and U for 3 genes (Wif 1, ALX- 4, and Vimentin) selected from a panel of 63 genes; Kras mutations and seven dominant and subdominant bacterial populations in stools were quantified. Calibration was assessed with the Hosmer-Lemeshow chi-square, and discrimination was determined by calculating the C-statistic (Area Under Curve) and Net Reclassification Improvement index. Results: There were 247 individuals (mean age 60. 8 ± 12. 4 years, 52 % of males) in the study group, and 90 (36 %) of these individuals were patients with advanced polyps or invasive adenocarcinomas. A multivariate model adjusted for age and FOBT led to a C-statistic of 0. 83 [0. 77 - 0. 88]. After supplementary sequential (one-by-one) adjustment, Wif- 1 methylation (S or U) and fecal microbiota dysbiosis led to increases of the C-statistic to 0. 90 [0. 84 - 0. 94] (p = 0. 02) and 0. 81 [0. 74 - 0. 86] (p = 0. 49), respectively. When adjusted jointly for FOBT and Wif- 1 methylation or fecal microbiota dysbiosis, the increase of the C-statistic was even more significant (0. 91 and 0. 85, p< 0. 001 and p = 0. 10, respectively). Conclusion: The detection of methylated Wif- 1 in either S or U has a higher performance accuracy compared to guaiac FOBT for advanced colorectal neoplasia screening.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Promising {{results have}} been {{reported}} for a urine circulating cathodic antigen (CCA) test for the diagnosis of Schistosoma mansoni. We assessed the accuracy of a commercially available CCA cassette test (designated CCA-A) and an experimental formulation (CCA-B) for S. mansoni diagnosis. METHODOLOGY: We conducted a cross-sectional survey in three settings of Côte d'Ivoire: settings A and B are endemic for S. mansoni, whereas S. haematobium co-exists in setting C. Overall, 446 children, aged 8 - 12 years, submitted multiple stool and urine samples. For <b>S.</b> mansoni diagnosis, <b>stool</b> samples were examined with triplicate Kato-Katz, whereas urine samples were tested with CCA-A. The first stool and urine samples were additionally subjected to an ether-concentration technique and CCA-B, respectively. Urine samples were examined for S. haematobium using a filtration method, and for microhematuria using Hemastix dipsticks. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Considering nine Kato-Katz as diagnostic 'gold' standard, the prevalence of S. mansoni in setting A, B and C was 32. 9 %, 53. 1 % and 91. 8 %, respectively. The sensitivity of triplicate Kato-Katz from the first stool and a single CCA-A test was 47. 9 % and 56. 3 % (setting A), 73. 9 % and 69. 6 % (setting B), and 94. 2 % and 89. 6 % (setting C). The respective sensitivity of a single CCA-B was 10. 4 %, 29. 9 % and 75. 0 %. The ether-concentration technique showed a low sensitivity for S. mansoni diagnosis (8. 3 - 41. 0 %). The specificity of CCA-A was moderate (76. 9 - 84. 2 %); CCA-B was high (96. 7 - 100 %). The likelihood of a CCA-A color reaction increased with higher S. mansoni fecal egg counts (odds ratio: 1. 07, p< 0. 001). A concurrent S. haematobium infection or the presence of microhematuria did not influence the CCA-A test results for S. mansoni diagnosis. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: CCA-A showed similar sensitivity than triplicate Kato-Katz for S. mansoni diagnosis with no cross-reactivity to S. haematobium and microhematuria. The low sensitivity of CCA-B in our study area precludes its use for S. mansoni diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThere is a {{need for}} {{diagnostic}} techniques which are sensitive, specific, rapid and easy to perform at the point-of-care. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the diagnostic performance of the Circulating Cathodic Antigen (POC-CCA) assay for Schistosoma mansoni in four schools along the coast of Lake Victoria in Mwanza Region, Tanzania, and to optimize the reading of the POC-CCA test lines by using a computer software image analysis. Initially, a pilot study in 106 school children indicated that time of urine collection did not have an impact on CCA results as 84. 9 % (90) had identical scores from a urine collected in the morning and a urine taken at midday after drinking 0. 5 L of water. The main study was conducted among 404 school children (aged 9 – 12 years) where stool and urine samples were collected for three consecutive days. For <b>S.</b> mansoni diagnosis, <b>stool</b> samples were examined for eggs with duplicate Kato-Katz smears, whereas urine samples were tested for presence of antigen by POC-CCA. The proportion of positive individuals for S. mansoni by one POC-CCA was higher compared to two Kato-Katz smears (66. 1 % vs. 28. 7 %; p< 0. 0001). Both proportions increased expectedly when three POC-CCAs were compared to six Kato-Katz smears (75. 0 % vs. 42. 6 %; p< 0. 0001). Three POC-CCAs were more sensitive (94. 7 %) than six Kato-Katz smears (53. 8 %) using the combined results of three POC-CCAs and six Kato-Katz smears as the ‘gold standard’. To optimize the reading of the POC-CCA, a Software tool (Image Studio Lite®) was used to read and quantify the colour (expressed as pixels) of the test line on all positive tests, showing a positive correlation between number of pixels and the visually scored intensities and between number of pixels and egg counts. In conclusion, the POC-CCA assay seems to be a more appropriate tool for S. mansoni diagnosis compared to the Kato-Katz method in endemic communities such as Mwanza Region. Optimization of the tool in terms of cassette-reading could be assessed by computer software which was able to quantify the colour of the lines in the strip of the cassette...|$|R
40|$|The {{detection}} of intestinal parasitic infections for routine diagnosis and for epidemiological research still depends mainly on microscopical examination of stool samples for {{the identification of}} helminth eggs and protozoan trophozoites and cysts. Because microscopy has several limitations, additional diagnostic methods (e. g. culture, antigen detection) have been introduced to improve the {{detection of}} intestinal parasites. Although such additional methods increase sensitivity, the amount of hands-on time accumulates substantially. In chapter 1 various diagnostic methods are summarized and the diagnostic challenges are described for the most important intestinal parasitic infections. During the last years remarkable {{progress has been made}} in the development of molecular diagnostic methods based on the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technique. For the detection of intestinal parasites, DNA isolation from stool can be processed in a semi- or fully-automated system where after specific DNA of multiple targets can be amplified simultaneously, visualized on screen and semi-quantified in a closed tube system with a multiplex real-time PCR. In this thesis, a diagnostic approach using multiplex real-time PCR is assessed for the routine clinical diagnosis and epidemiology of intestinal parasites. In chapter 2 the diagnostic results that were obtained with multiplex-real-time PCR for the detection of Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia lamblia and Cryptosporidium parvum / C.  hominis (HGC PCR) were compared with the results obtained by routine microscopy on faecal samples from patients visiting their general practitioner because of gastrointestinal symptoms. The study revealed that significant numbers of G.  lamblia and Cryptosporidium infections remained undetected with microscopy, even with the use of a multiple sampling procedure of faecal specimens in combination with fixatives (also referred to as the triple faeces test (TFT) procedure). Parasites that had been detected with microscopy but not with real-time PCR consisted mainly of non-pathogenic parasites and Dientamoeba fragilis, of which its pathogenicity is still disputed upon. Hence, compared to the molecular approach, microscopy provided limited sensitivity in a routine diagnostic setting of general practice patients with gastro-intestinal complaints. For the same patient group as described in chapter 2, the results of Cryptosporidium detection with the HGC-PCR were studied in more detail in chapter 3. Microscopic examination for Cryptosporidium, which requires an additional staining procedure of the faecal smear, was specifically requested by general practitioners twenty-one times over a period of approximately seven months and was found positive in 13 cases. In contrast to the conventional diagnostic approach, with HGC PCR 80 cases were detected. The prevalence of Cryptosporidium in Dutch patients with gastro-intestinal complaints attending their general practitioner has so far exceeded the figures in previous studies. The highest infection rate has been detected among children aged under five years with a peak in the month of September: almost one-third of them had been infected with Cryptosporidium, mainly with the species Cryptosporidium hominis. The lack of request for an additional diagnostic procedure to detect Cryptosporidium is not the only reason for missing infections. Basic microscopic stool examination was often not requested, leaving a substantial number of gastro-intestinal parasitic infections undiagnosed. Besides the Dutch general practice patients group, the diagnostic approach with real-time PCR was also assessed for the routine diagnosis of intestinal parasites in returning travellers. Chapter 4 describes a prospective study where the results of 2591 microscopic examinations and antigen detections (i. e. care as usual) were compared with the results of those from the HGC-PCR and an additional Strongyloides stercoralis real-time PCR. The detection rates of all four targeted parasite species were increased with real-time PCR whereas the prevalence of ten additional pathogenic parasite species found with microscopy was 0. 5 % at most. A fully automated DNA isolation process and extension of the molecular diagnostic targets could further increase the detection rates of parasites while having considerable impact on cost-efficiency of the diagnostic procedures in the laboratory. Chapter 5 describes the molecular epidemiology of G. lamblia infections in the group of returned travellers. Symptoms of G.  lamblia infections in this group, consisting mainly of adults, were highly variable and ranged from asymptomatic to the presence of severe gastro-intestinal complaints. Data in this study showed that although the G.  lamblia Cycle-threshold (Ct) -values, which reflect the intensity of infection, correlated with the number of specified gastro-intestinal complaints, the parasite was also detected in 4. 7 % of the travellers who did not have any intestinal symptoms. The reasons for the clinical heterogeneity of G.  lamblia infections are still not fully understood. In previous studies the epidemiological role of G.  lamblia assemblages (i. e. group of genotypes) have been suggested as an important factor associated with gastro-intestinal complaints, however, this could not be proven in this group of travellers. In chapter 6 a real-time PCR for the detection of Isospora belli was evaluated and in chapter 7 a multiplex real-time PCR was evaluated for the detection of Encephalitozoon intestinalis and Enterocytozoon bieneusi. These real-time PCRs have been developed in addition to the panel of molecular diagnostic assays to be used in a clinical setting and in epidemiological studies. As such, a phylogenetic study of E.  bieneusi infections in persons with different clinical backgrounds is described in chapter 8. The results indicate a dynamic evolutionary process between genotypes of E.  bieneusi. One specific genotype was restricted to transplantation patients receiving immuno-supressives and another genotype showed its preferential habitat in patients living with HIV/AIDS, which further emphasizes the predisposition for specific hosts by different E.  bieneusi genotypes. Although Schistosoma mansoni and Schistosoma haematobium are living in the blood vessels and not in the intestinal lumen, this thesis also elaborates on real-time PCR for the detection of Schistosoma in humans. In chapter 9 a multiplex real-time PCR was evaluated for the detection of both S. mansoni and <b>S.</b>  haematobium in <b>stool</b> samples collected in an area endemic for both Schistosoma species. The detected Ct-values correlated with the results from quantitative microscopy on stool and on urine samples. Furthermore, the use of ethanol-suspended stool samples for storage and transport at ambient temperatures, as was done in this study, makes collection of samples at remote areas more attractive. In chapter 10, the performance of the Schistosoma real-time PCR was evaluated for the diagnosis of female genital schistosomiasis on DNA isolated from vaginal lavages. The preliminary results in this study showed that the semi-quantitative outcome of the PCR can be used in the differential diagnosis of vaginal lesions and as a predictor of disease pathology. In conclusion, the comparative studies in this thesis revealed that the introduction of real-time PCR for routine detection of diarrhoea causing protozoa and helminths will improve the diagnostic efficiency of laboratories dealing with faecal samples. Standard diagnostic procedures can further be improved by the design of real-time PCR panels for specific patient groups containing parasitic, bacterial, fungal and / or viral targets. Furthermore, with the simple sample collection procedure and the high throughput potential, the multiplex real-time PCR showed to be a powerful tool for epidemiological studies, even in remote areas. The real-time PCR method has little value for clinical diagnostics in low-income countries but can certainly play a prominent role as a gold standard in quality control for the evaluation of new, inexpensive rapid tests for field diagnostics.

40|$|Soil-transmitted helminths are {{intestinal}} parasitic worms that isproportionally affect socio-economically deprived {{populations in}} tropical and subtropical countries living under poor hygienic conditions. The intestinal helminths are transmitted by the contamination of soil with human faeces containing the worms’ eggs and by subsequent accidental ingestion of the contaminated soil with food or hands, or by {{penetration of the}} worm larvae into the skin and body of humans. The global burden attributed to soil-transmitted helminth infections {{is estimated to be}} as high as 39 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost annually. Children and pregnant women are the groups at highest risk of morbidity. The World Health Organization (WHO) widely advocates periodical deworming of school-aged children as strategy to control morbidity associated with soil-transmitted helminth infections. A global target to reach a minimum treatment coverage of 75 % of school-aged children at risk by 2010 was set by the World Health Assembly in May 2001. In Zanzibar, Tanzania, soil-transmitted helminthiases were recognized as a major public health issue in the early 1990 s, with 85 % of the surveyed population infected with {{at least one of the}} major species, namely Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworms (Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus) and Trichuris trichiura. Infections with Strongyloides stercoralis, arguably the most neglected soiltransmitted helminth, were found in 40 % of schoolchildren examined in rural Zanzibar. In 1994 and 2001 national helminth control programmes were implemented by the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MoHSW) of Zanzibar. Since then, anthelminthic drugs have been administered annually to schoolchildren and other eligible population groups of Zanzibar and a treatment coverage of more than 80 % was reached. The overreaching goal of this PhD thesis was to deepen our understanding of the epidemiology and control of soil-transmitted helminth infections in Zanzibar. There were three specific objectives. First, to compare and evaluate different diagnostic techniques for the detection of soil-transmitted helminth infections. Second, to determine the current epidemiology and risk factors of soil-transmitted helminth infections, including S. stercoralis, in environmentally and socio-economically distinct settings on Unguja. Third, to assess the long-term effect of periodic anthelminthic treatment on soiltransmitted helminth prevalences and infection intensities, including the assessment of the efficacy and safety of albendazole and mebendazole administered alone or in combination with ivermectin against T. trichiura and other soil-transmitted helminth infections. The fieldwork for this PhD thesis was split in three parts. In 2007, for an assessment of the epidemiological situation of helminth infections on Unguja, a crosssectional study was conducted in five madrassas and five primary schools in the six districts of Unguja and included 336 children. Additionally, a cross-sectional study including 401 children was carried out in Chaani and Kinyasini primary schools. The parasitological results were compared to data derived in 1994 in the same schools. Multiple stool samples were collected from each participant over consecutive days. The Kato-Katz method was employed for the diagnosis of A. lumbricoides, hookworm and T. trichiura, the Koga-agar plate method for hookworm and S. stercoralis and the Baermann method for <b>S.</b> stercoralis. Moreover, <b>stool</b> samples preserved in sodium acetate-acetic acid-formalin (SAF) were transferred to Italy and examined with the FLOTAC method. The sensitivity of the individual methods and method combinations was compared. In 2008, a cross-sectional study was conducted in a rural and a peri-urban setting on Unguja, with 658 individuals aged 5 - 100 years enrolled. Besides the determination of soiltransmitted helminth infections with the aforementioned methods, urine samples were analysed for Schistosoma haematobium infections, blood samples were examined for anaemia and antibodies against helminth infections, and study participants were interviewed with a questionnaire for behavioural risk factors of soil-transmitted helminth infections and associated morbidity signs. The epidemiological situation of both settings was compared and juxtaposed with helminth control activities in Zanzibar. In 2009, a randomised controlled trial was carried out, comparing monotherapies with combination therapy. During the baseline screening 1240 children from Kinyasini and Kilombero schools were enrolled. The children infected with T. trichiura (n= 610) were assigned to four treatment arms. For diagnosis, four Kato-Katz thick smears before and 3 - 5 weeks after treatment were employed and results were compared with outcomes derived by the FLOTAC method. After several years of helminth control in Zanzibar, the prevalence of soiltransmitted helminth infections on Unguja is still high, ranging between 22 % in the urban and 70 % in the North A district. Infection intensities are mostly light, and hence the diagnosis based on egg-positivity in stool sample has become a challenge. The sensitivity of the coprological methods can be increased with (i) a rigorous adherence to the bench aids provided by WHO (Kato-Katz method); (ii) the examination of multiple stool samples per individual; (iii) multiple examinations from the same stool sample; and (iv) the combination of diagnostic methods. FLOTAC shows a high sensitivity for the diagnosis of A. lumbricoides (~ 80 %) and T. trichiura (~ 90 %). However, the method needs further evaluation and standardization to produce reliable results for hookworm diagnosis. Its potential for application in resource-poor settings and its suitability for drug efficacy assessment needs additional investigation. On Unguja, soil-transmitted helminthiases are most prevalent in the North A district. Infections with multiple species helminth infections are common, particularly in children from rural areas. Anaemia is prevalent, but was not associated with any soil-transmitted helminth infection in our study. Risk factors for soil-transmitted helminth infections are setting- and species-specific and include, besides demographic factors, the consumption of raw vegetables or salad, no hand-washing after defecation and a recent travel history. T. trichiura is the predominant soil-transmitted helminth species on Unguja, with highest prevalences found in Kilombero school (71 %). In contrast to hookworm (- 77 %) and A. lumbricoides (- 71 %), the prevalence of T. trichiura was not markedly reduced in the past years (- 46 %). This phenomenon can be explained by the low efficacies of the drugs albendazole (cure rate (CR) : 10 %; egg reduction rate (ERR) : 40 %) and mebendazole (CR: 19 %; ERR: 67 %) commonly applied in Zanzibar’s school-based helminth control programmes. The addition of ivermectin increased the efficacy of particularly mebendazole (CR: 55 %; ERR: 97 %), but also of albendazole (CR: 38 %; ERR: 91 %) against T. trichiura. Both drugs and drug combinations were highly efficacious against A. lumbricoides (ERR: > 99 %). The treatment outcome of albendazole (CR: 59 %; ERR: 94 %) was better than that of mebendazole (CR: 35 %; ERR: 78 %) against hookworm infections, but ivermectin did not improve treatment outcomes. Adverse events were mostly mild and disappeared within 48 hours after treatment, and did not differ between the treatment regimens. The CRs assessed with FLOTAC were lower than with the Kato-Katz method for all three soil-transmitted helminth species. The Zanzibar helminth control programmes have successfully reduced soiltransmitted helminth prevalences and infection intensities, and hence morbidity. Poverty alleviation accompanied by an increased access of households to improved sanitation has likely reduced the infection rate. Soil-transmitted helminth control on Unguja can now focus on prevalence and transmission control, but will need to revise measures for a sustainable progress. Alternation of albendazole and mebendazole should be considered to more effectively target both hookworm and T. trichiura. For improved treatment outcomes against T. trichiura, and to also target S. stercoralis and ectoparasites, albendazole and mebendazole should be combined with ivermectin whenever people are eligible for this kind of therapy. Since new infections cannot be prevented by anthelminthic drugs alone, and because T. trichiura, the helminth species that is responsible for the majority of infections on Unguja, is cured ineffectively with the currently available drugs, an increase in hygiene and sanitation is indispensable for sustainable control of soil-transmitted helminths in Zanzibar and elsewhere. A far-reaching dissemination of appealing and plausible health education and communication to school-aged children and communities will be necessary to create the environment for community-led improvements in sanitation (latrine construction, sewage disposal and access to clean water), and to assure their adequate use. Only public consent and the wish for better sanitation at local scale, hand-in-hand with governmental and nongovernmental supported poverty alleviation measures can finally result in soil-transmitted helminth elimination in Zanzibar and elsewhere...|$|R
