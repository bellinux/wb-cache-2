5|$|Monsanto {{stated that}} he was {{infringing}} its patents because the soybeans he bought from the elevator were products that he purchased for use as seeds without a license from Monsanto; Bowman {{stated that he}} had not infringed due to patent exhaustion on the <b>first</b> <b>sale</b> of seed to whatever farmers had produced the crops that he bought from the elevator, on the grounds that for seed, all future generations are embodied in the first generation that was originally sold. Bowman had previously purchased and planted Monsanto seeds under a license agreement promising not to save seeds from the resulting crop, but that agreement was not relevant to his purchase of soybean seed from the grain elevator nor to the litigation. In 2007, Monsanto sued Bowman for patent infringement in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana.|$|E
5|$|The {{company was}} briefly {{saved by the}} war against the Seminoles in Florida which {{provided}} the <b>first</b> <b>sale</b> of Colt's revolvers and his new revolving rifles. The soldiers in Florida praised the new weapon, but the unusual hammerless design, sixty years ahead of its time, led to difficulty in training men who were used to exposed-hammer guns. Consequently, many curious soldiers took the locks apart. This resulted in breakage of parts, stripped screw heads and inoperable guns. Colt soon reworked his design to leave the firing hammer exposed, but problems continued. In late 1843, after the loss of payment for the Florida pistols, the Paterson plant closed and a public auction was held in New York City to sell the company's most liquid assets.|$|E

25|$|The <b>first</b> <b>sale</b> in Sweden was to ASEA-Atom in 1974 {{to control}} nuclear power plants. A Swedish {{subsidiary}} was established the following year. Because of the proprietary system architecture of each manufacturer, companies {{would fall into}} a vendor lock-in; therefore purchase of computer systems were often more of a strategic than product-specific purchase. An important aspect for ND was therefore to convince their potential customers {{that they would be}} able to deliver in the long run.|$|E

By 1845, Lawrence had subdivided and sold the land on which he had built a cottage. The land on the sea-side of The Esplanade has continued to be Crown land.|$|E
25|$|Brown and Hazen {{presented}} their {{work at the}} National Academy of Sciences regional meeting in 1950. The subsequent report by the New York Times started a flurry of calls from pharmaceutical companies, interested in the commercial possibilities of nystatin. The pharmaceutical industry had the manufacturing capabilities and ability to test the compound on humans. However, to license the substance, control the purity, and protect the financial interests of the developers, Gilbert Dalldorf, the division director of the laboratory in which Hazen and Brown worked, assigned patent royalties to the Research Corporation of New York, a nonprofit foundation created {{for the advancement of}} science. The production license was awarded to E. R.
