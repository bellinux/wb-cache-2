Both leukocyte and fibroblast interferons are removed from crude tissue culture fluids by means of columns of antibody to leukocyte interferon attached to Sepharose- 4 B. The antibody was prepared in sheep using, as antigen, material that had been partially purified by gel filtration through Sephadex G- 100 columns. Many of the impurities in the crude fibroblast interferon were presumably not recognized by the sheep antibodies induced by leukocyte interferon. Fibroblast interferon was, therefore, much more effectively purified {{as the result of}} this “common denominator” approach. The <b>fibroblast</b> <b>product,</b> in contrast to interferon from leukocytes, could only be harvested efficiently from the crude starting material when a carrier protein (bovine-serum albumin, and later, cytochrome c) was added to the eluting buffers to counteract losses, presumably due to adsorption on purification and assay equipment.

40|$|AbstractFibrocytes are bone marrow-derived mesenchymal {{progenitors}} that co-express {{hematopoietic cell}} antigens and markers of monocytic lineage {{as well as}} <b>fibroblast</b> <b>products.</b> During wound healing, fibrocytes {{have been found to}} possess the ability of antigen-presentation to naive T cells in the inflammatory phase. Moreover, they can promote the endothelial cell proliferation, migration and angiogenesis by secreting several proteins. Fibrocytes can further differentiate into mature mesenchymocyte lineage, such as fibroblasts, myofibroblasts and adipocytes, and they may represent the systemic source of myofibroblasts that exert a contractile force required to close tissue wounds.

We investigated the presence of fibrocytes and the expression of their chemotactic pathways CCL 21 /CCR 7 and CXCL 12 /CXCR 4 in proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) epiretinal membranes. METHODS: Sixteen membranes were studied by immunohistochemical techniques. RESULTS: Cells expressing alpha-smooth-muscle actin (alpha-SMA), a marker of differentiation of fibrocytes into myofibroblasts, were present in all membranes. Cells expressing the haematopoietic stem-cell antigen CD 34, the leucocyte common antigen CD 45, CCR 7, CXCR 4, CCL 21 and CXCL 12 were noted in 50 %, 75 %, 68. 8 %, 100 %, 80 % and 93. 8 % of the membranes, respectively. Double immunohistochemistry indicated that all cells expressing CD 34, CD 45, CCR 7, CXCR 4, CCL 21 and CXCL 12 co-expressed alpha-SMA. The number of cells expressing CD 34 correlated significantly with the numbers of cells expressing CXCL 12 (r(s) = 0. 567; p = 0. 022) and CCL 21 (r(s) = 0. 534; p = 0. 04).

40|$|Perivascular infiltrates of {{inflammatory}} cells are {{a hallmark of}} lesional skin in scleroderma. We have explored the potential for scleroderma fibroblasts to modulate mononuclear leucocyte migration across endothelial cell monolayers in tissue culture, and to regulate expression of endothelial cell adhesion molecules. Fibroblasts were grown from skin biopsies of eight patients with active diffuse cutaneous scleroderma and from four healthy controls. Co-culture and conditioned medium transfer experiments examined the effect of soluble <b>fibroblast</b> <b>products</b> on mononuclear leucocyte (U 937) cell migration across endothelial cell (1 E- 7) monolayers grown on tissue culture inserts. Co-culture of scleroderma, but not control fibroblasts, promoted transendothelial migration of U 937 cells. Scleroderma fibroblast-conditioned medium had qualitatively similar effects and equivalent results were obtained using Jurkat- 6 (T lymphocyte) cells, and with {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} from a patient with diffuse cutaneous scleroderma. Promotion of leucocyte migration does not appear to result from increased endothelial adhesion molecule expression, since fibroblast-conditioned medium did not up-regulate endothelial cell expression of intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1), vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1 (VCAM- 1) or E-selectin. Moreover, leucocyte migration across cytokine-activated endothelial cell layers in co-cuture with fibroblasts was less than across resting cells, although the selective effect of scleroderma fibroblast co-culture persisted. Recombinant monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 (MCP- 1) or IL- 8 increased passage of mononuclear leucocytes across endothelial cell monolayers, whilst anti-MCP- 1, but not anti-IL- 8 antibodies, significantly reduced the effect of fibroblast conditioned medium. These data suggest that systemic sclerosis (SSc) fibroblasts promote leucocyte migration across endothelial cell monolayers in tissue culture via an MCP- 1 -dependent mechanism. These findings may be relevant to the perivascular mononuclear leucocyte infiltrates characteristic of early SSc lesions...|$|R
40|$|SummaryEpithelial-to-mesenchymal {{transition}} (EMT) is a developmental process {{important for}} cell fate determination. <b>Fibroblasts,</b> a <b>product</b> of EMT, can be reset into induced {{pluripotent stem cells}} (iPSCs) via exogenous transcription factors but the underlying mechanism is unclear. Here we show that the generation of iPSCs from mouse fibroblasts requires a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) orchestrated by suppressing pro-EMT signals from the culture medium and activating an epithelial program inside the cells. At the transcriptional level, Sox 2 /Oct 4 suppress the EMT mediator Snail, c-Myc downregulates TGF-β 1 and TGF-β receptor 2, and Klf 4 induces epithelial genes including E-cadherin. Blocking MET impairs the reprogramming of fibroblasts whereas preventing EMT in epithelial cells cultured with serum can produce iPSCs without Klf 4 and c-Myc. Our work not only establishes MET as a key cellular mechanism toward induced pluripotency, but also demonstrates iPSC generation as a cooperative process between the defined factors and the extracellular milieu.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{production}} factors yielding a functional dermal substitute was investigated by means of monotonic and cyclic uniaxial tensile tests, as well as electron microscopy visualizations. The role of (i) plastic compression, (ii) product incubation, and (iii) cell permanence in the collagenous matrix {{in order to achieve}} a skin-like behavior were characterized in terms of material and structural stiffness, in-plane kinematics, and cyclic response, as well as pore size and network density. The plastic compression resulted in a denser and stiffer material, while no corresponding change was observed in the behavior of the entire structure. This was related to the progressive reduction in product thickness and amount of excess water, rather than to formation of new crosslinks between fibers. Contrary, irrespective of the presence of human <b>fibroblasts,</b> the <b>product</b> incubation induced both material and structural stiffening, indicating the formation of a denser network. These results were confirmed by similar evolutions in the construct in-plane kinematics and cyclic stress reduction. Finally, comparison of constructs incubated in different culture media indicated a determinant contribution of the biochemical environment, rather than of the seeded cells, to the achieved mechanical properties. The observed features are relevant in terms of mechanical biocompatibility of the implant and might direct future optimizations of the production process in order to rapidly attain the desired mechanical properties...|$|R

40|$|Hybrids between mouse {{hepatoma}} cells (which secrete several serum proteins) {{and mouse}} or rat fibroblasts (which do not secrete these proteins) produce transferrin {{and the third}} component of complement (C 3) like the parental hepatoma cells, while they do not secrete either albumin or alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). This lack of albumin and AFP secretion is probably {{due to a lack}} of synthesis, rather than to a simple defect in secretion. The cessation of albumin and AFP production is not dependent upon the parental fibroblast nor upon the selection conditions; it is best explained by a shut-off synthesis and could thus reflect the existence of a regulatory mechanism. This would imply a difference between the control of albumin and AFP synthesis and that of transferrin and C 3 synthesis. On the other hand, in agreement with Peterson and Weiss (1972), hybrids between rat hepatoma cells and mouse <b>fibroblasts</b> continue to <b>product</b> rat albumin.

The current study aimed {{to optimize the}} use of this enzyme at the root canal pH using a modified VCPO (mVCPO) that was adapted to function at a higher pH and to explore the biocompatibility of mVCPO. Methods The activity of the original and modified VCPO was assessed using the monochlorodimedone assay. For antimicrobial assessment, 48 -hour biofilms of E. faecalis OS- 16 were incubated 5 or 30 minutes with mVCPO, bromide, and hydrogen peroxide, and colony-forming units were determined. A metabolic activity assay was used to evaluate the cytotoxic effect of mVCPO on oral <b>fibroblasts.</b> Results Reaction <b>products</b> generated by mVCPO at a root canal pH of 7. 7 significantly inactivated the biofilm after 5 minutes and even more after 30 minutes (Mann-Whitney U test, P <. 05). The mVCPO reaction products showed less cytotoxic effects than control solutions and 0. 5 % sodium hypochlorite (Kruskal-Wallis test, P <. 05). Conclusions The incubation of mVCPO in the presence of its substrates with in vitro E. faecalis biofilms showed a significant antimicrobial effect at the root canal pH. Also, cytotoxicity tests showed preliminary biocompatibility. Therefore, an interappointment dressing containing mVCPO could aid in improving current endodontic treatment through continuous and local generation of antimicrobials...|$|R
40|$|Differentiation of {{skeletal}} muscle involves withdrawal of myoblasts from the cell cycle, fusion to form myotubes, and the coordinate {{expression of a}} variety of muscle-specific gene <b>products.</b> <b>Fibroblast</b> growth factor and type beta transforming growth factor specifically inhibit myogenesis; however, the transmembrane signaling pathways responsible for suppression of differentiation by these growth factors remain elusive. Because ras proteins have been implicated in the transduction of growth factor signals across the plasma membrane, we used DNA-mediated gene transfer to investigate the potential involvement of this family of regulatory proteins in the control of myogenesis. Transfection of the mouse {{skeletal muscle}} cell line C 2 with the oncogenic forms of H-ras or N-ras completely suppressed both myoblast fusion and induction of the muscle-specific gene products nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and creatine kinase. Inhibition of differentiation by activated ras genes occurred at the level of muscle-specific mRNA accumulation. In contrast, proto-oncogenic forms of N-ras or H-ras had no apparent effects on the ability of C 2 cells to differentiate. Myoblasts transfected with activated ras genes exhibited normal growth properties and ceased proliferating in the absence of mitogens, indicating that ras inhibited differentiation through a mechanism independent of cell proliferation. These results demonstrate that activated ras gene products mimic the inhibitory effects of fibroblast growth factor and type beta transforming growth factor on myogenic differentiation and suggest that each of these regulators of myogenesis may operate through a common intracellular pathway...|$|R
40|$|In {{the growth}} of keratinocytes "in vitro", PGE 2 seems to play an {{important}} role. We have shown that in fibroblast-keratinocyte co-cultures, indomethacin, employed at concentrations which inhibit the PGE 2 synthesis, reduced the proliferation of epidermal cells. This effect was reversed by an exogenous PGE 2 addition to the culture media. To better understand the relationship between keratinocytes and the autacoid, we have tested PGE 2 at various concentrations in different cultural conditions, that is, epidermal cells were grown on a 3 T 3 -J 2 feeder layer, without fibroblasts and with a 3 T 3 -J 2 conditioned medium. We observed an increase in keratinocyte proliferation induced by the autacoid alone in the presence of fibroblasts, while a severe inhibitory effect was relieved when dermal cells or the conditioning medium were absent. The lack of <b>fibroblasts</b> and their <b>products</b> in the culture medium modified the morphology of keratinocytes cultured in vitro. PGE 2 induced significant morphological and morphometrical variations only if added to the conditioning medium. The autacoid decreased the expression of 66 kDa protein, if cells were grown in the presence of fibroblasts or with conditioning medium, whereas it completely inhibited this keratin and those of 60, 54 kDa if cells were cultured only with a basal medium. From morphometrical and electrophoretical data we can suppose that PGE 2 inhibits cell differentiation. Thus PGE 2 action on keratinocytes seems to be strictly related to the presence of dermal cells...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} the {{relationship}} between the proliferation of bovine corneal epithelial cells and PGE 2 has been studied. Our data indicate that PGE 2 {{plays an important role in}} the growth of corneal epithelial cells. Actually, epithelial cells cultured on a keratocyte feeder-layer and exposed to indomethacin, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, have shown a decrease in growth rate at drug concentrations which otherwise did not induce a reduction in the viability of the keratocytes as well as in epithelial cells in separate cultures. This effect has been reversed by an exogenous PGE 2 addition to the culture media. Moreover, significant increases have been found in the growth of epithelial cells cultured in the presence of keratocytes, with basal medium and with conditioning medium after adding exogenous PGE 2 at concentrations equal to or lower than 10 (- 6) M. Significant decreases in the dimensions of the corneal epithelial cells have been found only when PGE 2 has been added to basal and to conditioning medium, suggesting that the autacoid maintains cell dimension and morphology. The appearance of keratins with high molecular weight (54 and 57 kDa) coupled with the tendency to stratification of the cells cultivated with media supplemented with PGE 2, indicates that the autacoid could favour cell differentiation. The action of PGE 2 on the corneal epithelial cells does not seem to be influenced by the presence of the <b>fibroblasts</b> and their <b>products,</b> since PGE 2 has induced increases in cell growth and morphological variations, independent of cultural conditions and therefore also only in the presence of basal medium...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} PGF 2 alpha on the growth, morphology, morphometry and {{keratinization}} pattern of bovine corneal epithelial cells cultured in vitro were studied. The cells were grown with a basal medium or, {{in the presence}} of keratocytes and/or their products, using a keratocyte-conditioning medium. Cell growth was evaluated by MTT assay. Daily treatments with exogenous PGF 2 alpha at concentrations equal to or lower than 10 (- 6) M induced significant increases in cell proliferation when the epithelial cells were cultured on a keratocyte feeder-layer or with the conditioning medium. No variations were observed in cultures grown with the basal medium. 10 (- 5) M PGF 2 alpha induced a decrease in cell growth under all culturing conditions. PGF 2 alpha did not affect cell morphology and modified only nuclear dimensions among the cells grown under different culturing conditions. No variations of any parameters were observed between cells cultured on feeder-layer, with conditioning or basal medium and the corresponding cultures supplemented with the autacoid. Moreover, PGF 2 alpha induced only the disappearance of 43 kDa keratin in cells grown on basal medium, while the keratin pattern of epithelial cells cultured on feeder-layer or with the conditioning medium was not modified by the autacoid. From these data we can suppose that a cooperation could exist between PGF 2 alpha and <b>fibroblasts</b> and their <b>products</b> for the modulation of cell growth. Finally, it was observed that the autacoid had no effect on cell morphology and morphometry, except for nuclear dimensions, despite the presence of other prostaglandins, such as PGE 2...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{elucidate}} the presence in rat cardiac fibroblastic cells of arginine-aminopeptidase and its involvement in the hydrolysis of angiotensin peptides. METHODS: Peptidase activity was measured as hydrolysis of the synthetic substrates, aryl-p-nitroanilides. Immunoblottings were performed with antibodies to aminopeptidase B and Glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase. RESULTS: Arginine-aminopeptidase found in cardiac fibroblasts (Fb) was arginine and lysine specific, sensitive to various aminopeptidase (AP) inhibitors and to the inhibitor of metalloproteases, 1. 10 -phenatroline. Experiments with arphamenine A, a specific inhibitor of aminopeptidase B, have shown the presence of two Arginine-aminopeptidase activities: arphamenine-sensitive: chloride-stimulated Arginine-aminopeptidase, and arphamenine-insensitive: chloride-insensitive Arginine-aminopeptidase. Transforming growth factor-beta 1 stimulated both Arginine-aminopeptidase activities by approximately threefold. Immunoblot with an antibody specific to rat aminopeptidase B has revealed that arphamenine-sensitive: chloride stimulated aminopeptidase is aminopeptidase B. Arginine-p-nitroanilide hydrolysis was significantly inhibited by angiotensin peptides such as angiotensin (1 - 10), (1 - 8), (1 - 7), (1 - 4), (5 - 8), (4 - 8), (3 - 8), and (2 - 8) at the concentration of 50 micromol/l which was fourfold less than the Arginine-p-nitroanilide concentration. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that chloride-insensitive Arginine-aminopeptidase could contribute to the hydrolysis of all studied angiotensin peptides in concert with other peptidases present in fibroblasts. Some of the peptides could probably not be hydrolyzed by Arginine-aminopeptidase. Instead, they could be first hydrolyzed by another peptidase in <b>fibroblasts</b> and the <b>product</b> of this hydrolysis could be a substrate for Arginine-aminopeptidase. The data obtained suggest that Arginine-aminopeptidase could perform processing of angiotensin peptides in the myocardium and participate in processes regulated by angiotensins such as fibrosis. status: publishe...|$|R

Because human gingival epithelium is a site that is constantly challenged by oral microorganisms, we examined the expression of hBD- 1 in human gingival epithelial and fibroblast cell cultures and tissue samples. Cell cultures were challenged with cell wall extracts of Porphyromonas gingivalis or Fusobacterium nucleatum, Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide, tumor necrosis factor alpha, or phorbol myristate acetate. hBD- 1 mRNA was detected in unstimulated and stimulated cultures by reverse transcription (RT) -PCR using several primer sets specific for hBD- 1. Gingival epithelial cells, but not gingival <b>fibroblasts,</b> expressed a <b>product</b> of the predicted size for hBD- 1 mRNA. The sequence of the PCR product was identical to that of hBD- 1. hBD- 1 mRNA expression was not significantly modulated by any of the stimulants tested. Human gingival tissues from noninflamed and inflamed sites were also analyzed by RT-PCR. hBD- 1 mRNA was expressed in all tissue samples. The relative expression of hBD- 1 mRNA was similar in noninflamed and inflamed tissues obtained from each of four patients undergoing treatment for periodontitis. However, the relative expression of hBD- 1 mRNA varied in gingival biopsies obtained from 15 different normal individuals, and the relative hBD- 1 expression was unrelated to interleukin- 8 expression. Our findings show the constitutive expression of hBD- 1 mRNA in cultured epithelial cells and gingival tissues but not gingival fibroblasts. These findings suggest that expression of hBD- 1 may play a role as part of the innate host defenses in maintaining normal gingival health...|$|R
40|$|The ORF 29 gene of {{varicella-zoster virus}} encodes a {{single-stranded}} DNA binding protein that is predomi-nantly nuclear during lytic infection but {{appears to be}} restricted to the cytoplasm of latently infected neurons. Following reactivation, ORF 29 p accumulates in the nuclei of neurons, suggesting that its confinement to the cytosol may be critical for maintaining quiescence. When autonomously expressed, ORF 29 p accumulates in the nuclei of fibroblasts and the cytoplasm of cells (guinea pig enteric neurons) and cell lines (U 373 MG) of neuronal origin. Inhibition of the 26 S proteasome redirects the accumulation of ORF 29 p to the nucleus in cells of neuronal origin. Here, we show that ORF 29 p is ubiquitinated and sumoylated in 293 T cells and subsequently degraded from the N terminus. Ubiquitinated ORF 29 p accumulates in both the nuclei and the cytoplasm of <b>fibroblasts,</b> but degradation <b>products</b> are seen primarily in the cytoplasm. Modification and degradation of ORF 29 p occurs in 293 T, U 373 MG, and MeWo cells. Therefore, these processes are ubiquitous; however, the robustness of the degradation process is cell type specific. The proteasome-mediated mechanism of nuclear exclusion in U 373 MG cells is an active process that is not specific for the endogenous ORF 29 p nuclear localization signal but can be saturated by protein stabilization or overexpression, which leads to nuclear accumulation of ORF 29 p.

40|$|The rat beta-tropomyosin (TM) gene expresses two isoforms via {{alternative}} RNA splicing, namely {{skeletal muscle}} beta-TM and fibroblast TM- 1. The latter is also expressed in smooth muscle where it corresponds to smooth muscle beta-TM. Skeletal muscle beta-TM contains exons 7 and 10, whereas exons 6 and 11 {{are used in}} fibroblasts and smooth muscle. In order to study {{the properties of the}} alternatively spliced proteins, recombinant TMs derived from bacterial and insect cell expression systems were produced, including the normal beta gene <b>products,</b> <b>fibroblast</b> TM- 1 and beta skeletal muscle TM, two carboxy-terminal chimeric TMs, TM- 6 / 10 and TM- 7 / 11, as well as a carboxyl-truncated version of each, TM- 6 Cla and TM- 7 Cla. The purified TM isoforms were used in actin filament association studies. The apparent TM association constants (Ka) were taken as the free concentration at half saturation and were found to be 6 microM for beta Sk TM, 8. 5 for TM- 6 / 10, 25 microM for TM- 1, and 30 microM for TM- 7 / 11 at an F-actin concentration of 42 microM. For the truncated TMs, the values determined were higher still but the binding was not carried out to full saturation. Isoforms were also produced using the baculovirus-insect cell system which produces proteins with an acetylated amino terminus as is normally found in vivo. This modification significantly enhanced the F-actin association of TM- 1 but not the beta skeletal TM or the other isoforms. Fibroblast TM- 2 or TM- 3, both products of the alpha gene, enhanced the affinity of TM- 1 for F-actin, demonstrating different isoforms can act cooperatively on binding to actin. This effect was not detected with the other expressed beta gene products. The presence of 83 kDa nonmuscle caldesmon was found to enhance the binding of TM- 1 for F-actin. This effect was dependent on the presence of both exons 6 and 11, as caldesmon had little effect on the other beta gene products. Collectively these results demonstrate TMs differ in their affinity for F-actin, which can be altered by other TMs or actin-binding proteins. The beta tropomyosin isoforms were fluorescently-tagged and microinjected into cultured cells to study their in vivo localization where it was found that each of the full-length TMs bound to microfilaments but, at the light microscopy level, the isoforms were not differentially localized in these fibroblasts...|$|R
