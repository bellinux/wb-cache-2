500|$|Fonville {{competed in}} the Olympic trials in Evanston, Illinois in mid-July 1948, {{but he was not}} able to meet his own {{standards}} as a result of the injury. He finished fourth and, despite having broken the world record just three months earlier, did not qualify for the U.S. Olympic team. There were some who suggested that Fonville should be named to the Olympic team despite his fourth-place finish at the trials; others argued it would be unfair to the third-place finisher to take away his spot on the team. And [...] "there was also a suspicion that Fonville's ailing back hadn't healed and that his performance at Evanston represented the best he can <b>do</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> time." ...|$|E
500|$|Production for {{the film}} began in February 2006, with a budget of $20–25 million. Principal {{photography}} {{for the film}} was shot in Auckland, New Zealand within sixty days. Film editing took ten weeks, while post-production, music mixing, and visual effects took a few months. The film was finished by November 2006, because the crew [...] "had to rush" [...] to meet the February 16 deadline. The film was directed by Nickelodeon's Rugrats co-creator and former Hanna-Barbera animator Gábor Csupó, who was first recommended for the job by Walden Media President Cary Granat. Although Csupó had never worked on a live-action film before, it [...] "didn't worry Granat in the least". Csupó stated that {{he was interested in}} making the film because he [...] "had the ambition to do a live-action film for a long time", but that he [...] "didn't like anything until I read this book". He described the book as [...] "beautiful" [...] and said that it [...] "moved [...] ". Bridge to Terabithia was cinematographer Michael Chapman's final film before his retirement. Chapman mentioned in the film's DVD commentary that he retired after shooting this film because he wanted his last film to be a good one; [...] "this is such a beautiful story, and it's exactly the kind of movie I want to <b>do</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> time in my life".|$|E

2500|$|The album's lead single, [...] "SexyBack", was {{performed}} by Timberlake {{at the opening of}} the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards and reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100, where it remained for seven consecutive weeks. [...] "My Love", the album's second single, also produced by Timbaland and featuring rapper T.I., reached number one on the Hot 100, as did third single [...] "What Goes Around... Comes Around". The song is reported to have been inspired by the break-up of his childhood friend and business partner, Trace Ayala, with actress Elisha Cuthbert. In October 2006, Timberlake said that he would focus on his music career rather than his film roles, specifying that leaving the music industry would be a [...] "dumb thing to <b>do</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> point". He was the special guest performer at the 2006 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show where he sang [...] "SexyBack", [...] "My Love" [...] and [...] "LoveStoned".|$|E
2500|$|In {{order for}} the EMH defence to make sense, [...] would {{have to show that}} [...] small number of investors that beat the market in the long-run are not doing so because they are skilled but rather that they are lucky. How would they show this? Frankly, it is {{impossible}} to prove either way. But it strikes me as a very silly argument. We could just as easily apply it to [...] poker players. We could say [...] "Oh, they are not really skilled, they are just lucky. They are just a statistical anomaly." [...] Moving on from this, we could say this about anything and everything. We could say this about professional football players, master chefs and seminal guitar players. None of these people, by EMH logic, should be seen as skilled. Rather, they are just getting lucky over and over again. The professional football players are just getting lucky every time they play well; the master chef is getting lucky every time he cooks a fabulous meal; and the seminal guitar player is just fortunate that his hands move {{in the way that they}} <b>do.</b> <b>At</b> <b>this</b> point, the reader will appreciate the vacuity of the EMH argument.|$|E
