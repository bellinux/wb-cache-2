5|$|The tree {{of heaven}} is a very rapidly growing tree, {{possibly}} the fastest growing tree in North America. Growth of one to two metres (3.3 to 6.6ft) per {{year for the first}} four years is considered normal. Shade considerably <b>hampers</b> growth rates. Older trees, while growing much slower, still do so faster than other trees. Studies found that Californian trees grew faster than their East Coast counterparts, and American trees in general grew faster than Chinese ones.|$|E
5|$|The {{absence of}} air makes outer space an ideal {{location}} for astronomy at all wavelengths {{of the electromagnetic}} spectrum. This {{is evidenced by the}} spectacular pictures sent back by the Hubble Space Telescope, allowing light from more than 13billion years ago—almost to the time of the Big Bang—to be observed. However, not every location in space is ideal for a telescope. The interplanetary zodiacal dust emits a diffuse near-infrared radiation that can mask the emission of faint sources such as extrasolar planets. Moving an infrared telescope out past the dust will increase the effectiveness of the instrument. Likewise, a site like the Daedalus crater {{on the far side of}} the Moon could shield a radio telescope from the radio frequency interference that <b>hampers</b> Earth-based observations.|$|E
5|$|Traditional desert farming {{systems have}} long been {{established}} in North Africa, irrigation being {{the key to success}} in an area where water stress is a limiting factor to growth. Techniques that can be used include drip irrigation, the use of organic residues or animal manures as fertilisers and other traditional agricultural management practises. Once fertility has been built up, further crop production preserves the soil from destruction by wind and other forms of erosion. It has been found that plant growth-promoting bacteria play a role in increasing the resistance of plants to stress conditions and these rhizobacterial suspensions could be inoculated into the soil {{in the vicinity of the}} plants. A study of these microbes found that desert farming <b>hampers</b> desertification by establishing islands of fertility allowing farmers to achieve increased yields despite the adverse environmental conditions. A field trial in the Sonoran Desert which exposed the roots of different species of tree to rhizobacteria and the nitrogen fixing bacterium Azospirillum brasilense with the aim of restoring degraded lands was only partially successful.|$|E

50|$|<b>Hamper</b> {{first began}} writing {{articles}} for the Flint Voice. In fact, {{on the day}} Moore and <b>Hamper</b> were to meet to discuss <b>Hamper's</b> writing for the Flint Voice, Harry Chapin — a long time benefactor for the paper — {{was killed in a}} car accident. <b>Hamper</b> turned around and went home. He did however end up with a writing assignment and rather quickly became a local celebrity who wrote scathing true stories of life on the assembly line. He was kept on when the Flint Voice became the statewide Michigan Voice where he was again one of the more popular writers. When Moore left for Mother Jones in 1986, he brought <b>Hamper</b> over with him and put him on the cover. Moore was fired shortly after. <b>Hamper</b> was asked to keep writing for Mother Jones, but out of loyalty chose not to continue {Rivethead: Tales from the Assembly Line, pg 220}.|$|R

25|$|The {{transfer}} of mail between the inter-island steamer ferries and trains {{used to be}} a significant source of traffic for Lyttelton. Mail items were transported in <b>hampers,</b> bags, or crates, and transferred on and off the ship using slings. Local services were used to transport the mail between Christchurch and the port in postal vans. Following the introduction of the rail-air service in the 1960s, use of the ferries to transport the mail between Christchurch and Wellington declined.|$|E
25|$|The 2010 finals amplified {{international}} {{public awareness}} of the vuvuzela, a long horn blown by fans throughout matches. Many World Cup competitors complained about the noise caused by the vuvuzela horns, including France's Patrice Evra, who blamed the horns for the team's poor performance. Other critics include Lionel Messi, who complained that the sound of the vuvuzelas <b>hampers</b> communication among players on the pitch, and broadcasting companies, which complained that commentators' voices were being drowned out by the sound.|$|E

25|$|Less radical {{theories}} {{suggest that}} economic protectionism {{in developed countries}} <b>hampers</b> Africa's growth. When developing countries have harvested agricultural produce at low cost, they generally do not export as much as would be expected. Abundant farm subsidies and high import tariffs in the developed world, most notably those set by Japan, the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy, and the United States Department of Agriculture, {{are thought to be}} the cause. Although these subsidies and tariffs have been gradually reduced, they remain high.|$|E

25|$|The Forest of Soignes {{lay behind}} the Anglo-allied Army of the Duke of Wellington at the Battle of Waterloo.

Napoleon Bonaparte in Mémoires pour servir à l'histoire de France en 1815, avec le plan de la bataille de Mont-Saint-Jean repeatedly criticised the Duke of Wellington's choice of battle field because of the forest to his rear.|$|E

25|$|Reasons {{cited for}} restricting export from {{countries}} using FMD vaccines include, probably most importantly, routine blood tests relying on antibodies cannot distinguish between an infected and a vaccinated animal, which severely <b>hampers</b> screening of animals used in export products, risking a spread of FMD to importing countries. A widespread preventive vaccination would also conceal {{the existence of}} the virus in a country. From there, it could potentially spread to countries without vaccine programs. Lastly, an animal infected shortly after being vaccinated can harbor and spread FMD without showing symptoms itself, hindering containment and culling of sick animals as a remedy.|$|E
