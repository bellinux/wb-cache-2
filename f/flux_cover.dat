One {{of the most interesting}} results (which is found also in deeper sourveys) is that about 20 % of the hard X-ray selected sources have an X-ray to optical flux ratio (X/O) ten times or more higher than that of optically selected AGN. Unlike the faint sources found in the ultra-deep Chandra and XMM-Newton surveys, which reach X-ray (and optical) fluxes more than one order of magnitude lower than the HELLAS 2 XMM survey sources, many of the extreme X/O sources in our sample have R less than or similar to 25 and are therefore accessible to optical spectroscopy. We report the identification of 13 sources with X/O greater than or similar to 10 (to be compared with 9 sources known from the deeper, pencil-beam surveys). Eight of them are narrow line QSO (seemingly the extension to very high luminosity of the type 2 Seyfert galaxies), four are broad line QSO. The results from our survey are also used to make reliable predictions about the luminosity of the sources not yet spectroscopically identified, both in our sample and in deeper Chandra and XMM-Newton samples.

40|$|Engineered {{waste rock}} cover systems are {{designed}} to prevent the generation of acid mine drainage in sulphide bearing waste rock dumps left from the metal mining process. Typically, the cover systems {{are designed to}} prevent the ingress of water and/or oxygen into the waste rock pile so that oxidization and hence acid generation is minimized. In arid environments the covers are generally designed as water infiltration barriers only. A saturated cover layer is required to prevent oxygen ingress and this is difficult to achieve in an arid climate. Ultimately, {{the success of a}} waste rock cover system is dependent on understanding the relationship between climate, cover and waste material properties, and surface vegetation. One method to determine how successful a cover system will be over the long term is to use predictive numerical modelling software, calibrated from an instrumented test cover site. This gives mine operators and regulatory agencies the ability to evaluate how a cover will perform under typical and extreme climatic conditions. The purpose of the research program described here was to design a zero net infiltrative <b>flux</b> <b>cover</b> system that would eliminate acid drainage at the Kidston Gold Mines in North Queensland, Australia. The mine has three main waste rock dumps, which extend over an area of about 337 ha. The climate is semi-arid with well-defined wet and dry seasons. Mean annual precipitation is approximately 712 mm with more than 80 % of the rainfall occurring between November and April. Total annual potential evaporation was estimated to be about 2300 mm. Historically acid mine drainage was collected in evaporation ponds. The first phase of the research involved characterizing the waste rock and potential cover materials, designing and building two field test covers, and installing instrumentation for monitoring of performance. The majority of this work was carried out by the Unsaturated Soils Group, at the University of Saskatchewan. The design of the cover system required the optimization of water storage and evapotranspiration. Intense rainfall events and associated erosion which occurs in the wet season, required that runoff be eliminated. This requirement demanded that the cover have the ability to store all infiltrating rainfall such that it could subsequently be released to the atmosphere through evapotranspiration. Several cover systems using layers of loose and compacted native soils and waste rock were evaluated using the numerical model SoilCover. Two cover profiles were selected for field-testing based on the net infiltrative flux approaching zero. The first was constructed on a mineralized waste rock dump using 50 cm of compacted, oxidized waste rock overlain by 150 cm of loose oxidized waste rock. This cover was designated the optimum design. The second was constructed on a barren waste rock dump using a single 250 cm layer of loose oxidized waste rock. This cover was designated the alternate design. Both covers had a hummocky surface to promote infiltration and prevent runoff. Construction was completed in December 1996. Seeding of the barren dump cover with pasture grasses took place shortly after construction while seeding of the mineralized dump cover was completed {{at the end of the}} wet season. Instrumentation was installed in both covers to measure infiltration and cover moisture conditions. A weather station was installed to monitor climatic conditions. This thesis presents the results for the second phase of the research program which was carried out by the author. It includes the evaluation of the performance of the two test covers and calibration of the numerical model SoilCover, such that field response and predictive modelling could be carried out. A final cover design is then presented on the basis of these results. The research involved field sampling and laboratory testing, instrumentation, field data reduction and analysis, and field response and predictive numerical modelling. Field results over the period 1996 to 1999 indicated that both covers responded reasonably well. The average precipitation was about 541 mm or 76 % of normal. Instrumentation showed that the water content profile within the covers increased considerably under intense rainstorm events and then quickly decreased during subsequent evapotranspiration. Infiltration from the base of the covers into the underlying waste rock was less than 1 % of average annual precipitation during the three wet seasons. Calibration and field response modelling with the numerical model SoilCover confirmed infiltration values into the waste rock approaching zero. Predictive modelling was then carried out using extreme wet year climate data from 1990 / 1991. Based on 1349 mm of rainfall the calibrated SoilCover model predicted over 50 % infiltration through both cover systems. Further predictive modelling was then carried out assuming improved saturated hydraulic conductivities could be achieved in the compacted layer of the optimum cover design. The results showed that infiltration rates through the cover coul? likely be reduced to between 5 % to 25 % of precipitation during extreme wet year conditions. Final closure cover design is described on the basis of these results...|$|E

Historically, the source has been shown to vary dramatically in 2 - 10 keV flux over timescales of years and was thought to be slowly transitioning between periods of quiescence and active accretion. Our results show that in one year the source continuum <b>flux</b> <b>covered</b> almost the entire historical range, making it unlikely that the low-luminosity states correspond to the accretion mechanism switching off. During flaring episodes we found that a highly redshifted Fe K line appears, implying that the violent activity is occurring in the inner accretion disk, within ~ 100 gravitational radii of the central black hole. We also found that the spectral index of the X-ray continuum remained approximately constant during the large amplitude variability. These observations make NGC 2992 well-suited for future multi-waveband monitoring, as a test-bed for constraining accretion models. Comment: Abstract is abridged.

The extrapolation of the HELLAS log N-log S towards fainter fluxes with a Euclidean slope is consistent with the first XMM-Newton measurements, in the same energy band, which are a factor of 20 times more sensitive. The source counts in the hardest band so far surveyed by X-ray satellites are used to constrain XRB models.

A model spectrum normalized to Hayes (1985) Johnson V <b>flux</b> <b>covers</b> {{the rest of the}} near-infrared interval up to 2. 6 microns. The uncertainty on the absolute flux of the reference spectrum over the optical and nearinfrared range up to 1. 05 microns is about 1. 5 %. For the 1. 05 to 2. 6 micron range the model predicts JHK fluxes 5 % to 6 % lower than the absolute measurements. In the ultraviolet, the uncertainty of the IUE average spectrum is about 5 %. Model spectra based on ATLAS 9 and ATLAS 12 Kurucz’s codes and normalized to Hayes absolute scale are also presented. The model spectra agree with the optical and ultraviolet continuum measurements to 2 % and 10 %, respectively. Differences from 10 % to 20 % are obtained in the cores of the optical and near-infrared absorption lines, when the model and the observed spectra are compared. The absolute flux calibrated spectrum of Vega presented here is used to compute the average fluxes of Vega in Johnson’s UBVRI system and, subsequently, the zero-points fluxes of the photometric system. No reliable near-infrared spectrophotometric measurements of Vega exist to date. The calibrated ATLAS 9 and ATLAS 12 model spectra predict near-infrared JHK fluxes about 5 %- 6 % lower than the measurements.

40|$|We present {{evidence}} supporting the view that, while many flares {{are produced by}} a confined magnetic explosion that does not produce a CME, every CME is produced by an ejective magnetic explosion that also produces a flare. The evidence is that the observed heliocentric angular width of the full-blown CME plasmoid in the outer corona (at 3 to 20 solar radii) is about that predicted by the standard model for CME production, from the amount of magnetic <b>flux</b> <b>covered</b> by the co-produced flare arcade. In the standard model, sheared and twisted sigmoidal field {{in the core of}} an initially closed magnetic arcade erupts. As it erupts, tether-cutting reconnection, starting between the legs of the erupting sigmoid and continuing between the merging stretched legs of the enveloping arcade, simultaneously produces a growing flare arcade and unleashes the erupting sigmoid and arcade to become the low-beta plasmoid (magnetic bubble) that becomes the CME. The flare arcade is the downward product of the reconnection and the CME plasmoid is the upward product. The unleashed, expanding CME plasmoid is propelled into the outer corona and solar wind by its own magnetic field pushing on the surrounding field in the inner and outer corona. This tether-cutting scenario predicts that the amount of magnetic flux in the full-blown CME plasmoid nearly equals that covered by the full-grown flare arcade. This equality predicts (1) the field strength in the flare region from the ratio of the angular width of the CME in the outer corona to angular width of the full-grown flare arcade, and (2) an upper bound on the angular width of the CME in the outer corona from the total magnetic flux in the active region from which the CME explodes. We show that these predictions are fulfilled by observed CMEs. This agreement validates the standard model. The model explains (1) why most CMEs have much greater angular widths than their co-produced flares, and (2) why the radial path of a CME in the outer corona can be laterally far offset from the co-produced flare...|$|R
40|$|Blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) imaging is {{the most}} {{important}} noninvasive tool to map human brain function. It relies on local blood-flow changes controlled by neurovascular coupling effects, usually in response to some cognitive or perceptual task. In this contribution we ask if the spatiotemporal dynamics of the BOLD signal can be modeled by a conservation law. In analogy to the description of physical laws, which often can be derived from some underlying conservation law, identification of conservation laws in the brain could lead to new models for the functional organization of the brain. Our model is independent {{of the nature of the}} conservation law, but we discuss possible hints and motivations for conservation laws. For example, globally limited blood supply and local competition between brain regions for blood might restrict the large scale BOLD signal in certain ways that could be observable. One proposed selective pressure for the evolution of such conservation laws is the closed volume of the skull limiting the expansion of brain tissue by increases in blood volume. These ideas are demonstrated on a mental motor imagery fMRI experiment, in which functional brain activation was mapped in a group of volunteers imagining themselves swimming. In order to search for local conservation laws during this complex cognitive process, we derived maps of quantities resulting from spatial interaction of the BOLD amplitudes. Specifically, we mapped fluxes and sources of the BOLD signal, terms that would appear in a description by a continuity equation. Whereas we cannot present final answers with the particular analysis of this particular experiment, some results seem to be non-trivial. For example, we found that during task the group BOLD <b>flux</b> <b>covered</b> more widespread regions than identified by conventional BOLD mapping and was always increasing during task. It is our hope that these results motivate more work towards the search for conservation laws in neuroimaging experiments or at least towards imaging procedures based on spatial interactions of signals.

The upper ocean response is computed using a time dependent, linear, reduced gravity model, {{with the addition of}} a constant depth frictional surface layer. The full three-dimensional temperature equation and a surface heat flux parameterization that requires specification of only wind speed and total cloud cover are used to evaluate the SST. Specification of atmospheric parameters, such as air temperature and humidity, over which the ocean has direct influence, is avoided. The model simulates the major features of the observed tropical Pacific SST. The seasonal evolution of these features is generally captured by the model. Analysis of the results demonstrates the control the ocean has over the surface heat flux from ocean to atmosphere and the crucial role that dynamics play in determining the mean SST in the equatorial Pacific. The sensitivity of the model to perturbations in the surface heat <b>flux,</b> cloud <b>cover</b> specification, diffusivity, and mixed layer depth is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The small {{hydraulic}} diameters employed during flow boiling in compact evaporator passages {{are becoming}} more important as they are employed in diverse applications including electronics cooling and fuel cell evaporators. The high pressure drop characteristics of these passages are particularly important as they alter the flow and heat transfer, especially in parallel multi-channel configuration. The pressure drop oscillations often introduce dryout in some passages while their neighboring passages operate under single-phase mode. This paper presents {{a comprehensive review of}} literature on evaporation in small diameter passages along with some results obtained by the author for water evaporating in 1 -mm hydraulic diameter multi-channel passages.

40|$|We {{present the}} results of the five mid-IR 15 microns (12 - 18 microns LW 3 band) ISOCAM Guaranteed Time Extragalactic Surveys {{performed}} in the regions of the Lockman Hole and Marano Field. The roughly 1000 sources detected, 600 of which have a flux above the 80 % completeness limit, guarantee a very high statistical significance for the integral and differential source counts from 0. 1 mJy up to 5 mJy. By adding the ISOCAM surveys of the HDF-North and South (plus flanking fields) and the lensing cluster A 2390 at low fluxes and IRAS at high <b>fluxes,</b> we <b>cover</b> four decades in flux from 50 microJy to 0. 3 Jy. The slope of the differential counts is very steep (alpha =- 3. 0) in the flux range 0. 4 - 4 mJy, hence much above the Euclidean expectation of alpha =- 2. 5. When compared with no-evolution models based on IRAS, our counts show a factor of 10 excess at 400 microJy, and a fast convergence, with alpha =- 1. 6 at lower fluxes.

40|$|On each of {{the four}} Cluster {{spacecraft}} a particle correlator experiment operates which measures the time structuring of the electrons as a function of energy. The Cluster particle correlators are implemented by producing on board ACFs (Auto Correlation Functions) generated from time series of electron counts obtained from the PEACE HEEA sensor. The information on the electron <b>flux</b> modulation <b>covers</b> the frequency range DC up to 41 kHz (encompassing typical electron plasma frequencies and electron gyro frequencies and their harmonics), the electron energy range is that covered by the PEACE HEEA sensor (within the range 1 eV to 26 keV). Results are presented of coherent electron structures observed simultaneously by the four spacecraft in two different types of interaction regions. Firstly, measurements are shown of electron bunching associated with natural sporadic broad band wave emissions up to a few kHz observed in the magnetosheath. Secondly, measurements are presented of electron bunching associated with sustained monochromatic Langmuir waves at tens of kHz observed in the solar wind. The results are discussed in the context of instabilities in the plasma electron population in these two regions...|$|R
40|$|Although it {{has been}} proven that the Arctic is {{important}} in the present functioning of Earth and its life and is particularly sensitive to climate change, little is known about benthic ecosystem functioning in the Arctic Oceans. Therefore, to identify the variables structuring benthic functioning, during the summer of 2014 a bathymetric gradient was sampled on both sides of Fram Strait with multiyear ice in the west and a summer ice - free area in the east. The sampled variables included information about the environmental setting, fauna present and biogeochemical <b>fluxes.</b> Ice <b>cover</b> was found to determine the food availability, which in turn affected faunal density, macrofaunal community composition and bioirrigation rate. In summer ice - free areas underneath the marginal ice zone, food availability was higher and therefore meiofaunal density and bio - irrigation were higher as well. Macrofaunal density was only partly explained by food input and total oxygen uptake as a part of benthic remineralisation was mainly structured by silt fraction in the sediment. Water depth determined faunal community composition, with lower macrofaunal biomass and functional diversity in the deeper areas...|$|R
40|$|The chronopotentiogram of a bare 1 mm 2 Ag/AgCl {{electrode}} shows {{a transition}} {{time in the}} order of 9 s at a current density of − 25 A/m 2 at pCl = 2. At this time the concentration of Cl− ions is completely depleted, a phenomenon that can be explained by using the Nernst-Planck <b>flux</b> equations. <b>Covering</b> the electrode with an 8 μm thick membrane of polystyrene beads and repeating the chronopoteniometric experiment results in a decrease of the transition time by a factor of 50. This {{can be explained by the}} Donnan effect resulting from the fixed negative membrane charge originating from the acidic groups of the polystyrene. Modulating the fixed charge by adsorbing protein molecules inside the porous membrane from a sample solution results in a variation of the transition time as a function of the sample protein concentration. As an example, it is shown that positively charged lysozyme neutralizes the initial negative membrane charge, thus increasing the transition time. The advantage of this type of protein concentration measurement is its simplicity: only a membrane-covered electrode is needed through which a current is sent, and from the resulting electrode potential change the transition time is determined...|$|R
40|$|Aims. Hard X-ray, large-area {{surveys are}} a {{fundamental}} complement to ultra-deep, pencil-beam surveys in obtaining more complete {{coverage of the}} AGN luminosity-redshift plane and finding sizeable samples of "rare" AGN. Methods. We present {{the results of the}} photometric and spectroscopic identification of 110 hard X-ray selected sources from 5 additional XMM-Newton fields, nearly doubling the original HELLAS 2 XMM sample. Their 2 - 10 keV <b>fluxes</b> <b>cover</b> the range 6 x 10 (- 15) - 4 x 10 (- 13) erg cm(- 2) s(- 1) and the total area surveyed is similar to 0. 5 deg(2) at the bright flux limit. We spectroscopically identified 59 new sources, bringing the spectroscopic completeness of the full HELLAS 2 XMM sample to almost 70 % over a total area of similar to 1. 4 deg(- 2) at the bright flux limit. We found optical counterparts for 214 out of the 232 X-ray sources of the full sample down to R similar to 25. We measured the flux and luminosity of the [OIII]lambda 5007 emission line for 59 of these sources. Results. Assuming that most high X-ray-to-optical flux ratio sources are obscured QSOs, we used the full HELLAS 2 XMM sample and the CDF samples to estimate their log N-log S. We find obscured QSOs surface density of 45 15 and 100 - 350 deg(- 2) down to flux limits of 10 (- 14) and 10 (- 15) erg cm- 2 s- 1, respectively. At these flux limits, the fraction of X-ray-selected obscured QSOs turns out to be similar to that of unobscured QSOs. Since X-ray selection misses most Compton-thick AGN, the number of obscured QSOs may well outnumber the unobscured QSOs. We find that hard X-ray selected AGNs with a detected [OIII] emission span a wide range of L 2 - 10 keV/L-[OIII] with a logarithmic median of 2. 14 and interquartile range of 0. 38. This is marginally higher than for a sample of optically selected AGNs (median 1. 69 and interquatile range 0. 30), suggesting that optically selected samples are at least partly incomplete and/or that [OIII] emission is not a perfect isotropic indicator of the nuclear power. The seven X-ray bright, optically normal galaxy (XBONG) candidates in the sample have L 2 - 10 keV/L-[OIII] greater than or similar to 1000, while their X-ray and optical luminosities and obscuring column density {{are similar to those of}} narrow-line AGNs in the same redshift interval (0. 075 - 0. 32). This suggests that, while the central engine of narrow-line AGNs and XBONGs looks similar, the narrow-line region in XBONGs could be strongly inhibited or obscured...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} {{construction}} of G-flux in singular elliptic Calabi-Yau fourfold compactifications of F-theory, {{which in the}} local limit allow a spectral cover description. The main tool of construction is the so-called spectral divisor in the resolved Calabi-Yau geometry, which in the local limit reduces to the Higgs bundle spectral cover. We exemplify the workings {{of this in the}} case of an E_ 6 singularity by constructing the resolved geometry, the spectral divisor and in the local limit, the spectral cover. The G-flux constructed with the spectral divisor is shown to be equivalent to the direct construction from suitably quantized linear combinations of holomorphic surfaces in the resolved geometry, and in the local limit reduces to the spectral <b>cover</b> <b>flux.</b> Comment: 30 page...|$|R
