The density of volcanic ash varies between 700–1200kg/m3 for pumice, 2350–2450kg/m3 for glass shards, 2700–3300kg/m3 for crystals, and 2600–3200kg/m3 for lithic particles. Since coarser and denser particles are deposited close to source, fine glass and pumice shards are relatively enriched in ash fall deposits at distal locations.

25|$|The {{large amount}} of mineral in enamel {{accounts}} {{not only for its}} strength but also for its brittleness.

40|$|Abstract − In {{this paper}} two methods for an {{improved}} {{characterization of the}} geometry of Rockwell diamond indenters are investigated: The establishment of a group standard of indenters and the derivation of an area function with a nano measuring machine. A group standard of indenters yields better statistical results than the calibration using only one indenter. Further, a group standard of indenters guarantees a higher stability of the Rockwell <b>hardness</b> <b>scales</b> in the case that an indenter is damaged and must {{be replaced by a}} new one. The second approach is based on the correction of the hardness test values using the indenter’s area function determined by a high accuracy nano measuring machine. The investigation has proven that the range of the hardness deviations of a group of three Rockwell indenters amounting to ca. 0. 4 HRC by the application of an area function with corrected hardness values can be further reduced to < 0. 2 HRC for the lower hardnesses and to < 0. 3 HRC for the higher hardnesses. The mean deviation of HRC values measured by this group of Rockwell indenters has been reduced from 0. 11 HRC to 0. 06 HRC by using the proposed correction method. In future correction methods for Rockwell diamond indenters usable for all standardized Rockwell <b>hardness</b> <b>scales</b> should be derived...|$|R

An even more general scaling law is then formulated, also in the fast and slow dynamics; it is based only on the surface over volume ratio of the domain in which the energy flux occurs: thus, its application in different fields, also for chaotic and complex (e. g., biological) systems, is demonstrated...|$|R
