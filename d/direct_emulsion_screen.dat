They have a fat potential similar to skin composition, leading to the improved performance of these product. Aims: Improve the emulsions spreadability through prior screening of grease composition and studying the viscosity, and the emulsions accelerated stability. Methods: Emulsions were formulated using oils from semiarid plants from Bahia: Syagrus coronate, Pachira retusa, and Pachira aquatica, so as to compare them with oils already standard {{in the production of}} cosmetics. Spreadability and stability tests were made comparing the results. The same criteria were used with Amazon seed butter: Virola surinamensis, Butyrospermum parkii, Astrocaryum murumuru, Theobroma cacao and Theobroma grandiflorum. For the <b>emulsions</b> <b>screening</b> and performance, a system was developed for oil/ butter, following tests of accelerated stability, viscosity, and spreadability. Results: The combined system of spreadability was optimized using screening. Emollients containing oleic and palmitic acids, and light chain fatty acids obtained good spreadability. The oil emulsion containing Pachira retusa and Virola surinamensis butter had a higher viscosity. Conclusions: With high content of fatty acids such as oleic, palmitic or the light chain fatty acids obtain an appropriated appearance, texture, and spreadability for cosmetic use.

40|$|There {{are many}} {{developed}} {{strategies in the}} emulsion stability evaluation, for purpose of determining the life circle of emulsions. Most of them {{are based on the}} reological properties of the emulsions. There are very few which relay on the <b>direct</b> <b>emulsion</b> observations. In this paper we present the developed method for the emulsion stability evaluation by the direct observation of optical properties. As the stability quantification measure we propose the fractal dimension approach. The method is based on the measure of the emulsion transmittance properties, which are directly dependent on the emulsion stability at the moment of measurement. As the test emulsion the oil in the water emulsion was used. The system is classified as the stable emulsion and our intention was to find the moment when the emulsion starts to break. The emulsion transmittance properties were measured using an acquisition system, consisting of a CCD camera and a fast PC configuration equipped with the capturing software. The fractal dimensions were determined by the so called box counting method. The experimental emulsions were measured continuously within the period of 1200 h, from the moment of the emulsion creation. The changes of fractal dimensions were observed which indicates that the emulsion changed its state and therefore the stability during the time. Three regions of the emulsion life circle were divided according to the fractal dimensions measurement, which can be connected with the stable, unstable, and meta-stable states of the emulsion life circle. In the end, the model of the emulsion behavior was developed for the purpose of quantifying the changes in the experimental emulsion...|$|R

The model system is used to study the fundamental conditions under which {{the different kinds of}} polymer-stabilized <b>emulsions</b> (<b>direct</b> oil in water, inverse water in oil and multiple emulsions) are stabilized or destabilized by pH change (at constant temperature). Polymer properties like chain conformation at the toluene-water interface as probed by SANS and neutron reflectivity at the liquid-liquid interface, the oil-water partitioning of the polymer chains (Bancroft's rule of thumb) as determined by UV spectroscopy and interfacial tensions measured by the rising and spinning drop techniques are determined. Overall, results evidence that the curvature sign, as defined by positive and negative values as the chain segments occupy preferentially the water and toluene sides of the interface respectively, reliably predicts the emulsion kind. In contrast, the Bancroft rule failed at foreseeing the emulsion type. In the region of near zero curvature the crossover from <b>direct</b> to inverse <b>emulsions</b> occurs through the formation of either unstable coexisting <b>direct</b> and inverse <b>emulsions</b> (i) or multiple emulsions (ii). The high compact adsorption of the chains at the interface as shown by low interfacial tension values does not allow to discriminate between both cases. However, the toluene-water partitioning of the polymeric emulsifier is still a key factor driving the formation of (i) or (ii) emulsions. Interestingly, the stabilization of the multiple emulsions can be tuned to a large extent as the toluene-water polymer partitioning can be adjusted using quite a large number of physico-chemical parameters linked to polymer architecture like diblock length ratio or polymer total molar mass, for example. Moreover, we show that monitoring the oil-water partitioning aspect of the emulsion system {{can also be used to}} lower the interfacial tension at low pH to values slightly higher than 0. 01 mN m- 1, irrespective of the curvature sign...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} arose {{out of a}} desire to test the {{assumption}} that in order to obtain direct stencils with good edge definition, one either had to use fine screens or. If using a relatively coarse screen, apply multiple coatings of <b>emulsion</b> to the <b>screen</b> before making the stencil. Neither alternative seemed satisfactory, since the first did not allow optimal use of the scope of screens available, and the second entailed an expenditure of time and supplies that could possibly be shown to be unnecessary. It was therefore determined to carry on an experiment that would show whether direct stencils with good edge definition can be obtained on relatively coarse screens with only one, or at most two applications of emulsion. The experiment thus envisioned also provided an opportunity to observe the influence on two other factors on stencil edge definition, besides those of mesh count and <b>emulsion</b> thickness: namely, <b>screen</b> thread diameter and coater blade thick ness. What finally evolved was a three-factor, three-levelled factorial experiment, in which the variables under study were* screen mesh count, thread diameter and emulsion thick ness. The fourth factor came into play when the experiment was run once for emulsions applied with a thick-bladed coater, and once for those applied with a thin-bladed coater. The specific question under study was: in the direct stencil system, is there a difference in the quality of edge definition obtainable with variations in screen mesh count, screen thread diameter, coater blade thickness and the number of emulsion coatings applied? Eighteen screens were stretched expressly for the experiment, representing three different mesh counts and three different thread diameters for each mesh count. Each screen was prepared {{in such a way as}} to receive three stencils of varying thickness per screen. All stencils were exposed to a test target designed to allow for the observation of diagonal and parallel stencil edges (i. e., diagonal or parallel with relation to screen thread direction). After the stencils were made, they were visually inspected, and the data obtained thereby was subjected to an analysis of variance. The results obtained showed that of the four factors studied, mesh count was the only one that made a clear difference in the quality of stencil edge definition. What the experiment did not conclusively show was whether or not coater blade thickness had any influence on that quality. Nevertheless, what is perhaps of greater significance to the printer in Industry Is that the experiment did show that on a coarse screen a stencil with good parallel edge definition could be obtained with only one coating of emulsion (as one coating was defined in the experiment) ...|$|R

40|$|Introduction & Background: X-photons have an im-portant role in disease {{diagnosis}} in medical examina-tion by radiography. The correct employment of ra-diation reduces patients and radiographers over-exposure; it also increases half-life of the machine. In order to use high doses especially in bulky masses, over-exposure occurs for the patient. The {{aim of this}} study is to investigate varied rates of received doses in patients by two green and blue spectrum sensitive films. Patients & Methods: To determine differences be-tween the patients received doses, data were collected from conditions in which two sensitive films to green and blue spectrum were used. These data include, KV, mass, FFD, and radiation dose. Radiation dose was determined in terms of mili-rontgen per mili-ampere per minute. Results: Obtained results showed different rates in the two sensitive films. The greatest radiation for lat-eral lumbar, lumbar thoracic, maxillary or frontal si-nuses, abdomen and pelvis were 1218. 37, 750. 45, 574. 2, 466. 6 and 466. 6 respectively. The lowest radia-tions for the same regions were 620. 01, 519. 84, 408. 04, 285. 1 and 245. 76 respectively. Discussion: Our results revealed that radiation dose (mR) was significantly different between the two sensitive films to the green and blue spectrums. The reduction in green spectrum sensitive film was due to AgBr (I) <b>emulsions</b> and intensifying <b>screen.</b> Although the condition was meant to reduce exposure, image resolution and diagnostic power were also reduced. Therefore to obtain a high resolution image, blue spectrum sensitive films are sometimes used, resulting in patients over-exposure. In general, we suggest that in order to reduce exposure and get higher resolution, these two films can be used for radiography...|$|R

Furthermore, emulsions showed good stability during storage and towards mild centrifugation. Antibacterial activity of the emulsions investigated using agar diffusion and broth dilution methods was mainly influenced by the type and content of antibacterial oil.

The oils used for this study were cinnamon, oregano, clove, thyme, rosemary, sage, bergamot, nutmeg, lemon grass and bay. Oil in water emulsions were prepared using Tween 80 as an emulsifying agent, with a stock oil concentration in the emulsions of 20, 000 ppm. Essential oil <b>emulsions</b> were individually <b>screened</b> against E. coli (ATCC 25922), E. coli (ATCC 700927), L. monocytogens (ATCC 19115), L. innocua (ATCC 33090) and S. Typhimurium (ATCC 19585) using the broth micro dilution method. Cinnamon showed the highest antimicrobial efficacy against all test organisms, as determined by the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Oregano had the second highest efficacy, while the other oils did not exhibit high antimicrobial activities. To determine synergistic effect of the emulsions, combinations were tested using checkerboard method. The only synergism observed was between cinnamon and oregano against E. coli (ATCC 700927) and L. innocua (ATCC 33090) and also between cinnamon and clove towards L. innocua (ATCC 33090). All other combinations were additive or indifferent in nature to the test organisms. To determine antimicrobial activity of the essential oils on food, chicken pieces were inoculated with the bacteria standardized in CAMHB, and consequently treated with a twofold concentration of the individual in vitro MIC of the EOs that expressed synergism. The pieces were placed in 60 mm dishes and stored under refrigeration at 4 ºC. Samples were prepared for day 0, day 1, day 3 and day 6 for each bacterial treatment.

40|$|The {{central theme}} of this thesis is the interplay between colloids and interfaces. The {{adsorption}} of colloids at fluid-fluid interfaces is the main topic and covers Chapters 2 - 6. Pickering emulsions where colloidal particles act as emulsion stabilizers {{in the absence of}} surfactants are studied in a number of systems with different colloids, particle shapes and oils. Interfacial particle adsorption is widely employed in food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical applications and plays a pivotal role in oil recovery and metallurgical refining. The conditions under which Pickering emulsions may form spontaneously are discussed in Chapter 2. The spontaneous formation and the stability of the Pickering emulsions of varying composition are achieved by a collective effect of solid particles, amphiphilic ions and interfacial tensions of the bare oil-water interface of ~ 10 mN/m or below. The observed stability and formation of emulsions of different composition point to a new class of solid-stabilized meso-emulsions. The effect of particle shape anisotropy in the stabilization of emulsions is investigated in Chapter 3 by employing for the first time cubic, ellipsoidal and peanut-type hematite microparticles. The interfacial packing and orientation of these anisotropic microparticles are revealed at the single particle level by <b>direct</b> microscopic observations. <b>Emulsions</b> are stable against further coalescence for at least one year. The creation of surfactant-free Pickering foams with anisotropic hematite microparticles and their dependence on ionic strength are studied in Chapter 4. The microparticles cover bubbles by densely packed interfacial monolayers that provide high stability against disproportionation and coalescence. Moreover, solid-stabilized air bubbles are used as scaffolds for the creation of free-standing particle films that are, in fact, inorganic bilayers that only consist of cubes. In Chapter 5 the self-assembly of colloidal silica cubes at oil-water interfaces is discussed. A combination of optical and laser scanning confocal microscopy enables the in-situ study of both the packing as well as the orientation of the colloidal cubes at the interface. Single layers of cubic particles arrange in ordered domains, displaying a packing intermediate between cubic and hexagonal. Moreover, the cubes show a preference for orienting parallel with the interface. Solid-stabilized emulsions from natural resources are presented in Chapter 6 by using colloids, prepared from the water-insoluble corn protein zein, and soy bean oil. Zein colloids are synthesized via an anti-solvent precipitation procedure and employed in the formation of stable oil-in-water Pickering emulsions as a function of particle concentration, pH and ionic strength. Finally, a thermo-reversible colloid-in-tube co-assembly approach that couples molecular self-assembly with colloidal self-assembly is introduced in Chapter 7. While surfactant and cyclodextrin molecules form microtubes, colloids assemble into a library of dynamic colloidal structures within those microtubes. Isotropic spheres form straight, zigzag, and zipper chains depending on the tube-sphere size ratio. Double and triple helical structures, a common occurrence in nature, were even generated from colloidal spheres. Moreover, we demonstrate that the co-assembly of microtubes and colloids is generic for colloids with different shapes and materials. The hierarchical colloid-in-tube co-assembly provides a novel route to temperature-sensitive particle alignment and their release near human-body temperature...|$|R

However, reports suggest that only less than 1 % of these microscopic organisms are cultivable (Torsvik et al. 1990; Sleator et al. 2008). Until recently {{with the development}} of metagenomic techniques, the knowledge of microbial diversity and their metabolic capabilities has been limited to this small fraction of cultivable organisms (Handelsman et al. 1998). While metagenomics has undoubtedly revolutionised the field of microbiology and biotechnology it has been generally acknowledged that the current approaches for metagenomic bio- rospecting / screening have limitations which hinder this approach to fully access the metabolic potentials and genetic variations contained in microbial genomes (Beloqui et al. 2008). In particular, the construction of metagenomic libraries and heterologous expression are amongst the major obstacles. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop an ultra-high throughput approach for screening enzyme activities using uncloned metagenomic DNA, thereby eliminating cloning steps, and employing in vitro heterologous expression. To achieve this, three widely used techniques: cell-free transcription-translation, in vitro compartmentalisation (IVC) and Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) were combined to develop this robust technique called metagenomic in vitro compartmentalisation (mIVC-FACS). Moreover, the E. coli commercial cell-free system was used in parallel to a novel, in-house Rhodococcus erythropolis based cell-free system. The versatility of this technique was tested by identifying novel beta-xylosidase encoding genes derived from a thermophilic compost metagenome. In addition, the efficiency of mIVC-FACS was compared to the traditional metagenomic approaches; function-based (clone library screening) and sequence-based (shotgun sequencing and PCR screening). The results obtained here show that the R. erythropolis cell-free system was over thirty-fold more effective than the E. coli based system based on the number of hits obtained per million double <b>emulsions</b> (dE) droplets <b>screened.</b> Six beta-xylosidase encoding genes were isolated and confirmed from twenty-eight positive dE droplets. Most of the droplets that were isolated from the same gate encoded the same enzyme, indicating that this technique is highly selective. A comparison of the hit rate of this screening approach with the traditional E. coli based fosmid library method shows that mIVC-FACS is at least 2. 5 times more sensitive. Although only a few hits from the mIVC-FACS screening were selected for confirmation of beta-xylosidase activity, the proposed hit rate suggests that a significant number of positive hits are left un-accessed through the traditional clone library screening system. In addition, these results also suggest that E. coli expression system might be intrinsically sub-optimal for screening for hemicellulases from environmental genomes compared to R. erythropolis system. The workflow required for screening one million clones in a fosmid library was estimated to be about 320 hours compared to 144 hours required via the mIVC-FACS screening platform. Some of the gene products obtained in both screening platforms show multiple substrate activities, suggesting that the microbial consortia of composting material consist of microorganisms that produce enzymes with multiple lignocellulytic activities. While this platform still requires optimisation, we have demonstrated that this technique can be used to isolate genes encoding enzymes from mixed microbial genomes. mIVC-FACS is a promising technology with the potential to take metagenomic studies to the second generation of novel natural products bio-prospecting. The astonishing sensitivity and ultra-high throughput capacity of this technology offer numerous advantages in metagenomic bio-prospecting. National Research Foundation (NRF...|$|R
40|$|Advanced {{control is}} {{becoming}} imperative for various processes, and polymerization processes are absolutely no exception. The major objectives of on-line {{monitoring and control}} of polymerization processes are maintaining the process safety, manufacturing polymers with well-defined properties, and reducing costs. Polymers are found in a large variety of products. It is a well accepted fact that a significant quantity of polymers are manufactured in emulsion polymerization, and that the economic importance of these products is beyond question. The reaction medium in emulsion polymerization involves the dispersion {{of one or more}} monomers (which are usually partially or totally hydrophobic) in a continuous aqueous phase* with a water soluble initiator and an emulsifier. The reaction therefore takes place under heterogeneous conditions, and the final product, called a latex, consists of suspended polymer particles in water, stabilized by the emulsifier. Industrial emulsion polymerization processes can be classified into two groups according to the final use of the latex. In some emulsion polymerization processes the produced latex is an intermediate product, and it is coagulated after the fact to give the final bulk polymer (e. g. polyvinyl chloride, styrene butadiene rubber). In other processes, the produced polymer is used directly (or perhaps after some intermediate formulation steps) {{in the form of a}} latex. Polymers produced in this way are used as water-based paints (acrylics lattices), adhesives (polyvinyl acetate latex), and finishes for textiles, paper or leather (acrylic polymers). * Of course not all emulsions use water as the continuous phase. Water-in-oil, or inverse processes also exist. However, we will limit our discussion to the more common oil-in-water processes. The final latex properties depend on the polymer molecular weight distribution, particle size distribution, morphology, glass transition temperature, and composition (when several monomers are used). These properties are strongly determined by the amount and type of additives, initiator, emulsifier and chain transfer agent, the monomer addition policy, the reaction temperature and the reactor configuration. Hence, emulsion polymerization processes are characterized by a large number of manipulated variables, which means that, in order to describe the relationships between them, we would need highly complex process model. In order to ensure the economical production of a polymer with the desired properties under safe conditions, important decisions must usually be made during plant operation, by means of automatic on-line control. In the context of control, the process is a dynamic system (described by a set of differential equations) with well-known inputs (that can usually be used as manipulated variables), process 'states' that are the variables representing the evolution of the process, and finally measured process outputs (which are usually a combination of the process states). Control of the process states is based on a suitable process model. It also requires some on-line state measurements. In spite of the importance of emulsion polymerization, process control is still a particularly difficult task. The difficulties in controlling emulsion polymerization are often associated with the lack of on-line measurements of several properties, the high reaction rate, the sensitivity of the reaction to small amounts of additives, and the highly complex reaction networks that result in a complex nonlinear model combined with a number of unknown variables. One of the main control objectives in an emulsion polymerization process is to track polymer composition. This is of absolute importance in terms of final properties of the produced polymer-e. g. glass transition temperature, particle morphology, mechanical and chemical resistances. Controlling polymer composition is indispensable if several monomers with different reactivity ratios are involved in the reaction at a nonazeotropic monomer composition, which is the case of most industrial systems. If no control action is taken in this case, the polymer composition will vary during the reaction, and this will lead to a heterogeneity in the polymer properties (unless the polymer is made in a CSTR). Polymer composition can however be controlled by employing appropriate monomer feed flow rates. The most efficient monomer addition policy, in terms of composition control and simultaneous minimization of process time consists of applying a variable monomer feed flow rate of the more reactive monomer(s), that should be a function of the residual amount of monomer remaining in the reactor and their reactivity ratios. Therefore, controlling polymer composition requires on-line measurement of the polymer composition and the instantaneous quantity of residual monomers, an adequate mathematical model correlating the monomer feed flow rates with the produced polymer composition (inputs-outputs), and finally the use of a robust control technique. On-line sensors developed for the <b>direct</b> monitoring of <b>emulsion</b> polymerization can be classified into two broad categories: sensors that require a sampling device or a circulating loop to perform the analysis (e. g. gas chromatography and densimetry), and in situ sensors (e. g. Spectroscopic and ultrasonic probes). The copolymer composition can be monitored by means of on-line gas chromatography (based on the analysis of the residual monomer), or by densimetry (if combined with an additional sensor). However, the measurements in these sensors present some difficulties related to the latex sampling and treatment, and sometimes, time delays caused by long analysis times. This is not to say that we cannot use these sensors, by rather we must be aware of their limitations. In the second category, the analysis is performed in the reactor, and therefore problems related to time delays and to plugging of the sampling loop are minimized. However, some sensors such as the infrared spectroscopy, while very promising, are still in the stage of development, and we are still faced with the problem of coagulation on the sensor. When these techniques become available, they will provide valuable information on the state of the reactor. Nevertheless, given the complicated nature of emulsion systems, we will still need to apply advanced control strategies such as those outlined in what follows. Due to the difficulty of performing on-line measurements of all the states of the process, combined with a lack of accurate phenomenological models, estimation techniques have been developed to infer estimates of certain variables that are not available on-line, from auxiliary measurements. State observers, or software sensors, are designed based on the process model and on the process outputs. If the observability conditions are satisfied, the observer reconstructs some of the unmeasurable states of the model from the available measurements. Good state observers can overcome modeling uncertainties and measurement noise, and are therefore useful for process monitoring, control, fault detection, and are also used as filters of random effects associated to the measurements. Despite the highly nonlinear behavior of the polymerization process, mainly due to the reaction rate, linear estimation (e. g. Kalman filter) techniques have usually been used to infer information about the evolution of several unmeasurable states of the process. Similarly, linear control techniques (PID, adaptive) have usually been applied to track several variables of the linearized nonlinear system. This is due to the difficulty of dealing with nonlinear systems and to the fact that nonlinear estimators are usually restricted to a class of nonlinear systems. However, linear estimation and control techniques are inadequate for highly nonlinear processes. Nowadays, recent developments in nonlinear theory allow us to implement nonlinear estimation (e. g. high gain observer) and control (e. g. geometric control) techniques to several classes of systems without extensive calculations. The main objective of this research is to apply such nonlinear techniques to estimate and control the polymer composition, and to maximize the process productivity under safe reactor operation. The fundamental on-line information about the evolution of the process is obtained by calorimetry. Calorimetry is often useful in vinyl polymerization reactions, since they tend to be very exothermic. On an industrial level, the main use of calorimetry is currently reactor safety (by reactor temperature control), and the estimation of the rate of heat produced by the polymerization, which is proportional to the overall reaction rate. In Chapter 2 we will review the theoretical nonlinear estimation and control techniques that will be used throughout this research. Calorimetry will be discussed in Chapter 3. The observer development to estimate the polymer composition in co- and terpolymerization processes is presented in Chapters 4 and 5. In Chapter 6, we develop a control strategy for polymer composition for both co- and terpolymerization processes. Finally, in Chapter 7, we treat the topic "Maximizing productivity under safe conditions", where the polymer composition is controlled and the reaction rate is simultaneously maintained at a predefined maximum limit. La nécessité de produire des polymères avec des propriétés spécifiques et reproductibles, de minimiser le temps et les coûts et de contrôler la sécurité de l'expérience nous contraint à utiliser des méthodes avancées de contrôle de procédés de polymérisation. Les polymères sont aujourd'hui utilisés dans des domaines différents. Une grande partie de ces polymères est produite en émulsion.
