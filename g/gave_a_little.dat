25|$|In {{the fifth}} round, Mayweather {{connected}} {{with a series of}} straight rights and lefts; when N'dou would not go down, Mayweather <b>gave</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> smile and continued the barrage. He dominated his opponent, before flooring him with a series of rights in the seventh round. N'dou got up on shaky legs, forcing a stoppage at 1:50. At times during the fight, Mayweather (in black trunks outlined with fur) seemed to toy with N'dou. By the end of 2003, Mayweather was still The Ring's lightweight champion and the #5-ranked best pound-for-pound boxer in the world.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{positive to}} fair reviews. Alan Sepinwall, television journalist for The Star-Ledger, said [...] "Boys' Club" [...] was funnier that previous episode and included scenes with good physical comedy involving Leslie, particularly when she spilled the beer bottles; he also praised Andy's [...] "naked crutch chase". Matt Fowler of IGN said the episode <b>gave</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more insight into Leslie's [...] "aspirations {{about wanting to}} be a woman who succeeds in government, which {{is a step in the}} right direction", but Fowler said her constant mistakes and wrong decisions bog down the story. Fowler said the best part of the episode was Andy's subplot, particularly the scene in which he hops down the street naked on his crutches. Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B- grade, and said the Amy Poehler character needs to be more fully formed in future episodes. Phipps said most of the show's laughs came from supporting characters Andy, Tom and Ron; he also particularly praised Ron's shutdown of Leslie's hearing and his monologues of the ideal government: [...] "One guy, who sits in a small room at a desk. And the only thing he’s allowed to decide is who to nuke." [...] Jeremy Medina of Entertainment Weekly liked that the episode included a moral crisis of sorts for Leslie, who he described as [...] "a realized character instead of a caricature".|$|E
2500|$|After {{the murder}} of Giovanni Falcone, Calderone <b>gave</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> noticed but {{accurate}} analysis of the attack: [...] "Such a spectacular public bombing is never {{in the interest of}} the Mafia … it is a sign of weakness." [...] The killing had become necessary because of a series of major defeats, according to Calderone. [...] "Falcone had been condemned to death a long time ago, but the sentence could no longer be put off for two reasons: the Supreme Court’s decision to confirm the life sentences of the bosses of the Commission … and the increasing certainty that Falcone would be super-prosecutor. As long as convictions could be overturned in Rome, there was no need to act. But a definitive life sentence unleashed a reaction of rage. The Corleonesi and the winning families lost their heads." [...] He went on to predict that other killings would soon follow: [...] "Cosa Nostra has a little book and for every name there is a time." ...|$|E

2500|$|Introduced in showrooms on 28 February 1975, the Pacer was {{designed}} to attract buyers of traditional large cars to a smaller package {{during a time when}} gasoline prices were projected to rise dramatically. In its first year of production, the Pacer sold well, with 145,528 units. [...] There was little competition from other American manufacturers, most of whom had been blindsided by the oil crisis. The increased demand for compact, economy vehicles was growing rapidly. However, Pacer sales fell after the first two years, though the car continued to be built through the 1980 model year. Similar to its mid-year introduction, on 3 December 1979, production of the Pacer ended at the Kenosha, Wisconsin assembly plant where it had begun five years earlier. A total of 280,000 cars were built. Increasing competition from the Big Three U.S. automakers and the rapid consumer shift to imported cars during the late 1970s are cited as the reasons for this outcome. Automobile buyers in the U.S. became adjusted to smaller and lighter cars, particularly the imports that offered better gas mileage presented, the AMC Pacer could not match the German and Japanese cars. Also the large glass areas increased the car's weight. With 22 miles per gallon the Pacer was unattractive for customers in the 1979 energy crisis. AMCs partnership with Renault brought the Renault 5 named [...] "Le Car" [...] to the AMC dealers. The design of the Pacer <b>gave</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> touch to the restyling of the Renault 5 to meet wishes and requirements of the American Market.|$|E
