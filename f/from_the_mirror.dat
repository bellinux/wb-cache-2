5|$|Record {{charts in}} the United Kingdom began life on 14 November 1952 when NME imitated an idea started in American Billboard {{magazine}} and began compiling a hit parade. Prior to 15 February 1969, when the British Market Research Bureau chart was established, {{there had been}} no universally accepted chart. During this time the BBC used aggregated results of charts <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mirror</b> and other sources to compile the Pick of the Pops chart. However, according to The Official Charts Company and Guinness' British Hit Singles & Albums, the NME is considered the official British singles chart before 10 March 1960. After that date and until 1969 a chart compiled by Record Retailer is considered the official British singles chart.|$|E
5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{for the single}} was directed by Wataru Takeishi. It opens with Hamasaki watching her previous music videos on several television screens. Sitting in a small room, she exits it and finds {{a large amount of}} fans and paparazzi bombarding her; scenes interspersed through the main plot feature her looking towards a mirror. Following the first chorus, Hamasaki is shown riding through Tokyo city, including her appearance at a recording studio singing the song, and on top of a skyscraper at night. The frames subsequently re-appear throughout the visual, with it ending with a blurry shot of Hamasaki looking away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror,</b> and the TV screens from the first shot displaying the logo of Avex Trax. The music video was included on several DVD compilations released by Hamasaki: A Clips (2000), A Complete Box Set (2004), the digital release of A Clips Complete (2014), and the DVD and Blu-Ray re-release edition of her 2001 compilation album A Best (2016). It was additionally used as the theme for Japanese television show Semi Double (1999).|$|E
25|$|For {{scientific}} optical work, dielectric mirrors {{are often}} used. These are glass (or sometimes other material) substrates on which {{one or more}} layers of dielectric material are deposited, to form an optical coating. By careful choice of the type and thickness of the dielectric layers, the range of wavelengths and amount of light reflected <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> can be specified. The best mirrors of this type can reflect >99.999% of the light (in a narrow range of wavelengths) which is incident on the mirror. Such mirrors are often used in lasers.|$|E

Roget and his allies journey to the Mirage Castle to confront Anise, only for her to finish pulling <b>the</b> dark energy <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirrors</b> before they can stop her. The dark energy kills Inath and the Mirage Bishop, and Anise {{combines}} her form with a possessed Peddan general to create the Goddess of Doom.

Pegasus also aids the Sailor Soldiers by upgrading them to permanent Super forms and lending his power when summoned by Chibiusa. The new powers are used to combat the Dead Moon Circus, a mysterious circus troupe that targets humans with beautiful dreams. By looking into their Dream Mirrors, they hope to find the dream in which Pegasus is hiding, believing Pegasus possesses the Golden Crystal. With this crystal, the Dead Moon Circus's ruler — Queen Nehelenia — can be freed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> she was sealed in.|$|E
25|$|After Houdini's death, {{his friend}} Martin Beck {{was quoted in}} Will Goldston's book, Sensational Tales of Mystery Men, as admitting that Houdini was bested that day and had appealed to his wife, Bess, for help. Goldston goes on to claim that Bess begged the key <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mirror</b> representative, then slipped it to Houdini in a glass of water. It was stated in the book The Secret Life of Houdini that the key {{required}} to open the specially designed Mirror handcuffs was 6 inches long, and {{could not have been}} smuggled to Houdini in a glass of water. Goldston offered no proof of his account, and many modern biographers have found evidence (notably in the custom design of the handcuffs) that the Mirror challenge may have been arranged by Houdini and that his long struggle to escape was pure showmanship.|$|E
25|$|Scallops have a {{large number}} (10–100) of small (about 1mm) eyes {{arranged}} {{along the edge of}} their mantle. These eyes represent a particular innovation among molluscs, relying on a concave, parabolic mirror of guanine crystals to focus and retro-reflect light instead of a lens as found in many other eye types. Additionally, their eyes possess a double-layered retina, the outer retina responding most strongly to light and the inner to abrupt darkness. While these eyes are unable to resolve shapes with high fidelity, the combined sensitivity of both retinas to light entering the eye and light retro-reflected <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> grants scallops exceptional contrast definition as well as the ability to detect changing patterns of light and motion. Scallops primarily rely on their eyes as an 'early-warning' threat detection system, scanning around them for movement and shadows which could potentially indicate predators. Additionally, some scallops alter their swimming or feeding behavior based on the turbidity or clarity of the water, by detecting the movement of particulate matter in the water column.|$|E

500|$|Gavin Martin <b>from</b> <b>The</b> <b>Mirror</b> gave a mixed response, as he said: [...] "Nothing dates {{as quickly}} as pop that dares to call itself futuristic". Martin awarded the song 3/5 and {{concluded}} with [...] "It's not that this new number from the forthcoming Greatest Hits set is bad – but it's {{a whole lot more}} routine than it pretends to be." [...] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine commented on the possibly outdated dance theme. Responding to the new additions of the record including [...] "Keeps Gettin' Better", he noted: [...] "Not exactly what one would call original, but if it's true the singer's next studio album will reprise this electro-pop sound, Aguilera deserves credit for refusing to play it safe." [...] Bill Lamb from About.com awarded the track three stars. He noted Aguilera's dance-inspired effort, at a time of dance dominance in the industry, negatively and stated that [...] "the catchy electro-pop vibe isn't enough to make it one of her more memorable efforts." [...] Rolling Stone noted that in the compilation, Aguilera's old singles are [...] "weighed down by four bland attempts at 2008's trendy, Lady Gaga-jacking electropop". Paul Thompson and Amy Phillips from Pitchfork Media said that the track was [...] "basically a ripoff" [...] of Goldfrapp's [...] "Ooh La La".|$|E

500|$|The Guardians [...] "Organ Grinder" [...] {{reviewer}} {{was full}} of praise for Myles' performance in [...] "Everything Changes", expressing the opinion that, through her portrayal of Gwen Cooper, she managed to outshine Captain Jack. The character was described by The Stage as [...] "the solid, down to earth character needed to anchor Torchwood to the real world" [...] whilst functioning well as a foil to Captain Jack. Some reviews mocked the prosaic characterisation. Verity Stob, a technology columnist for online newspaper The Register, wrote a parody of Torchwood called Under Torch Wood (in the style of Dylan Thomas' Under Milk Wood). The piece mocks Gwen's role as [...] "the viewer proxy" [...] describing her as [...] "plumply pop-eyed" [...] and her boyfriend Rhys as 'Barry Backstory'. Jan Ravens played a parody version of Gwen in the impressionist television series Dead Ringers, in which she displays a badge labelling her with what Jon Culshaw's Captain Jack describes as her sole characteristic: Welsh. In November 2006 Jim Shelley <b>from</b> <b>The</b> <b>Mirror</b> stated Gwen to be [...] "neither as interesting nor as sexy as she should be." [...] A plot development that saw Gwen respond to the advances of an alien sex-gas in another woman's body was described by Karman Kregloe of AfterEllen as characterising [...] "nearly every negative lesbian stereotype imaginable". Kregloe considers Gwen's inability to satiate the alien as a [...] "play on a traditional, sexist social construct", {{and the fact that}} Gwen never again mentions this experience is also criticised.|$|E

2500|$|Evans succeeds and the {{timeline}} is altered beyond measure. The galaxy {{is governed by}} the Galactic Order, a militaristic state similar to the Terran Empire <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> universe, but also including Klingons, Romulans, and Orions in their ranks. It is ruled over by a mysterious being known only as [...] "Curate Prime", and uses ships from {{the era of the}} original series, but with state-of-the-art weaponry. Harriman is a brutal mass murderer in this timeline, commanding the G.S.S. Conqueror (GOC-1701), this timeline's analog to the Enterprise. The Conqueror pursues a rebel vessel and disables it, capturing the crew – revealed to be Chekov (under the nom de guerre [...] "Kittrick") and his shape-shifting companion Ragnar (Gary Graham), who lead a movement of freedom fighters against the Galactic Order. Harriman orders them taken to the brig, and sets a course for Vulcan, which has declared neutrality. On Vulcan, Uhura is married to Stonn (Lawrence Montaigne) and has several children; upon learning of the Conquerors arrival, the Vulcans begin to evacuate the planet. Harriman summons Kittrick to the bridge to witness Vulcan's impending destruction for not supporting the Order, and unleashes an [...] "Omega device" [...] that destroys the entire planet.|$|E
2500|$|Voldemort, as {{punishment}} for Quirrell's failure to secure the Stone from Gringotts, decided to keep a closer watch on his new servant. [...] He took possession of Quirrell's body, which caused his face {{to appear on the}} back of Quirrell's head. [...] To conceal this, Quirrell took to wearing the turban. [...] In order to keep Voldemort alive, Quirrell had to kill unicorns in the Forbidden Forest, drinking their blood to provide temporary life-sustaining powers for Voldemort. Quirrell then reveals that {{he was the one who}} let in the troll and attempted to throw Harry off his broom while Snape muttered a counter curse. During the climax of the story, as Harry and Quirrell try to recover the Stone <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mirror</b> of Erised, Voldemort reveals himself on the back of Quirrell's head, formerly concealed by the turban, and speaks directly to Harry, threatening to kill him if he does not assist Voldemort in recovering it. After Harry refuses, Quirrell tries to take the Stone by force. Voldemort orders Quirrell to attack Harry, who holds off Quirrell long enough for aid in the form of Dumbledore to arrive, at which point Voldemort flees, in his non-physical form. Voldemort's departure, as well as the agony suffered by him because of his contact with Harry, who continues to be protected by the love of his mother and the spell that was cast by her sacrificing her life to save Harry, causes Quirrell to die, hence Dumbledore's comment that Voldemort is as merciless to his followers as to his enemies.|$|E
