5|$|A <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{people who}} {{spent time in}} Kowloon Walled City have written {{accounts}} of their experiences. Evangelist Jackie Pullinger wrote a 1989 memoir, Crack in the Wall, about her involvement in treating drug addicts within the Walled City. In his 2004 autobiography Gweilo, Martin Booth describes his exploration of the Walled City {{as a child in}} the 1950s.|$|E

5|$|Angam Day, held on 26 October, {{celebrates the}} {{recovery}} of the Nauruan population after the two World Wars and the 1920 influenza epidemic. The displacement of the indigenous culture by colonial and contemporary Western influences is significant. <b>Few</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old customs have been preserved, but some forms of traditional music, arts and crafts, and fishing are still practised.|$|E

50|$|Chenopodium nuttalliae, huauzontle, is a Mexican {{vegetable}} {{related to}} the common American weeds goosefoot and lambsquarters. It resembles broccoli, although the stems are much thinner, and support <b>fewer</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leaves.|$|R
5|$|In early {{versions}} of Perl, database interfaces {{were created by}} relinking the interpreter with a client-side database library. This was sufficiently difficult that it was done for only a <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most-important and most widely used databases, and it restricted the resulting perl executable to using just one database interface at a time.|$|E
5|$|In many instances, only a <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{categories}} will {{be applicable}} to {{the facts of the}} case before the TTAB.|$|E
5|$|Most of the mashhads were {{straightforward}} square structures with a dome, but a <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mausoleums at Aswan {{were more}} complex and included side rooms.|$|E
2500|$|Some modern {{devices have}} [...] "rail-to-rail output" [...] capability, {{meaning that the}} output can range from within a <b>few</b> millivolts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{positive}} supply voltage to within a <b>few</b> millivolts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> negative supply voltage.|$|R
5000|$|We may {{discard the}} lines which contain two or <b>fewer</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> points, {{as they can}} {{contribute}} at most [...] incidences to the total number. Thus we may assume that every line contains at least three <b>of</b> <b>the</b> points.|$|R
5000|$|Different balance: Different {{chemical}} compounds in ground coffee dissolve into hot water at different rates. A ristretto contains a greater relative proportion of faster extracting compounds, proportionally <b>fewer</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> compounds characteristic <b>of</b> over-extraction, and thus, a different balance.|$|R
5|$|Only a <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other {{buildings}} have names. Building 200 is officially the Lane History Corner, named for Bill and Jean Lane in 1998.|$|E
5|$|Several {{descendants}} of Pal played the fictional Lassie character following their progenitor's death. On the original television series (1954–73), Pal's son, Lassie Junior, and his grandsons, Spook and Baby, worked {{the first several}} seasons. Mire appeared in a <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ranger seasons, and Hey Hey worked the final two syndicated seasons.|$|E
5|$|The Lime Walk, {{constructed}} by previous estate owner Margaret Chinnery, surrounds the Training Ground {{which was the}} original main lawn area of the White House. <b>Few</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lime trees survive to this day.

50|$|With {{a career}} that spanned over sixty years, Ortiz Monasterio is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main figures <b>of</b> Mexican {{sculpture}} in the 20th century. He is one <b>of</b> <b>few</b> to be active during <b>the</b> dominance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mexican muralism movement and one <b>of</b> <b>fewer</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> century to be remembered.|$|R
50|$|Nevertheless, Kosovo, as {{many other}} {{countries}} in the Balkans, was Christian during the pre-Ottoman period. Thus, claims may be raised about Kosovo as <b>the</b> cradle <b>of</b> Christianity, namely orthodox civilization, because <b>of</b> <b>few</b> monuments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 14th century and <b>few</b> others <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 15th century in the country.|$|R

5|$|The comic book's {{popularity}} with women {{has also been}} attributed to the strong female characters featured in the comic, such as Scarlett and Lady Jaye. Since very <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> G.I. Joe action figures were female, Hama tended to frequently use all of the female characters, including those that were created as recurring characters in the comics.|$|E
5|$|The film's dubbing {{activities}} {{began on}} 15 December 2011 at Shabdalaya Studios in Hyderabad. The DTS mixing works were in progress in early January 2012.

5|$|The {{impact of}} Graffham was minimal. The Swedish {{government}} agreed to <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concessions requested during the meetings, and few high-level officials {{were convinced that}} the Allies would invade Norway. Overall, the influence of Graffham and Fortitude North on German strategy in Scandinavia is disputed.|$|E
5000|$|Rice {{naturally}} has minerals like phosphorus, magnesium, and potassium. Instant rice has <b>fewer</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> calories, carbohydrates, {{and protein}} than regular rice. Companies {{make up for}} <b>the</b> loss <b>of</b> nutrients by adding their own nutrients such as the B-vitamins, as well as iron.|$|R
60|$|Labour is of {{a higher}} or lower order, as it {{includes}} more or <b>fewer</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elements <b>of</b> life: and labour of good quality, in any kind, includes always as much intellect and feeling as will fully and harmoniously regulate the physical force.|$|R
50|$|There is {{correlational}} {{evidence for}} this theory in a butterfly, Pieris napi. Females that were receptive to a second mating had <b>fewer</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> non-fertile sperm type in storage than did non-receptive females. Thus, the infertile sperm {{may be responsible for}} delaying female remating.|$|R
5|$|The {{promethium}} sample produced {{was used}} to measure a <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> metal's properties, such as its melting point.|$|E
5|$|The show {{features}} all of {{the songs}} from the album American Idiot, some b-sides and a <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> songs from Green Day's 21st Century Breakdown. The show also features an onstage band.|$|E
5|$|There {{are some}} controversies {{about some of}} the exact details of a <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> uniforms, since some of the records were lost or {{destroyed}} after the Civil War ended.|$|E
25|$|The study's {{patients}} {{also showed}} {{significant improvement in}} the disease's symptoms; a later double-blind, randomized controlled trial also found ondansetron to significantly improve schizophrenia symptoms when used {{as an adjunct to}} haloperidol, and people taking both drugs experienced <b>fewer</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> adverse effects commonly associated with haloperidol.|$|R
50|$|In 2017, {{the party}} contested two Assembly {{constituencies}} of Khurai and Khangabok. Khangabok is <b>the</b> home constituency <b>of</b> Chief Minister Okram Ibobi Singh. In the 2017 elections, {{the winner in}} Thoubal, Ibobi Singh, received 18,649 and Sharmilla received 90 votes, <b>the</b> <b>fewest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> five candidates.|$|R

J. Novak), a temporary worker.|$|E
5|$|A Great Eruption event {{similar to}} Eta Carinae A's {{has only been}} {{observed}} in one other star in the Milky Way—P Cygni—and {{in a handful of}} other possible LBVs in external galaxies. None of them seem to be quite as violent as Eta Carinae's. It is unclear if this is something that only a very <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most massive LBVs undergo, something that is caused by a close companion star, or a very brief but common phase for massive stars. Some similar events in external galaxies have been mistaken for supernovae and have been called supernova impostors, although this grouping may also include other types of non-terminal transients that approach the brightness of a supernova.|$|E
