The model is validated using the reported simulation/experimental data to the extent possible. The present study reports separation of Hydrogen from five-component mixture using a six-bed process. The dynamics of the process were studied and are presented incorporating non-isothermal effects. The model is easily adaptable to different adsorption/desorption kinetics and thermodynamics due to its effective decoupling of bed hydrodynamics from adsorption/desorption.

40|$|International audienceAbstractA method {{based on}} anion {{exchange}} chromatography (AIEX) {{in combination with}} ultrafiltration (UF) was developed to obtain kilogram-scale amounts of bovine α-lactalbumin (α-La) of high purity from α-La-enriched whey protein concentrate (αWPC). Initially, α-La was successfully purified, at laboratory scale, from a 10 % solution of αWPC. Removal of casein and denatured whey protein by acid precipitation resulted in a α-La purity of 78 %. A further purification by AIEX eluting with sodium acetate (NaAc) buffer led to a final purity and recovery of 100 and 85 %, respectively. Based on this, the process was simplified and optimized for pilot-scale purification by selective binding of β-lactoglobulin (β-Lg). Batchwise expanded bed AIEX using a column with 5  L of Q Sepharose matrix was performed. Pure α-La was obtained in the run through buffer. In the end, 1100  g of holo form α-La was obtained with a purity of 97. 4 % in protein and a recovery of 80 %, calculated based on the protein detectable in reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). Thus, by combining AIEX and UF, heating was avoided allowing production of α-La in kilo-scale with <b>high</b> <b>purity</b> <b>and</b> <b>recovery</b> from αWPC with a minimum volume of buffer solutions...|$|E

We examined the viscera of an Australian sea cucumber Holothuria lessoni Massin et al. 2009, for novel bioactive compounds, with an emphasis on the triterpene glycosides, saponins. The viscera were extracted with 70 % ethanol, and this extract was purified by a liquid-liquid partition process and column chromatography, followed by isobutanol extraction. The isobutanol saponin-enriched mixture was further purified by high performance centrifugal partition chromatography (HPCPC) with <b>high</b> <b>purity</b> <b>and</b> <b>recovery.</b> The resultant purified polar samples were analyzed using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) /MS and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) /MS to identify saponins and characterize their molecular structures.

Initially the volumetric productivity of Gly fermentation with Klebsiella pneumoniae bacterium was optimized for one and two continuous stages, where was necessary to study the multiplicity of stable steady states for the fermentation system selecting the conditions where higher concentrations of PD are found; and under optimal operation conditions the outlet PD concentration and the global yield are 0. 4833 mol/l and 0. 5481 molPD/molGly, respectively. For PD recovery from fermentation broth a noconventional separation scheme was proposed, which consists first in a reactiveextraction with iso-butyraldehyde (iBAld) for produce 2 -iso-propyl- 1, 3 -dioxane (iPDOx) and water. The iPDOx is removed toward the organic phase by the aldehyde that acts simultaneously as reagent and solvent. The yield of reactive-extraction process is 85 %.

Our group "Policentric Study Group on Immunological Markers", is composed of 40 laboratories. Its aim, over recent years, has been to find a standardized way of immunophenotypic analysis applicable to various hematological diseases. The objective {{of this study is}} to contribute to the debate concerning standardization of monoclonal antibody panels and immunophenotypic analysis procedures in acute leukemia (AL) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), with the following targets: to improve interlaboratory reproducibility of the immunophenotyping data, and interpretative results; to study, with improved feasibility, correlation between immunophenotype and clinical or biological findings on a large number of AL and MDS cases; to verify the utility of the proposed monoclonal antibody panels for proper AL and MDS classification, and to detect minimal residual disease. In the field of AL and MDS our experience is based on about 1800 and 700 cases respectively analyzed over the last five years. Starting from these experiences and data of the literature we have elaborated the proposed panels of monoclonal antibodies and the methods of analysis.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{separation}} of an ethyl acetate–isooctane mixture by heterogeneous azeotropic distillation in a batch rectifying column. An initial list of 60 candidates was studied but only methanol and acetonitrile were obtained as potential heterogeneous entrainers. These entrainers form a low boiling heterogeneous azeotrope with isooctane. Experimental verification of the miscibility gap with isooctane was performed at 25 °C for each entrainer giving a smaller region for methanol than for acetonitrile. Feasibility of the heterogeneous azeotropic batch distillation was carried out experimentally in a laboratory batch distillation column having 44 theoretical equilibrium stages and using a high reflux ratio. Several distillate fractions were taken {{as a function of}} the temperature at the top of the column. For both methanol and acetonitrile, the main fraction was defined by the condensed vapor providing a liquid–liquid split of the isooctane/entrainer heteroazeotrope into the decanter. Ethyl acetate impurity was detected in both decanted phases, but in much lower amount when using acetonitrile as entrainer. The process with acetonitrile also resulted in a shorter operating time <b>and</b> <b>higher</b> <b>purity</b> <b>and</b> <b>recovery</b> yield of isooctane as the main distillate product.

AimsTo describe the development, upscaling and process validation for industrial-scale human-cl rhFVIII purification. Methods and resultsThe purification process involves one centrifugation, two filtration, five chromatography columns and two dedicated pathogen clearance steps (solvent/detergent treatment and 20 nm nanofiltration). The key purification step uses an affinity resin (VIIISelect) with high specificity for FVIII, removing essentially all host-cell proteins with > 80 % product recovery. The production-scale multi-step purification process efficiently removes process- and product-related impurities and results in a high-purity rhFVIII product, with an overall yield of ∼ 50 %. Specific activity of the final product was > 9000 IU/mg, and the ratio between active FVIII and total FVIII protein present was > 0. 9. The entire production process is free of animal-derived products. Leaching of potential harmful compounds from chromatography resins and all pathogens tested were below the limit of quantification in the final product. ConclusionsHuman-cl rhFVIII can be produced at 500 L bioreactor scale, maintaining <b>high</b> <b>purity</b> <b>and</b> <b>recoveries.</b> The innovative purification process ensures a high-purity and high-quality human-cl rhFVIII product with a high pathogen safety margin...|$|R

In this study, introduction of heat treatment procedure in serine protease purification was investigated. In addition, the effects of different molecular weights of polyethylene glycol (PEG 4000, 6000 and 8000) at concentrations of 8, 16 and 21 % (w/w) as well as salts (Na-citrate, MgSO 4 and K 2 HPO 4) at concentrations of 12, 15, 18 % (w/w) on serine protease partition behavior were studied. Optimum conditions for serine protease purification were achieved in the PEG-rich phase with composition of 16 % PEG 6000 - 15 % MgSO 4.

40|$|In this study, a two-zone SMB with {{a storage}} tank is {{developed}} using detailed simulations with Aspen Chromatography. Due to dual zone functions and mixing {{in the tank}} in a two-zone SMB, it gives slightly lower purities than a four-zone SMB with same productivity and desorbent-to-feed ratio (D/F) for both linear and nonlinear isotherms. For dextran T 6 /raffinose separation (linear isotherms), the average purities are 96. 3 % and 96. 4 % for two and four-zone SMBs, respectively. However, two-zone SMBs are less complex than four-zone SMBs. ^ Scaling rules for four-zone SMBs are extended to two-zone SMBs, and used in pressure utilization procedures by adding pumps between columns to increase productivity. Two-zone SMBs can achieve higher increases in productivity due to lower initial pressure drop than four-zone SMBs. For example, for one column per zone systems for binaphthol enantiomer separation, the productivity of a parallel two-zone SMB with four pumps is 35 % higher than the corresponding four-zone SMB with constant purities and D/F. ^ A parallel two-zone and four-zone SMB hybrid process is developed for p-xylene purification to utilize the advantages of four-zone (<b>high</b> <b>purity</b> <b>and</b> <b>recovery)</b> and parallel two-zone (high productivity) SMBs. With overall recovery of the hybrid process matching the stand-alone four-zone SMB, the feed rate was doubled and the overall productivity was 50 % higher than the four-zone SMB. ^ Thermal operation using heat exchangers to produce and control traveling thermal waves by heating or cooling the fluid before it enters a column can improve the performance of two and four-zone SMBs. For one column per zone systems with four heat exchangers for toluene/p-xylene separation (linear isotherms), the average purity increased from 84. 8 % to 99. 2 % and from 80. 9 % to 98. 9 % for four and two-zone SMBs, respectively. For one column per zone systems without heat exchangers, the average purities increased from 84. 8 % to 93. 2 % and from 80. 9 % to 90. 1 % for four and two-zone SMBs, respectively. For nonlinear isotherms for p-xylene purification in four-zone SMBs, thermal effects are complicated and the separation can be improved to satisfy industrial standard using fewer columns/sections than an industrial unit, with p-xylene purity of 99. 9 % and recovery of 98. 6 %. ...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) is a {{glycoprotein}} {{that has}} {{been approved by the}} FDA for the treatment of neutropenia and leukemia in combination with chemotherapies. Recombinant hGM-CSF is produced industrially using the baker's yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, by large-scale fermentation. The methylotrophic yeast, Pichia pastoris, has emerged as an alternative host cell system due to its shorter and less immunogenic glycosylation pattern together with higher cell density growth and higher secreted protein yield than S. cerevisiae. In this study, we compared the pipeline from gene to recombinant protein in these two yeasts. RESULTS: Codon optimization in silico for both yeast species showed no difference in frequent codon usage. However, rhGM-CSF expressed from S. cerevisiae BY 4742 showed a significant discrepancy in molecular weight from those of P. pastoris X 33. Analysis showed purified rhGM-CSF species with molecular weights ranging from 30 to more than 60 kDa. Fed-batch fermentation over 72 h showed that rhGM-CSF was more highly secreted from P. pastoris than S. cerevisiae (285 and 64 mg total secreted protein/L, respectively). Ion exchange chromatography gave <b>higher</b> <b>purity</b> <b>and</b> <b>recovery</b> than hydrophobic interaction chromatography. Purified rhGM-CSF from P. pastoris was 327 times more potent than rhGM-CSF from S. cerevisiae in terms of proliferative stimulating capacity on the hGM-CSF-dependent cell line, TF- 1. CONCLUSION: Our data support a view that the methylotrophic yeast P. pastoris is an effective recombinant host for heterologous rhGM-CSF production...|$|R

The subjects were one hundred and thirty-one neonates (59 healthy, 44 septicaemic, 20 with RDS and eight with perinatal asphyxia) and 20 healthy adults. Monocyte HLA-DR expression was measured using one-colour HLA-DR labelling in a gate for monocytes obtained using the combination of CD 3 -CD 19 –PE/CD 15 –FITC MoAbs. In addition, the common dual staining method using MoAbs against two CD 14 epitopes (TUK 4, MO 2) was evaluated. With the one-colour HLA-DR labelling <b>higher</b> <b>purity</b> <b>and</b> <b>recovery</b> values of monocytes were achieved than with the dual labelling method. Healthy neonates had significantly lower percentages of HLA-DR+ monocytes than adults (69 ± 13 % versus 91 · 5 ± 2 · 5 %) and comparable mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) (119 ± 25 versus 131 ± 26). Values did not differ significantly between healthy term and preterm neonates. Preterm neonates with RDS had a significantly lower percentage of HLA-DR+ monocytes than the healthy preterm neonates. In neonates with asphyxia both parameters were comparable to those of the healthy ones. Septicaemic neonates presented significantly lower values of both parameters than the healthy, RDS and asphyxiated neonates. Monocyte negative selection provides a reliable estimation of HLA-DR expression on monocytes. Expression of monocyte HLA-DR is lower in healthy neonates in comparison with adults and is further decreased in neonates with sepsis and RDS, but it is not influenced by prematurity and perinatal asphyxia...|$|R

Establishing a suitable source for extraction of phytochemicals is, however, not always straightforward. In many instances the production by chemical synthesis is not economically viable due to their complex structures and conservation issues may arise when they are harvested from natural sources. In vitro culture techniques offer an attractive alternative to these issues. Natural grown plants can be replaced by in vitro produced biomass with the advantage that several strategies can be implemented to increase production yields, such as genotype selection, altering growth conditions and use of elicitors, so that the higher investment costs are justified. Also, because plant tissue cultures can be generated on a continuous year-round basis without seasonal constraints, they can guarantee reliable and predictable production levels, which is of great importance for efficient process down-stream. Plant tissue culture techniques offer the possibility of establishing cultures from leaves, stems, roots and meristems, meaning that metabolites produced in specific plant organs can also be prospected. The successful production {{of a large number}} of phytochemicals from micropropagated biomass has been reported, and it seems that only in a few cases cultures fail to accumulate compounds of interest.

The estimated parameters were validated by comparing the SMB experimental data with theoretical predictions. After the validation, the parameters were used to explore various design alternatives. This approach significantly reduced the number of trial-and-error experiments in SMB process design and development. The design with the consideration of mass-transfer effects gave <b>higher</b> product <b>purity</b> <b>and</b> <b>recovery.</b> ^ A systematic optimization strategy was then applied to another linear SMB system for the separation of paclitaxel and cephalomannine. Four design parameters—desorbent composition, column configuration, column length to diameter ratio, and adsorbent particle size—have been analyzed to maximize throughput and minimize desorbent consumption. The effects of flow rate and pressure drop limitations were also considered in this analysis. The comparison between batch elution and SMB chromatography showed that SMB can achieve higher production rate and higher yield with less solvent usage. ^ By using the model-based design method and the systematic optimization strategy, a SMB process for the separation of paclitaxel from four major impurities was developed. Two SMB steps were adopted in this process. Experimental data were in close agreement with the theoretical predictions from VERSE-LC. ^ Finally, VERSE-LC was extended for the dynamic studies of nonlinear SMB systems.

In this work, biogas upgrading with pressure swing adsorption is studied with dynamic process simulation method using the modified Skarstrom cycle, which gives the variation of the pressure and stream concentration with cycle time in the column, while the variation of these variables with cycle time are difficult to be observed by experiments. Thus the simulation results would supply more dynamic information of the process. The pressure swing adsorption performance of the novel adsorbent metal-organic framework 508 b is simulated and compared with the processes using traditional adsorbents such as zeolite 13 X and carbon molecular sieve 3 K. A two-column six-step pressure swing adsorption simulation model involving parametric sensitivity analysis is established. The Langmuir adsorption isotherm models of the three adsorbents are built by fitting experiment data. The energy consumption of the pressure swing adsorption process with different adsorbents is calculated by fixing a 98 % <b>purity</b> <b>and</b> 85 % <b>recovery</b> ratio of methane product after investigating the key parameters, i. e., adsorption pressure, desorption pressure and purge to feed ratio. Simulation results reveal that the order of the energy consumption in the process is zeolite 13 X > carbon molecular sieve 3 K> metal-organic framework 508 b. For metal-organic framework 508 b has linear carbon dioxide isotherm compared with zeolite 13 X, which makes the desorption of the carbon dioxide easier, and its adsorption capacity is higher than with carbon molecular sieve 3 K under the same partial pressure. In conclusion, the energy consumption of pressure swing adsorption process using metal-organic framework 508 b adsorbent is 56 % lower than that using zeolite 13 X, and the column packed with metal-organic framework 508 b is estimated to be 13 % smaller in diameter than that with zeolite 13 X.

Chemical extraction was shown to {{be as effective as}} homogenization at releasing the inclusion body proteins from the bacteria] cells, with complete release taking less than 20 min. An expanded bed adsorption (EBA) column utilizing immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) was then used to purify the denatured KSI-(His(6)) protein directly from the chemical extract. This integrated process greatly simplifies the <b>recovery</b> <b>and</b> purification of inclusion body proteins by removing the need for mechanical cell disruption, repeated inclusion body centrifugation, and difficult clarification operations. The integrated chemical extraction and EBA process achieved a very <b>high</b> <b>purity</b> (99 %) <b>and</b> <b>recovery</b> (89 %) of the KSI-(His(6)), with efficient utilization of the adsorbent matrix (9. 74 mg KSI-(His(6)) /mL adsorbent). Following purification the protein was refolded by dilution to obtain the biologically active protein. Seventy-nine percent of the expressed KSI-(His(6)) protein was recovered as enzymatically active protein with the described extraction, purification, and refolding process. In addition to demonstrating the operation of this intensified inclusion body process, a plate-based concentration assay detecting KSI-(His(6)) is validated. The intensified process in this work requires minimal optimization for recovering novel his-tagged proteins, and further improves the economic advantage of E. coli as a host organism.

40|$|In this article, a {{comparison}} {{will be made}} concerning {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of five kinds of coal mine methane (CMM) deoxygenation method, including pressure swing adsorption, combustion, membrane separation, non-metallic reduction, and cryogenic distillation. Pressure swing adsorption has a wide range of application and strong production capacity. To achieve this goal, adsorbent must have high selectivity, adsorption capacity, and adequate adsorption/desorption kinetics, remain stable after several adsorption/desorption cycles, and possess good thermal and mechanical stabilities. Catalytic combustion deoxygenation is a high-temperature exothermic redox chemical reaction, which releases large amounts of thermal energy. So, the stable and accurate control of the temperature is not easy. Meanwhile partial methane is lost. The key of catalytic combustion deoxygenation lies in the development of high-efficiency catalyst. Membrane separation has advantages of high separation efficiency and low energy consumption. However, there are many obstacles, including higher costs. Membrane materials have the requirements of both high permeability and high selectivity. The development of new membrane materials is a key for membrane separation. Cryogenic distillation has many excellence advantages, such as <b>high</b> <b>purity</b> production <b>and</b> <b>high</b> <b>recovery.</b> However, the energy consumption increases with decreasing CH 4 concentrations in feed gas. Moreover, there are many types of operational security problems. And that several kinds of deoxygenation techniques mentioned above have an economic value just for oxygen-bearing CMM with methane content above 30 %. Moreover, all the above methods are not applicable to deoxygenation of low concentration CMM. Non-metallic reduction method cannot only realize cyclic utilization of deoxidizer but also have no impurity gases generation. It also has a relatively low cost and low loss rate of methane, and the oxygen is removed thoroughly. In particular, the non-metallic reduction method has good development prospects for low concentration oxygen-bearing CMM. This article also points out the direction of future development of coal mine methane deoxygenation...|$|R
40|$|Many plasma {{membrane}} proteins {{are linked to}} diseases and are often targets of therapeutic drugs. However, analysis of {{plasma membrane}} proteins from cancer tissues or cells is far from satisfaction due to their water-insoluble and low abundant natures. The enrichment of plasma membrane proteins is always contaminated by other intracellular organelles. To perform a sensitive and specific analysis of plasma membrane proteome, {{it is important to}} develop a better method to improve the extraction efficiency for plasma membrane proteins. We aim to develop an efficient purification strategy to increase the plasma membrane protein identification coverage by mass spectrometry. We expect that this strategy can help us to probe the under-represented membrane proteome. We used our two-step centrifugation method in combination with the conventional ultracentrifugation method to improve the purity of plasma membrane proteins. Using HeLa cells as experiment model, under the same protein identification threshold the purification efficiency between the two-step method and the combined method was compared. 1077 and 1002 proteins were identified in two-step method and combined method, of which 550 (51. 1 %) and 601 (60 %) proteins were annotated as membrane proteins, 353 (32. 8 %) and 359 (35. 8 %) were annotated as plasma membrane proteins by Gene Ontology database. The combined method showed better <b>purity</b> <b>and</b> <b>higher</b> identified number of plasma membrane proteins than two-step method. To application on mouse liver tissues, 1398 and 1214 proteins were identified in two-step method and combined method, of which 813 (58. 1 %) and 723 (59. 6 %) proteins were annotated as membrane proteins, 343 (24. 5 %) and 304 (25 %) were annotated as plasma membrane proteins. The purification efficiency of combined method apply on cell lines was better than tissue samples. For the reproducibility of combined method, there were 1157, 1269 and 1217 proteins identified in three replicates in mouse liver tissues. Among them, 274 (23. 7 %), 330 (26 %) and 310 (25. 5 %) proteins were annotated as plasma membrane proteins, which more than 70 % (227) plasma membrane proteins were appeared in all of three replicates. The low recovery (10 %) often limits the application of ultracentrifugation method on trace amount of starting materials. The combined method can improve the <b>recovery</b> <b>and</b> the <b>purity</b> of identified plasma membrane proteins, indicating that this combined method may have better efficiency for extraction of plasma membrane proteins. To further improve the yield of the plasma membrane proteins by centrifugation, we modified the volume of 20 % to 25 % sucrose gradients used in ultracentrifugation. Three different types of gradient preparation, including original, expanded, and condensed sucrose gradient, were tested. A total of 91 plasma membrane proteins were identified using condensed gradient, which is higher than using expanded gradient (53 plasma membrane proteins) and original gradient (61 plasma membrane proteins). The condensed gradient had smaller volume (2 ml) of 20 % ~ 25 % sucrose solutions for ultracentrifugation and thus improved the recovery of plasma membrane proteins. For other organelle proteins, mitochondria membrane protein-rich region were concentrated in 25 % ~ 40 % sucrose solutions The ER membrane protein-rich region is in 25 % ~ 30 % sucrose solutions. The nucleus protein-rich region is in 40 % solution. The 20 % sucrose solution has the <b>highest</b> <b>purity</b> (42. 1 %) of plasma membrane proteins and lowest contamination from other organelle membrane proteins. 許多細胞膜蛋白扮演著與疾病相互關聯的角色，常成為藥物治療的標的蛋白，然而分析癌症組織或細胞中細胞膜蛋白質仍極富挑戰，例如細胞膜蛋白質具高疏水特性，在細胞膜蛋白質純化的過程中也容易夾雜細胞胞器膜而造成干擾。為了針對細胞膜蛋白進行靈敏且高專一性的分析，我們需要發展一個更有效率的萃取策略，以提升質譜分析所鑑定到的細胞膜蛋白數量，我們也希望這個萃取策略可以鑑定出尚未被發現的細胞膜蛋白。 我們將目前常用的兩步驟離心法 (two-step centrifugation) 結合傳統的超高速離心法來提升所萃取的細胞膜蛋白純度，我們比較了兩步驟離心法和結合離心法 (combined method) 的純化效率。利用子宮頸癌細胞 (HeLa cells) 為測試模式，在參數條件相同的分析中，兩步驟離心法與結合離心法在結果中依序鑑定到平均各 1077 與 1002 個蛋白質，其中以Gene Ontology資料庫分類後呈現出所鑑定到的總體膜蛋白數量 550 (51. 1 %) 與 601 (60 %) 個，細胞膜蛋白數量為 353 (32. 8 %) 、 359 (35. 8 %) 個。結果中結合離心法所分離出的細胞膜蛋白純度與鑑定到的細胞膜蛋白數量皆較兩步驟離心法高。若應用於老鼠肝臟組織上，兩步驟離心法與結合離心法依序可鑑定到 1398 與 1214 個蛋白質，分類後總體膜蛋白數量為 813 (58. 1 %) 與 723 (59. 6 %) 個，細胞膜蛋白數量為 343 (24. 5 %) 與 304 (25 %) 個，相較於cell line，組織應用上使用結合離心法所提升的純化效率較有限。於結合離心法之重複性測試中，使用老鼠肝臟組織於三重複中可鑑定到 1157, 1269, 1217 個蛋白質， 274 (23. 7 %), 330 (26 %), 310 (25. 5 %) 個蛋白被分類為細胞膜蛋白質，其中大於七成 (227) 的細胞膜蛋白質於三重複中皆被鑑定到。 由於低回收率 (10 %) 是傳統超高速離心法不易進行微量樣品分析的限制，因此使用結合離心法可提升回收率以及鑑定到的細胞膜蛋白純度，顯現了結合離心法能更有效率的萃取細胞膜蛋白質以進行分析。為了將細胞膜蛋白進行有效濃縮，我們調整了超高速離心步驟中蔗糖梯度 20 %到 25 %溶液的體積，測試了三種不同的蔗糖梯度配置方式包含原始梯度、延展梯度和壓縮梯度。在壓縮梯度中一個梯度區段最高可鑑定到 91 個細胞膜蛋白，高於延展梯度所鑑定到的 53 個和原始梯度的 61 個細胞膜蛋白。使用壓縮梯度以僅兩毫升的 20 %至 25 %蔗糖溶液來進行超高速離心亦可提升細胞膜蛋白量的回收率。於其他胞器蛋白的分佈方面，粒線體膜蛋白傾向集中在 25 %至 40 %蔗糖溶液中，內質網膜蛋白則傾向位於 25 %至 30 %蔗糖溶液中，細胞核蛋白傾向位在 40 %蔗糖溶液中。超高速離心後 20 %蔗糖溶液內含有最高純度的細胞膜蛋白質 (42. 1 %) ，同時也避開了其他胞器膜蛋白的干擾。Acknowledgement [...] I Chinese Abstract [...] II Abstract [...] IV Table of Contents [...] VI List of Figures [...] IX List of Tables [...] .

40|$|Simulated {{moving bed}} {{chromatography}} process (SMBCP) is the technical realisation of a countercurrent adsorption process through the cyclic port switching. SMB technology reduces {{the cost of}} packing material with high loading capacity <b>and</b> provides <b>high</b> <b>purity</b> <b>and</b> <b>high</b> <b>recovery</b> {{in a very short}} time. Major commodity applications have been found in the petroleum, food, biotechnology, pharmaceutical and fine chemical industries. The industrial applications bring an emergent demand to improve the SMBCP operation for higher product quality, productivity, efficiency and robustness. However, for this particular process, we encounter several challenges. Firstly, the interplay of the effects of strong nonlinearities, competition of solutes, mass transfer resistance and fluid dynamic dispersion produces steep concentration fronts. Mathematical model accounted for this particular property constitutes a serious difficulty for the solution procedure. Secondly, a dynamic SMB model consists of a set of partial differential, ordinary differential and algebraic equations, which are highly coupled. The large size is a problem due to its intensive computation when on-line optimisation and real-time control are necessary. Thirdly, the SMB unit operation exhibits complex dynamics. Process metrics for design and operation can be determined only when a cyclic steady state is reached after a certain number of switching. Achieving this steady state by solving the PDE models cycle after cycle involves expensive calculation. Studies have been carried out to solve these problems through process analysis, investigation on spatial discretisation techniques, and development of an accelerated integration scheme. Through a systematic study on the advances of SMB modelling, design and control, a set of functionally equivalent models for SMBCP are identified and summarized for their practical applications. The limitations of the existing modelling techniques in industrial applications are also identified. Furthermore, structural analysis of the existing models is conducted for {{a better understanding of the}} functionality and suitability of each model. Suggestions are given on how to choose an appropriate model with sufficient accuracy while keeping the computational demand reasonably low for real time control. Effort is made on to the systematic investigation of different numerical methods for the solution of PDEs to circumvent the steep gradients encountered in chromatographic separation. Comprehensive studies are conducted on a single column chromatographic process represented by a transport-dispersive-equilibrium linear model. Numerical solutions from the upwind- 1 finite difference, wavelet-collocation, and high resolution methods are evaluated by quantitative comparisons with the analytical solution for a range of Peclet numbers. It reveals that for a PDE system with a low Peclet number, all existing numerical methods work well, but the upwind finite difference method consumes the most time for the same degree of accuracy of the numerical solution. The high resolution method provides an accurate numerical solution for a PDE system with a medium Peclet number. The wavelet collocation method is capable of catching up steep changes in the solution, and thus can be used for solving PDE models with high singularity. The advantages and disadvantages of the wavelet based approaches are further investigated through several case studies on real SMBCP system. A glucose-fructose separation process is firstly chosen with its relatively simple isotherm representations. Simulations are conducted using both wavelet collocation and upwind finite difference methods. For more complicated applications, an enantiomers separation process is selected. As the PDEs model exhibit a certain degree of singularity, wavelet collocation and high resolution methods are adopted for spatial discretisation. It is revealed that both the wavelet based approaches and high resolution methods are good candidates in terms of computation demand and prediction accuracy on the steep front. This is the first time that these two frontier numerical methods are used for such a complex SMB system models and our results are encouraging for the development of model-based online control scheme. In developing a new scheme to rapidly obtain the solution at steady state for any arbitrary initial condition, the concept of Quasi-Envelope (QE) is adopted under the consideration that a SMBCP can be treated as a pseudo-oscillatory process because of a large number of continuous switching. The scheme allows larger steps to be taken to predict the slow change of starting state within each switching. Combined with previously developed wavelet-based technique, this method is successfully applied to the simulation of a SMB sugar separation process. Investigations are also carried out on the location of proper starting point for the algorithm and on the effect of changing stepsize to the convergence of iteration method. It is found that if the starting state of Quasi-Envelope is chosen to be the same as the original function, the multivalue algorithm would require similar computational effort to achieve the steady state prediction, regardless of the integration stepsize. If using constant stepsize, launching QE later is helpful when quasi-envelope displays steep change at the start-up period. A changing stepsize produces slow convergence compared to the constant stepsize strategy, thus increasing the work load where the stepsize change is occurring. Other iteration method is required to be imposed to achieve faster convergence right from the beginning. Potential applications can be seen for other chemical engineering processes with inherent cyclic behaviour...|$|R
