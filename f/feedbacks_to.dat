25|$|A further unique {{feature of}} heavy-water {{moderation}} is the greater {{stability of the}} chain reaction. This {{is due to the}} relatively low binding energy of the deuterium nucleus (2.2 MeV), leading to some energetic neutrons and especially gamma rays breaking the deuterium nuclei apart to produce extra neutrons. Both gammas produced directly by fission and by the decay of fission fragments have enough energy, and the half-lives of the fission fragments range from seconds to hours or even years. The slow response of these gamma-generated neutrons delays the response of the reactor and gives the operators extra time in case of an emergency. Since gamma rays travel for meters through water, an increased rate of chain reaction {{in one part of the}} reactor will produce a response from the rest of the reactor, allowing various negative <b>feedbacks</b> <b>to</b> stabilize the reaction.|$|E
2500|$|Snow {{cover is}} an {{extremely}} important storage component in the water balance, especially seasonal snowpacks in mountainous areas of the world. Though limited in extent, seasonal snowpacks in the Earth’s mountain ranges account for {{the major source of}} the runoff for stream flow and groundwater recharge over wide areas of the midlatitudes. For example, over 85% of the annual runoff from the Colorado River basin originates as snowmelt. Snowmelt runoff from the Earth’s mountains fills the rivers and recharges the aquifers that over a billion people depend on for their water resources. Further, over 40% of the world’s protected areas are in mountains, attesting to their value both as unique ecosystems needing protection and as recreation areas for humans. Climate warming is expected to result in major changes to the partitioning of snow and rainfall, and to the timing of snowmelt, which will have important implications for water use and management. These changes also involve potentially important decadal and longer time-scale <b>feedbacks</b> <b>to</b> the climate system through temporal and spatial changes in soil moisture and runoff to the oceans.(Walsh 1995). Freshwater fluxes from the snow cover into the marine environment may be important, as the total flux is probably of the same magnitude as desalinated ridging and rubble areas of sea ice. In addition, there is an associated pulse of precipitated pollutants which accumulate over the Arctic winter in snowfall and are released into the ocean upon ablation of the sea-ice [...]|$|E

5000|$|Action {{selection}} studies {{deal with}} negative or positive weighting to an action and its outcome. Neurorobots can {{and have been}} used to study *simple* ethical interactions, such as the classical thought experiment where there are more people than a life raft can hold, and someone must leave the boat to save the rest. However, more neurorobots used in the study of action selection contend with much simpler persuasions such as self-preservation or perpetuation of the population of robots in the study. These neurorobots are modeled after the neuromodulation of synapses to encourage circuits with positive results. In biological systems, neurotransmitters such as dopamine or acetylcholine positively reinforce neural signals that are beneficial. One study of such interaction involved the robot Darwin VII, which used visual, auditory, and a simulated taste input to [...] "eat" [...] conductive metal blocks. The arbitrarily chosen good blocks had a striped pattern on them while the bad blocks had a circular shape on them. The taste sense was simulated by conductivity of the blocks. The robot had positive and negative <b>feedbacks</b> <b>to</b> the taste based on its level of conductivity. The researchers observed the robot to see how it learned its action selection behaviors based on the inputs it had. Other studies have used herds of small robots which feed on batteries strewn about the room, and communicate its findings to other robots.|$|E

However, providing quality <b>feedback</b> <b>to</b> students is challenging in the current context, in which universities increasingly rely on casualised and inexperienced academic staff to assess undergraduate work. Ensuring that these staff are suitably equipped <b>to</b> provide quality <b>feedback</b> <b>to</b> students is vital if student learning and satisfaction goals are to be met. This article reports on a learning and teaching project undertaken in the School of Justice (Faculty of Law) at Queensland University of Technology, which sought to address this issue. The project involved delivering an evidence-based training workshop to all casual academic staff in the School, on how to provide quality constructive <b>feedback</b> <b>to</b> students. Results from online surveys of sessional staff (n = 9) and a sample of undergraduate students (n = 141) are presented in this article. Findings suggest that on the whole, staff felt better equipped <b>to</b> provide constructive <b>feedback</b> <b>to</b> students following the workshop, and students perceived an improvement in the feedback they received. We conclude that such training can create a modest improvement in the provision of <b>feedback</b> <b>to</b> students...|$|R
