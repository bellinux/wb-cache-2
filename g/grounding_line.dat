The <b>ground</b> <b>lines</b> consist of three lines which is the curb line, design line and the Gross Vehicle Weight <b>line</b> (GVW). The <b>ground</b> <b>lines</b> position is essential to be determined {{at the beginning of a}} project due to the influence on design and styling. The first method of determining the position of the <b>ground</b> <b>lines</b> is to identify and research on the factors that need to be analyze first before the position of the <b>ground</b> <b>lines</b> is obtained.

40|$|Abstract— In layout drawing, one of {{the basic}} {{components}} that it must have is the estimation of <b>ground</b> <b>lines</b> that will enable engineers to measure the clearance of car components especially the lower part to ground. This paper explains how to formulate simple equations in order to estimate the location of <b>ground</b> <b>lines</b> by taking into account the suspension characteristics of the car as well as three cases of weight loadings. Furthermore a program is written in assembly language in order to ease engineers in getting the <b>ground</b> <b>lines</b> coordinates at specific loadings. The result of program calculation will provide the estimation of the wheel centers as well as the <b>ground</b> <b>lines.</b> In the modeling, car body is placed as static whereas the <b>ground</b> <b>lines</b> moves vertically. Of course in real case the vice versa happens, however this method is unavoidable since in car drawing, one does not want to move the car drawing from its datum due to its dependability to the datum of other components. The result from the wheel center coordinates and the <b>ground</b> <b>lines</b> location will enable engineer to estimate the displacement of spring {{and at the same time}} the vertical deformation of tire. In conclusion, this method of <b>ground</b> <b>lines</b> will help design engineers or packaging engineers in automotive development company to speed up the layout making and hence will minimize costly error later at development stage...|$|R

50|$|Ice {{shelves are}} principally driven by gravity-driven {{pressure}} from the grounded ice.

Ice shelves lose mass through iceberg breakup (calving), or basal melting (at {{the foot of}} the glacier, when warm ocean water impacts), and this can affect ice sheet stability when the land based glaciers start to retreat; melting or breakup of floating shelf ice does not directly affect global sea levels, however, when sea ice freezes, it preferentially expels salt, in the process becoming purer than the sea water it is floating in. Pure water is less dense than salty water, so when the ice melts it will overflow the 'hole in the water' that the ice had occupied, and when it overflows, it raises the water level.|$|E

40|$|<b>Grounding</b> <b>line</b> {{migration}} {{is a key}} process affecting the stability of marine ice sheets such as the West Antarctic ice sheet (WAIS). <b>Grounding</b> <b>line</b> motion is often included in numerical models simulating the past and future evolution of the WAIS; however, {{little attention has been}} paid to the numerical consistency of these models. The aim of this paper is to assess the ability of simple versions of existing marine ice sheet models to simulate <b>grounding</b> <b>line</b> migration. In particular, we investigate the response of the <b>grounding</b> <b>line</b> to external forcing and the sensitivity of the models' predictions to their numerics and the mechanical coupling between ice sheet and shelf. From the model comparison, there is no consensus on how the <b>grounding</b> <b>line</b> should react to changes in boundary conditions. A crucial finding is the strong dependency of models using a fixed grid on numerical details such as the horizontal grid size. This implies that we should be very wary about <b>grounding</b> <b>line</b> predictions from such models. Including mechanical coupling at the <b>grounding</b> <b>line</b> does not seem to change the qualitative behavior of the models. This suggests that the way the <b>grounding</b> <b>line</b> is treated in marine ice sheet models dominantly determines the <b>grounding</b> <b>line</b> dynamics. We find that models that employ a moving grid to explicitly track the <b>grounding</b> <b>line</b> do not share many of the deficiencies of the fixed grid models. We conclude that at present, no reliable model of the <b>grounding</b> <b>line</b> is available, and further model development is urgently needed. ...|$|E
