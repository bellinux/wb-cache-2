REITs <b>were</b> found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sensitive <b>to</b> <b>changes</b> in the long-term interest rates in 1973 - 1979, but in 1980 - 1985, REITs <b>were</b> sensitive <b>to</b> <b>changes</b> in both short-term and long-term rates.

25|$|The center-pivot {{irrigation}} system {{is considered to}} be a highly efficient system which helps conserve water. However, by 2013, as the water consumption efficiency of the center-pivot irrigator improved over the years, farmers chose to plant more intensively, irrigate more land, and grow thirstier crops rather than reduce water consumption. One approach to reducing the amount of groundwater used is to employ treated recycled water for irrigation; another approach <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> to crops that require less water, such as sunflowers.|$|E

25|$|Smallholding farmers {{not only}} {{frequently}} lack access to markets, they lack {{access to resources}} that lead to sustainable cocoa farming practices. Lack of sustainability can be due to pests, diseases that attack cocoa trees, lack of farming supplies, and {{lack of knowledge about}} modern farming techniques. One issue pertaining to cocoa plantation sustainability is the amount of time it takes for a cocoa tree to produce pods. A solution to this <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the type of cocoa tree being farmed. In Ghana, a hybrid cocoa tree yields two crops after three years rather than the typical one crop after five years.|$|E
25|$|A {{condenser}} is a {{piece of}} apparatus or equipment {{that can be used to}} condense, that <b>is,</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the physical state of a substance from its gaseous to its liquid state; in the laboratory, it is generally used in procedures done with organic liquids brought into gaseous state through heating or application of vacuum (lowered pressure), though processes often involve at least trace amounts of the common inorganic component water, and can involve other inorganic substances as well. Condensers can be applied at various scales, from micro-scale (very few microliters) to process-scale (many liters), using laboratory glassware and occasionally metalware that accomplishes the cooling of the vapor generated by boiling (through heating or application of vacuum).|$|E

25|$|Western riding is a {{style of}} horseback riding which evolved from the {{ranching}} and warfare traditions brought to the Americas by the Spanish Conquistadors, and both equipment and riding style evolved to meet the working needs of the cowboy in the American West. American cowboys needed to work long hours in the saddle over rough terrain, sometimes needing to rope cattle with a lariat (or lasso). Because of the necessity to control the horse {{with one hand and}} use a lariat with the other, western horses were trained to neck rein, that <b>is,</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> direction with light pressure of a rein against the horse's neck. Horses were also trained to exercise a certain degree of independence in using their natural instincts to follow the movements of a cow, thus a riding style developed that emphasized a deep, secure seat, and training methods encouraged a horse to be responsive on very light rein contact.|$|E
25|$|Changes in {{the orbital}} {{eccentricity}} of Earth occur on {{a cycle of}} about 100,000 years. The inclination, or tilt, of Earth's axis varies periodically between 22° and 24.5°. (The tilt of Earth's axis {{is responsible for the}} seasons; the greater the tilt, the greater the contrast between summer and winter temperatures.) Changes in the tilt occur in a cycle 41,000 years long. Precession of the equinoxes, or wobbles on Earth's spin axis, complete every 26,000 years. According to the Milankovitch theory, these factors cause a periodic cooling of Earth, with the coldest part in the cycle occurring about every 40,000 years. The main effect of the Milankovitch cycles <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the contrast between the seasons, not the amount of solar heat Earth receives. These cycles within cycles predict that during maximum glacial advances, winter and summer temperatures are lower. The result is less ice melting than accumulating, and glaciers build up.|$|E

25|$|Droops {{function}} with other high-lift devices on an aircraft {{to increase the}} camber of the wing and reduce the stalling speed. On the Airbus A380, {{the first stage of}} lift device selection deploys the droops (called droop noses by Airbus) and leading-edge slats located further out on the wing; with the flaps starting to extend when the second stage is selected. The droops on the A380 may be deployed to a position 22 or 25 degrees lower than their stowed position. Another function of the droops on the A380 <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the stall characteristics of the wing. The A380's designers found that the airflow between the engines was separating from the wing surface prior to the airflow between the engine and the fuselage, an undesirable characteristic. Adding a droop between the engine and the fuselage fixed the problem; whereas using a leading-edge slat would not have done so because of the gap (or slot) created between a slat and the wing when a slat is deployed.|$|E
25|$|The {{prostate}} is a zinc-accumulating, citrate-producing organ. The protein ZIP1 {{is responsible}} for the active transport of zinc into prostate cells. One of the zinc's important roles <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the metabolism of the cell in order to produce citrate, an important component of semen. The process of zinc accumulation, alteration of metabolism, and citrate production is energy inefficient, and prostate cells sacrifice enormous amounts of energy (ATP) in order to accomplish this task. Prostate cancer cells are generally devoid of zinc. This allows prostate cancer cells to save energy not making citrate, and utilize the new abundance of energy to grow and spread. The absence of zinc is thought to occur via a silencing of the gene that produces the transporter protein ZIP1. ZIP1 is now called a tumor suppressor gene product for the gene SLC39A1. The cause of the epigenetic silencing is unknown. Strategies which transport zinc into transformed prostate cells effectively eliminate these cells in animals. Zinc inhibits NF-κB pathways, is anti-proliferative and induces apoptosis in abnormal cells. Unfortunately, oral ingestion of zinc is ineffective since high concentrations of zinc into prostate cells is not possible without the active transporter, ZIP1.|$|E
