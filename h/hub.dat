5|$|A bus-powered <b>hub</b> is a {{high-power}} device providing low-power ports. It draws 1 {{unit load}} for the <b>hub</b> controller and 1 unit load {{for each of}} at most 4 ports. The <b>hub</b> may also have some non-removable functions in place of ports. A self-powered <b>hub</b> is a device that provides high-power ports. Optionally, the <b>hub</b> controller draw power for its operation as a low-power device, but all high-power ports draw from the hub's self-power.|$|E
5|$|Dayton is {{designated}} as the state's aerospace <b>hub</b> due to its high concentration of aerospace and aviation technology. In 2009, Governor Ted Strickland designated Dayton as Ohio's aerospace innovation <b>hub,</b> the first such technology <b>hub</b> in the state. Aircraft engine manufacturing accounts for nearly 75% of Ohio's aerospace and defense industry workforce.|$|E

5|$|High-speed USB2.0 hubs contain devices called {{transaction}} translators that convert between high-speed USB2.0 {{buses and}} full and low speed buses. When a high-speed USB2.0 <b>hub</b> is plugged into a high-speed USB host or <b>hub,</b> it operates in high-speed mode. The USB <b>hub</b> then uses either one transaction translator per <b>hub</b> {{to create a}} full/low-speed bus routed to all full and low speed devices on the <b>hub,</b> or uses one transaction translator per port to create an isolated full/low-speed bus per port on the <b>hub.</b>|$|E

5|$|American Airlines {{announced}} in 1985 {{that it would}} establish a <b>hub</b> at Nashville, investing $115 million {{to develop a new}} 15-gate concourse and applying for $50 million in federal funds to build a new 10,000-foot runway. The <b>hub</b> was intended to compete with Delta Air Lines, Eastern Airlines and Piedmont Airlines for north-south traffic in the eastern United States. American and its regional affiliate American Eagle officially opened their <b>hub</b> in Nashville in April 1986. Besides providing nonstop flights to many cities in the U.S. and Canada, American also operated a transatlantic flight to from Nashville to London (flying into Gatwick Airport). The American <b>hub</b> was touted as a selling point in bringing companies such as Nissan and Saturn Corporation to the Nashville area.|$|E
30|$|This {{differentiation}} of logistics <b>hubs</b> in transport logistics <b>hubs</b> {{on the one}} side and distribution logistics <b>hubs</b> on the other is fundamental in terms of freight transport demand modelling, because attracted goods and transports operated at these <b>hubs</b> differ significantly.|$|R
30|$|The review {{revealed}} {{that there are}} only few models, which consider logistics <b>hubs</b> in general. Although logistics <b>hubs</b> are currently taken into account in most of the reviewed models, it has to be kept in mind that the considered <b>hubs</b> are mostly distribution logistics <b>hubs,</b> which can be derived from the definition of <b>hubs</b> through their function (see chapter 2). Refocussing on the objective of our article we have to state that transport logistics <b>hubs</b> are included in much less cases and detail than has so far been the case with distribution logistics <b>hubs</b> (see chapter 4).|$|R
30|$|<b>Hubs</b> play a {{significant}} role in the information integration. In the present study, number and location of active <b>hubs</b> were compared within the group for recall scores. For the good navigators, the best performers (higher recall score) had the left frontal, anterior frontal, frontocentral, occipital and, temporal leads as the <b>hubs,</b> while the worst performers had the left frontal, anterior frontal, frontocentral, and occipital electrode positions as the <b>hubs.</b> On the contrary, for the bad navigators, similar <b>hubs</b> were active in the best and worst performers; however, a number of active <b>hubs</b> were lesser compared to the good navigators. Those <b>hubs</b> were left frontal, anterior frontal, and frontocentral sites.|$|R

50|$|The {{need for}} hosts {{to be able}} to detect {{collisions}} limits the number of <b>hubs</b> and the total size of a network built using <b>hubs</b> (a network built using switches does not have these limitations). For 10 Mbit/s networks built using repeater <b>hubs,</b> the 5-4-3 rule must be followed: up to five segments (four <b>hubs)</b> are allowed between any two end stations. For 10BASE-T networks, up to five segments and four repeaters are allowed between any two hosts. For 100 Mbit/s networks, the limit is reduced to 3 segments (2 Class II <b>hubs)</b> between any two end stations, and even that is only allowed if the <b>hubs</b> are of Class II. Some <b>hubs</b> have manufacturer specific stack ports allowing them to be combined in a way that allows more <b>hubs</b> than simple chaining through Ethernet cables, but even so, a large Fast Ethernet network is likely to require switches to avoid the chaining limits of <b>hubs.</b>|$|R
50|$|Gnutella2 divides nodes {{into two}} groups: Leaves and <b>Hubs.</b> Most Leaves {{maintain}} two connections to <b>Hubs,</b> while <b>Hubs</b> accept hundreds of Leaf connections, {{and an average}} of 7 connections to other <b>Hubs.</b> When a search is initiated, the node obtains a list of <b>Hubs,</b> if needed, and contacts the <b>Hubs</b> in the list, noting which have been searched, until the list is exhausted or a predefined search limit has been reached. This allows a user to find a popular file easily without loading the network, while, theoretically, maintaining the ability for a user to find a single file located anywhere on the network.|$|R
5|$|In September 2011, SpiceJet {{launched}} its regional <b>hub</b> at RGIA, using its new Bombardier Q400 aircraft.

30|$|Within freight {{transport}} processes, transport logistics <b>hubs</b> gained growing empirical {{significance in the}} recent past. This implies a major relevance to consider them in demand modelling, too. Nevertheless, the review revealed that the consideration of transport logistics <b>hubs</b> in {{freight transport}} demand modelling varies significantly. The majority of the existing freight models (≈ 100) do not integrate transport logistics <b>hubs.</b> Models in application focus on distribution logistics <b>hubs</b> in many cases but only few integrate transport logistics <b>hubs</b> to some extent.|$|R
40|$|A {{wide range}} of {{networked}} systems exhibit highly connected nodes (<b>hubs)</b> as prominent structural elements. The functional roles of <b>hubs</b> in the collective nonlinear dynamics of many such networks, however, are not well understood. Here we propose that <b>hubs</b> in neural circuits may activate local signal transmission along sequences of specific subnetworks. Intriguingly, in contrast to previous suggestions of the functional roles of <b>hubs,</b> here not the <b>hubs</b> themselves, but non-hub subnetworks transfer the signals. The core mechanism relies on <b>hubs</b> and non-hubs providing activating feedback to each other. It may thus induce the propagation of specific pulse and rate signals in neuronal and other communication networks...|$|R
