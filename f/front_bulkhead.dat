50|$|Unlike its predecessor, the R3 was not {{available}} in Coupe, Cabriolet or Tourer bodystyles, although Rover updated these versions of the older model with mild styling revisions and the fitting of the new dashboard from the R3, which was possible due to the shared <b>front</b> <b>bulkhead.</b> In the UK, these models were no longer branded as 200/400 models, simply being {{referred to as the}} Rover Coupe, Cabriolet and Tourer.|$|E
50|$|The chassis of the 32 was an {{aluminium}} monocoque {{with steel}} <b>front</b> and rear <b>bulkhead</b> and centre section {{to bring it}} up to weight. Suspension followed the usual Lotus practice; coil spring/damper units were mounted inboard at the front and outboard at the rear. The front wishbones were slightly wider-based while rear geometry had changed and was fully adjustable, unlike the Lotus 27. The Girling brakes were outboard all round.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to propose {{guidelines}} to model and analyse, by considering a hybrid finite element and multibody approach, an aircraft seat sled test, as well as experimentally performed for certification purposes. The main advantage of such numerical approach consists in achieving a lean procedure to forecast structural and biomechanics performances of the seat, with a considerable saving of experimental costs and with reasonable calculation time. In particular, the paper deals with the simulation of an experimental seat sled test against the aircraft <b>front</b> fuselage <b>bulkhead.</b> The FE model has been built by using LSTC-LsDyna® code; the multibody model has been built by considering TNO-Madymo code.

50|$|While {{bulkheads}} {{may serve}} their purpose to slow erosion at a bluff or beachfront, they commonly cause a domino effect of {{change to the}} beach profile. The increased wave reflection caused by their presence can result in an increased re-suspension of sand in the water in <b>front</b> of the <b>bulkhead.</b> This can lead to more sand being distributed in the alongshore direction, away from the beach profile. Due to coastal littoral drift, the sand would then instead be distributed toward {{the ends of the}} bulkheads, leaving larger gravel and sometimes bedrock in place of the once sandy beach.|$|R
5000|$|Most of the {{spacecraft}} systems were {{at the front of}} the cylinder, up against the <b>front</b> <b>bulkhead.</b> The crew were seated in one row near the rear bulkhead and access hatch, with 2 [...] "crew" [...] seats on the sides with flight controls on the rear bulkhead and one passenger in the middle. Cargo was carried in the middle of the capsule, at the capsule's center of gravity, to simplify loading effects on reentry angles and lift.|$|E
5000|$|The {{structural}} design, revolutionary at the time, applied aeronautical technology. The [...] "tub", or cockpit section, was of monocoque construction, mostly comprising {{sheets of}} aluminium alloy. Its elliptical shape and comparatively small cross-section provided torsional rigidity and reduced drag. To the <b>front</b> <b>bulkhead</b> was attached an aluminium tubing subframe for the engine, steering assembly, and front suspension. Rear suspension and final drive were mounted {{to the rear}} bulkhead. Fuel was carried in the tail and the designers followed aviation practice by specifying a deformable Marston Aviation Division bag {{in place of a}} conventional tank.|$|E
50|$|Many {{other changes}} were also made in 1980. The body was {{completely}} redesigned, making it slightly larger {{and with a}} more squared off roofline. Additional emphasis was given to ergonomics, aerodynamics, and safety. Shoulder room, leg room, and head space were all increased, and the trunk was slightly enlarged for more luggage capacity. In particular, rear seat passengers received more room for their heads and legs. The shifter was {{moved closer to the}} driver, and ventilation was greatly improved. The interior was made quieter with additional carpeting and other acoustic dampening materials and a double-thickness <b>front</b> <b>bulkhead.</b> An electric sunroof was also new.|$|E
50|$|The cabin had convex <b>bulkheads</b> <b>front</b> {{and rear}} {{with the main}} entry hatch in the roof and {{emergency}} exit through a porthole at the rear. Seven portholes gave sufficient vision with five for the pilot and two for the radio operator/observer. A maximum design pressure differential of 0.22 kg/cm2 (3.2 lb/in2) held the cabin altitude at 8,000m (26,250 ft) up to the aircraft ceiling of 14,000 m (46,260 ft). With the cabin structure sealed, cabin air was dumped overboard at a controlled rate through a dump valve and replaced with oxygen, from storage bottles, maintaining oxygen levels roughly constant. Heating was supplied through radiators in the engine cooling circuit, to keep the cabin between 15 and 18 °C.|$|R
50|$|The first chassis and the jig {{to produce}} it were built together. Lawrence laid out a chassis with a central tunnel made of four square-section 18 gauge steel tubes with {{extensive}} cross-bracing. Two long steel boxes with triangular cross-sections were made of 16 gauge steel and attached to the chassis in the door sill area. These stiffened the chassis and were also {{to serve as the}} car's fuel tanks. 16 gauge aluminum formed the <b>front</b> and rear <b>bulkheads</b> and floors and was used {{on both sides of the}} central tunnel to stiffen the car further. Voids in the tunnel were filled with expanded polyurethane foam to add even more stiffness and deaden sound.|$|R

50|$|For safety reasons {{all modern}} cars feature a {{collapsible}} steering column (energy absorbing steering column) which will collapse {{in the event of}} a heavy frontal impact to avoid excessive injuries to the driver. Airbags are also generally fitted as standard. Non-{{collapsible steering column}}s fitted to older vehicles very often impaled drivers in frontal crashes, particularly when the steering box or rack was mounted in front of the front axle line, at the front of the crumple zone. This was particularly a problem on vehicles that had a rigid separate chassis frame, with no crumple zone. Most modern vehicle steering boxes/racks are mounted behind the front axle on the <b>front</b> <b>bulkhead,</b> at the rear of the front crumple zone.|$|E
50|$|Mitsubishi's fourth {{iteration}} of the Galant Σ/Eterna Σ debuted {{many new}} innovations for Mitsubishi. The car was sold as the Mitsubishi Galant in most export markets, although in both Australia and New Zealand {{it was known}} as the Mitsubishi Sigma. The fourth generation sedan and coupé were both slightly larger than the third generation cars. Additional emphasis was given to ergonomics, aerodynamics, and safety. Shoulder room, leg room, and head space were all increased, and the trunk was slightly enlarged for more luggage capacity. The interior was made quieter with additional carpeting and other acoustic dampening materials and a double-thickness <b>front</b> <b>bulkhead.</b> The wagon version was also changed, although from the firewall back the vehicle remained the same as the previous version.|$|E
60|$|The {{afternoon}} was deliciously balmy, {{and when the}} felucca drew in with the land, {{the surface of the}} sea was as smooth as that of an inland lake. There was just wind enough to cool the air, and to propel the little vessel three or four knots through the water. The day apartment occupied by our hero and heroine, was on the quarter-deck. It was formed, on the exterior, by a tarpauling, bent like the tilt of a wagon, while the interior was embellished with a lining of precious stuffs that converted it into a beautiful little saloon. In <b>front,</b> a canvas <b>bulkhead</b> protected it from the gaze of the crew; and, toward the stearn a rich curtain fell, when it became necessary to shut out the view.

5000|$|When the Raleigh Bicycle Company {{decided to}} {{discontinue}} {{the manufacture of}} their three-wheeled vehicles in 1934, their Works Manager Mr T. L. Williams and a colleague, Mr E. S. Thompson, felt that the days of lightweight three-wheelers were not over. They decided {{to build their own}} vehicle in Williams's back garden at Kettlebrook, Tamworth. The homebuilt design closely resembled the Karryall van previously built by Raleigh, and the prototype was licensed in January 1935. It was a 7 cwt (356 kg) van with a steel chassis, powered by a 600 cc single-cylinder engine driving the rear wheels through a 3-speed gearbox and chain drive. The body was a hardwood frame with aluminium panels attached to it, in the traditional manner of the time. With the obvious motorcycle front end, mounted in the open, in <b>front</b> of the <b>bulkhead,</b> it was essentially a motorcycle fitted with a box body. Indeed, the initial prototype had handlebars for steering [...] although after several trials with small local companies this was changed for a steering wheel.|$|R
50|$|Armour kits from tired Hotspurs were fitted onto brand-new Land Rover Defender 110 {{civilian}} chassis. When donor kits ran out, the RUC workshops {{began to}} fabricate brand-new ones.

At {{the front and rear}} of the roof each of the Tangis were fitted with a remotely controlled spotlight and a rotating blue warning light, all protected by expanded metal grilles. The Hotspur's side skirts were retained, as was its fire protection system. In addition, burning petrol was prevented from entering the engine bay by a fabric strip around the bonnet edge and at the hinge between the bonnet and the <b>front</b> <b>bulkhead.</b> Further, the engine radiator was protected from damage with a substantial louvred grill fabricated from 3 mm steel sheet.|$|E
5000|$|The car {{also had}} other {{modifications}} made to it, with a redesign of the <b>front</b> <b>bulkhead</b> and mostly drilled box section {{included in the}} chassis modifications. RHAM/1 also had roller bearing drive shafts and peg-drive centre lock hubs for the one piece custom made BBS magnesium wheels. The wheels measured 19" [...] in diameter, 15" [...] wide at the rear, and 13" [...] wide at the front and had special, custom made Dunlop tyres for them. The wheels themselves needed to be bigger than 16" [...] {{to go over the}} twin caliper, 12½" [...] Lockheed, ventilated disc brakes, with no servo assistance. All of which was needed to stop the 30 cwt Aston Martin. The alternator was switched to run off the gearbox (which itself had a closer ratio 5th gear) instead of the engine crankshaft. The clutch was now uprated to a triple plate. The suspension was almost standard, with standard rubber bushes but with slight geometry changes. Nylon mountings were also used for a reduced width Dion tube. The roll cage was a NASCAR (instead of FIA) specification cage, which was bolted to the chassis. This alone weighed 50 kg.|$|E
5000|$|At 7:25 p.m. local time, the Hindenburg {{caught fire}} and quickly became engulfed in flames. Eyewitness {{statements}} disagree {{as to where}} the fire initially broke out; several witnesses {{on the port side}} saw yellow-red flames first jump forward of the top fin near the ventilation shaft of cells 4 and 5. Other witnesses on the port side noted the fire actually began just ahead of the horizontal port fin, only then followed by flames in front of the upper fin. One, with views of the starboard side, saw flames beginning lower and farther aft, near cell 1 behind the rudders. Inside the airship, helmsman Helmut Lau, who was stationed in the lower fin, testified hearing a muffled detonation and looked up to see a bright reflection on the <b>front</b> <b>bulkhead</b> of gas cell 4, which [...] "suddenly disappeared by the heat". As other gas cells started to catch fire, the fire spread more to the starboard side and the ship dropped rapidly. Although there were cameramen from four newsreel teams and at least one spectator known to be filming the landing, as well as numerous photographers at the scene, no known footage or photograph exists of the moment the fire started.|$|E
40|$|The main {{topic of}} {{the paper is the}} {{definition}} of the optimal design of an aeronautical seat, in terms of maximization of occupants’ safety level and of prediction capability of a FE/MB coupled numerical procedure, based on TNO Madymo® MB software and LSTC LS-Dyna® FE software. The proposed numerical procedure can support the physical prototype development and the experimental phase of the current design approach by using design of experiments methods. In particular, the paper deals with the simulation of an experimental seat sled test against the aircraft <b>front</b> fuselage <b>bulkhead</b> (Figure 1). The FE model has been analysed by using LSTC-LsDyna® code; the multibody model has been analysed by considering TNO-Madymo code. Parameters evaluated during the tests are the acceleration of the head, with the relative calculation of HIC, and the loads transmitted to the lower limbs of the dummy. To approach the development phase, it may result very effective to take into account previous experiences, before entering the cumbersome development of the detailed finite element model. The implementation of simplified multibody (MB) structural models, together with design of experiment (DOE) may simplify the definition of the crashworthy scenario for a new seat. Though the adoption of an integrated MB and DOE approach will not eliminate the need for a detailed FE impact model and its experimental validation, it will surely help in identifying the most sensitive parameters to be complying with the applicable regulation (from the numerical simulation point of view) and in reducing the number of tests needed to reach the certification requirements. The paper presents the initial attempt in applying such development strategy, highlighting the importance of previous experience and how to take advantage from it through dedicated self- developed computer tools...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, Mechanical Engineering. "May 2006. "Includes bibliographic {{references}} (leaves 66 - 69) There {{has been}} enormous {{boom in the}} air travel in recent times. There is increasing demand for the technological advancement nowadays towards {{the safety of the}} onboard passengers. Certification of aircrafts requires engineers to demonstrate that a head contact with any aircraft interior complies with the Head injury criteria (HIC) threshold of 1000 units specified in 14 CFR 23. 562, 25. 562, 27. 562. Analyzing injuries {{to the head of the}} occupant when it comes to contact with any aircraft cabin interiors is of serious issue. HIC compliance is a major concern for all the segments of the aircraft industry due to high cost involved in the certification. This research is an attempt to find a cost effective and yet valid approach to solve the HIC problem for the <b>front</b> row <b>bulkhead</b> seats in transport aircrafts. Previous experience, Quasi static testing, Finite element modeling and Madymo biodynamic simulations are utilized for the HIC compliant bulkheads. Madymo (Mathematical Dynamical Model) is a software package which can be used to simulate the dynamic behavior of Mechanical systems. It has a unique combination of fully integrated multibody and finite element techniques. Quasi static testing on various cell size honeycomb core configurations was carried out. Finite element modeling of honeycomb core was done using Msc Patran software package. Comprehensive parametric study has been carried out on different boundary conditions in which the bulkhead may be fixed. Variable thicknesses of the bulkhead which can be used has been looked upon in this study. Different restraint systems and varied seat setback distances have been used for the parametric study. Nylon belt and the Polyester belt are the two different types of belts with different elongation characteristics which are used in this study. The validated madymo models are then used to conduct a parametric study on the effect of the stiffness and strength of the bulkhead on HIC attenuation below the injury levels...|$|R

50|$|The Mark I Ford Consul and Zephyr {{models were}} first {{displayed}} at the Earls Court Motor Show in 1950. They were the first British cars to use in mass production the MacPherson Strut independent front suspension which is widely used today. Production began with the Consul on 1 January 1951. The Mark I model ran until 1956. From April 1956 the Mark II Consul, Zephyr and Zodiac went on sale and were known as the Three Graces. The Mark II range was popular and finished its run in 1962, when from April that year the Mark III Zephyr 4, Zephyr 6 and Zodiac went on sale. The Consul name was dropped, the car's place in the Ford UK line-up being filled by the first four-cylinder Ford Zephyr. While the Mark II Zephyr and Zodiacs had shared the same body (the Consul had shorter <b>front</b> guards and <b>bulkhead),</b> the new Zodiac and Zephyrs launched in 1962 shared few body panels. With the Mark III, Ford finally sorted out problems that had beset previous models (Mark I axles and Mark II gearboxes were particular weaknesses) and the Mark III proved to be popular and the most durable of the range. The model sold at a rate equal to or better than the Mark II both in the UK and overseas, but was in production for a shorter time. During {{the last months of}} production, an up-market Executive version was added to the Mark III range. The Mk III range was discontinued in January 1966 and the completely new Zephyr / Zodiac Mark IV range was released in April 1966.
