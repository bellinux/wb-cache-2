25|$|The <b>emergency</b> <b>escape</b> ramp {{are also}} {{provided}} here {{especially on the}} one way downhill Genting Sempah bound. This <b>emergency</b> <b>escape</b> ramp that enables vehicles that are having braking problems to safely stop. It is typically a long, sand or gravel-filled lane adjacent to a road with a steep grade, and is designed to accommodate large heavy vehicles. The deep gravel allows the heavy vehicles momentum to be dissipated in a controlled and relatively harmless way, allowing the operator to stop it safely.|$|R

The player can also use one Power stock to cancel a guard into a Knockdown Blow or an <b>Emergency</b> <b>Escape,</b> or do a Quick <b>Emergency</b> <b>Escape</b> during a normal or command move.|$|R
50|$|The first {{prototype}} V-10 {{emerged with}} canted main undercarriage legs with single wheels {{on all four}} legs, {{as well as a}} retractable <b>emergency</b> <b>escape</b> chute extending below the cockpit and external auxiliary fuel tanks either side of the centre fuselage. As development progressed the main undercarriage legs were replaced with vertical units carrying twin wheels, twin nose undercarriage wheels after a period retaining the single wheels, an Auxiliary power unit (APU) installed behind the cockpit on the starboard side and <b>emergency</b> <b>escape</b> slide cables for use when the pallet is carried.|$|R

50|$|The rear {{verandah}} {{is fully}} enclosed, and partly extended {{on the west}} side. A narrow corridor runs from the landing access door onto the verandah to a window and a fire <b>escape</b> <b>door.</b> On the west side are two small rooms, the first containing a shower and basin, the second a toilet. The enclosed verandah {{on the east side}} is lined with ripple iron. It has a window to the east side elevation and rear elevation. Timber decking runs from the fire <b>escape</b> <b>door</b> across the roofs of the single story ground-level extensions.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. For {{controlling}} <b>emergency</b> <b>escaping</b> by a {{bus driver}} {{in the case of}} air control door cannot be opened normally, the paper presented a multi-manual <b>emergency</b> <b>escaping</b> system of pneumatic bus door. Bus driver and passenger can control doors expediently. The pneumatic circuit of the system and its overall arrangement is discussed. A manual control device with special valve core structure is designed. The working performance of the manual shift directional valve is analyzed. The results indicate that driver and passengers can control the bus doors under the state of abnormal condition via manual control devices in series connection rapidly. Driver and passengers control is without mutual interference. Manual shift directional valves are convenient, reliable and fast...|$|R
40|$|Where {{topographic}} {{and location}} controls require long, steep, descending grades special safety control for large heavy trucks is needed. Truck driver can lose vehicles breaking {{ability as a}} result of overheated brakes, mechanical failure or driver`s failure to downshift in appropriate time. Out-of-control vehicle needs to be stopped away from the main traffic stream. For that purpose, the Escape Ramps are constructed, <b>Emergency</b> <b>Escape</b> Ramp is relatively simple traffic facility, constructed as an alignment. Vehicle is stopped by ascending grade or/and by loose or crushable materials integrated as a pavement. <b>Emergency</b> <b>Escape</b> Ramp provide a safe stop to an out-of-control vehicle, without serious injury or serious damage to the driver and the vehicle...|$|R
5000|$|In Guard Break Mode (GB Mode), {{the player}} has a two stock Power Gauge. Like in SC Mode, the player can perform Super Special (one stock) and MAX Super Special Moves (two stock). The player can parry an opponent's attack using the [...] "Just Defend" [...] technique, {{guarding}} against an opponent's attacks at {{the precise moment}} it makes contact with the character, allowing the player to follow {{it up with a}} counterattack. Using one Power stock, the player can guard cancel into an <b>Emergency</b> <b>Escape</b> or do a Quick <b>Emergency</b> <b>Escape.</b> The player can also perform a Guard Break attack with one Power stock, which is an unblockable version of a character's Knockdown Attack.|$|R
