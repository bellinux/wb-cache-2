Multimedia is often using in traditional education. So it means, that teaching in distance cannot be using without multimedia. Even when we do not suspect, we are using elements of multimedia, for example: when we press the hyperlink, read the text or look at a picture. Multimedia is an excellent way to transfer various information to the student: the sound, an image or the mood. There is no limit for using it.
