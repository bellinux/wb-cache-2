40|$|We {{study how}} the visual catchiness (saliency) of {{relevant}} information impacts user engagement metrics such as <b>focused</b> <b>attention</b> and emotion (affect). Participants completed tasks {{in one of}} two conditions, where the task-relevant information either appeared salient or non-salient. Our analysis provides insights into relationships between saliency, <b>focused</b> <b>attention,</b> and affect. Participants reported more distraction in the non-salient condition, and non-salient information was slower to find than salient. Lackof-saliency led to a negative impact on affect, while saliency maintained positive affect, suggesting its helpfulness. Participants reported that it was easier to focus in the salient condition, although there was no significant improvement in the <b>focused</b> <b>attention</b> scale rating. Finally, this study suggests user interest in the topic is a good predictor of <b>focused</b> <b>attention,</b> which in turn is a good predictor of positive affect. These results suggest that enhancing saliency of user-interested topics seems a good strategy for boosting user engagement.

Additionally, it is unknown whether similar impairments occur in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). The current study used three RT tasks to address the nature of <b>focused</b> <b>attention</b> impairments in AD and MCI subjects. The results suggest that there were significant CRT and CCRT differences in AD subjects when compared to NECs. Furthermore, slowed RTs were also present in the MCI group, which provides evidence for impaired <b>focussed</b> <b>attention</b> and the inability to benefit from a cue in both the MCI and AD groups.

25|$|Dean's {{strategy}} arguably {{paid off}} in a historic victory as the Democrats took {{over control of the}} House of Representatives and the Senate in the 2006 mid-term elections. While it is likely this is also attributable to the shortcomings of the Republican Party in their dealings with the Iraq War and the scandals that occurred shortly before the election, Dean's emphasis on connecting with socially conservative, economic moderates in Republican-dominated states appears to have made some impact. Indeed, Democratic candidates won elections in such red states as Kansas, Indiana, and Montana. And while former Clinton strategist James Carville criticized Dean's efforts, saying more seats could have been won with the traditional plan of piling money solely into close races, the results and the strategy were met with tremendous approval by the party's executive committee in its December 2006 meeting. While he was chairman of the DCCC, Rahm Emanuel was known to have had disagreements over election strategy with Dean; Emanuel believed a more tactical approach, <b>focusing</b> <b>attention</b> on key districts, was necessary to ensure victory. Emanuel himself was criticised for his failure to support some progressive candidates, as Dean advocated.|$|E

500|$|Transgressive {{films as}} a {{distinct}} artistic movement began in the 1970s. [...] Unconcerned with genre distinctions, they drew inspiration equally from the nonconformity of European art cinema and experimental film, the gritty subject matter of Italian neorealism, and the shocking images of 1960s exploitation. [...] Some used hardcore pornography and horror, occasionally at the same time. [...] In the 1980s, filmmaker Nick Zedd identified this movement as the Cinema of Transgression and later wrote a manifesto. [...] Popular in midnight showings, they were mainly limited to large urban areas, which led academic Joan Hawkins to label them as [...] "downtown culture". [...] These films acquired a legendary reputation as they were discussed and debated in alternative weeklies, such as The Village Voice. [...] Home video would finally allow general audiences to see them, which gave many people their first taste of underground film. [...] Ernest Mathijs says that cult films often disrupt viewer expectations, such as giving characters transgressive motivations or <b>focusing</b> <b>attention</b> on elements outside the film. [...] Cult films can also transgress national stereotypes and genre conventions, such as Battle Royale (2000), which broke many rules of teenage slasher films. [...] The reverse – when films based on cult properties lose their transgressive edge – can result in derision and rejection by fans. [...] Audience participation itself can be transgressive, such as breaking long-standing taboos against talking during films and throwing things at the screen.|$|E
