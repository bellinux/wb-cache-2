5000|$|Prior to 2006, {{throughout}} Mets history, the team's batting helmets {{were designed}} to match the caps. The 1997 white alternate cap had no corresponding batting helmet, although first baseman John Olerud wore a white helmet on the field; the team used its standard batting helmets (matching the blue caps) in all games. Beginning in 1998, each alternate cap had a matching corresponding batting helmet with the same crown and bill colors, and the same [...] "NY" [...] logo crest applied as a decal {{on the front of}} the helmet. In 2006, however, the club began using the Rawlings Coolflo batting helmet, and changed the design of the helmet paired with the two-tone cap such that the cap and helmet no longer matched. The <b>helmet</b> <b>shell</b> was black; the bill and the front of the crown were painted metallic blue, the area of which conformed to the surface contours of the <b>helmet</b> <b>shell</b> and faded gradually toward the back. The [...] "NY" [...] crest on the front of this helmet was black with white outline and orange drop-shadow. The blue and all-black helmets received the same metallic paint treatment as the two-tone helmet, but still essentially matched the respective caps as the metallic paint was the same color as the <b>helmet</b> <b>shell</b> and the [...] "NY" [...] logo decals matched the crests on the corresponding caps.|$|E
50|$|The initial {{process begins}} with {{the making of the}} <b>helmet</b> <b>shell</b> using a vacuum forming machine and a metal mould. A sheet of black {{fortified}} plastic is heated and then lowered over the mould, where a vacuum pulls the plastic into shape over the mould. Once hardened instantly, a rubber mallet is used to release the plastic from the mould so that the excess plastic around brim of the helmet can be trimmed with a bandsaw and sanded. The helmet's fabric covers are made out of water-repellent wool that are cut in halves and stitched together to give the helmet a distinctive centred, front-to-back seam. Moving down the line of production, glue is applied to both the inside of the fabric cover and the outside surface of the <b>helmet</b> <b>shell,</b> the fabric cover is then steamed and stretched tightly over the shell to prevent buckling. A wooden tool is carefully used to smooth away any air bubbles as well as to ensure the fabric cover is in full contact with the helmet shell; excess fabric is cut away.|$|E

50|$|Echinometra lucunter {{uses the}} teeth that {{surround}} its mouth to grind {{away at the}} rock underneath it {{so as to make}} a hemispherical depression in which it takes refuge during the day. It emerges at night to graze on algae growing within a few centimetres (inches) of its home. It defends this hole against other sea urchins of its own species. The king <b>helmet</b> <b>shell</b> (Cassis tuberosa) feeds on it and several species of small goby conceal themselves underneath its test.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{design for the}} M1 helmet {{was approved by the}} United States military on June 9th, 1941. The <b>helmet</b> <b>shell,</b> known as the Hadfield manganese steel helmet, was first manufactured by the McCord Radiator Company, whereas the fiber liner interior was designed and produced by Hawley Products Company. The purpose of the Hawley liner was to serve as a cushion between the wearer and the steel shell. The fiber material interior consisted of a finished green cardboard, with an interior suspension. The interior suspension was shaped as a webbed crossing pattern.|$|E
50|$|The M1942 {{design was}} a result of wartime demands. The rolled edge on the shell was eliminated, {{creating}} an unfinished edge along the rim. This edge slightly flared out, along the base of the skirt. The elimination of the rolled edge expedited the manufacturing process and reduced the amount of metal used in each <b>helmet.</b> <b>Shell</b> paint colors were typically matte gray-green (Heer) or gray-blue (Luftwaffe), and the decals were eliminated in 1943 to speed up production and reduce the helmet's combat visibility. Greater manufacturing flaws were also observed in M1942 helmets made late in the war.|$|E
50|$|A {{hard hat}} {{is a type}} of helmet {{predominantly}} used in workplace environments such as industrial or construction sites to protect the head from injury due to falling objects, impact with other objects, debris, rain, and electric shock. Suspension bands inside the helmet spreads the helmet's weight and the force of any impact {{over the top of the}} head. A suspension also provides space of approximately 30 mm (1.2 inch) between the <b>helmet's</b> <b>shell</b> and the wearer's head, so that if an object strikes the shell, the impact is less likely to be transmitted directly to the skull. Some <b>helmet</b> <b>shells</b> have a mid-line reinforcement ridge to improve impact resistance. The rock climbing helmet fulfills a very similar role in a different context and has a very similar design.|$|R
50|$|The {{length of}} the shell varies between 50 mm and 410 mm. It is the largest of all <b>helmet</b> <b>shells.</b> It has a very solid, heavy, rotund shell with large, horn-like knobs and a wide, flat base. The shell has a dorsally pale orange colour, its base vivid orange, faintly marked with white and brown.|$|R
50|$|Finally, {{gastropods}} with a {{determinate growth}} pattern may create a single and terminal lip structure when approaching maturity, after which growth ceases. These include the cowries (Cypraeidae) and <b>helmet</b> <b>shells</b> (Cassidae), both with in-turned lips, the true conchs (Strombidae) that develop flaring lips, and many land snails that develop tooth structures or constricted apertures upon reaching full size.|$|R
5000|$|Conch shells {{have also}} been used as {{primitive}} instruments since Neolithic times, and must be numbered among the antecedents of the natural trumpet. The four shells most commonly {{used for this purpose}} are the triton or trumpet shell, the cassis or <b>helmet</b> <b>shell,</b> the fusus, and the strombus or true conch, though the term [...] "conch-shell trumpet" [...] is generally applied to all instruments of this type. The spiral interior of the shell acts as tubing, and a mouthhole is created either by breaking off the point of the shell (end-blown conch) or by boring a small hole in the body (side-blown conch). The cassis is an end-blown shell; the other three types are usually side-blown.|$|E
50|$|Whereas the PASGT <b>helmet</b> <b>shell</b> is olive drab, the LWH is coyote {{brown and}} can be fitted with cloth helmet covers, either {{originally}} made for the PASGT or more commonly those made for the LWH in desert and woodland MARPAT, {{as well as a}} mounting bracket on the front for any sort of night vision device, such as the AN/PVS-7 night vision goggle or AN/PVS-14 monocular night vision device (MNVD). Marines currently can be issued with a sling suspension or a pad suspension to fit the inside of the helmet to the head. A nape protection system adds ballistic protection {{to the rear of the}} head was also added as to reduce strain and improve comfort to the back of the neck.|$|E
50|$|The helmet fitting process starts by {{measuring}} the player's head with calipers. Based on measurements taken, a <b>helmet</b> <b>shell</b> of the appropriate size and style is chosen. Then, padding is added {{to ensure that the}} helmet fits the player's head. Padding consists of both foam rubber pads and inflatable (air) pads. Both the top and side padding include inflatable bladders that customize the fit. Once the helmet is in place on the player's head, the inflater bulb is applied to two points {{on the outside of the}} helmet. The jaw pads are fitted to ensure that the lower part of the helmet is snug against the player's face. The helmets that most NFL teams use are remarkably light, and once the pads are in place, there is no movement or shifting on the player's head.|$|E
50|$|In the mid 18th century, explorations {{revealed}} new <b>shell</b> varieties. <b>Helmet</b> <b>shells</b> (Cassis tuberosa) {{from the}} West Indies, and queen conch shells (Eustrombus gigas) from the Bahamas and West Indies, arrived in Europe. This sparked a big {{increase in the}} number of cameos that were carved from shells. Conch shells carve very well, but their color fades over time.|$|R
40|$|Jockeys {{are exposed}} to high risk of head {{injuries}} while riding. Therefore, helmets are vital for protection. Carbon fibre is widely used in sports technology due to its mechanical properties. Applying carbon fibre in jockey <b>helmet</b> <b>shells</b> could decrease the risk of fatal head injuries. The {{aim of the research}} was to investigate the safety performance of jockey <b>helmet</b> <b>shells</b> made out of carbon fibre. Four different shell types were produced with the same prepreg material. They differ in the number of layers (four or five) and patterns (two and four). Peak deceleration was used to compare the different type of shells through 2 -wire drop tests. Gaussian and Mean curvatures of the impact sites were also measured to obtain {{a better understanding of the}} impact behaviour.

5000|$|In 2009, {{as part of}} the NFL's {{celebration of}} the 50th season for the {{original}} eight teams of the American Football League, the Jets wore their blue Titans uniforms in a home game against the Tennessee Titans, who dressed as the 1960 Houston Oilers, on September 27, 2009. The Jets also introduced a white-jersey version of the Titans throwbacks, with navy blue numerals and navy and gold shoulder stripes. The Jets wore these against the Raiders in Oakland on October 25, 2009, and again against the Miami Dolphins at home on November 1. [...] Throughout the 2009 season, the Jets' jerseys featured their 50th anniversary patch; the Titans throwbacks also bore a commemorative AFL patch. Those throwbacks did not make an appearance in 2010 but were re-introduced a year later for a home game against the Jacksonville Jaguars. Since then the NFL has adopted a [...] "one-helmet" [...] rule as part of its concussion protocol, which precludes teams from using [...] "throwback" [...] helmets requiring a different-colored <b>helmet</b> <b>shell.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract. At {{the present}} there exist two {{different}} types of riot helmet shells, a thermoplastic and a composite shell. The composite shell is believed to be superior in impact performance, but more expensive and complicated in manufacturing partially {{due to the fact that}} the textile reinforcement material has to be cut into pattern pieces before they can be applied to the helmet shaped mould. However, the discontinuation of fibres is likely to reduce the level of protection and shorten the lifetime of a helmet. The aim of this research is to develop a <b>helmet</b> <b>shell</b> consisting of a single-piece of fabric without creating wrinkles and without the necessity of cutting the fabric. For this purpose, a new type of woven fabric has been developed and an apparatus has been set up to drape the fabric to a <b>helmet</b> <b>shell.</b> The <b>helmet</b> <b>shell</b> was manufactured using a single piece of Kevlar woven fabric. In parallel the finite element method is applied to investigate the shock absorption behaviour of the <b>helmet</b> <b>shell</b> made from both multi-piece and single-piece fabric reinforcements. The results show clearly the advantage of the single-piece <b>helmet</b> <b>shell</b> over its existing multi-piece counterpart...|$|E
40|$|The present {{research}} aims {{to develop a}} novel technique for creation of composite riot helmet shells with reinforcing fibre continuity for better protection against low velocity impacts. In this research an innovative, simple and effective method of making a single-piece continuously textile reinforced <b>helmet</b> <b>shell</b> by vacuum bagging has been established and discussed. This technique also includes the development of solid collapsible moulding apparatus from non-woven fibres. Angle-interlock fabric due to its good mouldability, low shear rigidity and ease of production is used in this research. Several wrinkle-free single- piece composite helmet shells have been manufactured. Low-velocity impact test on the continuously reinforced helmet shells has been carried out. For this purpose an in-house <b>helmet</b> <b>shell</b> testing facility has been developed. Test rig has been designed {{in such a way}} that the impact test can be carried out at different locations at the riot <b>helmet</b> <b>shell.</b> Low-velocity impact test has been successfully conducted on the developed test rig. The practical experimentation and analysis revealed that the <b>helmet</b> <b>shell</b> performance against impact is dependent on the impact location. The <b>helmet</b> <b>shell</b> top surface has better impact protection as compared to <b>helmet</b> <b>shell</b> side and back location. Moreover, the <b>helmet</b> <b>shell</b> side is the most at risk location for the wearer. Finite Element models were created and simulated in Abaqus software to investigate the impact performance of single-piece helmet shells at different impact locations. Models parts have been designed in Rhinoceros software. Simulated results are validated by the experimental result which shows that the helmet top position is the safest position against an impact when it is compared to helmet back and helmet side positions.
