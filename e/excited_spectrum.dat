40|$|A {{detailed}} {{comparison of}} the surface sensitivity of x-ray photoemission spectroscopy for hard and soft x rays is presented and discussed. Electron scattering parameters and their energy dependence are given for Si and two Si spectra are analyzed: a Mg K alpha (h nu= 1253. 6 eV) <b>excited</b> <b>spectrum</b> of the Si 2 p and 2 s lines and a hard x-ray <b>excited</b> <b>spectrum</b> (h nu= 5925 eV) of the Si 1 s line. The differential inelastic scattering characteristics for Si are extracted from reflection electron energy loss spectra taken at energies of 1500 and 4000 eV. Using these scattering characteristics and electron mean free paths from the literature, simulated spectra are compared with experiment. The experimental spectra are deconvoluted to give the true intrinsic line shape corresponding to the theoretical collision statistics when interference effects between intrinsic and extrinsic scattering are neglected. The magnitude of interference effects cannot be assessed by our analysis. Within the (unknown) uncertainty introduced by neglecting interference effects, {{it is possible to}} determine the relative intensity of intrinsic and extrinsic excitations. In this way, it is found {{that in the case of}} the soft x-ray excited photoelectron spectrum of the shallower electronic shells (2 p and 2 s), intrinsic plasmon creation is rather weak, and the apparent asymmetric line shape of the spectrum might be interpreted as the fact that electron-hole pair creation dominates the intrinsic loss spectrum, while an alternative explanation in terms of surface core level shifted components is also proposed. For the deeper core electronic shell, probed with hard x rays, the opposite situation is observed: while intrinsic electron-hole pair creation was not observed, a strong contribution of intrinsic plasmon losses of about 30 % was seen...|$|E

30|$|To promote {{photocatalytic}} oxidation of As(III) by TiO 2 materials under visible light, Pt/TiO 2 nanotubes {{were introduced}} via a constant current deposition method.

40|$|A {{distinct}} {{feature of}} Coulomb gauge QCD {{is that it}} can be formulated in terms of physical, transverse gluons and quarks alone. The state-counting is then transparent, and the gauge is suited for studies of the <b>excited</b> <b>spectrum.</b> Leaving aside exotic spectroscopy, which {{has been the subject of}} other publications, in this note I call attention on two recent applications. One is that the running quark mass in the mid-infrared can be probed from excited baryons thanks to parity doubling, a consequence of insensitivity to chiral symmetry breaking. Fast quarks are asymptotically free and behave as massless, so hadrons containing fast quarks decouple from the condensate. Their (power-law) rate of decoupling reflects on the rate of decreasing parity splittings, which can be measured. The second is that, in analogy with the Franck-Condon principle of molecular physics, the velocity distribution of the heavy quarks inside a heavy hadron can be mapped out by the velocity distribution of its open-flavor decay products. This is exemplified by recent data from the Belle collaboration taken at the Upsilon(10860).

40|$|Lattice {{simulation}} data on {{the critical}} temperature and long-distance potential, that probe the degrees of freedom of the QCD string, are critically reviewed. It is emphasized that comparison of experimental or SU(N_c) lattice data, at finite number of colors N_c, with free string theory can be misleading due to string interactions. Large-N_c extrapolation of pure lattice gauge theory data, in both 3 and 4 dimensions, indicates {{that there are more}} worldsheet degrees of freedom than the purely massless transverse ones of the free Nambu-Goto string. The extra variables are consistent with massive modes of oscillation that effectively contribute like c ~ 1 / 2 conformal degrees of freedom to highly excited states. As a concrete example, the highly <b>excited</b> <b>spectrum</b> of the Chodos-Thorn relativistic string in 1 + 1 dimensions is analyzed, where there are no transverse oscillations. It is found that the asymptotic density of states for this model is characteristic of a c= 1 / 2 conformal worldsheet theory.
