5|$|Historians {{generally}} {{agree that}} a dramatic reduction in the overall size of the Congolese population occurred during the two-decades of Free State rule in the Congo. Populations always fluctuate over time and notable shifts, known as demographic crises, are well-attested in pre-industrial societies. Noted examples include the Spanish colonisation of the Americas.

5|$|Cancers can {{be induced}} in animals at many sites. At {{sufficiently}} high doses TCDD has caused cancer in all animals tested. The most sensitive is liver cancer in female rats, {{and this has}} long been a basis for risk assessment. Dose-response of TCDD in causing cancer {{does not seem to be}} linear, and there is a threshold below which it seems to cause no cancer. TCDD is not mutagenic or genotoxic, in other words, it is not able to initiate cancer, and the cancer risk is based on promotion of cancer initiated by other compounds or on <b>indirect</b> <b>effects</b> such as disturbing defense mechanisms of the body e.g. by preventing apoptosis or programmed death of altered cells. Carcinogenicity is associated with tissue damage, and it is often viewed now as secondary to tissue damage.|$|E

40|$|The most {{commonly}} used method to test an <b>indirect</b> <b>effect</b> is to divide the estimate of the <b>indirect</b> <b>effect</b> by its standard error and compare the resulting z statistic with a critical value from the standard normal distribution. Confidence limits for the <b>indirect</b> <b>effect</b> are also typically based on critical values from the standard normal distribution. This article uses a simulation study to demonstrate that confidence limits are imbalanced because {{the distribution of the}} <b>indirect</b> <b>effect</b> is normal only in special cases. Two alternatives for improving the performance of confidence limits for the <b>indirect</b> <b>effect</b> are evaluated: (a) a method based on the distribution of the product of two normal random variables, and (b) resampling methods.

5|$|The {{most notable}} {{tropical}} cyclone {{of the year}} was Hurricane Isis, which killed fourteen people when it made landfall on southern Baja California Sur and coastal Sinaloa in Mexico. Isis caused considerable damage in the nation while destroying more than 700 homes and damaging dozens of cars.

In addition to Isis, Tropical Storm Javier moved ashore the coast of Jalisco in Mexico; the nation experienced <b>indirect</b> <b>effects</b> from four other storms, all of which remained offshore.

5|$|The main factor {{behind the}} Finnish Civil War was World War I; the Russian Empire {{collapsed}} under {{the pressures of}} the war, leading to the February and October Revolutions in 1917. The breakdown caused a large power vacuum and subsequent power struggle in Eastern Europe. The Grand Duchy of Finland, a part of the Russian Empire since 1809, became embroiled in the struggle for power. Geopolitically less important than the continental Moscow-Warsaw gateway, the northerly Finnish ground, isolated by the Baltic sea was a peaceful sidefront until early 1918.

Residing in a relatively productive industry in a given country entails a key tension: any firm in the industry {{is likely to be}} relatively productive but so are its peer firms and domestic competitors in export markets. We decompose the effect of industry productivity on export performance into a positive direct effect of own firm productivity and an <b>indirect</b> <b>effect</b> of higher peer firm productivity and ask whether this <b>indirect</b> <b>effect</b> is negative, zero, or positive. In a sample of Chilean and Colombian plants, we find evidence of both a positive direct effect and a negative <b>indirect</b> <b>effect.</b> We also show both theoretically and empirically that industry level Ricardian predictions hold as the direct <b>effect</b> dominates the <b>indirect</b> <b>effect.</b> Empirical evidence suggests that industry-specific factors of production and asymmetric substitutability between domestic and foreign varieties drive this negative <b>indirect</b> <b>effect...</b>|$|R

40|$|It is {{generally}} believed that {{increases in the}} atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases {{as a result of}} man's activities are leading to global warming.

Corruption may affect this relationship in two distinct ways: by raising pollution at given income levels (direct effect) and by reducing per capita income (<b>indirect</b> <b>effect).</b> The total effect is ambiguous a priori. Using cross section data for several indicators of pollution, the paper estimates the direct and the <b>indirect</b> <b>effect</b> of corruption on pollution. The <b>indirect</b> <b>effect</b> via income is positive or negative depending on the income level. If negative, the <b>indirect</b> <b>effect</b> is dominated by the positive direct effect. Overall, our measures of pollution are monotonically increasing in corruption. Because this relationship is particularly strong at low income levels, developing countries can considerably improve both their economic and environmental performance by reducing corruption. corruption, growth, pollution, environmental Kuznets curve...|$|R

Insulin appears to affect both glucokinase transcription and activity through multiple direct and indirect pathways. While rising portal vein glucose levels increase glucokinase activity, the concomitant rise of insulin amplifies this effect by induction of glucokinase synthesis.

Glucokinase transcription becomes nearly undetectable in prolonged starvation, severe carbohydrate deprivation, or untreated insulin-deficient diabetes.|$|E
