During the 1945–62 period at House and Garden, the magazine published more than 3,000 of his photographs, and he created a high reputation in the industry.

5|$|After the Sunday rest day, Australia resumed with a lead of 478 {{runs and}} six wickets in hand. The morning was punctuated by three rain stoppages, which {{increased}} England's chances of saving the game. Just ten {{minutes after the}} start of the day's play, heavy rain intervened. The weather cleared and Miller and Brown moved to lunch on 63 and 32 respectively, having advanced Australia to 409/4. Miller was given a life before lunch when he hit a ball high into the air; Dollery stood right under it and had ample time to prepare, but dropped the catch. In 88 minutes of play, Australia added a further 66 runs. During this time, the third new ball became available, but England opted not to use it immediately, as the wet and slippery ground had made it hard for the bowlers to grip the ball or run up to the crease with confidence; the hosts instead waited for drier conditions so they could <b>exercise</b> <b>more</b> control over the ball. However, after a period of using his slower bowlers, Yardley opted to take the new ball, and Miller hit three boundaries to pass 50, and both batsmen lifted their rate of scoring. It appeared that aside from the need to score quickly in preparation for the declaration, both players found the new ball easier to see than its muddied predecessor. Miller hooked Coxon repeatedly, and drove Bedser for many runs. Bradman was expected to declare just before lunch so he could attack the English openers for a short period before the adjournment, but a shower at this time deterred him from doing so, as his bowlers would have struggled to grip the ball; Lindwall had also been injured on a slippery surface in earlier times.|$|E

25|$|Baptists welcomed African Americans, both {{slave and}} free, {{allowing}} them to have more active roles in ministry than did other denominations by licensing them as preachers and, in some cases, {{allowing them to}} be treated as equals to white members. As a result, black congregations and churches were founded in Virginia, South Carolina, and Georgia before the American Revolution. Some black congregations kept their independence even after whites tried to <b>exercise</b> <b>more</b> authority after the Nat Turner slave rebellion of 1831.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, the Quarter's cheap rents and air of decay {{attracted}} a bohemian artistic community, a trend which became {{pronounced in the}} 1920s. Many of these new inhabitants were active in the first preservation efforts in the Quarter, which began around that time. As a result, the Vieux Carré Commission (VCC) was established in 1925. Although initially only an advisory body, a 1936 referendum to amend the Louisiana constitution afforded it a measure of regulatory power. It began to <b>exercise</b> <b>more</b> power in the 1940s to preserve and protect the district.|$|E
25|$|The {{state of}} obesity clearly {{contributes}} to insulin resistance, {{which in turn}} can cause type 2 diabetes. Virtually all obese and most type 2 diabetic individuals have marked insulin resistance. Although the association between overweight and insulin resistance is clear, the exact (likely multifarious) causes of insulin resistance remain less clear. It {{is important to note}} that it has been demonstrated that appropriate <b>exercise,</b> <b>more</b> regular food intake, and reducing glycemic load (see below) all can reverse insulin resistance in overweight individuals (and thereby lower their blood sugar level, in those with type 2 diabetes).|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the technical investigation, {{the selection of the}} flight route was also investigated by the DSB. There were 61 flight operators from 32 countries who flew over eastern Ukraine {{at the time of the}} crash, who believed it was safe to fly there at cruising altitude. In the DSB's opinion, there was sufficient reason to fully close the airspace over eastern Ukraine as a precaution. The DSB recommended that states involved in armed conflicts should <b>exercise</b> <b>more</b> caution when evaluating their airspace, and operators should more thoroughly assess the risks when selecting routes over conflict areas.|$|E
25|$|A typical pommel horse {{exercise}} involves both single leg {{and double}} leg work. Single leg skills are generally {{found in the}} form of scissors, an element often done on the pommels. Double leg work however, is the main staple of this event. The gymnast swings both legs in a circular motion (clockwise or counterclockwise depending on preference) and performs such skills on all parts of the apparatus. To make the <b>exercise</b> <b>more</b> challenging, gymnasts will often include variations on a typical circling skill by turning (moores and spindles) or by straddling their legs (Flares). Routines end when the gymnast performs a dismount, either by swinging his body over the horse, or landing after a handstand variation.|$|E
25|$|Another area {{of leisure}} {{activity}} on the Internet is multiplayer gaming. This form of recreation creates communities, where {{people of all ages}} and origins enjoy the fast-paced world of multiplayer games. These range from MMORPG to first-person shooters, from role-playing video games to online gambling. While online gaming has been around since the 1970s, modern modes of online gaming began with subscription services such as GameSpy and MPlayer. Non-subscribers were limited to certain types of game play or certain games. Many people use the Internet to access and download music, movies and other works for their enjoyment and relaxation. Free and fee-based services exist for all of these activities, using centralized servers and distributed peer-to-peer technologies. Some of these sources <b>exercise</b> <b>more</b> care with respect to the original artists' copyrights than others.|$|E

Lisa suggests that Marge take a painting class at Springfield Community College, which she does. She makes a painting of Homer on the couch in his underwear, which her professor, Lombardo, praises. The painting wins the college art show, thus gaining her fame and the headlines of the newspapers.|$|E
500|$|After Richard was freed, {{he spent}} {{little time in}} England, instead concentrating on the war with King Philip II of France, which began with Philip's {{attempts}} to acquire Richard's possessions on the continent. Richard made Walter Chief Justiciar about 25 December 1193. Walter remained in England, raising money for the king's wars and overseeing {{the administration of the}} kingdom. The constant warfare forced Walter to find new means of raising money through taxation. The historian Doris Stenton wrote that the Pipe Rolls, or financial records, during Walter's time as justiciar [...] "give the impression of a country taxed to the limit". Walter was also responsible for choosing royal justices, and many of his choices were connected with, or had previously worked with, the archbishop in the royal administration. Because of Richard's absence from England, Walter was able to <b>exercise</b> <b>more</b> authority as justiciar than any of his predecessors. All that Walter needed to do was keep Richard's monetary needs satisfied. Combined with Walter's position as archbishop, Walter wielded a power unseen in England since the days of Lanfranc.|$|E
500|$|Although Chapman {{lost the}} England {{captaincy}} after the South African tour, he became official captain of Kent in 1931, having previously captained the side occasionally. Wisden commented that Chapman [...] "exercised an invigorating influence" [...] on the side. Before Chapman assumed the Kent captaincy, the county team was sharply divided along social {{lines and the}} amateur leadership was aloof from and often dismissive of the professional players. Members of the team felt that he improved the atmosphere within the side and made the game enjoyable. Critics and players {{thought that he was}} past his best by the time he became captain, and already affected by alcoholism, but Chapman was successful as leader. His fielding remained influential. However, his batting form was poor: in 1931, he scored 662 runs at an average of 18.38. Sections of the press thought he should remain England captain, but he was replaced as Test captain by Jardine, who was not a popular choice; the selectors chose Jardine to <b>exercise</b> <b>more</b> discipline on the team than Chapman had done. At the end of the season, Chapman toured Jamaica in a team captained by Lord Tennyson and scored 203 runs in first-class matches at 33.83.|$|E

500|$|He {{supported}} Washington's policies {{by casting}} 29 tie-breaking votes. In doing so, he protected the president's sole {{authority over the}} removal of appointees and influenced {{the location of the}} nation's capital. But his views did not always align with Washington, who joined Franklin as the object of Adams' ire, as shown in this quote: [...] "The History of our Revolution will be one continued lie[...] [...] [...] The essence of the whole will be that Dr. Franklin's electrical Rod smote the Earth and out sprung General Washington. That Franklin electrified him with his Rod – and henceforth these two conducted all the Policy, Negotiations, Legislatures and War." [...] On at least one occasion, he persuaded senators to vote against legislation that he opposed, and he frequently lectured the Senate on procedural and policy matters. Adams' political views and his attempt to assume {{a more active role in}} the Senate made him a natural target for critics of the Washington administration. Toward the end of his first term, as a result of a threatened resolution that would have silenced him except for procedural and policy matters, he began to <b>exercise</b> <b>more</b> restraint. When the nation's first two opposing political parties formed, he joined the Federalist Party, though he was consistently in opposition to its dominant leader Alexander Hamilton.|$|E
