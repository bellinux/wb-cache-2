5|$|Cliff Lee {{pitched a}} {{complete}} {{game in the}} Phillies' Game1 victory, allowing only one unearned run, while Chase Utley hit two home runs. In Game2, solo home runs by Mark Teixeira and Hideki Matsui helped the Yankees win by a score of 3–1. After a rain <b>delayed</b> <b>start,</b> Game3 featured more offense, with a combined six home runs and thirteen total runs {{en route to a}} Yankee victory. The Yankees won Game4 by scoring the decisive three runs in the ninth inning after an alert base running play by Johnny Damon. The Phillies avoided elimination with a win in Game5, aided by Utley's second two–home run game of the series. The Yankees secured their World Series championship with a Game 6 victory in which Matsui hit his third home run of the series. He was named Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the series, making him the first Japanese-born player and the first full-time designated hitter to win the award; Matsui was the series' MVP despite starting only the three games that were played at Yankee Stadium, since the designated hitter position is not used in NL ballparks.|$|E
5|$|The {{meeting at}} Aintree had been beset by {{problems}} before the race. Fifteen animal rights protesters invaded the course near the first fence (as had also {{happened at the}} 1991 Grand National) resulting in a <b>delayed</b> <b>start.</b> A first false start was caused by several riders becoming tangled in the starting tape. Starter Keith Brown, who was officiating his last National before retirement, waved his red recall flag and a second official, Ken Evans, who was situated 100 yards further down the track, in turn signalled to the leading runners to turn around. At the second attempt, the tape became tangled again — {{around the neck of}} jockey Richard Dunwoody — and Brown called another false start. However, this time his recall flag did not unfurl as he waved it. As a result, 30 of the 39 riders set off around the track, oblivious to the recall.|$|E
5|$|With {{the series}} already lost, the England {{selectors}} {{continued to make}} many changes, on this occasion, four. In all, they had used 21 players for the series and were severely criticised for failing to maintain continuity. England captain Norman Yardley won the toss, and elected to bat on a pitch affected by rain. After a <b>delayed</b> <b>start</b> due to inclement weather, the Australian pace attack, led by Ray Lindwall, dismissed England within the first day for just 52. Lindwall was the main destroyer, taking six wickets for 20 runs (6/20). The English batsmen {{found it difficult to}} cope with his prodigious swing and pace; four of his wickets were either bowled or leg before wicket. Len Hutton was the only batsman to resist, making 30 before being the final man dismissed. In reply, Australia's opening pair of Arthur Morris and Sid Barnes passed England's score on the same afternoon with no loss of wickets. The opening stand ended at 117 when Barnes fell for 61 and Bradman came to the crease to a standing ovation and three cheers from his opponents. He fell second ball, but Australia reached 153/2 at stumps on the first day.|$|E

25|$|Wilson {{began reading}} at age ten; the <b>delayed</b> <b>start</b> was {{possibly}} caused by dyslexia. He later blamed {{the lack of}} schools in the postbellum South.

25|$|At Old Trafford, Somerset won the toss {{and elected}} to field on a seaming pitch after a <b>delayed</b> <b>start.</b> Mal Loye {{was the only}} Lancastrian to score a half-century, as Somerset {{made the most of}} the conditions.

25|$|The <b>delayed</b> <b>start</b> to the season, and {{absence of}} {{established}} international players during international Test and Six Nations windows, arguably gave some advantage to 'lesser' teams, and Connacht, coached by Pat Lam, duly {{led the league}} {{for much of the}} season. Despite not ultimately finishing top of the league, they converted their form into a maiden championship title in the post-league play-off matches, including a home semi-final victory over reigning champions Glasgow Warriors, and the Pro12 Final against league-topping Leinster at the neutral venue of the BT Sport Murrayfield stadium in Edinburgh.|$|E

50|$|The SSR-1 of {{the project}} {{suffered}} several <b>delays</b> <b>start,</b> either by lack of resources, whether by barriers in the disputes of the bids.

25|$|Odell {{discovered}} {{the first evidence}} which might reveal something about the climb of Mallory and Irvine among the equipment in camps V and VI. In addition to Mallory's compass, which normally was a critical component for climbing activities, he discovered some oxygen bottles and spare parts. This situation suggests {{the possibility that there}} had been a problem with the oxygen equipment which might have caused a <b>delayed</b> <b>start</b> in the morning. A hand-generator electric lamp also remained in the tent – it was still in working order when it was found by the Ruttledge expedition nine years later.|$|E
25|$|Milligan {{returned}} to jazz {{in the late}} 1940s and made a precarious living with the Hall trio and other musical comedy acts. He was also trying {{to break into the}} world of radio, as a performer or script writer. His first success in radio was as writer for comedian Derek Roy's show. After a <b>delayed</b> <b>start,</b> Milligan, Peter Sellers, Harry Secombe and Michael Bentine joined forces in a relatively radical comedy project, The Goon Show. During its first season the BBC titled the show as Crazy People, or in full, The Junior Crazy Gang featuring those Crazy People, the Goons!, an attempt to make the programme palatable to BBC officials, by connecting it with the popular group of theatre comedians known as The Crazy Gang.|$|E
25|$|Parma then {{returned}} home to Italy and hosted La Liga side Levante at the Tardini following the annual presentation of the players to the fans on 12 August. Graziano Pellè's only goal of the game meant the home fans went home happy as Parma geared up for the new season. Six days later, a triangular tournament was contested in Salsomaggiore Terme (in the Province of Parma) between Parma and lower league sides Salsomaggiore and Fidenza Calcio with each match lasting only 45 minutes; Parma won both matches, beating Fidenza 1–0 and Salsomaggiore 3–0. Parma's final warm-up before the new season {{was supposed to be}} two matches on 25 August against the club's Allievi Nazionali (which was just a single-half affair) and local side Pro Desenzano (which the club both won comfortably by seven goals to nil and six goals to three, respectively), but the <b>delayed</b> <b>start</b> of Serie A due to a players' strike meant a friendly was played on Saturday 27 August against Carpenedolo; Parma won 7–0. Parma also played Mantova and Crociati Noceto in September to give fringe players more game time, winning both matches comfortably to nil.|$|E

500|$|Otay Mesa Road was widened to six lanes in 2000, {{at a cost}} of $20.5million. Before, it had 50percent more traffic than it was {{designed}} to handle; it was considered by the San Diego Union-Tribune as [...] "California's busiest trade route with Mexico", and traffic had increased by a factor of ten, with the number of people dying in traffic accidents approaching five times the state average. The widening of Otay Mesa Road was considered a temporary fix for the problem. The next year, the California Transportation Commission allocated $25million of state funding towards completing the freeway. The interchange with Siempre Viva Road opened on December 8, 2004. Delays in the U.S. Congress approving federal funding in 2005 resulted in a <b>delayed</b> <b>start</b> to construction for the rest of SR905.|$|E
