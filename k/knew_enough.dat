He was prescribed a course of antidepressants, but felt uncomfortable and embarrassed about taking them, and tried {{to hide the fact}} from his friends. He <b>knew</b> <b>enough</b> about drugs to worry about their side effects, and was concerned about how they would react with his regular cannabis use.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1880s, Wallace was {{drawn into the}} debate over {{mandatory}} smallpox vaccination. Wallace originally saw the issue {{as a matter of}} personal liberty; but, after studying some of the statistics provided by anti-vaccination activists, he began to question the efficacy of vaccination. At the time, the germ theory of disease was very new and far from universally accepted. Moreover, no one <b>knew</b> <b>enough</b> about the human immune system to understand why vaccination worked. When Wallace did some research, he discovered instances where supporters of vaccination had used questionable, in a few cases completely phony, statistics to support their arguments. Always suspicious of authority, Wallace suspected that physicians had a vested interest in promoting vaccination, and became convinced that reductions in the incidence of smallpox that had been attributed to vaccination were, in fact, due to better hygiene and improvements in public sanitation.|$|E
5|$|Bede's best-known {{work is the}} Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum, or An Ecclesiastical History of the English People, {{completed}} in about 731. Bede was aided in writing this book by Albinus, abbot of St Augustine's Abbey, Canterbury. The first of the five books begins with some geographical background, and then sketches the history of England, beginning with Caesar's invasion in 55 BC. A brief account of Christianity in Roman Britain, including the martyrdom of St Alban, {{is followed by the}} story of Augustine's mission to England in 597, which brought Christianity to the Anglo-Saxons. The second book begins with the death of Gregory the Great in 604, and follows the further progress of Christianity in Kent and the first attempts to evangelise Northumbria. These ended in disaster when Penda, the pagan king of Mercia, killed the newly Christian Edwin of Northumbria at the Battle of Hatfield Chase in about 632. The setback was temporary, and the third book recounts the growth of Christianity in Northumbria under kings Oswald of Northumbria and Oswy. The climax of the third book is the account of the Council of Whitby, traditionally seen as a major turning point in English history. The fourth book begins with the consecration of Theodore as Archbishop of Canterbury, and recounts Wilfrid's efforts to bring Christianity to the kingdom of Sussex. The fifth book brings the story up to Bede's day, and includes an account of missionary work in Frisia, and of the conflict with the British church over the correct dating of Easter. Bede wrote a preface for the work, in which he dedicates it to Ceolwulf, king of Northumbria. The preface mentions that Ceolwulf received an earlier draft of the book; presumably Ceolwulf <b>knew</b> <b>enough</b> Latin to understand it, and he may even have been able to read it. The preface makes it clear that Ceolwulf had requested the earlier copy, and Bede had asked for Ceolwulf's approval; this correspondence with the king indicates that Bede's monastery had excellent connections among the Northumbrian nobility.|$|E

25|$|Blake started {{engraving}} {{copies of}} drawings of Greek antiquities purchased {{for him by}} his father, a practice that was preferred to actual drawing. Within these drawings Blake found his first exposure to classical forms through the work of Raphael, Michelangelo, Maarten van Heemskerck and Albrecht Dürer. The number of prints and bound books that James and Catherine were able to purchase for young William suggests that the Blakes enjoyed, {{at least for a}} time, a comfortable wealth. When William was ten years old, his parents <b>knew</b> <b>enough</b> of his headstrong temperament that he was not sent to school but instead enrolled in drawing classes at Pars's drawing school in the Strand. He read avidly on subjects of his own choosing. During this period, Blake made explorations into poetry; his early work displays knowledge of Ben Jonson, Edmund Spenser, and the Psalms.|$|E
25|$|If Campese wanted to, I am sure {{he could}} have sprinted for the corner and scored the try. Instead, he ran {{straight}} at Ackerman. The Welshman obviously <b>knew</b> <b>enough</b> about Campese to realise it was useless to try and tackle him front-on. Instead, he did what I suggested earlier that any defender should do against Campese – he ran with him. It was then that Campese began to zigzag, forcing Ackerman to zigzag, too, looking over one shoulder after another to see which way Campese was heading. I was following about 20 metres behind and could not believe what was happening. I {{have no doubt that}} Campese turned it on to make a personal point with Ackerman. When the defence eventually closed in on him, Campese flicked a pass over his shoulder to Michael Hawker, who scored the try.|$|E

She continued to work in association with Pendlebury: in particular around Lasithi in central Crete. She excavated, helped publish, and also took opportunities to travel with Eccles.

Although Arthur Evans' visits to Knossos had become less frequent in the 1930s, he <b>knew</b> <b>enough</b> about her work to give her the role of organising the Knossos section of a London exhibition celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the British School, and of helping with a further display at the Ashmolean. He also used one of her drawings of a hoard of axes to illustrate his last work on the palace at Knossos.|$|E

500|$|The 23-year-old Yannis Alexis Mardas {{first arrived}} in England on a student visa in 1965, befriending John Dunbar of the Indica Gallery in London, and later moving in {{with him in a}} flat on Bentinck Street, which was where Mardas first met Lennon. Known at this time as Yannis Mardas, he found {{employment}} as a television repairman. Dunbar later introduced Mardas to Brian Jones, after Mardas exhibited his Kinetic Light Sculptures at the Indica Gallery. Dunbar worked with Mardas on the “psychedelic light box” for The Rolling Stones' three-week tour of Europe in 1967, although they were not impressed with the results. Dunbar later said: [...] "He was quite cunning in the way he pitched his thing. He <b>knew</b> <b>enough</b> to know how to wind people up and to what extent.

In 1726, his father left {{military}} service and moved the family to Schwedt, where he became a forestry master in East Prussia; the senior Seydlitz died in 1728, leaving a widow and children in restricted financial circumstances. Limited schooling was available to young Seydlitz; sources differ whether {{he knew how to}} speak and write in French, the lingua franca of Frederick the Great's Court. One biographer, Bernhard von Poten, maintained that his German was good, and if he knew French, he preferred German and wrote it with a [...] "fine, firm hand, unusually correct, in well-formed sentences and with apt expression," [...] and he <b>knew</b> <b>enough</b> Latin to express himself well.

"Draft Perot" [...] {{organizations}} opened {{throughout the}} nation, and petition drives were coordinated largely by Perot's friend Tom Luce, {{and the real}} estate arm of Perot Systems, to help secure {{a place for the}} candidate on every state ballot. At the height of the efforts, 18,000 simultaneous calls came into Perot's telephone banks after he appeared on the Phil Donahue Show. At one point, 30,000 telephone calls were received in one hour. MCI Communications Corporation reported that over a million calls came in during the first ten days that the phone banks were active. At the time, presidential polls showed Perot with 21% support from the electorate, 14 points behind likely Democratic presidential nominee Bill Clinton and 16 points behind President Bush. Despite this, only one third of potential voters <b>knew</b> <b>enough</b> about Perot to form an opinion of him.

500|$|Denning, {{along with}} his older brother Gordon, began his {{schooling}} at the National School of Whitchurch, one of many {{set up by the}} National Society for the Education of the Poor. Both boys won scholarships to Andover Grammar School, where Denning excelled academically, winning four prizes for English essays on the subjects of [...] "The Great Authors", [...] "Macaulay", [...] "Carlyle" [...] and [...] "Milton". The outbreak of the First World War saw most of the schoolmasters leave to join the British armed forces, being replaced by female teachers. At the time Denning wanted to become a mathematician, but none of the new teachers <b>knew</b> <b>enough</b> mathematics to teach him; instead, he taught himself. He qualified to study at University College, Southampton, but was advised to stay at school and apply to Oxford or Cambridge in a few years. He sat the Oxbridge examination when he was sixteen and was awarded a £30 a year exhibition to study mathematics at Magdalen College, Oxford; the money was not enough to live on, but he accepted nevertheless. Although he had been accepted by a college he still needed to gain entry to the university as a whole, which meant passing exams including Greek– which had not been taught at Andover Grammar School. Denning managed to teach himself enough of the subject to pass, and matriculated to Oxford in 1916.|$|E
500|$|I {{was visiting}} {{my friend and}} generous benefactor, Prof. Edward C. Pickering. With {{characteristic}} kindness, he had volunteered to have the spectra observed for all the stars—including comparison stars—which had been observed in the observations for stellar parallax which Hinks and I made at Cambridge, and I discussed. This piece of apparently routine work proved very fruitful—it led to the discovery that all the stars of very faint absolute magnitude were of spectral class M. In conversation on this subject (as I recall it), I asked Pickering about certain other faint stars, not on my list, mentioning in particular 40 Eridani B. Characteristically, he sent a note to the Observatory office and before long the answer came (I think from Mrs Fleming) that the spectrum of this star was A. I <b>knew</b> <b>enough</b> about it, even in these paleozoic days, to realize at once {{that there was an}} extreme inconsistency between what we would then have called [...] "possible" [...] values of the surface brightness and density. I must have shown that I was not only puzzled but crestfallen, at this exception to what looked like a very pretty rule of stellar characteristics; but Pickering smiled upon me, and said: [...] "It is just these exceptions that lead to an advance in our knowledge", and so the white dwarfs entered the realm of study! ...|$|E

500|$|One dispute {{among the}} founders of Century 21 – Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, Reg Hill and John Read – emerged from the filming of other scenes, {{including}} {{one in which the}} character of Lise Hartman bathes in a shower. Read, the director of photography, had complied with Parrish's instructions to light the sequence in silhouette. Anderson, who had intended the scene to display full-frontal nudity from actress Loni von Friedl, demanded a re-shoot, insisting that Read honour his obligations not just to Parrish as director but also to his Century 21 partners. According to Sylvia Anderson, [...] "Gerry was very keen to show that {{he was part of the}} 'Swinging Sixties' and felt that seeing a detailed nude shot – as he visualised it – was more 'with it' than the more subdued version." [...] Anderson clashed with Read and Parrish for a second time when special effects shots of Phoenix were filmed with a hand-held camera: [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>enough</b> about space travel to know that in a vacuum a spacecraft will travel as straight as a die... told me that people were not familiar with space travel and therefore they would expect to see this kind of movement." [...] Refusing to re-film the scenes on the basis that Parrish's instructions had precedence over Anderson's, Read resigned from both Century 21 and the production of Doppelgänger at the Andersons' and Hill's request. Anderson elaborated: [...] "Clearly John was in a difficult position. I do now understand how he must have felt, but in my heart I feel he couldn't play a double role." ...|$|E
