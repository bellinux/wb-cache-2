When Galloway leaks an intimate photo of Claire to appease his jealous fianceé, Claire intimidates him into publicly stating that he fabricated the picture, ruining his reputation. When Gillian Cole (Sandrine Holt), a pregnant former employee, returns to demand health care {{as part of her}} severance, Claire says, [...] "I am willing to let your child wither and die <b>inside</b> <b>you,</b> if that’s what’s required,...Am I really the sort of enemy you want to make?" [...] Claire also manipulates First Lady Patricia Walker (Joanna Going) into believing that her husband is having an affair in order to distract President Walker from Frank's machinations.|$|E

Arnold {{comments}} in the book Leaving Springfield that the episode is a satire on [...] "society's lazy, uninformed attitude about the electoral process", as well as [...] "a comment on the role in society of a cadre of elites (the Republican party) who see themselves as naturally suited to lead". The episode also portrays Republicans as willing {{to break the law}} in order to achieve this; in this case, Bob commits electoral fraud. This is most displayed in Bob's line: [...] "Your guilty conscience may force you to vote Democratic, but deep down <b>inside</b> <b>you</b> secretly long for a cold-hearted Republican to lower taxes, brutalize criminals, and rule you like a king. That's why I did this: to protect you from yourselves." ...|$|E

500|$|Director of {{photography}} Bill Roe later {{stated that he}} borrowed motifs from Steven Soderbergh's 2000 film Traffic {{for some of the}} shots. In addition, before filming, he decided to do various test shots to get the lighting right. The crew ended up shooting [...] "exteriors three, four stops over what you should shoot it at", resulting in very washed out outdoor scenes. Roe and his crew had a hard time developing the various lighting contrasts for the episode. When talking about the episode, Roe said: [...] "it was really dark so we had this huge contrast of lighting. It was dark and warm and brown. When you go <b>inside,</b> <b>you</b> can barely see things, but when you're outside, it's just blaring." [...] To create the Mexican town featured in the episode, scenes were filmed at a small town located outside of Los Angeles. A matte of the town's background and blue sky were then cut and a faux Mexican background was added. In addition, Mat Beck was given a flyer, and he duplicated it, making several strings of posters that did not exist when the shots were filmed.|$|E

[...] "Because of the high value of targets they have there – on a world scale, whether it be a drug cartel or terrorists – they are as concerned with someone trying to get in to break someone out as much as they are about inmates trying to escape. The protection around the prison is pretty remarkable." ...|$|E

2500|$|On Monday 29 June, in {{a replay}} of the {{military}} raids on the Jesuit radio station in El Progreso of the 1960s and 1970s, the Jesuits' progressive radio broadcasts were abruptly pulled off the air {{at four in the}} morning. On Sunday evening at 6pm, just an hour after the coup government's curfew began, a military contingent broke into Radio Progreso's headquarters. With guns pointed, they shouted: [...] "We’ve come to close down this piece of ****!" [...] One broadcaster locked himself in to keep broadcasting throughout the night. Shortly after, another military convoy stopped outside Radio Progreso. A group of soldiers approached the radio station’s guard and asked him if there were any people still working inside. When the guard said no, the soldier in charge told him: [...] "If we find someone <b>inside,</b> <b>you</b> will regret it." [...] And while the coup government, led by Roberto Micheletti, a native of El Progreso, threatened to shut down the station with violence, popular organisations resisting the undemocratic change in their government criticised the station for [...] "watering down" [...] its reporting of the tense and dynamic situation.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his book}} The Shape of the Signifier: 1967 to the End of History, Walter Benn Michaels {{considers}} the deeper theoretical implications of Stephenson's book. Comparing {{the book with}} a range of contemporary writers—the fiction of Bret Easton Ellis, Kathy Acker, Octavia Butler, and even Paul de Man and the literary criticism of Richard Rorty—Michaels criticizes the deep claims of Stephenson's book: [...] "And yet, in Snow Crash, the bodies of humans are affected by [...] "information" [...] they can't read; the virus, like the icepick , gets the words <b>inside</b> <b>you</b> even if you haven't read them." [...] Michaels especially targets Stephenson's view that [...] "languages are codes" [...] rather than a grouping of letters and sounds to be interpreted. Michaels further contends that this basic idea of language as code ("... a good deal of Snow Crashs plot depends upon eliding the distinction between hackers and their computers, as if—indeed, in the novel, just because—looking at code will do to the hacker what receiving it will do to the computer") aligns Stephenson, along with other writers mentioned, with a racially motivated view of culture: that culture is something transmitted and stored by blood (or genetic codes), and not by beliefs and practices.

2500|$|Uninterested in {{adopting}} others' opinions, with {{a penchant for}} discipline and thoroughness acquired in Germany, he became an adept of Stoicism, which accounts for his emphasis on ethical values, above all honesty. His devotion to honesty sometimes caused problems in social settings. Analyzing his style, particularly as found in his correspondence, philologist Cristina Florescu categorizes Philippide as a late Romantic, displaying [...] "impetuosity, idealism, a longing for a vanished time, imprudent and abrupt gestures", his flourishes meshing with his [...] "elevated consciousness of Romanian realities". She suggests that his spirit, in order to face a society he often shunned, took refuge in humor. His primary weapon was irony: [...] "whether acidic or gently sentimental, frequently hilarious but even more often stinging". His blend of satire, humor and irony made for a highly specific writing style. However, as argued by his friend Gheorghe T. Kirileanu, his speeches were uplifting, [...] "stirring up <b>inside</b> <b>you,</b> in the deepest parts of your soul, the pleasure to work and live." [...] According to Kirileanu, Philippide was cheereful only [...] "because he wants to make others happy"; his scatological jokes, however, were perfectly suited to annoy [...] "the delicate aristocrats", Simion Mehedinți and Matei B. Cantacuzino.|$|E
