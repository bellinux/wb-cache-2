We discuss below whether this increase is due to the “indirect effect” of the law that we seek to test. In regard to the covariates, it can be seen that the education level is higher after the passing of the law than before for non-mothers aged between 25 and 45. The proportion of non-mothers with university degree increases from 37.6  % in 1998 – 1999 to 52.4  % 3  years later. As mentioned before, such a big increase is mostly due to a methodological change introduced in 2000. As before, we have checked with different specifications on the <b>educational</b> <b>indicator</b> and observed that results are not affected by this methodological change.|$|E

40|$|Educational {{systems can}} quite easily be {{described}} in terms of a context‐input‐process‐output model. Likewise systems of educational indicators ‐‐ i. e. statistics on key aspects of educational systems that are of evaluative relevance ‐ can be categorized as context, input, process and output‐indicators. Process‐indicators are the subject of this paper. The rationale for selecting the process‐indicators chosen here was to look for those school‐ and teaching characteristics that are positively associated with educational achievement. The research literature on school and teaching effectiveness is the most relevant for this. An attempt has been made to formulate a comprehensive model of school and teaching effectiveness and to use this as the basis for a list of the most promising process‐indicators. Some of the key process‐variables that are proposed include stimulating environmental factors, achievement oriented policies, educational leadership, amount of instruction, learning opportunities, structured teaching, collaborative planning and evaluative potential of schools. The problems of constructing and using process‐indicators based on these variables are discussed from the perspectives of macro‐, meso‐ and micro‐level applications of <b>educational</b> <b>indicator</b> systems...|$|E

This study aligned selected aspects of two disciplines, namely anatomy and education. By reviewing the available anatomical data of myelin endowment on the axons of neurons in the nervous system of the human body, and comparing the timing of the investiture with observed behaviors, it was possible to indicate educational implications which could enhance both teaching and learning. The published data from medical and pathological research were used to identify the timing and sequence of myelination and the <b>educational</b> <b>indicator</b> of learning. The presence of myelin indicated a change in learning toward mastery. Although the degree of thickness and ultimate maturity of the myelin could not be precisely given, indications of its development are observable in behavior. A model indicating the routes taken by stimuli through the neurological system resulting in a motoric behavior was proposed. It can be concluded that the results of the input-output models used previously by educational researchers can be more precise if the system processing the stimulus and producing the response is incorporated into their research design...|$|E
40|$|This {{study has}} as its {{starting}} point the central contention that {{the implications of the}} AIDS pandemic in sub-Saharan Africa affect a wide range of societal structures including all levels of the education system. This multilevel qualitative case study of Botswana’s education system sets out to complement national quantitative HIV/AIDS impact studies. Using the draw-and-write technique and unstructured and semi-structured interviews, the study examines the impact of HIV/AIDS on the pupil, classroom, school and contextual levels, as experienced by primary age pupils, teachers, head teachers, regional educational officers and officers at the ministerial level, in high HIV/AIDS prevalence areas. The analysis of data reveals that HIV/AIDS does not only have an impact on orphans and vulnerable children, but affects the majority of children’s psychosocial well-being, perception of self, hopes, beliefs and aspirations for the future, as well as, teaching, learning and the management of learning. Moreover, the impact of the pandemic influenced many of the factors that have been shown to correlate positively with pupils’ achievements in School Effectiveness (SER) research. The findings of the study thus challenge SER’s goal of universality and its narrow focus on academic outcomes. Consequently, the researcher argues that HIV/AIDS needs to be regarded as a contextual variable that not only influences processes and pupils’ outcomes at all levels in the education system, but also as variable that must necessitate a shift in the goals, content and role of education, in order for schools to be regarded as ‘effective’ within the context of AIDS. The study identifies a number of academic and affective educational outputs, outcomes and processes that should be integrated into the primary school phase in order for pupils and schools to not only mitigate the impact of the pandemic but in order that they can become active change agents in reversing the current AIDS trend. The researcher proposes that through a synthesis of the School Effectiveness and the <b>Educational</b> <b>Indicator</b> Research Paradigms, effective process variables can be identified, measured and monitored against relevant outputs and outcomes to support the process of turning the HIV/AIDS trend around.

These initiatives include increasing availability and quality of teaching materials, in-service training of teachers, improvement of teaching methods, supply of subsidized breakfast and lunches at school, etc. There is little dispute these are important and necessary interventions. However, the design, monitoring and evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of these programs and of the educational sector in general is hampered by persistent deficiencies in the quality and timely availability of educational statistics.

The informational needs in terms of indicators are specified for each type of policy analysis. The paper concludes with a specification of priority needs in data improvement.
