40|$|The City of Detroit's {{filing for}} {{municipal}} bankruptcy in July, 2013, {{has added to}} a continuing controversy of whether <b>general</b> <b>obligation</b> bondholders have a secured lien. The City of Detroit claimed its <b>general</b> <b>obligation</b> bondholders {{did not have a}} fully secured lien because the law of the state of Michigan did not create a statutory lien. Without the creation of a lien by state law, during the insolvency or bankruptcy of municipalities, <b>general</b> <b>obligation</b> bondholders will potentially have a mere promise to pay versus a binding obligation to pay, and therefore, will not have a secured lien. Treating otherwise secured <b>general</b> <b>obligation</b> bonds as unsecured will create more risk for investors and increase the cost of borrowing for cities. This article discusses the treatment of <b>general</b> <b>obligation</b> bonds in recent municipal bankruptcies; identifies the states that create a binding <b>obligation</b> to pay <b>general</b> <b>obligation</b> bondholders; describes problems of not treating <b>general</b> <b>obligation</b> bonds as secured; and proposes that states create clear laws that grant statutory liens for <b>general</b> <b>obligation</b> bondholders...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{areas of the}} law with thin jurisprudences on good faith, and how the Uniform Commercial Code’s (UCC’s) express statutory rules have become an active laboratory of experiments on good faith. Part <b>I</b> discusses the <b>general</b> <b>obligation</b> of good faith under the UCC. Part II lays out and discusses how the specific UCC provisions on good faith serve {{one or more of}} the following functions: restrict the exercise of one-sided power in a contract, in order to avoid unfair or unexpected results; restrict the range of possible responses to defective performance or to an unexpected event, in order to salvage the contractual relationship or preserve the parties 2 ̆ 7 negotiating positions; impose a duty to mitigate losses, in order to avoid giving the aggrieved party a windfall beyond the expectations of the contract; and protect the innocent third party buyer or purchaser against claims of the original owner and other claimants. This functional analysis of good faith in the UCC results in clearer definitions of “good faith” in each of the four categories discussed through a determination of the function that good faith serves in each type of situation...|$|R

5000|$|Chapter <b>I</b> {{establishes}} the <b>general</b> <b>obligation</b> {{of the states}} parties to uphold the rights {{set forth in the}} Convention to all persons under their jurisdiction, and to adapt their domestic laws to bring them into line with the Convention. The 23 articles of Chapter II give a list of individual civil and political rights due to all persons, including the right to life [...] "in general, from the moment of conception", to humane treatment, to a fair trial, to privacy, to freedom of conscience, freedom of assembly, freedom of movement, etc. The Article 15 prohibits [...] "any propaganda for war and any advocacy of national, racial, or religious hatred that constitute incitement to lawless violence or to any other similar action against any person on any grounds including those of race, color, religion, language, or national origin" [...] to be considered as offence punishable by law. This provision is established under influence of the Article 20 of the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights. The single article in Chapter III deals with economic, social, and cultural rights.The somewhat cursory treatment given to this issue here was expanded some ten years later with the Protocol of San Salvador (see below).|$|R

50|$|Most <b>general</b> <b>obligation</b> pledges at {{the local}} {{government}} level include a pledge to levy a property tax to meet debt service requirements, in which case holders of <b>general</b> <b>obligation</b> bonds {{have a right to}} compel the borrowing government to levy that tax to satisfy the local government's obligation. Because property owners are usually reluctant to risk losing their holding due to unpaid property tax bills, credit rating agencies often consider a <b>general</b> <b>obligation</b> pledge to have very strong credit quality and frequently assign them investment grade ratings. If local property owners do not pay their property taxes on time in any given year, a government entity is required to increase its property tax rate by as much as is legally allowable in a following year to make up for any delinquencies. In the interim between the taxpayer delinquency and the higher property tax rate in the following year, the <b>general</b> <b>obligation</b> pledge requires the local government to pay debt service coming due with its available resources.|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{analyzed and}} compared variables affecting interest rate and yield of certificates of participation, tax-exempt revenue bonds and tax-exempt <b>general</b> <b>obligation</b> bonds. The study employed {{qualitative and quantitative}} analysis methods. ^ Qualitative research methods included surveys, interviews and focus groups. The survey solicited debt load information from 67 Florida school districts (21 responded) and addressed the question which districts used certificates of participation and why. Eight individuals with experience dealing with all three debt instruments were interviewed. A follow-up focus group of six school district financial officers gathered additional data. Results from the qualitative methods revealed school districts used certificates of participation based on millage authority amount available relative to overall tax base. Also identified was the belief of {{a significant difference in}} certificates of participation costs and the other two debt instrument types. ^ The study 2 ̆ 7 s quantitative methods analyzed 1998 and 1999 initial issues of Moody 2 ̆ 7 s AAA rated certificates of participation, tax-exempt revenue bonds and tax-exempt <b>general</b> <b>obligation</b> bonds. Through an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), the study examined interest rates and yields while controlling for the covariates of credit enhancement, issue size, and maturity date. The analysis identified no significant difference between interest rates of certificates of participation and tax-exempt <b>general</b> <b>obligation</b> bonds (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). There was a significant difference between interest rates of tax-exempt revenue bonds and tax-exempt <b>general</b> <b>obligation</b> bonds. This study discerned no significant difference between yield on certificates of participation and tax-exempt <b>general</b> <b>obligation</b> bonds. It identified a difference in yield between both certificates of participation and tax-exempt <b>general</b> <b>obligation</b> bonds compared with tax-exempt revenue bonds. ^ The study found COPs to have lesser overall costs than RV bonds. COPs also have a quicker entry into the market resulting in construction cost savings. The study found policy implications such as investment portfolio limitations and public choice issues about using COPs as a mechanism to grow government. ...|$|R
