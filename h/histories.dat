5|$|Knowledge of Roman history stands {{apart from}} other civilizations in the ancient world. Its chronicles, {{military}} and otherwise, document the city's very foundation to its eventual demise. Although some <b>histories</b> have been lost, such as Trajan's account of the Dacian Wars, and others, such as Rome's earliest <b>histories,</b> are at least semi-apocryphal, the extant <b>histories</b> of Rome's military history are extensive.|$|E

5|$|Another {{important}} element in nation-building, {{the story of the}} heroic past, fell to such nationalist German historians as the liberal constitutionalist Friedrich Dahlmann (1785–1860), his conservative student Heinrich von Treitschke (1834–1896), and others less conservative, such as Theodor Mommsen (1817–1903) and Heinrich von Sybel (1817–1895), to name two. Dahlmann himself died before unification, but he laid the groundwork for the nationalist <b>histories</b> to come through his <b>histories</b> of the English and French revolutions, by casting these revolutions as fundamental to the construction of a nation, and Dahlmann himself viewed Prussia as the logical agent of unification.|$|E
5|$|Another {{surviving}} {{work for}} the period is Justin's epitome of Pompeius Trogus's Philippic History. Justin's epitomised history is also much condensed from the no-longer-extant original and covers not only Philip's reign, but also the history of Macedon before him, the exploits of Philip's son, Alexander the Great, and his diadochi successors during the Hellenistic period. These surviving <b>histories</b> are complemented by fragments of other <b>histories,</b> including Theopompus's 58-volume history of Philip (which was the source for much of Trogus's Philippic History) and by contemporary epigraphic sources.|$|E
5|$|At one time, {{there were}} {{detailed}} contemporaneous <b>histories</b> on Caligula, {{but they are}} now lost. Additionally, the historians who wrote them are described as biased, either overly critical or praising of Caligula. Nonetheless, these lost primary sources, along with the works of Seneca and Philo, were the basis of surviving secondary and tertiary <b>histories</b> on Caligula written by the next generations of historians. A few of the contemporaneous historians are known by name. Fabius Rusticus and Cluvius Rufus both wrote condemning <b>histories</b> on Caligula that are now lost. Fabius Rusticus {{was a friend of}} Seneca who was known for historical embellishment and misrepresentation. Cluvius Rufus was a senator involved in the assassination of Caligula.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th {{century the}} {{historian}} Frantz Funck-Brentano used the archives to undertake detailed research into the operation of the Bastille, focusing on the upper class prisoners in the Bastille, disproving many of the 18th-century myths about the institution and portraying the prison in a favourable light. Modern historians today consider Funck-Brentano's work slightly biased by his anti-Republican views, but his <b>histories</b> of the Bastille were highly influential and were largely responsible for establishing that the Bastille was a well-run, relatively benign institution. Historian Fernand Bournon used the same archive material to produce the Histoire de la Bastille in 1893, considered by modern historians {{to be one of the}} best and most balanced 19th-century <b>histories</b> of the Bastille. These works inspired the writing of a sequence of more popular <b>histories</b> of the Bastille in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including Auguste Coeuret's anniversary history of the Bastille, which typically focused on a handful of themes and stories involving the more glamorous prisoners from the upper classes of French society.|$|E

5|$|Intact and {{relatively}} detailed <b>histories</b> of Greece, such as Herodotus's The <b>Histories,</b> Thucydides's History of the Peloponnesian War, and Xenophon's Hellenica cover {{the period from}} roughly 500–362 BC. No extant history specifically covers the relevant period of Greek history (359–336 BC), although it is included within various universal <b>histories.</b> The main source for the period is Diodorus Siculus's Bibliotheca historica, written in the 1st century BC, which is therefore a secondary source. Diodorus devotes Book XVI to the period of Philip's reign, but the action is much compressed, and due to {{the scope of the}} work, this book also contains details of happenings during the same period elsewhere in the ancient world. Diodorus is often derided by modern historians for his style and inaccuracies, but he preserves many details of the ancient period found nowhere else. Diodorus worked primarily by epitomising the works of other historians, omitting many details where they did not suit his purpose, which was to illustrate moral lessons from history; his account of the period therefore contains many gaps.|$|E

In addition, we conducted interviews with three educational experts on the role of oral <b>history</b> in Dutch <b>history</b> education. The results showed that most students, teachers and experts believe that working with oral <b>history</b> is interesting, motivating, and may contribute to significant insights into the past. However, our results indicate that oral <b>history</b> plays only a marginal role in the teaching and learning of <b>history</b> in the Netherlands.
