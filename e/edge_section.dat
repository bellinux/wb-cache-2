40|$|In [1] we {{proposed}} Optical Graph Recognition (OGR) as {{the reversal}} of graph drawing. A drawing transforms the topological structure of a graph into a graphical representation. Primarily, it maps vertices to points and displays them by icons, and it maps edges to Jordan curves connecting the endpoints. In reverse, OGR transforms the digital image of a drawn graph into its topological structure. The recognition process is divided into the four phases preprocessing, segmentation, topology recognition, and postprocessing. In the preprocessing phase OGR detects which pixels of an image {{are part of the}} graph (graph pixels) and which pixels are not. The segmentation phase recognizes the vertices of the graph and classifies the graph pixels as vertex and edge pixels. The topology recognition phase first recognizes <b>edge</b> <b>sections.</b> <b>Edge</b> crossings divide <b>edges</b> into <b>edge</b> <b>sections,</b> i. e., the regions between crossings and vertices. The <b>edge</b> <b>sections</b> are merged into edges in the most probable way based on direction vectors.

5000|$|The {{aircraft}} was a pusher biplane with a square section nacelle mounted between {{the upper and}} lower wings, which were of two-spar construction, the spars being ash I-sections. To maintain the leading <b>edge</b> <b>section</b> there were half-ribs between each rib, these extending from the leading edge to the main spar. A single horizontal tailplane with a split elevator and a rudder divided into two part, half above and half below the tailplane, were carried on ash booms behind the wing, the booms being connected by hollow wooden vertical struts and tubular steel horizontal members. The booms were spindled to an I-section except at the points of attachment of the cross-members. [...] The upper wing was double the span of the lower and had wide-span ailerons occupying the whole trailing edge outboard of the tail booms. The wings were connected by a single pair of struts on either side, the outer section of the upper wing being braced by wires leading to inverted-V kingposts. The wide-track undercarriage consisted of a pair of long laminated wood skids each bearing pair of wheels on a short axle. No tailskid was fitted.|$|E
50|$|During the Second World War, Quill was {{in charge}} of {{development}} and production flying at Vickers Supermarine, a job that he took so seriously that he felt he must obtain first-hand combat experience. Following the fall of France in 1940, he was determined to rejoin a fighter squadron. Forestalling opposition from his employers at Vickers Supermarine, he successfully argued the need to gain front-line operational experience and was temporarily released on 5 August 1940 to join No. 65 Squadron at RAF Hornchurch, privately hoping {{that it would be a}} permanent appointment. On 16 August he shot down a Messerschmitt Bf 109 and two days later he shared a victory over a Heinkel He 111. His combat days were short-lived because he was recalled after nineteen days to test the Spitfire Mk III, but they made Quill all the more determined to make the Spitfire an even better fighting machine, and his experiences in the Battle of Britain led to two important changes in the Spitfire. At high speed, the stick force from the ailerons had been very heavy, and this was found to be caused by the ballooning of the fabric covering of the ailerons, and so causing a thicker trailing <b>edge</b> <b>section.</b> This was cured by fitting stiffer, metal-covered ailerons. Quill also initiated an improvement in the optical quality of the cockpit side panels. His concerns about rearward vision from the cockpit led to changes and improvements to the canopy and rear fuselage. Later in 1940 he became chief test pilot for Vickers Armstrongs (Supermarine) Works.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAn {{optimization}} procedure {{has been}} developed for the efficient design of turbine blade airfoil sections. A shape sensitivity study of the airfoils has been performed considering two leading edge shapes, circular and elliptic. Pressure and suction surfaces are approximated by polynomials. A two-level, nonlinear constrained optimization problem is formulated and is solved using the method of feasible directions. The aerodynamic analysis is performed using a two-dimensional panel code. Since several evaluations of the objective functions and the constraints are required within the optimizer, and exact aerodynamic analysis at each step is computationally prohibitive, a two-point exponential approximation technique has been used. The procedure developed successfully eliminates the sharp leading edge velocity spikes, characteristic of typical blade sections, without compromising blade performance. Circular leading edge airfoils {{appear to be more}} effective in eliminating the spikes than elliptic leading edge airfoils. However, the elliptic leading <b>edge</b> <b>sections</b> are more slender than the circular leading <b>edge</b> <b>sections.</b> Optimum results are compared with a reference design...|$|R

For regenerating the natural forest, the plant biomass of native tree species should be increased in the understory without lowering of the plant diversity.
