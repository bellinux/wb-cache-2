2500|$|In Allen's opinion, she couldn't learn {{fast enough}} to make a first-rate movie, {{although}} she thought Marnie did have some good scenes in it. She took a lot of the responsibility for what is considered a very flawed movie, since Hitchcock loved her script so much so that he did not make as good a movie as he should have. Hitchcock would have made her a director but she told him no. Said Allen: [...] "It seems perfectly clear to me that any project takes a minimum of a year to direct. I like to get things on and over with. ... <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>hear</b> the phrase, 'the lady proposes, the studio disposes'? I didn’t make it up. I would never propose myself as a director." [...] Under Hitchcock's mentoring, Allen developed the screenwriting talent she would use the rest of her career. Allen wrote that she never felt discriminated against. While being one of the rare female screenwriters in Hollywood in the 1960s, she said [...] "almost all of the men I worked with were supportive. If I was getting a bum rap somewhere, I didn’t know it." ...|$|E

[...] That highly-cultivated child, Maria, strong in conscious virtue, added her authority in support of the protest. [...] "No young lady who respects herself, Zoe, will ever talk slang." [...] Mr. Gallilee was unworthy of such a daughter. He muttered under his breath, [...] "Oh, bother!" [...] Zo held out her plate for more. Mr. Gallilee was delighted. [...] "My child all over!"

This is a letter of pure friendship; you have got hold of a curiosity, and I hope you will value it. You want to know everything {{that has happened to}} me these three months. The best way to tell you, I think, would be to send you my half dozen guide-books, with my pencil-marks in the margin. Wherever you find a scratch or a cross, or a 'Beautiful!' or a 'So true!' or a 'Too thin!' you may know that I have had a sensation of some sort or other. That has been about my history, ever since I left you. Belgium, Holland, Switzerland, Germany, Italy, I have been through the whole list, and I don't think I am any the worse for it. I know more about Madonnas and church-steeples than I supposed any man could. I have seen some very pretty things, and shall perhaps talk them over this winter, by your fireside. You see, my face is not altogether set against Paris. I have had all kinds of plans and visions, but your letter has blown most of them away. 'L'appetit vient en mangeant,' says the French proverb, and I find that the more I see of the world the more I want to see. Now that I am in the shafts, why shouldn't I trot {{to the end of the}} course? Sometimes I think of the far East, and keep rolling the names of Eastern cities under my tongue: Damascus and Bagdad, Medina and Mecca. I spent a week last month in the company of a returned missionary, who told me I ought to be ashamed to be loafing about Europe when there are such big things to be seen out there. I do want to explore, but I think I would rather explore over in the Rue de l'Universite. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>hear</b> from that pretty lady? If you can get her to promise she will be at home the next time I call, I will go back to Paris straight. I am more than ever in the state of mind I told you about that evening; I want a first-class wife. I have kept an eye on all the pretty girls I have come across this summer, but none of them came up to my notion, or anywhere near it. I should have enjoyed all this a thousand times more if I had had the lady just mentioned by my side. The nearest approach to her was a Unitarian minister from Boston, who very soon demanded a separation, for incompatibility of temper. He told me I was low-minded, immoral, a devotee of 'art for art'--whatever that is: all of which greatly afflicted me, for he was really a sweet little fellow. But shortly afterwards I met an Englishman, with whom I struck up an acquaintance which at first seemed to promise well--a very bright man, who writes in the London papers and knows Paris nearly as well as Tristram. We knocked about for a week together, but he very soon gave me up in disgust. I was too virtuous by half; I was too stern a moralist. He told me, in a friendly way, that I was cursed with a conscience; that I judged things like a Methodist and talked about them like an old lady. This was rather bewildering. Which of my two critics was I to believe? I didn't worry about it and very soon made up my mind they were both idiots. But there is one thing in which no one will ever have the impudence to pretend I am wrong, that is, in being your faithful friend, ...|$|R
40|$|Transcription begins] 28 December 1944 Somewheres [sic] in Belgium My adorable love, Today I {{received}} an {{air mail letter}} dated the 11 th Dec. and a V-Mail letter from the Speerts dated the same day. Capt. Shaw {{told me that he}} {{received an}} air mail letter from you, too. We are feeling very good toay as the situation is turning in our favor. It was good to see the Belgian men returning to the town when they had heard that the drive of the Boche had been stopped. Yes, even Joseph 2 ̆ 6 Mimi’s father came home. He is about 28 or 30 years old and is the school teacher of the town. He had many interesting stories to tell about the activities in the rear areas of Belgium. The children were very happy to see their father and I imagine he was happy to see them. His wife told him that the soldiers burned a lot of coal that they had stored up in the basement. I replied “When you come to visit us in the United States, you can burn as much of our coal as you lie. ” All these people seem abashed at the good treatment the Americans give the Nazis [sic] prisoners. I told them it was because we are still an ultra-humane people and will take our retributions later. Darling, I’m glad that you and Miss Ingram “hit it off. ” It makes it so much more pleasant to work with an assistant who is cooperative and cheerful. I’m sorry to hear that Ukie was ill and I sincerely hope that she is well at this time. By the way, I haven’t heard from Mother and Dad for a while. Dad is excused—he just doesn’t write but I’m a little bit disappointed in mother. I really like to hear from her and she writes excellent letters. You know, sweetheart, {{there was a time when}} I was indifferent to babies in the same way like I was indifferent to marriage, etc., but now I know that the reason I want babies is because I love you so intensly [sic] and our love has reached a point where it is capable of attaining new horizons. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> know what I mean? No guesswork in our relationship whatsoever—our marriage has a foundation of solid granite and now we are ready to build upon that foundation. Eadie, Honey, ask Ukie to please let you have those letters in French that this Belgian woman wrote to her. I’d like to keep them among our memoirs if it’s O. K. with Ukie. Don’t you worry your little head about that 25 bond for September. I understand all the bonds were cancelled as of Aug. 31 and my new one didn’t go into effect until Oct. 1. I’ll check up anyways [sic] and see if the above is correct, sweets. I’m glad to see that you’re corresponding with the other wives. Yes, I agree with you Karla is a nice name. According to [D]oc, they wanted a girl for the first one but he was ready to accept a boy, too. [?], please take care of your health and see that you get sufficient recreation. Every month or so take a visit to a friend in another city (if rail facilities permit and you’re not denying a soldier a place on the train). I’ve read and re-read the poem that Alma 2 ̆ 6 Harold sent you entitled “GI [?]” and feel that the poet has “hit the nail on the head” when he expresses himself and the feelings of the American soldier thusly: “Although on my violent hands is blood In my mind is a garden of beauty. ” I think you have gathered the same theme in my letters when you find me speaking vehemently about the Nazis and in the next breath extolling the charm of Mimi and Joseph (the Belgian kids). The American soldier has not lost his perspective and will not present any psychological problem when he returns home to his loved one. I admit there may be some exceptions, but I am speaking for the majority. Darling, you won’t have any problem, I assure you. This morning we had a brief glimpse of snow flurries but they did not stay with us very long. Tell me, dear, has Sanford spoken to you about any prospects of marriage? I’m speaking like my [?] Goldberg now, but seriously, I wish he found [sic] a swell wife like I have and got [sic] himself married. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>hear</b> about the rest of the Goldbergs? (I mean from a casual source.) Bubsie, doll, I’ll close this letter by kissing your nose, your eyes, and... O. K. if you want me to—a real passionate kiss on your lips. Forever, Vic [Transcription ends...|$|R
