Every greedy adventurer in the world believes that the person who has acquired wealth without individual effort is an easy prey. I expect to derive a certain amount of amusement from those who read of my good fortune and seek to profit by it. That is why I had no objection to telling my story to the reporters, why I let them take my photograph, why I gave them all the information they wanted about the payment of my creditors in full and my sudden wealth. All that we need now is the little West <b>End</b> <b>office</b> which I am going to take within the next few days, and a brass plate upon the door. The fly will then sit still and await the marauding spiders." ...|$|E

50|$|In the 1970s, toll centers were {{modified}} by adding TSPS. With these new computers in place, digit storage in the toll system {{was no longer}} a problem. <b>End</b> <b>offices</b> were less extensively modified, and sent all their digits in a single stream. TSPS handled the gateway codes and other complexities of toll connections to the gateway office.|$|R
50|$|With Bell System divestiture, {{the network}} in the US was divided into local access and {{transport}} areas (LATAs). Calls within LATAs were carried by Local Exchange Carriers (LECs), while calls between them were carried by interexchange carriers (IXCs). LATAs generally have one or more tandem switches which interconnect <b>end</b> <b>office</b> switches.|$|E

50|$|Optical cabling {{has long}} formed the {{backbone}} of major terrestrial networks, delivering signals over long distances.

50|$|In the {{original}} analog networks, short-distance telephone calls were completed by sending relatively high-power electrical signals through the wires to the <b>end</b> <b>office,</b> which then switched the call. This technique {{could not be}} used for long-distance connections, because the signals would be filtered out due to capacitance in the wires. Long-distance switching remained a manual operation years after short-distance calls were automated, requiring operators {{at either end of the}} line to set up the connections.|$|E
50|$|In fact, Bell responded fairly quickly, {{but in a}} more {{targeted}} fashion. Looking {{on local}} records for inordinately long calls to directory service or other hints that phreakers were using a particular switch, filters could then be installed to block efforts at that <b>end</b> <b>office.</b> Many phreakers were forced to use pay telephones as the telephone company technicians regularly tracked long-distance toll free calls in an elaborate cat-and-mouse game. AT&T instead turned to the law for help, {{and a number of}} phreaks were caught by the government.|$|E

One exception is Switched 56kbit/s DDS. In DDS, bit eight is used to identify DTE request to send (RTS) condition. With Switched 56 DDS, bit eight is pulsed (alternately set to logical ZERO and ONE) to transmit two state dial pulse signaling information between a SW56 DDS CSU/DSU, and a digital <b>end</b> <b>office</b> switch.|$|E

50|$|In {{the network}} {{there are various}} classes of {{switching}} systems. An <b>end</b> <b>office</b> switch connects directly to the stations. It knows which circuit to activate (ring) when given a destination number. Other switches in the network are for transport only. These are sometimes called tandem switches. In this case, the goal of destination routing would be to select an outbound span for a particular destination number. The objective {{is to get a}} continuous signal path from the starting location of the caller to the ending location of the called party.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the regional investment practices of institutional {{investors in the}} commercial real estate office market in 1998 and 2003 in England and Wales. Consistent with previous studies in the US the findings show that investors concentrate their holdings in a few (urban) areas and that this concentration has become more pronounced as investors have rationalised their portfolio holdings. The findings also indicate that office investment does not fully correlate with the UK urban hierarchy, as measured by population, but is focused on urban areas with high service sector employment. Finally, the pre-eminence of the City of London and and West <b>End</b> <b>office</b> markets as the key focus of institutional investment is confirmed.
