5|$|When a {{main-sequence star}} consumes the {{hydrogen}} at its core, {{the loss of}} energy generation causes its gravitational collapse to resume. Stars with less than 0.23 , are predicted to directly become white dwarfs when energy generation by nuclear fusion of hydrogen at their core comes to a halt. In stars between this threshold and 10 , the hydrogen surrounding the helium core reaches sufficient temperature and pressure to undergo fusion, forming a hydrogen-burning shell. In consequence of this change, the outer envelope of the star expands and decreases in temperature, {{turning it into a}} red giant. At this point the star <b>is</b> <b>evolving</b> off the main sequence and entering the giant branch. The path which the star now follows across the HR diagram, to the upper right of the main sequence, is called an evolutionary track.|$|E

As a first approximation of evolutionary rates, we assessed the amount of neutral (dS) and non-neutral (dN) substitutions that have accumulated within and across sister clades {{since the time of}} their divergence. We found that in fish, tetraodontiformes (pufferfish) <b>are</b> <b>evolving</b> at faster rates than cypriniformes (fresh water teleosts), while cypriniformes <b>are</b> <b>evolving</b> faster than elasmobranchs (sharks, skates and rays). A similar rate variation was observed in salamanders: plethodontidae <b>were</b> found to <b>evolve</b> at a rate nearly two fold faster than the hydromantes lineage. We discuss possible explanations for this striking variation in substitution rates among different vertebrate lineages that occupy widely diverse habitats and niches.

25|$|The {{first major}} area in {{semantic}} analysis is {{the identification of}} the intended meaning at the word level (taken to include idiomatic expressions). This is word-sense disambiguation (a concept that <b>is</b> <b>evolving</b> away from the notion that words have discrete senses, but rather are characterized by {{the ways in which they}} are used, i.e., their contexts). The tasks in this area include lexical sample and all-word disambiguation, multi- and cross-lingual disambiguation, and lexical substitution. Given the difficulties of identifying word senses, other tasks relevant to this topic include word-sense induction, subcategorization acquisition, and evaluation of lexical resources.|$|E

However, Madison's economy today <b>is</b> <b>evolving</b> from a government-based economy to a consumer services and high-tech base, particularly in the health, biotech and advertising sectors. Beginning in the early 1990s, the city experienced a steady economic boom and has been less affected by recession than {{other areas of the}} state. Much of the expansion has occurred on the city's south and west sides, but it has also affected the east side near the Interstate 39-90-94 interchange and along the northern shore of Lake Mendota. Underpinning the boom is the development of high-tech companies, many fostered by UW–Madison working with local businesses and entrepreneurs to transfer the results of academic research into real-world applications, especially bio-tech applications.|$|E
25|$|Research on {{the repercussions}} of gender in toys {{suggests}} that play {{should be encouraged to}} be more gender neutral in order to work towards a desegregation of the genders. Too, researcher Carol Auster and Claire Mansbach promote that allowing children to play with toys which more closely fit their talents would help them to better develop their skills. In terms of parental influence, a study found that parents who demonstrated some androgynous behavior have higher scores in support, warmth, and self-worth in regards to the treatment of their children. Even as this debate <b>is</b> <b>evolving</b> and children are becoming more inclined to cross barriers in terms of gender with their toys, girls are typically more encouraged to do so than boys because of the societal value of masculinity.|$|E
25|$|While WSS {{improvements}} were ongoing, {{the traditional}} water management approach did {{not account for}} domestic and industrial wastewater treatment and non-point sources pollution control resulting in the environmental degradation of water bodies. These systems were viewed as separate and the management strategy did not account for treatment facilities, local streams, and overall water quality within them. The philosophy <b>is</b> <b>evolving</b> however, and water resources management practice is becoming more of an integrated approach taking into account a multi-sectoral approach looking at water supply, wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), drainage and irrigation as one entity. According to pollution control work presented {{by a team of}} researchers at the British Hydrological Society symposium in 2008, {{there is a need to}} consider the sewer system, the WWTP, and the river as one system. These developments in the Bogotá water management system offer multiple opportunities to incorporate integrated methodologies both now and in the future.|$|E
