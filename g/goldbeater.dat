50|$|Samuel Augustus Perry {{was born}} 17 March 1787 in Wales. He was baptized 12 September 1791 in Holborn, London. He {{was the son}} of Jabez Perry, <b>goldbeater,</b> and his wife Ann.|$|E
50|$|<b>Goldbeater's</b> skin {{is used as}} the {{sensitive}} element in hygrometers, since, due to its hygroscopic property, variations in atmospheric humidity cause skin contraction or expansion. Alexander Graham Bell used a drum of <b>goldbeater's</b> skin with an armature of magnetised iron attached to its middle as a sound receiver (see Invention of the telephone), and the North German Confederation printed 10- and 30-groschen postage stamps on <b>goldbeater's</b> skin to prevent reuse of these high-value stamps. Joseph Thomas Clover invented an apparatus for the inhalation of chloroform in 1862 that consisted of a large reservoir bag lined with <b>goldbeater's</b> skin to make it airtight, into which a known volume of liquid chloroform was injected. Due to its transparency, strength, and fairly uniform thickness, <b>goldbeater's</b> skin {{is also used to}} repair holes and tears in manuscripts written on vellum.|$|R
50|$|To {{manufacture}} <b>goldbeater's</b> skin, the gut of oxen (or other cattle) is {{soaked in}} a dilute solution of potassium hydroxide, washed, stretched, beaten flat and thin, and treated chemically to prevent putrefaction. A pack of 1,000 pieces of <b>goldbeater's</b> skin requires the gut of about 400 oxen and is 1 in thick. Up to 120 sheets of gold laminated with <b>goldbeater's</b> skin can be beaten {{at the same}} time, since the skin is thin and elastic and does not tear under heavy goldbeating. The resultant thickness of gold leaf can be as small as 1 μm-thick.|$|R

5000|$|The [...] "banking line" [...] Guinnesses all {{descend from}} Arthur's brother Samuel (1727-1795) {{who set up}} as a <b>goldbeater</b> in Dublin in 1750; his son Richard (1755-1830), a Dublin barrister; and Richard's son Robert Rundell Guinness who founded Guinness Mahon in 1836.|$|E
50|$|Böckler {{was born}} in Trautskirchen near Neustadt an der Aisch {{and grew up in}} a family with limited means. When his father died in 1888 he quit school and worked as an {{apprentice}} <b>Goldbeater</b> to support his family. In 1894 he joined the Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands and the Deutscher Metallarbeiter Verband.|$|E
50|$|The {{history of}} the Giusto Manetti Battiloro company began in 1820 when Luigi Manetti {{purchased}} the small artisan workshop of a Florentine <b>goldbeater</b> located in Via de’ Pescioni. After his death the company passed to his son, who lived between 1800 and 1900, and successfully overcame the difficult period of World War I.|$|E
50|$|He {{belonged to}} the guild of painters, glassmakers, woodcut-makers and <b>goldbeaters,</b> and {{eventually}} reached a high position within the guild. His printing activity ceased in 1495.|$|R

40|$|This report {{deals with}} {{systematic}} experiments {{carried out on}} five diaphragm materials with different pretreatment, {{for the purpose of}} ascertaining the suitability of such materials for slack diaphragms. The relationship of deflection and load, temperature and moisture, was recorded. Of the explored materials, synthetic leather, balloon cloth, <b>goldbeaters</b> skin, Igelit and Buna, synthetic leather treated with castor oil is the most suitable material for the small pressure range required. Balloon cloth is nearly as good, while <b>goldbeaters</b> skin, Igelit and Buna were found to be below the required standards...|$|R
50|$|World War II {{led to a}} {{reduction}} of the company’s activities caused by the call to arms {{of most of the}} male employees. On 2 July 1944 Florence was bombed by American aircraft, and the company's buildings were completely destroyed (the Americans likely mistook the factory for a railway freight depot). Despite this blow to the company, soon {{after the end of the}} war, in 1946, the Giusto Manetti Battiloro resumed gold leaf manufacturing, inaugurating the partial reconstruction of the plant.In 1950 the company made their first agreement with an English <b>goldbeater</b> for the marketing and selling of hot stamping foils, thus originating the second branch of the company, which has since worked in tandem with the historical manufacturing of gold leaf.|$|E
50|$|The gold is beaten on a large, heavy {{block of}} marble or granite. These stone blocks were {{sometimes}} placed {{on top of}} a tree trunk set deep into the ground. This created greater resiliency for the hammer. Beating of the cutch by hand takes about one hour using a fifteen-pound hammer. The <b>goldbeater</b> instinctively follows a pattern and sets up a rhythm, striking the packet with up to seventy strokes a minute. The packet is rotated and turned over to ensure that the gold inside expands evenly in all directions. The original small squares of gold are beaten until they have expanded to the outer edges of the four inch square cutch. The gold is taken out of the cutch and each piece is cut into four pieces with a knife. Using the pincers, these squares of gold are put into a second packet called the shoder, which has approximately 1,500 skins. The shoder is beaten for about three hours until the gold has expanded to a five-inch square.|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{the frame}} of a {{systematic}} investigation on leaf gilding history and processes, in a research program intending to propose gold leaf alloys specially devoted to restoration, new gold alloys containing low concentration additions of In or Pd were designed and leaves were elaborated {{in collaboration with the}} <b>goldbeater</b> Dauvet. The influence of those elements on the colour change induced by alloying was obtained by colorimetry. The microstructural and metallurgical properties of the alloys were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The foils and leaves were characterized at the different manufacturing steps by EBSD (Backscattered Electron Diffraction), in order to evaluate the effect of the fabrication process on the microstructure and crystallographic texture. Surface segregation of the alloying element, influencing surface colour, was sometimes evidenced and discussed. The mechanical properties of the foils or leaves were measured by micro-and nano-indentation. The obtained properties and behaviour of the new alloys were compared with those of the leaves currently used for leaf gilding. The results conducted the beating company to consider developing new gold leaves production range(s) devoted specially for restoration application. As a result of the present investigation, new manufacturing and gilding procedures have been proposed...|$|E

25|$|The gas {{cells were}} made of <b>goldbeater's</b> skins, {{one of the most}} gas-impervious {{materials}} known at the time. Named for their use in beating and separating gold leaf, <b>goldbeater's</b> skins were made from the outer membrane of the large intestines of cattle. The membranes were washed and scraped to remove fat and dirt, and then placed in a solution of water and glycerine in preparation for application to the rubberized cotton fabric providing the strength of the gas cells. The membranes were wrung out by hand to remove the water-glycerine storage solution and then rubber-cemented to the cotton fabric and finally given a light coat of varnish. The 20 gas cells within the airframe were filled to about 85% of capacity at normal barometric pressure. Each gas cell had a spring-loaded relief valve and manual valves operated from the control car.|$|R

5000|$|It {{can also}} be used to coat tissue or <b>goldbeater's</b> skin. Here, {{isinglass}} is similar to parchment size and other forms of gelatin, but it is unique in that as a dried film the adhesive can be reactivated with moisture. For this use, the isinglass is cooked with a few drops of glycerin or honey.This adhesive is advantageous in situations where minimal use of water is desired for the parchment as the isinglass can be reactivated with an ethanol-water mixture. It also has a greater adhesive strength than many other adhesives used for parchment repair.|$|R
5000|$|Previous {{repairs and}} {{conservation}} treatments are removed {{if it is}} determined that the parchment is in good condition and that the repair is not of historic importance to the parchment. Dried out patches are removed via cleaning and humidification techniques. Parchment objects that have been attached to mounts are removed with a sharpened lifting tool and {{a small amount of}} moisture. Previous laminations, like <b>Goldbeater's</b> skin and Mipofolie, can sometimes be removed with solvents and mechanical techniques, though this removal technique can risk additional damage to the original parchment.|$|R
50|$|In {{an attempt}} {{the next year}} to provide both {{endurance}} and controllability, de Rozier developed a balloon having both hot air and hydrogen gas bags, a design which was soon named after him as the Rozière. The principle was to use the hydrogen section for constant lift and to navigate vertically by heating and allowing to cool the hot air section, in order to catch the most favourable wind at whatever altitude it was blowing. The balloon envelope was made of <b>goldbeaters</b> skin. The first flight ended in disaster and the approach has seldom been used since.|$|R
