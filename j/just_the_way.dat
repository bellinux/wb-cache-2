5|$|The local nurses' {{union for}} the Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital is on strike. Jeff, {{the husband of}} Deb (Chad Morgan), one of the nurses, collapses while walking the picket line. At the {{emergency}} room, House suspects Jeff's extreme niceness and inability to get angry is a major symptom of an underlying condition. After various tests, the team suspects his niceness is a personality change resulting from syphilis. Kutner (Kal Penn) asks the couple if either of them had an affair, {{which could lead to}} syphilis. Deb denies it, stating that it is <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> her husband behaves and that it is impossible for her to not love him.|$|E

25|$|At {{the start}} of the 21st Century, Oulton Park is still as popular as ever and still as {{demanding}} as it ever has been on drivers and riders, but, in common with so many circuits, it no longer hosts major international events. Gone are the glory days when all the major Formula One teams (including Scuderia Ferrari) came to Cheshire, now the major events on the circuit’s calendar are the twice-yearly visit of the British Superbike Championship and the annual visit of the British Touring Car Championship. This is no fault of the circuit management – it is <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> the sport has gone. But Oulton Park is still the great challenge it always was.|$|E
25|$|Well, it's {{not really}} a choice at all. It's just, you know, I started playing very young and from early on, the people I was {{listening}} to had some element of finger style. Probably the first guitarist I was emulating was Scotty Moore, when I was maybe 6 or 7. And he played with a pick, but he also used fingers. And {{a lot of the}} session players, like Chet Atkins, they played with fingers or a pick. Then I listened to a certain amount of light classical guitar playing. And of course later on, when the first wave of rock 'n' roll kind of fell away, folk music was very popular and very influential in my style. So it was really less of a choice than what I fell into. I use a pick occasionally. I certainly use it more in the studio when {{you want to get a}} certain tone. But it's <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> I came up. I wasn't taught. I just sort of figured things out on my own terms. I guess that was one of the ways that I became comfortable and it just kind of set in.|$|E
25|$|After a {{few months}} of being together, happy and in love, Robin has a {{pregnancy}} scare. Although the test is negative, she realizes she wants different things from life than Patrick. She wants more from him (children), while he is happy <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> they are. They eventually break up. Robin wants to be a mother and decides to be a single mom. She and her friend, Dr. Kelly Lee (Minae Noji), put a list of possible sperm donors together. Robin picks people in Port Charles, because she feels that they have redeeming qualities she will like to pass on to her child, and does not like the idea of her child's father being a stranger. On November 30, 2007, Patrick tells Robin that he still loves and misses her. He just wants them to be together again and asks her to table the discussion of children for a year, and while she has stated that she has never been happier than when she was with him, she knows nothing would be different in a year - she would still want kids and he would not, to which he sadly replies that she is probably right, {{but it would have been}} a great year.|$|E

However, the band's next two albums, Love Kraft and Hey Venus!, were not made available on DVD and, in a 2008 interview with Uncut, Rhys suggested that the release had been something of a failure: [...] "no one gave a shit because people just want to rock n' roll!" ...|$|E

Nevertheless, he made a few landmark recordings while he was with that company... Few of the songs on Yesterday's Wine are well-known Nelson compositions, but all are minor masterpieces".|$|E

A week after her appearance on the David Susskind Show, a middle-aged couple approached Gittings in the supermarket to claim, [...] "You made me realize that you gay people love each other <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> Arnold and I do." ...|$|E

And you know, <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> I would sing it versus in the way Toni Braxton would sing it. And I love the way it came out, and I think probably the rest of the band really does not like it, and that’s probably why it didn’t make our fifth record, in 2005 when we were recording it." ...|$|E

500|$|Mitford did {{not regard}} {{herself as a}} journalist: nevertheless, her {{articles}} were popular, particularly those she contributed on Paris life to The Sunday Times. Thomson describes this series as [...] "a more sophisticated version of A Year in Provence, bringing France to the English in <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> that they most like it". Thompson adds that although Mitford was always a competent writer, it is in her letters, with their freedom of expression and flights of fancy, that her true character emerges. [...] Many have been published within collections; they are, according to The Independents reviewer: [...] "a delight, full of the sparks of an abrasive and entertaining wit, refreshingly free from politeness".|$|E
500|$|Jackson owed his vocal {{technique}} {{in large part}} to Diana Ross, especially his use of the oooh interjection, which he used from a young age; Ross had used this effect on many of the songs recorded with the Supremes. Not only a mother figure to him, she was often observed in rehearsal as an accomplished performer. He said: [...] "I got to know her well. She taught me so much. I used to just sit in the corner and watch the way she moved. She was art in motion. I studied the way she moved, the way she sang – <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> she was."

500|$|Mars {{claims that}} his work with other artists has {{influenced}} his musical style: [...] " [...] Nothin' on You had a Motown vibe, Billionaire was a reggae acoustic guitar-driven song, though one of my favourites is the CeeLo Green song. I don't think anyone else could've sung that song. And there's <b>Just</b> <b>the</b> <b>Way</b> You Are. If you know my story, you know I love all different genres of music." [...] Mars states that growing up in Hawaii influenced his style, giving the songs a reggae sound. He explains: [...] "In Hawaii {{some of the biggest}} radio stations are reggae. That music brings people together. It's not urban music or pop music. It's just songs. That's what makes it cross over so well. The song comes first." ...|$|E

A month later, on July 18, the band confirmed the album would be released on September 30, in addition to revealing the artwork and track list. Mikael Åkerfeldt described it as [...] "a fine little record. My favorite in our discography right now. Of course. That's how it should be, right? It's both fresh and old, both progressive and rehashed. Heavy and calm. <b>Just</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> we like it."

She concludes, [...] "Mars' lyrics aim to make female listeners feel nothing short of perfect in their own skin". Tim Byron of The Vine said {{the song is}} [...] "effective – the repeated lines {{at the start of}} the verses are catchy". Consequence of Sound's Kevin Barber described the song [...] "Mars sticks to the song’s name and insists that he wouldn’t want to change anything about his particular gal.You believe him, too.
