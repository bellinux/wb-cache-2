5|$|I fell in {{love with}} him as a ten-year-old boy. I saw him in a play in New York... a very well-staged melodrama which was an {{enormous}} hit for about a year—it was made as a movie later with somebody else. He had the leading role, and I never forgot him. And through the years I'd seen him in movies—little things. And I could never forget that performance of his. He's always played very stereotyped parts in pictures but is one of the best actors I've ever <b>known.</b> <b>I</b> have such respect for him. You play next to him and you just feel the thing that you do with a big actor—this dynamo going on.|$|E
5|$|I. anglicus was the {{original}} type species, but the holotype {{was based on a}} single tooth and only partial remains of the species have been recovered since. In March 2000, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature changed the type species to the much better <b>known</b> <b>I.</b> bernissartensis, with the new holotype being IRSNB 1534. The original Iguanodon tooth is held at Te Papa Tongarewa, the national museum of New Zealand in Wellington, although it is not on display. The fossil arrived in New Zealand following the move of Gideon Mantell's son Walter there; after the elder Mantell's death, his fossils went to Walter.|$|E

He produced several compilation books of them, including Ronnie Barker's Book of Bathing Beauties, A Pennyworth of Art, and Sauce. Barker rarely appeared in public, and when he did, it was almost always in character. He once said, [...] "I've always <b>known</b> <b>I</b> haven't a personality of my own, I have {{to be someone else}} to be happy. That's why I became an actor, I suppose." ...|$|E

500|$|The play {{ran for a}} month (and was Coward's {{first play}} seen in America), after which Coward {{returned}} to acting in works by other writers, starring as Ralph in The Knight of the Burning Pestle in Birmingham and then London. He did not enjoy the role, finding Francis Beaumont and his sometime collaborator John Fletcher [...] "two of the dullest Elizabethan writers ever <b>known...</b> <b>I</b> had a very, very long part, but I was very, very bad at it". Nevertheless, The Manchester Guardian thought that Coward got {{the best out of}} the role, and The Times called the play [...] "the jolliest thing in London".|$|E
500|$|Tommy Handley died {{suddenly}} on 9 January 1949; the BBC {{decided that he}} was [...] "so much the keystone and embodiment of the actual performance" [...] of ITMA, that they cancelled the show immediately. Jacques later remarked that Handley was [...] "one of the greatest radio performers we have ever <b>known.</b> <b>I</b> learned... so much from him". Later that year Le Mesurier divorced his wife; shortly after the divorce came through, Jacques proposed to him, asking, [...] "don't you think it's about time we got married?" [...] The couple wed on 10 November that year, at Kensington Registrar's Office. After a week's honeymoon in Southsea, {{she returned to the}} Players' where she was engaged to appear as Marrygolda in the Christmas pantomime Beauty and the Beast.|$|E
500|$|Love in the Time of Cholera {{is based}} on the stories of two couples. The young love of Fermina Daza and Florentino Ariza {{is based on}} the love affair of García Márquez's parents. However, as García Márquez {{explains}} in an interview: “The only difference is [...] married. And {{as soon as they were}} married, they were no longer interesting as literary figures." [...] The love of old people is based on a newspaper story about the death of two Americans, who were almost 80 years old, who met every year in Acapulco. They were out in a boat one day and were murdered by the boatman with his oars. García Márquez notes, [...] "Through their death, the story of their secret romance became <b>known.</b> <b>I</b> was fascinated by them. They were each married to other people." ...|$|E

500|$|His {{resignation}} {{was announced}} amid {{an outpouring of}} appreciation from politicians and naval comrades. Battenberg had written to Churchill on 28 October, [...] "What I shd value above all else is {{to be admitted to}} the Privy Council." [...] The King later swore Louis in as a Privy Councillor in a public show of support. Labour party politician and trade union leader J. H. Thomas wrote to The Times: [...] "I desire to express my extreme regret at the announcement that Prince Louis of Battenberg has, by his resignation, pandered to the most mean and contemptible slander I have ever <b>known</b> ... <b>I</b> was simply astounded to hear the base suggestions and rumours current, and I am afraid that his action will simply be looked upon as a triumph for the mean and miserable section of people, who, at a time of national trial, is ever ready to pass a foul lie from lip to lip without a tittle of evidence." [...] Admiral of the Fleet Lord John Hay thought that the [...] "ingeniously propagated lies" [...] originated from Germany.|$|E
500|$|Prince Frederick settled Anderson in {{a former}} army barracks in the small village of Unterlengenhardt, {{on the edge of}} the Black Forest, where she became a sort of tourist attraction. Lili Dehn, a friend of Tsarina Alexandra, visited her and {{acknowledged}} her as Anastasia, but when Charles Sydney Gibbes, English tutor to the imperial children, met Anderson he denounced her as a fraud. In an affidavit, he swore [...] "She in no way resembles the true Grand Duchess Anastasia that I had <b>known...</b> <b>I</b> am quite satisfied that she is an impostor." [...] She became a recluse, surrounded by cats, and her house began to decay. In May 1968, Anderson was taken to a hospital at Neuenbürg after being discovered semi-conscious in her cottage. In her absence, Prince Frederick cleaned up the property by order of the local board of health. Her Irish Wolfhound and 60 cats were put to death. Horrified by this, Anderson accepted her long-term supporter Gleb Botkin's offer to move to the United States.|$|E
500|$|At age 30 (the {{minimum age}} {{required}} {{to hold the}} office), Biden became the sixth-youngest senator in U.S. history, and one of only 18 senators who took office before reaching the age of 31. But the accident left him filled with both anger and religious doubt: [...] "I liked to [...] at night when I {{thought there was a}} better chance of finding a fight ... I had not <b>known</b> <b>I</b> was capable of such rage ... I felt God had played a horrible trick on me." [...] To be at home every day for his young sons, Biden began the practice of commuting every day by Amtrak train for 1½ hours each way from his home in the Wilmington suburbs to Washington, D.C., which he continued to do throughout his Senate career. [...] In the aftermath of the accident, he had trouble focusing on work, and appeared to just go through the motions of being a senator. In his memoirs, Biden notes that staffers were taking bets on how long he would last. [...] A single father for five years, he left standing orders that he be interrupted in the Senate at any time if his sons called. [...] In remembrance of his wife and daughter, Biden does not work on December 18, the anniversary of the accident.|$|E
40|$|In 1995, I {{wrote an}} essay 'Existence'. From the {{analysis}} of the process of self-consciousness, I concluded: "All <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> only <b>I</b> know", because if YOU <b>know</b> 'what <b>I</b> know', only <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that 'YOU <b>know</b> 'what <b>I</b> know'', and if you <b>know</b> that 'only <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that 'YOU <b>know</b> 'what <b>I</b> know''', only <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that [...] . etc. At every moment, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> something more (<b>I</b> <b>know</b> that YOU know), or something less (<b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> that YOU <b>know</b> that <b>I</b> <b>know)</b> - than YOU.

500|$|Historians today {{generally}} {{dismiss the}} authenticity of the find, attributing it to a publicity stunt performed to raise funds to repair the Abbey, which was mostly burned in 1184. William of Malmesbury's history of the English kings stated [...] "Arthur’s grave is nowhere seen, whence antiquity of fables still claims that he will return" [...] and his work [...] "On the Antiquity of the Glastonese Church"—larded as it is with known and suspected pious forgeries—nowhere mentions a connection between the abbey and either Arthur's grave or Avalon. The fact that the search for Arthur's body is connected to Henry II and Edward I, both kings who fought major Welsh wars, has had scholars suggest that propaganda may have played a part as well. Gerald, a constant supporter of royal authority, in his account of the discovery clearly aims to destroy the idea of the possibility of King's Arthur's messianic return: [...] "Many tales are told and many legends have been invented about King Arthur and his mysterious ending. In their stupidity the British [...] people maintain that he is still alive. Now that the truth is <b>known,</b> <b>I</b> have taken the trouble to add a few more details in this present chapter. The fairy-tales have been snuffed out, and the true and indubitable facts are made known, so that what really happened must be made crystal clear to all and separated from the myths which have accumulated on the subject." ...|$|E
500|$|In August 1996, {{the band}} {{performed}} two concerts before crowds of 250,000 at Knebworth House, Hertfordshire, while more than 2,500,000 fans had applied for tickets. The dates {{were to be}} the zenith of Oasis's popularity, and both the music press and the band realised {{it would not be}} possible for the band to equal the event. By this time however, there was much instability and internal conflict emerging between the band members. On 23 August 1996, vocalist Liam Gallagher refused to sing for an MTV Unplugged performance at London's Royal Festival Hall, pleading a sore throat. Though he did attend the concert, he spent the evening heckling Noel from the upper level balcony. Four days later, Liam declined to participate in the first leg of an American tour, complaining that he needed to buy a house with his then girlfriend Patsy Kensit. He re-joined the band a few days after for a key concert at the MTV Video Music Awards in New York, but intentionally sang off-key and spat beer and saliva during the performance. The following day, The Sun led with the front page headline [...] "America sickened by obscene Liam's spitting rampage." [...] Amongst much internal bickering, the tour continued—with Liam—to Charlotte, North Carolina, where Noel finally lost his patience with his brother and announced he was leaving the band. He later admitted [...] "If the truth be <b>known,</b> <b>I</b> didn't want to be there anyway. I wasn't prepared to be in the band if people were being like that to each other." ...|$|E
