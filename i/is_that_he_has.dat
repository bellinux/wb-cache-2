5|$|Count on Mr. Welles: he doesn't {{do things}} by halves.... Upon the screen he {{discovered}} an area {{large enough for}} his expansive whims to have free play. And the consequence <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> made a picture of tremendous and overpowering scope, not in physical extent so much as in its rapid and graphic rotation of thoughts. Mr. Welles has put upon the screen a motion picture that really moves.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In this episode, Reverend Orison releases Donnie Pfaster, Scully's former kidnapper, from jail {{in the hopes of}} passing judgment on him. What he discovers instead <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> released pure evil, and it’s headed for Scully.|$|E
25|$|Giuliani only favors capital {{punishment}} for murder in certain circumstances. One such example <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> advocated {{the death penalty}} for terrorists following September 11.|$|E

25|$|When Hercule Poirot's own dentist, Henry Morley, {{is found}} dead from a gunshot wound, the {{official}} verdict <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> killed himself; a verdict apparently supported when {{it appears that}} he has given one of his patients a fatal overdose of anaesthetic. Poirot suspects, however, {{that there is more}} to the case than at first appears, and soon events confirm his worst suspicions.|$|E
25|$|Snooty Buttoo: A corrupt {{politician}} who hires Rashid to convince constituents that he (Buttoo) should be re-elected. Buttoo is a class-conscious, pompous, arrogant, self-assured person whose chief hold over his constituents <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> been re-elected before. To persuade Rashid to sympathise with him, he offers both Rashid and Haroun a stay on a luxurious houseboat called 'The Arabian Nights Plus One'. Ultimately driven from his district by popular demand.|$|E
25|$|Reed next {{goes after}} the Palermo Mob. Whitting {{tells him that}} when the last Don was imprisoned in 1995, the mob went into decline. Recently, however, the {{remnants}} have begun to organize. Whitting believes a new Don has emerged, but is unsure who it may be. Reed's investigation eventually leads to Vincent Tuzzi (Fred Berman). When Reed interrogates him, he says he never met the OCU mole; all their business was conducted over the phone. All Tuzzi knows <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> a Spanish accent.|$|E

But in truth <b>he</b> <b>had</b> eaten nothing all day.|$|R

25|$|What {{is unusual}} about Cutolo <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> {{a kind of}} ideology, another factor that appealed to rootless and badly educated youths. He founded the NCO in his home town Ottaviano on October 24, 1970, the day of Cutolo's patron saint, San Raffaele. In such a way Cutolo created the most {{powerful}} organization ever {{to exist in the}} Neapolitan hinterland. Using his personal appeal and almost magic charisma, he was able to achieve this single-handedly. Cutolo had strong ties with the Calabrian 'Ndrangheta. According to some pentiti, Cutolo's career started with his affiliation with the 'Ndrangheta, supported by important bosses such as Piromalli, Paolo De Stefano, and Mammoliti. Cutolo based his organisation of the NCO on the model of the 'Ndrangheta, its internal codes and rituals.|$|E
25|$|A genius swordsman and {{officer of}} the Shinsengumi. He has strong bonds with Kondōwho raised Okita {{from the age of}} nine after Okita's mother and {{siblings}} could no longer afford to care for him, and Hijikatawhom he loves and respects like a brother. He is the first person to discover Sei's true sex and he is her main confidant on matters relating to it. He had wanted her {{to go back to a}} normal girl's life after she had gotten her revenge because of the brutality of the life of a samurai. After the Ikedaya Affair, he admits he has affections for Sei as if she were his own kin. Over a year after those events he realizes he is in love with her. When he was 17, a woman he rejected attempted suicide in front of him and Okita came to the conclusion that falling in love was not worth such pain, and he has kept his distance from women ever since. Another hindrance to romance <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> dedicated his life to the path of the samurai and has vowed to himself that he will never marry. The character is based on the historical figure of Okita Sōji.|$|E
500|$|Bruce LaBruce {{wrote of}} Munro's impact on Toronto, {{just prior to}} his death: [...] "As we all know, Toronto can be a cruel and unforgiving city. What makes Will Munro so {{extraordinary}} {{as an artist and}} as a person <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> not only remained true to such a harsh mistress, but that he has also contributed so substantially to the fabric and heft of this often maleficent metropolis. His dedication to community work (including volunteering for a decade at an LGBT youth crisis hotline) and to creating social and sexual stimulation for the queer community outside the decaying gay ghetto (namely, his wonderfully raunchy club night, Vazaleen, and his participation as a founding partner in revitalizing the Beaver Café) is unmatched." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{reviewer}} for The New York Times {{noted the}} reduced numbers of gadgets {{employed in the}} book, {{when compared with the}} films, that they felt had [...] "overshadowed the personality of the secret agent"; overall the reviewer felt that [...] "Mr. Amis has now given Bond back to the readers." [...] Oberbeck commented that Bond [...] "has become a sensitive man-of-ethics who suffers pangs of doubt and remorse over the 'senseless' violence of his profession". Oberbeck {{went on to say that}} Amis [...] "never quite captures the bizzare beat of a Fleming pace"; most telling, according to Oberbeck, was that [...] "the greatest flaw in Amis' conception of Bond <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> attempted to transform the consummate spy-hero into something he was never meant to have been: a man with a job".|$|E
500|$|Wilde and aestheticism {{were both}} mercilessly caricatured and criticised in the press; the Springfield Republican, for instance, commented on Wilde's {{behaviour}} {{during his visit}} to Boston to lecture on aestheticism, suggesting that Wilde's conduct was more a bid for notoriety rather than devotion to beauty and the aesthetic. T. W. Higginson, a cleric and abolitionist, wrote in [...] "Unmanly Manhood" [...] of his general concern that Wilde, [...] "whose only distinction <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> written a thin volume of very mediocre verse", would improperly influence the behaviour of men and women. Though his press reception was hostile, Wilde was well received in diverse settings across America; he drank whiskey with miners in Leadville, Colorado, and was fêted at the most fashionable salons in every city he visited.|$|E
500|$|Fonville noted at {{the time}} that, in his opinion, speed was more {{essential}} than beef and weight in the shot put. Speaking about his technique, Fonville said, [...] "You concentrateand then you just try to explode across the circle." [...] His coach, Ken Doherty, described Fonville as [...] "one of the hardest working, most studious athletes" [...] he had ever coached. Doherty also added that Fonville's technique distinguished him from most shot putters: [...] "Fonville drives completely across the ring in one continuous motion. Previously, most shotputters made their initial hop and hesitated before their final drive. ... Any track coach looking at him, would recognize all the points of good form. The only difference <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> unusual speed and quicknessand he is the greatest competitor I've ever coached." [...] One columnist described Fonville's steady improvement from his freshman year in 1946 through his junior year in 1948 and concluded: [...] "Small as shot-putters go, Fonville is the greatest in {{the long history of}} sensational [...] heavers." ...|$|E

And could it <b>be</b> {{possible}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> not known this--had not read her heart as she had read his? Could it <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> come there day after day, looking to her for love, and sympathy, and kindness--that sort of kindness which a man demands from no one but her he loves, and which no one can give him unless she loves him? Could it <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> done this and then thought that it all meant nothing? that the interchange of such feelings had no further signification? ...|$|R

2500|$|But Hazlitt soon qualifies his admiring tone. First, he {{cautions}} against mistaking Bentham for the originator {{of the theory}} of utility; rather, [...] "his merit <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> brought all the objections and arguments, more distinctly labelled and ticketed, under this one head, and made a more constant and explicit reference to it at every step of his progress, than any other writer." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jeffrey [...] "Jeff" [...] Randell (voiced by Sean Giambrone) – One of Clarence's best friends. He {{was said}} to have Asperger {{syndrome}} in the pilot episode, but the claim was quickly dismissed by the characters. Intelligent, detail-oriented, pragmatic, and decisive, Jeff is the most morally inclined of the trio and tries his best to prevent Clarence from going down a bad road. Jeff's most well-known trait <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> a cube-shaped head which represents his [...] "square" [...] personality. He is an avid fan of game shows and enjoys playing along with them.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike the {{accounts}} of Bentham and Godwin, Hazlitt's treatment of Coleridge in The Spirit of the Age presents no sketch of the man pursuing his daily life and habits. There is little about his appearance; the focus is primarily {{on the development of}} Coleridge's mind. Coleridge is a man of undoubted [...] "genius", whose mind is [...] "in the first class of general intellect". His problem <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> been too bewitched by the mass of learning and literature from antiquity to the present time to focus on creating any truly lasting literary or philosophical work of his own, {{with the exception of a}} few striking poems early in his career.|$|E
2500|$|In 1934, an {{anonymous}} editor expanded the compilation with [...] "Text and Commentary" [...] (pp 136–41). The production of this uncredited compilation was a 300-page book, an inauthentic expanded {{edition of the}} twelfth chapter of Nilus's 1905 book on {{the coming of the}} anti-Christ. It consists of substantial liftings of excerpts of articles from Ford's antisemitic periodical The Dearborn Independent. This 1934 text circulates most widely in the English-speaking world, {{as well as on the}} internet.
