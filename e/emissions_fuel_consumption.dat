50|$|DRL power {{consumption}} varies widely {{depending on the}} implementation. Current production DRL systems consume from 5 watts (dedicated LED system) to over 200 W (headlamps and all parking, tail, and marker lights on). International regulators, primarily in Europe, are working to balance the potential safety benefit offered by DRL with the increased fuel consumption due to their use. Because the power to run the DRLs must be produced by the engine, which in turn requires burning additional fuel, high-power DRL systems increase CO2 emissions sufficiently to affect a country's compliance with the Kyoto protocol on greenhouse gas emissions. For that reason, low-power solutions are being encouraged and headlamp-based systems are not allowed after DRLs became mandatory in Europe {{at the beginning of}} 2011. LEDs and low-power, high-efficacy, long-life light bulbs produce appropriate amounts of light for an effective DRL without significantly increasing fuel consumption or <b>emissions.</b> <b>Fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> reductions of up to 0.5 mpg may be found when comparing a 55 W DRL system to a 200 W DRL system. In 2006, the UK's Department of Transport also found significant reductions in emissions and fuel consumption when comparing a 42 W DRL system to a 160 W full headlight DRL systems. DRL fuel consumption can be reduced to insignificant levels by the use of 8 to 20 W DRL systems based on LEDs or high-efficacy filament bulbs.|$|E

Because {{more and more}} fuel and air pollution problems arise recently, an intersection signal control optimization method which aims at reducing vehicle <b>emissions,</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> and vehicle delay is required heavily. This paper proposed a signal control multi-object optimization method to reduce vehicle <b>emissions,</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> and vehicle delay simultaneously at an intersection. The optimization method combined the Paramics microscopic traffic simulation software, Comprehensive Modal Emissions Model (CMEM), and genetic algorithm.

The test motorcycle was driven on roads around Khon Kaen City, Thailand, to collect on-road driving data during the morning peak hours {{for a total of}} 112 hours.

The developed models were applied with a traffic microsimulation to evaluate the exclusive zone for motorcycles stopping at a signalized intersection.

Data were collected on multiple replicates of three standardised on-road journeys: (1) A simple urban route; (2) A combined urban/inter-urban route; and, (3) An urban route subject to significant traffic management. At the total journey measurement level, data collected here indicate that replacing diesel with a B 5 substitute could result in significant increases in both NOx emissions (8 - 13 %) and <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> (7 - 8 %). However, statistical analysis of probe vehicle data demonstrated the limitations of comparisons based on such total journey measurements, i. e., methods analogous to those used in conventional dynamometer/drive cycle fuel comparison studies. Here, methods based on the comparison of speed/acceleration <b>emissions</b> and <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> maps are presented. Significant variations across the speed/acceleration surface indicated that direct <b>emission</b> and <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> impacts were highly dependent on the journey/drive cycle employed.

To obtain a more complete evaluation of the “environmental performance” of the advertised cars, further parameters not included in the abovementioned directive (type of car, engine size, engine power, power supply, compliance with European anti-pollution legislation) were also considered.
