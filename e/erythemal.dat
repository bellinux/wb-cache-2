25|$|The UV Index is {{a number}} linearly related to the {{intensity}} of sunburn-producing UV radiation at a given point on the earth's surface. It cannot be simply related to the irradiance (measured in W/m2) because the UV of greatest concern occupies a spectrum of wavelength from 295 to 325nm, and shorter wavelengths have already been absorbed a great deal when they arrive at the earth's surface. Skin damage from sunburn, however, is related to wavelength, the shorter wavelengths being much more damaging. The UV power spectrum (expressed as Watts per square metre per nanometre of wavelength) is therefore multiplied by a weighting curve known as the <b>erythemal</b> action spectrum, and the result integrated over the whole spectrum. This gave Canadian scientists a weighted figure (sometimes called Diffey-weighted UV irradiance, or DUV, or <b>erythemal</b> dose rate) typically around 250mW/m2 in midday summer sunlight.

Integration of these values using all the intermediate weightings over the full spectral range of 290nm to 400nm produces a figure of 264mW/m2 (the DUV), which is then divided by 25mW/m2 to give a UV Index of 10.6.|$|E

50|$|A {{relatively}} new rating designation for sun protective {{textiles and clothing}} is UPF (Ultraviolet Protection Factor), which represents the ratio of sunburn-causing UV measured without and with {{the protection of the}} fabric. For example, a fabric rated UPF 30 means that, if 30 units of UV fall on the fabric, only 1 unit will pass through to the skin. A UPF 30 fabric that blocks 29 out of 30 units of UV is therefore blocking 96.7%. Unlike SPF (Sun Protection Factor) measurements that traditionally use human sunburn testing, UPF is measured using a laboratory instrument (spectrophotometer or spectroradiometer) and an artificial light source, and then applying a sunburn weighting curve (<b>erythemal</b> action spectrum) across the relevant UV wavelengths.

40|$|Ozone {{depletion}} {{has been}} a well-researched phenomenon since its discovery in the early 1980 s. It is now scientifically accepted that if all other factors (cloudiness, turbidity, surface albedo, etc.) remain the same, decreases in stratospheric ozone concentrations provoke an increase in ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation (in the wavelength range 280 - 325 nm) at the Earthâ€™s surface. Experimental evidence also shows that exposure to UVB radiation can decrease algal productivity, and cause damage to various forms of aquatic larvae and other organisms. Biologically-effective levels of solar UV radiation penetrate water columns well, especially in the clear waters found in the Antarctic pack ice zone. To determine the relationship (if any) between increased biologically-weighted UV doses and damage to various Antarctic organisms, scientists {{need to know the}} magnitude of these increases, not only at the surface but throughout the ice and the water column. This research initially produced surface maps of levels of cloudy-sky <b>erythemal</b> UV, derived from satellite data, for the East Antarctic marginal ice zone (split into four regions for ease of presentation) for the years 1996 - 2005. Case studies of the relationships between levels of cloudy-sky <b>erythemal</b> UV (at the surface of the sea ice and ocean) and ozone, sea ice concentration and the cloud modification factor are presented by way of various analyses for a selection of sub-areas within the four regions. These analyses show that the levels of <b>erythemal</b> UV in the sub-areas are strongly affected by levels of ozone and by sea ice concentration. The results also indicate that the Shackleton and Amery regions are more affected by lower levels of ozone associated with the Antarctic ozone hole than the Mertz and Dalton regions. Trend analyses for the nine-year study period indicated significant trends for <b>erythemal</b> UV, sea ice concentration and ozone for some of the selected sub-areas. The austral spring of 2001 stood out as a period of unusually high <b>erythemal</b> UV values. To create maps of cloudy-sky <b>erythemal</b> UV radiation, the radiative transfer model UVSPEC was employed to develop a look-up table (LUT) of levels of <b>erythemal</b> UV radiation for various combinations of ozone, solar zenith angle and surface UV albedo. IDL software was then written to estimate a value of clear-sky <b>erythemal</b> UV at the Earthâ€™s surface, using the <b>erythemal</b> UV LUT, for each 5 x 5 km pixel of an Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Polar Pathfinder image for each day that AVHRR irradiance and TOMS ozone data were available for the temporal coverage of the project. The main confounding issue in the determination of <b>erythemal</b> UV radiation at the Earthâ€™s surface is the cloud cover, as this can vary not just on a daily basis but also throughout a day. The amount of cloud in a pixel was taken into account by multiplying clear-sky <b>erythemal</b> UV by a cloud modification factor based on the classification of AVHRR images using an expert system. A subsequent undertaking used the ASPeCt sea ice and snow thickness dataset to produce maps of <b>erythemal</b> UV values at predetermined depths within the sea ice and the water column. Field work completed during the SIPEX voyage to the East Antarctic sea ice zone in 2007 allowed the estimation of UVB attenuation coefficients for ice and snow â€“ these values were used, along with a known UVB attenuation coefficient for water, when determining sub-surface <b>erythemal</b> UV values. Initially, the <b>erythemal</b> UV values were calculated at 5, 10, 15 and 20 m in the water column. To take into consideration the fact that phytoplankton do not necessarily remain at a specific depth, average <b>erythemal</b> UV values over the upper 5, 10, 15 and 20 m of the water column were also calculated. <b>Erythemal</b> UV values {{at the top of the}} sea ice (beneath the snow cover), mid-way through the ice, at the bottom of the ice and at a fixed depth of 20 cm within the ice were calculated specifically for sea ice algae research. The <b>erythemal</b> UV values at the bottom of the ice were used to further calculate <b>erythemal</b> UV in the water column at the re-established depths beneath the ice (taking into account the draft of the sea ice). The sea ice concentration was incorporated into the calculations to determine pixel-averaged values of <b>erythemal</b> UV at 5, 10, 15 and 20 m depth. A final step was to use spectral biological weighting functions to develop a set of non-linear conversions between <b>erythemal</b> UV dose rate and more biologically-relevant dose rates. Including these aspects in the model allowed the <b>erythemal</b> UV values in the water column to be converted to a phytoplankton-specific dose rate, and the estimated <b>erythemal</b> UV values within a slab of sea ice to be converted to a sea-ice-algae-specific dose rate. The logistical problems of undertaking in situ research in Antarctica require alternative methods such as satellite remote sensing and radiative transfer modelling. This project has used satellite data and a radiative transfer model (RTM) to create maps of <b>erythemal</b> UV values for the study area. Further research will be required to assess (either from in situ measurements of primary production or with the use of remote sensing of ocean colour) how significant the effects of increased levels of <b>erythemal</b> UV are on the primary production of the Southern Ocean...|$|E

The exposure ratios to the legs (ratio of the UV exposure to a particular anatomical site compared to the ambient) have been measured with UV dosimeters for standing and sitting postures of a manikin. The exposure ratios for the legs ranged from 0 to 0. 75 for the different anatomical sites for the sitting posture in summer (December through February) compared to 0. 14 to 0. 39 for the standing posture.

For the anterior thigh and shin, the <b>erythemal</b> UV exposures increased by a factor of approximately 3 for sitting compared to standing postures. The exposure ratios to specific anatomical sites have been multiplied by the ambient <b>erythemal</b> UV exposures for each day to calculate the annual exposures. The annual <b>erythemal</b> exposures to the anterior thigh and ankle were predicted to be higher than 800 MED for humans sitting outdoors each day between noon and 13 : 00 h Australian Eastern Standard Time (EST). For humans standing outdoors during this time, the annual <b>erythemal</b> UV exposure averaged over each leg site was 436 MED, whereas, the averaged annual <b>erythemal</b> UV exposure was 512 MED for the sitting posture. Similarly, the annual <b>erythemal</b> UV exposure averaged over each of the sites was 173 MED for humans standing outdoors between 09 : 00 h EST and noon each Saturday morning and 205 MED for humans sitting outdoors during this time.

The results gained in this paper, for clear sky and constant ozone indicate that the sunâ€™s capability to promote the development of vitamin D in the human body does not follow the <b>erythemal</b> UV irradiances, in particular at high latitudes. For Amsterdam (52 oN) in late winter, approximately 20 % more UV is required to produce 215 J. m- 2 of vitamin D weighted UV than <b>erythemal</b> UV...|$|E
40|$|Vitamin D {{production}} in the skin by UV exposure is the most prominsing means of alleviating the worldwide burden of vitamin D deficiency. However, we demonstrate that vitamin D production cannot be quantified by the current UV Index, {{which is based on}} the <b>erythemal</b> action spectrum. Large disagreement was observed when comparing (by computer simulation) the daily levels of <b>erythemal</b> UV and UV weighted for the established vitamin D action spectrum. We suggest that by using this spectrum, and accounting for other factors that affect vitamin D UV levels, a "Vitamin D Index" could be created. This could give more appropriate UV exposure advice than the current <b>erythemal</b> UV index alone, and reduce the worldwide burden of vitamin D deficiency...|$|E
40|$|The {{increases}} in the <b>erythemal</b> UV exposures to horizontal planes and to inclined planes over three surfaces that are found in an urban environment (water, concrete and sand) due to the albedo of these surfaces have been estimated. For the cloud free case, the additional daily estimated UV exposures to a horizontal plane have a maximum value of 222 (J m- 2), where the index after the unit is there to indicate that it refers to a biologically effective exposure. In comparison, the daily <b>erythemal</b> UV exposures over a year to a horizontal plane ranged from 425 to 8, 321 (J m- 2). For a vertical receiving plane that is rotating about a vertical axis, the additional <b>erythemal</b> daily UV exposures for the sub-tropical latitude location of this research for the ranges of solar azimuth angles encountered over the days in each season ranged from 16 to 311 (J m- 2), 29 to 566 (J m- 2) and 46 to 905 (J m- 2) for water, concrete and sand respectively. The estimated error is Â± 20 % and the calculations are based on clear-sky conditions. The additional <b>erythemal</b> UV averaged over each of the seasons was higher for the receiving plane inclined at 45 degrees below the horizontal plane. In a similar fashion, the vertical surface has the higher additional <b>erythemal</b> UV exposures compared to the surfaces inclined at an angle above the horizontal...|$|E
