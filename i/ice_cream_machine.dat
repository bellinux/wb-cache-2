25|$|One {{important}} {{development in}} the 20th century was the introduction of soft ice cream, which has more air mixed in thereby reducing costs. It made possible the soft <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> <b>machine</b> in which a cone is filled beneath a spigot on order. In the United States, Dairy Queen, Carvel, and Tastee-Freez pioneered in establishing chains of soft-serve ice cream outlets.|$|E
2500|$|Not to be {{confused}} with regular ice cream of the slow, churned type which was invented in China over two millennia ago, soft serve is a distinctive type of frozen dessert that is similar to, but much softer than, ice cream. In 1938, J.F. [...] "Grandpa" [...] McCullough and his son Alex co-invented soft serve ice cream, devising a new way to serve ice cream in its soft, creamy form that it takes before going into the deep freeze to make it scoopable. After Alex McCullough commissioned Harry Oltz in 1939 to design the first soft serve <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> <b>machine,</b> similar to ones used for making frozen custard, the Dairy Queen franchise was founded when Sherb Noble opened the first store in 1940.|$|E
2500|$|In January 1943 the Army again {{acquired}} {{the ship in}} for its Southwest Pacific Area Small Ships Section of the permanent local fleet and converted some cargo space into troop accommodations. Mactan, designated with the Small Ships number S-188, was station ship in New Guinea and served as quarters and headquarters of the commanding general of the United States Army Services of Supply, Southwest Pacific Area (USASOS SWPA). Lunney notes Mactan departed [...] 8 August 1943 for Waga Waga, Milne Bay with August 1943 with two professional barbers, a chef formerly of Sydney's Hotel Carlton and a rare <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> <b>machine.</b> On 29 November 1944 Mactan left Hollandia {{for a return to}} home waters carrying the advance headquarters of USASOS SWPA where she served as quarters vessel at Tacloban, Lyete. The ship, needing extensive repairs, was retired and about to be returned to its Philippine owners on 1 September 1945 after again serving the Army as an interisland transport.|$|E
50|$|Carpigiani is an Italian company, {{located near}} Bologna, specialising in the {{production}} of <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> making <b>machines.</b> It claims control of about half of the world market for <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> <b>machines,</b> including machines both for Italian-style gelato and soft <b>ice</b> <b>cream.</b>|$|R

40|$|Carpigiani is {{the world}} leader of the <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> making market, with more than 50 % market share. Carpigiani <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> making <b>machines</b> are complex and {{high-duty}} systems which perform critical food processing operations. As {{a result of their}} heavy operational stress, <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> <b>machines</b> require expensive on-site maintenance. This paper presents Teorema, an innovative telemetry solution which enables the remote assistance of Carpigiani’s <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> making <b>machines.</b> The features provided by the Teorema platform allow to significantly reduce the need for on-site interventions and, as a consequence, after-sales services costs. Teorema also provides Carpigiani customers with a unique point of access to all their after-sales data, thereby offering them a significantly higher value in after-sales support...|$|R

50|$|Over Memorial Day {{weekend of}} 1934, Tom Carvel, {{the founder of}} the Carvel brand and franchise, {{suffered}} a flat tire in his <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> truck in Hartsdale, New York. He pulled into a parking lot and began selling his melting <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> to vacationers driving by. Within two days he had sold his entire supply of <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> and concluded that both a fixed location and soft (as opposed to hard) frozen desserts were potentially good business ideas. In 1936, Carvel opened his first store on the original broken down truck site and developed a secret soft serve <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> formula as well as patented super low temperature <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> <b>machines.</b>|$|R

50|$|Located at the Chelsea Market in New York City, Iron Chef Americas {{version of}} Kitchen Stadium {{has a more}} modern {{appearance}} than the one from Iron Chef. Much of the equipment in the kitchen is top-of-the line; appliances include six burner stove tops, an infrared grill, blast chillers, convection ovens, deep fryers, cutting boards, a plethora of small electrical appliances like blenders and food processors, as well as pantry stations. Both kitchens in Kitchen Stadium are set {{up with the same}} appliances, and each pantry station has the same food items including expensive items like saffron. Challengers may also sometimes bring their own equipment to their sections; most notably, postmodern chef Homaro Cantu brought a Class 4 Laser, liquid nitrogen, and an inkjet printer with edible inks and paper for his signature dishes. One of the most infamous appliances in the kitchen is the <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> <b>machine</b> (dubbed by the commentators as the <b>Ice</b> <b>Cream</b> <b>Machine</b> of Doom), which is often used to create unusual and abstract flavors of ice cream when chefs attempt to make a dessert course with the theme ingredient.|$|E
5000|$|The {{automation}} of milkshakes {{developed in}} the 1930s, after the invention of freon-cooled refrigerators, provided a safe, reliable way of automatically making and dispensing ice cream. In 1936, inventor Earl Prince used the basic concept behind the freon-cooled automated <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> <b>machine</b> to develop the Multimixer, a [...] "five-spindled mixer that could produce five milkshakes at once, all automatically, and dispense them at the pull of a lever into awaiting paper cups." ...|$|E
40|$|The {{delivery}} {{of high quality}} after-sales assistance in the <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> making <b>machines</b> market is particularly challenging. The cost of on-site technical support is very high and the high revenue of <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> making <b>machines</b> calls for the timely detection of failures and prompt technical support interventions. To reduce the costs and improve the efficiency of after-sales assistance operations, Carpigiani launched the highly innovative Teorema project to create a comprehensive e-maintenance platform. Teorema is already in production with hundreds of machines currently being remotely controlled, and the results obtained so far confirm the main motivations {{of the project and}} permit Carpigiani to raise its quality standard even higher...|$|R
50|$|Falkenburg {{was offered}} a $100,000-a-year {{professional}} tennis contract. He turned it down, however, and instead decided to open an <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> and fast food business in Brazil. With $10,000 and a few <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> <b>machines</b> he brought from the United States, he was set to open his <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> shop. It was not {{easy for him to}} start his business. He encountered numerous import restrictions, as the Brazilian government would not allow him to import the ingredients to make soft <b>ice</b> <b>cream.</b> He then figured out how to make his own <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> mixes and toppings. Facing many obstacles to open his business in Rio de Janeiro, Falkenburg never gave up on his idea. Very soon after opening the first <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> shop near the famed Copacabana beach front in 1952, his business became a huge success.

50|$|Ice cream was {{introduced}} to Thailand {{during the reign of}} King Rama V when the first <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> <b>machine</b> was imported to Thailand. Ice cream {{in the second half of}} the 19th century was made of coconut water blended with ice. At first, ice couldn't be produced in Thailand. That led to importing ice from Singapore. Ice cream was then an upper-class treat, but over time ice cream became more widely available and the product was improved by replacing coconut water with coconut milk.|$|E
40|$|The {{integration}} {{of information and}} communication technologies in the machines maintenance process has the goal of automating management operations, like diagnostics and prognostics, by exploiting the remote monitoring and control of manufacturing devices.
