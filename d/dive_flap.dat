25|$|Johnson {{said in his}} {{autobiography}} that he pleaded with NACA to do model tests in its wind tunnel. They already had experience of models thrashing around violently at speeds approaching those requested {{and did not want}} to risk damaging their tunnel. Gen. Arnold, head of Army Air Forces, ordered them to run the tests, which were done up to Mach 0.74. The P-38's dive problem was revealed to be the center of pressure moving back toward the tail when in high-speed airflow. The solution was to change the geometry of the wing's lower surface when diving in order to keep lift within bounds of the top of the wing. In February 1943, quick-acting <b>dive</b> <b>flaps</b> were tried and proven by Lockheed test pilots. The <b>dive</b> <b>flaps</b> were installed outboard of the engine nacelles, and in action they extended downward 35° in 1.5 seconds. The flaps did not act as a speed brake; they affected the pressure distribution in a way that retained the wing's lift.|$|R

25|$|The P-38's {{service record}} shows mixed results, which may reflect more on its {{employment}} than on flaws with the aircraft. The P-38's engine troubles at high altitudes only occurred with the Eighth Air Force. One {{reason for this}} was the inadequate cooling systems of the G and H models; the improved P-38 J and L had tremendous success flying out of Italy into Germany at all altitudes. Until the -J-25 variant, P-38s were easily avoided by German fighters {{because of the lack}} of <b>dive</b> <b>flaps</b> to counter compressibility in dives. German fighter pilots not wishing to fight would perform the first half of a Split S and continue into steep dives because they knew the Lightnings would be reluctant to follow.|$|R
50|$|In the 1930s {{and early}} 1940s, dive bombing {{was the best}} method for attacking high-value compact targets, like bridges and ships, with accuracy. The forces {{generated}} when the aircraft levels out {{at the bottom of}} the dive are considerable. The drawback of modifying and strengthening an aircraft for near-vertical dives was the loss of performance. Aside from the greater strength requirements, during normal horizontal flight, aircraft are normally designed to return to fly straight and level, but when put into a dive the changes in forces affecting the aircraft now cause the aircraft to track across the target unless the pilot applies considerable force to keep the nose down, with a corresponding decrease in accuracy. To compensate, many dive bombers were designed to be trimmed out, either through the use of special <b>dive</b> <b>flaps</b> (such as Fairey Youngman flaps) or through changes in tailplane trim that must be readjusted when the dive is completed.|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of an investigation of the aerodynamic characteristics of the NACA symmetrical laminar flow 65, 1 - 012 airfoil. The model was tested with and without a <b>dive</b> recovery <b>flap.</b> The effects obtained by suddenly extending the flap are compared to those obtained with the flap set down in position. The tests cover a range of angle of attack from zero to plus three degrees while the Mach number was varied from 0. 5 to 0. 8. The following conclusions were reached: 1. The lift curve for the airfoil with no flap is essentially a straight line. 2. A flap suddenly extended produces aerodynamic effects which are different from those produced by a flap which is set. Whenever model test results are to be used to produce design information to be incorporated in full scale aircraft, the <b>dive</b> recovery <b>flaps</b> on the model should be equivalent to those on the full scale airplane in regard to dimensional proportions and to the method and timing of operation, if a high degree of accuracy is desired.

40|$|A spin {{investigation}} {{has been conducted}} in the Langley 20 -foot free-spinning tunnel on a 1 / 24 -scale model of the North American XP- 86 airplane. The effects of control settings and movements upon the erect and inverted spin and recovery characteristics of the model were determined for the design gross weight loading. The long-range loading was also investigated {{and the effects of}} extending slats and <b>dive</b> <b>flaps</b> were determined. In addition, the investigation included the determination of the size of spin-recovery parachute required for emergency recovery from demonstration spins, the rudder force required to move the rudder for recovery, and the best method for the pilot to escape if it should become necessary to do so during a spin. The results of the investigation indicated that the XP- 86 airplane will probably recover satisfactorily from erect and inverted spins for all possible loadings. It was found that fully extending both slats would be beneficial but that extending the dive brakes would cause unsatisfactory recoveries. It was determined that a 10. 0 -foot-diameter tail parachute with a drag coefficient of 0. 7 and with a towline 30. 0 feet long attached below the jet exit or a 6. 0 -foot-diameter wingtip parachute opened on the outer wing tip with a towline 6. 0 feet long would insure recoveries from any spins obtainable. The rudder-pedal force necessary to move the rudder for satisfactory recovery was found to be within the physical capabilities of the pilot...|$|R

40|$|Behavioural {{displays}} are {{a common}} feature of animal courtship. Just as female preferences can generate exaggerated male ornaments, female preferences for dynamic behaviours may cause males to perform courtship displays near intrinsic performance limits.

Diving male Anna's hummingbirds were filmed with a combination of high-speed and conventional video cameras. After powering the initial stage of the <b>dive</b> by <b>flapping,</b> males folded their wings by their sides, at which point they reached an average maximum velocity of 385 body lengths s− 1 (27. 3 m s− 1). This is the highest known length-specific velocity attained by any vertebrate. This velocity suggests their body drag coefficient is less than 0. 3. They then spread their wings to pull up, and experienced centripetal accelerations nearly nine times greater than gravitational acceleration. This acceleration is the highest reported for any vertebrate undergoing a voluntary aerial manoeuvre, except jet fighter pilots. Stereotyped courtship behaviours offer several advantages for the study of extreme locomotor performance, and can be assessed in a natural context...|$|R

5000|$|The fastest World War II {{fighters were}} the first {{aircraft}} to experience Mach tuck. Their wings were not designed to counter Mach tuck because research on supersonic airfoils was just beginning; areas of supersonic flow, together with shock waves and flow separation, were present on the wing. This condition was known {{at the time as}} compressibility burble and was known to exist on propeller tips at high aircraft speeds. The P-38 was the first 400 mph fighter, and it suffered more than the usual teething troubles. It had a thick, high-lift wing, distinctive twin booms and a single, central nacelle containing the cockpit and armament. It quickly accelerated to terminal velocity in a dive. The short stubby fuselage had a detrimental effect in reducing the critical Mach number of the 15% thick wing center section with high velocities over the canopy adding to those on the upper surface of the wing. Mach tuck occurred at speeds above Mach 0.65; the air flow over the wing center section became transonic, causing a loss of lift. The resultant change in downwash at the tail caused a nose-down pitching moment and the dive to steepen (Mach tuck). The aircraft was very stable in this condition making recovery from the dive very difficult. <b>Dive</b> recovery (auxiliary) <b>flaps</b> were added to the underside of the wing (P-38J-LO) to increase the wing lift and downwash at the tail to allow recovery from transonic dives.|$|R
40|$|Abstract There {{is little}} {{information}} on the effort put into foraging by seabirds, {{even though it is}} fundamental to many issues in behavioural ecology. Recent researchers have used changes in the underwater cruising speed of penguins to allude to prey ingestion since accelerations are thought to reflect the encounter and pursuit of prey. In this study, we attached minute accelerometers, to determine flipper beat frequency as a proxy for prey pursuit, to Little Penguins Eudyptula minor foraging in shallow waters in Western Australia. During <b>diving,</b> Little Penguins <b>flapped</b> continuously and at a regular pace of 3. 16 Hz while descending the water column and throughout the bottom phase of most dives. However, the frequency and amplitude of wingbeats increased transitorily, reaching 3. 5 – 5. 5 Hz, during some dives indicating prey pursuit. Pursuit phases lasted a mean of 2. 9 ± 3. 3 s and occurred principally during the bottom phases of dives (75. 4 %). Most dives in all birds (86 %) had a clear square-shaped depth profile indicating feeding activity near the seabed in the shallow waters of the bays. Hourly maximum depth, time spent under-water, percentage of dives with pursuit events and catch per unit effort showed an overall increase from zero at ca. 0500 h to a maximum during the hours around mid-day before decreasing to zero by 1900 h. During pursuit phases, Little Penguins headed predominantly down-ward, probably using the seabed to assist them in trap-ping their prey. In the light of our results, we discuss depth use by Little Penguins and their allocation of foraging effort and prey capture success as a function of environmental conditions...|$|R
5000|$|On {{military}} aircraft during wartime, trim tabs often served as unintentional backup control systems for aircraft with damaged controls. Since trim tabs are usually controlled {{by their own}} dedicated system of control cables, rods, and/or hydraulic lines, aircraft that had suffered loss of primary controls could often be flown home [...] "on the trim tabs", or by using trim adjustment {{as a replacement for}} the non-working primary controls. Such control is effective, if slower and more limited than primary controls, but it does allow the aircraft to be controlled and directed. In other cases, such as an engine being shot out, or damage causing asymmetric drag, trim tabs were invaluable for allowing the pilot to fly the aircraft straight without having to apply a constant force on the stick or rudder to keep the aircraft flying straight. Trim tabs were also important for aircraft such as bombers, who often underwent rapid changes in center-of-gravity when the bombload was dropped, requiring a hand ready on the trim-adjusting wheel to counteract the tendency of the aircraft to pitch up or down. Undertaking high-speed <b>dives</b> or deploying <b>flaps</b> also generally necessitated pitch trim adjustment, as aircraft of the era had different pitch tendencies at different airspeeds, and flaps could change the center of lift. Even burning fuel off could require periodic trim adjustment during a long flight, as it was difficult to ensure that all fuel tanks were equally near the center of gravity (careful selection of various fuel tanks to ensure even consumption from all tanks helped negate this as well). An extreme example would be later P-51 Mustangs, which were given a large long-range fuel tank behind the cockpit to allow long range missions to Berlin. Since the aircraft was not designed to carry this weight so far back in the fuselage, the trim had to be adjusted far forward during the first leg of the flight, and slowly adjusted back as the fuel was used, to avoid causing excess drag, and thus excessive fuel consumption, due to a nose-high attitude on the many-hour flight to Berlin.|$|R
