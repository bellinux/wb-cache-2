5|$|According to {{the retired}} senior U.S. <b>intelligence</b> <b>official</b> {{speaking}} to Hersh, bin Laden was ill at this point, financially supported by some within Saudi Arabia, and {{kept by the}} ISI to better manage their complex relationship with Pakistani and Afghan Islamist groups. According to the official, retired CIA officials {{emphasized the importance of}} bin Laden's courier to the press, because they were nervous over torture scrutiny and possible prosecution.|$|E
5|$|Other Afghan sources {{denied any}} link to Osman. US {{military}} sources identified Norgrove's captors as Kunar Taliban, and British Foreign Secretary William Hague {{said they were}} from a Salafist group affiliated with the local Taliban, known as Jamaat al Dawa al Quran. An Afghan <b>intelligence</b> <b>official</b> later identified her captors as local commanders Mullah Basir and Mullah Keftan. Negotiations for Norgrove's release were conducted through local tribal elders.|$|E
5|$|In August 2010, {{a former}} Pakistani {{intelligence}} officer approached the U.S. embassy station chief in Islamabad {{and offered to}} reveal bin Laden's location, {{in return for the}} $25 million reward, according to a retired senior U.S. <b>intelligence</b> <b>official.</b> This story was corroborated by two U.S. intelligence officials speaking to NBC News, and had been previously reported by intelligence analyst Raelynn Hillhouse. The Pakistani official informed U.S. intelligence that bin Laden had been located by Pakistani ISI in 2006, and held under house arrest near Pakistani intelligence and military centers ever since. The official passed polygraph tests, after which the U.S. began local and satellite surveillance of bin Laden's Abbottabad residence.|$|E
50|$|U.S. State Department {{officials}} said in Congressional testimony that the State Department {{had wanted to}} revoke Abdulmutallab's visa, but <b>intelligence</b> <b>officials</b> requested that his visa not be revoked.

5|$|Norgrove {{was removed}} from the scene via {{helicopter}} and received medical care, but she died. It was reported initially that she had been killed by one of her captors setting off a suicide vest. According to The Guardian, insurgents often put on suicide vests if they think they are in danger of being attacked. Taliban commanders Mullah Basir and Mullah Keftan (who were holding Norgrove) were among those killed in the raid, according to an Afghan <b>intelligence</b> <b>official.</b> Other women and children in the compound were uninjured, and no members of the rescue team were wounded.|$|E
5|$|An <b>intelligence</b> <b>official</b> told Seymour Hersh in 2015 that no fire-fight took place. In {{the earlier}} versions, Al-Kuwaiti {{is said to}} have opened fire on the first team of SEALs with an AK-47 from behind the guesthouse door, lightly {{injuring}} a SEAL with bullet fragments. A short firefight took place between al-Kuwaiti and the SEALs, in which al-Kuwaiti was killed. His wife Mariam was allegedly shot and wounded in the right shoulder. The courier's male relative Abrar was then said to have been shot and killed by the SEALs' second team {{on the first floor of}} the main house as shots had already been fired and the SEALs thought that he was armed with a loaded AK-47 (this was later confirmed to be true in the official report). A woman near him, later identified as Abrar's wife Bushra, was in this version also shot and killed. Bin Laden's young adult son {{is said to have}} encountered the SEALs on the staircase of the main house, and to have been shot and killed by the second team. An unnamed U.S. senior defense official stated that only one of the five people killed, Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti, was armed. The interior of the house was pitch dark, because CIA operatives had cut the power to the neighborhood. However, the SEALs wore night vision goggles.|$|E

It was described by a senior Pentagon <b>intelligence</b> <b>official</b> as [...] "the single largest collection of senior terrorist materials ever."

500|$|The Hood event (...) was an {{incident}} on July 4, 2003 following the 2003 invasion of Iraq {{where a group}} of Turkish military personnel operating in northern Iraq were captured, led away with hoods over their heads, and interrogated by the United States military. American soldiers seized 15kg of explosives, sniper rifles, grenades and maps of Kirkuk, with circles drawn around positions near the governor's building when they raided Turkish offices in Sulaimaniya. The soldiers were released after sixty hours, after Turkey protested to the United States. A Kurdish <b>intelligence</b> <b>official</b> claimed that the Turkish soldiers had been linked to a plot to assassinate the newly elected governor of Kirkuk to destabilise the region so that Turkish forces would be needed to restore order.|$|E
500|$|Al-Balawi {{had been}} invited to Camp Chapman after {{claiming}} to have information related to senior al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. Al-Balawi was not searched as a sign of respect because of his perceived value as someone who could infiltrate the ranks of senior al-Qaeda leaders. A former U.S. counter-terrorism officer, as well as Jordanian government officials, said that he had already provided useful and actionable intelligence to the CIA over several weeks of undercover work in the region. A former <b>intelligence</b> <b>official</b> stated that al-Balawi was [...] "feeding us low-level operatives and we were whacking them." [...] He was seen by the CIA and the U.S. administration as the best hope of tracking down the al-Qaeda leadership. The CIA had come to trust al-Balawi and the Jordanian spy agency vouched for him, according to officials.|$|E

500|$|According to a Pakistani <b>intelligence</b> <b>official,</b> raw phone-tap data {{had been}} {{transferred}} to the U.S. without being analyzed by Pakistan. While the U.S. [...] "was concentrating on this" [...] information since September 2010, information regarding bin Laden and the compound's inhabitants had [...] "slipped from" [...] Pakistan's [...] "radar" [...] over the months. Bin Laden left [...] "an invisible footprint" [...] and {{he had not been}} contacting other militant networks. It was noted that much focus had been placed on a courier entering and leaving the compound. The transfer of intelligence to the U.S. was a regular occurrence according to the official, who also stated regarding the raid that [...] "I think they came in undetected and went out the same day", and Pakistan did not believe that U.S. personnel were present in the area before the special operation occurred.|$|E
500|$|A U.S. <b>intelligence</b> <b>official</b> {{said the}} danger of using {{informants}} was inherent but unavoidable. Intelligence agencies {{have to rely on}} unsavory individuals to penetrate terrorist groups because no one else has the access. Those hazards would be neither denied nor ignored by the CIA officers. Former intelligence officials said they were deeply troubled about al-Balawi's ability to get close to so many CIA officers. A former agency case officer expressed surprise that [...] "a potential hostile" [...] was able to be in immediate proximity to a large number of CIA operatives. [...] "Why the officers would show a source all their faces, that alone was a terrible decision," [...] said one former senior CIA paramilitary operative who served in Afghanistan. Larry C. Johnson, a former CIA officer and counter-terrorism agent, said that a source supposedly as significant as al-Balawi should never have been brought inside the base, because it risked exposing him.|$|E
500|$|After {{the initial}} push into Fallujah, the US argued that Zarqawi was behind {{a series of}} car bombings {{throughout}} Iraq. [...] There had been no large car bombings in Baghdad during the siege, and enough munitions and contraband had been uncovered to conclude that many [...] "bombs and car bombs detonated elsewhere in Iraq may have been manufactured in Fallujah." [...] In contrast, there were 30 large car bombs in the two months following {{the creation of the}} Fallujah Brigade, and the Brigade was now seen by the US and Iraqi governments as a front for the insurgency. The suicide bombings and the hostage videos made Zarqawi the public face of the Iraqi insurgency in 2004, even though his leadership was disputed by many Sunni nationalist commanders. By late 2004 the US government's bounty on his head matched Osama bin Laden's. However, a senior US military <b>intelligence</b> <b>official</b> described the core of the insurgency in December 2004 as [...] "the old Sunni oligarchy using religious nationalism as a motivating force." ...|$|E
