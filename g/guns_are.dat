5|$|On Lombok, Wallace observes how <b>guns</b> <b>are</b> made, {{witnessing}} the boring of gun barrels {{by two men}} rotating a pole which is weighted down by a basket of stones. He describes the Sasak people of the island, and the custom of running amok.|$|E
5|$|The note further elaborates {{that unlike}} {{the rest of}} the EU, where most <b>guns</b> <b>are</b> owned for hunting, the vast {{majority}} of Czech gun owners possess firearms suitable for protection of life, health and property, explicitly mentioning, inter alia, semi-automatic rifles (which are subject to the proposed EU Gun Ban, see above).|$|E
5|$|For example, if {{one assumes}} that the economy's {{available}} quantities of factors of production do not change over time and that technological progress does not occur, if the economy is operating on the PPF, production of guns {{would need to be}} sacrificed to produce more butter. If production is efficient, the economy can choose between combinations (points) on the PPF: B if <b>guns</b> <b>are</b> of interest, C if more butter is needed, D if an equal mix of butter and guns is required.|$|E
2500|$|... 57 55 J was {{accepted}} {{for use as}} training weapon in 1950s {{because of a lack}} of suitable training guns and no funds to buy new ones. The old 57mm Nordenfelt and Hotchkiss <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> worn-out, and 76mm <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> kept in reserve, so 57 55 J, among other old <b>guns,</b> <b>was</b> used as training piece. Some of the <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> converted for sub-caliber training for the 234/50 Be and 305/52 O <b>guns.</b> The <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> refurbished at beginning of the 1960s and sub-caliber <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> converted back to the normal configuration, but the <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> removed from use and placed into storage in 1965–1966.|$|R
50|$|Two of the 5.5-inch <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> {{mounted on}} the {{centreline}} fore and aft of the superstructure and the remaining eight <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> positioned on the broadside. All these <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> fitted with <b>gun</b> shields. Two Vickers 3-pounder (47 mm) anti-aircraft <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> also fitted. The armament was completed by two submerged 21-inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes.|$|R
50|$|She was {{initially}} armed with two Armstrong 254 mm rifled muzzle-loading (RML) guns mounted {{in a single}} turret. In 1875 a pair of 76 mm RML <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> added. Four years later a pair of 87 mm rifled breech-loading <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> also added and four more 87-millimeter <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> added in 1889. Two years later a pair of quick-firing (QF) 57 mm Hotchkiss <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> added. The 254-millimeter <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> ultimately replaced {{by a pair of}} QF 150 mm guns.|$|R
5|$|In {{military}} usage, soldiers often either exchange their disruptively-patterned summer uniforms for thicker snow camouflage uniforms {{printed with}} mainly-white versions of camouflage patterns in winter, or they wear white overalls over their uniforms. Some armies have {{made use of}} reversible uniforms, printed in different seasonal patterns on their two sides. Vehicles and <b>guns</b> <b>are</b> often simply repainted in white. Occasionally, aircraft too are repainted in snow camouflage patterns.|$|E
5|$|Light {{guns were}} {{suppressed}} {{for a time}} in the United States after the 1999 Columbine High School massacre and its attendant controversy over video games and gun crime. Since the late 1980s light gun controllers have been generally manufactured to look like toys by painting them in bright colours. In Japan, which lacks the gun crime found in the United States and in which civilians cannot legally own guns, more realistic light <b>guns</b> <b>are</b> widely available.|$|E
5|$|These <b>guns</b> <b>are</b> {{air-cooled}} {{and use a}} gas blow-back recoil system. Unlike other automatic guns employed during World War II, {{the barrel}} of the 20mm Oerlikon gun does not recoil; the breechblock is never locked against the breech and is actually moving forward when the gun fires. This weapon lacks a counter-recoil brake, as the force of the counter-recoil is checked by recoil from the firing of the next round of ammunition.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Possibly {{the oldest}} {{surviving}} firearm in Europe, the Loshult <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> discovered in 1861 by a farmer in a Swedish parish, which the <b>gun</b> <b>is</b> named after. The Loshult <b>gun</b> <b>is</b> dated to the mid 14th century, 1330-50.|$|R
500|$|... all of {{her main}} deck guns, six 6-inch and four 12-pounder <b>guns,</b> <b>were</b> removed and their casemates plated over. In {{addition}} {{all of her}} QF 2.5-pounder <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> removed and a single 8cm/40 3rd Year Type anti-aircraft <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> added.|$|R
50|$|The Gatling <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> {{first used}} in warfare during the American Civil War. Twelve of the <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> {{purchased}} personally by Union commanders {{and used in}} the trenches during the siege of Petersburg, Virginia (June 1864 - April 1865). Eight other Gatling <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> fitted on gunboats. The <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> not accepted by the American Army until 1866, when a sales representative of the manufacturing company demonstrated it in combat.|$|R
5|$|Guardian {{operates}} {{with five}} trains, each containing two cars that were manufactured by Art Engineering. Each car seats four riders back-to-back in seated rows; each train can seat eight riders. Every seat has a lap-bar restraint, a light gun, and a loudspeaker that provides sound during the ride. This configuration allows {{the ride to}} theoretically carry 650 riders per hour. The cars can rotate 90 degrees in both directions. The trains' light <b>guns</b> <b>are</b> programmed to display a unique colour on the ride's screens to indicate where each rider is shooting and to distinguish between shooters.|$|E
5|$|House of the Dead 4 Special (2006) {{featuring}} large screens enclosing the player, {{as well as}} swivelling, vibrating chairs. Some games {{attempted to}} incorporate elements of first person shooter or survival horror games {{through the use of}} less restricted character movement and exploration, with varying degrees of success. Others, however, unashamedly paid homage to 1990s arcade gameplay, even embracing a somewhat parodic style. Light <b>guns</b> <b>are</b> not compatible with modern high-definition televisions, leading developers to experiment with hybrid controllers, particularly with the Wii Remote for the Wii, as well as the PlayStation 3's GunCon 3 peripheral used with Time Crisis 4. Others have used the PlayStation Move motion control system.|$|E
5|$|In 1924, John Ingle, {{the former}} captain of Pegasus, was tasked with {{clearing}} wrecks from the harbor in Dar es Salaam. At that time, {{he bought the}} salvage rights to Königsberg {{for the price of}} £200; he sent divers to extract non-ferrous scrap metal from the wreck and in turn sold the rights. Salvage work continued into the 1930s, and by the 1940s the hull had rolled over to her starboard side. As late as 1965, salvage work continued, but in 1966 the wreck collapsed and finally sank into the riverbed. Three of the ship's 10.5cm <b>guns</b> <b>are</b> preserved, one in Pretoria, South Africa, one in Jinja, Uganda, and one in Mombasa, along with a gun from Pegasus.|$|E
500|$|When {{the ship}} was being {{refitted}} from 1891–94, her anti-torpedo boat armament was reinforced by the replacement of three 25.4-millimeter Nordenfelt guns {{by a pair of}} 2.5-pounder Hotchkiss guns and a single 3-pounder Hotchkiss gun. Two additional 11-millimeter Nordenfelt guns in the fighting tops were also added at that time. After the Sino-Japanese War, a small poop deck was added in 1896 and a quick-firing (QF) [...] <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> mounted there as the stern chase gun. Another such <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> mounted on the forecastle as the forward chase gun and the two 17-centimeter <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> replaced by another pair of 12-centimeter quick-firers. In addition twelve 3-pounder Hotchkiss <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> added and the 11-millimeter <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> replaced by 25.4-millimeter Nordenfelts. In March 1900 the 12-centimeter chase <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> superseded by two QF [...] guns and the former chase <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> shifted to make room for them. The final change to Fusōs armament was made in July 1906 when her obsolete 24-centimeter <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> replaced by two QF 15-centimeter guns and two more 3-pounders were added.|$|R
500|$|Ne Tron Menia was {{completed}} with seventeen [...] rifled <b>guns.</b> Fifteen <b>were</b> {{mounted on the}} broadside on the main deck and two <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> placed in pivot mounts on the upper deck to serve as chase guns. One of the main deck <b>guns</b> <b>was</b> removed and a [...] 60-pounder smoothbore <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> added on the upper deck in 1868.|$|R
50|$|The 152 mm siege gun model 1910 (152-мм осадная пушка образца 1910 года) <b>was</b> a heavy <b>gun</b> {{used by the}} Russian Army in World War I. The <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> {{designed}} by the French arms manufacturer Schneider and the first prototype was evaluated in Russia in 1909-10. A total of 73 <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> ordered from the Putilov Plant in 1912. However, only 51 <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> delivered {{by the end of}} the Civil War. A further 49 <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> ordered by the Red Army Artillery Administration in 1926 and 1928. All usable <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> upgraded to 152 mm gun M1910/30 in the early 1930s.|$|R
5|$|In June 2010 diving {{operations}} {{were carried out}} and the survey report indicated that the aircraft was largely complete, although 5K+AR lay inverted on the seabed, indicating that it ground-looped on landing. The port rudder, starboard stabiliser, forward nose glazing, undercarriage doors and engine cowling were missing, but {{the discovery of a}} small debris field associated with the wreck indicates that some or all of those parts may still be present at the site. Some items, including two of the Dornier's six MG 15 machine <b>guns,</b> <b>are</b> missing and are believed to have been stolen by unauthorized divers sometime after the aircraft's discovery.|$|E
5|$|Most Shogunate troops used Büchse (Gewehr) smoothbore guns, {{which had}} been {{imported}} in Japan since around 1840, initially from the Netherlands by Takashima Akiho. These guns were rather ancient and had limited capabilities, with an effective lethal range of about 50 meters, and a firing rate of about 2 rounds per minute. The daimyō of Nagaoka however, an ally of the Shogun, possessed two Gatling guns and several thousand modern rifles. The Shogunate {{is known to have}} placed an order for 30,000 modern Dreyse needle guns in 1866. Napoleon III provided Tokugawa Yoshinobu with 2,000 state-of-the-art Chassepot rifles, which he used to equip his personal guard. Antiquated Tanegashima matchlock <b>guns</b> <b>are</b> also known to have been used by the Bakufu however.|$|E
5|$|The MP 40 submachine <b>guns</b> <b>are</b> open-bolt, blowback-operated {{automatic}} arms. The only mode of {{fire was}} fully automatic, but {{the relatively low}} rate of fire enabled single shots with controlled trigger pulls. The bolt features a telescoping return spring guide {{which serves as a}} pneumatic recoil buffer. The cocking handle was permanently attached to the bolt on early MP 38s, but on late production MP 38s and MP 40s, the bolt handle was made as a separate part. It also served as a safety by pushing the head of handle into one of two separate notches above the main opening; this action locked the bolt either in the cocked (rear) or uncocked (forward) position. The absence of this feature on early MP 38s resulted in field expedients such as leather harnesses with a small loop, used to hold the bolt in forward position.|$|E
50|$|The {{resulting}} <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> {{adopted as}} 122-mm howitzer M1909/37. About 800-900 old M1909 <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> upgraded to the M1909/37 standard.|$|R
50|$|She was {{initially}} armed with two Armstrong 227 mm rifled muzzle-loading (RML) guns mounted {{in a single}} turret. In 1876 a pair of 76 mm RML <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> added. Four years later a pair of 87 mm rifled breech-loading <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> also added and the 76-millimeter <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> replaced by another pair of 87-millimeter breech-loading guns in 1885. The 227-millimeter <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> ultimately replaced {{by a pair of}} quick-firing 150 mm guns.|$|R
5000|$|In the episodes, the <b>gun(s)</b> <b>were</b> used by Napoleon Solo and Illya Kuryakin. The <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> {{extremely}} popular with viewers. MGM {{began to get}} fan mail addressed to [...] "The Gun." [...] At one point the <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> getting 500 letters per week. A US Army Ordinance General once asked if {{a few of the}} <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> available, he would like to borrow them for testing as possible weapons for the armed forces.|$|R
5|$|Their service {{records have}} added to their fame, ranging from their work as carrier escorts in World War II to their shore {{bombardment}} duties in North Korea, North Vietnam, and the Middle East, {{as well as their}} service in the Cold War against the expanded Soviet Navy. Their reputation combined with the stories told concerning the firepower of these battleships' 16-inch <b>guns</b> <b>are</b> such that when they were brought out of retirement in the 1980s in response to increased Soviet Naval activity—and in particular, in response to the commissioning of the s—the United States Navy was inundated with requests from former sailors pleading for a recall to active duty so they could serve aboard one of the battleships.|$|E
5|$|The {{weakness}} of the breech-loader was the obvious problem of sealing the breech. All <b>guns</b> <b>are</b> powered by the explosive conversion of a solid propellant into gas. This explosion propels the shot or shell {{out of the front}} of the gun, but also imposes great stresses on the gun-barrel. If the breech—which experiences some of the greatest forces in the gun—is not entirely secure, then there is a risk that either gas will discharge through the breech or that the breech will break. This in turn reduces the muzzle velocity of the weapon and can also endanger the gun crew. Warriors Armstrong guns suffered from both problems; the shells were unable to penetrate the 4.5in (118mm) armor of Gloire, while sometimes the screw which closed the breech flew backwards out of the gun on firing. Similar problems were experienced with the breech-loading guns which became standard in the French and German navies.|$|E
5|$|While Lee Adama (Jamie Bamber) and a newly {{returned}} Kara Thrace (Katee Sackhoff) head to Galactica, {{the advancing}} Cylons destroy one ship and damage others, {{killing at least}} 600. After discovering their true identities, Cylons Saul Tigh (Michael Hogan), Tory Foster (Rekha Sharma), Samuel Anders (Michael Trucco), and Galen Tyrol (Aaron Douglas) continue their jobs. Tigh is ordered to send every Viper to defend the fleet, but has a vision where he assassinates Admiral Adama (Edward James Olmos) before carrying it out. New Viper pilot Anders is sent out, worried a hidden Cylon program would activate and make him turn against the fleet. His <b>guns</b> <b>are</b> unresponsive while targeting a Raider. As Anders and the Raider come face-to-face, the Raider scans Anders, and in doing so, Anders' iris momentarily glows red. In response to this, the Raider flips direction and it, {{along with all the}} other Raiders, immediately stop the attack and retreat to their basestar and jump away, much to the surprise of the fleet.|$|E
50|$|In 1913 {{an initial}} order of 471 <b>guns</b> <b>was</b> placed with OSP. By 1 January 1917 143 <b>guns</b> had <b>been</b> delivered, with 96 due {{until the end}} of that year. The {{remaining}} 282 <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> supposed to be delivered in 1918. The first charge of <b>guns</b> <b>was</b> used to equipped the cruiser Svetlana and the Imperatritsa Mariya-class battleships of the Black Sea Fleet.|$|R
50|$|Ne Tron Menia was {{completed}} with seventeen 8 in rifled <b>guns.</b> Fifteen <b>were</b> {{mounted on the}} broadside on the main deck and two <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> placed in pivot mounts on the upper deck to serve as chase guns.
