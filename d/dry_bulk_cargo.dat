25|$|Like {{all of the}} Great Lakes, Lake Michigan {{is today}} used as a major mode of {{transport}} for bulk goods. In 2002, 162 million net tons of <b>dry</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>cargo</b> were moved via the Lakes. This was, in order of volume: iron ore, grain and potash. The iron ore {{and much of the}} stone and coal are used in the steel industry. There is also some shipping of liquid and containerized cargo, but most container vessels cannot pass the locks on the Saint Lawrence Seaway because the ships are too wide. The total amount of shipping on the lakes has been on a downward trend for several years.|$|E

30|$|The {{economic}} crisis had an immediate effect on sea transport, {{which accounts for}} more than 40  % of world exports of transportation services. As the global demand for goods declined, the demand for sea transportation services, mainly freight transport, fell significantly. The Baltic Dry Index (which is a daily average of prices for shipping of raw commodities in <b>dry</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>cargoes</b> on different international shipping routes, measuring the changes in the cost of transporting raw commodities by sea. The index fluctuates according to the shift in world demand for raw materials. Declining demand resulting in lower transportation prices will push the index downwards while increased demand will lift the index), reached a record level in Spring 2008, reflecting a high demand for raw materials. However, by December it had dropped by 94  % [9].|$|R
