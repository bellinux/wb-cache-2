In 1887, four years previously, Heinrich Hertz had discovered <b>Hertzian</b> <b>waves</b> (radio waves), electromagnetic waves which oscillated at very high frequencies. This attracted much attention, {{and a number of}} researchers began experimenting with high frequency currents.|$|E
25|$|The {{apparent}} {{need for}} a propagation medium for such <b>Hertzian</b> <b>waves</b> {{can be seen by}} the fact that they consist of perpendicular electric (E) and magnetic (B or H) waves. The E waves consist of undulating dipolar electric fields, and all such dipoles appeared to require separated and opposite electric charges. Electric charge is an inextricable property of matter, so it appeared that some form of matter was required to provide the alternating current that would seem to have to exist at any point along the propagation path of the wave. Propagation of waves in a true vacuum would imply the existence of electric fields without associated electric charge, or of electric charge without associated matter. Albeit compatible with Maxwell's equations, electromagnetic induction of electric fields could not be demonstrated in vacuum, because all methods of detecting electric fields required electrically charged matter.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the end of}} 1894, {{the young}} Italian {{inventor}} Guglielmo Marconi began working {{on the idea of}} building a commercial wireless telegraphy system based on the use of <b>Hertzian</b> <b>waves</b> (radio waves), a line of inquiry that he noted other inventors {{did not seem to be}} pursuing. Building on the ideas of previous scientists and inventors Marconi re-engineered their apparatus by trial and error attempting to build a radio based wireless telegraphic system that would function the same as wired telegraphy. He would work on the system through 1895 in his lab and then in field tests making improvements to extend its range. After many breakthroughs, including applying the wired telegraphy concept of grounding the transmitter and receiver, Marconi was able, by early 1896, to transmit radio far beyond the short ranges that had been predicted. Having failed to interest the Italian government, the 22-year-old inventor brought his telegraphy system to Britain in 1896 and met William Preece, a Welshman, who was a major figure in the field and Chief Engineer of the General Post Office. A series of demonstrations for the British government followed—by March 1897, Marconi had transmitted Morse code signals over a distance of about [...] across Salisbury Plain.|$|E

Between 1886 and 1888, Heinrich Rudolf Hertz published {{the results of his}} experiments where he was able to transmit electromagnetic waves (radio waves) through the air, proving James Clerk Maxwell's 1873 theory of electromagnetic radiation.

5000|$|Tesla's {{design for}} Wardenclyffe {{grew out of}} his {{experiments}} begun in the early 1890s. His primary goal in these experiments {{was to develop a}} new wireless power transmission system. He discarded the idea of using the newly discovered <b>Hertzian</b> (radio) <b>waves,</b> detected in 1888 by German physicist Heinrich Rudolf Hertz since Tesla doubted they existed and basic physics told him, and most other scientists from that period, that they would only travel in straight lines the way visible light did, meaning they would travel straight out into space becoming [...] "hopelessly lost". In laboratory work and later large scale experiments at Colorado Springs in 1899, Tesla developed his own ideas on how a worldwide wireless system would work. He theorized from these experiments that if he injected electric current into the Earth at just the right frequency he could harness what he believed was the planet's own electrical charge and cause it to resonate at a frequency that would be amplified in [...] "standing waves" [...] that could be tapped anywhere on the planet to run devices or, through modulation, carry a signal. His system was based more on 19th century ideas of electrical conduction and telegraphy instead of the newer theories of air-borne electromagnetic waves, with an electrical charge being conducted through the ground and being returned through the air. Tesla's design used a concept of a charged conductive upper layer in the atmosphere, a theory dating back to an 1872 idea for a proposed wireless power system by Mahlon Loomis. Tesla not only believed that he could use this layer as his return path in his electrical conduction system, but that the power flowing through it would make it glow, providing night time lighting for cities and shipping lanes.|$|R
