However, various weaknesses limit the potential of existing provisions and arguably facilitate corporate opacity.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the regulation of}} trades in listed securities by external administrators (EAs), such as trustees in bankruptcy, liquidators, receivers, and administrators {{on the basis of}} private information. We consider the economic policy issues associated with such trades. The principal considerations counsel in favour of taking a permissive approach. These are: the difficulties of associating trades with insider information, given the EA's necessarily short expected holding period, the asymmetric application of the insider trading prohibition to sales (rather than decisions not to sell), the market incentives not to misuse private information that apply to EAs, and the unlikelihood that the EA has monopolistic access to the information in question. We consider these considerations by reference to a number of hypothetical scenarios. The paper argues that the law should regulate the subject by coupling a broad exemption for EAs with a "goiod faith" proviso, a continuous <b>disclosure</b> <b>obligation,</b> and a requirement to sell "all or nothing" of a holding of listed securities...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of information during {{the existence of}} a commercial relationship is widely accepted. However, the extent to which disclosure of information is mandated, or the mechanism which is used to achieve disclosure of information, depends on the particular legal discipline. Corporate law, for example, attempts to achieve disclosure through the statutory doctrine of continuous disclosure. Contract law provides a different mechanism and courts have historically used good faith to ensure disclosure of information, ultimately leading to the duty to act in utmost good faith. This article provides an overview and analysis of these different mechanisms, and proposes that the concept of good faith could fulfil a valuable, complementary function in the context of continuous disclosure in the corporate law arena.

40|$|Indexation {{of credit}} to {{inflation}} (ex-post) is a unique legal practice in Iceland based on valorism theory on money vs. nominalism. Two rulings issued in 2014 by the EFTA Court try to clarify the legality and fairness of this particular price-variation clause under the European Economic Area consumer credit acquis. The study summarizes the rulings and analyses critically the interpretation provided by the court. It argues that the judgements defy the logic of non-contradiction since indexation of credit proves to be an impossible oxymoron under EU/EEA law. The results are confusing. On one hand, cost of credit and usury practices tend to fall {{outside the scope of}} European harmonisation (provided <b>disclosure</b> <b>obligation</b> of cost of credit and transparency ex-ante are respected). A fairness control is thus dependent on national and case circumstances to be assessed by domestic courts. On the other hand, European rules also impose with no derogations that the cost of indexation {{of credit to}} inflation is disclosed in a transparent way and calculated ex-ante. The paradox is there. Since indexation of credit operates ex-post on the basis of real inflation, it is impossible to disclose ex-ante in a transparent way. The findings of the study help to understand the situation of impasse in Iceland. Without a clear interpretation from the EFTA Court, the saga has continued at national level and will probably head for a second round of assessment at European level. ...|$|R
