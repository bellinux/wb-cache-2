40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationships}} subsisting between {{the operations of}} <b>discount</b> <b>houses</b> and the performance indices of the money market and the general economy.

Thus, the operations of these houses reserve the potentials to boost the performances of the money market and the economy considerably. This calls for policy options that would favor the encouragement of existing houses and licensing of new ones to adequately carter for the needs of the overall economy...|$|R
