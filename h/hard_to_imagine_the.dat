From here Blea Crag can be outflanked on either side to arrive on the summit ridge to the east or west of the summit.

[...] He called the addition of Michael Cutter was [...] "a big gain" [...] for the show, but felt uncertain about the addition of Detective Rollins, writing: [...] "A scene in which she tried to sweet-talk information out of a jailed suspect was the one really weak moment in the episode." [...] TVfanatic.com also had mixed feeling about Detective Rollins, who is [...] supposed to breathe new life into the series, but wrote that Rollins may end up becoming an interesting character.|$|E

According to Levine, the song is her best vocal performances and shows Rihanna growing {{in front of the}} audience's eyes. Will Hines of Consequence of Sound called the song a worth centerpiece and further wrote that it stands out from other tracks on the album which proves that Rated R [...] "was a cathartic process for the singer". Todd Martens of Los Angeles Times wrote that although is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>the</b> song to be played in a car or a club, it's [...] "attention-grabbing stuff, standing in stark—emphasis on stark—contrast to much of the current pop landscape."

Darwin's On the Origin of Species, published in 1859, gave it a firm scientific basis. A weakness of Darwin's work, however, was the lack of palaeontological evidence, as pointed out by Darwin himself. While it is easy <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> natural selection producing the variation seen within genera and families, the transmutation between the higher categories was <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine.</b> <b>The</b> dramatic find of the London specimen of Archaeopteryx in 1861, only two years after the publication of Darwin's work, offered for the first time a link between the class of the highly derived birds, and that of the more primitive reptiles.

[...] Referring to the [...] "dark, tragic and passionate" [...] nature of the concerto, Einstein states that [...] "it is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>the</b> expression {{on the faces of}} the Viennese public" [...] when Mozart premiered the work. The musicologist Simon P. Keefe, in an exegesis of all of Mozart's piano concertos, writes that the No. 24 is [...] "a climactic and culminating work in Mozart's piano concerto oeuvre, firmly linked to its predecessors, yet decisively transcending them at the same time." [...] The verdict of the Mozart scholar Alexander Hyatt King is that the concerto is [...] "not only the most sublime of the whole series but also one of the greatest pianoforte concertos ever composed". Arthur Hutchings's view is that [...] "whatever value we put upon any single movement from the Mozart concertos, we shall find no work greater as a concerto than this K. 491, for Mozart never wrote a work whose parts were so surely those of 'one stupendous whole'." ...|$|E
500|$|There {{was also}} {{considerable}} {{mention of the}} evolution of Underwood's relationship with Claire. [...] "heir partnership has morphed into an entirely professional exercise, with a shared lust for power having supplanted more conventional matrimonial bonds," [...] wrote Brian Lowry of Variety. The Atlantics Spencer Kornhaber remarked, however, that the utter ruthlessness displayed by Underwoods in the season finale may have represented a [...] "jump the shark" [...] moment for the series: The Underwoods have murdered a politician and a journalist, and some innocents have also been collateral damage to their activities. Now, though, they've set out to maintain their power at the cost of mass casualties. Netflix hasn't said how many seasons are to come, but it's <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>the</b> show being watchable for all that much longer now that this rubicon of despicability has been crossed.Some compared Underwood's story line in season 4 to the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Brian Moyland of The Guardian wrote: House of Cards has never felt like the real presidency: Frank Underwood is evil incarnate, bumping off junior Congressmen and pushing journalists in front of trains. But now that, in real life, we're in the throes of such a bizarre presidential race, his machinations are starting to look almost viable. There are several parallels between Underwood's re-election campaign and the 2016 campaigns of Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders.|$|E
500|$|Upon Eraserhead release, Variety {{offered a}} {{negative}} review, calling it [...] "a sickening bad-taste exercise". The review expressed incredulity over the film's long gestation and described its finale as unwatchable. Comparing Eraserhead to Lynch's next film The Elephant Man, Tom Buckley of The New York Times felt {{that while the}} latter was a well-made film with an accomplished cast, the former was not. Buckley called Eraserhead [...] "murkily pretentious", and felt that the film's horror aspects stemmed solely from {{the appearance of the}} deformed child rather than from its script or performances. Writing in 1984, Lloyd Rose of The Atlantic felt that Eraserhead demonstrated that Lynch was [...] "one of the most unalloyed surrealists ever to work in the movies". Rose described the film as being intensely personal, finding that unlike previous surrealist films, such as Luis Buñuel's 1929 work Un Chien Andalou or 1930's L'Age d'Or, Lynch's imagery [...] "isn't reaching out to us from his films; we're sinking into them". In a 1993 review for the Chicago Tribune, Michael Wilmington described Eraserhead as unique, feeling that the film's [...] "intensity" [...] and [...] "nightmare clarity" [...] were a result of Lynch's attention to detail in its creation due to his involvement in so many roles during its production. In the 1995 essay Bad Ideas: The Art and Politics of Twin Peaks, critic Jonathan Rosenbaum felt that Eraserhead represented Lynch's best work. Rosenbaum felt that the director's artistic talent declined as his popularity grew, and contrasted the film with Wild at Heart—Lynch's most recent feature film at that time—saying [...] "even the most cursory comparison of Eraserhead with Wild at Heart reveals an artistic decline so precipitous that it is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>the</b> same person making both films".|$|E

40|$|Hyperventilation {{is often}} {{conceived}} of {{as part of a}} fight-or-flight response, triggered by situations with high arousal and negative valence. However, a previous study using emotional imagery found hyperventilation responses during imagery of high-arousal scenes regardless of their valence. Those imagery scripts contained suggestions of autonomic activity, which may have partly induced or enhanced the hyperventilatory responsivity. The present study used four emotional scripts [...] depicting relaxing, fearful, depressive, and pleasant situations [...] without suggestions of autonomic or respiratory responses. After each imagery trial, participants rated their imagery for valence, arousal, and vividness. Fractional end-tidal carbon dioxide (FetCO 2), inspiratory and expiratory time, tidal volume, and pulse rate were measured in a non-intrusive way. Results showed significant FetCO 2 drops during the fearful and pleasant scripts. However, this effect was much smaller compared to imagery scripts with autonomic response propositions.

The Vicar had vacillated between a project of driving the Angel into Portbroddock and getting him measured for a suit, and his absolute horror of the insinuating manners of the tailor he employed. He knew that tailor would demand an exhaustive explanation. Besides which, one never knew when the Angel might leave. So the six days had passed, and the Angel had grown steadily in the wisdom of this world and shrouded his brightness still in the ample retirement of the Vicar's newest clothes.|$|E

That {{the young man was}} well was beyond dispute, since she had seen him with her own eyes at the opera. What {{explanation}} could there be, then, for his conduct? Was it possible that he had told Mr. Girdlestone of their engagement, and that her guardian had found some means of dissuading him from continuing his suit--found some appeal to his interest, perhaps, which was too strong for his love. All that she knew of Tom's nature contradicted such a supposition. Again, if Girdlestone had learned anything of their engagement, surely he would have reproached her with it. His manner of late had been kinder rather than harsher. On the other hand, could it have chanced that Tom had met this lady of the opera, and that her charms had proved too much for his constancy?
