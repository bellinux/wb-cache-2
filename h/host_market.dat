40|$|This paper empirically {{examines}} how a <b>host</b> nation's <b>market</b> characteristics, particularly its market maturity and {{role as an}} export platform, affect the amount of inward FDI it receives and its FDI - bilateral trade relationship with the FDI source. For the period 1989  -  1999, using Japanese outward FDI into 85 geographically and developmentally diverse countries, we find a positive and significant relationship between FDI inflows and the <b>host's</b> <b>market</b> maturity levels. However, the FDI - trade interaction between the host and the FDI source appears to vary inversely with the <b>host</b> country's <b>market</b> maturity level. In addition, after controlling for the <b>host's</b> <b>market</b> maturity, {{we find that the}} nature of the host's 'export platform' status also significantly impacts both inward FDI flows and the FDI - trade relationship.

40|$|The {{immigrant}} effect {{consists of}} the 'employer' and the 'employee' effect. This study focuses on the 'employee' effect. Existing studies on the immigrant effect have identified its contributions to international trade and international marketing management but have not explained under what circumstances this effect {{can be used to}} achieve a firm's objectives when operating in a foreign market. This study explores the profile of the firms which have used this effect to assist their operations in three foreign <b>host</b> <b>markets</b> (China, Hong Kong and Taiwan). Based on the outcomes of a multivariate logistic regression analysis, this study has generated a number of useful findings. Firm size is not suggested as a factor for the selection of immigrant effects. Firms are more likely to adopt an immigrant effect when their products are new to the markets. FDI mode users tend to be more likely to use the immigrant effect. Usage of immigrant effects is also found to be associated with firms from a smaller domestic economy. The immigrant effect is often used to break cultural barriers between home and <b>host</b> <b>markets,</b> but is more helpful when the marketing infrastructure in the home and <b>host</b> <b>markets</b> is similar. The choice of immigrant effect is suggested to have no influence on firms' performance in the <b>host</b> <b>markets.</b> Immigrant effect Australia New Zealand Greater China Emerging markets...|$|R

We highlight that the documented valuation premium for listing on U. S. exchanges is not unique but common to many home and <b>host</b> <b>markets</b> including U. S. firms that list abroad. The cross-sectional variation in the valuation premium appears to have little association with any unique institutional features of the market; rather the premium is related to variation in pre-listing valuation ratios. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} decade, {{hundreds}} of companies from emerging markets have listed their shares on American and European stock markets. Brazil, Russia, India, and China (BRIC) {{are the main}} countries of origin of issuers, and stock exchanges in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Luxembourg are the main destinations involved in the process. We use a comprehensive data set for these home and <b>host</b> <b>markets</b> {{for the end of}} 2008 to explore the intensity of foreign listings, the subnational geography of cross-listed firms, and the destinations of foreign listings. Cross-listing firms tend to be relatively large and come from capital-intensive, export-oriented, and high-growth sectors. Trading links with and industrial specialization of the <b>host</b> <b>markets</b> affect the choice of destination markets. These patterns, however, are not universal across countries. There is a high concentration of cross-listed firms in the leading financial centers of the BRIC countries, particularly in Russia and Brazil. Firms outside of the leading centers rarely cross-list, and when they do, they enter second-tier <b>host</b> <b>markets.</b> While BRIC countries have a large potential for further foreign listings, the process remains politically sensitive. Our results highlight the shortcomings of the literature on cross-listing in economics and the significance of the cross-listing phenomenon to future research in financial geographies.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is guided}} by three research questions. First, how does <b>host</b> <b>market</b> corruption impact the equity-based market entry strategies implemented by multinational enterprises (MNEs) {{with respect to their}} foreign subsidiary investments? Second, does <b>host</b> <b>market</b> corruption increase the likelihood of market exit? Third, can MNEs implement strategies which reduce the likelihood of market exit under conditions of more pervasive <b>host</b> <b>market</b> corruption? In the first essay, I synthesize insights from institutional theory and integrative social contracts theory to dis-aggregate the concept of government corruption into two dimensions (grand and petty). My theory pertaining to informal institutional pluralism suggests that discrete institutions (such as government corruption) within a <b>host</b> <b>market</b> can be conceptualized as pluralistic phenomena constituted by distinct dimensions which exert a disparate impact on the foreign entry strategy of MNEs. In the second essay, I build on the concept of informal institutional pluralism, categorizing corruption into two dimensions (public and private) to study its impact on the structure of equity-based foreign subsidiary investments. My theory proposes that the primary mechanism that drives the distinct approaches to foreign entry is the firm’s anticipated reliance on different sources of bargaining power to reduce information asymmetries that it expects to encounter in the <b>host</b> <b>market.</b> In the third essay, I study the relationship between <b>host</b> <b>market</b> corruption pervasiveness, the subsidiary localization strategies implemented by MNEs and the likelihood of <b>host</b> <b>market</b> exit. In this context, the strategic insights proffered by resource dependence theory (RDT) and institutional theory (IT) are characterized by distinct spatial orientations. While RDT predicts that subsidiaries will implement proximal (or, host market-oriented) localization strategies, IT suggests that distal (or, home market-oriented) localization strategies are better-suited to reducing the likelihood of exit from increasingly corrupt <b>host</b> <b>market</b> environments. I find that a proximally-oriented partnering strategy heightens the likelihood of market exit under conditions of more pervasive <b>host</b> <b>market</b> public corruption, but not more pervasive private corruption. Conversely, a distally-oriented expatriate strategy increases the likelihood of market exit under conditions of both more pervasive public corruption and private corruption. Taken as a whole, this dissertation introduces new theory, constructs and insights into the relationship between <b>host</b> <b>market</b> corruption and the equity-based foreign entry strategies of MNEs...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} how the returns and volatility of Chinese ADRs listed at NYSE {{are affected by}} their <b>host</b> <b>market</b> (US), underlying market (Hong Kong) and local market (Shanghai).

The increasing impact from <b>host</b> <b>market</b> and local market may attribute to strengthened integration between Chinese market and world market after China entered WTO. For US investors, they may need to be more prudent in diversification by using Chinese ADRs. However, there is relatively weak mean spillover from US (<b>host</b> <b>market),</b> Hong Kong (underlying market) and Shanghai (local market) to Chinese ADRs.
