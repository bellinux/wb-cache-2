This involved reconstructing exact replicas of the original carriage barn, hog sties, horse stalls, gardens, fences, and even the privy. These structures were based on T. Lambourne's drawings {{of the house and}} grounds that had been discovered in 1983, other records, and excavations. [...] Priestley left no written description of his laboratory, but much is known of his experiments and late-18th-century laboratories. Extensive research on the laboratory within the house was completed in 1996, including excavations that revealed two underground ovens, as well as evidence of a primitive fume hood. The 1998 renovations also included work to restore the laboratory to a condition as close to its original state as possible.|$|E
500|$|... "Dog of Death" [...] {{was written}} by long-time writer John Swartzwelder and {{directed}} by Jim Reardon. The producers decided to create another episode centered on Santa's Little Helper, as they enjoyed the previous ones, particularly season one's [...] "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire", in which the Simpson family receives him. Reardon commented {{that one of the}} hardest feats with the episode was to make Santa's Little Helper not express any human expressions, as the staff preferred animals on the show to behave <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> they do in real life. The plot of [...] "Dog of Death" [...] was based on an experience Swartzwelder had with his own dog that also suffered from bloat. However, unlike the events in the episode, Swartzwelder's dog did not receive treatment as the operation was too expensive and the dog was too old. The Gold Coast Bulletins Ryan Ellem commented that the Simpson family's dilemma with the cost of the veterinary procedure is a [...] "very real" [...] dilemma that many families [...] "who normally don't budget for a pooch's bung knee" [...] face.|$|E

500|$|Williamson's first {{professional}} work {{may have been}} helping Hogarth pencil some Tarzan Sunday pages in 1948, although Williamson, who had initially believed so, reconsidered in a 1983 interview and recalled that his Tarzan work had come after his first two pieces of comic-book art: providing spot illustrations for the story [...] "The World's Ugliest Horse" [...] in Eastern Color's seminal series Famous Funnies #166 (May 1948), and a two-page Boy Scouts story, his first comics narrative, in New Heroic Comics #51 (Nov. 1948). (Williamson is also identified as co-penciler, with Frank Frazetta, of a three-page crime story, [...] "The Last Three Dimes", in Standard Comics' Wonder Comics #20 [...] ) Williamson explained that while Hogarth had offered him Tarzan work, Williamson [...] "just couldn't do it. ... I couldn't get it into my little brain that {{he wanted me to}} do it <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> that he did it," [...] and instead successfully recommended Celardo, artist of the Tarzan-like feature [...] "Ka'a'nga" [...] in Fiction House's Jungle Comics.

In a 2007 chat forum interview, Albini revealed that he considered the album to be among the best he had engineered; a 2015 article in Stereogum likewise ranked it as the eighth best Albini-recorded album ever.

[...] Wiggs has similarly described her [...] "abiding affection" [...] for Pod, noting that all of the people involved in making it were particularly dedicated and attentive to doing quality work. In 2003, Pitchfork ranked the album at number 81 on their list of the Top 100 Albums of the 1990s.

500|$|Director John Ford {{said that}} when he was a prop boy {{in the early days of}} silent pictures, Earp would visit pals on the sets he knew from his Tombstone days. [...] "I used to give him a chair and a cup of coffee, and he told me about the fight at the O.K. Corral. So in My Darling Clementine, we did it <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> it had been." [...] When Ford was working on his last silent feature Hangman's House in 1928, which {{included}} the first credited screen appearances by John Wayne, Earp used to visit the set. John Wayne later told Hugh O'Brian that he based his Western lawman walk, talk and persona to his acquaintance with Wyatt Earp, who was good friends with Mix. [...] "I knew him... I often thought of Wyatt Earp when I played a film character. There's a guy that actually did what I'm trying to do." [...] Wyatt Earp's character has been the central figure in 10 films and featured in many more.

500|$|Joel Schumacher's {{script for}} The Wiz was {{influenced}} by Werner Erhard's teachings and his Erhard Seminars Training ("est") movement, as both Schumacher and Diana Ross were [...] "very enamored of Werner Erhard". [...] "Before I knew it," [...] said Rob Cohen, [...] "the movie was becoming an est-ian fable full of est buzzwords about knowing {{who you are and}} sharing and all that. I hated the script a lot. But it was hard to argue with [...] because she was recognizing in this script all of this stuff that she had worked out in est seminars." [...] Schumacher spoke positively {{of the results of the}} est training, stating that he was [...] "eternally grateful for learning that I was responsible for my life." [...] However, he also complained that [...] "everybody stayed <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> they were and went around spouting all this bull****." [...] Of est and Erhard references in the film itself, The Grove Book of Hollywood notes that the speech delivered by Glinda the Good Witch at the end of the film was [...] "a litany of est-like platitudes", and the book also makes est comparisons to the song [...] "Believe in Yourself". Although Joel Schumacher had seen the Broadway play before writing the script, none of the Broadway play's writing was incorporated into the film's.|$|E
500|$|Although no {{materials}} {{appear to}} exist specifically addressing {{the composition of}} [...] "The Princess and the Pea", Andersen does speak to {{the writing of the}} first four tales of 1835 of which [...] "The Princess on the Pea" [...] is one. New Year's Day 1835, Andersen wrote to a friend: [...] "I am now starting on some 'fairy tales for children.' I am going to win over future generations, you may want to know", and, in a letter dated February 1835 he wrote to the poet, Bernhard Severin Ingemann: [...] "I have started some 'Fairy Tales Told for Children' and believe I have succeeded. I have told a couple of tales which as a child I was happy about, and which I do not believe are known, and have written them <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> I would tell them to a child." [...] Andersen had finished the tales by March 1835 and told Admiral Wulff's daughter, Henriette: [...] "I have also written some fairy tales for children; Ørsted says about them that if The Improvisatore makes me famous then these will make me immortal, for they are the most perfect things I have written; but I myself do not think so." [...] On 26March, he observed that [...] " [...] will be published in April, and people will say: the work of my immortality! Of course I shan't enjoy the experience in this world." ...|$|E

500|$|Reviewers {{were divided}} {{as to the}} merits of the novel's ending. Andy Smith lamented that the finale of the [...] "mostly intriguing" [...] novel was [...] "distinctly anticlimactic". Tim Martin wrote that it seemed [...] "somehow less {{than the sum of its}} parts". Clay Evans {{dismissed}} it as [...] "not especially meaningful, but fun", whereas Matt Thorne found it lacking [...] "a traditional thriller's excitement". San Francisco Chronicle reviewer Michael Berry called it [...] "an ingenious reversal" [...] which proved that despite its apparent cynicism, the novel was [...] "oddly optimistic for a ghost story". Overall, Thorne judged the novel ultimately unsatisfactory on account of the underwhelming ending and because Gibson [...] "hides the full complications of the plot so successfully that it feels as if everything important is happening offstage". Roger Perkins judged the novel to be [...] "a triumph of style over substance – which is <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> you suspect that Gibson wants it." [...] His colleague Martin mused that along with the regular Gibsonian tropes, there was [...] "something new ... a dark and very contemporary surge of suspicion and bad faith" [...] in the novel which suggested that the author might be approaching the apex of his writing. Dan Conover concluded that while the [...] "darkly comic satire" [...] was [...] "a worthy addition to the Gibson canon and a significant cultural artifact", it would not rank among the author's best works.|$|E
500|$|The {{release of}} a single was soon deemed a [...] "stupid idea" [...] by Cornell and dropped {{in favor of an}} EP or album. The album was {{recorded}} in only 15 days, produced by the band themselves. Gossard described the recording process as a [...] "non-pressure-filled" [...] situation, as there were no expectations or pressure coming from the record company. Eddie Vedder, who had flown up from San Diego to Seattle to audition for Ament, Gossard, and McCready to be the singer of a band initially billing themselves as Mookie Blaylock (so named for a basketball player but eventually settling on Pearl Jam), was at one of the Temple of the Dog rehearsals and ended up providing backing vocals. [...] "Hunger Strike" [...] became a duet between Cornell and Vedder. Cornell was still figuring out the vocals at practice when Vedder stepped in and filled in the blanks singing the low parts because he saw it was hard for Cornell, as Cornell later described it: [...] "He sang half of that song not even knowing that I'd wanted the part to be there and he sang it <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> I was thinking about doing it, just instinctively." [...] "Hunger Strike" [...] became Temple of the Dog's breakout single; it was also Vedder's first featured vocal on a record. On the 2011 documentary Pearl Jam Twenty, Vedder stated; “That was the first time I heard myself on a real record. It could be one of my favorite songs that I’ve ever been on — or the most meaningful.” ...|$|E
500|$|Writer John Swartzwelder {{has noted}} that the staff members of the show write the {{character}} Homer {{in the same way}} that they write Santa's Little Helper: [...] "Both are loyal. Both have the same emotional range. And both will growl and possibly snap if you try to take their food." [...] Although animals in cartoons often behave with [...] "semi-human awareness", Groening said on the DVD audio commentary for the episode [...] "Two Dozen and One Greyhounds" [...] that he prefers animals in cartoons to behave <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> they do in real life. As a result, Santa's Little Helper is depicted in this way on the show. There have, however, been some exceptions for gags, but most of the time the staff of The Simpsons tries to keep animals acting realistically. Several journalists have commented on the greyhound's lack of intelligence. In an article that compared The Simpsons to the animated series Family Guy, Todd Camp of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram noted that [...] "though Santa's Little Helper may be the only Simpson who's dumber than Homer, the Griffins' pooch [...] is the brainiest member of the household". In 1991, Copley News Service's Alison Ashton described Santa's Little Helper as a [...] "sweet and stupid dog". Tom Coombe of The Morning Call wrote in 2002 that [...] "fans of The Simpsons will tell you that the cartoon family's dog [...] is often dumb, disobedient and skittish. Fans of the real-life breed will paint a different picture — of dogs that are peaceful, affectionate, [...] not given to drooling, panting".|$|E
