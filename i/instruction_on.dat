5|$|The Army's {{training}} program attracted criticism, {{both at the}} time and subsequently. In 1937, Brigadier General George C. Marshall felt that in merging <b>instruction</b> <b>on</b> command and staff duties, the Command and General Staff School had neglected the former in favor of the latter, with officers being prepared for staff duties in peacetime rather than the chaos of command in wartime. Brigadier General Lesley J. McNair conducted a survey of graduates in 1939 that found that most felt that there was too much emphasis on obsolete skills like equitation. For this reason, the staff rides were disliked. While most considered the map exercises the most valuable part of the curriculum, some noted that students spent time discovering for themselves things that they could have been told.|$|E

5|$|In {{its current}} role No.79 Squadron's main {{responsibility}} is to provide introductory fast jet training to pilots who have recently graduated from No.2 Flying Training School. During this training, new pilots who have been selected to fly jet aircraft are taught to operate Hawks and provided with initial <b>instruction</b> <b>on</b> jet aircraft combat tactics. In 2004, each of No.79 Squadron's training courses lasted for twelve weeks. After completing their initial jet aircraft training, pilots transfer to No.76 Squadron at RAAF Base Williamtown for advanced instruction before being posted {{to one of the}} RAAF's operational conversion units. No.79 Squadron also provides introductory training on fast jets for RAAF air combat officers who have been selected to serve on board F/A-18F Super Hornets. The squadron trained RAAF personnel selected to serve as navigators on board F-111 strike aircraft until these aircraft were replaced with Super Hornets in 2010.
