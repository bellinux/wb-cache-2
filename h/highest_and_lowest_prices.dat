30|$|It {{has been}} shown that when {{competition}} is introduced into a market dominated by a monopolistic supplier performing differential pricing—similar to R&C’s brokerage model—there will be an increase in intra-firm price dispersion [28].

40|$|Abstract. In earlier studies, the {{estimation}} of the volatility of a stock using information on the daily opening, closing, <b>high</b> <b>and</b> <b>low</b> <b>prices</b> has been developed; the additional information in the <b>high</b> <b>and</b> <b>low</b> <b>prices</b> can be incorporated to produce unbiased (or near-unbiased) estimators with substantially lower variance than the simple open-close estimator. This paper tackles the more difficult task of estimating the correlation of two stocks based on the daily opening, closing, <b>high</b> <b>and</b> <b>low</b> <b>prices</b> of each. If we could assume that we saw the <b>high</b> <b>and</b> <b>low</b> values of some linear {{combination of the two}} log prices, then we could use the univariate results via polarisation, but this is not data that is available. The actual problem is more challenging; we present an unbiased estimator which halves the variance. ...|$|R

40|$|Movements in {{wholesale}} prices are compared {{in order to}} examine the effect of differences in the production, marketing and consumption in the Japanese and Australian vegetable industries. The differences include expanding production in Australia but static output in Japan, Japan 2 ̆ 7 s extensive use of protected production, Japan 2 ̆ 7 s designated vegetable system which gives its producers guaranteed prices, increasing vegetable consumption in Australia but declining consumption in Japan, and the use of private treaty negotiated marketing in Australia compared with Japan 2 ̆ 7 s use of auctions. The movement of weekly {{wholesale prices}} of 14 vegetables at Brisbane (Queensland, Australia) and Ohta (Tokyo) in the period May 1989 to April 1990 are compared using (a) movements about their average prices, (b) the number of times price movements change direction, and (c) the extent of between-week movements. The survey of price movements showed that for the 14 vegetables surveyed and on the three criteria developed in the paper Ohta prices moved more frequently and with a greater degree of volatility than those at Brisbane. This suggests that Japan 2 ̆ 7 s extensive use of protected production has not resulted in a greater degree of price stability than Australisa 2 ̆ 7 s open-field production system. Further, without the benefit of a guaranteed price Brisbane has less volatile prices than Japan with its designated vegetable system. Indeed, the very guarantee of stability incorporated with the Japanese system may induce higher degrees of instability. Finally, the imbalance between the number of <b>highest</b> <b>and</b> <b>lowest</b> <b>prices</b> which result from comparing prices stemming from the two systems of price discovery suggests that Ohta 2 ̆ 7 s auction system may not be operating as efficiently as Brisbane 2 ̆ 7 s system of negotiated prices...|$|E

40|$|Introduction The {{volatility}} {{of a financial}} instrument is a crucial parameter {{for a number of}} reasons. It enters as a parameter in pricing formulas for derivatives instruments, and plays key roles in asset allocation, portfolio optimization strategies and risk management. As a result, considerable attention has been devoted to the accurate estimation of volatility. Because it is recognized that volatility is time varying, it is imperative to use only the most recent price observations to construct an estimate of the volatility. To obtain a good estimator, one should thus attempt to make the utmost use of the small number of observations available. In this paper, we propose an estimator that uses the <b>high</b> <b>and</b> <b>low</b> <b>price</b> information in addition to the closing price used by conventional estimators. In practice this would be of great interest because most historical data is quoted with both the <b>high</b> <b>and</b> <b>low</b> in addition to the close. Volatility estimates using <b>high</b> <b>and</b> <b>low</b> <b>prices</b> h...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} theory of {{homogeneous}} volatility bridge estimators for log-price stochastic processes.

The efficiency of the new proposed estimators is favorably compared with that of the Garman-Klass and Parkinson estimators. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>High</b> <b>and</b> <b>low</b> <b>prices</b> convey {{additional}} information beyond closing prices, {{based on the}} fact that the improved high-low volatility estimator enjoys higher efficiency than the standard close-to-close variance. Empirical results show that a positive risk-return relationship is exhibited more frequently when predicted high-low prices are applied rather than historical data by taking advantage of the new volatility estimator in 48 countries. In this study, models using historical data contain(1) historical closing prices, (2) historical high-low prices, and (3) the Risk Aversion method, while the three high-low prices prediction approaches include (1) Engle and Granger two-step linear model, (2) Engle and Granger non-linear model, and (3) MIDAS technique. Corporate governance variables, associated with laws and enforcement, have weak explanatory power over investors’ perception of risk. This study also contributes to the validity of technical analysis by showing that <b>high</b> <b>and</b> <b>low</b> <b>prices</b> forecasts are able to generate valuable trading signals and positive returns based on range-based strategy and midpoint strategy.

40|$|In this thesis, {{we study}} the {{behaviour}} and forecastability of exchange rates. Most {{of the existing}} literature on the forecasting of exchange rates concentrates {{on the end of}} the day price, commonly known as the 'close' price. Meese and Rogoff [30] show that this price tends to follow the naive random walk model, which implies that the best forecast for the next period is the current observed value. Instead, we study the dynamics and the predictability of the daily <b>high</b> <b>and</b> <b>low</b> <b>prices</b> using real-world data for the currency pairs GBP/USD, EUR/USD and AUD/USD. The daily <b>high</b> <b>and</b> <b>low</b> are the maximum and minimum prices reached for each 24 -hour period by the currency pairs. We find strong evidence that the daily close <b>prices</b> lag these <b>highs</b> <b>and</b> <b>lows.</b> We use this knowledge to build an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) rolling regression model that produces one day ahead out-of-sample forecasts of these <b>high</b> <b>and</b> <b>low</b> <b>prices.</b> We also build an algorithm that uses already existing dynamic regression methods to correct for the autocorrelation often observed in time-series data. The window size used for the estimation of our model parameters is very important due to the nature of time series data. We propose an empirical method to find the best suitable window size for the estimation of these parameters. The out-of-sample predictability of our regression models is compared to a few benchmark models by using a number of different performance measures. We show that our models outperform these benchmark models in terms of their forecasting ability of <b>high</b> <b>and</b> <b>low</b> <b>prices.</b> Furthermore, a triggering method is developed for trading exchange rates using a saturation-reset linear feedback controller. First, we test our triggering method on an idealized market model, for which we propose a stochastic process. We then apply this triggering method to real-world data in order to study its performance. Finally, we construct trading strategies that combine these methods with our out-of-sample forecasts...|$|R
