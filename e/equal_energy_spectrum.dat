The current study investigated {{the effect of the}} proximity in space and time of a surround to the test field on chromatic contrast discrimination.

40|$|A yellow/blue {{equilibrium}} {{light is}} one which appears neither yellowish nor bluish (i. e. uniquely red, uniquely green, or achromatic). The spectral locus of the monochromatic greenish equilibrium (around 500 nm) shows little, if any, variation over a luminance range of 2 log 10 units. Reddish equilibria are extraspectral, involving mixtures of short- and long-wave light. Their wavelength composition is noninvariant with luminance: a reddish equilibrium light turns bluish-red if luminance is increased with wavelength composition constant. The additive {{mixture of the}} reddish and greenish equilibria is again a yellow/blue equilibrium light. We conclude that yellow/blue equilibrium {{can be described as}} the zeroing of a nonlinear functional, which is, however, approximately linear in the short-wavelength ("blue") and middle-wavelength ("green") cone responses and nonlinear only in the long-wavelength ("red") cone response. The "red" cones contribute to yellowness, but via a compressive function of luminance. This effect works against the direction of the Bezold-Brücke hue shift. The Jameson-Hurvich yellow/blue chromatic-response function is only approximately correct: the relative values of yellow/blue chromatic response for an <b>equal</b> <b>energy</b> <b>spectrum</b> must vary somewhat with the energy level. © 1975...|$|E

In our research, stimuli originated from a colorimeter that provided 4 primaries in both the circular test and the annular surround fields, and allowed independent modulation of the rods {{and each of the}} short (S) -, middle (M) -, and long (L) -wavelength-sensitive cone types. The chromaticity was set so fields had the same appearance as the <b>equal</b> <b>energy</b> <b>spectrum.</b> At 1 photopic troland (td), rod-induced modulation in the test field could be cancelled by either a rod- or a cone-nulling modulation added to the test field. The best cone nulling of rod induction showed residual flicker. Nulling was more effective, though still imperfect, with a cone-nulling stimulus of higher S-cone modulation contrast. Rod induction with square-wave, on-pulse, and off-pulse temporal profiles was closely similar. At higher light levels, 10 and 100 td, rod contrast could not be nulled by rod or cone modulation. The failure to achieve nulls may have been caused by either or both of the following hypotheses: (1) there is a mismatch between the rod and cone temporal waveforms; (2) there is strong rod input to the magnocellular pathway, but negligible rod input to the parvocellular pathway, as shown by single-unit electrophysiological data...|$|E
