40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{determine}} which particular organisational and managerial factors contribute to the propensity to export in a <b>declining</b> <b>sector.</b> For this purpose the textile and clothing sector in Portugal and the United Kingdom is chosen for investigation. This study analyses firms’ resources and capabilities, as well as decision-makers’ objective and subjective characteristics in a sample of 167 Portuguese and 165 UK firms in the textile and clothing industry. The fundamental research questions are: which characteristics of the firm are associated with stronger export propensity, and is it possible to identify a profile of decision-makers associated with export propensity? For Portugal, the size of firm and the educational level of managers are the key determinants of export propensity. As to the UK, age and perception of costs are the key factors. In addition, we also investigated managers’ commitment to exporting, for which the important determinants of export propensity in the textile and clothing sector were found to be planning, advertising and promotion. When combining the two country data-sets, particular firm characteristics, namely, firm size, competitive advantage, and technology, and a specific objective characteristic, namely, the number of languages spoken, are the key factors associated with the propensity to export in this <b>declining</b> <b>sector...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} causes of Turkish export-boom after 2000 in the {{manufacturing}} sector. We mainly concentrate on cost and productivity aspects of the production in the manufacturing sector. Effects of productivity, wage and exchange rate are analyzed {{in the framework of}} the augmented unit labor cost model. Following the Edwards and Golub (2004) paper we use the dynamic panel data techniques for the analysis. In addition, the importance of the above mentioned factors is examined for the rising and <b>declining</b> <b>sectors.</b> We find that manufacturing export is negatively related to the unit labor cost (ULC). Decomposition of ULC into its two components also shows that an improvement in productivity increases export while an increase in nominal wages decreases it.

40|$|Background and motivation: The paper investigates what effects the {{colocation}} {{of growing}} and <b>declining</b> <b>sectors</b> {{has on the}} hiring behaviour of growing sectors in terms of labour pooling and employment growth. Given the importance of geographical proximity in labour matches, the agglomeration literature has suggested that creating dense clusters of (related) economic activities decreases the distances between the firms and the employees, which enables better labour matches and idiosyncratic labour demand absorptions. However, in such clusters {{the positive effects of}} labour pooling can be dominated by negative effects of labour poaching, depending on the labour demand of the participants of agglomeration. I build upon the agglomeration literature, but extend it to a framework where the employees flows among sectors in the region are influenced by different growth rates of sectoral labour demand. Data and methods: rich datasets are used with micro-level data linking jobs, firms and employees in the Netherlands 2006 - 2011. OLS regressions at municipality and NUTS 3 area level are conducted. Results and conclusions: The effects of colocation with <b>declining</b> <b>sectors</b> for growing sectors are only marginal. In terms of labour pooling, the easy access to redundant labour force does not encourage the growing sectors to hire more locally. Generally, the employees from <b>declining</b> <b>sectors</b> do not dominate the inflows of declining sectors: the growing sectors focus more on new entrants in the labour market or pooling with stable and other growing sectors; they also tend to hire more outside the region. Moreover, the reluctance to hire locally is understandable: the labour pooling, quite unexpectedly, generally has negative effects on growin sectors' employment growth and even more so in regions with much decline. The overall effects of decline in the region on the employment growth of growing sectors are only statistically significant (and positive) at NUTS 3 area level for related decline, probably due to capital flows from <b>declining</b> <b>sectors</b> (it does not correspond to labour force flows). While the implications of the results are quite neutral in terms of location of sectors they are quite negative for redundant employees and regional development in general. The lack of flows from declining to growing sectors indicate that many employees are not able {{to catch up with the}} rapid creative destruction. The skills in the redundant sectors are often of little relevance to other sectors...|$|E

40|$|Excerpt] Analysis of the inter-industry {{earnings}} differentials {{revealed that}} these differentials were quite small by international standards, and indeed, that earnings were rising {{at roughly the}} same rate in every sector of the labour market in Taiwan. Wage differentials in Taiwan 2 ̆ 7 s private sector are generally in line with the economy as a whole; quite small by international standards, with real wages rising at very similar rates throughout all of the major private sector industries, whilst also demonstrating similar growth and decline patterns. For example, the agricultural sector in Taiwan is a <b>declining</b> <b>sector</b> of the economy, relative to non-agriculture, whilst within the manufacturing industry, textiles is a <b>declining</b> <b>sector</b> relative to electronics; and yet, the incomes of farm and non-farm households grew at essentially the same rate, as did earnings in both the electronics and textiles sectors. This chapter therefore proposes a labour-market model which provides a good fit with these aspects of the private sector. We consider three kinds of models: (i) a segmented labour-market model in which the wages in each sector are set by the demand and supply for labour in that sector alone; (ii) a Harris-Todaro-type model with wage dualism/segmentation (Harris and Todaro, 1970); and (iii) an integrated multi-sector labour-market model. This chapter aims to demonstrate why the integrated labour-market model is better suited to the Taiwan case {{than any of the other}} models and that this model can help us to gain a better understanding of some of the important aspects of Taiwan 2 ̆ 7 s economic development...|$|R

Applying difference-in-differences techniques and non-parametric matching, we find adverse effects on the probability to be in work and on wages earned in the new job, which are larger for older workers than for prime-age workers. Within the older-age group, the effects are stronger for formerly long-tenured workers, for older workers who lost their job in <b>declining</b> <b>sectors</b> in the regional labour market and for workers who changed sectors. In the prime-age group, these differences are less pronounced.
