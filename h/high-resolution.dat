5|$|An astronomical {{interferometer}} achieves <b>high-resolution</b> observations {{using the}} technique of aperture synthesis, mixing signals from a cluster of comparatively small telescopes rather than a single very expensive monolithic telescope.|$|E
5|$|Deciding between {{building}} ground- versus space-based telescopes is complex. Even before Hubble was launched, specialized ground-based {{techniques such}} as aperture masking interferometry had obtained higher-resolution optical and infrared images than Hubble would achieve, though restricted to targets about 108 times brighter than the faintest targets observed by Hubble. Since then, advances in adaptive optics have extended the <b>high-resolution</b> imaging capabilities of ground-based telescopes to the infrared imaging of faint objects. The usefulness of adaptive optics versus HST observations depends strongly on the particular details of the research questions being asked. In the visible bands, adaptive optics can only correct a relatively small field of view, whereas HST can conduct <b>high-resolution</b> optical imaging over a wide field. Only {{a small fraction of}} astronomical objects are accessible to <b>high-resolution</b> ground-based imaging; in contrast Hubble can perform <b>high-resolution</b> observations of any part of the night sky, and on objects that are extremely faint.|$|E

5|$|Drill {{additional}} cores {{to provide}} <b>high-resolution</b> {{data for the}} last 2,000 years, to use as input for detailed climate modelling.|$|E
5|$|It {{may also}} appear suspect because similar events are not {{observed}} in other ice ages (Hemming 2004), although {{this may be}} due to the lack of <b>high-resolution</b> sediments.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{is thought}} to have a body-centered cubic crystal {{structure}} from absolute zero to its melting point, <b>high-resolution</b> measurements of the thermal expansion along the three crystallographic axes reveal anisotropies which are inconsistent with a cubic structure. Therefore, further research and discovery in this area is expected.|$|E
5|$|Before the Cassini mission, {{little was}} known about the {{interior}} of Enceladus. However, flybys by Cassini provided information for models of Enceladus's interior, including a better determination of the mass and shape, <b>high-resolution</b> observations of the surface, and new insights on the interior.|$|E
5|$|Comparison of <b>high-resolution</b> images {{obtained}} by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter has shown a contemporary crater-production rate significantly higher than previously estimated. A secondary cratering process caused by distal ejecta is thought to churn the top two centimetres of regolith a hundred times more quickly than previous models suggestedon a timescale of 81,000 years.|$|E
5|$|On September 7, Google Inc. {{helped the}} search for the aviator through its {{connections}} to contractors that provide satellite imagery for its Google Earth software. Richard Branson, a British billionaire and friend of Fossett, said he and others were coordinating efforts with Google to see if any of the <b>high-resolution</b> images might include Fossett's aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The {{main and}} halo rings consist of dust {{ejected from the}} moons Metis, Adrastea, and other unobserved parent bodies {{as the result of}} {{high-velocity}} impacts. <b>High-resolution</b> images obtained in February and March 2007 by the New Horizons spacecraft revealed a rich fine structure in the main ring.|$|E
5|$|Transmission of many Ida images {{was delayed}} {{due to a}} {{permanent}} failure in the spacecraft's high-gain antenna. The first five images were received in September 1993. These comprised a <b>high-resolution</b> mosaic of the asteroid at a resolution of 31–38m/pixel. The remaining images were sent in February 1994, when the spacecraft's proximity to the Earth allowed higher speed transmissions.|$|E
5|$|As {{mentioned}} above, small {{patches of}} pure water ice with an albedo {{as high as}} 80% are found {{on the surface of}} Callisto, surrounded by much darker material. <b>High-resolution</b> Galileo images showed the bright patches to be predominately located on elevated surface features: crater rims, scarps, ridges and knobs. They are likely to be thin water frost deposits. Dark material usually lies in the lowlands surrounding and mantling bright features and appears to be smooth. It often forms patches up to 5km across within the crater floors and in the intercrater depressions.|$|E
5|$|In 2007 the LITENING {{targeting}} pod was fitted, {{which increased}} {{the effectiveness of}} the aircraft in the attack of ground targets with a variety of standoff weapons, using laser guidance, a <b>high-resolution</b> forward-looking infrared sensor (FLIR), and a CCD camera used to obtain target imagery. LITENING pods have been fitted {{to a wide variety of}} other US aircraft, such as the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet, the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon and the McDonnell Douglas AV-8B Harrier II.|$|E
5|$|In November 1980, the Voyager 1 probe {{visited the}} Saturn system. It sent back the first <b>high-resolution</b> {{images of the}} planet, its rings and satellites. Surface {{features}} of various moons were seen for the first time. Voyager 1 performed a close flyby of Titan, increasing knowledge of {{the atmosphere of the}} moon. It proved that Titan's atmosphere is impenetrable in visible wavelengths; therefore no surface details were seen. The flyby changed the spacecraft's trajectory out from the plane of the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|NigeriaSat-2, Nigeria's second {{satellite}}, {{was built}} as a <b>high-resolution</b> earth satellite by Surrey Space Technology Limited, a United Kingdom-based satellite technology company. It has 2.5-metre resolution panchromatic (very high resolution), 5-metre multispectral (high resolution, NIR red, green and red bands), and 32-metre multispectral (medium resolution, NIR red, green and red bands) antennas, with a ground receiving station in Abuja. The NigeriaSat-2 spacecraft alone was built {{at a cost of}} over £35 million. This satellite was launched into orbit from a military base in China.|$|E
5|$|Seeds of Evil {{features}} a single-player campaign consisting of six levels and a multiplayer mode where various players can compete {{against each other}} in several game types. It supports the Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak, which enables an optional <b>high-resolution</b> graphics mode. The game was developed over a period of 21 months and was originally intended to be released on a 12MB cartridge without a multiplayer component. When cartridges prices fell, developers ultimately decided to release it on a 32MB cartridge.|$|E
5|$|The D-21 was {{designed}} to carry a single <b>high-resolution</b> photographic camera over a preprogrammed path, then release the camera module into the air for retrieval, after which the drone would self-destruct. Following a fatal accident when launched from an M-21, the D-21 was modified to be launched from a Boeing B-52 Stratofortress. Several test flights were made, followed by four unsuccessful operational D-21 flights over the People's Republic of China, and the program was canceled in 1971.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} that enzymes could be crystallized eventually allowed their structures {{to be solved}} by x-ray crystallography. This was first done for lysozyme, an enzyme found in tears, saliva and egg whites that digests the coating of some bacteria; the structure was solved by a group led by David Chilton Phillips and published in 1965. This <b>high-resolution</b> structure of lysozyme {{marked the beginning of}} the field of structural biology and the effort to understand how enzymes work at an atomic level of detail.|$|E
5|$|The first <b>high-resolution</b> {{electron}} micrographs {{appeared in}} 1952, replacing the Janus Green stains as the preferred way of visualising the mitochondria. This {{led to a}} more {{detailed analysis of the}} structure of the mitochondria, including confirmation that they were surrounded by a membrane. It also showed a second membrane inside the mitochondria that folded up in ridges dividing up the inner chamber and that the size and shape of the mitochondria varied from cell to cell.|$|E
5|$|The limited <b>high-resolution</b> radar {{coverage}} of Titan obtained through 2007 (22%) suggested {{the existence of}} nonuniformities in its crater distribution. Xanadu has 2–9 times more craters than elsewhere. The leading hemisphere has a 30% higher density than the trailing hemisphere. There are lower crater densities in areas of equatorial dunes and in the north polar region (where hydrocarbon lakes and seas are most common).|$|E
5|$|The {{strength}} of the D line means it has been detected in many other astronomical environments. In stars, it is seen in any whose surfaces are cool enough for sodium to exist in atomic form (rather than ionised). This corresponds to stars of roughly F-type and cooler. Many other stars {{appear to have a}} sodium absorption line, but this is actually caused by gas in the foreground interstellar medium. The two can be distinguished via <b>high-resolution</b> spectroscopy, because interstellar lines are much narrower than those broadened by stellar rotation.|$|E
5|$|Type B: This {{connector}} is 21.2mm × 4.45mm and has 29 pins, carrying six differential pairs {{instead of}} three, {{for use with}} very <b>high-resolution</b> displays such as WQUXGA (3,840×2,400). It is electrically compatible with dual-link DVI-D, but {{has not yet been}} used in any products. With the introduction of HDMI 1.3, the maximum bandwidth of single-link HDMI exceeded that of dual-link DVI-D. As of HDMI 1.4, the pixel clock rate crossover frequency from single to dual-link has not been defined.|$|E
5|$|Voyager 1s Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS), now disabled, {{consisted}} of two cameras: a 200mm focal length, low-resolution wide-angle camera (WA), used for spatially extended imaging, and a 1500mm <b>high-resolution</b> narrow-angle camera (NA) – the one that took Pale Blue Dot – intended for detailed imaging of specific targets. Both cameras were of the slow-scan vidicon tube type and were fitted with eight colored filters, mounted on a filter wheel {{placed in front of}} the tube.|$|E

25|$|Apple has {{continued}} to change aspects of the macOS appearance and design, particularly with tweaks to the appearance of windows and the menu bar. Since 2012, Apple has sold many of its Mac models with <b>high-resolution</b> Retina displays, and macOS and its APIs have extensive support for resolution-independent development on supporting <b>high-resolution</b> displays. Reviewers have described Apple's support for the technology as superior to that on Windows.|$|E
