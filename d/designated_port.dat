25|$|Contrary to {{a popular}} misconception, a U.S. visa does not authorize the alien's entry to the United States, nor does it authorize the alien's stay in the U.S. in a {{particular}} status. A U.S. visa only serves as a preliminary permission given to the alien {{to travel to the}} United States and to seek admission to the United States at a <b>designated</b> <b>port</b> of entry. The final admission to the United States in a particular status and for a particular period of time is made at the port of entry by a U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer. For aliens entering the U.S. in a nonimmigrant visa status these details are recorded by the CBP officer on the alien's Form I-94 (Form I-94W for citizens of the Visa Waiver Program countries entering the U.S. for short visits), which serves as the official document authorizing the alien's stay in the United States in a particular non-immigrant visa status and for a particular period of time. 50,000 additional visas are available each year under the visa lottery program. In the last few years more than 9 million people have participated in the visa lottery.|$|E
2500|$|The Port Victoria Depot's second design, <b>designated</b> <b>Port</b> Victoria P.V.2 was a {{floatplane}} fighter {{intended to}} intercept German Zeppelins. The P.V.2 {{was a small}} single engined biplane, powered by a Gnome Monosoupape rotary engine driving a four blage propellor. [...] It was of wood and fabric construction, and of sesquiplane configuration, i.e. with its lower wing much smaller than its upper wing (both of which used the high-lift wing sections pioneered by the P.V.1). Unusually, the aircraft's wing bracing struts also carried the aircraft's floats, forming a [...] "W" [...] shape when viewed from the front. [...] The upper wing was attached directly {{to the top of}} the fuselage, giving a good field of fire for the intended armament of a single 2-lb Davis gun recoilless gun.|$|E

50|$|When {{more than}} one bridge on a segment leads to a least-cost path to the root, the bridge with the lower bridge ID is used to forward {{messages}} to the root. The port attaching that bridge to the network segment is the <b>designated</b> <b>port</b> for the segment. In figure 4, there are two least cost paths from network segment d to the root, one going through bridge 24 and the other through bridge 92. The lower bridge ID is 24, so the tie breaker dictates that the <b>designated</b> <b>port</b> is the port through which network segment d is connected to bridge 24. If bridge IDs were equal, then the bridge with the lowest MAC address would have the <b>designated</b> <b>port.</b> In either case, the loser sets the port as being blocked.|$|E
