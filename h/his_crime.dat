5|$|The film's soundtrack {{consists}} {{almost entirely}} of pre-World War I 78 rpm recordings of opera arias sung by the Italian tenor Enrico Caruso. This bold use, despite Caruso's variety of musical styles, constitutes a first for Allen. Opera has been used before in his work {{as an indicator of}} social class, such as in Husbands and Wives (1992). In Match Point, the arias and opera extracts make an ironic commentary on the actions of the characters and sometimes foreshadow developments in the movie's narrative. Furthermore, given Wilton's status as an introvert and opera enthusiast himself, the accompaniment emphasises his detachment from <b>his</b> <b>crime.</b>|$|E

5|$|A year passes. Peter {{has begun}} dating again, some dates being a Stickman and Bonnie, but has talked Joe into posing as Lois {{from time to}} time so that her death doesn't emotionally scar Chris. Stewie {{indirectly}} reveals to Brian that he killed Lois. Disturbed and angered, Brian vows to bring him to justice. Stewie realizes that keeping the evidence of <b>his</b> <b>crime</b> as souvenirs is too risky; thus, he disposes of his gun and drawings depicting Lois being killed. After Peter nonchalantly reveals that Lois' life insurance policy, which was made on the cruise right after she and Peter had an argument stating they wanted to kill each other, has recently been cashed for a large amount of money, Joe, Quagmire, and Cleveland begin to suspect Peter as Lois' killer. They search the Griffins' trash and find Stewie's discarded gun and drawings. Joe becomes convinced that Peter was the one who killed Lois, given that Stewie and Peter have similar handwriting.|$|E
5|$|At L'Ora, De Mauro {{joined a}} group of crack investigative reporters. From the mid-1950s to the 1970s the left-leaning {{newspaper}} often hit the national spotlight for its investigations and denunciations about the ties between the Sicilian Mafia and corrupt politicians. These were the golden years of investigations, signed by journalists like Mauro De Mauro, Felice Chilanti and Mario Farinella. De Mauro could exercise his skills as a successful investigative reporter. He wrote on drug trafficking and the Sack of Palermo, the construction boom in the 1950s and 1960s {{that led to the}} destruction of the city's green belt and ancient villas. He also published articles about the collusion between the Mafia and politics.

5|$|He {{was tried}} and convicted of Sharp's murder on May 19, 1826. His sentence– {{execution}} by hanging– {{was to be}} carried out on June 16, 1826. Beauchamp requested a stay of execution so that he could write a justification of his actions; he continued to assert his avenging his wife's honor. The request was granted, allowing Beauchamp to complete his book, The Confession of Jereboam O. Beauchamp: who was hanged at Frankfort, Ky., on the 7th day of July, 1826, for the murder of Col. Solomon P. Sharp. After two failed suicide attempts with his wife, who {{died as a result of}} the second incident, Beauchamp was hanged for <b>his</b> <b>crime</b> on July 7, 1826. Beauchamp's Confession was published in 1826. Some editions included The Letters of Ann Cook as an appendix. Historians dispute whether Cooke was their author.|$|E
5|$|In the Hanzhong state, sin and {{criminal}} behavior were not differentiated. In order to eliminate sin, an adherent {{first had to}} acknowledge <b>his</b> <b>crime,</b> and then {{would have to go}} to a 'quiet room' to meditate. There, he would have to write three confessions which would be offered to the Lord of Heaven, the Lord of Earth and the Lord of Water. For public crimes, an accused would be pardoned three times for his actions and then be sentenced. A sentence depended on the type of crime, but always involved community service. For a minor crime, the sentence was usually to repair a road. A repeat offender might be asked to donate building materials to improve local buildings. Other laws banned alcohol and prohibited the killing of animals during the spring and summer.|$|E
5|$|Peter Bogdanovich, whose The Last Picture Show {{impressed}} McQueen {{and producer}} David Foster, was originally hired {{as the director}} of The Getaway.

Originally scored by Peckinpah collaborator Jerry Fielding, McQueen became unimpressed with Fielding's soundtrack and, at his behest, hired Quincy Jones to rescore it.

5|$|Sofya Semyonovna Marmeladova, {{variously}} called Sonya and Sonechka, is {{the daughter}} of a drunkard named Semyon Zakharovich Marmeladov, whom Raskolnikov meets in a tavern {{at the beginning of the}} novel. She is often characterized as self-sacrificial, shy, and even innocent despite the fact that she is compelled into prostitution to help her family. She also, as Raskolnikov discerns, shares the same feelings of shame and alienation as he does and becomes the first person to whom Raskolnikov confesses <b>his</b> <b>crime,</b> and she supports him even though she was friends with one of the victims (Lizaveta). Throughout the novel, Sonya is an important source of moral strength and rehabilitation for Raskolnikov, and in some interpretations, even considered a Christ-like figure. She is forced to prostitute herself to provide for her family, leading some critics to make comparisons with Mary Magdalene.|$|E
5|$|As Raskolnikov and Porfiry {{continue}} to meet, Raskolnikov's motives {{for the crime}} become exposed. Porfiry becomes increasingly certain of the man's guilt, but has no concrete evidence or witnesses with which to back up this suspicion. Furthermore, another man admits to committing the crime under questioning and arrest. However, Raskolnikov's nerves {{continue to}} wear thinner, and he is constantly struggling {{with the idea of}} confessing, though he knows that he can never be truly convicted. He turns to Sonya for support and confesses <b>his</b> <b>crime</b> to her. By coincidence, Svidrigaïlov has taken up residence in a room next to Sonya's and overhears the entire confession. When the two men meet face to face, Svidrigaïlov acknowledges this fact, and suggests that he may use it against him, should he need to. Svidrigaïlov also speaks of his own past, and Raskolnikov grows to suspect that the rumors about his having committed several murders are true. In a later conversation with Dunya, Svidrigaïlov denies that he had a hand in the death of his wife.|$|E
5|$|Cox falsified {{documents}} {{to make it}} appear that he owned properties, and then fraudulently obtained several mortgages on them for five to six times their actual worth. He acquired millions of dollars this way; estimates report the amount at between US$5 and $25 million. Cox's first conviction occurred in 2002 when he was sentenced to probation for mortgage fraud. He was then fired from the mortgage broker position he held in a Tampa, Florida area firm. He began his life as a dedicated criminal in central Florida after that offense, before fleeing the area when his activities were discovered. <b>His</b> <b>crime</b> spree continued across the southern US, eventually landing him on the United States Secret Service's Most Wanted list. He was aided by several female accomplices, some of whom are in prison or have served time there for their participation in his fraudulent mortgage practices. Cox was arrested on November 16, 2006. Indicted on 42 counts, and facing prison sentences of up to 400 years, he plea bargained his sentence down to a maximum of 54 years on April 11, 2007 and was sentenced to 26 years on November 17, 2006. He is currently housed in a low-security prison in Florida. His story is well chronicled and has been featured on Dateline NBC, CNBC's American Greed, in Fortune magazine, Bloomberg Businessweek, Playboy magazine, and other media outlets.|$|E
