In two of the three genetic studies referenced here, in which is described that samples were taken from several regions of India's Muslim communities, it was again found that the Muslim population was overwhelmingly similar to the local non-Muslims associated, with some having minor but still detectable levels of gene flow from outside, primarily from Iran and Central Asia, rather than directly from the Arabian peninsula.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Consanguineous <b>endogamous</b> <b>marriages</b> {{are common}} {{for women in}} Islam.Over 250 million women of Islamic faith are in <b>endogamous</b> consanguineous <b>marriages,</b> {{typically}} with first cousin marriages. Over 65% of all marriages in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan are endogamous and consanguineous arranged marriages; more than 40% of all <b>marriages</b> are <b>endogamous</b> and consanguineous in Mauritania, Libya, Sudan, Iraq, Iran, Jordan, Syria, Yemen, Kuwait, UAE and Oman.|$|R
25|$|Endogamy {{is common}} in Islamic countries. The {{observed}} endogamy is primarily consanguineous marriages, where the bride and the groom share a biological grandparent or other near ancestor. The most common observed marriages are first cousin marriages, followed by second cousin <b>marriages.</b> Consanguineous <b>endogamous</b> <b>marriages</b> are most common for women in Muslim communities in the Middle East, North Africa and Islamic Central Asia. About 1 in 3 of all marriages in Saudi Arabia, Iran and Pakistan are first cousin marriages; while overall consanguineous <b>endogamous</b> <b>marriages</b> exceed 65 to 80% in various Islamic populations of the Middle East, North Africa and Islamic Central Asia.|$|R

25|$|Such exogamy {{is always}} {{followed}} by the dia-paying group and usually adhered to by the primary lineage, whereas marriage to lineal kin falls within the prohibited range. These traditional strictures against consanguineous marriage ruled out the patrilateral first cousin marriages that are favored by Arab Bedouins and specially approved by Islam. These marriages were practiced to a limited degree by certain northern Somali subclans. In areas inhabited by diverse clans, such as the southern Mogadishu area, endogamous marriages {{also served as a}} means of ensuring clan solidarity in uncertain socio-political circumstances. This inclination was further spurred on by intensified contact with Arab society in the Gulf, wherein first cousin marriage was preferred. Although politically expedient, such <b>endogamous</b> <b>marriage</b> created tension with the traditional principles within Somali culture.|$|E

50|$|The Paradesi Jews (also called White Jews) built one, the Paradesi Synagogue. The {{latter group}} {{was very small}} by {{comparison}} to the Malabaris.

50|$|As {{early as}} 1744, church books mentioned, besides the {{resident}} people, wandering families - the Jenische people. They were pedlars {{and took up}} residence in winter in Neroth.

50|$|According to Rasmussen, Tuareg society {{exhibits}} {{a blend of}} pre-Islamic and Islamic practices. As such, patrilineal Muslim values {{are believed to have}} been superimposed upon the Tuareg's traditional matrilineal society. Other, apparently newer customs include the practice of close-cousin <b>endogamous</b> <b>marriages</b> and polygyny in conformity with Islamic tenets. Polygyny, which has been witnessed among Tuareg chiefs and Islamic scholars, is in turn thought to be contrary to the pre-Islamic monogamous tradition of the nomadic Tuareg.|$|R
50|$|Misinai {{claims that}} the Descendants of Israel had ceased to call {{themselves}} Musta’arbim, when the Brethren of Israel returned to their homeland during the 18th and 19th centuries. Despite this, stories about the Jewish origins of the family were passed on among the Descendants of Israel, and a few Jewish customs were preserved. Both groups began seeing themselves as one people, although <b>endogamous</b> <b>marriages</b> with their own clans ensured the purity of their blood lines until very recently.|$|R
50|$|The Lemba have <b>endogamous</b> <b>marriage</b> patterns, {{discouraging}} {{marriage to}} non-Lemba. Endogamy {{is common to}} many groups. Normative Orthodox Judaism today recognises only matrilineal descent as determining Judaism from birth. Patrilineal descent was once the norm among the Israelites, with people being identified as descendants {{of one of the}} twelve sons of Israel.|$|E
50|$|Some {{studies have}} found that Arab {{practices}} of <b>endogamous</b> <b>marriage</b> also benefitted elder sons and their lines of descent over younger sons and their lines of descent, thus contradicting the idea that in Arab societies, unlike in those of Inner Asia, fraternal birth order played no role at all in family relationships.|$|E

50|$|Religious, {{historical}} and sociocultural factors have helped define {{the bounds of}} endogamy for Muslims {{in some parts of}} Pakistan. There is a preference for <b>endogamous</b> <b>marriages</b> based on the clan-oriented nature of the society, which values and actively seeks similarities in social group identity based on several factors, including religious, sectarian, ethnic, and tribal/clan affiliation. Religious affiliation is itself multilayered and includes religious considerations other than being Muslim, such as sectarian identity (e.g. Shia or Sunni, etc.) and religious orientation within the sect (Isnashari, Ismaili, Ahmedi, etc.).|$|R
50|$|The {{practice}} of <b>endogamous</b> consanguineous <b>marriage</b> dramatically limits the marriagable pool; it inherently encourages marriages arranged according to tradition and birth. Over 1.3 billion people, predominantly of Islamic faith, practice <b>endogamous</b> consanguineous arranged <b>marriages.</b> Consanguineous arranged marriages are presently also observed, though {{to a much}} lesser extent, in some ethnic groups of Africa, India, Indonesia, Polynesia and South America. In Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, majority (65%+) of all <b>marriages</b> are <b>endogamous</b> and consanguineous arranged marriages. More than 40% of all <b>marriages</b> are <b>endogamous</b> and consanguineous in Iraq, Iran, Jordan, Syria, Yemen, Kuwait, UAE, Oman, Sudan, Libya and Mauritania; and over 1 in 5 marriages in Turkey, Egypt, Algeria, regions of Nigeria, India and Malaysia with high Muslim populations are endogamous and consanguineous arranged marriages. Among these Islamic populations, arranged <b>marriages</b> include <b>endogamous</b> and non-consanguineous <b>marriages,</b> and therefore exceed the above observed rates of <b>endogamous</b> and consanguineous <b>marriages.</b>|$|R

50|$|Vedda {{marriage}} is a simple ceremony. It consists of the bride tying a bark rope (diya lanuva) that she has twisted, around the waist of the groom. This symbolizes the bride's acceptance of the man as her mate and life partner. Although <b>endogamous</b> <b>marriage</b> between cross-cousins was the norm until recently, this has changed significantly, with Vedda women even contracting marriages with their Sinhalese and Moor neighbours.|$|E

40|$|To {{determine}} whether there are preferential relationships among individuals from the different parishes of the Ebro River delta region, we analyzed the population relationships, taking into account both the birthplaces of the spouses and their surname frequencies. We used data from the 9, 085 marriages recorded in the Ebro delta area between 1939 and 1995. Using each spouse’s birthplace, we calculated the distances between the subject populations {{by means of the}} squared Euclidean distance. Also, from the surname frequencies in the marriages we obtained certain kinship measurements. In both analyses the results show a clear differentiation between the parish of Amposta {{and the rest of the}} parishes. This difference is mainly due to a greater number of marriages in which delta outsiders participated and can be related to the greater surname diversity and lesser endogamy observed in this population. On the other hand, if only <b>endogamous</b> <b>marriages</b> are taken into account, there is clearly a differentiation between the parishes from both banks of the river, with a strong homogeneity among the northside parishes. We compared the distances obtained from the birthplaces, the kinship parameters obtained from the surnames, and two geographic distance matrixes by means of a Mantel test, and the results show a strong and significant correlation between them when all marriages are considered. If, on the other hand, only <b>endogamous</b> <b>marriages</b> are taken into account, the barrier effect of the river on the interparish relationships can be appreciated...|$|R
40|$|Most {{studies of}} racial {{intermarriage}} {{rely on the}} prevalence of intermarriage to measure the strength of group boundaries, without scrutinizing the nature of intermarriage pairings. Examining the characteristics of intermarried couples reveals that (1) intermarriages and <b>endogamous</b> <b>marriages</b> follow different patterns, and (2) that racial intermarriage pairings reflect a status hierarchy of racial groups inconsistent with a pattern of in-group preference. Evidence from the 1990 US Census PUMS, indicates that patterns in Blacks' and Mexican Americans' marriages with whites suggest that a racial hierarchy disadvantages members of these minority groups. For marriages between Japanese Americans and whites, however, crossing the group boundary does not affect couples' characteristics...|$|R
50|$|<b>Endogamous</b> non-consanguineous <b>marriages</b> {{limit the}} number of {{potential}} partners available, particularly when population size for the religion or caste or group is small; a limited marriagable pool makes locating potential partners challenging, and encourages arranged or quasi-arranged marriages.|$|R
50|$|Many {{of these}} ulema also {{believed}} that {{it is best to}} marry within one own caste. The practice of <b>endogamous</b> <b>marriage</b> in one's caste is strictly observed in India.

5000|$|Consanguineous marriage: {{is a type}} of {{arranged}} <b>endogamous</b> <b>marriage.</b> It is {{one where}} the bride and groom share a grandparent or near ancestor. Examples of these include first cousin marriages, uncle-niece marriages, second cousin marriages, and so on. The most common consanguineous marriages are first cousin marriages, followed by second cousin and uncle-niece marriages. Between 25 and 40% of all marriages in parts of Saudi Arabia and Pakistan are first cousin marriages; while overall consanguineous arranged marriages exceed 65 to 80% in various regions of North Africa and Central Asia.|$|E
5000|$|The {{descendants}} of the meshuchrarim were historically discriminated against in India by other White Jews. They were at the lowest of the Cochin Jewish informal caste ladder. The Paradesi came to use the Paradesi Synagogue; while they allowed the meshuchrarim as Jews to worship there, they had {{to sit in the}} back, could not become full members, and were excluded from the community's <b>endogamous</b> <b>marriage</b> circle. At the same time, they were excluded by the Malabar Jews, the much larger community of Jews who had lived in Cochin for perhaps 1,000 years.|$|E
50|$|Many {{cultures}} traditionally seek <b>endogamous</b> <b>marriages.</b> A prominent {{example of}} this practice is the Hindu culture where {{the bride and groom}} belong to the same caste, but are non-consanguineous, that is the bride and groom are not blood relatives nor extended family members. Other examples of cultures following the <b>endogamous</b> arranged <b>marriage</b> tradition include Amish people in United States, Orthodox Jews in Canada, the United States, Israel, and Western Europe, Arab Christians such as Coptic Christians in Egypt. Marriage was a central feature of traditional Aboriginal societies. Freedom of marriage was restricted to ensure children were produced according to the correct family groups and affiliations and avoid marriages with certain close relatives or marriages with any one outside the group. Marriages were mostly arranged by infant betrothal; it was even possible for a girl to be engaged before she was born. The promised relationship between the young man and woman, creates a series of lifelong responsibilities and obligations. Arranged marriage is also the tradition of many Islamic nations of West Asia and North Africa, but with the difference that between 17% to majority of all marriages in these countries are also consanguineous marriages.|$|R
50|$|The Susu are a patrilineal society, {{predominantly}} Muslim, {{who favor}} <b>endogamous</b> cross-cousin <b>marriages</b> with polygynous households common.

25|$|The Sikh {{literature}} from the Islamic rule and British colonial era mention Varna as Varan, and Jati as Zat or Zat-biradari. Eleanor Nesbitt, {{a professor of}} Religion and author of books on Sikhism, states that the Varan {{is described as a}} class system, while Zat has some caste system features in Sikh literature. In theory, Nesbitt states Sikh literature does not recognise caste hierarchy or differences. In practice, states Nesbitt, widespread endogamy practice among Sikhs has been prevalent in modern times, and poorer Sikhs of disadvantaged castes continue to gather in their own places of worship. Most Sikh families, writes Nesbitt, continue to check the caste of any prospective marriage partner for their children. She notes that all Gurus of Sikhs married within their Zat, and they did not condemn or break with the convention of <b>endogamous</b> <b>marriages</b> for their own children or Sikhs in general.|$|R
5000|$|The Malabari Jews {{had seven}} places of worship; the White Jews had one, the Paradesi Synagogue, which for centuries had been barred to those whom they {{considered}} impure. The contemporary historian Edna Fernandes calls it [...] "a bastion of white purity". The White Jews practised <b>endogamous</b> <b>marriage,</b> which excluded both the meshuchrarim and Malabari Jews (who also practised endogamy that excluded the other groups). The meshuchrarim {{had to sit}} {{in the back of the}} synagogue or outside. The separation resembled Indian discrimination against lower castes, which was sometimes repeated in Christian churches in India.|$|E
50|$|In ancient times, tribal nations {{preferred}} <b>endogamous</b> <b>marriage</b> {{marriage to}} one's relatives; the ideal marriage was usually {{that to a}} cousin, and it was often forbidden for an eldest daughter to even marry outside the family. Marriage to a half-sister, for example, is considered incest by most nations today, but was common behaviour for Egyptian pharaohs; similarly, the Book of Genesis portrays Sarah as marrying Abraham, her half-brother, without criticising the close genetic relationship between them, and the Book of Samuel treats the marriage of a royal prince to his half-sister as unusual, rather than wicked.|$|E

Tabrez takes her home, unafraid of the consequences that may ensue; however, his actions have unwelcome ramifications. Dilawar, his arch-rival, takes full advantage of the situation, and encourages Noor-ul-Ain, Tabrez's first wife and the woman in charge of all his affairs, to take matters into her own hands in order to save her husband from humiliation and disgrace.|$|E
25|$|Leonard and Weller have {{surveyed}} {{marriage and}} genealogical records to study patterns of exogamous inter-caste and <b>endogamous</b> intra-caste <b>marriages</b> in a regional population of India in 1900–1975. They report a striking presence of exogamous marriages across caste lines over time, {{particularly since the}} 1970s. They propose education, economic development, mobility and more interaction between youth as possible reasons for these exogamous marriages.|$|R
50|$|The brotherhoods or clans (bratstvo) are {{contemporary}} patrilineal kin {{groups which}} trace their origin {{to a particular}} male ancestor and share the same surname. The bratstvo is an exogamous group. Names of brotherhoods are derived from either names, nicknames or profession of the ancestor. In most cases marriage within the bratstvo is forbidden regardless of the biological distance between the would-be spouses. However, {{this is not the}} case with some larger brotherhood who sometimes allow <b>endogamous</b> <b>marriages</b> if the genealogical distance between spouses is large enough. In war, the members of the bratstvo (bratstvenici) were obliged to stand together. The size of such units varied in size, ranging from 50 to 800 warriors (1893). Through time the bratstvo would split into smaller subdivisions and acquire separate names. Contemporary surnames of Montenegrins usually come from these smaller units. The members tend to guard their family history and many are able to recite the line of ancestors to the originator of the bratstvo.|$|R
50|$|The puki or camp is {{the basic}} social unit of the Kanjar society. Technically, all those {{who are part of}} the camp are related, and marriages occur with {{individuals}} of other camps, or with unrelated groups that do not affiliate themselves in a camp. The Kanjar are strictly <b>endogamous,</b> and <b>marriages</b> are arranged. Intra-tent or camp disputes are resolved by senior adults, not directly involved in the dispute.|$|R
