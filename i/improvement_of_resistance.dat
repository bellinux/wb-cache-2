40|$|International audienceDimensional {{stabilisation}} is {{a crucial}} property for using wood in most applications. Therefore an isocyanate-free route is proposed, based on the reaction of various diamines with dicarbonates obtained by addition of two glycerol carbonates moieties on a linker. For the initial experiments, the mildest conditions to perform the reaction are researched with model mono- and polyamines without wood: solvent, temperature, number of equivalent and regioselectivity were investigated. Subsequently, beech wood blocks were impregnated by a double vacuum process involving cyclic carbonates and then polyamines. The key step was a polycondensation performed in the beech blocks after the monomers had been impregnated. Resistance of treatment to leaching, anti-swelling efficiency and decay durability versus Poria placenta were evaluated. Results were promising with ASE values of about 70 % for a weight gain of approximately 30 % after leaching.

40|$|Mastitis, a {{mammary gland}} {{inflammation}} {{in response to}} bacterial infection, {{is a major problem}} in the dairy industry. We found that cows susceptible to mastitis have a three-base insertion in a glycine-coding stretch of the gene for forebrain embryonic zinc finger-like (FEZL), a transcription factor with a role in neuronal development. Mastitis induces FEZL expression in mammary glands, and induced FEZL promotes expression of the axon-attracting molecule semaphorin 5 A (SEMA 5 A) through a GCAG sequence. FEZL also induces SEMA 5 A expression in susceptible cattle but at a lower level than in resistant cattle. Enhanced SEMA 5 A induces expression of at least nine genes related to the host’s immune response, including TNF-α and IL- 8. We propose that susceptibility to mastitis results from an impaired immune response due to the lower transcription activity of susceptible FEZL. Our results provide an avenue to select for genetic <b>improvement</b> <b>of</b> <b>resistance</b> to mastitis and suggest that the FEZL–SEMA 5 A pathway might control both neuronal development and innate immunity...|$|E

Mineral addition type is an important factor affecting performance of Self-Compacting Concrete (SCC) in an aggressive environment. Pozzolan from natural sources in Algeria is rarely used in SCC due to the absence of a thorough study of its properties. The goal {{of this study was to}} compare the hydrochloric and sulphuric acid behaviors of a SCC-containing Algerian natural pozzolan with SCC-containing fly ash and limestone filler additions. For this purpose, twelve formulations were prepared with three different strength classes (30, 50, and 70 MPa). After 28 days of curing, the samples were immersed in hydrochloric sulfuric acid solutions for a period of 12 weeks. The changes in mass loss and compressive strength loss for each acid solution within the test period were recorded.

40|$|Glucosinolates are amino acid-derived natural {{products}} that, upon hydrolysis, typically release isothiocyanates {{with a wide}} range of biological activities. Glucosinolates play a role in plant defense as attractants and deterrents against herbivores and pathogens. A key step in glucosinolate biosynthesis is the conversion of amino acids to the corresponding aldoximes, which is catalyzed by cytochromes P 450 belonging to the CYP 79 family. Expression of CYP 79 D 2 from cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz.) in Arabidopsis resulted in the production of valine (Val) - and isoleucine-derived glucosinolates not normally found in this ecotype. The transgenic lines showed no morphological phenotype, and the level of endogenous glucosinolates was not affected. The novel glucosinolates were shown to constitute up to 35 % of the total glucosinolate content in mature rosette leaves and up to 48 % in old leaves. Furthermore, at increased concentrations of these glucosinolates, the proportion of Val-derived glucosinolates decreased. As the isothiocyanates produced from the Val- and isoleucine-derived glucosinolates are volatile, metabolically engineered plants producing these glucosinolates have acquired novel properties with great potential for <b>improvement</b> <b>of</b> <b>resistance</b> to herbivorous insects and for biofumigation...|$|E
