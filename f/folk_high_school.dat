Although <b>folk</b> <b>high</b> <b>schools</b> still reflect the concepts espoused by Grundtvig, they have been under pressure to change in response to the demands of the economic rationalist state, including funding cuts and the requirement that additional courses must be self-funding.

40|$|<b>Folk</b> <b>high</b> <b>schools</b> {{have often}} been out of synchronisation: both behind the times and as pioneers, and always eager {{to keep up with}} their unique identity. There have been {{variations}} over time and simultaneously. <b>Folk</b> <b>high</b> <b>schools</b> are diverse. <b>Folk</b> <b>high</b> <b>schools</b> are economically vulnerable and dependent on external funding. Reduced governmental subsidies and new forms of governance introduced in the 1990 s have challenged the institutionalized ways to consider and to run the <b>Folk</b> <b>high</b> <b>schools.</b> The aim of this dissertation is to investigate changes in instutituional logica and identities over time. As the title of this thesis, <b>Folk</b> <b>High</b> <b>Schools</b> in a changing field, suggests, one of the key concepts of the discussion is organizational fields. Organizational fields are perceived as organizations with common structures and aims, operating in a nonlocal environment, kept together by a common meaning system and the conviction that they need each other. The concept of organizational fields is one of the fundamental ideas developed within new institutionalism in organization theory. New institutionalism’s focus has shifted from the individual organization to interaction between organizations and the environment. An organizational field is kept together by cultural frames or patterns of meaning. By employing the concept of organizational field as a tool it has been possible to analyze how the ideas and identities of <b>folk</b> <b>high</b> <b>schools</b> are constructed. The results show that a comprehensive diversification of <b>folk</b> <b>high</b> <b>schools</b> has taken place. The schools have differentiated themselves over time and from each other in terms of their activities and owners. Their relations to the environment are increasingly based on business commissions. The results also show that the school’s activities are increasingly short term focused and quickly carried out. This leads to new and more temporary relations. In the long term, this challenges the common meaning system and the very idea about <b>folk</b> <b>high</b> schools’ uniqueness...|$|R

Serving as savings bank director {{as well as}} mayor of Sogndal, he was the manager of Sogndal <b>folk</b> <b>high</b> <b>school</b> from its foundation, but left that post to his brother Hersleb Sverdrup after a few years, before Henrik Mohn Dahl took over. In 1878 Jakob Sverdrup left Sogndal to become vicar in Leikanger. As a theologian, Sverdrup was a pietist, and sided with the laity movement, proposing that lay priests be given the right to preach. Together with Ole Vollan he had started the magazine Ny Luthersk Kirketidende in 1877, an organ which spoke against the Conservative High Church Lutheranism of the time. Sverdrup also published several pamphlets during his life, and in 1897 he published Forklaring over Luthers lille katekisme af J. R. Sverdrup, a revision of the explanation of Luther's Small Catechism originally written by his father.|$|E

500|$|Of great {{significance}} was Nielsen's {{contribution to the}} 1922 publication, [...] Folkehøjskolens Melodibog (The <b>Folk</b> <b>High</b> <b>School</b> Songbook), {{of which he was}} one of the editors together with Thomas Laub, Oluf Ring and Thorvald Aagaard. The book contained about 600 melodies, of which about 200 were composed by the editors, and was intended to provide a repertoire for communal singing, an integral part of Danish folk culture. The collection was extremely popular and became embedded in the Danish educational system. During the German occupation of Denmark in World War II, mass song gatherings, using these melodies, were part of Denmark's [...] "spiritual re-armament", and after the war in 1945 Nielsen's contributions were characterised by one writer as [...] "shining jewels in our treasure-chest of patriotic songs". This remains a significant factor in Danish assessment of the composer.|$|E

Forty percent of them did so for professional reasons. Adult education appeared in a number of forms, such as secondary evening schools, civic and workers' institutes, study centres, vocational course centres, and <b>folk</b> <b>high</b> <b>schools.</b> Study centres allowed groups to follow study plans of their own making, with educational and financial assistance provided by the state. <b>Folk</b> <b>high</b> <b>schools</b> are a distinctly Nordic institution.

500|$|On July 11, 1886, {{a meeting}} {{was held at}} the home of P.N. Clausen at which the Danebod {{congregation}} was formally organized with fifteen members. The church council consisted of its president, P.N. Clausen, secretary M.Lauritsen, and treasurer Jørgen Jacobsen. At first there were no regular church services and no resident pastor. Instead, the people met in various homes to sing Danish hymns and listen to a reading of the sermon by a layman. The pastor of Sleepy Eye, Minnesota, S.C. Madsen, and other ministers occasionally conducted services in town. The congregation later hired the Danish settler, pastor Hans Jørgen Pedersen (1851–1905) of Gowen, Michigan. He arrived with his family on April12, 1888. Pedersen had a humble upbringing in Denmark, where he later studied at Ryslinge <b>Folk</b> <b>High</b> <b>School</b> before emigrating to America in 1875. He was an eloquent preacher, resourceful, and became involved in community activities throughout the area. He quickly assumed leadership and thus, in a sense, became the founder of Danebod. One of the pastor's six children, Sigurd Pedersen, described their first arrival in Danebod in his autobiography: [...] "It was a chilly morning, when the committee stood on the platform to bid welcome to the new pastor and his wife, trailed by six children, and the rear held up by the trusty hired man, Søren Olsen, who was to keep count of the straying flock and see that the last luggage was not forgotten. Friends invited us over for breakfast in the home of H.J. Nelsen, the merchant. Then the committee guided us to a small house on the corner just west of the present-day Chevrolet dealer, where businessman Carl Cold Sorensen brought the first automobiles to the area in the early 1900's. The committee had left no kindling in this small house, but Søren Olsen soon discovered that the kitchen range was in place and claimed to be able to manipulate the same if kindling could be provided. Across the street was a large general store, and father sent us there to beg Mr.Lauritsen for some kindling. We were given old boxes to break up, and we soon had our arms full and Søren had a blazing fire in a few minutes." [...] In September 1888, it was decided at a convention in Elk Horn, Iowa, to give the congregation at Danebod [...] of land, and the Danebod Lutheran Church was dedicated on Sunday, June16, 1895. Pedersen died in 1905, and the Reverend Thorvald Knudsen succeeded him at Danebod.|$|E

2500|$|The {{dark brown}} colours of the {{weathered}} upper layers give {{the name to}} the Brown (or Middle) Jurassic. The colours {{are a result of}} highly concentrated iron. The layer of the Dogger which is 135m thick forms the main part of Hesselberg's slopes. The lowest sub-layer (Dogger alpha) is formed of 75m thick Opalinus-clay. The soil of these layers is very susceptible to landslides which has resulted in the unevenness of the meadows. On top of the Opalinus-clay lies a layer of iron sandstone (Dogger beta), which is 40m thick. This layer is very distinctive due to its steep rise. Because the Opalinus-clay layer is impervious to water, a spring horizon has formed at the transition to the iron sandstone. The layers of Dogger gamma (Sowerbyi layers) (1 m), Dogger delta (Ostreen-lime) (4m), and Dogger epsilon (Oolith-lime) (2m) are summarised under the term [...] "ooliths". These layers contain many fossils. On {{the very top of the}} Middle Jurassic layers is the Ornate's clay layer (Dogger zeta), which is only 2m thick.
