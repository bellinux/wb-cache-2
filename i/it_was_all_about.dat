In 2007, former Rockstar employee Jeff Williams revealed that even the game's staff were somewhat uncomfortable about the level of violence; [...] "there was almost a mutiny at the company over that game". Williams explained that the game [...] "just made us all feel icky. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> the violence, and it was realistic violence.

There was too much discipline and routine involved.

Professor Sohail Daulatzai views this labeling as significant, since it transforms Illmatic into [...] "a sonic map." [...] The album serves as the legend for Nas’s ghetto cartography, as he narrates his experiences and {{those who live in}} the Queensbridge” [...] In a 2009 interview with XXL, Nas discussed the purpose behind the album artwork among other promotional efforts, stating [...] "Really the record had to represent everything Nasir Jones is about from beginning to end, from my album cover to my videos. My record company had to beg me to stop filmin' music videos in the projects. No matter what the song was about I had 'em out there.

500|$|The New Directions set {{of three}} Jackson family numbers was favorably {{reviewed}} by most critics, though they didn't necessarily agree on which songs were most effective. Bell couldn't decide whether she enjoyed these three songs or the Troubletones mash-up more, and West felt the [...] "choreography on {{the whole thing was}} stellar", and graded it an [...] "A+". Votta singled out [...] "ABC", which demonstrated [...] "what a lovely singer Tina is", and Kubicek said he enjoyed it [...] "mostly because Tina deserves more singing time, and I love the fact that Mike is now an actual singer who gets his own solos". Chaney called it [...] "a solid performance" [...] and gave it a B+, while Futterman wrote that it [...] "felt like a flashback to the New Directions' group performances of yesteryear, when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> an over-the-top, feel-good attitude". The dancing in [...] "Control" [...] was highlighted in many reviews: Hyman and Slezak were complimentary, but Chaney wrote that the [...] "choreography seemed a little awkward and occasionally out of synch", that it was [...] "the least effective of the three Jackson numbers" [...] and added that for her [...] "this felt dated when it could have been retro-fresh"; she graded the song a [...] "C". However, Futterman made mention of the [...] "slick dance moves", and Votta noted that the [...] "jazz band guys" [...] were [...] "holding their own with the background dancing through the whole number". However, for Kubicek, the song [...] "definitely brought down the energy at the middle of their performance". Bell characterized the final song as [...] "an amazing 'Man in the Mirror' cover", and Chaney said it was [...] "the best of their three songs", and gave it an [...] "A−". However, Slezak wrote that it [...] "proved to be a tonally jarring ending to the performance".|$|E
500|$|Krrish {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics in India. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama {{believed that the}} film surpassed expectations, but felt that there were issues with pacing in first hour. Overall, he deemed Krrish to be [...] "a terrifically exciting and compelling experience", and awarded the film 4.5 of 5 stars. Nikhat Kazmi noted in The Times of India that while the superhero and action sequences were appealing, there were not enough of them. He was also not excited by the romantic parts, comparing them to a sightseeing tour, first in India and then in Singapore. He said that overall, this film lacks the fun of its predecessor. On the other hand, Raja Sen said that Krrish was infinitely better than KMG, though ultimately <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> Hrithik Roshan. Sen and Sukanya Verma, writing for Rediff, both gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, and both {{said that it was}} a good film for children. Sen summarised [...] "So, is it a good superhero movie? No, but it's well-intentioned. It's a full-on kiddie movie, and while a lot of us might be scornful of Krrish, it's heartening to see fantasy officially entering mainstream Bollywood." [...] Verma agreed with other critics that it took too long for the action to get started, and said that a lot of attention was spent showing off Roshan's muscles. He summarised, [...] "Krrish neither has the sleek aura nor the deep-rooted ideology of superheroes. What it does have is a super spirited performance from Hrithik Roshan, which is likely to appeal to children. And that's worth a three-star cheer." [...] Saibal Chatterjee wrote in the Hindustan Times that Krrish is a hackneyed, formulaic masala film, with special effects added on top, and hoped that this would not be the future of Bollywood. Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN condemned the screenplay and thought that the only thing that made the film watchable was the acting of Hrithik Roshan. He gave the film only 2 out of 5 stars, saying [...] "Krrish is only an average film that could have been so much better if the makers had concentrated as hard on its story as they did on its action and stunts." ...|$|E
