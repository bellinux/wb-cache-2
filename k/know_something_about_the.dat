25|$|There {{are mixed}} results in how {{important}} phonological information is to deaf individuals when reading {{and when that}} information is obtained. Alphabets, abugidas, abjads, and syllabaries all seem to require the reader/writer to <b>know</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> phonology of their target language prior to learning the system. Profoundly deaf children {{do not have access}} to the same auditory base that hearing children do. Orally trained deaf children do not always use phonological information in reading tasks, word recognition tasks or homophonic tasks; however, deaf signers who are not orally trained do utilize phonological information in word-rhyming tasks. Furthermore when performing on tasks with phonologically confusable initial sounds, hearing readers made more errors than deaf readers. Yet when given sentences that are sublexically confusable when translated into ASL, deaf readers made more errors than hearing readers. The body of literature clearly shows that skilled deaf readers can employ phonological skills, even if they don’t all the time; without additional longitudinal studies it is uncertain if a profoundly deaf person must <b>know</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> phonology of the target language to become a skilled reader (less than 75% of the deaf population) or if by becoming a skilled reader a deaf person learns how to employ phonological skills of the target language.|$|E
2500|$|The {{change in}} Popular Science Monthly was dramatic. The old version was a {{scholarly}} journal that had {{eight to ten}} articles in a 100-page issue. There would be ten to twenty photographs or illustrations. The new version had hundreds of short, easy to read articles with hundreds of illustrations. Editor Kaempffert was writing for [...] "the home craftsman and hobbyist who wanted to <b>know</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> world of science." [...] The circulation doubled in the first year.|$|E

[...] When he visited the artist's studio, McCaughey writes, he made a point to say that he was interested in the return of the painting, not a conviction for the crime: [...] "I said deliberately, at least twice, that the people who had taken the work could deposit it in a luggage locker at Spencer Street railway station or at Tullamarine Airport." ...|$|E

2500|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the usefulness of}} these reactions, {{in addition to the}} reactants, the products, and the energy released, one needs to <b>know</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> cross section. Any given fusion device has a maximum plasma pressure it can sustain, and an economical device would always operate near this maximum. Given this pressure, the largest fusion output is obtained when the temperature is chosen so that /T2 is a maximum. This is also the temperature at which the value of the triple product nTτ required for ignition is a minimum, since that required value is inversely proportional to /T2 (see Lawson criterion). (A plasma is [...] "ignited" [...] if the fusion reactions produce enough power to maintain the temperature without external heating.) This optimum temperature and the value of /T2 at that temperature is given for a few of these reactions in the following table.|$|E
2500|$|The proposal, {{originally}} {{known as}} “Project Cauldron”, was devised by geologist Manley L. Natland at Los Angeles-based Richfield Oil Corporation. Natland believed that an underground blast {{was the most}} efficient way to generate the heat needed to liquefy the viscous bitumen so that it could be pumped to the surface by conventional wells. The project was conceived of as part of Operation Plowshare, a United States project to harness the nuclear explosions for peaceful applications. However, some experts had doubts. In 1959, oil sands pioneer Robert Fitzsimmons of the International Bitumen Company wrote a letter to the Edmonton Journal, saying [...] "While the writer does not know anything about nuclear energy and is therefore not qualified to make any definite statement as to it’s [...] results he does <b>know</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> effect dry heat has on those sands and ventures a guess that if it does not turn the whole deposit into a burning inferno it is almost sure to fuse it into a solid mass of semi glass or coke." ...|$|E
