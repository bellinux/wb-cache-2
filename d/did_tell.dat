5|$|Although {{the assault}} {{is known to}} popular history as Pickett's Charge, overall command was given to James Longstreet, and Pickett {{was one of his}} {{division}}al commanders. Lee <b>did</b> <b>tell</b> Longstreet that Pickett's fresh division should lead the assault, so the name is appropriate, although some recent historians have used the name Pickett-Pettigrew-Trimble Assault (or, less frequently, Longstreet's Assault) to more fairly distribute the credit (or blame). With Hill sidelined, Pettigrew's and Trimble's divisions were delegated to Longstreet's authority as well. Thus, Pickett's name has been lent to a charge in which he commanded 3 out of the 11 brigades while under the supervision of his corps commander throughout. Pickett's men were almost exclusively from Virginia, with the other divisions consisting of troops from North Carolina, Mississippi, Alabama, and Tennessee. The supporting troops under Wilcox and Lang were from Alabama and Florida.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{increase}} her resistance to pain he would drop hot sealing wax {{on her back and}} arms or stick pins in her, commanding her not to cry out. He would test her ability to keep secrets by telling her that his life was in danger and she should tell no one. To increase her resistance to the cold, Day instructed Sabrina to wade into Stowe Pool until the water reached her neck, then lie in the nearby meadow until her clothes and hair had dried in the sun. Finally, to test her resistance to luxury, he gave her a big box of handmade silk clothes and had her throw them on a fire. Day had limited success with these techniques. Sabrina became able to endure hot wax dripped on her arm without flinching, but she <b>did</b> <b>tell</b> others of his secret techniques, and could not help screaming whenever he fired his gun at her.|$|E
5|$|Payne ran {{for reelection}} in 1876 but was {{defeated}} by Republican Amos Townsend. He remained involved in politics, however, and even considered running for the Democratic nomination for President in 1880. Tilden, while not officially a candidate, wielded a heavy influence over the convention. Tilden was ambiguous about his willingness to participate in another campaign, leading some delegates to defect to other candidates, while others stayed loyal to their old standard-bearer. Tilden <b>did</b> <b>tell</b> some of his close supporters that, {{if he did not}} run, Payne would be his first choice and House Speaker Samuel J. Randall his second. With that, many of the Tilden loyalists pledged their support to Payne, at least until Tilden decided to enter the race. Although Tilden ultimately declined to be nominated, Payne's chances were hindered when Ohio's delegation remained loyal to Senator Allen G. Thurman. Although Payne place third on the convention's first ballot, on the second the delegates stampeded to General Winfield Scott Hancock, who was nominated.|$|E

5|$|Wiseau {{has been}} secretive about {{exactly how he}} {{obtained}} the funding for the project, but he <b>did</b> <b>tell</b> Entertainment Weekly that he made {{some of the money}} by importing leather jackets from Korea. According to Sestero in his book The Disaster Artist, Wiseau was already independently wealthy at the time production began, having amassed a fortune over several years of entrepreneurship and real estate development in and around Los Angeles and San Francisco. The budget for The Room reached , all of which was spent on production and marketing. Wiseau has stated that the reason the film was relatively expensive was because many members of the cast and crew had to be replaced, and each of the cast members had several understudies. According to Sestero, Wiseau made numerous poor decisions during filming that unnecessarily inflated the film's budget, such as building sets for sequences that could have been filmed on location, purchasing unnecessary equipment, and filming identical scenes multiple times using different sets. Sestero further wrote that the film's budget skyrocketed as a result of minutes-long dialogue sequences taking hours or days to shoot due to Wiseau's inability to properly remember his lines or move to the appropriate place on camera.|$|E
25|$|High school {{students}} in every riding in Ontario were allowed to cast ballots in their classrooms {{as part of a}} student vote. While their numbers did not count in the official election, they <b>did</b> <b>tell</b> a story all on their own. The student vote reflected change a lot more than the actual result, as well as widespread anti-conservatism. 93 ridings favoured the Liberals in the student vote, nine favoured the New Democrats, and one favoured the Greens, while the Conservatives were shut out. There was also a vote for elementary students.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the early}} 1920s, {{there has been}} {{speculation}} that Davies and Hearst had a child together some time between 1920 and 1923. The child was rumored to be Patricia Lake (née Van Cleve), who was publicly identified as Davies' niece. On October 3, 1993, Lake died of complications from lung cancer in Indian Wells, California. Ten hours before her death, Lake requested that her son publicly announce {{that she was not}} Davies' niece but Davies' biological daughter, whom she had conceived with Hearst. Lake had never commented on her alleged paternity in public, even after Hearst's and Davies' deaths, but <b>did</b> <b>tell</b> her grown children and friends. Lake's claim was published in her death notice, which was published in newspapers.|$|E

500|$|After {{graduating from}} Princeton in 1971, Berg decided {{to expand the}} thesis into a {{full-length}} biography, thinking it would take around nine months. He also formulated a career plan at this time, and later recalled: [...] "I <b>did</b> <b>tell</b> myself early on: I {{think it would be}} interesting, perhaps, to spend a career writing a half-dozen biographies of twentieth-century American cultural figures—each one, as I often use as my metaphor, a different wedge of the great apple pie." [...] The Perkins biography, Max Perkins: Editor of Genius, took longer than Berg anticipated and was eventually published in 1978, winning a National Book Award in Biography. In 2016, The New Yorker credited Berg with [...] "almost single-handedly rescu Maxwell Perkins from the anonymity he desired." ...|$|E
500|$|Reich {{was taught}} at home {{until he was}} 12, when his mother was {{discovered}} {{having an affair with}} his live-in tutor. Reich wrote about the affair in 1920 in his first published paper, [...] "Über einen Fall von Durchbruch der Inzestschranke" [...] ("About a Case of Breaching the Incest Taboo"), presented in the third person as though about a patient. He wrote that he would follow his mother when she went to the tutor's bedroom at night, feeling ashamed and jealous, and wondering if they would kill him if they found out that he knew. He briefly thought of forcing her to have sex with him, on pain of threatening to tell his father. In the end, he <b>did</b> <b>tell</b> his father, and after a protracted period of beatings, his mother committed suicide in 1910, for which Reich blamed himself.|$|E

500|$|Harper Lee {{was pleased}} with the movie, saying: [...] "In that film the man and the part met... I've had many, many offers to turn it into musicals, into TV or stage plays, but I've always refused. That film was a work of art." [...] Peck met Lee's father, the model for Atticus, before the filming. Lee's father died before the film's release, and Lee was so {{impressed}} with Peck's performance that she gave him her father's pocketwatch, which he had with him the evening he was awarded the Oscar for Best Actor. Years later, he was reluctant to tell Lee that the watch was stolen out of his luggage in London Heathrow Airport. When Peck eventually <b>did</b> <b>tell</b> Lee, he said she responded, [...] "'Well, it's only a watch.' Harper—she feels deeply, but she's not a sentimental person about things." [...] Lee and Peck shared a friendship long after the movie was made. Peck's grandson was named [...] "Harper" [...] in her honor.|$|E
500|$|He took a boat {{to inspect}} the {{destruction}} around Pudding Lane at close range and describes a [...] "lamentable" [...] fire, [...] "everybody endeavouring to remove their goods, and flinging into the river or bringing them into lighters that lay off; poor people staying in their houses as long as till the very fire touched them, and then running into boats, or clambering from one pair of stairs by the water-side to another." [...] Pepys continued westward on the river to the court at Whitehall, [...] "where people come about me, and did give them an account dismayed them all, and word was carried in to the King. So I was called for, and <b>did</b> <b>tell</b> the King and Duke of Yorke what I saw, and that unless His Majesty did command houses to be pulled down nothing could stop the fire. They seemed much troubled, and the King commanded {{me to go to}} my Lord Mayor from him, and command him to spare no houses, but to pull down before the fire every way." [...] Charles' brother James, Duke of York offered the use of the Royal Life Guards to help fight the fire.|$|E
500|$|A pre-taped {{performance}} of Brown performing {{a medley of}} [...] "Beautiful People" [...] and [...] "Forever" [...] was shown on the American version of Dancing with the Stars on March 29, 2011. For the performance Brown wore {{a black and white}} suit, and was accompanied by a group of robotic dancers dressed in all-white suits adorned with LED lighting for a futuristic Tron-like affect. Prior to the performance some of the show's cast were unhappy that Brown was going to perform because of the domestic violence assault that occurred with his then-girlfriend Rihanna in 2009. Brown was sentenced to five years of probation, ordered to complete more than 1,400 hours of community service and was given a restraining order which required him to stay away from Rihanna. Professional dancer Cheryl Burke told Extra, [...] "As a victim of domestic violence, I don't agree with him coming on the show, but it's out of my control", while host Tom Bergeron told the On Air with Ryan Seacrest radio show that, [...] "I <b>did</b> <b>tell</b> the producers it may be to their advantage to not have me interview him, because my natural tendency would be to say something.

For the performance, Brown wore a tomato red tuxedo and a black shirt and bow tie. The performance started off with a young boy doing break dancing moves and announcing, 'Here is Chris Brown'. Brown then appeared doing flips and somersaults, as he lip-synced most of the song. The performance earned him a standing ovation from the judges {{and members of the}} crowd.

500|$|The {{survivors}} {{split up}} {{into two groups}} {{to head to the}} Others' camp. Michael Dawson (Harold Perrineau), Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox), Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly), James [...] "Sawyer" [...] Ford (Josh Holloway), and Hugo [...] "Hurley" [...] Reyes (Jorge Garcia) walk on land to the camp, bringing guns and ammunition with them. Meanwhile, Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews), Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim), and Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) plan to use Desmond's sailboat to go by sea. Sayid plans to use black smoke as a signal, saying that [...] "this time, they will know that we are coming", a reference to the attacks in the first-season finale. When the boat reaches the Others' camp, Sayid finds it to be deserted. Meanwhile, Michael, Jack, Sawyer, Hurley and Kate engage in a gun battle with some Others that were following them, and Sawyer kills one. Jack confronts Michael about leading the group into a trap, and Michael confesses to the murders of Ana Lucia and Libby. They realize that Michael has led them to a location other than the beach, ruining their former plan to meet up with Sayid. There, they see a large pile of pneumatic tubes, suggesting that the reports sent out from the [...] discovered in the episode [...] "?" [...] had never been read. Shortly after the discovery of the tube pile, they hear whispers, and suddenly Sawyer, Kate, and Jack are incapacitated by electric darts. The hostages, bound and gagged, are brought to a dock, where it appears that the Others are led by Henry Gale (Michael Emerson). Gale keeps his bargain with Michael, returning his son, Walt Lloyd (Malcolm David Kelley), to him and giving them an old fishing boat with instructions to sail on a heading of 325 degrees until they are rescued. Michael threatens Henry that he could tell the outside world of the island's location. Henry responds by telling him that it wouldn't matter as they {{would not be able to}} find the island, should they return. He also gives Michael a counter-threat: if he <b>did</b> <b>tell</b> people of the island's location, people would know what he did to get his son back. Michael reluctantly accepts but asks who Henry and his people are, to which Henry responds [...] "We're the good guys, Michael". Michael uses the boat to get him and Walt off the island. Hurley is then released and sent back to the other survivors with a message that they are to stay away from the Others' part of the island. As Hurley is let go, the other three captives are taken away.|$|E
