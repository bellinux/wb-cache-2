40|$|CONTEXT: <b>Endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> is {{considered}} a highly accurate procedure for diagnosing small pancreatic tumors and assessing their locoregional extension. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of <b>endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> on the management of pancreatic adenocarcinoma in clinical practice. PATIENTS: Sixty-four consecutive patients (mean age 70. 5 plus/minus 11. 9 years) hospitalized for staging or diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma were retrospectively (from January 1995 to November 1997) or prospectively studied (from December 1997 to August 1999). SETTING: Group 1 consisted of 52 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma which was discovered using computerized tomography scanning and/or ultrasound. <b>Endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> was utilized for staging purposes only in patients who {{were considered to be}} operable and the tumor to be resectable based on computerized tomography scanning criteria. Group 2 consisted of 12 patients who were diagnosed as having a pancreatic adenocarcinoma using <b>endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> whereas computerized tomography scanning and ultrasound was negative.

40|$|AbstractObjective: <b>Endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> is {{frequently}} used to locally stage esophageal cancer, but few studies exist to validate its accuracy for lymph node metastases. Our {{objective was to}} compare <b>endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> with video-assisted thoracoscopic and laparoscopic staging in evaluating lymph node metastases in esophageal cancer. Methods: Twenty-six patients with potentially resectable esophageal cancer were identified by conventional imaging. <b>Endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> was performed followed by laparoscopic and thoracoscopic staging, and locoregional staging was compared. Results: In eight patients <b>endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> indicated N 0 disease, but laparoscopy and thoracoscopy documented N 1 disease in six. In five of 26 (19 %) obstruction prevented endoscopic ultrasonography; three had N 1 by laparoscopy and thoracoscopy. Thirteen patients had N 1 disease according to <b>endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography,</b> and 12 of 13 (92 %) had N 1 disease by laparoscopy and thoracoscopy. The sensitivity and specificity of <b>endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> for nodal evaluation were 65 % and 66 %, respectively.

40|$|Abstract:Indications for remediastinoscopy include {{recurrent}} {{and second}} primary lung cancer, an inadequate first procedure, lung cancer occurring after an unrelated disease such as lymphoma, and restaging after induction therapy. Nowadays, restaging {{is the most}} frequent indication for remediastinoscopy. Only patients with proven mediastinal downstaging will benefit from a subsequent surgical resection. In contrast to imaging or functional studies, remediastinoscopy provides pathologic evidence of response after induction therapy. Although technically more challenging than a first procedure, remediastinoscopy can select patients for subsequent thoracotomy and provides prognostic information. In most recent series, sensitivity of remediastinoscopy is higher than 70 % with an accuracy of approximately 85 %. Survival also depends on the findings at remediastinoscopy, with patients with persisting mediastinal involvement having a poor prognosis. An alternative approach consists {{of the use of}} minimally invasive staging procedures as endobronchial or <b>endoscopic</b> esophageal <b>ultrasonography</b> to obtain initial proof of mediastinal nodal involvement.

Ultrasonography and computed tomography showed a nodular lesion in the fundus of the gallbladder, indicating the possibility of a gallbladder carcinoma. <b>Endoscopic</b> retrograde <b>ultrasonography</b> showed the tumor in the fundus of the gallbladder and thickness of the surrounding epithelium. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography revealed a normal pancreaticobiliary junction without the common channel and a mild dilatation of the common bile duct (15 mm in the diameter). An open cholecystectomy and partial resection of the liver bed of the gallbladder with regional lymphadenectomy were performed.

30|$|However, {{in adult}} cases with {{no signs of}} diffuse peritonitis, it might be {{possible}} to perform transient biliary drainage using an endoscopic or percutaneous approach. This strategy is not common, but it has several advantages. First, this strategy can be used as a less invasive alternative to emergency drainage by laparotomy for patients in bad general condition. Using endoscopic or percutaneous biliary drainage as a bridging procedure, definitive single-stage surgery can be performed when inflammation has improved and the patient is in better condition. The second advantage is that additional examinations can be performed before the definitive surgery while the patient recovers from the inflammatory state. These examinations could make the preoperative evaluation and diagnosis more precise, including assessment of malignant potential. <b>Endoscopic</b> or intraductal <b>ultrasonography,</b> for example, might be effective for preoperative diagnosis due to their high diagnostic accuracy [28, 29]. Bile cytology also could be helpful for diagnosis. Cholangiography taken by the cyst drainage tube would be extremely helpful to plan the optimal definitive surgery. If any signs of malignancy are indicated, R 0 surgery and additional lymphadenectomy should be considered. In our case, owing to biliary drainage, multimodal examinations enabled precise evaluation, and helped to simulate the optimal definitive surgery.|$|R
40|$|The role of <b>endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> in the {{management}} of cystic lesions of the pancreas Objective. To review the role of <b>endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> in {{the management}} of cystic lesions of the pancreas. Data sources. MEDLINE literature search (1998 - 2003). Study selection. Key words for the literature search were ‘endoscopic ultrasonography’, ‘pancreas’, ‘pseudocyst’, and ‘cystic tumor’. Data extraction. All relevant studies were reviewed. Data synthesis. In the management of cystic lesions of the pancreas, <b>endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> appears to be superior to percutaneous ultrasonography, computed tomography, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, because it can achieve detailed imaging of both the pancreatic parenchymal tissue and the ductal anatomy simultaneously with a high-frequency ultrasound examination at a close proximity. <b>Endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> can differentiate benign pseudocysts or benign cystic lesions from malignant neoplasms of the pancreas; the distinction is crucial in the surgical treatment of the patients. The diagnostic accuracy can be further enhanced with endoscopic ultrasonography– guided fine-needle aspiration of the cystic fluid to detect tumour markers and cytological examination. Endoscopic ultrasonography–guided aspiration with or without endoscopic cystogastrostomy or cystoduodenostomy has become the treatment of choice for patients with pancreatic pseudocysts. The procedure is associated with decreased morbidity and mortality when compared with open surgery.

The most common presenting clinical feature, obstructive jaundice, usually occurs with advanced disease. Diagnostic tools currently available are therefore either performed too late or {{are not able to}} detect early disease stage. Imaging procedures for diagnosis and staging are ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging with cholangiopancreaticography, intravenous bolus-enhanced spiral computed tomography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography. Before initiating any palliative measure, a proper staging and a surgical consultation at a hepatobiliary center is necessary. To assess resectability, additional diagnostic methods like angiography, positron emission tomography, cholangioscopy, <b>endoscopic</b> or intraluminal <b>ultrasonography</b> and finally even explorative laparoscopy may be required.

Scintigraphy with (123) I-MIBG (meta-iodobenzylguanidine) is sensitive in the identification of chromaffin cell tumours, although scintigraphy with (111) In-pentetreotide may also have a role in the localization of malignant chromaffin cell tumours and medullary thyroid carcinoma; for further localization and monitoring of the response to treatment both CT and MRI are used with high diagnostic accuracy. More recently, positron emission tomography (PET) scanning is being increasingly used for the localization of NETs, particularly when other imaging modalities have failed, although its precise role and utility remain to be defined. Surgery is still the usual initial therapeutic, and only curative, modality of choice; however, the majority of NETs will require further treatment with somatostatin analogues and/or interferon; chemotherapy may be used for progressive and highly aggressive NETs, but its role has not been clearly defined. For those NETs that demonstrate uptake to a diagnostic scan with (123) I-MIBG or (111) In-octreotide, therapy with radionuclides such as (131) I-MIBG or (111) In/(90) Y-octreotide or other isotopes, presents a further evolving therapeutic modality...|$|R
40|$|Gastric varices {{that arise}} {{secondary}} to the splenic vein occlusion can result in gastrointestinal hemorrhaging. <b>Endoscopic</b> color Doppler <b>ultrasonography</b> (ECDUS) was performed in 16 patients with gastric varices secondary to splenic vein occlusion. This study retrospectively evaluated the role of ECDUS in the diagnosis of gastric varices secondary to splenic vein occlusion. Thirteen patients had co-existing pancreatic diseases: 8 with chronic pancreatitis, 4 with cancer of the pancreatic body or tail and 1 with severe acute pancreatitis. Of the remaining 3 patients, 1 had myeloproliferative disease, 1 had advanced gastric cancer, and the third had splenic vein occlusion due to an obscure cause. The endoscopic findings of gastric varices were: variceal form (F) classified as enlarged tortuous (F 2) in 12 cases and large, coil-shaped (F 3) in 4 cases, and positive for erosion or red color sign of the variceal surface in 4 cases and negative in 12 cases. ECDUS color flow images of gastric variceal flow clearly depicted a round fundal region at the center, with varices expanding to the curvatura ventriculi major of the gastric body in all 16 cases. The velocities of F 3 type gastric varices {{were significantly higher than}} those of the F 2 type. The wall thickness of varices positive for erosion or red color sign was significantly less than the negative cases. I conclude that ECDUS color flow images of gastric variceal flow depicted specific findings of gastric varices secondary to splenic vein occlusion at the round fundal region at the center, with varices expanding to the curvatura ventriculi major of the gastric body...|$|R

40|$|Objective. To {{review the}} role of <b>endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> in the {{management}} of cystic lesions of the pancreas. Data sources. MEDLINE literature search (1998 - 2003). Study selection. Key words for the literature search were 'endoscopic ultrasonography', 'pancreas', 'pseudocyst', and 'cystic tumor'. Data extraction. All relevant studies were reviewed. Data synthesis. In the management of cystic lesions of the pancreas, <b>endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> appears to be superior to percutaneous ultrasonography, computed tomography, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, because it can achieve detailed imaging of both the pancreatic parenchymal tissue and the ductal anatomy simultaneously with a high-frequency ultrasound examination at a close proximity. <b>Endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> can differentiate benign pseudocysts or benign cystic lesions from malignant neoplasms of the pancreas; the distinction is crucial in the surgical treatment of the patients. The diagnostic accuracy can be further enhanced with endoscopic ultrasonography-guided fine-needle aspiration of the cystic fluid to detect tumour markers and cytological examination. Endoscopic ultrasonography-guided aspiration with or without endoscopic cystogastrostomy or cystoduodenostomy has become the treatment of choice for patients with pancreatic pseudocysts. The procedure is associated with decreased morbidity and mortality when compared with open surgery. Conclusion. <b>Endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> appears to be a useful tool {{in the management of}} cystic lesions of the pancreas. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to prospectively {{evaluate}} <b>endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> and microscopic examination of duodenal bile in the diagnosis of cholecystolithiasis not detected by conventional ultrasonography. Forty five consecutive patients (26 females, 19 males, mean age: 50 years) with suspected cholecystolithiasis and at least two normal transcutaneous ultrasonography examinations were included. Endoscopic ultrasonographic criteria for the diagnosis of cholecystolithiasis were the presence of stones with or without acoustic shadowing or sludge. Criteria of microscopic examination of bile were cholesterol or bilirubinate crystals or spheroliths. Thirty three patients underwent cholecystectomy and lithiasis was found in gall bladder bile in 24. Twelve patients who were not operated on and were followed up (median: 17 months), had no evidence of cholecystolithiasis. <b>Endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> and duodenal bile examination were 96 % and 67 % sensitive, respectively (p < 0. 03). The specificity was not different (86 and 91 %, respectively). None of the 16 patients with negative results in both procedures had evidence of cholecystolithiasis. It was found that for the diagnosis of cholecystolithiasis in patients with normal conventional ultrasonography, the sensitivity of <b>endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> is higher than that of microscopic examination of duodenal bile. If <b>endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> and microscopic examination of duodenal bile are negative, the risk of underdiagnosing cholecystolithiasis is negligible...|$|E
40|$|To {{review the}} results of {{treatment}} of primary biliary stones, 96 consecutive patients managed from 1991 to 1996 were studied retrospectively. Acute cholangitis and abdominal pain were the presenting symptoms in 57 patients (59 %) and 29 patients (30 %), respectively. Fifty-four patients (56 %) {{had a history of}} biliary surgery. <b>Endoscopic</b> retrograde cholangiopancreatography, <b>ultrasonography,</b> and computed tomography were frequently employed for diagnosis of primary biliary stones and were performed on 84 patients (88 %), 90 patients (94 %), and 89 patients (93 %), respectively. Intrahepatic stones were identified in 91 patients (95 %) and biliary strictures in 34 patients (35 %). Concomitant cholangiocarcinoma occurred in 15 patients (16 %). Hepatic resection was required in 55 patients (57 %) for removal of an atrophic liver lobe or a segment related to repeated infection, biliary strictures, liver abscesses, or cholangiocarcinoma. Intraoperative choledochoscopy was routinely performed in all patients to detect, remove, or confirm clearance of biliary stones. A hepaticocutaneous jejunostomy (HCJ) was constructed in 70 patients (73 %) to facilitate postoperative choledochoscopic examination or biliary stone extraction. Twenty-two patients (23 %) had residual stones and required postoperative choledochoscopic extraction. Complete eradication of residual stones was achieved in all patients. Postoperative morbidity occurred in 28 patients (29 %), and there was one hospital death (a patient with cholangiocarcinoma). With a median follow-up of 26 months (range 2 - 62 months), stones recurred in three patients. In conclusion, the early results of treatment of primary biliary stones were satisfactory owing to a systematic, aggressive approach that consisted of hepatic resection, frequent construction of an HCJ, and postoperative choledochoscopy. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
30|$|Esophageal cancer invading the muscularis mucosa {{sometimes}} involves regional {{lymph node}} metastases. However, lymph node metastases are {{rare in the}} dorsal area of the thoracic aorta. We describe a patient with an intramucosal esophageal cancer invading the muscularis mucosa, accompanied by lymph node metastases in the dorsal area of the thoracic aorta. These lesions were successfully resected by hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery using a transhiatal approach. A 60 -year-old man was diagnosed with superficial esophageal cancer during a routine health examination. <b>Endoscopic</b> examination and <b>ultrasonography</b> revealed a superficial cancer, of diameter 6.0  cm, invading the submucosal layer and intramural metastases caudal to the primary tumor. Enhanced computed tomography and F-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography demonstrated the two metastatic lymph nodes, one in the dorsal area of the thoracic aorta and the other near the left gastric artery. Thoracoscopic radical esophagectomy with three-field lymph node dissection was performed. The metastatic lymph node in the dorsal area of the thoracic aorta was successfully removed by hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery using a transhiatal approach. Histopathological examination showed primary cancer invading the muscularis mucosa and intramural metastases in the lamina propria mucosa and submucosal layer. The pathological diagnosis according to the Japanese classification of esophageal cancer was MtLt, 47  mm, 0 -IIa[*]+[*]IIb, pT 1 a-MM, ie(+), INF-b, ly 3, v 0, pN 4 (4 a), pIM 1, M 0, and pstage IVa. The patient underwent two courses of adjuvant chemotherapy, consisting of CDDP and 5 -fluorouracil. At present, 1  year and 8  months after surgery, the patient remains alive without tumor recurrence. Although the lymph node in the dorsal area of the thoracic aorta is not recognized as regional nodes of thoracic esophageal cancer, solitary mediastinal metastases from a mucosal cancer may indicate the existence of direct lymphatic flow from the thoracic esophagus to the retroaortic region. Transhiatal approach by hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery is useful to dissect the metastatic lymph node in the dorsal area of the thoracic aorta.|$|R
