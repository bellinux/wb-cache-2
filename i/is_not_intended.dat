5|$|Though most {{computers}} since mid-2004 can boot from USB {{mass storage}} devices, USB <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>intended</b> {{as a primary}} bus for a computer's internal storage. Buses such as Parallel ATA (PATA or IDE), Serial ATA (SATA), or SCSI fulfill that role in PC class computers. However, USB has one important advantage, {{in that it is}} possible to install and remove devices without rebooting the computer (hot-swapping), making it useful for mobile peripherals, including drives of various kinds (given SATA or SCSI devices may or may not support hot-swapping).|$|E
5|$|The Pizza Burger is {{a burger}} sold {{exclusively}} at the BK Whopper Bar location in Times Square, New York City that {{was introduced in}} September 2010. It consists of four Whopper patties on a 9.5inch sesame bun, sliced into six pieces and topped with pepperoni, mozzarella, basil pesto and marinara sauce. The whole burger contains more than the recommended daily allowance of calories for men at 2,520 calories, with 144grams of fat, 59g of which is saturated, and 3,780mg of sodium, {{more than double the}} recommended daily allowance for adults. However, according to Burger King's Vice President of global marketing, John Schaufelberger, the burger <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>intended</b> to feed just one person. Each slice has 420 calories, 24g fat (10g saturated), and 630mg sodium.|$|E

5|$|Support for {{continued}} use of the name {{has come from the}} team's owners and a majority of fans, which include some Native Americans. Supporters say that the name honors the achievements and virtues of Native Americans, and that it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>intended</b> in a negative manner. Some, such as team president Bruce Allen, also point to the use of Redskins by three high school teams, two on reservations, that have a majority of Native American students. Supporters have asserted that a majority of Native Americans are not offended by the name based upon a national poll by Annenberg Public Policy Center in 2004. In a commentary published soon after that poll, 15 Native American scholars collaborated on a critique that stated that there were so many flaws in the Annenberg study that rather than being a measure of Native American opinion, it was an expression of white privilege and colonialism. Specific criticism of the methodology includes the use of self-reporting to identify Native Americans, which violated the basic principles supporting the validity of public opinion polling. In May 2016, the Washington Post published a poll that duplicated the central question posed in 2004, yielding an identical result.|$|E
