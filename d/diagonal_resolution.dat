50|$|Super CCD is a {{proprietary}} charge-coupled device {{that has been}} developed by Fujifilm since 1999. The Super CCD uses octagonal, rather than rectangular, pixels. This allows a higher horizontal and vertical resolution (at the expense of <b>diagonal</b> <b>resolution)</b> to be achieved than a traditional sensor of an equivalent pixel count.|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} notion of a free {{resolution}}. In general a free resolution can be of any length depending on the group ring under investigation. We consider the metacyclic groups G(pq) which admit periodic resolutions. In such circumstances it is possible to achieve fully diagonalised resolutions. By discussing the representation theory over integral group rings we obtain a complete list of indecomposable modules over Z[G(pq) ]. Such a list aids the decomposition of the augmentation ideal (the first syzygy) into a direct sum of indecomposable modules. Therefore we are able to achieve a diagonalised map here. From this point it is possible to decompose all of the remaining syzygies in terms of indecomposable modules, leaving a <b>diagonal</b> <b>resolution</b> in principle. The existence of these diagonal resolutions significantly simplify a problem in low-dimensional topology, namely the R(2) -D(2) problem. There are two stages to verifying this problem, and we prove the first stage using cohomological properties of the syzygy decompositions. The second stage is realising the Swan map. Although we do not manage to realise it fully, we are able to realise certain terms. Finally this thesis includes an in depth exposition of the R(2) -D(2) for the non-abelian group of order 21. In this case a positive result has been achieved using an explicitly calculated <b>diagonal</b> <b>resolution...</b>|$|E

40|$|Two {{formulations}} of the a posteriori covariance using maximum likelihood are considered. These are then related to model resolution. The first formulation {{is an extension}} of least squares in which the least squares inverse is replaced by the maximum likelihood inverse. For imperfect resolution, this approach gives a maximum error for <b>diagonal</b> <b>resolutions</b> of 0. 5 and decreases for greater or smaller resolutions. The second formulation for the a posteriori covariance due to Tarantola (1987) gives a more natural result which reduces to the least squares result for perfect resolution and to the a priori covariance in the limit of zero resolution. Many computer algorithms use the first formulation which will systematically underestimate computed model errors as compared to the second formulation in all cases except for perfect resolution...|$|R
50|$|In January 2015, Meta {{launched}} a project led by Horizons Ventures, Tim Draper, Alexis Ohanian, BOE Optoelectronics and Garry Tan. On February 17, 2016, Meta announced their second-generation product at TED, Meta 2. The Meta 2 head-mounted display headset uses a sensory array for hand interactions and positional tracking, visual field view of 90 degrees (<b>diagonal),</b> and <b>resolution</b> display of 2560 x 1440 (20 pixels per degree), {{which is considered}} the largest field of view (FOV) currently available.|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} two-alternative forced choice {{experiments}} {{was conducted to}} compare the sharpness of televised moving images sampled using cardinal or diagonal patterns with reference images of varying resolution. The results indicate that both image sampling and resolution orientation {{play an important role}} in determining apparent sharpness of the images. If an image has better cardinal than <b>diagonal</b> <b>resolution,</b> the apparent sharpness is significantly greater. Thus, if the polar distribution of resolution is limited by the sampling process, diagonal sampling can be expected to yield a sharper image than cardinal sampling with the same number of pixels...|$|E

50|$|Currently Toshiba is {{updating}} the Tecra series by upgrading older models or launching new notebooks, such as Tecra A11. Depending {{on the location}} there are currently three notebooks in the Tecra series. Toshiba implemented two latest upgrades in the current Tecra series. The first upgrade regards the operating system. Recent Tecra notebooks are shipped with Windows 7 operating system, while the second upgrade regards the 2010 Intel Core processor Family, which includes faster processors that deliver higher performances with Intel Turbo Boost technology and Intel Hyper Threading technology (available in three performance levels). Toshiba included in the Tecra series features for protection such as PC Health Monitor. Other Tecra laptop features are eSATAp Sleep-and-Charge combo port, and fingerprint reader for a better security. Furthermore, the Tecra series includes notebooks with either 14.1 inches diagonal display or 15.6 high <b>resolution</b> <b>diagonal</b> widescreen. Some current Tecra notebook models have durable texture finish with chrome buttons.|$|R
40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} (3 -D) velocity {{structure of}} the upper crust in {{the central part of}} the Hida region, central Honshu, Japan, has been investigated by simultaneous inversion of travel time data for velocity and hypocentral parameters using Thurber's method (1983). The data used for this purpose were 2, 231 P-wave arrival times from 204 local earthquakes observed at 16 high-sensitivity seismograph stations. The iterative damped least-squares inversion used here provided reliable results with the <b>diagonal</b> elements of <b>resolution</b> matrix well exceeding 0. 90 and standard errors less than 3 % for the central area. The central part of the Hida region covering an extremely low seismicity area has high velocities probably extending down to a mid-crust. The high-velocity area composed of hard metamorphic and granitic complex extends from the western flank of the Hida mountains to the western section of the seismically active Atotsugawa-Ushikubi faults. The axial part of the Hida mountains and its southwestward area, on the other hand, is covered by remarkable low-velocities. The low velocities may be associated with a high thermal state due to active volcanism beneath the mountains involving volcanoes Mts. Tateyama, Yake, Norikura, and Ontake. The southwestern part of the Hida region is also partially covered by low-velocities beneath the Ryohaku mountains, which may also be related to volcanism of Mt. Hakusan. The obtained 3 -D velocity structure appears to be qualitatively consistent with the Bouguer gravity anomalies and also with the large-scale 3 -D structure so far obtained...|$|R
