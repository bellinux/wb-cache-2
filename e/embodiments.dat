The idea of a saint appearing before laity was common in Northern art of the period, and is also represented in van Eyck's Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele (1434–36). There, the Canon is portrayed as if having just momentarily paused to reflect on a passage from his hand-held bible as the Virgin and Child with two saints appear before him, as if <b>embodiments</b> of his prayer.|$|E

This version is based on when Ippo began boxing and was training to fight his rival, Ichiro Miyata. The weaker Takamura has less muscle mass and looks ill.

The Old Man denies the dogs are his, but they retreat regardless. Black then sees that the obelisks all bear an ouroboros, {{the symbol of the}} Millennium Group. He visits the Old Man's home, where the two speak about the Group and its symbolism, and the coming millennium. The Old Man then brings Black to a {{clearing}} full of the wild dogs, where the latter realizes they are <b>embodiments</b> of the evil in the world. He approaches them as stands his ground, being struck by several visions as he does so. The Old Man then explains that the world's balance between good and evil is being lost as the millennium approaches, and that Beebe's home, built on sacred ground, {{is one of the many}} small things upsetting this balance.|$|E

5000|$|One of Gibbs’ main focuses of his {{research}} is on <b>embodiment.</b> His 2006 book <b>Embodiment</b> and Cognitive Science provides {{a large body of}} evidence to support the <b>embodiment</b> premise. This concept of <b>embodiment</b> “refers to understanding the role of an agent’s own body in its everyday, situated cognition". Gibbs promotes a dynamic framework of <b>embodiment</b> that differs from the more traditional reductionist model of cognition. Gibbs says that <b>embodiment</b> refers not only to neural events but also to cognitive unconscious and to phenomenological experience. [...] Gibbs discusses the relationship between body and consciousness from many different viewpoints and talks about the epistemological opposition between realism and idealism.|$|R

Unlike the Semitic religions, e.g., Abrahamic religions, which believe that God created the soul and the world out of ‘nothing,’ Ramanuja believed that creation is an eternally recurring cyclic process and hence God is free from the responsibility of starting it and causing the evils accruing from it. Instead he believed that karma, the result of the actions of Jivas (souls) in previous <b>embodiments,</b> causes the good and evil, enjoyments and sufferings of karma which have to be necessarily to be enjoyed or suffered by the Jivas themselves who are responsible for the fruits.|$|E
25|$|Rabbi Israel ben Eliezer Baal Shem Tov (1698–1760), {{founder of}} Hasidism {{in the area}} of the Ukraine, spread teachings based on Lurianic Kabbalah, but adapted to a {{different}} aim of immediate psychological perception of Divine Omnipresence amidst the mundane. The emotional, ecstatic fervour of early Hasidism developed from previous Nistarim circles of mystical activity, but instead sought communal revival of the common folk by reframing Judaism around the central principle of devekut (mystical cleaving to God) for all. This new approach turned formerly esoteric elite kabbalistic theory into a popular social mysticism movement for the first time, with its own doctrines, classic texts, teachings and customs. From the Baal Shem Tov sprang the wide ongoing schools of Hasidic Judaism, each with different approaches and thought. Hasidism instituted a new concept of Tzadik leadership in Jewish mysticism, where the elite scholars of mystical texts now took on a social role as <b>embodiments</b> and intercessors of Divinity for the masses. With the 19th-century consolidation of the movement, leadership became dynastic.|$|E

After thorough analysis, details of advantageous <b>embodiments</b> are filed in Germany by Guenter Baur et al. and patented in various countries. which is not 0 or 90 degrees, filed Jan 9, 1990. The Fraunhofer Institute in Freiburg, where the inventors worked, assigns these patents to Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, a supplier of LC substances. In 1992, shortly thereafter, engineers at Hitachi work out various practical details of the IPS technology to interconnect the thin-film transistor array as a matrix and to avoid undesirable stray fields in between pixels. Hitachi also improves the viewing angle dependence further by optimizing the shape of the electrodes (Super IPS). NEC and Hitachi become early manufacturers of active-matrix addressed LCDs based on the IPS technology. This is a milestone for implementing large-screen LCDs having acceptable visual performance for flat-panel computer monitors and television screens. In 1996, Samsung developed the optical patterning technique that enables multi-domain LCD. Multi-domain and In Plane Switching subsequently remain the dominant LCD designs through 2006. In 2007 the image quality of LCD televisions surpassed the image quality of cathode-ray-tube-based (CRT) TVs. In the fourth quarter of 2007, LCD televisions surpassed CRT TVs in worldwide sales for the first time. LCD TVs were projected to account 50% of the 200million TVs to be shipped globally in 2006, according to Displaybank. In October 2011, Toshiba announced 2560×1600 pixels on a 6.1-inch (155mm) LCD panel, suitable for use in a tablet computer, especially for Chinese character display.|$|E
