Gravure {{printing}} {{has been}} applied widely in flexible packaging, building materials and other fields, and amount of ink transfer {{is an important factor}} to affect the printing quality and depends largely on the volume of the <b>gravure</b> <b>cell.</b> The volume of cell is affected by gravure process parameters such as screen lines, cell angle and engraving needle angle, so the volume of cell is calculated difficulty, and it is difficulty for the optimization of the gravure plate-making process. This paper presents a computing model calculating the volume of <b>gravure</b> <b>cell.</b> The cells for three kind of dot coverage rate are carved with 70 LPC screening lines and 120 ° needle angle, their opening length, width and depth are measured by cell measuring instrument, their relation is been found by MATLAB and the computing model is built to calculate the cell volume model. The results show that the computing model is suitable for different cell angle, and the cell volume depends the screening rules, cell angle, needle angle and the cell depth. If the depth for different dot coverage rate is measured the cell volume will be calculated...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} discrete cell gravure roll coating using computational and experimental techniques. The gravure film thickness experiments conducted {{are similar to those}} presented in previous studies and show a near linear relationship between pickout ratio and speed ratio. This work adds detailed data of the gravure surface for use in computational modelling. Using a white light interferometer, surface images of the gravure topography were captured. From these images the key cell parameters, opening area, cell depth, cell volume and the cell patterning were characterised. Observations of scratches on the coated web were concluded to be caused by contact between the web and roll. A novel computational model was derived for the discrete cell gravure coating process. The model uses a multiscale approach to address the disparate scales of the coating bead and the <b>gravure</b> <b>cell.</b> This is an extension of earlier work and is extended to a three-dimensional, realistic, topography at the small scale and at the large scale a web-to-roll contact model was added. The key topographical gravure features are included via a detailed cell scale model. The computational model was able to predict the near linear relationship between pickout ratio and speed ratio but failed to accurately predict this gradient. The model was shown to be the most accurate at speed ratios near unity. A parametric investigation of both the coating conditions and the <b>gravure</b> <b>cell</b> geometries identified the contact pressure (the pressure caused by the web acting directly on the gravure surface) as being important to the coating process. Its magnitude was related to the web tension, wrap angle and cell size. This led the interesting result that very small cells display no contact pressure and suggests a direction for future work on the investigation of scratch free coatings. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{variety of}} methods have been devised for the {{measurement}} of the smoothness of paper. These are reviewed and summarized in this work. Of the available methods, {{two of the most}} widely used have been selected for study. The air-leak method exemplified by the Sheffield instrument, and the nip-spreading method of the IGT printability tester are specifically presented and performed. The data obtained in empirical experiments are statistically analyzed and plotted, so as to determine if there is a functional relationship between the responses of these two methods. A linear relationship between the two is shown to be an appropriate model. This paper also indicates the predictability of gravure printing quality on the basis of paper smoothness/roughness. The percentage of missing cells of the gravure prints are shown to be related to both forms of smoothness/roughness measurement. 78 % of the <b>gravure</b> <b>cell</b> skipping data variation as printed by the IGT printability tester is attributable to smoothness/roughness measurement. The remaining amount of variation is associated with error or untested factors. Compressibility and oil absorbency of paper should be further studied and incorporated into similar studies. It is expected that the addition of these variables would improve laboratory prediction of gravure printability as defined by cell skipping...|$|E
40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} {{model for}} predicting the fluid pickout and coated film thickness {{characteristics of a}} discrete <b>cell</b> direct <b>gravure</b> roll coater operating in reverse mode is derived. A novel multiscale approach is adopted for this purpose and the resulting equations solved numerically for inertia-less flow conditions. A system of stiff ordinary differential equations {{is found to be}} sufficient to capture the major gross flow features, while at the cell level the analysis is based on a finite element solution of the momentum and continuity equations. It represents the first such predictive model of its kind, with particular interest placed on the nature of both the pressure distribution and web-to-roll gap profile spanning the coating bead. The effect of key operating parameters, web-to-roll speed ratio, web-tension, wrap-angle, capillary number and cell-geometry, on the degree of fluid pickout from <b>gravure</b> <b>cells</b> and the coated film thickness is explored. Although an idealised model, the trends observed show qualitative agreement with existing experimental data collected on a small-scale gravure coating rig and point the way forward to the eventual formulation of a full three-dimensional predictive model of the process. © 2011...|$|R
40|$|Gravure {{printing}} delivers intricate print {{quality and}} exhibit better feasibility for printing long run packaging jobs. PVC and PETG {{are widely used}} shrink films printed by gravure process. The variation in ink transfer from <b>gravure</b> <b>cells</b> on to the substrate results in print mottle. The variation is inevitable and requires close monitoring with tight control on process parameters to deliver good dot fidelity. The electrostatic assist in gravure improves the ink transfer efficiency but is greatly influenced by ESA parameters such as air gap (distance between charge bar and impression roller) and voltage. Moreover, {{it is imperative to}} study the combined effect of ESA and gravure process parameters such as line screen, viscosity and speed for the minimization of half-tone mottle in shrink films. A general full factorial design was performed for the above mentioned parameters to evaluate half-tone mottle. The significant levels of both the main and interactions were studied by ANOVA approach. The statistical analysis revealed the significance of all the process parameters with viscosity, line screen and voltage being the major contributors in minimization of half-tone mottle. The optimized setting showed reduction in halftone mottle by 33 % and 32 % for PVC and PET-G respectively. The developed regression model was tested that showed more than 95 % predictability. Furthermore, the uniformity of dot was measured by image to non-image area (ratio) distribution. The result showed reduction in halftone mottle with uniform dot distribution...|$|R
40|$|Gravure {{roll coating}} is a {{technique}} used to coat fluids {{of a wide range}} of viscosities (up to 1500 mPa s) onto substrates at speeds of up to 900 m/min (Booth, 1970, 1990). Coat thicknesses in the range of less than 1 micron up to 50 microns can be achieved, making this a versatile process which is finding application across a growing number of market sectors. Gravure roll coating differs from many of the conventional roll coating techniques in that one of the rolls is patterned with a surface engraving (the ‘gravure’ or ‘anilox’ pattern). Both the shape and the size of the gravure pattern can be varied which affects the final properties of the coating. The term ‘gravure roll coating’ covers a number of distinct gravure coating arrangements. Two common variants of these are direct gravure coating and offset gravure coating, see Figure 1. Direct gravure coating is where the fluid transfer takes place directly from the gravure roll to the web, whilst in offset gravure coating, fluid is transferred first from the gravure roll to a smooth deformable roll (often termed the applicator roll), and then from the deformable roll to the web. Whilst both are described as gravure coating processes, the fluid mechanics of these two processes are very different and will be described separately. Gravure ‘coating’ is distinct from gravure ‘printing’ (or roto-gravure), in that gravure coating is designed to give uniform coverage on the substrate whilst gravure printing is designed to print specifi c patterns. The quality of gravure coating can be defi ned in terms of the thickness and variation of the coating, whilst the quality of gravure printing will include quantifi cation of print characteristics such as resolution and edge definition. This article will focus on gravure coating, but many of the emerging markets, for example in the manufacture of electronic products such as solar cells, require both large areas of uniform coating but with good edge definition. This article will first describe the range of <b>gravure</b> <b>cells</b> available and typical manufacturing techniques, together with the important parameters that specify the gravure roller, before describing in more detail the two distinct gravure roll coating processes...|$|R
40|$|A {{heterogeneous}} multiscale {{model for}} discrete <b>cell</b> <b>gravure</b> roll coating is presented along with experimental {{results for the}} purpose of model validation. The cell volume, generalized cell shape, and the gravure patterning are considered in the model which is based on a multiscale description of the flow in the coating bead. The inclusion of a web-to-roll contact term accounts for the special gravure case when the web-roll separation tends to zero. The results show how the coating bead responds to changes in operating conditions. These are presented as profile plots of the fluid properties and coating bead shape...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} a process flow to allow the fabrication of organic field effect transistors with self-aligned source and drain electrodes, and sub-micron channel lengths on flexible plastic substrates. This was achieved using a combination of bilayer nanoimprint lithography, gravure printed or photolithographically patterned dielectric, and bilayer self-aligned lithography. Effective channel lengths over an order of magnitude could be defined from 375 - 3800 nm. Electrode overlaps between gate-drain and gate-source of 100 - 200 nm are demonstrated, yielding very low channel-length normalised overlap capacitances of 0. 1 - 0. 6 fF per ??m. The viability and behaviour of these architectures was investigated using zone-cast, gravure and inkjet printed semiconductors. State-of-the-art transition frequencies in the range 1 - 6 MHz were achieved at operating biases < 30 V. The molecular packing of a zone-cast small molecule p-type semiconductor (TIPS-pentacene) was observed to be influenced by the underlying architecture. Simple techniques were developed to quantify gravure printed film quality. Periodic modulation of printed films was observed to be a function of <b>gravure</b> clich?? <b>cell</b> geometry and ink formulation. Both gravure and inkjet printed p- and n-type semiconductors (DPPT-TT and P(NDI 2 OD-T 2)) were studied. Thin gravure printed dielectrics were observed to systematically increase effective mobilities, at the expense of an increase in leakage current. Complementary self-aligned inverters are presented, with a peak gain of 28 achieved for devices operating below 20 V, along with NAND and NOR logic gates operating up to 20 kHz. The viability of gravure printing an indacenodithiophene-benzothiadiazole (C 16 IDT-BT) on plastic is demonstrated yielding effective mobilities in the range 0. 04 - 0. 4 cm squared per V per s at V(DS) < 20 V, exceeding previous reports for the behaviour of this material in a bottom-gate, bottom-contact configuration.

40|$|Tri-helical, gravure roll coating, {{operated}} in reverse mode, is investigated via a combined experimental, theoretical and computational approach. New experiments {{were conducted on}} a pilot coating rig, designed to simulate the industrial process. Flow visualisations reveal the underlying flow structure within the roll-to-web transfer region and highlight when loss of coating stability (streaking) occurs. The latter {{is found to be}} influenced by the depth of the tri-helical grooves and the capillary number. Experiments show that as the web-to-roll speed ratio is increased, so too is fluid pickout from the grooves, although the coated film thickness may decrease. A key feature of the present investigation is the formulation of a novel complementary mathematical model. By starting with a simplified form of the coating process and progressively adding complexity a set of models are developed, first for simple zero pitch angled rectangular grooves then for grooves of arbitrary shape and groove pitch. A further extension to the model is the inclusion of a non-Newtonian model for the fluid (specifically a shear thinning power law formulation). Analysis of the application of shear thinning fluids to the moving substrate is also conducted. The base model developed is that for rectangular grooves of zero pitch, which takes the form of an analytical solution of the flow equation (a Poisson equation) along a groove. An extension to this model is made by solving the Poisson equation for non-rectangular grooves using the finite element method. Simple meniscus models were applied to make the problem tractable. Agreement between experimental data and predictions from the model is seen to be good for the range of operating conditions considered up to the onset of streaking. A final extension to the model considers grooves at non-zero pitch angles, representative of the industrial coating process. The limitations of this model, when compared to experimental data are examined and a physical explanation is postulated for the breakdown of the model at steep pitch angles. Under conditions of breakdown, the high pressures within the groove are consistent with the idea that elastohydrodynamics is an important mechanism in the transfer of fluid within the coating bead for discrete <b>cell</b> <b>gravure</b> coating.
