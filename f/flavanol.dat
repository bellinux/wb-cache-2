25|$|The {{phenolic}} {{content in}} wine {{refers to the}} phenolic compounds—natural phenol and polyphenols—in wine, which include {{a large group of}} several hundred chemical compounds that affect the taste, color and mouthfeel of wine. These compounds include phenolic acids, stilbenoids, flavonols, dihydroflavonols, anthocyanins, <b>flavanol</b> monomers (catechins) and <b>flavanol</b> polymers (proanthocyanidins). This large group of natural phenols can be broadly separated into two categories, flavonoids and non-flavonoids. Flavonoids include the anthocyanins and tannins which contribute to the color and mouthfeel of the wine. The non-flavonoids include the stilbenoids such as resveratrol and phenolic acids such as benzoic, caffeic and cinnamic acids.|$|E

40|$|Growing {{evidence}} {{has shown that}} ascorbic acid (ASA) can contribute to protein glycation {{and the formation of}} advanced glycation end products (AGEs), especially in the lens. The mechanism by which ascorbic acid can cause protein glycation probably originates from its oxidized form, dehydroascorbic acid (DASA), which is a reactive dicarbonyl species. In the present study, we demonstrated {{for the first time that}} four tea <b>flavanols,</b> (−) -epigallocatechin 3 -O-gallate (EGCG), (−) -epigallocatechin (EGC), (−) -epicatechin 3 -O-gallate (ECG), and (−) -epicatechin (EC), could significantly trap DASA and consequently form 6 C- or 8 C-ascorbyl conjugates. Among these four <b>flavanols,</b> EGCG exerted the strongest trapping efficacy by capturing approximate 80 % of DASA within 60 min. We successfully purified and identified seven 6 C- or 8 C-ascorbyl conjugates of <b>flavanols</b> from the chemical reaction between tea <b>flavanols</b> and DASA under slightly basic conditions. Of which, five ascorbyl conjugates, EGCGDASA- 2, EGCDASA- 2, ECGDASA- 1, ECGDASA- 2 and ECDASA- 1, were recognized as novel compounds. The NMR data showed that positions 6 and 8 of the ring A of <b>flavanols</b> were the major active sites for trapping DASA. We further demonstrated that tea <b>flavanols</b> could effectively inhibit the formation of DASA-induced AGEs via trapping DASA in the bovine lens crystallin-DASA assay. In this assay, 8 C-ascorbyl conjugates of <b>flavanols</b> were detected as the major adducts using LCMS. This study suggests that daily consumption of beverages containing tea <b>flavanols</b> may prevent protein glycation in the lens induced by ascorbic acid and its oxidized products.

40|$|The {{long-term}} harsh {{climate conditions}} in 2015 distorted already from June up to November in all study trees of Tsuga and Taxus the intracellular {{organization of the}} needles. Intimately involved in these repressive processes were the <b>flavanols,</b> a small subgroup of the flavonoids. They were not only deposited in vacuoles of conifer needles {{but also in the}} nuclei and chromosomes. Among the many flavonoids the small group of catechin derivatives and polymers named <b>flavanols</b> can exclusively be stained blue with DMACA (dimethylaminocinnamaldehyde). From mid-July onward, the vacuolar <b>flavanols</b> of the epidermal cell layers were gradually diminished as evidenced by decreasing blue staining of nuclei and vacuoles. Subsequently, in August also the large spongy mesophyll cells showed the <b>flavanols</b> decreasing progressively. Apparently, the antioxidant <b>flavanols</b> operate as oxygen radical scavengers. (ROS) were used up during the harsh environmental stress conditions. Both, Tsuga and Taxus reacted in this way. However, it is quite surprising that in all study trees the palisade cells did not contain such vacuolar <b>flavanols.</b> Only these cells were in June the first to show a loss of chlorophyll from chloroplasts as well as an efflux of <b>flavanols</b> from the nuclei. Conversely, from September onward another group of phenols, the yellow-staining <b>flavanols</b> were newly formed in the palisade cells and later on also in the mesophyll cells. Obviously, they were assembled finally to stabilize finally the fragile cell sites.

40|$|Abstract PURPOSE: <b>Flavanols</b> are an {{important}} fraction of our diet both for their antioxidant capacity {{and because they are}} constituents of greatly accepted foodstuffs such as tea, wine and cocoa. In addition to their antioxidant activity by directly scavenging intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), <b>flavanols</b> have been recently shown to enhance protective enzymes. The objective was to evaluate the antioxidant response of colon-derived Caco 2 cells to dietary <b>flavanols.</b> METHODS: Four representative <b>flavanols</b> were selected: epicatechin (EC), epicatechin- 3 -gallate (ECG), epigallocatechin- 3 -gallate (EGCG) and procyanidin B 2 (PB 2). Cell viability, concentration of ROS and reduced glutathione (GSH), and activity of antioxidant/detoxification enzymes and caspase 3 were determined. RESULTS: Treatment of Caco 2 cells with <b>flavanols</b> decreased ROS production but did not affect GSH content. ECG induced glutathione peroxidase (GPx), whereas PB 2 evoked a dose-dependent increase in GPx, glutathione reductase and glutathione-S-transferase. Enhancement of the antioxidant defences implies an improved cell response to an oxidative challenge. Hence, Caco 2 cells treated 20 h with the <b>flavanols,</b> especially PB 2, and then submitted to an oxidative stress induced by a pro-oxidant, tert-butyl-hydroperoxide, showed a reduced ROS production, restricted activation of caspase 3 and higher viability than cells plainly submitted to the stressor. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Flavanols</b> protect Caco 2 cells against an induced oxidative stress and subsequent cellular death by reducing ROS production and preventing caspase- 3 activation. In particular, PB 2 increases the activity of antioxidant/detoxification enzymes and thus protects Caco 2 cells by directly counteracting free radicals and also by activating the antioxidant defence system.

40|$|Background: Cocoa is {{a product}} of {{processing}} of the cocoa bean. It is rich in <b>flavanols,</b> a subgroup of flavonoids, a common compound in plants. Cocoa <b>flavanols</b> have positive effect on the cardiovascular system. Cognitive effects of these compounds have been investigated, but not proved to be of significance in the past. Methods: An exhaustive search of available literature was conducted using the MEDLINE-Ovid, Google Scholar and CINAHL databases. Keywords searched included cocoa and cognition. Articles that assessed effects of cocoa <b>flavanols</b> on cognition were included. The quality of relevant articles was evaluated using the GRADE Working Group guidelines. Results: This review summarizes the accumulated evidence of research of cognitive effects of cocoa <b>flavanols</b> not covered by Scholey et al and Sokolov et al. Three randomized controlled studies met eligibility criteria and were included in this systematic review. One study of 37 adults found a statistically significant improvement in performance of cognitive tests in patients using cocoa <b>flavanols</b> supplementation. A second study of 90 adults showed acute improvements in performance of fatigability tests. In the third study 37 adults patients showed improvements in activation of dentate gyrus of the hippocampus as well as some memory tests. All studies had low quality of evidence based on the GRADE guidelines. Conclusion: Cocoa-derived <b>flavanols</b> need further investigation to understand their effect on cognition and memory but preliminary results are promising. Keywords: Cocoa and cognition...|$|R

50|$|In model solutions, colorless compounds, such as catechin, {{can give}} rise to new types of pigments.

This {{is followed by the}} formation of xanthylium salt yellowish pigments and their ethylesters, resulting from the dehydration of the colorless dimers, followed by an oxidation process. The loss of a water molecule takes place between two A ring hydroxyl groups of the colorless dimers.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to CO2 process extraction, tea may be also decaffeinated using a hot water treatment. Optimal conditions are met by controlling water temperature, extraction time, and ratio of leaf to water, where higher temperatures at or over 100 °C, moderate extraction time of 3 minutes, and a 1:20 water to leaf {{weight per volume}} ratio removed 83% caffeine content and preserved 95% of total catechins.

50|$|The tree is {{considered}} to be a traditional medicine by the Malian people of Sikasso region, and is used for treatments of various diseases. The Dioïla cercle uses the decoction of leaves against malaria, and wound healing, while the roots are used against dysentery. The extraction of the root bark is attractive to scavengers and some 15 lipoxygenase inhibitors have been found. The attraction is caused by phenolic smell of bergenin and <b>flavanol</b> that the plant releases. It also releases betulinic acid and lupeol from the stem bark. All of those compounds are used as anti-inflammatory, and are protecting plants from protozoan parasites. The plants are also effective against blood platelet aggregation and murine tumors.|$|E
50|$|The {{condensed}} tannins can nevertheless undergo acid-catalyzed cleavage in {{the presence}} of (an excess of) a nucleophile like phloroglucinol (reaction called phloroglucinolysis), benzyl mercaptan (reaction called thiolysis), thioglycolic acid (reaction called thioglycolysis) or cysteamine. These techniques are generally called depolymerisation and give informations such as average degree of polymerisation or percentage of galloylation. These are SN1 reactions, a type of substitution reaction in organic chemistry, involving a carbocation intermediate under strongly acidic conditions in polar protic solvents like methanol. The reaction leads to the formation of free and derived monomers that can be further analyzed. The free monomers correspond to the terminal units of the condensed tannins chains. If thiolysis is done directly on plant material (rather than on purified tannins), it is, however, important to subtract naturally occurring free <b>flavanol</b> monomers from the concentration of terminal units that are released during depolymerisation.|$|E
