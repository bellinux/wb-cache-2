40|$|Conventional {{rotary engine}} designs {{are based on}} an epitrochoidal <b>housing</b> <b>bore</b> that is found by {{the path of the}} point at the rotor profile's apex. To seal the engine, the rotor apexes are {{replaced}} by spring-loaded apex seals that slide along the <b>housing</b> <b>bore</b> during rotation. The conventional designs are limited to the point-based epitrochoid housing profiles and cannot incorporate the profile of the apex seal. This dissertation presents the complete theory and algorithm of the deviation function (DF) method of rotary engine design. This method is based on conjugate pair design and generates new engine profiles from generating curves. The DF method of rotary engine design by apex seal profile is introduced and developed for generating new profile designs in which the housing profile conforms to the apex seal profile, for better sealing. The DF method of design by geometric parameters is developed to select profiles using the standard rotary engine geometry. Maximum theoretical compression ratio and swept area are two criteria that have a range of possible DF-designed profile solutions. For the apex seal design and selection process, a sealing index is defined and a multi-apex-sealing grid is developed to further improve apex sealing. The DF method of rotary engine design is extended to noncircular pitch curves, for generating more new profiles that incorporate a variable speed ratio between the rotor and main shaft. By using the DF method, a larger variety of engine profiles is available to meet multiple design criteria and allow more flexibility in the design process. Some example deviation functions are provided for process illustration and design development. Engine profile designs and methods using circular pitch curves are developed using both arc-based and nonarc-based apex seal profiles. Engine profile designs with noncircular pitch curves are developed using the arc-based seal profile...|$|E
40|$|A flexure-ring is {{provided}} for centering a lens in a bore of a housing with 3 N lens contacting stubs, where N is an integer {{equal to or}} greater than one. The stubs are formed by increasing the inside diameter of the ring made to fit tightly around a lens except at 3 N locations for the aforesaid stubs, and said ring having an outside diameter made to fit tightly inside the <b>housing</b> <b>bore</b> locations. Behind each stub, a segment of the ring is removed down to a chord perpendicular to a ring diameter passing through the center of each stub. That chord is selected to have a length greater than the lens contacting surface of the stub, thereby to produce a reduced cross section of the ring {{on both sides of the}} stub to serve as flexures in relieving stresses due to different coefficients of thermal expansion of the three parts involved due to changes in temperature while in use...|$|E

40|$|The {{standards}} and methods concerning assignment of rolling bearing fit with shafts and frames via example of bearing 6 - 208 are analyzed. We set certain differences of recommendations according to GOST 3325 - 85, "Rolling bearings. Tolerance zones and technical requirements to mounting surfaces of shafts and frames. Attachment" and by reference of rolling bearing manufacturers. The following factors {{should be taken}} into consideration when assigning the mounting with the tension the internal ring of the bearing with shaft and mounting with a gap in the outer ring with a <b>housing</b> <b>bore.</b> The methods of achieving accuracy of mounting surfaces of shafts and frames via form tolerance assignment: roundness tolerance, profile of longitudinal cut, cross section, cylindricity and others. It is possible to limit the bearing rings in different ways, for example appointing the cylindrical mounting surfaces and bead end surfaces the appropriate tolerances, namely: coaxiality tolerance or full radial beat of mounting surfaces, and also perpendicularity tolerance, butt beats and full butt beats of mounting end surfaces. We suggest to expand methods of achieving the accuracy of shafts and frames depending on seriation of production and production operations metrology support. ...|$|E
40|$|An Induction motor {{reliability}} survey at an egg {{processing plant}} shows that almost 50 % {{of the total}} motor failures are fan induction motors. Visual investigations of the faulty fan motors show that {{the main cause of}} the induction motor failure is air gap eccentricity. In this study, experimental tests are performed on a 1. 1 kW three-phase induction motor to detect air gap eccentricity and overheating of the induction motor. Heating tests show that end shield housing temperature reaches 100 °C with blocked air flow from the fan, which can reduce the lifespan of the bearing. Dimension measurements of the end shield housing show that the dimensions of both tested motors back-end shields are larger than ISO tolerance grade limit. It leads to a loose fit between the housing and bearing, causing air gap eccentricity. Also, both motor back end shield housing has an out-of-round condition leading to an unbalanced magnetic pull. To detect the air gap eccentricity caused by too loose of a fit between <b>housing</b> <b>bore</b> and bearing, current Park’s vector approach is used. To measure three phase current, Hall Effect current transducers, a digital oscilloscope is used and Matlab software to process the measurement data. Results show that Park’s vector approach can be used to detect the air gap eccentricity caused by too loose a fit between bearing and housing. Therefore, the Park’s vector approach can be used to diagnose air gap eccentricity and analyse the type of the air gap eccentricity...|$|E
