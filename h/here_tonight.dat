25|$|Jack Johnson, {{the heavyweight}} champion, and Battling Jim Johnson, another colored pugilist, of Galveston, Texas, {{met in a}} 10-round contest <b>here</b> <b>tonight,</b> which ended in a draw. The spectators loudly protested {{throughout}} that the men were not fighting, and demanded their money back. Many of them left the hall. The organizers of the fight explained the fiasco by asserting that Jack Johnson's left arm was broken in the third round. There is no confirmation of a report that Jack Johnson had been stabbed and no evidence at the ringside of such an accident. During the first three rounds he was obviously playing with his opponent. After that {{it was observed that}} he was only using his right hand. When the fight was over he complained that his arm had been injured. Doctors who made an examination, certified to a slight fracture of the radius of the left arm. The general opinion is that his arm was injured in a wrestling match early in the week, and that a blow tonight caused the fracture of the bone.|$|E

At {{the time of his}} death, Scott was in a {{relationship}} with Kristin Spodobalski. During his Jimmy V Award speech, he told his teenage daughters: [...] "Taelor and Sydni, I love you guys more than I {{will ever be able to}} express. You two are my heartbeat. I am standing on this stage <b>here</b> <b>tonight</b> because of you." ...|$|E
500|$|Diepenbrock {{has said}} that many people assume Lin is not a {{basketball}} player because he is Asian. The first time Lin went to a Pro-Am game in Kezar Pavilion in San Francisco, a security guard told him: [...] "Sorry, sir, there's no volleyball <b>here</b> <b>tonight.</b> It's basketball." [...] Early in his stint with the Knicks, a security guard at Madison Square Garden stopped Lin from entering the players' entrance, mistaking him as a trainer. After signing with the Hornets, the five-year NBA veteran had to convince security at Charlotte's Time Warner Cable Arena {{that he was a}} player.|$|E

500|$|Michigan's sixth {{opponent}} was the Lehigh Mountain Hawks. The {{game was}} played at the Detroit Athletic Club field in Detroit and ended in a sixth straight shutout by a one-sided score of 44–0. Michigan's scoring came on seven touchdowns and five goals after touchown (all five kicked by halfback Ferbert). During the 60 minutes of play, the ball was in Lehigh's possession [...] "not more than ten minutes," [...] and most of {{that was in the}} first half. One newspaper account stated that [...] "the Eastern boys were outclassed from start to finish." [...] The same report gave the following account of the game:"The team play of the University of Michigan was excellent and the interference as good as has ever been seen in this city. The star of the game was probably Ferbert, though the plays of Villa, Farnham, Henninger, and Caley were at times brilliant. ... The University of Michigan is celebrating the victory <b>here</b> <b>tonight,</b> and pointing proudly {{to the fact that the}} best Pennsylvania [...] could do against Lehigh was 32 to 0." ...|$|E
500|$|Andrew Orloff, the Creative Director and Visual Effects Supervisor of Zoic Studios, {{considered}} the creature {{one of the}} most challenging effects his company helped make for the season. He explained that this and other designed monsters are [...] "really super fantastical, they’re really out there, the anatomy and the biology of them is so wild and crazy, that it really takes a lot to make it look real in the scene and make it a part of the actors are reacting to these things – to get the audience to believe in it is kind of the biggest challenge we’ve faced on the show so far." [...] During filming, the cast and crew referred to the monster as a [...] "were-upine" [...] or [...] "porcuman". Lance Reddick commented on set, [...] "When I first got <b>here</b> <b>tonight,</b> I was expecting zombies to come up out of the ground. And the actual creature looks so bizarre, I mean it really looks like something I wouldn't want to be caught in the woods with." [...] The crew spent over a week collecting and placing the plane wreckage together. According to Set Dresser Russ Griffin, the set included approximately 15,000 pounds worth of plane parts.|$|E
500|$|Eminem {{performed}} [...] "Not Afraid" [...] alongside Porter at the 2011 Bonnaroo Music Festival.

Almost 80,000 {{members of the audience}} chanted [...] "Shady!" [...] for five minutes until Eminem returned to perform an encore with [...] "Lose Yourself". Before performing [...] "Not Afraid", Eminem told the audience, [...] "All jokes aside... Thank you for sticking by me and not giving up on me." [...] At one point during the show, he told them, [...] "Everybody <b>here</b> <b>tonight,</b> I just wanna say thank you for sticking by me and not giving up on me." [...] News sources praised the performance; James Montgomery of MTV News wrote, [...] "what stood out the most about Em's performance was the sheer tenacity with which he attacked it." [...] News agency Associated Press said that [...] "Bonnaroo's crowd may be a hippie enclave, but you wouldn't have known it Saturday night". HitFix blog's Katie Hasty considered the [...] "Not Afraid" [...] performance [...] "triumphant, perhaps due to crowd buzz". Patrick Doyle of Rolling Stone wrote, [...] "Eminem's hour-and-a-half set was a triumph, with the rapper constantly bouncing across the stage, performing hit after hit with the energy of a prizefighter." ...|$|E

You love to get that qualifying spot on Sunday, but we really earned it tonight, to start on the front row, which is even better. It was definitely a great way to start the season." ...|$|R

2500|$|Kinnock {{appeared}} at a Labour Party rally alongside Scargill in Stoke-on-Trent on 30 November 1984 - {{the day of}} the killing of David Wilkie. [...] His speech developed into an argument with hecklers who saw him as having betrayed the NUM by failing to support the strike. Kinnock began by saying, [...] "We meet <b>here</b> <b>tonight</b> in the shadow of an outrage." [...] When interrupted, Kinnock accused the hecklers of [...] "living like parasites off the struggle of the miners." [...] As Kinnock denounced the lack of the ballot, violence against strikebreakers and Scargill's tactical approach, he was asked by hecklers what he had done for the striking miners. [...] Kinnock shouted back, [...] "Well, I was not telling them lies. [...] That's what I was not doing during that period." [...] It was a thinly-veiled attack on Scargill, whom he later admitted that he detested.|$|E
2500|$|Though NBC {{had made}} a {{considerable}} effort to scrub any references to O'Brien's brief tenure as The Tonight Show host following the controversy both on-air and online, with one former blogger for NBC Sports noting a corporate policy banning any mention of O'Brien, it was acknowledged by the network during the buildup to the 2014 transition from Leno to Fallon. A moving image of O'Brien walking onto his Tonight set was displayed (for less than one second) in an on-air promo chronicling the franchise's history, and Fallon referenced the conflict on his first Tonight Show episode, {{when he opened the}} show by joking: “I'm Jimmy Fallon, and I'll be your host—for now. (pause for laughter) Of course, I wouldn't be <b>here</b> <b>tonight</b> if it weren't for the previous Tonight Show hosts, so I want to say thank you to Steve Allen, Jack Paar, Johnny Carson, Jay Leno, Conan O'Brien and Jay Leno.” ...|$|E
2500|$|With the {{publication}} of his eighth novel White Noise in 1985, DeLillo began a rapid ascendancy to being a noted and respected novelist. White Noise was arguably a major breakthrough both commercially and artistically for DeLillo, earning him a National Book Award for Fiction and a place among the academic canon of contemporary postmodern novelists. DeLillo remained as detached as ever from his growing reputation: when called upon to give an acceptance speech for the Award, he simply said, [...] "I'm sorry I couldn't be <b>here</b> <b>tonight,</b> but I thank you all for coming," [...] and then sat down. The influence and impact of White Noise {{can be seen in the}} writing of such authors as David Foster Wallace, Jonathan Lethem, Jonathan Franzen, Dave Eggers, Martin Amis, Zadie Smith and Richard Powers (who provides an introduction to the 25th anniversary edition of the novel). Among the 39 proposed titles for the novel were [...] "All Souls", [...] "Ultrasonic", [...] "The American Book of the Dead", [...] "Psychic Data" [...] and [...] "Mein Kampf"; however, DeLillo acknowledged in a 2005 interview that White Noise was a fine choice, remarking [...] "Once a title is affixed to a book, it becomes as indelible as a sentence or a paragraph." ...|$|E

2500|$|The League of Women Voters had {{announced}} {{a schedule of}} debates similar to 1976, three presidential and one vice presidential. No one had {{much of a problem}} with this until it was announced that Rep. John Anderson might be invited to participate along with Carter and Reagan. Carter steadfastly refused to participate with Anderson included, and Reagan refused to debate without him. It took months of negotiations for the League of Women Voters to finally put it together. It was held on September 21, 1980 in the Baltimore Convention Center. Reagan said of Carter's refusal to debate: [...] "He [...] knows that he couldn't win a debate even if it were held in the Rose Garden before an audience of Administration officials with the questions being asked by Jody Powell." [...] The League of Women Voters promised the Reagan campaign that the debate stage would feature an empty chair to represent the missing president. Carter was very upset about the planned chair stunt, and at the last minute convinced the League to take it out. The debate was moderated by Bill Moyers. Anderson, who many thought would handily dispatch the former Governor, managed only a draw, according to many in the media at that time. The Illinois congressman, who had been as high as 20% in some polls, and {{at the time of the}} debate was over 10%, dropped to about 5% soon after. Anderson failed to substantively engage Reagan, instead he started off by criticizing Carter: [...] "Governor Reagan is not responsible for what has happened over the last four years, nor am I. The man who should be <b>here</b> <b>tonight</b> to respond to those charges chose not to attend," [...] to which Reagan added: [...] "It's a shame now that there are only two of us here debating, because the two that are here are in more agreement than disagreement." [...] In one moment in the debate, Reagan commented on a rumor that Anderson had invited Senator Ted Kennedy to be his running mate by asking the candidate directly, [...] "John, would you really prefer Teddy Kennedy to me?" ...|$|E
