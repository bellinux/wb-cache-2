The High Roller explains that he and Babydoll are supposed to [...] "screw", but {{that he has no}} intention of simply taking her. Instead, he is looking for a moment of truth in a fake world, which can only be provided by someone who is not a faker, which is why he needs Babydoll - <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> see in her eyes a simple truth: that she would give herself to him willingly, not because she has to, but because she wants to. At first, Babydoll seems reluctant as the High Roller becomes more intimate, but soon starts warming up to him. The High Roller explains that in exchange for this one moment of truth, he will give her absolute freedom, as an abstract ideal. Babydoll willingly pulls him close to her, and they kiss. At this moment, Babydoll's fantasy ends, and she is thrust back into the real world just as the surgeon's needle enters her eye.|$|E

6000|$|Nor was {{the young}} {{engineer}} discussed in a lighter vein. [...] "It pains me dreadfully to see that young man working with the common laborers and giving himself no rest, just because <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> know exactly 'how the thing is done' and why the old works failed," [...] she remarked sadly. [...] "When Mr. Windibrook knew {{he was the son}} of Judge Masterton and had rich relations, he wished, of course, to be civil, but somehow young Masterton and he didn't 'hit off.' Indeed, Mr. Windibrook was told that he had declared that the prosperity of Canada City was only a mushroom growth, and it seems too shocking to repeat, dear, but they say he said that the new church--OUR church--was simply using the Almighty as a big bluff to the other towns. Of course, Mr. Windibrook couldn't see him after that. Why, he even said your father ought to send you to school somewhere, and not let you grow up in this half civilized place." ...|$|E

It's in his blood, he says, and he longs for it. But he told me {{something}} that made me glad for him, poor fellow. Before he sailed on the Four Sisters he was engaged to a girl at home. He did not tell me anything about her in Montreal, because he said he supposed she would have forgotten him and married someone else long ago, and with him, you see, his engagement and love was still a thing of the present. It was pretty hard on him, but when he got home he found she had never married and still cared for him. They are to be married this fall.

Simply because I believe him when <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> marry me, and make me his {{companion}} for life. And then there's an affinity between us which God certainly manages. Why should I trust him in every detail of life with a perfect faith, and not trust Mr. Mahomet M. Moss to the extent of half-a-crown? If he were to ask me for everything I have in the world, I should give it to him, without a thought except of his goodness in taking care of it for me. I wouldn't let Mahomet M. Moss have a dollar of mine without giving me his bond. Papa, there will be a row between me and Mr. Mahomet M. Moss, and so it's well to put you on your guard." ...|$|E

50|$|Aguinaldo, in {{the book}} A Second Look at America, which he co-authored with Vicente Albano Pacis but later disauthorized, claims that his {{withdrawal}} of the commutation order did not mean immediate implementation of the death verdict. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> {{a little more time}} for a cooling-off period so that eventually the Bonifacio brothers would be forgiven and pardoned.
