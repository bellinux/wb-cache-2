5|$|The 193738 {{season was}} purely domestic, with no {{international}} matches, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> for all players {{to push for}} selection in the squad for the 1938 Ashes tour. It was another disappointing season for Queensland, who were again winless; they lost three matches, hung on for a draw, eight wickets down in another, {{and the other two}} fixtures were washed out before the second innings. Tallon scored 204 runs at 22.66 without managing a half-century and made 17 dismissals.|$|E
5|$|On 11 November 1100 Henry married Matilda, the {{daughter}} of Malcolm III of Scotland. Henry was now around 31 years old, but late marriages for noblemen were not unusual in the 11th century. The pair had probably first met earlier the previous decade, possibly being introduced through Bishop Osmund of Salisbury. Historian Warren Hollister argues that Henry and Matilda were emotionally close, but their union was also certainly politically motivated. Matilda had originally been named Edith, an Anglo-Saxon name, {{and was a member}} of the West Saxon royal family, being the niece of Edgar the Ætheling, the great-granddaughter of Edmund Ironside and a descendant of Alfred the Great. For Henry, marrying Matilda gave his reign increased legitimacy, and for Matilda, an ambitious woman, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> for high status and power in England.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Earl of Pembroke {{had been}} {{negotiating}} with France {{to resolve the}} long-standing disagreements over the administration of Gascony, {{and as part of}} this Edward and Isabella agreed to travel to Paris in June 1313 to meet with Philip IV. Edward probably hoped both to resolve the problems in the south of France and to win Philip's support in the dispute with the barons; for Philip <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> to impress his son-in-law with his power and wealth. It proved a spectacular visit, including a grand ceremony in which the two kings knighted Philip's sons and 200 other men in Notre Dame, large banquets along the River Seine, and a public declaration that both kings and their queens would join a crusade to the Levant. Philip gave lenient terms for settling the problems in Gascony, and the event was spoiled only by a serious fire in Edward's quarters.|$|E

25|$|When the {{original}} {{leader of the}} Fourth Crusade, Count Theobald III of Champagne, died in 1201, Boniface was chosen as its new leader. He was an experienced soldier, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> to reassert his dynasty's reputation after defeat at home. Boniface's family was {{well known in the}} east: his nephew Baldwin and brother Conrad had been Kings of Jerusalem, and his niece Maria was heiress of the kingdom.|$|E
25|$|The Spanish throne {{had been}} vacant since the {{revolution}} of September 1868, and the Spanish offered the throne to the German prince Leopold of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, a Catholic {{as well as}} a distant cousin of King Wilhelm of Prussia. Leopold and Wilhelm I were both uninterested, but the wily Bismarck was acutely interested, as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> to once again best Napoleon III. Bismarck persuaded Leopold's father to accept the offer for his nation, and it was accepted instead by Leopold himself in June 1870.|$|E
25|$|This was {{followed}} by a match against the Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's, which fielded a virtual England Test team. Seven of the MCC's representatives went on to play in the First Test, while three others had already had Test experience, including former national captain Freddie Brown, so <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> to gain a psychological advantage in what amounted to a rehearsal for the Ashes. The first day's play was entire washed out by rain, leaving a bowler-friendly surface when the match started on the following morning. Miller bowled seven wicketless overs, conceding only ten runs, before Doug Ring took over and claimed five wickets as the MCC were dismissed for 80. Miller was then bowled by Trevor Bailey for a duck as the tourists slumped to 4/26 before recovering to take a 99-run first innings lead. In the second innings, Miller took the wickets of English Test opening batsmen, Reg Simpson and David Sheppard, trapping his victims leg before wicket and bowled respectively, to leave the hosts at 2/15 just before stumps on the second day. He later removed Fred Brown and Godfrey Evans in the middle-order, to end with 4/47, as the MCC made 196. The last two wickets came from deliberately unconventional balls, a full toss and a round arm delivery that were designed to surprise his opponents. This left Australia with a target of 98 for victory, but they had only reached 2/13 when time ran out. Miller was not required to bat.|$|E

500|$|In 1108, Henry betrothed his eight-year-old daughter, Matilda, to Henry V, {{the future}} Holy Roman Emperor. For King Henry, {{this was a}} prestigious match; for Henry V, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> to restore his {{financial}} situation and fund an expedition to Italy, as he received a dowry of £6,666 from England and Normandy.

500|$|Despite the controversy, and {{negative}} reception of Chad's sexual encounters with Vincent, Divins identified Chad's confusion over his sexual orientation {{as a vital}} part of the storyline. While the show was still filming, he expressed an interest in further exploring Chad's rejection of his sexuality. Divins felt that the key element of the storyline was Chad's difficulty in coming to terms with his sexuality. When asked by an interviewer about the revelation of Chad's sexuality, Divins said the show would include clear representations of [...] "male intimacy". Divins said he was uncomfortable shooting scenes related to the storyline, but felt <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> to sharpen his skills as an actor. He added that he wanted to make the character as [...] "grounded and real as possible" [...] and keep the focus on how Chad reconciles with his sexual orientation.|$|E
500|$|Albert Brooks {{plays the}} foul-mouthed, morose Bernie Rose. When Refn {{suggested}} him, Gosling agreed, but thought the actor {{would not be}} up for playing a character who is violent and sullen, or for appearing in a film {{that he did not}} work on himself. Brooks accepted the role to go against type, and because he loved that Bernie was not a cliché. [...] "There are six people you could always get to play this kind of part, and I like that the director was thinking outside of the box.

500|$|Fogel {{commented on}} Gaga's lack of {{experience}} in a tour and said that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> for her. [...] "As an artist {{with that kind of}} talent and vision emerges, it creates a lot of excitement, and ticket sales worldwide demonstrate that people are really excited to see the show. Over {{the course of the next}} many months we're trying to play to as many people in as many places as possible", Fogel added. [...] "It's an across the board home run." [...] Demands increased and another additional six dates were added to the announced itinerary. The Monster Ball sold out shows in Toronto, Vancouver and San Jose who were compelled to add second dates in each city. In Los Angeles, to ensure that concert goers had the best possible access to tickets, a second performance was announced prior to the onsale of the first shows, and both Staples Center concerts were completely sold out. Billboard estimated that by the time the tour wraps up in 2011, it would have grossed close to US$200million worldwide.|$|E
500|$|Stenhammar's {{efforts were}} rewarded with the European premiere of The Oceanides. For Sibelius, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> {{to once again}} be an [...] "artist on tour", feeding off the energy and [...] "rapturous ovations" [...] of an {{audience}} (it had been nine months since the Norfolk concerts, which now seemed a distant memory). The first concert, on March 22, featured the Second Symphony, Scènes historiques II, and two movements from Swanwhite before concluding with The Oceanides. According to Sibelius's diary, the performance was a [...] "great success", with Stenhammar [...] "captivated" [...] particularly by the final number. The 24March program retained The Oceanides, but paired it with Scènes historiques I, the Nocturne from the King Christian II Suite, a movement from , [...] Return, and the Fourth Symphony. Sibelius was {{very pleased with the}} orchestra's handling of The Oceanides, calling its performance [...] "wonderful". He goes on to note in his diary that, [...] "After the final number [...] there was a deafening torrent of applause, stamps, cries of bravo, a standing ovation and fanfares from the orchestra".|$|E
500|$|Another {{incentive}} for the show was to get more people to use the Internet. Sathe stated that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> for younger people to bring the older members of their families onto the internet, and Yorke hoped that it would bring people onto the internet who had not used it before. Simon Nelson, BBC Vision controller of multiplatform and portfolio, {{said that this was}} an opportunity for the BBC to develop its expertise in drama production by exploiting the creative potential of the Internet to create a new online drama where few have succeeded. EastEnders: E20 primarily operates as a standalone series but also cross-references storylines of the main soap. According to Santer, the series also explores the stories of the soap's anonymous bystanders. He said, [...] "There are always other people [...] milling round the market and houses that we never go into. There are four or five parallels you could do. It will be nice to see well-known characters through strangers' eyes. Ian Beale may show up and he is just a strange, irritating man. Or they might ask: 'Who is that moody girl in the market?' And it will be Stacey Slater." ...|$|E

500|$|Another {{question}} that arose was whether Lody's trial {{should be held}} in public or in camera. Captain Reginald Drake, [...] head of counter-espionage, wanted Lody to be tried secretly {{so that he could}} implement [...] "an ingenious method for conveying false information to the enemy which depended on their not knowing which of their agents had been caught." [...] He was overruled, as the British Government believed that it would be more advantageous to publicise the threat of German spies to remove any doubt in the public mind that German espionage posed a serious threat in the UK. It was hoped that this would also generate support for the intelligence and censorship apparatus that was rapidly taking shape and would deter possible imitators. In the event, Lody's was the only spy trial in either World War held in public in the UK. In pursuing this policy the Government sacrificed the chance to [...] "turn" [...] captured spies and turn them into assets for the British intelligence services. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> that was taken in the Second World War when the highly successful Double-Cross System was implemented.|$|E
500|$|Just Cause 2 was {{developed}} by the Swedish Avalanche Studios, with Square Enix London Studios providing additional support. The game's predecessor, Just Cause, was a moderate commercial success and received mixed reviews from critics. The team thought that although it had potential, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> missed and described Just Cause 2 as a [...] "sequel waiting to be made". Shortly after the start of development, the team begin analyzing the first game's strengths and weaknesses with the intention of improving it. They wanted to use the large open world to create rewarding quests and missions, dropping the first game's side missions in favor of faction missions, stronghold takeovers and race challenges to increase gameplay density (keeping players occupied, even when simply exploring the world). This density increased the connectivity between the faction and Agency missions. Another goal was to improve the game's combat and artificial intelligence, so action stunts would be easier to perform and the game's tactical element would increase. The team overhauled the artificial intelligence, improving enemy characters' reaction to player action and their environment. The game [...] features a Hybrid Locking System, which make aiming easier, and a real-time destruction system. The team refined the game's driving mechanics to make them feel more realistic.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Mr. Eko {{was created to}} explore the spiritual element of the show, and to add an African character, which the producers thought would provide [...] "cultural variety" [...] to the cast. Lost creators Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse's first choice for the actor to portray Eko was Lance Reddick, after they had seen him as Cedric Daniels on HBO's The Wire. However, after it was made clear Reddick was unavailable due to the filming schedule of The Wire, Cuse and Lindelof decided to contact Akinnuoye-Agbaje, because they were big fans of {{his work on the}} HBO prison drama Oz. At the time, Akinnuoye-Agbaje was filming Get Rich or Die Tryin' and, being unfamiliar with Lost, had no intention of joining the cast. While the producers succeeded in persuading Akinnuoye-Agbaje to take the role, {{he did not want to}} make a long-term commitment to the show and was therefore only hired for a short period of time. Akinnuoye-Agbaje accepted the part mostly because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> to play a character with a different faith than his Buddhism, and because he enjoyed the idea of being on a deserted island (he had lived on a deserted island four years prior to being cast on the show). Two weeks after he was hired, Akinnuoye-Agbaje moved to Oahu, Hawaii, where filming took place.|$|E

The event was cosponsored by the Barnes Review, a journal that endorses Holocaust denial. In the wake of criticism for his appearance, Gravel has said repeatedly {{that he does not}} share such a view, stating, [...] "You better believe I know that six million Jews were killed. I've been to the Holocaust Museum. I've seen the footage of General Eisenhower touring one of the camps. They're [...] nutty as loons if they don't think it happened". The newspaper had intended to interview Gravel about the National Initiative. Gravel later recounted the background to the event:"He [...] liked the idea of the National Initiative. I figured <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> to discuss it. Whether it is the far right, far left, whatever, I'll make my pitch to them. They gave me a free subscription to American Free Press. They still send it to me today. I flip through it sometimes.

500|$|Dexters writing staff began {{meeting in}} March 2008 to {{brainstorm}} {{ideas for the}} third season's storylines. Writer Clyde Phillips said that, when the writers decided to open season 3 with the revelation of Rita's pregnancy, [...] "we were thinking about how it would affect Dexter psychologically and emotionally to create a life when he {{has spent most of}} his adult life taking lives." [...] They chose to introduce Miguel as a new character with the intention for his and Dexter's relationship to be [...] "the central arc of the season", according to Hall. Smits was the only actor who was considered for the role of Miguel. Smits was not initially interested in joining the cast, but after Phillips explained Miguel's dark side to him, Smits accepted the job offer because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> to play a character dissimilar to any he had played before. He said, [...] "They promised upfront that this was really going to challenge me, that it would be stuff that I haven't done before, and they've really given me a shot. They've delivered the goods." [...] In regard to Dexter's abandonment of Harry's Code, Hall said that [...] "That need to rebel is a real engine for what unfolds this season." [...] Smits was hired to appear in ten of the season's twelve episodes. When asked at the beginning of the second season whether there was any possibility of Dexter killing an innocent person, show runner Daniel Cerone said that by not doing so, they were [...] "protecting the character". He thought that it was [...] "very important for the show that he does kill people who deserve it". Phillips said that [...] "We don't want him knowingly killing somebody who doesn't deserve it out of impulse or something, but we have explored the notion of his having killed someone without properly vetting that person and perhaps making a mistake." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1973, George Lucas wrote The Adventures of Indiana Smith. Like Star Wars, {{which he}} also wrote, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> {{to create a}} modern version of the film serials of the 1930s and 1940s. Lucas {{discussed}} the concept with Philip Kaufman, {{who worked with him}} for several weeks and came up with the Ark of the Covenant as the plot device. Kaufman was told about the Ark by his dentist when he was a child. The project stalled when Clint Eastwood hired Kaufman to direct The Outlaw Josey Wales. Lucas shelved the idea, deciding to concentrate on his outer space adventure that would become Star Wars. In late May 1977, Lucas was in Hawaii, trying to escape the enormous success of Star Wars. Friend and colleague Steven Spielberg was also there, on vacation from work on Close Encounters of the Third Kind. While building a sand castle at the Mauna Kea Beach Hotel, Spielberg expressed an interest in directing a James Bond film. Lucas convinced his friend Spielberg that he had conceived a character [...] "better than James Bond" [...] and explained the concept of Raiders of the Lost Ark. Spielberg loved it, calling it [...] "a James Bond film without the hardware", although he told Lucas that the surname 'Smith' was not right for the character. Lucas replied, [...] "OK. What about 'Jones'?" [...] Indiana was the name of Lucas' Alaskan Malamute, whose habit of riding in the passenger seat as Lucas drove was also the inspiration for Star Wars' Chewbacca. Spielberg was at first reluctant to sign on, as Lucas had told him that he would want Spielberg for an entire trilogy, and Spielberg did not want to work on two more scripts. [...] Lucas told him, however, that he already had the next two movies written, so Spielberg agreed. [...] But when the time came for the first sequel, it was revealed that Lucas had nothing written for either sequel.|$|E
