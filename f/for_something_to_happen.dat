500|$|On August 30, Smith {{commanded}} one of {{the most}} complete Confederate victories of the war against an inexperienced Union force at the Battle of Richmond. Bragg also won a decisive victory at the September 13 Battle of Munfordville, but the delay there cost him the larger prize of Louisville, which Don Carlos Buell moved to occupy on September 25. Having lost Louisville, Bragg spread his troops into defensive postures in the central Kentucky cities of Bardstown, Shelbyville and Danville and waited <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen,</b> a move that historian Kenneth W. Noe called a [...] "stupendously illogical decision." ...|$|E

"The sun hadn't {{gone down}} yet, and kids were just hanging out, waiting <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b> Van pulls up, {{a bunch of}} guys come out with a table, crates of records. They unscrew the base of the light pole, take their equipment, attach it to that, get the {{electricity}} – Boom! We got a concert right here in the schoolyard and it's this guy Kool Herc. And he's just standing with the turntable, and the guys were studying his hands. There are people dancing, but there's as many people standing, just watching what he's doing. That was my first introduction to in-the-street, hip hop DJing." ...|$|E
500|$|Fiyero is {{confused}} about what he has just seen and what he is doing, but he is caught up in Elphaba's passion. She begins {{to fall in love}} with him and they share a moment before he has to leave to free the lion cub. Elphaba reminds herself that it's pointless to wish <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> between them ("I'm Not that Girl"). Madame Morrible comes and tells her that the Wizard has asked to meet her. Nessarose and Galinda come to see her off, and Fiyero meets her too. Galinda tries to win his respect by changing her name to [...] "Glinda", in solidarity with Dr. Dillamond. But Fiyero barely notices, saying goodbye to Elphaba. It is suggested that her feelings for him are mutual. Elphaba invites Glinda to the Emerald City with her ("One Short Day").|$|E

500|$|Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post {{wrote that}} [...] "The Brothers Grimm looks terrific, yet it remains {{essentially}} inert. You keep waiting <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen,</b> {{and after a}} while your mind wanders from the hollow frenzy up there with all its filigrees and fretwork." [...] Mick LaSalle from the San Francisco Chronicle felt [...] "despite an appealing actor in each role, the entire cast comes across as repellent. Will and Jake Grimm are two guys in the woods, surrounded by computerized animals, putting audiences to sleep all over America." [...] Peter Travers, writing in Rolling Stone magazine, largely enjoyed The Brothers Grimm. He explained that [...] "if you're a Gilliam junkie, as I am, you go with it, even when the script loses its shaky hold on coherence." [...] Travers added, [...] "even when Gilliam flies off the rails, his images stick with you." [...] Gene Seymour of Newsday called the film [...] "a great compound of rip-snorting Gothic fantasy and Python-esque dark comedy".|$|E
2500|$|The Court first convened on February 2, 1790 {{with six}} judges where {{only five of}} its six initial {{positions}} were filled. According to historian Fergus Bordewich, in its first session: [...] "he Supreme Court convened {{for the first time}} at the Royal Exchange Building on Broad Street, a few steps from Federal Hall. Symbolically, the moment was pregnant with promise for the republic, this birth of a new national institution whose future power, admittedly, still existed only in the eyes and minds of just a few visionary Americans. Impressively bewigged and swathed in their robes of office, Chief Justice John Jay and three associate justices — William Cushing of Massachusetts, James Wilson of Pennsylvania, and John Blair of Virginia — sat augustly before a throng of spectators and waited <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b> Nothing did. They had no cases to consider. After a week of inactivity, they adjourned until September, and everyone went home." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shakespeare's Sonnet 57, {{shows that}} [...] "his {{love for the}} fair youth is seen as pure and even heavenly…" [...] but in other sonnets he {{introduces}} new characters, one in particular the Dark Lady, [...] "his association with the dark lady leads to infection and madness of love". [...] He also uses a terminology about his love and how beautiful it appears, but when this love is being directed {{to a young man}} this might appear out of the norm at this time. In the line [...] "Whilst I, my sovereign, watch the clock for you" [...] the word [...] "sovereign" [...] implies that the youth is held at a higher degree and [...] "watch the clock for you" [...] implies that he will wait <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> because of the youth's age or because he is waiting for the youth to recognise his love. [...] The line [...] "nor dare I question with my jealous thought" [...] implies that he has considered that jealously will raise doubts in his head and might drive his love to madness. [...] That this could end up driving the poet to insanity is suggested in this line, [...] "but, like a sad slave, stay and think of nought." [...] The Speaker is referring to himself as the slave again and is diminishing himself by implying no one would love so low and asking the fair youth to clear his mind of all thoughts of him. [...] Although he is comparing himself to a slave, the poet's love has never once subsided. [...] The last two lines saying [...] "so true a fool is love, that in your will, though you do anything, he thinks no ill." [...] The word [...] "will" [...] could be seen as desire or possibly used as a pun on his name, Will. [...] Since he thinks no ill, he is admitting that his love for the youth has made him a fool: [...] "Ultimately Shakespeare provides space for the homoerotic but must eventually return to the perpetuating systems of heterosexual love". This critique states that Shakespeare's sonnets must seen as a continuation of love sonnets that play with different ideas of love. Love could imply economic interest or patronage. Another way of viewing the poet's intent could be a sexual or erotic attraction (as the critic Rudd emphasises) or a brotherly or platonic affection.|$|E
60|$|Miss Dimchurch {{turned and}} {{bestowed}} a terrible glance upon Henry, who, with his forgotten pipe in his hand, looked uneasily {{up to see}} whether he could push past her. Miss Harcourt, holding her breath, gazed at the destroyer of pirates, and waited confidently <b>for</b> <b>something</b> extraordinary <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Dialogue {{should not}} be {{confused}} with discussion or debate, both of which, says Bohm, suggest working towards a goal or reaching a decision, rather than simply exploring and learning.

5000|$|Despite the sport's {{popularity}} with fans, Rowling grew to dislike describing the matches. She commented in an interview: To {{be honest with}} you, Quidditch matches have been the bane {{of my life in}} the Harry Potter books.

60|$|That was {{all they}} knew. They had searched in vain for three days for Ervic. As their island was under water and they could not get back to it, the three Skeezers {{had no place to}} go, and so had waited patiently beside their boat <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b>|$|E

60|$|Waiting in {{the dark}} <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> is always a trying experience, {{especially}} if, as on this occasion, silence is essential.

50|$|The {{story is}} set right after Christmas, as Alfons {{and his father}} are bored because Christmas is over. Alfons' friend Viktor is sick, and can't play with Alfons.

Suddenly, Viktor approaches. He's no longer sick, and can play with Alfons again.

50|$|Colette's {{feelings}} for Antoine are at first ambiguous and, harbouring some {{hope that she}} might grow to return them, he leaves his apartment at the Place Clichy and moves into an apartment {{across the road from}} her family's. Although she continues to treat him kindly, it slowly becomes apparent that she is not interested in him romantically. He sulks about this and at first refuses to see her, but he is lured back by a dinner invitation. It is clear that her family still consider him a surrogate son and are possibly hoping <b>for</b> <b>something</b> romantic <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> between the two teenagers.|$|R
60|$|She longed <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b> It {{might be}} terrible, {{so long as}} it was wonderful. This day, when Lucy had stolen away on a {{forbidden}} horse, she was eighteen years old. The thought of her mother, who had died long ago on their way into this wilderness, was the one drop of sadness in her joy. Lucy loved everybody at Bostil's Ford and everybody loved her. She loved all the horses except her father's favorite racer, that perverse devil of a horse, the great Sage King.|$|E

5000|$|The title [...] "Old Hippie" [...] {{refers to}} the unnamed title character, an aging hippie who uses marijuana, listens to the Woodstock-influenced rock music of the late 1960s and for years refuses {{to let go of}} his lifestyle, despite {{societal}} changes around him. It is also explained that, sometime prior to Woodstock, he was drafted to Vietnam and forced to [...] "become a man while he was still a boy." [...] Afterward, he began waiting <b>for</b> <b>something</b> good <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> in his life, before adopting his way of life. Eventually, the man does change, taking up such interests as jogging while staying away from parties and nightclubs.|$|R
50|$|Admiral Hipper {{was awarded}} an Iron Cross {{but refused to}} wear it, feeling little had been accomplished. Although the results were not spectacular, German commanders were heartened by {{the ease with which}} Hipper had arrived and {{departed}} and were encouraged to try again. The lack of reaction from the British had been due partly to news that morning of a much more serious loss at the Battle of Coronel and because Admiral John Jellicoe, commander of the Grand Fleet, was on a train returning to his ships {{at the time of the}} raid. According to Winston Churchill, the First Lord of the Admiralty, the British could not believe there was nothing more to the raid than briefly shelling Yarmouth and were waiting <b>for</b> <b>something</b> else <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{context in}} which I am forming these {{reflections}} has {{had a significant impact}} on their nature. I have just attended another excellent International Conference on Technology Education Research which is held every two years in Queensland, Australia. After the conference I travelled south along the Australian coast to New South Wales for a beach holiday of swimming and fishing. While standing on the beach, fishing rod in hand waiting <b>for</b> <b>something</b> exciting <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> at the other end of the line, I unfortunately had too many idle hours to ponder. Some of this pondering included the similarities between fishing and school assessment. At the risk of extending an analogy to its limits, I would like to share some of these ideas...|$|R
60|$|She {{glanced back}} at Dennin, but her eyes {{returned}} to the tilted plate. It was so ridiculous! She felt a hysterical impulse to laugh. Then she noticed the silence, and forgot the plate in a desire <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b> The monotonous drip of the coffee from the table to the floor merely emphasized the silence. Why did not Hans do something? say something? She {{looked at him and}} was about to speak, when she discovered that her tongue refused its wonted duty. There was a peculiar ache in her throat, and her mouth was dry and furry. She could only look at Hans, who, in turn, looked at her.|$|E
60|$|When I {{reached the}} junipers, the crows--half {{a hundred of}} them--were ranged in the pine tops along one edge of the open. They were quiet enough, save for an {{occasional}} scramble for position, evidently waiting <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b> Down on my right, on the fourth or open side of the pasture, a solitary old crow was perched {{in the top of}} a tall hickory. I might have taken him for a sentry but for a bright object which he held in his beak. It was too far to make out what the object was; but whenever he turned his head it flashed in the sunlight like a bit of glass.|$|E
60|$|Waiting in {{the dark}} <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> is always a trying experience, {{especially}} if, as on this occasion, silence is essential.

5000|$|Robert Pardi in TV Guide {{gave the}} film {{one out of}} four stars, calling it [...] "a standard-issue rustic {{splatter}} film". Pardi notes that the screenwriters [...] "waste a lot of time developing Danny's back story" [...] and director Steven R. Monroe [...] "piles on the gore"—the result is [...] "repetitive, silly {{and more than a little}} gross". In his review for Best Horror Movies, DeWayne H. Strickland found actress Cervina Vincent [...] "totally hot and extremely voluptuous", but found the film itself disappointing as a horror film. Strickland writes, [...] "You will wait and wait <b>for</b> <b>something</b> horrific <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b> Then there will be some eye-candy, then you will twiddle your thumbs, mumble a 'ho-hum' and then a good scene happens. The good scenes are like seeing a pretty girl at a librarian convention, few and far between." ...|$|R
5000|$|The song {{received}} mostly {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. Kerry L.

[...] Tony Peregrin of PopMatters called it one of the album's imperfections, [...] "where Cher’s voice has been manipulated to such an extent she sounds like the embodiment of a haunted extra-terrestrial, whatever that is." ...|$|R
6000|$|Some of {{them were}} the vicarages of slum parishes. The old sailor had got hold of one cheap, and de Barral got hold of his daughter--which was a good bargain for him. The old sailor was very good to the young couple and very fond of their little girl. Mrs de Barral was an equable, unassuming woman, at that time. With a fund of simple gaiety, and with no ambitions; but, woman-like, she longed for change and <b>for</b> <b>something</b> {{interesting}} <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> now and then. It was she who encouraged de Barral to accept the offer of a post in the west-end branch of a great bank. It appears he shrank from such a great adventure for a long time. At last his wife's arguments prevailed. Later on she used to say: [...] "It's {{the only time he}} ever listened to me; and I wonder now if it hadn't been better for me to die before I ever made him go into that bank." ...|$|R
