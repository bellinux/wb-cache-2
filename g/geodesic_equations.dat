The Einstein field equations—which determine the geometry of spacetime {{in the presence of}} matter—contain the Ricci tensor, and so calculating the Christoffel symbols is essential. Once the geometry is determined, the paths of particles and light beams are calculated by solving the <b>geodesic</b> <b>equations</b> in which the Christoffel symbols explicitly appear.|$|E
