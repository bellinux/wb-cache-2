40|$|In many river basins, {{upstream}} {{development and}} interannual variations in rainfall can cause both episodic and chronic shortages in water supplies downstream. Continued rapid development of surface and groundwater throughout the Krishna Basin in southern India resulted in historically low inflows {{to the main}} canals of the Nagarjuna Sagar irrigation project (8, 955 km 2) during a recent drought (2002 - 2004). This paper presents an integrated approach to assess how cropping patterns and the spatial equity of canal flow changed with water supply shocks in the left canal command area (3, 592 km 2) of Nagarjuna Sagar. We combined 3 years (2000 - 2003) of canal release data with census statistics and high temporal resolution (8 - 10 days) moderate resolution imaging spectrometer (MODIS) 500 -m resolution satellite imagery. The impact of water scarcity on land use pattern, delineated by MODIS images with moderate spatial resolution, was comparable with the census statistics, while the MODIS data also identified areas with changes and delays in the rice crop area, which is critical in assessing the impact of canal operations. A 60 % reduction in water availability during the drought resulted in 40 % land being fallowed in the left-bank canal command area. The results suggest that <b>head</b> <b>reach</b> areas receiving high supply rates during a normal year experienced the highest risks of fluctuations in water supply and cropped area during a water short year compared to downstream areas, which had chronically low water supply, and better adaptive responses by farmers. Contrary to expectations, the spatial distribution of canal flows among the three major zones of the command area was more equitable during low-flow years due to decreased flow at the <b>head</b> <b>reach</b> of the canal and relatively smaller decreases in tail-end areas. The findings suggested that equitable allocations could be achieved by improving the water distribution efficiency of the canal network during normal years and by crop diversification and introduction of alternative water sources during water shortage years. The study identified areas susceptible to decreases in water supplies by using modern techniques, which can help in decision-making processes for equitable water allocation and distribution and in developing strategies to mitigate the effects of water supply shocks on cropping patterns and rural livelihoods...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} to find a strategy to provide year-round irrigation for cultivating three crops {{per year in the}} southern plains of the country taking a case study of the Babai basin. Despite having enough flows during the summer for growing rice in total 27, 000 ha area, the dry season flows of the Babai river can irrigate only 6, 300 ha in winter and 4, 000 ha in spring limiting the cropping intensity to 138. 50 %. It is proposed to irrigate the 7, 500 ha southern dry area at the right bank bringing water from a large snow-fed river: the Karnali. Water balance study of the three irrigation regions to be irrigated from the Babai source preserving their existing water rights showed that the year-round irrigation at the west with the proposed arrangement will fall short of only 13. 9 million m 3 water volume. At the east side, the <b>head</b> <b>reach</b> area and the tail portion will fall short of 19. 4 and 66. 4 million m 3 of water to insure a cropping intensity of 250 %. The deficits can be fulfilled by means of capturing the excess river water of rainy season in local reservoirs and by making conjunctive use of groundwater. The proposed solution is financially, environmentally and socially viable being a cost effective, user friendly and should be the linchpin towards attaining a sustainable year-round irrigation in the region...|$|E

40|$|In the {{ascending}} auditory pathway, {{the context}} in which a particular stimulus occurs can influence the character of the responses that encode it. Here we demonstrate that the cortical representation of a binaural cue to sound source location is profoundly context-dependent: spike rates elicited by a 0 ° interaural phase disparity (IPD) were very different when preceded by 90 ° versus � 90 ° IPD. The changes in firing rate associated with equivalent stimuli occurring in different contexts are comparable to changes in discharge rate that establish cortical tuning to the cue itself. Single-unit responses to trapezoidally modulated IPD stimuli were recorded in the auditory cortices of awake rhesus monkeys. Each trapezoidal stimulus consisted of linear modulations of IPD between two steady-state IPDs differing by 90 °. The stimulus set was constructed so that identical IPDs and sweeps through identical Sounds originating from locations to the left or right of the <b>head</b> <b>reach</b> the ears at slightly different times, resulting in interaural phase disparity (IPD) cues to their localization in the horizontal plane. Motion of sound sources relative to the head, produced by motion of either the listener or the source, results in dynamic variations in IPD. Although relative head motion also impacts other cues for sound localization, such as interaural intensity differences and monaural spectral cues, human psychophysical studies suggest that IPD cues dominate sound localization judgments for broadband sounds when low frequencies are present (Wightman and Kistler, 1992). Numerous studies suggest that cortical neurons in a range of mammalian species, including monkeys, are sensitive to auditory motion (Sovijärvi and Hyvärinen...|$|E

ABSTRACT: Bhavani basin is the fourth largest Sub Basin in the Cauvery basin. The entire command area of all three major canals that takes off from the Bhavani river falls within the Erode District i. e. Lower Bhavani Project (LBP), Kodiveri and Kalingarayan canals. The LBP canal is {{a major source of}} irrigation in Erode District. Many of these canals are unlined and leakage takes place from them. Thus the seepage from the canal helps in recharging the wells in the area, enabling to get adequate water supply for the crops when water was not released from Bhavanisagar Dam. In this study, the Groundwater recharge is determined by groundwater flow modeling using Visual MODFLOW model. For this purpose, three major natural sources of groundwater recharge are taken into consideration such as rainfall infiltration, canal seepage and return flow of irrigation. The model was run and ZONEBUDGET gives an idea about the amount of recharge from lined/unlined canal to the field. Unlined canal helps to recharge the groundwater about 20 % more than the lined canal. The analysis reveals that the annual rainfall also has rapidly changed in this region. In the LBP canal <b>Head</b> <b>reach</b> meets their requirement with available quantity of water from the canal system. Tail end reach does not receive the required quantity of water because of seepage loss and conveyance loss. Hence the lined canal can be provided for full length of the main canal. Branch canals and minor distributaries are suggested to maintain the canals with unlined canal system...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to understand the}} role of institutions and governance, in explaining unequal access to canal water under different rules of the game. Two states {{at different levels of}} agricultural productivity with different rules of distribution of canal water are chosen to study the problem at project level. While Bihar, at low level of agricultural productivity, represents absence of scientific method of distribution of water, Punjab offers high level of agricultural productivity with the warabandi system. The two case studies offer interesting similarities and dissimilarities in terms of unequal access to water by the tail enders and mechanisms needed to mitigate this inequality. Some similarities are: (a) the tail enders suffer the most with low access to water forcing them to adopt only low water intensive crops in comparison to the <b>head</b> <b>reach</b> and mid reach farmers; and (b) the farmers supplement canal water with ground water. The dissimilarities noticed are: (a) while over exploitation of ground water in Punjab has reached levels beyond natural recharge of aquifers in several places; in Bihar, with low withdrawal of ground water and natural endowment of high water table, such a situation has not arisen; (b) the breaking of canal and water courses for own benefit by the powerful with political clout is rampant in Bihar, rarely attracting a penalty from the irrigation department; (c) the water market for tubewell water (Rs. 70 to 80 per hour) has developed in Bihar partly mitigating inequality in access to canal water by the tail enders; no such phenomenon is common in Punjab. The plausible reason for the low density of tubewells in Bihar in contrast to Punjab is low incomes making affordability of tubewell an issue, and (d) cooperative efforts by farmers to lay down pipes through neighbors’ plots to minimize loss of water has succeeded in Punjab; in Bihar such efforts succeeded initially at a small scale but could not sustain without government assistance. The absence of scientific rule for distribution of canal water and the weak canal governance system aggravates the misery of tail enders. In such a scenario, the mitigation of unequal access to water by the tail enders is facilitated by the development of water markets at high cost in a complex situation with tiny holdings and lack of cooperation among the farmers.

40|$|Agricultural {{production}} needs to provide food and fiber for the burgeoning global population {{which is expected}} to touch 9. 25 billion mark by 2050 from the current 7 billion. Agriculture accounts for about 84 % of total water use in Asia, 72 % worldwide, and 87 % in developing countries. The need for improving irrigation management has been figuring high in most of the under developed countries in Asia and Pacific region since beginning of 21 st century. The total actual renewable water resources decreased from 2, 961 m 3 per capita in 2000 to 1, 030 m 3 per capita in 2013 which puts Pakistan in the category of red zone countries. This realization has shifted the attention of the researchers and policy makers to focus on improving the performance of the irrigation systems. To achieve equity in distribution of canal water, new techniques for managing irrigation water resources and for better performance of the irrigation system is required to be given priority under water stress and constraints environment. The simulation models provide information about actual state of the flow anywhere in the canal at any time and are appropriate tools. One dimensional hydrodynamic model, Simulation of Irrigation Canal, SIC is applied for the research study to simulate the hydraulic and operational conditions of Lower Bari Doab Canal (LBDC) for better management and operation. The model was set up using observed cross sectional survey canal data of 2008 - 2010. The observed data of water levels, gate openings and out flows, for August 20 - 27, 2010 was used for calibration of the model. The steady state calibration of the hydraulic model compiles all canal reaches and structures for the actual conditions. The calibration of the model showed close agreement between observed and simulated water levels. As a whole, simulated and actual water levels represented a good calibration of the hydraulic model. The calibration results indicated that the computed water levels were within range of 20 - 35 cm than the observed water levels. After calibration, the model was validated using observed field data of six irrigation periods during 2006 to 2011, (May 10 - 17, 2006; August 24 - 31, 2007 November 8 - 15, 2008; October 07 - 14, 2009; February 20 - 27, 2010 & July 7 - 14, 2011). The results indicated that the computed water levels were within range of 17 - 32 cm than the observed water levels. It showed that the modelcomputed water levels were in close agreement with the observed values for head, middle and tail reaches of the canal. The three statistical approaches i. e., Coefficient of Efficiency -E (Nash-Sutcliff coefficient), coefficient of determination -R 2 and the Studentâ€™s t- test were adopted for evaluation of model performance. The analysis indicated that the model perfromance is resaonably accepatable. Numerical Simulation of Lower Bari Doab Canal (LBDC) canal was performed to compute water levels for 100 % to 40 % of design discharge with and without gate operations. The results showed that without gate operations, at 80 % of design discharge at head, the cross regulators need to be operated to feed 25 % offtakes to their design discharges. Therefore, gate operation is required at 80 % of design discharge. The simulated discharges of offtakes for 100 %, 80 % and 60 % of design discharge at LBDC head indicated that the reduction in the discharges for tail portion offtakes is remarkably more than the offtakes at the head and middle portion when the discharge {{at the head of the}} main canal is reduced from 100 % to 60 %. This indicated that the reduction in discharge from 100 % to 60 % at the head of a main canal, adversely affects the equity conditions along the main canal. The percent reduction varied from 3 - 20 % from <b>head</b> <b>reach</b> to 25 % to 42 % in the tail portion. Based on results of this study, it is recommended to adopt normal range of operation as 80 % for distribution operation instead of 70 %. This study suggests new â€œCombined Efficiency Performance (CEP) â€� parameter as better representative of performance indicator to check the overall hydraulic and operational performance of canal. This indicator helps canal mangers to evaluate the operational plans. When the value of Combined Efficiency Performance (CEP) is between 0. 8 to 1, the canal performance is â€œGoodâ€� and is graded as value equal to 1. When CEP is between 0. 8 to 0. 4, the performance is â€œSatisfactoryâ€�, the canal is graded equal to value 0. 5, while when CEP is less than 0. 4 and greater than 1, the canal performance is â€œPoorâ€� and is graded as value equal to 0. The actual water delivery schedule for period June 15 to July 8, 2011 (Kharif season) was tested and results were compared with optimized plan for performance assessment in terms of equitable distribution of canal water. These indicators are: (a) Delivery Performance Ratio (DPR); (c) Reliability (Pd). (c) Equity (Pe) in water distribution; (d) combined efficiency performance (CEP). The simulations made with ID hydrodynamic SIC Model for LBDC provide information on canal behavior and help canal mangers to optimize operational plan for implementation. Additional modules are developed to better integrate SIC model as Support Tool in the Decision making process of the canal managers. Thus before implementing a new operational procedure in the field, the canal managers can evaluate its likely consequences on the system. The proposed distribution plan with head discharge of 220 m 3 /s of Lower Bari Doab Canal (LBDC) was simulated. The results concluded that the average daily delivery performance ratio (DPR) for actual plan (Kharif 2011) is 0. 94 while for optimized plan; the average DPR value is 0. 97 showing improvement by 4 % on average for optimized plan. The reliability (Pd) of irrigation supply indicated that for actual plan, the Pd value is 0. 048, while for proposed plan, it is 0. 056 indicated improvement by 16. 6 %. The equity (Pe) in terms of water distribution along LBDC main canal concluded that the equity slope for optimized plan is 0. 02 as compared to 0. 077 of actual plan. The Pe for actual plan is 0. 9 while for optimized plan it is 0. 97 indicating 8 % improvement. The evaluation of combined efficiency performance (CEP) of offtakes concluded that for actual plan, the number of offtakes graded as â€œGoodâ€� are 31 while for the proposed plan, the number of offtakes graded as â€œGoodâ€� are 46. The analysis indicated that CEP value for Optimized plan is 0. 82 while for actual plan, CEP value is 0. 77, showing 13 % improvement. In Pakistan, computer oriented research to study hydraulic behavior of large complex network using canal simulation hydraulic models is less common and not constantly implemented. This research study uses hydrodynamic model for simulations of main canal under different operating conditions. The canal managers can optimize the operational plans and implement their decisions in more efficient way than the current practices. The findings of this research serves as a decision support tool for the canal irrigation system managers to formulate effective and responsive control operation strategies under varying flow scenarios...|$|E
