25|$|By law all {{urban areas}} in Colombia are {{classified}} {{in one of}} six socio-economic strata, which are {{used to determine the}} level of tariffs for electricity, water and other services. According to that system, consumers living in areas considered as poor - and consumers using low amounts of electricity - receive electricity and natural gas at subsidized tariffs. These cross-subsidies are almost entirely (approximately 98 percent) financed by consumers living in areas considered as being relatively affluent and who use more electricity. The cross-subsidies cover about 25 percent of the electricity and gas bill of low-income consumers. A special fund that covers the remaining amount not covered by consumers provided US$21.8 million in 2005. On average, 7.5 million people a month benefited from this fund. In addition, the <b>fund</b> <b>provided</b> subsidies of COP$ 17,159 million (US$7.4 million) to 1,808,061 natural gas users.|$|E
