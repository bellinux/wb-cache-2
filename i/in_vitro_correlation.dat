To {{investigate}} the <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>in</b> vivo <b>correlation</b> of a sustained release formulation for {{human growth hormone}} (hGH) based on hydroxyethyl methacrylated dextran (dex-HEMA) microspheres in Pit- 1 deficient Snell dwarf mice and in healthy human volunteers. Materials and Methods. A hGH-loaded microsphere formulation was developed and tested in Snell dwarf mice (pharmacodynamic study) and in healthy human volunteers (pharmacokinetic study). Results. Single subcutaneous administration of the microspheres in mice resulted in a good correlation between hGH released <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> and <b>in</b> vivo effects for the hGH-loaded microsphere formulation similar to daily injected hGH indicating a retained bioactivity. Testing the microspheres in healthy volunteers showed an increase (over 7 – 8 days) in hGH serum concentrations (peak concentrations: 1 – 2. 5 ng/ml). A good <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>in</b> vivo <b>correlation</b> was obtained between the measured and calculated (from <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> release data) hGH serum concentrations. Moreover, an increased serum concentration of biomarkers (insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), IGF binding protein- 3 (IGFBP- 3) was found again indicating that bioactive hGH {{was released from the}} microspheres.

40|$|BACKGROUND: CC {{chemokine}} ligand (CCL) 5 and its receptor CCR 5 {{contribute to}} leukocyte migration into lungs {{of patients with}} diffuse lung diseases (DLD). Pharmacological regulation of CCL 5 and CCR 5 expression was therefore explored in bronchoalveolar cells obtained from patients with DLD. Methods: Cells from 21 patients were co-cultivated in vitro with tumour necrosis factor-a and dexamethasone, cyclosporin A (CyA) or pentoxifylline. Chemokine mRNA expression and protein production was assessed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. Results: Dexamethasone altered CCL 5 mRNA expression and suppressed its protein levels. CyA inhibited chemokine mRNA expression but not protein production. Pentoxifylline did not affected chemokine expression. Both dexamethasone and CyA suppressed CCR 5 mRNA transcripts. Conclusion: In conclusion, while dexamethasone downregulates the CCL 5 functional form, CyA and pentoxifylline have no effects on CCL 5 protein.

The marketed sustained release tablet (Vastarel MR) used as reference, a sustained-release matrix tablet was prepared using hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) as matrix by wet granulation and the <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> dissolution profiles of the self-made tablets were determined in four different dissolution media (0. 1 [*]M HCl, pH[*] 4. 5 PBS, pH[*] 6. 8 PBS and water). A higher similarity between prepared tablets and Vastarel MR was established, with similarity factor (f 2) ranging from 60 to 75 in the four media. The in vivo pharmacokinetics was studied in six healthy beagles. Compared with Vastarel MR, the Cmax of self-made tablets was slightly decreased, while the Tmax and MRT 0 –t were slightly prolonged, but with no significant difference (P[*]>[*] 0. 05). The average of relative bioavailability (F) was 102. 52 % based on AUC 0 –t.

A number of different, but potentially complementary, techniques are under evaluation. The objective of this work was to evaluate in vitro skin penetration and stratum corneum tape-stripping in vivo as tools with which to measure topical diclofenac bioavailability from three approved and commercialized products (two gels and one solution). Drug uptake into, and its subsequent clearance from, the stratum corneum of human volunteers was used to estimate the input rate of diclofenac into the viable skin layers. This flux was compared to that measured across excised porcine skin in conventional diffusion cells. Both techniques clearly demonstrated (a) the superiority in terms of drug delivery from the solution, and (b) that the two gels performed similarly.

We investigated the feasibility and reliability of the technique to assess hemodynamic information both in vitro and in vivo in the carotid arteries and in the venous sinuses. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Real-time interactive duplex MR measurements (TR/TE, 53 / 27; flip angle, 90 degrees; encoding velocity, 100 or 150 cm/sec) were performed in vitro with a steady-flow phantom and in 10 healthy volunteers in whom common and internal carotid artery velocities were measured. In eight volunteers, velocity measurements were also performed in the superior sagittal sinus during both normal breathing and hyperventilation. Time-velocity plots were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively and compared with findings from conventional segmented k-space phase-contrast MR imaging and Doppler sonography. RESULTS: Velocity determinations for real-time duplex MR and conventional phase-contrast MR imaging showed an <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>correlation</b> of 0. 99 and an in vivo correlation of 0. 83 (carotid arteries) and 0. 76 (venous sinus).

It is a liaison (preferentially linear) between a suitable pharmacokinetic parameter (peak plasma drug conc. i. e. Cmax, time for peak plasma drug conc. i. e. tmax and Area under the Curve i. e. AUC) and in vitro characteristics. Need: During optimization modifications in formulation composition, manufacturing method, required equipments or even in batch size.

We tested whether conventional pulmonary artery catheters (PACs) {{can be used to}} measure regional venous blood flows by inverse thermodilution (ITD). Inverse thermodilution was tested in vitro and in vivo using perivascular ultrasound Doppler (USD) flow probes as a reference. In anesthetized pigs, PACs were inserted in jugular, hepatic, renal, and femoral veins, and their measurements were compared with simultaneous USD flow measurements from carotid, hepatic, renal, and femoral arteries and from portal vein. Fluid boluses were injected through the PAC's distal port, and temperature changes were recorded from the proximally located thermistor. Injectates of 2 and 5 mL at 22 degrees C and 4 degrees C were used. Flows were altered by using a roller pump (in vitro), and infusion of dobutamine and induction of cardiac tamponade, respectively. In vitro: At blood flows between 400 mL. min- 1 and 700 mL. min- 1 (n = 50), ITD and USD correlated well (r = 0. 86, P < 0. 0001), with bias and limits of agreement of 3 +/- 101 mL. min- 1.

Although the overall essential agreement was 88. 6 %, it ranged from 96. 4 to 100 % for 6 of the 11 species or groups of yeasts tested. The overall categorical agreement was 93. 2 %, and it was above 90 % for eight species. However, unacceptable percentages of very major errors (false susceptibility) were observed for Candida albicans (2. 7 %), C. glabrata (4. 1 %), C. tropicalis (9. 7 %), and other less common yeast species (9. 8 %). Since it is essential to identify potentially resistant isolates and breakpoints are based on 48 -h MICs, it appears that the 24 -h MIC is not as clinically useful as the 48 -h reference MIC. However, further characterization of these falsely susceptible MICs for three of the four common Candida spp. is needed to understand whether these errors are due to trailing misinterpretation or if the 48 -h incubation is required to detect voriconazole resistance. Either in vivo versus <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>correlations</b> or the determination of resistance mechanisms should be investigated...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} {{antibody}} to co-operate with certain non-immune lymphoid {{cells in the}} rejection of tumours has been studied both <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> and <b>in</b> vivo. Anti-serum raised in rabbits against a PVGc rat leukosis can be rendered “tumour specific” by in vivo absorption in normal PVGc rats and this antiserum can be shown to have lymphocyte dependent antibody (LDA) activity against the tumour cell <b>in</b> <b>vitro.</b> Complement lytic activity of the antiserum is weak or absent against the tumour. Passive administration of the antiserum to rats protects the animals against the development of leukaemia. Maximum protection occurs if the anti-serum is given before the tumour inoculum and is less effective given after the tumour inoculum. No protective effect can be demonstrated with “tumour specific” allo-antisera or syngeneic antisera against the tumour and no <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> LDA activity can be detected against the tumour <b>in</b> <b>vitro.</b> Good <b>correlation</b> exists between LDA activity in the sera of the recipients and the in vivo protective effect...|$|R
40|$|A 4 -day tumour {{sensitivity}} assay {{of potential}} use in predicting tumour response to cytotoxic drugs {{has been investigated}} in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. The method comprised isolation of white cells from peripheral blood, drug exposure and incubation for 4 days. Drug-induced tumour cell kill was assessed by differential staining of dead and live cells such that the latter could be morphologically identified, with subsequent calculation of tumour cell viability. Concentrations of drug {{for use in the}} assay were chosen for chlorambucil (2 micrograms ml- 1), 4 -hydroperoxy-cyclophosphamide (2 micrograms ml- 1) [...] which was used <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>in</b> place of cyclophosphamide [...] prednisolone (0. 5 microgram ml- 1) and vincristine (0. 1 microgram ml- 1), to give a scatter of values which was in good agreement with clinical expectations. In 21 cases where the <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> result could be compared with the in vivo response, there were 4 true positive comparisons (sensitive <b>in</b> <b>vitro,</b> sensitive <b>in</b> vivo), 15 true negative comparisons (resistant both <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> and <b>in</b> vivo) and 2 false positive comparisons (sensitive <b>in</b> <b>vitro,</b> resistant <b>in</b> vivo). A result was obtained in 86 % (65 / 76) of samples received.

40|$|We {{report the}} {{development}} and evaluation of electro-chemical sensors for continuous on-line measurement of whole-blood ionized calcium, potassium, and glucose in living animals. Ionized calcium and potassium are mea-sured with Ion-selective electrodes, by using a unique differenhal approach. A polarographic sensor coupled with a membrane with bound glucose oxidase {{is used in the}} glucose analyzer. The modular concept of instrument design permits one mainframe, computer, and pump system to house any analyzer module or a combination of modules. A small volume of venous blood (about 2 mL/h) is continuously withdrawn from the subject through a double-lumen catheter and pumped through the analyz-er(s). Results of <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>correlation</b> studies and studies in normal dogs (including responses of ionized calcium, potassium, and glucose to various stresses) support the validity of the measurements. Additional Keyphrases: ion-selective electrodes immobilized enzymes electrolytes The development and evaluation of an on-line glucose an-alyzer for use in a glucose-controlled insulin infusion system (Biostatore GCIIS) have been reported (1 - 6). The capability for on-line monitoring has now been extended to ionized cal-cium (Biostator Ca Monitor) 2 and potassium determina-tions. Furthermore, {{through the use of a}} modular concept in instrument design (2, 3), it is now possible to use two analyzers concomitantly, and to monitor glucose and potassium si-multaneously. We report the results of evaluations of the ionized calcium and potassium systems and give examples showing the utility of this on-line monitoring method. Electrochemical probes have been selected as the basis of the glucose, ionized calcium, and potassium analyzers. The advantages of these sensors, besides their relatively low ex-pense, are their small size, speed of response, and lack of in-terference from turbidity; i. e., they can be used directly with diluted blood without any sample pretreatment. In addition, the calcium electrode is the only means available for deter-mining the biologically active form of calcium, ionized calciu...|$|E
40|$|Solid tumors {{have been}} {{observed}} to develop an acidic extracellular environment, which is believed to occur {{as a result of}} lactic acid accumulation produced during aerobic and anaerobic glycolysis. Experiments using glycolysis-deficient ras-transfected Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts have been performed to test the hypothesis that lactic acid production within solid tumors is responsible for the development of tumor acidity. The variant cells have defects in glucose transport and in the glycolytic enzyme phosphoglucose isomerase with 1 % activity compared to parental cells. Consequently, the in vitro rate of lactic acid production by variant cells was < 4 % compared to parental cells. An <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>correlation</b> between lactic acid production and acidification of exposure medium was observed for parental and variant cells. Implantation of both cell lines into nude mice led to tumors with minimal difference in growth rate. As expected, variant cells died when exposed to hypoxic conditions in culture, and parental tumors were observed to have a larger fraction of cells resistant to radiation due to hypoxia (27 %) than variant tumors (2 %). Using pH microelectrodes, parental (n = 12) and variant (n = 12) tumors were observed to have extracellular pH (pHe) values of 6. 65 +/- 0. 07 and 6. 78 +/- 0. 04 (mean +/- SE, P = 0. 13), respectively, whereas normal muscle had a pHe of 7. 29 +/- 0. 06 (P < 0. 0001 for both cell lines). The lactic acid content of variant tumors was found to be similar to that in serum, whereas parental tumors had lactic acid content that was higher than in serum (P < 0. 0001). We conclude that there was no correlation between lactic acid content and acidosis for these tumors derived from ras-transfected fibroblasts. These results provide evidence that the production of lactic acid via glycolysis is not the only mechanism responsible for the development of an acidic environment within solid tumors...|$|E
40|$|Protective {{immunity}} against lethal {{infection is}} developed when BALB/c or C 57 BL/ 6 mice are immunized with plasmids containing genes from the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. However, genetic vaccination {{of the highly}} susceptible mouse strain A/Sn promoted limited survival after challenge. This observation questioned whether this type of vaccination would be appropriate for highly susceptible individuals. Here, we compared the protective efficacy and the immune response after individual or combined genetic vaccination of A/Sn mice with genes encoding trans-sialidase (TS) or the amastigote surface protein- 2 (ASP- 2). After challenge, {{a significant proportion of}} A/Sn mice immunized with either the asp- 2 gene or simultaneously with asp- 2 and ts genes, survived infection. in contrast, the vast majority of mice immunized with the ts gene or the vector alone died. Parasitological and histological studies performed in the surviving mice revealed that these mice harbored parasites; however, minimal inflammatory responses were seen in heart and striated muscle. We used this model to search for an <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>correlation</b> for protection. We found that protective immunity correlated with a higher secretion of interferon-gamma by spleen cells on in vitro restimulation with ASP- 2 and the presence of ASP- 2 -specific CD 8 cells. Depletion of either CD 4 or CD 8 or both T-cell subpopulations prior to the challenge rendered the mice susceptible to infection demonstrating the critical contribution of both cell types in protective immunity. Our results reinforce the prophylactic potential of genetic vaccination with asp- 2 and ts genes by describing protective immunity against lethal T. cruzi infection and chronic tissue pathology in a highly susceptible mouse strain.

40|$|The NCCLS M 38 -A {{document}} {{does not}} describe guidelines for testing caspofungin acetate (MK- 0991) and other echinocandins against molds. This study evaluated the susceptibilities of 200 isolates of Aspergillus fumigatus, A. flavus, A. nidulans, A. niger, and A. terreus to caspofungin (MICs and minimum effective concentrations [MECs]) by using standard RPMI 1640 (RPMI) and antibiotic medium 3 (M 3), two inoculum sizes (103 and 104 CFU/ml), and two MIC determination criteria (complete [MICs- 0] and prominent growth inhibition [MICs- 2]) at 24 and 48 h. Etest MICs were also determined. In general, caspofungin MIC- 2 and MEC pairs were comparable with both media and inocula (geometric mean ranges of MECs and MICs, respectively, with larger inoculum: 0. 12 to 0. 64 μg/ml and 0. 12 to 0. 44 μg/ml with RPMI versus 0. 04 to 0. 51 μg/ml and 0. 03 to 0. 21 μg/ml with M 3); however, MEC results were less influenced by testing conditions than MICs, {{especially with the}} larger inoculum. Overall, the agreement between caspofungin Etest MICs and broth dilution values was higher with MECs obtained with M 3 (> 90 %) and the large inoculum than under the other testing conditions. Because RPMI is a more stable and chemically defined medium than M 3, the determination at 24 h of the easier visual MECs with RPMI and the inoculum recommended in the M 38 -A document {{appears to be a}} suitable procedure at present for <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> testing of caspofungin against Aspergillus spp. Future <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>correlations</b> with <b>in</b> vivo outcome of both microdilution and Etest procedures may detect more-relevant testing conditions...|$|R

40|$|Defining {{the precise}} {{clean-up}} goals for lead (Pb) contaminated sites requires site-specific information on relative bioavailability data (RBA). While in vivo measurement is reliable but resource insensitive, <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> approaches promise to provide high-throughput RBA predictions. One challenge on using <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> bioaccessibility (BAc) to predict in vivo RBA {{is how to}} minimize the heterogeneities associated with <b>in</b> vivo-in <b>vitro</b> <b>correlations</b> (IVIVCs) stemming from various biomarkers (kidney, blood, liver, urinary and femur), <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> approaches and studies. In this study, 252 paired RBA-BAc data were retrieved from 9 publications, and then a Bayesian hierarchical model was implemented to address these random effects. A generic linear model (RBA (%) = (0. 87 ± 0. 16) × BAc + (4. 70 ± 2. 47)) of the IVIVCs was identified. While the differences of the IVIVCs among the <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> approaches were significant, the differences among biomarkers were relatively small. The established IVIVCs were then applied to predict Pb RBA of which an overall Pb RBA estimation was 0. 49 ± 0. 25. In particular the RBA in the residential land was the highest (0. 58 ± 0. 19), followed by house dust (0. 46 ± 0. 20) and mining/smelting soils (0. 45 ± 0. 31). This is a new attempt to: firstly, use a meta-analysis to correlate Pb RBA and BAc; and secondly, estimate Pb RBA in relation to soil types...|$|R
