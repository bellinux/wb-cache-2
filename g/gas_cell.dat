25|$|The gas {{cells were}} made of goldbeater's skins, {{one of the most}} gas-impervious {{materials}} known at the time. Named for their use in beating and separating gold leaf, goldbeater's skins were made from the outer membrane of the large intestines of cattle. The membranes were washed and scraped to remove fat and dirt, and then placed in a solution of water and glycerine in preparation for application to the rubberized cotton fabric providing the strength of the gas cells. The membranes were wrung out by hand to remove the water-glycerine storage solution and then rubber-cemented to the cotton fabric and finally given a light coat of varnish. The 20 gas cells within the airframe were filled to about 85% of capacity at normal barometric pressure. Each <b>gas</b> <b>cell</b> had a spring-loaded relief valve and manual valves operated from the control car.|$|E
25|$|As the {{production}} of radioactive atoms by the ISOL technique depends on the free atom chemistry of the element to be studied, there are certain beams which cannot be produced by simple proton bombardment of thick actinide targets. Refractory metals such as tungsten and rhenium do not emerge from the target even at high temperatures due to their low vapour pressure. In order to produce these types of beams, a thin target is required. The Ion Guide Isotope Separator On Line (IGISOL) technique was developed in 1981 at the University of Jyväskylä cyclotron laboratory in Finland. In this technique, a thin uranium target is bombarded with protons and nuclear reaction products recoil out of the target in a charged state. The recoils are stopped in a <b>gas</b> <b>cell</b> and then exit through a small hole {{in the side of}} the cell where they are accelerated electrostatically and injected into a mass separator. This method of production and extraction takes place on a shorter timescale compared to the standard ISOL technique and isotopes with short half-lives (sub millisecond) can be studied using an IGISOL. An IGISOL has also been combined with a laser ion source at the Leuven Isotope Separator On Line (LISOL) in Belgium. Thin target sources generally provide significantly lower quantities of radioactive ions than thick target sources and this is their main drawback.|$|E

2500|$|The exact {{location}} of the initial fire, its source of ignition, {{and the source of}} fuel remain subjects of debate. The cause of the accident has never been determined conclusively, although many hypotheses have been proposed. Sabotage theories notwithstanding, one hypothesis often put forth involves a combination of gas leakage and atmospheric static conditions. Escaping hydrogen gas (in this specific case from incomplete or damaged vents {{along the top of the}} vessel and especially near the rear upper tail fin) will typically burn after mixing with air and will explode when mixed with air in the right proportions. This, along with the high static collected from flying within stormy conditions could have combined to ignite the leaking gas and down the airship. In addition, a certain amount of gas may have been inexplicably lost out the top of the vessel for, at the same time, water ballast was noticeably released to slow the rate of descent. The initial explosion would therefore have been the result of the quickening fire reaching the gas bags themselves via the compromised aft-most vent at the vessel's stern. Another more recent theory involves the airship's outer covering. The silvery cloth covering contained material including cellulose nitrate which is highly flammable. This theory is controversial and has been rejected by other researchers because the outer skin burns too slowly to account for the rapid flame propagation and gaps in the fire correspond with internal <b>gas</b> <b>cell</b> divisions, which wouldn't be visible if the fire spread across the skin first. Hydrogen fires had previously destroyed many other airships.|$|E

It was never understood why the valve stuck open, and subsequently the crew only used the hand-operated maneuvering valves for cells 2 and 3. 38 hours after departure, one of the airship's four Daimler-Benz 16-cylinder diesel engines [...] (engine car no. 4, the forward port engine) suffered a wrist pin breakage, damaging the piston and cylinder. Repairs were started immediately and the engine functioned on fifteen cylinders {{for the remainder of}} the flight. Four hours after engine 4 failed, engine no. 2 (aft port) was shut down, as one of two bearing cap bolts for the engine failed and the cap fell into the crank case.

40|$|Mechanisms {{that can}} be {{responsible}} for the ability of wheat flour doughs to retain gas are discussed. It is concluded that the relevant types of physical instabilities are Ostwald ripening (disproportionation) and coalescence of <b>gas</b> <b>cells.</b> The extent of Ostwald ripening is probably primarily controlled by surface rheological properties; it certainly affects crumb structure, but it cannot explain the differences in gas retention among doughs from various cereals or various wheat cultivars. It is argued that surface forces only provide a stabilizing mechanism for dough films between <b>gas</b> <b>cells,</b> i. e., against coalescence, for films that are much thinner than the diameter of a starch granule. It is concluded that variation in the potential for gas retention among wheat flour doughs is largely due to variation in bulk rheological properties. We propose a new rheological criterion for the extensibility of dough films between <b>gas</b> <b>cells</b> (and thereby for gas retention) that is based on the strain hardening of the dough in biaxial extension exceeding a specific lower limit. The criterion is translated into measurable parameters. Preliminary experiments on doughs with poor and with satisfactory baking performance illustrate its potential importance...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} a fibre optic {{sequential}} multipoint sensor using a single DFB laser source for measurement of average concentration of methane has been reported. A theoretical model for sequential multipoint sensor is developed. The validation of the sensor is conducted using methane <b>gas</b> <b>cells</b> connected in series via fibre optics to form 2 -Cell and 3 -Cell networks. The second harmonic detection of wavelength modulation spectroscopy (2 f-WMS) is employed. Normalisation of the 2 f signals {{with respect to the}} laser average intensity and the detector gain is used to correct for transmission variation. The measurements are performed at four laser modulation depths to compare the 2 f-WMS signals for the target test conditions. The Q(6) transition of the 2 v band of methane near 1666 nm has been selected because the transition is relatively free of interference from water vapour and absorption by other major gases in that region. The sequential multipoint sensor has some unique advantages over the single cell and multiplexed multipoint sensors. These include the average concentration measurements, the use of only a single laser source, a detector, and a fibre optic to connect series of <b>gas</b> <b>cells,</b> no need for multiplexing techniques to distribute the laser intensity among multi <b>gas</b> <b>cells,</b> and relatively simpler data analysis...|$|R

A protein (σX) in the gram-positive human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes (the group A Streptococcus or GAS) was recently shown to function in vitro as a secondary sigma factor. We report here the isolation of a mutant in which both sigX genes are inactivated, show that σX functions in <b>GAS</b> <b>cells,</b> and show {{that the amount of}} σX is controlled at two levels. Primer extension analysis indicates that sigX transcription is low in <b>GAS</b> <b>cells</b> grown in Todd-Hewitt yeast broth, and immunoblot assays with a σX-specific polyclonal antibody demonstrate that the protein does not accumulate in these cells. To increase the level of sigX transcription in GAS, we constructed a strain that constitutively expresses the sigX gene from a heterologous promoter. Expression of sigX from this promoter led to transcription of the σX-dependent cinA promoter in <b>GAS</b> <b>cells.</b> We found that expression of the sigX gene in a clpP mutant strain resulted in greater accumulation of σX protein, which resulted in higher levels of transcription from the σX-dependent promoters cinA, smf, and cglA. In addition, a clpP mutant containing sigX only at its wild-type loci on the chromosome generated more transcription from the σX-dependent cinA promoter than did the wild-type parental strain. Therefore, σX activity in GAS is limited by low-level transcription of the sigX structural genes and by clpP, which appears to negatively regulate σX accumulation...|$|R

Water transport from crumb to crust was determined. Short proved crispy rolls showed lower rate of crust water uptake while longer proved rolls showed faster uptake during cooling down.
