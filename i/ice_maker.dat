50|$|A {{domestic}} <b>ice</b> cream <b>maker</b> is {{a machine}} {{used to make}} small quantities of ice cream for personal consumption. <b>Ice</b> cream <b>makers</b> may prepare the mixture by employing the hand-cranking method or by employing an electric motor. The resulting preparation is often chilled through either pre-cooling the machine or by employing a machine that freezes the mixture.|$|R
50|$|Ice is now {{produced}} on an industrial scale, for uses including food storage and processing, chemical manufacturing, concrete mixing and curing, and consumer or packaged ice. Most commercial icemakers produce three basic types of fragmentary ice: flake, tubular and plate, {{using a variety}} of techniques. Large batch <b>ice</b> <b>makers</b> can produce up to 75 tons of ice per day.|$|R
50|$|Born in Hanna, Alberta {{and raised}} in an orphanage in Victoria, British Columbia, Jenkins served in the Royal Canadian Air Force {{from the age of}} 17. He would be posted in Germany and in Canada to do various {{military}} jobs. He eventually left the military to work with Sunoco. That wouldn't last, and Jenkins convinced the curling club in Trenton, Ontario to take him on as <b>ice</b> <b>maker.</b> He wanted to be an <b>ice</b> <b>maker</b> after noting how terrible the ice was at the 1974 provincial championships he was competing in.|$|E
50|$|In the {{pumpable}} <b>ice</b> <b>maker</b> liquid {{treatment is}} used to remove particles down to 1 µm in size and to minimize fouling of the heat transfer surface of the evaporators. Plate heat exchangers {{also need to be}} disassembled and cleaned periodically. Properly treating liquid before it enters the pumpable <b>ice</b> <b>maker</b> or the Plate heat exchanger will help to limit the amount of scale build-up, thus reducing cleaning times and preventative maintenance costs. Improperly sizing the liquid filter system leads to costly early change outs and poor performance.|$|E
50|$|Typically, the {{equipment}} for the production, accumulation and supplying of pumpable ice includes an <b>ice</b> <b>maker,</b> a storage tank, a heat exchanger, piping, pumps, and electrical and electronic appliances and devices.|$|E

50|$|Berwind was {{interested}} in technology, and The Elms {{was one of the}} first homes in America to be wired for electricity with no form of backup system.

25|$|An <b>ice</b> cream <b>maker</b> is {{a machine}} {{used to make}} small {{quantities}} of ice cream at home. The machine may stir the mixture by hand-cranking or with an electric motor, and may chill the ice cream by using a freezing mixture, by pre-cooling the machine in a freezer, or by the machine itself refrigerating the mixture. An <b>ice</b> cream <b>maker</b> must freeze the mixture, and must simultaneously stir or churn it to prevent the formation of ice crystals and aerate it to produce smooth and creamy ice cream. In 1843, New England housewife Nancy Johnson invented the hand-cranked ice cream churn. She patented her invention but lacked the resources to make and market it herself. Johnson sold the patent for $200 to a Philadelphia kitchen wholesaler who, by 1847, made enough <b>ice</b> cream <b>makers</b> to satisfy the high demand. From 1847 to 1877, more than 70 improvements to <b>ice</b> cream <b>makers</b> were patented.|$|R
