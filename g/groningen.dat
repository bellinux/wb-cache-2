5|$|<b>Groningen</b> placed Robben {{in their}} first team for the 1999–2000 season. He scored three goals in league play. Manager Jan van Dijk added the winger to the first team before Groningen's November 2000 away game against Twente, {{but he did not}} play until 3 December 2000 against RKC Waalwijk as a {{substitute}} for the injured Leonardo dos Santos in the 79th minute. During the winter, Robben managed to play himself into the starting lineup. In 18starts for <b>Groningen</b> over the 2000–01 season, he scored two goals. Robben was named player of the year for his first season with the club, and with teammate Jordi Hoogstrate, he demonstrated the strength of the <b>Groningen</b> youth academy. Robben stayed with <b>Groningen</b> and improved steadily during the 2001–02 season, playing in 28matches and scoring six goals. Robben transferred to PSV for €3.9million before the 2002–03 season.|$|E
5|$|On 17 June 2010, the 19-year-old Kieftenbeld {{signed a}} {{four-year}} contract with Eredivisie club <b>Groningen,</b> who paid a €300,000 {{fee for the}} player. He was presented as a right back, despite only ever having played in midfield. In his first season at <b>Groningen</b> he did indeed play at right back, competently enough, but in a 5–1 defeat away to Feyenoord, he struggled against Ryo Miyaichi, a player with pace and ability with both feet, and eventually fouled him to concede a penalty. <b>Groningen</b> finished the season in fifth position, thus qualifying for the play-offs for {{a place in the}} Europa League. Kieftenbeld was sent off in the first leg of the semi-final, so was suspended for the second. He was replaced at half-time in the first leg of the final, which <b>Groningen</b> lost 5–1 to ADO Den Haag, and was an unused substitute in the second leg as they recovered from the four-goal deficit only to lose out on penalties.|$|E

5|$|Haber {{began his}} soccer career by playing for Dunbar SA from 1994 to 2002. He then joined Vancouver Selects in 2002, {{progressing}} through the youth ranks, where he helped lead his local {{team to a}} national championship in early 2006. He played for the Whitecaps FC Reserves in the Pacific Coast Soccer League in 2006, before travelling to Europe, spending two seasons playing for the U19 team of FC <b>Groningen</b> of the Dutch Eredivisie. During his time at <b>Groningen,</b> he played regularly for the club's youth side, making over 20 appearances, as well as making two further appearances for the reserve team.|$|E
5|$|Robben {{was born}} in Bedum, a {{satellite}} town of <b>Groningen,</b> in the northeastern Netherlands. He took to football from an early age, becoming an adherent of the Coerver Method. Robben's skill in ball control and technical footwork made him a valuable player, and he was quickly signed by regional club FC <b>Groningen.</b> Here, he developed his distinctive style of cutting inside from the right onto his left foot to score some quite spectacular goals.|$|E
5|$|Kieftenbeld {{was more}} often {{substitute}} than starter {{in the first}} few weeks of 2012–13 under new manager Robert Maaskant, but went on to re-establish himself in the side. A minor knee injury sustained during the mid-season training camp meant he missed a couple of matches, and thereafter his appearances in the starting eleven were intermittent, whether through suspension or just not being selected. <b>Groningen</b> finished in seventh place, albeit 19 points behind Twente whom they faced in the play-offs. Kieftenbeld put in a strong performance in the first leg in a 1–0 defeat at home, but a 3–2 loss in the second leg confirmed that <b>Groningen</b> would not qualify for the Europa League.|$|E
5|$|Museum de Oude Wolden {{is located}} at the Hoofdweg in the village Bellingwolde in the {{municipality}} Bellingwedde in the east of the province <b>Groningen</b> near the Dutch–German border. It is situated in the south of the region Oldambt and in the north of the region Westerwolde.|$|E
5|$|Robben {{married his}} girlfriend Bernadien Eillert on 9 June 2007 in <b>Groningen.</b> The two met while {{in high school}} in the city, at the Kamerlingh Onnes, and have two sons, Luka (born 2008) and Kai (born 2012) and a daughter, Lynn (born 2010). Robben's father, Hans, works as his agent.|$|E
5|$|Verdugo, {{having been}} {{forced by the}} Union of Arras – formed by the Dutch provinces loyal to Spanish King Philip II, who wanted the foreign troops out the Netherlands – to hand over his {{regiment}} to his brother-in-law Charles von Mansfeld, recruited a regiment of 2,000 Walloon arquebusiers {{and made his way}} to Friesland. While mustering his infantry in the village of Kerpen, Verdugo learned that the Dutch rebels were leving a company of German reiters – a type of armoured cavalry armed with pistols – in Cologne under a rittmeister called Adam von Langen. As he lacked cavalry or pikemen and it was reported by Spanish agents that von Langen was angry because he had been paid by the Dutch with false coins, Verdugo managed to convince the rittmeister to escort his arquebusiers to <b>Groningen.</b> Passing through Bredevoort and Coevorden, Verdugo and his regiment reached <b>Groningen.</b> There, Verdugo was met with a mutiny, which he ended by distributing 40,000 escudos amongst the mutineers, disbanding an undisciplined German regiment and giving license to two companies of men-at-arms to join Farnese's army in Hainault. With the loyal troops, meanwhile, he took two Dutch forts, one {{at the mouth of the}} Emden and another near <b>Groningen.</b>|$|E

5|$|The station {{building}} in Winschoten {{was completed in}} 1865. The third part of Staatslijn B between <b>Groningen</b> and Winschoten was opened on 1 May 1868. Trains were initially operated by the Maatschappij tot Exploitatie van Staatsspoorwegen (Company for the Exploitation of the State Railways). Services between Winschoten and Nieuweschans started in November 1868, and between Nieuweschans and Leer in Germany in December 1876, when the Harlingen–Nieuweschans railway {{was connected to the}} Ihrhove–Nieuweschans railway.|$|E
5|$|The {{station has}} three tracks and two platforms. , {{there are two}} local train {{services}} with trains every {{half an hour to}} and from <b>Groningen,</b> and trains every hour to and from Bad Nieuweschans and Leer (Germany).

5|$|Van Hoëvell {{was born}} in Deventer {{to one of the}} last of the old noble {{families}} in the Netherlands. His parents were Gerrit Willem Wolter Carel, Baron van Höevell (born Deventer, 21 April 1778), and Emerentia Luthera Isabella, Baroness van der Capellen (born Haarlem, 31 August 1787); he grew up with six brothers and sisters. While van Hoëvell was still young, the family moved to <b>Groningen</b> where he attended Latin school. Van Hoëvell enrolled in the University of <b>Groningen</b> in 1829 and studied theology. In 1830, he saw military action in Belgium during the abortive attempt by the North-Netherlands to maintain the unity of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands. He returned from the war gravely ill, but recovered and then returned to the university. He graduated summa cum laude with a dissertation on Irenaeus in 1836, and in that same year married Abrahamina Johanna Trip, with whom he would have two daughters and four sons; one daughter and one son died young.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{influence}} of the later Habsburg families, who ruled in both Spain and other nations of Europe, the Andalusian was crossbred with horses of Central Europe and the Low Countries and thus was closely related to many breeds that developed, including the Neapolitan horse, <b>Groningen,</b> Lipizzaner and Kladruber. Spanish horses have been used extensively in classical dressage in Germany since the 16th century. They thus influenced many German breeds, including the Hanoverian, Holstein, East Friesian and Oldenburg. Dutch breeds such as the Friesian and Gelderland also contain significant Spanish blood, as do Danish breeds such as the Fredericksborg and Knabstrupper.|$|E
5|$|Derek McInnes was {{announced}} as {{the successor to}} Craig Brown in March 2013. In McInnes' first season as manager, Aberdeen won the 2013–14 Scottish League Cup after defeating Inverness 4–2 on penalties, their first trophy in 19 years. Aberdeen {{finished third in the}} Scottish Premiership, and began the next season by coming through the early rounds of the Europa League, beating Dutch club FC <b>Groningen</b> before eventually being eliminated by Spanish side Real Sociedad. The club ended the season in second place in both 2015 and 2016, their best league position since 1993–94. In recent seasons' Europa League competitions, they were defeated in the third qualifying round three times: In 2015–16 by FC Kairat, in 2016–17 by NK Maribor, and in 2017–18 by Apollon Limassol.|$|E
5|$|Feyenoord {{headed to}} Cambuur Leeuwarden in the {{beginning}} of November, resulting in a 0–2 win with goals by Immers and Te Vrede. The win moved Feyenoord back into fourth place in the league table. The club hosted AZ in the second week of November for a 2–2 draw. Te Vrede and Immers scored 3 minutes apart just after half time; the final score was reached after Jóhannsson successfully converted a penalty.

5|$|In the 1980s, a {{minority}} of the club's supporters had {{a reputation as one of}} Britain's most prominent casuals groups, the Aberdeen Soccer Casuals. The rise of the Aberdeen Casuals coincided with the most successful period in the club's history, and has been chronicled in more than one published account. Whilst numbers have steadily declined with the introduction of Football Banning Orders preventing hooligans from travelling to games, the Aberdeen Casuals still appear at big fixtures often away from home and in the UEFA Europa League. There were clashes at both fixtures against FC <b>Groningen</b> in 2014, as well as 13 arrests after violent clashes with Dundee United fans at a game in December 2015.|$|E
5|$|Municipalities {{have the}} right to decentralize {{themselves}} and form submunicipalities as an additional level of government. This right and the submunicipalities will cease to exist in the near future {{to reduce the number of}} levels of government. Only Amsterdam, where the districts are called stadsdelen, and Rotterdam, where the districts are called deelgemeenten, consist of such formal subdivisions. The Hague, Almere, Breda, Eindhoven, Enschede, <b>Groningen,</b> Nijmegen and Utrecht have instituted stadsdelen as well, although they do not have the same legal submunicipal status. For administrative use by municipalities and data collection by Statistics Netherlands all municipalities are subdivided into districts (wijken), which in turn are subdivided into neighbourhoods (buurten). These subdivisions have, in contrast to the submunicipalities, no formal status. , the municipalities in the Netherlands were subdivided into 2,621 districts and 11,896 neighbourhoods.|$|E
5|$|Robben {{first came}} to {{prominence}} with <b>Groningen,</b> for whom he was {{player of the year}} for the 2000–01 Eredivisie season. Two years later he signed for PSV, where he became the Netherlands' Young Player of the Year and won an Eredivisie title. The following season Robben's signature was pursued by leading English clubs, and after protracted transfer negotiations he joined Chelsea in 2004. Robben's Chelsea debut was delayed through injury, but upon returning to fitness he helped Chelsea bring home two consecutive Premier League titles, and was the FA Premier League Player of the Month in November 2005. After a third season in England which was punctuated by injury, Robben moved to Spanish club Real Madrid for €35million.|$|E
5|$|Stefano Braschi {{from the}} Italian Football Federation, was {{appointed}} to officiate the final, making it his first time to decide a closing match in a European contest. He was regonised as a professional Serie A referee in 1992. The Italian took charge of his first European fixture in a 1996 UEFA Intertoto Cup group stage meeting between Lierse and <b>Groningen.</b> The same year, Braschi made FIFA's international referees list; he debuted in February 1997 in a Israel–Germany friendly. Before the final, {{he had been the}} match official in four Champions League and two UEFA Cup matches (including one qualifier), as well as four international friendlies. Braschi was accompanied by an all-Italian team, which was made up of assistant referees Gennaro Mazzei and Pietro Contente – the reserve referee was unveiled as Livio Bazzoli.|$|E
5|$|After {{a series}} of residencies, Davey {{embarked}} on a pre-Christmas tour of Ireland in 2007. She appeared on the seventh series of Other Voices in early 2008.

5|$|Kieftenbeld {{was twice}} shortlisted for the Eredivisie's annual Maatschappelijk Speler (Community Player) award, which {{brings with it}} a €50,000 prize to be donated to a social project of the winner's choice. He was {{actively}} involved with Kids United, a football team for children with disabilities. Although he did not win on either occasion, his charity still benefited when the 2015 winner, Jeroen Zoet, shared the prize money {{with the other two}} nominees. In late July 2015, English club Birmingham City made a bid for Kieftenbeld's services that triggered the release clause in his contract. Although <b>Groningen</b> accepted they could not stop him leaving, they were disappointed not just at losing their captain so soon {{before the start of the}} new season, but at losing a player who did so much for the club in the community.|$|E
5|$|On 2 March Feyenoord played Ajax at home, {{where they}} lost 1-2 despite taking a first-half lead. On 3 March, the club {{announced}} Fred Rutten would succeed Ronald Koeman as manager per 1 July 2014 for the 2014–15 season. Feyenoord played FC <b>Groningen</b> away the following Sunday.

25|$|Ajax saw {{potential}} in Suárez and offered <b>Groningen</b> €3.5million for him, but <b>Groningen</b> rejected the offer. Suárez was upset and brought {{his case to}} the Royal Dutch Football Association (KNVB)'s arbitration committee to try to facilitate the sale. The arbitration committee ruled against him on 9 August 2007, but that same day, Ajax increased their offer to €7.5million and <b>Groningen</b> accepted.|$|E
25|$|The monastery {{is located}} in the extreme {{southeast}} of the province of <b>Groningen</b> on a forested sand ridge along the ancient trade route from Münster to <b>Groningen.</b> For passing travelers and pilgrims, the monastery was a place of hospitality and dedication. Ter Apel is the last monastery founded in <b>Groningen,</b> and of 34 monasteries in the province it is the only one still recognizable as a convent.|$|E
25|$|The Gelderlander was {{originally}} bred in the Gelderland {{region of the}} Netherlands. Although geographically close to <b>Groningen,</b> the soil in Gelderland is much sandier and {{does not require a}} horse with the same power as the <b>Groningen</b> horse. While breeders in <b>Groningen</b> used other horses bred on the heavy Frisian soil - the Alt-Oldenburger, East Friesian, and Holsteiner - those in Gelderland more often used half-bred French stallions as outcrosses. Therefore, Gelderlanders were and remain significantly longer-legged than their northern cousins, though they have the same high-set necks and level toplines.|$|E

25|$|The {{absence of}} Cambuur caused FC <b>Groningen</b> {{to be the}} nearest Eredivisie team and soon it became rivals with Heerenveen. Strikingly, both {{northern}} sides used to maintain more or less of a friendship in the past. Therefore, this Northern Derby rivalry is only based on geographical location. Because most Heerenveen fans have always considered Cambuur as main rivals, this derby {{is often referred to}} as a surrogate derby. However, <b>Groningen</b> fans do consider Heerenveen as main rivals, which created a situation in which there is hatred from <b>Groningen</b> towards Heerenveen, but not vice versa. Traditionally, the winner claims the title Pride of the North.|$|E
25|$|After the conquests of Steenwijk and Coevorden by the States, Frisians troops {{demanded that}} <b>Groningen</b> should be besieged. The army of Maurice {{moved on to}} <b>Groningen</b> but the States-General had decided {{otherwise}} to press on to Geertruidenberg; the Frisians {{as a sign of}} protest sent no troops to the siege but regardless the Spanish garrison there surrendered after a three-month siege.|$|E
