5000|$|D. dadantii is able {{to infect}} the fleshy, {{succulent}} plant parts, such as tubers, rhizomes, stems and leaves, causing localized symptoms. As discussed in the symptoms section, it is also capable of infecting the xylem, resulting in a systemic infection that causes wilting. [...] D. dadantii typically originates from infected insects, vegetables or host plant residues. However, the bacteria are also able to survive in soils and other plants without infection. [...] The ability of D. dadantii {{to live in the}} soil as a plant pathogen is regulated by virulence genes in response to environmental factors that control whether the bacterium is saphrophytic or pathogenic. [...] When D. dadantii is virulent it enters primarily through hydathodes and wounds, with the assistance of jasmonates, where the bacteria rapidly breakdown the parenchymatous tissues with the use of pectic enzymes). [...] D. dadantii produces many pectinases that are responsible for disassembly of the plant cell wall. After the cell wall is degraded, and the contents of the cell are accessed, D. dadantii catabolizes glucose by a fermentation pathway. [...] After the plant has been accessed, colonization is a complicated process that requires many additional factors for successful infection. These factors include: “cellulases, iron assimilation, a Hrp type III secretion system, exopolysaccharides, motility, and proteins involved in resistance against plant defense mechanisms”. [...] The plant attempts to resist the infection with different defense mechanisms and D. dadantii must overcome obstacles, such as defense barriers, secondary metabolites and toxic materials. [...] An example of a plant defense mechanism is to produce a defensive barrier, such as a cork layer. However, when the infection is spread by larvae, the cork layer is eaten as quickly as it is made by the plant. Consequently, the protective cork layer is an <b>ineffective</b> <b>protection</b> mechanism. [...] The bacteria continue to spread and multiply throughout the plant, moving in the intercellular spaces, within collapsed cells and the xylem. As the bacteria grow in numbers, additional hosts are infected through the spread of bacteria by: splashing water from infected plants, insects, and cultural practices including the use of contaminated tools, gloves and machinery and improper storage of cultivated crops or seeds. [...] D. dadantii can be a problem year round, given the right environmental conditions exist. It {{is able to}} infect plants in greenhouses, indoor interiorscapes and tropical areas where temperatures and humidity remains high. At higher latitudes, infections are mainly during the hot and humid summer months.|$|E

Section IV concludes that multilevel governance for protecting the national self-interest in international public goods must no longer be designed only as ‘foreign policy’, but rather as an ever more important part of ‘multilevel constitutionalism’ for the protection of essential citizen interests. Rather than relying on hierarchical claims (e. g. regarding national primacy of state sovereignty, international primacy of international law over domestic law), the diverse national and international legal regimes must be coordinated with due respect for ‘constitutional pluralism’, ‘deliberative democracy’, ‘balancing’ of competing rights and values, and international duties of cooperation (e. g. among national and international courts of justice). ‘Westphalian conceptions’ of international law as an instrument for advancing national interests in an anarchic world remain important for protecting ‘national public goods’ (like national security).

Using an antigen competition, indirect and avidity ELISA techniques, serum tetanus antitoxin levels, distribution of anti-TT IgG subclasses and their binding avidities, respectively, were determined. Our findings showed that 5. 1 % of pregnant women and 36 % of male blood donors had tetanus antitoxin levels below 0. 1 IU /ml. In addition to the most dominant anti-TT IgGl antibody, anti-TT IgG 2, anti-TT IgG 3 and anti-TT IgG 4 subclass antibodies were also detected.

40|$|The {{cardinal}} {{feature of}} apoptosis is the activation {{of a family}} of proteases termed caspases, and in some forms, loss of mitochondrial integrity and release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm are viewed as necessary components of cell death. In receptor-mediated apoptosis, more specifically Somatostatin (SST) receptor (SSTR) - and Fas-signaled apoptosis, an additional feature is intracellular acidification (pHi) and Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase (PTP) activity. Increased translocation and activity of PTP, more specifically SHP- 1 at the cell membrane as well as the functional activation of caspase- 8 are required to reduce pHi. Also, a decrease in mitochondria) membrane potential (Deltapsim) and release of cytochrome c (cyt c) are concomitant with a decrease in pHi suggesting that mitochondrial dysfunction is a consequence and not a cause of acidification. Inhibition of caspase- 8 activation and prevention of SHP- 1 translocation abrogates the ability of SST to induce acidification and mitochondrial disruption, whereas inhibition of other caspases such as caspase- 9, or - 3 / 7 are <b>ineffective.</b> <b>Protection</b> from cell death can also be accomplished by Bcl- 2. In this model, Bcl- 2 elevates resting pHi and attenuates acidification and apoptosis only when the overexpressed Bcl- 2 is targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) but not the mitochondria. In conclusion, we established that mitochondrial breakdown follows acidification and that acidification is dependent on caspase- 8 and SHP- 1 activation. Additionally, effector caspases are induced only when there is concomitant acidification.

40|$|Thesis (MA (Information Science)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2009. Traditional {{information}} {{protection mechanisms}} {{are no longer}} adequately placed to effectively deal with the adversarial threats that have arisen {{as a result of}} the rise in importance of knowledge for today’s organisations. Business counterintelligence appears to be a protective entity, which in principle can effectively engage with and mitigate many of these newly manifested threats. Yet, business counterintelligence is also an entity that is accompanied by a great deal of haze and confusion as to its use, implementation and integration within different organisations. This is evident from the literature where there currently exist multiple fragmented definitions of what business counterintelligence is. Organisations may as a result adopt a particular business counterintelligence definition that may not be effective for their context. This can result in the <b>ineffective</b> <b>protection</b> of critical information assets and the misappropriation of organisational resources; something which is not sustainable. This thesis proposes that in order to allay the confusion caused by these differing fragmented definitions, one needs to be able to arrive at a consolidated definition of what constitutes business counterintelligence; this thesis’s primary objective. This has been examined by firstly contextualising business counterintelligence in order to better understand the topic; the information society was used as a backdrop for this purpose. Secondly, an examination of the prevailing views of business counterintelligence and its role within organisations is offered in order to build clarity. Thirdly, a consolidated definition of business counterintelligence is proposed and its implications for different organisations examined. Finally, the implications of this consolidated definition for the sustainability of business counterintelligence are discussed and conclusions based on the evidence presented within the thesis drawn. Based on the arguments presented, this thesis postulates that a consolidated definition of business counterintelligence is more effective and is thus more sustainable...|$|E

As a result consumers are able to access credit via a host of different suppliers. The evolution of the credit market was hastened by the deregulation of consumer credit legislation by the Conservative government in the 1980 s and 1990 s. The article outlines how this relaxation led to an increase in the availability of ‘convenient credit’, which is defined as ‘credit that is granted by the creditor with little or no reference to the credit worthiness of the debtor’. The article identifies several problems that have arisen from access to ‘convenient credit’ and how this has resulted in the previous Labour government and Coalition government introducing a number of measures to tackle these problems.

Pirolin injected simultaneously with doxorubicin showed antioxidative effect and markedly attenuated lipid peroxidation in the heart tissue caused by this drug. In contrast to Pirolin, structurally related Pirolid was <b>ineffective</b> in the <b>protection</b> of heart myocytes from DOX-induced lipid peroxidation...|$|R
