5|$|A {{hole was}} bored in the cornerstone, {{and a time}} capsule was placed inside {{containing}} forty-two items. The items included annual reports from all the government agencies, a Bible, samples of several varieties of crops grown in Indiana, several new coins, local maps and newspapers, {{a book on the}} history of Indianapolis, and pamphlets <b>from</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city's institutions.|$|E
5|$|Predators such as foxes {{and cats}} prey on quolls and compete {{with them for}} food. For example, both quolls and foxes catch and consume rabbits. Since the {{introduction}} of foxes, quoll populations have dropped dramatically. Foxes have been eradicated <b>from</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> islands {{off the coast of}} Australia in an effort to protect quolls.|$|E
5|$|Edmund Crouchback {{passed on}} the castle to his eldest son, Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, in 1298. Lancaster married Alice de Lacy, which made him the richest nobleman in England. Kenilworth became the primary castle of the Lancaster estates, {{replacing}} Bolingbroke, and acted as both a social and a financial centre for Thomas. Thomas built the first great hall at the castle from 1314 to 1317 and constructed the Water Tower along the outer bailey, as well as increasing {{the size of the}} chase. Lancaster, with support <b>from</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other English barons, found himself in increasing opposition to Edward II. War broke out in 1322, and Lancaster was captured at the Battle of Boroughbridge and executed. His estates, including Kenilworth, were confiscated by the crown. Edward and his wife, Isabella of France, spent Christmas 1323 at Kenilworth, amidst major celebrations.|$|E

5|$|Louis VIII died in 1226, {{leaving his}} 12-year-old son, Louis IX, to inherit the throne, {{supported}} by a regency government. The young French King was in a much weaker position than his father, and faced opposition <b>from</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French nobility who still maintained their ties to England, leading to a sequence of revolts across the country. Against this background, in late 1228 a group of potential Norman and Angevin rebels called upon Henry to invade and reclaim his inheritance, and Peter de Dreux, the Duke of Brittany, openly revolted against Louis and gave his homage to Henry.|$|E
5|$|The 4th Baronet who {{was also}} Edward Strachey, a Liberal politician, was {{returned}} to Parliament for Somerset South at the 1892 general election. He served under Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman and later H. H. Asquith as Treasurer of the Household from 1905 to 1909 and under Asquith as Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries from 1909 to 1911. He was raised to the Peerage as Baron Strachie in 1911. During the 1970s major restoration work was undertaken to deal with dry rot and replace wiring {{which resulted in the}} removal of several ceilings and decorations <b>from</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rooms.|$|E
5|$|The revisionist {{perspective}} has subsequently {{been supported}} by his children, Maxim and Galina, and many Russian musicians. Volkov has further argued, both in Testimony and in Shostakovich and Stalin, that Shostakovich adopted {{the role of the}} yurodivy or holy fool in his relations with the government. Other prominent revisionists are Ian MacDonald, whose book The New Shostakovich put forward further revisionist interpretations of his music, and Elizabeth Wilson, whose Shostakovich: A Life Remembered provides testimony <b>from</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> composer's acquaintances.|$|E

5|$|Wilfrid was a {{prolific}} founder of churches, which he then controlled until his death, {{and was a}} great fundraiser, acquiring lands and money <b>from</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kings he was in contact with. He was also noted {{for his ability to}} attract support from powerful women, especially queens. Queen Eanflæd, his first patron, introduced him to a number of helpful contacts, and he later attracted the support of Queen Æthelthryth, who gave the endowment for Hexham Abbey. Ælfflæd, sister of King Aldfrith of Northumbria and daughter of Wilfrid's old patron Queen Eanflæd, helped to persuade the Northumbrians to allow Wilfrid to return from his last exile.|$|E
5|$|Several minor {{alterations}} {{were made}} to the Upper Ward under Victoria. Anthony Salvin rebuilt Wyatville's grand staircase, with Edward Blore constructing a new private chapel within the State Apartments. Salvin also rebuilt the State Dining Room following a serious fire in 1853. Ludwig Gruner assisted {{in the design of the}} Queen's Private Audience Chamber in the south range. Blore and Salvin also did extensive work in the Lower Ward, under the direction of Prince Albert, including the Hundred Steps leading down into Windsor town, rebuilding the Garter, Curfew and Salisbury towers, the houses of the Military Knights and creating a new Guardhouse. George Gilbert Scott rebuilt the Horseshoe Cloister in the 1870s. The Norman Gatehouse was turned into a private dwelling for Sir Henry Ponsonby. Windsor Castle did not benefit <b>from</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> minor improvements of the era, however, as Victoria disliked gaslight, preferring candles; electric lighting was only installed in limited parts of the castle at the end of her reign. Indeed, the castle was famously cold and draughty in Victoria's reign, but it was connected to a nearby reservoir, with water reliably piped into the interior for the first time.|$|E

25|$|Concrete, as the Romans knew it, {{was a new}} {{and revolutionary}} material.

25|$|Lawrence's Natural {{history of}} man {{contained}} some remarkable anticipations of later thought, but was ruthlessly suppressed.

25|$|Ultimately, the Tsarist {{government}} officially {{recognized the}} Karaim as being of Turkic, not Jewish, origin. Because the Karaim were {{judged to be}} innocent {{of the death of}} Jesus, they were exempt <b>from</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> harsh restrictions placed on other Jews. They were, in essence, placed on equal legal footing with Crimean Tatars. The related Krymchak community, which was of similar ethnolinguistic background but which practiced rabbinical Judaism, continued to suffer under Tsarist anti-Jewish laws.|$|E
25|$|A {{possible}} {{identification of}} Byttering with a Thomas Byteryng has been made. Byteryng was a canon at Hastings Castle between 1405 and 1408, {{and was a}} rector somewhere in London in 1414. There is no information on the composer in the Old Hall Manuscript other than that his surname is attached to several pieces. Those pieces stand out <b>from</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> works in the manuscript by their relatively advanced stylistic traits.|$|E
