40|$|The electrocatalytic {{properties}} of multi-walled carbon nanotube modified electrodes toward the oxidation of NADH are critically evaluated. Carbon nanotube modified electrodes are examined and compared with boron-doped diamond and glassy carbon electrodes, and most importantly, <b>edge</b> <b>plane</b> and basal pyrolytic graphite electrodes. It is found that CNT modified electrodes {{are no more}} reactive than <b>edge</b> <b>plane</b> pyrolytic graphite electrodes with the comparison with <b>edge</b> <b>plane</b> and basal plane pyrolytic graphite electrodes allowing the electroactive sites for the electrochemical oxidation of NADH to be unambiguously determined as due to <b>edge</b> <b>plane</b> sites. Using these highly reactive <b>edge</b> <b>plane</b> sites, <b>edge</b> <b>plane</b> pyrolytic graphite electrodes are examined with cyclic voltammetry and amperometry for the electroanalytical determination of NADH. It is demonstrated that a detection limit of 5 microM is possible with cyclic voltammetry or 0. 3 microM using amperometry suggesting that <b>edge</b> <b>plane</b> pyrolytic graphite electrodes can conveniently replace carbon nanotube modified glassy carbon electrodes for biosensing applications with the relative advantages of reactivity, cost and simplicity of preparation. We advocate the routine use of <b>edge</b> <b>plane</b> and basal plane pyrolytic graphite electrodes in studies utilising carbon nanotubes particularly if 'electrocatalytic' properties are claimed for the latter...|$|R

The morphology {{of the resulting}} graphene modified electrode was investigated by atomic force microscopy. In cyclic voltammetric responses, both anodic and cathodic peak currents varied linearly with the square root of scan rates over the range of 25 - 600 mV in 0. 1 M KCl containing 5 mM Fe(CN) (6) (4 -) at graphene modified basal and <b>edge</b> <b>plane</b> pyrolytic graphite electrodes, which suggests a diffusion-controlled process. The graphene modified basal and <b>edge</b> <b>plane</b> pyrolytic graphite electrodes exhibited the abilities to lower the electrooxidation potentials of beta-nicotinamide adenine clinucleotide and hydrogen peroxide in comparison with bare basal and <b>edge</b> <b>plane</b> pyrolytic graphite electrodes.

40|$|The first {{examples}} of using <b>edge</b> <b>plane</b> pyrolytic graphite electrodes for anodic and cathodic stripping voltammetry (ASV and CSV) are presented, notably the ASV {{of silver and}} the CSV of manganese. In the former example, detection limits for silver (based on 3 σ) of 8. 1 nM and 0. 185 nM for 120 s and 300 s accumulation time, respectively, were achievable using the <b>edge</b> <b>plane</b> electrode, which were superior to those observed on glassy carbon, basal plane pyrolytic graphite and boron-doped diamond electrodes. In the second example, a detection limit for manganese of 0. 3 μM was possible which was comparable with that achievable with a boron-doped diamond electrode but with an increased sensitivity. Comparison of the <b>edge</b> <b>plane</b> pyrolytic graphite electrode with boron-doped diamond electrodes reveals that the <b>edge</b> <b>plane</b> electrode has comparable detection limits and sensitivities whilst exhibiting a lower signal-to-noise ratio and large potential window for use in trace analysis suggesting boron-doped diamond can be conveniently replaced by <b>edge</b> <b>plane</b> pyrolytic graphite as an electrode material in many applications. © 2005 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH and Co.

The electrochemical oxidation of chloride is found to only occur on boron-doped diamond while the electrochemical reversibility for the oxidation of bromide on <b>edge</b> <b>plane</b> pyrolytic graphite is similar to that seen at glassy carbon whilst being superior to basal plane pyrolytic graphite and boron-doped diamond. In the case of iodide oxidation, <b>edge</b> <b>plane</b> and basal plane pyrolytic graphite and glassy carbon display similar electrode kinetics but are all superior to boron-doped diamond.

Simultaneous additions of cadmium(II) and lead(II) were investigated where two linear ranges between 0. 1 - 100 and 0. 1 - 300 microg/L and also detection limits of 0. 062 and 0. 084 microg/L were obtained, respectively. The method was then successfully applied to the simultaneous determination of cadmium(II) and lead(II) in spiked river water, where recoveries of 100. 5 and 98 % were obtained, respectively. This electroanalytical protocol using <b>edge</b> <b>plane</b> pyrolytic graphite electrodes is one of the simplest methodologies to date using non-mercury based electrodes and is simpler and cheaper than alternatives such as carbon nanotube electrode arrays, suggesting the use of <b>edge</b> <b>plane</b> pyrolytic graphite electrode for routine sensing...|$|R

40|$|The {{electron}} transfer kinetics of ferrocyanide, potassium hexachloroiridate(III), hexaammineruthenium(III) chloride, and N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD) {{have been examined}} at basal <b>plane</b> and <b>edge</b> <b>plane</b> pyrolytic graphite electrodes which {{have been allowed to}} oxidise in air for various periods of time. It is demonstrated via voltammetric and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis that oxygenated species formed at <b>edge</b> <b>plane</b> sites/defects decrease the {{electron transfer}} kinetics of ferrocyanide but that the rates for potassium hexachloroiridate(III), hexaammineruthenium(III) chloride and TMPD are insensitive to the oxygenated species.

40|$|Graphitic {{electrodes}} find {{widespread use}} throughout electrochemistry; understanding their fundamental electrochemical properties is imperative. It is widely thought that graphite <b>edge</b> <b>plane</b> sites exhibit faster rates of electron transfer {{as compared to}} basal plane sites. Hitherto the different rates of electron transfer at the edge and basal sites have been inferred indirectly using diffusional systems. To avoid possible complications we alternatively study a surface-bound system to simplify the interpretation. The voltammetric response of graphitic-surface-bound anthraquinone monosulfonate (AQMS) with varying pH, reveals two distinct voltammetric responses, ascribed as being due to the basal and <b>edge</b> <b>plane</b> sites; where the pK(a)  s associated with the reduced anthraquinone are found to differ for the two sites. Through modelling of the system based upon a "scheme of squares" mechanism {{it is possible to}} conclude that both the thermodynamics and kinetics of the species differ in the two environments in which the rate of electron transfer at the basal plane site is shown to be 2 - 3 orders of magnitude slower than that of the <b>edge</b> <b>plane</b> site. This work provides the first example of a voltammetric response which is purely due to electron transfer at a basal plane site. Further, we believe {{this is the first time}} a full "scheme of squares" model has been used for the quantitative analysis of a diffusionless 2 H(+) 2 e(-) system...|$|R

40|$|In this study, much {{improved}} voltammetric peak separation and sensitivity of uric acid and ascorbic acid {{was observed at}} a screen-printed carbon electrode modified with nanoplatelets of graphitic oxide (GO). Electrochemical sensing of uric acid and ascorbic acid was further used to explore the role of oxygen functionalities and <b>edge</b> <b>plane</b> sites on electrocatalysis at GO. We successfully apply a microwave-assisted hydrothermal elimination method to remove the oxygen-containing functional groups from the GO surface. The <b>edge</b> <b>plane</b> on GO can be retained and the density of oxygen-containing functional groups can be easily controlled by varying the microwave treatment temperature. Using this platform, such discrimination to peak separation is attributed to the very distinct behavior of uric acid and ascorbic acid to form hydrogen bonds with oxo-surface groups (especially COOH group) at GO.

40|$|The role {{of oxygen}} {{functionalities}} and <b>edge</b> <b>plane</b> sites on disposable screen-printed carbon electrodes (SPCE) was evaluated for simultaneous determination of dopamine, uric acid and ascorbic acid in this study. Both electrochemically preanodized and oxygen plasma treated SPCEs were adopted {{for the purpose}} of partially differentiating these two effects. Raman and XPS analyses verify that different treatment can indeed induce different surface characteristics. The electrocatalytic activity thereby increases by the substantial increase in surface bound carbon-oxygen functional groups and/or the generation of <b>edge</b> <b>plane</b> sites through surface reorientation. Possible mechanism is proposed to explain the voltammetric behavior. The peaks for dopamine, uric acid and ascorbic acid are especially well-resolved from each other at the electrochemically preanodized SPCE and simultaneous detection at neutral pH can thus be obtained by this simple approach.

40|$|Through {{theoretical}} modelling {{based upon a}} diffusion domain approach, we show that for a basal plane pyrolytic graphite electrode with a 10 - 20 % surface coverage of <b>edge</b> <b>plane</b> sites, minimal differences in the voltammetric response should be expected from that of an <b>edge</b> <b>plane</b> pyrolytic graphite electrode.

40|$|This work {{studies the}} effect of edge-to-basal plane ratio on the {{macroscopic}} formation kinetics and electrochemical properties of the solid-electrolyte-interphase (SEI). The relative fraction of <b>edge</b> and basal <b>planes</b> was calculated by measuring the double-layer capacitance of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) in 1. 0 M KCl. The formation kinetics was studied using chronoamperometry (CA) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). The electrochemical properties of the SEI were studied by CV and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of ferrocene. Results show that, as expected, current due to both lithium intercalation and SEI formation increases with the fraction of <b>edge</b> <b>planes.</b> After SEI formation in LiClO 4 -based electrolyte, the <b>edge</b> <b>plane</b> permits slightly more electron transfer to ferrocene. Attempts to form the SEI incompletely by running CV scans to progressively lower voltages show that oxygen contamination produces a more passivating SEI. Ferrocene CV shows that the SEI formation causes mass-transport limitations by either formation of a porous layer or blocking the active area of the electrode, but the kinetics of the ferrocene reaction remains fast even {{in the presence of}} the SEI.

30|$|The enolized {{functional}} {{groups on}} the surfaces of graphite {{have a significant effect}} on the cycle lives of graphite anodes. For the testing of cycle life, both cells were tested at C/ 10 (= 0.037 A/g) for the first five cycles to generate stable SEI layers and then at C/ 3.3 (= 0.111 A/g) for subsequent cycles. As displayed in Fig.  2 b, while both samples show similar initial specific capacities, the MG anode exhibits much better cycling performance compared to that of the PG anode. After 30 cycles, the MG anode retains 102  % of the original capacity, whereas the PG anode retains only 54  % of the original capacity. The improved cycle life of the MG anode results from formation of stable SEI layers [41, 42, 47, 48, 49, 50] because it has been known that lithium carboxylic salts (enolized functional groups in the current study) can be chemically bonded to the outer SEI layers generated from electrolyte reduction which has turned out to be more stable during repeated cycles than those formed directly on the graphite surfaces. In detail, the chemically bonded SEI layers have been previously found to (1) adhere robustly to the <b>edge</b> <b>planes</b> owing to the role of the enolized surface functional groups serving as glue or bonding agents for Li 2 CO 3 based SEI layers [41], (2) block the co-intercalation of bulky counter ions such as PF 6 − [51], and (3) thus prevent the exfoliation of exposed <b>edge</b> <b>planes.</b> It is also anticipated that the well-developed <b>edge</b> <b>planes</b> of the MG play a role in persistent Li (de)intercalation and therefore the better cycle life. Although XPS analyses were performed from the expectation of distinctive chemical characteristic of MG, O 1 s spectra appear quite similar for both cases, which is likely due to the limited number of the functional groups formed at the edges of MG. This observation is also consistent with the small reductive CV peak in Fig.  2 a corresponding to the enolization. Thus, the amount of chemically bonded SEI layers is predicted to be limited. However, the modified SEI layers can still play a critical role for efficient Li diffusion because Li (de)intercalation takes place mainly through the <b>edge</b> <b>planes</b> where the modified SEI layers are in direct contact.|$|R

A rigorous electrochemical study on the solution phase and solid phase cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPC) is presented in chapter 2. The formof CoPC on carbon electrodes was characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM). The use of CoPC modified <b>edge</b> <b>plane</b> pyrolytic graphite (CoPC-EPPG) for sensing nitrite (NO₂⁻) was also investigated. It was found that the claimed mediator CoPC has no influence on the process. A bare glassy carbon (GC) electrode was successfully applied for the quantitative determination of nitrite as a simple alternative to the modified electrodes reported in the literature (chapter 3). Chapter 4 compares the voltammetric responses of an <b>edge</b> <b>plane</b> pyrolytic graphite electrode covalently modifed with 2 -anthraquinonyl groups (EPPG-AQ 2) and solution phase anthraquinone monosulphonate (AQMS) {{in the presence of a}} limited concentration of protons. The solution phase and surface bound species show analogous responses resulting in split waves. Digisim™ simulation of the AQMS voltammetry have shown that the pH adjacent to the electrode may be altered by up to 5 - 6 pH units in low buffered solutions; this is caused by the consumption of protons during the electrochemical reaction. Chapters 5 and 6 compare the electrochemical properties of 2 -anthraquinonyl groups covalently attached to an <b>edge</b> <b>plane</b> pyrolytic graphite (EPPG) and to a gold electrode. In both cases simulations using newly developedMarcus-Hush-Chidsey theory for a 2 e⁻ process assuming a uniform surface did not achieve a good agreement between theory and experiment. Subsequently two models of surface inhomogeneity were investigated: a distribution of formal potentials, E Ө, and a distribution of electron tunneling distances, r₀. For both EPPG-AQ 2 and Au-AQ 2 modified electrodes the simulation involving E Ө distribution turned out to be the most adequate. This is the first time that Marcus-Hush-Chidsey theory has been applied to a 2 e⁻ system. Chapter 7 briefly summarizes the obtained results.
