500|$|British neo-Theosophical occultist Alice Bailey, one of {{the founders}} of the {{so-called}} New Age movement, prophesied in 1940 the eventual victory of the Allies of World War II over the Axis powers (which occurred in 1945) and the establishment by the Allies of a political and religious New World Order. She saw a federal world government as the culmination of Wells' Open Conspiracy but favorably argued that it would be synarchist because it was guided by the Masters of the Ancient Wisdom, intent on preparing humanity for the mystical second coming of Christ, and the dawning of the Age of Aquarius. According to Bailey, a group of ascended masters called the <b>Great</b> <b>White</b> <b>Brotherhood</b> works on the [...] "inner planes" [...] to oversee the transition to the New World Order but, for now, the members of this Spiritual Hierarchy are only known to a few occult scientists, with whom they communicate telepathically, but as the need for their personal involvement in the plan increases, there will be an [...] "Externalization of the Hierarchy" [...] and everyone will know of their presence on Earth.|$|E

Mathew ordained Wedgwood as a priest in 1913. In 1916 Willoughby consecrated Gauntlett, King, and Wedgwood.Leadbeater wrote to Annie Besant, in 1916, that Wedgwood offered Mathew's Old Catholic movement to Maitreya, one of the <b>Great</b> <b>White</b> <b>Brotherhood's</b> ascended masters and holder of the office of World Teacher, [...] "as one of the vehicles for Maitreya's force, and a channel for the preparation of His Coming." [...] Leadbeater took Wedgwood during a festival in Sydney to make that offering. Goodrick-Clarke wrote that the [...] was used for [...] "the assimilation of Catholicism and its sacraments into the Theosophical Society" [...] as a subsidiary movement of a diversified second generation Neo-Theosophy which emphasized [...] "the acquisition and practice of psychic and occult powers, notably clairvoyance, explorations of the astral plane, past lives research." [...] Leadbeater promoted an unorthodox esoteric understanding of Christian creeds; he interpreted Christian doctrines through Theosophy. Leadbeater and Wedgwood revised The Old Catholic Missal and Ritual, , by [...] "eliminating references to fear of God, everlasting damnation, the insistence on sinfulness and appeals for mercy," [...] according to Joanne Pearson, in Wicca and the Christian Heritage. Later that year, before the end of World War I, the schism which separated from Mathew's group was renamed the Liberal Catholic Church (LCC) and Wedgwood became the first presiding bishop. Leadbeater informed Besant that Maitreya approved of the [...] founding. The [...] "affirms a number of Christian beliefs but injects a Gnostic or theosophical meaning into them," [...] according to Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology. [...] "The church believes that humans are sparks of divinity (rather than creatures of God) and believes in reincarnation (rather than resurrection). The church also accepts the idea of the spiritual hierarchy of masters, or highly evolved beings who guide the spiritual development of the race. In this regard, it accepts the idea that Jesus is one of the masters, but separates the human Jesus ... from the master Jesus." [...] In other words, Jesus, [...] "the person known in his early life as Appolonius of Tyanna" [...] in that system of beliefs, {{is not the same as}} the entity known as Maitreya in that same system beliefs.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>Great</b> <b>White</b> <b>Brotherhood,</b> {{also known}} as Great Brotherhood of Light or the Spiritual Hierarchy of Earth, is {{perceived}} as a spiritual organization composed of those Ascended Masters who have risen from the Earth into immortality, but still maintain an active watch over the world. C.W.

5000|$|The Universal <b>White</b> <b>Brotherhood’s</b> name can {{be easily}} {{misunderstood}} because of the connotations that people have about each individual word. It is easy {{to assume that the}} use of the term “white” has a racist connotation, which is compounded by the ambiguity of the term as well as the vagueness of the terms “universal” and “brotherhood”. “Universal” refers to humans’ ability to understand universal concepts about life. It speaks to the idea that people can expand their consciousness with these concepts that extend to more than just one person or group. “White” does not refer to a person's skin tone, rather, it is, “the highest spiritual symbol, which is the synthesis of all colors…being the manifestations of the soul’s virtues." [...] This group respects each race, religion, and nationality, which leads to the final term of “brotherhood”. “Brotherhood” is meant to indicate that the Universal <b>White</b> <b>Brotherhood’s</b> teachings are for every human no matter what community, religion, or group they belong to. The Universal <b>White</b> <b>Brotherhood’s</b> name symbolically represents the groups belief that their teachings are for everyone so that they can expand their consciousness and embrace a virtuous spirituality.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>White</b> <b>Brotherhood</b> was {{an urban}} society (or militia) of Toulouse {{established}} in 1211 during the episcopate of Folquet de Marselha, so-called from its members' habit of wearing white crosses on their chests. The society, called a [...] "pious institution" [...] by William of Puylaurens, was militant towards usurers (Jews) and Cathars, robbing them and destroying their homes. Most of the Whites {{came from the}} city proper. A Black Brotherhood, so-called {{in opposition to the}} White, was soon formed and the two factions went to war in the streets of Toulouse. According to Puylaurens:Daily the two parties would clash, banners flying, bristling with weapons, even with cavalry in evidence. Through the agency of His servant the bishop, Our Lord came to bring them, not a bad peace but a good war. From the <b>White</b> <b>Brotherhood</b> Folquet selected 500 men-at-arms and sent them to aid the Albigensian Crusade in besieging Lavaur. The bishop even composed pro-Crusade sirventes for the troops to sing. Count Raymond VII, however, forbade the citizens to go and tried to force Folquet from the city. The <b>White</b> <b>Brotherhood</b> did go, however, and the bishop eventually left as well, to join the siege at Lavaur.|$|R

50|$|In Toulouse, the {{orthodox}} <b>White</b> <b>Brotherhood</b> pursued the heretical Black Brotherhood.

5000|$|The ritual magicians of the Western mystery {{tradition}} sometimes {{refer to}} the <b>Great</b> <b>White</b> <b>Brotherhood</b> as the [...] "Great White Lodge", a name that appears to indicate that they imagine it constitutes an initiatory hierarchy similar to Freemasonry.

[...] While some go on to [...] "higher evolution in other spheres", others become teaching Masters who stay behind to help younger initiates in their [...] "cyclic evolution on this planet". Only a few of this community are known to the human race; these initiates are the [...] "teaching Masters."
