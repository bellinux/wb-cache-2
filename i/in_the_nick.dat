As they leave they bump into a bellhop who is delivering food to Bruckman's room.

40|$|Recently, two Drosophila melanogaster {{models of}} infection, fly feeding and fly nicking, have been {{developed}} that allow a determination of pathogenic potential of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. In this study, control strains, isolates from burn wounds, and isolates from the sputa of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients were {{used to compare the}} two infection models to determine whether any of the isolates might be better adapted to either of <b>the</b> models. <b>In</b> addition, our goal was to determine the variability of isolates from individual CF patients. Three of four control strains (PAO 1, PAK, and PA 14) caused significant mortality <b>in</b> <b>the</b> flies <b>in</b> both models of infection. The remaining control strain, PA 103, was lethal to flies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nicking</b> model but lacked significant lethality <b>in</b> <b>the</b> feeding model. The burn wound isolates had a high level of lethality in both models. Interestingly, the CF isolates had the largest diversity of lethality in both models of infection. The range of pathogenic potentials of the CF isolates occurred across a cohort of patients, both at the patient level and down to the level of individual sputum samples. The majority of all isolates had similar levels of lethality in both fly infection models. However, two CF isolates were significantly more lethal <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nicking</b> model, and three CF isolates were significantly more lethal <b>in</b> <b>the</b> feeding model. <b>In</b> conclusion, <b>the</b> two Drosophila infection models were useful for the analysis of the diversity of pathogenic potentials of P. aeruginosa isolates...|$|R

5|$|The {{impact of}} the {{conflict}} was not all positive from the French perspective. The revolts in Tyrol and the Kingdom of Westphalia during the conflict were an indication that there was much discontent over French rule among the German population.

40|$|A {{simple method}} for purifying the gene A plus A* {{proteins}} of bacteriophage (PHI) X 174 is presented.
