(b) To what extent do <b>emotional</b> <b>disturbance</b> and delinquency co-occur during adolescence and young adulthood? and (c) What are the longitudinal associations between <b>emotional</b> <b>disturbance</b> and delinquency in different age and gender categories during adolescence and young adulthood? Data were used from a national sample of 1, 302 adolescents and young adults, who participated in a 6 -year 3 -wave longitudinal study. Findings showed an increase of <b>emotional</b> <b>disturbance</b> and delinquency from early to midadolescence, after which <b>emotional</b> <b>disturbance</b> stabilized and delinquency declined into young adulthood. A significant but relatively weak co-occurrence of <b>emotional</b> <b>disturbance</b> and delinquency was found. Multigroup LISREL analyses demonstrated that a stability model with no cross-lagged relations fit best for the total sample, and across age and gender categories. Thus, co-occurrence of <b>emotional</b> <b>disturbance</b> and delinquency during adolescence and young adulthood seems to result from associated but separate psychopathological processes.

40|$|ABSTRACT SEVERE <b>EMOTIONAL</b> <b>DISTURBANCE</b> RATES IN A NORTHERN CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBAL COMMUNITY by David Russell Hazard Master of Social Work California State University, Chico Spring 2011 This thesis {{involved}} an exploratory study of severe <b>emotional</b> <b>disturbance</b> rates among youth {{in a predominantly}} Native American tribal community in northern California. Secondary data was collected from surveys of 93 local youth attending community events in 2009 and 2010. Analysis sought to identify potential youth with severe <b>emotional</b> <b>disturbance</b> as measured by inordinate frequencies of heightened emotions and behaviors in response to anger. Mitigating factors such as gender, ethnicity, cultural engagement, substance abuse, {{and the number of}} parents in the home were examined. This study found that tribal affiliation, gender, Native American ethnicity, and cultural engagement were factors associated with differences in severe <b>emotional</b> <b>disturbance</b> indicators. The survey measures were unable to be compared with existing normed assessments for severe <b>emotional</b> <b>disturbance.</b> This study was limited by these untested measures, small sample size, and convenience sampling methods. Recommendations for the community are to support culturally appropriate activities for all ethnicities and genders, particularly females, and to assess community youth with thorough, normed assessments for severe <b>emotional</b> <b>disturbance</b> indicators.

There is also a severe maldistribution of {{child and adolescent}} psychiatrists, especially in rural and poor, urban areas where access is significantly reduced. There are currently only approximately 6,500 practicing child and adolescent psychiatrists in the United States. A report by the US Bureau of Health Professions (2000) projected a need in the year 2020 for 12,624 child and adolescent psychiatrists, but a supply of only 8,312. In its 1998 report, the Center for Mental Health Services estimated that 9-13% of 9- to 17-year-olds had serious <b>emotional</b> <b>disturbances,</b> and 5-9% had extreme functional impairments. However, in 1999, the Surgeon General reported that [...] "there is a dearth of child psychiatrists." [...] Only 20% of emotionally disturbed children and adolescents received any mental health treatment, a tiny percentage of which was performed by child and adolescent psychiatrists. Furthermore, the US Bureau of Health Professions projects that the demand for child and adolescent psychiatry services will increase by 100% between 1995 and 2020.|$|E
2500|$|Paul Nordoff, a Juilliard School {{graduate}} and Professor of Music, was a pianist and composer who, upon seeing disabled children respond so positively to music, {{gave up his}} academic career to further investigate the possibility of music {{as a means for}} therapy. Clive Robbins, a special educator, partnered with Nordoff for over 17 years in the exploration and research of music’s effects on disabled children—first in the United Kingdom, and then in the USA in the 1950s and 60s. Their pilot projects included placements at care units for autistic children and child psychiatry departments, where they put programs in place for children with mental disorders, <b>emotional</b> <b>disturbances,</b> developmental delays, and other handicaps. Their success at establishing a means of communication and relationship with autistic children at the University of Pennsylvania gave rise to the National Institutes of Health's first grant given of this nature, and the 5-year study [...] "Music therapy project for psychotic children under seven at the day care unit" [...] involved research, publication, training and treatment. Several publications, including Therapy in Music for Handicapped Children, Creative Music Therapy, Music Therapy in Special Education, as well as instrumental and song books for children, were released during this time. Nordoff and Robbins's success became known globally in the mental health community, and they were invited to share their findings and offer training on an international tour that lasted several years. Funds were granted to support the founding of the Nordoff Robbins Music Therapy Centre in Great Britain in 1974, where a one-year graduate program for students was implemented. In the early eighties, a center was opened in Australia, and various programs and institutes for music therapy were founded in Germany and other countries. In the United States, the Nordoff-Robbins Center for Music Therapy was established at New York University in 1989.|$|E

40|$|M. A. South Africa is {{perceived}} as a country with many economic and social problems. These are stressors that put individuals at risk of developing <b>emotional</b> <b>disturbance.</b> Children, as the most vulnerable sector of society, have the least access to resources such as psychological intervention. A measurement instrument that can identify <b>emotional</b> <b>disturbance</b> within this high-risk group; that minimises the effects of formal learning, cultural and language barriers; and utilises the minimum of resources is needed. The Draw A Person: Screening Procedure for <b>Emotional</b> <b>Disturbance</b> (DAP: SPED) (Naglieri, McNeish & Bardos, 1991) is a screening test for <b>emotional</b> <b>disturbance</b> that seems to fulfil these criteria. The present study aimed to explore how useful the DAP: SPED is to identify children with <b>emotional</b> <b>disturbance</b> in South Africa. This involved comparing the scores of the DAP: SPED with those of an independent measure for <b>emotional</b> <b>disturbance,</b> the Beck Youth Inventory (BYI-II). To further explore the usefulness of the DAP: SPED, internal reliability and inter-rater reliability were examined. The DAP: SPED and the BYI-II were administered to a group of English-literate Grade 4 learners from two mainstream schools. The emotional status of the children was unknown, and scores from the BYI-II were used to provide this information. As the BYI-II was used as a control measure, the internal reliability coefficients of its subscales were investigated {{within the context of the}} present research. Internal reliability coefficients were good (r=. 823 to r=. 929, p<. 01). A third measure, the Qualitative Questionnaire for Observed Behaviour in the Classroom (QQOBC) was completed by the teachers of participating learners. This measure was used to provide depth to the results as well as independently rate the children’s behaviour. xiv Results showed that the DAP: SPED achieved low correlations with the BYI-II (rho=. 024 to rho=. 76, p<. 01), thereby supporting the null hypothesis. The DAP: SPED was also unable to distinguish between <b>emotional</b> <b>disturbance</b> Present and Absent groups, created post facto according to scores on the BYI-II. A statistical analysis of the internal reliability showed that the DAP: SPED had low internal reliability (α=. 448), and that the omission of the measurement items increased the internal reliability (α=. 525). Inter-rater reliability was significantly high (rho=. 687 to rho=. 816, p<. 01), thereby rejecting the null hypothesis. Despite the good inter-rater reliability, certain scoring problems were encountered that showed that a margin for scoring bias could influence the usefulness of the measure...|$|R
