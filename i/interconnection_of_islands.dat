40|$|Islands present {{sustainable}} energy growth challenges {{due to a}} number of reasons such as remoteness, limited energy resources, vulnerability to external events and strong dependence on international trade agreements. In particular, the Dodecanese Islands of the Aegean Sea cover their electricity needs mostly on the basis of autonomous conventional stations, consuming significant quantities of imported oil annually. Renewable energy sources (RES) penetration increase addresses the global requirements towards a carbon neutral environment, and wind farms (WFs) are among the most well-known green electricity-production alternatives. The study explores wind power installation potential of the Dodecanese Islands and the storage or interconnection options, based on the national and European legislative framework and the international scientific literature. The major finding is that, due to the high wind potential of the area, the National policy and targets focus on the installation of great RES power at Greek islands. Hence, private interests, who are willing to carry out the electrical <b>interconnection</b> <b>of</b> <b>islands</b> to the mainland, serve the same objective. Both scientific and business proposals overcome the local wind power installation capacity and neglect local specifics and needs...|$|E

40|$|Load-shedding is a {{mechanism}} to prevent overloading <b>of</b> an <b>islanded</b> microgrid (MG). To minimize load-shedding, extra support can be provided by interconnecting the overloaded MG to another islanded neighboring MG to support each other. For this, extra generation capacity needs to {{be available in the}} distributed energy resources of the neighboring MG. This paper proposes a decision making criterion for <b>interconnection</b> <b>of</b> two neighboring <b>islanded</b> MGs based on small signal stability analysis. The closed-loop control system of an MG is expressed in statespace domain and used for the stability analysis of the individual MGs as well as the system of coupled MGs. The results of this analysis are applied as a stability criterion to allow <b>interconnection</b> <b>of</b> two <b>islanded</b> MGs. Additionally, if it is revealed that <b>interconnection</b> <b>of</b> MGs will cause instability, the analysis yields the proper range for the droop control coefficients which need to be updated in the DERs, before they MGs are interconnected. MATLAB-based simulation studies are provided to evaluate the developed small signal stability analysis...|$|R

Deployment of inter-domain multicast delivery has been slow due to both technical and administrative reasons. In this {{paper we propose a}} Host Multicast Tree Protocol (HMTP) that (1) automates the <b>interconnection</b> <b>of</b> IP-multicast enabled <b>islands</b> and (2) provides multicast delivery to end hosts where IP multicast is not available. With HMTP, end-hosts and proxy gateways <b>of</b> IP multicast-enabled <b>islands</b> can dynamically create shared multicast trees across different <b>islands.</b> Members <b>of</b> an HMTP multicast group self-organize into an efficient, scalable and robust multicast tree. The tree structure is adjusted periodically to accommodate changes in group membership and network topology. Simulation results show that the multicast tree has low cost, and data delivered over it experiences moderately low latency. I...|$|R
40|$|The first IT-applications were {{supporting}} the more functional domains in an organisation and were {{islands in the}} organisation. Afterwards came other domains and the need of integration of all these functional applications became a critical issue {{for the management of}} the organisation. With the hype around Business Process Reengineering and the raise of Internet, more specifically e-Business, the priority was given to the efficient and effective working of the business processes in an integrated way, because the processes need more speed and throughput to act and react in the faster world economy. Enterprise Application Integration was the response for the <b>interconnection</b> <b>of</b> the <b>islands</b> <b>of</b> information systems of the different functional domains in a company or network of companies throughout the Internet. In this context web services became the way to go for most of those companies. Web services are self contained and self described modular applications, which can be published, discovered and employed on the Internet (Web). The BPM-people understood immediately the potential of using web services in the application {{supporting the}} business processes. However, programmers need to make the link between a web service and the application that supports a step in a business process.

40|$|Greece is {{a country}} with many {{dispersed}} islands where favorable conditions for exploiting RES exist. Cyclades is a group <b>of</b> <b>islands</b> that some <b>of</b> them are not so far away to be interconnected with the mainland and among them. This interconnection will {{reduce the need for}} operating the local oil-fired stations and extending the area they occupy to meet future needs. This paper presents an additional benefit from the <b>Interconnection</b> <b>of</b> Cyclades to the mainland, the exploitation of the very favorable wind conditions of the area.

40|$|In this paper, {{motivated}} by the phenomenon <b>of</b> the <b>interconnection</b> <b>of</b> lossless electrical networks, a class of behaviours known as J-lossless behaviours is introduced, where J is a symmetric two-variable polynomial matrix. It is shown that for certain values <b>of</b> J, <b>interconnection</b> <b>of</b> J-lossless behaviours leads to an oscillatory behaviour. Physically this translates {{to the fact that}} <b>interconnection</b> <b>of</b> two multi-port lossless electrical networks results in an autonomous lossless electrical network. Finally, the problem of decomposition of an oscillatory behaviour with a given characteristic polynomial as an <b>interconnection</b> <b>of</b> two single-input–single-output behaviours, such that one has a lossless positive real transfer function and the other has a lossless negative real transfer function is also considered. This problem can be viewed as an inverse problem to the one <b>of</b> <b>interconnection</b> <b>of</b> J-lossless behaviours...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{recognised}} that satellites can play {{very important role}} in supporting B-ISDN services based on ATM technology. There have been several projects to exploit ATM over satellite for broadband services since 1992. These include the European RACE II CATALYST project which developed a satellite ATM demonstrator and the EPSRC project which studied the <b>interconnection</b> <b>of</b> Broadband ATM <b>Islands</b> via satellite. In a broadband network environment, ATM over satellite {{can be used for}} inter-network connections as transit link and for terminal access as access link. For transit link a small number of earth stations require a high bit rate link. Static bandwidth reservation based on estimated fixed rates provide a simple solution. However for terminal access a large number of terminals require low bit rate links. Since the traffic is expected to have large fluctuations, a dynamic reservation system is a more efficient but complex solution. Dynamic reservation Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) appears to be the best solutions, as it takes advantage of the flexibility and statistical multiplexing capabilities of ATM and supports all traffic classes. The paper shows that ATM over satellite can implement a flexible and efficient bandwidth resource management mechanisms which allows the satellite link to be configured to meet the requirements of broadband services from low bit rate to high bit rate. © 1996 The Institution of Electrical Engineers.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{framework}} called application concentrator, which enables <b>interconnection</b> <b>of</b> multiple closed networks at an application level. Because of rapid development and deployment of advanced networking technologies, various social activities have been shifting onto a network, thus necessitating a technology for providing closed networks for real/virtual groups. In particular, <b>interconnection</b> <b>of</b> multiple closed networks {{is the key}} for realizing those social activities on a network. In this paper, we therefore propose an application-level gateway called application concentrator, which enables <b>interconnection</b> <b>of</b> multiple closed networks for various types of application protocols. In the application concentrator, <b>interconnection</b> <b>of</b> multiple closed networks is realized by multiplexing/demultiplexing the content of communications. For demonstrating effectiveness of the application concentrator, we design example implementations of the application concentrator for three typical applications such as Web, e-mail, and remote desktop...|$|R

40|$|In December 1998, the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) {{began writing}} a {{standard}} for the <b>interconnection</b> <b>of</b> distributed resources with electric power systems. This standard will prescribe technical requirements for the <b>interconnection</b> <b>of</b> distributed resources that are connected to primary or secondary voltages in electric distribution systems. It is expected to {{play a significant role}} in facilitating a new, emerging market for small, distributed, primarily gas-fired electric generators, including new technologies such as fuel cells and micro-turbines. Once published, this new standard will be enforced for the <b>interconnection</b> <b>of</b> distributed wind power applications, as well. The co-authors of this paper have been active with this standard from the beginning, focusing on issues most likely to affect <b>interconnection</b> <b>of</b> wind power.

40|$|The rapid {{emergence}} of distributed fuel cell powered generations (DFPGs) operating {{in parallel with}} utility has brought a number of technical concerns as more DFPGs are connected to utility grid. One {{of the most challenging}} problems is known as islanding phenomenon. This situation occurs when a network is disconnected from utility grid and is energized by local DFPGs. It can possibly result in injury to utility personnel arriving to service isolated feeders, equipment damage, and system malfunction. In response to the concern, this dissertation aims to develop a robust anti-islanding algorithm for utility <b>interconnection</b> <b>of</b> DFPGs. In the first part, digital signal processor (DSP) controlled power electronic converters for utility <b>interconnection</b> <b>of</b> DFPGs are developed. Current control in a direct-quadrature (dq) synchronous frame is proposed. The real and reactive power is controlled by regulating inverter currents. The proposed digital current control in a synchronous frame significantly enhances the performance of DFPGs. In the second part, the robust anti-islanding algorithm for utility <b>interconnection</b> <b>of</b> a DFPG is developed. The power control algorithm is proposed based on analysis of a real and reactive power mismatch. It continuously perturbs (?? 5 %) the reactive power supplied by the DFPG while monitoring the voltage and frequency. If islanding were to occur, a measurable frequency deviation would take place, upon which the real power of the DFPG is further reduced to 80 %; a drop in voltage positively confirms islanding. This method is shown to be robust and reliable. In the third part, an improved anti-islanding algorithm for utility <b>interconnection</b> <b>of</b> multiple DFPGs is presented. The cross correlation method is proposed and implemented in conjunction with the power control algorithm. It calculates the cross correlation index of a rate of change of the frequency deviation and (?? 5 %) the reactive power. If this index increases above 50 %, the chance <b>of</b> <b>islanding</b> is high. The algorithm initiates (?? 10 %) the reactive power and continues to calculate the correlation index. If the index exceeds 80 %, islanding is now confirmed. The proposed method is robust and capable <b>of</b> detecting <b>islanding</b> in the presence of several DFPGs independently operating. Analysis, simulation and experimental results are presented and discussed...|$|R
