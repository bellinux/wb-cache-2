50|$|The {{company was}} formed in 1862 by William Bown. At first the company {{manufactured}} a variety of articles: parts for sewing machines, <b>horse</b> <b>clippers,</b> roller skate wheels and the likes. Many of these devices were the subject of patents filed by William Bown and sometimes {{one or more of}} his colleagues. On several occasions, the company resorted to the courts to try and protect these patents; not always successfully.|$|R
50|$|In {{what became}} {{training}} for their futures in manufacturing, Stewart and Thomas J. Clark {{worked at a}} factory in New Hampshire that produced horse clipping machinery. The lifelong friends later moved to Providence, Rhode Island and worked for the Brown & Sharpe Manufacturing Company. Then, in approximately 1890, the two traveled to Chicago, Illinois where they entered into partnership and manufactured <b>horse</b> <b>clippers,</b> sheep clippers, bicycle handle bars and flexible shafts among other products.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} year, Wolseley bought John Howard's {{rights to}} his <b>horse</b> <b>clipper</b> and {{hired him to}} work as a mechanic on his Euroka station. There Howard made improvements that were so effective that Wolseley began public demonstrations in Sydney and at Euroka. A William Ryley made suggestions for improving the handpiece. In 1887-1888, demonstrations were arranged throughout eastern Australia and New Zealand. The culmination was the first complete shearing by machinery which took place at Sir Samuel McCaughey's woolshed at Dunlop, Louth, N.S.W. and that year, 1888, eighteen more woolsheds were equipped with Wolseley machinery.|$|R

50|$|Since using a bow {{requires}} the rider {{to let go}} of the reins with both <b>hands,</b> <b>horse</b> archers need superb equestrian skills if they are to shoot on the move. The natives of large grassland areas used mounted archery for hunting, for protecting their herds, and for war. Horse archery was for many groups a basic survival skill, and additionally made each able-bodied man, at need, a highly-mobile warrior. The buffalo hunts of the North American prairies may be the best-recorded examples of bowhunting by mounted archers.|$|R

50|$|Since using a bow {{requires}} a horseman {{to let go}} of the reins with both <b>hands,</b> <b>horse</b> archers need superb equestrian skills if they are to shoot on the move. Horse archery is typically associated with Eurasian nomads of the Eurasian steppe. Such were the Scythians and Sarmatians and later the Parthians, Hungarians, and Turks. Scythians were well known for their tactic of the Parthian shot, but evidently it was the Parthians who give it its name. In this tactical manoeuvre the horsemen would make a feigned retreat and progress away from the pursuing enemy while turning his upper body and shooting backwards at the pursuer, guiding his horse with his voice and the pressure of his legs.|$|R

However, the mechanism responsible for the unique characteristics of the quadrupedal walking gait in primates still remains unclear. The present study conducted a forward dynamic simulation of lateral- and diagonal-sequence quadrupedal gait to evaluate effect {{of the difference in}} footfall patterns on gait mechanics. We also analyzed quadrupedal walking gaits of the common marmoset, a primate species known to employ lateral sequence gait, and the Japanese macaque to comparatively investigate the mechanism responsible for the choice of gait sequence...|$|R
