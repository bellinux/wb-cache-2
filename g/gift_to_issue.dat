2500|$|The unborn widow poses {{a similar}} {{seemingly}} silly but logical problem. Suppose that property is left [...] "to A for life, then to his widow for life, then to A's issue." [...] Because the <b>gift</b> <b>to</b> A's widow cannot be resolved until A dies, {{the law will}} consider the possibility that, after the property is left to A, he marries {{a woman who was}} not born at the time the gift was made. For instance, it is possible that in 1950 the property is left to A, in 1955 a woman B is born, and in 1975 A and B marry each other (neither having issue at the time). Furthermore, it is possible that A will die, say in 1980, and his widow B will outlive him for more than 21 years. Suppose that she dies in 2005. [...] B was not a life in being {{at the time of the}} transfer, and the only remaining [...] "validating life" [...] under the rule against perpetuities is A, who has been dead for 25 years by this time. The <b>gift</b> <b>to</b> A's <b>issue</b> does not vest until his widow dies, and since that could theoretically happen more than 21 years after the death of all lives in being at the time of the transfer, the transfer <b>to</b> A's <b>issue</b> is invalid from the start.|$|R

The paper begins by describing challenges faced by modern intelligent tutors and the motivation behind the integration effort, with special consideration given to how this work will better {{meet the needs of}} future serious games. The next three sections expand on these major hurdles more thoroughly, followed by proposed design enhancements that would allow <b>GIFT</b> <b>to</b> overcome these <b>issues.</b> Finally, an overview is given of the authors’ current progress towards implementing the proposed design. The key contribution of this work is an abstraction of the interface between intelligent tutoring systems and serious games, thus enabling ITS authors to implement more complex training behaviors...|$|R
2500|$|Note that {{changing}} the word [...] "issue" [...] to [...] "children" [...] makes the gift valid: Since {{the class of}} [...] "A's children" [...] is closed and completely cognizable {{at the time of}} A's death (plus a gestation period as allowed by the rule), A's children no longer have a vested remainder subject to open; upon A's death, they now have an indefeasibly vested remainder, which is outside the scope of the Rule against Perpetuities. On the contrary, the class of [...] "A's issue" [...] is subject to expand long after A's death, so their future interest remains that of a vested remainder subject to open, which is within the scope of the rule. [...] B cannot serve as the life in being for A's issue because B was not yet born, i.e., not [...] "a life in being," [...] {{at the time of the}} transfer. [...] Because her death could (as explained above) be more than 21 years after A's death, the result is that the <b>gift</b> <b>to</b> A's <b>issue</b> violates the rule because it is possible that the gift will vest more than 21 years after the end of all lives in being at the time the gift was created.|$|R

5000|$|The Restatement (2d) of Property, {{which is}} a {{treatise}} describing general legal principles applied by the courts in the United States states that Infectious invalidity means that the failure of certain transfers may cause interests that are otherwise valid to fail also. This approach was taken in New England Trust Co. v. Sanger, 337 Mass. 342, 149 N.E.2d 598 (1958). A trust provided for income {{to be paid to}} the surviving children of the settlor's brother for life, and on the death of the last surviving child of the settlor's brother, an equal division of the trust principle was to be made among the issue of the children of the settlor's brother. The <b>gift</b> <b>to</b> the <b>issue</b> of the brother's children failed, because the ascertainment of issue could not be made until the brother's children died, and the brother might have children born after the creation of the trust who might not die within the permissible period. However, a later trust had been established by the settlor, which stated that if any provision in the first trust indenture should be declared invalid, any income or principal which reverted to his estate should be deemed held in trust by the settlor for the benefit of his brother's children and their issue. Applying the doctrine of infectious invalidity to avoid a distortion of the settlor's [...] "clear desire," [...] the court held that the second trust should govern the trust distribution. It stated that by striking down all the gifts, valid and invalid, made in the first trust, and by giving effect to the second trust, the settlor's plan for the income gifts was substantially carried out. 1.5 comment 7 ...|$|R

500|$|In Re Finger, Goff J made a {{distinction}} between <b>gifts</b> <b>to</b> incorporated bodies and <b>gifts</b> <b>to</b> unincorporated bodies. When a <b>gift</b> is <b>to</b> an unincorporated body, it must be treated, whatever the wording, as a <b>gift</b> <b>to</b> that body's purpose. This is because unincorporated bodies cannot possess things. If the body has ceased to exist but the purpose continues, the gift has not failed. Incorporated bodies {{on the other hand}} can possess property, and as such, as said by Buckley J in Re Vernon's Will Trust, [...] "A bequest to a corporate body ... takes effect simply as a <b>gift</b> <b>to</b> that body beneficially, unless there are circumstances which show that the recipient is <b>to</b> take the <b>gift</b> as a trustee." ...|$|R
