25|$|Fermentation starts spontaneously {{under the}} action of the natural yeasts from the grapes. The {{winemaker}} can choose to use a commercially available active <b>dry</b> <b>yeast.</b> It can help to express the characteristics of a variety or a method of manufacture. For a dry white wine fermentation continues until the sugar runs out. The wine is then usually decanted to eliminate the lees. When fermentation is done in barrels the temperature often exceeds 20°C or even 25°C.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, re-hydration {{procedures}} {{will also}} {{vary depending on}} the manufacturer and winery. Yeast is often inoculated in a volume of water or grape must that is 5–10 times the weight of the <b>dry</b> <b>yeast.</b> This liquid is often brought to temperature of 40°C (104°F) prior to the introduction of the yeast (though some yeast strains may need temperatures below 38°C (100°F)) to allow the cells to disperse easily rather than clump and sink {{to the bottom of the}} container. The heat activation also allows the cells to quickly reestablish their membrane barrier before soluble cytoplasmic components escape the cell. Re-hydration at lower temperatures can greatly reduce the viability of the yeast with up to 60% cell death if the yeast is re-hydrated at 15°C (60°F). The culture is then stirred and aerated to incorporate oxygen into the culture which the yeast uses in the synthesis of needed survival factors.|$|E

The crude protein intake decreased according to the <b>dried</b> <b>yeast</b> from sugar cane when replacing soybean meal. The digestibility coefficients of DM and NDF showed no difference. Replacement of soybean meal with <b>dried</b> <b>yeast</b> from sugar cane had no effect on performance, because average daily gain and body measurements studied were similar for all animals and inclusion levels.

40|$|Abstract- This {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate the effect of feeding different levels of Brewer’s <b>Dried</b> Grain <b>Yeast</b> mixture (BDGY) {{on the performance of}} white leghorn chicks. A total of three hundred twenty four day-old white leghorn chicks were grouped in to 18 pens of 18 chicks each, and randomly assigned to six treatments (control; 6 % BDGY; 12 % BDGY; 18 % BDGY; 24 % BDGY; 30 % BDGY) according to a completely randomized design (RCD). Brewer’s <b>Dried</b> Grain <b>Yeast</b> mixture was composed of 80 % brewer’s dried grain (BDG) and 20 % brewer’s <b>dried</b> <b>yeast</b> (BDY). The mean dry matter intake and cost of feed per kg live weight gain did not vary (P> 0. 05) among the dietary treatments. However, significantly (P < 0. 01) lower daily gain and dry matter conversion ratio (P < 0. 05) were obtained in chicks fed 24 % BDGY and 30 % BDGY than the rest of dietary treatments. Similarity in growth performance between chicks fed the control and 18 % BDGY was observed.
