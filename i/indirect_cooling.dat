5000|$|Indirect {{evaporative}} cooling (closed circuit) is a cooling process that uses direct {{evaporative cooling}} {{in addition to}} some type of heat exchanger to transfer the cool energy to the supply air. The cooled moist air from the direct evaporative cooling process never comes {{in direct contact with}} the conditioned supply air. The moist air stream is released outside or used to cool other external devices such as solar cells which are more efficient if kept cool. One indirect cooler manufacturer uses the so-called Maisotsenko cycle which employs an iterative (multi-step) heat exchanger that can reduce the temperature to below the wet-bulb temperature. [...] While no moisture is added to the incoming air the relative humidity (RH) does rise a little according to the Temperature-RH formula. Still, the relatively dry air resulting from indirect evaporative cooling allows inhabitants' perspiration to evaporate more easily, increasing the relative effectiveness of this technique. <b>Indirect</b> <b>Cooling</b> is an effective strategy for hot-humid climates that cannot afford to increase the moisture content of the supply air due to indoor air quality and human thermal comfort concerns. The following graphs describe the process of direct and indirect evaporative cooling with the changes in temperature, moisture content and relative humidity of the air.|$|E

One dimensional models were developed for direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>cooling</b> NDDCTs. The inlet conditions to the heat rejection system that correspond to the peak cycle efficiency for the scenario considered were identified and {{used to determine the}} minimum NDDCT size for direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>cooling.</b> The direct cooling configuration requires a smaller tower than <b>indirect</b> <b>cooling,</b> due to the much higher temperature difference between the two fluid streams. When analysed in isolation the direct cooling NDDCT is found to over cool at both high and low inlet temperatures. The direct and indirect dry cooled recompression cycles were analysed at a range of ambient temperatures, using a coupled NDDCT and cycle model approach, in order to represent daily and annual variances. In both direct and indirect configurations, the cycle is overcooled at low ambient temperature, reducing cycle efficiency. A novel bypass arrangement was proposed that allows control of the compressor inlet temperature by reducing heat rejection from the tower, and allows both cycles to maintain peak efficiency at low ambient temperatures. At the design point ambient temperature of 20 °C the cycle efficiency is 49. 6 %. This is maintained down to 0 °C for both configurations, and drops to 44. 7 % and 43. 8 % at 50 °C ambient for direct and indirect respectively...|$|E

Electrical machines in such applications are usually designed with high power density requirements but within limited spaces, which lead to high rate of heat generation but low rate of heat dissipation. Therefore, highly efficient thermal design or cooling methods are needed Firstly, the thesis discusses different possible approaches to improve the thermal design of electrical machines, which by either decreasing heat generations or increasing heat dissipations. Among different options, direct cooling system is studied further and compared to <b>indirect</b> <b>cooling</b> system. In this study, three simulation approaches namely Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and Lumped Parameter Method (LPM) are applied to different calculation do mains with different purposes. The calculation domain of CFD simulation is selected for coolant, sometimes with limited volume of solid of electrical machines. The aims of CFD simulations in this study are: 1) rough comparisons on direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>cooling</b> systems 2) study of individual cooling channel and forming heat transfer coefficient maps. On the other hand, the calculated domain of FEA simulation is the whole machine, besides the coolant. The interfaces between the coolant and solid are set with boundary conditions which are heat transfer coefficients obtained by CFD simulations. The aim of FEA simulation {{in this study is}} to compare the heat transfer and differences between the direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>cooling</b> systems especially at the hot spots.

40|$|In the ultracold regime, {{where the}} {{interactions}} between atoms become quantum mechanical in nature, we can investigate the fundamental properties of matter. A natural progression from the catalogue of pioneering experiments using ultracold atoms is to extend {{the size of our}} quantum system by producing ultracold molecules in prescribed low-energy internal states. Techniques for cold molecule production are split into two methods: direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>cooling.</b> While direct cooling methods have yet to realize ultracold temperatures, collisional relaxation in the molecules leads to low internal energy states. By contrast, <b>indirect</b> <b>cooling</b> — the association of molecules from pre-cooled atoms—has produced a range of molecules at ultracold temperatures; the challenge with this technique is to control the internal state. This thesis concentrates on a technique that is complementary to those already in existence: ultrafast photoassociation. Key to this technique is the formation of time non-stationary wavepackets in the excited-state in order to improve FranckCondon overlap of the excited state with deeply bound ground-state vibrational levels. A pump-probe experiment was designed and built to demonstrate the formation of bound excited-state dimers. In this work we show that the initial state from which the wavepacket originates is of critical importance to the evolution of excited-state population. We find that the internuclear separation of the wavepacket produced in a rubidium magneto-optical trap is too large to observe coherent oscillations in the excited state. The implications of this are discussed along with recommendations for future ultrafast photoassociation experiments. Consequently, a new ultracold atom apparatus was built utilizing magnetic and dipole-force trapping to increase the density of the atomic sample; this apparatus will enable future experiments combining the exciting fields of ultracold matter and ultrafast light. </p...|$|E

40|$|For a given {{heat sink}} thermal {{resistance}} and ambient temperature, {{the temperature of}} an electronic device rises fairly linearly with increasing device heat flux. This relationship is especially problematic for defense electronics, where heat dissipation is projected to exceed 1000 W/cm 2 in the near future. Direct and indirect low-temperature refrigeration cooling facilitate appreciable reduction in the temperature of both coolant and device. This paper explores the benefits of cooling the device using direct and indirect refrigeration cooling systems. In the direct cooling system, a microchannel heat sink serves as an evaporator in a conventional vapor compression cycle using R 134 a as working fluid. In the <b>indirect</b> <b>cooling</b> system, HFE 7100 is used to cool the heat sink in a primary pumped liquid loop that rejects heat to a secondary refrigeration loop. Two drastically different flow behaviors are observed in these systems. Because of compressor performance constraints, mostly high void fraction two-phase patterns are encountered in the R 134 a system, dominated by saturated boiling. On the other hand, the indirect refrigeration cooling system facilitates highly subcooled boiling inside the heat sink. Both systems are shown to provide important cooling benefits, but the <b>indirect</b> <b>cooling</b> system is far more effective at dissipating high heat fluxes. Tests with this system yielded cooling heat fluxes as high as 840 W/cm 2 without incurring critical heat flux (CHF). Results from both systems are combined to construct an overall map of performance trends relative to mass velocity, subcooling, pressure, and surface tension. Extreme conditions of near-saturated flow, low mass velocity, and low pressure produce ldquomicrordquo behavior, where macrochannel flow pattern maps simply fail to apply, instabilities are prominent, and CHF is quite low. One the other hand, systems with high mass velocity, high subcooling, and high pressure are far more stable and y- - ield very high CHF values; two-phase flow in these systems follows the fluid flow and heat transfer behavior {{as well as the}} flow pattern maps of macrochannels. close...|$|E
