Departing from denominational practice for over 120 years, English language churches may now choose alternate Bible translations at these services (i.e. Phillips).|$|E

25|$|After {{receiving}} the Gunzo Award for his 1979 literary work Hear the Wind Sing, Murakami did not aspire {{to meet other}} writers. Aside from Sarah Lawrence's Mary Morris, whom he briefly mentions in his memoir What I Talk About When I Talk About Running alongside Joyce Carol Oates and Toni Morrison, Murakami was never {{a part of a}} community of writers, his reason being that he was a loner and was never fond of groups, schools, and literary circles. When working on a book, Murakami states that he relies on his wife, who is always his <b>first</b> <b>reader.</b> While he never acquainted himself with many writers, Murakami enjoys the works of Ryu Murakami and Banana Yoshimoto.|$|E

25|$|Churches {{worldwide}} hold {{a one-hour}} service each Sunday, consisting of hymns, prayer, and currently, readings from the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible (although {{there is no}} requirement that {{this version of the}} Bible be used) and Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures. These readings are the weekly Lesson-Sermon, which is read aloud at all Sunday services in all Christian Science churches worldwide, and is studied by individuals at home throughout the preceding week. The Lesson, as it is informally called, is compiled by a committee at The Mother Church, and is usually made up of six sections, each of which consists of passages from the Bible (read by the Second Reader) and passages from Science and Health (read by the <b>First</b> <b>Reader).</b>|$|E
500|$|Henneberger chose Edwin Baird, {{the editor}} of Detective Tales, to edit Weird Tales; Farnsworth Wright was <b>first</b> <b>reader,</b> and Otis Adelbert Kline also worked on the magazine, {{assisting}} Baird. [...] Payment rates were low, usually between a quarter and a half cent per word; the budget went up to one cent per word for the most popular writers. [...] Sales were initially poor, and Henneberger soon decided to change the format from the standard pulp size to large pulp, to make the magazine more visible. [...] This had little long-term effect on sales, though the first issue at the new size, dated May 1923, {{was the only one}} that first year to sell out completely—probably because it contained the first instalment of a popular serial, The Moon Terror, by A.G. Birch.|$|E
2500|$|Because {{there are}} no clergy in the church, branch church Sunday {{services}} are conducted by two Readers: the <b>First</b> <b>Reader,</b> who reads passages from Science and Health, and the Second Reader, who reads passages from the Bible. First Readers determine the beginning [...] "scriptural selection", hymns to be sung on Sundays, and the benediction. The {{vast majority of the}} service is the reading of the weekly Bible lesson supplied by Boston, and the order of the service set out by the Manual. To be elected the <b>First</b> <b>Reader</b> in one's branch church is one of the highest and most important positions the lay Christian Scientist may aspire to.|$|E

40|$|This master’s thesis in {{the field}} of library and {{information}} science deals with reviews written by <b>first</b> <b>readers,</b> to be considered by librarians in their selection process. My aim is to identify dislocations in relation to norms, with the help of two research questions: Which discursive dislocations can be seen in relation to norms concerning gender, sexuality, racialization {{on the one hand and}} literature, reading and the mediation of literature in a library context? Which positions are held by the <b>first</b> <b>readers</b> in relation to libraries and the public? Discourse analysis, as described by Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe, functions as theory and method. The material is <b>first</b> <b>reader’s</b> reviews written in 1928 and 2013. I identify the discourse in 1928 as occupied with enlightenment and in 2013 with individualism. In 1928, <b>first</b> <b>readers</b> and librarians function as gatekeepers. They judge literature based on quality, suitability and moral. Popular genres are seen as lacking in quality and not always suitable for the public. Sexual content is tied to lacking suitability and bad moral, which is not the case in 2013, when the discourse focuses primarily on the public readers’ demands and reading acts. Reading is now regarded as entertaining, rather than educational. In terms of racialization, “culture” in 2013 has the same function as “race” in 1928 – that is, to establish difference and exotism. Gender stereotypes are questioned in 2013, but also used. The gatekeeper roles of <b>first</b> <b>readers</b> and librarians are weakened, but they still hold positions of power...|$|R

6000|$|This was all I was to {{hear from}} his lips {{concerning}} the merits of [...] "Almayer's Folly." [...] We never spoke together of the book again. A long period of bad weather set in and I had no thoughts left but for my duties, while poor Jacques caught a fatal cold and had to keep close in his cabin. When we arrived in Adelaide the <b>first</b> <b>reader</b> of my prose went at once up-country, and died rather suddenly in the end, either in Australia {{or it may be}} on the passage while going home through the Suez Canal. I am not sure which it was now, and I do not think I ever heard precisely; though I made inquiries about him from some of our return passengers who, wandering about to [...] "see the country" [...] during the ship's stay in port, had come upon him here and there.

6000|$|In a pause I went {{on meeting}} instinctively the heavy rolling of the ship, and Jacques put his feet upon the couch.

It was in latitude 40 south, and nearly in the longitude of Greenwich, as far as I can remember, that these quiet rites of Almayer's and Nina's resurrection were taking place. In the prolonged silence it occurred to me that there was a good deal of retrospective writing in the story as far as it went. Was it intelligible in its action, I asked myself, as if already the story-teller were being born into the body of a seaman. But I heard on deck the whistle of the officer of the watch and remained on the alert to catch the order that was to follow this call to attention. It reached me as a faint, fierce shout to [...] "Square the yards." [...] "Aha!" [...] I thought to myself, [...] "a westerly blow coming on."
