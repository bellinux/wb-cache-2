25|$|Dravid {{concluded}} a successful stint with Kent aggregating 1221 runs from 16 first class matches(15 county games and 1 tour game against Zimbabwe) {{at an average}} of 55.50 including 2 hundreds and 8 fifties.

25|$|The liberal group, rallied from 1909 around Straucher's {{newspaper}} Die Volkswehr ("People's Defense"), {{was soon}} {{drawn into a}} fierce competition with socialist Jews, including not <b>just</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Bundistn, but also sympathizers of Poale Zion. The Kultusgemeinde was by then Straucher's prime basis of support in parliamentary elections, and, after the 1911 elections (during which he faced no opposition from Ebner's group), {{he was the only}} one among the four of his fellow candidates in the 1907 elections to maintain his seat. Of the latter, Arthur Mahler left the Jewish nationalist movement and returned to his career as an art historian.|$|E

The contemporary accounts mostly deal <b>just</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> architecture and only mention 'various kinds of fruit-bearing trees and rare aromatic herbs' in relation to the garden. Cypress trees are almost certainly to have been planted being popular similes in Persian poetry for the slender elegant stature of the beloved. By the end of the 18th century, Thomas Twining noted orange trees and a large plan of the complex suggests beds of various other fruits such as pineapples, pomegranates, bananas, limes and apples. The British, {{at the end of the}} 19th century thinned out a lot of the increasingly forested trees, replanted the cypresses and laid the gardens to lawns in their own taste.|$|E

He was only allowed back into the team when {{they ran out of}} central defenders due to injuries and suspensions. The Flamengo fans had always supported Bahia even in these darker days at the club. In his final match for the club he scored two goals against Cruzeiro. The goals were important because Flamengo was in relegation trouble and due to these goals the club remained in the Campeonato Brasileiro Série A.|$|E
25|$|The largest {{departure}} made by Galactic Civilizations II {{from other}} 4X games is its economic system, {{which is very}} different from the systems used in most strategy games. Typically, 4X strategy games receive money based on a tax rate or based on the income of specific tiles in use by a city or planet. Civilization IV uses this system, and most other 4X strategy games use a variant of it. These incomes are increased by economic structures and sometimes by population, and the profit made off this economic income is used to pay maintenance fees and rush-build units. Galactic Civilizations II adds another layer of complexity by requiring that the income of an empire is used to pay for all forms of production. In order to produce one unit of product, be it research or manufacturing, the player must pay credits (usually in denominations of a Billion Credits, or BC). It is therefore critical that the player balances the economic income of their empire with their industrial output, and not <b>just</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> maintenance of their empire. If the player does not have the economy required to support an industrial planet, then they will have to spend at a deficit, and if the player does not correct their economy, they will eventually go broke. This stands in stark contrast to the Civilization series, where industrial output has nothing to do with the player's economic income.|$|E

It {{features}} {{plain white}} shorts and a plain white shirt featuring an embossed St. George's Cross pattern on the chest and upper back. The crest is 3D injection moulded on a raised pouch, and a new redesigned deconstructed neckline. [...] The current alternative kit is dark sapphire and features the same embossed St. George's Cross but in red, Shorts are also dark sapphire. Home socks are midnight blue with a white top and this is reversed for the alternative socks. In 2013-14, the strip featured plain white shorts and a plain white shirt, but with an added black stripe on each sleeve. The alternative kit had a red and white striped shirt, with blue shorts.In 2014/15, the home shirt was white, with a [...] "V-Neck" [...] around the collar. The kit also had little Victoria Crosses on the main chest. It also had the O2 sponsorship marking on the chest. The shorts were plain white with the sponsorship marking on them. The socks were dark blue and had a white stripe at the top. The alternate shirt was exactly the same but was red instead of white. The shorts were navy blue and the socks were red with a white stripe on top. The 2015/16 strip was similar but didn't have the small crosses on the shirt. The Canterbury logo was straight and not diagonal it had white lines going horizontally across the chest. For the 2015 Rugby World Cup, the kit remained the same <b>just</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Rugby World Cup logo {{on the right and}} no O2 logo in the centre. For the home strip, the shorts and socks remained the same. The away 2015/16 strip and World Cup strip was red, with dark red and maroon sleeves.
