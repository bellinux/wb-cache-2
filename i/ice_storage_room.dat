5000|$|The Ice House is a {{historic}} commercial building in Moulton, Alabama. It was built in 1946 {{at the beginning of}} Moulton's post-World War II boom period. After the town's previous ice house on the courthouse square was demolished to make way for new construction, R. W. Carter built a new ice house one block from the square with state-of-the-art ice making equipment. The ice house operated until 1977, serving homes and businesses in and around Moulton, as well as customers including Legion Field in Birmingham and the Browns Ferry Nuclear Power Plant across the Tennessee River. Today, the building houses an antique store, but the icemaking equipment is still intact. The building is a one-story, concrete block structure with a parapet roof. The façade has three original wood doors which originally enclosed the <b>ice</b> <b>storage</b> <b>rooms,</b> an entry door, and a window, all under a flat canopy. An office with two windows also projects from the façade. A concrete block residence constructed {{at the same time as}} the ice house sits behind the structure. [...] The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.|$|R
40|$|This article {{experimentally}} {{investigates the}} thermal {{performance of a}} heat pump system with an <b>ice</b> <b>storage</b> subcooler. The system supplies heating and cooling demands to two greenhouses with temperature ranging 308 similar to 323 K and 273 similar to 291 K respectively and utilizes an <b>ice</b> <b>storage</b> tank to subcool the condensed refrigerant, which can enhance the system coefficient of performance (COP). The <b>ice</b> <b>storage</b> tank charges for storing ice, when the cooling load {{is less than the}} nominal cooling capacity. While the cooling load is larger than the nominal cooling capacity, the <b>ice</b> <b>storage</b> tank discharges for subcooling.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} hybrid {{algorithm}} {{to solve the}} optimal energy dispatch of an <b>ice</b> <b>storage</b> air-conditioning system. Based on a real air-conditioning system, the data, including the return temperature of chilled water, the supply temperature of chilled water, the return temperature of <b>ice</b> <b>storage</b> water, and the supply temperature of <b>ice</b> <b>storage</b> water, are measured. The least-squares regression (LSR) is used to obtain the input-output (I/O) curve for the cooling load and power consumption of chillers and <b>ice</b> <b>storage</b> tank. The objective is to minimize overall cost in a daily schedule while satisfying all constraints, including cooling loading under the time-of-use (TOU) rate. Based on the Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN) and Ant Colony Optimization, an Ant-Based Radial Basis Function Network (ARBFN) is constructed in the searching process.

Significant differences in moisture and temperature between the two storage systems were not observed. The hardness of cabbages and Japanese radish among examined vegetables tended to be held in the <b>storage</b> <b>room</b> cooled by snow. The decrease of the moisture level of Japanese cabbages, cabbages and carrot was slightly inhibited in the <b>storage</b> <b>room</b> of cooled by snow. The vitamin C level of Japanese radishes and tomatoes tended to be held in the <b>storage</b> <b>room</b> cooled by snow compared to the electric refrigerator. The sugar levels of Japanese cabbages, cabbages, and Japanese radishes was same in the two storage systems.

The schedule planning for an <b>ice</b> <b>storage</b> air-conditioning system of demand response is mainly to transfer energy consumption from the peak load to the partial-peak or off-peak load. Least Squares Regression (LSR) is used to obtain the polynomial function for the cooling capacity {{and the cost of}} power consumption with a real <b>ice</b> <b>storage</b> air-conditioning system. Based on the dynamic electricity pricing, the requirements of cooling loads, and all technical constraints, the dispatch model of the ice-storage air-conditioning system is formulated to minimize the operation cost.

40|$|With the {{development}} of social economy, the electricity consumption by air conditioning increases unceasingly. Even the electricity peak due to the air conditioning is often {{at the same time}} with the industry trade peak, which worsen creates the peak electric power resources shortage, and the electricity difference between on-peak hours and off-peak hours is becoming larger. The ice-storage air conditioning system, as a powerful technology of balancing electric loads from on-peak hours, has the great significance to the electric network. The dynamic <b>ice</b> cold <b>storage</b> technique is the important research direction of the <b>ice</b> <b>storage</b> air conditioning system, In order to obtain guidelines for engineering applications, experiments were conducted using the dynamic <b>ice</b> cold <b>storage</b> air conditioning system developed by Guangzhou Institute of Energy Conversion,and the paper mainly focused on the following aspects; 1) The influences of different initial cool thermal storage rate, different cooling load of end-users, different discharge water flow rate and different ice-melting velocity on the discharging characteristics were analyzed in detail, the results show that the ice-melting velocity {{plays an important role in}} discharging characteristics, and initial cool thermal storage rate, discharge water flow rate and cooling load of end-users have little effect on the discharging characteristics. 2) In order to get the optimum pipeline designs in <b>ice</b> <b>storage</b> tank during the ice charging process, several ice-melting experiments were conducted. The results show that there exists an optimum pipeline arrangement in the discharging process considering ice discharging efficiency, and the output water of the <b>ice</b> <b>storage</b> tank has little effect on the velocity of ice-melting. 3) The influence on the discharging efficiency of the velocity field in the <b>ice</b> <b>storage</b> tank produced by the input water and output water was analyzed.

40|$|MIng (Mechanical Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 The South African gold {{mining sector}} consumes 47 % of the mining industry’s electricity. On a deep level gold mine, 20 % {{of the energy}} is {{consumed}} by the refrigeration system. The refrigeration system cools 67 ˚C virgin rock temperatures underground. Underground cooling demand increases significantly with deeper mining activities. Various cooling systems are available for underground cooling. This study focuses on the electricity usage of an <b>ice</b> <b>storage</b> system versus a chilled water system for underground cooling. An energy-savings approach was developed to determine possible power savings on the surface refrigeration system of Mine M. The savings approach involved converting an <b>ice</b> <b>storage</b> system to a chilled water system and varying the water flow through the system. The water flow was varied by installing variable speed drives on the evaporator and condenser water pumps. The feasibility of the energy-efficiency approach was simulated with a verified simulation model. Simulation results indicated the feasibility of converting the thermal <b>ice</b> <b>storage</b> to a chilled water system and implementing the energy-efficiency approach on Mine M. Simulated results indicated a 9 % electricity saving when using a chilled water system. Various problems encountered by the mine were also a motivation to convert the thermal <b>ice</b> <b>storage</b> system. Converting an <b>ice</b> <b>storage</b> facility to a chilled water system for energy efficiency on a deep level gold mine Energy management is achieved through the monitoring, controlling and reporting of the implemented savings approach.

40|$|AbstractAmong {{researchers}} worldwide, {{the combination}} of preservation methods aimed to achieve improved effects on microbial inactivation of seafood products {{is an area of}} research receiving increasing interest. Globally also, the demand for high quality minimally processed food products are on the increase. Ozone treatment, three decade – long declared ‘Generally Recognized As Safe’ and approved as food contact sanitizing agent has evolved up to recent times where it assumes the likes of domestic food-processing facilities manufactured with environment-friendly status ensuring consumer safety. On the other hand, the subject of inactivation kinetics of seafood microorganisms following ozone treatment is still under debate. Furthermore, kinetic models remain the economical and quick approach to predict the preservation parameters. Nevertheless, there is paucity of information regards aerobic microbial inactivation of crustacean product arising from fixed minimal ozone discharge. Is the phenomenon of aerobic microbial inactivation kinetics of shrimp product subject to a fixed minimal ozone discharge during <b>iced</b> <b>storage</b> a fact or fib? To answer this, the aerobic microbial inactivation kinetics of shrimp during <b>iced</b> <b>storage</b> of up to 11 days was inspected. The process conditions comprised of a fixed ozone concentration of 100 mg/h minimally discharged at wash time of 1 min as well as <b>iced</b> <b>storage</b> of up to 11 days. Minimal ozone treatment was applied either prior to or during <b>iced</b> <b>storage</b> situations. Aerobic microbial inactivation presented significant effects during <b>iced</b> <b>storage</b> (P< 0. 05). Line of fit that could best describe the aerobic microbial inactivation kinetics showed adequacy only at the fourth order of storage time ‘x’ variable, which could only but account for between 75 - 96 % of explained variance. Overall, aerobic microbial inactivation kinetics of shrimp using a fixed minimal ozone discharge appears quantitatively possible even though it decreases as <b>iced</b> <b>storage</b> progresses...|$|R
