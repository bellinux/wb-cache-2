25|$|Franck and Hertz {{noted in}} their first paper that the 4.9 eV {{characteristic}} energy of their experiment corresponded well {{to one of the}} wavelengths of light emitted by mercury atoms in gas discharges. They were using a quantum relationship between the energy of excitation and the corresponding wavelength of light, which they broadly attributed to Johannes Stark and to Arnold Sommerfeld; it predicts that 4.9 eV corresponds to light with a 254nm wavelength. The same relationship was also incorporated in Einstein's 1905 photon theory of the photoelectric effect. In a second paper, Franck and Hertz reported the optical emission from their tubes, which emitted light with a single prominent wavelength 254nm. The figure at the right shows the spectrum of a Franck–Hertz tube; nearly all of the light emitted has a single wavelength. For reference, the figure also shows the spectrum for a mercury <b>gas</b> <b>discharge</b> light, which emits light at several wavelengths besides 254nm. The figure is based on the original spectra published by Franck and Hertz in 1914. The fact that the Franck–Hertz tube emitted just the single wavelength, corresponding nearly exactly to the voltage period they had measured, was very important.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "emission mix" [...] on {{the lamp}} filaments/cathodes is {{required}} to enable electrons to pass into the gas via thermionic emission at the lamp operating voltages used. The mix is slowly sputtered off by bombardment with electrons and mercury ions during operation, but a larger amount is sputtered off each time the lamp is started with cold cathodes. The method of starting the lamp has {{a significant impact on}} this. Lamps operated for typically less than 3 hours each switch-on will normally run out of the emission mix before other parts of the lamp fail. The sputtered emission mix forms the dark marks at the lamp ends seen in old lamps. When all the emission mix is gone, the cathode cannot pass sufficient electrons into the gas fill to maintain the <b>gas</b> <b>discharge</b> at the designed lamp operating voltage. Ideally, the control gear should shut down the lamp when this happens. However, some control gear will provide sufficient increased voltage to continue operating the lamp in cold cathode mode, which will cause overheating of the lamp end and rapid disintegration of the electrodes (filament goes open-circuit) and filament support wires until they are completely gone or the glass cracks, destroying the low pressure gas fill and stopping the <b>gas</b> <b>discharge.</b>|$|E
