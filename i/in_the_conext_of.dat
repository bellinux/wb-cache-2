40|$|This chapter was {{commissioned}} for the CUP “In Context” series by {{the editor of}} the T. S. Eliot volume. While providing an overview of T. S. Eliot’s creative and critical responses to Dante, it highlights Eliot’s background reading in Dante scholarship and his contacts with scholars like Mario Praz. The 1929 Dante pamphlet is placed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>conext</b> <b>of</b> the Rappel à l’Ordre, as suggested by its original epigraph from Charles Maurras. A comparison of the use of Dante in Little Gidding and in Ezra Pound’s nearly contemporary Canto 72 reveals Eliot’s "detachment from current events" even at the height of World War II. Eliot’s work can be read as a Dantesque pilgrimage that never reaches a Paradiso. But in Four Quartets he "present[s] the sober wisdom of age in a language that aspires to the universality of Dante’s Italian" (p. 188).

40|$|The {{dissertation}} examines art as a very specific luxury commodity that {{is difficult}} to define and place on a market. The objectively given uncertainty of an art market {{does not seem to be}} consistent with the investment function of an artwork. The price of this product is unstable and non transparent and it is generally formed through a marketing tool - a commercial art fair. The main aim of this dissertation is to uncover the specifics of the fine art market. The secondary objective is to determine how emerging art from the Czech Republic is represented on a global scale. The research method included expert opinions from interviews as well as statistical processing of survey answers from several different professions. The main outcome of this research found out expert opinions from prominent art institutions around the world, and their awareness of Czech contemporary art. The beneficial factor of this research is the recommendation for Czech artists and commercial galleries to penetrate the global market. Beside the practical benefits there are additional benefits for science, as the information and research is taken from different fields, which is not so sufficiently monitored or presented as well in the Czech Republic. The focus on the pedagogical benefits are evident as the author has paid much attention to these issues for several years <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>conext</b> <b>of</b> regular lectures on the art of marketing at the University of Economics in Prague...|$|E
40|$|M. A. Shyness is an {{individual}} difference variable {{that has the potential}} to impact on the processes that facilitate the development of emotional intimacy. There has been little research that has focussed on shyness within <b>the</b> <b>conext</b> <b>of</b> close relationships, providing an opportunity for further research. Reis and Shaver (1988) and Reis and Patrick (1996) described the interpersonal process model of intimacy, which provides comprehensive and integrated model from which to examine emotional intimacy. The model is supported by research within the field of interpersonal relationship studies. Emotional intimacy is believed to experienced as a subjective sense of connectedness, which is the outcome of an interpersonal, transactional and dynamic process that consists of self-disclosure and partner responsiveness. The model incoporates the notion that individual difference variable can interfere with the development of emotional intimacy as the level of these processes of self-disclosure and partner responsiveness...|$|R

40|$|Our {{study shows}} the {{awareness}} {{and application of}} the concept of  human rights (understood as patient rights) in a hospital environment. We sought to determine whether such rights are respected, soliciting the opinion of patients and as to how it acts as a measure for whether service delivery is wholly effective <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>conext</b> <b>of</b> the clinician-patient relation. Our research was undertaken to signal a contemporary need in service delivery: health personnel involved in the delivery of surgical services have much to learn from the practical applications of human rights principles and the essential role they must fulfill in research and advocacy in order to improve the availability of surgical care globally. Human rights, medical ethics and empathy are parallel mechanisms working {{at the level of the}} patient-clinician relationship. This, in general, can influence the quality of care and communication for the better. Our study was conducted in 2011 and lasted 6 months. The research sites were the public hospitals located in the Kujavian-Pomeranian region of Poland. There were  two classes of hospitals: the first, had more than 400 beds (Group I) and the second one: above 400 beds (Group II). We solicted the opinion of 180 patients who had undergone laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The main planned outcome (hypothesis zero) of the study was that there were no differences between the two Groups of hospitals, and therefore no substantial variance in service delivery.

40|$|It's a great {{pleasure}} to welcome everyone to ACM <b>CoNEXT</b> 2007 - <b>the</b> 3 rd International Conference on emerging Networking EXperiments and Technologies (<b>CoNEXT).</b> With <b>the</b> first two <b>CoNEXT</b> conferences having been held in Toulouse and Lisbon and being founded as a merger of four existing EU workshops, CoNEXT has its roots in Europe. However, this year's CoNEXT is being held on the campus of Columbia University in beautiful and exciting New York City a locale that rivals <b>the</b> finest cities <b>in</b> Europe, and which emphasizes the global nature <b>of</b> both <b>CoNEXT</b> and our networking research community. We hope that this conference facilitates a stimulating exchange of ideas among many of the members of our international research community. After Toulouse in 2005 and Lisbon <b>in</b> 2006, <b>the</b> 2007 edition of the Conference on emerging Networking EXperiments and Technologies (<b>CoNEXT)</b> has crossed <b>the</b> Atlantic Ocean to be held in New York, NY, USA. This year, 138 high quality papers were submitted to the conference. We received papers written by authors from 29 different countries and covering a broad and diverse set of topics. Given the high quality of the submissions, selecting a program was both easy and challenging, as we had a plethora of worthy candidates but could not accept them all. The selection process was extensive and thorough and proceeded in three rounds during which all papers received at least three reviews, and often more. The first round of the review process took place over the summer shortly after the submission deadline, at which time three TPC members were assigned to each paper. As one <b>of</b> <b>CoNEXT's</b> major objectives is to provide fair and accurate evaluations, TPC members were asked to review papers themselves (no delegation was allowed) and encouraged to provide detailed feedback to the authors. Each review was then cross-checked by the program chairs and a "sanity checker", who was a TPC member not among the original reviewers. The sanity check quickly assessed reviews for fairness and completeness. Based on the evaluations produced by this first round, the Program Chairs selected 84 papers for the second round that started in early September. During the second round, the TPC members assigned to each paper read the other reviewer's opinions and debated the relative merits of the paper. The outcome of this discussion was either a unanimous recommendation on how to classify <b>the</b> paper <b>in</b> preparation for <b>the</b> TPC meeting, or a disagreement in which case additional reviews were requested inside and outside the TPC. Papers for which agreement could be reached were assigned to one of three categories: "accept", "discuss", and "reject". Papers for which no agreement was reached were assigned to the "discuss" category pending the completion of the additional reviews that were requested. The bulk of <b>the</b> papers landed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> "discuss" category, with only a handful of papers accepted up-front, and the remainder of the papers being viewed as not yet ready for publication. The third round of the selection process was the TPC meeting itself, which was held in Philadelphia with TPC members either physically present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> room or participating through audio-conference. The bulk of the meeting was spent individually evaluating papers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> "discuss" category and ranking them as either above or below an "accept" threshold based on the calibration that emerged from the discussion phase. At the end of the day, we had identified 28 high quality papers that were selected for presentation at CoNEXT' 07. <b>The</b> papers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> conference proceedings have been revised by the authors to account for the reviewers' comments and suggestions. The papers are organized in eight sessions that illustrate the breadth of topics that currently make up the field of networking, with not only papers on wireless, mesh, ad hoc and delay tolerant networks, but also papers proposing new architecture or techniques to better engineer or model networks and improve communication efficiency. <b>In</b> addition, <b>the</b> ever-present aspect of security, resiliency and economical issues also found their place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> program. The CoNEXT' 07 best paper award goes to the paper entitled "The Diameter of Opportunistic Mobile Networks," coauthored by A. Chaintreau, A. Mtibaa, L. Massoulie, and C. Diot from Thomson Paris Research Lab. The paper was unanimously selected from a highly competitive field by a committee consisting of three TPC members, who praised its combination of analysis and experimental validation. As in 2006, CoNEXT' 07 also awarded the "CoNEXT rising star award", which this year goes to Ion Stoica from the University of California at Berkeley. Ion was selected in recognition for outstanding research contributions early in his career on advances in Internet architecture, overlay networks and practical distributed systems. Ion will be giving <b>the</b> <b>CoNEXT</b> keynote talk <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first session of the conference. Please join us in congratulating Ion for this remarkable achievement. <b>In</b> addition to <b>the</b> technical program, Suman Banerjee, Roger Karrer and Ashwin Sridharan have organized a wonderful workshop for students.

40|$|Archaeological {{ceramics}} {{are mostly}} used in dating archaeological layers, but this presupposes {{that they should}} be able to tell us how and why cultural continuity or change occurs. For my research, I focus on the standardization and variability of pottery because these concepts indicate causes for change, continuity and an understanding of learning patterns and mechanisms. I concretize the role of pottery workshops in continuity and change in an archaeological context and approach transmission through Bourdieu's 'habitus', focusing on the interactions between the individual and the group. The group represents a community of practice (e. g. a pottery workshop) transmitting a certain tradition through teaching and learning. Apprenticeship in these workshops conveys these traditions within a broader process of enculturation. The workshop and the individual potters within it have a recognizable signature, which can be traced metrically. Using an anthropological approach, I concentrate on modern-day pottery workshops in Egypt and India with long traditions in pottery manufacturing for four main reasons: Firstly, interacting with present day living and working potters allows me to to ask questions to understand the role of learning by potters, the identification of a producer's work and the influence of consumers on learning and processes of continuity and change. Secondly, it allows me to observe actions and processes within main stages of pottery manufacture relating to similar vessels. This in turn enables me to trace subtle micro-variables <b>in</b> <b>the</b> actions of present day production processes (such as body movements and specific gestures) using video footage as well as the traces these actions leave on vessels. Lastly, I conduct experiments to demonstrate that transfer of knowledge/skill/learning can be detected through archaeological ceramics by comparing measurable characteristics in ancient and modern pottery. For implementing reason, <b>the</b> variations <b>in</b> movements and gestures from the video recordings were color coded using Anvil (qualitative data analysis and research software) in order to discern the patterning associated with each stage in pottery production of similar vessels. Once coded, the data is subjected to quantitative analysis. The method outlined above allows me to demonstrate that individuals from one workshop follow similar actions and leave similar traces on vessels when compared to individuals from another workshop. It also enables me to differentiate between workshops manufacturing similar vessels by body movements and usage of space. There are a total of eight supplementary files relating to video annotation from workshops located in both Egypt and India (provided with the thesis). I then transpose the method and understanding gained from the study of modern potters to the archaeological context. The essential component is that <b>in</b> both <b>the</b> present day and ancient <b>conext,</b> <b>the</b> study focuses on similar vessels. This is necessary to discern actions and processes that are a part of the chaîne opératoire through different approaches such as visual and chemical analysis, measurement of dimensions such as rim thickness, rim diameter and neck/wall thickness of vessels. This enables the definition of similarities and differences within and between pottery workshops to aid in understanding knowledge and transmission at ancient Karanis. My research suggests that by adopting a research design tested <b>in</b> <b>the</b> present and applied to archaeological ceramics <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past, one can trace ancient communities of practice and interpret continuity or change in material culture as part of an ongoing learning tradition...|$|R
