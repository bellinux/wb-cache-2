In an attempt to give the cathedral a slimmer appearance, Zettervall significantly altered large portions of the medieval outer brick walls and removed the decorative white-washed ‘blind windows’ on the gables which had been similar to those on the nearby Holy Trinity Church.|$|E

25|$|Traditional folk music, {{having been}} in a slow decline from {{mainstream}} popularity since the 1970s, began to enjoy a resurgence in the 1990s, benefiting from the more general interest in World music. The arrival, and sometimes mainstream success, of acts like Kate Rusby, Nancy Kerr, Kathryn Tickell, Spiers and Boden, Seth Lakeman, Eliza Carthy, Runrig and Capercaillie, all largely concerned with acoustic performance of traditional material, marked a radical turn around in the fortunes of British folk music.

25|$|Overall, between 1960 and 1989, {{the growth}} rate of per capita income in the Soviet Union was {{slightly}} above the world average (based on 102 countries).

By their calculation, per capita income of Soviet Union in 1989 should have been twice as <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was considering the amount of investment, education and population. The authors attribute this poor performance to low productivity of capital in the Soviet Union. Steven Rosenfielde states that the standard of living actually declined as a result of Stalin's despotism, and while there was a brief improvement following his death, lapsed into stagnation.|$|E

25|$|Workers {{must pay}} 12.4 percent, {{including}} a 6.2 percent employer contribution, on their wages below the Social Security Wage Base ($110,100 in 2012), but no {{tax on income}} in excess of this amount. Therefore, high earners pay a lower percentage of their total income because of the income caps; because of this, and the fact there is no tax on unearned income, social security taxes are often viewed as being regressive. However, benefits are adjusted to be significantly more progressive, even when accounting for differences in life expectancy. According to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, {{for people in the}} bottom fifth of the earnings distribution, the ratio of benefits to taxes is almost three times as <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> is for those in the top fifth.|$|E
25|$|The Red Army was {{substantially}} motorized from 1939–1941 {{but lost}} most of its war equipment in Operation Barbarossa. These losses were temporarily remedied by forming masses of mounted infantry which were used as strike forces in the Battle of Moscow. Heavy casualties and a shortage of horses soon compelled the Soviets {{to reduce the number}} of cavalry divisions. As tank production and Allied supplies made up for the losses of 1941, the cavalry was merged with tank units, forming more effective strike groups. From 1943–1944, cavalry gradually became the mobile infantry component of the tank armies. By the end of the war, Soviet cavalry was reduced to its pre-war strength. The logistical role of horses in the Red Army was not as <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was in the German Army due to Soviet domestic oil reserves and American truck supplies.|$|E
25|$|The {{attack on}} Cristot {{had been planned}} {{according}} to the January 1944, 21st Army Group infantry-tank theory, in which an attack was {{to be made in}} waves, with tanks followed by infantry and then more tanks. Experience showed that in close country, tanks must attack {{side by side with the}} infantry and even then, casualties for tanks and infantry would be <b>high,</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was extremely difficult for tanks to watch accompanying infantry. The attempts by XXX Corps to advance round the open German flank at Caumont and the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division to capture high ground around Le Mesnil-Patry, with tank forces supported by infantry rather than vice versa, were not tried again until Operation Goodwood. Having experienced similar losses to those of the 12th SS-Panzer Division during the first few days, the Anglo-Canadians began to accumulate resources to conduct set-piece attrition attacks. German attacks had similar results; the 12th SS-Panzer Division operation order of 7 June, required the division to throw the Allies into the sea but the attempt was a costly failure. The Germans changed tactics and began to limit counter-attacks to restore a defence in depth, rather than continue the failed counter-offensive against the invasion.|$|E

Stereotypes of drunkenness may be based on racism or xenophobia, as in the fictional depiction of the Irish as heavy drinkers. Studies by social psychologists Stivers and Greeley attempt to document the perceived prevalence of high alcohol consumption amongst the Irish in America. Alcohol consumption is relatively similar between many European cultures, the United States, and Australia. In Asian countries that have a high gross domestic product, there is heightened drinking compared to other Asian countries, but it is nowhere near as <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> is in other countries like the United States. It is also inversely seen, with countries that have very low gross domestic product showing high alcohol consumption.

Another reference point was art from the Halo first-person shooters; however, as the art was from a forward perspective and Halo Wars takes place from a bird's-eye view, the team exaggerated shapes to make the units recognizable. Lead designer Graeme Devine noted that the Warthog Jeep is [...] "actually jumping three times as <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> does in Halo, and it goes four times faster than it does in Halo, and all these things—but it looks the same. Very different, between look and accuracy." [...] To ensure artistic continuity between Halo Wars and previous games in the series, Ensemble created a set of guidelines for their artists to follow; for example, the Covenant were to retain their curvy, organic look, while the Forerunner and UNSC were to keep the same geometry angles. UNSC structures and units were given a green tint, with gold specular highlights. The Covenant were textured with a repeating honeycomb pattern, with small blue lights against a purple base color.|$|E
