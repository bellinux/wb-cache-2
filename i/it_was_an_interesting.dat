5|$|The episode's script {{went through}} several {{different}} versions before a final plot was decided upon, as Morgan and Wong believed the series {{would not be}} renewed for a third season and wished to write a suitable ending. The decision to kill off the character of Catherine Black {{was based on a}} suggestion by Chris Carter, the series' creator. Morgan and Wong discussed the idea with actress Megan Gallagher, who felt that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> decision to have Catherine give her life after seeing Frank Black sacrifice so much for their family throughout the previous episodes. The idea of depicting an apocalyptic scenario as being the result of a virus came from Morgan's research into possible end-of-the-world scenarios, and was influenced by the outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in the United Kingdom.|$|E
25|$|The {{departure}} from Melbourne – {{just one year}} into a three-year deal with the club – {{was the end of}} a tumultuous period for Gleeson, who had been supporting his wife through a successful battle with breast cancer. Gleeson was left emotionally drained and on the lookout for his next professional challenge. For a time he found that challenge elsewhere, working with the Australian Football League's North Melbourne and Hawthorn football clubs as a skills coach during 2012–13. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> change of scenery and, in many ways, a year of growth for Gleeson. Under masterful coach Alastair Clarkson, Hawthorn was on the precipice of a golden era of premiership success and it was there that Gleeson learned some of the key elements of his current coaching philosophy. He learnt the importance of core sporting-team principles such as empowering players to lead a team's culture and standards.|$|E

At the end of [...] "Christmas Special", Jack and Colleen sing a duet of [...] "The Christmas Song". In regards to the duet, Stritch told TV Guide: [...] "It's [...] fantasy. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> acting challenge. I didn't sing it like I sing it; I sang it like I imagined Colleen Donaghy would try to sing it." ...|$|E

She derided her choreography skills, and elaborated: [...] "I was so nervous that day. I had to keep eating bread and toast because my stomach was so sick. But <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> experience. It was definitely a challenge for me. Of course if they ask {{me to do it}} again, I would do it again.

500|$|The film's {{effects were}} conflictingly appraised. Schickel {{wrote that the}} effects were [...] "technically adroit" [...] and {{occasionally}} [...] "witty", and Ebert singled out the Bird of Prey as a [...] "great-looking" [...] ship. Sterritt felt that the settings always {{felt like they were}} on soundstages rather than out in space, and Denby wrote that more could have been done with Genesis, and that while <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> concept its special effects execution was lacking. Kempley appreciated the sets' low values, writing that [...] "the fakier the sets", the closer the film felt to its television origins.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Phoebe Green was {{considered as a}} recurring role, but this episode ended up being her only appearance. Chris Carter explained the character's origins, saying [...] "I thought {{it was interesting to}} show a little bit of Mulder's history by bringing an old girlfriend back. I've always wanted to do a Scotland Yard detective who was a woman. I also thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> chance to use Amanda Pays and make a villainess of her". Executive producer Robert Goodwin felt that the episode [...] "was a hard one. Any kind of a fire stunt is a major undertaking, because it involves so many overlapping things. It was a major feat, a real logical and creative feat, because you wanted it to look good".|$|E

500|$|Rippy {{used the}} Audiokinetic Wwise {{pipeline}} to create dynamic music that changes with {{the action in}} the game. Although Rippy used Wwise's tools only for dynamic music, they made audio system setup much easier than in previous Ensemble games. For each battle sequence, the musical cue was divided into sections and mixed differently for each section. [...] "When a cue is triggered, an intro plays and then the game randomly picks between all of those elements {{for as long as}} the battle continues," [...] Rippy explained. [...] "Once it's over, an outro plays and then it's back to the regular [...] "world" [...] music. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> way to work, and I'd like to push it further if there's an opportunity in the future." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{developing}} new characters {{for the sixth}} season of Desperate Housewives, showrunner Marc Cherry and his writing staff aimed to create a housewife who would {{be different from the}} other female characters on the series. Cherry stated that he [...] "wanted someone who didn't seem suburban, who has a tough, blue-collar exterior." [...] The staff ultimately decided upon an Italian New Yorker. Cherry stated that part of his inspiration for the character came from his childhood neighbors. He explained, [...] "When I was growing up in Huntington, Calif., two Italian families from the Bronx moved in across the street. We were so WASPy, so middle American. They had their own ethnic identity. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> juxtaposition." [...] Cherry insisted that Angie was not replacing the deceased Edie Britt character (Nicollette Sheridan) as a main housewife but would instead be the focus of the season's mystery.|$|E
500|$|Some {{commentators}} {{were less}} {{enthusiastic about the}} episode than the general consensus. Although Josh Wigler of MTV declared [...] "TS-19" [...] a [...] "compelling hour", he professed that it was lacking for a season finale. [...] "While there was a massive fireball and a decent amount of zombie action," [...] explained Wigler, [...] "not to mention some concrete information regarding the outbreak, there are still several plot threads that haven't come close to resolution." [...] Vanity Fair Mike Ryan argued that {{in contrast to a}} [...] "great season", the episode was a mediocre conclusion to The Walking Dead first season, writing that [...] "this might have been the silliest hour of television that I've ever watched". Leonard Pierce of The A.V. Club issued [...] "TS-19" [...] a B– grade: despite proclaiming that [...] "there was some good stuff" [...] in the episode, Pierce opined that it fell below his expectations. He denounced many scenes in the episode—notably the explosion sequence—as he felt it was a waste of cinematography. [...] "The fact that almost all the scenes played out in dark, closed quarters wasted The Walking Dead gorgeous cinematography; the pacing was again off beat, with far too much padded scenes of people looking at one another in shock; and, though I'm usually not bothered by plot contrivances, there's no way anyone in a vehicle that close to such a huge explosion would have lived through it." [...] Writing for Cinema Blend, Nick Venable said that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> episode, although it could have been executed in a better manner.|$|E

2500|$|The first French {{publication}} of The Second Sex sold around 22,000 copies in a week. It {{has since been}} translated into 40 languages. The Vatican placed the book on its List of Prohibited Books. The sex researcher Alfred Kinsey was critical of The Second Sex, holding that while <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> literary production, it contained no original data of interest or importance to science. In 1960, Beauvoir wrote that The Second Sex {{was an attempt to}} explain [...] "why a woman's situation, still, even today, prevents her from exploring the world's basic problems." [...] The attack on psychoanalysis in The Second Sex helped to inspire subsequent feminist arguments against psychoanalysis, including those of Betty Friedan's The Feminine Mystique (1963), Kate Millett's Sexual Politics (1969), and Germaine Greer's The Female Eunuch (1970). Millett commented in 1989 that she did not realize the extent to which she was indebted to Beauvoir when she wrote Sexual Politics.|$|E
2500|$|As Daniel bonded {{with his}} uncle, Paul {{invited him to}} move into his {{penthouse}} apartment. They clashed a little, due to Daniel's different outlook on life. He values relationships over material possessions, which is an odd concept to Paul. Daniel also picked up some shifts in Paul's hotel, but Phillipps pointed {{out that it was}} to keep his uncle happy. Daniel found the job too restricting to stay there forever. Phillipps has said that he enjoyed working with Dennis again, following their previous storyline together in 2007. He thought that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> piece of writing, saying that if Paul was going to imagine someone, it makes sense that the guy looks like his nephew. When Paul suffered a public meltdown due to his grief over Kate's death, Daniel was there to comfort him while he broke down. However, the situation proved too much for Daniel and he had to call in Karl Kennedy (Alan Fletcher), hoping that his uncle would receive the medical and psychological help he needed. Phillipps later said that helping Paul was [...] "a pretty tough ask" [...] for Daniel and while he thinks of himself as kind of therapist to people, the situation was [...] "pretty extreme". Phillipps added that the storyline presented [...] "an interesting dynamic" [...] for the pair.|$|E
2500|$|The name [...] "Ori" [...] {{comes from}} the word [...] "Origin", as in {{the origin of the}} Ancients. When {{executive}} producer Robert C. Cooper looked at the root of [...] "origin", he retcon-invented the word [...] "Origin" [...] as the name of the Ori religion. Cooper said <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> idea for him to address the philosophical arguments with various religious people, seeing the whole challenge as [...] "how do you prove whose God exists or whether God exists at all?" [...] Instead of the Goa'uld, who were proved quickly to not be gods by killing them and figuring out their technology, {{it would be hard to}} present the same argument to the Ori followers because the Ori were essentially ascended gods. Even if their gods were dead, it would not make much difference for them, as their followers would continue to believe; without the [...] "magic powers" [...] of the Ori, their followers and the Priors (the Ori's missionaries) could still use the technology and their ships. Cooper said that [...] "it's not necessarily wrong to believe in something ... what's wrong is to murder somebody because they don't believe the way you do." [...] Although Cooper was reluctant to get too serious about the meaning behind the Ori as Stargate should [...] "first and foremost [...] entertain people", he considered it representative of television and the media, [...] "mak people believe whatever the people in charge of that magic box [...] whatever they want you to believe they can pretty much convince you, or convince the vast majority of people." [...] For Cooper, [...] "the followers of the Ori were the interesting part", and he [...] "wanted to do a story that was in some way reflective of the differences between people's beliefs that we see around us in our society, and how conflicts arise as a result of that." [...] Cooper was particularly interested in the interaction between Ori followers and other normal human beings, the resulting [...] "mysterious aspect and quality to religious belief and the passion that it invokes." [...] The producers therefore put the Ori in the story background, similar to the way there was very little direct interaction between the actual deities of the religion and mankind in real life.|$|E
