25|$|Streptococcus dysgalactiae {{was long}} {{believed}} to be non-pathogenic to humans. However, an increasing incidence of S.dysgalactiae infections has been documented, and in some geographic regions, the rate of invasive infection has even surpassed that of Streptococcus pyogenes.

People with chronic maladies, including cancer and diabetes, are also especially susceptible to infection.

40|$|AbstractThe {{cytotoxic}} T-lymphocyte (CTL) {{response to}} HTLV- 1 is directed mainly against the Tax protein. Circulating, activated Tax-specific CTL {{can be found}} in a majority of <b>healthy</b> <b>carriers</b> and patients with the HTLV- 1 -associated disease tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). In this study we present data on the Tax-specific CTL response of 26 HTLV- 1 carriers, including 10 newly recruited subjects. Rex-specific CTL were not found in any subjects investigated. Activated and memory CTL responses were determined separately in 4 <b>healthy</b> <b>carriers,</b> 3 HAM/TSP patients, and 1 “seronegative HAM/TSP. ” In all subjects, the mean frequency of peptide-specific memory cells per epitope (1 / 1307) was high. There was no significant difference in mean memory CTL frequency per epitope or in the proportion of subjects with activated CTL between <b>healthy</b> <b>carriers</b> and HAM/TSP patients. One individual with HAM/TSP had an unusually high frequency response to two peptides, suggesting immunodominance of epitope recognition in this individual. We conclude that the magnitude and components of the HTLV- 1 -specific CTL response do not differ between <b>healthy</b> <b>carriers</b> and HAM/TSP patients. These data do not support a specific CTL-mediated component in the pathogenesis of HAM/TSP...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE), a rare {{heritable}} disorder {{caused by}} mutations of the ABCC 6 gene, {{is characterized by}} fragmentation and mineralization of elastic fibres. We determined the extent of degradation of elastin by measuring and comparing the amount of desmosines in plasma and urine of PXE patients, <b>healthy</b> <b>carriers</b> and normal subjects. METHODS: Using capillary electrophoresis with laser-induced fluorescence detection (CE-LIF) we measured the amount of desmosines in the urine of 46 individuals (14 PXE patients, 17 <b>healthy</b> <b>carriers</b> and 15 controls) and in the plasma of 56 subjects (18 PXE patients, 23 <b>healthy</b> <b>carriers</b> and 15 controls). Pseudoxanthoma elasticum patients and carriers were identified by clinical, structural and molecular biology analyses. RESULTS: The urinary excretion of desmosines was two-fold higher in PXE patients than in controls (P < 0. 01); the values for <b>healthy</b> <b>carriers</b> were intermediate between those of PXE patients and controls. A very similar trend between patients and their relatives was observed for plasma desmosines. There was a significant correlation {{between the amount of}} the desmosines in plasma and urine. Moreover, a positive correlation was observed between urinary desmosine content and age of the patients as well as between urinary desmosine content and severity of clinical manifestations. CONCLUSIONS: Both the urinary and plasma desmosine concentrations indicate that elastin degradation is higher in PXE patients and, to a lesser extent, in <b>healthy</b> <b>carriers</b> than in normal subjects. Data seem to indicate that the amount of elastin breakdown products correlates with the age of patients {{as well as with the}} severity of the disease...|$|R

40|$|Background: Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is a {{hereditary}} {{connective tissue}} disease in which proteoglycans have altered properties. We investigated whether altered proteoglycan metabolism occurs in vivo {{and may be}} reflected in the urine of PXE individuals by analyzing the excreted polysaccharides. Methods: We measured sulfated glycosaminoglycans in the urine of 10 PXE-affected patients, 12 <b>healthy</b> <b>carriers,</b> and 20 <b>healthy</b> controls by agarose gel electrophoresis. Chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate disaccharides were also quantified by treatment with specific lyases and separation of products by chromatography. Results: Total polysaccharides were 34 % lower in the urine of PXE-affected patients and 17 % lower in <b>healthy</b> <b>carriers</b> than in the control group. Chondroitin sulfate was significantly (P < 0. 01) decreased, and heparan sulfate was significantly increased. The ratio of chondroitin sulfate to heparan sulfate was 2. 7 for PXE-affected patients, 2. 3 for <b>healthy</b> <b>carriers,</b> and 10. 7 for controls. In PXE-affected individuals and carriers, chondroitin sulfate contained more 4 -sulfated disaccharide, less 6 -sulfated disaccharide, and decreased nonsulfated disaccharide. Heparan sulfate from PXE-affected individuals and <b>healthy</b> <b>carriers</b> produced significantly less N-sulfated disaccharide and more disaccharide sulfated at the C- 6 position with no significant abnormality of the nonsulfated disaccharide percentage and sulfates: disaccharide ratio. Conclusions: The urinary data support the concept that the inherited defect of the ABCC 6 /MRP 6 transporter in PXE alters. metabolism of key polysaccharides.

Seven distinct classes were identified and were designated type a (8 bands), type b (8 bands), type c (7 bands), type d (9 bands), type x (10 bands), type y (10 bands), and type z (9 bands).

40|$|Objective(s) :HTLV- 1 is {{the first}} human {{retrovirus}} that has been recognized and is associated with HAM/TSP and ATLL. Studies have shown that less than five percent of HTLV- 1 infected carriers develop HAM/TSP or ATLL and about ninety-five percent remain asymptomatic. Therefore, the proviral load with Tax may affect cellular genes such as cytokines and oncogenes, as well as involve in pathogenicity. Materials and Methods:Thirty HAM/TSP patients, thirty HTLV- 1 <b>healthy</b> <b>carriers,</b> and MT- 2 cell line were evaluated for HTLV- 1 activity. PBMCs were isolated and activated using PMA and ionomycine. Real-time PCR and TaqMan methods were performed using specific primers and fluorescence probes for Tax expression and proviral load assessment. Β 2 microglobulin (β 2 m) and albumin were used as controls in Tax expression and in proviral load, respectively. Results: An insignificant increase in Tax expression was observed in rest PBMCs of HAM/TSP patients compared to <b>healthy</b> <b>carriers.</b> However, after lymphocyte activation {{there was a significant}} increase in Tax expression in HAM/TSP patients (P= 0. 042). The Proviral load in patients was significantly higher than in carriers.

Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) with different enzymes {{has been used for}} this action. Objectives: In this study, we used Bsp 143 I enzyme for digestion of the gene, coding protein A (spa gene) in S. aureus. The bacteria were isolated from patients and <b>healthy</b> <b>carriers</b> in Gorgan, north of Iran. Patients and Methods: DNAs of 128 S. aureus subjects (53 from <b>healthy</b> <b>carriers</b> and 75 from patients) were extracted and amplified using specific primers of the spa gene. The product was digested by Bsp 143 I enzyme and its pattern was assessed by gel electrophoresis. Results: There were seven spa types among the tested S. aureus samples, among which six types differed in the repeated X region of the spa gene, but the seventh type had a deletion on one of BSP 143 I restriction sites. The frequency of spa types among isolated S. aureus samples as well as <b>healthy</b> <b>carriers</b> was six and five, respectively. S. aureus isolated from wounds showed the most diverse spa types (five) among clinical samples. Types 1, 2 and 4 were observed in all clinical samples, while only one case of type 3 was identified among patients, whereas this type constituted over 32 % of the isolates among carriers. We found seven and four spa types among methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) isolates, respectively. Conclusions: Our results showed that typing the spa gene using PCR-RFLP using Bsp 143 I was an acceptable method for typing S. aureus. Furthermore, this survey showed that the types in <b>healthy</b> <b>carriers</b> and MSSA were more variable than patient and MRSA isolates, respectively.
