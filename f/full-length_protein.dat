25|$|A {{number of}} small {{molecules}} that aim at compensating various mutations of the CFTR gene are under development. One approach is to develop drugs that get the ribosome to overcome the stop codon and synthesize a full-length CFTR protein. About 10% of CF results from a premature stop codon in the DNA, leading to early termination of protein synthesis and truncated proteins. These drugs target nonsense mutations such as G542X, which consists of the amino acid glycine in position 542 being replaced by a stop codon. Aminoglycoside antibiotics interfere with protein synthesis and error-correction. In some cases, they can cause the cell to overcome a premature stop codon by inserting a random amino acid, thereby allowing expression of a <b>full-length</b> <b>protein.</b>|$|E
25|$|The name p53 {{was given}} in 1979 {{describing}} the apparent molecular mass; SDS-PAGE analysis indicates {{that it is a}} 53-kilodalton (kDa) protein. However, the actual mass of the full-length p53 protein (p53α) based on the sum of masses of the amino acid residues is only 43.7 kDa. This difference is due to the high number of proline residues in the protein, which slow its migration on SDS-PAGE, thus making it appear heavier than it actually is. In addition to the <b>full-length</b> <b>protein,</b> the human TP53 gene encodes at least 15 protein isoforms, ranging in size from 3.5 to 43.7 kDa. All these p53 proteins are called the p53 isoforms. The TP53 gene is the most frequently mutated gene (>50%) in human cancer, indicating that the TP53 gene plays a crucial role in preventing cancer formation. TP53 gene encodes proteins that bind to DNA and regulate gene expression to prevent mutations of the genome.|$|E

500|$|There {{are three}} protein isoforms of human Efs. hEfs1 and hEfs2 were {{identified}} by Ishino et al. hEFS1 (561 aa) represents the human counterpart of mouse embryonal Efs (mEfs1) originally identified. hEFS1 and mEfs1 are 80% identical in their amino acid sequences and 100% identical within the SH3 domain. [...] hEFS2 (468 aa) is identical to hEFS1, except for its lack of the SH3 domain. hEFS3 (392 aa) also lacks a functional SH3 domain and has the same C-terminus and short N-terminal amino acid tail as the <b>full-length</b> <b>protein.</b> Although little functional analysis of hEFS2 has been performed, speculatively, given lack of an SH3 domain, abundant hEFS2 may inhibit hEFS1 signaling by titrating partner proteins.

Our FTFLP-based approach offers two significant advantages: first, it produces internally-tagged <b>full-length</b> <b>proteins</b> {{that are likely to}} exhibit native intracellular localization, and second, it yields information about the tissue specificity of gene expression by the use of native promoters.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of the chaperone SecB with ribosome-bound polypeptides {{that are in the}} process of elongation has been studied using an in vitro protein synthesis system. The binding is characterized by the same properties as those demonstrated for the binding of SecB to <b>full-length</b> <b>proteins</b> that are in nonnative conformation: it is readily reversible and has no specificity for the leader peptide. In addition, it is shown that the growing polypeptide chains must achieve a critical length to bind tightly enough to allow their isolation in complex with SecB. This explains the longstanding observation that, even when export is cotranslational, it begins late in synthesis. Furthermore, the required length is approximately the same as the length that defines the binding frame within denatured, <b>full-length</b> <b>proteins</b> bound to SecB...|$|R

50|$|Aside {{from the}} <b>full-length</b> <b>protein,</b> the Elk1 gene can yield two {{shortened}} versions of Elk1: ∆Elk1 and sElk1. Alternative splicing produces ∆Elk1. This variant lacks {{part of the}} DNA-binding domain that allows interaction with SRF. On the other hand, sElk1 has an intact region that binds to SRF, but it lacks the first 54 amino acids that contain the NES. Found only in neurons, sElk1 is created by employing an internal translation start site. Both ∆Elk1 and sElk1, truncated versions of <b>full-length</b> <b>protein,</b> are capable of binding to DNA and inducing various cellular signaling.

Here we have characterized the activities of the <b>full-length</b> <b>proteins.</b> Unlike core RAG 2, which supports robust transposition in vitro, full-length RAG 2 blocks transposition of signal ends following V(D) J cleavage. Thus, one role of this non-catalytic domain may be to prevent transposition in developing lymphoid cells. Although full-length RAG 1 and RAG 2 proteins rarely form hybrid joints in vivo in the absence of non-homologous end-joining factors, we show that the <b>full-length</b> <b>proteins</b> alone can catalyze this reaction in vitro...|$|R

Here, we show that mRNAs carrying premature stop codons that prevent the production of <b>full-length</b> <b>proteins</b> via the nonsense-mediated decay pathway still produce a majority of peptide substrates for the MHC class I pathway by a noncanonical mRNA translation process. Blocking the interaction of the translation initiation factor eIF 4 E with the cap structure suppresses the synthesis of <b>full-length</b> <b>proteins</b> but has only a limited effect on the production of antigenic peptides.

50|$|This gene encodes a 130 Å-long, arch-shaped {{homodimer}} protein. The <b>full-length</b> <b>protein</b> product spans 239 residues, 55 {{of which}} comprise the mitochondrial-targeting sequence (MTS) at its N-terminal. However, once the <b>full-length</b> <b>protein</b> is imported into the mitochondria, this sequence is excised {{to produce the}} 184-residue mature protein. This cleavage also exposes four residues at the N-terminal, Ala-Val-Pro-Ile (AVPI), which {{is the core of}} the IAP binding domain and crucial for inhibiting XIAP. Specifically, the tetrapeptide sequence binds the BIR3 domain of XIAP to form a stable complex between SMAC and XIAP. The homodimer structure also facilitates SMAC-XIAP binding via the BIR2 domain, though it does not form until the protein is released into the cytoplasm as a result of outer mitochondrial membrane permeabilization. Thus, monomeric SMAC mutants can still bind the BIR3 domain but not the BIR2 domain, which compromises the protein’s inhibitory function. Meanwhile, mutations within the AVPI sequence lead to loss of function, though SMAC may still be able to perform IAP binding-independent functions, such as inducing the ubiquitinylation of XIAP.|$|E

In the present study, we report 2 -D PAGE separation and MS identification of <b>full-length</b> <b>proteins</b> extracted from FFPE skeletal muscle tissue. The 2 -D protein profiles obtained from FFPE tissues could be matched to those achieved from frozen tissues replicates. Up to 250 spots were clearly detected in 2 -D maps of proteins from FFPE tissue following standard mass-compatible silver staining. Protein spots from both FFPE and frozen tissue 2 -D gels were excised, subjected to in situ hydrolysis, and identified by MS analysis. Matched spots produced matched protein identifications. Moreover, 2 -D protein maps from FFPE tissues were successfully subjected to Western immunoblotting, producing comparable results to fresh-frozen tissues. In conclusion, this study provides evidence that, when adequately extracted, <b>full-length</b> <b>proteins</b> from FFPE tissues might be suitable to 2 -D PAGE-MS analysis, allowing differential proteomic studies on the vast existing archives of healthy and pathological-fixed tissues...|$|R

40|$|Chromosomal {{proteins}} HMG- 14 and HMG- 17 are {{the only}} known nuclear proteins which specifically bind to the nucleosome core particle and are implicated in the generation and/or maintenance of structural features specific to active chromatin. The two proteins facilitate polymerase II and III transcription from in vitro- and in vivo-assembled circular chromatin templates. Here we used deletion mutants and specific peptides to identify the transcriptional enhancement domain and delineate the nucleosomal binding domain of the HMG- 14 and - 17 proteins. Deletion of the 22 C-terminal amino acids of HMG- 17 or 26 C-terminal amino acids of HMG- 14 reduces significantly {{the ability of the}} proteins to enhance transcription from chromatin templates. In contrast, N-terminal truncation mutants had the same transcriptional enhancement activity as the <b>full-length</b> <b>proteins.</b> We conclude that the negatively charged C-terminal region of the proteins is required for transcriptional enhancement. Chromatin transcription enhancement assays, which involve binding competition between the <b>full-length</b> <b>proteins</b> and peptides derived from their nucleosomal binding regions, indicate that the minimal nucleosomal binding domain of human HMG- 17 is 24 amino acids long and spans residues 17 to 40. The results suggest that HMG- 14 and - 17 proteins have a modular structure and contain distinct functional domains...|$|R

The two <b>full-length</b> <b>proteins</b> {{as well as}} a carboxyl-terminal truncated derivative (deleted for 23 amino acid residues) were soluble upon cell lysis and were purified to 90 % homogeneity without the use of denaturants. In contrast, an amino-terminal truncated ras derivative (deleted for 22 amino acid residues) required treatment with urea for its solubilization. The guanine nucleotide binding activity of these four proteins was assessed by a combination of ligand binding on proteins blots, immunoprecipitation, and standard filter binding procedures.

Contrary to this model we show here that full-length forms of HH proteins are able to traffic to the plasma membrane and participate directly in cell-cell signaling, both in vitro and in vivo. We were also able to rescue a Drosophila eye-specific hh loss of function phenotype by expressing a full-length form of hh that cannot be processed into HH-Np. These results suggest that in some physiological contexts <b>full-length</b> HH <b>proteins</b> may participate directly in HH signaling and that this novel activity of full-length HH may be evolutionarily conserved...|$|R
