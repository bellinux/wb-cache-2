In 2008, the trade was selected by SI.com as the worst sports trade of all time. It {{was the subject of}} an episode of ESPN Classic's The Top 5 Reasons You Can't Blame.... In 2003 Johnson County High School named its football field in his honor. Walker was a highly popular and visible personality, even in his college days, as evidenced by the fact that both a thoroughbred and a standardbred race horse were named after him, the former while he was still in college. He made several appearances in the sports documentary <b>Damn</b> <b>Good</b> Dog (2004).|$|E

500|$|He remixed Kanye West's song, [...] "Diamonds from Sierra Leone", {{renaming}} the {{new version}} as [...] "Conflict Diamonds". With this remix, Fiasco wished {{to raise awareness of}} the conflict diamond business. This caught West's attention, and he asked Fiasco to perform on the song [...] "Touch the Sky" [...] for West's album Late Registration. The song, which sampled Curtis Mayfield's [...] "Move On Up", became a hit in the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number forty-two. After this success, Fiasco's first single [...] "Kick, Push" [...] was released earlier than expected. The song was a love story about two people sharing a passion for skateboarding, a topic generally not discussed in hip-hop. [...] Fiasco explained, [...] " [...] just as deep as hip-hop. I'm not the greatest skateboarder, but I'm a <b>damn</b> <b>good</b> rapper, so I made a <b>damn</b> <b>good</b> skateboarding song." [...] The single, and its accompanying music video, helped Fiasco get attention in the hip-hop community, and was later nominated for two 2007 Grammy Awards. During this time, he recorded guest performances on Tha' Rayne's [...] "Kiss Me" [...] and [...] "Didn't You Know" [...] singles, and also on K Foxx's 2004 [...] "This Life".|$|E
500|$|In {{the context}} of the {{turbulent}} political climate of 1968, [...] "Piggies" [...] was adopted by the counterculture as an anti-establishment theme song. It was also among the tracks on The Beatles that cult leader Charles Manson used as the foundation for his Helter Skelter theory of an American race-related countercultural revolution. Inspired especially by the line [...] "What they need's a <b>damn</b> <b>good</b> whacking", Manson's followers left clues relating to the lyrics at the scenes of the Tate–LaBianca murders in August 1969.|$|E
500|$|According to Chell's granddaughter, his Italian ancestry {{led him to}} {{call the}} drink a [...] "Caesar". [...] The longer name of [...] "Bloody Caesar" [...] is said to {{differentiate}} the drink from the Bloody Mary, but Chell {{said it was a}} regular patron at the bar who served as the inspiration. [...] During the three months he spent working to perfect the drink, he had customers sample it and offer feedback. [...] One regular customer, an Englishman, who often ordered the drink said one day [...] "Walter, that's a <b>damn</b> <b>good</b> bloody Caesar".|$|E
5000|$|<b>Damned</b> <b>Good</b> Show is a 2002 {{novel by}} Derek Robinson, {{concerning}} {{the actions of}} Bomber Command of the Royal Air Force {{in the first two}} years of the Second World War. It is the third book of Robinson's [...] "RAF Quartet", which began with Piece of Cake in 1983 and continued with A Good Clean Fight in 1993. Skull Skelton, a character in those earlier novels, is one of the protagonists of <b>Damned</b> <b>Good</b> Show. Like all of Robinson's novels, <b>Damned</b> <b>Good</b> Show points out the inadequacies of the pre-war establishment and the many hurdles that Bomber Command had to overcome during the course of the war, such as inadequate aircraft—in this case the Handley Page Hampden, and the inaccuracy of the night-time bombing raids on Germany.|$|R

500|$|During Harrison's Liverpool {{visit in}} early 1968, his mother, Louise, responded to his request for {{assistance}} with the lyrics by providing the line [...] "What they need's a <b>damn</b> <b>good</b> whacking". Harrison then taped a demo of the song at his house in Esher, Surrey, in late May that year. Following this recording, John Lennon supplied the final phrase in the line [...] "Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon", replacing the words [...] "to cut their pork chops", which Harrison had sung on the demo version. When performing [...] "Piggies" [...] in concert during the early 1990s, Harrison reinstated the omitted final verse.|$|E
500|$|Charles Manson {{first heard}} the album not long after it was released. He had already claimed to find hidden {{meanings}} in songs from earlier Beatles albums, but in The Beatles he interpreted prophetic significance {{in several of the}} songs, including [...] "Blackbird", [...] "Piggies" [...] (particularly the line [...] "what they need's a <b>damn</b> <b>good</b> whacking"), [...] "Helter Skelter", [...] "Revolution 1" [...] and [...] "Revolution 9", and interpreted the lyrics as a sign of imminent violence or war. He played the album repeatedly to his followers, the Manson family, and convinced them that it was an apocalyptic message predicting an uprising of oppressed races, drawing parallels with chapter 9 of the Book of Revelation.|$|E
500|$|In the Philippines, Mikhail Lecaros of GMA News {{praised the}} action scenes as [...] "technically {{polished}} while simultaneously visceral [...] even intimate [...] in their brutality". Writing for Rappler, Carljoe Javier expressed {{hope that the}} film would [...] " [...] as a shot of adrenaline, {{not only to the}} hearts of viewers, but hopefully also to mainstream cinema". Mari-An Santos of Philippine Entertainment Portal highly recommended it as [...] "a well-crafted film, from script to direction and acting to post-production ... it's a <b>damn</b> <b>good</b> film". Phillip Cu-Unjieng of Philippine Daily Inquirer praised the ensemble cast as [...] "top-notch" [...] and the film as [...] "dark, brooding, muscular and visceral, yet complex and concise in its story-telling".|$|E

500|$|Reviews of [...] "White Tulip" [...] were {{overwhelmingly}} positive. Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly {{enjoyed the}} episode, writing [...] "Fringe is becoming ever more adroit at blending its mythology with its paranormal cases". He also praised guest star Peter Weller's performance. After initially expecting a [...] "filler" [...] episode, Ramsey Isler of IGN {{said he was}} [...] "pleasantly proven wrong", as the [...] "story {{turned out to be}} one of the best of the series". Isler continued that [...] "the writers really did a good job of integrating the overall mythology into a standalone story that is actually <b>damn</b> <b>good...</b> It's brilliant storytelling". Andrew Hanson of Los Angeles Times enjoyed the episode, but wished Astrid got more screen time.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} the biggest {{challenge}} in making the film, Alfredson mentioned {{the fact that people}} already would have a perception of the characters and the surroundings from the novel. He especially felt that the depiction of Eli was difficult, but stated that he was [...] "very happy about Lina". On another occasion, he again commented positively on Leandersson's appearance, stating that [...] "e hardly used makeup or anything in post-production to make her like this, she is simply <b>damn</b> <b>good.</b> She's also a very special girl, which I think shows in the film." [...] He has frequently commended Leandersson for her intelligence, often comparing her to [...] "an 80-year-old woman, very wise and very quiet." ...|$|E
500|$|Matt Collar, {{writing for}} AllMusic, {{declared}} [...] "The record's collaborative foundation crackles on every track, but Hayley Williams, a ballsy, extroverted frontwoman {{with a voice}} big enough to stop time, proves unequivocally to be the cunning talent of the band, no matter how vital York and Davis may be". Collar regards it their best album. At AbsolutePunk, Jack Appleby said [...] "Instead of pursuing all things epic or intentionally moving to a specific sound, the band had a blast pursuing every genre under the sun, creating a <b>damn</b> <b>good</b> album in the process...Chances are you won't dedicate undivided attention to Paramore, but you'll regularly queue the whole record." [...] He concluded with that the album isn't for everyone, but has something that anyone could enjoy.|$|E

500|$|Record Mirror {{remarked that}} the birdsong effects of [...] "Blackbird" [...] were {{replaced}} by [...] "snorts and grunts" [...] on [...] "Piggies", which the reviewer described as [...] "a society beef (or pork if you like)" [...] {{in the style of}} folk singer Roy Harper. Writing in Rolling Stone, Jann Wenner considered the song to be [...] "an amazing choice to follow 'Blackbird'", given the contrast between the two pieces – [...] "'Blackbird' so encouraging, 'Piggies' so smug (though accurate: 'what they need's a <b>damn</b> <b>good</b> whacking'). Ha!" [...] Wenner paired it with Starr's [...] "Don't Pass Me By", as lesser songs beside the [...] "superb numbers" [...] found elsewhere on the album, but added that [...] "on their own, they're totally groovy." ...|$|E
500|$|The game's {{graphics}} and audio were widely praised by reviewers.

[...] GameSpy called the graphics [...] "crisp, clear and colorful," [...] with [...] "good animation on easily viewable sprites." [...] GameSpy additionally noted that the game's audio, a particularly lambasted feature of Harmony of Dissonance, was [...] "fitting and well-composed." [...] Prior to the game's release, IGN commented that the music was [...] "pretty darn good." [...] GameSpot, although labeling the music as [...] "mostly forgettable," [...] noted that it was far better than the audio of Harmony of Dissonance, and celebrated the individual audio used for enemies.|$|E
500|$|The poem, {{named after}} the [...] "Last Post" [...] (the bugle call used at British ceremonies remembering those killed in war), makes {{explicit}} references to Wilfred Owen's poem from the First World War Dulce et Decorum Est.

[...] The poem was generally well received, with one commentator saying that it was [...] "simply a <b>damn</b> <b>good</b> poem with rich imagery, cinematic movement and poignant ending." [...] Another said that it was [...] "moving reversal of history" [...] and a [...] "fine poem". Duffy herself was quoted as saying that she wanted to honour the tradition of poets who were soldiers.|$|E

500|$|According to MacDonald, the {{counterculture}} of the 1960s analysed The Beatles {{above and beyond}} all of the band's previous releases. The album's lyrics progressed from being vague to open-ended and prone to misinterpretation, such as [...] "Glass Onion" [...] (e.g., [...] "the walrus was Paul") and [...] "Piggies" [...] ("what they need's a <b>damn</b> <b>good</b> whacking"). The release also coincided with public condemnation of Lennon's treatment of Cynthia, and of his and Ono's joint projects, particularly Two Virgins. The British authorities similarly displayed a less tolerant attitude towards the Beatles, when London Drug Squad officers arrested Lennon and Ono in October 1968 for marijuana possession, a charge that he claimed was false. In the case of [...] "Back in the U.S.S.R.", the words were interpreted by Christian evangelist David Noebel as further proof of the Beatles' compliance in a Communist plot to brainwash American youth.|$|E
500|$|Angus {{said that}} when {{composing}} with Malcolm they share ideas to make each track [...] "work together" [...] to form a complete album, and Johnson added [...] "these songs belong together. It's about five boys having a <b>damn</b> <b>good</b> time in a studio." [...] With 15 songs and a running time of over 55 minutes, Black Ice has the longest running time of any AC/DC studio record. Malcolm said that [...] "about 60 or 70 song ideas" [...] were developed, but Angus stated that most were discarded {{because they were not}} [...] "representative of how we are". Angus also said that the first attempt to sequence the album resulted in a track list comprising eleven songs, [...] "but as the days went by each band member voted for a new track, and then another, and other one" [...] so they decided to include all the recorded tracks.|$|E
500|$|Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times {{stated that}} [...] " [...] {{strengths}} do not serve him, or the movie, as well here" [...] and that [...] "when the story starts to crumble around Bale, Worthington {{is there to}} pick up the pieces". Craig Sharp of FilmShaft gave the film 3/5, saying [...] "If you're looking for action then this is one <b>damn</b> <b>good</b> film! If it's character depth you're after then move along please." [...] A.O. Scott of the New York Times said the film has [...] "a brute integrity lacking in some of the other seasonal franchise movies" [...] and [...] "efficient, reasonably swift storytelling". Ben Lyons and Ben Mankiewicz gave the film a [...] "See It" [...] and [...] "Skip It", respectively, on their show At the Movies with the latter mentioning that it [...] "is the worst big budget summer release I've seen in some time".|$|E
