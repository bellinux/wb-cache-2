With Flat Clinch staplers, the staple legs first pierce the paper and are then bent over and pressed {{absolutely}} flat against the paper - doing away with the two-setting anvil commonly used and making use of a recessed stapling base in which the legs are folded. Accordingly, staples do not have sharper edges exposed and lead to flatter stacking of paper - saving on <b>filing</b> and <b>binder</b> space.|$|R

50|$|Avery Dennison {{created a}} {{separate}} division for office {{products such as}} <b>binders,</b> <b>file</b> labels and name badges in 1982. The division and its products, sold under the Avery brand and logo, contrasted with the company’s larger materials division in that its products were finished (“converted”) materials, and they were aimed at consumers as well as businesses. Over the next 30 years, the division grew, as personal computing created a market for printable media {{both at home and}} at work. However, with the rise of email and the decline in conventional mail, the office products market as a whole began to decline. On July 1, 2013, Avery Dennison completed the sale of Office and Consumer Products and a second business, Designed and Engineered Solutions, to CCL Industries. CCL purchased the Avery office products brand along with the business. Avery Dennison retains its full name, history, brand and logo.|$|R

Typically, the work-integrated learning curriculum of universities of technology in South Africa world-wide requires a paper based document, generally referred to as a portfolio. The latter reflects the evidence of the student‟s practical experience. Some research has been done to address the shortcomings of traditional work-integrated portfolios, for example how to store learning evidence on computer. An electronic portfolio is a collection of electronic evidence assembled and managed by a user (in this case a student), usually via the Web. e-Portfolios demonstrates the user‟s ability to utilize web platforms for self-expression. Furthermore they can be maintained dynamically over time. The advantage of e-portfolio applications are that it can be accessed by various users (e. g. lecturing staff, employees, students) and for multiple purposes of teaching and learning. This paper establishes to what extent the electronic portfolio can be utilized to support the curricula of universities of technology to gain effective access to the learning record or evidence of students during and after work-integrated learning...|$|R

This was initially thought to be an indirect effect of reduced muscle tension, but it is now known that the toxin inhibits release of peripheral nociceptive neurotransmitters, suppressing the central pain processing systems responsible for migraine headache. In 2010, the FDA approved intramuscular botulinum toxin injections for prophylactic treatment of chronic migraine headache.|$|R
