40|$|Abstract. <b>Functional</b> <b>{{description}}s</b> are {{a central}} pillar of Semantic Web services. Disregarding {{details on how}} to invoke and consume the service, they shall provide a black box description for determining the usability of a Web service for some request or usage scenario {{with respect to the}} provided functionality. The creation of sophisticated semantic matchmaking techniques as well as exposition of their correctness requires clear and unambiguous semantics of <b>functional</b> <b>descriptions.</b> As existing description frameworks like OWL-S and WSMO lack in this respect, this paper presents so-called Abstract State Spaces as a rich and language independent model of Web services and the world they act in. This allows giving a precise mathematical definition of the concept of Web Service and the semantics of <b>functional</b> <b>descriptions.</b> Finally, we demonstrate the benefit of applying such a model by means of a concrete use case: the semantic analysis of <b>functional</b> <b>descriptions</b> which allows to detect certain (un) desired semantic properties of <b>functional</b> <b>descriptions.</b> As a side effect, semantic analysis based on our formal model allows us to gain a formal understanding and insight in matching of <b>functional</b> <b>descriptions</b> during Web service discovery. ...|$|R

40|$|In this {{position}} paper, {{the ambiguity of}} <b>functional</b> <b>descriptions</b> in engineering is considered from a methodological point of view. Four responses to this ambiguity are discussed, ranging from defining a single meaning of function and rejecting the different meanings that are currently used in engineering to accepting these meanings as coexisting in engineering and taking function as a family resemblance concept. Rejecting the different meanings is described as the straightforward response to resolving the ambiguity of <b>functional</b> <b>descriptions,</b> yet in engineering research and design methodology it rather seems to be accepted that engineers do use the coexisting meanings side by side. In this paper, explanations are given of why this practice is beneficial to engineering. Then it is explored how the particular meaning that engineers attach to function depends on the tasks for which <b>functional</b> <b>descriptions</b> are used. Finally, the methodological implications of the four responses to the ambiguity of <b>functional</b> <b>descriptions</b> are discussed. Values and TechnologyTechnology, Policy and Managemen...|$|R

Furthermore, we posit a number of constraints for a correct interpretation of the formal system and also provide a web ontology language version.
