40|$|Outdated {{juvenile}} {{and adult}} fish passage facilities were recently reconstructed at the five major irrigation dams {{on the lower}} Umatilla River, Oregon to meet National marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) design standards. Changes in design at juvenile fish bypass facilities included reduced mesh size on the rotating <b>drum</b> <b>screens,</b> larger screening area, a more oblique orientation of the <b>drum</b> <b>screens</b> to canal flow, improved screen seals, replacement of bypass portals with vertical slot bypass channels, and increased bypass pipe diameters. Weir-and-pool adult fish ladders and jump pools were replaced with vertical-slot ladders. From 1991 [...] 1995, they investigated injury and travel rate of juvenile fish moving through the facilities, and efficiency of screens in preventing fish entry into the canals. Water velocities in front of canal screens, at bypass channel entrances, and at ladder diffusers were measured to assess adherence to NMFS criteria and identify hydraulic patterns. Biological evaluations were conducted by releasing and recapturing marked yearling summer steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss), yearling spring chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha), and subyearling fall chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha) in varying locations within the fish passage facilities...|$|R

Durum wheat semolina was used as raw material to produce the wet agglomerates. The pilot rotating <b>screen</b> <b>drum</b> equipment was composed of two sieves to separate three fractions: fine, medium, and large agglomerates.

50|$|In {{addition}} to treating the liquid waste excreted by fish {{the solid waste}} must also be treated, this is done by concentrating and flushing the solids out of the system. Removing solids reduces bacteria growth, oxygen demand, {{and the proliferation of}} disease. The simplest method for removing solids is the creation of settling basin where the relative velocity of the water is slow and particles can settle {{at the bottom of the}} tank where they are either flushed out or vacuumed out manually using a siphon. However, this method is not viable for RAS operations where a small footprint is desired. Typical RAS solids removal involves a sand filter or particle filter where solids become lodged and can be periodically backflushed out of the filter. Another common method is the use of a mechanical drum filter where water is run over a rotating <b>drum</b> <b>screen</b> that is periodically cleaned by pressurized spray nozzles, and the resulting slurry is treated or sent down the drain. In order to remove extremely fine particles or colloidal solids a protein fractionator may be used with or without the addition of ozone (O3).|$|E

40|$|The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory {{evaluated}} 19 Phase II screen {{sites in}} the Yakima River Basin {{at least three times}} each between April 30 and August 22, 1997. The sites were examined to determine if they were being effectively operated and maintained to provide fish a safe, efficient return to the river. Data were collected to determine if velocities in front of the screens and in the bypass met current NMFS criteria and promoted timely fish bypass, if fish were protected from injury due to impingement, entrainment, and predation, and whether bypass outfall conditions allowed fish to safely return to the river. A bi-directional flow meter and underwater video system were essential in completing the investigation. In general, water velocity conditions at the screen sites were acceptable by NMFS standards. High approach velocities and slow bypass flow were the most common problems noted. Although velocities often fluctuated from one sampling location to the next, average sweep and approach velocities were very good. In general, fish should not be impinged or experience delays in returning to the river under normal operating conditions. Most screens were properly sealed to prevent fish entrainment and injury, although potential problems were identified at several screen sites. Three sites had gap openings from the forebay to the aftbay, allowing fish to be entrained. Other sites had spaces larger than 3 / 32 inch where small fish could become trapped. Some drum screens had flat spots but these were not been confirmed as underwater gaps, primarily because of siltation. On rare occasions, seals were intact, but cracked or turned under. Submergence levels at the <b>drum</b> <b>screen</b> sites exceeded 85 % for one third of our evaluations. Eight of 12 <b>drum</b> <b>screen</b> sites experienced high water levels during at least one evaluation. Only one operating site's submergence was measured at less than 65 % submergence. Two flat plate screen sites were completely overtopped with water during one evaluation each. Although 1997 was an extreme high-water year, these overtopping events point out that some screens do not completely protect fish under the full range of potential operating conditions. Water depths at the outfall pipe were acceptable at all but four sites. Generally, water depths were low {{near the end of the}} irrigation season due to low river flows. Rock removal around the outfall pipe or pipe extension would improve the situation. We gauged the potential for predation by qualitatively measuring the types and amount of cover provided for predators in front of the screens and by recording random observations of fish large enough to be considered predators in the forebay. Predation was more likely to occur at <b>drum</b> <b>screen</b> sites than at flat plate screen sites. Drum sites provide more predator hiding places because greater amounts of woody debris accumulate under the drums and against the concrete walls that divide one screen bay from the next. Four sites had both woody debris and large fish present. These four sites were considered most likely to experience juvenile salmonid loss to predation. Periodic removal of woody debris from underneath the curvature of drum screens would decrease the likelihood of predation at these sites. Screens were generally well maintained. Automated cleaning brushes functioned properly, chains and other moving parts were well greased, and inoperative and algae-covered drum screens were eventually repaired and cleaned. However, removal of sediment build-up and accumulated woody debris are areas where improvement should be considered. Maintenance checks should include observation of bypass outfalls on a regular basis, as conditions at the end of the bypass pipe are likely to change seasonally, especially in streams with high gradients or unstable gravel. Post-season evaluations were conducted at 11 sites in November to try and confirm seal and <b>drum</b> <b>screen</b> defects, and locations of excessive sedimentation. This proved effective in several cases, but the winterization process eliminated some of the evidence. Several forebay areas had already been cleared of silt. It was difficult to evaluate screens and seals when the screens were in the storage position because the screens could not be rotated. Also, two sites remained in full operation while others were submerged, precluding detailed examination of parts still under water. Periodic, regular screen evaluations will increase the effectiveness of screen operation and maintenance practices by confirming the effectiveness (or ineffectiveness) of screen operating procedures at individual sites. Where procedures are being followed and problems still occur, evaluation results will suggest means to improve the procedures to better protect fish at screening facilities...|$|E

Several operational, water quality, and temporal factors were correlated with the total number of impinged organisms when the plant is pumping water. In this study, operational factors included hourly average flow and the number of screens in operation during sampling. Water quality factors included temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, conductivity and salinity. Temporal factors included month and time of day of impingement sampling. Over the course of a year, fish and shellfish impinged on Passavant traveling <b>drum</b> <b>screens</b> were collected, classified, and counted. Multiple regression analyses were conducted and the number of organisms impinged was the response variable.

Local Government requires that fish processors remove total suspended solids (TSS), fats, oil and grease (FOGs) and colloidal materials almost completely {{in order to allow}} for efficient disinfection. The OCS plant had only a limited amount of space. Clean Water Technology, Inc. (CWT) and OCS teams designed the system with an underground equalization tank, 1 / 8 inch rotating <b>drum</b> <b>screens,</b> flocculation flotation (GEM System) and chlorination dechlorination.

The 25 % estimate is based on monitoring chinook salmon 0. tshawytscha fry that were diverted from the river into the irrigation ditch.

40|$|Investigations {{into the}} visual system {{development}} and function necessitate quantifiable behavioral models of visual performance {{that are easy}} to elicit, robust, and simple to manipulate. A suitable model has been found in the optokinetic response (OKR), a reflexive behavior present in all vertebrates due to its high selection value. The OKR involves slow stimulus-following movements of eyes alternated with rapid resetting saccades. The measurement of this behavior is easily carried out in zebrafish larvae, due to its early and stable onset (fully developed after 96 hours post fertilization (hpf)), and benefitting from the thorough knowledge about zebrafish genetics, for decades one of the favored model organisms in this field. Meanwhile the analysis of similar mechanisms in adult fish has gained importance, particularly for pharmacological and toxicological applications. Here we describe VisioTracker, a fully automated, high-throughput system for quantitative analysis of visual performance. The system is based on research carried out in the group of Prof. Stephan Neuhauss and was re-designed by TSE Systems. It consists of an immobilizing device for small fish monitored by a high-quality video camera equipped with a high-resolution zoom lens.

40|$|The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) {{evaluated}} {{the effectiveness of}} 6 -in. and 2 -in. submerged orifices, and an overflow weir for fish bypass at a rotary drum fish screening facility. A modular <b>drum</b> <b>screen</b> built by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) was installed at PNNL`s Aquatic Ecology research laboratory in Richland, Washington. Fry, subyearlings, and smolts of spring chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawyacha) were introduced into the test system, and their movement and injury rates were monitored. A total of 33 tests (100 fish per test) that lasted from 24 to 48 hr were completed from 1994 through 1995. Passage rate depended on both fish size and bypass configuration. For fry/fingerling spring chinook salmon, {{there was no difference}} in passage rate through the three bypass configurations (2 -in. orifice, 6 -in. orifice, or overflow weir). Subyearlings moved sooner when the 6 -in. orifice was used, with more than 50 % exiting through the fish bypass in the first 8 hr. Smolts exited quickly and preferred the 6 -in. orifice, with over 90 % of the smolts exiting through the bypass in less than 2 hr. Passage was slightly slower when a weir was used, with 90 % of the smolts exiting in about 4 hr. When the 2 -in. orifice was used in the bypass, 90 % of the smolts did not exit until after 8 hr. In addition, about 7 % of the smolts failed to migrate from the forebay within 24 hr, indicating that smolts were significantly delayed when the 2 -in. orifice was used. Few significant injuries were detected for any of the life stages. However, light descaling occurred on about 15 % of chinook salmon smolts passing through the 2 -in. orifice. Although a single passage through the orifice did not appear to cause significant scale loss or other damage, passing through several screening facilities with 2 -in. orifices could cause cumulative injuries...|$|E

Some {{of the objectives}} in the corresponding statement of work for this contract were not completed within FY 02. A description of the progress during FY 02 and reasoning for deviation from the original tasks and timeline are given. OBJECTIVE 1 [...] Provide coordination of all activities, administrative oversight and assist in project implementation and monitoring activities. Administration oversight and coordination of the habitat statement of work, budget, subcontracts and personnel was provided. OBJECTIVE 2 [...] Develop, coordinate, and implement the Hood River Fish Habitat Protection, Restoration, and Monitoring Plan. The Hood River Fish Habitat Protection, Restoration, and Monitoring Plan was completed in 2000 (Coccoli et al., 2000). This document is utilized for many purposes including: drafting the Watershed Action Plan, ranking projects for funding, and prioritizing projects to target in the future. This document was updated and revised to reflect changes to fish habitat and needs in the Hood River basin based upon other documents and actions taken in the basin. OBJECTIVE 3 [...] Assist Middle Fork Irrigation District in developing an alternative irrigation water source on Evans Creek (Hutson pond and Evans Creek diversion), {{eliminating the need for}} irrigation diversion dams which happen to be partial fish barriers. Upon completion, this project will restore 2. 5 miles of access for winter steelhead, coho salmon, and resident trout habitat. This objective was revised and included in the FY 03 Statement of Work for Project No. 1998 - 021 - 00. During FY 02 the final engineering was completed on this project. However, due to a lengthy permitting process and NMFS consultation, this project was inadvertently delayed. Project completion is expected in July 2003. OBJECTIVE 4 [...] Assist the Farmers Irrigation District (FID) in construction and installation of a new fish screen and bypass system on the mainstem Hood River (Farmers Canal). Final engineering and design for the horizontal screen was completed during the winter of 2001. In December 2001 and January 2002, the concrete work was completed and the head gates were mounted. During the spring the secondary head level control gates were installed. In September 2002, the jersey barriers and vortex tubes were installed. These are located upstream of the old <b>drum</b> <b>screen,</b> and are the primary means of dealing with bedload and suspended load from the diversion. The screen surface was also installed in September 2002 and the system accommodated water soon after. Monitoring of these structures in regards to efficiency and possible effects to fish migration is scheduled to occur in spring 2003. The transition from the old canal to the new screen is smooth and currently does not present any problems. The old <b>drum</b> <b>screen</b> is going to remain in place until all the biological and hydrological monitoring is complete to ensure compliance and satisfaction of all agencies involved. OBJECTIVE 5 [...] Assist the East Fork Irrigation District (EFID) in final engineering design and construction of the Central Lateral Canal upgrade and invert siphon. This objective was revised and included in the FY 03 Statement of Work for Project No. 1998 - 021 - 00. During FY 02, {{a significant portion of the}} engineering and design work was completed on the EFID Central Lateral Canal upgrade and invert siphon. There were some changes in canal alignment that required further design work and easement acquisition. Time was also spent looking for matching funds and securing a loan by the EFID. Construction initiation is now scheduled for summer 2003. OBJECTIVE 6 [...] Modify and/or eliminate five culverts, three on Baldwin Creek, one on Graham Creek, and one on Evans Creek, which function as barriers to upstream and downstream fish migration. This objective was revised and included in the FY 03 Statement of Work for Project No. 1998 - 021 - 00. There are only two culverts on Baldwin Creek that will be eliminated or modified. Work was initiated on the removal of one of these culverts, and the replacement of the other. The landowner was agreeable and NEPA was initiated. The modification/elimination of these culverts is scheduled for FY 04. The culvert on Graham Creek is a county road, and will be addressed as a fish passage barrier by Hood River County. The Evans Creek culvert was prepared for modification in FY 02, however due to a lengthy permitting process the instream work period was missed. This project is on the schedule for the instream work period of 2003. OBJECTIVE 7 [...] Construct riparian fence to stabilize and improve the riparian zone along the East Fork Hood River and tributaries. Two riparian fencing projects were completed on East Fork Hood River tributaries. The first was on Baldwin Creek, and the second was on Shelly Creek...|$|E
40|$|The {{study was}} {{performed}} in 1962 in a diversion of the Yakima River near Prosser, Wash. Massive structures for regulating the water velocity, producing the desired electrical field, and collecting the guided fish were installed. Evaluation facilities consisted of rotary <b>drum</b> <b>screens</b> to divert all fish that escaped past the electrical field to an inclined-screen trap. The fish tested were wild, downstream-migrating fingerlings of chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha; coho salmon O. kisutch; and rainbow or steelhead trout, Salmo gairdneri. The variables were three water velocities, three species, and four test periods. Fish-guiding efficiency tended to decrease with increasing water velocity. The guiding efficiencies of the electrical system at water velocities of 0. 2, 0. 5, and 0. 8 (m. p. s) meter per second were, respectively, 84. 2, 54. 2, and 50. 2 percent for chinook salmon, 82. 4, 47. 8, and 42. 8 percent for coho salmon; and 69. 9, 40. 2, and 44. 8 percent for rainbow or steelhead trout. The guiding efficiency achieved was, thus, highest with chinook salmon, intermediate with coho salmon, and generally lowest with rainbow or steelhead trout. The use of electricity to guide juvenile salmon and trout migrating downstream may be feasible in certain environments where the water velocity does not exceed 0. 3 m. p. s. but does not appear practical for use in most rivers and streams...|$|R
40|$|A {{low cost}} PC-based seismic data {{recording}} and analysis {{system has been}} developed {{for the purpose of}} replacing conventional analog seismic recorders in developing countries. The system records three channel seismic signals into hard disk in win-format, and plots the seismogram on virtual <b>drums</b> on <b>screen</b> like a helicoder. The data is time-stamped by GPS clock. The seismograms {{in the last few days}} can be browsed while recording the new data. The system also provides a utility to view an event in zoom-in window, and to pick phases without stopping the recording and plotting new data...|$|R
40|$|The Glenn-Colusa Irrigation District (GCID) diverts up to 3, 000 {{cubic feet}} per second (cfs) from the Sacramento River near Hamilton City, California. A new fish screen at the canal intake was {{constructed}} in 1972. About the same time, changes to the channel of the river resulted in the river degrading more than 3 feet near the intake to the pumping plant. The reduced water depth {{on the face of}} the screen structure causes through screen velocities to increase dramatically. At the present design pumping flow of 2, 800 cfs, the velocity component perpendicular to the screens has doubled the current criteria of 0. 33 feet per second (fps). This and other problems on the existing screens result in the impingement and entrainment of winter-run chinook smolts, which are a listed endangered specie. A range of solutions were considered by GCID and the resource agencies including building a gradient restoration project, changing pumping amounts and schedules, to a new state-of-the-art screen. Design criteria for the screen were established and alternatives consisting of vertical V-screens, inclined modular <b>screens,</b> and/or <b>drum</b> <b>screens</b> at the existing and other locations, were analyzed. The bypass system was a critical consideration that represented a substantial part of the cost, and yet, was based on the most uncertain data. Each alternative was evaluated for its ability to meet the fishery criteria, hydraulic, predator, sediment and debris conditions, and cost...|$|R
