5|$|Proposals were {{submitted}} by Bell, Boeing Vertol/Grumman team, Hughes, Lockheed, and Sikorsky. In July 1973, the U.S. Department of Defense selected finalists Bell and Hughes Aircraft's Toolco Aircraft Division (later Hughes Helicopters). This began the phase 1 of the competition. Each company built prototype helicopters {{and went through}} a flight test program. Hughes' Model 77/YAH-64A prototype first flew on 30 September 1975, while Bell's Model 409/YAH-63A prototype first flew on 1 October 1975. After evaluating the test results, the Army selected Hughes' YAH-64A over Bell's YAH-63A in 1976. Reasons for selecting the YAH-64A included its more <b>damage</b> <b>tolerant</b> four-blade main rotor and the instability of the YAH-63's tricycle landing gear arrangement.|$|E

The company is to develop new technologies such as a zero-vibration system, adaptive flight control laws, advanced fire management, a more durable main rotor, full-spectrum crashworthiness, and <b>damage</b> <b>tolerant</b> airframe; then they are to transition them to the helicopter. Improvements to the Black Hawk are to continue until the Future Vertical Lift program is ready to replace it.|$|E

50|$|Chaya {{is easy to}} grow, {{a tender}} {{perennial}} in the US, and suffers little insect <b>damage.</b> It is <b>tolerant</b> of heavy rain and has some drought tolerance. Propagation is normally by woody stem cuttings about 6-12 inches long, as seeds are produced only rarely. Early growth is slow as roots are slow to develop on the cuttings, so leaves are not harvested until the second year. Chaya leaves can be harvested continuously as long as no more than 50% of the leaves are removed from the plant, which guarantees healthy new plant growth.|$|R
30|$|Submergence {{tolerance}} is {{an important}} trait where short term flash flooding <b>damages</b> rice. <b>Tolerant</b> landraces that withstand submergence for 1 – 2 [*]weeks were identified. Due to the heterogeneity in flood-prone ecosystem {{many different types of}} traditional rice cultivars are being grown by the farmers. The local landraces adapted to extremes in water availability could be the sources of genetic variation are to be used to improve the adaptability of rice to excess water stress. Greater genotypic variability was observed for plant height, elongation and survival %, absolute growth rate, non-structural carbohydrate retention capacity, chlorophyll content, different chlorophyll fluorescence parameters (FPs) characteristics, and re-generation growth at re-emergence. Twenty days submergence caused greater damage even in Submergence 1 (SUB 1) introgressed cultivars compared to the 14 [*]days of submergence. The FPs, carbohydrate content and dry weight at the end of submergence showed positive and highly significant association with re-generation growth. The presence of SUB 1 associated primers, either SC 3 or ART 5, was noticed even in greater elongating types of rice genotypes. These genotypes possess {{one or more of the}} adaptive traits required for the flood-prone ecosystem, which range from temporary submergence of 1 – 2 [*]weeks to long period of stagnant water tolerance.|$|R
40|$|It {{is pointed}} out that {{advanced}} avionics applications increasingly require underlying machine architectures which are <b>damage</b> and fault <b>tolerant,</b> and which provide access to distributed sensors, effectors and high-throughput computational resources. The Advanced Information Processing System (AIPS), sponsored by NASA, is to provide an architecture which can meet the considered requirements. Ada was selected for implementing the AIPS system software. Advantages of Ada are related to its provisions for real-time programming, error detection, modularity and separate compilation, and standardization and portability. Chief drawbacks of this language are currently limited availability and maturity of language implementations, and limited experience in applying the language to real-time applications. The present investigation is concerned with current plans for employing Ada {{in the design of}} the software for AIPS. Attention is given to an overview of AIPS, AIPS software services, and representative design issues in each of four major software categories...|$|R

This approach usually uses the technologies of nondestructive testing and requires an accurate prediction of the rate of crack-growth between inspections. The designer sets some aircraft maintenance checks schedule frequent enough that parts are replaced while the crack {{is still in the}} [...] "slow growth" [...] phase.

50|$|A VLS allows surface combatants to have {{a greater}} number of weapons ready for firing at any given time {{compared}} to older launching systems such as the Mark 13 single-arm and Mark 26 twin-arm launchers, which were fed from behind by a magazine below the main deck. In addition to greater firepower, VLS is much more <b>damage</b> <b>tolerant</b> and reliable than the previous systems, and has a lower radar cross-section (RCS). The U.S. Navy now relies exclusively on VLS for its guided missile destroyers and cruisers.|$|E
5|$|Ficus rubiginosa {{was first}} {{cultivated}} in the United Kingdom in 1789, {{where it is}} grown in glasshouses. It is commonly used as a large ornamental tree in eastern Australia, in the North Island of New Zealand, and also in Hawaii and California, where it is also listed as an invasive species in some areas. It is useful as a shade tree in public parks and on golf courses. Not as prodigious as other figs, F. rubiginosa is suited to slightly more confined areas, such as lining car parks or suburban streets. However, surface roots can be large and intrusive and the thin bark readily <b>damaged</b> when struck. <b>Tolerant</b> of acid or alkaline soils, it is hardy to US Hardiness Zones 10B and 11, reaching 10m (35ft) high in 30 years. Planting trees 8–12m (30–40ft) apart will eventually result in a continuous canopy. The trees are of great value in providing fruit for birds and mammals, though drop large quantities of fruit and leaves, leaving a mess underfoot.|$|R
50|$|While MAX phases are stiff, {{they can}} be {{machined}} as easily as some metals. They can all be machined using a manual hacksaw, {{despite the fact that}} some of them are three times as stiff as titanium metal, with the same density as titanium. They can also be polished to a metallic luster because of their excellent electrical conductivities. They are not susceptible to thermal shock and exceptionally <b>damage</b> <b>tolerant.</b> Some, such as Ti2AlC and Cr2AlC, are oxidation and corrosion resistant.Polycrystalline Ti3SiC2 has zero thermopower that is correlated to the anisotropic electronic structure.|$|E

50|$|Aluminium has a {{relatively}} high fracture toughness, allowing it to undergo large amounts of plastic deformation before failure. Composites, on the other hand, are less <b>damage</b> <b>tolerant</b> and undergo much less plastic deformation before failure. An airplane made entirely from aluminium can be repaired almost anywhere. This {{is not the case}} for composite materials, particularly as they use different and more exotic materials. Because of this, composites will probably always be used more in military aircraft, which are constantly being maintained, than in commercial aircraft, which have to require less maintenance. Aluminium still remains a remarkably useful material for aircraft structures and metallurgists have worked hard to develop better aluminium alloys, for example aluminium-lithium alloys.|$|E
50|$|Being a trichloride, {{it is more}} {{thermodynamically}} {{stable than}} the corresponding fluoride salts and can therefore be maintained in a strongly reducing state by contact with sacrificial nuclear grade zirconium metal added as a coating on, or an insert within, the fuel tube. As a result, the fuel tube {{can be made from}} standard nuclear certified steel without risk of corrosion. Since the reactor operates in the fast spectrum, the tubes will be exposed to very high neutron flux and suffer high damage (dpa) levels, estimated at 100-200 dpa over the tube life. Highly neutron <b>damage</b> <b>tolerant</b> steels such as PE16 will therefore be used for the tubes. Assessment is also being carried out on other steels with fast-neutron data such as HT9, NF616 and 15-15Ti.|$|E
50|$|Damage {{tolerance}} is {{a property}} of a structure relating to {{its ability to}} sustain defects safely until repair can be effected. The approach to engineering design to account for damage tolerance {{is based on the}} assumption that flaws can exist in any structure and such flaws propagate with usage. This approach is commonly used in aerospace engineering to manage the extension of cracks in structure through the application of the principles of fracture mechanics. In aerospace engineering, structure is considered to be <b>damage</b> <b>tolerant</b> if a maintenance program has been implemented that will result in the detection and repair of accidental damage, corrosion and fatigue cracking before such damage reduces the residual strength of the structure below an acceptable limit.|$|E
50|$|These {{carbides}} and nitrides possess unusual {{combination of}} chemical, physical, electrical, and mechanical properties, exhibiting both metallic and ceramic characteristics under various conditions. These include high electrical and thermal conductivity, thermal shock resistance, damage tolerance, machinability, high elastic stiffness, and {{low thermal expansion}} coefficients. Some MAX phases are also highly resistant to chemical attack (e.g. Ti3SiC2) and high-temperature oxidation in air (Ti2AlC, Cr2AlC, and Ti3AlC2). They are useful in technologies involving high efficiency engines, <b>damage</b> <b>tolerant</b> thermal systems, increasing fatigue resistance, and retention of rigidity at high temperatures. These properties {{can be related to}} the electronic structure and chemical bonding in the MAX phases. It can be described as periodic alteration of high and low electron density regions. This allows for design of other nanolaminates based on the electronic structure similarities, such as Mo2BC and PdFe3N.|$|E
50|$|The {{main rotor}} is {{mounted in the}} {{midsection}} of the fuselage, consisting {{of a total of}} five blades. From 1994 through 2001, the deputy chief engineer of CAIC, Mr. Li Meng (李萌) led the team to successfully develop the main rotor for Z-10, winning two patents in the process. The main rotor blade, Type 95KT composite rotor blade was a top priority of the 8th 5-yr plan that first began in that era, {{and it was one of}} the ten critical technologies of Z-10. China never had such advanced technology and Mr. Li Meng had to lead his team to develop it on their own, and finished the job ahead of schedule. The early successful completion not only enabled Z-10 to fly a full year ahead of the schedule, but Type 95KT blades have also been widely used afterward in new helicopters and upgrading old helicopters. Spheriflex Rotor Head is the type which Z-10 used with flaw <b>damage</b> <b>tolerant</b> design, lowest vibration level in its class even at high speed, easy maintenance, excellent manoeuvrability and stability.|$|E

40|$|Age forming of Al based alloys for <b>damage</b> <b>tolerant</b> {{applications}} {{requires an}} alloy with good age formability and good post-forming mechanical properties. To investigate optimisation of this balance, several newly designed Al–Cu–Mg–Li (Mn, Zr, Sc) alloys {{were subjected to}} artificial ageing representative of age forming. It was seen that combinations of yield strength and fatigue crack growth resistance could be achieved that are at least comparable to the incumbent <b>damage</b> <b>tolerant</b> material for such applications, whilst creep rates at the ageing temperatures applied were better than those achieved in commercially applied age forming processes of heat treatable Al based alloys. Coarse grain structure and high Li content are associated with good fatigue crack growth resistance but reduce age formability. The underlying physical aspects responsible for the balance between creep rates and resulting properties are discussed.

40|$|With {{advanced}} composites increasing replacing traditional metallic materials, {{the material}} inhomogeneity and inherent anisotropy of such materials lead {{to not only}} new attributes for aerospace structures, but also introduce new technology to <b>damage</b> <b>tolerant</b> design and analysis. The deleterious effects of changes in material properties and initiation and growth of structural damage must be addressed. The anisotropic and brittle properties make this requirement a challenging to composite structural designers. Accurate, reliable and user-friendly computational methods, design and analysis methods are vital for more <b>damage</b> <b>tolerant</b> composite structures. Both durability and <b>damage</b> <b>tolerant</b> methodologies must address the possible changes in mechanical properties and the evolving damage accumulations that may occur during the vehicle’s service lifetime. Delamination is a major failure mode in laminated composites and has received much research attention. It may arise out of manufacturing defects, free edge effects, structural discontinuities, low and high velocity impact damage, and even bird strikes.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedIn the 1950 s and 1960 s, the North American X- 15 rocket powered aircraft was pioneering the concepts and principles {{that would come}} to define modern powered flight. Among the ground breaking ideas proposed was a system of adaptive controls, or a controller that would {{take into consideration the}} changing operational environment to deliver appropriate control to the operator. Limitations of current technology abounded, leaving the X- 15 with a successful, but severely limited adaptive control system. Since then, many limitations have fallen away, allowing for the first time employment of adaptive controls on a large scale. The nature of adaptive controls, or controls for unpredictable systems, lends itself naturally to the concept of <b>damage</b> <b>tolerant</b> controls in high performing systems, such as aircraft and spacecraft. Recent technical demonstrations of <b>damage</b> <b>tolerant</b> aircraft prove the concept of adaptive controls in an operational environment.

40|$|This work aims at {{improving}} the resilience and <b>damage</b> <b>tolerant</b> properties of CFRP by using cork, {{which is a}} natural material with good energy absorption capacity and thermal insulating and vibration damping characteristics. Two types of materials were considered: a sandwich formed by carbon-epoxy facesheets with a cork-epoxy core and a carbon-epoxy laminate with embedded cork granulates. The <b>damage</b> <b>tolerant</b> properties were evaluated by low velocity impact tests according {{to the type of}} material. Additionally, this work intends to evaluate the feasibility of using a cork agglomerate combined with CFRP in a sandwich configuration in order to improve the aeroelastic properties of certain types of aerospace components aiming at preventing the occurrence of damage due to flutter.

40|$|Robust {{design is}} a design {{philosophy}} {{that aims to}} ensure that a structure will be tolerant to un-known variations and imperfections in the design. While safety factors do provide a tolerance to variability and uncertainty in the analysis, they do not offer any indication of the sensitivity of a de-sign due to these uncertainty factors. This is an important consideration as highly optimised critical structures are required to survive unexpected loading and operating conditions. In many ways, robust design appears to be similar to <b>damage</b> <b>tolerant</b> design but there are distinct differences between the design philosophies. While there is a wealth of knowledge and applications relating to <b>damage</b> <b>tolerant</b> design, robust design is still not fully understood in structural design. A stiffened composite panel has been analysed for damage tolerance and robustness properties. Damage tolerance has been studied under experimentation with the panel subjected to impact damage while robustness has been assessed using finite elements and a Robust Index.

Force/absorbed energy-time plots were generated for each impact test. The specimens were cross-sectionally analyzed to record the damage corresponding to each impact energy level. Maximum force of impact versus impact energy plots were constructed to compare the various systems for impact damage resistance.

40|$|The general {{aim of this}} PhD {{study is}} to {{investigate}} the <b>damage</b> <b>tolerant</b> properties of aircraft carbon/epoxy laminates and bonded joints reinforced with z-pins. Much remains unknown about the efficacy and strengthening mechanisms by which z-pins improve the <b>damage</b> <b>tolerant</b> properties of composite structures, and this PhD aims to advance the current state-of-art by a combined experimental and analytical investigation. Specifically, the PhD examines the barely visible impact damage resistance and post-impact (<b>damage</b> <b>tolerant)</b> properties of z-pinned carbon/epoxy laminates. The project aims to determine the influences of key parameters (such as the impact energy, laminate ply stacking pattern and volume fraction of z-pins) on the impact damage resistance, post-impact compression stiffness, strength and fatigue properties, and interlaminar toughening mechanics of carbon/epoxy laminate panels. In addition, the PhD investigates the effects of tensile and compressive pre-loading on the impact damage tolerance of z-pinned laminates. These research studies provide original findings about the capacity of z-pins to increase the damage tolerance of aircraft laminate panels (such as wing or fuselage skin sections) against barely visible impact damage events. Another important aim of the PhD project {{is to determine the}} damage tolerance of z-pinned carbon/epoxy joints. The project investigates the structural properties, impact damage resistance, damage tolerance, and toughening mechanisms of T-shaped bonded joints and single lap joints reinforced with z-pins. This research aims to understand the capacity of z-pins to resist delamination cracking along the bond-line of aircraft joints, which results in improved damage tolerance. A final objective of the PhD is to undertake a holistic assessment of the implications of z-pin reinforcement on the design of damage-tolerant aircraft composite structures. Z-pins increase the delamination and <b>damage</b> <b>tolerant</b> properties of composites, but often at the expense of structural properties such as in-plane stiffness, strength and fatigue performance.
