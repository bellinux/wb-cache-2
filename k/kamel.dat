5|$|Ben Arfa {{was born}} in the Paris suburb of Clamart, and was raised in Châtenay-Malabry. His father <b>Kamel</b> Ben Arfa, a former Tunisian {{international}} footballer, arrived in France in 1973 settling in Saint-Michel, Aisne to work in a foundry. He later starred for a local club in the commune. Ben Arfa describes himself as a moderately practising Muslim.|$|E
5|$|On 19 December 1914, Abbas Helmi II was deposed by the United Kingdom {{while he}} was on a visit to Vienna due to his anti-British stance. The British severed Egypt's nominal ties to the Ottoman Empire, thus ending the country's status as a khedivate. Prime Minister Hussein Rushdi Pasha served as acting head of state until Abbas Helmi II's half-uncle Hussein <b>Kamel</b> was chosen as the country's new monarch. For a brief while, the British had {{considered}} putting an end to the Muhammad Ali Dynasty and installing Aga Khan III as ruler. Hussein <b>Kamel</b> took the title of Sultan of Egypt (preceded by the untranslatable style of Sa Hautesse), thereby putting him on an equal footing with the Ottoman Sultan. However, the end of nominal Ottoman suzerainty over Egypt did not result in genuine independence; the Sultanate of Egypt was a British protectorate where real power lay in the hand of the High Commissioner.|$|E
5|$|Ben Arfa {{was born}} into a family with a {{football}} history. His father was the former Tunisian international footballer <b>Kamel</b> Ben Arfa. Ben Arfa began his career in France at ASV Châtenay-Malabry. After two years at the club, he moved a few miles north to Montrouge CF 92. In 1998, Ben Arfa joined sporting club AC Boulogne-Billancourt. The following year, he was selected to attend the Clairefontaine academy. While at Clairefontaine, he was a part of A la Clairefontaine, a documentary series which chronicled the lives of some of France's top young footballers during their time at the academy. During the series, an episode showed Ben Arfa getting into an argument with Abou Diaby. While training at Clairefontaine during the weekdays, he played for FC Versailles on the weekends.|$|E

5|$|Dr. Charles Kroger (Stanley <b>Kamel)</b> {{arrives at}} his office and finds Adrian Monk (Tony Shalhoub) and Harold Krenshaw (Tim Bagley) arguing over who should get the {{following}} session. They enter the office and find Teresa Mueller (Lisa Dempsey), the building's cleaning lady, dead, {{and some of the}} patient files scattered. Captain Stottlemeyer (Ted Levine) and Lieutenant Disher (Jason Gray-Stanford) suspect that one of Dr. Kroger's patients was responsible. Dr. Kroger says it can be Joseph Wheeler (Kevin Fry), who threatened him in the past. Dr. Kroger blames himself for not predicting the murder, and decides to retire. Wheeler, however, is dismissed as a suspect as he has a confirmed alibi.|$|E
5|$|While a man, Jack Leverett (Greg Grunberg), is {{cheating}} {{on his wife}} with a woman named Michelle Cullman (Susan Ward), he finds a hidden camera and, fighting for the camera, kills her. The following day, Monk (Tony Shalhoub) announces to his therapist, Dr. Charles Kroger (Stanley <b>Kamel),</b> he will go on his first vacation since {{the murder of his}} wife, Trudy. Later, Monk goes to the crime scene to investigate and is informed by Captain Stottlemeyer (Ted Levine) and Lieutenant Disher (Jason Gray-Stanford) that a film about him will be produced. As method actor David Ruskin (Stanley Tucci)—set to play Monk in the film—is there to observe his mannerism, Monk tries to impress him.|$|E
5|$|After some time, {{they decided}} that the best method of {{featuring}} a vacuum bag {{was to have a}} cleaning lady vacuuming up the evidence. Whereas cleaning ladies had already been the murder victims of several previous episodes, here it seemed absolutely necessary if they wanted an episode to have a realistic plot. However, the writers believed that having a maid as the victim required a main character to work with in order to give some personal involvement. Monk was not considered mostly because he does not have a cleaning lady, and if he did, she would never be good enough for him because of his germophobia and meticulousness. It was eventually decided that the maid would be Dr. Kroger's employee. The idea of having her work for Dr. Kroger was successful, because the writers had been looking to have an episode where <b>Kamel</b> would be the focus.|$|E

5|$|Aldwyn Sappleton was {{the sole}} Jamaican {{representative}} in the men's 800meters race during the Beijing Olympics. Born in Saint Ann Parish, {{which is the largest}} parish in Jamaica and is situated on the northern coast, Sappleton was 26 {{years old at the time}} of his participation in the Beijing Olympics. He had not previously competed in any Olympic events. During the August 20 qualification round, Sappleton was placed in the seventh heat, which included seven athletes. He placed sixth with a time of 1:48.19. Kyrgyzstan's Sergei Pakura ranked behind Sappleton (1:50.54), while Senegal's Abdoulaye Wagne ranked directly ahead of him (1:47.50). The Jamaican runner's heat was led by Kuwait's Mohammad Al-Azemi, Bahrain's Yusuf Saad <b>Kamel,</b> and the Netherlands' Robert Lathouwers, who tied for first (1:46.94). Out of the 58 finishing athletes, Sappleton tied Jakub Holusa of the Czech Republic for 41st place. He did not advance to the semifinal round on August 21.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{fall-out}} between Ramsay and A-Z Restaurants over Wareing's contract at L'Oranger, {{which saw}} Ramsay quit Aubergine to open Restaurant Gordon Ramsay, Wareing followed suit by leaving L'Oranger, forcing the restaurant into temporary closure. A-Z Restaurants commenced legal proceedings against the pair, and reopened L’Oranger with Wareing's former sous chef, <b>Kamel</b> Benamar, {{as the new}} head chef. The legal case ended in Ramsay and Wareing paying an out-of-court settlement to the Restaurant group. Ramsay and Wareing worked together to open Pétrus in 1999, with Wareing becoming head chef and operating the restaurant on behalf of Gordon Ramsay Holdings (GRH), at 33 St James's Street, London. The name came from the French wine Pétrus, which was Ramsay's and Wareing's favourite. Wareing promptly regained the Michelin star he had previously held, with Pétrus being named as a one star restaurant seven months after opening.|$|E
5|$|Two Egyptian archers, {{one male}} and one female, {{qualified}} for the Olympics, both of whom earned their berths at the 2012 African Archery Championships. Ahmed El-Nemr finished second at that tournament, behind Philippe Kouassi of Côte d'Ivoire, and entered the men's individual event. El-Nemr had won three medals at the 2011 Pan Arab Games, gold in the individual recurve 90 metres and silver in the individual recurve FITA and the team event.

50|$|Through <b>Kamel's</b> labours, the Jesuit College in Manila {{soon became}} the most reputed one in the Philippines, as his {{treatment}} was sought by persons of high authority. At the same time, observing the Christian ideals of charity, he supplied remedies {{to the poor and}} the indigenous people for free. <b>Kamel's</b> reputation fast extended even beyond the Philippine Islands, as he entered into scholarly correspondence with learned men both in Europe and Asia. Namely, he exchanged letters, information and specimens with Willem ten Rhijne, a Dutch botanist in Batavia; Samuel Browne and Edward Bulkley, two English surgeons in Madras; and two members of the Royal Society, the apothecary James Petiver and the naturalist John Ray.|$|R

25|$|An {{extensive}} tramway {{network was}} built in 1860 and is the oldest in Africa. The network begins at the El Raml district {{in the west and}} ends in the Victoria district in the east. Most of the vehicles are blue in color. Some smaller yellow-colored vehicles have further routes beyond the two main endpoints. The tram routes have one of four numbers: 1, 2, 5, and 6. All four start at El Raml, but only two (1 and 2) reach Victoria. There are two converging and diverging points. The first starts at Bolkly (Isis) and ends at San Stefano. The other begins at Sporting and ends at Mostafa <b>Kamel.</b> Route 5 starts at San Stefano and takes the inner route to Bolkly. Route 6 starts at Sidi Gaber El Sheikh in the outer route between Sporting and Mustafa <b>Kamel.</b> Route 1 takes the inner route between San Stefano and Bolkly and the outer route between Sporting and Mustafa <b>Kamel.</b> Route 2 takes the route opposite to Route 1 in both these areas. The tram fares are 25 piastres (0.25 pounds) during most of the day, and 50 piastres (0.50 pounds) after 9pm. Some trams (that date back the 30s) charge a pound. The tram is considered the cheapest method of public transport.|$|E
5000|$|With {{nationalist}} sentiment rising, Britain formally recognized Egyptian {{independence in}} 1922, and Hussein <b>Kamel's</b> successor, Sultan Fuad I, substituted {{the title of}} King for Sultan. However, British occupation and interference in Egyptian affairs persisted. Of particular concern to Egypt was Britain's continual efforts to divest Egypt of all control in Sudan. To both the King and the nationalist movement, this was intolerable, and the Egyptian Government {{made a point of}} stressing that Fuad and his son King Farouk I were [...] "King of Egypt and Sudan".|$|R
50|$|<b>Kamel's</b> {{species was}} most likely Kalanchoe ceratophylla as he {{describes}} the plant as having deeply divided leaves.

Kitchingia is now regarded as a synonym for Kalanchoe, whereas some botanists treat Bryophyllum as a separate genus.|$|R
50|$|He {{attended}} the French Jesuit College de Sainte Familie in Cairo for his {{primary and secondary}} education, and received his Medical Degree from Cairo University. While attending Cairo University, Sadek had to hide his Christianity from his professors by omitting his grandfather's name and using his great-grandfather's instead; going by Sadek Kamil Ibrahim Hilal rather than Sadek Kamil Boutros Hilal. As fair, blue-eyed Christians of Syrian and Lebanese descent, the family faced regular discrimination from Egyptian society and institutions.
