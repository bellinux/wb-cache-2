5|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) has one task: sign routine documents. Unfortunately, it's a month {{where three}} {{separate}} sets of paperwork are due {{at the same}} time, so Michael mulishly ignores his workload. To procrastinate, Michael makes Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) update <b>emergency</b> <b>contact</b> information of the staff. When Michael gets Ryan's cell phone number, he constantly prank calls Ryan with crude impersonations of Michael Jackson, Mike Tyson, and Saddam Hussein.|$|E
5|$|Several hundred {{homes were}} {{inundated}} by the flood in Fairbanks, Salcha, unincorporated Fairbanks North Star Borough, Nenana, and smaller villages, {{but due to}} early warnings from the National Weather Service, volunteer fire departments, and the borough's <b>emergency</b> <b>contact</b> system, no one was injured. The area affected by the flood was declared a state disaster area, making residents whose homes were flooded eligible for state aid.

Regina and Sheriff Graham (Jamie Dornan) have also shown up, since Regina is the <b>emergency</b> <b>contact</b> for John Doe.

As Regina takes Henry home, Emma, Mary Margaret, and the sheriff decide to investigate what happened and visit the security room.

5|$|Generating {{alternative}} behaviours {{that the}} person can engage in instead of self-harm is one successful behavioural method that is employed to avoid self-harm. Techniques, aimed at keeping busy, may include journaling, taking a walk, participating in sports or exercise or being around friends when the person has the urge to harm themselves. The removal of objects used for self-harm from easy reach is also helpful for resisting self-harming urges. The provision of a card that allows the person to make <b>emergency</b> <b>contact</b> with counselling services should the urge to self-harm arise may also help prevent the act of self-harm. Alternative and safer methods of self-harm that do not lead to permanent damage, for example the snapping of a rubber band on the wrist, may also help calm the urge to self-harm. Using biofeedback may help raise self-awareness of certain pre-occupations or particular mental state or mood that precede bouts of self-harming behaviour, and help identify techniques to avoid those pre-occupations before they lead to self-harm. Any avoidance or coping strategy must be appropriate to the individual's motivation and reason for harming.|$|E

The phone entry (or entries) should supplement or complement written (such as wallet, bracelet, or necklace) information or indicators. The programme was conceived in the mid-2000s and promoted by British paramedic Bob Brotchie in May 2005. It encourages people to enter <b>emergency</b> <b>contacts</b> in their mobile phone address book under the name [...] "ICE". Alternatively, a person can list multiple <b>emergency</b> <b>contacts</b> as [...] "ICE1", [...] "ICE2", etc. The popularity of the program has spread across Europe and Australia, and it has started to grow into North America.|$|R

The two decide to get a divorce, however, they use their marriage to get the upper hand over one another. Ultimately, Jack and Liz decide to stop their feud and get a divorce.

2500|$|US {{officials}} repeatedly questioned Arar {{about his}} connection to certain members of al-Qaeda. His interrogators also claimed that Arar was {{an associate of}} Abdullah Almalki, the Syrian-born Ottawa man whom they suspected of having links to al-Qaeda, and they therefore suspected Arar of being an al-Qaeda member himself. When Arar protested that he only had a casual relationship with Almalki, having once worked with Almalki's brother at an Ottawa high-tech firm, the officials produced a copy of Arar's 1997 rental lease which Almalki had co-signed. The fact that US officials had a Canadian document in their possession was later widely interpreted {{as evidence of the}} participation by Canadian authorities in Arar's detention.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Emergency {{departments}} (EDs) {{are increasingly}} overcrowded by walk-in patients. However, {{little is known}} about health-economic consequences resulting from long waiting times and inefficient use of specialised resources. We have evaluated a quality improvement project of a Swiss urban hospital: In 2009, a triage system and a hospital-associated primary care unit with General Practitioners (H-GP-unit) were implemented beside the conventional hospital ED. This resulted in improved medical service provision with reduced process times and more efficient diagnostic testing. We now report on health-economic effects. METHODS: From the hospital perspective, we performed a cost comparison study analysing treatment costs in the old emergency model (ED, only) versus treatment costs in the new emergency model (triage plus ED plus H-GP-unit) from 2007 to 2011. Hospital cost accounting data were applied. All consecutive outpatient <b>emergency</b> <b>contacts</b> were included for 1 month in each follow-up year. RESULTS: The annual number of outpatient <b>emergency</b> <b>contacts</b> increased from n= 10 440 (2007; baseline) to n= 16 326 (2011; after intervention), reflecting a general trend. In 2007, mean treatment costs per outpatient were € 358 (95...|$|R
40|$|Background: Community-care {{networks}} are {{a partnership between}} the local police force, housing corporations, general social services, specialised home care and mental healthcare services. The networks were set up to improve the healthcare for patients with (chronic) psychiatric problems through local cooperation between different agencies operating in underprivileged areas. Objective: To evaluate the effects of community-care networks on psychiatric <b>emergency</b> <b>contacts,</b> hospitalisation and involuntary admission. Design: An ecological intervention design was used, comparing neighbourhoods with and without a community-care network. Mean numbers and standardised ratios of psychiatric <b>emergency</b> <b>contacts,</b> hospitalisation rates and involuntary admissions were assessed over a 10 -year period, covering the early stages and the years in which community-care networks were fully operational. Setting: Underprivileged neighbourhoods {{in the city of}} Rotterdam, The Netherlands. Patients: Inhabitants aged 20 – 64 years living in these neighbourhoods. Results: Standardised ratios for <b>contact</b> with psychiatric <b>emergency</b> services were higher in the neighbourhoods where community-care networks were set up (standardised ratios = 137, 95 % CI 121 to 145 in the network neighbourhoods vs standardised ratios = 107, 95 % CI 96 to 119 in the contro...|$|R
