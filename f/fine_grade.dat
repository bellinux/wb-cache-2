2500|$|Colin Williams, of Williams Brothers Asphalt Paving Co. of Ionia, Michigan {{provided}} the Club with a surety bond, a dump truck, a front-end loader and a bulldozer plus operators {{to run the}} equipment which was used to build the grade. [...] Club members then tore up the track next to the engine and laid it down behind the engine. [...] The engine was then rolled down the tracks. [...] Chuck Julian, Dave Jones, an equipment operator from Williams Brothers, Dick Grieves, {{and a group of}} Hmong refugees who volunteered their time, then spent the next three days with the Williams Brothers equipment restoring the site, including casting a new concrete sidewalk. [...] Williams Brothers sent a grader from Ionia to <b>fine</b> <b>grade</b> the site after they were done with the bulk cleanup, including loading debris into the dump truck and rails onto a flatbed and hauling all of it to Ionia.|$|E
2500|$|With England and France {{mired in}} the Hundred Years War and its {{aftermath}} and then the English Wars of the Roses {{through most of the}} 15th century, European fashion north of the Alps was dominated by the glittering court of the Duchy of Burgundy, especially under the fashion-conscious power-broker Philip the Good (ruled 1419–1469). [...] Having added Holland and Flanders to their dominion, the Dukes of Burgundy had access to the latest fabrics of Italy and the East and to English wool exports through the great trading cities of Bruges and Antwerp. [...] Purchases of fabrics through Italian merchants like the two cousins Giovanni Arnolfini amounted to a noticeable proportion of all government expenditure. [...] Especially in Florence, where sumptuary laws prevented the citizens from wearing the most luxurious cloths on which the city's fortunes were built, the materials of men's clothing in particular often appear plain in paintings, but contemporaries who understood the difference in grades of cloth very well would have appreciated the beauty and great expense of a very <b>fine</b> <b>grade.</b>|$|E

50|$|Yttrium oxide {{is used as}} the stabilizer. This {{material}} is predominantly tetragonal in structure. Y-TZP has the highest flexural strength of all the zirconia based materials. The fine grain size of Y-TZP lends itself {{to be used in}} cutting tools where a very sharp edge can be achieved and maintained due to its high wear resistance. It is considered to be the first true polycrystalline ceramic shown to be superplastic with a 3-mol %Y-TZP (3Y-TZP), which is now considered to be the model ceramic system.The <b>fine</b> <b>grade</b> size leads to a very dense, non-porous ceramic with excellent mechanical strength, corrosion resistance, impact toughness, thermal shock resistance and very low thermal conductivity.
