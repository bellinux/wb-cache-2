5|$|It {{has never}} been fully {{explained}} what motivated the attack: the gunmen {{claimed to have been}} acting on their own initiative, and despite abundant conspiracy theories, no convincing evidence surfaced to suggest that any political leader or party was behind the attack. Nevertheless, the killings left a leadership void in the political establishment. Conspiracy theories immediately flourished that the gunmen had been acting on orders to sabotage a Karabakh peace deal, but a decade on, the available evidence still pointed to the leading gunman being a loner with a <b>grudge</b> <b>against</b> the Armenian political elite.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the main}} {{characters}} in the game hold a significant <b>grudge</b> <b>against</b> the Empire and, in particular, Kefka Palazzo, who serves {{as one of the}} game's main antagonists along with Emperor Gestahl. The supporting character Ultros serves as a recurring villain and comic relief throughout the game.

5|$|The general's objectivity, however, {{has often}} been questioned. Vlahogiannis, in his preface to the Memoirs, praises his honesty and {{contrasts}} it to his lack of objectivity and impartiality. While always straightforward, Makriyannis clearly holds a <b>grudge</b> <b>against</b> people he had come into conflict with. He often uses disparaging language against people like Kolokotronis, while staying silent about the more questionable deeds of people he had a favourable opinion of. According to Sphyroeras, however, his judgements do not stem from selfishness, but rather from his severity against those he considered were defaming the cause of Greece.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} Al Khawalid {{dates to the}} 1920s, when the Khalids opposed the British-led {{administrative}} reforms and launched a military crackdown on the Shia who supported the reforms. The perpetrators were later put before a court that sentenced them to exile. They gradually returned to Bahrain, where they were kept outside government despite developing personal relations with those in power. They regained some influence since the late 1960s, but remained outside the inner decision-making circle. During this period, {{senior members of the}} Khalids were critical of the ruling family, opposed political reforms and held a <b>grudge</b> <b>against</b> the British.|$|E

The invasion brings Norris and Grobyc to the islands, a heartful commander of an elite force and a prototype cyborg soldier, respectively, as they too seek the Frozen Flame.|$|E
50|$|Although no one {{was ever}} convicted in his murder, most {{believed}} that George Evans had been paid to murder Duggan {{by a group of}} men who held <b>grudges</b> <b>against</b> him from years earlier.

50|$|Dingler, however, {{performed}} at the potluck for nearly 27 years, doing the same material, performance after performance.

Doggett sees this as disrespectful and expresses a wish to kill Chapman. The two have a confrontation {{at the end of the}} season's final episode. Doggett attacks Chapman with a shiv made from a wooden cross; Chapman throws Doggett to the ground and hits her repeatedly.|$|E

The Tangut Western Xia ruled parts of the western China, while the Song Dynasty reigned over the south. The Mongols subjugated Western Xia in 1210. In that same year, the Mongols renounced their vassalage to the Jin. Hostilities between the Jin and Mongols had been building up. The Mongols coveted the prosperity of Jurchen territory.

25|$|Canada is {{much more}} {{tolerance}} towards Russia, due to Canada's non-interference policy and Canada doesn't hold many <b>grudges</b> <b>against</b> Russia, however, as for the result of Russian expansionism and irredentism, and Canada's aligned political ties with the U.S., some Canadians hold a grudge and are hostile against Russia. There was even an incident when a Russian orchestra was boycotted in Canada.|$|R
500|$|The {{remainder}} of the plot focuses of an even older faction of Immortals led by Huey's mentor and former lover, Renee Paramedes Branvillier detailed {{their relationship with the}} 1711 immortals from the 1700s till the later 1930s and how the corporation Nebula involves themselves against the other crime families by allying themselves with Senator Manfred Beriam, who bears malevolent <b>grudges</b> <b>against</b> immortals.|$|R
5|$|Hayes {{issued an}} {{executive}} order that forbade federal office holders from being required to make campaign contributions or otherwise taking part in party politics. Chester A. Arthur, the Collector of the Port of New York, and his subordinates Alonzo B. Cornell and George H. Sharpe, all Conkling supporters, refused to obey the president's order. Sherman agreed with Hayes that the three had to resign, but he made clear {{in a letter to}} Arthur that he had no personal <b>grudge</b> <b>against</b> the Collector. In September 1877, Hayes demanded the three men's resignations, which they refused to give. He submitted appointments to the Senate for confirmation as their replacements but the Senate's Commerce Committee, which Conkling chaired, voted unanimously to reject the nominees.|$|E
5|$|In July 2015, FUNCINPEC {{announced}} {{the formation of}} the Cambodian Royalist Youth Movement, a youth organisation aimed at garnering electoral support for the party from younger voters. Meanwhile, tension persisted between Nhek Bun Chhay and Ranariddh, which erupted into a public spat, as Ranariddh threatened to expelled Nhek Bun Chhay who in turn, accused the party president of holding a <b>grudge</b> <b>against</b> him. Subsequently, on 3 February 2016, Nhek Bun Chhay announced that he was quitting the party, and went on to form his new party, the Khmer National United Party (KNUP). The KNUP adopted a logo which was similar to a former logo of FUNCINPEC, featuring the Cambodian Independence Monument.

500|$|It {{seems that}} some of the FA's {{officials}} had long held <b>grudges</b> <b>against</b> Ramsey. [...] The British journalist and author Leo McKinstry said [...] "England's most successful manager would have had a legacy fit for a hero {{had it not been for}} the malevolence of the FA chief Harold Thompson".

5|$|Rejtan's {{dramatic}} {{attempt to}} prevent the partition earned him lasting recognition in Poland, one that began even during the proceedings, as he was lauded by some other deputies. His action was also praised as patriotic and respectable by the Prussian and Russian military commanders in Warsaw, who offered him a military escort {{to protect him from}} some confederates (particularly Poniński was holding a <b>grudge</b> <b>against</b> him). Soon, brochures and newspaper articles spread the information about his patriotic gesture throughout Poland and abroad. During the Great Sejm of 1788–92, a decree was passed, commending Rejtan, and deputies discussed a project to put a plaque to his name in the Sejm Chambers. His gesture in the Sejm was less famously repeated by Jan Suchorzewski during that period.|$|E
5|$|Richard's {{most loyal}} subject was John Howard, 1st Duke of Norfolk. The duke had served Richard's brother {{for many years}} and had been one of Edward IV's closer confidants. He was a {{military}} veteran, having fought in the Battle of Towton in 1461 and served as Hastings' deputy at Calais in 1471. Ross speculates that he may have borne a <b>grudge</b> <b>against</b> Edward for depriving him of a fortune. Norfolk was due to inherit a share of the wealthy Mowbray estate on the death of eight-year-old Anne de Mowbray, the last of her family. However, Edward convinced Parliament to circumvent the law of inheritance and transfer the estate to his younger son, who was married to Anne. Consequently, Howard supported Richard III in deposing Edward's sons, for which he received the dukedom of Norfolk and his original share of the Mowbray estate.|$|E
5|$|Still {{carrying}} a <b>grudge</b> <b>against</b> Robbit, Aloha seeks Kabuki and convinces him {{to form an}} alliance {{so that they can}} destroy Robbit together. In exchange, Aloha will pay Kabuki a large amount of money, and Kabuki, also desiring revenge against Robbit, agrees. Aloha and Kabuki attack Little Muu together, prompting Robbit to take action again. Eventually, Robbit and Kabuki battle each other one last time, and Robbit manages to destroy Kabuki once and for all while Aloha flees for his life once again. At the end of the game, Aloha returns to Little Muu, but is disowned by all the Muu Muus, who now resent him for teaming with Kabuki (who had tried to destroy them all) and trying to destroy Robbit, who had saved their lives. They throw him out of the bar and tell him to never come back.|$|E
