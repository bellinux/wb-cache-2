5|$|Ants {{are active}} {{all year long}} in the tropics, but, in cooler regions, they survive the winter {{in a state of}} <b>dormancy</b> known as hibernation. The forms of {{inactivity}} are varied and some temperate species have larvae going into the inactive state (diapause), while in others, the adults alone pass the winter in a state of reduced activity.|$|E
5|$|Both {{plant and}} animal life endemic to snow-bound areas develop ways to adapt. Among the {{adaptive}} mechanisms for plants are <b>dormancy,</b> seasonal dieback, survival of seeds; and for animals are hibernation, insulation, anti-freeze chemistry, storing food, drawing on reserves from within the body, and clustering for mutual heat.|$|E
5|$|Great mullein is a {{biennial}} {{and generally}} requires winter <b>dormancy</b> {{before it can}} flower. This <b>dormancy</b> is linked to starch degradation activated by low temperatures in the root, and gibberellin application bypasses this requirement. Seeds germinate almost solely in bare soil, at temperatures between 10°C and 40°C. While they can germinate in total darkness if proper conditions are present (tests give a 35% germination rate under ideal conditions), in the wild, they in practice only do so when exposed to light, or {{very close to the}} soil surface, which explains the plant's habitat preferences. While it can also grow in areas where some vegetation already exists, growth of the rosettes on bare soil is four to seven times more rapid.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, housing {{was built}} on the former brewery site. After a period of <b>dormancy,</b> the Old Maltings reopened as a children's day nursery in 2007, and a school and {{community}} centre was opened alongside the nursery in 2011. The Maltings College sixth form opened at the site in 2013.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{conserve}} {{energy and water}} in their highly seasonal environment, mouse lemurs and dwarf lemurs exhibit seasonal behavioral cycles of <b>dormancy</b> where the metabolic rate and body temperature are lowered. They are the only primates known to do so. They accumulate fat reserves in their hind legs and the base of their tail before the dry winter season, when food and water are scarce, and can exhibit daily and prolonged torpor during the dry season. Daily torpor constitutes less than 24 hours of <b>dormancy,</b> whereas prolonged torpor averages two weeks in duration and signals hibernation. Mouse lemurs have been observed experiencing torpor that lasts for several consecutive days, but dwarf lemurs are known to hibernate for six to eight months every year, particularly {{on the west coast}} of Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|Other lemurs {{that do not}} exhibit <b>dormancy</b> {{conserve}} {{energy by}} selecting thermoregulated microhabitats (such as tree holes), sharing nests, and reducing exposed body surfaces, such as by hunched sitting and group huddling. Also, the ring-tailed lemur, ruffed lemurs, and sifakas are commonly seen sunning, thus using solar radiation to warm their bodies instead of metabolic heat.|$|E
5|$|Plants {{and animals}} {{living in the}} desert need special adaptations {{to survive in the}} harsh environment. Plants tend to be tough and wiry with small or no leaves, {{water-resistant}} cuticles and often spines to deter herbivory. Some annual plants germinate, bloom and die {{in the course of a}} few weeks after rainfall while other long-lived plants survive for years and have deep root systems able to tap underground moisture. Animals need to keep cool and find enough food and water to survive. Many are nocturnal and stay in the shade or underground during the heat of the day. They tend to be efficient at conserving water, extracting most of their needs from their food and concentrating their urine. Some animals remain in a state of <b>dormancy</b> for long periods, ready to become active again when the rare rains fall. They then reproduce rapidly while conditions are favorable before returning to <b>dormancy.</b>|$|E
5|$|Temperate sundews: These species form a tight {{cluster of}} unfurled leaves called a hibernaculum in a winter <b>dormancy</b> period (= Hemicryptophyte). All of the North American and European species belong to this group. Drosera arcturi from Australia (including Tasmania) and New Zealand is another {{temperate}} species that dies {{back to a}} horn-shaped hibernaculum.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{opportunities}} for the applications of RNAi in crop science for its improvement such as stress tolerance and enhanced nutritional level. RNAi will prove its potential for inhibition of photorespiration to enhance the productivity of C3 plants. This knockdown technology {{may be useful in}} inducing early flowering, delayed ripening, delayed senescence, breaking <b>dormancy,</b> stress-free plants, overcoming self-sterility, etc.|$|E
5|$|Cultivation {{from seed}} may be {{difficult}} or easy, depending on the species. The more difficult species to grow include the ones that require a period of <b>dormancy</b> or smoke treatment to simulate a bushfire. Stylidium specimens should be grown in a medium that is kept moist and has a relatively low concentration of nutrients. It {{should also be noted}} that they appear to be sensitive to disturbance of their root systems. Minimization of such disturbance will likely result in healthier plants.|$|E
5|$|Geysers are fragile {{phenomena}} and if conditions change, they may go dormant or extinct. Many {{have been destroyed}} simply by people throwing debris into them while others have ceased to erupt due to dewatering by geothermal power plants. However, the Great Geysir of Iceland has had periods of activity and <b>dormancy.</b> During its long dormant periods, eruptions were sometimes artificially induced—often on special occasions—by the addition of surfactants to the water.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the lateral dispersion (by invertebrates and deer) there is also importance {{in the fact that}} burial (vertical dispersion) by ants (or other vectors) increases the survival of new plants by two mechanisms. First, vertical dispersion ensures sufficient depth to preserve the seeds through their <b>dormancy</b> (Trillium seeds are normally dormant for their first year). Second, vertical dispersion ensures adequate anchorage of the rhizomes. This is particularly important for young plants because their small rhizomes, with few & short roots, are easily dislodged (e.g. frost heaveal and other erosion factors) and desiccated.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs {{have low}} basal {{metabolic}} rates (BMR), which helps them to conserve energy {{during the dry}} season, when water and food are scarce. They can optimize their energy use by lowering their metabolic rate to 20% below the values predicted for mammals of similar body mass. The red-tailed sportive lemur (Lepilemur ruficaudatus), for instance, reportedly {{has one of the}} lowest metabolic rates among mammals. Its low metabolic rate may be linked to its generally folivorous diet and relatively small body mass. Lemurs exhibit behavioral adaptations to complement this trait, including sunning behaviors, hunched sitting, group huddling, and nest sharing, in order to reduce heat loss and conserve energy. Dwarf lemurs and mouse lemurs exhibit seasonal cycles of <b>dormancy</b> to conserve energy. Before dry season, they will accumulate fat in white adipose tissue located {{at the base of the}} tail and hind legs, doubling their weight. At the end of the dry season, their body mass may fall to half of what it was prior to the dry season. Lemurs that do not experience states of <b>dormancy</b> are also able to shut down aspects of their metabolism for energy conservation.|$|E
5|$|Reproduction is {{generally}} by allogamy (cross-pollination) and Hippeastrum may be propagated by seed or offset bulbils (bulblets), although commercial ventures use in vitro techniques, or splitting of the bulb into sections. The genus has been intensely bred and cultivated {{since the early}} nineteenth century to produce large colourful showy flowers. In temperate climes these can be placed outside in the summer, and after a <b>dormancy</b> period, be induced to rebloom inside in the winter.|$|E
5|$|The second eruptive period, the Cougar Stage, started 20,000 {{years ago}} and lasted for 2,000 years. Pyroclastic flows of hot pumice and ash along with dome growth {{occurred}} during this period. Another 5,000 years of <b>dormancy</b> followed, only to be upset {{by the beginning of}} the Swift Creek eruptive period, typified by pyroclastic flows, dome growth and blanketing of the countryside with tephra. Swift Creek ended 8,000 years ago.|$|E
5|$|At their 2007 meeting, the BCHL {{board of}} {{governors}} rejected moving the Williams Lake TimberWolves to Dawson Creek, but then voted to allow the move if the Burnaby Express (who was also seeking relocation) moved to Fort St. John. However, the Society {{was not able to}} recruit sufficient support in Fort St. John to form an ownership group and the Burnaby Express re-arranged its management and ownership so that it could stay in Burnaby. The Williams Lake TimberWolves, after one year of <b>dormancy,</b> relocated to Wenatchee, Washington. Efforts at relocating an Alberta Junior Hockey League team were also unsuccessful as no team expressed interest in moving at that time.|$|E
5|$|Drosera anglica {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely {{distributed}} sundews in the world. It is generally circumboreal, meaning that it is found at high latitudes around the globe. In a few areas, however, it is found farther south, particularly in Japan, southern Europe, the Hawaiian island of Kauai, and California. Plants from Hawaii, where it is known as mikinalo, are generally smaller than normal and do not experience a winter <b>dormancy</b> period. Its natural habitat includes 12 U.S. states, including Alaska, and 11 Canadian provinces and territories. The altitudinal range is from 5m to at least 2000m.|$|E
5|$|Seasonal {{rainfall}} {{patterns of}} the Western Ghats necessitate a period of <b>dormancy</b> for its land snails, resulting in their high abundance and diversity including at least 258 species of gastropods from 57 genera and 24 families. A total of 77 species of freshwater molluscs (52 gastropods and 25 bivalves) have been recorded from the Western Ghats, but the actual number is likely higher. This include 28 endemics. Among the threatened freshwater molluscs are the mussels Pseudomulleria dalyi, which is a Gondwanan relict, and the snail Cremnoconchus, which is restricted to the spray zone of waterfalls. According to the IUCN, 4 species of freshwater molluscs are considered endangered and 3 are vulnerable. An additional 19 species are considered data deficient.|$|E
5|$|The Chalukyas revived their {{fortunes}} in 973 after over 200 years of <b>dormancy</b> when {{much of the}} Deccan was {{under the rule of}} the Rashtrakutas. The genealogy of the kings of this empire is still debated. One theory, based on contemporary literary and inscriptional evidence plus the finding that the Western Chalukyas employed titles and names commonly used by the early Chalukyas, suggests that the Western Chalukya kings belonged to the same family line as the illustrious Badami Chalukya dynasty of the 6th century while other Western Chalukya inscriptional evidence indicates they were a distinct line unrelated to the Early Chalukyas.|$|E
5|$|Due to A. rubrums {{very wide}} range, there is {{significant}} variation in hardiness, size, form, time of flushing, onset of <b>dormancy,</b> and other traits. Generally speaking, individuals from the north flush the earliest, have the most reddish fall color, set their buds the earliest and take the least winter injury. Seedlings are tallest in the north-central and east-central part of the range. In Florida, at the extreme south of the red maple's range, it is limited exclusively to swamplands. The fruits also vary geographically with northern individuals in areas with brief, frost-free periods producing fruits that are shorter and heavier than their southern counterparts. As {{a result of the}} variation there is much genetic potential for breeding programs with a goal of producing red maples for cultivation. This is especially useful for making urban cultivars that require resistance from verticillium wilt, air pollution, and drought.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of Literary Hall in 1870, the Clinton Lodge Masons regularly utilized {{the first floor of}} the building as a meeting space, while the Romney Literary Society maintained its use of the second floor as a library. Between its various periods of <b>dormancy,</b> the Clinton Lodge and the associated Order of the Eastern Star, which was organized in July 1919, utilized Literary Hall as a meeting space, and following the Romney Literary Society's disestablishment, the Masons and Eastern Star continued their use of the building. In 1973, prominent Romney lawyer Ralph Haines purchased Literary Hall from the Clinton Lodge Masons and provided the lodge with a land lot for the construction of a new Masonic Temple at the corner of Washington and Center Streets in Romney. Following his purchase of Literary Hall, Haines used the historic building as a law office building and private museum. Literary Hall was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 29, 1979.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to most mountain ranges in British Columbia, the Itcha Range represents an inactive shield volcano. This highly dissected volcanic edifice {{consists of a}} variety of rock types, including basanite, hawaiite, trachyte, rhyolite, phonolite and alkali olivine basalt. They were deposited by different types of volcanic eruptions characterized by passive lava flows and explosivity. Two stages of eruptive activity have been identified at the volcano along with three sub-phases that are limited only to the first stage of development. The main body of the Itcha Range is between 3.8and 3.0million years old and thus over two million years ago it passed the most active shield stage of life. A period of <b>dormancy</b> lasting for almost a million years followed, which was interrupted by the post-shield stage of volcanism 2.2to 0.8million years ago. More recent volcanic activity in and around the Itcha Range might have occurred in the last 340,000years to produce cinder cones.|$|E
5|$|In early 2011, the Rage {{along with}} the Fresno Monsters, Wenatchee Wild, and Alaska Avalanche, all {{declared}} <b>dormancy</b> for various reasons, not committing to playing the next season; the Rage were pursuing entry into the AJHL. As the season was ending, the other teams in the division came out of dormancy; the Wenatchee team had their BCHL move denied and the Fresno Monsters were able to secure a lease agreement for their arena. The bid by the DC Rage Society to move the team into the AJHL, by purchasing {{the rights to the}} St. Albert Steel, failed as the Steel were moved to Whitecourt. While the team was achieving the expected levels of corporate sponsorship and had an average attendance of 1,010 people (13th best in the league of 28 teams), the Rage's costs (especially the travel costs) were higher than expected. In the first week of April 2012, a final appeal by the DC Rage Society to the City of Dawson Creek to cover certain fees was denied and the society announced the team was ending operations.|$|E
5|$|Like other requiem sharks, {{the milk}} shark is viviparous; females {{usually have a}} single {{functional}} ovary (on the left) and two functional uteruses divided into separate compartments for each embryo. The details of its life history vary across different parts of its range. Females generally produce young every year, though some give birth every other year or even every third year. Mating and parturition take place in spring or early summer (April to July) off western and southern Africa, and in winter off India, Alternately, off Oman parturition occurs year-round with a peak in spring. Parturition also occurs continuously in Australian waters; in the Herald Bight of Shark Bay, the number of newborns peaks in April and again in July. One proposed explanation {{for the lack of}} reproductive seasonality in these subpopulations is a lengthier and/or more complex reproductive cycle than has been detected (such as a period of <b>dormancy</b> in embryonic development, though there is presently no evidence of this occurring). Females do not store sperm internally.|$|E
5|$|The seeds {{maintain}} their germinative powers for decades, up {{to a hundred}} years, according to some studies. Because of this, and because the plant is an extremely prolific seed bearer (each plant produces hundreds of capsules, each containing up to 700+ seeds, with a total up to 180,000 or 240,000 seeds), it remains in the soil seed bank for extended periods of time, and can sprout from apparently bare ground, or shortly after forest fires long after previous plants have died. Its population pattern typically consists of an ephemeral adult population followed by {{a long period of}} <b>dormancy</b> as seeds. Great mullein rarely establishes on new grounds without human intervention because its seeds do not disperse very far. Seed dispersion requires the stem to be moved by wind or animal movement; 75% of the seeds fall within 1 m of the parent plant, and 93% fall within 5 m.|$|E
5|$|This {{cycle of}} growth and <b>dormancy</b> strings {{together}} volcanoes over millions of years, {{leaving a trail of}} volcanic islands and seamounts across the ocean floor. According to Wilson's theory, the Hawaiian volcanoes should be progressively older and increasingly eroded the further they are from the hotspot, and this is easily observable; the oldest rock in the main Hawaiian islands, that of Kauai, is about 5.5 million years old and deeply eroded, while the rock on Hawaii island is a comparatively young 0.7 million years of age or less, with new lava constantly erupting at Kīlauea, the hotspot's present center. Another consequence of his theory is that the chain's length and orientation serves to record the direction and speed of the Pacific Plate's movement. A major feature of the Hawaiian trail is a sudden 60° bend at a 40- to 50-million-year-old section of its length, and according to Wilson's theory, this is evidence of a major change in plate direction, one that would have initiated subduction along much of the Pacific Plate's western boundary. This part of the theory has recently been challenged, and the bend might be attributed to the movement of the hotspot itself.|$|E
25|$|Evidence {{indicates}} that beach vitex possesses a combinational <b>dormancy</b> mechanism. This <b>dormancy</b> mechanism {{is made up}} of a physical <b>dormancy</b> component and a physiological <b>dormancy</b> component. The physical <b>dormancy</b> mechanism is believed to be inforced at least in part by cuticular alkanes that prevent water penetration. The mechanism of the physiological <b>dormancy</b> component is not yet fully understood. This <b>dormancy</b> mechanism allows {{for the establishment of a}} substantial soil seed bank that is capable of surviving and producing new seedlings in excess of 4 years after all vegetation has been removed. <b>Dormancy</b> mechanisms also allow the plant to undergo long-distance dispersal.|$|E
25|$|In seeds with combinational <b>dormancy,</b> {{the seed}} or fruit coat is {{impermeable}} to water and the embryo has physiological <b>dormancy.</b> Depending on the species, physical <b>dormancy</b> can be broken before or after physiological <b>dormancy</b> is broken.|$|E
25|$|Seed <b>dormancy</b> has {{two main}} functions: {{the first is}} {{synchronizing}} germination with the optimal conditions for survival of the resulting seedling; the second is spreading germination of a batch of seeds over time so a catastrophe (e.g. late frosts, drought, herbivory) does not result {{in the death of}} all offspring of a plant (bet-hedging). Seed <b>dormancy</b> is defined as a seed failing to germinate under environmental conditions optimal for germination, normally when the environment is at a suitable temperature with proper soil moisture. This true <b>dormancy</b> or innate <b>dormancy</b> is therefore caused by conditions within the seed that prevent germination. Thus <b>dormancy</b> is a state of the seed, not of the environment. Induced <b>dormancy,</b> enforced <b>dormancy</b> or seed quiescence occurs when a seed fails to germinate because the external environmental conditions are inappropriate for germination, mostly in response to conditions being too dark or light, too cold or hot, or too dry.|$|E
25|$|Physical <b>dormancy</b> or {{hard seed}} coats occurs when seeds are {{impermeable}} to water. At <b>dormancy</b> break, a specialized structure, the ‘water gap’, is disrupted {{in response to}} environmental cues, especially temperature, so water can enter the seed and germination can occur. Plant families where physical <b>dormancy</b> occurs include Anacardiaceae, Cannaceae, Convulvulaceae, Fabaceae and Malvaceae.|$|E
25|$|Often, seed <b>dormancy</b> {{is divided}} into four major categories: exogenous; endogenous; combinational; and secondary. A more recent system distinguishes five classes: morphological, physiological, morphophysiological, {{physical}} and combinational <b>dormancy.</b>|$|E
25|$|Chemical <b>dormancy</b> {{considers}} {{species that}} lack physiological <b>dormancy,</b> but where a chemical prevents germination. This chemical can be leached {{out of the}} seed by rainwater or snow melt or be deactivated somehow. Leaching of chemical inhibitors from the seed by rain water is often cited as an important cause of <b>dormancy</b> release in seeds of desert plants, but little evidence exists to support this claim.|$|E
25|$|Seed <b>dormancy</b> is not {{the same}} as seed {{persistence}} in the soil or on the plant, though even in scientific publications <b>dormancy</b> and persistence are often confused or used as synonyms.|$|E
25|$|Some live {{seeds are}} dormant and need more time, and/or {{need to be}} {{subjected}} to specific environmental conditions before they will germinate. Seed <b>dormancy</b> can originate {{in different parts of the}} seed, for example, within the embryo; in other cases the seed coat is involved. <b>Dormancy</b> breaking often involves changes in membranes, initiated by dormancy-breaking signals. This generally occurs only within hydrated seeds. Factors affecting seed <b>dormancy</b> include the presence of certain plant hormones, notably abscisic acid, which inhibits germination, and gibberellin, which ends seed <b>dormancy.</b> In brewing, barley seeds are treated with gibberellin to ensure uniform seed germination for the production of barley malt.|$|E
25|$|Townsend's ground {{squirrels}} {{become dormant}} {{in late spring}} or early summer, after grasses cure. They emerge from <b>dormancy</b> in late winter. <b>Dormancy</b> lasts 7.5 to 9 continuous months. It is shorter in wet years, when green forage is available later in summer, than in dry years.|$|E
25|$|The {{germination}} percentage {{is simply the}} proportion of seeds that germinate from all seeds subject to the right conditions for growth. The germination rate is {{the length of time}} it takes for the seeds to germinate. Germination percentages and rates are affected by seed viability, <b>dormancy</b> and environmental effects that impact on the seed and seedling. In agriculture and horticulture quality seeds have high viability, measured by {{germination percentage}} plus the rate of germination. This is given as a percent of germination over a certain amount of time, 90% germination in 20 days, for example. 'Dormancy' is covered above; many plants produce seeds with varying degrees of <b>dormancy,</b> and different seeds from the same fruit can have different degrees of <b>dormancy.</b> It's possible to have seeds with no <b>dormancy</b> if they are dispersed right away and do not dry (if the seeds dry they go into physiological <b>dormancy).</b> There is great variation amongst plants and a dormant seed is still a viable seed even though the germination rate might be very low.|$|E
