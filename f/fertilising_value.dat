40|$|The bedded pack barn offers good {{perspective}} on animal welfare, animal health and public perception, but has disadvantages {{in terms of}} mineral management (nitrogen losses and <b>fertilising</b> <b>value)</b> {{and the presence of}} TAS (Thermophilic Aerobic Spore formers). Bedded packs with compost have a too high ammonia emission in the barn and lead to too high concentrations of TAS in sterile dairy products and therefore have no perspective. A controlled composting process with wood chips may have more future perspective. However, the availability and/or the price of wood chips can be a bottleneck if demand is increasing. The search for alternative TAS-poor bedding materials deserves continuation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. One of {{the ways}} of the {{utilisation}} of chromium-free tannery wastes may be their processing into organic fertilisers. Two methods are taken into consideration: meth-ane fermentation and composting. It has been found that alongside gas recovery, methane fermentation of chromium-free tannery wastes allows to obtain material that is dewatered in different degree, with various, but always high, content of fertilising components. The final properties are determined by the kind of wastes (proportions in which various wastes have been mixed), and by conditions of the process. The paper offers a preliminary fertil-ising characteristics of various sludges and sludge liquids. The results confirm {{that it is possible to}} obtain biologically stable fertilising products of big, or even very big, fertilis-ing value from nasty chromium-free tannery wastes. Key words: sludge, sludge liquid, <b>fertilising</b> <b>value,</b> soil-forming value, stabilisation of or-ganic materia...|$|E
40|$|Sewage sludge has a <b>fertilising</b> <b>value</b> {{when applied}} to {{agricultural}} land or forest. However, due {{to the presence of}} potentially toxic heavy metals in the sludge, disposal of sewage sludge on agricultural soils in Northern Ireland is subject to an EU directive to protect animal and human health. The Sludge (Use in Agriculture) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1990 implement the European Communities Council Directive No. 86 / 278 /EEC (OJ No. L 181 / 6) on the protection of the environment, and in particular of the soil, when sewage sludge is used in agriculture. Over the period 2004 - 2006, the Tellus Project measured and assessed the environmental well-being of Northern Ireland using modern mapping techniques. There were two aspects to the project, one a geochemical survey, the other geophysical. The geochemical data from the survey were used to map areas of the province where sewage sludge should not be spread. ...|$|E

40|$|In a field {{experiment}} at the Experimental Farm for Organic Farming in Northern Germany, {{the effect of}} sulphur application {{in the form of}} MgSO 4 to a red clover-grass mixture was measured in the year 2011. At the beginning of the vegetation period in the spring plots were fertilised with 30 and 60 kg S ha- 1. The sulphur fertilisation resulted in significantly higher fresh weight and dry matter yields and otherwise in a lower dry matter content as compared to an unfertilised treatment. The content of crude protein and sulphur were significantly increased by sulphur application. The N/S-ratios in the <b>fertilised</b> plots showed <b>values</b> below the threshold of 15 for an adequate supply of sulphur. The N-withdrawals added up over the three cuts increased in the fertilised plots by over 55...|$|R
40|$|The most {{important}} photosynthesis acceptor – leaf area vary among cultivation measures {{and it is}} limited factor for creating exact growth models in common winter wheat. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate changes of leaf area index (LAI) affected by agricultural treatments – 4 sowing rates and 9 nitrogen treatments based on <b>fertilising</b> rates, target <b>values</b> based on soil mineral nitrogen and plant sap tests target values including different varieties. Increasing sowing rates from 350 to 800 viable seeds m- 2 increased LAI at EC 75 stage from 2. 9 to 5. 5, where LAI 4. 1 at 500 seeds m- 2 did not vary between lower and higher rates; also at EC 85 stage LAIs did not differ significantly. At EC 75 stage LAI differed among control and nitrogen treatments from 1. 0 to 6. 5 and at EC 85 stage from 0. 1 to 2. 4, with differences in interaction among varieties. Higher nitrogen rates for first and second top dressing increased LAI in both stages compared without dressing treatments. Due to significant differences among LAI as consequence of production system, we suggest to take this into account in every prediction and modelling of growth in winter wheat...|$|R
40|$|The {{carbon and}} {{nitrogen}} mineralisation of a composting mixture of brewing yeast and lemon tree prunings was studied, at {{different degrees of}} stabilisation of this matrix, within an incubation experiment in soil. Meanwhile, a growth test in pots with ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) was carried out using the selected soil and equal amounts of the composting mixture taken at different maturation steps, in order to evaluate the additions of these organic amendments in terms of <b>fertilising</b> <b>value.</b> Samples of the composting mixture, when poorly transformed through the biostabilisation process, showed high CO 2 -C releases in the soil, due to the microbial attack on easily degradable organic fractions still present in the mixture, with 24. 7 % mineralisation of the initial total organic carbon (TOC) after a 70 day incubation. On the other hand, mature compost was the most stable matrix, with only 5. 4 % of TOC mineralised after 70 days. Furthermore, amendments with the initial composting mixture led to negative net N-mineralisation during 56 days of incubation with soil. Only slight negative values of the net N-mineralisation were detected with fully stabilised compost. Nevertheless, pot experiments with ryegrass revealed that mature compost may promote N mineralisation to certain extents. Moreover, mature compost did not produce any phytotoxic effect, behaving as a slow-action organic fertiliser with N made available through a progressive mineralisation. Thus, the results gained through this study are a confirmation that the fertilising quality of a compost destined for agricultural uses is heavily affected by the complete exhaustion of the maturation reactions.

40|$|The Montreal Urban Community (MUC) {{treatment}} plant produces approximately 270 tons of dry sludge daily (tds/day) during physicochemical wastewater treatment. The sludges are burned {{and contribute to}} the greenhouse effect by producing atmospheric CO 2. Moreover, the sludge emanates a nauseating odour during its thermal stabilisation and retains unpleasant odours for the part (25 %) that is dried and granulated. To solve this particular problem, the {{treatment plant}} authorities are currently evaluating an acidic chemical leaching (sulfuric or hydrochloric acid) process at a pH between 2 and 3, using an oxidizing agent such as ferric chloride or hydrogen peroxide (METIX-AC technology, patent pending; [20]). They could integrate it to a 70 tds/day granulated sludge production process. Verification of the application of METIX-AC technology was carried out in a pilot plant set up near the sludge production plant of the MUC. The tests showed that METIX-AC technology can be advantageously integrated to the process used at the MUC. The residual copper (274 ± 58 mg/kg) and cadmium (5. 6 ± 2. 9 mg/kg) concentrations in the treated sludge meet legislation standards. The results have also shown that odours have been significantly eliminated for the dewatered, decontaminated, and stabilized biosolids (> 97 %) compared to the non-decontaminated biosolids. A high rate of odour elimination also was obtained for the liquid leached biosolids (> 93 %), compared to the untreated liquid biosolids. The <b>fertilising</b> <b>value</b> (N and P) is well preserved by the METIX-AC process. Dissolved organic carbon measurements have showed that little organic matter is brought in solution during the treatment. In fact, the average concentration of dissolved organic carbon measured in the treated liquid phase is 966 ± 352 mg/l, whereas it is 1190 ± 325 mg/l in untreated sludge. The treated sludge was first conditioned with an organic polymer and a coagulant aid. It was successfully dewatered with various dehydration equipments (filter press, rotary press, centrifuge) ...|$|E
40|$|To fulfil the {{government}} goal of sustainable food production, the nutrients {{taken from the}} fields as food has to be recycled. Today, the net loss of nutrients is compensated by addition of fossil plant nutrients, which are non renewable resources. At the same time, the wastewater nutrients cause eutrophication in the water recipients. The main contribution of plant nutrients to the wastewater is the toiletwater. By sorting the toiletwater {{it is possible to}} recycle clean nutrients to agriculture. In this project, the possibility to inactivate pathogens during storage of toiletwater was investigated. To improve the inactivation of pathogens different concentrations of urea and lime were added to the toiletwater. Additionally, the reduction in the surface layer and the bottom layer were compared. The trials were performed in a half filled 600 m 3 liquid manure tank, where ten two litre bottles with different additions of chemicals were used (Table S 1). To the different bottles Salmonella, Enterococcus fekalie and E coli O 157 correspongin to 7 - 8 log 10 ml- 1 were added. To a few of the trials was also Ascaris suum added. The number of organisms was counted at three ocations; at day 28, day 68 and day 102 after the start at June 2, 2004. After 68 days, no viable bacteria was found in U 0, 1 K 0 B or in U 0 K 0, 05 B. These two trials were the ones with the highest addition of urea (0. 1 %) and lime (0. 05 %), respectively. Ten weeks of treatment is thereby enough for finding no viable pathogenic bacteria. The survival of A suum was high, after 102 days of treatment were still 40 % of the eggs viable in the highest addition of urea (0. 1 %). In the other trials where A suum was added did the viability stay at 60 %. Enterococcus was the type of bacteria that survived the longest in the investigated material. Enterococcus is normally excreted in the faecal matter. Therefore, Enterococcus can be used as indicator for the treatment efficiency, regarding the reduction of pathogenic bacteria in the toiletwater. The cost of treatment for the used chemicals is low as the used chemicals are not consumed during the treatment. The treatment is actually increasing the <b>fertilising</b> <b>value</b> of the treated material {{at the same time as}} a hygienically safe fertiliser is produced...|$|E
40|$|Changes in {{resource}} {{availability and}} biotic and abiotic stress may alter the defensive mechanisms of pine trees. The effect of fertilisation on the resin canal structure of Pinus pinaster seedlings established in two trials in NW Spain, one attacked by Hylobius abietis {{and the other}} non-attacked, was studied. The leaders of 50 plants were destructively sampled and the resin canal density, the canal area and its relative conductive area in the phloem and xylem were assessed. Experimentally increased nutrient availability significantly decreased resin canal density in the phloem of the seedlings in the two analysed trials, where unfertilised seedlings presented up to 30 % more resin canal density than the <b>fertilised</b> seedlings (mean <b>value</b> ± SEM = 0. 32 ± 0. 02 resin canals mm− 2 in the fertilised plants versus 0. 45 ± 0. 04 resin canals mm− 2 in the control plants). Fertilisation {{had no effect on}} the resin canal system in the xylem, but significantly increased tracheid size. Significant differences of resin canals among sites were observed mainly in the xylem; the resin canal density was 1. 7 -fold greater in the attacked site than in the non-attacked site. The similar structure of phloem resin canals in both sites supports that phloem resin canals are constitutive mechanisms of defence in P. pinaster, whereas xylem resin canals would be constitutive mechanisms but also inducible mechanisms of resistance following the attack of pine weevils or bark beetles. Research was supported by the INIA RTA 05 - 173 project. Peer reviewe...|$|R
