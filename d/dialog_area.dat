40|$|Short Abstract: In 2013 a {{learning}} innovation incubator {{began with a}} question “what might an education addressing next-generation skills look like?” A result was the first competency-based undergraduate program at a main campus of a major university. This talk provides insights into a process involving learning and policy innovation. Full Abstract: In 2013 {{a learning}} innovation incubator began to consider the question “what might an education addressing next-generation skills look like?” Faculty from technology, mathematics, science, and various disciplines in the humanities met weekly for six months establishing trust {{with the help of}} a learning innovation coach using open <b>dialog</b> in <b>areas</b> such as empathy, belonging, and vulnerability. With the help of experts from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and Olin College, two learning experiences (courses) were created and developed in the spring and summer of 2014. The learning experiences intentionally integrated the humanities with STEM fields using self-awareness and open-ended wicked problems as cornerstones to foster and develop individual student learning and metacognition. A competency-based learning model was adopted to assess student agency and learning in a more holistic way. Over the next three years a cohort of students navigated requirements for their declared major while participating in these new and evolving learning experiences, and the process of obtaining necessary degree approvals...|$|R
40|$|A filosofia de Epicuro divide-se, tradicionalmente, em três áreas: a Física, a Canônica e a Ética. Essas áreas dialogam entre si, não podendo ser compreendidas individualmente sem o estudo apurado das demais. Diante disso, esta dissertação se dividirá em quatro partes: a primeira, dedicada à Física, analisará tanto o desafio de Epicuro em levar adiante o atomismo exaltado por Demócrito e a física econômica democritiana, fundada sobre os dois elementos primordiais que permitem tanto a compreensão total da ordem cósmica, quanto a forma em que o sensualismo epicúreo diferiu do materialismo daqueles que apenas admitiam o ser e o material; a segunda tratará da Canônica, visto que, após trabalhar a physiologia, torna-se imprescindível abordar a questão do conhecimento e a sua origem, bem como a maneira através da qual a escola epicurista procurou definir o que é possível conhecer e como se deu a origem da linguagem; na terceira, estudar-se-á a Ética à luz dos temas da felicidade e do prazer, esclarecendo o que é o prazer e o que é a vida feliz para Epicuro, assim como este filósofo procurou lidar com o uso dos prazeres, definindo como deveria ser a postura e o agir dos homens que almejam a felicidade, opondo-se às teses hedonistas; na quarta parte, será defendida uma visão do epicurismo como uma filosofia terapêutica e prescritiva, balizada principalmente no ideal ascético do cultivo de si para uma vida feliz. Traditionally Epicurus’ {{philosophy}} is divided in three areas: Physics, Canonic and Ethics. These <b>areas</b> <b>dialog</b> {{among themselves and}} they can’t be understood disconnected one from the others. Thus, this dissertation will be splitted into four parts: the first part will be dedicated to physics, analyzing the Epicurus` challenge of continuing the atomism exalted by Democritus and the democritian economical physics, based on the two primordial elements which allow the total comprehension of the cosmic order, {{as well as the}} manner that epicurean sensualism disagreed from those that only had accepted the being and the material; The second one will deal with the Canonic, once after having studied the physiology, it becomes vital to examine the subject of knowledge and its origin, likewise the way that epicureans determined what is knowable and what was the origin of the language; in the third part, will be studied the Ethic {{in the light of the}} themes of happiness and pleasure, clarifying what Epicurus considered as pleasure and as a blessed life, such as this philosopher dealt with the use of pleasure, defining how should be the attitude and the action of those men who long for happiness, opposing the hedonistic thesis; in the fourth part, will be advocate a view of epicurism as a therapeutic and prescriptive philosophy, based mainly on the ascetic ideal of the cultivation of oneself for a happy life...|$|R
40|$|Background: It is {{imperative}} that today’s health care professions adopt a holistic and occupation-based perspective that embodies health and wellness (Frank, 2012). The interdisciplinary work of occupational science and occupational therapy can offer a dynamic perspective to future scientists, therapists and educators. Interdisciplinary work care can achieved in occupational therapy fieldwork experiences, and facilitate future clinicians to gain an understanding on the innate need of humans to be occupied by meaningful occupations. Purpose of the Study: To examine the lived experiences of occupational therapy students who are participating in an international Level I fieldwork experience in Ibarra, Ecuador: May 2 nd-May 11 th, 2015. This study has been designed from an occupational science perspective. The goal of this qualitative study is to assess the students’ perception of: occupation, cultural diversity, client-centered care, and the role they can assume as future clinicians. Research Design: A phenomenological approach will be utilized to gain insight on the lived experiences of occupational therapy students who are participating in fieldwork abroad. Phenomenological research studies are beneficial for both occupational science and occupational therapy; and will help participants gain awareness of their experience abroad. The qualitative data will be collected during the nine day fieldwork experience in Ecuador. The student participants will participate in three semi-structured interviews and a group debriefing. Three semi-structured interviews will occur on days: three, six and nine and will consist of informal and open-ended questions. The semi-structured interviews and group debriefing will be digitally recorded, transcribed, and undergo thematic analysis. The research data will be themed according to the Braun 2 ̆ 6 Clarke (2006) six steps of thematic analysis. Trustworthiness will be ensured by triangulation. The semi-structured interviews and debriefing will be coded separately, and a comparison of themes will be performed. Member checking will occur to ensure correct themes were discovered. A reflexive approach will {{be integrated into the}} data analysis; and will contribute to the insight gained on the participants’ perceived experience. Intent: The integration of occupational science into occupational therapy fieldwork can provide an enriched understanding of the occupations and lived experiences of students, and their awareness on culture and occupation. This study will illustrate a need for further collaborative research between occupational science and occupational therapy to ensure a global focus on occupation, health and wellness. Conclusion: Culturally-inclusive research is required on behalf of occupational science and occupational therapy to meet the evolving needs of a globally connected environment. A client-centered perspective that is driven by the client, versus the influence of the therapist will revolutionize global occupational engagement (Martin, Martos, Millares 2 ̆ 6 Bjorklund, 2015). Contribution to occupational science: Collaborative efforts between occupational science and occupational therapy can ensure a global focus and culturally-inclusive health. Objectives for Discussion: To engage in discussion on global occupations and need for culturally-inclusive educational experiences. Discuss results from qualitative study: identify themes discovered from an occupational science perspective. <b>Dialog</b> about future <b>areas</b> of study: collaborative ways to prepare future clinicians and scientists to meet diverse needs of global community. Key words: occupational therapy, occupational science, international fieldwor...|$|R
40|$|RATIONALE The {{purpose of}} the study was to survey the use of {{microcomputers}} as instructional assisted tools in the education of mildly handicapped students from selected school systems of Georgia. Specifically, the study addressed the following issues: (1) identified instructional uses of microcomputers in special education; (2) areas of exceptionality wherein instructional micro computer usage is evidenced; (3) perceptions of special educators toward microcomputer applications; and (4) future implications. SIGNIFICANCE The study will greatly expand the literature base and identify factors related to the use of microcomputers in the instructional process of educating mildly handicapped students. METHODS AND PROCEDURES Data for the study were generated from Directors of Special Education and Teachers of Mildly Handicapped Students from selected public school sys tems of Georgia. The chief data collection method used was the questionnaire with the interview/participant observation technique being secondary. The question naire used was a modified version of the instrument developed in 1982 by Henry Jay Becker to obtain data for his study, 2 ̆ 2 School Uses of Microcom puters. 2 ̆ 2 Items for the revised instrument addressed demographic, usage and perception information. Both descriptive and inferential statistical procedures were used to analyze the data. Sections I and II of the questionnaire stimulated cate gorical data which produced percentages. The Chi-square statistical method at the. 05 level was used to determine the statistically significant dif ference of the nominal data and to test one hypothesis. The Analysis of Variance statistical method was used at the. 05 level to accept or reject five of the hypotheses. The secondary method of data collection involved the interview/partici pant observation methods. Items for the interview questions and the observa tion checklist were original. Sites for the field research were randomly selected to include visitations to the three different size school systems based on student population. Data for this phase of the study were reported in case studies. RESULTS The findings from the study reveal from a broad perspective that Direc tors of Special Education and Teachers of Mildly Handicapped Students demon strated great support of microcomputer usage in the instruction of mildly handicapped students. Special educators found the most productive use of this strategy in drill and practice and tutorial <b>dialog</b> activities. The <b>area</b> of mathematics was considered strongest with language arts being second rela tive to fundamental instructional use. Most computer time was scheduled during class periods. Strengths in the instructional applications included individualization, alternative approaches to learning, provisions for immediate feedback, flexi bility in management, increased student/teacher contact, student motivation, and increased student attention span. Problemmatic concerns include: limited and incompatible software, inadequate inservice, student/computer ratios and human interaction. The. 05 confidence level was used to determine statistical significance. The null hypotheses formulated and tested on the variable groups were accepted at the. 05 level. CONCLUSIONS Special education administrators (directors/coordinators) and teachers of mildly handicapped students strongly support the use of microcomputers as instructional assisted tools in the education of mildly handicapped students. Increasing use and versatility are evidenced; however, expanded efforts are needed for budgetary support, staff development, time management and sched uling. As improvements are made based on continued research the use of this technology will continue to enhance the educational opportunities of handi capped students...|$|R
