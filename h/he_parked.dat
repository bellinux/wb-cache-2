5|$|McVeigh entered Oklahoma City at 8:50a.m. At 8:57a.m., the Regency Towers Apartments' lobby {{security}} camera that had recorded Nichols' pickup truck three days earlier recorded the Ryder truck heading towards the Murrah Federal Building. At the same moment, McVeigh lit the five-minute fuse. Three minutes later, still a block away, he lit the two-minute fuse. <b>He</b> <b>parked</b> the Ryder truck in a drop-off zone situated under the building's day-care center, exited {{and locked the}} truck, and as he headed to his getaway vehicle, dropped {{the keys to the}} truck a few blocks away.|$|E
25|$|The {{next morning}} at {{approximately}} 10:15, Nalls circled around the block looking for the Hudson, but observed nothing. <b>He</b> <b>parked,</b> first on Lincoln (the {{north side of the}} apartments), then {{on the west side of}} Lexington, at the northwest corner of Lexington and Lincoln, and remained in his car while watching Coulter and St. Paul Police detective Henry Cummings, pull up, park, and enter the building. Ten minutes later, by Nalls's estimate, Van Meter parked a green Ford coupe on the north side of the apartment building.|$|E

That summer, Serrill Headley, who by then {{had moved to the}} town of Oxford, Pennsylvania with her brother, confided to friends that her son had become a religious fanatic and had been to terrorist {{training camp}}s. While Gilani was on a catering visit to his mother's house, one of her friends, Phyllis Keith, noticed that <b>he</b> <b>parked</b> his car behind her residence as if he was trying to hide it. Keith reported Gilani to the FBI office in Philadelphia, which apparently did not follow through with an investigation.|$|E

25|$|On 17 July 2005 at 10:30 local time, British Formula One driver David Coulthard {{drove his}} Red Bull racing car {{across the bridge}} from the European side to the Asian side, then, after turning with a powerslide at the toll plaza, back to the European side for show. <b>He</b> <b>parked</b> his car {{in the garden of}} Dolmabahçe Palace where his ride had started. While {{crossing}} the bridge with his Formula 1 car, Coulthard was picked up by the automatic surveillance system and charged with a fine of 20 Euros because he passed through the toll booths without payment. His team agreed to pay for him.|$|E
25|$|The {{root cause}} of the {{accident}} was attributed to {{the driver of the}} automobile, Juan Manuel Álvarez of Compton, California, who deliberately drove and left his vehicle onto the tracks while allegedly attempting to commit suicide. Having slashed his wrists and stabbed himself repeatedly in the chest, <b>he</b> <b>parked</b> his car on the tracks to finish the attempt. However, Álvarez changed his mind and attempted to leave the railroad tracks. Because he was unable to dislodge his vehicle from the rain-soaked gravel and slick rails, he abandoned the vehicle moments before the crowded southbound train approached. However, there has been some speculation that Álvarez may have inflicted the wounds on himself after the crash, based on some early reports by witnesses. Both this causation and the end result have many similarities to that of the Ufton Nervet rail crash in the United Kingdom, which occurred only three months previously, although in that case the driver of the car stayed in the vehicle and was killed.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after, King {{was another}} retiree as <b>he</b> <b>parked</b> his car two laps after the restart with a {{punctured}} tyre, while Serrallés drove {{slowly to the}} pit lane to replace a dislodged front wing. Further back, Verstappen was moving through the field and up to eleventh position and was drawing closer to Calderón ahead of him for a top-ten placing. At {{the front of the}} race, Rosenqvist was maintaining a lead of over four seconds from Cassidy, with Auer pressuring the struggling New Zealand. However Auer could not take advantage of Cassidy's handicap and he pulled clear. At the end, Cassidy glanced the wall with the rear-end of his car, and lost time in the track's final sector. Auer slipstreamed up to the rear of Cassidy and temporarily moved into second on lap thirteen. He ran wide at Lisboa corner {{for the third time in}} the event, allowing Cassidy back through to second position. Auer was later able to retake the position later in the lap. Cassidy opted not to challenge Auer and refocused himself on the closing Merhi.|$|E

As a new judge, Higginbotham still encountered racism. On his first day on the district court, <b>he</b> <b>parked</b> his car in the area reserved for judges, and was yelled at by a guard [...] "Hey, boy!" [...] Higginbotham asked whether the guard was speaking to him, and the guard responded that only judges were permitted to park in the area. Higginbotham responded by saying [...] "I understand, and that's why I parked there." [...] The guard said [...] "Oh, you're Judge Higginbotham. Welcome to the Court." [...] Higginbotham would later remember the incident as [...] "typical of a lot of things which have happened to both minorities and to women." ...|$|E
500|$|On April 14, 1995, McVeigh {{paid for}} a motel room at the Dreamland Motel in Junction City, Kansas. The {{following}} day he rented a 1993 Ford F-700 truck from Ryder under the name Robert D. Kling, an alias he adopted because he knew an Army soldier named Kling with whom he shared physical characteristics, and because {{it reminded him of}} the Klingon warriors of Star Trek. On April16, 1995, he drove to Oklahoma City with fellow conspirator Terry Nichols where <b>he</b> <b>parked</b> a getaway car several blocks away from the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. The nearby Regency Towers Apartments' lobby security camera recorded images of Nichols' blue 1984 GMC pickup truck on April 16. After removing the license plate from the car, he left a note covering the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) plate that read, [...] "Not abandoned. Please do not tow. Will move by April 23.

500|$|When {{the race}} started at 14:00 local time (...) , Kimi Räikkönen managed to pass both Williams {{cars on the}} first lap to move up to fourth, while Nico Rosberg was able to fend off Sebastian Vettel for second. On the second lap, Carlos Sainz Jr. spun his Toro Rosso and dropped down the order. Nico Hülkenberg became the first {{retirement}} on lap ten, when <b>he</b> <b>parked</b> his Force India in the gravel after his gearbox failed. During the pit stops, Ferrari attempted an undercut by pitting Sebastian Vettel early on lap 13, a strategy in which a car running behind is pitting early {{in order to use}} a fast out-lap on fresh tyres to jump ahead of a rival without having to overtake them on track. However this was unsuccessful as Mercedes reacted by pitting Rosberg the following lap, allowing Rosberg to maintain track position over Vettel. On lap 17, Daniil Kvyat retired from the race when his Red Bull started to smoke.|$|E

500|$|Lonsdale, never a Scientologist himself, became {{critical}} of the Church of Scientology in mid-2006, and often stood outside in downtown Clearwater near Scientology's spiritual headquarters wearing a sandwich board sign that read [...] "Cult Watch". Lonsdale became interested in Scientology after getting into a fight with a Scientologist over redevelopment issues while at a City Council meeting. After the Scientologist followed Lonsdale's car home and Lonsdale noticed a van {{parked in front of}} his home for two hours the following day, he began to research the background of Scientology on anti-Scientology sites on the Internet and in the library. He taped hours of footage of Scientology staffers, security guards, and verbal confrontations with Scientologists, and edited clips into a pseudo-documentary which aired on local public-access television. Lonsdale dropped fliers outside downtown businesses and picked through trash from a Scientology-owned business and posted documents online. <b>He</b> <b>parked</b> outside a Scientology cafeteria with posters in his car window which stated that key Scientology texts were available for free on the Internet: [...] "OT I-VIII for free at xenu.net." ...|$|E
500|$|After Watermelon Man {{proved to}} be a {{financial}} success, Van Peebles was offered a three-picture contract. While the deal was still up in the air, Van Peebles- still wanting to create the first black power film- developed the story for Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song. The initial idea for the film did not come clearly to him at first. One day, Van Peebles drove into the Mojave desert, turned off the highway, and drove over the rise of a hill. <b>He</b> <b>parked</b> the car, got out, and squatted down facing the sun. [...] He decided that the film was going to be [...] "about a brother getting the Man's foot out of his ass."...Is!. Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song DVD, Xenon Entertainment Group, 2003. [...] Because no studio would finance the film, Van Peebles put his own money into the production, and shot it independently. Van Peebles was given a $50,000 loan by Bill Cosby to complete the film. [...] "Cosby didn't want an equity part," [...] according to Van Peebles. [...] "He just wanted his money back." [...] Van Peebles wound up with controlling ownership of the film. Several actors auditioned for the lead role of Sweetback, but told Van Peebles that they wouldn't do the film unless they were given more dialogue. Van Peebles ended up playing the part himself.|$|E
500|$|Morale on the {{battlefield}} was poor. JNA commanders resorted to firing on their own positions to motivate their men to fight. When the commander of a JNA unit at Vukovar demanded to know {{who was willing to}} fight and who wanted to go home, the unit split in two; one conscript, unable to decide which side to take, shot himself on the spot. A JNA officer who served at Vukovar later described how his men refused to obey orders on several occasions, [...] "abandoning combat vehicles, discarding weapons, gathering on some flat ground, sitting and singing Give Peace a Chance by John Lennon." [...] In late October, an entire infantry battalion from Novi Sad in Serbia abandoned an attack on Borovo Naselje and fled. Another group of reservists threw away their weapons and went back to Serbia on foot across a nearby bridge. A tank driver, Vladimir Živković, drove his vehicle from the front line at Vukovar to the Yugoslav parliament in Belgrade, where <b>he</b> <b>parked</b> on the steps in front of the building. He was arrested and declared insane by the authorities.

[...] "I was running laps faster than Dave had been. It {{was the first time}} I had ever driven a race car." [...] Richmond and his father found a red, white and blue-colored No. 98 car in Pennsylvania, which was the same number and paint scheme that Richmond used on model cars as a child. In his first competition at the track, officials placed Richmond in the slowest heat. He passed several cars before spinning out and breaking an axle. Although he made several attempts to get the car pointed in the right direction, the broken axle prevented the car from driving straight. After being towed to the pits, <b>he</b> <b>parked</b> the car {{for the rest of the}} event. Later that season, they towed the car to Eldora Speedway, only to have Richmond crash the car again. In response, Richmond's father fired him as the driver. The next season, Al Richmond bought a SuperModified better suited to his son's driving style.

500|$|According to the {{official}} account of the operation, Savage entered Gibraltar undetected in a white Renault 5 at 12:45 (CET; UTC+1) on 6 March 1988. An MI5 officer recognised {{him and he was}} followed, but he was not positively identified for almost an hour and a half, during which time <b>he</b> <b>parked</b> the vehicle in the car park used as the assembly area for the changing of the guard. At 14:30, McCann and Farrell were observed crossing the frontier from Spain and were also followed. They met Savage in the car park at around 14:50 and a few minutes later the three began walking through the town. After the three left the car park, [...] "Soldier G", a bomb-disposal officer, was ordered to examine Savage's car; he returned after a few minutes and reported that the vehicle should be treated as a suspect car bomb. This soldier's suspicion was conveyed as certainty to Soldiers [...] "A", [...] "B", [...] "C", and [...] "D", who were ordered into positions to intercept Savage, McCann, and Farrell as they walked north towards the Spanish border. [...] "Soldier G"'s information convinced Gibraltar Police Commissioner Joseph Canepa, who was controlling the operation, to order the arrest of the three suspects.

500|$|Some campaigning by party {{workers of}} the True Finns caused {{controversy}} over {{the nature of their}} actions. Most complaints emanated from the Helsinki region. Jussi Saramo of the Left Alliance in the Uusimaa electoral district said of their actions that [...] " [...] I have been involved in politics for 12 years and I have never seen such excesses." [...] This followed an event in Korso in Vantaa where <b>he</b> <b>parked</b> his campaign trailer in a spot the True Finns said was reserved for party chairman Timo Soini. True Finns' candidate Mika Niikko however said those involved in the spat were no longer working for his campaign and he apologised to Saramo despite maintaining his stance that the placement of the trailer was a deliberate provocation: [...] "I do not approve of being provoked when someone tries to provoke;" [...] he also added that the volunteers working for the True Finns campaign come [...] "from here and there" [...] and {{it was not possible to}} verify everyone beforehand. He further added a claim that True Finns supporters have also been targets of aggressive behaviour. [...] "A month ago we were not verbally abused, but now you can hear all kinds of language." [...] The Social Democrats' foreign-born candidate Ranbir Sodhi was allegedly confronted by True Finns supporters in the Myyrmäki district of Vantaa who were said to have told him to go back [...] "to his own country" [...] where he could become a politician. A week after the confrontations, however, he said that [...] "the same guys came to Tikkurila to apologise." [...] The National Coalition Party MP Raija Vahasalo also complained that during a campaign event in Kirkkonummi the True Finns handed out leaflets at the same time that claimed she favoured Swedish-speaking residents in allocating local school funding. The action was due to two local members of the True Finns who are not running to become MPs. The chairman of Kirkkonummi True Finns and a candidate in the election Pekka Sinisalo said he confiscated the remainder of the leaflets. [...] "I do not approve of attacking Vahasalo’s person. Election fever sometimes leads to these kinds of excesses." [...] This was controversial as negative campaigning is unusual in Finnish elections. In response to such actions the party secretaries of the largest political parties held a meeting to discuss certain ground rules for the rest of the campaign, however the True Finns' Ossi Sandvik could not make it.|$|E
