3000|$|We {{report a}} series of {{experiments}} studying this question. We investigated how participants fill in missing information during the perception of naturalistic events while relieving participants from the challenge of filtering the relevant information with their attention. That is, we explicitly instructed participants which information could be missing in the presented videos. Doing so, {{we were able to}} address the following questions: Does <b>event</b> <b>completion</b> occur immediately during the perception of an event (Experiment 1)? Is <b>event</b> <b>completion</b> caused by predictive perception or backward inferences (Experiments 2 and 3)? Is there a potential link between <b>event</b> <b>completion</b> and event segmentation (Experiment 4)? [...]...|$|E
30|$|Taken together, {{our results}} suggest that <b>event</b> <b>completion</b> occurs quickly based on {{backward}} inferences. Further, <b>event</b> <b>completion</b> and event segmentation seem to be related, possibly because they both support event model construction during event perception (Magliano et al., 2013). That is, incoming information that is causally linked to the currently active event model is integrated into a coherent event representation. This integration process includes backward inferences filling in {{the gap between the}} represented information and incoming information. The conclusion that the completed information is not only perceived but integrated into a mental representation of the current event is supported by the traditional event-completion paradigm that probes memory rather than perception (Brockhoff et al., 2016; Strickland & Keil, 2011). Thus, it seems promising for future research to further investigate the link between <b>event</b> <b>completion</b> and event segmentation. One could, for example, ask the same participants to perform both an event-completion task and an event segmentation task and investigate whether <b>event</b> <b>completion</b> is associated with reduced segmentation on a trial-by-trial basis.|$|E
30|$|In many {{situations}} of daily and professional life {{it is crucial}} that people can correctly judge what information they have actually seen, such as with referees or eye-witnesses. However, observers regularly complete missing information during the perception of coherent events. We investigated the process driving <b>event</b> <b>completion</b> in situations of full attention towards the missing information with four experiments. In our first experiment, we found that <b>event</b> <b>completion</b> occurs quickly during event perception. That is, if a causal continuation rather than a non-causal continuation followed missing information, participants false alarmed regardless of whether participants responded immediately during the perception of an event or whether they delayed their responses until after an event. With our second experiment, we investigated whether <b>event</b> <b>completion</b> is caused by predictive perception or backward inferences. Showing a white mask following the missing information resulted in a similar contact-detection performance as non-causal continuations. We thus suggest that <b>event</b> <b>completion</b> is not caused by predictive perception. Instead, backward inferences are drawn once a causal continuation follows missing information. With our third experiment we investigated whether <b>event</b> <b>completion</b> occurs directly during a single trial based on backward inferences or whether participants form expectations based on repeated presentations of the same causality condition. Our results indicate that there was no confounding effect of expectations because <b>event</b> <b>completion</b> occurred equally if causality was manipulated within subjects and trial order was intermixed. This provides further evidence for our conclusion that perceptual gaps are filled in based on backward inferences. Our fourth experiment investigated the link between <b>event</b> <b>completion</b> and event segmentation. We asked participants to perform an event segmentation task while watching our event-completion stimuli. We observed some correspondence between event segmentation and <b>event</b> <b>completion</b> because causal continuations resulted in lower event segmentation responses both when the critical moment was present or when it was absent due to the removal of four frames. That is, participants perceived a more coherent event with causal continuation than non-causal continuation both with the causal link being present and with the causal link being inferred (four-frames-removed condition). This provides converging evidence that participants filled in the perceptual gap when four frames were deleted. Interestingly, the causal continuation did not affect event segmentation if nine instead of four frames were removed. In this case, event segmentation was high in both continuation conditions. This indicates that participants did not infer the causal link if nine frames were removed and, thus, were more likely to perceive two events in both continuation conditions.|$|E

30|$|With Experiment 1, {{we showed}} that event-completion occurs quickly during the {{perception}} of an event. It remains still unresolved, however, as to whether <b>event</b> <b>completion</b> is caused by predictive perception or backward inferences. With the present experiment, we investigated this question by replacing {{the second part of}} the video clip with a white mask in half of the trials. Backward inferences are drawn based on the information following the perceptual gap. Thus, backward inferences can only be drawn if the missing information is followed by a causal continuation but not if it is followed by a white mask. Accordingly, if <b>event</b> <b>completion</b> is caused by backward inferences, we should observe completion only in the condition with causal continuation and no mask. In contrast, perceptual predictions are generated based on the information that is present before the perceptual gap. Importantly, we assume that those predictions should not be disrupted by perceptual interruptions such as a mask, similar to the representational momentum paradigm (Freyd & Finke, 1984; Hubbard, 2005; Hudson et al., 2016). Instead, perceptual prediction should only be disrupted by the presence of new semantic information that does not match those perceptual predictions. Accordingly, if <b>event</b> <b>completion</b> is caused by predictive perception, we should observe completion in all conditions with a white mask as well as in the condition with causal continuation and no mask. Only in the condition with no causal continuation and no mask, <b>event</b> <b>completion</b> should not occur.|$|E
30|$|Our {{aim was to}} {{investigate}} the process underlying <b>event</b> <b>completion</b> in situations where observers’ full attention is deployed to the critical information, such as a video referee attending to the moment of body contact during a foul replay. In order to achieve this aim, we employed the contact-detection paradigm used in our previous research (Brockhoff et al., 2016) rather than the original memory based event-completion paradigm (Strickland & Keil, 2011) in our first three experiments. We fully debriefed our participants by instructing them which critical moment of ball contact would be missing in some of the video clips and asked them to detect whether it was missing or not. Whenever participants fill in the gap of missing information in the perceptual stream, they should report having seen something that was not present (high false-alarm rate) which leads to difficulties in distinguishing between information actually being present or absent in the perceptual stream (low contact-detection performance). With our experiments, we investigated whether <b>event</b> <b>completion</b> occurs quickly directly during event perception in such situations (Experiment 1), whether this completion is caused by predictive perception or backward inferences (Experiments 2 and 3), and whether <b>event</b> <b>completion</b> might be related to event perception (Experiment 4).|$|E
3000|$|One {{limitation}} of the original event-completion paradigm (Strickland & Keil, 2011) is that participants {{do not know what}} to look for. That is, participants are not aware of the manipulation and might not actually complete the missing information during the perception of the event but rather reason about the contact image during the test. With the second experiment conducted in our previous research (Brockhoff et al., 2016), we addressed this concern by telling participants about the manipulation upfront and asking them explicitly to indicate whether the moment of ball contact was present or absent after each trial. Despite the new task, participants still showed <b>event</b> <b>completion</b> as indicated by a lower contact-detection performance with causal continuation than with non-causal continuation. This demonstrates that <b>event</b> <b>completion</b> is not a testing artefact. However, our previous findings do not answer two fundamental questions: (1) How quickly does the event-completion effect occur during the observation of an event? and (2) which process causes the effect?

This pattern of results goes {{in line with the}} reduced contact-detection performance in the causal condition. Interestingly, the mean response times in the causal condition (662 [*]ms) indicate that <b>event</b> <b>completion</b> occurs quickly.|$|E
30|$|One {{potential}} concern regarding {{our previous}} experiments {{is the fact}} that we manipulated causality between subjects. Thus, it remains possible that it was not the causal continuation within a single video clip that caused the event-completion effect based on backward inferences. Rather, participants might have generated expectations about the causal structure of the video clips across repeated presentations of either causal or non-causal continuations. In order to investigate this idea, we ran the following control experiment. We manipulated causality within-subjects, that is participants saw both causal and non-causal continuations throughout the experiment. Further, we manipulated the order of trials. We either presented all trials randomly intermixed, or we presented the causal and non-causal trials in two separate blocks. If <b>event</b> <b>completion</b> is caused by backward inferences based on the causal continuation within a single trial, we should observe a comparable event-completion effect across both types of trial-order (intermixed, blocked). If expectations about the causal structure of the video clips influence <b>event</b> <b>completion,</b> however, the event-completion effect should be stronger with a blocked trial order than an intermixed trial order.|$|E
30|$|Our {{findings}} also provide new practical implications for situations where people make judgments of causal events, such as referees or eye-witnesses. Our {{results indicate that}} the causal structure of events biases observers’ responses even when they {{know what to look for}} and when they focus their full attention towards this task. This is important because asking people involved in such judgments to pay close attention might not be sufficient to ensure unbiased judgments, particularly if crucial information is not visible by the observer, as it might be the case if information is occluded from the observers’ viewpoint. In our earlier research on <b>event</b> <b>completion</b> (Brockhoff et al., 2016), we argued in favor of an introduction of video replays and a video referee into soccer games because referees might, for example, judge to have seen a foul play that was causally plausible but never present. Our new research shows that <b>event</b> <b>completion</b> occurs quickly based on backward inferences. Watching a replay of a controversial scene might, therefore, not be sufficient to ensure correct decisions, because backward inferences could also quickly occur while watching the replay with full attention. Thus, guidelines for the design and implementation of video reviews should include methods designed to prevent backward inferences from occurring, such as replacing the causal consequence of an action with a white mask. Using slow motion and stopping the controversial action to hide the causal consequence might also support the accurate perception through the prevention of <b>event</b> <b>completion,</b> although the application of technical aids such as slow motion might in itself cause new biases (Spitz, Moors, Wagemans, & Helsen, 2018). The considerations above apply not only to sport games but also to other situations where critical decisions are based on video-taped evidence, such as when using videos in court (Feigenson & Dunn, 2003).|$|E

30|$|With our Experiments 1 – 3 we {{demonstrated}} that <b>event</b> <b>completion</b> occurs quickly during {{the perception of}} events and that the perceptual gaps are filled in by backward inferences. This indicates that <b>event</b> <b>completion</b> {{occurs as a result}} of the construction of coherent event models during event perception. Because the construction of mental models during event perception is supported by both backward inferences and event segmentation (Magliano, Loschky, Clinton, & Larson, 2013), we conducted a final experiment asking participants to perform an event segmentation task with the stimuli used in our event-completion experiments. We hypothesized that the presence of a causal continuation should lead to a reduced segmentation behavior as compared with the presence of a non-causal continuation. This would indicate that participants perceive a more coherent event. Importantly, this should also be true for the video clips where we deleted four frames, providing converging evidence that participants fill in the perceptual gap resulting in the perception of coherent events. As control stimuli, we also presented clips where we removed even more frames before the cut. This should make the causal link less salient, thus reducing the effect of causal continuation on event segmentation.|$|E
30|$|We {{analyzed}} response bias using a mixed ANOVA {{with the}} factors causality (causal, non-causal; within) and trial order (blocked, intermixed; between). There {{was a significant}} main effect of causality, F(1, 62)[*]=[*] 56.03, p[*]<[*]. 001, ηp 2 [*]=[*]. 47, but neither {{a significant main effect}} of trial order, F(1, 62)[*]=[*] 0.01, p[*]=[*]. 906, ηp 2 [*]<[*]. 01, nor a significant interaction of causality and trial order, F(1, 62)[*]=[*] 0.98, p[*]=[*]. 327, ηp 2 [*]=[*]. 02. This further supports our interpretation that <b>event</b> <b>completion</b> occurs also with an intermixed trial order and is, thus, not dependent on expectations that are built up only after repeated occurrences of the same causality condition.|$|E

We used the event-completion paradigm and showed participants with different soccer expertise (elite referees, players and novice) clips extracted from the footage of a real soccer game. Completion occurred for all three participant groups, suggesting that observers routinely complete missing events and that <b>event</b> <b>completion</b> arises independent of familiarity with stimuli or training.|$|E

30|$|Our {{findings}} that <b>event</b> <b>completion</b> {{is caused by}} backward inferences rather than predictive perception {{should not be taken}} as evidence that predictive perception (Zacks et al., 2007) does not exist at all during event perception. In particular, giving participants the task to detect whether the moment of ball contact was present or absent might have increased their uncertainty about the occurrence of ball contacts in our video clips, thus causing a reduction in the generation of perceptual predictions. Our findings rather show that information is quickly integrated into event models during event perception and that this integration of information into coherent event models in working memory is a constructive process based on backward inferences.|$|E
30|$|The {{comprehension}} of dynamic naturalistic events poses {{at least two}} challenges to the cognitive system: filtering relevant information with attention and dealing with information that was missing or missed. With four experiments, we studied the completion of missing information despite full attention. Participants watched short soccer video clips and we informed participants that we removed a critical moment of ball contact in half of the clips. We asked participants to detect whether these moments of ball contact were present or absent. In Experiment 1, participants gave their detection responses either directly during an event or delayed after an event. Although participants directed their full attention toward the critical contact moment, {{they were more likely}} to indicate seeing the missing ball contact if it was followed by a causally matching scene than if it was followed by an unrelated scene, both for the immediate and delayed responses. Thus, <b>event</b> <b>completion</b> occurs quickly. In Experiment 2, only a causally matching scene but neither a white mask nor an irrelevant scene caused the completion of missing information. This indicates that the completion of missing information is caused by backward inferences rather than predictive perception. In Experiment 3, we showed that <b>event</b> <b>completion</b> occurs directly during a trial and does not depend on expectations built up after seeing the same causality condition multiple times. In Experiment 4, we linked our findings to event cognition by asking participants to perform a natural segmentation task. We conclude that observers complete missing information during coherent events based on a fast backward inference mechanism even when directing their attention toward the missing information.|$|E

These [...] "Openings" [...] as they are known, are generally first spotted by amateurs operating SSB and CW modes since amateurs using these modes are always alert for ducting or signal enhancement <b>events.</b> <b>Completion</b> of contacts using these weak signal modes involves the exchange of signal level reports and location by grid square which is known as the Maidenhead Locator System.

30|$|As in Experiment 1, we ran an {{additional}} {{analysis on the}} proportion of contact responses to investigate the influence of our manipulations on hits and false alarms. Thus, we calculated a mixed ANOVA with the factors contact (present, absent; within), causality (causal, non-causal; between) and mask (mask, no mask; within) and the dependent-measure proportion of contact responses. Most importantly, {{there was a significant}} three-way interaction of contact, causality and mask, F (1, 38) = 14.72, p[*]<[*]. 001, ηp 2 [*]=[*]. 28. As is evident from Fig. 4, this interaction is mainly driven by a selective increase in false-alarm rates in the condition with causal continuation and no mask. This supports our conclusion from the contact-detection performance analysis, that <b>event</b> <b>completion</b> occurred only when a causal continuation was shown and no mask was present. In contrast, the masked conditions and non-causal continuation conditions caused similar response patterns. This pattern of results suggests that <b>event</b> <b>completion</b> is caused by backward inferences rather than predictive perception. The other effects of the ANOVA were as follows. There was a non-significant main effect of causality, F (1, 38) = 2.86, p[*]=[*]. 099, ηp 2 [*]=[*]. 07, a significant main effect of mask, F (1, 38) = 16.58, p[*]<[*]. 001, ηp 2 [*]=[*]. 30, a significant main effect of contact, F (1, 38) = 108.30, p[*]<[*]. 001, ηp 2 [*]=[*]. 74, a significant interaction of causality and mask, F (1, 38) = 18.93, p[*]<[*]. 001, ηp 2 [*]=[*]. 33, a non-significant interaction of causality and contact, F (1, 38) = 4.01, p[*]=[*]. 052, ηp 2 [*]=[*]. 10, and a significant interaction of mask and contact, F (1, 38) = 18.21, p[*]<[*]. 001, ηp 2 [*]=[*]. 32.|$|E
30|$|In a final analysis, we {{investigated}} response times for hits. We calculated a mixed ANOVA using the factors causality (causal, non-causal; between) and mask (mask, no mask; within) and the dependent-measure response times for hits. There {{was a significant}} main effect of causality, F (1, 38) = 6.56, p[*]=[*]. 015, ηp 2 [*]=[*]. 15. The main effect of mask, F (1, 38) = 0.66, p[*]=[*]. 420, ηp 2 [*]=[*]. 02, and the interaction of causality and mask, F (1, 38) = 2.28, p[*]=[*]. 139, ηp 2 [*]=[*]. 06, were not significant. Thus, there was a general increase of response times for participants assigned to the causal condition. As was the case in Experiment 1, mean response times in the causal continuation without mask condition indicate that <b>event</b> <b>completion</b> occurs quickly.|$|E
30|$|Following the event-completion paradigm, we used filmic cuts to {{manipulate}} the deletion of information and the presentation of either causal or non-causal continuations. While the use of filmic cuts could {{be considered to be}} a limitation of this paradigm, narrative comprehension is hardly influenced by cuts and observers even miss a significant amount of cuts if their main task is the detection of cuts (Smith & Henderson, 2008; Smith & Martin-Portugues Santacreu, 2017). Therefore, we assume that our findings might transfer to natural environments even though we studied <b>event</b> <b>completion</b> with filmic cuts. Nonetheless, we consider it a main challenge of future research to further investigate the processes occurring during the perception of ongoing events (Huff & Papenmeier, 2017). Possible research questions include the completion of information that was missed due to attentional lapses and the completion of information missing due to perceptual constraints such as saccadic suppression (Matin, 1974).|$|E
