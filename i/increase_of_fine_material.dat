40|$|High {{hydrophobicity}} of polycyclic {{aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs) is the most limiting factor for the remediation of polluted soils and aquifers. The present study analyzes the effect of three nonionic surfactants (Tween 80, BS- 400, and Gold Crew) and the granulometry of soil (1 %, 5 %, 10 %, and 20 % of clay and silt) on desorption of a PAH mixture (fluorene, phenanthrene, anthracene, and pyrene). As a general trend, decrease of fine material content and increase of surfactant concentration raises desorption. However, some particularities {{have to be considered}} depending on granulometry together with the surfactant applied. Furthermore, <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> <b>fine</b> <b>material</b> content tends to reduce the importance of the PAH properties, e. g., K ow and solubility, in desorption. To complete the remediation process, biodegradation by Trametes versicolor was tested with the surfactant Tween 80. Results indicate that a high concentration of surfactant does not affect the efficiency of fungus bioremediation. Nevertheless, high fine material content in soil/aquifer can reduce the degradation rate. Moreover, desorption and biodegradation used synergically guarantee better overall results in the remediation of soils polluted by PAH mixtures than other methods that separate desorption and remediation.

40|$|A {{number of}} studies have been {{published}} in the last few decades on Pleistocene palaeo-temperature reconstruction based on isotopic studies on deep sea cores and ice core records from Greenland. Such temporal high-resolution data represents northern hemispheric circulations and has to be reconfirmed through the study of terrestrial archives in order to recognise the character of such fluctuations in different regions. Loess-palaeosol sequences (LPSs) are suitable to interpret them as palaeoenvironmental archives, because loess is a widely distributed terrestrial deposit and is datable using luminescence techniques. The Saxon loess region (SLR) is characterised by a loess cover of ca. 8 m thickness, mainly representing deposits of the last glacial cycle. Over the past 35 years, Saxon loess remains under-researched wherefore a reactivation with the objective of contributing to the European loess research is important. There is a clear need to re-examine Saxon LPSs and close this gap of knowledge, because in recent years much work has been done on important and European-wide known loess sections as well as in adjacent loess areas. In this study, LPSs from Saxony were investigated and a regional palaeoenvironmental reconstruction of the last Glacial/Interglacial cycle was developed. The established stratigraphical scheme has to be advanced by results of optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating. The stratigraphical results should be compared with previous work from Saxony and with results from adjacent loess areas, to verify if our results have to be interpreted as singularities or if they are in accordance with known European conceptions. Therefore, 8 sections, mostly never investigated before, were described and correlated with each other to finally generate an independent standard stratigraphy for this area. Carbonate content, pH-value, soil organic matter, total and pedogenic iron, magnetic susceptibility and classical grain size analyses were obtained from every section. Furthermore, rare earth elements concentrations were measured from selected positions in order to prove if there are variations in the deposit composition during the glaciation. The OSL dating results were processed by Kreutzer (2012). As previously noted, the first step towards a regional palaeoenvironmental reconstruction was to establish a standard stratigraphic scheme where all found units are involved. Based on features regarding grain size distribution, the found palaeosols and the magnetic susceptibility Baumgart et al. (2013), 5 units could be defined. Unit V reflects the pre-Weichselian sediments modified by the Eemian soil formation. Unit IV contains deposits {{from the beginning of the}} Weichselian glaciation. Typically, this unit starts with the first Weichselian deposit, a bright-greyish Mn- and Fe-precipitates enriched layer which shows an aggregation of charcoal at its top. This layer is covered by a greyish, humus-enriched and reworked relict of a Chernozem-like soil. After a Gelic Gleysol and a reddish-brownish soil sediment, a loess package with an embedded interstadial Cambisol-like soil is preserved. The top of the unit is represented by another brownish soil sediment which forms the lower part of the Gleina complex. Typically, unit IV is characterised by stronger reworked layers and soil sediments but at the Rottewitz section an older loess package is preserved. Unit III represents the reactivation of aeolian sedimentation. The base of this unit is made up of a strong Gelic Gleysol (upper part of the Gleina complex). The deposits of this unit are mostly pedogenically overprinted and show features of at least two Gelic Gleysols. Unit II is dominated by unweathered loess. Its lower part (unit IIb) is built of a more stratified loess facies whereas the upper part (unit IIa) is built of a homogeneous loess facies. They are separated by a strong Gelic Gleysol. Unit I represent the upper part of the loess section, which is modified by the Holocene and Late Pleistocene soil development. Within this succession, a huge hiatus is found between unit III and IV of ca. 35 ka. It is labelled as the Gleina complex according to Lieberoth (1963). Furthermore, we demonstrate how combined analyses of high-resolution grain size distributions and microscopic analysis can be used to discriminate depositional and pedogenetic features of loess-palaeosol profiles from the SLR. Generally, it was observed that an increase of coarse material is linked with an increase of the mineralogical components which refers to slope processes. Rounded shapes of Mn- and Fe-precipitates, mostly found in Early Weichselian humus layers, indicate strong interstadial soil development modified by subsequent redeposition. Further observations suggest that the class of medium sand is dominated by secondary precipitates. The varying amount of very fine sand shows that sequences are cyclically built up of pure loess comparable to the Nussloch section. Studying coarse grain size fractions by microscopic analysis, a differentiation between loessic layers formed by periglacial slope processes and layers overprinted by pedogenetic processes is possible. Furthermore, an <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> <b>fine</b> <b>material</b> and secondary Mn- and Fe-precipitates can be attributed to soil forming processes (clay formation, redoximorphic processes, and illuviation). Additionally, a palaeoenvironmental reconstruction for the Late Pleistocene is proposed. As palaeo-temperature proxies ice wedges, pure loess sedimentation or the platy soil structure due to former ice lensing for cold periods and soil formations or vegetation remnants for warmer periods were used. A reconstruction of wind speed is directly deduced from the very fine sand content. The stability/instability of the landscape surface could be indicated by soil formation (stable) or through an increase of coarse sand (active). The type of soil development for the reconstruction is of major importance. For example, a humus enriched soil indicates warmer and dryer conditions than a Gelic Gleysol. The results of grain size analyses reveal a similar temporal and lithogenic pattern of Weichselian aeolian dynamics of the study area and other records from Europe. Furthermore, grain size results independently confirm the luminescence chronology of the studied sections. Reworked loess-like sediments show varying OSL age estimates; aeolian loess shows a systematic change of OSL ages. Generally, the findings of this study agree with observations from other loess areas. In most areas, a similar hiatus between Middle and Upper Weichselians is documented. Additionally, OSL dating suggests that we found an older loess package with an age between ca. 60 and 70 ka and a younger loess package with an age of ca. 15 and 30 ka. These periods of aeolian deposition are in accordance with MIS 4 and MIS 2 as well as with dust concentrations results derived from lake sediments and from ice cores. A major finding of this study is that we uncover the internal differences of loess-palaeosol sequences regarding their temporal resolution. In periods of loess sedimentation, a temporally high-resolution record is preserved. In contrast, in periods dominated by interstadial soil development or redeposition, a temporal low-resolution record is preserved and a reconstruction of palaeoenvironment is almost impossible. In den vergangenen Jahrzehnten wurden viele Studien über die Rekonstruktion der pleistozänen Temperaturentwicklung veröffentlicht, welche anhand von Isotopenanalysen aus Tiefsee- und Eisbohrkernen des grönländischen Eises abgeleitet werden konnten. In solchen zeitlich hochaufgelösten Daten sind nordhemisphärische Klimaschwankungen repräsentiert und diese sollten durch Untersuchungen terrestrischer Archive validiert und deren regionale Ausprägung in verschiedenen Räumen abgeschätzt werden. Löss-Paläobodensequenzen eignen sich hervorragend als Paläoumweltarchiv, da der Löss ein weit verbreitetes Sediment und mittels Lumineszenzverfahren datierbar ist. Die Sächsische Lössregion ist durch eine ca. 8 m mächtige Lössdecke charakterisiert, welche vornehmlich aus Ablagerungen des letzten glazialen Zyklus besteht. In den vergangenen 35 Jahren wurde die Lössforschung in diesem Raum vernachlässigt, sodass eine Wiederbelebung wichtig ist, um einen Beitrag zur europäischen Lössforschung zu leisten. Da in den letzten Jahren an wichtigen europäischen Lössprofilen, wie auch in angrenzenden Lössregionen, intensiv geforscht wurde besteht der dringende Bedarf, die Forschungen an sächsischen Löss-Paläobodensequenzen wieder aufzunehmen und die entstandene Wissenslücke zu schließen. In dieser Studie werden sächsische Löss-Paläobodensequenzen untersucht und eine regionale Umweltrekonstruktion für den letzten glazialen Zyklus vorgestellt. Die Standardstratigraphie wird dabei durch optisch stimulierte Lumineszenz (OSL) -Alter erweitert. Die Ergebnisse werden mit älteren Arbeiten aus diesem Raum verglichen, um abzuschätzen, ob es sich hierbei um Einzelbefunde handelt oder ob sich die Ergebnisse in schon bekannte europäische Konzepte einordnen lassen. Es werden 8, meist noch nie bearbeitete Profile beschrieben und miteinander korreliert, um schließlich eine unabhängige Standardstratigraphie für diesen Raum zu erarbeiten. Von jedem Profil wurde der Kalkgehalt, der pH-Wert, der Anteil der organischen Substanz, das pedogene und Gesamteisen, die magnetische Suszeptibilität und die Korngrößenverteilung (klassisch) bestimmt. Zudem wurde die Konzentration der Seltene Erden Elemente an ausgewählten Positionen bestimmt, um zu prüfen, ob es Verschiebungen in der mineralogischen Zusammensetzungen über das letzte Glazial hinweg gab. Die OSL-Datierungen wurden dabei von Kreutzer (2012) realisiert. Wie schon erläutert wurde, bestand der erste Arbeitsschritt darin, eine Standardstratigraphie zu erarbeiten, worin alle Befunde integriert werden können. Auf Grundlage der Korngrößenverteilung, der gefundenen Paläoböden und der magnetischen Suszeptibilität Baumgart et al. (2013) konnten 5 Einheiten ausgewiesen werden. Die Einheit V stellt die prä-weichselzeitlichen Sedimente dar, welche von der eemzeitlichen Bodenbildung überprägt wurden. Einheit IV beinhaltet die Sedimente vom Beginn der Weichselkaltzeit. Typischerweise befindet sich an der Basis dieser Einheit eine hellgraue, an Mn- und Fe-Konkretionen angereicherte Schicht, welche eine Häufung von Holzkohlebruchstücken im oberen Bereich zeigt. Diese Schicht ist wiederum von einem Rest einer schwarzerdeähnlichen Bodenbildung überlagert und zeigt eine Anreicherung an organischer Substanz. Über einem Nassboden und einem rotbraunen Bodensediment ist ein Lösspaket, mit einem zwischengelagerten interstadialen braunerdeartigen Boden, erhalten. Der obere Bereich der Einheit IV ist durch ein weiteres rötlichbraunes Bodensediment geprägt, welches dem unteren Teil des Gleinaer Komplexes entspricht. Normalerweise ist die Einheit IV in Sachsen durch stark umgelagerte Schichten charakterisiert, jedoch ist im Profil Rottewitz in dieser Einheit ein älteres Lösspaket erhalten. Die Einheit III repräsentiert eine Reaktivierung der äolischen Sedimentation. Ihre Basis bildet ein kräftiger Nassboden (oberer Teil des Gleinaer Komplex). Die Sedimente dieser Einheit sind meist pedogen überprägt und es können mindestens zwei separate Nassböden ausgewiesen werden. Die Einheit II besteht vornehmlich aus unverwittertem kalkhaltigen Löss. Ihr unterer Abschnitt (Einheit IIb) wird durch eine streifige Löss-Fazies gebildet, wohingegen der obere Teil von einer homogenen Löss-Fazies dominiert wird. Diese sind durch einen kräftigen Nassboden voneinander getrennt. Die Einheit I bildet den oberen Teil des Lössprofiles und ist durch die pedogene Überprägung der spätpleistozänen und holozänen Bodenentwicklung geprägt. In dieser Abfolge ist ein Alterssprung von ca. 35 ka zwischen der Einheit IV und III nachgewiesen. Dieser Hiatus befindet sich im durch Lieberoth (1963) definierten Gleinaer Komplex. Weiterhin konnte gezeigt werden, dass mit Hilfe einer kombinierten Untersuchung aus Korngrößenanalyse und Mikroskopieren es möglich ist, eine durch Bodenbildung bedingte und eine durch Umlagerung hervorgerufenen Überformung von Lösssedimenten voneinander zu unterscheiden. Generell wurde festgestellt, dass ein Anstieg der groben Kornfraktionen oft mit einer Erhöhung der mineralischen Komponente einhergeht und dies auf laterale Umlagerungsprozesse hindeutet. Abgerundete Mn- und Fe-Konkretionen aus humosen frühweichselzeitlichen Schichten lassen eine kräftige interstadiale Bodenentwicklung mit anschließender Umlagerung vermuten. Es wurde zudem festgestellt, dass die Mittelsandfraktion durch sekundäre Fe- und Mn-Konkretionen dominiert wird. Der variierende Feinstsandanteil zeigt, dass die Sequenzen in verschiedenen Zyklen aus unverwittertem Löss aufgebaut wurden, wie es auch aus dem Profil Nussloch beschrieben wird. Bodenbildungsprozesse bedingen demgegenüber ein Anstieg der Feinkomponenten und der Mn- und Fe-Konkretionen in den Sandfraktionen. Weiterhin wird eine Paläoumweltrekonstruktion für das Spätpleistozän vorgeschlagen. Hierbei werden verschiedenste Indikatoren als Paläotemperaturzeiger herangezogen. Für kalte Phasen stehen zum Beispiel Eiskeilpseudomorphosen, Pakete aus unverwittertem Löss oder plattige Strukturen infolge von Schichteisbildung. Für wärmere Phasen sprechen Paläoböden oder Pflanzenreste. Eine Rekonstruktion der Paläowindgeschwindigkeiten wird direkt über die Feinstsandanteile abgeleitet. Die Stabilität einer Landschaftoberfläche wird durch Bodenbildungen (stabil) oder einem Anstieg der groben Sandkomponenten (aktiv) repräsentiert. Den Paläoböden kommt bei einer solchen Rekonstruktion eine Schlüsselstellung zugute. Zum Beispiel signalisiert ein Steppenboden wärmere und trockenere Bedingungen im Vergleich mit einem Nassboden. Die Ergebnisse der Korngrößenuntersuchungen zeigen, dass hinsichtlich ihres Aufbaues und ihrer chronologischen Einordnung die äolisch dominierten Phasen der sächsischen Lössprofile bekannten Mustern aus anderen Archiven in Europa folgen. Zudem zeigt sich, dass die Ergebnisse der Korngrößenverteilung die mittels OSL bestimmten Alter untermauern. Umgelagerte Sedimente zeigen größere Altersschwankungen, wohingegen äolische Sedimente eine kontinuierliche Altersentwicklung haben. Die Ergebnisse dieser Untersuchungen stimmen mit Beobachtungen aus anderen Lössgebieten überein. In den meisten Regionen wird ein ähnlicher Hiatus zwischen der mittleren und oberen Weichselkaltzeit beschrieben. Zudem deuten die OSL-Ergebnisse an, dass in Sachsen ein älteres Lösspaket mit einem Alter von ca. 60 bis 70 ka und ein jüngeres Lösspaket mit einem Alter von ca. 15 bis 30 ka existiert. Die beiden äolischen Phasen korrelieren mit der marinen Isotopenstufe 4 (MIS) beziehungsweise der MIS 2, sowie mit Ergebnissen pleistozäner Staubkonzentration der Atmosphäre, abgeleitet aus Seesedimenten oder Eisbohrkernen. Eine wichtige Erkenntnis dieser Untersuchungen ist, dass wir innerhalb eines Lössprofiles Pakete unterschiedlicher zeitlicher Auflösung identifizieren konnten. Aus Phasen kräftiger Lösssedimentation sind zeitlich hoch aufgelöste Sequenzen erhalten. Demgegenüber ist aus Phasen, dominiert durch Bodenbildungen oder Umlagerungen, ein zeitlich nur sehr schlecht aufgelöstes Archiv erhalten, weshalb anhand dieser Abschnitte eine Paläoumweltrekonstruktion nur bedingt möglich ist...|$|E

Two extensive sampling campaigns were conducted in summer and winter low-flow conditions. Composite sediment samples were collected from ten reaches of the main river: the first was located in the upper region (ambient control), and the others downstream of the confluences of nine principal tributaries. The two sampling programs were paralleled by contemporary investigations on the macroinvertebrate community. The particle-size composition along the Po River showed a relatively uniform distribution <b>of</b> <b>fine</b> sand, a progressive downstream decrease of coarse sands and a corresponding <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> <b>fine</b> <b>materials.</b> The levels <b>of</b> polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), extractable organo halides (EOX), Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb and Zn were determined in sediment fine particles (< 63 mum), and showed marked changes across the ten river reaches. Their longitudinal trends, as those of organic carbon and total nitrogen, were very similar and largely independent of the survey season. Sediment quality benchmarks were used to evaluate sediment chemistry, and, although the overall level of contamination was from moderate to low, the reaches located downstream of the tributaries Dora Riparia, Dora Baltea, Lambro and Oglio {{were considered to be}} at risk. Sediments were tested for toxicity on Oncorhynchus mykiss, Ceriodaphnia dubia, Raphidocelis subcapitata and Vibrio fischeri. The toxicity tests were conducted both with sediment extracts and whole samples. Sediment extracts showed toxic potentials that were consistent with the spatial distribution of contaminants. Whole-sediment toxicity showed moderate/low effects which also included false positives and negatives. Alterations of the macroinvertebrate community were found for many kilometers downstream of Dora Riparia, and with a seasonal dependence, also in other reaches of the Italian river. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to describe the longitudinal and temporal changes of the Po River, and allowed the selection of the most useful and discriminating indicators...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to examine the effects that different methods of RAP stockpile fractionation have on the volumetric mix design properties for high-RAP content surface mixes, with the goal of meeting all specified criteria for standard HMA mix designs.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{pavement}} engineering has considerably evolved from many perspectives, {{with a general}} improvement of field performance. This improvement should attributed {{to the development of}} new materials and technologies and to a more careful management of resources in every stage of infrastructure life, from design to maintenance, through construction. The laying and compaction of hot-mix asphalt (HMA) {{is one of the most}} important issues to be taken into account since it is a stage that can negatively influence the whole life of a pavement. It is advisible to pay attention to the workability properties of HMA because only with the control of these and with a careful study of the factors that affect compaction it is possible to prevent unexpected performance problems during service life. This research work is set in this general framework, trying to give a further contribution to the actual knowledge of HMA workability. The aim of the research is to analyse critically the factors that affect compaction of HMA by means of laboratory investigations carried out with a SUPERPAVE Gyratory Shear Compactor. The study has been structured in different levels through which the influence of individual parameters on HMA compaction has been evaluated. This has been done by considering different mixture structures (i. e. different composition of the mixtures) and by taking into account the effects caused by variations of temperature and binder type. Part of the research has focused on the development of a rheological model for the simulation of the laboratory compaction process of HMA. This has lead to the detailed analysis of the effects caused by the various parameters on compaction. When considering final results. It can be pointed out that the workability factor k was observed to be independent from temperature and binder type. On the contrary, it proved to be sensitive to variations of the bitumen content and of the percentages <b>of</b> the <b>fine</b> aggregate fractions. In particular, workability was directly influenced by variations of filler content and of the quantities of aggregate material associated to sieves with an opening of 0. 400, 0. 180 and 0. 075 mm. By increasing the filler content, workability increases; by <b>increasing</b> the quantities <b>of</b> <b>fine</b> <b>material</b> associated to the abovementioned sieves, workability is reduced [...] This is due to the fact that more dense structures are obtained with the consequence of encountering a greater difficulty in reorganising and redistributing aggregates in the bulk of the mixture. Variations of the autocompaction parameter C 1 were also analysed. It was thus observed that such a parameter depends only upon the coarser aggregate fractions, and more specifically upon the maximum aggregate size. Only minor effects caused by variation of the binder content were noted. In the rheological modelling of the compaction process it was observed that the employed parameters are dependent upon a series of factors which are linked to the composition of the mixtures, to test conditions (especially to temperature) and to the level of compaction (number of gyrations and compaction pressure...|$|R

Data collected in 34 natural channels in northern California and southern Oregon indicate the following. (1) <b>Fine</b> <b>material</b> on the bed surface can be readily winnowed and transported at high particle velocities, {{much of it in}} intermittent suspension. <b>Fine</b> <b>material</b> can dominate the bed material load in gravel bed channels, but its abundance on the bed surface is limited by its increasing mobility as hiding places among prominent particles are filled. (2) <b>Fine</b> <b>material</b> in pools is typically replaced many times per year. (3) The proportion V * of residual pool volume filled with <b>fine</b> bed <b>material</b> correlates with annual sediment yield in channels whose parent material produces abundant sandy sediment. (4) Temporal and spatial changes in V * appear to correspond to variations in the balance between sediment inputs and water discharge. These results suggest that V * can be used to monitor and evaluate the supply <b>of</b> excess <b>fine</b> <b>material</b> in gravel bed channels and that samples <b>of</b> <b>fine</b> <b>material</b> in pools can characterize the <b>fine,</b> mobile mode <b>of</b> bed material load. 1...|$|R
50|$|The shendyt {{may have}} been an {{adaptation}} of early hunting skirts which allowed freedom of movement for the wearer. Members of the military wore a version of the shendyt, as they too would need freedom of movement in battle. Shendyts worn by those of higher rank or class would have been made <b>of</b> <b>finer</b> <b>materials.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{house was}} built on a slope with two floors, where the main floor is {{connected}} with the garden. It includes a number of variable sliding elements that allow for spatial groupings. By avoiding solid floor plan splits, Schwanzer created an atmosphere of large living space. The choice <b>of</b> <b>fine</b> <b>materials</b> adds to the intimacy of place.|$|R

25|$|The {{congregation}} had the Catalan-African ritual, with regulations {{similar to}} those of the congregation at Perpignan: among others was the enactment (1319) that Jews should not wear clothes <b>of</b> <b>finer</b> <b>material</b> than that specified in the code of the organization. Transgressors of this law were to be punished bodily after the king's consent had been obtained, or were to be excommunicated.|$|R
50|$|Significant {{deposits}} <b>of</b> <b>fine</b> <b>material</b> {{are restricted}} to but a few locales: Bancroft, Ontario, and Mont-Saint-Hilaire, Quebec, in Canada; and Litchfield, Maine, and Magnet Cove, Arkansas, in the US. The Ice River complex, near Golden, British Columbia, contains sodalite. Smaller deposits are found in South America (Brazil and Bolivia), Portugal, Romania, Burma and Russia. Hackmanite is found principally in Mont-Saint-Hilaire and Greenland.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the rest}} of the {{department}} there is deep soil resulting from water erosion of the mountainous area. Further eastward the soil is shallower and composed <b>of</b> <b>fine</b> <b>material</b> from the canal zone of the Quinto Cuartel division. This area is used as arable land and is irrigated through a network of channels that flow from the San Juan River.|$|R
