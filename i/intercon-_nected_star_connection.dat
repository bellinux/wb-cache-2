Hadoop–an open-source imple- mentation of MapReduce is widely used for short jobs requiring low response time. In this paper, We proposed a new preshuffling strategy in Hadoop to reduce high network loads imposed by shuffle-intensive applications. Designing new shuffling strategies is very appealing for Hadoop clusters where network <b>intercon-</b> <b>nects</b> are performance bottleneck when the clusters are shared among {{a large number of}} applications. The network interconnects are likely to become scarce resource when many shuffle-intensive applications are sharing a Hadoop cluster. We implemented the push model along with the preshuffling scheme in the Hadoop system, where the 2 -stage pipeline was incorporated with the preshuffling scheme. We implemented the push model and a pipeline along with the preshuffling scheme in the Hadoop system. Using two Hadoop benchmarks running on the 10 -node cluster, we conducted experiments to show that preshuffling-enabled Hadoop clusters are faster than native Hadoop clusters. For example, the push model and the preshuffling scheme powered by the 2 -stage pipeline can shorten the execution times of the WordCount and Sort Hadoop applications by an average of 10 % and 14 %, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 67 - 69). Network-on-Chip (NoC) is a {{new technology}} that embeds heterogeneous <b>intercon-</b> <b>nected</b> cores. NoC's design {{is based on a}} selected network topology, a switching tech- nique and a routing strategy in order to allow on chip communication. Its advantages over System-on-Chip (SoC) are that NoC provides modularity, higher performance, better structure, and compatibility with core designs and reuse. Trades-o exist be- tween them. In this thesis, we tackle the NoC core testing time problem. We use a grid topology, a variable Test Access Mechanism (TAM), a computed optimal it size based on the bandwidth and bu er size, the standard test wrapper, and XY routing strategy. Our goal is to test all cores, under the above constraints, while minimizing overall NoC test time. For this purpose, we have partitioned the cores into sets using two partitioning techniques. The rst is based on grouping together all cores that have similar or close core testing time, and the second is partitioned based on the lower bound computed for each benchmark. In order to evaluate our work, we present experimental results that are compared to each other. 1 bound copy: xi, 67 leaves; col. ill.; 30 cm. available at RNL...|$|R

(Electrical And Electronic Engineering) In-vehicle Power Line Communication (PLC) is an {{emerging}} technology {{that can easily}} bene t the automotive industry by {{reducing the amount of}} wires (and hence cost, weight and complexity) for vehicle wire harnesses. The reduction in weight would also lead to less fuel consumption. This dissertation aims at taking the research of this technology a step towards fully understanding the vehicle's power line as a communication medium. We investigate the bit error characteristics of a readily available transceiver on the vehicle's power bus. To do so, we develop and perform bit error recording over the medium to get experimental results with the battery line under di ferent operating conditions. Using the rst set of these results, we parametrise di erent kinds of Markov models to see which one simulates the channel best. Using the preferred model, we then model the rest of the sets of results so that we can simulate the channel's bit error characteristics under these di erent conditions. Using these models, we demonstrate how these simulations can be used to evaluate the performance of di erent error detection and correction techniques. In particular, we evaluate the error detection mechanisms used in the popular in-vehicle Local <b>Intercon-</b> <b>nect</b> Network (LIN) protocol, in addition to some simple error correction techniques...|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} {{computational}} kernels where parallelism can be exploited in applica- tion specific hardware, yielding significant speedup over a general purpose processor based solution. Commodity cluster computing technologies have been combined with FPGA co- processors, resulting in even greater performance capability through {{the exploitation of}} multiple levels of parallelism. One particularly economic solution {{both in terms of}} cost and power consumption is to cluster hybrid FPGAs with commodity network <b>intercon-</b> <b>nects.</b> Hybrid FPGAs combine embedded microprocessors with reconfigurable hardware resources on a single chip offering lower power consumption and cost compared to a tra- ditional I/O bus FPGA coprocessor solution. While {{there is a lot of}} promise in using com- modity hybrid FPGAs in a cluster configuration, the design flow and performance char- acteristics of such systems are currently a limiting factor to the range of applications that could benefit from such a system. The contribution of this thesis is a framework for clustering commodity FPGAs which integrates high speed DMA data transfers with a flexible FPGA resource sharing scheme enabled through partial reconfiguration. The framework includes an embedded Linux op- erating system, with a custom device driver to manage data transfers and hardware recon- figuration. User space tools for cluster computing including ssh and MPI are deployed allowing tasks to be split among nodes in the cluster. Performance analysis is performed with a homogeneous cluster composed of four Virtex- 5 FXT based FPGA boards.

Such devices are particularly vulnerable to security and privacy threats, because of their limited computing resources and relatively weak physical security. We investigate possible cryptographic solutions to security and privacy problems arising in two kinds of emerging pervasive computing networks: Personal Area Net- works (PANs) and the EPCglobal Network. A number of key management schemes have been proposed for use in PANs, but these schemes only support key management within a PAN. However, as people are increasingly equipped with multiple wireless devices, PANs {{are likely to be}} <b>intercon-</b> <b>nected</b> to share information or services. We introduce a term, iPANs, to name such interconnected PANs. We define system models and design goals for key manage- ment in iPANs, and propose a novel security initialisation scheme for use in iPANs. The proposed scheme achieves desirable security and efficiency properties by making use of the unique characteristics of PANs. The EPCglobal Network is designed to give efficiency and cost savings in and beyond the supply chain using Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology; however, privacy threats affecting such networks are particularly serious. We construct a formal privacy model for RFID systems accurately reflecting adversarial threats and power. We then give brief privacy analysis for the existing privacy-enhanced RFID schemes which have received wide attention in the literature. We then construct a secure refresh-based RFID system based on re-encryption techniques, and prove its privacy using the defined privacy model. Finally, we show that the proposed scheme can greatly enhance the security and privacy of EPC tags, making the maximum use of given tag functionalities as specified in the standards...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} {{applications}} of the network coding technique for <b>intercon-</b> <b>nect</b> optimization and improving the routability of Very-large-scale integration (VLSI) designs. The goal of the routing process is to connect the required sets of sources and sinks while minimizing the total wirelength and reducing congestion. Typically, chip interconnects include multiple sinks and are routed through intermediate nodes. The main idea of the network coding technique is to enable the intermediate nodes to generate new signals by combining the signals received over their incoming wires. This {{is in contrast to}} the traditional approaches, in which an intermediate node can only forward the incoming signals. This thesis attempts to explore the possible ben- efits of the network coding technique for reducing the total wirelengh and mitigating congestion in VLSI designs. The contribution of the thesis is three-fold. First, we extend the Hanan?s theo- rem for multi-net rectilinear coding networks. Second, we propose several exact and heuristic solutions for finding near-optimal routing topologies that utilize network coding techniques. Next, we perform extensive simulation study to evaluate the ad- vantage of network coding over the traditional approaches. The simulations help to identify routing instances where the network coding techniques are expected to be beneficial. Finally, we evaluate the potential benefits from network coding in practical settings by analyzing its performance on the International Symposium on Physical Design (ISPD) benchmarks. Our results show that while network coding shows upto 2. 43 % improvement on unconstrained rectilinear grids, it shows upto 4. 34 % improvement in cases with con- straints along the grid. In addition, it shows an improvement upto 8. 4 % in cases involving congestion reduction and also improves routing performance on ISPD rout- ing benchmarks...|$|R

40|$|Tissue {{engineering}} {{offers an}} interesting alternative to current {{anterior cruciate ligament}} (ACL) surgeries. Indeed, a tissue-engineered solution could ideally overcome the long- term complications due to actual ACL reconstruction by being gradually replaced by biological tissue. Key requirements concerning the ideal scaffold for ligament tissue en- gineering are numerous and concern its mechanical properties, biochemical nature, and morphology. This study is aimed at predicting the morphology of a novel scaffold for ligament tissue engineering, based on multilayer braided biodegradable copoly(lactic acid-co-(e-caprolactone)) (PLCL) fibers The process used to create the scaffold is briefly presented, and the degradations of the material {{before and after the}} scaffold processing are compared. The process offers varying parameters, such as the number of layers in the scaffold, the pitch length of the braid, and the fibers’ diameter. The prediction of the mor- phology in terms of pore size distribution and pores interconnectivity as a function of these parameters is performed numerically using an original method based on a virtual scaffold. The virtual scaffold geometry and the prediction of pore size distribution are evaluated by comparison with experimental results. The presented process permits crea- tion of a tailorable scaffold for ligament tissue engineering using basic equipment and from minimum amounts of raw material. The virtual scaffold geometry closely mimics the geometry of real scaffolds, and the prediction of the pore size distribution is found to be in good accordance with measurements on real scaffolds. The scaffold offers an <b>intercon-</b> <b>nected</b> network of pores the sizes of which are adjustable by playing on the process pa- rameters and are able to match the ideal pore size reported for tissue ingrowth. The adjustability of the presented scaffold could permit its application in both classical ACL reconstructions and anatomical double-bundle reconstructions. The precise knowledge of the scaffold morphology using the virtual scaffold will be useful to interpret the activity of cells once it will be seeded into the scaffold. An interesting perspective of the present work is to perform a similar study aiming at predicting the mechanical response of the scaffold according to the same process parameters, by implanting the virtual scaffold into a finite element algorithm.

40|$|In {{the modern}} deep-submicron Very Large Integrated Circuit(VLSI) design flow <b>intercon-</b> <b>nect</b> delays are {{becoming}} major limiting factor for timing closure. Traditional placement algorithms such as routability-driven placement (improves routability) and wirelength- driven placement (reduces total wirelength) {{are no longer}} sufficient to close timing. To this end, timing-driven placement {{plays a crucial role}} in reducing the interconnect delay through timing critical paths (paths with timing violations/negative slacks) of the design and thereby achieving specific performance/clock frequency. In the placement flow, timing information about the design can be incorporated during global placement and/or incremental/detailed placement. Although, over the years, there has been significant advances in the quality of the global placement, there is a growing need for high performance incremental timing-driven placement {{due to the lack of}} accurate interconnect information during global placement. Moreover, incremental timing-driven placement is essential to recover timing while preserving the other optimization objectives such as total wirelength, routing congestion, and so forth which are optimized at the early stages of the design flow. This thesis proposes a simple, yet efficient, incremental timing-driven placement algo- rithm that seeks to find optimized locations for standard cells so that the total negative slack of the design can be maximized. Our algorithm consists two stages: (1) Global Move which positions standard cells inside a critical bounding box to eliminate timing violations on timing critical nets; and (2) Local Move which provides further timing improvement by finely adjusting the current locations of the standard cells within a local region. We evaluate our algorithm using ICCAD- 2014 timing-driven placement contest bench- marks. The results show that, on average, our technique eliminates 94 % and 30 % of the late and early total negative slacks, respectively, and, 82 % and 27 % of the late and early worst negative slacks, respectively, under short and long displacement constraints. The 1 st-place team of the contest improves late and early total negative slacks by 90 % and 39 %, respectively, and improves late and early worst negative slack by 76 % and 32 %, re- spectively. Taking into account both timing violation improvement and the placement quality (i. e., other objectives), on average, we outperform the 1 st-place team by 3 % in terms of the ICCAD- 2014 contest quality score and our technique is 4. 6 × faster in terms of runtime...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to explore the {{potential}} of GaN Schottky diodes for high fre- quency signal generation and control, with emphasis on their power handling capability. GaN Schottky diodes are expected to provide superior power handling capability due to the wide band-gap of GaN. Theoretical analysis has been performed analytically and numerically. Devices have been fabricated and their performance has been evaluated experimentally. Demonstration of monolithic integrated circuits utilizing the realized devices was also made. The diode figure of merits e. g. Cj 0, Rs, Vbr, have been considered with respect to power handling and harmonic generation to permit evaluation of the diode design requirements for satisfying specific circuit needs. Numerical simulation allowed the prediction of device performance for specific geometry and material properties. Simulation results have shown that GaN Schottky diodes have a power handling capability at least 2 times higher than their GaAs counterparts, while maintaining acceptable losses. Several fabrication technology approaches have been studied and implemented for real- izing GaN-based Schottky diodes. Their key steps include dry etching, metal contacts, as well as interconnects. The surface treatment before metal deposition necessary for good quality Schottky contacts has been thoroughly studied. Three means of <b>intercon-</b> <b>nect</b> methods were demonstrated for on-wafer tests. They allowed rapid evaluation of the electrical characteristics of the diodes {{and set up the}} basis for the development of monolithic integrated circuits. High frequency small-signal measurements have been performed for the GaN Schot- tky diodes. The obtained S-parameters were used to extract equivalent circuit models. A parameter extraction procedure was established to de-embed the pad parasitics, and obtaining information about their intrinsic elements permitting in this way diode opti- mization. The large-signal characteristics of the fabricated diodes were measured on-wafer using a large-signal network analyzer. This novel characterization method provided immediate information about diode features such as power handling, loss etc. The time-domain waveforms of the diodes were obtained under various operating conditions allowing a better insight into the diode operation. Large-signal models of the diodes have been obtained by considering the extracted small- signal equivalent circuit characteristics and the large-signal measurement results. GaN- based circuits using diodes have been studied. They include a frequency doubler and an analog phase shifter. Consideration of their large-signal characteristics was possible using the extracted diode large-signal models. Doublers made with this technology are expected to provide an output power of 10 dBm at 94 GHz. MMIC phase shifters were designed, fabricated and characterized.
