40|$|In {{order to}} satisfy the demand for high quality video streaming, {{aggressive}} compres-sion is necessary.

Our work aims to control this complexity in the context of real-time <b>hardware</b> video <b>codecs.</b> Our work focused on two specific areas: Motion Compensation Band-width and Intra Estimation. HEVC uses larger filters for motion compensation leading to a significant increase in decoder bandwidth.

50|$|In Icom's radio line, D-STAR does {{significantly}} add to {{the cost}} of a radio, which is a barrier to the adoption of the technology. In 2006 the cost of a D-STAR radio was compared to that of a standard analog radio, and the price difference was nearly double. This is due partly to the per-unit cost for the voice <b>codec</b> <b>hardware</b> and/or license and partly to manufacturer research and development costs that need to be amortized. As is the case with any product, as more units are sold, the R&D portion of the cost will decrease over time. The D-STAR capable radios also cost more than their equivalents from other brands, even before the D-STAR options boards are added (in the UK as of April 2011, Martin Lynch & Sons' website lists the Icom 2820 (without D-STAR) at £489, while the equivalent Yaesu, the FT8800, is listed at just £337).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} interaction between speech codec output quality and simulated satellite or VoIP transmission delay time on talker performance in a complex interaction. A <b>hardware</b> test <b>codec</b> (both single and tandem) was compared against a number of processed speech reference conditions to determine the relative subjective quality of the test codecs against conditions with known Mean Opinion Scores (MOS). The two codec conditions plus an additional higher quality condition were then used in an experiment that examined {{the effect of the}} interaction of transmitted speech quality and simulated transmission delay on a speech shadowing task and an accompanying error repair task involving two speakers. One person (the “reader”) read a passage. The second person (the “shadower”) shadowed the read passage by repeating immediately the words spoken by the reader. The reader, whilst reading, also listened for errors spoken by the shadower and repaired those errors by verbally reporting them to the shadower. A significant interaction between codec quality and transmission delay was found for the error repair task, but only for cases where the shadower made a significant number of errors. These results suggest that, for highly complex interactions which involve significant cognitive load, human performance will degrade more rapidly with increases in delay for transmission systems using speech codecs with lower quality output. This is assumed to be due to the additional demands upon working memory imposed by the transmission delay. 22 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Abstract-A turbo code codec is {{implemented}} as {{a portion of}} a modem in a software radio. The performance of this software radio is tested in a Monte Carlo simulation and on a <b>hardware</b> testbed. The <b>codec</b> uses two punctured rate 1 / 2 constituent codes and a 16383 -bit pseudo-random interleaver to produce a net rate ~ 1 / 2 turbo code. The modem generates a binary phaseshift keyed modulation on a 200 kHz carrier. Frame headers are inserted between interleaver blocks for synchronization of the receiver’s deinterleaver and to detect loss of carrier or symbol synchronization. Bit error rate performance curves are reported. The Monte Carlo simulation shows an implementation loss of about 0. 5 dB at threshold (i. e., an E b/N o of about 1 dB). This implementation loss is attributed to carrier and bit synchronization errors. The hardware testbed displayed a total implementation loss of about 2. 5 dB. The additional 2 dB loss over the Monte Carlo results can be attributed to detector mismatch and inter-symbol interference caused by unmodeled band-limiting filters of the hardware. Some of these filterinduced losses should be recoverable if an equalizer is added to the modem software. I...|$|R
50|$|To ensure {{provision}} of audio description, broadcasters typically use the AAC <b>codec.</b> <b>Hardware</b> restrictions allow {{only a single}} type of audio decoder to operate at any one time, so the main audio and the audio description must use the same encoding family {{for them to be}} successfully combined at the receiver. In the case of BBC HD, the main audio is coded as AAC-LC and only the audio description is encoded as HE-AAC. Neither AAC nor Dolby Digital Plus codecs are supported by most home AV equipment, which typically accept Dolby Digital or DTS, leaving owners with stereo, rather than surround sound, output. Transcoding from AAC to Dolby Digital or DTS and multi-channel output via HDMI was not originally necessary for Freeview HD certification. As of June 2010 the DTG D-Book includes the requirement for mandatory transcoding when sending audio via S/PDIF, and for either transcoding or multi-channel PCM audio when sending it via HDMI in order for manufacturers to gain Freeview HD certification from April 2011. Thus equipment sold as Freeview HD before April 2011 may not deliver surround sound to audio equipment (some equipment may, but this is not mandatory); later equipment must be capable of surround sound compatible with most suitable audio equipment.|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} few years, Gallager’s Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes have {{received}} a lot of attention and tremendous efforts have been devoted to analyze and improve their error-correcting performance. However, little consideration has been given to the practical LDPC <b>codec</b> <b>hardware</b> implementations. The straightforward fully parallel LDPC decoder architecture usually incurs too high complexity for many practical purposes, thus effective partly parallel decoder design approaches are highly desirable. Due to the randomness of LDPC code, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to develop a direct transformation from fully parallel architecture to partly parallel ones for a given LDPC code. Meanwhile, also because of its randomness, the direct LDPC encoding scheme has quadratic complexity in the block length, which makes the efficient encoder design not trivial. We believe that jointly conceiving code construction and decoder/encoder design is a promising direction to develop high performance LDPC coding systems. In this paper, we propose a joint () -regular LDPC code and decoder/encoder design approach to construct a class of () -regular LDPC codes that not only have very good performance but also exactly fit to a highspeed partly parallel decoder and low-complexity encoder. Moreover, we propose a modified joint design approach in order to further reduce the decoder hardware complexity for those high-rate () -regular LDPC codes applied to silicon area critical applications.

The trade offs between power utilization of the <b>codec</b> <b>hardware</b> and the power reduction due to lessening of switching transitions has also been understood. Different codecs may perform differently for different address sequences. We have generated the sequences of addresses of specified sequentiality and evaluated the performance of both codecs. The codecs are designed and synthesized using VHDL/Synopsis Tools. The VHDL models are then simulated in order to measure the dynamic power consumed by them when the bits are encoded and decoded. The total power including the power consumed by the bus is calculated. Various comparisons are made with the uncoded binary scheme. An optimum bus capacitance is also calculated which makes the usage of codecs beneficial.

30|$|Visual sensor {{networks}} (VSN) {{forms the}} crossroads of networking, image capturing, processing and rendering techniques, and distributed systems. These innovative networks are emerging as an important research challenge and gaining notice of both research community and applications developers. The contemporary VSN architectures are limited in approach and in design. For instance, none of these architectures takes into account civil infrastructure and geographical information in the placement and simultaneous activation of sensors or cameras or both. Likewise existing VSN architectures focus on capturing images in entirety, which tends to be redundant and at times even detrimental to user application requirements. Also, these schemes tend to overlook the constrained ambulatory behavior of mobile objects (MOs) such as varying mobility behavior in the interior and at the exterior of region of interest (RoI). Furthermore, these architectures do not reflect on features and attributes of captured images as means for defining the camera activation schedule and coordination between sensor nodes (SNs). Finally, hardware choices for VSNs are either limited to cameras mounted onto mobile assemblies or cameras using pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) assemblies, both involving mechanical motion. All in all, existing work makes strong assumptions about the presence and availability of video-customized <b>hardware</b> and <b>codecs,</b> bandwidths of the orders of megabit per second (Mbps), and mains power supply or unconstrained battery sources, all defining VSN design in concordance. In this research, we adopt contra-concordance by redefining and restricting VSN features to meet the limited capabilities of real wireless sensor networks (WSNs), which have limited form factors in computation and memory and are equipped with wireless transceivers. We propose VISTA, an architecture that involves redefining the video capturing capability of VSNs. The hardware for VISTA is deployed considering the civil infrastructure of RoI to be monitored. VISTA proposes a deployment scheme in which SNs are placed at optimal positions {{in order to make}} communication effective. Camera at the next hop SN is activated when MO comes in its range, such that redundant image is avoided. Only the SNs at the boundary of the RoI are activated to avoid unnecessary consumption of energy of interior SNs in the network.|$|R
