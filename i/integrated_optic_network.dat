40|$|In this chapter, {{consists}} of demand in optical networking for photonic components that meet performance criteria {{as well as}} economic requirements has opened the door for novel technologies capable of high-yield low cost manufacturing while delivering high performance and enabling unique functions. The most promising new technologies are based on integrated optics. Integration permits the parallel production of complex multif unction photonic circuit on asymmetric slab waveguide. This kind of waveguide has very important role for designing the integrated optical circuit. To obtain the high performance function, we need to observe the waveguide characteristic in transverse mode (TE mode and TM m ode), the waveguide structure, and materials. Hence, a thoroughly study on asymmetric slab waveguide is essential in future implementation of optical devices in optical network. Integrated optics is the technology of constructing optic devices and networks on substrates [1]. Integrated optics offers the capability of combining optics and electronic components on a single substrate to produce functional systems or subsystems.

40|$|This volwne {{contains}} the Proceedings of a two-week summer conference titled "Advances in Integrated Optics" held June 1 - 9, 1993, in Erice, Sicily. This was the 18 th annual course {{organized by the}} International School of Quantum Electronics, {{under the auspices of}} the "Ettore Majorana" Centre for Scientific Culture. The term <b>Integrated</b> <b>Optics</b> signifies guided-wave optical circuits consisting of two or more devices on a single substrate. Since its inception in the late 1960 's, <b>Integrated</b> <b>Optics</b> has evolved from a specialized research topic into a broad field of work, ranging from basic research through commercial applications. Today many devices are available on market while a big effort is devolved to research on integrated nonlinear optical devices. This conference was organized to provide a comprehensive survey of the frontiers of this technology, including fundamental concepts, nonlinear optical materials, devices both in the linear and nonlinear regimes, and selected applications. These Proceedings update and augment the material contained in a previous ISQE volume, "Integrated Optics: Physics and Applications", S. Martellucci and A. N.

40|$|Integrated optical {{devices are}} {{free from the}} {{alignment}} and stability issues that bedevil bulk optical devices and systems. Integrated optical devices are now widely deployed in fiber optic telecommunication systems and as sensor components. This thesis is a theoretical and experimental study of two new integrated optical sensors - an <b>integrated</b> <b>optic</b> ring resonator gyroscope for measuring angular rotation rate and an <b>integrated</b> <b>optic</b> beam combiner for stellar interferometry. Although passive <b>integrated</b> <b>optic</b> ring resonators for gyroscopes have been previously reported, little work has been performed for active rings. The sensitivity of the gyroscope {{is limited by the}} propagation losses in the ring, and hence can be improved by the introduction of loss-compensating gain inside the ring. In this thesis the first active ring resonator for gyroscopic applications is designed, fabricated and characterized. A 1. 6 cm diameter active ring resonator is fabricated in a neodymium-doped glass by silver ion exchange. The finesse of the ring resonator is measured and is observed to increase from approximately 11 to 250 when the neodymium ions inside the ring are optically pumped to produce gain. The ultimate sensitivity of a ring resonator gyroscope is shown from theoretical considerations to be fundamentally limited by the spontaneous emission noise generated within the gain medium. A closed form expression for this sensitivity is derived. <b>Integrated</b> <b>optic</b> beam combiners offer many advantages over conventional bulk optic implementations for astronomical imaging. To date, <b>integrated</b> <b>optic</b> beam combiners have only been demonstrated at operating wavelengths below 2 $mu$m. Operation in the mid-IR, however, is highly desirable. In this thesis an <b>integrated</b> <b>optic</b> beam combiner for stellar interferometry that operates in the mid-IR is demonstrated for the first time. The device is fabricated on a lithium niobate substrate for operation in the vicinity of 3. 4 $mu$m. Using this device, white-light, mid-infrared, fringes, as well as electro-optic on-chip fringe scanning, is demonstrated in the laboratory. A theoretical design technique based on three coupled waveguides is developed to achieve fully achromatic, broadband, polarization-insensitive, lossless beam combining.
