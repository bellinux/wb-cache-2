50|$|Schleicher told Hindenburg {{that his}} gruelling {{re-election}} campaign was {{the fault of}} Brüning. Schleicher claimed that Brüning could have had Hindenburg's term extended by the Reichstag, but that {{he chose not to}} in order to humiliate Hindenburg by making him appear on the same stage as Social Democratic leaders. When, in early April 1932, Brüning and Groener decided to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>SA</b> banned following complaints from Prussia and other Lander governments, Schleicher was at first supportive, but soon changed his mind and argued against a ban. Both Schleicher and his close friend, General Kurt von Hammerstein repeatedly contended to Groener that the Reichswehr leadership did not see the banning of the SA {{in the best interests of}} the Reich.|$|E
50|$|Hitler had his {{own reasons}} for wanting Röhm removed. Powerful {{supporters}} of Hitler had been complaining about Röhm for some time. The generals were fearful of Röhm's desire to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>SA,</b> a force of over three million men, absorb the much smaller German Army into its ranks under his leadership. Furthermore, reports of a huge cache of weapons {{in the hands of}} SA members gave the army commanders even more concern. Industrialists, who had provided the funds for the Nazi victory, were unhappy with Röhm's socialistic views on the economy and his claims that the real revolution had still to take place. Matters came to a head in June 1934 when President von Hindenburg informed Hitler that if a move to curb the SA was not forthcoming, then he would dissolve Hitler's Government and declare martial law.|$|E

However, <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>SA</b> Nationals won any federal seats in 2013, they would have {{been part of}} the Coalition.|$|R
50|$|As <b>the</b> Sturmabteilung (<b>SA)</b> expanded, {{it became}} an armed band of several hundred {{thousand}} men, whose function was to guard Nazi rallies and disrupt those of other political parties. Some of its leaders, particularly Ernst Röhm, visualized <b>the</b> <b>SA</b> as supplanting <b>the</b> regular army when Hitler came to power. To this end, a department was set up under Epp called the Wehrpolitisches Amt (Army political office). Nothing came of this, as a distrustful Adolf Hitler <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>SA</b> crushed {{and many of its}} leaders killed in the Night of the Long Knives.|$|R

50|$|A {{more serious}} trial of {{strength}} concerned {{the military and}} the SA. By 1934, the generals were fearful of Ernst Röhm's desire to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>SA,</b> a force of over 3 million men, absorb the much smaller German Army into its ranks under his leadership. Further, reports of a huge cache of weapons in the hands of SA members gave the army commanders great concern. Matters came to a head in June 1934 when President von Hindenburg, who had the complete loyalty of the Reichswehr, informed Hitler that if he did not move to curb the SA then Hindenburg would dissolve the Government and declare martial law. The Reichswehr leadership also pressured Hitler to act against the SA by threatening to block his plans for merging the offices of the Chancellorship and the Presidency after the soon to be expected death of the gravely ill Hindenburg. The result was the Night of the Long Knives which began on June 30, 1934, and led to the execution {{of the majority of the}} SA leadership, much to the barely veiled glee of the military.|$|E
40|$|Spaced {{seeds are}} {{important}} tools for similarity search in bioinformatics, and using several seeds together often significantly improves their performance. With existing approaches, however, for each seed we keep a separate linear-size data structure, either a hash table or a spaced suffix array (SSA). In this paper we show how to compress SSAs relative to normal suffix arrays (SAs) and still support fast random access to them. We first prove a theoretical {{upper bound on}} the space needed to store an SSA when we already <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>SA.</b> We then present experiments indicating that our approach works even better in practice...|$|E
40|$|In the plane, the post-office problem, which {{asks for}} the closest site to a query site, and {{retraction}} motion planning, which {{asks for a}} one-dimensional retract of the free space of a robot, are both classically solved by computing a Voronoi diagram. When the sites are k disjoint convex sets, we give a compact representation of the Voronoi diagram, using O(k) line segments, that is sufficient for logarithmic time post-office location queries and motion planning. If these sets are polygons with n total vertices given in standard representations, we compute this diagram optimally in O(k log n) deterministic time for the Euclidean metric and in O(k log n log m) deterministic time for the convex distance function defined by a convex m-gon. 1 Introduction One of the earliest successes of computational geometry is the O(n log n) time computation of the Voronoi diagram of n point sites in the plane, which is the partition of the plane into maximally connected regions that <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>sa</b> [...] ...|$|E

40|$|This article {{analyzes}} {{the extent to}} which stakeholder pressure contributes to the CSRwashing phenomena {{and its impact on the}} organizational outcomes. To that end, this work {{analyzes the}} relationships involved using primary data obtained from a survey of 130 Italian organizations that <b>have</b> implemented <b>the</b> <b>SA</b> 8000 international CSR standard. The article contributes to both the theoretical and empirical literature on CSR-washing by proposing an integrated approach that sheds more light on the driving factors behind and outcomes from the internationalization of a well-defined and comprehensively monitored set of CSR practices, namely <b>the</b> <b>SA</b> 8000 standard. <b>The</b> implications for managers, policy makers and other stakeholders are discussed...|$|R
5000|$|Under {{pressure}} from the Reichswehr (German armed forces) leadership, whose members viewed the enormous armed forces of <b>the</b> <b>SA</b> as an existential threat and with the collusion of Göring, Joseph Goebbels, the Gestapo and SD, Hitler was {{led to believe that}} Roehm’s SA posed a serious conspiratorial threat requiring a drastic and immediate solution. For its part, the SD provided fictitious information that there was an assassination plot on Hitler’s life and that an SA putsch to assume power was imminent since they were allegedly amassing weapons. Additionally, reports were coming in to the SD and Gestapo that the vulgarity of <b>the</b> <b>SA's</b> behavior was damaging the party and was even making antisemitism less palatable. In {{what became known as the}} Night of the Long Knives, the SS took one of its most decisive steps in eliminating its competition for command of security within the Third Reich and established itself firmly in the Nazi hierarchy, making the SS and its intelligence organ, the SD, responsible only to the Führer. Moreover, the brutal crushing of <b>the</b> <b>SA</b> and its leadership sent a clear message to everyone that opposition to Hitler’s regime could be deadly. In many ways, it struck fear across the Nazi leadership and a tangible concern about the reach and influence of Himmler’s intelligence collection and policing powers, since not only <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>SA’s</b> chief been murdered, but numerous party functionaries and [...] "opponents" [...] had been eliminated in the action based on an extensive list which Hitler only saw after the event.|$|R
5000|$|Ernst Röhm, {{a co-founder}} of <b>the</b> Sturmabteilung (<b>SA)</b> and later its commander, <b>had</b> {{developed}} within <b>the</b> <b>SA</b> ranks an “expanding Röhm-cult, [...] where many in <b>the</b> <b>SA</b> sought a revolutionary socialist regime, radicalizing <b>the</b> <b>SA.</b> Röhm and {{large segments of the}} National Socialist party supported the 25-point National Socialist Program for its socialist, revolutionary, and anti-capitalist positions, expecting Hitler to fulfill his promises when power was finally achieved. Since Röhm had “considerable sympathy with the more socialist aspects of the Nazi programme,” “turncoat Communists and Socialists joined the Nazi Party for a number of years, where they were derisively known as ‘Beefsteak Nazis’” ...|$|R

50|$|Brüning banned <b>the</b> <b>SA</b> and <b>the</b> SS on 13 April 1932 on {{the grounds}} they were ones chiefly {{responsible}} for the wave of political violence afflicting Germany. Additionally, rumors <b>had</b> started that <b>the</b> <b>SA</b> men serving in the Grenzschutz forces were helping themselves to the weapons stored in the secret Grenzschutz arms depots, and had transferred them to their own arms depots. The SPD Prussian minister-president Otto Braun ordered a series of police raids on <b>the</b> <b>SA,</b> which confirmed that the rumors were true. For Brüning this was the final straw, and despite all of Schleicher's vehement protests and his argument {{that there was nothing}} wrong with <b>the</b> <b>SA</b> stealing Grenzschutz weapons under the grounds that they meant only to be used against <b>the</b> Communists, <b>the</b> <b>SA</b> was banned as a threat to public order. The banning of <b>the</b> <b>SA</b> and SS saw an immediate and huge drop in the amount of political violence in Germany.|$|R
