The first {{institution}} of higher education in the Bay Area, Santa Clara University, was founded by Jesuits in 1851, whom also founded the University of San Francisco in 1855. San Jose State University was founded in 1857 and is the oldest public college on the West Coast of the United States. According to the Brookings Institution, 45% of residents of the two-county San Jose metro area <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>college</b> degree and 43% of residents in the five-county San Francisco metro area <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>college</b> degree, the second and fourth highest ranked metro areas in the country for higher educational attainment.|$|E
5|$|The age for officer {{candidates}} {{was between}} 20 and 50; {{they had to}} <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>college</b> degree, or {{two years of college}} and two years of professional or business experience. The enlisted age requirements were between 20 and 36; candidates had to have completed at least two years of high school. For the most part, SPARS were white, but five African-Americans did eventually serve. The agreement between the U.S. Navy and the USCG required that officer candidates receive their indoctrination training at Smith College, Northampton, Massachusetts. But in June 1943, the USCG withdrew from the agreement, and the indoctrination of SPAR officer candidates was transferred to the USCG Academy at New London, Connecticut. Most SPAR officers were general duty officers, but some officers received specialized training.|$|E

25|$|Professionals, {{those who}} <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>college</b> education, and those whose work {{revolves}} around the conceptualization of ideas have supported the Democratic Party by a slight majority since 2000. Between 1988 and 2000, professionals favored Democrats by a 12-percentage point margin. While the professional class was once a stronghold of the Republican Party, {{it has become increasingly}} split between the two parties, leaning in favor of the Democratic Party. The increasing support for Democratic candidates among professionals may be traced to the prevalence of social liberal values among this group.|$|E

25|$|By November 1985 {{the first}} {{category}} - the larger cities and approximately 20 percent of the counties (mainly in the more developed coastal and southeastern areas of China) had achieved universal 9-year education. By 1990 cities, economically developed areas in coastal provincial-level units, and {{a small number of}} developed interior areas (approximately 25 percent of China's population) and areas where junior middle schools were already popularized were targeted to have universal junior-middle-school education. Education planners had envisioned that by the mid-1990s all workers and staff in coastal areas, inland cities, and moderately developed areas (with a combined population of 300 million to 400 million people) would have either compulsory 9-year or vocational education and that 5 {{percent of the people in}} these areas would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>college</b> education - building a solid intellectual foundation for China. Further, the planners expected that secondary education and university entrants would also have increased by the year 2000.|$|E

500|$|St. John Vianney College Seminary and St. Vincent de Paul Regional Seminary serve priestly {{formation}} needs. Candidates to the Catholic priesthood must <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>college</b> degree {{plus another}} {{four to five}} years of seminary formation. This formation includes not only academic classes but also human, spiritual and pastoral education. St. John Vianney Seminary, which is located in Miami, states as its fundamental purpose [...] "to provide an undergraduate education for students whose stated objective is to serve the Catholic Church as priests", but it also offers education to lay ministers and to [...] "others who may be enriched by its services". St. Vincent de Paul Regional Seminary, located in Boynton Beach, offers a master's degree in Theology and Theological Studies and a First Professional Degree in Divinity and Ministry. Priests serving in the Archdiocese of Miami are required to speak both Spanish and English, and these two seminaries are the only bilingual seminaries in the United States. As of August 2007, there are 126 seminarians in priestly formation at both seminaries.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effect of <b>having</b> <b>a</b> spouse in {{a more or less}} mobile {{occupation}} on an individual’s migration and earnings outcomes, and how these effects differ between men and women. Cross-state migration measures are calculated by occupation and education from the 2000 Census. The effects of these occupational mobility measures are analyzed separately for four groups of couples: both have college degrees (“power couples”), only the husband <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>college</b> degree, only the wife <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>college</b> degree, and neither <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>college</b> degree. Results indicate that the mobility rates in both the husband’s and wife’s occupations affect the household migration decision, but mobility in the husband’s occupation matters considerably more. Among never-married individuals with college degrees, however, men and women are equally responsive to occupation mobility in their migration behavior. The earnings analysis uses occupation fixed-effects and average wage in occupation-education class to control for substantial heterogeneity in earnings potential. For couples in which the husband <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>college</b> degree, regardless of wife’s education, wife’s mobility <b>has</b> <b>a</b> positive effect on husband’s earnings, but husband’s mobility <b>has</b> <b>an</b> even larger, significant negative effect on wife’s earnings. Among couples in which only the wife <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>college</b> degree, these effects are considerably dampened. I...|$|R

2500|$|Brownsville has {{significantly}} higher dropout rates in its schools. Brownsville also {{has one of}} the highest concentrations of [...] "persistently violent" [...] schools of any area in New York State, with five such schools in Brownsville and East New York on the 2015–2016 list of most dangerous schools. Students must pass through metal detectors and swipe ID cards to enter the buildings. This arose from two school shootings in East New York in 1991–1992 that, combined, resulted in the deaths of three students and the injury of one teacher. Other problems in local schools include low test scores, with 95% of students scoring below grade level on state tests. Brownsville generally has lower ratios of college-educated residents than the rest of the city. Only 18% of the population <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>college</b> education or higher, but 28% have less than a high school education and 53% are high school graduates with some college education. By contrast, 38% of Brooklynites and 41% of city residents <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>college</b> education or higher. However, despite these drawbacks, the percentage of Brownsville students excelling in reading and math has been increasing, with reading achievement rising from 26 percent in 2000 to 31 percent in 2001, and math achievement rising from 20 percent to 38 percent within the same time period.|$|E
