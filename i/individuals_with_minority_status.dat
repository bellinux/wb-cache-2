40|$|My thesis {{comprises}} {{of three}} papers in behavioural development economics. In {{all three of}} my papers I use economic theories and artefactual field experiments to understand individuals’ preferences for trust, altruism and honesty when they interact with others in their societies. The first paper analyses the effect of multiple identities on interpersonal trust. We conduct a field experiment in West Bengal, India and Bangladesh, two regions significantly different in religious composition, but similar on most socio-economic characteristics, ethnicity and language. In West Bengal, Hindus (Muslims) form the majority (minority), while in Bangladesh Hindus (Muslims) form the minority (majority). Using this variation, we analyse whether identity based on religion or the relative status it generates within the population drives trust behaviour. Our results {{suggest that it is}} identity based on status and not religion that drives behaviour. We find that in both locations <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> <b>minority</b> <b>status,</b> irrespective of religion, exhibit positive in-group bias in trust, while individuals with majority status, again irrespective of religion, show positive out-group bias in trustworthiness. In addition, we report differences in the behaviour of religious and non-religious individuals which can explain our main results. In the second paper, we experimentally study the effect of framing and size of windfall gains on the redistribution of such gains. We invite randomly selected individuals from villages in Bangladesh to take part in dictator experiments where they received endowments worth up to several months of salary and asked to redistribute this endowment between themselves and other individuals. We manipulated whether dictators could give to or take from another individual (i. e. whether the endowment was allocated to the dictator or other individual) and whether the endowment was moderate or very large. We find that dictators allocate almost nine times more to other individuals under the take than give frame when stakes are very large, even after they could reconsider their choices. In addition, we find that proportions allocated to other individuals dramatically drop when stakes increase under the give but not the take frame. The results provide novel evidence on the role of framing and stakes for pro-sociality. In the third paper we experimentally study honesty over large stakes using randomly selected individuals from a set of villages in Bangladesh. Participants took part in a Sender-Receiver cheap talk experiment where the potential costs of honesty varied from a few hours to a few months average income. We find that majority of the Senders are honest. However, Receivers only follow Sender messages in fifty percent cases suggesting honest behaviour does not translate to perceptions of it. We find that stakes affect honesty significantly. Honesty decreases by a third over larger stakes. We also report that women are more honest than men.

40|$|Undocumented and {{authorized}} immigrant laborers, female workers, {{workers of}} color, guest workers, and unionized workers together compose an enormous and diverse {{part of the}} labor force in America. Labor and employment laws are supposed to protect employees from various workplace threats, such as poor wages, bad working conditions, and unfair dismissal. Yet as members of <b>individual</b> groups <b>with</b> <b>minority</b> <b>status,</b> the rights of many of these individuals are often dictated by other types of law, such as constitutional and immigration laws. Worse still, the groups who fall into these cracks in the legal system often do not have the political power necessary to change the laws for better protection. In Marginal Workers, Ruben J. Garcia demonstrates {{that when it comes to}} these marginal workers, the sum of the law is less than its parts, and, despite what appears to be a plethora of applicable statutes, marginal workers are frequently lacking in protection. To ameliorate the status of marginal workers, he argues for a new paradigm in worker protection, one based on human freedom and rights, and points to a number of examples in which marginal workers have organized for greater justice on the job in spite of the weakness of the law.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{relationships between}} institutional mistrust (systematic discrimination, organizational suspicion, and conspiracy beliefs), HIV risk behaviors, and HIV testing in a multiethnic sample {{of men who}} have sex with men (MSM), and to test whether perceived susceptibility to HIV mediates these relationships for White and ethnic minority MSM. METHOD: Participants were 394 MSM residing in Central Arizona (M age = 37 years). Three dimensions of mistrust were examined, including organizational suspicion, conspiracy beliefs, and systematic discrimination. Assessments of sexual risk behavior, HIV testing, and perceived susceptibility to HIV were made at study entry (T 1) and again 6 months later (T 2). RESULTS: There were no main effects of institutional mistrust dimensions or ethnic <b>minority</b> <b>status</b> on T 2 risk behavior, but the interaction of systematic discrimination and conspiracy beliefs <b>with</b> <b>minority</b> <b>status</b> was significant such that higher levels of systematic discrimination and more conspiracy beliefs were associated with increased risk only among ethnic minority MSM. Higher levels of systematic discrimination were significantly related to lower likelihood for HIV testing, and the interaction of organizational suspicion <b>with</b> <b>minority</b> <b>status</b> was significant such that greater levels of organizational suspicion were related to less likelihood of having been tested for HIV among ethnic minority MSM. Perceived susceptibility did not mediate these relationships. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that it is important to look further into the differential effects of institutional mistrust across marginalized groups, including sexual and ethnic minorities. Aspects of mistrust should be addressed in HIV prevention and counseling efforts...|$|R

40|$|Toward {{identifying}} {{variables that}} may protect children against sleep problems otherwise associated <b>with</b> ethnic <b>minority</b> <b>status</b> and economic adversity, support coping was examined as a moderator. Participants were 235 children (113 boys, 122 girls; M age 11. 33 years, SD 8. 03 months), 64 % European American and 36 % African American. Children’s sleep duration (minutes) and continuity (efficiency) were assessed through actigraphs worn for 1 week. Mothers {{reported on the}} family’s monetary resources (income-to-needs ratio) and children reported on their support coping strategies. For children from lower income homes and African Americans, {{a higher level of}} support coping was a protective factor against fewer sleep minutes and reduced sleep efficiency, otherwise associated with economic adversity. Children from more economically advantaged homes had good sleep parameters regardless of their coping. The results build on the existing small body of work by demonstrating that children’s support coping strategies have a protective role against sleep problems otherwise associated <b>with</b> ethnic <b>minority</b> <b>status</b> and economic adversity and present potential targets for intervention that may help reduce health disparities in an important health domain...|$|R

40|$|IntroductionNon–small-cell {{lung cancer}} (NSCLC) {{is the leading}} cause of cancer-related {{morbidity}} and mortality. Unfortunately, patients with NSCLC have relatively poor survival rates compared with patients diagnosed with most other types of cancer. Accordingly, managing physical and mental health symptoms are important treatment goals. In the current investigation, we sought to determine whether individual socioeconomic status (SES; as indexed by level of education), racial/ethnic <b>minority</b> <b>status,</b> and hospital type (public versus tertiary care center) were associated with NSCLC cancer patients’ depressive severity. Importantly, we investigated whether NSCLC patients’ individual SES was more or less prognostic of their depressive severity compared <b>with</b> <b>minority</b> <b>status</b> and the hospital context where they received treatment. MethodsPatients scheduled for chemotherapy were assessed for depressed mood by the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). Data were collected at baseline and at approximately 6, 12, and 18 weeks. ResultsNSCLC patients with less education had more depressive severity than those with more education. Treatment setting and <b>minority</b> <b>status</b> were not associated with depressive severity. The interaction between education level and treatment setting predicting depressive severity was not significant, suggesting that the association between education level and depressive severity did not differ by treatment setting. ConclusionOur study brings heightened awareness to the substantial, persistent SES differences that exist in depressive severity among late-stage NSCLC patients. Furthermore, these findings seem to persist, regardless of <b>minority</b> <b>status</b> and whether the patient is treated at a public hospital or tertiary cancer center...|$|R

Ten interviews were conducted in the Tacoma, WA area to identify common weight-loss barriers, and health literacy and agency emerged as factors that impact health outcomes. Health literacy interacted with both the healthcare system and the weight-loss industry, as interviewees indicated a lack of distinction between the two. Some interviewees indicated that bias and stigma overrode health literacy, an act referred to as bias-associated suppression of health literacy (BASH). Agency impacted the patient-provider relationship and access to community resources, and can be considered an aspect of structural competence.

One hundred and seventy-seven women (n = 177) were recruited via the Internet to complete an online study asking them about their most distressing/severe sexual victimization experience. Non-parametric tests were used to examine associations among the variables. There were significant associations between sexual <b>minority</b> <b>status</b> and both victimization severity and sexual revictimization, <b>with</b> sexual <b>minority</b> <b>status</b> being associated <b>with</b> higher levels of victimization severity and a higher likelihood of being revictimized.

40|$|Tomsen’s book Violence, Prejudice and Sexuality {{engages with}} {{important}} questions about sexuality and anti homosexual sentiment that criminologists have grappled with for some time. Tomsen’s work refines these {{questions in the}} context of essentialism, and notes how this concept has enabled only very specific ways of thinking about and analysing violence, prejudice, and sexuality. Indeed, thinking about the nexus between these three concepts are now almost taken for granted. As Tomsen demonstrates in his discussion of historical understandings of sexual desire, although social constructionism and queer perspectives have challenged essentialist notions of sexuality, research has in many respects upheld a binary understanding of heterosexuality as normal and homosexuality as abnormal. Interestingly, essentialist binaries like this have been conveniently employed in more recent times when activists align <b>with</b> <b>minority</b> <b>status</b> to gain basic human rights. While no one could deny the importance of access to rights and justice, Tomsen notes the danger inherent in arguments like this that draw on essentialism. He argues we are working through similar dichotomies of heterosexuality as normal and homosexuality as abnormal set up in very early research on sexual desire. The key difference now is that, in the rush towards public and political citizenship, ‘heterosexuals are recast as “perpetrators” and homosexuals as “victims”’ (Tomsen 2009 : 16). Violence, Prejudice and Sexuality importantly notes this is no less an essentialist dichotomy and no less divisive [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|Each {{time that}} the {{continued}} legality of race-conscious affirmative action is threatened, colleges and universities must confront the possibility of dramatically changing their admissions policies. Fisher v. University of Texas, which the Supreme Court will hear this year, presents just such a moment. In previous years when affirmative action has been outlawed by ballot initiative in specific states or when the Court has seemed poised to reject it entirely, there have been calls for replacing race-conscious admissions with class-based affirmative action. Supporters of race-conscious affirmative action have typically criticized the class-based alternative as ineffective at maintaining racial diversity. This article {{presents the results of}} a study conducted at the University of Colorado in 2008 and 2010 that challenges that common assertion. We present a class-based affirmative action policy that led to increased socioeconomic diversity as well as slightly increased racial diversity in two entering freshmen classes. This study, the first done at a moderately selective university, shows how class-based affirmative action can be an effective tool for admitting a class of students that is diverse both socioeconomically and racially. Even if the Supreme Court upholds the constitutionality of race-conscious college admissions, class-based policies are attractive as a supplement to race-conscious policies. The challenges associated with low socioeconomic status are different from those associated <b>with</b> <b>minority</b> <b>status,</b> and there are good reasons to seek equal opportunity along both lines...|$|R

40|$|A {{complex of}} interrelated factors {{including}} <b>minority</b> <b>status,</b> poverty, education, health status, {{and other factors}} determine the general welfare of children in America, particularly in heavily diverse states such as Texas. Although racial/ethnic status is clearly only a concomitant factor in that determination it is a factor for which future projections are available and for which the relationships with the other factors in the complex can be assessed. After examining {{the nature of the}} interrelationships between these factors we utilize direct standardization techniques to examine how the future diversification of the United States and Texas will affect the number of children in poverty, the educational status of the householders in households in which children in poverty live and the health status of children in 2040 assuming that the current relationships between <b>minority</b> <b>status</b> and these socioeconomic factors continue into the future. In the results of the analyses, data are compared with the total population of the United States and Texas in 2040 assumed in the first simulation scenario, to have the race/ethnicity characteristics of 2008 and in the second those projected for 2040 by the U. S. Census Bureau for the nation and by the Texas State Data Center for Texas in 2040. The results show that the diversification of the population could increase the number of children in poverty in the United States by nearly 1. 8 million more than would occur with the lower levels of diversification evident in 2008. In addition, poverty would become increasingly concentrated among <b>minority</b> children <b>with</b> <b>minority</b> children accounting for 76. 2 percent of all children in poverty by 2040 and with Hispanic children accounting for nearly half of the children in poverty by 2040. Results for educational attainment show an increasing concentration of minority children in households with householders with very low levels of education such that by 2040, 85. 2 percent of {{the increase in the number}} of children in poverty would be in households with a householder with less than a high school level of education. Finally, the results related to several health status factors show that children in poverty will have a higher prevalence of nearly all health conditions. For example, the number of children with untreated dental conditions could increase to more than 4 million in the United States and to nearly 500, 000 in Texas. 	 The results clearly show that improving the welfare of children in America will require concerted efforts to change the poverty, educational, and health <b>status</b> characteristics associated <b>with</b> <b>minority</b> <b>status</b> and particularly Hispanic status.

After all, social mobility often requires high levels of adaptation to the society of residence. How then, and why, is this combined with ethnic identification? And why do higher educated <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> <b>minority</b> backgrounds ‘still’ appreciate the bonds with co-ethnics? This book explores ethnic identification among social climbers <b>with</b> ethnic <b>minority</b> backgrounds. In particular, it focuses on the ethnic identifications of university educated adult children of Moroccan and Turkish immigrants. How strongly do they identify with the ethnic labels ‘Moroccan’ and ‘Turkish’? Does this reduce their identification as Dutch, as some people fear? In what situations do they articulate their ethnic identity, and why? How does their identification develop over time? And, in what ways is their ethnic background relevant for them? Based on a mixed methods approach, this study provides answers to these questions. Results from a structured survey and in-depth interviews reveal that feeling ‘Moroccan’, ‘Turkish’ can be strong among minority climbers but does not necessarily threaten their identification as ‘Dutch’. These results show that identification with these labels has different meanings for different people, and they show how these identifications and meanings depend on time and social context. Specifically, a trajectory of ‘reinvention of ethnic identification’ is identified, in which co-ethnic, higher educated soulmates appear to play crucial roles. This helps us understand why social climbers enter the middle-classes who do not discard their ethnic distinctiveness...|$|R
