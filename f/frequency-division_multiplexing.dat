40|$|Abstract — In {{orthogonal}} <b>frequency-division</b> <b>multiplex</b> access (OFDMA) uplink, it {{is admitted}} that the carrier-frequency offsets (CFOs) between multi-transmitter and receiver introduce inter-carrier interference (ICI) and cause severe performance loss. In this paper, with reference to {{a detailed analysis of}} the ICI caused by CFOs, we propose a novel low-complexity iterative ICI cancellation algorithm, which is based on the perfect estimation of each user’s CFO. Moreover, the convergence behaviors of the iter-ations are studied with three theorems, and the user-interleaving patterns suitable for this algorithm are presented. In accordance with the simulation results, we {{come to the conclusion that}} the low-complexity iterative algorithm can effectively suppress and cancel the ICI due to CFOs.

40|$|Abstract—Channels with {{spectral}} nulls {{are sometimes}} dubbed bad channels {{because they can}} cause poor performance in communication systems. This correspondence investigates the validity of this intuition by studying the geometry of an orthogonal <b>frequency-division</b> <b>multiplex</b> (OFDM) system. It is shown that the subchannel attenuation coefficients form a natural coordinate system for describing finite-impulse response (FIR) channels in an OFDM framework. It is also shown that channels with spectral nulls are geometrically significant; they form {{the faces of the}} convex set of all subchannel attenuation coefficients. This novel perspective makes it immediately clear why the worst performance of a linearly precoded OFDM system is achieved over a channel having the greatest number of spectral nulls. The practical implications of these results are discussed in the correspondence.
