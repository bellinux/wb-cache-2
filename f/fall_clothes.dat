Downhill riders tend to wear heavier fabric baggy shorts or moto-cross style trousers in order to protect themselves from falls. All mountain/enduro riders tend to wear light fabric baggy shorts and jerseys as they can be in the saddle for long periods of time.|$|R

5|$|Britomart Redeems Faire Amoret was {{intended}} by Etty {{to illustrate the}} virtues of chastity and honour. It shows the moment in which Busirane is interrupted by Britomart {{as he prepares to}} kill Amoret. Amoret is chained to a gilded Solomonic column, carved with depictions of Venus, and her <b>clothes</b> <b>fall</b> from her shoulders as she struggles. Britomart, clad in armour, enters Busirane's Moorish chamber, and tramples a blood-stained grimoire as she draws her sword. Busirane, naked from the waist up and with Chinese-style trousers and queue, falls to the floor, his blade still pointing at Amoret's heart. Unusually for Etty, Britomart is painted very thinly, with the canvas weave still visible through the paint. Art historian Alison Smith considers that this was likely inspired by Henry Fuseli, who painted a depiction of Britomart using the same style of painting.|$|R
50|$|The {{game is a}} dungeon crawl {{game where}} the player is {{required}} to navigate through maps containing enemies.

The player decides on which monster girls are placed within the party, and are able to swap their underwear, which serves as the main customizable equipment of the game. Changing underwear affects the abilities each girl has, in addition to their skill points. Strange Monsters can also be obtained and combined with Raw Material Panties to create new items, depending on the combination of raw materials used.|$|R

6000|$|I {{have already}} told the reader, that every night, {{when the family}} were gone to bed, it was my custom to strip, and cover myself with my clothes.

When he came I was fast asleep, my <b>clothes</b> <b>fallen</b> off on one side, and my shirt above my waist. I awaked at the noise he made, and {{observed}} him to deliver his message in some disorder; after which he went to my master, and in a great fright gave him a very confused account {{of what he had}} seen. This I presently discovered, for, going as soon as I was dressed to pay my attendance upon his honour, he asked me âthe meaning of what his servant had reported, that I was not the same thing when I slept, as I appeared to be at other times; that his vale assured him, some part of me was white, some yellow, at least not so white, and some brown.â ...|$|R

I had all my first pains; my throat was so sore I could scarce swallow; I had a fit of strong shuddering, which clucked my teeth together; and there came on me that dreadful sense of illness which we have no name for either in Scots or English. I thought I should have died, and made my peace with God, forgiving all men, even my uncle and the fishers; {{and as soon as}} I had thus made up my mind to the worst, clearness came upon me: I observed the night was <b>falling</b> dry; my <b>clothes</b> were dried a good deal; truly, I was in a better case than ever before, since I had landed on the isle; and so I got to sleep at last, with a thought of gratitude.|$|R
50|$|Amaterasu, the sun goddess {{had hidden}} {{herself in a}} cave because she was hurt by her brother Susano-o's {{unacceptable}} behaviour. Near the cave entrance, the goddess Ame-no-uzume, turned a tub over and started to dance on {{it in front of}} the worried assembly of gods. As Ame-no-uzume was half naked already, with <b>clothes</b> <b>falling</b> off, the gods started laughing loudly. When Amaterasu heard the commotion, she came out to see what was happening. Thus the world had sunlight again. The imperial family of Japan is said to have descended from Amaterasu and Ame-no-uzume is considered the patron goddess of music and dance. This story comes from Japanese Shinto mythology. It could be said to be the start of dance as entertainment for the gods. As Japanese emperors where descended from Amaterasu, royalty and divinity often are closely associated. When Buddhist culture came over to Japan from Korea and China in the seventh century, it brought dance-drama traditions that involved intricate costumes and processions. Bugaku court dance draws heavily from the Buddhist imported culture, but also incorporates many traditional Shinto aspects. These influences eventually mixed together and over the years were refined into something uniquely Japanese, bugaku.|$|R
5000|$|The {{story is}} often told of Napoleon's men {{freezing}} in the bitter Russian Winter, their <b>clothes</b> <b>falling</b> apart as tin pest ate the buttons. This clearly {{appears to be}} an urban legend, and {{there is no evidence that}} there existed any failing buttons at all, and thus they cannot have been a contributing factor in the failure of the invasion. [...] Critics of the theory point out that the tin used would have been quite impure and thus more tolerant of low temperatures. Laboratory tests provide evidence that the time required for unalloyed tin to develop significant tin pest damage at lowered temperatures is about 18 months, which is more than twice the length of the invasion. It is clear though that some of the regiments employed in the campaign had tin buttons and that the temperature reached sufficiently low values (at least -40 Â°C). [...] However, none of the many survivors' tales mention problems with buttons and it has been suggested that the legend is an amalgamation of a case of disintegrating Russian tin buttons in an army warehouse in the 1860s [...] and the utterly desperate state of Napoleon's army turning soldiers into ragged beggars.|$|R
