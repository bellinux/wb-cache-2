5000|$|A laryngectomized {{person is}} {{required}} to breathe through a permanent breathing hole in the neck, called a tracheostoma. When a laryngectomized person occludes the tracheostoma, completely blocking exhaled air to leave the body through that pathway, exhaled air is directed through the voice prosthesis. This air enters the esophagus and escapes through the mouth. During this process, as the air passes through the upper tissues of the esophagus and lower throat, it allows for vibration of the tissues of the pharyngoesophageal segment (also called PE-segment, neoglottis or pseudoglottis). This vibration creates a sound that serves to replace the sound the vocal cords previously produced. Other methods of alaryngeal speech (speech without vocal cords) are esophageal speech, and artificial larynx speech. Studies show that tracheoesophageal speech {{is found to be}} closer to normal speech than esophageal speech and is often reported to be better, both in terms of naturalness as well as how well it is understood, when compared to esophageal speech [...] and <b>electrolarynx</b> speech.The first report on a tracheoesophageal puncture dates back to 1932 when a laryngectomized patient was said to use a hot ice pick to create a tracheoesophageal puncture in himself.

A solution to this problem is a mechanical device, which substitutes the missing body part- the so-called <b>electrolarynx.</b> Unfortunately, speaking with an <b>electrolarynx</b> suffers from high background noise caused by the sound of the device itself as well as low intelli-gibility because of the monotonic frequency the <b>electrolarynx</b> device produces.

Study Design. Prospective study. Setting. This study was conducted at a tertiary care facility. Subjects and Methods. Forty laryngectomized adults (25 men, 15 women) who used the <b>electrolarynx</b> as a primary method of communication served as participants. The Voice-Related Quality of Life measure was administered and scored in standard fashion and descriptive data generated for physical, social-emotional, and total scores. Results. Data indicate substantial variability in self-perceived quality of life specific to voice use; a wide range of physical, social-emotional, and total scores were observed. Only one-quarter of these participants rated themselves as having ‘‘poor/fair’ ’ voice-related quality of life. Conclusion. Our findings suggest that use of the <b>electrolarynx</b> as a postlaryngectomy method of verbal communication has a wide-ranging influence on self-perceived voice-related quality of life and that mean scores from prior studies may not accurately reflect the potential value of the electrolar-ynx.

When the larynx is removed during a total laryngectomy (TL), loss of voice can lead to a devastating decrease in a patient’s quality of life, and precipitate significant frustration over their inability to communicate with others effectively. Over the past 50 years there have been many advances in techniques of voice restoration after TL. Currently, there are three main methods of voice restoration: the <b>electrolarynx,</b> esophageal speech, and tracheoesophageal speech through a tracheoesophageal puncture (TEP) with voice prosthesis. Although TEP voice is the current gold standard for vocal rehabilitation, a significant minority of patients cannot use or obtain TEP speech for various reasons. As such, the <b>electrolarynx</b> is a viable and useful alternative for these patients. This article will focus on voice restoration using an <b>electrolarynx</b> with the following objectives: 1) To provide an understanding of the importance of voice restoration after total laryngectomy. 2) To discuss how the <b>electrolarynx</b> may be used to restore voice following total laryngectomy. 3) To outline some of the current <b>electrolarynx</b> devices available, including their mechanism of action and limitations. 4) To compare pros and cons of electrolaryngeal speech to TEP and esophageal speech.

In most electrolarynxes, mechanical vibrations are produced by a linear electromechanical actuator, the armature of which percusses against a metal or plastic plate at a frequency within the range of glottal phonation. As part of the ongoing development of a hands-free alternative to the conventional <b>electrolarynx,</b> the authors have developed a novel actuator which is based on a lightweight pager motor similar to those used to produce vibration in many mobile phones.
