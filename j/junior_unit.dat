50|$|After the United States entered World War I in 1917, {{the federal}} {{government}} granted the Academy a <b>junior</b> <b>unit</b> of the Reserve Officer Training Corps. For a time all male students were require to have served in the corps of cadets, and all those in grades nine through twelve are formally enrolled in the army Junior ROTC program, {{but it is no}} longer required. Girls have also participated in military training on an optional basis since 1973 when two students, Mary Shepard and Karen Stubbs led the development of the first female platoon. By 1936 the Academy's physical plant had increased to twelve buildings on a fifty-six-acre site valued at $400,000. Students in grades one through twelve studied general academic courses as well as fine arts and business subjects. In 1968 more than 500 students in grades three through twelve attended the Academy; in 1986 the enrollment was 240 boys in grades six through twelve and 120 girls in grades nine through twelve. Also in January 1982, under the administration of Jack E. Byrom the Academy moved from its location at the current Texas State University campus, to a more spacious lot on Ranch Road 12. The Academy has had students from a number of other states and foreign nations. Most Academy students reside in dormitories on campus and attend mandatory chapel services on Wednesdays, and devotionals on Mondays. Chapel services are currently optional for both boarding and day students, taking place at First Baptist Church on Sunday.|$|E
40|$|The Student Advocate program {{attempts}} to both strengthen {{the voice of}} students and to increase the engagement with reflective practice by staff. The method has similarities to both Peer Assisted Learning and Peer Observation in that a senior student attends lectures in a <b>junior</b> <b>unit.</b> The role of the senior student, the Student Advocate, is to {{speak on behalf of}} the students in the lecture, to gather opinions from the students concerning their learning experience, and to take this information to the staff involved in the unit to provide timely feedback on their teaching practices. Having a student gather comments may allow more candid feedback to be obtained than might otherwise be the case. In addition, having a person other than the lecturer gather the feedback reduces the effort required by the lecturer and therefore makes the uptake of reflective practices as easy as possible. This project is being evaluated in a 100 -level Chemistry subject. The outcomes to date suggest that while this system has some benefits, the cost-to-benefit ratio is not sufficiently favourable to warrant a large-scale implementation of it. However, in conjuction with other schemes, such as Peer-Assisted Learning, the Student Advocate scheme may prove to be useful...|$|E
