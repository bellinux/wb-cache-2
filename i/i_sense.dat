He wrote, [...] "Why do <b>I</b> <b>sense,</b> together with the current expansion, a shrinking of vision, an expansion of surface rather than depth, a failure of imagination?....Why is not social psychology more exciting, more human in the most usual sense of that term? To sum up, is this discipline perhaps on the wrong track?" [...] (Asch, p. x) Asch was worried that social psychologists were not asking the deeper questions that would help change and improve the world.|$|E
2500|$|The {{assassination}} of Massoud {{is believed to}} have a connection to the September 11 attacks on U.S. soil, which killed nearly 3000 people, and which appeared to be the terrorist attack that Massoud had warned against in his speech to the European Parliament several months earlier. [...] John P. O'Neill was a counter-terrorism expert and the Assistant Director of the FBI until late 2001. He retired from the FBI and was offered the position of director of security at the World Trade Center (WTC). He took the job at the WTC two weeks before 9/11. On September 10, 2001, O'Neill told two of his friends, [...] "We're due. And we're due for something big.... Some things have happened in Afghanistan. [...] I don't like the way things are lining up in Afghanistan.... <b>I</b> <b>sense</b> a shift, and I think things are going to happen ... soon." [...] O'Neill died on September 11, 2001, when the South Tower collapsed.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{they have}} {{received}} some acclaim in places, DeLillo's post-Underworld novels have been often viewed by critics as [...] "disappointing and slight, especially when held up against his earlier, big-canvas epics", marking a shift [...] "...away from sweeping, era-defining novels such as [...] "White Noise," [...] "Libra" [...] and [...] "Underworld" [...] to a more [...] "spare and oblique" [...] style, characterized by [...] " [...] decreased length, the decommissioning of plot machinery and the steep deceleration of narrative time". DeLillo has commented on this shift to shorter novels, saying [...] ""If a longer novel announces itself, I’ll write it. A novel creates its own structure and develops its own terms. I tend to follow. And I never try to stretch what <b>I</b> <b>sense</b> is a compact book." [...] In a March 2010 interview, {{it was reported that}} DeLillo's deliberate stylistic shift had been informed by his having recently re-read several slim but seminal European novels, including Albert Camus's The Stranger, Peter Handke's The Goalie's Anxiety at the Penalty Kick, and Max Frisch's Man in the Holocene.|$|E

2500|$|Nimoy {{continued}} to develop Spock alongside individual directors. When work was underway on [...] "Amok Time", he discussed with Joseph Pevney how Vulcans would greet each other. Nimoy suggested {{the use of}} a hand signal from the Priestly Blessing as performed by Jewish Kohen. He had seen this as a child, although Nimoy's father had told him not to look as they performed the blessing. This became the basis for the Vulcan salute. Solow later said that Nimoy was the key contributor to the character's depiction, saying that the [...] "Mr Spock character was 20% created by Gene Roddenberry, 20% created by me and 60% created by Leonard Nimoy". Nimoy recalled, [...] "As a Jew from Catholic Boston, I understood {{what it was like to}} feel alienated, apart from the mainstream... there were a number of values in Star Trek that I felt very comfortable with as a Jew". The character influenced Nimoy as well; years after the show he wrote that [...] "To this day, <b>I</b> <b>sense</b> Vulcan speech patterns, Vulcan social attitudes and even Vulcan patterns of logic and emotional suppression in my behavior." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, {{when it was}} {{announced}} that both Ricky and Bianca were being reintroduced, executive producer Diederick Santer described them as [...] "a hugely popular and well-loved partnership on the show". Other media sources branded them two of [...] "the most popular characters on the soap" [...] and an [...] "iconic couple". However, Hazel Davis of The Guardian was critical about their reintroduction. She commented, [...] "It's a no-brainer on the show's part. Last year, ratings for EastEnders were at an all-time low. But, just for once, wouldn't it be nice if a soap opera actually introduced new characters with verve and staying power rather than digging up the oldies?". Conversely, Mark Wright from The Stage said that the decision to bring these much-loved characters back [...] "is very welcome". He comments, [...] "Previous returns have been all about the numbers and not about the story, which is the cardinal sin in this game. While there is, of course, the resultant publicity that comes with any new or returning soap character being announced, the storyline possibilities for Ricky and Bianca arriving back in the Square are good. Bianca is turning up with a brood of kids in tow, all belonging to different fathers (how many of them can we expect to see {{over the next couple of}} years?). Like it! Ricky arrives with a glamorous WAG [...] on his arm. [...] <b>I</b> <b>sense</b> friction along the way, especially when Ricky realises he never got over Bianca (how could he?). All very well thought through and positive. This sounds like a soap getting back in touch with its roots.".|$|E
2500|$|Xi Zheng, then an {{assistant}} {{official in the}} palace library, often visited Meng Guang to consult him. When Meng Guang asked him what the crown prince, Liu Xuan, had been learning and reading {{and what he was}} interested in, Xi Zheng replied, [...] "He treats the people around him respectfully. He is very diligent and hardworking. He has the style of a crown prince of ancient times. When he meets people, he shows sincerity, kindness and generosity in everything he says and does." [...] Meng Guang then said, [...] "This is what is expected of every other person. What I really want to know is his level of political wisdom and how good his political skills are." [...] Xi Zheng replied, [...] "The Crown Prince's approach towards life is to focus on winning people's hearts and favour. He won't do what he shouldn't do. He doesn't openly reveal his wisdom. Besides, political skills can only be used under certain circumstances; they cannot be cultivated and learnt in advance." [...] Meng Guang knew that Xi Zheng was trying to careful with his words, so he said, [...] "I like to speak my mind as freely as possible. Every time I openly make criticisms, people will ridicule or hate me for that. Although <b>I</b> <b>sense</b> that you don't like to hear what I say, my words make sense. The Empire is not unified yet. Political skills are crucial in this time and age. While one's mastery of political skills depends on his intellectual abilities, political skills can be learnt and mastered through diligence. This {{has to do with the}} Crown Prince's education. He should be striving to enrich himself with as much knowledge as possible so that he can be like a consultant. He should also sit for written and oral tests like academics and gain some titles. This is a top priority for him." [...] Xi Zheng strongly agreed with him.|$|E

In vain I strove to learn how Mr. Pike forecasts these antics, and I am driven to believe that he does not consciously forecast them at all. He feels them; he knows them.

Dearest, I don't want to worry you or frighten you, and I can't follow out my own gloomy fancies. Don't you mind too much what I think. Only you must realize that Wade is the greatest factor in our hopes of the future. My faith in him is so unshakable that it's foolish. Next to you I love him best. He seems even dearer to me than my own people. He has made me look at life differently. Likewise he has inspired you. But you, dearest Columbine, are only a sensitive, delicate girl, a frail and tender thing like the columbine flowers of the hills. And for your own sake you must not be blind to what Wade is capable of. If you keep on loving him and idealizing him, blind to what has made him great, that is, blind to the tragic side of him, then if he did something terrible here for you and for me the shock would be bad for you. Lord knows I have no suspicions of Wade. I have no clear ideas at all. But I do know that for you he would not stop at anything. He loves you as much as I do, only differently. Such power a pale, sweet-faced girl has over the lives of men! ...|$|E
