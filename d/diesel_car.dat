25|$|The Budd Rail <b>Diesel</b> <b>Car,</b> RDC or Buddliner is a {{self-propelled}} diesel {{multiple unit}} (DMU) railcar. Between 1949 and 1962, 398 RDCs were built by the Budd Company of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. The cars were primarily adopted for passenger service in rural areas with low traffic density or in short-haul commuter service, and were less expensive to operate in this context than a traditional diesel locomotive-drawn train with coaches. The cars could be used singly or several could be coupled together in train sets and controlled from the cab of the front unit. The RDC {{was one of the}} few DMU trains to achieve commercial success in North America. RDC trains were an early example of self-contained {{diesel multiple unit}} trains, an arrangement now in common use by railways all over the world.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{existing}} tax policies towards {{gasoline and}} <b>diesel</b> <b>cars</b> in European countries provide {{a unique opportunity}} to analyze quality-based price discrimination and the implied tax incidence. We develop an econometric framework for the demand and pricing of gasoline and <b>diesel</b> <b>cars.</b> Consumers choose the type of engine based on their annual mileage; prices are set by the manufacturers. Our empirical results show that the relative pricing of gasoline and <b>diesel</b> <b>cars</b> is consistent with price discrimination of a monopolistic type, e®ectively segmenting low mileage from high mileage consumers. On average, about 75 to 90 percent of the price di®erentials between gasoline and <b>diesel</b> <b>cars</b> can be explained by markup di®erences. The implied tax incidence is especially based on fuel taxes and less so on annual car taxes. Implications for the e®ectiveness and the revenue e®ects of tax policy are drawn...|$|R

25|$|Throughout the 1950s {{there was}} an {{increasing}} demand for a diesel-engined Land Rover. Diesel technology had improved, making small-capacity high-speed engines practical. Diesel power had also become prominent in industrial and agricultural uses throughout the world, and fleet users of Land Rovers were often in the situation where their Land Rovers were the only petrol-engined vehicles in their fleet, making spares, servicing and fuel supply more complex. The Rover Motor Company was in talks with Standard-Triumph in 1954, {{with the possibility of}} a merger. Standard were Britain's pioneers of road-going small diesel engines with the 20C engine fitted to Ferguson tractors and the Standard Vanguard car (Britain's first <b>diesel</b> <b>car).</b> Rover engineers were able to study Standard's diesel designs as part of these. The merger was called off, but Rover had gained vital experience and knowledge in developing small diesel engines. The result was a wet-liner 4-cylinder engine. Fuel injection equipment was from CAV, and the engine used Ricardo's Comet swirl chambers, but with Rover-developed dimples to produce quieter and smoother running. Heater plugs were fitted to each combustion chamber to improve starting. The engine was launched in the Land Rover in 1957. The vehicle had to have an extra 2inches let into the chassis in the engine bay to enable the new engine to fit. The engine's power output and speed range was close enough to the existing petrol engine to allow the same transmission unit to be used on all vehicles.|$|E

By the end of 1975, out-of-service rate was still 27.5%, and many trains ran with fewer cars than demand called for. In February 1976, Amtrak cut Metroliner service from 15 to 13 round trips {{because of the lack}} of serviceable cars. In August, Budd unveiled the SPV-2000, a Rail <b>Diesel</b> <b>Car</b> successor built with the Metroliner shell design. Although heavily marketed, the SPV-2000s were extremely unreliable and never achieved the widespread use of the Metroliners and Amfleets.|$|E

2500|$|Motorists {{occasionally}} pump gasoline into a <b>diesel</b> <b>car</b> by accident. [...] The converse {{is almost}} impossible because diesel pumps have a large nozzle with a diameter of [...] which does not fit the [...] filler, and the nozzles are protected by a lock mechanism or a liftable flap. Diesel fuel in a gasoline engine — while creating large amounts of smoke — does not normally cause permanent damage if it is drained once the mistake is realized. However even a liter of petrol added to the tank of a modern <b>diesel</b> <b>car</b> can cause irreversible damage to the injection pump and other components through a lack of lubrication. In some cases, the car has to be scrapped because the cost of repairs exceeds its residual value.

2500|$|Most <b>diesel</b> <b>car</b> {{engines are}} {{suitable}} {{for the use of}} straight vegetable oil (SVO), also commonly called pure plant oil (PPO), with certain modifications. Principally, the viscosity and surface tension of the SVO/PPO must be reduced by preheating it, typically by using waste heat from the engine or electricity, otherwise poor atomization, incomplete combustion and carbonization may result. One common solution is to add a heat exchanger and an additional fuel tank for the petrodiesel or biodiesel blend and to switch between this additional tank and the main tank of SVO/PPO. [...] The engine is started on diesel, switched over to vegetable oil as soon as it is warmed up and switched back to diesel shortly before being switched off to ensure that no vegetable oil remains in the engine or fuel lines when it is started from cold again. In colder climates it is often necessary to heat the vegetable oil fuel lines and tank as it can become very viscous and even solidify.|$|E
