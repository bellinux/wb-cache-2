25|$|He then faced Japanese star Hayato Sakurai, {{and would}} go on to lose in a <b>fast</b> <b>paced</b> see-saw affair that showcased both the {{toughness}} and heart of Pulver, and the experience and technicality of Sakurai.

25|$|When the Benson & Hedges Cup {{ended in}} 2002, the ECB needed another one day {{competition}} to fill its place. Cricketing authorities {{were looking to}} boost the game's popularity with the younger generation in response to dwindling crowds and reduced sponsorship. It was intended to deliver <b>fast</b> <b>paced,</b> exciting cricket accessible to thousands of fans who were {{put off by the}} longer versions of the game. Stuart Robertson, the marketing manager of the ECB, proposed a 20 over per innings game to county chairmen in 2001 and they voted 11–7 in favour of adopting the new format.|$|E
25|$|Prior to 1993, Rugby Sevens {{had already}} {{built up a}} {{substantial}} international presence. The relative ease with which the rules could be learnt and applied, combined {{with the ability to}} quickly organise teams due to fewer players, as well as providing a <b>fast</b> <b>paced</b> game for spectators enticed many nations to set up domestic tournaments, and appealed to a large international audience outside of the established power houses of the traditional 15-a-side game. Such was the international popularity of the game that the Scottish Rugby Union were able to organise a well attended International Tournament in 1973 to celebrate the centenary of the Scottish Rugby Union. England came away victorious from that first international event.|$|E
25|$|Lumb was {{selected}} in England's fifteen man squad for the 2010 ICC World Twenty20 {{held in the}} West Indies. He made his Twenty20 International debut against the West Indies, where opening the innings, he hit a quickfire 28 before being bowled by Chris Gayle. Lumb played in all of England's seven matches in the tournament, where he helped to form a <b>fast</b> <b>paced</b> opening partnership with Craig Kieswetter. Lumb scored 137 runs in the tournament at a batting average of 19.57 and a high score of 33. Lumb ended on a high note by collecting a winners medal, as England defeated Australia by seven wickets to win the tournament. During the match he ran out David Warner and scored two runs with the bat off four deliveries. He scored a match winning 50 against India on the second of two games and proved that he deserved {{a place in the}} England team.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} forms of {{competition}} using a fixed gear bike, most of the competitions being track races. Formal track races most often {{take place in a}} velodrome, a circular track that is constructed of concrete or wood and can be indoor or outdoor. Race types such as common scratch races or more complex omnium races take place in these arenas. Moreover, bike messengers and other urban riders may ride fixed gear bicycles in alleycat races, which are normally held in city streets, including New York City's famous fixed-gear-only race Monstertrack alleycat. Similarly, Wolfpack Hustle began in 2005 simply as ride bringing together <b>fast</b> <b>paced</b> bicycle riders with the common love for riding and has expanded to an internationally known race series that takes place in Los Angeles, California. The group has managed to receive sponsorships from several well-known companies including Castelli, which is an over-130-year-old Italian cycling clothing brand, helping spread interest and knowledge about the group and the races they hold. In San Francisco, California, Red Bull holds Red Bull Ride + Style events, which bring together both track and freestyle fixed-gear riders from around the world for competitions.|$|E
25|$|Moving to the Bay Area, San Francisco and San Jose have well {{established}} fixed gear communities who host several established races and community rides. For example, the San Jose Bike Party, {{held on the}} third Friday of every month, is dedicated to “building community through bicycling” and contains a majority of fixed gear riders, although all bikes are welcome. Moreover, companies such as Chrome Industries, who make bags and apparel catered toward bike messengers and urban cyclists, {{have been able to}} rise to worldwide prominence thanks to San Francisco and California’s biking community. Also, stores such as MASH SF based in San Francisco, and IMINUSD based in San Jose accommodate fixed-gear cyclist specifically with riding gear, parts, and a center for the fixed-gear riding community in their respective cities. MASH SF collaborates with the Italian bicycle manufacturing company, Cinelli, to make several fixed gear bike framesets, including {{what is known as the}} Cinelli MASH Histogram. Furthermore, Macaframa is a group of riders from San Francisco who release movies dedicated to fixed-gear riding that encompass the <b>fast</b> <b>paced</b> lifestyle that comes along with riding fixed.|$|E
25|$|The opening match {{matched the}} tecnico team of Molotov, Starman and Tigre Blanco (who do not {{regularly}} team up) face off against Los Guerreros Tuareg (Arkangel de la Muerte and Skándalo) and Nosferatu (who have teamed up on multiple occasions). The Rudo team proved victorious on the night, winning two falls to one. In the second match the Japanese team La Fiebre Amarilla ("The Yellow Fever") of Namajague and Okumura {{teamed up with}} Misterioso Jr. {{to take on the}} young high-flying trio of Diamante, Fuego and Tritón. During the match Delta landed awkwardly after executing a high risk move and had to be removed from the ring on a stretcher, fearing a serious injury. Fuego would pin Misterioso Jr. to win the third fall, which along with a victory in the first fall gave Fuego and his team the victory. CMLL normally includes a Lighting Match on their Super Viernes show unless they have a special reason to leave it out, and the August 3 edition did indeed feature a Lightning Match, pitting the Rudo veteran against the young, high-flying tecnico Stuka Jr.. The two wrestled a very <b>fast</b> <b>paced</b> match which ultimately saw El Felino pin Stuka Jr. before the time limit expired.|$|E

[...] Early in Paul's debut season, {{the team}} developed a reputation for their <b>fast</b> <b>paced</b> offense and spectacular alley-oop dunks, usually from Paul to Griffin or DeAndre Jordan, earning them the nickname [...] "Lob City". Paul finished the year averaging 19.8 points, 9.1 assists, and 2.5 steals per game, becoming the first Clipper to be named to the All-NBA First Team since the franchise moved to Los Angeles in the 1980s. Behind his play {{and the emergence of}} Griffin as an All-NBA performer, Los Angeles qualified for the playoffs, losing to the San Antonio Spurs in the Conference Semifinals.|$|E

Publishers Weekly praised the suspenseful {{ending of the}} first book and thought readers would find great interest in the bears' struggle to survive. Booklist found {{the plot of the}} first book to have an [...] "interesting balance of cute anthropomorphic characterization and realistic attention to bear behaviors." [...] School Library Journal wrote [...] "from the first page, this story is exciting and refreshing" [...] and [...] "he plot is <b>fast</b> <b>paced,</b> and the author is apt at creating and sustaining the adrenaline-charged mood of these youngsters on their own." [...] Kirkus Review found that [...] "Hunter creates a richly sensuous world filled with cruelty, beauty, tenderness, savagery and just enough underlying legendary background to add mystery." [...] However, the reviewer also felt that too much detail went into developing the characters and setting and there was very little plot. In a review for the second and third books, Horn Book Review felt that readers might experience some confusion about the mountain, but they would still enjoy the fantasy adventure and the descriptions of the animals.|$|E
