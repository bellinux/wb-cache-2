40|$|The {{conventional}} {{approach of}} source-term evaluation for performance assessment of nuclear waste repositories uses speciation-solubility modeling tools and assumes pure phases of radioelements control their solubility. This assumption may not reflect reality, as most radioelements (except for U) may not {{form their own}} pure phases. As a result, solubility limits predicted using the conventional approach are several orders of magnitude higher then the concentrations of radioelements measured in spent <b>fuel</b> <b>dissolution</b> experiments. This paper presents the author's attempt of using a non-conventional approach to evaluate source term of radionuclide release for Yucca Mountain. Based on the general reactive-transport code AREST-CT, a model for spent <b>fuel</b> <b>dissolution</b> and secondary phase precipitation has been constructed. The model accounts for both equilibrium and kinetic reactions. Its predictions have been compared against laboratory experiments and natural analogues. It is found that without calibrations, the simulated results match laboratory and field observations very well in many aspects. More important {{is the fact that}} no contradictions between them have been found. This provides confidence in the predictive power of the model. Based on the concept of Np incorporated into uranyl minerals, the model not only predicts a lower Np source-term than that given by conventional Np solubility models, but also produces results which are consistent with laboratory measurements and observations. Moreover, two hypotheses, whether Np enters tertiary uranyl minerals or not, have been tested by comparing model predictions against laboratory observations, the results favor the former. It is concluded that this non-conventional approach of source term evaluation not only eliminates over-conservatism in conventional solubility approach to some extent, but also gives a realistic representation of the system of interest, which is a prerequisite for truly understanding the long-term behavior of the proposed repository. Therefore, it is a very promising alternative approach for source-term evaluation...|$|E

Decontamination factor of AGS (silica-gel impregnated with silver nitrate) column for iodine- 129 removal was measured {{to be more}} than 36, 000. The measurement of iodine- 129 profile in the adsorption column showed that the nuclide was effectively trapped by the adsorbent. Measurement of iodine- 129 in the dissolver solution after the iodine-stripping operation using NO 2 gas at 363 K, revealed that less than 0. 57 % of total iodine- 129 generated, which was estimated by ORIGEN II calculation, was remained in the dissolver solution. Also, measurement of iodine- 129 by an iodine-stripping operation from the dissolver solution using potassium iodate showed that another 2. 72 % of total iodine- 129 precipitated as iodide. In addition, about 70 % of total iodine generated was measured in the AGS columns. Rest of iodine- 129 was supposed to adsorb to a HEPA filter and the inner surface of dissolver off-gas lines. Those results on iodine- 129 distribution were found to be almost identical to the results obtained in the study using iodine- 131 as tracer and the results reported by other works. It was demonstrated that the two-steps iodine-stripping method using potassium iodate could expel additional iodine from the solution, more effectively than iodine-stripping operation using NO 2 gas. Iodine- 131 was also detected on the AGS columns at the spent <b>fuel</b> <b>dissolution.</b> Increasing burnup showed larger amount of iodine- 131 since amount of curium- 244 contained in the spent fuel increased with the burnup.

40|$|As {{part of the}} HEU Blend Down project, {{aluminum}} tape {{is required}} to seal aluminum tubes that will hold contaminated Mark 22 <b>fuel</b> tubes for <b>dissolution.</b> From a large field of candidate tapes, Avery Dennison's Fasson 0802 tape (synthetic rubber adhesive system) {{was found to be}} acceptable for this application. This tape will disentangle in the normal H-Canyon dissolver solution and have no detrimental effect on the H-Canyon process. Upon placement of Fasson 0802 tape into the dissolver solution, nitric acid will attack and disentangle the block copolymer network and destroy the adhesive nature of the material, resulting in insoluble particles that can be removed via centrifuge operations (cake weight increase of no more than 1 percent). The addition of the tape will not generate off-gas products and the resultant solution characteristics (surface tension, viscosity, density, and disengagement time) will be unaffected. Further, the potential effect on the down-stream evaporation system is negligible. Since the tape will not be placed in a high radiation environment, radiation stability is not an issue. Through detailed discussions with Avery Dennison chemists and based on analytical tests, a fairly detailed understanding of the constituents comprising the proprietary adhesive system has been assembled. Most importantly, chlorine was not detected in the aluminum tape (neutron activation analysis detection limit is 16 ppm). Finally, application of this tape will not impact LEU specifications...|$|R
40|$|In many countries, spent {{nuclear fuel}} is {{considered}} as a waste form to be disposed of in underground disposal. Under deep host rock conditions, a reducing environment prevails. In the case of water contact, long-term radionuclide release from the <b>fuel</b> depends on <b>dissolution</b> processes of the UO 2 matrix. The dissolution rate of irradiated UO 2 is controlled by oxidizing processes facilitated by dissolved species formed by alpharadiolysis of water in contact with {{spent nuclear fuel}}. To understand {{the effect of the}} radiation, the information of the dose rate at the surface of the fuel and its proximity is needed. α particles contribute strongly due to their high linear energy transfer. However, their dose rate and the energy deposition at the fuel surface are difficult to measure. Cylindrical fuel pellets as used in fuel rods show specific features, such as the rim zone, where a higher Pu concentration and a different porosity of the fuel matrix is present. The a particle dose rate was determined by simulations with the code MCNPX with focus on the rim zone of a pellet. As a result a 40 % increased dose level in the rim zone exists in comparison to the center of a pellet. The potential dominant and inhomogeneous α-dose distribution is supposed to have a strong impact on radiolysis phenomena and in turn on an inhomogeneous dissolution of elements over the surface...|$|R
40|$|The basal {{regions of}} {{continental}} ice sheets are gaps {{in our current}} understanding of the Earth's biosphere and biogeochemical cycles. We draw on existing and new chemical data sets for subglacial meltwaters to provide the first comprehensive assessment of sub-ice sheet biogeochemical weathering. We show that size of the ice mass is a critical control on the balance of chemical weathering processes and that microbial activity is ubiquitous in driving <b>dissolution.</b> Carbonate <b>dissolution</b> <b>fueled</b> by sulfide oxidation and microbial CO 2 dominate beneath small valley glaciers. Prolonged meltwater residence times and greater isolation characteristic of ice sheets {{lead to the development}} of anoxia and enhanced silicate dissolution due to calcite saturation. We show that sub-ice sheet environments are highly geochemically reactive and should be considered in regional and global solute budgets. For example, calculated solute fluxes from Antarctica (72 - 130 t yr(- 1)) are the same order of magnitude as those from some of the world's largest rivers and rates of chemical weathering (10 - 17 t km(- 2) yr(- 1)) are high for the annual specific discharge (2. 3 - 4. 1 x 10 (- 3) m). Our model of chemical weathering dynamics provides important information on subglacial biodiversity and global biogeochemical cycles and may be used to design strategies for the first sampling of Antarctic Subglacial Lakes and other sub-ice sheet environments for the next decade...|$|R
