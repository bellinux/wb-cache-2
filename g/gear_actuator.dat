Flight returned to departure airport. After accomplishing emergency procedures for gear extension, gear safe indication was still not obtained. Pilot determined all hydraulic fluid had been lost. Flight was landed with the nose gear locked and the main gears partially extended. Post-landing examination revealed right main gear hydraulic actuator had failed due to overstress along metal grain boundaries and at area of low wall thickness. All hydraulic system pressures {{were found to be}} normal and no other landing gear system failures were found. After failure of the <b>gear</b> <b>actuator</b> all normal and emergency system fluid was lost through the actuator. Probable cause(s): Failure of the right main landing <b>gear</b> <b>actuator</b> due to overstress for undetermined reasons which resulted in loss of all landing gear system hydraulic fluid which in turn resulted in the pilot being unable to extend and lock the landing gear.|$|E

This control method does not require friction compensation and hence the estimation of this term because the control scheme is robust {{with respect to this}} effect. On the other hand, the only variables to measure are the motor shaft and tip angular positions. Velocity measurements, which always introduce errors and noises, are not required. Experimental results are presented...|$|E
40|$|The final {{publication}} {{is available}} at Springer via [URL] method of investigating quasi-static landing gear mechanisms is presented and applied to a three-dimensional aircraft main landing gear mechanism model. The model has 19 static equilibrium equations and 20 equations describing the geometric constraints in the mechanism. In the spirit of bifurcation analysis, solutions to these 39 steady-state equations are found and tracked, or continued, numerically in parameters of interest. A design case-study is performed on the land-ing <b>gear</b> <b>actuator</b> position to demonstrate the potential relevance of the method for industrial applications. The trade-off between maximal efficiency and peak actuator force reduction when positioning the actuator is investigated. It is shown that the problem formulation is very flexible and allows actuator force, length and efficiency information to be obtained from a single numerical continuation computation with minimal data post-processing. The study suggests that numerical continuation analysis has potential for investigating even more complex landing gear mechanisms, such as those {{with more than one}} sidestay...|$|E

40|$|Current {{landing gear}} {{mechanism}} analysis methods focus on determining purely geometric behaviour of the retraction mechanism, {{to ensure that}} the landing gear will meet its stowed constraints. For detailed analysis work, dynamic simulation is the standard method to determine underlying causes of nonlinear behaviour. The work presented in this thesis provides an alternative analysis approach for analysing quasi-static landing gear mechanisms, to be used to complement and inform the use of dynamic simulations. This alternative method of investigating quasi-static mechanisms is first presented for two planar mechanism example cases: an overcentre mechanism and a nose landing gear mechanism. The method uses static equilibrium equations along with equations describing the geometric constraints in the mechanism. In the spirit of bifurcation analysis, solutions to these steady-state equations are then continued numerically in parameters of interest. Results obtained from the numerical continuation agree with the equivalent results obtained from two overcentre mechanism dynamic models, whilst offering a considerable computation time reduction. The analysis performed with the nose landing gear model demonstrates the flexibility of the continuation approach, allowing conventional model states to be used as continuation parameters without a need to reformulate the equations within the model. The modelling approach is then demonstrated for the case of non-planar landing gear mechanisms, with application to a three-dimensional aircraft main landing gear mechanism model. A design case-study is performed on the landing <b>gear</b> <b>actuator</b> position to demonstrate the potential industrial relevance of the method. The trade-off between maximal efficiency and peak actuator force reduction when positioning the actuator is investigated. The problem formulation allows actuator force, length and efficiency information to be obtained from a single numerical continuation run with minimal data post-processing. Finally, a model of a dual sidestay landing gear mechanism is, presented and used to investigate the mechanism downlock sensitivity to attachment point deflections. Motivation for this study is provided by a desire to understand the underlying nonlinear behaviour that may prevent a dual sidestay landing gear from down- locking under certain conditions. An investigation into the effect of sidestay angle reveals that the geometry prevents the gear from fully retracting at certain sidestay angles. Sidestay flexi- bilities are then introduced to enable the downlock loads to be investigated. It is demonstrated that deflections of even a few milimetres can provide a force barrier to the landing gear down- locking. The underlying nonlinear behaviour is attributed to the formation of double hysteresis loop in the force-locklink angle plane. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

30|$|The robot {{orientation}} is {{controlled to be}} orthogonal to the stay face. To this end, the computed face-plate line is maintained orthogonal to the rotation axis of the P-Gear. Conversely, the nominal position of the P-Gear is estimated by detecting the corner position of the stay. Because {{the relationships between the}} nominal positions/orientations of the P-Gear and the stay are already known, the A-Gear can safely approach the P-Gear while rotating. As the corner intersects two plates, it is inevitably affected by assembly error. However, for increasing the transmission ratio in meshing, decreasing the deviation angle may be more effective than decreasing the deviated translation position (see Fig.  14). Consequently, laser range sensing can accurately localize the <b>gear</b> meshing <b>actuator</b> during objective tasking.|$|R
