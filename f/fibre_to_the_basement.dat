50|$|FTTB Rollout in Australia: National {{broadband}} companies TPG Telecom and iiNet, {{as well as}} the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, {{have published}} extensive submissions to the Federal Government supporting the right for commercial telcos to deploy their own <b>Fibre</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Basement</b> (FTTB) infrastructure throughout Australia in competition with the coalition’s National Broadband Network (NBN) project, rejecting the idea that such planned investments should be blocked or otherwise regulated to support National Broadband Network Co’s finances.|$|E
50|$|The Coalition (LNP) {{government}} {{elected in}} 2013 changed the rollout to include Fibre to the Node (FTTN), <b>Fibre</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Basement</b> (FTTB), and Hybrid Fibre Coax (HFC) {{as part of}} the LNP Government's so-called Multi Technology Mix (MTM). FTTH will be serviced to 22%, primary Greenfield developments, or areas with serviceable copper or business areas. FTTN, FTTB and HFC will be deployed to 71%. Wireless and satellite will serve the remaining 7% of the population who are located in remote/regional areas and are unable to be serviced by FTTP, FTTN, FTTB or HFC.|$|E
5000|$|In {{response}} <b>to</b> what <b>the</b> Abbott/Turnbull governments stated to be excessive {{performance specifications}} and costs they {{moved from a}} model which previously focused on FTTP (<b>Fibre</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Premises) <b>to</b> a Multi Technology Mix model using FTTx, including FTTP, FTTN (<b>Fibre</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Node), FTTB (<b>Fibre</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Building or <b>Basement)</b> and most recently FTTdp (<b>Fibre</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Distribution Point); and HFC (Hybrid Fibre Coaxial) in metropolitan areas. Regional and Remote areas were mainly unchanged {{as a result of}} the strategic review and typically receive a service using either Fixed Wireless, using LTE technology, or Satellite.|$|R
5000|$|On Day 25, <b>the</b> <b>Basement</b> nominees (Kelly and Pedro) moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Luxury House. <b>To</b> <b>the</b> Luxury Houses celebrities had two options: {{to choose}} two celebrities <b>to</b> move <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Basement,</b> or <b>to</b> don't move anyone <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Basement.</b> They decided <b>to</b> don't move anyone <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Basement.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{need for}} higher {{bandwidth}} by customers urges <b>the</b> network providers <b>to</b> upgrade their networks. <b>Fibre</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> home or <b>Fibre</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> curb {{are two of}} the scenarios that are considered. To make a proper assessment on the economic viability, a good estimation of the roll-out costs of the networks are important. Geometric models are easy to use for this estimation, but can be inaccurate. In this paper a new method <b>to</b> enhance <b>the</b> parameters of the geometric model is presented.

30|$|Fibre based {{networks}} are usually implemented using two infrastructures, <b>fibre</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> home (FTTH) and <b>fibre</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> node (FTTN). FTTH {{takes advantage of}} a potential unlimited spectrum, whereas FTTN uses VDSL 2 technology in the last 1000 m <b>to</b> reutilise <b>the</b> operator’s available copper technology. This avoids the need for trenching <b>fibre</b> <b>to</b> every home, thus reducing cost, while offering a competitive quality of service. XG-Fast technology can be considered <b>to</b> replace <b>the</b> VDSL 2 in the FTTN scheme.|$|R
