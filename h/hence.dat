5|$|The {{disadvantages}} of the turbine were eventually overcome. The solution which eventually was generally adopted was the geared turbine, where gearing reduced the rotation {{rate of the}} propellers and <b>hence</b> increased efficiency. This solution required technical precision in the gears and <b>hence</b> was difficult to implement.|$|E
5|$|A {{special case}} of {{intramolecular}} hydrogen bonds within proteins, poorly shielded from water attack and <b>hence</b> promoting their own dehydration, are called dehydrons.|$|E
5|$|According to Vishishtadvaita the jīvātman {{is a part}} of Brahman, and <b>hence</b> is similar, but not identical.|$|E
5|$|Ammianus' {{narrative}} {{makes clear}} that Chnodomar ordered an unusually strong levy. <b>Hence</b> the presence at Strasbourg of all eight contemporary Alamanni kings and of the non-Alammanni allies.|$|E
5|$|As of August 2008, {{the most}} recent {{calculation}} of HD 209458 b's Rossiter–McLaughlin effect and <b>hence</b> spin–orbit angle is −4.4 ± 1.4°.|$|E
5|$|Black bear {{activity}} {{along the}} trail in New Jersey increased rapidly starting in 2001. <b>Hence,</b> metal bear-proof trash boxes are in place at all New Jersey shelters.|$|E
5|$|Classification of the Ediacarans is difficult, and <b>hence</b> {{a variety}} of {{theories}} exist as to their placement on the tree of life.|$|E
5|$|Differentiation and {{integration}} of power series can be performed term by term and is <b>hence</b> particularly easy.|$|E
5|$|Dissecting aneurysms of the {{vertebral}} artery constitute 4% of all cerebral aneurysms, and are <b>hence</b> a relatively rare but important cause of subarachnoid hemorrhage.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though this}} is the franchise's first Super Bowl victory, it is their 10th league {{championship}} <b>hence</b> the number 10 after the Super Bowl I line.|$|E
5|$|Fizeau's {{experiment}} is <b>hence</b> supporting {{evidence for the}} collinear case of Einstein's velocity addition formula.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hence</b> Jainism enjoins its adherents to {{completely}} avoid violence to higher-sensed beings {{and as far}} as possible minimise violence to lower-sensed and single-sensed beings.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hence</b> light {{traveling}} {{against the}} flow of water should be slower than light traveling with {{the flow of}} water.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hence</b> {{the atomic}} nuclei, which are much heavier than an electron, {{contribute}} negligibly to the scattered X-rays.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hence,</b> as the {{accompanying}} diagram shows, total revenue is maximized at {{the combination of}} price and quantity demanded where the elasticity of demand is unitary.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hence,</b> double {{bonds are}} formed by sharing a face between two cubic atoms. This {{results in the}} sharing of four electrons.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hence,</b> {{the court}} {{reasoned}} that Hemi's {{decision not to}} do business with New York indicated that it should have foreseen being brought to court in Illinois for selling cigarettes to Illinois residents.|$|E
5|$|Heraldic {{arms were}} worn (embroidered) on a coat which knights wore over their armor, <b>hence</b> coat of arms, a term which dates back roughly 1,000 years to jousting tournaments.|$|E
5|$|Ice rafted debris distribution: Sediment {{transported by}} ice {{does not extend}} as far East during H3/6. <b>Hence</b> some {{researchers}} have been moved to suggest a European origin {{for at least some}} H3/6 clasts: America and Europe were originally adjacent to one another; <b>hence,</b> the rocks on each continent are difficult to distinguish, and the source is open to interpretation (Grousset et al. 2000).|$|E
5|$|More generally, {{whenever}} H is a bipartite graph, H-colorability {{is equivalent}} to K2-colorability (or K'0 / K'1-colorability when H is empty/edgeless), <b>hence</b> equally easy to decide.|$|E
5|$|Reptation is a snake-like {{movement}} (<b>hence</b> the name) involving sequential {{motion of}} cluster sub-units (see figure 11(c)).|$|E
5|$|T. o. pattersonianus (Lydekker, 1906; East African eland or Patterson's eland): {{also called}} billingae. It {{is found in}} east Africa, <b>hence</b> its common name. Its coat can have up to 12 stripes.|$|E
5|$|The exact {{mechanism}} of action remained unknown until it was demonstrated, in 1978, that warfarin inhibits the enzyme epoxide reductase and <b>hence</b> interferes with vitamin K metabolism.|$|E
5|$|Thymine and uracil, nucleic {{bases of}} {{thymidine}} and uridine, respectively, {{do not have}} exocyclic amino groups and <b>hence</b> do not require any protection.|$|E
5|$|Using {{hormonal}} combined contraceptive pills {{also helps}} {{in reducing the}} chances of PID by thickening the cervical mucosal plug & <b>hence</b> preventing the ascent of causative organisms from the lower genital tract.|$|E
25|$|Quasi-regular: vertex-transitive and edge-transitive (and <b>hence</b> has regular faces) but not face-transitive. A quasi-regular dual is face-transitive and edge-transitive (and <b>hence</b> every vertex is regular) but not vertex-transitive.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hence,</b> {{for every}} good node u, the {{probability}} that a neighbour of u is selected to S and remains in S is a certain positive constant. <b>Hence,</b> {{the probability that}} u is removed, in each step, is at least a positive constant.|$|E
25|$|The key {{disadvantages}} {{include the}} relatively low rotational speed with the consequential higher torque and <b>hence</b> higher cost of the drive train, the inherently lower power coefficient, the 360-degree rotation of the aerofoil within the wind flow during each cycle and <b>hence</b> the highly dynamic loading on the blade, the pulsating torque generated by some rotor designs on the drive train, {{and the difficulty of}} modelling the wind flow accurately and <b>hence</b> the challenges of analysing and designing the rotor prior to fabricating a prototype.|$|E
25|$|Dahlgren's {{great-grandfather}} was Swedish, <b>hence</b> her Swedish surname.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hence</b> P∞(R) is the Eilenberg-Maclane space K(Z/2Z, 1).|$|E
25|$|<b>Hence</b> it {{is wrong}} to kill the embryo.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hence</b> {{the drag}} vanishes. This is d'Alembert's paradox.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hence,</b> s cannot {{occur in}} the enumeration.|$|E
25|$|Lithium, {{increases}} excretion, <b>hence</b> reducing therapeutic effect.|$|E
25|$|For C, and <b>hence</b> by the Lefschetz {{principle}} for every algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, the torsion group of an abelian variety of dimension g is isomorphic to (Q/Z)2g. <b>Hence,</b> its n-torsion part is isomorphic to (Z/nZ)2g, i.e. {{the product of}} 2g copies of the cyclic group of order n.|$|E
