5|$|The {{building}} has two rooms and an attached kitchen {{on the ground}} floor with a staircase between them leading to the living quarters in the first floor rooms. The <b>front</b> <b>room</b> may originally have been a shop but was not used for trade after the installation of the new front wall in the 16th century. The <b>front</b> <b>room</b> has recesses {{on either side of the}} arched fireplace. The rear room {{on the ground floor}} was the hall and still has its 16th-century ceiling panels and four-light window. The ceiling has plaster decorations from the Elizabethan era, when the kitchen block was also added.|$|E
5|$|Phillips first sold {{bicycles}} and motorbikes, but later started selling and recharging batteries {{in a shop}} in the <b>front</b> <b>room</b> of his house in 1925. After a decline in demand for batteries in the early 1950s, he started selling electrical goods and popular records. In 1955, Phillips set up a recording studio called Phillips' Sound Recording Services.|$|E
5|$|The register's {{nomination}} gives {{details of}} the paneling and molding throughout the house. Entering through {{the front of the}} house leads to the central hall with a paneled wainscot below the chair rail, forward of the rising stairwell on the left. There is cornice molding and a molded chair rail with runners for the inside shutters. The woodwork in the west <b>front</b> <b>room</b> has a paneled fireplace and is wainscoted below the chair rail. The east rear room is divided in two, with one of the divisions being a bathroom. The upstairs rooms have molded chair rails and cased flair posts. However, the east <b>front</b> <b>room</b> lacks a fireplace while the western one is paneled as the first floor's front west room. The roof of the house is framed by sawn collar beams that were pegged to rafters which were hewn. The chimney stacks are angled so that they emerge symmetrically from the roof.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>front</b> <b>rooms</b> have triple bay windows. Above {{the front}} door are {{ornamental}} leadlight panels, the centre one of which includes the word [...] "ANZAC".

50|$|Situated {{on a hill}} {{overlooking}} Tuscumbia, {{the house}} has a double-height portico flanked by six-over-six sash windows on each floor. Twin entrance doors lead into separate <b>front</b> <b>rooms</b> that were {{a portion of the}} house as originally built. Each room has an Adamesque mantel. A transverse rear hall was added around 1923, joining the main block with a detached kitchen. The main stairway to the second floor was moved to this hall, replacing separate stairhalls in the <b>front</b> <b>rooms.</b>|$|R

5|$|The front entry {{leads into}} the living room where {{polished}} wood is found throughout as well as 19th century furnishings. The <b>front</b> <b>room</b> is part of the original building which consisted of one room. The room acted as the Deere's kitchen, living room, bedrooms, essentially everything. Deere eventually added onto the house, including a bedroom and an upstairs loft. The first floor bedroom would have been used for John and his wife, and possibly a couple of the children while the upstairs room would was used {{for the rest of the}} children. The Deeres left the home in 1847 when they moved to Moline, Illinois.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the {{building}} is not well documented, {{although the majority of}} the present stone house was constructed in the 15th century on the site of a 12th-century wooden building. The current front wall was added in the 16th century. It {{has been used as a}} merchant's house and possibly a shop and school. It was thought that it was the venue for court proceedings, hence the title Tribunal, however there is no evidence this ever occurred. One of the ground floor rooms still has the window and ceiling panels from the Elizabethan era. The <b>front</b> <b>room</b> upstairs has an arched braced, wooden, truss roof.|$|E
5|$|The {{main bar}} {{was large and}} black with curves in many directions. The room had black and white zebra-patterned wallpaper, {{in the style of}} New York's El Morocco club, and an indoor {{waterfall}} surrounded by imitation exotic vegetation stood in the back. Beyond the main bar was a smaller bar and a small showroom, and after that the club's main showroom, the Vermilion Room, with its burgundy velvet wallpaper. The small <b>front</b> <b>room</b> was used for year-round lounge acts and the main showroom with supper service featured top-billed acts in the summer months and for special bookings.|$|E

50|$|Burnside was a gentleman's {{farmhouse}} {{as opposed}} to a working farmhouse. The ground floor was taken up with servant's rooms, with a kitchen at the front and cellars going into the hill at the back. Steps led up {{to the front door and}} into the entrance hall with spacious <b>front</b> <b>rooms</b> on either side. Each of the two <b>front</b> <b>rooms</b> had three windows facing south. The high sloping roof had dormer windows for the third floor rooms, of which only two (each measuring twenty four square feet) had ceilings, while the rest of the area was a large open attic.|$|R
5|$|The wooden stairs {{leading to}} the first floor {{replaced}} an earlier stone staircase, the remains of which can be seen protruding from the walls. The <b>front</b> <b>room</b> on the first floor had previously been partitioned, but the larger space was created when the new front wall was added to the building. Its roof has arched braced wooden trusses. The rear room still has the remains of a large fireplace, however, the chimney was blocked when the downstairs fireplace was installed.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{he started}} selling {{bicycles}} and motorbikes {{in a small}} shop in Brunswick Street, in the Kensington Fields area of Liverpool. He began selling and recharging batteries in 1925, opening a shop in the <b>front</b> <b>room</b> of his family's three-storey Georgian terraced house, called Phillips’ Battery Charging Depot, and had to install large accumulators in the cellar. Phillips ran the business for 30 years, even during WWII, but due {{to a decline in}} demand for batteries in the early 1950s (most people having electricity by then) he started selling household electrical goods. By late 1954, the shop was only selling records and record players; customers would buy recordings of American Country and Western, and Big Band music. As Phillips had supplied batteries to the Burtonwood air base during the war, he could buy and sell the latest records from America via his contacts there.|$|E
5|$|At {{one point}} at Morley Memorial Junior School he was taught by Roger Waters' mother, Mary. Later, in 1957, he {{attended}} Cambridgeshire High School for Boys (with Waters). His father {{died of cancer}} on 11 December 1961, {{less than a month}} before Barrett's 16th birthday. Also on this day, Barrett had left the entry in his diary blank. By this time, his brothers and sisters had left home and his mother decided to rent out rooms to lodgers. Eager to help her son recover from his grief, Barrett's mother encouraged the band in which he played, Geoff Mott and The Mottoes, a band which Barrett formed, to perform in their <b>front</b> <b>room.</b> Roger Waters and Syd Barrett were childhood friends, and Waters often visited such gigs. At one point, Waters even organised a gig, a CND benefit at Friends Meeting House on 11 March 1962, but shortly afterwards Geoff Mott joined the Boston Crabs, and the Mottoes broke up.|$|E
50|$|The {{first floor}} has four rooms. The larger of the <b>front</b> <b>rooms</b> has the central front entrance. The smaller {{room on the}} left is {{connected}} to the large room by a single door. The two rear rooms are the same size. They are divided by the central hall with staircase. The <b>front</b> <b>rooms</b> have barrel-vaulted fireplaces with high mantels on their back walls. The left hand rear room has had small bathroom added at a later period. The floor plan of the basement {{is the same as the}} first floor. The upper floor has four rooms with small fireplaces.|$|R
50|$|The College's {{foundational}} {{structure was}} designed around two central courtyards: Girls' Quad and Boys' Quad. The names echo the separate living arrangements in the College after female residents were first admitted in the 1960s; a practice {{which has since}} been discontinued. The majority of the rooms were divided into alcoves of four, with two <b>front</b> <b>rooms</b> and two back rooms. Typically, the back rooms were larger and allocated to returning residents or 'seniors', whilst the <b>front</b> <b>rooms</b> were allocated to first-year residents or 'freshers'. These alcoves were thus affectionately dubbed 'alcove families', with two males and two females constituting each group.|$|R
50|$|In {{the rear}} {{he had the}} servants' {{quarters}} converted into the porch and added the Palladian window. Inside, he had the two <b>front</b> <b>rooms</b> {{on the east side}} combined into a large parlor. He also landscaped the backyard.|$|R
5|$|The 1828 {{construction}} {{features a}} central hall with three {{rooms on the}} east and west sides of roughly symmetrical construction with chimneys at the intersection of the front and middle rooms. The first floor chimneys were flanked by doors allowing access to the other rooms and storage on the other side. The layout and usage of the jail is not known for certain, but it is believed that the rooms to the west were used by the jailer and his family. The first room as a parlor, the middle as the dining room and the rear room as the kitchen. As part of the renovations in 1959, the Society changed the parlor to a research room, the dining room into a library and added a door to the stairway from the kitchen. The front research room and library retain the original fireplaces, pine floorboards and closets, but the connecting passage between the two rooms were changed to a bathroom. The east side of the jail {{is believed to have been}} used by the jailer for his occupational duties, with the <b>front</b> <b>room</b> as a public reception room and the middle room as his office. The rear room in the back may have been used for record or other storage. After leasing the property, the Society removed the partitions in the rooms that separated the rooms from each other.|$|E
5|$|Cullompton Manor House is a grade II* listed {{building}} with sections built in 1603 (dated panel and initials TT for Thomas Trock {{on the top}} corner of {{the front of the}} house) and 1718 (on a lead cistern head of a drainpipe, are the letters (L) S/WT (R) and the date 1718). It was originally a private residence and now forms part of the Manor House Hotel. It has a jettied half timbered front with four gables and stone end walls with upper windows on carved brackets. It was probably built in the sixteenth century but was refurbished in 1603 for Thomas Trock, a clothier. The original structure consisted only of the front part, in which there were three rooms and a passage on the ground floor, three rooms opening into each other on the floor above, and above again. The <b>front</b> <b>room</b> on the left was the former hall with large oak panels of the Queen Anne period, and a moulded and beamed ceiling. Part of an earlier newel stair which descended to the hall or kitchen survives above a back staircase. The house was remodelled in 1718 for William Sellock. At the front of the building is a hooded shell porch of the early 18th century supported on pilasters and the back of house is also early 18th century of red and blue brick, with windows with thick glazing bars beneath a hipped slate roof with coved eaves. It was given the name of The Manor House in 1850 by J. S. Upcott who owned the property at that time. During World War II it was requisitioned by the army and used to billet officers. The adjacent house, Veryards, was originally a separate residence but was bought by the owners of the Manor House Hotel and incorporated into the hotel in the 1980s.|$|E
