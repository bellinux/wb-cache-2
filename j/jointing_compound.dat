50|$|Ready-mix {{lightweight}} <b>joint</b> <b>compound</b> is a pre-made form of <b>joint</b> <b>compound</b> {{designed for}} fast application and easy maintenance. The compound {{is a complex}} combination often including water, limestone, expanded perlite, ethylene-vinyl acetate polymer, attapulgite, and other ingredients. The delicate mixture of compounds gives it a creamy texture that spreads easily onto drywall surfaces and then hardens as the moisture evaporates.

Ready-mix <b>joint</b> <b>compound</b> is usually more forgiving than the setting type of <b>joint</b> <b>compound.</b> It can be used for as long a period of time as needed, and does not dry up unless left unattended for a long period of time, but must be kept from freezing.

40|$|<b>Joint</b> <b>compound</b> {{products}} containing {{chrysotile asbestos}} {{were commonly used}} for building con-struction from the late 1940 s through the mid- 1970 s. Few relevant data exist to support recon-structing historical worker exposures to fibers generated by working with this material. Therefore, we re-created 1960 s-era chrysotile-containing <b>joint</b> <b>compound</b> (JCC) and compared its characteristics to a current-day asbestos-free <b>joint</b> <b>compound</b> (JCN). Validation studies showed that a bench-scale chamber with controlled flow dynamics, designed to quantify partic-ulate emissions from <b>joint</b> <b>compound</b> products, provided precise and reliable measurements of generated airborne dust mass, chrysotile fiber concentrations, and corresponding activity-specific emission rates. Subsequent chamber studies characterized fibers counted by phase con-trast microscopy (PCM) per mass of respirable dusts and total suspended particulate dusts (total dusts), generated during JCC sanding or sweeping, as well as corresponding dust emission rates for JCC and JCN, and the ratio of total to respirable dust mass for JCN.

40|$|Chrysotile-containing <b>joint</b> <b>compound</b> was {{commonly}} used in construction of residential and commercial buildings through the mid 1970 s; however, these products have not been manufactured in the United States for more than 30 years. Little is known about actual human exposures to chrysotile fibers that may have resulted from use of chrysotile-containing <b>joint</b> <b>compounds,</b> because few exposure and no health-effects {{studies have been conducted}} specifically with these products. Because limited amounts of historical <b>joint</b> <b>compounds</b> are available (and the stability or representativeness of aged products is suspect), it is currently impossible to conduct meaningful studies to better understand the nature and magnitude of potential exposures to chrysotile that may have been associated with historical use of these products. Therefore, to support specific exposure and toxicology research activities, two types of chrysotile-containing <b>joint</b> <b>compounds</b> were produced according to original formulations from the late 1960 s. To the extent possible, ingredients were the same as those used originally, with many obtained from the original suppliers. The chrysotile used historically in these products was primarily Grade 7 RF 9 from the Philip Carey mine. Because this mine is closed, a suitable alternate was identified by comparing the sizes and mineral composition of asbestos structures in a sample of what has been represented to be historical <b>joint</b> <b>compound</b> (all of which were chrysotile) to those in samples of three currently commercially available Grade 7 chrysotile products. The re-created materials generally conformed to original product specifications (e. g. viscosity, workability, crack resistance), indicating that these materials are sufficiently representative of the original products to support research activities...|$|R

50|$|Drywall {{finishers}} use {{the mesh}} frequently. In fact, {{it is common}} to replace the paper tape used to float the joint between two pieces of drywall. The mesh that drywall finishers use comes on a roll just like paper drywall tape. The added benefit for the drywall finisher is to roll out the mesh over a great distance before having to apply the first coat of <b>joint</b> <b>compound.</b> Not only does it help them in this manner, but it also causes a stronger bond between the <b>joint</b> <b>compound,</b> the tape and the wall.|$|R
50|$|Quicker.The overall {{calendar}} {{time from}} beginning to end for a plaster veneer project is typically slightly shorter than for conventional drywall.(N.B.

Some drywall <b>joint</b> <b>compounds</b> ("hot mud") set chemically, allowing rapid re-coating, but these compounds can make sanding more difficult.

50|$|Drywall {{finishers}} {{also use}} this tape to patch holes. The most common {{hole in the}} drywall generally occurs where a doorknob has hit a wall too many times. If it is only slightly damaged, a couple of short pieces of the tape will be formed into a square and placed over the hole. A <b>joint</b> <b>compound</b> will then be applied directly to it. If the hole is too large to patch with fiberglass mesh alone, a piece of metal flashing can be added behind the tape before applying <b>joint</b> <b>compound.</b> Construction work {{is not the only}} use for fiberglass mesh.|$|R
