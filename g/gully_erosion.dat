The Ekulu, Asata, Ogbete, Aria, Idaw and Nyaba rivers are the six largest rivers located in the city.

2500|$|On Madagascar's {{highland}} plateau, {{a massive}} transformation occurred that eliminated {{virtually all the}} heavily forested vegetation in the period 1970 to 2000. The slash and burn agriculture eliminated about {{ten percent of the}} total country's native biomass and converted it to a barren wasteland. These effects were from overpopulation and the necessity to feed poor indigenous peoples, but the adverse effects included widespread <b>gully</b> <b>erosion</b> that in turn produced heavily silted rivers that [...] "run red" [...] decades after the deforestation. This eliminated a large amount of usable fresh water and also destroyed much of the riverine ecosystems of several large west-flowing rivers.

40|$|Terrestrial {{close range}} digital photogrammetric methods {{were used to}} obtain {{three-dimensional}} data on <b>erosion</b> <b>gullies</b> associated with waste rock dumps at Newmont Australia’s Jundee gold mining operations. Digital stereo pairs of photographs were taken at each site and three-dimensional images produced using the CSIRO software package SIRO 3 D. Difficulties associated with producing accurate three-dimensional images included: aspect; complex gully morphology; and excessive vegetation in and around gullies. Data from each image were then imported into the GIS program ArcView, where gully volumes were calculated and gully morphology (profile shape and length) was documented. The gully data were then used to develop parameters for the landform evolution model SIBERIA. The three main parameters of the model were adjusted until the simulated gullies were of similar morphology and volume to those measured in the field. The model was then used to predict {{the evolution of the}} waste rock dumps through periods of up to several hundred years using the derived parameters. The SIBERIA parameters derived were comparable with parameters developed during previous erosion studies performed at the site.

The study revealed that rainfall in the area is erosive, while analysis of data on rills and gullies using the student t-test shows that greater length and depth of erosion occurs on the hill slope farmlands than on the flat land farmlands. This could be because though the hill slopes are steep and erosion can easily occur, in addition is that, farmers also practice arable farming extensively on them.

The {{objectives of the}} study are to identify the craters, the geomorphic processes involved in their modifications; analysed the thickness and Layering of the overburden materials of the craters. Data used for this research were generated from field observations, topographic map and resistivity sounding. Three sampled craters namely Kumba, Tilla and Jali Tagurmi were purposively selected for the study. The thickness of the overburden in the crater were determined using the SAS ABEM 300 C sounding technique at ten sample points. The data were processed and interpreted using the IXID inversion computer software. Denudational processes observed on the rims of the craters include weathering, sheet, rill, <b>gully</b> <b>erosions</b> and mass wasting (rock fall, soil creep, debris creep and slides). Results showed that there are fourteen craters on the Biu plateau; four large (> 300 m) in diameter, five medium (200 - 300 m) and five small (< 200 m). The resistivity sounding results revealed that most of graphic curve models belong to the K and KH while layered models ranges from three to four layers beneath each VES station. The lithology {{could be described as}} clay, weathered Basalt, partly weathered/ fractured Basement and newer basalt. The resistivity values of the layered models ranges from 18. 16 to 2280. ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} rainfall thresholds for erosion and sediment yield {{in the upper}} Yangtze River basin. Sediment reduction effects of soil conservation measures depend on the magnitudes of rainstorm. When the latter {{is less than a}} critical threshold, sediment reduction effects of soil conservation measures are positive; when this magnitude is exceeded, the effect is negative. An analysis based on data from the Jialingjiang River shows that the sediment reduction by soil conservation measures increased with annual precipitation to a peak, and then decreased to a negative value. The annual precipitation at the peak and zero values of sediment reduction are 970 and 1, 180 mm, respectively, which can be regarded as two thresholds. Annual precipitation at the zero-value of sediment reduction has a return period of 25 years. In general, the design standard of soil conservation works in China is related with rainstorms with return periods of 10 - 20 years. When the magnitude of rainstorm exceeds this, the soil conservation works may be partly or totally destroyed by rainstorms, and the previously trapped sediment may be released, resulting in a sharp increase in sediment yield. It was also found in the lower Jinshajiang River that when annual precipitation exceeds 1, 050 mm or high-flow season precipitation exceeds 850 mm, the annual sediment yield increased sharply. These can also be regarded as key rainfall thresholds for erosion and sediment yields. When precipitation is less than the two thresholds, dominant erosion types are sheet, rill and <b>gully</b> <b>erosions.</b> When precipitation crosses the two thresholds, debris flows may occur more frequently. As a result, the previously stored loose sediment is released and sediment yield increases sharply. © 2008 Springer-Verlag...|$|R
