5|$|In May 2001, it was {{announced}} that Sony Pictures Entertainment would distribute the film in North America. It was suggested by Capcom executives that the film would not be released in 2001, but rather in 2002, which was later confirmed by Sony in August 2001. The film was set for release on 5 April 2002 before being pushed <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> 15 March release.|$|E
5|$|Irenaeus' eschatology {{was based}} on a literal {{interpretation}} of the Bible, especially the Book of Revelation. He believed that there would be 6000 years of suffering before the world ends in a fiery purge. This fire would purify believers ahead of a new human community existing in the New Jerusalem. The afterlife, Irenaeus proposed, focuses more on time than space; he looked <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> time in which humans are fully developed and live the life of God.|$|E
5|$|Originally, the weight-reduction phase had {{included}} removing the anchors from the battleship, but Wallin ordered {{one of the}} anchors to be reattached. His reason for doing so was that the anchor would effectively shift Missouris center of gravity <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> narrower part of the battleship, thereby reducing the friction at her widest point. During this time, the Bureau of Ships offered valuable technical and salvage advice to both the civilian and military participants in the salvage effort.|$|E

5|$|Stacking or rigging the subwoofers in a {{vertical}} array focuses the low frequencies <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{greater or lesser}} extent depending on the physical length of the array. Longer arrays have a more directional effect at lower frequencies. The directionality is more pronounced in the vertical dimension, yielding a radiation pattern that is wide but not tall. This helps {{reduce the amount of}} low frequency sound bouncing off the ceiling indoors and assists in mitigating external noise complaints outdoors.|$|E
5|$|The {{mandible}} (lower jaw) is robust. The two masseteric ridges, which anchor {{some of the}} chewing muscles, {{are joined}} together as a single crest {{for a portion of}} their length and extend <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> point below the first molar. The capsular process, a raising of the mandibular bone at the back end of the lower incisor, is well developed.|$|E
5|$|During Modi's {{second term}} {{the rhetoric of}} the {{government}} shifted from Hindutva to Gujarat's economic development. Modi curtailed the influence of Sangh Parivar organisations such as the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) and the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP), entrenched in the state after the decline of Ahmedabad's textile industry, and dropped Gordhan Zadafia (an ally of former Sangh co-worker and VHP state chief Praveen Togadia) from his cabinet. When the BKS staged a farmers' demonstration Modi ordered their eviction from state-provided houses, and his decision to demolish 200 illegal temples in Gandhinagar deepened the rift with the VHP. Sangh organisations were no longer consulted or informed in advance about Modi's administrative decisions. Nonetheless, Modi retained connections with some Hindu nationalists. Modi wrote a <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> textbook by Dinanath Batra released in 2014, which stated that ancient India possessed technologies including test-tube babies.|$|E

5|$|Jewish {{religion}} was unusual in that Jews acknowledged only one God, they considered themselves chosen by him, {{and they wanted}} Gentiles to accept their God as the only God. Jews based their faith and religious practice on the Torah, five books {{said to have been}} given by God to Moses. The three prominent religious parties were the Pharisees, the Essenes, and the Sadducees. Together these parties represented {{only a small fraction of}} the population. Most Jews looked <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> time that God would deliver them from their pagan rulers, possibly through war against the Romans.|$|E
5|$|On the mandible, the {{diastema}} is {{very large}} and the incisor is procumbent (projecting forward), which distinguishes Apeomyoides from most eomyids apart from Megapeomys. There is a masseteric scar (associated with the jaw muscles) from below the m1 <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> point in front of p4, below the mental foramen, {{an opening in the}} jawbone. In Apeomys and Megapeomys this scar only reaches {{to the level of the}} front root of p4. The mental foramen is very small and opens in the diastema, near the ventral shelf of the scar; in Apeomys and Megapeomys it is located near the dorsal shelf. Further foramina are present on the lingual (inner) surface of the bone, below the cheekteeth.|$|E
5|$|The couple put {{extra effort}} into {{avoiding}} {{the issues that}} had caused strife before their separation: Despite being an indifferent cook and housekeeper, Green {{tried to focus on}} cooking and keeping the new house cleaner, while Farrar vowed to curtail his work hours so that he could spend more time with the family. The improvements lasted mere months, however, {{and by the end of}} 1994, both Green and Farrar had fallen back to their old habits and the marriage was again floundering. Fearful of another confrontation with Green, and looking <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> trip to Peru the family had planned for June 1995, Farrar nevertheless decided to wait until after the trip to raise the issue of a divorce again.|$|E

5|$|The {{propellers}} of a DC-6 {{are designed}} to provide reverse thrust after the aircraft touches down. The pilot then retards the throttle levers to a point below idle speed and that directs the electric mechanisms in the propeller hub to rotate the blades to a position in which they will provide reverse thrust. Should the pilot need to perform a go-around, he moves the thrust levers <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> positive position again and that will produce forward thrust, enabling the pilot to execute a go-around maneuver.|$|E
5|$|Thirty Flights of Loving {{begins with}} the player walking through a small {{corridor}} where individual gameplay elements such as movement and key allocations are explained. After walking through a bar and several more corridors, Anita and Borges are introduced. All three characters then exit on a plane. A smash cut skips the narrative <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> scene with Anita and Borges lying shot {{in a room full}} of crates. The player character lifts Borges and takes him outside to what looks to be an airport. The player is then taken to a dark room with Anita sitting on a chair, peeling and eating oranges. After walking through another corridor, Anita, Borges, and the player join a wedding.|$|E
5|$|Though the Proclamation of Indonesian Independence {{was made}} on 17 August 1945, news did not reach Riau until September. In the {{following}} months, Soeman {{was elected to the}} newly formed Indonesian National Committee for Pasir Pengaraian, and later made its chairman. In this capacity, he had {{to strike a balance between}} former colonial staff who were looking <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Dutch return and those who supported an independent Indonesia; Dutch forces were returning to Java, and physical conflict had already broken out between Allied forces and the Indonesian republicans in Surabaya. The following year, Soeman was elected to the Regional Representatives' Council for Riau, based out of Pekanbaru.|$|E

The full background to this event and Harry Potter's past is revealed gradually through the series. After the introductory chapter, the book leaps <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> time shortly before Harry Potter's eleventh birthday, and it is at this point that his magical background begins to be revealed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sixth}} season, Gilchrist made a {{comeback}} for his final IPL stint. He stated the reason {{as being the}} Kings XI management's decision to renew his contract for another season. An interesting change in the team staff was the induction of Darren Lehmann as the new Kings XI coach. This brought together the duo of Gilchrist and Lehmann who had guided their previous franchise, the Deccan Chargers to its 2009 IPL victory. Some good performances by the players led the Kings XI Punjab team eyeing for the fourth spot in the play-offs and a possible maiden win under Gilchrist's leadership. They were knocked out very late in the tournament. In his final game at IPL, Gilchrist decided to bowl the last over of the match against the Mumbai Indians, where he got the wicket of Harbhajan Singh of his first ball, securing KXIP's victory in the match. In a recent press conference, Gilchrist has confirmed {{that this will be}} his final IPL season and that he was looking <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> fresh start in the inaugural Caribbean Premier League in July 2013.|$|E
5|$|Many adult insects use six {{legs for}} walking and {{have adopted a}} tripedal gait. The tripedal gait allows for rapid walking while always having a stable stance and has been studied {{extensively}} in cockroaches and ants. The legs are used in alternate triangles touching the ground. For the first step, the middle right leg and {{the front and rear}} left legs are in contact with the ground and move the insect forward, while the front and rear right leg and the middle left leg are lifted and moved <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> new position. When they touch the ground to form a new stable triangle the other legs can be lifted and brought forward in turn and so on. The purest form of the tripedal gait is seen in insects moving at high speeds. However, this type of locomotion is not rigid and insects can adapt a variety of gaits. For example, when moving slowly, turning, avoiding obstacles, climbing or slippery surfaces, four (tetrapod) or more feet (wave-gait) may be touching the ground. Insects can also adapt their gait to cope with the loss of one or more limbs.|$|E

5|$|The royal {{pages were}} {{adolescent}} boys {{and young men}} conscripted from aristocratic households and serving the kings of Macedonia perhaps from the reign of Philip II onward, although more solid evidence for {{their presence in the}} royal court dates to the reign of Alexander the Great. Royal pages played no direct role in high politics and were conscripted as a means to introduce them to political life. After a period of training and service, pages were expected to become members of the king's companions and personal retinue. During their training, pages were expected to guard the king as he slept, supply him with horses, aid him in mounting his horse, accompany him on royal hunts, and serve him during symposia (i.e. formal drinking parties). While conscripted pages would have looked <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> lifelong career at court or even a prestigious post as a governor, they can also be regarded as hostages held by the royal court in order to ensure the loyalty and obedience of their aristocratic fathers. The abusive punishment of pages, such as flogging, carried out by the king at times, led to intrigue and conspiracy against the Crown, as did the frequent homosexual relations between the pages and the elite, sometimes with the king. Although there is little evidence for royal pages throughout the Antigonid period, it is known that a group of them fled with Perseus of Macedon to Samothrace following his defeat by the Romans in 168 BC.|$|E
5|$|The scene then flashes <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> plane {{returning}} Frank {{home from}} prison, where Carl informs {{him that his}} father has died. Grief-stricken, Frank escapes from the plane {{and goes back to}} his old house, where he finds his mother with the man she left his father for, as well as a girl who Frank realizes is his half-sister. Frank gives himself up and is sentenced to 12 years in prison, getting visits from time to time from Carl. When Frank points out how one of the checks Carl is carrying as evidence is fake, Carl convinces the FBI to offer Frank a deal by which he can live out the remainder of his sentence working for the bank fraud department of the FBI, which Frank accepts. While working at the FBI, Frank misses the thrill of the chase and even attempts to fly as an airline pilot again. He is cornered by Carl, who insists that Frank will return to the FBI job since no one is chasing him. On the following Monday, Carl is nervous that Frank has not yet arrived at work. However, Frank eventually arrives and they discuss their next case.|$|E
5|$|This brought wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans to {{the crease}} and exposed the hosts' lower-order. The {{last of the}} {{specialist}} batsmen, Compton nearly departed soon after when he leaned <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> leg-side delivery from Johnson's off spin. He overbalanced and stumbled forwards, and Tallon removed the bails. There were no television replays to assist the umpires in those days, and although the attempted stumping appeared close to the naked eye, {{the benefit of the}} doubt was given to the batsman and the appeal rejected. Compton made use of this and attacked Toshack successfully, forcing Bradman to make a bowling change. In fading light, Compton combined with the gloveman to add 75 runs for the seventh wicket in 70 minutes, before Lindwall removed Evansâ€”who attempted a wild slashâ€”to leave England 216/7. Compton reached stumps on 64, accompanied by Alec Bedser, who was on four, as England ended the day at 231/7. Compton had been dropped one-handed on 50 by Tallon, before being missed on 64 by the wicket-keeper from the bowling of Johnston just before stumps.|$|E
