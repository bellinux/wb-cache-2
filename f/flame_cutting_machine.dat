40|$|Purpose: This paper {{describes}} AGNCP, {{an intelligent}} system for integrating commercial CAD and CAM systems for 2. 5 D milling operations {{at a low}} cost. Design/methodology/approach: It deals with different machining problems {{with the aid of}} two expert systems. It recognizes machining features, determines required <b>machining</b> process plans, <b>cutting</b> tools and parameters necessary for generation of NC programs. Findings: The system deals with different machining problems with the aid of two expert systems. The first communicates with CAD system for recognizing machining features. It is developed in LISP as machining features can be properly represented by LISP codes is ideal for manipulating lists and input data. The second expert system requires extensive communications with several databases for retrieving tooling and machining information and VP-Expert shell was found to be the most suitable package to perform this task. Research limitations/implications: 2. 5 D milling covers a wide range of operations. However, work is in progress cover 3 D milling operations. The system can also be modified to be used for other activities such as turning, <b>flame</b> <b>cutting,</b> electro discharge <b>machining</b> (EDM), punching, etc. Practical implications: Use of AGNCP resulted in improved efficiency, noticeable time savings, and elimination of the need for expert process planners.

40|$|One of the {{predominant}} {{causes of fires}} in underground coal mines is <b>flame</b> <b>cutting</b> and welding. These fires can lead to major {{events such as the}} explosion that occurred on January 22, 2003 in an airshaft being constructed at the McElroy mine. Six contractors were inside the shaft {{at the time of the}} explosion and the explosion fatally injured three and seriously injured three [MSHA 2003]. Understanding the root causes of these fires and explosions will help prevent these types of events from occurring in the future. Fires and explosions require fuel, oxygen and an ignition source (heat). These three items are referred to as a fire triangle. The control of these three items in <b>flame</b> <b>cutting</b> and welding operations is required to prevent fires and or explosions. United States Department of Labor, Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) Reports of Investigation (ROI), MSHA Mine Accident, Injury, and Illness Reports, and the MSHA Mining Industry Accident, Injuries Employment, and Production Data Base were analyzed and interviews and observations with mine workers and welders were conducted to determine the root causes of coal mine fires and explosions caused by <b>flame</b> <b>cutting</b> and welding operations. This paper will discuss the root causes and potential means to reduce the number of fires and resulting fatalities and injuries caused by or due to <b>flame</b> <b>cutting</b> and welding...|$|R

40|$|The {{quality of}} <b>cutting</b> <b>machines</b> is {{affected}} by several factors that can be directly or indirectly influenced by manufacturers, technicians and users of machine tools. The most critical qualitative evaluation parameters of machine tools include accuracy and stability. Investigations of accuracy and repeatable positioning accuracy were essential for the research presented in this paper. The aim was to develop and experimentally verify {{the design of a}} methodology for cutting centers aimed at achieving the desired working precision. Before working on the topic described here, it was necessary to make several scientific analyses, which are summarized in this paper. We can build on the initial working hypothesis that by improving the technological parameters (e. g. by increasing the working speed of the machine, or by improving the precision of the positioning) the quality of the <b>cutting</b> <b>machine</b> will also be improved. For the purposes of our study, several investigated parameters were set affecting positioning accuracy, such as rigidity, positioning speed, etc. First, the stiffness of the portal structure of the <b>cutting</b> <b>machine</b> was analyzed. FEM analysis was used to investigate several alternative structures of the <b>cutting</b> <b>machine,</b> and also an innovative solution for beam mounting. The second step was to integrate two types of drives into the design of the <b>cutting</b> <b>machine.</b> The first drive is a classic rack and pinion drive for <b>cutting</b> <b>machines.</b> To increase (improve) the working speed of the machine, linear motors were designed as an alternative drive. The portal of the <b>cutting</b> <b>machine</b> was designed for a working speed of 260 mmin− 1 and acceleration of 25 m. s− 2. The third step was {{based on the results of}} the analysis. In collaboration with Microstep, an experimental <b>cutting</b> <b>machine</b> in a portal version was produced using linear synchronous motors driving the portal on both sides, and with direct linear metering of its position. In the fourth step, an experiment was designed and conducted to explore the positioning accuracy and the repeatable positioning accuracy...|$|R
