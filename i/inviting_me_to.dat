25|$|Like {{all great}} artists, Licia's {{specific}} ingenuity as a singer, the originality of her art, {{lay in the}} fact that technique for this artist at least was always {{a means to an end}} and never an end in itself: for the salient features of all great art is the ability to connect technique to the emotions. Any other approach would have been for Albanese contrary to the musical sense with which she was born, contrary to musical training she acquired, and, if such exists, contrary to her musical morality. It was this, Licia's uniqueness and musical mastery which drew me, which drew us, into the world of Mimi, Cio-Cio-San, Manon, Liu and Violetta week after week, year after year, <b>inviting</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> a place and places I had never been before. It is for all these reasons that Virgil Thomson was able to write of Licia's first Violetta: 'She did not sing the role, she recreated it for our times.' As we all know, Albanese's art is capable of the widest range of effects from the tragic to the comedic, from dramatic repertoire to the lyrical and even soubrette: and for anyone fortunate enough to have heard her rendition of operetta pieces, she leaves no doubt in the mind that she was born to the operetta form as well as to the rest.|$|E

I {{would like}} to take a moment from this very public {{ceremony}} to speak of something very personal. It concerns a dear friend of mine who is no longer with us. His name is Ryan White. He was a hemophiliac who was diagnosed with the AIDS virus when he was eleven. He died shortly after turning eighteen, the very time most young people are beginning to explore life's wonderful possibilities. My friend Ryan was a very bright, very brave, and very normal young man who never wanted to be a symbol or a spokesperson for a deadly disease. Over the years, I've shared many silly, happy, and painful moments with Ryan and I was with him {{at the end of his}} brief but eventful journey. Ryan is gone and just as anyone who has lost a loved one to AIDS, I miss him deeply and constantly. He is gone, but I want his life to have meaning beyond his passing. It is my hope, President-elect Clinton, that you and your administration commit the resources needed to eliminate this awful disease that took my friend, and ended so many promising lives before their time. This song is for you Ryan". - Michael Jackson, January 1993.|$|E

My journey at CNS started with Paolo Gaudiano in the Neurobotics Laboratory. This provided the gateway to the collaboration with NRL. For this I am greatly indebted.

40|$|Thank you for <b>inviting</b> <b>me</b> here <b>to</b> Sydney {{and thank}} you for giving <b>me</b> the {{opportunity}} <b>to</b> discuss this really interesting paper by Hyun Shin. This paper has a very different tone to those of the rest of this conference. Most papers so far have been concerned with explaining the ‘Great Stability’; the observation that the volatility of inflation and output growth has declined markedly in recent years in most developed economies. Hyun Shin’s paper instead suggests that there may be forces which are tending to make business cycles more unstable. Of course, the notion that asset prices interact with balance sheets to amplify business cycle responses is a familiar one (see, for example, the financial accelerator model of Bernanke, Gertler and Gilchrist 1999). The particular points that Hyun draws our attention to are that, in the context of household balance sheets, it may be dangerous to rely on housing collateral {{at the level of the}} aggregate economy; and that to the extent that housing collateral works via the bank capital channel, the increasing tendency for banks to mark their assets to market may accentuate these effects. And this may lead to significant non-linearities if it is more costly fo...|$|R
40|$|Mr. Chairman, Mr. Weller, and {{distinguished}} {{members of the}} subcommittee, thank you for <b>inviting</b> <b>me</b> here <b>to</b> discuss the status and prospects of low-wage workers in the United States. The views I express are mine alone {{and should not be}} attributed to the Urban Institute, its trustees, or its funders. I will begin by describing the size and characteristics of the low-wage workforce and the jobs low-wage workers hold. Then, I will discuss the prospects for wage growth and upward mobility. Finally, I will say a few words about the policies and programs that help support low-wage workers and their families. There is no official definition or consensus on how little a worker must earn to be considered low-wage or how much time he or she must put in on the job to be considered a worker. As such, you will find a number of different definitions of “low-wage worker” in the literature. For example, some researchers set the low-wage line relative to the federal minimum wage—Acs and Nichols (2007) use 150 percent of the federal minimum wage as their cutoff. Others compute the low-wage line in terms of how much it would take to keep a family of four out of poverty if a worker worked full time, yea...|$|R

And what an exciting project it is!!! I am so thrilled and honored {{to be part of}} this. Before I begin, I want to be clear about what I mean by prevention and what I am encouraging us to prevent. Prevention, <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> means stopping something before it happens. In this case, prevention means stopping sexist violence before it is done. I’m talking this morning about sexist violence by which I mean: sexual assault and domestic violence, as well as pornography, prostitution, trafficking, and stalking. All of these forms of violence and abuse are inter-related and part of prevention, {{if we are going to}} be successful at all, means taking action to prevent all of them. I’m going to begin by talking about prevention efforts as one aspect of educational efforts, then I’ll speak to how I see prevention as education, and education as a whole, as fitting into community organizing and community development. Because I am going to address these two broad items, what I am going to offer is an overview rather than a description. Prevention as Education Education has three inter-related aspects. Most of the time, however, these three distinc...|$|R
