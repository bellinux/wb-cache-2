25|$|Series result: a 1–0 win to Sri Lanka. Mahela Jayawardene raised points {{similar to}} what he said after the Colombo test, saying England’s {{approach}} was too negative. Whilst his criticism was perhaps unjustified in the second test, it certainly wasn’t here. England did appear to <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>up</b> during day 2, and this possibly acted as a catalyst for the poor batting performance that followed.|$|E
25|$|Whilst a success, {{this result}} {{was greeted with}} dismay by the corps commander, the Earl of Cavan; he was a believer in a more {{traditional}} strongly held static line of defence and felt that Fanshawe {{did not need to}} <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>up</b> any ground at all.

His finances fared poorly in the Great Depression, which was part of the reason he worked into his 80s. Most likely, he would have worked even longer if the state had not adopted a mandatory retirement law for government employees over 70.|$|E

25|$|Television showing skaters in {{the kiss}} and cry area after {{competing}} {{contributed to the}} sport's popularity. Television {{also played a role}} in removing the restrictive amateur status rules that once governed the sport. In May 1990, the International Skating Union voted to allow skaters who were intending to skate professionally to return to ISU competition if they obtained their national association's permission. To retain skaters who might otherwise <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>up</b> their eligibility to participate in lucrative professional events, in 1995 the ISU introduced prize money at its major competitions, funded by revenues from selling the TV rights to those events.|$|E

Around 1200 there is a list of the names of men living in the area of Peebles. Amongst them are Cumbric names such as Gospatrick: servant or follower of Saint Patrick, Gosmungo: servant of Saint Mungo, Guososwald: servant of Oswald of Northumbria and Goscubrycht: servant of Cuthbert. Two of the saints– Oswald and Cuthbert— are from Northumbria showing influence on Cumbric not found in Welsh.|$|E

25|$|In 1962, {{homosexual}} behaviour was decriminalised in Czechoslovakia, {{following a}} scientific research of Kurt Freund that included phallometry of homosexually oriented men {{who appeared to}} <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>up</b> sexual relations with other men and established heterosexual marriages. Freund {{came to the conclusion}} that homosexual orientation may not be changed. The claim that phallometry on men was the reason for decriminalization of homosexual behavior in Czechoslovakia is contradicted by the fact that it applied to women as well, as the notion of a male-specific fixity of sexual orientation as an argument for gay rights combined with the notion of female sexual plasticity is adverse to lesbian rights.|$|E
25|$|His {{appointment}} was opposed by one Robert Crichton. Crichton was {{the nephew of}} George Crichton, Bishop of Dunkeld, and had been appointed coadjutor and successor to his uncle {{the year before the}} latter's death - without the consent of the Scottish government. The government thus ignored the appointment, placing Hamilton in charge. Robert litigated - unsuccessfully - against Hamilton in the Papal see. When Hamilton was translated, Crichton was still litigating. The dispute continued into 1553. When Mary of Guise took over the government from Châtellerault in 1554, she acknowledged Crichton's position and Campbell appears to <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>up</b> the bishopric. In this year, perhaps in compensation, he was made Keeper of the Privy Seal, a position he held until his death in 1562.|$|E
25|$|Numerous {{stories are}} {{associated}} with the time preceding her death. The elderly Sister Bourgeoys was said to <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>up</b> her life to God in order to save that of a younger member of the Congregation who had fallen ill. After intense prayer, it is said that the young nun was cured and Marguerite fell terribly ill, dying soon thereafter. Her appeal continued after her death, as she was well known and highly regarded. The convent held an afternoon visitation open to the public; people treasured objects that they touched to her hands at this time, which became considered spiritual relics. Her body was kept by the parish of Ville-Marie, but her heart was removed and preserved as a relic by the Congregation.|$|E

25|$|By the 13th century BCE {{all of the}} Hurrian {{states had}} been vanquished by other peoples, with the Mitanni kingdom {{destroyed}} by Assyria. The heartlands of the Hurrians, the Khabur river valley and south eastern Anatolia, became provinces of the Middle Assyrian Empire (1366 - 1020 BCE) which came to rule much of the Near East and Asia Minor. It {{is not clear what}} happened to these early Hurrian people {{at the end of the}} Bronze Age. Some scholars have suggested that Hurrians lived on in the country of Nairi north of Assyria during the early Iron Age, before this too was conquered by Assyria. The Hurrian population of northern Syria in the following centuries seems to <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>up</b> their language in favor of the Assyrian dialect of Akkadian, and later, Aramaic.|$|E

President Juscelino Kubitschek (1956–61), who designed and built the capital Brasília, was another supporter of highways. Kubitschek {{was responsible for the}} installation of major car manufacturers in the country (Volkswagen, Ford and General Motors arrived in Brazil during his rule) and one of the points used to attract them was, of course, support for the construction of highways. With the implementation of Fiat in 1976 ending an automobile market closed loop, {{from the end of the}} 1990s the country has received large foreign direct {{investments in}}stalling in its territory other major car manufacturers and utilities, such as Iveco, Renault, Peugeot, Citroen, Honda, Mitsubishi, Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Hyundai, Toyota among others. Brazil is the seventh most important country in the auto industry.|$|E
25|$|Ariston {{appears to}} have died in Plato's childhood, {{although}} the precise dating of his death is difficult. When Ariston died, Athenian law forbade the legal independence of women, and, therefore Perictione was given to marriage to Pyrilampes, her mother's brother (Plato himself calls him the uncle of Charmides), who had served many times as an ambassador to the Persian court and {{was a friend of}} Pericles, the leader of the democratic faction in Athens. Pyrilampes had a son from a previous marriage, Demos, who was famous for his beauty. Perictione gave birth to Pyrilampes' second son, Antiphon, the half-brother of Plato, who appears in Parmenides, where he is said to <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>up</b> philosophy, in order to devote most of his time to horses. Thus Plato was reared in a household of at least six children, where he was number five: a stepbrother, a sister, two brothers and a half-brother.|$|E
