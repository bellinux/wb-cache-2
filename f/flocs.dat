2500|$|Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{is used in}} brewing beer, when it is {{sometimes}} called a top-fermenting or top-cropping yeast. It is so called because during the fermentation process its hydrophobic surface causes the <b>flocs</b> to adhere to CO2 and {{rise to the top}} of the fermentation vessel. Top-fermenting yeasts are fermented at higher temperatures than the lager yeast Saccharomyces pastorianus, and the resulting beers have a different flavor than the same beverage fermented with a lager yeast.

40|$|Physical and {{chemical}} characteristics of activated sludge such as <b>floc</b> size, density, specific surface, carbohydrate content, dehydrogenase activity and settleability were investigated by seven parallel bench scale activated sludge units operated under different sludge ages (1. 1 - 17. 4 days). The analytical methods used included a dye adsorption technique for specific surface area determinations, the Coulter Counter method for <b>floc</b> size measurements and interference microscopy for <b>floc</b> density determinations. The typical <b>floc</b> sizes {{were found to}} be in the range 10 - 70 mum with <b>floc</b> densities in the range 1. 015 - 1. 034 g cm- 3. A strong correlation between <b>floc</b> density and size was obtained.

40|$|This study {{compared}} the <b>floc</b> and sludge formed during the coagulation of leachate by {{different types of}} coagulants. The coagulants tested {{in this study were}} Ferric chloride (FC), pre-hydrolyzed iron (PHI), dual coagulant (PHI+TF(tapioca flour)), and composite coagulant (pre mix of PHI and TF (PHITF)). The <b>floc</b> and sludge were characterized by measuring the sludge volume index (SVI), sludge velocity (SV), and <b>floc</b> size.

40|$|A laboratory-scale reactor {{was used}} to {{simulate}} a water treatment process sequence of rapid mix, hydraulic flocculation, upflow clarification with a <b>floc</b> blanket, and lamellar sedimentation to accomplish removal of colloidal particles. This process sequence, followed by chlorination, has been employed to create affordable designs for water treatment in the Global South. This study focused on variables affecting performance of the <b>floc</b> blanket including: condition of hydraulic flocculation, raw water turbidity, coagulant dose, upflow velocity through the <b>floc</b> blanket, <b>floc</b> blanket height, and bulk density and solids concentration of the <b>floc</b> blanket. An upflow clarifier velocity between 90 - 110 m/day produced the best <b>floc</b> blanket performance for most influent turbidities studied. The results show that particle removal efficiency in lamellar sedimentation improved linearly with respect to <b>floc</b> blanket heights up to 45 cm. Improved performance is also correlated with increased hydraulic flocculator residence time and energy dissipation rate. At <b>floc</b> blanket heights above 45 cm, there is still improvement in performance for most cases, but improved performance and blanket height no longer follow a linear relationship. Lamellar sedimentation with a capture velocity of 10 m/day is a key component in improving clarifier performance when utilizing a <b>floc</b> blanket. Future {{studies are needed to}} determine mechanisms of particle removal in a <b>floc</b> blanket. ii...|$|R
40|$|Flocculent {{material}} (<b>floc)</b> is {{an important}} energy source in wetlands. In the Florida Everglades, <b>floc</b> is present in both freshwater marshes and coastal environments and {{plays a key role}} in food webs and nutrient cycling. However, not much is known about its environmental dynamics, in particular its biological sources and bio-reactivity. We analysed <b>floc</b> samples collected from different environments in the Florida Everglades and applied biomarkers and pigment chemotaxonomy to identify spatial and seasonal differences in organic matter sources. An attempt was made to link <b>floc</b> composition with algal and plant productivity. Spatial differences were observed between freshwater marsh and estuarine <b>floc.</b> Freshwater <b>floc</b> receives organic matter inputs from local periphyton mats, as indicated by microbial biomarkers and chlorophyll-a estimates. At the estuarine sites, the <b>floc</b> is dominated by mangrove as well as diatom inputs from the marine end-member. The hydroperiod (duration and depth of inundation) at the freshwater sites influences <b>floc</b> organic matter preservation, where the <b>floc</b> at the short-hydroperiod site is more oxidised likely due to periodic dry-down conditions. Seasonal differences in <b>floc</b> composition were not consistent and the few that were observed are likely linked to the primary productivity of the dominant biomass (periphyton in the freshwater marshes and mangroves in the estuarine zone). Molecular evidence for hydrological transport of <b>floc</b> material from the freshwater marshes to the coastal fringe was also observed. With the on-going restoration of the Florida Everglades, it is important to gain a better understanding of the biogeochemical dynamics of <b>floc,</b> including its sources, transformations and reactivity...|$|R

50|$|In the brewing {{industry}} flocculation {{has a different}} meaning. It {{is a very important}} process in fermentation during the production of beer where cells form macroscopic <b>flocs.</b> These <b>flocs</b> cause the yeast to sediment or rise {{to the top of a}} fermentation at the end of the fermentation. Subsequently, the yeast can be collected (cropped) from the top (ale fermentation) or the bottom (lager fermentation) of the fermenter in order to be reused for the next fermentation. While it appears similar to sedimentation in colloidal dispersions, the mechanisms are different.|$|E

40|$|On {{the basis}} of {{experiments}} carried out using an image analysis system and static zone settlement, the alum sludge <b>floc</b> structure and the <b>floc</b> packing status with varied polymer dosages were examined in greater detail to reveal the link with the settling behaviour manifested in the “CML 30 method”. The results of image analysis lead {{to the findings of}} the <b>floc</b> size with a pattern in initially great increase with low polymer dose and finally a plateau being reached at higher amount of polymer addition. Meanwhile, a polymer dosage in the range of 2. 0 – 20. 0 mg/l (for sludge SS = 4, 595 mg/l) can result in the increase of the <b>floc</b> fractal dimension (DF) up to an average value of 1. 72 (raw sludge DF being 1. 06), indicating greater compactness of the <b>floc</b> solids. These <b>floc</b> features control the settling behaviour of the “CML 30 method”, especially in small polymer dosages. However, in large polymer doses, the controlling factor is derived from the <b>floc</b> 2 ̆ 7 packing 2 ̆ 7 status (referring to the inter – <b>floc</b> contact manner). This 2 ̆ 7 packing 2 ̆ 7 status may associate with viscosity of settling medium (supernatant) and the excess polymer in bulk solution.

25|$|Activated sludge is {{a common}} suspended-growth method of {{secondary}} treatment. Activated sludge plants encompass a variety of mechanisms and processes using dissolved oxygen to promote growth of biological <b>floc</b> that substantially removes organic material. Biological <b>floc</b> is an ecosystem of living biota subsisting on nutrients from the inflowing primary clarifier effluent. These mostly carbonaceous dissolved solids undergo aeration to be broken down and either biologically oxidized to carbon dioxide or converted to additional biological <b>floc</b> of reproducing micro-organisms. Nitrogenous dissolved solids (amino acids, ammonia, etc.) are similarly converted to biological <b>floc</b> or oxidized by the <b>floc</b> to nitrites, nitrates, and, in some processes, to nitrogen gas through denitrification. While denitrification is encouraged in some treatment processes, denitrification often impairs the settling of the <b>floc</b> causing poor quality effluent in many suspended aeration plants. Overflow from the activated sludge mixing chamber is sent to a secondary clarifier where the suspended biological <b>floc</b> settles out while the treated water moves into tertiary treatment or disinfection. Settled <b>floc</b> is returned to the mixing basin to continue growing in primary effluent. Like most ecosystems, population changes among activated sludge biota can reduce treatment efficiency. Nocardia, a floating brown foam sometimes misidentified as sewage fungus, is {{the best known of}} many different fungi and protists that can overpopulate the <b>floc</b> and cause process upsets. Elevated concentrations of toxic wastes including pesticides, industrial metal plating waste, or extreme pH, can kill the biota of an activated sludge reactor ecosystem.|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of chemical conditioning with three representative inorganic coagulants (FeCl 3, polyaluminum chloride (PACl) and high performance PACl (HPAC) on sludge dewaterability. We monitored the particle size, kinetic viscosity (KV), fractal dimension (D-F) and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) located in different layers of sludge <b>floc</b> (soluble, loosely-bound (LB), tightly-bound (TB)) to understand the correlation of dewaterability and physicochemical properties of sludge under chemical conditioning. The conditioning process included the rapid aggregation of sludge particles induced by charge neutralization and bridging followed by <b>floc</b> densification caused by double electric layer compression. The <b>floc</b> size and D-F were increased after chemical conditioning, indicating that larger and more compact <b>floc</b> formed.
