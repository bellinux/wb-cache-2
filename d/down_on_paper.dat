5|$|Paper Trail is {{the sixth}} studio album by American hip hop {{recording}} artist T.I., released September 30, 2008, on Grand Hustle Records and Atlantic Records. He {{began to write}} songs for the album as he awaited trial for federal weapons and possession charges. Unlike his past albums, he wrote his lyrics <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>paper,</b> which he had not done since his debut album, I'm Serious (2001).|$|E
5|$|As a precautionary move Alboin {{strengthened}} his {{alliance with}} the Avars, signing what Paul calls a foedus perpetuum ("perpetual treaty") and what is {{referred to in the}} 9th-century Historia Langobardorum codicis Gothani as a pactum et foedus amicitiae ("pact and treaty of friendship"), adding that the treaty was put <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>paper.</b> By the conditions accepted in the treaty, the Avars were to take possession of Pannonia and the Lombards were promised military support in Italy should the need arise; also, for a period of 200years the Lombards were to maintain the right to reclaim their former territories if the plan to conquer Italy failed, thus leaving Alboin with an alternative open. The accord also had the advantage of protecting Alboin's rear, as an Avar-occupied Pannonia would make it difficult for the Byzantines to bring forces to Italy by land. The agreement proved immensely successful, and relations with the Avars were almost uninterruptedly friendly during the lifetime of the Lombard Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Chelvanayakam was re-elected in the 1965 {{parliamentary}} election {{which resulted in}} a hung parliament. After the election Chelvanayakam met with UNP leader Dudley Senanayake who agreed to Chelvanayakam's conditions for supporting a UNP led government. The agreement, known as the Dudley-Chelvanayakam Pact (D-C Pact), was put <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>paper</b> and signed by Chelvanayakam and Senanayake on 24 March 1965. Under the Dudley-Chelvanayakam Pact, which was {{a modified version of the}} B-C pact, Senanayake agreed to make Tamil the language of administration and of record in the Northern and Eastern provinces (Tamil Language Special Provisions Act); amend the Languages of Courts Act to allow legal proceedings in the Northern and Eastern provinces to be conducted and recorded in Tamil; establish District Councils vested with powers over mutually agreed subjects; amend the Land Development Ordinance to provide allotment of land to citizens; and grant land under colonization schemes in the Northern and Eastern provinces to landless people in the district, to Tamil-speaking residents from the two provinces, and to other citizens with preference being given to Tamils from other provinces. Senanayake kept the contents of the D-C Pact a secret which allowed Sinhalese nationalists to allege that he had agreed to the division of the country. Even the leftist Lanka Sama Samaja Party and Communist Party of Ceylon joined the Sinhala nationalist SLFP in propagating this claim.|$|E

5|$|No Lifeguard on Duty: The Accidental Life of the World's First Supermodel is an {{autobiography}} by fashion model, photographer, author and talent agent Janice Dickinson. It {{was published in}} hardcover format in 2002 by ReganBooks, an imprint of HarperCollins. The author's friend make-up artist Way Bandy advised her to begin putting her past experiences <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>paper</b> {{as a form of}} therapy from prior trauma in her life. After gaining sobriety, she started compiling her notes into book format. She contacted book publisher Judith Regan who agreed to help her publish her book after hearing her tale on the phone, without first seeing a writing sample. In November 2014, Dickinson asserted in an interview with Entertainment Tonight that pressure from Bill Cosby and his lawyers resulted in the removal of an account of sexual assault and rape by Cosby when she visited him at a hotel in Lake Tahoe, California in 1982. After Cosby's attorney disputed this account, she reappeared on the program to proclaim she was telling the truth and explained she was speaking out publicly because of a need to be heard and to represent other women who stated they experienced a similar trauma.|$|E
25|$|Written transcriptions of rhythms {{tend to be}} imprecise. Usually {{only the}} basic idea of the rhythm is {{transcribed}} but the real feeling that it carries can't be easily put <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>paper.</b> This {{is due to the}} nature of the West African music—the different types of swing (at least four of them) that are not easily expressible with western notation. For this reason the written material for advanced players is still scarce if not unavailable, while the general and informational literature are readily obtained.|$|E
500|$|Most of the songs' lyrics {{were not}} written <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>paper,</b> as Timberlake {{believed}} {{it would only}} slow him down. For most of the album's production, Timberlake composed the lyrics {{in his head and}} would record the song shortly after. Some songs were conceptualized within a relatively shorter time, while others took longer because Timberlake had wanted to incorporate variation. For instance, the lyrics to [...] "Losing My Way" [...] were in a narrative style which took Timberlake longer to write. The only song that Timberlake wrote <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>paper</b> was the Rick Rubin-produced [...] "(Another Song) All Over Again". Rubin felt it was unusual for Timberlake because he requested the latter to write the lyrics first instead of recording it directly in the vocal booth.|$|E

500|$|Lateef of Latyrx {{notes that}} Wallace had, [...] "intense and complex flows", Fredro Starr of Onyx says, [...] "Biggie {{was a master}} of the flow", and Bishop Lamont states that Wallace {{mastered}} [...] "all the hemispheres of the music". [...] "Notorious B.I.G. also often used the single-line rhyme scheme to add variety and interest to his flow". Big Daddy Kane suggests that Wallace didn't need a large vocabulary to impress listeners – [...] "he just put his words together a slick way and it worked real good for him". Wallace was known to compose lyrics in his head, rather than write them <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>paper,</b> in a similar way to Jay-Z.|$|E
500|$|His work {{is filled}} with pop {{cultural}} references to both film [...] and music, as well as politics. Orson Welles' Touch of Evil and John Ford's The Searchers are mentioned prominently {{in more than one}} of his books, and Roxy Music is referenced in virtually every novel he wrote. The imagery in his novels is largely cinematic, with expressions such as [...] "fade in/fade out", [...] "quick cut" [...] and [...] "VistaVision"; and sentences such as [...] "a montage traces the next fifteen years" [...] and [...] "If the last reel of Cheryl's life had been a CinemaScope Technicolor movie...".

500|$|The Songlines {{features}} a narrator named Bruce whose biography is {{almost identical to}} Chatwin's. The narrator spends time in Australia trying to learn about Aboriginal culture, specifically the songlines. As the book goes on, it becomes a reflection on what Chatwin stated was [...] "for me, the question of questions: {{the nature of human}} restlessness." [...] Chatwin also hinted at his preoccupation over his own mortality in the text: [...] "I had a presentiment that the 'travelling' phase of my life might be passing... I should set <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>paper</b> a resume of the ideas, quotations, and encounters that amused me and obsessed me..." [...] Following this statement in The Songlines Chatwin included extensive excerpts from his moleskine notebooks.|$|E
500|$|The {{speed and}} {{facility}} with which Dylan wrote topical songs {{attracted the attention}} of other musicians in the New York folk scene. In a radio interview on WBAI in June 1962, Pete Seeger described Dylan as [...] "the most prolific songwriter on the scene" [...] and then asked Dylan how many songs he had written recently. Dylan replied, [...] "I might go for two weeks without writing these songs. I write a lot of stuff. In fact, I wrote five songs last night but I gave all the papers away in some place called the Bitter End." [...] Dylan also expressed the impersonal idea that the songs were not his own creation. In an interview with Sing Out! magazine, Dylan said, [...] "The songs are there. They exist all by themselves just waiting for someone to write them down. I just put them <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>paper.</b> If I didn't do it, somebody else would." ...|$|E
500|$|Walpole {{remained}} prolific in {{the post-war}} years, {{and began a}} parallel and highly remunerative career as a lecturer in literature. At the instigation of his American publisher, George Doran, {{he made his first}} lecture tour of the US in 1919, receiving an enthusiastic welcome wherever he went. What Sadleir describes as Walpole's [...] "genial and attractive appearance, his complete lack of aloofness, his exciting fluency as a speaker [...] his obvious and genuine liking for his hosts" [...] combined to win him a large American following. The success of his talks led to increases in his lecturing fees, greatly enhanced sales of his books, and large sums from American publishers anxious to print his latest fiction. He was a prodigiously quick writer who seldom revised, but pressed on, keen to get his ideas <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>paper.</b> His main British publishers, Macmillan, found it expedient to appoint a senior member of staff to edit his manuscripts, correcting spelling, punctuation, inconsistencies and errors of historical fact. His fluency enabled him to fulfil between tours a contract from The Pictorial Review for ten short stories at the remarkable sum of $1,350 apiece.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, user {{authentication}} {{is one of}} the important topics in information security. Text-based strong password schemes could provide with certain degree of security. However, the fact that strong passwords being difficult to memorize often leads their owners to write them <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>papers</b> or even save them in a computer file. Graphical Password or Graphical {{user authentication}} (GUA) has been proposed as a possible alternative solution to text-based authentication, motivated particularly by the fact that humans can remember images better than text. All of Graphical Password algorithms have two different aspects which are usability and security. This <b>paper</b> focuses <b>on</b> security aspects of algorithms that most of researchers work on this part and try to define security features and attributes. Unfortunately, till now there isn’t a complete evaluation criterion for graphical password security. At first, this paper tries to study on most of GUA algorithm.

500|$|A {{common problem}} with the scripts, {{according}} to Novak, is {{that they tend to}} run too long for the regular 22-minute time slot, leading to several cuts. For example, the script for the episode [...] "Search Committee" [...] was initially 75 pages—10 pages too long. A complete script is written for each episode; however, actors are given opportunities to improvise during the shooting process. Fischer said, [...] "Our shows are 100 percent scripted. They put everything <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>paper.</b> But we get to play around a little bit, too. Steve and Rainn are brilliant improvisers." [...] This leads to a large number of deleted scenes with almost every episode of The Office, all of which are considered part of the show's canon and storyline by Daniels. Deleted scenes have sometimes been restored in repeats to make episodes longer or draw back people who have seen the episode before to see the bonus footage. In an experiment, a deleted scene from [...] "The Return" [...] was made available over NBC.com and iTunes, explaining the absence of a character over the next several episodes. Daniels hoped that word of mouth among fans would spread the information, but eventually considered the experiment a failure.|$|E

2500|$|Students at Bates take {{a first-year}} seminar, which {{provides}} a template {{for the rest of}} the four years at Bates. The student selects a specific topic offered by the college, and works together in a small class with a scholar-in-field professor of that topic, to study and critically analyze the subject. All first-year seminars place importance on writing ability, and composition in order to facilitate the process of complex and fluid ideas being put <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>paper.</b> Seminars range from constitutional analysis to mathematical theorizing. After three complete years at Bates, each student participates in a senior thesis or capstone that demonstrates expertise and overall knowledge of the Major, Minor or General Education Concentrations (GECs). The Senior Thesis is an intensive program that begins with the skills taught in the first-year program and concludes with a compiled thesis that stresses research and innovation. A feature of a Bates education is the Honors Program which includes a tutorial-based thesis modeled after the universities of Oxford and [...] Cambridge. The program consists of a senior thesis that is defended against a faculty panel. A faculty member must nominate the student for thesis candidacy by the conclusion of their junior year. Under the guidance of the nominating faculty member, the student declares his or her thesis(s) at the start of senior year and concludes it before his or her graduation. The thesis is subject to an oral examination, which is loosely based on defending a dissertation or oral argumentation. The oral examination committee includes a member of the faculty from a different department, and an examiner who specializes in the field of study the student is defending and is usually from another institution.|$|E
