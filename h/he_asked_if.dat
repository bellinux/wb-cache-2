5|$|A {{controversy}} that has occupied scholars {{for more than}} a century concerns whether Cabral's discovery was by chance or intentional. If the latter, that would mean that the Portuguese had at least some hint that a land existed to the west. The matter was first raised by Emperor Pedro II in 1854 during a session of the Brazilian Historic and Geographic Institute, when <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> the discovery might have been intentional.|$|E
5|$|Colonel Harvey's {{account of}} the smoke-filled room had Harding being sent for {{in the early morning}} hours, to be {{informed}} by Harvey that the Ohioan would be the candidate. Harvey stated <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> there was anything in Harding's background that might harm his candidacy, to which the senator, who had had at least one extramarital affair, replied there was not. Harding biographer Charles W. Murray noted that there is no evidence besides Harvey's word that Harding went to the Hays suite that night, and that other participants denied that Harding was there. Harding was so uncertain of victory that he filed for re-election to the Senate, though Daugherty continued to urge delegates to support him.|$|E
5|$|Having {{lived in}} Queensland {{most of his}} life, Irwin was also a fan of rugby league. As a teenager, he played for the Caloundra Sharks as a second-rower, and as an adult {{he was known to}} be a passionate Brisbane Broncos fan and was {{involved}} with the club on several occasions. On one occasion after turning up to training <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> he could tackle the largest player, Shane Webcke. Despite being thrown to the ground and looking like he'd been crushed he was jovial about the experience. Irwin laughingly shared the experience with the Queensland State of Origin squad before the 2006 series. Irwin also supported rugby union, being a fan of the national team, the Wallabies. He once wore a Wallaby jersey during a demonstration at the zoo. A behind-the-scenes episode of The Crocodile Hunter showed Irwin and the crew finding a petrol station in a remote part of Namibia to watch the Wallabies defeat France in the 1999 Rugby World Cup Final. Irwin was also a talented surfer.|$|E

5|$|Vice-President Millard Fillmore {{ascended to}} the {{presidency}} upon Taylor's death and offered Crittenden the post of Attorney General. Believing the rift in the Whig Party was now much improved, he accepted the offer and resigned the governorship in 1850. Fillmore, an opponent of slavery, requested an opinion from Crittenden on {{the constitutionality of the}} fugitive slave law, one of the bills involved in the Compromise of 1850. Specifically, <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> the law suspended the writ of habeas corpus. Crittenden said that it did not, opining that it discharged a duty placed on Congress by the Constitution to return runaway slaves. Crittenden's opinion was probably motivated by a desire to see the Compromise pass and avert further sectional tension. Fillmore, his misgivings assuaged, signed the bill, keeping the Compromise intact.|$|E
5|$|Spreckels {{was already}} in {{correspondence}} with American authorities; in January 1883, the Director of the United States Mint, Horatio Burchard, had written to him explaining the laws under which the Mint could strike coins for foreign governments, and that although the coins could be struck at the San Francisco Mint, the dies for the coinage {{would have to be}} prepared at Philadelphia. He asked for sketches from Spreckels, who provided an obverse showing a full-face portrait of the king; this was submitted to Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber in Philadelphia, who rejected it as impractical. Barber recommended the king be shown in profile, and a suitable photograph was sent to him for use in preparing models of the proposed coins. Once the Mint received Spreckels' commission as agent, Acting Director Robert E. Preston wrote noting that the authorization called for 12 cent pieces, but that the Hawaiian law had called for coins identical in size, weight, and fineness to US coins, and there was no such denomination struck by the US Mint. <b>He</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> ten-cent pieces were desired instead, but no answer was immediately forthcoming, and Barber finished preliminary designs, including the 12 cent piece.|$|E

25|$|At about 3:00p.m., {{shortly after}} forcing {{a group of}} police {{officers}} to take cover in a ditch, Bryant rang the local police station. The wife {{of one of the}} police officers answered the phone. Bryant asked who she was and if she knew where her husband was. He again called himself Jamie. <b>He</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> she knew whether or not her husband was okay, and when she did not answer, Bryant then told her he was okay and that he knew where her husband was.|$|E
25|$|Despite his sacking Taylor {{remained}} {{friendly with}} the band and <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> he could come to Paris too. He dressed up for the sound check in his trademark black leather stage gear, and added a {{chain around his neck}} with a Joan of Arc medallion, which he had bought on arrival at Calais. One version of the story says he gave such an extraordinary performance at the sound check, that the organizers decided to put Taylor {{at the top of the}} bill for both shows. As a result of his performance at those two shows, Eddie Barclay signed him to a six-year record deal on the Barclay label.|$|E

25|$|He {{travelled}} {{past the}} Port Arthur historic site toward a Palmer's Lookout Road property {{owned by the}} Martins, where he came across Roger Larner driving out of his driveway. Larner had met him on some occasions more than 15 years before, but did not initially recognise him. Bryant told Larner he had been surfing and had bought a property called Fogg Lodge and was now looking to buy some cattle from Larner. Bryant also made several comments about buying the Martins' place next door. <b>He</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> Marian Larner was home, {{and asked if he}} could continue down the driveway of the farm to see her. Larner said OK, but told Bryant he would come also. Bryant changed his mind and left, claiming he was going to return in the afternoon.|$|E
25|$|Jerry Atkins, Booker's band leader, had {{arranged}} with the girl's parents {{to take her}} to and from the dances, taking turns with bandmate Ernie Holcomb. It was Holcomb's turn that night, but he said Booker told him that she had a ride with an old friend. Atkins was awakened the next morning at 6:00 with a telephone call. It was a female asking if he knew where Booker was. He had no knowledge of Booker's change of plans and told the caller that Holcomb took her home, but he was informed she had been expected at a party but never came. Atkins received a similar call around 8:00 from another girl, and <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> she had checked with Booker's parents. This girl told him that Booker had gone with a friend named Paul but neither had attended the party.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{previous}} Chogye Trichen Rinpoches, Khyenrab Choje (1436–97), beheld the sustained vision of the female tantric deity Vajrayogini at Drak Yewa in central Tibet, and received extensive teachings and initiations directly from her. Two forms of Vajrayogini appeared out of {{the face of the}} rocks at Drak Yewa, one red in color and the other white, and they bestowed the Kālacakra initiation on Khyenrab Choje. When <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> there was any proof of this, his attendant showed the master the kusha grass that Khyenrab Choje brought back with him from the initiation. It was unlike any kusha grass found in this world, with rainbow lights sparkling up and {{down the length of the}} dried blades of grass. This direct lineage from Vajrayogini is the 'shortest', the most recent and direct, lineage of the Kālacakra empowerment and teachings that exists in this world. In addition to being known as the emanation of Manjushri, Khyenrab Choje had previously been born as many of the Kings of Shambhala as well as numerous Buddhist masters of India. These are some indications of his unique relationship to the Kālacakra tradition.|$|E

25|$|Dahmer then brandished a {{knife and}} {{informed}} Edwards he intended to take nude pictures of him. In an attempt to appease Dahmer, Edwards unbuttoned his shirt, saying he {{would allow him to}} do so if he would remove the handcuffs and put the knife away. In response to this promise, Dahmer simply turned his attention towards the TV; Edwards observed Dahmer rocking back and forth and chanting before turning his attention back to him: he placed his head on Edwards' chest, listened to his heartbeat and, with the knife pressed against his intended victim, informed Edwards he intended to eat his heart. In continuous attempts to prevent Dahmer from attacking him, Edwards repeated that he was Dahmer's friend and {{that he was not going}} to run away. (Edwards had decided he was going to either jump from a window or run through the unlocked front door upon the next available opportunity.) When Edwards next stated he needed to use the bathroom, <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> they could sit with a beer in the living room, where there was air conditioning, to which Dahmer consented, and the pair walked to the living room when Edwards exited the bathroom. Inside the living room, Edwards waited until he observed Dahmer have a momentary lapse of concentration before requesting to use the bathroom again. When Edwards rose from the couch, he noted Dahmer was not holding the handcuffs, whereupon Edwards punched him in the face, knocking Dahmer off balance, and ran out the front door.|$|E

A few days later, the duo cancelled the remainder of their 2007 UK tour dates as well.|$|E
500|$|After Mrs Lycett Green had {{finished}} her testimony {{on the fifth}} day, her place was taken by Mrs Wilson. On examination by Russell, Mrs Wilson stated that she thought she saw Gordon-Cumming cheat twice by adding additional counters to his stake. When Clarke cross-examined her, <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> anyone had placed a stake of £15. Mrs Wilson stated that only her husband had placed such an amount, but Wilson had not played on either night as he disliked both the game and high-stakes gambling. Havers, Grayson and Shankland consider it [...] "rather shocking really, considering that she had sworn to tell the truth,... to find her coming out with this... lie spoken, apparently, with the complete self-assurance that {{the other members of}} her family had shown".|$|E

Truman assumed President Roosevelt wanted to meet with him, but Eleanor Roosevelt informed him her husband had died after suffering a massive cerebral hemorrhage. Truman's first concern was for Mrs. Roosevelt. <b>He</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> there was anything he could do for her, to which she replied, [...] "Is there anything we can do for you?

Compton replied that he could. He joined the Manhattan Project's Metallurgical Laboratory, and helped build the first nuclear reactor, the Chicago Pile-1. Graves, Harold V. Lichtenberger and Warren Nyer formed Enrico Fermi's [...] "suicide squad" [...] or [...] "liquid-control squad", assigned to smash [...] glass bottles containing a solution of cadmium sulfate over the reactor with hammers if something went wrong.

A month before publication, after a final review of the proofs, <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> it would be possible to re-title it Trimalchio or Gold-Hatted Gatsby but Perkins advised against it. On March 19, 1925, on March 19: 'CRAZY ABOUT TITLE UNDER THE RED WHITE AND BLUE STOP [...] WOULD DELAY BE'}} Fitzgerald expressed intense enthusiasm for the title Under the Red, White and Blue, but it was at that stage too late to change.
