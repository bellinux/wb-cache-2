Militants were reported to have appointed fellow Ba'ath generals Azhar al-Obeidi and Ahmed Abdul Rashid as the governors of Mosul and Tikrit. Shortly afterwards, reports emerged that the Ba'ath Party, under al-Douri's leadership, declared war on ISIS in response to the displacement of Christians from Mosul.

[...] Representatives from the State Department, the Defense Department, and the CIA were assigned larger roles in implementing the operation's activities, while representatives from the US Information Agency and the Department of Justice were also called on occasionally to assist with the operation. As the operation's leader, Brigadier General Lansdale received briefings and updates from these agencies and reported directly to a group of high-ranking government officials, known as Special Group-Augmented (SG-A). [...] Under Eisenhower, four major forms of action were to be taken to aid anti communist opposition in Cuba at the time. [...] These were to: (1) provide a powerful propaganda offensive against the regime, (2) perfect a covert intelligence network within Cuba, (3)develop paramilitary forces outside of Cuba and (4) get the necessary logistical support for covert military operations on the island. At this stage it was still not clear that these efforts would end up leading to the Bay of Pigs at the time.|$|E

Despite losses of coaches and players that were projected as insurmountable hardships, Texas defied expectations, winning 13 of its first 16 games. Gilstrap credited Gray and Price with encouragement and advice from afar and his players with a <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooperation</b> {{he said he had}} not seen before. Gilstrap explained, [...] "There were a lot of things I didn't know about the system, and the boys realized that. They came to the rescue. They've been assistant coaches as well as players. We've just been trying to work it out together." [...] After stumbling on a swing through North Texas late in the season with losses to TCU and SMU, the Longhorns concluded the regular season with victories over the Baylor Bears and Texas A to win a share of the SWC championship and qualify for the NCAA Tournament for the second time. The Longhorns drew the Tournament co-favorite Washington Huskies for their first game. After falling behind by 13 points in the first half, Texas came back to win 59–55 behind 30 points from John Hargis and 15 from Buck Overall to advance to its first-ever Final Four, where it drew the other Tournament co-favorite, the Wyoming Cowboys. It was then the Longhorns who surrendered an early 13-point lead, as the bigger and stronger Cowboys regrouped to win 58–54, on their way to defeating the Georgetown Hoyas 46–34 for the NCAA championship. Texas finished the season with a 19–7 overall record.|$|E

Here, a significant generalization of the iPD is presented in form of a N-player game, instead of only two players, with continuous <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooperation,</b> instead <b>of</b> binary <b>cooperation</b> or defection. This continuous N-player PD (CN-PD) is motivated and explained by an actual experimental set-up in form of an artificial ecosystem including mobile robots. In addition, the CN-PD is discussed for the general case. Especially, {{the different types of}} pay-off are presented in some detail. The novel strategy of so-called justifiedsnobism (JS) is introduced, which tries to cooperate slightly more than the average of the group of players. Results from sets of experiments with N = 20 are presented that indicate that JS is indeed a successful strategy in the CN-PD.
