By the time I was ten or eleven he had stepped up his campaign by adding lickings to the regimen. Each Tuesday afternoon he weighed me in, and if the scale read more than it should have, he ordered me {{into his office and}} had me drop my trousers... <b>I</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>my</b> pants, pulled down my undershorts and bent over. Then he went at it with the belt dotted with metal studs he kept reserved for the occasion. Quite dispassionately, without the least display of emotion or loss of self-control, he whacked away until he drew the first drop of blood, and then he stopped. It normally took between twelve and fifteen strokes. As they came down I counted them off one by one and hoped I would bleed early...|$|E
2500|$|Opas in {{defending}} Ryan {{put a lot}} of pressure on a warder who made conflicting statements, Paterson had made several mutually contradictory statements to police about what he saw, heard and did on that day. In his first statement given to Detective Sergeant Carton on 19 December 1965 Paterson said; [...] "I did not hear a shot fired other than the one I fired." [...] In a second statement given to Senior Detective Morrison on 12 January 1966 Paterson said; [...] "Just as I turned into the entrance to the garden I heard a shot." [...] In a third statement on 3 February 1966 Paterson said; [...] "I ran back inside and asked for a gun, I went to the main gate and I received a gun and ran back outside, as I was running on to the lawn I heard the crack of a shot." [...] Paterson changed his story, too, about who was in the line of fire when he aimed his rifle. In his first statement Paterson said; [...] "I sighted my rifle at Ryan and was about to fire when a woman walked into the line of fire and I lifted my rifle." [...] In his second statement Paterson said; [...] "I took aim at Ryan but two prison officers were in the line of fire so <b>I</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>my</b> rifle again." [...] In his third statement Paterson said; [...] "I took aim at Ryan and I found out I had to fire between two prison officers to get Ryan, so I lowered my gun again." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{glanced around}} the room. We were {{absolutely}} alone, but <b>I</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>my</b> voice.|$|E
40|$|Hi, Room – {{where did}} <b>I</b> <b>drop</b> <b>my</b> keys? Um [...] . I think you'll find they're under the light blue chair second from the {{left-hand}} left hand {{end of the}} third row {{from the back of the}} auditorium.

6000|$|... "I did," [...] said <b>I,</b> <b>dropping</b> <b>my</b> voice, so that Leah, who {{was still}} {{polishing}} the panes, could not hear me, [...] "and at first I thought it was Pilot: but Pilot cannot laugh; and I am certain I heard a laugh, and a strange one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, gentlemen," [...] Percy said, [...] "you {{will take}} your places at {{opposite}} ends of the field; and when <b>I</b> <b>drop</b> <b>my</b> scarf, you will charge. It is understood that you need not necessarily ride straight at each other; but that it is free, to each of you, to do the best he can to overthrow his opponent." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>my</b> glance, browbeaten for an instant. Then I {{looked at}} him again, and smiled.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Parker, {{with the}} menu {{in front of}} him, was busy with the waiter and a maître d'hôtel. <b>I</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>my</b> voice a little.|$|E
60|$|It was {{standing}} upon {{its hind legs}} waiting for me. As I scrambled to my feet to meet it, <b>I</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>my</b> gun {{in the snow and}} doubled up with laughter.|$|E
60|$|I peered keenly {{into the}} blackness. At length I reached the slope. Here <b>I</b> <b>dropped</b> to <b>my</b> hands and knees.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Nothing of the sort, Rowley,’ I continued, in a churchyard voice. ‘These are appearances, petty appearances. I am in peril, homeless, hunted. I count scarce any one in England {{who is not}} my enemy. From {{this hour}} <b>I</b> <b>drop</b> <b>my</b> name, my title; I become nameless; my name is proscribed. My liberty, my life, hang by a hair. The destiny which you will accept, if you go forth with me, is to be tracked by spies, to hide {{yourself}} under a false name, to follow the desperate pretences and perhaps share {{the fate of a}} murderer with a price upon his head.’ ...|$|R
60|$|Just {{then two}} or three big bubbles rose to the surface, and silently exploded. Quick as {{lightning}} <b>I</b> <b>dropped</b> on <b>my</b> knees and raised my arms.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{nice and}} old-fashioned," [...] said Fleur calmly. [...] "You're frightfully silent, Jon. Still I like silence when it's swift." [...] She let go his hand. [...] "Did you think <b>I</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>my</b> {{handkerchief}} on purpose?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>my</b> paddle {{and stood}} up and shouted and waved my hand. Juag and Dian {{looked at me as}} if I had gone {{suddenly}} mad. When I could stop shouting I told them, and they shared my joy and shouted with me.|$|E
60|$|I flung my sodden castor on the table; <b>I</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>my</b> drenched cloak on the ground, {{and stepped}} with heavy tread and a noisy rattle of spurs across the floor. Yet my ragged gentleman slept on. I touched him lightly with my whip.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{pushed off}} {{as quietly as}} {{possible}} and rowed swiftly down the river. When we had gone about a mile <b>I</b> suddenly <b>dropped</b> <b>my</b> oar with an exclamation of dismay.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing of the sort, Rowley," [...] I continued, in a churchyard voice. [...] "These are appearances, petty appearances. I am in peril, homeless, hunted.

6000|$|... "Well, I wasn't {{thinking}} of myself particularly," [...] Mr. Benjamin continued, twirling an incipient mustache, and looking pleased. [...] "But when Tommy introduced him as Lord Mossford, I was that surprised <b>I</b> nearly <b>dropped</b> <b>my</b> glass." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{he looked}} at his sister, whose eyes devoured me, as if they would read in my soul whether this thing were indeed true. Under her eyes <b>I</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>my</b> glance like a man ashamed at hearing a disgraceful act of his paraded.|$|E
6000|$|... "I've had my {{own little}} fun with b'ars," [...] he said. [...] "Got in a tree onct, and a b'ar kept me there fer a whole day. I had wounded him in the leg, and in running over a brook <b>I</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>my</b> gun." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've said nothing. Don't like house-cleaning {{well enough}} to suggest it. I did think the hall was rather dirty when <b>I</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>my</b> coat and took it up covered with lint. Is she going to upset the whole place?" [...] asked Mr. Bemis, looking alarmed at the prospect.|$|E
6000|$|... "I could {{wish for}} nothing prettier {{and nothing more}} comfortable," [...] <b>I</b> answered, <b>dropping</b> <b>my</b> voice, and {{beginning}} to discover already that Mr. Fairlie's selfish affectation and Mr. Fairlie's wretched nerves meant {{one and the same}} thing.|$|R
60|$|And inside {{thirty seconds}} {{he was on}} his feet--ay, and {{returning}} the compliment, for he hooked me in the solar plexus, and <b>I</b> gasped, <b>dropped</b> <b>my</b> hands, and sat down just a trifle more suddenly than he had.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>dropped</b> on <b>my</b> {{knees and}} fell {{to work on his}} ankle bonds. Whack came something--I know not what--and splashed the livid streamlet into drops about us. Far away on our right a piping and {{whistling}} began.|$|R
60|$|I {{think what}} I did was quite clever. <b>I</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>my</b> letter unseen at his feet, and sauntered {{back to the}} club. Of course, a gentleman who finds a letter on the {{pavement}} feels bound to post it, and I presumed that he would naturally go to the nearest office.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>my</b> {{face into}} my hands, but {{was able to}} control myself better than I could have expected, {{considering}} what agony it gave me to hear her say those words. When I raised my face again, {{there was such a}} ghastly look upon Miss Havisham's, that it impressed me, even in my passionate hurry and grief.|$|E
60|$|Now Alice Lorimer possessed her father's keen perception, {{and when}} he kept his temper he was perhaps the shrewdest man I ever met; so when she looked me {{straight}} in the face <b>I</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>my</b> eyes, because I really was not anxious for her company, and should not have gone except {{in the hope of}} seeing Grace Carrington.|$|E
6000|$|... "Forgive me, dear Rima," [...] <b>I</b> said, <b>dropping</b> <b>my</b> hands again. [...] "I {{have tried}} so hard to please you in everything! Touch my face with your hand--only that, and I will go to Riolama with you, and obey you in all things." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{see that}} you, at least, are doing your part," [...] <b>I</b> rejoined gallantly, <b>dropping</b> <b>my</b> eyes on my companion's learned volume.|$|R
60|$|And there I paused. The {{thought of}} what I did and what the {{consequences}} must be rushed suddenly upon me. I shivered as a man shivers in awaking. <b>I</b> <b>dropped</b> on <b>my</b> knees before her, bowing my head and flinging wide my arms.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>my</b> arm for {{a moment}}, {{and a moment}} only. Again the knife was raised, and Wolf Larsen would have surely died had she not stepped between. Her arms were around me, her hair was {{brushing}} my face. My pulse rushed up in an unwonted manner, yet my rage mounted with it. She looked me bravely in the eyes.|$|E
60|$|Never in my {{life had}} I been so surprised, but the habit of {{military}} discipline is strong within me, and <b>I</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>my</b> little machine lightly {{to the ground and}} advanced on foot as I had seen the others do. As I halted before the officer, he addressed me in a voice audible to the entire assemblage of troops and spectators.|$|E
6000|$|... "I haven't {{had such}} a turn for years, Viola," [...] the mother explained, as they waited side by side along the narrow walk. [...] "I had an impression--so vivid--that <b>I</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>my</b> work and ran to find you. It was just as if you called me, asking for help. It {{seemed to me that}} some dreadful thing had {{happened}} to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{told me to}} {{wait until}} I was alone with you," [...] <b>I</b> said, <b>dropping</b> <b>my</b> voice significantly, and {{watching}} him intently {{out of the corner}} of my eye. I have always been rather good at what is called, I believe, creating an atmosphere.|$|R
6000|$|I saw, and {{saw with}} {{a leap of}} pure exaltation, the smash of my bullet between his {{shoulder}} blades. [...] "Got him," [...] said <b>I,</b> <b>dropping</b> <b>my</b> gun and down he flopped and died without a groan. [...] "By Jove!" [...] I cried with note of surprise, [...] "I've killed him!" [...] I looked about me and then went forward cautiously, in a mood between curiosity and astonishment, {{to look at this}} man whose soul I had flung so unceremoniously out of our common world. I went to him, not as one goes to something one has made or done, but as one approaches something found.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thanks, good friends. Alack! <b>I</b> have <b>dropped</b> <b>my</b> {{gauntlet}} in the street. But {{it is of}} no import. I thank God that no harm {{has come}} to any one. My thanks once more, and may pleasant dreams await ye.' She sprang {{up the steps and}} was gone in an instant.|$|R
