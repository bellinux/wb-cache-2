It is covered by unfolded strata of Mesozoic sediments, which are part of the Helvetic nappes. Its depth gradually decreases from about 2.5km in the west to 0.8km in the east. These layers, like the ones of the Jura Mountains, were deposited in a relatively shallow sea, the Tethys Ocean. Above the Mesozoic layers, is the Molasse, consisting of conglomerate, sandstone, marl and shale. The uppermost layer consists of gravel and glacial sediments that have been transported by the glaciers of the ice ages.|$|E

Recent GPS measurements in Iran have shown that this collision is still active and the resulting deformation is distributed non-uniformly in the country, mainly taken up in the major mountain belts like Alborz and Zagros. A relatively dense GPS network which covered the Iranian Zagros also proves a high rate of deformation within the Zagros. The GPS results show that the current rate of shortening in the southeast Zagros is ~10mm/yr, dropping to ~5mm/yr in the northwest Zagros. The north-south Kazerun strike-slip fault divides the Zagros into two distinct zones of deformation. The GPS results also show different shortening directions along the belt, normal shortening in the southeast and oblique shortening in the northwest Zagros.|$|E

50|$|<b>Geosyncline</b> is a {{geological}} concept {{which was}} developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries before the concept of plate tectonics was developed. A <b>geosyncline</b> was described as a subsiding linear trough that was caused by the accumulation of sedimentary rock strata deposited in a basin and subsequently compressed, deformed, and uplifted into a mountain range, with attendant volcanism and plutonism. The filling of a <b>geosyncline</b> with sediment is accompanied in the late stages of deposition by folding, crumpling, and faulting of the deposits. Intrusion of crystalline igneous rock and regional uplift along the axis of the trough generally complete the history of a particular <b>geosyncline.</b> It is then transformed into a belt of folded mountains. Thick volcanic sequences, together with greywackes (sandstones rich in rock fragments with a muddy matrix), cherts, and various sediments reflecting deepwater deposition or processes, were considered eugeosynclinal deposits of the outer deepwater segment of geosynclines.|$|E

40|$|The geosynclinal theory, which signalled {{the coming}} of age of American geology, survived well into the Twentieth Century. During its long history, against a {{background}} of increasing tension between descriptive and explanatory geology, efforts were made to formulate it as a causal theory of mountain building. James Hall, an American palaeontologist, first proposed a link between the accumulation of sediment in synclines and orogeny in the Mid-Nineteenth Century. James Dana then developed Hall's ideas but also sought a causal explanation for the elevation of mountains. His ideas were taken up enthusiastically by Europeans such as Marcel Bertrand, Emile Haug and Hans Stille who attempted to extrapolate a global theory of <b>geosynclines</b> from their regional studies in Europe. At the same time the contraction theory, favoured by most geologists, was challenged by the theory of isostasy initiated by John Herschel and developed by geophysicists such as Clarence Dutton and Osmond Fisher. This movement signalled both the growing need for specialized knowledge in the Earth sciences and a push by geophysicists for hegemony. In the early Twentieth Century, further development of the geosynclinal theory occurred in America where a number of geologists attempted to accommodate European and American ideas into one global theory of mountain building. Charles Schuchert, a prime mover in this project, was followed by Marshall Kay who took up Stille's and Schuchert's ideas to construct a complex taxonomy of <b>geosynclines,</b> using their nomenclature and adding some of his own. Kay's classification, however, which was largely descriptive, did little to provide a causal link between <b>geosynclines</b> and orogeny and, because of its complex nomenclature, was largely disregarded by the geological community of practising geologists. New information coming from the oceans, seafloor spreading and plate tectonics theory challenged the geosynclinal theory which was rejected in the late 1960 s by most geologists, despite vigorous efforts by some to retain the concept and marry it to plate tectonics. The history of the geosynclinal theory has been viewed in the light of a number of models of scientific change, none of which have proved fully satisfactory as an explanation or as a description. Instead, I contend that specialised knowledge of the sort that accompanied the increasing complexity of geosynclinal theory is different from other types of everyday knowledge and depends for authority on the relationship between power, i. e., "the transformative capacity of human agency", and knowledge. Specialised knowledge became increasingly esoteric and access to it became limited to those within a speciality. Those without the necessary training and education were increasingly incapable of understanding and, consequently, of judging the legitimacy of such knowledge. Valuable insights into the nature of the production of certified knowledge have been gained from the works of Pierre Bourdieu, Bruno Latour, Michel Foucault, Joseph Rouse and others but none of these authors have presented an entirely satisfactory account of power or its relationship to knowledge at least in the Earth Sciences. It has been concluded that theory change in science is the outcome of a two-sided struggle for scientific authority in which epistemological determinations are inseparably linked to social practices within the field.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Distinguishing between {{myth and}} science is subtle, for both seek to {{understand}} the things around us.

The outdated notion of <b>geosynclines</b> as deterministic precursors of orogeny is an apt example, as are central current ideas about suspect terranes, mantle plumes, and global sequence stratigraphy. Geomyths stimulate investigation, but also may retard further progress by dismissing contrary views. Improved understanding of geologic history could be attained more efficaciously by appreciating the mythic quality of many nascent ideas in geoscience, and resisting the temptation to accord geomyths favored status over competing hypotheses. introduction In our discourses, we commonly counterpose myth, taken to be imaginary, and science, conceived as an approach to reality.

50|$|The first naturalist {{to examine}} the Glarus thrust was Hans Conrad Escher von der Linth (1767-1823). Escher von der Linth {{discovered}} that, contradictory to Steno's law of superposition, older rocks are on top of younger ones in certain outcrops in Glarus. His son Arnold Escher von der Linth (1807-1872), the first professor in geology at the ETH at Zürich, mapped the structure in more detail and concluded {{that it could be}} a huge thrust. At the time, most geologists believed in the theory of <b>geosynclines,</b> which states that mountains are formed by vertical movements within the Earth's crust. Escher von der Linth had therefore difficulty with explaining the size of the thrust fault. In 1848 he invited the British geologist Roderick Murchison, an international authority, to come and look at the structure. Murchison was familiar with larger thrust faults in Scotland and agreed with Escher's interpretation. However, Escher himself felt insecure about his idea and when he published his observations in 1866 he instead interpreted the Glarus thrust as two large overturned narrow anticlines. This hypothesis was rather absurd, as he admitted himself in private.|$|R

From the other side, the previous seismic studies {{in the study area}} indicate that the capability of the seismic method to identify the deep horizons beneath the evaporite rocks is nearly impossible. Due to the strong shielding effect of the evaporite beds with respect to seismic energy, no coherent horizons could be confidently seen or mapped below the base of evaporite rocks. Likewise, the potential field data, either magnetic or gravity, show no signals that can be definitely correlated with the anticlinal feature of the RB-oil field. The Bouguer gravity map of the study area does not clearly reflect the local uplift that might be hidden in the subsurface.

Granites and shales begin to melt at 660 °C in the presence of water vapor at 4000 bars pressure.

At 1000 bars the minimum liquidus temperature in the system Ca 0 -CO_ 2 -H_ 2 O is 675 °C; at 4000 bars the liquidus minimum is 640 °C.
