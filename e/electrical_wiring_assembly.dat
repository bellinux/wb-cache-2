5000|$|PVDF is {{commonly}} used as insulation on <b>electrical</b> <b>wires,</b> because of its combination of flexibility, low weight, low thermal conductivity, high chemical corrosion resistance, and heat resistance. Most of the narrow 30-gauge wire used in <b>wire</b> wrap circuit <b>assembly</b> and printed circuit board rework is PVDF-insulated. In this use the wire is generally referred to as [...] "Kynar wire", from the trade name.|$|R

40|$|<b>Electrical</b> <b>wiring</b> and cables, in {{many cases}} buried deep, in many systems and environments suffer damage. In some cases the damage only affects wire {{insulation}} and is not usually detected under normal operating conditions. This study discusses computer modelling of <b>electrical</b> <b>wires,</b> based on time-domain reflectometry using trains of successive pulses which were used {{in order to develop}} techniques and test procedures that would lead to identification of these types of faults. This study shows detailed simulations of defects in insulation of <b>electrical</b> <b>wires</b> and in cable shields, using dedicated electromagnetic modelling computation software. The results of simulations were compared with those obtained in experimental measurement for wires and cables of several metres in length. Comparison of the analysed measurement results for this novel technique shows clear indication of its relevance to flaw detection in <b>electrical</b> <b>wires,</b> guided through simulation...|$|R

40|$|A few {{previous}} {{reports have}} described cases wherein <b>electrical</b> <b>wire</b> cables were {{inserted into the}} male urethra and bladder. <b>Electrical</b> <b>wire</b> cables are available at home and are easy to insert. However, after they coil in the patient’s bladder, they are difficult to remove. In February 2013, a 30 -year-old man presented {{to the emergency room}} of SMG-SNU Boramae Medical Center with a urethral foreign body. He had inserted an <b>electrical</b> <b>wire</b> cable into his urethra for the purpose of masturbation, despite having a regular sex partner and no underlying disease. A kidney-ureter-bladder radiography showed a tangled wire in his bladder and urethra. On the next day, we tried to remove the wire cystoscopically, but this proved to be impossible because of complex coiling and the slippery surface of the wire. A Pfannenstiel incision was made to remove the foreign body. No postoperative complications were noted. Key Words: Foreign bodies; Masturbation; Urinary bladder There have been some case reports of <b>electrical</b> <b>wire</b> ca-bles inserted into the male urethra and bladder [1 - 10]. <b>Electrical</b> <b>wire</b> cables are available at home and are easy to insert.
