In this thesis, it is intended to design and test an electrospray thruster system that could perform the attitude control of a 1 -unit CubeSat. Firstly, an experimental setup is built to calculate the conductivity of different liquids that could be used as propellants for the CubeSat. Secondly, a Time-Of-Flight experiment is performed to find out the thrust and specific impulse given by these liquids and hence selecting the optimum propellant. On the other hand, a colloidal thruster system for a 1 -U CubeSat is designed in Solidworks and fabricated using Lathe and CNC Milling Machine. Afterwards, passive propellant feeding is tested in this thruster system. Finally, the electronic circuit and wireless control system necessary to remotely control the CubeSat is designed and the final testing is performed.

Principal component analysis was found to offer a compact method for identifying the major modes of composition encountered in the regional whole air data set. Transecting the continental monsoon, urban and industrial tracers (e. g., combustion byproducts, chlorinated methanes and ethanes, xylenes, and longer chain alkanes) dominated the observed variability. Pentane enhancements reflected vehicular emissions.

40|$|We {{report the}} first coupled {{atmosphere}} and seawater alkyl nitrate measurements for the Southern Ocean {{in the area}} bounded by 36 – 65 °S, 30 – 70 °W (November/December, 2004). Methyl and <b>ethyl</b> <b>nitrate</b> concentrations in seawater were 3. 1 – 194. 9 and 0. 3 – 71. 8 pmol L– 1, respectively. Atmospheric mixing ratios ranged from 1. 0 to 71. 5 ppt for methyl nitrate and 0. 6 to 16. 6 ppt for <b>ethyl</b> <b>nitrate.</b> No correlations between alkyl nitrate distributions, and sea surface temperature, windspeed or chlorophyll a were observed.

40|$|Between February and October 2007, a {{time series}} of alkyl nitrate {{concentrations}} {{in the water column}} of a shallow freshwater lake, University of East Anglia Broad, located in southeastern England was carried out to determine whether methyl and <b>ethyl</b> <b>nitrate</b> are present in freshwater systems and to improve understanding of alkyl nitrate production mechanisms in aquatic environments.

40|$|Ionic liquids (ILs), {{which are}} defined as salts with a melting point below 100 °C are often {{considered}} as future solvents for catalysis, chemical reactions, extractions and electrochemical purposes. Apart from these classical applications, ILs have also gained interest in classical colloid and surface chemistry. The formation of amphiphilic association structures in and with ionic liquids, such as micelles, vesicles, microemulsions and liquid crystalline phases have been described in literature. The thesis can be subdivided into three main parts: Conductivity studies of the anion effect on imidazolium based ionic liquids over a wide temperature range (- 25 - 195) °C, formulation and characterization of nonaqueous, high temperature stable microemulsions with room temperature ionic liquids as polar phase and the synthesis and characterization of new ionic liquids based on alkali cations. In the first part conductivities of four different highly pure imidazolium based room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) have been studied within a temperature range between (- 25 to 195) °C. Thereby, the cationic scaffold, the 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium cation ([bmim+]), was kept constant while the anions were varied. The investigated anions were dicyanamide ([DCA-]), hexafluorophosphate ([PF 6 -]), trifluoroacetate ([TA-]) and trifluoromethanesulfonate ([TfO-]). It is quite surprising that studies of important physicochemical transport properties are still scarce {{in the field of}} ionic liquids. At a given temperature the conductivity decreased in the order [bmim][DCA] > [bmim][TA] > [bmim][TfO] > [bmim][PF 6]. Temperature dependence of the conductivity could be well described by the empirical Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann equation. Whilst our data compare favorably with some literature results, significant deviations from others were noted. To calculate the molar conductivity of the RTILs densities were measured between (5 and 65) °C. Walden plots of the molar conductance, available for [bmim][PF 6], [bmim][TfO] and [bmim][TA] in the limited temperature range of (5 to 65) °C, suggest that these RTILs can be classified as high-ionicity ionic liquids. All studies concerning ILs in microemulsions described in literature have been performed below the boiling point of water. In the present work, we were interested in microemulsions that are stable over a wide temperature range at ambient pressure. For this purpose, water must be replaced by a RTIL. Two different RTILs were used to replace water in microemulsions, namely <b>ethyl</b> ammonium <b>nitrate</b> (EAN) and 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([bmim]][BF 4]). Furthermore, the microemulsions contained the long- chain ionic liquid 1 -hexadecyl- 3 -methyl-imidazolium chloride ([C 16 mim][Cl]) as surfactant, decanol as cosurfactant, and dodecane as oil phase. Both systems were studied in a temperature range between (30 and 150) °C. The most promising microemulsions were obtained with EAN. The microemulsions were characterized by means of conductivity, rheology, dynamic light scattering (DLS), small angel X-Ray (SAXS) and small angle neutron scattering (SANS). In the case of EAN reverse microemulsions with EAN cores were obtained. The EAN systems exhibited a typical percolation behavior over the whole investigated temperature range, the corresponding percolation threshold volume fractions were significantly influenced by temperature. All scattering experiments were in agreement with EAN droplets stabilized by surfactants in a continuous oil matrix. The temperature dependent SANS experiments confirmed the existence of microemulsions up to 150 °C. The results obtained for the [bmim]][BF 4] system demonstrate the high thermal stability of these microemulsions as well, whereby the structures are less defined and can be assumed to be more a bicontinuous one than a reverse microemulsion. Conventional ILs typically contain bulky organic cations with a low degree of symmetry such as imidazolium, pyrrolidinium, tetraalkylphosphonium, trialkylsulfonium or quaternary ammonium. These cations hinder the regular packing in a crystal lattice. Consequently, the solid crystalline state becomes energetically less favorable, leading to low melting points. This effect can be enhanced further by the implementation of an anion with a delocalized charge, resulting in decreased interionic interactions. To date, little {{attention has been paid to}} systems of ionic liquids involving small inorganic cations. In this work, ionic liquids based on small inorganic cations and oligoether carboxylate anions were successfully synthesized. A new family of ILs comprising alkali cations and 2, 5, 8, 11 -tetraoxatridecan- 13 -oate (TOTO) as anion and alkali cations have been developed. These substances are promising materials due to their pronounced electrochemical and thermal stability. The concept of the ionicity plot was successfully applied to the sodium salt for which strong ion pairing was observed. Further, it was shown that the cytotoxicity of such “simple” alkali carboxylate ionic liquids compared to conventional imidazolium based ILs is very low. ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to study the {{interfacial}} properties of amphiphilic compounds at the liquid–air interface {{in an attempt to}} develop a comprehensive understanding of their orientation as well as the influence of their interaction with the solvent on the interfacial layer properties. Using Vibrational Sum Frequency Spectroscopy (VSFS) as the main tool, the molecular structure of the amphiphilic layer and the amphiphile–solvent relation can be illuminated in great detail – it is arguably the most sensitive surface spectroscopy currently available. Due to its second order nature, the VSFS technique is capable of distinguishing molecules at the interface even {{in the presence of a}} vast excess of similar molecules in the bulk. Ionic liquids (Ils) form a class of solvent which are increasingly receiving attention as ``green solvents´´. Some of these, such as <b>ethyl</b> ammonium <b>nitrate</b> (EAN), a protic IL, have the capacity to hydrogen bond extensively which is one of the important features they share with water. Since the interaction with solvent is an important consideration for self assembly and it is known that surfactant self assembly in the EAN bulk is analogous to in water, it was considered of interest to probe self assembly at EAN–air interface. To this end the interfacial structure of the pure EAN interface was probed, as was the conformation and ordering of nonionic surfactants. These studies reveal that EAN is highly ordered at the interface, exposing the ethyl moiety to the gas phase. Additionally, polarization studies have enabled the average orientation of the ethyl group to be determined. Adsorption of nonionic surfactants at the interface appears to significantly displace the EAN from the interface. The headgroup of the surfactant, a linear ethylene oxide group, appears to be highly disordered. The disorder of the linear ethylene oxide groups has led to difficulties in their surface spectroscopic fingerprinting in this and other works. In an attempt to study the interfacial behaviour of ethylene oxide and the temperature dependence of its hydration, closed loop structures of PEO attached to hydrophobic groups were also probed. This essentially locks their conformation. Such molecules are known as crown ethers and display interesting interfacial behaviour and also the ability to bind cations. The presence of even small amounts of adsorbed crown ethers at the water interface is shown to considerably perturb the water structure. The NO, CN, COC and CH vibrational modes of these compounds at the air-water interface as well as OH vibrational modes of the surface water hydrating this compound have been targeted in order to obtain molecular information about arrangement and conformation. The CH 2 vibrational modes of crown ethers have been identified and found to be split due to their interaction with ether oxygen. The spectra provide evidence for the existence of a protonated crown complex moiety at the surface leading to the appearance of strongly ordered water species. The orientation of Nitrobenzo crown (NB 15 C 5) was monitored as a function of solution concentration, by targeting the ratio of peak intensities of the CN and NO 2 vibrational modes. The water of hydration has also been probed as a function of crown concentration, salt concentration, and temperature. The latter study strongly suggests that the surface can be treated as a charged interface, and that the associated ordered water decreases with increasing ionic strength of the bulkFinally, insoluble monolayers of fatty acids spread on a water surface have also been studied in an effort to further understand the relationship between molecular architecture and film structure. Fatty acid (Arachidic Acid – AA and Eicosenoic Acid – EA) monolayers are compared to investigate the effect on the monolayer structure of introducing unsaturation into the alkyl chain. For AA, at very large area per molecule, floating domains of crystalline nature exist rather than any classical gaseous phase. The measured conformational disorder in EA decreases continuously with monolayer compression and no crystalline domains are observed at low density. Addition of NaCl to the subphase does not affect the monolayer order for either of the compounds; instead, a dramatic increase in the signal of the water hydrating the headgroups is observed. The effect of introducing further unsaturations (up to three) was also studied in order to probe the resulting interfacial structure. Remarkably the double bonds appear to adopt the same orientation, irrespective of how many they are in the chain. By monitoring the vinyl CH stretch it was possible to study the film stability towards oxidative degradation and it was found that all three unsaturated species studied showed rapid degradation. The rate of degradation could be controlled by adjusting the film pressure. However, the monolayers could be stabilised by performing the experiments in an inert nitrogen atmosphere.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston University, 1950 Since {{representative}} alipahtic N-Nitrocarbamates {{have been}} found by Dr. J. Philip Mason and Mr. Robert T. Pollock to be suitable additives for Diesel fuels, it was thought desirable to synthesize {{several members of the}} series not recorded in the literature. 	Accordingly plans were made for the synthesis of a series of nitrocarbamates having various aliphatic, alicyclic, aromatic, and heterocyclic groupings within the molecule. 	The carbamates were usually prepared by treating a mixture of an amine and aqueous sodium hydroxide with ethyl chloroformate but in some cases where this procedure failed to give a satisfactory yield or a reasonably pure product, the carbamates were prepared either by mixing the amine and ethyl chloroformate in an organic solvent or by the Hoffman rearrangement of an amide in alcohol solution. 	The carbamates were nitrated with mixtures of fuming nitric acid (sp. gr. 1. 49) and acetic anhydride. In general, it was observed that one and one-half equivalents of nitric acid were sufficient to effect complete nitration when acetic anhydride were employed as the dehydrating agent. 	Earlier investigators found that large excesses of nitric acid were required if this latter substance were used by itself as a nitrating agent. 	In the aliphatic and alicyclic series the carbamates were easily nitrated to yield the corresponding N-nitro carbamates. However, nitration of aromatic carbamates, such as ethyl N-phenyl carbamate, led to the introduction of a nitro group into the ortho and para positions of the benzene nucleus. When the ortho and para positions were blocked with methyl groups, {{as in the case of}} ethyl N-(2, 4, 6 -trimethylphenyl) carbamate, nitration then took place in the meta position to yield ethyl N-(3, 5 -dinitro- 2, 4, 6 -trimethylphenyl) carbamate. This latter compound, since all ring positions were blocked, was <b>nitrated</b> to yield <b>ethyl</b> N-nitro-N-(3, 5 -dinitro- 2, 4, 6 -trimethylphenyl) carbamate, the only aromatic N-nitrocarbamate which was obtained during the course of this investigation. 	In the heterocyclic series attempts at <b>nitrating</b> <b>ethyl</b> N-[4 -(1, 2, 4 -triazolyl) ] carbamate, ethyl N-(2 -thiazolyl) carbamate, ethyl N-(2 -pyridyl) carbamate and ethyl N-(s-pyridyl) carbamate with fuming nitric acid and acetic anhydride resulted in each case in recovery of the original material. Attempts at <b>nitrating</b> <b>ethyl</b> N-(2 -furfuryl) carbamate and ethyl N-(2 -thenyl) carbamate resulted in the formation of dark, viscous tarry substances. 	However ethyl N-(2 -pyridyl) carbamate and ethyl N-(3 -pyridyl) carbamate were nitrated in the nucleus by refluxing them with a mixture of fuming nitric acid and concentrated sulfuric acid to yield ethyl N-[2 -(5 -nitropyridyl) ] carbamate and ethyl N-[3 -(2 -nitropyridyl) ] carbamate respectively. 	In the case of ethyl N-[2 -(5 -nitropyridyl) ] carbamate the position of the nitro group was ascertained by hydrolyzing it to 5 -nitro- 2 -aminopyridine, a known compound. The ethyl N-[3 -(2 -nitropyridyl) ] carbamate was hydrolyzed to 2 -nitro- 3 -aminopyridine, a new compound, and the latter substance was reduced to 2, 3 -diaminopyridine, a compound which has previously been reported. 	Earlier investigators has employed N-nitro-carbamates as intermediates in the synthesis of N-nitroamines. The nitrocarbamates in ethereal solution were treated with gaseous ammonia which caused them to undergo ammonolysis to the ammonium salt of the nitroamine, which substance precipitated from the ethereal solution. 	It was thought that a similar reaction could be effected by means of primary and secondary amines. Investigation of the reaction showed that this was indeed the cases and the resulting amine salts of N-nitroamines serve as excellent derivatives of either amines or N-nitroamines since they all have melting points within the range 50 degrees Celsius to 150 degrees Celsius. These salts can also be precipitated simply by mixing ethereal solutions of the amine and the nitroamine. 	The insolubility of theses substances in organic solvents and the fact that the majority of them were easily soluble in water was a good indication that they were true salts. This fact was born out by conductance measurements on several of these compounds which indicated that they were good electrolytes, comparable in strength with such salts as sodium acetate and sodium propionate. 	The ultra-violet absorption spectra of several N-nitrocarbamates and amine salts of N-nitroamines were investigated and it was observed that the maxima of the N-nitrocarbamates fell in the range 235 - 240 millimicrons with the extinction coefficients in the range 233 - 235 millimicrons with extinction coefficients ranging from 8080 to 8210. The carbamates themselves did not absorb at all in the entire region that was investigated (220 - 400 millimicrons). 	The overall picture of the results indicates that there is a slight shift toward the visible in the spectra of the N-nitrocarbamates, although the shift is not of such magnitude to serve as a means of distinguishing N-nitrocarbamates from N-nitroamines. 	The behavior of one member of the series of aliphatic nitrocarbamates, ethyl N-nitro-N-isopropyl carbamate was studied in the presence of various oxidizing agents. It was predicted that in the presence of alkaline potassium permanganate, this substance would be oxidized to acetone, acetic acid, oxides of nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and water. However it was found that the oxidation products were isopropyl N-nitroamine, acetic acid, and carbon dioxide. In the presence of acidic potassium permanganate the nitrocarbamate appears to be oxidized completely to carbon dioxide, oxides of nitrogen and water.

40|$|Examination of the {{influence}} of dissolved gases {{on the state of the}} liquid surface during high-pressure liquid-monopropellant combustion through the use of a strand burning experiment. Liquid surface temperatures were measured, using fine-wire thermocouples, during the strand combustion of <b>ethyl</b> <b>nitrate,</b> normal propyl nitrate, and propylene glycol dinitrate at pressures up to 81 atm. These measurements were compared with the predictions of a variable-property gas-phase analysis assuming an infinite activation energy for the decomposition reaction. The state of the liquid surface was estimated using a conventional low-pressure phase equilibrium model, as well as a high-pressure version that considered the presence of dissolved combustion-product gases in the liquid phase. The high-pressure model was found to give a superior prediction of measured liquid surface temperatures. Computed total pressures required for the surface to reach its critical mixing point during strand combustion were found to be in the range from 2. 15 to 4. 62 times the critical pressure of the pure propellant.

40|$|This {{paper is}} based on alkyl nitrate {{measurements}} made over the North Atlantic {{as part of the}} International Consortium for Research on Atmospheric Transport and Transformation (ICARTT). The focus is on the analysis of air samples collected on the UK BAe- 146 aircraft during the Intercontinental Transport of Ozone and Precursors (ITOP) project, but air samples collected on board the NASA DC- 8 and NOAA WP- 3 D aircraft as part of a Lagrangian experiment are also used. The ratios between the alkyl nitrates and their parent hydrocarbons are compared with those expected from chemical theory. Further, a box model is run to investigate the temporal evolution of the alkyl nitrates in three Lagrangian case studies and compared to observations. The air samples collected during ITOP {{do not appear to be}} strongly influenced by oceanic sources, but rather are influenced by emissions from the N. E. United States and from Alaskan fires. There also appears to be a widespread common source of <b>ethyl</b> <b>nitrate</b> and 1 -propyl nitrate other than from their parent hydrocarbons. The general agreement between the alkyl nitrate data and photochemical theory suggests that during the first few days of transport from the source region, photochemical production of alkyl nitrates, and thus ozone, had taken place. The observations in the more photochemically processed air masses are consistent with the alkyl nitrate production reactions no longer dominating the peroxy radical self/cross reactions. Further, the results also suggest that the rates of photochemical processing in the Alaskan smoke plumes were small...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the heavy}} damage due to {{photochemical}} smog {{took place in}} 1970, the study on its chemical origine has been conducted continuously. This report is one of which gas chromatographic technique was mainly applied. The three parts of the present research were environmental analysis, photochemical experiment of auto exhaust gas and that of aromatics. 1) Gas chromatographic and gas chromatograph-mass spectrometric analysis of air samples showed the existence of acrolein and methyl nitrate in urban atmosphere. Especially in smog two components were detected at high level. It was suggested that acrolein would cause eye irritation and methyl nitrate would disturb circulation of the blood. 2) A high content of toluene in the air was resulted from the auto exhaust from the burning of reforming gasoline of high octane value. Such carbonyl and nitrocompounds as acetone, acrolein, methyl nitrate, <b>ethyl</b> <b>nitrate,</b> nitromethane, peroxyacetyl nitrate, and nitroethane were found, from the result of photochemical reaction of the auto exhaust. Usually, methyl nitate was at highest concentration. The formation of large amounts of C_ 3 compound from smaller retio of unsaturated hydrocarbon like butenes except aromatics cannot be understood. 3) It was experimentally found that acrolein, acetone and methyl nitrate were formed through the photochemical reaction of toluene with nitrogen oxides. This fact intently suggested the cleavage of aromatic ring in toluene. In this process, the decreasing rate of toluene was so much as toluene seemed to be relate to smog formation. According to the relationships of these facts, the smog toxics would be made from the aromatics branched as toluene in auto exhaust gas. ...|$|E

In the present study, we investigated the effects induced by per os (p. o.) administration of nicorandil (12. 5, 25 or 50 mg/kg) or equimolar doses (corresponding to the highest dose of nicorandil) of N-(2 -hydroxyethyl) nicotinamide (NHN), its main metabolite, or nicotinamide in the model of nociceptive response induced by formaldehyde in mice. Nicorandil, but not NHN or nicotinamide, inhibited {{the second phase of}} the nociceptive response. This activity was observed when nicorandil was administered between 30 and 120 min before the injection of formaldehyde. Ipsilateral intraplantar injection of nicorandil (125, 250 or 500 μg/paw) did not inhibit the nociceptive response. After p. o. administration of nicorandil (50 mg/kg), peak plasma concentrations of this compound and NHN were observed 0. 63 and 4 h later, respectively. Nicotinamide concentrations were not increased after administration of nicorandil. 1 H-[1, 2, 4]oxadiazolo[4, 3 -a]quinoxalin- 1 -one (ODQ; 1 or 2 mg/kg), a guanylyl cyclase inhibitor, partially attenuated the antinociceptive activity of nicorandil. However, this activity was not changed by glibenclamide (30 or 60 mg/kg), an inhibitor of ATP-dependent K+ channels. In conclusion, we demonstrated the antinociceptive activity of nicorandil in a model of pain that exhibits both a nociceptive and an inflammatory profile. This activity is not mediated by nicotinamide or NHN. The coupling of an NO-donor to nicotinamide results in a compound with an increased potency. The NO–cGMP pathway, but not ATP-dependent K+ channels, partially mediates the antinociceptive activity of nicorandil...|$|E
