This study also aims to identify whether there are significance difference between location, time, purpose and level of educations among rempit group. Two method of data collection was used namely quantitative and qualitative method. Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory (CSEI) (1967), peers, society and institution influence (Yahya Don, 1998) was used in this study, whereas observation and interview are used in qualitative method. A total of 2059 suspect of rempit group in Kedah, Pulau Pinang, Terengganu and Kuala Lumpur involved in this study. Interview involved rempit group, student’s counselor, police traffic, AADK officers, NGO’s and society members. Pearson correlation, MANOVA, t-test was used in analysis. Finding shows rempit group involved in <b>drugs</b> <b>abuse</b> are low of self esteem. A finding also shows there is significance correlation between educational institutions towards <b>drugs</b> <b>abuse</b> among rempit group.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{it is argued}} that <b>drugs</b> of <b>abuse</b> act on {{specific}} neurotransmitter pathways and by this mechanism elicit neurochemical changes that mimic some aspects of the overall pattern of the neurochemical effects of natural rewarding stimuli. Thus, <b>drugs</b> of <b>abuse</b> are biochemically homologous to specific aspects of natural rewarding stimuli. The behavioural similarity between <b>drugs</b> of <b>abuse</b> and natural stimuli, including that of being rewarding, results from their common property of activating neurochemically specific pathways. Natural stimuli accomplish this result indirectly through their sensory properties and incentive learning while drugs stimulate by a direct central action the critical reward pathways. Many <b>drugs</b> of <b>abuse</b> mimic the incentive properties of natural stimuli and their ability to stimulate mesolimbic dopamine pathways (Fig. I). Both natural rewards and <b>drugs</b> of <b>abuse,</b> including amphetamine, cocaine and other psychostimulants, preferentially stimulate dopamine transmission in the mesolimbic nucleus accumbens compared with the dorsal caudate, an area related to the extrapyramidal motor system. Although many <b>drugs</b> of <b>abuse</b> mimic the incentive aspect of natural reward, this is probably not an absolute prerequisite for conferring to a <b>drug</b> some <b>abuse</b> liability. It might be predicted that certain <b>drugs</b> might be <b>abused</b> {{as a result of their}} action at sites located beyond dopamine or by mimicking other aspects of naturally rewarding stimuli such as the 'functional' (or trophotropic). This might be the case with opiates (which also mimic the 'incentive' aspect) and of benzodiazepines, as a result of activation of the central opioid reward system and of the central gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) -benzodiazepine system respectively. The hypothesis appears to have heuristic value as it predicts that biochemical mechanisms important for the rewarding properties of <b>drugs</b> of <b>abuse</b> are expected to play a role also in natural reward. One test of this hypothesis is offered by the observation that the 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) system, through 5 -HT 3 receptors, and the central opioid system, through delta-opioid receptors, can contribute to the mechanism of the dopamine-activating properties of certain <b>drugs</b> of <b>abuse.</b> On this basis it would be predicted that drugs acting on 5 -HT 3 and on delta-opioid receptors would interfere with or mimic certain aspects of natural rewarding stimul...|$|R
