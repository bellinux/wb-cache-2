Lerner and Policy hired Dwight Clark, a former 49ers wide receiver, as the team's operations director in December 1998. The owners then signed Jacksonville Jaguars offensive coordinator Chris Palmer in January 1999 as the reactivated team's first head coach.

40|$|<b>GEAR</b> <b>UP,</b> a federally-funded pre-college {{outreach}} program, {{strives to}} provide academic and other supports to {{middle and high}} school students and their families to help them prepare for, and pursue, higher education. <b>GEAR</b> <b>UP</b> was established in 1998 by President Clinton through Title IV of the 1998 Amendments to the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA). This paper utilizes a phenomenological frame to explore certain key considerations involved in the initial implementation phases of a <b>GEAR</b> <b>UP</b> grant. Four distinct qualitative phenomenological perspectives from Southern Connecticut State University (SCSU) faculty members involved in a current State of Connecticut <b>GEAR</b> <b>UP</b> grant Alliance are shared. Through these four accounts, qualitative, descriptive information about specific systemic, organizational, content, and procedural factors to consider when beginning implementation and planning for a 6 -year university-school district partnership like <b>GEAR</b> <b>UP</b> are considered. The insights are not necessarily limited to <b>GEAR</b> <b>UP,</b> however, and may be applicable to other partnership initiatives and/or other large-scale program implementation efforts...|$|R

Grover Magnin kept a flow of work with I. Magnin designs, and Pflueger also helped the Army with a depot building in Ogden, Utah. He began to draw up plans for a 12-story cross-shaped medical teaching hospital for the University of California, San Francisco (eventually to be built at 505 Parnassus in 1955 with additional design work performed by his brother Milton Pflueger).

40|$|Leadership Policy and Organizations Department {{capstone}} projectThis report {{examines the}} role of <b>GEAR</b> <b>UP</b> site coordinators and school counselors {{in the development and}} implementation of <b>GEAR</b> <b>UP</b> Tennessee. The <b>GEAR</b> <b>UP</b> Tennessee program is an ambitious effort that offers a myriad of interventions to support academic preparation and college access in rural communities across the state. Though supported by a network of local and state partners, the program gives the nine participating districts discretion in the design and implementation of initiatives at the local level. Site coordinators are the primary agents charged with the responsibility of district-level implementation. Within the school context, school counselors are the individuals with the organizational proximity necessary for meaningful interactions with students concerning educational advancement. While <b>GEAR</b> <b>UP</b> Tennessee has collected data relative to the program's effects on schools, teachers, and parents, the work of site coordinators and school counselors has been largely overlooked. Therefore, in response to a request for assistance from the Tennessee Higher Education Commission (THEC), we developed the following research questions: How does the program structure and district context shape site 1) coordinators' implementation of <b>GEAR</b> <b>UP?</b> 2) What factors affect school counselors' implementation of <b>GEAR</b> <b>UP</b> initiatives? We conducted 63 semi-structured interviews with <b>GEAR</b> <b>UP</b> site coordinators, district leaders, school principals, school counselors and THEC officials. Interviews were designed to gather information on the district's performance in preparing students for post-secondary education; the respondent's knowledge of and role within GEAR UP; district and school supports and barriers affecting implementation, which include issues around individual and institutional capacity and will; the coherence of program messages and the sense-making in which respondents engaged to make decisions about their participation in the program and its implementation; and respondents' perceptions of program effects. Our data reveal that: Participating school districts were pressured by, and as a result largely focused on, No Child Left Behind (NCLB) compliance. The presence of NCLB largely detracted from the district's ability to fully embrace <b>GEAR</b> <b>UP</b> and integrate it into their district improvement plan. District and school leaders possessed little knowledge about <b>GEAR</b> <b>UP,</b> its intended implementation, and the appropriate role structure of site coordinators, district personnel, and school personnel. Most site coordinators did not perceive <b>GEAR</b> <b>UP</b> as a potential lever for systemic change. Site coordinators and school counselors received little substantive support from state and local leadership relative to implementation of <b>GEAR</b> <b>UP</b> college access interventions. The content of site coordinators' work focused predominantly on activity planning, resource distribution, and grant compliance. The community culture, specifically the "welfare state of mind," was perceived by all respondents as a barrier to advancing students' educational attainment. Training and professional development activities have been provided for site coordinators with a primary focus on grant compliance and reporting mechanisms. Site coordinators reported few opportunities to deepen their knowledge of how to increase students' academic preparation and college access, which has significant effects on implementation outcomes, program sustainability, and systemic change. Training for district and school personnel has been lacking and, in many cases, nonexistent. The work of school counselors is influenced by the lack of a coherent counseling curriculum, time constraints, and role ambiguity. Consequently, counselors provide sporadic support and leadership in <b>GEAR</b> <b>UP</b> implementation. As a result of these findings, we offer the following recommendations to ensure full program implementation and the attainment of program goals: 1) Improve the visibility and effectiveness of site coordinators by developing communication networks among coordinators and school and district personnel; creating comprehensive training manuals for coordinators; and implementing a series of trainings which address the factors influencing students' academic preparation and college access, as well as program implementation strategies supportive of <b>GEAR</b> <b>UP</b> goals. 2) Educate and involve district and school leadership by developing a <b>GEAR</b> <b>UP</b> TN Leaders Guide in tandem with <b>GEAR</b> <b>UP</b> TN leadership trainings. Trainings will create the forum to collaboratively plan with site coordinators in order to align <b>GEAR</b> <b>UP</b> TN interventions to both the district and school improvement plans. 3) Educate and involve the school counselor by developing a <b>GEAR</b> <b>UP</b> TN School Counselors Guide in tandem with <b>GEAR</b> <b>UP</b> TN counseling trainings. Trainings will help counselors implement college preparation curricula, improve collaborative planning with site coordinators, and develop communication networks among counselors. 4) Collectively develop a comprehensive sustainability plan which determines how to effectively disseminate data; galvanize support of the school counselor as well as district and school leadership within <b>GEAR</b> <b>UP</b> TN; and effect state-level policy change to enhance the core goals of <b>GEAR</b> <b>UP</b> TN.

Intended to destroy enemy surface pickets and provide early warning for the carriers, the destroyers screened the fast carriers during their air strikes on Honshū on 16 and 17 February. During these operations, the destroyers vectored in combat air patrol (CAP) against enemy “snoopers”, helping to splash eight.
