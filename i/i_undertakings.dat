40|$|Under {{the rules}} of the WTO, governments are {{prohibited}} from negotiating voluntary export restraints (VERs) but can negotiate price <b>undertakings</b> (<b>i.</b> e, import price minima). While these two policies can have identical effects in models of perfect competition, they can have very different economic consequences with imperfect competition. The model presented here shows that with Bertrand duopoly competition, a VER can result in lower domestic prices and profits than a price minimum regime. This suggests that price undertakings should also be prohibited under the WTO. JEL classification: F 12, F 1...|$|R

I focused on undertaking concentrations, {{one of the three}} fundamental pillars of a competition protection. The description of last tendencies in the EU law explains its current values that are typical for Czech law system nowadays. First two chapters include analysis of harmonization of Czech and European competition law in the area of control of concentrations between <b>undertakings.</b> <b>I</b> tried to find solution of problems joined with the harmonization based on the opinions of Czech law specialist in the next chapter. The closing part of the thesis focuses on the last novelization in September 2009. There are also critique and recommendation included in the last chapter...|$|R

40|$|The {{doctrine}} of interjurisdictional immunity holds that valid, generally worded legislation enacted by one order of government cannot constitutionally {{be applied in}} contexts {{that can be said}} to fall within a core area of the other order of government’s legislative jurisdiction. After years of seemingly settled law, the Supreme Court of Canada reassessed the doctrine in its decisions in Canadian Western Bank v. Albert (CWB) and in British Columbia (Attorney General) v. Lafarge Canada Inc. (Lafarge) where the doctrine was invoked by federally regulated <b>undertakings</b> (<b>i.</b> e., banks and a port authority) wanting to avoid the application of valid provincial legislation. The purposes of this paper are to provide to provide a detailed overview of the origins and evolution of the {{doctrine of}} interjurisdictional immunity and a careful scrutiny of the doctrine’s place in the evolving law of Canadian federalism. Part II of the paper looks at the legal test used in early cases involving federally regulated undertakings. Part III summarizes the Court’s reassessment of the doctrine in both CWB and Lafarge. Part IV offers critical analysis of the Court’s reassessment of the doctrine...|$|R

To the recipients I {{would like to say that}} you have most certainly done UiTM proud by journeying through the scholastic path with its endless challenges and impediments, and persevering right till the very end. This convocation should not be regarded as the end of your highest scholarly achievement and contribution to the body of knowledge but rather as the beginning of embarking into high impact innovative research for the community and country from knowledge gained during this academic journey. As alumni of UiTM, we will always hold you dear to our hearts. A new ‘handshake’ is about to take place between you and UiTM as joint collaborators in future research <b>undertakings.</b> <b>I</b> envisioned a strong research pact between you as our alumni and UiTM in breaking the frontier of knowledge through research.

6000|$|It was Gidding and his Americanism, his inborn {{predisposition}} to innovation {{and the large}} freedom of his wealth that turned these ideas into immediate concrete <b>undertakings.</b> <b>I</b> {{see more and more}} that it is here that we of the old European stocks, who still grow upon the old wood, differ most from those vigorous grafts of our race in America and Africa and Australia {{on the one hand and}} from the renascent peoples of the East on the other: that we have lost the courage of youth and have not yet gained the courage of desperate humiliations, in taking hold of things. To Gidding it was neither preposterous nor insufferably magnificent that we should set about a propaganda of all science, all knowledge, all philosophical and political ideas, round about the habitable globe. His mind began producing concrete projects as a fire-work being lit produces sparks, and soon he was [...] "figuring out" [...] the most colossal of printing and publishing projects, as a man might work out the particulars for an alteration to his bathroom. It was so entirely natural to him, it was so entirely novel to me, to go on from the proposition that understanding was the primary need of humanity to the systematic organization of free publishing, exhaustive discussion, intellectual stimulation. He set about it as a company of pharmacists might organize the distribution of some beneficial cure.|$|R
40|$|My {{research}} philosophy {{revolves around}} the belief that successful systems research has to demonstrate two things: 1) a novel and interesting approach to an important research problem, and 2) usability. I strongly believe that for a system to be successful, {{it has to be}} usable by the target audience. On the other hand, a highly usable system that doesn’t advance {{the state of the art}} in any way is not particularly interesting from a research perspective either. My research style is strongly systems-oriented with a large emphasis on hands-on system implementation. A real implementation is crucial, in my opinion, for testing complicated distributed systems as the complexity inherent in these systems is incredibly hard to capture by simulation studies alone. A real implementation is also vital in validating the usability of the system. In addition, the software artifacts from such implementations are important contributions that drive future research and even product development in the area. I am also a strong proponent of collaborative research. Modern systems are so complicated that it is impossible for one person to have all the answers to every problem encountered. As such, I tend to work with about 2 - 4 other people, each with slightly different skills and backgrounds, to tackle a large systems problem. This multi-disciplinary approach is very apparent in all my research <b>undertakings.</b> <b>I</b> describe some of these undertakings along with avenues of future research in the next few sections. My research {{revolves around the}} theme of mobility. Around this theme, I have built clusters of research. In particular, I have research thrusts in the areas of Applications for Mobility, Understandin...|$|R
60|$|Many {{people feel}} the need of prayer to resist the evil in {{themselves}} and {{to keep them in}} mind of divine emotion. And many want not merely prayer but formal prayer and the support of others, praying in unison. The writer does not understand this desire or need for collective prayer very well, but there are people who appear to do so {{and there is no reason}} why they should not assemble for that purpose. And there is no doubt that divine poetry, divine maxims, religious thought finely expressed, may be heard, rehearsed, collected, published, and distributed by associations. The desire for expression implies a sort of assembly, a hearer at least as well as a speaker. And expression has many forms. People with a strong artistic impulse will necessarily want to express themselves by art when religion touches them, and many arts, architecture and the drama for example, are collective <b>undertakings.</b> <b>I</b> do not see why there should not be, under God, associations for building cathedrals and suchlike great still places urgent with beauty, into which men and women may go to rest from the clamour of the day's confusions; I do not see why men should not make great shrines and pictures expressing their sense of divine things, and why they should not combine in such enterprises rather than work to fill heterogeneous and chaotic art galleries. A wave of religious revival and religious clarification, such as I foresee, will most certainly bring with it a great revival of art, religious art, music, songs, and writings of all sorts, drama, the making of shrines, praying places, temples and retreats, the creation of pictures and sculptures. It is not necessary to have priestcraft and an organised church for such ends. Such enrichments of feeling and thought are part of the service of God.|$|R
6000|$|When I {{think of}} any great poetical writer of the past (a realist is an {{historian}} and obscures the cleavage by the record of his eyes) I comprehend, if I know the lineaments of his life, that the work is the man's flight from his entire horoscope, his blind struggle in the network of the stars. William Morris, a happy, busy, most irascible man, described dim colour and pensive emotion, following, beyond any man of his time, an indolent muse; while Savage Landor topped us all in calm nobility when the pen was in his hand, as in the daily violence of his passion when he had laid it down. He had in his Imaginary Conversations reminded us, as it were, that the Venus de Milo is a stone, and yet he wrote when the copies {{did not come from}} the printer as soon as he expected: [...] "I have ... had the resolution to tear in pieces all my sketches and projects and to forswear all future <b>undertakings.</b> <b>I</b> have tried to sleep away my time and pass two-thirds of the twenty-four hours in bed. I may speak of myself as a dead man." [...] I imagine Keats to have been born with that thirst for luxury common to many at the outsetting of the Romantic Movement, and not able, like wealthy Beckford, to slake it with beautiful and strange objects. It drove him to imaginary delights; ignorant, poor, and in poor health, and not perfectly well-bred, he knew himself driven from tangible luxury; meeting Shelley, he was resentful and suspicious because he, as Leigh Hunt recalls, [...] "being a little too sensitive on the score of his origin, felt inclined to see in every man of birth his natural enemy." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{search for}} {{interesting}} and rewarding repertoire {{is a lifelong}} process for the modern violist. Because of the viola's belated acceptance as a solo instrument, only the occasional solo viola piece appears in the Baroque, Classical, and Romantic periods, giving violists special incentive to embrace new sources of repertoire, including transcriptions of works for other instruments, new works by living composers, and rediscovered works by lesser-known composers. This dissertation explores another means by which violists {{have contributed to the}} concert repertoire: composing their own music. Music written by violists with performing careers follows in a historical tradition of player-composers, especially pianist-composers such as Ludwig van Beethoven, Franz Liszt, and Sergei Rachmaninov, whose intimate knowledge of their instrument resulted in beloved works of art. In order to highlight music that stems from this intersection of performance and composition, I adopted the following criteria for a violist-composer's inclusion in the project: specialization in the viola over other instruments, including the violin; professional performance career, usually in an ensemble, on recordings, or in a teaching position; particular interest in writing for the viola within the compositional oeuvre; and chronological overlap of performance and compositional <b>undertakings.</b> <b>I</b> crafted, prepared, and performed three recital programs of music by violist-composers, selecting works that appealed to me as a performer and represented a variety of instrumentations, styles, and genres. The chosen pieces highlight themes common to violist-composers, including improvisatory gestures, exploration of tone colors, stylistic crossover from non-classical music, pedagogical goals, technical virtuosity, and chamber music for multiple violas. Featured composers are Alessandro Rolla, L. E. Casimir Ney, Lionel Tertis, Henri Casadesus, Maurice Vieux, Paul Hindemith, Rebecca Clarke, Tibor Serly, Lillian Fuchs, Paul Walther Fürst, Atar Arad, Michael Kugel, Garth Knox, Paul Coletti, Brett Dean, Kenji Bunch, Scott Slapin, and Lev Zhurbin. The dissertation includes live recordings of the three recitals with program notes discussing the composers and their music. A list of violist-composers, including those not featured on the recital programs, appears as an appendix, providing the basis for further exploration by violists seeking engaging new concert repertoire...|$|R
40|$|As {{entities}} {{where the}} production process takes place, non financial corporations deserve full attention {{in the analysis of}} the real and financial accounts. However, the examination of the financial behaviour of non financial corporations is traditionally confined to their financing : thus, the Bank’s annual report generally only considers their liabilities. Yet the formation of financial assets by non financial corporations is a significant item of information, in both statistical and economic terms. The total financial assets held by non financial corporations in Belgium are considerable, as they far exceed the total financial assets of households. A study recently revealed the historically high level of financial asset formation by non financial corporations in the main industrialised countries, a factor which could help to explain the relatively low level of long-term interest rates. In recent years, Belgian non financial corporations have formed substantially more financial assets than their counterparts in the euro area. In 2005, the financial assets held by Belgian companies were – partly for that reason – almost double the financial assets, expressed in percentages of GDP, of non financial corporations in the euro area. However, this situation certainly does not indicate any risk aversion on the part of Belgian non financial corporations. In fact the liabilities side of their balance sheets also records growth of new financial liabilities in excess of the figure for non financial corporations in the euro area, so that – in terms of liabilities, too – the outstanding total in Belgium is comparatively much higher than the outstanding total in the euro area. This paradoxical situation of Belgian non financial corporations – the fact that they hold much more substantial assets {{while at the same time}} contracting significantly greater liabilities – is due to the fact that the Belgian non financial corporations sector includes coordination centres and non financial holding companies, <b>i.</b> e. <b>undertakings</b> acting, as it were, as financial intermediaries. If the coordination centres and non financial holding companies are excluded, the overall outstanding total gross assets and liabilities of Belgian non financial corporations reverts to a level very close to the figure for the euro area. Finally, in 2005 Belgian non financial institutions recorded an outstanding total of net liabilities amounting to around 100 p. c. of GDP, i. e. slightly more than the outstanding total for non financial corporations in the euro area. It is also apparent that the exclusion of the coordination centres and non financial holding companies has hardly any effect on Belgium’s net debtor position, confirming that these two types of institutions perform an intermediary function. Although it is not possible to isolate the coordination centres and non financial holding companies in the case of new transactions (flows), there is no reason to think that the effect would be any different : there would be a significant decline in the gross flows of new assets and liabilities, but that would have a negligible influence on the financial balance. That balance is very similar to the one for the euro area. flow of funds, corporate finance...|$|R
