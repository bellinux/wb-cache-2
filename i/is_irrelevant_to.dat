5|$|If {{the trial}} judge erroneously permits the {{striking}} of a juror under Batson, and the error is preserved, the only remedy is automatic reversal. If {{the trial judge}} erroneously prevents the striking of a juror under Batson, and the juror is seated, the Constitution permits a jurisdiction to utilize harmless error analysis. The race of the defendant <b>is</b> <b>irrelevant</b> <b>to</b> a Batson claim. Batson also permits the prosecutor to challenge defense peremptory strikes ("reverse Batson"). And, Batson applies equally to race and gender.|$|E
5|$|Viral genomes are circular, {{as in the}} polyomaviruses, or linear, as in the adenoviruses. The type of {{nucleic acid}} <b>is</b> <b>irrelevant</b> <b>to</b> {{the shape of the}} genome. Among RNA viruses and certain DNA viruses, the genome is often divided up into {{separate}} parts, in which case it is called segmented. For RNA viruses, each segment often codes for only one protein and they are usually found together in one capsid. However, all segments are not required {{to be in the same}} virion for the virus to be infectious, as demonstrated by brome mosaic virus and several other plant viruses.|$|E

25|$|To be discriminatory {{within the}} meaning of Section 15 of the Charter, Cory argues that the {{distinction}} only has to be made on an enumerated or analogous ground protected by Section 15.

25|$|In Karl Popper's {{philosophy}} of science, {{belief in a}} supernatural God is outside the natural domain of scientific investigation because all scientific hypotheses must be falsifiable in the natural world. The non-overlapping magisteria view proposed by Stephen Jay Gould also holds that the existence (or otherwise) of God <b>is</b> <b>irrelevant</b> <b>to</b> and beyond the domain of science.|$|E

25|$|The {{exclusion}} of Chinese governments (both ROC and PRC) in the negotiation {{process of the}} San Francisco Peace Treaty (SFPT) nullified any legal binding power of the SFPT on China, including any act of renouncing or disposing of sovereignty. In addition, the fact that neither ROC nor PRC government ever ratified SFPT terms, prescribes that the SFPT <b>is</b> <b>irrelevant</b> <b>to</b> any discussion of Chinese sovereignty.|$|E
25|$|Duck typing {{differs from}} a {{nominative}} type {{system in a}} number of aspects. The most prominent ones are that for duck typing, type information is determined at runtime (as contrasted to compile time), {{and the name of the}} type <b>is</b> <b>irrelevant</b> <b>to</b> determine type identity or type dependence; only partial structure information is required for that for a given point in the program execution.|$|E

25|$|Hurrian uses both {{enclitic}} {{and independent}} personal pronouns. The independent pronouns {{can occur in}} any case, whereas the enclitic ones represent only the absolutive. It <b>is</b> <b>irrelevant</b> <b>to</b> {{the meaning of the}} sentence to which word in the sentence the enclitic pronoun is attached, so it is often attached either to the first phrase or to the verb.

25|$|Using {{the same}} {{application}} of vertical transactions MMT {{argues that the}} holder of the bond <b>is</b> <b>irrelevant</b> <b>to</b> the issuing government. As {{long as there is}} a demand for the issuer's currency, whether the bond holder is foreign or not, governments can never be insolvent when the debt obligations are in their own currency; this is because the government is not constrained in creating its own currency (although the bond holder may affect the exchange rate by converting to local currency). Similarly, according to the FX theory outlined above, the currency paid out at maturity cannot leave the country of issuance either.|$|E

25|$|In {{the second}} trial, however, {{the issue is}} not whether John tried to kill Monica but rather whether the officer's entry into the home was lawful. Here, the {{statement}} is not being offered to prove that John tried to kill Monica, but it instead is being offered to prove that the officer had probable cause to enter the home. Whether John was actually trying to kill Monica <b>is</b> <b>irrelevant</b> <b>to</b> the issue at hand; what matters is whether the officer believed that Monica was in danger and whether it had been necessary to kick down the door to investigate further. Monica's statement is evidence to that effect because a reasonable person, having heard Monica's cries for help, would fear for her safety.|$|E
25|$|Tom Leykis {{was born}} August 1, 1956, {{at a time}} when his parents, Harry and Laura (n√©e O'Mara), lived in the Bronx. Leykis spent his early {{childhood}} in The Bronx, New York City, New York and has two sisters (Terry, Anne) and a brother (Jim). Leykis is of Irish, Jewish and Ukrainian descent. His Jewish grandfather, who originated in Kiev, Ukraine, emigrated to Lithuania and later to the United States {{at the turn of the}} 20th century presumably to escape the historical anti-Semitic pogroms in the Russian Empire. Tom Leykis has repeatedly stated that his lineage <b>is</b> <b>irrelevant</b> <b>to</b> his life and his accomplishments in the radio business. His father was a union leader at The New York Post. At a point in Leykis' childhood, he moved with his family to Selden, Long Island, where he completed high school and graduated at 16 from Newfield High School. He then moved away from the family home to study broadcasting at Fordham University and dropped out due to financial issues.|$|E

[...] The men who agreed to picket had to wear suits and ties, and the women who participated were to wear dresses, heels, and pantyhose so as to look employable by the federal government.

[...] On the topic of stem cell research, he in 2004 said that stem cells [...] "offer great promise for addressing incurable diseases and afflictions.

[...] However, in February 2005, in a speech at the annual conference of the National Association of Science Writers, he stated, [...] "Intelligent design is not a scientific theory....

500|$|Section 7 {{creates the}} [...] "broad and {{innovatory}} offence" [...] {{of the failure}} of commercial organisations to prevent bribery on their behalf. This applies to all commercial organisations which have business in the UK. Unlike corporate manslaughter, this does not only apply to the organisation itself; individuals and employees may also be found guilty. The offence is one of strict liability, with no need to prove any kind of intention or positive action. It is also one of vicarious liability; a commercial organisation can be guilty of the offence if the bribery is carried out by an employee, an agent, a subsidiary, or another third-party, as found in Section 8. The location of the third-party <b>is</b> <b>irrelevant</b> <b>to</b> the prosecution‚Äî according to David Aaronberg and Nichola Higgins in the Archbold Review, [...] "therefore, a German business with retail outlets in the UK which pays a bribe in Spain could, in theory at least, face prosecution in the UK". Under Section 7(2), the commercial organisation has a defence if it can show that, while bribery did take place, the commercial organisation had in place [...] "adequate procedures designed to prevent persons associated with [...] from undertaking such conduct". Under the Act's explanatory notes, the burden of proof in this situation is on the organisation, with the standard of proof being [...] "on the balance of probabilities".|$|E
