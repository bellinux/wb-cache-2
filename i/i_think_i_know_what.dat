500|$|Richardson {{began the}} 1960s with a failure. Enid Bagnold's play The Last Joke was savaged by the critics ("a {{meaningless}} jumble of pretentious whimsy" [...] was one description). His {{only reason for}} playing in the piece was the chance of acting with Gielgud, but both men quickly regretted their involvement. Richardson {{then went to the}} US to appear in Sidney Lumet's film adaptation of Long Day's Journey into Night, alongside Katharine Hepburn. Lumet later recalled how little guidance Richardson needed. Once, the director went into lengthy detail about the playing of a scene, and when he had finished, Richardson said, [...] "Ah, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> you want – a little more flute and a little less cello". After that, Lumet was sparing with suggestions. Richardson was jointly awarded the Cannes Film Festival's Best Actor prize with his co-stars Jason Robards Jr and Dean Stockwell.|$|E

6000|$|The little lady's {{eyes grew}} gentle, {{but there was}} a faint smile in them.

I'm going to make your husband stop and speak to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing to you, Miss Affleck? If {{money had}} been left to your mother, it would, I imagine, be {{something}} to you, she being dead.

6000|$|... "What {{does that}} matter, {{if you get}} foxes?" [...] {{continued}} the Master. [...] "But the fact is, gentlemen in a county like this always want to have everything done for them, and never {{to do anything for}} themselves. I'm sick of it, I know.

60|$|But if we {{ever meet}} in the Elysian Fields--where I cannot depict him to myself {{otherwise}} than attended in the distance by his flock of geese (birds sacred to Jupiter)--and he addresses me in the stillness of that passionless region, neither light nor darkness, neither sound nor silence, and heaving endlessly with billowy mists from the impalpable multitudes of the swarming dead, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> answer to make.|$|E

6000|$|Eveline Annersly's eyes sparkled, and her manner was sardonic. [...] "It's {{not very}} explicit, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> you mean.

Men are men--good, bad, and indifferent--the world over, and, though it would be rather nice to believe it, we haven't, and never had, a {{monopoly}} in our own class of what you call the essentials. Indeed, I'm not quite sure one couldn't go a little further." ...|$|E
60|$|Moreover, I {{consider}} myself as qualified {{to write a}} chapter on hotels--not only on the hotels of America, but on hotels generally. I have myself been much too frequently a sojourner at hotels. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> a hotel should be, and what it should not be; and am almost inclined to believe, in my pride, that I could myself fill {{the position of a}} landlord with some chance of social success, though probably with none of satisfactory pecuniary results.|$|E
6000|$|That {{hot wind}} sweeps over Sydney sometimes, and {{brings with it}} {{what is called a}} [...] "dust-storm." [...] It is said that most Australian towns are acquainted with the dust-storm. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> it is like, for the {{following}} description by Mr. Gane tallies very well with the alkali duststorm of Nevada, if you leave out the [...] "shovel" [...] part. Still the shovel part is a pretty important part, and seems to indicate that my Nevada storm is but a poor thing, after all.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, {{she owned}} {{she had a}} trouble, and promised to tell me by-and-by. I said no more, for <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> it," [...] and Jo told her little story.|$|R
