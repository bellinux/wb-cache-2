40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Humboldt State University, Psychology: Academic Research, 2013 Empirical {{evidence}} {{on the benefits of}} nature and the effectiveness of environmental education are increasing, but little evidence examining the effectiveness of environmental education programs with preschool children exists. The current exploratory study examined the effectiveness of a pilot environmental education program, Heroes of the Environment in Training, for increasing environmental knowledge and increasing positive <b>environmental</b> <b>perceptions</b> in preschool children. A total of 107 children at six preschools in rural Northern California participated in the project. Children were individually interviewed before and after the program to assess changes in their <b>environmental</b> knowledge and <b>perceptions.</b> Three preschool classrooms were randomly assigned to receive the program and three were exposed to story time not related to environmental education. Results revealed that the environmental education program was effective in increasing environmental knowledge for boys in the experimental group and for older children regardless of group. While results revealed that the environmental education program did not increase <b>environmental</b> <b>perceptions,</b> preschool children had relatively positive <b>environmental</b> <b>perceptions</b> at time one, which were maintained over time. Girls in general had more positive <b>environmental</b> <b>perceptions</b> at both time one and time two. Past research has shown that extant positive perceptions in young children decline in elementary school. Thus, perhaps program such as the current one can help prevent such decline. These results from the current study can inform educators about how to integrate developmentally and culturally appropriate environmental education at the preschool level and encourages future research on early childhood environmental education and developing better, more psychometrically sound measures...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the working {{mechanisms}} of a computer tailored physical activity intervention for older adults with environmental information compared to a basic tailored intervention without environmental information. Method A clustered randomized controlled trial with two computer tailored interventions and a no-intervention control group was conducted among 1971 adults aged ≥ 50. The two tailored interventions were developed using Intervention Mapping and consisted of three tailored letters delivered over a four-month period. The basic tailored intervention targeted psychosocial determinants alone, while the environmentally tailored intervention additionally targeted environmental determinants, by providing tailored environmental information. Study outcomes were collected with questionnaires at baseline, three and six months and comprised total physical activity (days/week), walking (min/week), cycling (min/week), sports (min/week), <b>environmental</b> <b>perceptions</b> and use and appreciation of the interventions. Results Mediation analyses showed that changes in cycling, sports and total physical activity behaviour induced by the environmentally tailored intervention were mediated by changes in <b>environmental</b> <b>perceptions.</b> Changes in <b>environmental</b> <b>perceptions</b> did not mediate the effect of the basic tailored intervention on behaviour. Compared with the basic tailored intervention, the environmentally tailored intervention significantly improved cycling behaviour (τ = 30. 2). Additionally, the tailored letters of the environmentally tailored intervention were better appreciated and used, although these differences did not mediate the intervention effect. Discussion This study gave some first indications of the relevance of <b>environmental</b> <b>perceptions</b> as a determinant of changing physical activity behaviours and the potential effectiveness of providing environmental information as an intervention strategy aimed at enhancing physical activity behaviour among older adults. </p...|$|R

PA was objectively (accelerometers) and self-reported measured (PA Questionnaire for Children, Patient-centered Assessment and Counseling for Exercise Questionnaire and Finnish PA Index). Linear regression models were used to assess the association of <b>environmental</b> <b>perception</b> with PA. Bivariate logistic regression models were used to assess differences between <b>environmental</b> <b>perception</b> and meeting PA recommendations. <b>Environmental</b> <b>perception</b> was positively associated with both objective and self-reported PA.

Although China is undergoing severe desertification, {{the perceptions of the}} local people toward their degraded environment and the related issues have so far not been actively solicited. This article, which is a supplement to Lee and Zhang's (2004, 2005) studies, seeks to further investigate the lay public's general <b>environmental</b> attitudes, <b>perceptions</b> of desertification, interpretations of land-degrading activities, and particularly their interrelations in severely desertified areas. Minqin County in Gansu Province, northern China, was chosen to be the study area. Data was collected via a questionnaire survey (n = 1138) administered in December 2002. Major findings were: (1) Most respondents had only weak altruistic environmental attitudes, with educational level to be a significant determinant. (2) Respondents' perceptions of desertification and interpretations of land-degrading activities were contingent on personal attributes, general environmental attitudes, and other conceptions related to desertification.

40|$|<b>Environmental</b> <b>perception</b> and {{information}} processing are two key steps of active safety for vehicle reversing. Single-sensor <b>environmental</b> <b>perception</b> cannot meet {{the need for}} vehicle reversing safety due to its low reliability. In this paper, we present a novel multi-sensor <b>environmental</b> <b>perception</b> method using low-rank representation and a particle filter for vehicle reversing safety. The proposed system consists of four main steps, namely multi-sensor <b>environmental</b> <b>perception,</b> information fusion, target recognition and tracking using low-rank representation and a particle filter, and vehicle reversing speed control modules. First of all, the multi-sensor <b>environmental</b> <b>perception</b> module, based on a binocular-camera system and ultrasonic range finders, obtains the distance data for obstacles behind the vehicle when the vehicle is reversing. Secondly, the information fusion algorithm using an adaptive Kalman filter is used to process the data obtained with the multi-sensor <b>environmental</b> <b>perception</b> module, which greatly improves the robustness of the sensors. Then {{the framework of a}} particle filter and low-rank representation is used to track the main obstacles. The low-rank representation is used to optimize an objective particle template that has the smallest L- 1 norm. Finally, the electronic throttle opening and automatic braking is under control of the proposed vehicle reversing control strategy prior to any potential collisions, making the reversing control safer and more reliable. The final system simulation and practical testing results demonstrate the validity of the proposed multi-sensor <b>environmental</b> <b>perception</b> method using low-rank representation and a particle filter for vehicle reversing safety...|$|E

40|$|AbstractGreen {{buildings}} {{are designed to}} have low environmental impacts and improved occupant health and well-being. Improvements to the built environment including ventilation, lighting, and materials have resulted in improved indoor environmental quality (IEQ) in green buildings, but the evidence around occupant health is currently centered around <b>environmental</b> <b>perceptions</b> and self-reported health. To investigate the objective impact of green buildings on health, we tracked IEQ, self-reported health, and heart rate in 30 participants from green and conventional buildings for two weeks. 24 participants were then selected to be relocated to the Syracuse Center of Excellence, a LEED platinum building, for six workdays. While they were there, ventilation, CO 2, and volatile organic compound (VOC) levels were changed on different days to match the IEQ of conventional, green, and green+ (green with increased ventilation) buildings. Participants reported improved air quality, odors, thermal comfort, ergonomics, noise and lighting and fewer health symptoms in green buildings prior to relocation. After relocation, participants consistently reported fewer symptoms during the green building conditions compared to the conventional one, yet symptom counts were more closely associated with <b>environmental</b> <b>perceptions</b> than with measured IEQ. On average, participants had 4. 7 times the odds of reporting a lack of air movement, 43 % more symptoms (p-value =  0. 019) and a 2  bpm higher heart rate (p-value <  0. 001) for a 1000  ppm increase in indoor CO 2 concentration.

40|$|Background: <b>Environmental</b> <b>perceptions</b> {{appear to}} play a role in {{determining}} behaviour in children, although their influence on active commuting remains unclear. This study examines whether attitudes, social support and <b>environmental</b> <b>perceptions</b> are associated with active commuting behaviour in school children and whether these associations are moderated by the distance to school. Methods: Data were collected as part of the SPEEDY study (Sport, Physical activity and Eating behaviour: Environmental Determinants in Young people), a cross-sectional study of 2064 children from schools in Norfolk, UK. Data regarding the usual mode of travel to school, attitudes towards and social support for active commuting, perceptions of the neighbourhood and route to school were assessed using questionnaires completed by 2012 children and their parents. Distance to school was estimated using a Geographic Information System and this was used to compare associations between personal and environmental factors and active travel, across different distance categories. Results: Forty per cent of children reported usually walking to school, with 9 % cycling and the remainder using motorised travel. Parental attitudes and safety concerns, the presence of social support from parents and friends and parent-reported neighbourhood walkability were all found to be predictors of active commuting, with children receiving peer and family support and living in supportive environments being more likely to walk or cycle. There was some evidence of a moderating effect of distance whereby attitudes were more important for short distances and safety concerns long. Conclusion: Both attitudinal and <b>environmental</b> <b>perceptions</b> are associated with children's active commuting behaviours.
