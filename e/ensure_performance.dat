50|$|DDOT was {{originally}} {{known as the}} Division of Transportation, and was a subunit of the District of Columbia Department of Public Works (DPW). The division began suffering from significant deficiencies in the 1990s, including an over-reliance on outside contractors, a lack of expertise with which to oversee contractors and <b>ensure</b> <b>performance</b> and quality work, severe understaffing, and excessive lead times for the letting and implementing of design and construction contracts. These issues led to significant backlogs in maintenance and construction, and {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars in federal funds were unexpended.|$|E
50|$|HLLCAs date {{almost to}} the {{beginning}} of HLLs, in the Burroughs large systems (1961), which were designed for ALGOL 60 (1960), one of the first HLLs. The most well-known HLLCAs are the Lisp machines of the 1970s and 1980s (for Lisp, 1959). At present the most popular HLLCAs are Java processors, for Java (1995), and these are a qualified success, being used for certain applications. A recent architecture in this vein is the Heterogeneous System Architecture (2012), which HSA Intermediate Layer (HSAIL) provides instruction set support for HLL features such as exceptions and virtual functions; this uses JIT to <b>ensure</b> <b>performance.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{practice}} of retainage {{dates back to}} the construction of the United Kingdom railway system in the 1840s. The size of the railway project increased demand for contractors, which led to the entrance of new contractors into the labor market. These new contractors were inexperienced, unqualified and unable to successfully complete the project. Consequently, the railway companies began to withhold as much as 20% of contractors' payments to <b>ensure</b> <b>performance</b> and offset completion costs should the contractor default. The point was to withhold the contractor's profit only, not to make the contractor and its subcontractors finance the project.|$|E
50|$|In an {{enterprise}} server, a Caching SAN Adapter is a host bus adapter (HBA) for {{storage area network}} (SAN) connectivity which accelerates performance by transparently storing duplicate data such that future requests for that data can be serviced faster compared to retrieving {{the data from the}} source. A caching SAN adapter is used to accelerate the performance of applications across multiple clustered or virtualized servers and uses DRAM, NAND Flash or other memory technologies as the cache. The key requirement for the memory technology is that it is faster than the media storing the original copy of the data to <b>ensure</b> <b>performance</b> acceleration is achieved.|$|E
