Sequential changes in the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>magnetization</b> represent binary data bits. The data is read from the disk by detecting the transitions in magnetization.

25|$|Ideally, these {{structures}} {{would be created}} from an infinite length cylinder of magnetic material with the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>magnetization</b> continuously varying. The magnetic flux produced by this ideal design would be perfectly uniform and be entirely confined to either the bore of the cylinder or {{the outside of the}} cylinder. Of course, the ideal case of infinite length is not realizable and in practice the finite length of the cylinders produces end effects which introduce non-uniformities in the field. The difficulty of manufacturing a cylinder with a continuously varying magnetization also usually leads to the design being broken into segments.|$|E
25|$|The <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>magnetization</b> of the wedges in (A) can be {{calculated}} using {{a set of rules}} given by Abele and allows for great freedom {{in the shape of the}} cavity. Another class of design is the magnetic mangle (B), proposed by Coey and Cugat, in which uniformly magnetized rods are arranged such that their magnetization matches that of a Halbach cylinder, as shown for a 6-rod design. This design greatly increases access to the region of uniform field, at the expense of the volume of uniform field being smaller than in the cylindrical designs (although this area can be made larger by increasing the number of component rods). Rotating the rods relative to each other results in many possibilities including a dynamically variable field and various dipolar configurations. It can be seen that the designs shown in (A) and (B) are closely related to the k=2 Halbach cylinder. Other very simple designs for a uniform field include separated magnets with soft iron return paths, as shown in figure (C).|$|E
