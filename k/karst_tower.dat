Karst geomorphology {{plays an important role}} as an analogue of subsurface carbonate reservoir. Karst geomorphology analogue is key elements in the understanding of reservoir structure. <b>Karst</b> <b>tower</b> in Felda Chiku 2, Gua Musang exhibit caves that eventually being called Chiku Cave. The formation of the cave leads to this study. A geological research was carried out in residential and palm tree plantation area in Felda Chiku 1 & 2, Gua Musang. The study covers 5 x 5 kilometre of the area. The objective is to show how effective the carbonate reservoir by implementing the study of karst. The study area which is Felda Chiku 2 has Gua Musang Formation. In conducting this study, tower karst features are being identiﬁed and analysed to get the understanding the processes of karst geomorphology. In completing this research, geomorphological mapping, geomorphological analysis, geological mapping, petrographic analysis and carbonate reservoir characterization methods are being applied. An updated map of the study area has been produced by using ArcGIS vl 0. l to the scale of 1 : 25000. Karst and ﬂuvial geomorphology exists in the study area. Petrographic analysis produce results to identify the rocks exists which are Andesite (igneous), Siltstone (sedimentary), and Limestone (sedimentary). Half of the tower karst can be access meanwhile the others half cannot be access due to no existence of caves on the other side. Chiku 2 Cave represents many types of speleothems to be study.

40|$|Some of {{the most}} {{beautiful}} karst features created by the dissolution of limestones are residual hills with steep or vertical sides rising from a flat plain, known as tower <b>karst.</b> <b>Tower</b> karst to be developed requires a “mean annual temperature of minimum 170 C to 180 C and 1, 000 to 1, 200 mm/m 2 of annual rainfall (Jakucs, 1977). Two sites matching this criteria were selected: the karst of Hoa Quang District, Cao Bang Province, Vietnam, and Tuscumbia, Colbert County, Alabama, U. S. A. Preliminary observations regarding similarities and differences between these two sites are presented in this paper. The Hoa Quang karst area is located in the northern Vietnamese Province of Cao Bang. In 2014, a large number of karst springs, caves, sinking streams, and karst landforms were identified. Eighteen water samples were collected and analyzed for anions, cations, oxygen and hydrogen stable isotope ratios. The pH values are typical for karst waters and ranged from 7. 23 to 7. 97. Specific conductance values ranged from 153. 2 to 421. 6 µS/cm, the total alkalinity as CaCO 3 varies from 125 to 207 mg/L, carbon dioxide varies between 40. 8 and 123. 4 mg/L, whereas the values for the total hardness (as CaCO 3) are between 143 and 220 mg/L. The local meteoric water line, based on our measurements is δ 2 H = 7. 93 (± 0. 10) δ 18 O + 10. 45 (± 0. 86) with r 2 = 0. 998, which is close to the global meteoric water line (GMWL) δ 2 H = 8. 17 δ 18 O + 10. 35 defined by Craig (1961) and revised by Rozanski, et al. (1993). The intercept value differs very slightly from both local and global water lines. Due to the short sampling period, the information provided by the water stable isotopic composition is limited. Carbonate rocks underlie many areas of north Alabama. Karst features can be found around Tuscumbia, in northwestern Alabama, {{which is part of the}} Tennessee-Alabama-Georgia karst area that is called TAG. TAG has the highest concentration of caves in United States, and home for a few large springs. Tuscumbia Spring is a municipal water supply with a base flow of 1, 500 L/s. The field parameters measured in January 2014 were: pH 6. 81, specific conductance 292 uS/cm, and temperature 5. 310 Celsius. In 1989 - 1990, the Geological Survey of Alabama conducted an extensive investigation in the area, performing dye studies in storm water drainage wells (SDW- 1 through SDW- 20) to define the recharge area of Tuscumbia Spring. The storm water drainage wells can be a potential source of contamination for the springs. Two rock samples from Vietnam and one from Tuscumbia, Alabama (U. S. A.) were collected and examined using the X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, microscopic analysis in polarized light and Differential Scanning Calorimetry-Thermogravimetry (DSC–TG) analysis. The quality of limestones in Vietnam and Tuscumbia (38. 7 percent and 39. 6 percent versus 31. 10 percent calcium concentration) and the amount of precipitation (1, 500 to 2, 000 mm/m 2 in Vietnam versus 947 mm/m 2 to 1, 960 mm/m 2 per year in Tuscumbia) are comparable. Thick limestone beds, massively jointed, combined with frequent tectonic uplifts and a complex geologic pattern result in the tower karst landscape in Vietnam versus a leveled landscape in Tuscumbia, Alabama. Tectonics is the primary driver for the formation of tower karst landscape in Cao Bang Province, Vietnam...|$|E

40|$|Albeit {{under various}} names (footcave, slot, cliff-foot cave, shelter, notch) basal indents form in various lithological and climatic environments. But footcaves in {{crystalline}} limestone are especially well and widely developed, {{not only in}} marine environments, but also inland. In the humid tropics, footcaves and swamp slots are associated with surface and shallow groundwaters charged with chemicals and biota. The indents developed around the bases of widely separated <b>karst</b> <b>towers</b> are responsible for their conversion from cupolas or domical residuals. Even in mature <b>tower</b> <b>karst</b> landscapes, some arcuate footcaves are shaped by laterally corrading streams in flood that have transported and deposited exotic debris. Such corrasion is, however, particularly widespread in youthful karst where valley floors are narrow. Here, footcaves not only may have been initiated, but also occasionally maintained, enhanced, and modified by migrating streams, {{as well as by}} scarp-foot weathering and sapping. Microorganisms that colonize moist walls of footcaves may also have contributed. Roy Charles McDonald, C. Rowland Twidal...|$|R

Medium-sized surface features may include sinkholes or cenotes (closed basins), vertical shafts, foibe (inverted funnel shaped sinkholes), disappearing streams, and reappearing springs. Large-scale features may include limestone pavements, poljes, and karst valleys.

In the form analyses, the symmetric products (P) of Tibetan pinnacles present large differences between individual pinnacles.

The closed water catchment structure, which is a basic feature in karst areas, has not been found in the limestone pinnacle areas of Tibet. The results of the form and structure analyses for the Tibetan pinnacles differ from those for tropical and subtropical karst areas.

Depositional environments were interpreted from field and laboratory studies. Previous studies established {{the system as a}} fringing reef in a deep marine back-arc basin.

Results indicate an attached shelf receiving sedimentation from a landward source, due to the presence of quartz sand. Initial reef development in a high-energy environment is indicated by fractured grains. The biologically diverse reef contains massive corals, algae, and foraminifera. The slope contains delicate platy corals and experienced episodic debris-flows. Extinction of the reef is represented by deepwater limestones, indicating platform drowning. The geologic context suggests rapid subsidence. The presence of photosynthetic red algae suggests submergence was not to subphotic depths. Abundant giant foraminifera indicates delayed reproduction under stressed conditions, which may have included cool waters, increased nutrients, algal blooms, and/or influx of sedimentation.

40|$|The overall aim of {{the study}} is to {{investigate}} the environmental characteristics and karst water properties of selected limestone outcrops in Selangor, the Kinta Valley and the North-west region, West Malaysia. The meso-topography, soil and vegetation cover of 13 plots, which encompass the range of weathering environments observed in the limestone hills, are described. Reports are also given on regular measurements of throughfall, litterfall, throughflow, subcutaneous flow, soil moisture, soil carbon dioxide and karst water properties made over a one-year period. Five main conclusions result from the investigation. First, the surface of the limestone hills comprises a mosaic of weathering environments, determined principally by topographic position and rock purity. Each is distinguished by the nature and depth of soil cover, by the characteristics of the vegetation canopy, and by its meso-relief. Secondly, rapid cycling of nutrients, especially potassium and calcium, takes place within the soil/ vegetation system. Thirdly, marked systematic, spatial and temporal variations occur in karst water properties. The most important distinction is between groundwaters, which characteristically display only narrow hardness and temperature fluctuations, and surface waters, which exhibit much greater variability. Fourthly, a high proportion of solution occurs near the surface, and much secondary deposition takes place within the outcrops, especially where, as in the <b>tower</b> <b>karst</b> hills, groundwater flow is generally of low velocity. Variations in net denudation rates, which range from 38. 4 to 81. 0 mm/ 1000 yrs, are largely determined by differences in effective rainfall. Finally, detailed comparisons of the hydrological and denudational processes operative within the contrasted outcrops of the Setul Boundary Range and the <b>tower</b> <b>karst</b> hills suggest that whilst karstification processes under humid tropical conditions seem particularly favourable for the formation and preservation of <b>tower</b> <b>karst</b> hills, dominant vertical and subvertical fractures are normally prerequisite for their development...|$|R

40|$|A {{morphogenetic}} approach {{appears to}} be the most sensible in defining the tiankeng as a typological category. Tiankengs are giant collapse dolines formed over large river caves, with continuous precipitous perimeter and a diameter-to-depth ratio between 0. 5 and 2.

The latter criterion separates tiankengs from other types of giant collapse features, such as caprock collapses over evaporates or large collapses over hydrothermal cavities.

Another pathway to reticulate reefs may be the colonization of reticulate hydrodynamic bedforms by reef builders.

While measurements {{of the magnitude of}} the sink associated with carbonate rock dissolution have assumed that half of the dissolved inorganic carbon leaving a given catchment comes from the mineral and half from the atmosphere, consideration of the kinetics of carbonate mineral dissolution in acid solutions suggests that the ratio is enriched in mineral-source carbon to an extent that depends on the geochemical environment of mineral/fluid contact. After developing a methodology for precise field measurement of both the magnitude of this sink as well as the partitioning of inorganic carbon sources in south central Kentucky, in 2001 we initiated a long-term project to improve understanding and estimates of the sink with a global monitoring network. The first two new stations and methodology are described herein. In addition to the existing Kentucky sites, we are now making high-resolution measurements in the Mineral King Valley, an alpine marble catchment within California 2 ̆ 7 s Sierra Nevada, at an elevation from 2, 400 to 3, 650 m, and at Spring 31 of the Karst Dynamics Laboratory 2 ̆ 7 s experimental research site near Guilin, China. This humid-subtropical site drains an area of peak cluster <b>tower</b> <b>karst</b> at an elevation from 150 to 450 m, and is considerably warmer and wetter than south central Kentucky. For relatively remote sites, the importance of data logging equipment redundancy is becoming clear...|$|R
40|$|The exposed {{carbonate}} rocks aged from Sinian to Mid-Triassic Periods cover {{an area of}} 500, 000 km 2 in south-west China. In karst {{areas with}} spectacular landscapes characterized by magnificent <b>tower</b> <b>karst</b> and conical karst, rare surface drainage systems and prevalent subsurface drainage systems, the environment is ecologically very fragile. The rapid increase of population, over deforested and cultivated lands, worsted the ecological system, causing a higher frequency of draught, flood and various disasters, backward economic development, low living standard of the people. In order to improve the sustainability of the agriculture the experience shows that the following operations should be adopted: (1) serious control of the population increase, emigration, extra labours and improvement of the environmental education of the local inhabitants; (2) terracing of the slopes (shi jala di) as to improve the cultivated land quality, to preserve the water, soil and fertiliser and ameliorate the effective utilisation of the land; (3) development of new rural energies such as the solar energy and gas energy, and expansion of the saving-fuel stoves to reduce the load of bio-energy; (4) reforestation and bounding the hills and mountains; the ecological, economic and fuel forests model has been developed in fengcong-depression areas: the tree species with high ecological, economical and energetic characteristics, should be chosen, such as the bamboo, wild grapes, Sapium rotundifolium etc.; (5) better utilisation of the ram water and karst water resource to solve the water supply problems. The karst landscape is well developed in the 500, 000 km 2 carbonate terrain in Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi, west Hunan and south Sichuan provinces in south-west China, where 100 million habitants live (Song, 1997). The large population and its high density, serious deforestation, over-cultivation and fragile ecological system make the environmental problems very serious and about 30, 000, 000 people are now very poor. This paper describes the measures to improve the ecological and sustainable development of the agriculture in the karst areas...|$|R
40|$|The St. Paul karst (Palawan, Philippines) is a {{tropical}} coastal <b>karst,</b> consisting of <b>towers,</b> cones, huge depressions and large caves. This area hosts the Puerto Princesa Subterranean River (PPSR, 24 ?km long), whose main entrance {{is a large}} spring along the coast and {{which is one of}} the largest cave complexes in eastern Asia. A geomorphological study performed by several field surveys and a morphometric analysis of the digital terrain model (DTM) and 3 D cave models, allowed formulation of a first evolutionary framework of the karst system. The DTM was extracted from maps and aerial photographs in order to find different generations of ‘relict’ landforms, through the morphometric analysis of topographic surface and karst landforms. Several features suggest a long and multi-stage evolution of the karst, whose age ranges from Pliocene to present. The southern and northern sectors of the area differ in their altimetric distribution of caves. In the southern sector, some large caves lie between 300 and 400 ?m?asl and were part of an ancient system that developed at the base level of a past river network. In the northern sector, some mainly vadose caves occur, with a phreatic level at 120 – 130 ?m?asl. An important phase of base-level cave development is well documented in the inactive passages of PPSR at 50 – 80 ?m?asl. Morphological features, such as horizontal solution passages and terraced deposits, suggest a phase of stillstand of the base level, which is recorded in the topography as low-relief surfaces at 40 – 50 ?m?asl. The age of this phase is probably Early Pleistocene, on the basis of assumed uplift rates. The more recent caves are still active, being located at the current sea level, but they show more than one cycle of flooding and dewatering (with calcite deposition). In the PPSR, several morphologic features, such as two main water level notches at + 12 · 4 and + 7 · 7 ?m?asl and terraced alluvial deposits, suggest that the lower and active level passed through more than two high-stands of sea level and so it could have formed throughout most of the Middle-Late Pleistocene.
