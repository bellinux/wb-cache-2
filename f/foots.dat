William Walsingham served {{as a member of the}} commission that was appointed to investigate the estates of Cardinal Thomas Wolsey in 1530, and his elder brother, Sir Edmund Walsingham, was Lieutenant of the Tower of London. After William's death, Joyce married the courtier Sir John Carey in 1538. Carey's brother William was the husband of Mary Boleyn, Anne Boleyn's elder sister. Of Francis Walsingham's five sisters, Mary married Sir Walter Mildmay, who was Chancellor of the Exchequer for over 20 years, and Elizabeth married the parliamentarian Peter Wentworth.|$|E

2500|$|The Rabbit Foot Minstrels, {{organized}} by F. S. Wolcott and based after 1918 in Port Gibson, Mississippi, were {{important not only}} for the development of Cox’s performing career but also for launching the careers of her idols Ma Rainey and Bessie Smith. Known colloquially as the <b>Foots,</b> the troupe provided a nurturing environment in which Cox developed her stage presence, but life on the vaudeville circuit was trying for performers and workers alike. Paul Oliver wrote, in The Story of the Blues, [...] "The 'Foots' travelled in two cars and had an 80' x 110' tent which was raised by the roustabouts and canvassmen, while a brass band would parade in town to advertise the coming of the show....The stage would be of boards on a folding frame and Coleman lanterns – gasoline mantle lamps – acted as footlights. There were no microphones; the weaker voiced singers used a megaphone, but most of the featured women blues singers scorned such aids to volume." [...] When she was not singing, Cox performed as a sharp-witted comedian in vaudeville variety shows, gaining valuable stage experience and cultivating her stage presence.|$|E

Whetstone and Bear creeks enter from the left as the river approaches the site of the former Gold Ray Dam, which was removed in 2010, and a USGS gauge at about [...] from the mouth.

It turns west, flowing between the city of Gold Hill and Route 99 on the right and the Ben Hur Lampman State Scenic Corridor and Interstate 5 (I-5), both on the left, at about RM119 (RK192).

Crossing under I-5, the river flows between [...] it, now on the right, and Highway 99 along the edge of Valley of the Rogue State Park to about RM110 (RK180), where it receives <b>Foots</b> and Birdseye creeks from the left and passes the city of Rogue River, which is on the right bank. Further on, it receives Ward and Evans creeks from the right and Little Savage and Savage creeks from the left. It reaches the site of former Savage Rapids Dam at about RM107.5 (RK173), where it leaves Jackson County and enters Josephine County.
