5|$|John Doggett (Robert Patrick) awakens {{inside an}} {{abandoned}} warehouse {{to find a}} man stealing one of <b>his</b> <b>shoes.</b> Doggett chases the man outside, where he summons two Mexican police officers. One of the policemen hits the man with his nightstick, while the other demands his identification. When Doggett finds he has no papers, the officer asks him his name. Doggett is shocked to realize he can't remember his own identity.|$|E
5|$|The family's {{problems}} are compounded when Kiat Kun accidentally loses Seow Fang's only {{pair of shoes}} after taking them to be repaired. The children conduct a frantic search but find nothing; a karung guni man had claimed the shoes as unwanted rubbish. The Chew siblings are frustrated and rendered helpless by the situation until their father inspires Kiat Kun to share <b>his</b> <b>shoes</b> with his sister, trading off between classes so they can both attend school. Unfortunately, this plan brings additional problems: Seow Fang is chastised for wearing oversized shoes to school, while Kiat Kun is repeatedly late as he must wait for his sister to exchange shoes with him.|$|E
5|$|To address criticisms {{levelled}} at Blyton's work some later editions {{have been}} altered to reflect more liberal attitudes towards {{issues such as}} race, gender and the treatment of children; modern reprints of the Noddy series substitute teddy bears or goblins for golliwogs, for instance. The golliwogs who steal Noddy's car and dump him naked in the Dark Wood in Here Comes Noddy Again are replaced by goblins in the 1986 revision, who strip Noddy only of <b>his</b> <b>shoes</b> and hat and return {{at the end of}} the story to apologise.|$|E

50|$|Herzog once {{promised to}} eat <b>his</b> <b>shoe</b> if Errol Morris {{completed}} the movie project on pet cemeteries {{that he had}} been working on, in order to challenge and motivate Morris, whom Herzog perceived as incapable of following up on the projects he conceived. In 1978, when the film Gates of Heaven premiered, Werner Herzog cooked and publicly ate <b>his</b> <b>shoe,</b> an event later incorporated into a short documentary Werner Herzog Eats <b>His</b> <b>Shoe</b> by Les Blank. At the event, Herzog suggested that he hoped the act would serve to encourage anyone having difficulty bringing a project to fruition.|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} scenes then follow whose exact {{sequence}} is unclear. Odd goes {{to visit his}} mother at the retirement home, which only makes him more unhappy: his mother is senile and spends her days staring emptily out the window, and the visit reminds him of his own impending old age. While Odd is at a restaurant, police come in and arrest the cook. At the shop where he normally buys his pipe tobacco, he learns that the owner has died. He decides to sell his boat, leading to misadventures when the buyer, who works at an airport, asks Odd to meet him there inside the secure zone. Odd goes to the local swimming pool, but <b>his</b> <b>shoes</b> were removed when the facility closed; as he is leaving, he finds a pair of red high-heeled boots and walks away in them.|$|E

Following a week's bed-rest, he rode in the road world championships at the Sachsenring in East Germany. During the race Simpson stopped to adjust <b>his</b> <b>shoes</b> {{on the right side}} of the road and was hit from behind by a car, sustaining a cut to his head which required five stitches. In the last of the classics, the Giro di Lombardia, he struggled, finishing eighty-fourth. Simpson had been in constant contact with Helen, who was now working in Stuttgart, Germany, meeting with her between races. They became engaged on Christmas Day, and originally planned to marry at the end of 1961, but in fact wed on 3 January 1961 in Doncaster, Yorkshire.|$|E

Returning home in the morning of the following day from a night time recording session with The Beach Boys, Wilson was unexpectedly greeted in the driveway of the residence by the Family's leader, Charles Manson. At first, Wilson was frightened by Manson, but Manson assured him he came with no intent to harm Wilson and began kissing <b>his</b> <b>shoes.</b> The two struck a friendship and, over the next few months, members of the Manson Familymostly women who were treated as servantswere housed at Wilson's Sunset Boulevard household, reportedly costing him approximately $100,000 (U.S.).|$|E

Word of the natural spring spread quickly and before long, the area became popular among the wealthy plantation owners and by the late 1800s a small town was established.|$|R

5|$|His {{schedule}} in the Olympics was busy. Along with the decathlon and pentathlon, he {{competed in the}} long jump and high jump. The first competition was the pentathlon. He won four of the five events and placed third in the javelin, an event he had not competed in before 1912. Although the pentathlon was primarily decided on place points, points were also earned for the marks achieved in the individual events. He won the gold medal. That same day, he qualified for the high jump final in which he placed fourth, and also took seventh place {{in the long jump}}. Even more remarkably, because someone had stolen <b>his</b> <b>shoes</b> just before he was due to compete, he found some discarded ones in a rubbish bin and won his medals wearing them.|$|E
5|$|Once {{out of the}} hospital, Johnny Sack's {{daughter}} gets {{married and}} the Soprano family attends.

Before the wedding, Johnny Sack is approved to leave prison for six hours to see his daughter get married, but {{has to pay for}} the metal detectors and the presence of the U.S. marshals at the event. As his daughter is about to drive away, the SUV that was escorting Johnny to the wedding blocks the car from leaving and an altercation begins in the driveway. In a moment of weakness and despair, Johnny Sack cries as he is put back into handcuffs and driven back to prison, greatly diminishing the respect his crew and Tony's crew have for him.|$|E

At Cerie's wedding, Wesley is distraught that Liz ended their engagement through a text message she sent to him. Liz tells him that fate brought them together so that she would meet Carol, with whom she can see herself spending the rest of her life. Wesley is devastated and leaves. Unbeknownst to Liz, Carol, who Liz thought had stepped out from the party area, heard everything she told Wesley, which shocks Carol, prompting him to leave. At the same time, at Cerie's wedding, Nancy learns that Avery is pregnant after having a conversation with her in the ladies room, and tells Jack before she leaves him.

5|$|Georges, the {{youngest}} of eight children, was born on , 1887, in Chicoutimi, Quebec, to Jacques Vézina, a local baker and an immigrant from St. Nicolas de La Rochelle in France, and his wife Clara. Georges attended school at the Petit Séminaire de Chicoutimi {{until the age of}} fourteen, when he left the school to help at his father's bakery. He played hockey from a young age, participating in informal street hockey matches with others his own age. Vézina partook in these matches in <b>his</b> <b>shoes,</b> and used skates {{for the first time at}} age 16 when he joined the local team in Chicoutimi. As Chicoutimi was in a remote area of Quebec, more than 200 kilometres from Quebec City, the hockey club was not in any organised league. Rather the club, known as the Saguenéens ("People from the Saguenay", the region where Chicoutimi is located), toured the province, playing exhibition games against a variety of clubs.|$|E
5|$|Emily, {{disguised}} as her twin sister Katie, arrives at college to take Katie's history exam. In reality, Katie is at home, with nine stitches {{to the head}} after being hit with a rock by their friend Effy Stonem, who has disappeared. Katie is embarrassed about how her injuries look, and miserable {{over the loss of}} her boyfriend Freddie Mclair (Luke Pasqualino), who only dated her to spite Effy, his real love interest. She begins to take notice of all the hints in front of her, and realises that she can no longer hide from herself the fact that Emily is homosexual. At college, Naomi uncovers Emily's disguise (which had not fooled JJ or Freddie either) and tells her that she plans to spend the summer alone in Cyprus. When Emily tells Naomi that she will miss her, they kiss in an empty corridor and later find themselves at Naomi's house where they have sex. Afterward, Emily asks Naomi to the college ball, but Naomi, still crippled by insecurity over her sexuality, refuses, leaving Emily heartbroken. Emily leaves and at the bus stop meets Thomas Tomone (Merveille Lukeba), who offers her <b>his</b> <b>shoes</b> and jacket and is unconcerned when she tells him that she is gay. He tries to comfort her but admits that he believes it impossible to stop loving somebody, referring to his ex-girlfriend Pandora Moon (Lisa Backwell). Emily returns home and comes out to her family, telling them that she has been having sex with a girl named Naomi. Her father, Rob (John Bishop), dismisses it as a joke and her mother, Jenna (Ronni Ancona), is speechless, while Katie tries to deny it. She and Emily have a heated argument, leaving Katie crying.|$|E
