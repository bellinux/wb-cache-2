30|$|The <b>handover</b> <b>failure</b> {{probability}} versus {{movement time}} duration t {{is shown in}} Fig.  4 c. For a given number of RF-UE, more handovers result {{in an increase in}} the activity of the uplink queue which results in a longer handover delay and hence a higher likelihood of <b>handover</b> <b>failure.</b> In addition, the rate of blocking and recovery of VLC LOS links increases with increasing movement time duration. Since the mean blocking and non-blocking time affect the decision making in the Q-VHO scheme, there are fewer handovers when the movement duration is greater than 2 s. The number of VHOs increases between t= 1 s and t= 2 s since in the Q-VHO scheme, the benefits of a handover dominate the handover cost. Therefore, the <b>handover</b> <b>failure</b> probability for the Q-VHO scheme increases between t= 1 s and t= 2 s due to the increase in the utilization of the uplink queue. In all cases, however, the <b>handover</b> <b>failure</b> probability of the Q-VHO scheme is the smallest. Additionally, when t increases, the UE makes more transitions between the VLC and the RF in the I-VHO and D-VHO schemes. Consequently, the <b>handover</b> <b>failure</b> probability increases in the I-VHO and D-VHO schemes. However, for our Q-VHO scheme, the movement time duration is inversely proportional to the <b>handover</b> <b>failure</b> probability initially and remains stable when t> 2 s because the Q-VHO reduces the number of handover requests when it is connected to a secured network, where the handover cost is greater than the handover benefit. As the velocity increases from 0.3 to 0.7 m/s, the frequency of VLC channel fluctuation increases sharply. Hence, the I-VHO approach triggers the largest number of VHOs and results in the largest <b>handover</b> <b>failure</b> probability of the three VHO schemes, as shown in Fig.  4 d. For D-VHO, the longer the waiting time is, the fewer the handovers. For Q-VHO, the number of handovers decreases as velocity increases because the cost of a handover outweighs the benefits. Therefore, the <b>handover</b> <b>failure</b> probability decreases as the velocity increases. Our scheme outperforms the other schemes with respect to the failure probability.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a vertical handover decision (VHD) scheme for optimizing {{the efficiency of}} vertical handover processes in the Fourth Generation (4 G) heterogeneous wireless networks. The scheme consists of three closely integrated modules: Handover necessity estimation, handover target selection, and handover triggering condition estimation. Handover necessity estimation module determines whether a handover is necessary to an available network. Handover target selection module chooses the ``best'' network among the available candidates based {{on a set of}} criteria. Finally, handover triggering condition estimation module determines the right moment to initiate a handover out of the currently connected network. 4 G wireless networks are expected to support mechanisms for tight integration and cooperation of divergent access network technologies. In such networks of heterogeneous nature, roaming users will experience frequent handovers across network boundaries. Thus, to ensure seamless roaming and efficient resource usage over dissimilar networks, intelligent VHD algorithms need to be used extensively. The research project presented in this thesis report focuses on this problem and provides an optimized VHD scheme, which minimizes the <b>handover</b> <b>failures,</b> unnecessary <b>handovers</b> and connection breakdowns whilst maintaining users' satisfaction at high levels. In addition, the scheme also provides mechanisms for mobile applications to control the tradeoff between the usage of the preferred access network and number of handovers or connection breakdowns. Simulation based performance evaluations demonstrate that the scheme reduces the number of <b>handover</b> <b>failures,</b> unnecessary <b>handovers</b> and connection breakdowns by up to 80 %, 70 % and 70 %, respectively.

40|$|Inadequate {{handover}} is a {{major contributor}} to patient harm events. Studies to date have predominantly focused on inter-shift handovers. Current knowledge on the nature of <b>handover</b> <b>failures</b> associated with inpatient transfers is scanty. There is also little evidence to support the effectiveness of handover interventions to date. One major barrier is the lack of systematic frameworks to promote rigour in the design and evaluation of interventions. The aims of the thesis are threefold. First, since handover associated with inpatient transfers is poorly understood, the thesis aims to address this existing knowledge gap. The nature and effect of <b>handover</b> <b>failures</b> during this transition of care is explored through three complementary methods: systematic review of literature, analysis of critical incidents, and observational study of inpatient transfers. Second, since interventions to date lack methodological rigour, this thesis explores the feasibility of applying quantitative risk analysis (QRA), adapted from high-risk industries, to evaluate the inpatient transfer process. Fault tree analysis is used to examine the genesis of errors, and reliability analysis is applied to assess process reliability. Finally, the thesis explores the use of signal detection theory (SDT) {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} handover. To achieve these objectives, one specific error is explored in-depth &# 150; non-adherence to infection control precautions when transferring an inpatient to radiology. Observations were carried out at a hospital. QRA and SDT were then applied to identify weaknesses in the transfer process. Results of the analyses guided the design of two interventions: (1) a pre-transfer checklist; (2) a coloured cue to highlight infection control information in the transfer form. The interventions were tested in a randomised control trial, and significant improvements in the compliance with infection control precautions were recorded. The use of checklist improved compliance rate from 38 % to 71 % (p< 0. 01), and the coloured cue improved compliance rate to 73 % (p< 0. 01). When both interventions were applied, compliance rate reached 74 % (p< 0. 01). This thesis demonstrates the importance of a systematic approach to evaluating clinical processes. Through the example of inpatient transfers, the value of QRA and SDT are validated.

Furthermore, for a train with hundreds of passengers, {{a large amount of}} handover requests in a short time may easily leads to signaling congestions. To address this issue, there are numerous interests in adopting LTE-based mobile relays dedicated for high speed train scenario [12] where user traffics are aggregated by a mobile relay fixed {{on the top of a}} train carriage and then communicated to the track side base stations (BS). The system only needs to maintain one high-mobility link between the mobile relay and the track-side BS, e.g. the mobile backhaul, instead of hundreds of individual access links. Mobile relay can reduce the possibility of signaling congestions, but it still requires a large overlapped cell boundary area for smooth handovers.|$|R
