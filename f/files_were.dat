5|$|A {{series of}} eight young adult books {{entitled}} The Blair Witch <b>Files</b> <b>were</b> released by Random subsidiary Bantam from 2000 to 2001. The books center on Cade Merill, a fictional cousin of Heather Donahue, who investigates phenomena {{related to the}} Blair Witch in attempt to discover what really happened to Heather, Mike, and Josh.|$|E
5|$|Documentation of records, {{including}} the members' deliberations, {{are kept in}} the committee’s archives, which are deposited with the British Trust for Ornithology. Some older data is missing, as the committee's <b>files</b> <b>were</b> originally held by the editors of British Birds, {{and they were not}} transferred to the new owners of the magazine when it was sold in the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Peter McConnell {{announced}} that the game's soundtrack would be fully orchestrated through performances of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra for the remastered version of the game being released in 2015. After the original Pro Tools sound <b>files</b> <b>were</b> recovered, McConnell found {{that some of the}} samples he had used originally did not sound good, and the team opted to re-orchestrate the score.|$|E
30|$|Assume {{that there}} is a series of files in a version chain, e.g., {V 1.1,V 1.2,V 1.2. 1,V 2.1,V 2.1. 1,V 2.2,V 3.1,V 3.2,V 3.2. 1,...}. Referring to the common version files’ storage methods, they can be stored by the {{incremental}} storage (e.g., subversion) or the inverse incremental storage (e.g., git). If these <b>files</b> <b>are</b> stored by the former, the earliest version <b>file</b> <b>is</b> the base version, and the successor version <b>files</b> <b>are</b> stored by the incremental storage. If these <b>files</b> <b>are</b> stored by the latter, the latest version <b>file</b> <b>is</b> the base version, and the predecessor version <b>files</b> <b>are</b> stored by the inverse incremental storage. Thus, for the former, if any version <b>file</b> <b>is</b> corrupted, the full content of version <b>files</b> cannot <b>be</b> recovered. In this case, the security of version <b>files</b> <b>is</b> poor. For the latter, even though the security of version <b>files</b> <b>is</b> improved, the storage space of version data is increased. Especially, the security of version data is weakened while there <b>are</b> many version <b>files</b> and each version <b>file</b> <b>is</b> only randomly extracted in each verification.|$|R
50|$|When a <b>file</b> <b>is</b> {{recovered}} successfully, PhotoRec {{checks the}} previous data blocks {{to see whether}} a <b>file</b> signature <b>was</b> found but the <b>file</b> <b>was</b> not able to be successfully recovered (i.e., the <b>file</b> <b>was</b> too small), and it tries again. This way, some fragmented <b>files</b> can <b>be</b> successfully recovered.|$|R

5|$|A major {{complication}} in remastering {{the original}} work was having {{many of the}} critical game files go missing or on archaic formats. A large number of backup <b>files</b> <b>were</b> made on Digital Linear Tape (DLT) which Disney/LucasArts {{had been able to}} recover for Double Fine, but the company had no drives to read the tapes. Former LucasArts sound engineer Jory Prum had managed to save a DLT drive and was able to extract all of the game's audio development data from the tapes.|$|E
5|$|The hospital's {{design was}} criticised for not {{providing}} {{space for the}} storage of medical files. It was expected that all files would be stored electronically within five years. In the meantime, the paper medical <b>files</b> <b>were</b> transferred {{to the site of}} the old Falkirk Royal Infirmary. An old X-ray department at the hospital was decontaminated and converted into a storage department at a cost of £40,000, and a taxi company was contracted to move the records between sites.|$|E
5|$|Between 1970 and 1975, {{advisories}} for {{systems in}} the eastern Pacific basins were initiated by the Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center (EPHC) {{as part of the}} National Weather Service (NWS) office in San Francisco, California. At that time, the advisories released were written in cooperation with the United States Navy Fleet Weather Center in Alameda and the Air Force Hurricane Liaison Officer at the McClellan Air Force Base. Following the move of the hurricane center to Redwood City in 1976, track <b>files</b> <b>were</b> created and altered by Arthur Pike and were later re-modified following the release of a study in 1980. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) extended its authority to the EPHC in 1988, and subsequently began maintaining the tracks.|$|E

5|$|Schafer noted at {{the time}} of Grim Fandango {{original}} development, retention of code was not as rigorous as present day standards, and in some cases, Schafer believes the only copies of some <b>files</b> <b>were</b> unintentionally taken by employees when they had left LucasArts. As such, Schafer and his team have been going back through past employee records to try to trace down any of them and ask for any files they may have saved. In other cases, they have had difficulty in identifying elements on the low-resolution artwork of the original game, such as an emblem on one character's hat, and have had to go looking for original concept art to figure out the design.|$|E
5|$|The first {{official}} trial {{for war crimes}} committed at Treblinka was held in Düsseldorf between 12 October 1964 and 24 August 1965, preceded by the 1951 trial of SS-Scharführer Josef Hirtreiter, which was triggered by charges of war crimes unrelated to his service at the camp. The trial was delayed because the United States and the Soviet Union had lost interest in prosecuting German war crimes {{with the onset of}} the Cold War. Many of the more than 90,000 Nazi war criminals recorded in German <b>files</b> <b>were</b> serving in positions of prominence under West German chancellor Konrad Adenauer. In 1964 and 1965 eleven former SS camp personnel were brought to trial by West Germany, including commandant Kurt Franz. He was sentenced to life imprisonment, along with Artur Matthes (Totenlager) and Willi Mentz and August Miete (both from Lazaret). Gustav Münzberger (gas chambers) received 12 years, Franz Suchomel (gold and money) 7 years, Otto Stadie (operation) 6 years, Erwin Lambert (gas chambers) 4 years, and Albert Rum (Totenlager) 3 years. Otto Horn (corpse detail) was acquitted.|$|E

50|$|Vedit {{uses its}} own <b>file</b> {{buffering}} which <b>is</b> {{faster than the}} virtual memory of Windows.In addition, it uses very little of Windows' resources.When editing large files, {{only part of the}} <b>file</b> <b>is</b> loaded in the memory at a time and temporary <b>files</b> <b>are</b> created only as needed.Thus, dozens of gigabyte <b>files</b> can <b>be</b> open simultaneously on 32-bit Windows, and even a multi-gigabyte <b>file</b> <b>is</b> opened in a fraction of a second.|$|R
25|$|From 1930 to 1959, the {{majority}} collection of Defence UFO <b>files</b> <b>were</b> held at HQ Southern Air, G Block, Albert Part Barracks, Melbourne, with Army Intelligence. After 1959, the <b>files</b> <b>were</b> moved to RAAF Headquarters, Support Command, Victoria Barracks, Victoria Intelligence Cell, within the main building. These case <b>files</b> <b>were</b> {{controlled by the}} Australian Army through the Australian Army Intelligence Corps staff within the Australian Intelligence system, and they played a principal role in the field investigation of any UFO phenomenon in Australia. However, the Army kept a low public profile but filtered reports for action. All departments' Central Offices were located in Melbourne, Victoria, between 1930 and 1969. Then due to government restructure, a majority of departments moved to Canberra. The main collection of UFO files stayed in Victoria until 1989 later going to Canberra or the National Archives of Australia.|$|E
25|$|In 1968, the FBI {{formally}} {{closed their}} {{investigation into the}} bombing without filing charges against any of their named suspects. The <b>files</b> <b>were</b> sealed by order of J. Edgar Hoover.|$|E

50|$|In GFS, most <b>files</b> <b>are</b> {{modified}} by appending new data and not overwriting existing data. Once written, the <b>files</b> <b>are</b> usually only read sequentially rather than randomly, {{and that makes}} this DFS the most suitable for scenarios in which many large <b>files</b> <b>are</b> created once but read many times.|$|R
25|$|Scotland Yard's {{files on}} the case and also those of the DPP, were to be closed until 2033. This was an unusual decision, {{considering}} the advanced age of the suspect, witnesses and others involved in the case. The <b>files</b> <b>were</b> {{opened to the public}} after special permission was granted in 2003.|$|E
25|$|In February 2014, Kaspersky {{identified}} the malware Mask, which infected 380 organizations in 31 countries. Many organizations that were affected were in Morocco. Some of the <b>files</b> <b>were</b> in Spanish {{and the group}} {{is believed to be}} a nation-state conducting espionage, but Kaspersky did not speculate on which country may have developed it.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of this}} thawing of relations, on 28 April, 18 {{days after}} the crash, Russia's state Archive {{publicly}} published a number of previously secret files on the Katyn massacre on their website. The <b>files</b> <b>were</b> declassified in the early 1990s, but before their publication they were only available to specialized researchers.|$|E
30|$|Our {{investigation}} {{shows that}} these are the structural paths whose presence in a <b>file</b> <b>is</b> most indicative that the <b>file</b> <b>is</b> benign or alternatively, whose absence indicates that a <b>file</b> <b>is</b> malicious. For example, malicious <b>files</b> <b>are</b> not likely to contain metadata in order to minimize file size, they do not jump to a page in the document when it is opened and are not well-formed so they are missing paths such as /Type and /Pages/Count.|$|R

25|$|At {{the time}} the verdict was that the group members all died because of a {{compelling}} natural force. The inquest officially ceased in May 1959 {{as a result of}} the absence of a guilty party. The <b>files</b> <b>were</b> sent to a secret archive, and the photocopies of the case became available only in the 1990s, although some parts were missing.|$|E
