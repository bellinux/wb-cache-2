40|$|In delay {{tolerant}} network (DTN), an end-to-end path is {{not guaranteed}} and packets are delivered {{from a source}} node to a destination node via store-carry-forward based routing. In DTN, a source node or an intermediate node stores packets in buffer and carries them while it moves around. These packets are forwarded to other nodes based on predefined criteria and finally are delivered to a destination node via multiple hops. In this paper, we improve the dissemination speed of PRoPHET (probability routing protocol using history of encounters and transitivity) protocol by employing epidemic protocol for disseminating message m, if forwarding counter and <b>hop</b> <b>counter</b> values are smaller {{than or equal to}} the threshold values. The performance of the proposed protocol was analyzed from the aspect of delivery probability, average delay, and overhead ratio. Numerical results show that the proposed protocol can improve the delivery probability, average delay, and overhead ratio of PRoPHET protocol by appropriately selecting the threshold forwarding counter and threshold <b>hop</b> <b>counter</b> values...|$|E
30|$|Authors in [14] {{investigate}} the content-centric networking paradigm in vehicular environments, and they design a CCVN framework, which {{relies on the}} main CCN pillars. Without using a completed broadcast method, CCVN enforces a simple counter-based approach coupled with deferred transmission timers and interest retransmission routines. Firstly, it divides Interest packets into B-Int and A-Int upon different functions. When there is an Interest, the requester uses a B-Int packet to locate the producers and then chooses a preferable content node to ask for series of data with an A-Int. Moreover, Interest forwarding in CCVN {{is no longer a}} completed broadcasting mechanism, and nodes forward a packet based on a counter; an Interest packet would be broadcast only the first time it is received. To ensure transmission reliability, CCVN also designs a timer for each Interest to deal with retransmission and prevent data loss. The design idea of CCVN is similar to our RSBLQ to a certain degree: we both think packet flooding is not a suitable way for VANET, and we choose to take advantage of FIB structure to choose several stable routing paths for Interest, but CCVN uses a <b>hop</b> <b>counter</b> as a broadcast limitation. But it is not enough, a <b>hop</b> <b>counter</b> can only decrease the broadcast range, which can also result in useless traffic.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we propose}} a routing {{technique}} to alleviate packet loss due to transient link failures, which are major causes of disruption in the Internet. The proposed technique based on Alternate Next <b>Hop</b> <b>Counters</b> (ANHC) allows routers to calculate backup paths and re-route packets accordingly, thereby bypassing transient failures. This technique guarantees full repair coverage for single link failures, without significantly {{changing the way}} traditional routing works and with minimal impact on the computation and memory requirements for routers. We evaluate the performance of our proposed ANHC approach through extensive simulations and show that the stretch of its pre-computed alternate paths, its failure-state link load increase, and its computational and memory overheads are minimal...|$|R
40|$|Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs) is a {{promising}} current research field that have captured {{a lot of}} attention. In DTN, an end-to-end path is not assured and packets are transmitted from a source node to a destination node {{by the use of}} store-carry-forward based routing. In case of DTN, a source node or an intermediary node accumulates the packets in its buffer and holds them at the time of moving around in the network. In the majority of routing protocols, each node is necessary to truthfully pass on information. On the other hand, in certain scenarios few nodes possibly will break this principle, and pass on information in a greedy manner with the intention of maximizing their individual gain. The majority of the current security mechanism doesn‟t depend on the practice of swarm intelligence based process for selection of untrusted nodes and recognizes the behaviour of illegal nodes. With the aim of solving this complication, this work employs the practice of swarm intelligence method, an Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) based greedy behaviour, in order to match the messages where a smart Mobile Trusted Module (MTM) is launched to supervise the forwarding progression of messages buffered in the node for the purpose of preventing the greedy behaviour. The performance of the proposed protocol was assessed in terms of average relay time, average message delivery ratio and reward ratio. Results confirm that the proposed protocol can onsiderably enhance the average message delivery ratio, diminished delay time and condensed packet overhead ratio by properly selecting the threshold values of forwarding counter and threshold <b>hop</b> <b>counter.</b> Keywords: Delay tolerant networks, Greedy behaviour, Mobile truste...|$|E

Although the Wolfpac proved popular with fans, the overall nWo storyline {{began to grow}} stale: As with the {{culmination}} of the Sting/Hogan match, fans grew tired of the lack of any kind of resolution, as many matches between the groups simply ended in disqualifications when other members jumped into the ring to interfere, leading to all-out brawls. Ted Turner decided to expand the brand by introducing a second weekly program WCW Thunder, on his TBS channel. The introduction of Thunder troubled Eric Bischoff, who warned Turner that a second weekly program could potentially result in fan burnout, as viewing both programs would require five hours of viewing time a week.|$|R
40|$|Although it {{is widely}} known that the Internet is not prone to random failures, {{unplanned}} failures due to attacks can be very damaging. This prevents many organisations from deploying beneficial operations through the Internet. In general, the data is delivered from a source to a destination via a series of routers (i. e routing path). These routers employ routing protocols to compute best paths based on routing information they possess. However, when a failure occurs, the routers must re-construct their routing tables, which may take several seconds to complete. Evidently, most losses occur during this period. IP Fast Re-Route (IPFRR), Multi-Topology (MT) routing, and overlays are examples of solutions proposed to handle network failures. These techniques alleviate the packet losses to different extents, yet none have provided optimal solutions. This thesis focuses on identifying the fundamental routing problem due to convergence process. It describes the mechanisms of each existing technique {{as well as its}} pros and cons. Furthermore, it presents new techniques for fast re-routing as follows. Enhanced Loop-Free Alternates (E-LFAs) increase the repair coverage of the existing techniques, Loop-Free Alternates (LFAs). In addition, two techniques namely, Full Fast Failure Recovery (F 3 R) and fast re-route using Alternate Next <b>Hop</b> <b>Counters</b> (ANHC), offer full protection against any single link failures. Nevertheless, the former technique requires significantly higher computational overheads and incurs longer backup routes. Both techniques are proved to be complete and correct while ANHC neither requires any major modifications to the traditional routing paradigm nor incurs significant overheads. Furthermore, in the presence of failures, ANHC does not jeopardise other operable parts of the network. As emerging applications require higher reliability, multiple failures scenarios cannot be ignored. Most existing fast re-route techniques are able to handle only single or dual failures cases. This thesis provides an insight on a novel approach known as Packet Re-cycling (PR), which is capable of handling any number of failures in an oriented network. That is, packets can be forwarded successfully as long as a path between a source and a destination is available. Since the Internet-based services and applications continue to advance, improving the network resilience will be a challenging research topic for the decades to come...|$|R
40|$|Hip <b>hop</b> is a <b>counter</b> {{cultural}} movement {{that emerged in}} the 1970 s in the South Bronx; it has since grown to be a global movement. It is a counter culture that emerges in the post-segregated, post-industrial, and globalized world. Since 2002, archival collections that document hip hop have manifested within academic institutions. Placing hip hop in academic institutions that have historically served as manifestations of hegemony can lead to codification and commodification. This case study examines the University of Houston Hip Hop Collection and explains the establishment of the archive using the cultural competence framework. It concludes that staff at the University of Houston is culturally competent. The case study suggests that building culturally competent archivists can be tool to ensuring representation within an archive of all facets of society...|$|R
30|$|Three steps, {{localization}} {{information exchange}} phase for obtaining <b>hop</b> <b>counters,</b> average <b>hop</b> distance computation phase for every anchor, and estimated position phase using trilateration or maximum likelihood estimation method, are firstly proposed by Niculescu and Nath in [25, 26]. An improved DV-hop {{algorithm is proposed}} in [27] to reduce location error accumulated over multiple hops by using a differential error correction scheme. Difference or error between estimated distance of two anchors and actual distance of these anchors is calculated, and this error can be generalized to calculate estimated error of distance between unknown node and its nearest anchor. DV-Loc algorithm is proposed in [28], which is designed by use of Voronoi diagrams to limit the scope of flooding and error of computed positions to improve localization accuracy, that is, through improving accuracy of hop count. Anchors are previously divided into several levels. A Voronoi diagram {{is built based on}} position information of the first-level anchors firstly. Then, the second-level anchors compute average size of a hop like DV-hop. Other levels of anchors repeated these two steps until all levels of anchors are used. DDV-hop [29] and RDV-hop [30] localization schemes are proposed based on DV-hop algorithm, using a weighting method to determine a weighted distance-per-hop value for each normal node, which consumes additional energy for obtaining differential error or network topology separately. An advanced DV-hop (ADV-hop) localization scheme [31] uses the hop size of anchors, from which unknown node measures distance between anchors or between unknown node and anchors. Inherent error in estimated distance between anchor and unknown node is reduced in the third step of ADV-hop, and WLS algorithm is used, in which weight factor is set as the inverse of the minimum number of hops between unknown node and an anchor. And locations are refined by using extraneous information obtained by solving mathematical equations. A threshold M is introduced in [32], which uses weighted average hop distance of anchors within M hops, not all anchors in networks of original DV-hop scheme, to calculate average hop distance of unknown nodes, and location results are corrected of this DV-hop based scheme. HDV-hop (hybrid DV-hop) is proposed in [33] to obtain high localization accuracy and minimize flooding, and then reduce energy consumption, in which anchors are deployed only on the perimeter of WSN and not inside it. In the first step of HDV-hop, sensor S maintains HopCounti in a table called the HopCountsTable, and S maintains ID of one-hop neighbor from which it has received the minimum HopCount value, referring to this minimum value as GlobalMinimum, the neighbor that delivered this value to S as GlobalMinimumNeighbor. In the second step of HDV-hop, energy-expensive flooding phase is eliminated and each anchor sends its calculated average hop length to the base station via the RingofAnchors. A trilateration algorithm is executed by a powerful base station instead of individual sensors, and an iterative method to solve NLLS problem. Because of anchors are located on the perimeter of network, unknown node can consume lots of energy to establish or maintain DV-hop calculation chains.|$|R
40|$|This study {{involves}} the preparation and optimization of polymer inclusion membranes (PIMs) {{based on the}} polymer cellulose triacetate and the extractant (carrier) Aliquat 336 (a mixture of quaternary ammonium chlorides) for the transport of inorganic As species (arsenite and arsenate) from their aqueous solutions. The influence of {{the composition of the}} membranes on its extraction and transport properties was investigated. Better membrane performance was obtained when the membranes did not contain plasticizer and the concentration of the extractant was high. Under these conditions arsenate (As(V)) could be quantitatively separated from As(III) within 5 h even in the presence of common anions (i. e. chloride, phosphate, nitrate, sulfate and carbonate) often encountered in natural waters and industrial and domestic wastewaters. Electrical impedance spectroscopy measurements allowed the determination of the dielectric constant and conductivity values of the PIMs of interest. These results suggested that the extracted As(V) species was HAsO 4 2 - which was further transported across the membrane by a <b>hopping</b> mechanism, <b>counter</b> currently to the transport of the chloride anions present at a high concentration in the stripping solution. The overall performance of the proposed PIM in terms of stability, selectivity and permeability compared favorably to those of an Aliquat 336 based supported liquid membrane and a commercial multi-valent anion exchange membraneThis work was supported by the Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Inovación, through Project (CTM 2008 - 06847 -C 02 02 /TECNO).
