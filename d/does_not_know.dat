5|$|The {{theme of}} a heroine {{moving to a}} strange place where she <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> the local {{language}} is replicated in Ratnam's later films, Roja (1992) and Bombay (1995).

60|$|Perhaps it was {{the mystery}} which hung about her that kept her in my mind. I <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> where she was. I <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> how she fared. I <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> what sort of a man it was whom she had {{preferred}} to me. That, it struck me, was {{the crux of the}} matter.
