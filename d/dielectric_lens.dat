50|$|Andrea Neto {{from the}} TU Delft- Delft University of Technology, Delft, Netherlands was named Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) in 2016 for {{contributions}} to <b>dielectric</b> <b>lens</b> antennas and wideband arrays.|$|E
50|$|Likewise, {{the concept}} of using certain {{constructed}} materials as a method for manipulating electromagnetic waves {{dates back to the}} 19th century. Microwave theory had developed significantly during {{the latter part of the}} 19th century with the cylindrical parabolic reflector, <b>dielectric</b> <b>lens,</b> microwave absorbers, the cavity radiator, the radiating iris, and the pyramidal electromagnetic horn.The science involving microwaves also included round, square, and rectangular waveguides precluding Sir Rayleigh's published work on waveguide operation in 1896. Microwave optics, involving the focusing of microwaves, introduced quasi-optical components, and a treatment of microwave optics was published in 1897 (by Righi).|$|E
40|$|Focusing {{properties}} {{of a new}} kind of plasmonic lenses are investigated in the visible wavelength range through a subwavelength metallic chirped slit arrays which have the same depth but chirped widths. The chirped widths of slits are like a piece-wise-linear distribution which will be approximated by linearly increasing the width of a subwavelength feature and can build up a required phase front for focusing. We analyzed the focusing characteristics of different metallic lenses (silver and gold, respectively) with chirped widths that are obtained by generalizing the relevant phase delay for TE- and TM-polarized incident waves, for different f-numbers of lenses and for different material thickness, respectively. Meanwhile, the comparison of the metallic and <b>dielectric</b> <b>lenses</b> is also presented. The results of calculations show that, the metallic lenses are more sensitive to the polarization of incidence wave than that of <b>dielectric</b> <b>lenses,</b> and can get narrower full-width half-maximum (FWHM) beam width than that of <b>dielectric</b> <b>lenses</b> for TM-polarized incident waves, respectively. No matter which f-number we choose, the FWHM of <b>dielectric</b> <b>lenses</b> are higher than the plasmonic lenses, and the plasmonic lenses can get a higher focal resolution than <b>dielectric</b> <b>lenses</b> do. This kind of plasmonic lenses should have a good potential for applications in photonic and plasmonic integrated devices, sensing, and nano-optical manipulations, etc...|$|R

50|$|Because {{the radio}} waves travel in narrow beams {{confined}} to a line-of-sight path from one antenna to the other, they don't interfere with other microwave equipment, so nearby microwave links can use the same frequencies, called frequency reuse. Antennas must be highly directional (high gain); these antennas are installed in elevated locations such as large radio towers {{in order to be}} able to transmit across long distances. Typical types of antenna used in radio relay link installations are parabolic antennas, <b>dielectric</b> <b>lens,</b> and horn-reflector antennas, which have a diameter of up to 4 meters. Highly directive antennas permit an economical use of the available frequency spectrum, despite long transmission distances.|$|E
50|$|The {{wavelengths}} of SHF waves are small {{enough that they}} can be focused into narrow beams by high gain antennas from a half meter to five meters in diameter. Directive antennas at SHF frequencies are mostly aperture antennas, such as parabolic antennas (the most common type), <b>dielectric</b> <b>lens,</b> slot and horn antennas. Large parabolic antennas can produce very narrow beams of a few degrees or less, and often must be aimed {{with the aid of a}} boresight. For omnidirectional applications like wireless devices and cellphones, small dipoles or monopoles are used. The patch antenna is another type, often integrated into the skin of aircraft. Another type of antenna practical at microwave frequencies is the phased array, consisting of many dipoles or patch antennas on a flat surface, each fed through a phase shifter, which allows the array's beam to be steered electronically. The short wavelength requires great mechanical rigidity in large antennas, to ensure that the radio waves arrive at the feed point in phase.|$|E
50|$|Their short {{wavelength}} allows narrow {{beams of}} microwaves {{to be produced}} by conveniently small high gain antennas from a half meter to 5 meters in diameter. Therefore, beams of microwaves are used for point-to-point communication links, and for radar. An advantage of narrow beams is that they don't interfere with nearby equipment using the same frequency, allowing frequency reuse by nearby transmitters. Parabolic ("dish") antennas are {{the most widely used}} directive antennas at microwave frequencies, but horn antennas, slot antennas and <b>dielectric</b> <b>lens</b> antennas are also used. Flat microstrip antennas are being increasingly used in consumer devices. Another directive antenna practical at microwave frequencies is the phased array, a computer-controlled array of antennas which produces a beam which can be electronically steered in different directions. Where omnidirectional antennas are required, for example in wireless devices and Wifi routers for wireless LANs, small monopoles, such as the inverted F antenna (PIFA) in cell phones, dipole, or patch antennas are used.|$|E

40|$|This article {{illustrates}} a microwave <b>dielectric</b> <b>lens</b> design using genetic programming (GP), which, {{to the best}} knowledge of the authors, {{is the first time}} GP has been applied to design a microwave <b>dielectric</b> <b>lens.</b> A phase-compensating single layer lens and a quarter-wave phase-compensating multilayer <b>dielectric</b> <b>lens,</b> which uses four types of materials and a zoned structure, was designed using GP. The <b>dielectric</b> <b>lens</b> shape was designed using GP strategy, with a random initial shape, to compensate for the phase error of the multilayer <b>dielectric</b> <b>lens</b> and to achieve the required performance. Standard GP (SGP) and hierarchical fair competition genetic programming (HFC-GP) was applied to obtain the solution. The results show that this novel method of microwave lens shape design using GP is both accurate and stable. In addition, the simulation results of using high frequency simulation software (HFSS) are illustrated and compared. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. ...|$|E

40|$|We have designed, fabricated, and {{experimentally}} characterized a lens for the THz regime {{based on}} artificial dielectrics. These are man-made media that mimic properties of naturally occurring dielectric media, or even manifest properties that cannot generally occur in nature. For example, the well-known dielectric property, the refractive index, which usually has a value greater than unity, {{can have a}} value less than unity in an artificial <b>dielectric.</b> For our <b>lens,</b> the artificial-dielectric medium {{is made up of}} a parallel stack of 100 [*]μm thick metal plates that form an array of parallel-plate waveguides. The convergent lens has a plano-concave geometry, in contrast to conventional <b>dielectric</b> <b>lenses.</b> Our results demonstrate that this lens is capable of focusing a 2 [*]cm diameter beam to a spot size of 4 [*]mm, at the design frequency of 0. 17 [*]THz. The results further demonstrate that the overall power transmission of the lens can be better than certain conventional <b>dielectric</b> <b>lenses</b> commonly used in the THz regime. Intriguingly, we also observe that under certain conditions, the lens boundary demarcated by the discontinuous plate edges actually resembles a smooth continuous surface.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present {{the design of}} a <b>dielectric</b> flat <b>lens</b> antenna to operate in the 60 GHz band for WPAN applications. In order to {{overcome}} the specific atmospheric attenuation, which characterizes the propagation in the 60 GHz band, high directive antennas are required. Moreover, due to high user random mobility in indoor environments, beam-steerable antennas are also needed. For these reasons, we propose a design based on a <b>dielectric</b> flat <b>lens</b> antenna with scanning capabilities from - 30 ° to + 30 ° with around 20 dB of gain in the whole entire band of interest (57 to 66 GHz), and up to ± 60 ° of beam-steering capabilities with around 15 dB of gain.

One technique is to use large metal surfaces such as parabolic reflectors, horns or <b>dielectric</b> <b>lenses</b> which change {{the direction of the}} radio waves by reflection or refraction, to focus the radio waves from a single low gain antenna into a beam.
