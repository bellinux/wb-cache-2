40|$|Infants who {{present with}} {{multiple}} unexplained fractures {{in which there}} is no prior trauma, no radiographic evidence of metabolic bone disease, and no biochemical evidence of metabolic bone disease are almost always diagnosed as victims of child abuse, even though parents and caregivers deny wrongdoing. Such a diagnosis has far reaching implications for the infant and family. This article describes the clinical features of 65 such infants with multiple unexplained fractures in which the parents and caregivers deny wrongdoing and in which child abuse was diagnosed. These infants have the phenotype of temporary brittle bone disease that was described by Paterson. A striking observation in these young infants is the pregnancy history of decreased fetal movement. A hypothesis is suggested as an alternative explanation for the mechanism of these fractures in these infants – namely temporary brittle bone disease from fetal immobilization. This hypothesis states that fetal bone loading through fetal movement is essential for the formation of bones of normal strength. This hypothesis is an application of Frost’s mechanostat/bone-loading model of bone physiology to the prenatal period of bone formation. This hypothesis explains many of the other observations about temporary brittle bone disease including the early onset of the fractures in the first several months of life, the lack of bruising, the lack of other <b>internal</b> <b>organ</b> <b>injury,</b> and the low risk profile of many of the parents for committing child abuse...|$|E
40|$|Background: In recent years, laparoscopic sleeve {{gastrectomy}} (LSG) {{has become}} more acceptable for obese patients. Single-port sleeve gastrectomy (SPSG) is more popular since each abdominal incision carries the risk of bleeding, hernia, and <b>internal</b> <b>organ</b> <b>injury</b> as well as exponentially affecting cosmesis. This cross-sectional study aimed at comparing multi-port sleeve gastrectomy (MPSG) and SPSG {{in terms of their}} early results and complications. Methods: Out of 129 obese patients candidated for LSG, 102 patients were assigned to 2 groups of SPSG and MPSG. Complications and demographic data such as body mass index (BMI), age, gender, operation time, and hospital stay were measured. All surgeries were carried out between 2013 and 2015 in Shiraz, Iran. Data analysis was performed using SPSS, version 16 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). The continuous and categorical variables were compared using the Student t-test and the Chi-square test or the Fisher exact test, respectively. Results: The patients’ data from both groups were similar in terms of age, intraoperative and postoperative bleeding volume, and length of hospital stay. Mean BMI was 42. 8 ± 0. 7 in the SPSG group and 45. 3 ± 1. 2 in the MPSG group. Duration of surgery was significantly lower in the SPSG group (P< 0. 001). Only 1 patient from the SPSG group and 5 patients from the MPSG group had bleeding as an early complication. Conclusion: The differences in each complication between the groups were not statistically significant. SPSG seems to be safe and is the same as MPSG in terms of major postoperative complications.

40|$|Temporary {{brittle bone disease}} (TBBD) is a {{recently}} described phenotype of multiple, unexplained fractures {{in the first year}} of life and predominantly in the first 6 months of life. There is usually no other injury such as bruising, subdural hematomas, retinal hemorrhages, or other <b>internal</b> <b>organ</b> <b>injury.</b> The susceptibility to fracture is transient, and there are no other radiographic or biochemical abnormalities noted in the standard evaluation that might suggest an underlying cause. The child abuse and pediatric radiology communities have, for the most part, been unwilling to accept this as a real condition, for they believe it is a ruse for child abuse. This review describes the experience of the author in evaluating infants with multiple unexplained fractures and the hypothesis that has emerged for explaining TBBD. The hypothesis is a prenatal application of the mechanostat/bone loading theory of bone formation and states that TBBD is caused by fetal immobilization which leads to fetal bone unloading and transient, relative osteopenia. Such susceptible infants can fracture with routine handling and present with a pattern of fractures that is similar to that which has been thought to be highly specific for child abuse. The review presents: (a) the evidence that indicates that normal fetal movement is important for normal fetal bone strength, (b) a critique of the radiologic approach in the diagnosis of child abuse in infants with multiple unexplained fractures, (c) observations that would indicate that child abuse is unlikely in infants with TBBD, and (d) new approaches to the infant with multiple unexplained fractures that would assist in accurate diagnosis...|$|E

40|$|Greater {{fragility}} {{has been}} shown to contribute to high fatality rates among older road users. This research uses linked crash and hospital data to examine charges, length of stay, injury body region, and nature of injury for two categories of older vehicle occupants (65 - 84 and 85 +) with adults (25 - 64) as comparison. Older and much older occupants have lower inpatient charges but have significantly higher emergency department charges than adults. There are no notable differences in charges for emergency department or inpatient charges between drivers and passengers; there is also no difference in inpatient length of stay across ages. Median charges by number of vehicles in crash reflected median charges in general; inpatient charges were higher for adults in both single- and multi-vehicle crashes while emergency department charges were higher for older and much older occupants in both single- and multi-vehicle crashes. There were no notable differences when examining median charges by manner of collision. Older and much older vehicle occupants have greater likelihood of suffering injuries to all body regions than adults, except for spine and back. TBI type 1 injuries were two times more likely in older and four times more likely in much older occupants than adults.

40|$|OBJECTIVES:: Missed injury diagnoses {{may cause}} {{potentially}} preventable deaths. To estimate {{the effect of}} clinically undiagnosed injuries on injury-specific survival estimates and the accuracy of an injury severity score. To also estimate the potentially preventable mortality attributable to these injuries. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS:: In a nation-wide, population-based study, {{data were collected from}} all hospital admissions for injuries in Sweden between 1998 and 2004. We studied 8627 deaths in hospital among 598, 137 incident hospital admissions. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:: New specific-injury categories were added in 7. 4 % (95 % confidence interval [CI] 6. 8 - 8. 0) of all deaths with an autopsy rate of 24. 2 %. It was estimated that this proportion would have increased to 25. 1 % (95 % CI 23. 0 - 27. 2), if all deaths had been autopsied. The most pronounced effect of clinically undiagnosed injuries was found for <b>internal</b> <b>organ</b> <b>injury</b> in the abdomen or pelvis, where they reduced the estimated survival from 0. 83 to 0. 69 (95 % CI for the difference: 0. 09 - 0. 20). Autopsy diagnoses also revealed substantial bias of survival estimates for vascular injuries in the thorax and crush injuries to the head. The performance of the International Classification of Diseases Injury Severity Score improved when autopsy diagnoses were added to hospital discharge diagnoses. The maximum proportion of injury deaths attributable to missed injuries was estimated to be 6. 5 %. CONCLUSIONS:: Maintaining a high autopsy rate and merging accurate hospital discharge data and autopsy data are effective ways to improve the accuracy of survival estimates and mortality prediction models, and to estimate mortality attributable to diagnostic failures...|$|E
40|$|Objective Empirical {{head-to-head}} {{comparison of}} the health utility index (HUI) mark 2 and 3 and the EuroQol- 5 D (EQ- 5 D) in injury patients of all severity levels to obtain more insight into the strengths and limitations of the multi-attribute utility measures (MAUI) to estimate utility losses in injury populations. Design A self-assessment survey that included the EQ- 5 D, HUI 2 and HUI 3 to measure generic health-related quality of life. Patients Injury patients in The Netherlands 2 years after they attended the emergency department. Main Outcome Measures Shannon's index and Shannon's evenness index {{were used to assess}} absolute and relative informativity, both for the summary scores and by dimension. The study also analysed convergent and construct validity of the MAUI. Results Mean summary scores significantly differed between the instruments, with highest summary scores for HUI 2 (0. 88), followed by HUI 3 (0. 80) and EQ- 5 D (0. 78). Absolute and relative informativity by dimension was highest for the HUI 3 descriptive system. The HUI 3 was most sensitive for ageing and comorbidity. The largest differences between the MAUI were found for pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression/emotion. The largest differences in discriminative power between EQ- 5 D and HUI (mark 2 and 3) were seen for skull-brain injury, <b>internal</b> <b>organ</b> <b>injury</b> and upper extremity fractures. Conclusions Different MAUI resulted in significantly different summary scores. The instruments and their dimensions performed differently for injury severity levels, ageing, comorbidity and injury groups. A combination of the HUI and EQ- 5 D should be used in studies on injury-related disability, because the combination covers all relevant health dimensions, is applicable in all kinds of injury populations and in widely different age range...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: We {{presented}} {{our initial}} clinical experiences with transumbilical laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) ureterolithotomy for large, impacted ureteral stones. Materials and Methods: Between March 2009 and November 2009, seven LESS ureterolithotomies were performed at our institute. During the operation, {{we made a}} single 2 cm incision at the umbilicus and a homemade port by using a small wound retractor (Alexis Ⓡ, Applied Medical, Rancho Santa Margarita, USA), a surgical glove, and conventional trocars. The operation was performed {{in the same manner}} as conventional laparoscopic surgery. The mean maximal stone diameter was 21. 9 mm (range, 16. 0 - 27. 0 mm). There were six cases of upper ureteral stones and one case of a mid-ureteral stone. Perioperative and postoperative parameters were evaluated. Results: The mean operative time was 197. 1 min (range, 150 - 270 min). No transfusions were required. The mean postoperative hospital stay was 3. 3 days (range, 2 - 6 days). The mean pain intensity on a visual analogue scale (VAS) on postoperative day 2 was 26 mm (range, 0 - 80 mm), and the mean cosmetic VAS at 6 weeks after the operation was 0 mm. The mean time for patients to return to their baseline activities was 4. 0 days (range, 3 - 7 days). In six cases, all stones were completely removed on the basis of postoperative radiologic evaluation. There were no cases of major complications, including <b>internal</b> <b>organ</b> <b>injury,</b> urinary leakage, or urinary tract infection. Conclusions: Transumbilical LESS ureterolithotomy can be considered as an alternative treatment option with minimal invasiveness and good effectiveness for large, impacted ureteral stones.

40|$|This {{research}} investigated viscous injury from vertical {{impact loading}} {{to determine if}} {{it is critical to}} survivability of aircraft accidents. A unique database was built from autopsy reports and accident investigations combining injury data with the vehicle impact data. Computer models were created and used to assess injury potential. Common design limits and actual crash data from full scale research experiments were used as inputs. The results were analyzed according to published injury thresholds and compared with real accident autopsies to determine the validity of the hypothesis. Heart and Aortic Injury (HAI) has been considered a critical survivability factor through out the history of mechanized transportation. The mechanisms of HAI in the aircraft environment were never well characterized. Automotive research identified important HAI injury mechanisms related to the forward and lateral impact vectors. This research investigated the vertical impact vector. A model was developed to evaluate the biomechanical response of a simplified visco-elastic system, and incorporated into a system model which included the occupant and aircraft seat. This approach was similar to the development of spine injury criteria and provided the advantage of a macro level evaluation of the injury thresholds and assessment of the criticality in survivable accidents. Evaluations of real accidents sustaining HAI characterized a range of impact severity and approximate boundaries for survivability with HAI and <b>internal</b> <b>organ</b> <b>injury.</b> Viscous injury potential from vertical impact was found to be less critical than potential spine injury. Detailed analysis of HAI documented in autopsy reports and the corresponding accident investigations found that HAI was associated with cockpit environmental factors rather than inertial displacement mechanisms. Vertical displacement of the heart due to inertial loads is not a critical factor in survivable accidents given current aircraft technology. Inertial loading to the heart and aorta is a contributory factor for viscous injuries in aircraft accidents. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
30|$|OHCA {{remains a}} {{leading cause of}} death and {{permanent}} disability worldwide. Although patients are successfully resuscitated, they often suffer from <b>internal</b> <b>organ</b> <b>injury,</b> including hypoxic brain damage. Cardiac arrest initiates a complex cellular injury cascade, which compromises autoregulation and function of internal organs with a destructive systemic inflammatory response. The complexity of this cascade challenges the development of experimental models and effective treatment for cardiac arrest. Many experimental animal preparations have been developed to explore mechanisms of damage to vital internal organs after resuscitation from cardiac arrest and to develop targeted treatments. Porcine models of cardiac arrest and resuscitation offer several important advantages over other species, and outcomes in this large animal are readily translatable to the clinical setting [14]. We used a percutaneous intravascular measurement technique already available in clinical practice to accurately measure absolute flow and microvascular resistances in cerebral and coronary arteries based on thermodilution technique [9, 13]. Our study showed that 30  min after cardiac arrest and resuscitation, mean cerebral flow significantly decreased by 35 %, and mean microvascular cerebral resistances significantly increased by 37 % compared to baseline, while coronary flow and resistances remained stable, as did haemodynamic parameters (mean aortic blood pressure, heart rate and temperature). In agreement with literature data, we observed a hyperaemic phase just after resuscitation, with a significant increase in aortic blood pressure, heart rate and cerebral flow [8]. Our measurements add microvascular resistance evaluation, which is constant during this phase. It has been described that the absolute coronary flow technique induces maximal hyperaemia as compared with hyperaemia under adenosine in the coronary circulation [10]. Mechanism of brain injury induced by cardiac arrest remains unclear. According to our results, the hyperaemic phase just after resuscitation is probably due to haemodynamic modifications with constantly adaptive resistances, which means full cerebral circulation vasodilation from baseline to T 15 and an increase in blood pressure and heart rate that increases cerebral flow. At a later phase (T 30), we observed a significant increase in cerebral microvascular resistances with a decrease in cerebral flow. We were not able to show {{a significant difference between the}} two groups according to no flow duration (Additional files  1 and 2 : Figures S 1 and S 2), probably due to the small sample size in each group and the considerable resuscitation failure in the 5 -min group. Overall, our study showed that it is feasible to study cerebral flow and to assess microvascular resistances after cardiac arrest resuscitation in an animal setting to better understand complex haemodynamic modifications. This could allow to better explore therapies aiming to reduce cerebral microvascular resistances and to increase CBF in order to improve neurological outcome in OHCA patients.|$|E

40|$|The {{carotenoids}} in mysis and the <b>internal</b> <b>organs</b> of squid were extracted, purified on the columns, {{characterized by}} absorption spectra, the {{behavior on the}} columns, absorption maxima of the reduction and co-chromatography with authentic samples. In the mysis, the existence of β-carotene, echinenone, isocryptoxanthin, lutein, zeaxanthin, canthaxanthin, astaxanthin, and crustaxanthin was confirmed. In the <b>internal</b> <b>organs</b> of squid, astaxanthin was found. The content of astaxanthin was most abundant amoung each pigment in mysis and the <b>internal</b> <b>organs</b> of squid. It was clarified that mysis and <b>internal</b> <b>organs</b> of squid were good additives to the food for sea bream {{in order to improve}} their reddish brightness. It was assumed that in mysis β-carotene would be converted to astaxanthin through the steps of isocryptoxanthin, echinenone, and canthaxanthin. ...|$|R
