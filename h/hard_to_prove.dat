The Gambinos, rather than being charged with extortion – which was <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> – were charged with antitrust violations.

25|$|Israel's {{land policy}} was adapted {{to a large}} extent from the Ottoman land {{regulations}} of 1858. According to the 1858 Ottoman Land Law, lands that were not registered as of private ownership, were considered state lands. But Bedouins were not motivated to register lands they lived on, because land ownership meant additional responsibilities for them, including taxation and military duty, and it created a new problem since they found it <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> their ownership rights. Israel relied mainly on Tabu recordings. Most of the Bedouin land fell under the Ottoman class of 'non-workable' (mawat) land and thus belonged to the state under Ottoman law. Israel nationalized most of the Negev lands, using The Land Rights Settlement Ordinance from 1969.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{discovery}} of Tutankhamun's mummy, {{there has been a}} lot of speculation and theories on the exact cause of death, which until recent studies had been <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> with the evidence and data available. While it was a widely debated topic for many Egyptologists, it had also spread to the general public as popular culture has come up with many conspiracy theories that played out in movies, TV shows, and fictional books. Author James Patterson has even recently written his own take in his book, The Murder of King Tut. There are many educated and respected Egyptologists as well as trained professionals in other fields who have devoted a lot of time researching Tutankhamun and who have varying beliefs to his cause of death. Some have stood by their theories even in light of new evidence. Some of the theories are better known and supported than others.|$|E

In 1993, I learned that Željko Ražnatović, Arkan, had in Belgrade kidnapped and taken to Erdut and there killed Isa Lero... also a man from the criminal underground who had come into conflict with Arkan. I even found a witness to the murder. I publicly accused Arkan. I submitted a report to the police. The police inspectors came to see me. We talked about it. I gave them all the information I had, but then the police inspector told me that they were aware of it but that they were unable to prove it because of the fear among the potential witnesses. So the police were quite well-informed about his criminal activities, but it was very <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> anything or to bring charges because his support network was so widespread, and this can be shown through various newspaper articles and so on. In one television statement, I told him when we were debating on TV, that he had pulled a sock over his head more often than I had pulled one on my feet.|$|E

He does not think of the consequences, such as imprisonment. Norwood revealed that Fatboy has known Mercy since they were nine years old and he had feelings for her when EastEnders: E20 started, as he was upset when she got pregnant by someone else. He said that Fatboy would be heartbroken when Mercy leaves. Norwood told Inside Soap that the wedding creates more problems for the characters, rather than solving all their problems. The fact that they try so <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> they are genuine makes it [...] "very hard for them to be friends." [...] The wedding episode sees Fatboy have a dream come true, {{but at the same time}} it is a nightmare for him. Knowing the wedding is a sham he is [...] "waiting for that monster to appear". Ashley turns up and is annoyed that Fatboy has kept the wedding a secret, and of this, Norwood stated: [...] "When [...] finds out what has happened he is pretty shocked. He tries to make Fatboy see the consequences of his actions, but Fatboy doesn't want to hear it—his dad has already betrayed him when it comes to Mercy." [...] Mercy is shocked to learn that Fatboy did not tell her that Ashley reported her. Although Norwood concluded that Fatboy [...] "will go to the ends of the earth to make this marriage work".|$|E
