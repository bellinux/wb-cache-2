[...] "I count Rochefoucauld's Maxims," [...] says one critic, [...] "a bad book. As I am reading it, I feel discomfort; I have a sense of suffering which I cannot define. Such thoughts tarnish the brightness of the soul; they degrade the heart." [...] Yet as a faithful presentation of human selfishness, and of you and me in so far as we happen to be mainly selfish, the odious mirror has its uses by showing us what manner of man we are or may become. Let us not forget either that not quite all is selfishness in La Rochefoucauld. Everybody knows his saying that hypocrisy is the homage that vice pays to virtue. There is a subtle truth in this, too,--that to be in too great a hurry to <b>discharge</b> <b>an</b> <b>obligation</b> is itself a kind of ingratitude. Nor is there any harm in the reflection that no fool is so troublesome as the clever fool; nor in this, that only great men have any business with great defects; nor, finally, in the consolatory saying, that we are never either so happy or so unhappy as we imagine.|$|E
6000|$|The Annexation was as well {{received}} in England {{as it was}} in the Transvaal. Lord Carnarvon wrote to Sir T. Shepstone to convey [...] "the Queen's entire approval of your conduct since you received Her Majesty's commission, with a renewal of my own thanks on behalf of the Government for the admirable prudence and discretion with which you have discharged a great and unwonted responsibility." [...] It was also accepted by Parliament with very few dissentient voices, since it was not till afterwards, when the subject became useful as an electioneering howl, that the Liberal party, headed by our [...] "powerful popular minister," [...] discovered the deep iniquity that had been perpetrated in South Africa. So satisfied were the Transvaal Boers with the change that Messrs. Kruger, Jorissen, and Bok, who formed the deputation to proceed to England and present President Burgers' formal protest against the Annexation, found great difficulty in raising one-half of the necessary expenses--something under one thousand pounds--towards the cost of the undertaking. The thirst for independence cannot have been very great when all the wealthy burghers in the Transvaal put together would not subscribe a thousand pounds towards retaining it. Indeed, at this time the members of the deputation themselves seem to have looked upon their undertaking as being both doubtful and undesirable, since they informed Sir T. Shepstone that they were going to Europe to <b>discharge</b> <b>an</b> <b>obligation</b> which had been imposed upon them, and if the mission failed, they would have done their duty. Mr. Kruger said that if they did fail, he would be found to be as faithful a subject under the new form of government as he had been under the old; and Dr. Jorissen admitted with equal frankness that [...] "the change was inevitable, and expressed his belief that the cancellation of it would be calamitous." ...|$|E
6000|$|Dr. Cumming’s theory, {{as we have}} seen, is that {{actions are}} good or evil {{according}} as they are prompted or not prompted by an exclusive reference to the “glory of God.” God, then, in Dr. Cumming’s conception, is a being who has no pleasure {{in the exercise of}} love and truthfulness and justice, considered as affecting the well-being of his creatures; He has satisfaction in us only in so far as we exhaust our motives and dispositions of all relation to our fellow-beings, and replace sympathy with men by anxiety for the “glory of God.” The deed of Grace Darling, when she took a boat in the storm to rescue drowning men and women, was not good if it was only compassion that nerved her arm and impelled her to brave death for the chance of saving others; it was only good if she asked herself—Will this redound to the glory of God? The man who endures tortures rather than betray a trust, the man who spends years in toil in order to <b>discharge</b> <b>an</b> <b>obligation</b> from which the law declares him free, must be animated not by the spirit of fidelity to his fellow-man, but by a desire to make “the name of God more known.” The sweet charities of domestic life—the ready hand and the soothing word in sickness, the forbearance toward frailties, the prompt helpfulness in all efforts and sympathy in all joys, are simply evil if they result from a “constitutional tendency,” or from dispositions disciplined by the experience of suffering and the perception of moral loveliness. A wife is not to devote herself to her husband out of love to him and a sense of the duties implied by a close relation—she is to be a faithful wife for the glory of God; if she feels her natural affections welling up too strongly, she is to repress them; it will not do to act from natural affection—she must think of the glory of God. A man is to guide his affairs with energy and discretion, not from an honest desire to fulfil his responsibilities as a member of society and a father, but—that “God’s praise may be sung.” Dr. Cumming’s Christian pays his debts for the glory of God; {{were it not for the}} coercion of that supreme motive, it would be evil to pay them. A man is not to be just from a feeling of justice; he is not to help his fellow-men out of good-will to his fellow-men; he is not to be a tender husband and father out of affection: all these natural muscles and fibres are to be torn away and replaced by a patent steel-spring—anxiety for the “glory of God.” ...|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{standard}} setters, regulators and professional bodies worldwide have shown an {{increased interest in}} risk reporting. This has reflected the fallacy of the financial reporting model to communicate a company’s risk profile, the recent scandals and the financial crisis. In the EU, the Accounting Modernization Directive (AMD, 2003) requires companies to highlight the principal risks and uncertainties that they face, whereas the international accounting standards (IFRS 7 – Financial Instruments: Disclosure) requires companies to disclose their exposures, objectives and policies {{for each type of}} risk arising from financial instruments. Recently, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) has also developed new guidelines to improve risk reporting. High quality risk disclosures help investors and other market participants by providing {{a better understanding of the}} risk exposures and risk management practices of companies. In the literature, the four main areas of investigation of risk disclosure are: i) risk reporting practices and the level of risk disclosure; ii) the relationship between voluntary and mandatory risk disclosure; iii) the determinants of voluntary risk disclosure; iv) the economic consequences of risk disclosure, in terms of the impact on the cost of capital (cost of equity and cost of debt). However, these have focused mainly on corporate disclosure or risk disclosure rather than on financial risk disclosure. The aim of this research project is twofold. Firstly, we examine the level of compliance with IFRS 7 disclosure requirements on financial risks in order to understand how Albanian and Italian listed companies have implemented the risk reporting introduced by the IASB. IFRS 7 requires companies to disclose qualitative and quantitative information on their exposure to risks arising from financial instruments, including disclosures about credit risk (the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the other party by failing to <b>discharge</b> <b>an</b> <b>obligation),</b> liquidity risk (the risk that an entity will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset) and market risk (this risk includes currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risks). To verify the degree of compliance with regulation we use content analysis. Secondly, we investigate the determinants of financial risk disclosure in order to test whether size, leverage, industry and ownership affect the level of financial risk disclosure. To this end, we use a regression model...|$|E

The introduction of a plan for dealing with the land was not very popular even among ministers, but it was pressed by Lord Spencer and the Irish secretary, on the double ground that the land was too burning a question to be left where it then stood, and next that it was unfair to a new and untried legislature in Ireland to find itself confronted by such a question on the very threshold.|$|R

40|$|This thesis investigates {{what the}} correct {{justification}} in principle {{for the good}} consideration rule is. It concludes {{that the answer to}} that enquiry lies within the elements that complete a cause of action in unjust enrichment. On the best interpretation, the good consideration rule is an enrichment qualification. The defendant’s prima facie enrichment through the receipt of a benefit is balanced off by the <b>discharge</b> of <b>an</b> <b>obligation</b> owed to the defendant. In net terms therefore, the defendant is not enriched. However, this reasoning is conditional on the acceptance of two prior premises. First, the good consideration rule and the legal obligation qualification are distinct restrictions on claims in unjust enrichment. Two features in particular distinguish them: (a) the operation of <b>a</b> legal <b>obligation</b> between the claimant and the defendant; (b) the fact that the payment was intended to <b>discharge</b> <b>a</b> debt owed to the defendant. This thesis concerns the good consideration rule alone. Secondly, in evaluating the defendant’s enrichment, conditionally related disenrichments must be accounted for (the ‘net benefit approach’). Thus, when the defendant receives a benefit on the condition shared between the parties that the defendant will in turn suffer a disenrichment, the defendant’s true enrichment is the difference between those values. At first blush, {{there are at least three}} major objections to the enrichment thesis — the decision of the High Court of Australia in Roxborough, the House of Lords’ decision in Deutsche Morgan and the law on restitution of mistaken payments made to discharge unenforceable debts. On closer examination however, all three can be overcome. Finally, the enrichment thesis fares better than its rival explanations in accounting for the features of the good consideration rule. The ensuing doctrinal consequences are also largely in line with the prevalent judicial and academic thinking on the good consideration rule. This thesis is not currently available on ORA...|$|R

40|$|In Canada, {{appointed}} actuaries {{are required}} to opine on {{the adequacy of the}} policy liabilities for property-casualty insurers. Policy liabilities include both claims and premium liabilities. Several papers have been written and actuarial techniques have been developed to estimate claims liabilities. Premium liabilities, however, have received little, virtually no attention in the actuarial literature. To date, we believe that only Canadian actuaries have been evaluating these liabilities. However, other countries are following that lead. We understand that in some states, regulators will soon require actuarial opinions on the adequacy of unearned premiums for policies with terms exceeding twelve months. The evaluation of premium liabilities consists of examining all related assets and liabilities to ensure that the anticipated net costs to <b>discharge</b> <b>an</b> insurer's <b>obligations</b> with respect to its insurance and reinsurance contracts, except its claim liabilities, are provided for. This paper intends to provide the practicing actuary with some guidelines on the evaluation of the premium liabilities. We will review the individual components of the premium liabilities and the related regulatory requirements and CIA recommendations. Finally, we will present an actuarial approach to evaluate the equity in the unearned premium, the unearned premium deficiency and the deferred policy acquisition expenses.

40|$|This {{conceptual}} paper {{draws attention}} to the role of da’wah within management and commerce; and secondly, methods by which it can be evaluated within current practices. In its general sense, da’wah is an Arabic word which when translated denotes the issuing of an invitation. Within the construct of Islam, an additional inference is attached, whether implicit or explicit, which suggests that invitations are taken to be linked towards encouraging recipients to engage in Islamic practices. This is especially observed when participants choose to preserve the usage of the Arabic term within other non-Arabic languages. Drawing from this contextual backdrop within the field of business, Muslim managers attempt to <b>discharge</b> <b>a</b> religious <b>obligation,</b> whilst striving for commercial excellence. Whilst methods and approaches may change depending on the audiences’ faith, the same intention remains. Furthermore, {{it could be argued that}} Muslim managers’ desire for da’wah increases in aspiration - where there appears to be a lack of Islamic faith. Through using the SERVQUAL model and other communications based models, the paper underlines the challenges faced and offers suggestions as to how quality in service delivery, namely in da’wah, can be improved. The management implications are that da’wah should be considered as a key management component - which goes beyond the procedural and pastoral elements, usually associated with decision making functions. In addition, currently there is a paucity of business academic literature which synthesises Islamic concepts for a mainstream business audience...|$|R

On the strength of these, we propose a preliminary set of heuristics for the construction of a formal specification and show how these may be embedded in an enhanced strategy for specification work.
