The VAT to be presented has been deliberately selected owing to the ever-growing number of VAT scams within fraudulent tax “carousel” schemes; they involve multiple exports and imports of the same goods (in many cases exclusively based on fictitious invoices) through a diverse chain of supplies in a variety of EU countries.

An attempt to protect the integrity of the French Limousin Herd Book by opposing the entry of foreign purebreds that may have been subject to less stringent selection criteria is prohibited under EU legislation because it is considered to hinder <b>intra-Community</b> <b>trade.</b> Current EU legislation with its focus on free trade thus has the potential to result in the dilution of purebred breeds and loss of efficiency gains arising from crossbreeding.|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Like any tax, the VAT is {{vulnerable}} to evasion and fraud. But its credit and refund mechanism offers unique oppor-tunities for abuse, and this has recently become an urgent concern in the European Union (EU). This paper describes the main forms of noncompliance distinctive to a VAT, considers {{how they can be}} addressed, and assesses evidence on their extent in high–income countries. While the practical signifi cance of current diffi culties in the EU should not be overstated, administrative measures alone may prove insuffi cient to deal with them, and a fundamental redesign of the VAT treatment of <b>intra–community</b> <b>trade</b> may be required.

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the {{carousel}} of VAT fraud consisting in multiple undue VAT rebates for goods exported and re-exported between EU countries. This fraud has been developed {{as a form of}} border VAT adjustment since the abolition of the borders within the EU countries. The carousel is modelled as a Nash equilibrium chain-game beginning at the retail stage where fraudsters try to capture an unsatisfied demand for the traded goods by means of a reduction of its final price. This can occur because at the final stage the good can benefit from multiple subsidies deriving from undue VAT rebates and because {{of the power of the}} fraudster in affecting the prices of production factors. We explore the effects of the carousel fraud game on <b>intra-community</b> <b>trade</b> and analyse the implications for tax authorities...|$|R
40|$|The {{reaction}} in Britain to the European Union {{ban on the}} world-wide export of British beef has highlighted a lack of awareness {{of the role of}} European law in restricting trade on grounds of public health. This paper seeks to bring the legal arguments underlying such action to a wider public health audience by exploring the basis for such action in general and for the ban on British beef in particular. In European law, the obstruction of <b>intra-community</b> <b>trade</b> on grounds of public health is extremely limited although, in the case of British beef, there seems little doubt that it is lawful. In contrast, the stated basis for the ban to other countries is more questionable, although it may be acceptable to the European Court because of the objectives it seeks to achieve...|$|R
40|$|Considered {{from the}} {{perspective}} of Romania's accession to the European Union, we can say that starting with 1 January 2007, foreign trade transactions were delimited in relation to the customs borders in intra-Community transactions and international transactions. In this context, the way of conducting these operations is influenced by both the economic and financial features specific to both categories of transactions, that relate to the economic character of the activity, the diversity and specificity of the foreign trade activity, transport of goods, the complexity and regulation of intra-Community and international commercial transactions, and by the specific features of each category of transaction. Starting from the consideration that the economic and financial characteristics of foreign trade activity, specific to intra-Community commercial transactions, have a significant influence in the organization and management of accounting of the entities involved in such transactions, determining in a greater or lesser extent, the way of capitalization of the financial and accounting information in the processes of analysis, decision and control, in this paper we proposed to address the features of <b>intra-Community</b> <b>trade.</b> <b>intra-Community</b> commercial transactions, characteristics, customs barriers, Customs Union, value added tax...|$|R
