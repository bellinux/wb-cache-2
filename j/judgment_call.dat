5|$|Some {{relatively}} uncommon situations {{may also}} require a <b>judgment</b> <b>call</b> {{by the official}} scorer.|$|E
5|$|Most {{plays in}} the game are {{resolved}} {{in such a way}} that the scorer is not given more than one choice when recording the outcome of the play, but several types of plays are open to the interpretation of the official scorer. In any difficult <b>judgment</b> <b>call</b> where the official scorer is required to decide whether to credit a hit to the batter, the scorer is guided by rule 10.05. This rule directs the official scorer to give the benefit of the doubt to the hitter when the scorer believes that the decision to credit the batter with a hit is equally valid to an alternative scoring decision. In a similarly difficult <b>judgment</b> <b>call</b> where the official scorer believes that an earned run or an unearned run are equally valid scoring decisions, rule 10.16 directs the official scorer to give the benefit of the doubt to the pitcher.|$|E
5|$|Earned runs are runs {{that are}} {{directly}} attributable to a pitcher's efforts without a lapse by the defense. An unearned run does not adversely impact a pitcher's {{earned run average}} (ERA), and is only possible when an error (including catcher's interference) or a passed ball occurs earlier in the inning. Unearned runs are primarily discussed in rule 10.16 and often require a <b>judgment</b> <b>call</b> by the official scorer.|$|E

5|$|Henry Chadwick is {{generally}} {{credited with the}} invention of scorekeeping in baseball. Chadwick was also {{the inventor of the}} modern box score and the writer of the first rule book for the game of baseball. Since baseball statistics were initially a subject of interest to sportswriters, the role of the official scorer in Major League Baseball (MLB) {{in the early days of}} the sport was performed by newspaper writers. A <b>judgment</b> <b>call</b> that is required by the official scorer does not alter the outcome of a game, but these judgments impact the statistical records of the game. As the subjective scoring decisions which are used to calculate baseball statistics began to be used to determine the relative value of baseball players, MLB began to require approval from the league before a writer-scorer could be assigned to produce the scoring report for a game. By the 1970s, writers who were willing to score games for MLB were required to have attended 100 or more games per year in the prior three years and to be chosen by the local chapter chairman of the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA). Qualified candidates for scoring were submitted to the leagues for approval.|$|E
25|$|Leach did {{not think}} that the crimes {{surrounding}} the failure of the Whitewater-tied S should have been considered in an impeachment framework. Like many in Congress, he was surprised that the Justice Department chose to refer certain sex-related charges to Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, and even more so when Starr chose subsequently to refer certain of them to the Congress. But in what he described as a close <b>judgment</b> <b>call,</b> Leach voted for the article of impeachment that related to felonious lying under oath.|$|E
500|$|The {{most common}} <b>judgment</b> <b>call</b> {{involving}} an error {{occurs when the}} defense fails {{to put out a}} batter-runner who puts the ball in play. If the out is not recorded and the official scorer believes that an [...] "ordinary effort" [...] by the defense would have resulted in an out, the defense is charged with an error, and the batter is not credited with a hit. Other common situations requiring a <b>judgment</b> <b>call</b> include unintentionally dropped foul balls that allow the batter to continue his at-bat, and poor throws to the next base when a runner attempts to advance.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>judgment,</b> <b>called</b> [...] "landmark" [...] by BBC {{journalist}} Sanjoy Majumder, {{brought the}} case to an end. The case has the legacy of being [...] "one of the country's most controversial and high profile trials." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{player is}} the {{commander}} of either NATO or Soviet forces, commanding ships and aircraft, selecting from over 100 different weapon systems, and taking responsibility for <b>judgment</b> <b>calls.</b> The game mainly focuses on combat in the GIUK Gap.|$|R
5000|$|The Bill {{was limited}} until 1873 to {{equitable}} relief, including an injunction, an accounting or {{a type of}} declaratory <b>judgment</b> <b>called</b> a “decree.” It {{could not be used}} for monetary relief and in this respect was similar to a representative action.|$|R
500|$|Rule 10.01 {{states that}} the scorer is never allowed to make scorekeeping {{decisions}} that conflict with the official rules governing scorekeeping. The official scorer is permitted to view available replays and to solicit the opinions of others, but the official scorer is given the sole authority to make the judgment calls that are required in the score report. When a <b>judgment</b> <b>call</b> is made, the official scorer is obligated to immediately communicate that decision to the media in the press box and to the broadcasters, usually through a microphone. The official scorer has up to 24 hours to reconsider or reverse a <b>judgment</b> <b>call</b> that was made during the game. In rare circumstances, MLB's scoring committee may reverse a scoring decision that is [...] "clearly erroneous".|$|E
500|$|The {{decision}} to charge an error {{to the defense}} is the most well-known responsibility of the official scorer. Some situations automatically call for an error to be charged to the defense by rule, but most charged errors {{are the result of}} a play that requires a <b>judgment</b> <b>call.</b> Broadly speaking, an error is charged to the defense when an [...] "ordinary effort" [...] by the defense would have either recorded an out or prevented a runner from advancing, but the defense fails to do so. When an error is charged, the official scorer must charge the error to one of the fielders {{who were involved in the}} play. Errors are primarily discussed in rule 10.12.|$|E
500|$|The {{goal was}} not {{reviewed}} immediately, so {{officials did not}} notice Hull's foot in the crease until minutes later. [...] After video reviews showed Hull's position, the goal was still upheld, leaving the Sabres infuriated. Hašek commented, [...] "Maybe [...] was in the bathroom. Maybe he was sleeping. Maybe he doesn't know the rule." [...] The following season, NHL commissioner Gary Bettman announced that video replays {{would no longer be}} used to judge if players are in the crease or not, {{and that it would be}} a <b>judgment</b> <b>call</b> by the officiating crew. After the season ended, Hašek contemplated retirement because of a combination of injuries and a desire to become more involved in his family life. The announcement stunned many of his teammates, particularly Mike Peca and Jason Woolley.|$|E

5000|$|A line referee’s {{decision}} is final in all <b>judgment</b> <b>calls</b> {{on his own}} line; the umpire does not ordinarily overrule him. If a line referee's vision is blocked, the umpire may make the call if he can; otherwise a ‘let’ should be given ...|$|R
5000|$|There is no [...] "bright line test" [...] to {{determine}} whether one work supersedes the purpose of another; like the determination of fair use generally, it involves significant <b>judgment</b> <b>calls.</b> However, there is substantial precedent that clarifies the nature of transformation in law.|$|R
500|$|The South Korean team {{immediately}} {{protested the}} decision of the chief official of the race, but their protests were denied by the International Skating Union (ISU). The Korean team then appealed to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). [...] The IOC refused to see the case, stating, [...] "This is a matter for the ISU to decide on. At this time, the IOC has received no proposal and taken no action". [...] The CAS sided with the officials of the race as [...] "there is no provision in the short-track rule book for overturning a <b>judgment</b> <b>call</b> by the referee" [...] after the Korean team asked to have a video replay be used {{to determine whether or not}} there was a rule violation.|$|E
2500|$|An en dash can be {{retained}} to avoid ambiguity, but whether any ambiguity is plausible is a <b>judgment</b> <b>call.</b> AMA style retains the en dashes {{in the following}} examples, but {{one could argue that}} some perverseness may be needed to construe the hyphens-only alternative as ambiguous: ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the waning}} {{seconds of the}} first period, Dave Christian fired a slap shot on Tretiak from [...] away. The Soviet goalie saved the shot but misplayed the rebound, which bounced out some [...] in front of him. Mark Johnson sliced between the two defenders, found the loose puck, and fired it past a diving Tretiak to tie the score with one second left in the period. This would be an {{important}} <b>judgment</b> <b>call</b> by the officials, as an official announcement confirming the goal did not come until many Soviet players were ...|$|E
50|$|Rule 9.02 of the Official Baseball Rules {{states that}} {{objections}} to <b>judgment</b> <b>calls</b> on the field, including balls and strikes, {{shall not be}} tolerated, and that any manager, coach, or player who leaves his dugout or field position to contest a judgement call will first be warned, and then ejected.|$|R
5|$|In {{the game}} of baseball, the {{official}} scorer is a person appointed by the league to record the events on the field, and to send the official scoring record of the game back to the league offices. In addition to recording the events on the field such as the outcome of each plate appearance and the circumstances of any baserunner's advance around the bases, the official scorer is also charged with making <b>judgment</b> <b>calls</b> that do not affect the progress or outcome of the game. <b>Judgment</b> <b>calls</b> are primarily made about errors, unearned runs, fielder's choice, the value of hits in certain situations, and wild pitches, {{all of which are}} included in the record compiled. This record is used to compile statistics for each player and team. A box score is a summary of the official scorer's game record.|$|R
5000|$|Burke's first novel, <b>Judgment</b> <b>Calls,</b> is {{loosely based}} {{on the case of}} Keith Hunter Jesperson, a serial killer known as the [...] "Happy Face Killer" [...] for the smiley faces he drew on his many letters to the media. [...] Angel's Tip was {{loosely based on}} the murders of Imette St. Guillen and Jennifer Moore.|$|R
2500|$|Production on {{the album}} was difficult. A.C. Newman stated, [...] "I {{remember}} 'Letter From an Occupant' was a pretty belabored song. It ended up being almost minimal, but I remember there's so much shit we put on it. There's a psychedelic 12-string guitar solo, a backwards guitar, there's a kind of really cool synth that's in there but buried. At some point, you have to choose. That was the hardest part about mixing the thing: just making that <b>judgment</b> <b>call.</b> I only feel at peace with the record now because people seem to like it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The same {{statement}} from the Council vowed that proper review procedures would be followed {{in the future and}} endorsed a resolution published by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, which states that there is no credible scientific evidence supporting intelligent design. On September 18, the Discovery Institute issued a statement praising the publication of Meyer's paper in a peer-reviewed journal and chastising the National Center for Science Education for stating that the paper should not have been published. [...] The Biological Society of Washington's president, Roy McDiarmid called Sternberg's decision to publish Meyer's article [...] "a really bad <b>judgment</b> <b>call</b> on the editor's part" [...] and said it was doubtful whether the three scientists who peer reviewed the article and recommended it for publication were evolutionary biologists.|$|E
2500|$|In mid February 1966, Brian was in {{the studio}} with his session band taping the first takes of a new composition, [...] "Good Vibrations". On February 23, he gave Capitol a {{provisional}} track listing for the new LP, which included both [...] "Sloop John B" [...] and [...] "Good Vibrations". This contradicts the long-held misconception that [...] "Sloop John B" [...] was a forced inclusion as the hit single at Capitol's insistence: in late February, the song was weeks away from release. Brian worked through February and into March fine-tuning the backing tracks. To the group's surprise, he also dropped [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] from the running order, telling them that he wanted to spend more time on it. Al Jardine remembered: [...] "At the time, we all had assumed that 'Good Vibrations' {{was going to be on}} the album, but Brian decided to hold it out. It was a <b>judgment</b> <b>call</b> on his part; we felt otherwise but left the ultimate decision up to him." ...|$|E
50|$|In many {{situations}} fielder's choice requires the official scorer to make <b>judgment</b> <b>calls,</b> {{such as what}} {{the outcome of the}} play would have been had there been no runners on base after taking into account ordinary effort by the defensive team, as well as what effect any errors committed by the defensive team might have had on the play.|$|R
50|$|Henley {{anticipated}} that Hartmann's failures to perform his duties during the pre-trial period would be arguments the Defense {{would want to}} submit to the Convening Authority during the post-trial period. He stated a new Legal Advisor, one not associated with Hartmann's <b>judgment</b> <b>calls,</b> would have to advise the Convening Authority on how to address Hartmann's actions.|$|R
50|$|Children still {{attempt to}} {{maintain}} {{a certain amount of}} control over their parents' knowledge of their lives by monitoring how and when to disclose to them. Thus, they moderate their parents' potential reactions. Because of this, it is important for parents to be aware of how they react to their children's disclosures, for these reactions will be used as <b>judgment</b> <b>calls</b> for the children's' future sharing.|$|R

50|$|If {{we were to}} make a <b>judgment</b> <b>call</b> at {{that early}} time in {{development}} we could be condemning one technology to being put on the shelf and the other would be developed and put into operation. If we develop both technologies {{we would be able}} to make a <b>judgment</b> <b>call</b> on each by comparing the progress of each technology at a set time interval such as every three months. The decisions we make about investment in the next stage would be based on those results.|$|E
5000|$|Although the Millerites {{originally}} thought that 1844 represented {{the end of}} the world, those who later became Seventh-day Adventist reached the conclusion that 1844 marked the beginning of a divine pre-advent <b>judgment</b> <b>called</b> [...] "the cleansing of the sanctuary". It is intimately related to the history of the Seventh-day Adventist Church and was described by the churchs prophet and pioneer Ellen G. White as one of the pillars of Adventist belief.|$|R
5|$|Baseball writer-scorers usually {{worked at}} the games played at the home stadium of the team which they covered for their newspaper. The writer-scorers were tasked with making {{objective}} decisions that could impact the statistics of the team they were writing about. Because of this affiliation, the official scorer was often presumed by the baseball players and managers to favor the home team when making the required <b>judgment</b> <b>calls</b> {{during the course of}} a game.|$|R
50|$|Quite unusually among {{common law}} countries, section 43 of the Fijian Constitution {{requires}} that the Fiji Bill of Rights be interpreted in light of “public international law” {{and so it was}} necessary for Judge Winter to call on this body of international standards in deciding the case. The <b>judgment</b> <b>calls</b> very heavily on international standards {{and the way in which}} courts in other parts of the world have dealt with these issues.|$|R
