5000|$|A Motorola {{connector}} {{also known}} as a motorola antenna plug is a common coaxial cable RF connector used primarily in the automotive industry for connecting the coaxial feedline from the antenna to the radio receiver. It is also sometimes used for connecting scanner antennas to scanners. The male plug somewhat resembles an RCA connector in size and shape, but instead of being concentric to the pin, the sleeve is [...] "folded" [...] back over the coax. The pin is soldered to the center conductor of the coaxial cable coming from the antenna, and the <b>grounded</b> <b>side</b> forms a 1.5 inch (38 mm) long sleeve around the coax. The sleeve usually contains one or more longitudinal spring surfaces, which provide reliable electrical contact by wiping against the mating female socket.|$|E
50|$|There are two {{variants}} of wrapped {{optical fibre cable}} systems for installation on overhead electricity power lines: they differ {{in the nature of}} the host conductor. When the host conductor is a phase-wire, one of the conductors that carry the electric current in the electricity network, a phase-to-ground insulator is required at every location where the wrapped cable leaves the conductor. The phase-to-ground (PTG) insulator is a device that provides electrical isolation whilst allowing optical continuity. This means that the fibre optic cable and joint closures on the <b>grounded</b> <b>side</b> of the PTG can be accessed and worked on safely, even if the overhead line is energised to full system voltage. The simpler system is designed to be installed on the earth-wire (also known as ground-wire or shield wire) of the overhead line. Because earth-wires are not energised in service, this type of installation does not require a phase-to-ground insulator.|$|E

5000|$|Shunts {{are rated}} by maximum current and voltage drop at that current. For example, a 500 A, 75 mV shunt {{would have a}} {{resistance}} of 0.15 milliohms, a maximum allowable current of 500 amps and at that current the voltage drop would be 75 millivolts. By convention, most shunts are designed to drop 50 mV, 75 mV or 100 mV when operating at their full rated current and most ammeters consist of a shunt and a voltmeter with full-scale deflections of 50, 75, or 100 mV. All shunts have a derating factor for continuous use, 66% being the most common. Continuous use is a run time of 2+ minutes, {{at which point the}} derating factor must be applied. There are thermal limits where a shunt will no longer operate correctly. At 80 °C thermal drift begins to occur, at 120 °C thermal drift is a significant problem where error, depending on the design of the shunt, can be several percent and at 140 °C the manganin alloy becomes permanently damaged due to annealing resulting in the resistance value drifting up or down. [...] If the current being measured is also at a high voltage potential this voltage will be present in the connecting leads too and in the reading instrument itself. Sometimes, the shunt is inserted in the return leg (<b>grounded</b> <b>side)</b> to avoid this problem. Some alternatives to shunts can provide isolation from the high voltage by not directly connecting the meter to the high voltage circuit. Examples of devices that can provide this isolation are Hall effect current sensors and current transformers (see clamp meters). Current shunts are considered more accurate and cheaper than Hall effect devices. Common accuracy of such devices are ±0.1% & 0.25% and 0.5%.|$|E

40|$|Compared to the N-formyl {{gramicidin}} A (GA), the N-acetyl gramicidin A (NAG) channel has unchanged conductance in 1 M NH 4 + (gamma NN/gamma GG = 1, conductance ratio) but reduced conductance in 1 M K+ (gamma NN/gamma GG = 0. 6) methylammonium (gamma NN/gamma GG = 0. 3), and formamidinium (gamma NN/gamma GG = 0. 1) solutions. Except with formamidinium, "flicker blocks" {{are evident}} even at low cutoff frequencies. For all cations studied, channel lifetimes of N-acetyl homodimers (NN) are approximately 50 -fold shorter {{than those of}} the GA homodimer (GG). The novel properties of GA channels in formamidinium solution (supralinear current-voltage relations and dimer stabilization (Seoh and Busath, 1993)) also appear in NN channels. The average single channel lifetime in 1 M formamidinium solution at 100 mV is 6 - 7 -fold longer than in K+ and methylammonium solutions and, like in the GA channel, significantly decreases with increasing membrane potential. Experiments with mixtures of the two peptides, GA and NAG, showed three main conductance peaks. Oriented hybrids were formed utilizing the principle that monomers remain in one leaflet of the bilayer (O'Connell et al., 1990). With GA at the polarized side and NAG at the <b>grounded</b> <b>side,</b> at positive potentials (in which case hybrids were designated GN) and at negative potentials (in which case hybrids were designated NG), channels had the same conductances and channel properties at all potentials studied. Flicker blocks were not evident in the hybrid channels, which suggests that both N-acetyl methyl groups at the junction of the dimer are required to cause flickers. Channel lifetimes in hybrids are only approximately threefold shorter {{than those of the}} GG channels, and channel conductances {{are similar to those of}} GG rather than NN channels. We suggest that acetyl-acetyl crowding at the dimeric junction in NN channels cause dimer destabilization, flickers, and increased selectivity in N-acetyl gramicidin channels...|$|E

40|$|Theories of figure–ground {{perception}} entail inhibitory {{competition between}} either low-level units (edge or feature units) or high-level shape properties. Extant computational models instantiate the 1 st type of theory. The authors investigated a prediction of the 2 nd type of theory: that shape properties suggested on the <b>ground</b> <b>side</b> of an edge are suppressed {{when they lose}} the figure–ground competition. In Experiment 1, the authors present behavioral evidence of the predicted suppression: Object decisions were slower for line drawings that followed silhouettes suggesting portions of objects from the same rather than a different category on their <b>ground</b> <b>sides.</b> In Experiment 2, the authors reversed the silhouette’s figure–ground relationships and obtained speeding rather than slowing {{in the same category}} condition, thereby demonstrating that the Experiment 1 results reflect suppression of those shape properties that lose the figure–ground competition. These experi-ments provide the first clear empirical evidence that figure–ground perception entails inhibitory competition between high-level shape properties and demonstrate the need for amendments to existing computational models. Furthermore, these results suggest that figure–ground perception may itself be an instance of biased competition in shape perception...|$|R
