Ethologically, the human keeper of a cat may function as a sort of surrogate for the cat's mother, and adult housecats live their lives <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> extended kittenhood, a form of behavioral neoteny. The high-pitched sounds housecats make to solicit food may mimic the cries of a hungry human infant, making them particularly hard for humans to ignore.|$|E

25|$|Historians debate Catherine's {{technical}} status, some {{seeing her}} as a regent or as a usurper, tolerable only during the minority of her son, Grand Duke Paul.

25|$|The series raises, explores, {{and offers}} fresh {{insights}} about ethical and moral issues {{emerging from the}} paradoxical nature of a counterterrorism organization which resorts to terrorist methods to succeed in its own ostensibly altruistic goals, and the attendant dilemmas in which the generally unwilling operatives in such an organization find themselves.

25|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s, the American and British {{counterculture}} and hippie {{movement had}} moved rock towards psychedelia, heavy metal, progressive rock and other styles that incorporated socially and politically incisive lyrics. The 1968 German student movement, French protests and Italian student movement had created a class of young, intellectual continental listeners, while nuclear weapons, pollution, and war inspired protests and activism. Avant-garde music had taken a turn towards the electronic in the mid-1950s. The avant-garde minimalist music current emerged in the early 1960s with the works of Americans La Monte Young, Terry Riley and Steve Reich. They used drones and loops (often with synthesizers and tapes) <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> psychedelic and space-oriented music.|$|E
