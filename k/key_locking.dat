5000|$|Locking options: {{various types}} of <b>key</b> <b>locking</b> or padlocking {{facility}} are available now. <b>Key</b> <b>locking</b> options include flush locks, cam locks, or locks incorporated into a rotating handle; padlocking facilities may be a simple hasp and staple, or else a padlocking hole may {{be included in a}} handle, often called a latchlock. More modern designs include keyless operation, either by coin deposit (which {{may or may not be}} returned when use of the locker terminates), or by using electronic keypads to enter passwords for later reopening the locker. Some older lockers used a drop-latch which was incorporated into the door handle, and slid up and down and could be padlocked at the bottom in the [...] "down" [...] position, but these are less used now. Three-point locking is not possible with this type of latch, because it needs to be operated by means of a latch that rotates rather than slides up and down; so this drop-latch is probably a less secure locking option, which may be why it is little used nowadays. Prefect Combination locks are very popular in school lockers used in the UK due to their ease of use and the time and cost saved in the removal of locker keys.|$|E
50|$|Externally {{threaded}} inserts have threads on {{the outside}} and inside of the insert. The insert is threaded into a pre-tapped hole, or some inserts tap their own threads in a drilled or molded hole. It is then anchored by various means, such as a nylon locking element. Inserts that are anchored via Loctite are more commonly known by the trademarked name E-Z Lok. A thin walled solid bushing insert by the trademarked name TIME-SERT is locked in by rolling the bottom few internal thread into the base material with a special install driver which will permanently lock the insert in place. <b>Key</b> <b>locking</b> inserts, more commonly known by the trademarked name Keenserts, use keys that are hammered into grooves through the threads, permanently locking the insert. Inserts that are self-tapping and lock via friction are more commonly known by the trademarked names Tap-lok or Speedserts.|$|E

Eddie throws himself with all his might towards the girl, intending to pull her to safety.

5000|$|The Rajah's Ruby: Nick (Pat) and Katie (Tessa) {{read the}} {{newspaper}} and find out that their friends David and Sophie (Faith) have inherited a ruby. The ruby had been stolen from an Indian temple during a civil war and {{was believed to be}} bad luck. The ruby is then stolen and David and Sophie are kidnapped, but they manage to get a letter to Nick and Katie revealing where they are being taken. Nick and Katie manage to cycle from where they are spending their holiday to where David and Sophie are being held prisoner in Brinkin Towers. After their Aunt Dora breaks her leg, and Nick and Katie's mom returns to take care of her, Nick and Katie camp out on an island belonging to Brinkin towers. The twins manage to toss out the <b>key</b> <b>locking</b> them in, and Nick and Katie are able to release them. After their escape they hear the captors planning to move the captives to the island. One of the captors sneaks off and leaves the ruby on the island. He is accidentally scared off the island, and the remaining captors come to search for him. The children hide, but while the captors are on the island they sneak off and take their boat. They alert a policeman, who rounds up the captors and finds the ruby. The ruby is returned to a bank and the children spend the rest of their holidays together.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} the combinatorial {{complexity of the}} algorithmic design of mechanical master <b>key</b> <b>locking</b> systems. Such locking systems use pin tumblers and prole elements (wards) to realize the functional dependencies given by a key/cylinder matrix. We prove that even very restricted versions of the masterkeying problem are NP-complete. We show that the general masterkeying problem can be dened by an integer linear program whose number of variables and restrictions is polynomial {{in the size of}} the key/cylinder matrix and the size of the locking system. Heuristic solutions are also discussed. 1 Introduction A master key system is a mechanical locking system for medium and large buildings. It enables various persons with dierent access authorizations to open all relevant doors with only one key. The main advantages of masterkeying are security with only a few keys, simple organization of a hierarchical authorization structure, and comfortable handling by only one key for all relev [...] ...|$|E

Whereas the SHIFT <b>LOCK</b> <b>key</b> found on both C64 and C128 is simply a mechanical latch for the left SHIFT <b>key,</b> the CAPS <b>LOCK</b> <b>key</b> on the C128 can be read via the 8502's built-in I/O port. A few C64 programs are confused by this extra I/O bit; keeping the CAPS <b>LOCK</b> <b>key</b> in the down position will force the I/O line low, matching the C64's configuration and resolving the issue.|$|R
