2500|$|Traffic-flow {{measurement}} and automatic <b>incident</b> <b>detection</b> using video cameras is {{another form of}} vehicle detection. [...] Since video detection systems such as those used in automatic number plate recognition do not involve installing any components directly into the road surface or roadbed, this type of system {{is known as a}} [...] "non-intrusive" [...] method of traffic detection. [...] Video from cameras is fed into processors that analyse the changing characteristics of the video image as vehicles pass. [...] The cameras are typically mounted on poles or structures above or adjacent to the roadway. [...] Most video detection systems require some initial configuration to [...] "teach" [...] the processor the baseline background image. [...] This usually involves inputting known measurements such as the distance between lane lines or the height of the camera above the roadway. [...] A single video detection processor can detect traffic simultaneously from one to eight cameras, depending on the brand and model. The typical output from a video detection system is lane-by-lane vehicle speeds, counts, and lane occupancy readings. [...] Some systems provide additional outputs including gap, headway, stopped-vehicle detection, and wrong-way vehicle alarms.|$|E

This algorithm has the potential to provide local monitoring of traffic sensors. Our approach is based on macroscopic traffic flow models, and more precisely on the flow-density relationship. Once this relation is extracted from real traffic data, an admissible region is defined in the flow-density space. Then, the classification properties of neural networks are used to design the monitoring network, which detects and isolates the incidents that disturb the traffic when the measured data are out of the defined regio...|$|R

40|$|Enterotoxins {{produced}} by {{different species of}} the Bacillus cereus group, such as cytotoxin K 1 (CytK 1) and non-haemolytic enterotoxin (NHE), {{have been associated with}} diarrhoeal food poisoning <b>incidents.</b> <b>Detection</b> of CytK 1 is not possible with commercial assays while NHE is recognised by an immunological kit (TECRA) that does not specifically target this protein because it is based on polyclonal antibodies. It is evident that the lack of suitable tools for the study of enterotoxins hampers the possibilities for accurate hazard identification and characterisation in microbial food safety risk assessment. We applied matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS) for the detection of CytK 1 and NHE {{produced by}} pathogenic strains of the B. cereus group using protein digests from 1 D gel electrophoresis. Secretion of CytK 1 and two of the three components of NHE was confirmed in supernatants of different B. cereus cultures. For each protein, we introduce biomarkers {{that could be used for}} the screening of food poisoning or food/environmental isolates that can secrete enterotoxins. For example, tryptic peptides of 2, 310. 2 and 1, 192. 5 Da (calculated mass) can be indicators for CytK 1 and NheA, respectively, although a simultaneous detection of other enterotoxin-specific peptides is recommended to assure the presence of a toxin in an unknown sample. Comparison of MALDI-TOF/MS with the TECRA kit showed that our methodological strategy performed well and it had the competitive advantage of specifically detecting NheA. Therefore, MALDI-TOF/MS can be successfully incorporated into risk assessment procedures in order to determine the involvement of strains of the B. cereus group in foodborne outbreaks, including the recently described cytK 1 producing species, Bacillus cytotoxicus...|$|R

40|$|In the {{transportation}} field {{the problem of}} the optimal resources management has led to the spreading {{in the last years of}} the so-called of TDM (Travel Demand Management) policies. On the other hand the technological progress has contributed to the development of the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). For real-time travel time studies probe vehicles are an important source for measuring congestion, delays and <b>incident</b> <b>detections.</b> Some experiments made in America and in Europe (i. e., Socrates, Advance, Euroscout, Verdi) have shown the positive features and useful expedients in order to implement traffic monitoring system with probe vehicles. The statistical problem of significance of the data surveyed by a limited number of probe vehicles constitutes a non-undervaluable obstacle. Moreover, the cost of collecting travel time data depends on the number of probe vehicles required. The improvement of the road network performances does not justify the costs of acquisition and management of a probe vehicle fleet. Since both the buses and cars often operate on the same roadway and under the same traffic conditions, there should be some correlations between these two modes. Consequently, this work proposes the use of buses, equipped with a system of Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL), as probe in the traffic in order to estimate the real-time traffic flow conditions. The aim of this paper is the implementation of a method to estimate road network performances through a function that joins bus travel time and car travel time. The results demonstrate the robustness of the model in describing the status of the road transportation system. Research perspectives can be addressed to the definition of network control strategies and to the emergency management using the proposed methodology...|$|R

Increasingly, technology advancements and applications are providing invaluable integration opportunities to interconnect safety, maintenance, ITS, traffic operations, facilities, and transportation equipment programs to maximize available resources and achieve efficiency in transportation operations. This research focuses on one of the prominent ITS devices: Dynamic Message Signs (DMS) operations. Using real time incident management operations data and ITS operations data, an attempt is made to develop ITS Operations Evaluations Models (ITSOEMs) that are capable of quantifying the operations value of DMS and their complementing ITS surveillance and detection systems, such as CCTV, Safety Service Patrol (SSP) and Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) systems. The I- 95 corridor in the state of Virginia is selected as the Study Corridor. Operations data from the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) on DMS and ITS <b>detection</b> systems and <b>incident</b> management is analyzed to accomplish four key research objectives: a) To collect, extract and evaluate real time operations data from VDOT ITS and incident management operations programs and identify the factors contributing to the successful operation of DMS for the duration of incidents and events occurring on the I- 95 Study Corridor; b) To develop analytical models to determine measurable influence of <b>incident</b> <b>detections</b> in successfully disseminating messages on DMS; c) To develop ITS Operations evaluation models to determine the effectiveness of DMS messages during incidents by quantifying the influence of DMS messages in the deterrence of secondary incidents on the I- 95 Study Corridor; and d) To develop guidelines on the application of these quantitative ITS evaluation models so that transportation engineers can effectively use these models to perform ITS evaluations at other ITS locations.
