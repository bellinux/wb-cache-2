30|$|Unlike other exoelectrogens, such as G. sulfurreducens, {{in which}} the {{electrons}} are derived from biochemical oxidation of organic compounds via the respiratory electron <b>transfer</b> <b>chain</b> [127], cyanobacterial electrogenic activity does not need exogenous organic fuel and is entirely dependent on the energy of light, which drives the biophotolysis of water through the photosynthetic electron <b>transfer</b> <b>chain</b> in the cyanobacteria, releasing electrons [128, 129]. The electrogenic activity of cyanobacteria may represent a form of overflow metabolism to protect cells under high-intensity light [70, 129].

40|$|Rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides grown under nonrigorous {{anaerobic}} {{conditions in the}} light developed components of a branched respiratory electron <b>transfer</b> <b>chain,</b> and a photosynthetic electron <b>transfer</b> <b>chain.</b> Both respiratory pathways were sensitive to rotenone and high concentrations of cyanide, but oxygen uptake was only partially inhibited {{by the addition of}} low concentrations of cyanide or antimycin A. When incubated anaerobically in the dark, R. sphaeroides responded positively to an oxygen gradient in the absence of rotenone. In the presence of rotenone, aerotaxis only occurred when the antimycin A-sensitive branch of the pathway was functioning, although both branches still reduced oxygen. Although there was electron movement along the respiratory chain, aerotaxis only occurred in response to a change in proton motive force. When incubated anaerobically in the light, the movement of R. sphaeroides up a light gradient depended on photosynthetic electron transport. When incubated aerobically, high-intensity actinic illumination inhibited oxygen uptake and aerotaxis. In a low-intensity light gradient the phototactic response was inhibited by oxygen.

40|$|The enteron Escherichia coli is {{equipped}} with a branched electron <b>transfer</b> <b>chain</b> that mediates chemiosmotic electron transfer, that drives ATP synthesis. The components of this electron <b>transfer</b> <b>chain</b> couple the oxidation of available electron donors from cellular metabolism (e. g. NADH, succinate, lactate, formate, etc.) to the reduction of electron acceptors like oxygen, nitrate, fumarate, di-methyl-sulfoxide, etc. Three different quinones, i. e. ubiquinone, demethyl-menaquinone and menaquinone, couple the transfer of electrons between the dehydrogenases and reductases/oxidases that constitute this electron <b>transfer</b> <b>chain,</b> whereas the two-component regulation system ArcB/A regulates gene expression, to allow the organism to adapt itself to the ambient conditions of available electron donors and acceptors. Here we report that E. coli can grow and adjust well to transitions in the availability of oxygen, with any of the three quinones as its single quinone. In all three ‘single-quinone’ E. coli strains transitions in the activity of ArcB are observed, as evidenced by changes in the level of phosphorylation of the response regulator ArcA, upon depletion/readmission of oxygen. These results lead us to conclude that all quinol species of E. coli can reduce (i. e. activate) the sensor ArcB and all three quinones oxidize (i. e. de-activate) it. These results also confirm our earlier conclusion that demethyl-menaquinone can function in aerobic respiration...|$|R
