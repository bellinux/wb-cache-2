Insulin pump is most commonly used in the treatment of type 1 diabetes. The aim of the thesis was {{to find out what the}} specifics in treating the patient with an insulin pump are. To achieve this, the empirical part of the thesis was elaborated by means of a qualitative research survey, which was carried out through semi-structured interviews with insulin pump users and nurses working in diabetes counselling. We have achieved many interesting results through research. Every patient who wants to be treated with an insulin pump undergoes 6 -day hospitalization during which insulin pump handling is learned. From patient interviews, we also learn that the most common complication is hypoglycaemia. Hypoglycaemia is most often caused by a <b>dietary</b> <b>mistake</b> or an incorrect amount of insulin administered to the body. However, hypoglycaemia can be prevented by using a sensor that is inserted into the subcutaneous tissue and reads the blood glucose every five to ten minutes. It was also found that nurses are not the main source of information for insulin pump users. The results of the research revealed that the most frequent use of the patient education is the representative of the company from which the patient has an insulin pump. Thanks to this thesis, there is now a well-arranged material which not just the medical staff can use to learn about the biggest difficulties and its possible solutions for the patients with insulin pumps. Thanks to this material, nurses in ordinary wards can also understand the needs of an insulin pump patient...|$|E
40|$|In the 50 {{years during}} which traveler’s {{diarrhea}} has been studied, {{it has always}} been assumed that personal hygiene precautions can prevent or reduce the likelihood of developing traveler’s diarrhea. However, 7 of 8 studies that specifically addressed this issue showed no correlation between the types of food selected and the risk of acquiring traveler’s diarrhea. The eighth study showed a correlation between a few <b>dietary</b> <b>mistakes</b> and a decreased risk of acquiring traveler’s diarrhea. A further {{increase in the number of}} <b>dietary</b> <b>mistakes,</b> however, did not continue to increase the risk of acquiring traveler’s diarrhea. Personal hygiene precautions, when performed under the direct supervision of an expatriate operating his or her own kitchen, can prevent traveler’s diarrhea, but poor restaurant hygiene in most developing countries continues to create an insur-mountable risk of acquiring traveler’s diarrhea. The adage “Boil it, cook it, peel it, or forget it ” has been asserted so often as an effective method to prevent trav-eler’s diarrhea that it seems almost sacrilegious to ques-tion it. A search for this phrase on the Internet via Google yielded 4230 references. At the time of this writing, no one seems to be certain of the origin of the phrase, whic...|$|R

Theory defines concept of arterial hypertension, summarizes the risk factors of arterial hypertension, epidemiology and treatment. The last part of my work {{was focused on}} the most important findings in dietology, which are crucially important in treatment of arterial hypertension. Practical part of my work was based on anonymous questionnaire survey. Questionnaire includes questions on lifestyle and eating habits of patients with severe arterial hypertension. The aim of the study was determine whether patients follow recomended dietary intervention and the most common diet mistakes of patients. We have included 55 patients, predominantly males, mean age 52 ± 13 years and BMI 32 ± 5 kg/m 2. The diet regime was often irregular with frequent absence of breakfast. Intake of fruits, vegetables and fish was insufficient. In the composition of the diet frequently occurring adverse sausages, butter, fatty cheese and cream products. Also we have found inappropriately high intake of sugary beverages and food, whether in the form of pastries or sweets. Study has also shown that observed patients rarely engage in physical activities. In conclusion, study shows which <b>dietary</b> <b>mistakes</b> [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This research, {{which was}} {{conducted}} with crew members of an America's Cup team, had the following objectives: (a) to assess energy expenditure and intake during training; (b) to evaluate the sailors' diet, and (c) to identify any dietary flaws to determine the appropriate intake of nutrients, correct possible <b>dietary</b> <b>mistakes,</b> and improve their food habits. Energy expenditure was estimated on 15 sailors using direct measurements (oxygen consumption) and a 3 -day activity questionnaire. Oxygen consumption was measured on sailors during both on-water America's Cup sailing training and dry-land fitness training. Composition of the diet was estimated using a 3 -day food record. Average daily energy expenditure of the sailors ranged from 14. 95 to 24. 4 MJ, depending on body mass and boat role, with the highest values found in grinders and mastmen. Daily energy intake ranged from 15. 7 to 23. 3 MJ (from + 6 % to - 18 % of energy expenditure). The contributions of carbohydrate, protein, and fat to total energy intake were 43 %, 18 %, and 39 % respectively, values {{that are not in}} accord with the recommended guidelines for athletes. Our results show the importance of assessing energy balance and food habits for America's Cup sailors performing different roles. The practical outcome of this study was that the sailors were given dietary advice and prescribed a Mediterranean diet, explained in specific nutrition lectures...|$|R

Nutrition {{is an important factor}} in the development of youth, as well as the current and future state of health. The aim of the study was to show the benefits of the application of cluster analysis to assess the dietary habits of high school students. The survey was carried out on 1, 631 eighteen-year-old students in seven randomly selected secondary schools in Bialystok using a self-prepared anonymous questionnaire. An evaluation of the time of day meals were eaten and the number of meals consumed was made for the surveyed students. The cluster analysis allowed distinguishing characteristic structures of dietary habits in the observed population. Four clusters were identified, which were characterized by relative internal homogeneity and substantial variation in terms of the number of meals during the day and the time of their consumption. The most important characteristics of cluster 1 were cumulated food ration in 2 or 3 meals and long intervals between meals. Cluster 2 was characterized by eating the recommended number of 4 or 5 meals a day. In the 3 rd cluster, students ate 3 meals a day with large intervals between them, and in the 4 th they had four meals a day while maintaining proper intervals between them. In all clusters <b>dietary</b> <b>mistakes</b> occurred, but most of them were related to clusters 1 and 3. Cluster analysis allowed for the identification of major flaws in nutrition, which may include irregular eating and skipping meals, and indicated possible connections between eating patterns and disturbances of body weight in the examined population...|$|R
40|$|The problem {{raised in}} the study relates to the eating habits of {{students}} and their relations with the body mass index (BMI). The effect of selected socio-demographic variables (sex, place of residence, material status, field of study) on eating habits of the respondents was also analysed. The structure of the Dietary Behaviour Index (DBI) was proposed and its relations to the BMI were established. Material and methods. The study covered 508 students of state and private universities in Poznań (Poland) of whom 73 % were female and 27 % male. The study used an anonymous questionnaire poll on the basic dietary habits developed {{on the basis of}} the Food Pyramid guidelines as well as the Golden Charter of Correct Nutrition. The BMI was calculated on the students’ self-reported weight and height. Results. 15 % of the participating students are overweight or obese. The distribution of the BMI differs between men and women (p<. 000). Particularly unfavourable behaviour was noted in terms of the consumption of legumes (72 % of respondents), fish (53 %), dairy products (36 %), vegetables (29 %) and fruit (27 %). Beneficial trends relate to the everyday consumption of breakfast (63 %), the number of meals per day (59 %), limiting the consumption of red meat (59 %), including vegetable fats in the daily diet (56 %). The differences in the way of eating described by the DBI is related to the field of study (p<. 001) as physical education students had the best indicators. Conclusions. In the studied group of students overweight and obesity are not as frequent as in other countries of Western Europe or America. We noted a number of <b>dietary</b> <b>mistakes</b> made by the respondents, which can lead to adverse health consequences in the future. During the university studies, not 164 | I.

40|$|Background. Understanding the {{principles}} of prophylaxis, and awareness {{of the importance of}} proper nutrition in maintaining wellbeing should be a part of every doctor–patient relationship. Objectives. An evaluation of the sources of knowledge and access to information about healthy nutrition in primary care outpatient clinics. Material and methods. The study comprised 222 subjects (150 women and 72 men) aged 18 – 87 years (median 47. 5). The study used a self-prepared questionnaire. Results. 97. 7 % of the patients (n = 217) were aware of the impact of diet on health, of which only 9. 9 % (n = 22) knew the rules of healthy nutrition well, 55. 4 % (n = 123) had knowledge at a medium level, and 31. 1 % (n = 69) at a low level. <b>Dietary</b> <b>mistakes</b> were more frequently reported by men (p = 0. 001), and lack of time (38. 2 %; n = 85) and knowledge (29. 3 %; n = 65) were reported as the main reasons. The Internet (64. 9 %; n = 144) is the main source of knowledge about healthy nutrition. It is used mainly by younger people (78. 9 % < 50 years; n = 97 vs. 47. 5 % ≥ 50 years; n = 47; p < 0. 001). People ≥ 50 years prefer to talk with a doctor (22. 2 %; n = 22 vs. 4. 9 %; n = 6; p < 0. 001). Patients expect to get dietary education in their primary care outpatient clinic in the form of leaflets (58. 6 %; n = 130), posters (25. 7 %; n = 57), conversation with a doctor (36. 9 %; n = 82), and consultation with a nutritionist (33. 3 %; n = 74). Significantly more women want to get information directly from a doctor (p = 0. 01). Conclusions. The primary care outpatient clinic is an important source of information on healthy nutrition. Patients expect access to information in the form of leaflets and medical or dietary consultations conducted in a family doctor’s practice. We should consider the implementation of educational programmes on {{the principles}} of healthy nutrition in primary care outpatient clinics...|$|R

Taste {{disorders in}} the elderly Magdalena Sykuła, Aleksandra Stelmach, Monika Szacoń, Katarzyna Kuśmierz, Małgorzata Sutuła, Marcin Rząca, Hanna Kachaniuk Introduction: Disorders of the sense of taste mainly affect the elderly. There are many factors that contribute to their development, including various types of chronic diseases, polypharmacy, and the use of stimulants. Taste impairments lead to improper nutritional behaviour in the elderly, which may cause deterioration of their health and reduce their quality of life. Goal: The aim of the study was to estimate taste deficits in the elderly. Method: The participants were 24 persons aged 70 – 86. Sample size was limited by the number of available professional taste test kits (for identification of the four basic gustatory qualities: sweet, salty, sour, and bitter). The respondents were assisted by a researcher to fill in a survey about their health status, eating habits, and subjective assessment of their taste function. Results: Most of the elderly persons assessed their taste function as being good, and the rating increased with the age of the participants. However, the organoleptic test showed that taste identification became less accurate with age. The participants had the greatest trouble recognizing the salty (58 %) and sour (79 %) tastes and had much less difficulty identifying the sweet (96 %) and bitter (92 %) tastes. The subjects' perception of taste became less and less intense with age. Conclusions: 	The seniors were the least likely to accurately recognize the salty taste. 	With age, the accuracy of identification of sweet, sour, bitter and salty gustatory qualities became lower. 	The positive subjective assessment of the taste function in the elderly did not go hand in hand with their actual taste perception, which declined with age. 	The use of stimulants such as alcohol and tobacco, pharmacological treatment of chronic diseases, and use dental prostheses reduced the perceived intensity of taste. 	The taste disorders observed among the elderly can lead to <b>dietary</b> <b>mistakes</b> and thus negatively affect their health. Key words: dysgeusia, seniors, eating habits, health risk...|$|R
