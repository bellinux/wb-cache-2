5|$|The main {{rivers of}} Rùm were {{essentially}} just trickling streams, so Cranbourne {{came up with}} a plan to increase the power of the Kinloch River, by <b>diverting</b> the other two. In 1849, he built a dam at the end of Loch Sgathaig, allowing him to <b>diverting</b> the overflow into the Kilmory River (northwards), rather than the Abhainn Rhangail (southwards). In 1852, he attempted to dam the Kilmory River, half a mile north of Loch Sgathaig, the plan being to send the overflow into the Kinloch River via a short canal; unfortunately Salisbury's Dam collapsed shortly after being built.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{investigated}} the water relations of obligate riparian plants on paired <b>diverted</b> and undiverted reaches on Bishop Creek, Eastern Sierra Nevada. Riparian plants on <b>diverted</b> reaches had reduced stomatal conductance and water potential compared to plants on undiverted reaches {{in a dry}} year, {{but not in a}} high runoff year. Juvenile plants on <b>diverted</b> reaches had reduced stomatal conductance and lower midday water potentials relative to surrounding mature trees, a trend that was not observed on undiverted reaches. Plants on <b>diverted</b> reaches possessed significantly smaller, thicker leaves and a reduced total leaf area relative to trees on streamside reaches. Reduced community leaf area and effective stomatal control of water loss may allow riparian corridors on <b>diverted</b> reaches to retain their canopie...|$|R

5|$|The first {{studies and}} propositions {{to clean up}} the river date back to 1859, and during the {{following}} years, many different commissions of engineers were assigned to examine possible solutions. Dozens of different ideas were submitted, many of which were completely unfeasible. Several of them proposed <b>diverting</b> large amounts of cleaner water from other rivers upstream to dilute the Senne, while greatly improving the drainage system in the city. Other proposals involved <b>diverting</b> the main course of the Senne completely to the Lesser Senne, which would then be enlarged and thus more useful for boat traffic and mills. Others considered any sort of sanitization impossible, and proposed covering the Senne without greatly changing its course. Among these was a proposal to double the size of the underground drainage tunnels, creating space for a subterranean railroad tunnel. The idea was ahead of its time, but would be implemented a century later with the North–South connection.|$|E
5|$|Traffic {{through the}} village has been so heavy on {{weekends}} during summer and peak leaf peeping weekends in early autumn that many residents have proposed making Main Street one-way, carrying traffic only to the west, while <b>diverting</b> eastbound traffic onto either of two parallel streets. Other villages that have made such changes found making streets one-way decreased business at their retailers.|$|E

40|$|To date, Mars robotic {{landing site}} {{selection}} {{has been a}} compromise between scientific interest and safety. Due to the rather large landed footprint major axis lengths of the Viking, Pathfinder, Mars Exploration Rovers, and Phoenix missions, these landed ellipses {{have been placed in}} vast, relatively flat areas to ensure a high probability of landing success. Scientists are interested in exploring more geologically interesting areas that may contain landing hazards, including sloping terrain, craters, and rocks. Smart <b>Divert</b> is a new entry, descent, and landing architecture that could allow robotic missions to safely land in hazardous terrain without the requirement of hypersonic guidance. Smart <b>Divert</b> consists of a ballistic entry followed by supersonic parachute deployment. After parachute release, the vehicle <b>diverts</b> to one of many predefined, fuel-optimal safe zones.
