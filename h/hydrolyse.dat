5|$|Irreversible {{inhibition}} {{is different}} from irreversible enzyme inactivation. Irreversible inhibitors are generally specific for one class of enzyme and do not inactivate all proteins; they do not function by destroying protein structure but by specifically altering the active site of their target. For example, extremes of pH or temperature usually cause denaturation of all protein structure, {{but this is a}} non-specific effect. Similarly, some non-specific chemical treatments destroy protein structure: for example, heating in concentrated hydrochloric acid will <b>hydrolyse</b> the peptide bonds holding proteins together, releasing free amino acids.|$|E
5|$|Since the RCL {{is still}} covalently {{attached}} to the protease via the ester bond, the S to R transition pulls protease from the top {{to the bottom of}} the serpin and distorts the catalytic triad. The distorted protease can only <b>hydrolyse</b> the acyl enzyme intermediate extremely slowly and so the protease remains covalently attached for days to weeks. Serpins are classed as irreversible inhibitors and as suicide inhibitors since each serpin protein permanently inactivates a single protease, and can only function once.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{category}} of nitrides are the interstitial nitrides of formulae MN, M2N, and M4N (although variable composition is perfectly possible), where the small nitrogen atoms are positioned {{in the gaps}} in a metallic cubic or hexagonal close-packed lattice. They are opaque, very hard, and chemically inert, melting only at very high temperatures (generally over 2500°C). They have a metallic lustre and conduct electricity as do metals. They <b>hydrolyse</b> only very slowly to give ammonia or nitrogen.|$|E
40|$|By {{means of}} {{chromatography}} on DEAE-Sephadex, two arylamidases (<b>hydrolysing</b> L-arginine 2 -naphthylamide) and three dipeptidyl peptidases (<b>hydrolysing</b> dipeptide 2 -naphthylamides) were distinguished in extracts of rat muscle. However, the arylamidase {{from the larger}} peak also <b>hydrolysed</b> the dipeptide 2 -naphthylamides. Glycyl-L-arginine amide, an alternative substrate for dipeptidyl peptidase I, was not <b>hydrolysed</b> by arylamidase. L-Leucine amide was <b>hydrolysed</b> by an enzyme, presumed to be leucine aminopeptidase, from a separate peak, but was also <b>hydrolysed</b> by arylamidase. Arylamidase, dipeptidyl peptidase III {{and most of the}} leucine aminopeptidase could be extracted from the muscle with a neutral salt solution, but dipeptidyl peptidase I was extracted only in the presence of Triton X- 100; dipeptidyl peptidase II showed an intermediate extraction behaviour...|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{determine}} whether feeding infants with <b>hydrolysed</b> formula reduces {{their risk of}} allergic or autoimmune disease. Design Systematic review and meta-analysis, {{as part of a}} series of systematic reviews commissioned by the UK Food Standards Agency to inform guidelines on infant feeding. Two authors selected studies by consensus, independently extracted data, and assessed the quality of included studies using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Data Sources Medline, Embase, Web of Science, CENTRAL, and LILACS searched between January 1946 and April 2015. Eligibility Criteria For Selecting Studies Prospective intervention trials of <b>hydrolysed</b> cows’ milk formula compared with another <b>hydrolysed</b> formula, human breast milk, or a standard cows’ milk formula, which reported on allergic or autoimmune disease or allergic sensitisation. Results 37 eligible intervention trials of <b>hydrolysed</b> formula were identified, including over 19 000 participants. There was evidence of conflict of interest and high or unclear risk of bias in most studies of allergic outcomes and evidence of publication bias for studies of eczema and wheeze. Overall there was no consistent evidence that partially or extensively <b>hydrolysed</b> formulas reduce risk of allergic or autoimmune outcomes in infants at high pre-existing risk of these outcomes. Odds ratios for eczema at age 0 - 4, compared with standard cows’ milk formula, were 0. 84 (95 % confidence interval 0. 67 to 1. 07; I 2 = 30 %) for partially <b>hydrolysed</b> formula; 0. 55 (0. 28 to 1. 09; I 2 = 74 %) for extensively <b>hydrolysed</b> casein based formula; and 1. 12 (0. 88 to 1. 42; I 2 = 0 %) for extensively <b>hydrolysed</b> whey based formula. There was no evidence to support the health claim approved by the US Food and Drug Administration that a partially <b>hydrolysed</b> formula could reduce the risk of eczema nor the conclusion of the Cochrane review that <b>hydrolysed</b> formula could allergy to cows’ milk. COnclusion These findings do not support current guidelines that recommend the use of <b>hydrolysed</b> formula to prevent allergic disease in high risk infants. </p...|$|R
50|$|Family 26 {{encompasses}} mainly mannan endo-1,4-beta-mannosidases. Mannan endo-1,4-beta-mannosidase <b>hydrolyses</b> mannan and galactomannan, but displays little activity towards other {{plant cell}} wall polysaccharides. The enzyme randomly <b>hydrolyses</b> 1,4-beta-D-linkages in mannans, galacto-mannans, glucomannans and galactoglucomannans.|$|R
5|$|The {{second most}} studied triad is the Cysteine-Histidine-Aspartate motif. Several {{families}} of cysteine proteases use this triad set, for example TEV protease and papain. The triad acts similarly to serine protease triads, {{with a few}} notable differences. Due to cysteine's low pKa, {{the importance of the}} Asp to catalysis varies and several cysteine proteases are effectively Cys-His dyads (e.g. hepatitis A virus protease), whilst in others the cysteine is already deprotonated before catalysis begins (e.g. papain). This triad is also used by some amidases, such as N-glycanase to <b>hydrolyse</b> non-peptide C-N bonds.|$|E
5|$|Thorium {{is rather}} active chemically. Owing {{to lack of}} {{electrons}} on 6d and 5f orbitals, the tetravalent thorium compounds are colorless. At pH < 3, the solutions of thorium salts are dominated by the cations 4+. The Th4+ ion is relatively large, and depending on the coordination number can have a radius between 0.95 and 1.14 Å. As a result, thorium salts have a weak tendency to <b>hydrolyse.</b> The distinctive ability of thorium salts is their high solubility, not only in water, but also in polar organic solvents.|$|E
5|$|As stated above, the exosome complex {{contains}} many proteins with ribonuclease domains. The {{exact nature of}} these ribonuclease domains has changed across evolution from bacterial to archaeal to eukaryotic complexes as various activities have been gained and lost. The exosome is primarily a 3'-5' exoribonuclease, meaning that it degrades RNA molecules from their 3' end. Exoribonucleases contained in exosome complexes are either phosphorolytic (the RNase PH-like proteins) or, in eukaryotes, hydrolytic (the RNase R and RNase D domain proteins). The phosphorolytic enzymes use inorganic phosphate to cleave the phosphodiester bonds - releasing nucleotide diphosphates. The hydrolytic enzymes use water to <b>hydrolyse</b> these bonds - releasing nucleotide monophosphates.|$|E
50|$|PVA has {{a melting}} point of 230 °C and 180-190 °C (356-374 degrees Fahrenheit) for the fully <b>hydrolysed</b> and {{partially}} <b>hydrolysed</b> grades, respectively. It decomposes rapidly above 200 °C {{as it can}} undergo pyrolysis at high temperatures.|$|R
50|$|The {{two types}} of cholinesterase are {{acetylcholinesterase}} (ACHE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BCHE). The {{difference between the two}} types has to do with their respective preferences for substrates: the former <b>hydrolyses</b> acetylcholine more quickly; the latter <b>hydrolyses</b> butyrylcholine more quickly.|$|R

5|$|Enzyme {{production}} (transcription and {{translation of}} enzyme genes) {{can be enhanced}} or diminished by a cell in response {{to changes in the}} cell's environment. This form of gene regulation is called enzyme induction. For example, bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics such as penicillin because enzymes called beta-lactamases are induced that <b>hydrolyse</b> the crucial beta-lactam ring within the penicillin molecule. Another example comes from enzymes in the liver called cytochrome P450 oxidases, which are important in drug metabolism. Induction or inhibition of these enzymes can cause drug interactions. Enzyme levels can also be regulated by changing the rate of enzyme degradation.|$|E
5|$|Nucleases are {{enzymes that}} cut DNA strands by catalyzing the {{hydrolysis}} of the phosphodiester bonds. Nucleases that <b>hydrolyse</b> nucleotides from {{the ends of}} DNA strands are called exonucleases, while endonucleases cut within strands. The most frequently used nucleases in molecular biology are the restriction endonucleases, which cut DNA at specific sequences. For instance, the EcoRV enzyme shown to the left recognizes the 6-base sequence 5′-GATATC-3′ and makes a cut at the horizontal line. In nature, these enzymes protect bacteria against phage infection by digesting the phage DNA when it enters the bacterial cell, acting {{as part of the}} restriction modification system. In technology, these sequence-specific nucleases are used in molecular cloning and DNA fingerprinting.|$|E
5|$|The Serine-Histidine-Aspartate motif {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{thoroughly}} characterised catalytic motifs in biochemistry. The triad is exemplified by chymotrypsin, a model serine protease from the PA superfamily which uses its triad to <b>hydrolyse</b> protein backbones. The aspartate is hydrogen bonded to the histidine, increasing the pKa of its imidazole nitrogen from 7 to around 12. This allows the histidine to act as a powerful general base and to activate the serine nucleophile. It also has an oxyanion hole consisting of several backbone amides which stabilises charge build-up on intermediates. The histidine base aids the first leaving group by donating a proton, and also activates the hydrolytic water substrate by abstracting a proton as the remaining OH− attacks the acyl-enzyme intermediate.|$|E

25|$|Carbides {{of varying}} stoichiometries {{are known for}} the {{lanthanides}}. Non-stoichiometry is common. All of the lanthanides form LnC2 and Ln2C3 which both contain C2 units. The dicarbides with exception of EuC2, are metallic conductors with the calcium carbide structure and can be formulated as Ln3+C22−(e–). The C-C bond length is longer than that in CaC2, which contains the C22− anion, indicating that the antibonding orbitals of the C22− anion {{are involved in the}} conduction band. These dicarbides <b>hydrolyse</b> to form hydrogen and a mixture of hydrocarbons. EuC2 {{and to a lesser extent}} YbC2 <b>hydrolyse</b> differently producing a higher percentage of acetylene (ethyne). The sesquicarbides, Ln2C3 can be formulated as Ln4(C2)3. These compounds adopt the Pu2C3 structure which has been described as having C22− anions in bisphenoid holes formed by eight near Ln neighbours. The lengthening of the C-C bond is less marked in the sesquicarbides than in the dicarbides, with the exception of Ce2C3.|$|E
25|$|The {{nitrides}} can {{be prepared}} by the reaction of lanthanum metals with nitrogen. Some nitride is produced along with the oxide, when lanthanum metals are ignited in air. Alternative methods of synthesis are a high temperature reaction of lanthanide metals with ammonia or the decomposition of lanthanide amides, Ln(NH2)3. Achieving pure stoichiometric compounds, and crystals with low defect density has proved difficult. The lanthanide nitrides are sensitive to air and <b>hydrolyse</b> producing ammonia.|$|E
25|$|In vivo, {{chymotrypsin}} is a {{proteolytic enzyme}} (Serine protease) {{acting in the}} digestive systems of many organisms. It facilitates the cleavage of peptide bonds by a hydrolysis reaction, which despite being thermodynamically favorable occurs extremely slowly {{in the absence of}} a catalyst. The main substrates of chymotrypsin are peptide bonds in which the amino acid N-terminal to the bond is a tryptophan, tyrosine, phenylalanine, or leucine. Like many proteases, chymotrypsin will also <b>hydrolyse</b> amide bonds in vitro, a virtue that enabled the use of substrate analogs such as N-acetyl-L-phenylalanine p-nitrophenyl amide for enzyme assays.|$|E
40|$|Background Children {{allergic}} to cow's milk are fed a soy- or a <b>hydrolysed</b> cow's milk-based substitute. Neither can {{rule out a}} sensitization risk. Previous {{studies have shown that}} <b>hydrolysed</b> rice is tolerated by animals and children with multiple food hypersensitivities. Objective A prospective clinical assessment of tolerance to a rice-based <b>hydrolysed</b> formula was carried out in children {{allergic to}} cow's milk. Patients and methods One hundred children (42 girls and 58 boys, mean age 3. 17 +/- 2. 93 years, median 2. 20, range 0. 18 - 14. 6 years) with a history of immediate reactions to cow's milk and confirmed at double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) when not contraindicated were assessed for clinical tolerance to cow's milk proteins. Their allergy work-up included skin prick tests with whole milk, alpha-lactalbumin (ALA), beta-lactoglobulin (BLG) and total caseins, and specific IgE determinations using CAP technology were performed against whole milk, ALA, BLG and casein. Sensitization to rice and rice-based <b>hydrolysed</b> formula was similarly investigated. Patients' sera were evaluated at immunoblotting for specific IgE to cow's milk proteins, rice and rice-based <b>hydrolysed</b> formula. DBPCFC was carried out with increasing doses of a rice-based <b>hydrolysed</b> formula. Results All patients were sensitized to cow's milk and/or at least one cow's milk protein fraction. Eighty-seven out of 99 were positive to cow's milk and/or a cow's milk protein fraction at skin prick test. Positive (> 0. 35 kUA/L) specific IgE determinations were found for cow's milk and/or milk fractions (92 / 95), rice (21 / 91) and <b>hydrolysed</b> rice infant formula (4 / 91). At immunoblotting, sera from 96 children were positive to alpha-casein (n= 54), beta-casein (n= 38), ALA (n= 57), BLG (n= 37) and bovine serum albumin (n= 61). Similarly, although patients' sera often contained specific IgE against rice proteins at CAP (21 / 91) and immunoblotting (70 / 96), only six very weakly positive responses were observed against rice-based <b>hydrolysed</b> formula. All DBPCFC with rice-based <b>hydrolysed</b> formula were negative. Conclusions Rice-based <b>hydrolysed</b> formula is a possible alternative not only for children with multiple allergies, but also for children with cow's milk allergy...|$|R

25|$|The heavier chalcogens sulfur, selenium, and {{tellurium}} {{are known}} to form thorium chalcogenides, {{many of which have}} more complex structure than the oxides. Apart from several binary compounds, the oxychalcogenides ThOS (yellow), ThOSe, and ThOTe are also known. The five binary thorium sulfides – ThS (lustrous metallic), Th2S3 (brown metallic), Th7S12 (black), ThS2 (purple-brown), and Th2S5 (orange-brown) – may be produced by reacting hydrogen sulfide with thorium, its halides, or thoria (the last if carbon is present): they all <b>hydrolyse</b> in acidic solutions. The six selenides are analogous to the sulfides, with the addition of ThSe3. The five tellurides are also similar to the sulfides and selenides (although Th2Te5 is unknown), but have slightly different crystal structures: for example, ThS has the sodium chloride structure, but ThTe has the caesium chloride structure, since the Th4+ and Te2− ions are similar in size while the S2− ions are much smaller.|$|E
25|$|Ionic liquids {{are often}} {{moderate}} to poor conductors of electricity, non-ionizing (e.g., non-polar), highly viscous and frequently exhibit low vapor pressure. Their other properties are diverse: many have low combustibility, are thermally stable, with wide liquid regions, and favorable solvating properties {{for a range}} of polar and non-polar compounds. Many classes of chemical reactions, such as Diels-Alder reactions and Friedel-Crafts reactions, can be performed using ionic liquids as solvents. IL's can serve as solvents for biocatalysis. The miscibility of ionic liquids with water or organic solvents varies with side chain lengths on the cation and with choice of anion. They can be functionalized to act as acids, bases, or ligands, and are precursors salts in the preparation of stable carbenes. They have recently been found to <b>hydrolyse,</b> affording acidic or basic media in the aqueous milieu. Because of their distinctive properties, ionic liquids are attracting increasing attention in many fields, including organic chemistry, electrochemistry, catalysis, physical chemistry, and engineering; see for instance magnetic ionic liquid.|$|E
