25|$|Upon {{returning}} home from the war, Snake <b>Eyes</b> <b>met</b> with Colonel Hawk, who informed him that his family {{had been killed in}} a car accident (which involved the brother of the man who would eventually become Cobra Commander). Devastated, Snake Eyes accepts an offer to study the ninja arts with Storm Shadow's family, the Arashikage Clan. Over time, Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow became sword brothers, and unintentional rivals for the attention and favor of Storm Shadow's uncle, the Hard Master. During one of Snake Eyes' training sessions, the Hard Master expressed his desire for Snake Eyes to take over leadership of the Arashikage clan instead of Storm Shadow. Snake Eyes refused, but then Zartan—hired by Cobra Commander to avenge the death of his brother—mistakenly killed the Hard Master instead of Snake-Eyes, using an arrow he stole from Storm Shadow. With Storm Shadow believed responsible for the death of the Hard Master, the Arashikage ninja clan dissolved. Snake Eyes returned to America, where he took up residence in the High Sierra mountains, and was eventually recruited for the G.I. Joe Team by Hawk and Stalker.|$|E
2500|$|In July 1824, Airy met Richarda Smith (1804–1875), [...] "a great beauty", on {{a walking}} tour of Derbyshire. He later wrote, [...] "Our <b>eyes</b> <b>met</b> ... and my fate was sealed ... I felt irresistibly {{that we must}} be united," [...] and Airy {{proposed}} two days later. Richarda's father, the Revd Richard Smith, felt that Airy lacked the financial resources to marry his daughter. Only in 1830, with Airy established in his Cambridge position, was permission for the marriage granted.|$|E
2500|$|After {{two months}} of interrogations, Rîmaru {{admitted}} to 23 very serious crimes. In fact, he {{had been arrested for}} only three murders; the rest (another murder, six attempted murders, five rapes, one attempted rape, and seven thefts of various degrees) he or his father confessed to. On one hand, he tried to convince the authorities that he was not responsible on the grounds of insanity, and that he did not realize the women would die; on the other hand, he insisted he was guilty, asking to be taken to the scenes of his crimes. During police lineups, victims brought in to identify him would tremble when their <b>eyes</b> <b>met</b> his, despite there being no danger to them now. Allegedly, for the public at large, Rîmaru's name itself inspired a vague dread; rîmă/râmă means [...] "earthworm" [...] in Romanian.|$|E

60|$|<b>Eye</b> <b>met</b> <b>eye,</b> and {{expectation}} was lively {{among those}} primitive and untaught savages. At length Crowsfeather arose to answer, the missionary standing the whole time, motionless, {{as if waiting}} for a reply.|$|R
60|$|Once {{the doctor}} had to be called. He shook his head but his <b>eye</b> <b>met</b> Miss Grower's, and he said nothing.|$|R
2500|$|Felix, being bisexual, was {{not certain}} {{if he was}} [...] "fit for marriage." [...] Still, {{he was drawn to}} Irina and her icon-like beauty when he first {{encountered}} her. [...] "One day when I was out riding I met a very beautiful girl accompanied by an elderly lady. Our <b>eyes</b> <b>met</b> and she made such an impression on me that I reined in my horse to gaze at her as she walked on," [...] he wrote in his memoirs. One day in 1910, he was paid a visit by Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich and Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna and was happy to discover the girl he had seen on the riding trail was their only daughter, Irina. [...] "This time I {{had plenty of time to}} admire the wondrous beauty of the girl who was eventually to become my wife and lifelong companion. She had beautiful features, clear-cut as a cameo, and looked very like her father." [...] He renewed his acquaintance with Irina in 1913 and was even more drawn to her. [...] "She was very shy and reserved, which added a certain mystery to her charm.... Little by little, Irina became less timid. At first her eyes were more eloquent than her conversation but, as she became more expansive, I learned to admire the keenness of her intelligence and her sound judgment. I concealed nothing in my past life from her, and, far from being perturbed by what I told her, she showed great tolerance and comprehension." [...] Yusupov wrote that Irina, perhaps because she had grown up with so many brothers, showed none of the artifice or lack of honesty that had put him off relations with other women.|$|E
60|$|Still {{they came}} from below, boat after boat, in endless procession. The uneasiness of Bill and Kink increased. They stole speculative, {{tentative}} glances at each other, and when their <b>eyes</b> <b>met</b> looked away in embarrassment. Finally, however, their <b>eyes</b> <b>met</b> and neither looked away.|$|E
60|$|She {{started at}} his voice, which {{she seemed to}} know, and their <b>eyes</b> <b>met.</b> Their <b>eyes</b> <b>met</b> and a great light of {{happiness}} shot into her sweet face and shone there till it was covered up and lost in the warm blush that followed.|$|E

60|$|His <b>eye</b> <b>met</b> Honoria's. One big deep sigh {{swelled to}} his lips and burst. She seemed to {{recollect}} herself, rose, passed her arm through Argemone's, and walked slowly away.|$|R
60|$|The woman's <b>eye</b> <b>met</b> the <b>eye</b> of Mr. Waddington as {{she stood}} for a moment in the doorway before taking her departure. She raised her fist and shook it.|$|R

6000|$|A low murmur, {{expressive}} of satisfaction, passed {{round the}} circle, for Detroit {{was then the}} most important of all the posts held by the Americans, along the whole line of the great lakes. <b>Eye</b> <b>met</b> <b>eye</b> in surprise and admiration; then one of the older chiefs yielded to his interest in the subject, and inquired: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And so may you," [...] I thought. My <b>eye</b> <b>met</b> his as {{the idea}} crossed my mind: {{he seemed to}} read the glance, {{answering}} as if its import had been spoken as well as imagined-- ...|$|R
60|$|Their <b>eyes</b> <b>met,</b> {{and there}} was {{singularly}} little tenderness in their eyes.|$|E

60|$|Her <b>eye</b> <b>met</b> the glance of Egremont. That brow full {{of thought}} and majesty was fixed on his. He {{encountered}} that face radiant as a seraph's; those dark eyes flashing with the inspiration of the martyr.|$|R
60|$|Miss Muir, in the charmingly prim and puritanical {{dress of}} a Roundhead damsel, was {{arranging}} some shrubs, but turned suddenly {{and dropped the}} green branch she held, as her <b>eye</b> <b>met</b> the glittering figure advancing toward her.|$|R
6000|$|Gerald's colour rose, but Marian's <b>eye</b> <b>met</b> his, and {{he remembered}} what she had said, and {{answered}} quietly, [...] "I don't know whether Fern Torr is poky, {{but it is a}} place where people are taught to behave well." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I know {{no higher}} sentiment," [...] said Theodora {{in a low}} voice, and yet which sounded like the {{breathing}} of some divine shrine, and her Athenian <b>eye</b> <b>met</b> the fiery glance of Lady Corisande {{with an expression of}} noble sympathy.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Ramage!" [...] she began, and {{his mouth}} sealed hers and his breath was mixed with her breath. Her <b>eye</b> <b>met</b> his four inches away, and his was glaring, immense, and full of resolution, a stupendous monster of an eye.|$|R
6000|$|When Ishmael had {{delivered}} his mind thus far, {{he paused and}} looked about him, {{as if he would}} trace the effects in the countenances of his hearers. When his <b>eye</b> <b>met</b> that of Middleton, he was answered by the latter-- ...|$|R
