40|$|Our {{previous}} studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of Bufei Yishen granules combined with acupoint sticking therapy (the <b>integrated</b> <b>therapy)</b> in {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD), but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Dysfunction of pulmonary surfactant proteins (SPs, including SP-A, SP-B, SP-C, and SP-D) may be included in pathophysiology of COPD. This study aimed to explore the mechanism of the <b>integrated</b> <b>therapy</b> on SPs. COPD rat models were established. The treatment groups received Bufei Yishen granules or acupoint sticking or their combination. Using aminophylline as a positive control drug. The levels of SPs in serum, BALF, and lung were measured. The results showed that the <b>integrated</b> <b>therapy</b> markedly reduced the levels of SPs in serum and increased these indicators in the lung. The <b>integrated</b> <b>therapy</b> was better than aminophylline in reducing the levels of SPs and was better than Bufei Yishen granules in reducing SP-A, SP-C, and SP-D in serum. The <b>integrated</b> <b>therapy</b> was better than aminophylline and Bufei Yishen granules in increasing SP-A, SP-B, and SP-D mRNA in the lung. SP-A and SP-D in BALF were positively correlated with PEF and EF 50. The levels of SPs are associated with airway limitation.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Although bipolar {{disorder}} {{and substance use}} disorder frequently co-occur, there is little information {{on the effectiveness of}} behavioral treatment for this population. <b>Integrated</b> group <b>therapy,</b> which addresses the two disorders simultaneously, was compared with group drug counseling, which focuses on substance use. The authors hypothesized that patients receiving <b>integrated</b> group <b>therapy</b> would have fewer days of substance use and fewer weeks ill with {{bipolar disorder}}. METHOD: A randomized controlled trial compared 20 weeks of <b>integrated</b> group <b>therapy</b> or group drug counseling with 3 months of posttreatment follow-up. Sixty-two patients with bipolar disorder and current substance dependence, treated with mood stabilizers for 3 ̆eor= 2 weeks, were randomly assigned to <b>integrated</b> group <b>therapy</b> (N= 31) or group drug counseling (N= 31). The primary outcome measure was the number of days of substance use. The primary mood outcome was the number of weeks ill with a mood episode. RESULTS: Intention-to-treat analysis revealed significantly fewer days of substance use for <b>integrated</b> group <b>therapy</b> patients during treatment and follow-up. Groups were similar in the number of weeks ill with bipolar disorder during treatment and follow-up, although <b>integrated</b> group <b>therapy</b> patients had more depressive and manic symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Integrated</b> group <b>therapy,</b> a new treatment developed specifically for patients with bipolar disorder and substance dependence, appears to be a promising approach to reduce substance use in this population...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Integrated {{behavior}} therapy {{approaches are}} defined by the combination of behavioral and or cognitive interventions targeting neurocognition combined with other goal-oriented treatment targets such as social cognition, social skills, or educational issues. The Integrated Psychological Therapy Program (IPT) {{represents one of the}} very first behavior therapy approaches combining interventions of neurocognition, social cognition, and social competence. This comprehensive group-based bottom-up and top-down approach consists of five subprograms, each with incremental steps. IPT has been successfully implemented in several countries in Europe, America, Australia and in Asia. IPT worked as a model for some other approaches designed in the USA. IPT was undergone two further developments: based on the social competence part of IPT, the three specific therapy programs focusing residential, occupational or recreational topics were developed. Recently, the cognitive part of INT was rigorously expanded into the Integrated Neurocognitive Therapy (INT) designed exclusively for outpatient treatment: INT includes interventions targeting all neurocognitive and social cognitive domains defined by the NIMH-MATRICS initiative. These group and partially PC-based exercises are structured into four therapy modules, each starting with exercises on neurocognitive domains followed by social cognitive targets. Efficacy: The evidence of <b>integrated</b> <b>therapy</b> approaches and its advantage compared to of one-track interventions was becoming a discussion tool in therapy research as well as in mental health systems. Results of meta-analyses support superiority of integrated approaches compared to one-track interventions in more distal outcome areas such as social functioning. These results are in line with the large body of 37 independent IPT studies in 12 countries. Moreover, IPT research indicates the maintenance of therapy effects after the end of therapy and some evidence generalization effects. Additionally, the international randomized multi-center study on INT with 169 outpatients strongly supports the successful therapy of <b>integrated</b> <b>therapy</b> in proximal and distal outcome such as significant effects in cognition, functioning and negative symptoms. Clinical implication: therapy research as well as expert’s clinical experience recommends <b>integrated</b> <b>therapy</b> approaches such as IPT to be successful agents within multimodal psychiatric treatment concepts. Finally, integrated group therapy based on cognitive remediation seems to motivate and stimulate schizophrenia inpatients and outpatients to more successful and independent life also demanded by the recovery movement...|$|E

40|$|Objective. To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} <b>integrated</b> <b>therapy</b> on the functional status of patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA). Methods. A total of 140 subjects with bilateral knee OA (Altman grade II) were randomized sequentially into 4 groups (groups I–IV). Group I received isokinetic exercises; group II received isokinetic exercise and pulse ultrasound for periarticular soft tissue pain; group III received isokinetic exercise, pulse ultrasound, and intraarticular hyaluronan therapy; and group IV acted as the control group. The therapeutic effects of the interventions were evaluated by changes in Lequesne’s index, knee range of motion, peak muscle torques of knee flexion and extension, and ambulation speed after 8 weeks of treatment and at followup 1 year later. In addition, changes in visual analog scale pain and rates of attrition in each group were also recorded. Results. Patients in groups I–III exhibited increased muscle peak torques and significantly reduced pain and disability after treatment and at followup. Groups II and III showed significant improvements in range of motion and ambulation speed after treatment. Group III also showed the greatest increase in walking speed and decrease in disability after treatment and at followup. Both group II and group III had significant gains in muscular strength after treatment and at followup; group III showed the greatest gains. Conclusion.
