5|$|Most modern {{historians have}} noted how the Gregorian missionaries come across in Bede's account as {{colourless}} and boring, {{compared to the}} Irish missionaries in Northumbria, and this is related directly to the way Bede gathered his information. The historian Henry Mayr-Harting argues that in addition, most of the Gregorian missionaries were concerned with the Roman virtue of gravitas, or personal dignity not given to emotional displays, and this would <b>have</b> <b>limited</b> the colourful stories available about them.|$|E
5|$|Reconstructions of ankylosaur forelimb {{musculature}} made by Coombs in 1978 {{suggest that}} the forelimbs bore {{the majority of the}} animal's weight, and were adapted for high force delivery on the front feet, possibly for food gathering. In addition, Coombs suggested that ankylosaurs may have been capable diggers, though the hoof-like structure of the manus would <b>have</b> <b>limited</b> fossorial activity. Ankylosaurs were likely to have been slow-moving and sluggish animals, though they may have been capable of quick movements when necessary.|$|E

5|$|According to {{traditional}} gender roles in Malawi, men operate {{primarily in the}} formal work sector and are responsible for supporting their families through paid labor, whereas women, who are valued for their domestic skills, are responsible for agricultural labor and care work; this gender-based division of labor decreases women's autonomy, thereby increasing their vulnerability to HIV/AIDS. Even within the home, women often lack bargaining power because they <b>have</b> <b>limited</b> access to education, formal employment, and other resources that could give {{them a sense of}} financial and personal independence. Women who are able to work in the formal sector typically earn significantly less money than men, even when they are completing the same tasks, making {{it difficult for them to}} elevate their status.|$|E
5|$|Although condoms {{effectively}} {{prevent the}} sexual transmission of HIV, several factors <b>have</b> <b>limited</b> widespread condom distribution and uptake in Malawi. People living in non-urban areas often have difficulty accessing condoms, and condoms are not typically available at bars {{and other social}} locations where {{they could have a}} significant impact on HIV prevention. Many people oppose condoms because they believe that condoms make sex less enjoyable or because they question their ability to prevent the transmission of HIV. However, despite these factors, many unmarried couples have started using condoms more consistently as concern and fear about the HIV/AIDS epidemic have increased.|$|E
5|$|Carroll was {{the second}} of four sons born to Daniel Carroll of Aghagurty and Littermurna (c. 1642–1688), a Catholic Irishman whose family lost much of their land and wealth in the English Civil War. The exact place of his birth is unclear, though it likely {{occurred}} near {{the small town of}} Aghagurty that Carroll's father took as part of his name. Some of the family property near Aghagurty was obtained by a friend, Richard Grace, who made Daniel Carroll the head tenant. This action gave the family a livelihood, but the family continued to <b>have</b> <b>limited</b> means compared to their former status. It is likely that Charles Carroll was fostered by the wealthier Grace, who had no son; his greater resources could provide for the child's education.|$|E

5|$|Cervical {{cancer is}} {{associated}} with human papillomavirus (HPV), which has also been implicated in cancers of the vulva, vagina, anus, and oropharynx. Almost 300 million women worldwide have been infected with HPV, one of the commoner sexually transmitted infections, and 5% of the 13 million new cases of {{cancer in the world}} have been attributed to HPV. In developed countries, screening for cervical cancer using the Pap test has identified pre-cancerous changes in the cervix, at least in those women with access to health care. Also an HPV vaccine programme is available in 45 countries. Screening and prevention programmes <b>have</b> <b>limited</b> availability in developing countries although inexpensive low technology programmes are being developed, but access to treatment is also limited. If applied globally, HPV vaccination at 70% coverage could save the lives of 4 million women from cervical cancer, since most cases occur in developing countries.|$|E
5|$|Convective rain, or showery precipitation, occurs from {{convective}} clouds (e.g., cumulonimbus or cumulus congestus). It falls as showers with {{rapidly changing}} intensity. Convective precipitation falls over a certain {{area for a}} relatively short time, as convective clouds <b>have</b> <b>limited</b> horizontal extent. Most precipitation in the tropics appears to be convective; however, {{it has been suggested}} that stratiform precipitation also occurs. Graupel and hail indicate convection. In mid-latitudes, convective precipitation is intermittent and often associated with baroclinic boundaries such as cold fronts, squall lines, and warm fronts.|$|E
5|$|Dredd earned $27.6 {{million from}} markets outside of North America and $13.4 million from North America, {{for a total}} of $41 million. In the UK, Dredd grossed £1.05 million ($1.7 million) from 415 cinemas during its opening weekend. This made it the weekend's number-one film, the first film {{restricted}} to audiences over 18 years of age to do so since Saw 3D in 2010. In its second weekend, the film placed number five, earning £769,381. Dredd was primarily shown in 3D in the UK, and 2D screenings were notoriously limited as the distributor denied cinemas' requests for 2D prints; the decision was considered to <b>have</b> <b>limited</b> the film's audience where 2D was their preferred format.

5|$|Matthew Cobley et al. (2013) dispute this, {{finding that}} large muscles and {{cartilage}} would <b>have</b> <b>limited</b> {{movement of the}} neck. They state the feeding ranges for sauropods like Diplodocus were smaller than previously believed, and the animals may have had to move their whole bodies around to better access areas where they could browse vegetation. As such, they might have spent more time foraging to meet their minimum energy needs. The conclusions of Cobley etal. are disputed by Taylor, who analyzed the amount and positioning of intervertebral cartilage to determine {{the flexibility of the}} neck of Apatosaurus and Diplodocus. He found that the neck of Apatosaurus was very flexible.|$|E
