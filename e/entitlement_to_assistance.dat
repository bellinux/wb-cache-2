40|$|Using {{a feminist}} {{political}} economy lens, this paper explores the balancing {{of work and}} family by parents on social assistance in British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan. In all three provinces, restructuring of policy has made parents' <b>entitlement</b> <b>to</b> <b>assistance</b> increasingly contingent on their employability efforts (e. g. mandatory job searches, participation in welfare-to-work programs). This entitlement relationship is implicated by simultaneous and contradictory processes embedded in neo-liberal restructuring - gendering and familization - that problematically affect parents' ability to balance their actual or potential employability expectations with family caregiving demands. Drawing on qualitative data from 46 interviews, this paper reveals the strategies that parents then utilize to manage these competing demands {{so that they can}} maintain their family's survival- or ";stay afloat"; - while living on social assistance. In terms of thematic areas, these intricately inter-related coping strategies include: learn the system; play the system; social support; pawning. The significance of these findings for feminist challenges of neo-liberalism and for meeting social justice goals (i. e. economic security; equality) is discussed...|$|E

Interested in assessing how welfare reforms enacted in 1997 changed the experiences of poor families, Levine interviewed 95 mothers recruited through job-training programs associated with local welfare agencies, speaking with 26 mothers in 1994 – 1995, before the new rules were adopted, and another 69 women in 2004 – 2005, approximately seven years after the new program started.

40|$|Defense date: 25 / 01 / 2008 Examining Board: Prof. Laurence Fontaine (EUI and EHESS) – {{supervisor}} Dr. Antti Häkkinen (University of Helsinki) Prof. Arfon Rees (EUI) Prof. Jane Humphries (Oxford University) The study concerns informal assistance between households {{as a form}} {{of social}} security in early 20 th century Finland. Its sources consist of oral histories, tax, demographic and welfare records and household budgets. According to the study, the popular ideology related to informal assistance excluded outsiders, idealized shared poverty, relied on familiarity and reciprocity, and appealed to material imperative. It turned necessity into a virtue. In different historical situations, <b>entitlement</b> <b>to</b> <b>assistance</b> was attached to changing political and social circumstances, which made access uncertain, difficult, and at times, humiliating for the beneficiaries. The donors used their position to construct and reinforce their own social identities. In quantitative terms, informal assistance was relatively scarce and took various forms which followed logics that broadly resembled social security, but had significant differences. Actual gifts and assistance were more important for chronically low-income workers, whereas informal loans were related to temporary fluctuations in income, and more accessible to richer workers. Assistance in kind targeted households with many small children. In the male-dominated households of the data, informal assistance in cash was apparently controlled by men, whereas the 'informal child allowance' represented by assistance in kind was controlled by women. On the short run, recourse to informal assistance was a more significant survival strategy than adding labour to the market or taking in tenants. Statistically, the combined effect of gifts, loans and savings allowed the worker families of Helsinki participating in the cost-of-living study of 1928 to compensate approximately 36 % of intra-year income fluctuations. However, these methods offered weaker security for low-income workers than for higher-income workers. Recourse to private savings offered better protection to high-income workers than did the better chance of receiving assistance to low-income workers. The statistical compensation for the latter group was only 30 % of equally dramatic income fluctuations, greater need notwithstanding...|$|E
40|$|Over {{forty years}} ago, the Supreme Court in Kelly v. Goldberg held that due process protections applied to statutorily {{provided}} welfare benefits. Since then, {{the welfare system}} has undergone massive changes, and has been transformed from a cash assistance program to a work-based temporary one, with participants required to work in exchange for benefits. One of the few vestiges of the old system preserved in the new is the requirement that participants be given an opportunity for an administrative fair hearing when benefits are reduced or denied. Although {{virtually all of the}} states have retained their pre-welfare reform fair hearing systems, we know little about whether, or how, these systems have adapted to the new demands wrought by welfare reform, including how useful such hearings are under a regime that emphasizes the denial of, rather than an <b>entitlement</b> <b>to,</b> <b>assistance.</b> This article reports on the first empirical study of fair hearings using a method of social science analyses called focused ethnography. The findings reveal that the current system works unevenly. Some administrative law judges act as “super bureaucrats” adopting the normative practices of the welfare system, including its focus on procedural compliance over substantive need, while other judges fully employ the tools of the adversarial system to decide disputes, thus acting as a check on agency error. However, even their efforts fall short in scrutinizing potential deficiencies in administrative systems and decision-making processes regarding the work rules and sanctions. A restructuring of the fair hearing system is required to enhance the efficacy of hearings post welfare reform, and to better serve its intended users. Specifically the present adversarial model should be replaced with the inquisitorial model, thus granting ALJs wider powers to define and investigate disputes. Additionally, the role of the agency representative should be redefined from agency advocate to a “friend of the court” responsible for seeking out opposing evidence and legal arguments. The proposed changes would allow for a fuller and fairer vetting of the types of disputes generated by a work based welfare system, and the administrative practices underlying them. It would also harness the skills, resources and knowledge of government officials in ways that would remedy appellants’ deficiencies in these areas...|$|E

40|$|In November 1996, the Chief Executive Officer {{group was}} {{requested}} by the Department of Health to consider the issue of domiciliary births. The background to this request was as follows: Although {{the policy of the}} Department is that births should take place in consultant-staffed maternity units, a small number of mothers insist on having a home birth. There is a statutory <b>entitlement</b> <b>to</b> <b>assistance</b> from the health board, but it is difficult in practice to meet this requirement and in most cases health boards are now providing an ex-gratia contribution towards the cost of hiring a private mid-wife; The Review Group on the Maternity and Infant Care Scheme (whose report is likely to be published shortly in conjunction with the Women's Health Plan) gives a strong endorsement to the policy on the preferred location of births, but recognises that arrangements must be made to cater for those who insist on a home birth. The Review Group recommends that each health board should put in place a hospital out-reach service to that end. However, when the Department consulted with health board on this, some felt the approach was feasible but others saw major difficulties. Consequently, it is intended that, in launching the Women's Health Plan, the Minister will say that the hospital-outreach approach is a possible solution but that an initial assessment indicates practical problems; that the designation of certain public health nurses and/or contracted private midwives, with the involvement of general practitioners and with regular refresher training, is another possible approach; and that each approach is to be piloted in a health board to establish feasibility and comparative effectiveness, or whether different approaches may be required in different geographic/demographic circumstances; The Ombudsman has recently taken an interest in this area. He stresses that the statutory duty must be implemented, but, in view of the practical problems and the proposed pilot schemes, he is prepared to accept the current ex-gratia approach (provided it is implemented consistently in all boards) as an interim solution.

40|$|On August 22, 1996, President Bill Clinton {{signed into}} law the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (hereinafter, “PRWORA” or the “welfare reform law”), which {{replaced}} the Aid to Families and Dependent Children Program (“AFDC”), the nation’s primary cash-assistance program, with the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families Program (“TANF”), funded by block grants to states. PRWORA represented {{a dramatic change in}} social welfare policy in the United States. Among the many changes effected by the law in the nation’s social welfare programs were: (1) the increased authority of the states over cash-assistance programs for needy families, giving states flexibility in designing programs within the block grant scheme and significantly reducing federal oversight; (2) the establishment of work requirements for recipients of assistance who are able to work, to be enforced through work participation rate requirements in the states; (3) the establishment of a five year time limit on the receipt of federally funded assistance; and (4) the generation of about $ 54 billion in social welfare program savings, largely by reducing food stamp expenditures and benefits to immigrants. One of the most significant changes resulting from the welfare reform law is that welfare is no longer a federally guaranteed entitlement on which a family can rely to support needy children. PRWORA eliminated any <b>entitlement</b> <b>to</b> <b>assistance</b> by recipients, as well as the federal guarantee of matching assistance to states. In 1995, just one year prior to enactment of PRWORA, more than 14 million children were classified as poor in the United States. Although the federal welfare reform law ostensibly sought {{to reduce the number of}} children living in impoverished single-parent families, child well-being received little direct attention during the pre-enactment debates. The goal of the reform was to increase self-sufficiency by promoting marriage and requiring mothers to move from welfare to work. A number of scholars and commentators cautioned, that as a result of the reform of the nation’s social welfare system, the numbers of poor children would swell. What would become of the children of poor families without the safety net of federal public assistance? As Congress considers the reauthorization of the welfare reform law, critical reexamination of the goals of the law, its interconnection with the existing child welfare structure, and the impact of this intersection on the development and well being of children are crucial. Did the law accomplish its stated goals? What has been the effect of the law on children from low-income families? How might welfare programs be structured to work more effectively with the child welfare system? How can the interplay of welfare reform and child protection services be structured to enhance prevention over protection?

TANF {{emphasizes the importance of}} work and personal responsibility rather than dependence on government benefits. To avoid financial penalties, states must demonstrate yearly that an ever-increasing proportion of adults receiving TANF are working or engaged in work-related activities. The U. S. Census Bureau's Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) for 1999 show that 44 percent of TANF recipients nationwide had physical or mental impairments, a proportion almost three times as high as among adults in the non-TANF population. The percentages of TANF adults with impairments from 1994 can not be compared to later years because Census broadened its measurements of mental impairments starting with its 1997 SIPP data. Most of the counties that screen for impairments rely on recipients' self-disclosure, which may not ensure the identification of some impairments that could interfere with employment. Still, for the one-third of counties that reported service data, fewer than half of recipients with impairments were receiving services to move them toward employment.

This both helped meet a crucial need of low-income families and improved the program’s political appeal. It also demonstrated that the goals of promoting work, devolving authority to states, and safeguarding program integrity can be achieved in positive ways. The new Food Stamp Program promotes work through incentives more than sanctions. Its incentive structure changed to encourage states to improve access for low-wage workers, and states received flexibility to make those kinds of innovations rather than ones that would destabilize the program’s national benefit structure. Additionally, enforcement efforts deemphasized minor accounting issues having little bearing on the program’s integrity.

During his inaugural speech in the French National Assembly, he claimed he knew the names of politicians from the right-wing opposition implicated in corruption scandals, causing a great hue and cry. Bérégovoy forced Bernard Tapie, his Minister of Urban Affairs, to resign in May 1992 after his indictment by the French justice. He thus created the misnamed [...] "Balladur jurisprudence". In social policy, a number of reforms were carried out. In November 1992 a law was passed that inserted a (arguably narrow) definition of sexual harassment into the labour code and empowered the labour inspectorate and workplace committees to enforce it. In May 1992, increased aid was provided to farmers, mainly comprising reductions in the agricultural land tax and increased grants for young farmers. In June 1992, the French parliament passed a bill which required mayors to encourage social mixing in public housing. A law of 12 July 1992 was aimed at enhancing both the status of child-minders and [...] "the quality of day care for children in a family environment," [...] and a law of 29 July 1992 improved <b>entitlement</b> <b>to</b> medical <b>assistance.</b> The Sapin law of January 1993 sought to prevent corruption and encourage transparency [...] "in economic activities and public procedures," [...] and a law of January 1993 established [...] "the principle of joint parental authority in the legitimate family, even if a divorce occurs." [...] In addition, the coverage of housing benefits was extended in 1993.|$|R
