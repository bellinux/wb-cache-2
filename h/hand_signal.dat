5|$|The University of Houston and the University of Texas {{played their}} first {{football}} game {{against one another}} in 1953. Since this was their first meeting, members of Alpha Phi Omega—the service fraternity in charge {{of taking care of}} ShastaI, the university's mascot—brought her to the game. During the trip, Shasta's front paw was caught in the cage door and one toe was cut off. At the game, several Longhorn players saw what had happened and began taunting UH players by holding up their hands with the ring finger bent, suggesting the Cougars were invalids. Texas went on to win this game 28–7. UH students had been using the victory sign as a <b>hand</b> <b>signal</b> up to that time, but began using the bent-finger sign as a reminder that they would remember the taunts.|$|E
5|$|Tired of his high-priced {{imported}} livestock {{losing in}} local shows, Glure concocts a dog {{show with a}} special gold cup event that is limited to collies that are both American Kennel Club blue ribbon winners and capable of completing the tasks of a British working sheep dog trial. Initially, {{it seems like the}} only dog who meets the requirements is Glure's recently purchased blue-merle champion, Lochinvar III; however, the Mistress is able to command Lad through the motions of the trial. Lochinvar works primarily by <b>hand</b> <b>signal,</b> so when Glure accidentally burns his fingers on his cigar while going through the trial, the dog stops working and waits for Glure's hand-shaking to be explained. The dog is disqualified and Lad is declared the winner. The Master and Mistress donate the gold cup to the Red Cross in his name.|$|E
50|$|The Occupy {{movement}} <b>hand</b> <b>signals</b> are a {{group of}} <b>hand</b> <b>signals</b> used by Occupy Wall Street protesters to negotiate a consensus. The signals have been equated with other hand languages used by soldiers, cliques, or even Wall Street traders. <b>Hand</b> <b>signals</b> are used instead of conventional audible signals, like applause, shouts, or booing, {{because they do not}} interrupt the speaker using the human microphone, a system where the front of the crowd repeats the speaker so that the content can be heard {{at the back of the}} crowd. Between sharing of information on Facebook, Twitter, and other news reports, the <b>hand</b> <b>signals</b> have become common at other Occupy movement protest locations. Some protesters go to neighboring groups to assist in teaching the <b>hand</b> <b>signals</b> along with other general cooperation. There are YouTube videos showing the <b>hand</b> <b>signals,</b> though the signals are not universal at all locations.|$|R
25|$|<b>Hand</b> <b>signals</b> are {{generally}} used when visibility allows, {{and there is}} a range of commonly used signals, with some variations. These signals are often also used as an alternative by professional divers. There is also a set of instructional <b>hand</b> <b>signals</b> used during training. Recreational divers are expected to be familiar with the standard set of <b>hand</b> <b>signals</b> used by their certification agency, and these have to a large extent been standardized internationally and are taught on entry level diving courses. A few additional specialised <b>hand</b> <b>signals</b> are commonly used by technical divers.|$|R
50|$|In baseball, the manager, {{with the}} help of his assistants, will dictate {{offensive}} strategy from the dugout by sending <b>hand</b> <b>signals</b> to the first and third base coaches. To avoid detection, the first and third base coaches will then translate those <b>hand</b> <b>signals</b> into their own set of <b>hand</b> <b>signals</b> and then send them on to the batter and runners.|$|R

50|$|Signs of the Time is a 60-minute {{documentary}} {{on the origin of}} <b>hand</b> <b>signals</b> in baseball. There are several myths in regard to how signals were started, and the film addresses some of the mysteries that led to umpires giving hand-signals to call plays in the field, base coaches to relay <b>hand</b> <b>signals</b> to players on the field, and catchers to relay <b>hand</b> <b>signals</b> to pitchers.|$|R
50|$|<b>Hand</b> <b>signaling,</b> {{also known}} as arb or arbing (short for arbitrage), is a system of <b>hand</b> <b>signals</b> used on {{financial}} trading floors to communicate buy and sell information in an open outcry trading environment. The system is used at financial exchanges such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and the American Stock Exchange (AMEX). The AMEX is the only U.S. stock market to permit the transmission of buy and sell orders through <b>hand</b> <b>signals.</b>|$|R

25|$|<b>Hand</b> <b>signals</b> are {{a form of}} sign {{system used}} by divers to {{communicate}} when underwater. <b>Hand</b> <b>signals</b> are useful whenever divers can see each other, and some {{can also be used}} in poor visibility if in close proximity, when the recipient can feel the shape of the signaller's hand and thereby identify the signal being given. At night the signal can be illuminated by the diver's light. <b>Hand</b> <b>signals</b> are the primary method of underwater communication for recreational scuba divers, and are also in general use by professional divers, usually as a secondary method.|$|R

50|$|In some {{countries}} (such {{as in the}} Czech Republic, Canada, and the United States), <b>hand</b> <b>signals</b> are designated not only for cyclists, but for every vehicle {{that does not have}} signal lights or has damaged signal lights. For example, drivers of older cars and mopeds may be required to make <b>hand</b> <b>signals.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Leaders of mounted units use arm and <b>hand</b> <b>signals</b> {{to control}} {{individual}} vehicles and platoon movement. When distances between vehicles increase, flags (wrapped and tied) {{can be used}} {{as an extension of the}} arm to give the signals. From some vehicles (for example, Bradley, M2), the arm and <b>hand</b> <b>signals</b> will be distorted.|$|R

5000|$|As the accents were (and are) {{not shown}} on a Torah scroll, {{it was found}} {{necessary}} to have a person making <b>hand</b> <b>signals</b> to the reader to show the tune, as in the Byzantine system of neumes. This system of cheironomy survives in some communities to the present day, notably in Italy. It is speculated that both the shapes {{and the names of}} some of the accents (e.g. tifcha, literally [...] "hand-breadth") may refer to the <b>hand</b> <b>signals</b> rather than to the syntactical functions or melodies denoted by them. Today in most communities there is no system of <b>hand</b> <b>signals</b> and the reader learns the melody of each reading in advance.|$|R
