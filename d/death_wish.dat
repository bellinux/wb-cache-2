5|$|Both prank and {{intentionally}} deadly exploding cigars {{have been}} featured in numerous works of fiction, spanning many forms of media including literature, film, comics books, cartoons and others. A well-known use of the exploding cigar in literature, for example, appears in Thomas Pynchon's 1973 novel, Gravity's Rainbow. In it, the character Etzel Ölsch symbolically betrays his <b>death</b> <b>wish</b> by eagerly smoking a cigar he knows {{to be of the}} prank explosive variety. Other book examples include Robert Coover's 1977 novel, The Public Burning, where a fictionalized Richard Nixon hands an exploding cigar to Uncle Sam, and Sherburne James' Death's Clenched Fist (1982), in which a Tammany Hall politico of the 1890s is murdered with an exploding cigar.|$|E

The association between functional disability and suicidal behaviour in older adults is less clear. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between functional disability and <b>death</b> <b>wishes</b> in late life. Methods: Data from 11 population studies on depression in persons aged 65 and above were pooled, yielding a total of 15, 890 respondents. Level of functional disability was trichotomised (no, intermediate, high). A person was considered to have <b>death</b> <b>wishes</b> if the <b>death</b> wish/suicidal ideation item of the EURO-D scale was endorsed. Odds ratios for <b>death</b> <b>wishes</b> associated with functional disability were calculated in a multilevel logistic regression model.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Female sexual {{dysfunction}} (FSD) in depression albeit common is strikingly understudied. The condition, if addressed properly, {{can be readily}} cured, {{improving the quality of}} life of the patient. Methods A consecutive sample of drug-naïve married female patients with depression was assessed. Depression was diagnosed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID-I). Depression severity was assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), and {{sexual dysfunction}}, the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI). Results Sexual dysfunction was found in 90 % of the patients in our study. Patients with medical comorbidities showed a significant decrease in the desire subset of the FSFI (Mann-Whitney U= 11. 0, p= 0. 009), however there was no significant association with other subsets. Patients who expressed passive <b>death</b> <b>wishes</b> had higher scores on all indicators of sexual function and a significantly higher score in the orgasm subset of the FSFI (Mann-Whitney U= 11. 0, p= 0. 009). Conclusion The study showed a high prevalence of FSD in depressed females regardless of type and severity of depression. Depression with medical comorbidities was associated with a significant decrease in desire. Patients who expressed passive <b>death</b> <b>wishes</b> showed improved sexual function and significantly better orgasm...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The authors {{studied the}} 1 -month {{frequency}} ofsuicidal feelings among very old people. Method: A population sample (N= 345) ofnondemented 85 -year-olds in Gothenburg, Sweden, were examined by a psychiatrist. Suicidal feelings were rated {{by the system}} of Paykel et al. Mental disorders were diagnosed according to DSM-III-R. Results: Of the mentally healthy subjects (N= 225), 4. 0 % had thought during the last month that life was not worth living, 4. 0 % had had <b>death</b> <b>wishes,</b> and 0. 9 % had thought of taking their own lives. None had seriously considered suicide. The figures were higher among subjects with mental disorders (N= 120) : 29. 2 % had thought that life was not worth living, 27. 5 % had had <b>death</b> <b>wishes,</b> 9. 2 % had thought about taking their lives, and 1. 7 % had seriously considered suicide. Among the subjects with mental disorders, including depression, suicidalfeelings were associated with greater use ofanxiolytics but not ofantidepressants. Women who felt that life was not worth living had a higher 3 -year mortality rate than did women without these feelings (43. 2 % versus 14. 2 %). This finding was independent of concomitant physical and mental disorders. clusions: Mild suicidal feelings are common in elderly subjects with mental disorders but in-frequent in the mentally healthy.

25|$|Scandinavian {{shipbuilding}} technology {{failed to}} advance {{beyond that of}} the Viking days. The traditional Viking ships performed quite well in the relatively tranquil summer seas of the medieval warm period, but the stormier climates rendered these vessels particularly dangerous {{to the point of}} obsolescence.

25|$|In {{the early}} years of film, New York City was {{characterized}} as urbane and sophisticated.

With the city's renaissance in the 1980s and 1990s came new portrayals on television; Friends, Seinfeld, and Sex and the City showed life in the city to be glamorous and interesting. Nonetheless a disproportionate number of crime dramas, such as Law & Order, continue to make criminality in the city as their subject even as New York has become the safest large city in the United States in the last two decades.|$|E

40|$|The {{idea of a}} {{progression}} in suicide phenomena, from <b>death</b> <b>wishes</b> to suicide attempts and completed suicides, is quite old and widely present in literature. This model of interpreting suicidality has great relevance in preventative approaches, since it gives the opportunity of intercepting suicidal trajectories at several different stages. However, {{this may not be}} the case for many situations, and the hypothesis of a continuum can be true only in a limited number of cases, probably embedded with a specific psychopathological scenario (e. g. depression) and with a frequency that should not permit generalisations.
