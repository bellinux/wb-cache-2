She told Talk magazine:Every day I encounter some sort of anti-American feeling. Over the summer, I thought I would seek out non-Americans as friends, just for diversity's sake. Now <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{want to be around}} Americans – people who I know are thinking about our country as much as I am.|$|E
2500|$|Campbell {{declined}} {{a number}} of positions in the CSA government, but accepted the post of Assistant Secretary of War in 1862. For {{the duration of the}} job, Campbell was criticized for trying to limit the scope of wartime conscription. [...] By late 1864, he was pushing again {{for an end to the}} war. In an 1865 letter to Judge Benjamin R. Curtis, he described the disastrous state of the Confederacy and marveled: [...] "You would suppose there could be no difficulty in convincing men under such circumstances that peace was required. But when I look back upon the events of the winter, <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was incessantly employed in making these facts known and to no result." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{realize that}} I shouldn't be {{surprised}} at God's doing things that I can't explain. [...] I shouldn't doubt His existence just because <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> sometimes can't understand why or how He has made something. [...] I know that my nature is weak and limited and that God's is limitless, incomprehensible, and infinite, and, from this, I can infer that He can do innumerable things whose reasons are unknown to me. [...] On this ground alone, I regard the common practice of explaining things {{in terms of their}} purposes to be useless in physics: it would be foolhardy of me to think that I can discover God's purposes.

2500|$|TUESDAY.—"Letter from {{solicitor}} informing me that I {{have come}} into £1,000,000 through the will of an Australian gold-digger named Tomkins. On referring to my diary <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> saved his life two years ago by plunging into the Serpentine. This is very gratifying. Was late at the office as I had to look in at the Palace on the way, {{in order to get}} knighted, but managed to get a good deal of work done before I was interrupted by a madman with a razor, who demanded £100. Shot him after a desperate struggle. Tea at an ABC, where I met the Duke of —-. Fell into the Thames on my way home, but swam ashore without difficulty." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am [...] "intermediate" [...] between God and nothingness, {{between the}} supreme entity and nonentity. Insofar as I am the {{creation}} of the supreme entity, there's nothing in me to account for my being deceived or led into error, but, inasmuch as I somehow participate in nothing or nonentity — that is, insofar as I am distinct from the supreme entity itself and lack many things — it's not surprising that I go wrong. I thus understand that, in itself, error is a lack, rather than a real thing dependent on God. Hence, I understand that I can err without God's having given me a special ability to do so. Rather, I fall into error because my God-given ability to judge the truth is not infinite. [...] (Descartes, Meditation IV: On Truth and Falsity).|$|E
2500|$|The {{summer of}} the year 1783 was an amazing and portentous one, and full of horrible phaenomena; for besides the {{alarming}} meteors and tremendous thunder-storms that affrighted and distressed the different counties of this kingdom, the peculiar haze, or smokey fog, that prevailed for many weeks in this island, and {{in every part of}} Europe, and even beyond its limits, was a most extraordinary appearance, unlike anything known within the memory of man. By my journal <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had noticed this strange occurrence from June 23 to July 20 inclusive, during which period the wind varied to every quarter without making any alteration in the air. The sun, at noon, looked as blank as a clouded moon, and shed a rust-coloured ferruginous light on the ground, and floors of rooms; but was particularly lurid and blood-coloured at rising and setting. All the time the heat was so intense that butchers' meat could hardly be eaten on the day after it was killed; and the flies swarmed so in the lanes and hedges that they rendered the horses half frantic, and riding irksome. The country people began to look, with a superstitious awe, at the red, louring aspect of the sun; ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I haven't time to {{talk about}} it now; besides I don't want to, for fear <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am mistaken. But get on your hat, my dear fellow, and let's go over to the town for men." ...|$|R

"While fortune oppressed me with celibate misery at Hoppet Hall, nobody {{hated me}} for not hunting;--and as I could not very well afford it, I was not {{considered}} to be entering a protest against the amusement.
