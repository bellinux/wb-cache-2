In the case (a) the longer tails of the power decay of the Student laws, and in the case (b) the discontinuities of the Levy–Student process can well account for the rare <b>escape</b> <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> from the beam core, and hence for the formation of a halo in intense beams...|$|E
40|$|The open stadium billiard has a {{survival}} probability, P (t), {{that depends on}} the rate of <b>escape</b> <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> through the leak.

For certain ω values P (t) is purely exponential while for other values the power law behaviour at long times persists. We identify three ranges of ω values corresponding to three different responses of P (t). It is shown that these variations in P (t) are due to the interaction of the moving leak with Marginally Unstable Periodic Orbits (MUPOs) ...|$|E

40|$|A wind nebula, {{generating}} extended X-ray emission, {{was recently}} detected surrounding Swift J 1834. 9 - 0846. This {{is the first}} magnetar for which such a wind nebula was found. Here, we investigate {{whether there is a}} plausible scenario where the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) can be sustained without the need of advocating for additional sources of energy other than rotational. We do this by using a detailed radiative and dynamical code that studies the evolution of the nebula and its particle population in time. We find that such a scenario indeed exists: Swift J 1834. 9 - 0846 's nebula can be explained as being rotationally-powered, as all other known PWNe are, if it is currently being compressed by the environment. The latter introduces several effects, the most important of which is the appearance of adiabatic heating, being increasingly dominant over the <b>escape</b> <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> as reverberation goes by. The need of reverberation naturally explains why this is the only magnetar nebula detected, and provides estimates for Swift 1834. 9 - 0846 's age. Comment: In press in ApJ.

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{kinetics}} of sublimating crystals with single-particle resolution by experiments with colloidal spheres and by computer simulations. A short-range attraction between spheres led to crystallites {{one to three}} layers thick. The spheres were tracked with optical microscopy while the attraction was reduced and the crystals sublimated. Large crystallites sublimated by <b>escape</b> <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> from the perimeter. The rate of shrinkage was greatly enhanced, however, when the size decreased to less than 20 to 50 particles, depending on the location in the phase diagram. At this size, the crystallites transformed into a dense amorphous structure, which rapidly vaporized. The enhancement of kinetics by metastable or unstable phases may {{play a major role}} in the melting, freezing, and annealing of crystals. The process by which crystals melt into aliquid or sublimate into a gas are of con-siderable fundamental and practical impor-tance.

40|$|We {{propose a}} new way of quick and very {{efficient}} acceleration of protons and/or electrons in relativistic bulk flows. The new mechanism takes advantage of conversion of particles from the charged state (protons or electrons/positrons) into neutral state (neutrons or photons) and back. In most cases, the conversion is photon-induced and requires presence of intense radiation fields, but the converter acceleration mechanism may also operate via inelastic nucleon-nucleon collisions. Like in the traditional model [...] "stochastic" (or diffusive) acceleration, [...] the acceleration cycle in our scenario consists of <b>escape</b> <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> from the relativistic flow followed by their return back after deflection from the ambient magnetic field. The difference is that the charge-changing reactions, which occur during the cycle, allow accelerated particles to increase their energies in each cycle by a factor roughly equal to the bulk Lorentz factor squared. The emerging spectra of accelerated particles can be very hard and their cut-off energy in some cases is larger than in the standard mechanism. This drastically reduces the required energy budget of the sources of the highest-energy particles observed in cosmic rays. Also, the proposed acceleration mechanism may serve as an efficient means of transferring the energy of bulk motion to gamma-radiation and, if the accelerated particles are nucleons, routinely produces high-energy neutrinos at ∼ 50...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{temporal}} aspects of quantum tunneling as manifested in time-of-arrival experiments {{in which the}} detected particle tunnels through a potential barrier. In particular, we present a general method for constructing temporal probabilities in tunneling systems that (i) defines `classical' time observables for quantum systems and (ii) applies to relativistic particles interacting through quantum fields. We show that the relevant probabilities are {{defined in terms of}} specific correlations functions of the quantum field associated with tunneling particles. We construct a probability distribution with respect to the time of particle detection that contains all information about the temporal aspects of the tunneling process. In specific cases, this probability distribution leads to the definition of a delay time that, for parity-symmetric potentials, reduces to the phase time of Bohm and Wigner. We apply our results to piecewise constant potentials, by deriving the appropriate junction conditions on the points of discontinuity. For the double square potential, in particular, we demonstrate the existence of (at least) two physically relevant time parameters, the delay time and a decay rate that describes the <b>escape</b> <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> trapped in the inter-barrier region. Finally, we propose a resolution to the paradox of apparent superluminal velocities for tunneling particles.

40|$|Models used {{to predict}} {{digestibility}} and fill of the dietary insoluble fibre (NDF) treat the ruminoreticular particulate mass as a single pool. The underlying assumption is that <b>escape</b> <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> follows first-order kinetics. In this paper, we proposed and evaluated a model of two ruminoreticular sequential NDF pools. The first pool is formed by buoyant particles (raft pool) and the second one by fluid dispersed particles (escapable pool) ventrally to the raft. The transference of particles between these two pools results from several processes that reduce particles buoyancy, assuming the gamma distribution. The exit of escapable pool particles from the ruminoreticulum is exponentially distributed. These concepts were evaluated by comparing ruminoreticular NDF masses as 43 and 27 means from cattle and sheep, respectively, to the same predicted variable using single- and two-pools models. Predictions of the single-pool model were based on lignin turnover and the turnover associated to the descending phase of the elimination of Yb-labelled forage particles in the faeces of sheep. Predictions of the two-pool model were obtained by estimating fractional passage rates associated to the ascending and descending phases of the same Yb excretion profiles in sheep faeces. All turnovers were scaled to the power 0. 25 of body mass for interspecies comparisons. Predictions based on lignin turnover (single pool) and the two-pool model presented similar trends, accuracies and precisions.
