5|$|The aim of Calvin's {{political}} theory was {{to safeguard the}} rights and freedoms of ordinary people. Although {{he was convinced that}} the Bible contained no blueprint for a certain form of government, Calvin favored a combination of democracy and aristocracy (mixed government). He appreciated the advantages of democracy. To further minimize the misuse of political power, Calvin proposed to divide it among several political institutions like the aristocracy, lower estates, or magistrates in a system of checks and balances (separation of powers). Finally, Calvin taught that if rulers rise up against God they lose their divine right and must be deposed. State and church are separate, though they have to cooperate to the benefit of the people. Christian magistrates <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that the church can fulfill its duties in freedom. In extreme cases the magistrates have to expel or execute dangerous heretics. But nobody can be forced to become a Protestant.|$|E
25|$|We have {{to adjust}} the AMT. That has to be reduced. We {{have to get rid}} of the death tax, which is going to go to zero in 2010, which is going to create an {{incentive}} – I can't imagine what kind of an incentive it's going to create. It's going to go to zero in 2010. And then in 2011, it's going to go to 55 percent. And we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that the tax cuts that went into effect, that that level remains. Otherwise, we're going to have one of the biggest tax increases in history in 2011. And I would look to try to regularize the rates and look for some marginal reduction, even beyond what we're doing right now.|$|E

[...] "We <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that we open up these avenues so that our best and our brightest can go find these cures that they believe they will find," [...] he said. In support of this he endorsed Proposition 71, a California ballot initiative intended to provide state government funding for stem-cell research.|$|E

500|$|In 2009, the SRVUSD was {{affected}} by a major statewide school budget crisis. 236 layoff notices were sent to teachers within the district, {{more than half of}} whom worked at Dougherty. All permanent teachers were rehired {{with the help of a}} $144 per-parcel tax measure passed in May 2009, expected to raise $6.7 million yearly. During the 2009 flu pandemic in the United States, one tenth grade student at Dougherty was known to have been infected with the Influenza A/H1N1 virus; however, closure of the school did not occur, as it was found to be unnecessary and inconvenient. According to Principal Hibbard, [...] "We just <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> we educate parents", and the school administration reacted to the outbreak by sending out an email to parents with advice from the Center for Disease Control.|$|E
500|$|Eisenberg has obsessive–compulsive {{disorder}} and is open about it. He {{said of his}} condition: [...] "I touch the tips of my fingers in a weird way; I don't step on cracks; if I'm going onto a new surface – be it carpet to concrete, or concrete to wood, or wood to concrete, any new surface – I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> all parts of my feet touch the ground equally before I touch that new thing. So I'll often hesitate before walking into a new room." [...] He has also spoken about going to therapy to manage his anxieties – OCD, separation anxiety, social anxiety – and depression, the latter of which he struggled with a lot when he was younger, {{as well as how}} acting helped him better cope. He has said that acting serves as his coping mechanism.|$|E
500|$|According to Schneider, Jonathan is [...] "perfectly {{willing to}} go to jail, or worse, to protect his son". The actor characterizes Jonathan as fast to lose his temper, which Schneider views as being a {{development}} of his protective nature over his family. Schneider believes that the season two episode [...] "Suspect"—where Jonathan is arrested, but his sole concern is protecting Clark's secret—summarizes the character well, and shows that the [...] "least important person in Jonathan's life is Jonathan". Schneider admits that occasionally he and Annette O'Toole have to [...] "police" [...] the creative team {{when it comes to the}} relationship between Martha, Jonathan, and Clark. According to Schneider, there are moments where they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that the characters are not taken to a place they would not normally go, specifically where the parents are useless without the [...] "innate intelligence of [...] teenager".|$|E

500|$|The {{music of}} the game was {{composed}} by Inon Zur, whose previous works included [...] and Fallout Tactics. Inon Zur worked with Jeremy Soule, the composer for Icewind Dale, to maintain {{the tone of the}} music. Inon Zur also worked closely with Interplay audio director Adam Levenson while composing the music; Zur and Levenson had worked together on several previous titles. Inon Zur said that while composing the theme for the game, [...] "I wrote and rewrote the main theme several times", and [...] "we tried to create a piece that would preserve the sound of the first Icewind Dalewe made great efforts to convey the new elements also. Capturing all of this in 30-45 seconds was not easy however I believe that we eventually found the right path for this game's soundtrack." [...] Zur described the composing process, [...] "After learning the storyboard and getting additional insight from the producers/music supervisor I'll start to compose. The thematic idea (main melody or rhythmical groove) comes first. Then comes the accompaniment followed by the orchestration," [...] and that, [...] "each piece should have its own unique flavour so every step is carefully examined. I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that the main idea of the piece is reflected in all these steps." [...] He called the composing experience [...] "very pleasant and rewarding." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} make a {{faithful}} rendition of the circus, director Kramer asked the animators to watch a showing of Cirque du Soleil in Santa Monica, but they declined the offer. Regardless, executive producer and former showrunner Mike Scully found that the animators did an [...] "amazing" [...] job animating the setpiece. Because the episode takes place in winter, the animators faced some challenges that they would not have with any other episode. [...] "It just adds another element", Kramer said about episodes taking place in winter, [...] "People's clothes have to get tugged in the wind if it's windy. And you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> the snow is consistent because [...] It's like a character. If it's a big snowflake in one scene and then tiny ones where it's snowing too hard in the next scene... It's not gonna work." [...] The scratches and bad quality of [...] "The Christmas That Almost Wasn't, But Then Was" [...] were added in by the Post-Production Department, led by Alex Duke. [...] "Our Post-Production Department never gets enough credit," [...] Scully said, [...] "But they'll take a film like [...] and make it all scratchy and make it look really old. They always do a great job." [...] The woman in [...] "The Christmas That Almost Wasn't, But Then Was" [...] was portrayed by Tress MacNeille, while the clown in the Cirque du Purée was voiced by Hank Azaria. The song that plays when Homer and Ned are driving to the school is [...] "Feel Like Makin' Love" [...] by English rock band Bad Company.

2500|$|While the Charter {{has enjoyed}} {{a great deal of}} popularity, with 82% of Canadians {{describing}} it as a good thing in opinion polls in 1987 and 1999, the document has also been subject to published criticisms {{from both sides of the}} political spectrum. One left-wing critic is Professor Michael Mandel, who wrote that in comparison to politicians, judges do not have to be as sensitive to the will of the electorate, nor do they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> their decisions are easily understandable to the average Canadian citizen. This, in Mandel's view, limits democracy. Mandel has also asserted that the Charter makes Canada more like the United States, especially by serving corporate rights and individual rights rather than group rights and social rights. He has argued that there are several things that should be included in the Charter, such as a right to health care and a basic right to free education. Hence, the perceived Americanization of Canadian politics is seen as coming at the expense of values more important for Canadians. The union movement has been disappointed in the reluctance of the courts to use the Charter to support various forms of union activity, such as the [...] "right to strike".|$|E
