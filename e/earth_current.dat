The investigation on {{root cause of}} the trouble is still under studied. After replacement of the inter bus power transformer, the existing IBT transformer still show some abnormalities on the neutral <b>earthing</b> <b>current.</b> Neutral <b>earthing</b> <b>current</b> found relatively higher than other IBT transformer even though the load level only minimal. Within this paper, measurement and simulation and analysis will be done to verify the cause of abnormality neutral <b>earthing</b> <b>current</b> on this Ynyd configured IBT 500 / 150 kV power transformer. The measurement on neutral <b>earthing</b> <b>current</b> were conducted by true rms current logging for one week on three area of similar configuration of EHV main substation including the Tasikmalaya EHV main substation to compare with other normal conditions. Measurement with true rms current meter, will investigate the effectiveness of delta tertiary winding for reducing zero sequence current on IBT transformer and also if there is dc component on neutral current due to geomagnetic field interference. Analysis and simulation was also conducted to verify the measurement result.

5000|$|Types II to IV are {{variants}} which {{attempt to}} overcome the main limitation of Type I, which is the reference to Earth {{at each end of}} the circuit.

This improves noise immunity as the Signal Ground does not carry the same heavy currents as normal Ground connections and provides a low resistance return path for signaling. However, if the main Ground connection fails all <b>Earth</b> <b>current</b> may flow via the interface, causing signaling failure, hum and in extreme cases destruction of equipment.|$|E

50|$|A {{study from}} the Journal of Cosmology by Dr. Nick Kanas states that “Unprecedented factors will affect such a mission. A Mars crew will be tens of {{millions}} of miles away from home, engaged in a mission that will last around  2 1⁄2years. Crew members sic will experience a severe sense of isolation and separation from the Earth, which will appear as a receding bluish-green dot in the heavens. From the surface of Mars, there will be 2-way communication delays with the Earth of up to 44 minutes, depending on where the two planets are located in their respective orbits, and the crew will be relatively autonomous from mission control.” Due to the communication delays, new protocols need to be developed in order to assess crew members' psychological health. Researchers have developed a Martian simulation called HI-SEAS (Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation) that places scientists in a simulated Martian laboratory to study the psychological effects of isolation, repetitive tasks, and living in close-quarters with other scientists for up to a year at a time. Computer programs are being developed to assist crews with personal and interpersonal issues in absence of direct communication with professionals on <b>earth.</b> <b>Current</b> suggestions for Mars exploration and colonization are to select individuals who have passed psychological screenings.
