40|$|The solid agar overlay {{procedure}} {{used for}} viral plaquing was {{adapted to the}} study of Pseudomonas aeruginosa plaques in HeLa monolayers. After adsorption of the organism to the HeLa monolayers, an overlay consisting of 10 % newborn <b>calf</b> <b>serum</b> (NBCS), 90 % Eagles basal medium (EBM), and 1. 5 % agar containing neutral red was added. Plaques developed after 24 hr of incubation at 37 C which were indistinguishable from viral lesions. Optimal conditions for plaques included: serum in the adsorption fluid as well as the overlay medium; 1 -hr adsorption time; healthy HeLa monolayers; and the presence of EBM. The formation of plaques instead of colonies in agar was due to the inhibitory effect of NBCS or EBM. By omitting both of these components from the overlay, colonies appeared in place of plaques. Adult bovine serum acted in a similar bacterial colony-suppressing fashion, but <b>fetal</b> or agamma <b>calf</b> <b>serum</b> did not. Furthermore, NBCS or adult bovine serum when incorporated in the overlay medium instead of <b>fetal</b> or agamma <b>calf</b> <b>serum</b> displayed a plaque-suppressing effect by reducing the number and size of plaques formed.

We ascertained in vitro alpha-TOS effects on {{pancreatic}} cancer (PC) and normal cell growth and verified whether the combination of nontoxic alpha-TOS and 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU) doses causes cancer cell death and whether alpha-TOS effects are mediated by the proapoptotic proteins Bax/Bak and/or SMAD 4 /DPC 4 status. Methods: Five PC cell lines, myoblasts, normal monocytes, wild-type (WT) and Bax/Bak double knockout mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells, and permanently SMAD 4 /DPC 4 -transfected PSN 1 cells were cultured in 1 % and 10 % <b>fetal</b> <b>calf</b> <b>serums</b> (FCSs), without or with alpha-TOS (5 - 500 mu mol/L). Nontoxic 5 -FU (0. 0001 mmol/L) and alpha-TOS alone or in combination were also evaluated. Results: Only PSN 1 PC cell line, which had SMAD 4 /DPC 4 homozygous deletion, was sensitive to nontoxic alpha-TOS doses (5 mu mol/L in 1 % FCS and 50 mu mol/L in 10 % FCS). A 20 -mu mol/L alpha-TOS inhibited MEF-WT, not MEF-double knockout growth. Only PSN 1 cells were sensitive to nontoxic 5 -FU and alpha-TOS combination. SMAD 4 /DPC 4 transfection restored PSN 1 resistance to the effects of combined 5 -FU and alpha-TOS effects. Conclusions: Only a minority of PC cells are sensitive to the anti-proliferative effects of alpha-TOS, any sensitivity appearing to be correlated with SMAD 4 /DPC 4 homozygous deletion and Bax/Bak expression...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the cytotoxicity of the methanol extract of sagebrush plain on human breast cancer MCF 7 cells. Methods: In the present experimental study, the toxic effects of methanol extracts of flowers, leaves, stems and roots of sagebrush plain from of Khorassan and Esfahan province were tested on human breast cancer cells MCF- 7 and normal cells HEK 293. Plant samples were extracted by methanol and their toxic effects on normal and breast cancer cells at concentrations of 5. 62, 125, 250 and 500 µg/ml was determined by MTT. Both breast cancer cells MCF- 7 and normal HEK 293 cells were cultured in RPMI- 1640 medium and DMEM containing 10 % <b>fetal</b> <b>calf</b> <b>serums</b> were cultured. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA. Results: The methanol extract of sagebrush showed toxicity on MCF 7 cells. The extract of Khorasan showed higher toxicity than Esfahan province. IC 50 of sagebrush plant for all parts of the plant were obtained more than 500 µg/ml, but the IC 50 of sagebrush plant of Khorasan region in leaf and flower were 205 ± 1. 3 and 213 ± 5. 3 µg respectively. The leaves and flowers in both cases had the highest cytotoxicity. Plant extracts in both regions did not show significant cytotoxicity on normal HEK 293 cells.

50|$|DXV {{was named}} after Drosophila melanogaster, where it was first {{isolated}}. DXV was first isolated and named in 1978. DXV was discovered as a contaminant in adult D. melanogaster while studying rhabdoviruses. Assay results of DXV showed that DXV induces sensitivity to both carbon dioxide and NH2, which suggests general anoxia. Therefore, the pathogenic pathway for DXV leads to anoxia sensitivity and death of D. melanogaster. By negative contrast electron microscopy the DXV components were first visualized. The origin of DXV is unknown and unclear. It was thought that DXV could have been pre-existent in Drosophila broods in a non-pathogenic form. Additionally, it was speculated that DXV might have originated as a contaminant from <b>fetal</b> <b>calf</b> <b>serum</b> in infection type studies because it was documented that endogenous bovine viruses were already in <b>fetal</b> <b>calf</b> <b>serum.</b>|$|E

Embryos explanted at the primitive streak/ regressing node stages performed better in vitro than embryos explanted at earlier or later stages. The embryo that developed the furthest had a newly formed node at the initiation of culture and after 64 h in vitro it had developed forelimb ridges, fused, beating heart tubes and mesonephric ducts. Thus high oxygen appears to be the critical component of the culture system for optimal development of primitive streak stage tammar embryos. These results provide a basis for developing culture conditions for longer term development of marsupial embryos in vitro...|$|R
40|$|Autoantibodies against {{chromatin}} are {{the most}} characteristic serological feature in SLE patients. Anti-dsDNA and nucleosome-specific antibodies are associated with glomerulonephritis, the most serious manifestation of SLE. Identification of peptides mimicking conformational epitopes (so-called mimotopes) on the nucleosome recognized by these antibodies is of considerable interest. Using an approach {{similar to that used}} previously to characterize mimotopes for anti-DNA autoantibodies, we have selected and identified a mimotope for a nucleosome-specific autoantibody (# 32) by screening a random peptide phage display library. However, the reactivity of monoclonal antibody (mAb) # 32 with the selected mimotope (MIMO# 0) in ELISA was dependent on the blocking reagents used. Using nonfat dry milk (5 %), mAb # 32 clearly bound to MIMO# 0, but using <b>fetal</b> bovine <b>calf</b> <b>serum</b> (FCS) (5 %), there was no binding. Furthermore, again dependent on the blocking reagent used in ELISA, the selected mimotope MIMO# 0 was not only recognized by the selecting antibody mAb # 32, but also by a large number of other monoclonal anti-DNA, anti-histone and nucleosome-specific autoantibodies (NSA). We could demonstrate that the selected mimotope was able to bind directly to nucleosomal material (DNA/histone complexes) and labeled DNA. This finding was extended to other previously identified mimotopes for anti-DNA autoantibodies. We conclude that nucleosomal material (DNA/histone complexes), derived from reagents used during the mimotope selection procedure, resulted in the selection of DNA-binding peptides from the phage display library, rather than mimotopes. In addition, we could demonstrate that blocking reagents greatly influence the reactivity of anti-DNA, anti-histone and nucleosome-specific autoantibodies in ELISA. Development of blocking reagents devoid of nucleosomal material (DNA/histone complexes) is urgently needed for assay systems in which anti-nuclear autoantibodies are tested...|$|R

The medium with the highest melatonin concentration had the highest trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity, whose values were comparable with those determined in plasma sampled from adult ewes (8. 7 ± 2. 4 mM). The other media had lower trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity values (P < 0. 01), below {{the range of the}} plasma. At the same time, embryos cultured with the highest melatonin concentration reported a lower in vitro viability, as evaluated by lower re-expansion and hatching rates, and lower total cell number compared with the other groups (P < 0. 05). Their metabolic status was also affected, as evidenced by higher oxidative and apoptotic index and lower ATP concentration. The beneficial effects of melatonin on embryo development during postwarming culture were observed only at low concentration (10 − 9 M). These results suggest that melatonin at high concentration may exert some degree of toxic activity on pre-implantation embryos.

50|$|Alan Hall {{showed the}} {{specificity}} of Rho in the stimulation of focal adhesions and stress fibers formation in fibroblasts {{in the presence of}} extracellular factors in 1992. He first realized that the addition of bovine <b>fetal</b> <b>calf</b> <b>serum</b> (FCS) to Swiss 3T3 cells increased the polymerization of actin and assembly of stress fibers. The immunofluorescence following the increase of vinculin and talin, two cytoskeletal proteins, at the intracellular face of the plasma membrane with Val14rhoA microinjection showed the association of focal adhesions {{with the end of the}} new stress fibers. After size fractionation of FCS and analysis of the lipids that bound to serum albumin, the lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) was found to be responsible for the serum activity that induced stress fiber formation. The inhibition of Rho by C3 transferase ribosylation resulted in an inhibition of focal adhesion and stress fiber assembly, but had no effect on membrane ruffling. These findings were published in Cell and cited over 4000 times. In parallel with this experiment, Hall showed that the presence of Rac, another Ras-related GTP-binding protein, is implicated in the regulation of the actin organization in presence of extracellular growth factors. Immunofluorescence and antibody techniques were used in order to localize the mutant V12rac1 protein after being microinjected into the cytoplasm of confluent serum-starved Swiss 3T3 cells. The comparison with the normal cells showed that Rac1 stimulates actin filament production at the membrane, pinocytosis, and membrane ruffling. The inhibition of endogenous Rac function by mutants N17rac and V12rac1 prevented growth factor-induced membrane ruffling. In addition, the inactivation of Rho protein by ADP-ribosylation in Rac1 microinjection reduced the formation of actin stress fibers. Hall concluded that Rac and Rho are complementary for polymerized actin organization. Indeed, Rho-dependent response is stimulated by the action of growth factors on Rac protein.|$|E

To address this, we explored the effects of cAMP, an inducer of syncytialisation, on human choriocarcinoma cell differentiation and viability under three different culture conditions related to diverse survival status: no serum, 10 % <b>fetal</b> <b>calf</b> <b>serum</b> or 10 % charcoal-stripped <b>fetal</b> <b>calf</b> <b>serum.</b> 8 -Br-cAMP increased BeWo cell viability in culture media without serum, but viability was decreased in a dose- and time-dependent manner when serum was present. The appearance of apoptotic nuclei fragments were only observed when BeWo {{cells were cultured in}} media containing serum combined with 8 -Br-cAMP treatment. In addition, the ratio of FasL to Fas expression following treatment with 8 -Br-cAMP increased by 20 -fold in 10 % charcoal-stripped <b>fetal</b> <b>calf</b> <b>serum</b> media and 65 -fold 10 % <b>fetal</b> <b>calf</b> <b>serum</b> media, and activation of caspase- 3 also required media with serum.

Syncytia formation was stimulated by 8 -Br-cAMP and this required serum in the media.

40|$|Background: A liver-derived protein, fetuin-A, {{was first}} {{purified}} from <b>calf</b> <b>fetal</b> <b>serum</b> in 1944, but its potential role in lethal systemic inflammation was previously unknown. This study aims to delineate the molecular mechanisms underlying {{the regulation of}} hepatic fetuin-A expression during lethal systemic inflammation (LSI), and investigated whether alterations of fetuin-A levels affect animal survival, and influence systemic accumulation of a late mediator, HMGB 1. Methods and Findings: LSI was induced by endotoxemia or cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) in fetuin-A knock-out or wild-type mice, and animal survival rates were compared. Murine peritoneal macrophages were challenged with exogenous (endotoxin) or endogenous (IFN-c) stimuli in the absence or presence of fetuin-A, and HMGB 1 expression and release was assessed. Circulating fetuin-A levels were decreased in a time-dependent manner, starting between 26 h, reaching a nadir around 24 – 48 h, and returning towards base-line approximately 72 h post onset of endotoxemia or sepsis. These dynamic changes were mirrored by an early cytokine IFN-c-mediated inhibition (up to 50 – 70 %) of hepatic fetuin-A expression. Disruption of fetuin-A expression rendered animals more susceptible to LSI, whereas supplementation of fetuin-A (20 – 100 mg/kg) dose-dependently increased animal survival rates.

Sera of two genetically obese rodent species, fa/fa Zucker rats and C 57 Bl/KsJ-db/db mice, contain a high adipogenic activity which {{is very similar to}} that found in <b>fetal</b> <b>calf</b> <b>serum.</b> In contrast, sera of their lean siblings (Fa/Fa-Zucker rats and C 57 Bl/KsJ-+/+ mice) are devoid of adipogenic activity...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{progression}} of {{left ventricular hypertrophy}} and cardiac fibrosis in hypertensive heart disease is influenced by sex and age. Although angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition {{has been shown to}} prevent {{progression of}} the disease in postmenopausal women, the interaction of angiotensin II and estrogen in this process before and after the menopause is poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influence of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor moexiprilat on serum, estrogen and angiotensin II-induced cardiac fibroblast growth. METHODS: Neonatal rat cardiac fibroblasts were incubated with 1 and 10 % <b>fetal</b> <b>calf</b> <b>serum,</b> 10 (- 7) mol/l angiotensin II, 10 (- 9) mol/l estrone, 10 (- 9) mol/l 17 beta-estradiol and 10 (- 8) mol/l moexiprilat. Proliferation was measured in terms of incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine. Western blot analysis was performed using antibodies directed against the growth-related immediate early genes c-fos and Sp- 1. All experiments were performed at least three times. RESULTS: <b>Fetal</b> <b>calf</b> <b>serum</b> stimulated cardiac fibroblast proliferation (1 % <b>fetal</b> <b>calf</b> <b>serum</b> 2. 0 +/- 0. 028 -fold; 10 % <b>fetal</b> <b>calf</b> <b>serum</b> 2. 7 +/- 0. 028 -fold). Angiotensin II and estrone stimulated proliferation of cardiac fibroblasts grown in the absence of <b>fetal</b> <b>calf</b> <b>serum</b> (angiotensin II 4. 2 +/- 0. 075 -fold; estrone 2. 9 +/- 0. 034 -fold) and further increased proliferation in the presence of 1 % <b>fetal</b> <b>calf</b> <b>serum</b> (angiotensin 11 4. 3 +/- 0. 072 -fold); estrone 3. 8 +/- 0. 045 -fold) and 10 % <b>fetal</b> <b>calf</b> <b>serum</b> (angiotensin II 4. 8 +/- 0. 112 -fold; estrone 4. 1 +/- 0. 047 -fold). Coincubation with moexiprilat specifically inhibited proliferation induced by angiotensin II and estrone but not by serum, and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockade inhibited angiotensin II-induced but not estrone-induced cell growth. Western blot analysis showed that the expression of c-fos and Sp- 1 was induced in a time-dependent fashion by angiotensin II (to maxima of 5. 0 -fold for c-fos and 3. 0 -fold for Sp- 1) and estrone (15. 2 -fold for c-fos and 6. 2 -fold for Sp- 1). This effect was completely inhibited by moexiprilat. CONCLUSIONS: Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition modulates cardiac fibroblast growth induced by angiotensin II and estrone. This mechanism might contribute to the beneficial effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition in postmenopausal patients with hypertensive heart disease...|$|E
40|$|Aim: We {{investigated}} monocyte and macrophage {{death and}} cytokine production induced by amorphous silica nanoparticles (SiO 2 -NPs) {{to clarify the}} role of defined serum corona proteins. Materials & methods: The cytotoxic proinflammatory effects of SiO 2 -NPs on human monocytes and macrophages were characterized in no serum, in <b>fetal</b> <b>calf</b> <b>serum</b> and {{in the presence of}} purified corona proteins. Results: In no serum and in <b>fetal</b> <b>calf</b> <b>serum</b> above approximately 75 µg/ml, SiO 2 -NPs lysed monocytes and macrophages by plasma membrane damage (necrosis). In <b>fetal</b> <b>calf</b> <b>serum</b> below approximately 75 µg/ml, SiO 2 -NPs triggered an endolysosomal acidification and caspase- 1 -dependent monocyte death (pyroptosis). The corona high-density lipoproteins:albumin ratio accounted for the features of the SiO 2 -NPs in serum. Discussion: Corona high-density lipoproteins are a major determinant of the differential cytotoxic action of SiO 2 -NPs on monocytes and macrophage...|$|E
40|$|By using {{representative}} {{strains of}} Chlamydia trachomatis serotypes, {{the efficacy of}} substituting fetal bovine <b>serum</b> with newborn <b>calf</b> <b>serum</b> for the isolation of this organism in tissue culture was examined. The criteria used were {{the quality and quantity}} of the iodine-stained cytoplasmic inclusions and the characteristics of the McCoy cells. Complete substitution of fetal bovine <b>serum</b> with newborn <b>calf</b> <b>serum</b> produced a detrimental change in the quality of the cytoplasmic inclusions and a dramatic decline in the inclusion count (P less than 0. 001) with all of the chlamydial strains tested. There appeared to be no significant alteration in the characteristics of the McCoy cells. It is recommended from this preliminary investigation that newborn <b>calf</b> <b>serum</b> should not be used for the isolation of C. trachomatis in tissue culture...|$|R
40|$|A liver-derived protein, fetuin-A, {{was first}} {{purified}} from <b>calf</b> <b>fetal</b> <b>serum</b> in 1944, but its potential role in lethal systemic inflammation was previously unknown. This study aims to delineate the molecular mechanisms underlying {{the regulation of}} hepatic fetuin-A expression during lethal systemic inflammation (LSI), and investigated whether alterations of fetuin-A levels affect animal survival, and influence systemic accumulation of a late mediator, HMGB 1. LSI was induced by endotoxemia or cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) in fetuin-A knock-out or wild-type mice, and animal survival rates were compared. Murine peritoneal macrophages were challenged with exogenous (endotoxin) or endogenous (IFN-γ) stimuli in the absence or presence of fetuin-A, and HMGB 1 expression and release was assessed. Circulating fetuin-A levels were decreased in a time-dependent manner, starting between 26 h, reaching a nadir around 24 - 48 h, and returning towards base-line approximately 72 h post onset of endotoxemia or sepsis. These dynamic changes were mirrored by an early cytokine IFN-γ-mediated inhibition (up to 50 - 70 %) of hepatic fetuin-A expression. Disruption of fetuin-A expression rendered animals more susceptible to LSI, whereas supplementation of fetuin-A (20 - 100 mg/kg) dose-dependently increased animal survival rates. The protection {{was associated with a}} significant reduction in systemic HMGB 1 accumulation in vivo, and parallel inhibition of IFN-γ- or LPS-induced HMGB 1 release in vitro. These experimental data suggest that fetuin-A is protective against lethal systemic inflammation partly by inhibiting active HMGB 1 release...|$|R
40|$|The lipid {{compositions}} of (i) monkey kidney (MK- 2) cells {{cultivated in}} Eagle's {{minimal essential medium}} (MEM) with 5 % <b>calf</b> <b>serum,</b> (ii) MK- 2 cells cultivated in Waymouth medium supplemented with 20 μg of sodium oleate and 2 mg of bovine albumin per ml, (iii) Chlamydia psittaci strain 6 BC grown in the latter host system, and (iv) <b>calf</b> <b>serum</b> were compared. Strain 6 BC contains 31 % phosphatidyl ethanolamine (PE) and 15 % phosphatidyl glycerol (PG), whereas the host cell contains almost {{the same amount of}} PE (27 %) and no PG. A high concentration of total lipid was observed in strain 6 BC (29 to 34 %), whereas MK- 2 cells contain only 9 to 15 % and <b>calf</b> <b>serum</b> contains 4. 5 % total lipid. The fatty acids of the total lipid from strain 6 BC contain branched-chain acids. These fatty acids were found mostly in PE (33. 0 %) and PG (37. 0 %). No branched-chain fatty acid was found in the MK- 2 cells. There was an increase in triglyceride content when MK- 2 cells cultivated in MEM (19. 2 %) were compared with cells cultivated in Waymouth medium (28. 0 %). A high concentration (62. 0 %) of octadecenoic acid (C 18 : 1) was found in the triglyceride of MK- 2 cells cultivated in Waymouth medium. The level of polyunsaturated fatty acids observed in MK- 2 cells cultivated in Waymouth medium (10. 8 %) and in the chlamydiae grown in these cells (13. 3 %) was low compared with the level in MK- 2 cells (28. 8 %) cultivated in MEM with 5 % <b>calf</b> <b>serum</b> and the level in <b>calf</b> <b>serum</b> itself (50. 8 %). A higher ratio of sterol ester to free sterol was found in <b>calf</b> <b>serum</b> than in MK- 2 cells or in chlamydiae. Host contribution to lipid composition of strain 6 BC is discussed...|$|R
