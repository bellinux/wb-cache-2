5000|$|Fire arrows - A thick dartlike <b>incendiary</b> <b>projectile</b> with a barbed point, {{wrapped with}} pitch-soaked canvas which took fire when {{the gun was}} fired. The point stuck in sails, hulls, or spars and {{set fire to the}} enemy ship.|$|E
50|$|The Iberians used to bind {{combustible}} {{material to the}} metal shaft of the weapon and use the falarica as an <b>incendiary</b> <b>projectile.</b> The incendiary javelin would hit the shields or siege works of the enemy often setting them ablaze.|$|E
5000|$|The Ampulomet (125-мм ампуломёт образца 1941 года, also {{rendered}} Ampulomyot, ampulla mortar, etc., lit. [...] "ampule/vial thrower" [...] cf. миномёт) was an expedient {{anti-tank weapon}} which launched a 125mm <b>incendiary</b> <b>projectile</b> made of spherical glass. This weapon {{was introduced in}} 1941 and used (to a limited degree) by the Red Army in World War II, but by 1942 was largely obsolete.|$|E
50|$|Ammunition was semifixed, with High-explosive, armor-piercing warhead, shrapnel, and gas shells, {{and time}} fuzes for smoke and <b>incendiary</b> <b>projectiles.</b>|$|R
50|$|Category A (prohibited) {{includes}} {{fully automatic}} firearms, ammunition with penetrating, explosive or <b>incendiary</b> <b>projectiles,</b> and handgun ammunition with expanding projectiles (except where entitled). Authorization {{may be possible}} in special cases.|$|R
50|$|The SU-76M had a {{large number}} of {{ammunition}} types. They included armour-piercing (usual, with ballistic nose and subcaliber hyper-velocity), hollow charge, high explosive, fragmentation, shrapnel and <b>incendiary</b> <b>projectiles.</b> This made the SU-76M an excellent multi-purpose light armoured fighting vehicle.|$|R
50|$|A modern {{version of}} the {{incendiary}} shell was developed in 1857 by the British and was known as Martin's shell after its inventor. The shell was filled with molten iron and was intended to break up on impact with an enemy ship, splashing molten iron on the target. It {{was used by the}} Royal Navy between 1860 and 1869, replacing Heated shot as an anti-ship, <b>incendiary</b> <b>projectile.</b>|$|E
50|$|Flak turrets {{are slow}} to fire, but have a high ceiling and are accurate. They fire a red, <b>incendiary</b> <b>projectile</b> that bursts at a certain altitude. If an {{aircraft}} suffers a solid hit from an AAA shell, it will burst into flames and spiral to earth, or possibly explode in midair. Even if the aircraft is only grazed, it will likely begin to smoke heavily, indicating severe damage. A sure-fire way to avoid flak fire is to fly very low; depending on the elevation of the turret and {{the angle of the}} gun, the shell may be able to go higher than the operating ceiling of the target.|$|E
50|$|The final type of {{projectile}} for {{the field}} artillery used by the French was the incendiary or carcass (a name for an <b>incendiary</b> <b>projectile).</b> Initially this device was composed of a metal frame, which {{was covered with a}} canvas cover and filled with a special recipe, typically saltpetre 50 parts, sulfur 25 parts, rosin 8 parts, antimony 5 parts, and pitch 5 parts. However, during the early 19th century, another form of carcass became common and this took the form of a common shell with two or three apertures in its exterior into which a similar composition was put. Carcass rounds were normally only issued to howitzers or mortars, the suggestion being they were intended to attack towns. This does not preclude them from being used on the field but quite what their purpose would have been there is not clear.|$|E
50|$|Ballistic foam is a foam {{that sets}} hard. It {{is widely used}} in the {{manufacture}} and repair of aircraft to form a light but strong filler for aircraft wings. The foam is used to surround aircraft fuel tanks to reduce the chance of fires caused by the penetration of <b>incendiary</b> <b>projectiles.</b>|$|R
50|$|Ammunition (cartridges for weapons), {{securely}} packaged (in Div. 1.4S, UN 0012 or UN 0014 only), in quantities {{not exceeding}} 5 kg (11 lb) gross weight {{per person for}} that person's own use, excluding ammunition with explosive or <b>incendiary</b> <b>projectiles.</b> Allowances {{for more than one}} passenger must not be combined into one or more packages.|$|R
50|$|<b>Incendiary</b> <b>projectiles,</b> in {{particular}} those intended for armor penetration, {{are more effective}} if they explode after penetrating a surface layer, such that they explode inside the target. Additionally, targets with onboard electronics or computers can be damaged by metal fragments when they explode on the surface. Ignition is often delayed by varying means until after impact.|$|R
40|$|A novel {{protective}} covering with a layered and staggered structure was proposed to protect concrete against projectile impact. Experimental {{study was conducted}} to investigate the ballistic behaviour of the concrete targets against 12. 7 mm armour-piercing <b>incendiary</b> <b>projectile</b> at velocities ranging from 537. 7 to 596. 5 m/s. The results showed that the concrete targets with {{protective covering}} exhibited superior integrity with no damage on the distal surface, whereas the concrete targets without protective covering were fractured with penetrating cracks throughout the thickness of the target. Moreover, the protected concrete targets displayed significantly reduced penetration depth compared with the concrete targets without protective covering. The protective covering with epoxy adhesive interlayers had a bigger protection factor than that with silicone sealant interlayers, but the former suffered more severe damage than the latter...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: In {{the combat}} {{vehicles}} many materials {{can be used}} for the armour. Application of the monolithic armour plates in light combat vehicles is limited by the high armour weigh. Introduction of the layered armour plates is a way to limit the vehicle weight. In the paper test results of graded and nanostructural GMA surfaced armour plates are presented. Design/methodology/approach: Metallographic structure, chemical composition and hardness of surfaced layers were investigated in order to examine the influence of the layered armour plate construction on penetration failure mechanism. EDS chemical microanalysis was carried out on the cross section of surfaced armour plates to find the correlation between the structure components distribution, a GMA surfaced layer thickness and the armour plates ballistic resistance. Findings: The experimental tests confirmed a high ballistic resistance of the GMA surfaced armour plates against B- 32 armour-piercing <b>incendiary</b> <b>projectile.</b> The special microstructure of nanostructural deposited metal provides high hardness and resistance against impact load. Practical implications: In order to achieve a high ballistic resistance of GMA surfaced armour, nanostructural layer thickness of at least 4. 5 [mm] is needed. To optimize the armour plate weight and high ballistic resistance the ratio of soft austenite under-layer thickness and total armour plate thickness need to be tested. Originality/value: The special microstructure of nanostructural deposited metal, provides high hardness and resistance against impact load...|$|E
500|$|The Wujing Zongyao records {{detailed}} {{descriptions of}} gunpowder weapons such as <b>incendiary</b> <b>projectiles,</b> smoke bombs, fire arrows, and grenades. It documents <b>incendiary</b> <b>projectiles</b> containing low-nitrate gunpowder, which were launched from catapults or lowered down from city walls onto besiegers. Examples of these incendiaries include the [...] "swallow-tail" [...] incendiary ( [...] ; yanweiju) and the flying incendiary ( [...] ; feiju). The swallow-tail incendiary was made of straw tied together and dipped in fat or oil. Chinese soldiers defending a city under siege would light the incendiary and lower it onto any wooden structure of the invading army to engulf it in fire. The flying incendiary visually resembled the swallow-tail incendiary, but was lowered using an iron chain from a swape lever installed {{within the walls of}} the city. The book also describes an 'igniter ball' used in warfare and for finding the firing range. The Wujing Zongyao stated the following: ...|$|R
5|$|The years 904–906 saw {{the use of}} <b>incendiary</b> <b>projectiles</b> called 'flying fires' (fei-huo). Needham (1986) {{argues that}} {{gunpowder}} was first used in warfare in China in 919 as a fuse for the ignition of another incendiary, Greek fire. Initially, gunpowder mixtures were utilised through traditional engines and throwing mechanisms; containers and grenades were thrown by mangonels and trebuchets, and explosive rockets and arrows were developed, along with gunpowder flamethrowers.|$|R
50|$|The type 4 used semifixed {{ammunition}} with high-explosive, {{as well as}} armor-piercing, shrapnel, chemical, {{smoke and}} <b>incendiary</b> tracer <b>projectiles.</b>|$|R
50|$|Afterwards, General Li Shiji's army {{advanced}} to Liaodong (Ryotong). On 7 June 645, they crushed a Goguryeo army of 40,000 troops strong, who {{were sent to}} the city to relieve the city from the Tang siege. A few days later, Emperor Taizong's cavalry arrived at Liaodong. On 16 June, the Tang army successfully set Liaodong ablaze with <b>incendiary</b> <b>projectiles</b> and breached its defensive walls, resulting in the fall of Liaodong to the Tang forces.|$|R
50|$|The 8.8 cm SK C/35 gun weighed 776 kg and had {{an overall}} length of 3.985 m with a {{vertical}} sliding-block breech. The gun fired a 9.5 kg projectile 88 mm in diameter, and the barrel is sometimes described as 45 caliber. A 2.82 kg propellent charge produced muzzle velocity of 700 m/s with nose-fuzed high explosive and high explosive <b>incendiary</b> <b>projectiles</b> (with or without tracer). Useful life expectancy was 12,000 effective full charges (EFC) per barrel.|$|R
50|$|The SU-76M thin armour {{and open}} top made it {{vulnerable}} to antitank weapons, grenades, and small arms. Its light weight and low ground pressure gave it good mobility. The SU-76M combined three main battlefield roles: light assault gun, mobile anti-tank weapon and mobile gun for indirect fire. The SU-76M {{had a large}} number of ammunition types. They included armour-piercing (usual, with ballistic nose and subcaliber hyper-velocity), hollow charge, high explosive, fragmentation, shrapnel and <b>incendiary</b> <b>projectiles.</b> This made the SU-76M an excellent multi-purpose light armoured fighting vehicle.|$|R
50|$|The MG FF fired a 134 g {{projectile}} with a muzzle {{velocity of}} some 600 m/s and {{a rate of}} fire of about 520 rounds per minute. The MG FF/M fired a 90 g HE/M (high explosive mine shell) projectile with a muzzle velocity of c. 700 m/s and a rate of fire of c. 540 rounds per minute. AP, HE and <b>incendiary</b> <b>projectiles</b> were also available (115 to 117 g projectiles, 585 m/s, c. 520 rpm) because the mine-shot was not capable of holding incendiary or tracer parts.|$|R
25|$|The Siege of Smyrna (December 1402) {{was fought}} between the Knights of Rhodes, {{who held the}} harbour and sea-castle of Smyrna (now İzmir) in western Anatolia, and {{the army of the}} Turco-Mongol emir Timur. The Turco-Mongols {{blockaded}} the harbour and attacked the fortifications with stone-throwing siege engines, while the defenders, numbering only about 200 knights, countered with arrows and <b>incendiary</b> <b>projectiles.</b> After two weeks of strong resistance against a far superior adversary, the outer wall was destroyed by mining and breached. Some of the garrison managed to escape by sea, but the inhabitants and the city itself were destroyed.|$|R
50|$|On 1 May, General Li Shiji's troops entered Goguryeo territory, {{crossing}} the Liao River farther north and surprising their opponents. On 16 May, they laid siege to Gaimou (Kaemo) Fortress, capturing it in only 11 days, and seizing 20,000 people and 100,000 shi (6 million liters) of grain. General Li Shiji then proceeded toward Liaodong (Yodong) Fortress, and crushed a Goguryeo relief army of 40,000 troops. He {{was joined by}} Emperor Taizong and his armored cavalries a few days later, and laid siege to Liaodong Fortress, capturing it too with surprising ease on 16 June with <b>incendiary</b> <b>projectiles</b> and favorable winds, allowing Tang troops to breach the fortress walls.|$|R
5000|$|Guernica, {{the most}} ancient town of the Basques and {{the centre of the}}ir {{cultural}} tradition, was completely destroyed yesterday afternoon by insurgent air raiders. The bombardment of this open town far behind the lines occupied precisely three hours and a quarter, during which a powerful fleet of aeroplanes consisting of three types of German types, Junkers and Heinkel bombers, did not cease unloading on the town bombs weighing from 1,000 lbs. downwards and, it is calculated, more than 3,000 two-pounder aluminium <b>incendiary</b> <b>projectiles.</b> The fighters, meanwhile, plunged low from above the centre of the town to machinegun those of the civilian population who had taken refuge in the fields." ...|$|R
5000|$|On February 2, 1863, after ramming {{and firing}} <b>incendiary</b> <b>projectiles</b> into the Confederate steamer CSS City of Vicksburg under the fortress’s guns, Queen of the West {{was caught in}} the {{conflagration}} and forced to withdraw down stream, fighting fires in the bow and near her starboard wheel. [...] The next day she forced ashore and captured Confederate steamers O. W. Baker, Moro, and Berwick Bay. On February 12 she ascended the Red River and entered the Atchafalaya River where a landing party destroyed Confederate Army wagons. That evening, Southern planters fired into the ship, severely wounding the senior naval officer aboard. The next day, in reprisal, Ellet destroyed all nearby buildings.|$|R
5000|$|The {{book was}} {{compiled}} during the Northern Song dynasty by {{scholars such as}} Zeng Gongliang, Ding Du (丁度) and Yang Weide (楊惟德), whose writing influenced many later Chinese military writers. The compendium was published {{under the auspices of}} Emperor Renzong, who also authored the book's preface. The book covers a wide range of subjects, everything from naval warships to different types of catapults. In addition to formulas for gunpowder, the compendium contains details on various gunpowder weapons such as incendiary bombs, fire arrows, <b>incendiary</b> <b>projectiles,</b> grenades, and smoke bombs. It also describes an early form of the compass (using [...] ), and has the oldest illustration of a Chinese Greek fire flamethrower with a double-acting two-piston cylinder-pump capable of shooting a continuous blast of flame.|$|R
25|$|Under {{the command}} of three unnamed captains, the Ghenters laid siege to Oudenaarde on 14 April 1453, also occupying Espierres, attacking Aalst and later (on 16 April) unsuccessfully {{attempting}} to take Grammont. They threw two bridges over the Scheldt {{on either side of}} the city so that they could attack from both banks. De Lalaing prepared to resist the attackers by burning the suburbs of the city. The Ghenters transported a large amount of artillery by the river, described by one chronicler as including bombards, cannons, veuglaries and serpentines. Among these was the huge bombard known as Dulle Griet, which weighed more than 16 tons. The defenders also had a large number of artillery pieces and the resulting artillery duel over the course of the siege was one of the largest seen in Europe until that point. The defenders organised firewatch parties to counter <b>incendiary</b> <b>projectiles</b> launched into the city at night and tanks of water in the street to put out fires.|$|R
40|$|Assuming some {{passages}} {{by ancient}} Authors (mainly Plutarchos, Petrarca and Da Vinci) as clues, the authors investigate {{on the possibility}} that Archimedes built a steam cannon {{and used it to}} hit the Roman ships with <b>incendiary</b> <b>projectiles.</b> The investigations are mainly based on the cannon drawings from Leonardo Da Vinci that he attributes to Archimedes and on some other historical clues. First of all is discussed the plausibility that Archimedes (as a legend tells) really used large concave mirrors that concentrated the sun rays to burn the Roman ships. Then the authors propose an algorithm to evaluate the pressure diagram in such a steam cannon; this in order to predict its performances. Finally projectile trajectories and range figures are computed in order to evaluate the possibility of such a cannon to hit a moving ship. Working cycle and projectile trajectory of Archimedes' steam cannon (based on reported historical clues) show compatibility with ancient technology and effectiveness...|$|R

5000|$|The first {{references}} {{to the type of}} grenade used in a hand mortar occur in a 1472 work entitled Valturius, where an incendiary prototype may have been produced. However, widespread use of the explosive grenade does not occur until the early-to-mid-16th century under Francis I of France. [...] An early casualty of this type of grenade was Count de Randan who died of shrapnel wounds to the legs from a grenade during the Siege of Rouen (probably the battle of Issoire) in 1562. [...] Explosive grenades were made from brass, glass, and possibly clay, and <b>incendiary</b> <b>projectiles</b> were made from canvas, however, Nathanael Nye, Master Gunner of the City of Worcester in a work entitled Art of Gunnery published in 1647, remarks that the soldiers of his day were not fond of handling the grenades because they were too dangerous. While there are substantial records of infantry units called grenadiers throughout the 18th century in Europe, these units generally threw the grenades by hand.|$|R
50|$|Nevertheless, by October 1573 Malacca was {{scarcely}} defended as most soldiers were embarked in commercial missions, and the Sultan of Aceh had gathered 7,000 {{men and a}} fleet of 25 galleys, 34 galliots and 30 craft and requested assistance from the Queen of Kalinyamat (Japará in Portuguese) to siege it. Without waiting for his ally, in October 13 the Aceh force landed south of Malacca and cause severe casualties on the Portuguese who attempted a sortie. Thereafter they began attacking the fortress with <b>incendiary</b> <b>projectiles,</b> causing several fires but a sudden storm took out the fires and scattered the fleet, and the assault was called off. The Aceh commander then decided to establish a naval base by the Muar River and force the city to surrender through a naval blockade instead, capturing any passing tradeships that carried supplies to the city. An attempt to board a galleon and two carracks anchored by the Island of Naus (modern-day Pulau Melaka) was met with heavy resistance and suffered severe casualties from Portuguese gunfire.|$|R
5000|$|Roman {{artillery}} {{was very}} efficient at that time, and during a siege the Romans would attack the weakest area of their enemy’s defenses {{and attempt to}} breach the walls at that point. To support this effort, artillery fire would commence, with three main objectives: to cause damage to defenses, casualties among the opposing army, and loss of enemy morale. It would also provide cover fire for troops building siege ramps or those in siege towers. There were machines called [...] tormenta , which would launch (sometimes <b>incendiary)</b> <b>projectiles</b> such as javelins, arrows, rocks, or beams. These devices were on wheeled platforms to follow the line’s advance. All were “predicated on a principle of physics: a lever was inserted into a skein of twisted horsehair to increase torsion, and when the arm was released, {{a considerable amount of}} energy was thus freed”. It was later stated that sinew, instead of twisted hair, provided a better “spring.” These weapons were high-maintenance devices and vulnerable to having their leather, sinew, or hemp skeins affected by wet or even damp, which would cause them to slacken and lose tension, rendering the engine useless.|$|R
5000|$|There {{has been}} much debate over whether the Mk 211 {{projectile}} is legal to use against personnel, {{or if it is}} strictly anti-matériel ammunition. The International Committee of the Red Cross has sought to have the ammunition banned, due to concern over the incendiary and explosive components and their effect on personnel. Under the Saint Petersburg Declaration of 1868 the [...] "military or naval" [...] use of explosive or <b>incendiary</b> <b>projectiles</b> with a mass of under 400 grams is forbidden. Very few nations were parties to the St. Petersburg Declaration, however, and that declaration does not govern the conduct of non-signatory parties. Further, the Hague treaties of 1899 and 1907 - which superseded the St. Petersburg Declaration, and were signed by a far wider circle of nations - do permit the use of such ammunition for auto-cannons and heavy machine guns. Machine guns firing [...]50 cal/12.7mm ammunition are heavy machine guns. At best, the ICRC's position can be applied to only a small group of nations that were parties to the St. Petersburg Declaration; at worst, the ICRC's position is made moot by more than 100 years of subsequent international treaties.|$|R
50|$|In China {{and other}} parts of Asia, fire arrows were thick, dartlike, rocket-propelled <b>incendiary</b> <b>projectiles</b> with barbed points, wrapped with pitch-soaked canvas which took fire when the rocket was launched, which could either be from special {{launching}} racks or from a cannon barrel (see Chongtong, Bō hiya.) The point stuck in sails, hulls or spars and set fire to the enemy ship. In Western naval warfare, shore forts sometimes heated iron shot red-hot in a special furnace before loading it (with water-soaked wads to prevent it from setting off the powder charge prematurely.) The hot shot lodging in a ship's dry timbers would set the ship afire. Because of the danger of fire aboard (and the difficulty of heating and transporting the red-hot shot aboard ship), heated shot was seldom used from ship-mounted cannon, as the danger to your own vessels was almost as great as to the enemy; fire was the single greatest fear of all men sailing in wooden ships. As such, for men aboard these vessels, going up against shore artillery firing heated shot was a terrifying experience, and typically wooden fleets were not expected to brave such fire except in cases of great emergency, as a single heated shot could easily destroy the entire ship and crew, while the same ship could typically be expected to survive numerous hits from normal solid shot.|$|R
5000|$|Before {{and during}} the Second World War, the {{importance}} of the station and the railway workshop rose. More than 100 trains ran on the east-west route each day and numerous trains were assembled in the station. Air raids during the war inflicted severe damage, while the roof of the roundhouse in the workshop was destroyed. On 22 February 1945, an air raid on Scherfede station completely destroyed a signal box and several buildings in the area were damaged by <b>incendiary</b> <b>projectiles.</b> Three people were killed. On 21 March 1945 there was another air raid. On 3 April 1945, the town and the station were occupied by American soldiers after the withdrawal of German troops. During the food shortage immediately after the war, the station was often used by urban women travelling to buy food (on Hamsterfahrten, literally “hamster rides”) in the fertile Warburger Börde (the rolling country around Warburg). The station, workshop and Bahnmeisterei (track maintenance supervisor’s office) included about 400 employees at this time. In subsequent years, its importance declined greatly. The workshop lost its independence and was operated from May 1950 for a short time as a branch of the Warburg workshop. Since the mid-1950s, the site has been privately operated. Roads 16 and 17 of the locomotive shed have remained, while the water tower was demolished in the early 1970s. [...] The station building was demolished in 1983. There were two signal boxes at Scherfede station, which were taken into operation in 1915. The western signal box is no longer operational, but it is privately used, while the Eastern signal box is still operated. Scherfede station is not yet connected to an electronic interlocking.|$|R
50|$|Fire arrows {{were one}} of the {{earliest}} forms of weaponized gunpowder. Not to be confused with earlier <b>incendiary</b> arrow <b>projectiles,</b> the fire arrow was a gunpowder weapon which receives its name from the translated Chinese term huǒjiàn (火箭), which literally means fire arrow. In China a 'fire arrow' referred to a gunpowder projectile consisting of a bag of incendiary gunpowder attached to the shaft of an arrow from the 9th century onward. Later on solid fuel rockets utilizing gunpowder were used to provide arrows with propulsive force and the term fire arrow became synonymous with rockets in the Chinese language. In other languages such as Sanskrit 'fire arrow' (agni astra) underwent a different semantic shift and became synonymous with 'cannon.' Fire arrows are the predecessors of fire lances, the first firearm.|$|R
