An ultrasound based prediction model (LR 2) developed by the International Ovarian Tumor Analysis (IOTA) study offers better diagnostic performance than CA 125 alone. In this study we compared the diagnostic accuracy between LR 2 and ROMA. METHODS: This study included women with a pelvic mass scheduled for surgery and enrolled in a previous prospective diagnostic accuracy study. Experienced ultrasound examiners, general gynecologists and trainees supervised by one of the experts performed the preoperative transvaginal ultrasound examinations. Serum biomarkers were taken prior to surgery. Accuracy of LR 2 and ROMA was <b>estimated</b> <b>at</b> <b>completion</b> of this study and did not form part of the decision making process. Final outcome was histology of removed tissues and surgical stage if relevant. RESULTS: In total 360 women were evaluated. 216 women had benign disease and 144 a malignancy. Overall test performance of LR 2 (AUC 0. 952) with 94 % sensitivity and 82 % specificity was significantly better than ROMA (AUC 0. 893) with 84 % sensitivity and 80 % specificity. Difference in AUC was 0. 059 (95 % CI: 0. 026 - 0. 091; P-value 0. 0004). Similar results were obtained when stratified for menopausal status. CONCLUSION: LR 2 shows better diagnostic performance than ROMA for the characterization of a pelvic mass in both pre- and postmenopausal women.

40|$|Traditional {{scheduling}} tools like Gantt Charts and CPM while {{useful in}} planning and execution of complex construction projects with multiple interdependent activities haven?t been of much help in implementing effective control systems for the same projects in case of deviation from their desired or assumed behavior. Further, in case of such deviations project managers in most cases make decisions which might be guided either by the prospects of short term gains or the intension of forcing the project to follow the original schedule or plan, inadvertently increasing the overall project cost. Many deterministic project control methods have been proposed by various researchers for calculating optimal resource schedules considering the time-cost {{as well as the}} time-cost-quality trade-off analysis. But the need is for a project control system which optimizes the effort or cost required for controlling the project by incorporating the stochastic dynamic nature of the construction-production process. Further, such a system must include a method for updating and revising the beliefs or models used for representing the dynamics of the project using the actual progress data of the project. This research develops such an optimal project control method using Kalman Filter forecasting method for updating and using the assumed project dynamics model for forecasting the <b>Estimated</b> Cost <b>at</b> <b>Completion</b> (EAC) and the <b>Estimated</b> Duration <b>at</b> <b>Completion</b> (EDAC) taking into account the inherent uncertainties in the project progress and progress measurements. The controller is then formulated for iteratively calculating the optimal resource allocation schedule that minimizes either the EAC or both the EAC and EDAC together using the evolutionary optimization algorithm Covariance Matrix Adaption Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES). The implementation of the developed framework is used with a hypothetical project and tested for its robustness in updating the assumed initial project dynamics model and yielding the optimal control policy considering some hypothetical cases of uncertainties in the project progress and progress measurements. Based on the tests and demonstrations firstly it is concluded that a project dynamics model based on the project Gantt chart for spatial interdependencies of sub-tasks with triangular progress rates is a good representation of a typical construction project; and secondly, it is shown that the use of CMA-ES in conjunction with the Kalman Filter estimation and forecasting method provides a robust framework that can be implemented for any kind of complex construction process for yielding the optimal control policies...|$|R

These projects are characterized by a high level of size, uncertainty and complexity representing a challenging test for the model. The results obtained show a higher forecasting accuracy of the Bayesian model compared to the traditional Earned Value Management (EVM) methodology. Moreover, the estimates at completion calculated using the Bayesian model are not point estimates such as those calculated by EVM. In fact, the Bayesian approach leads to a probability density function for the forecasted final cost and duration.

The purpose of this work is to propose a new regression-based nonlinear CEAC methodology which integrates Earned Schedule (ES) concept to assume a project progress in calculating CEAC as early as when a project is 20 percent complete. The paper sets three objectives to achieve the research purpose: development of the new equation based on a nonlinear regression modelling and ES method; validation of the new technique through case study application; and, providing a comparison with CPI-based estimates to determine the best performing equation. Testing the prediction accuracy of the proposed and index-based formulae is performed by comparing values of Percentage Error (PE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Based on six case studies from construction industry, the comparison reveals that the new methodology generates better estimates (MAPE= 2, 88 percent) than those calculated by traditional index-based equation (MAPE= 9, 98 percent...|$|E
40|$|Reliable {{forecasting}} of {{the final}} cost at completion {{is one of the}} vital components of project monitoring. Accuracy and stability in the forecast of an ongoing project is a critical criterion that ensures the project's on budget and timely completion. The purpose of this dissertation is to develop a new Cost <b>Estimate</b> <b>at</b> <b>Completion</b> (CEAC) methodology to assist project managers in the task of forecasting the final cost at completion of ongoing projects. This forecasting methodology interpolates intrinsic characteristics of an S-shaped growth model and combines the Earned Schedule (ES) concepts into its equation to provide more accurate and stable cost estimates. Widely used conventional index-based methods for CEAC have inherent limitations such as reliance on past performance only, unreliable forecasts in early stages of a project life, and no count of forecasting statistics. To achieve its purpose the dissertation carried out five tasks. It, first, developed the method's equation based on the integration of the four candidate S-shaped models and the earned schedule concepts. Second, the models' equations were tested on past projects to assess their applicability and, then, the accuracy of CEACs was compared with ones found by the Cost Performance Index (CPI) -based formula. The scope of third task included comparing CEACs found by statistically valid and the most accurate Gompertz model (GM) -based equation against ones computed with the CPI-based method at each time point of the projects life. Then, the stability test was performed to determine if the method, with its corresponding performance indices that achieves the earlier stability, provides more accurate CEAC. Finally, the analysis was conducted to determine the existence of a correlation between schedule progress and the CEAC accuracy. Based on the research results it was determined that the GM-based method is the only valid model for cost estimates in all three stages and it provides more accurate estimates than the CPI-based formula does. Further comparative analysis showed that the two (the GM and CPI-based) methods' performance index that achieved the earlier stability provided more accurate CEACs for that method, and finally, the new methodology takes into account the schedule impact as a factor of the cost performance in forecasting the CEAC. The developed methodology enhances forecasting capabilities of the existing Earned Value Management methods by refining traditional index-based approach through nonlinear regression analysis. The main novelty of the research {{is that this is a}} cost-schedule integrated approach which interpolates characteristics of a sigmoidal growth model with the ES technique to calculate a project's CEAC. Two major contributions are brought to the Project Management. First, the dissertation extends the body of knowledge by introducing the methodology which combined two separate methods in one statistical technique that, so far, have been considered as two separate streams of project management research. Second, this technique advances the project management practice as it is a practical cost-schedule integrated approach that takes into account schedule progress (advance/delay) as a factor of cost behavior in calculation of CEA...|$|E
40|$|Background: Noninvasive {{evaluation}} of {{central venous pressure}} (CVP) {{can be achieved by}} assessing the Jugular Venous Pressure (JVP), Peripheral Venous Collapse (PVC), and ultrasound visualization of the inferior vena cava. The relative accuracy of these techniques compared to one another and their application by trainees of varying experience remains uncertain. We compare the application and utility of the JVP, PVC, and handheld Mini Echo amongst trainees of varying experience including a medical student, internal medicine resident, and cardiology fellow. We also introduce and validate a new physical exam technique to assess central venous pressures, the Anthem sign. Methods: Patients presenting for their regularly scheduled echocardiograms at the hospital echo department had clinical evaluations of their CVP using these non-invasive bedside techniques. The examiners were blinded to the echo results, each other’s assessments, and patient history; their CVP estimates were compared to the gold standard level 3 echo-cardiographer’s <b>estimates</b> <b>at</b> the <b>completion</b> of the study. Results: 325 patients combined were examined (mean age 65, s. d. 16 years). When compared to the gold standard of central venous pressure by a level 3 echocardiographer, the JVP was the most sensitive at 86 %, improving with clinical experience (p, 0. 01). The classic PVC technique and Anthem sign had better specificity compared to the JVP. Mini Echo estimates were comparable to physical exam assessments...|$|R

The classic PVC technique and Anthem sign had better specificity compared to the JVP. Mini Echo estimates were comparable to physical exam assessments. JVP evaluation is the most sensitive physical examination technique in CVP assessments. The PVC techniques along with the newly described Anthem sign may be of value for the early learner who still has not mastered the art of JVP assessment and in obese patients in whom JVP evaluation is problematic. Mini Echo estimates of CVPs are comparable to physical examination by trained clinicians and require less instruction. The use of Mini Echo in medical training should be further evaluated and encouraged...|$|R
