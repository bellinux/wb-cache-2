The German economist Bruno Gleitze from the German Institute for Economic Research estimated that there were 1,200,000 excess deaths caused by the harsh conditions in Germany during and after the war. Gleitze estimated 400,000 excess deaths during the war and 800,000 in post war Germany The West German Statistisches Bundesamt put the actual deaths from 1939-46 due to natural causes at 7,130,000 persons, the demographic study by Peter Marschalck estimated the expected deaths in peacetime due to natural causes of 5,900,000 persons, a difference of 1,230,000 excess deaths. In Allied-occupied Germany the shortage of food was an acute problem in 1946–47. The average <b>kilocalorie</b> intake per day was only 1,600 to 1,800, an amount insufficient for long-term health.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES. This {{research}} used food frequency data {{to investigate}} dietary patterns associated with fat intake. METHODS. Data from the 1987 National Health Interview Survey of 20, 143 adults {{were used to}} determine correlations between fat (adjusted for <b>kilocalories)</b> and both nutrient and food group intakes. Median food and nutrient intakes were determined within quartiles of percentage of <b>kilocalories</b> from fat. RESULTS. Intakes of vegetables, fruits, cereals, fish/chicken, low-fat milk, alcoholic beverages, vitamin C, percentage of <b>kilocalories</b> from carbohydrates, carotenoids, folate, dietary fiber, carbohydrates, and vitamin A decreased as percentage of <b>kilocalories</b> from fat increased. Intakes of salty snacks, peanuts, processed and red meats, whole milk and cheese, desserts, eggs, fried potatoes, table fats, cholesterol, vitamin E, sodium, protein, and energy increased with percentage of <b>kilocalories</b> from fat.

40|$|Investigating the {{association}} between consumption of sweetened beverages and dietary quality is challenging because issues such as reverse causality and unmeasured confounding might result in biased and inconsistent estimates. Using a dynamic panel model with instrumental variables to address those issues, we examined the in-dependent associations of beverages sweetened with caloric and low-calorie sweeteners with dietary quality and food-purchasing patterns. We analyzed purchase data from the Homescan survey, an ongoing, longitudinal, na-tionally representative US survey, from 2000 to 2010 (n = 34, 294). Our model included lagged measures of dietary quality and beverage purchases (servings/day in the previous year) as exposures to predict the outcomes (macro-nutrient (<b>kilocalories</b> per capita per day; %), total energy, and food purchases) {{in the next year}} after adjustment for other sociodemographic covariates. Despite secular declines in purchases (<b>kilocalories</b> per capita per day) from all sources, each 1 -serving/day increase in consumption of either beverage type resulted in higher purchases of total daily <b>kilocalories</b> and <b>kilocalories</b> from food, carbohydrates, total sugar, and total fat. Each 1 -serving/day in-crease in consumption of either beverage was associated with more purchases of caloric-sweetened desserts or sweeteners, which accounted for a substantial proportion of the increase in total <b>kilocalories.</b> We concluded that consumers of both beverages sweetened with low-calorie sweeteners and beverages sweetened with caloric sweeteners had poorer dietary quality, exhibited higher energy from all purchases, sugar, and fat, and purchase...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 57 - 63) Obesity {{has become}} a major health problem in the United States. Measurement of energy expenditure is required before recommendations for caloric intake can be made. Though the energy cost of a variety of activities may be accurately determined, {{there is a need to}} know precisely the energy expenditure required for the wide range of normal daily activities. The object of this study was to measure the energy expenditure of twelve overweight housewives for five days under typical living conditions. A combination of respirometry, heart rate telemetry, food and activity diaries were used to collect the data. Regression equations of heart rate versus caloric expenditure were determined for each subject and were used to calculate energy expenditures. All energy expenditures were also established in a per kilogram basis because of the wide range of body weight in the subjects. The mean total daily energy expenditure for the group was 3078, sd +/- 615 <b>kilocalories</b> or 38. 56, sd +/- 8. 40 <b>kilocalories</b> per kilogram. The mean caloric expenditure per minute was 2. 14, sd +/- 0. 43 <b>kilocalories</b> or 0. 0268, sd +/- 0. 0028 <b>kilocalories</b> per kilogram. Activity charts indicated that the women were very sedentary with about 0. 2 percent of their time spent in moderate activity and only about 26 percent of their time on their feet in standing or walking activities.
