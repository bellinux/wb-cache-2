40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{impact of}} <b>hot</b> <b>flashes</b> on sleep {{is of great}} {{clinical}} interest, but results are inconsistent, especially when both <b>hot</b> <b>flashes</b> and sleep are measured objectively. Using objective and subjective measurements, we examined the impact of <b>hot</b> <b>flashes</b> on sleep by inducing <b>hot</b> <b>flashes</b> with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist. METHODS: The gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist leuprolide was administered to 20 healthy premenopausal volunteers without <b>hot</b> <b>flashes</b> or sleep disturbances. Induced <b>hot</b> <b>flashes</b> were assessed objectively (skin conductance monitor) and subjectively (daily diary) during 1 -month follow-up. Changes from baseline in objective sleep quality (actigraphy) and subjective sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) were compared between women who developed and women who did not develop objective <b>hot</b> <b>flashes</b> and, in parallel analyses, subjective <b>hot</b> <b>flashes.</b> RESULTS: New-onset <b>hot</b> <b>flashes</b> were recorded in 14 (70 %) women and reported by 14 (70 %) women (80 % concordance). Estradiol was universally suppressed. Objective sleep efficiency worsened in women with objective <b>hot</b> <b>flashes</b> and improved in women without objective <b>hot</b> <b>flashes</b> (median decrease, 2. 6 %; median increase, 4. 2 %; P = 0. 005). Subjective sleep quality worsened more in those with subjective <b>hot</b> <b>flashes</b> than in those without subjective <b>hot</b> <b>flashes</b> (median increase in Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, 2. 5 vs 1. 0; P = 0. 03). Objective <b>hot</b> <b>flashes</b> were not associated with subjective sleep quality, nor were subjective symptoms linked to objective sleep measures. CONCLUSIONS: This experimental model of induced <b>hot</b> <b>flashes</b> demonstrates a causal relationship between <b>hot</b> <b>flashes</b> and poor sleep quality. Objective <b>hot</b> <b>flashes</b> result in worse objective sleep efficiency, whereas subjective <b>hot</b> <b>flashes</b> worsen perceived sleep quality...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this study}} is to examine the {{relationship}} between mental workload and occurrence of <b>hot</b> <b>flashes.</b> Twelve women with moderate to severe menopausal <b>hot</b> <b>flashes</b> participated in the study. Subjects participated in both a mental arithmetic task (Task) and control (Non-task) experiments. We measured heart rate, heart rate variability, blood pressure, near infrared spectroscopy, skin temperature, and skin potential level. The incidence of <b>hot</b> <b>flashes</b> was greater in Task than in Non-task. No significant differences between before, during and after <b>hot</b> <b>flashes</b> emerged for the percentage of correct responses and reaction time. However, the percentage of correct responses for two subjects among the ten who experienced <b>hot</b> <b>flashes</b> in Task substantially declined during <b>hot</b> <b>flashes.</b> Chest skin temperatures increased in both Task and Non-task during <b>hot</b> <b>flashes,</b> and regional oxygen saturation was significantly higher in Non-task than in Task. The present study suggested that mental workload under time pressure might be a risk factor for menopausal <b>hot</b> <b>flashes,</b> and the performance of most people who experienced <b>hot</b> <b>flashes</b> was not affected by <b>hot</b> <b>flashes,</b> however, work-related difficulties due to cognitive disturbance during <b>hot</b> <b>flashes</b> might arise in some people...|$|R

Methods: Charts of breast cancer survivors were reviewed for information about <b>hot</b> <b>flashes,</b> treatment for <b>hot</b> <b>flashes,</b> and calcium supplementation. Associations between variables were explored using the Chi-square test and Fisher&rsquo;s Exact test. Results: Eighty-six charts were reviewed.

40|$|Primary Objective : The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} determinants of <b>hot</b> <b>flashes</b> and night sweats, two vasomotor symptoms associated with the hormonal changes of the menopause transition. Methods: Participants were 293 women, aged 45 to 55, randomly selected from automated demographic and membership records of a health maintenance organization in the northeast USA. Letters were mailed to eligible women, followed by face-to-face interviews. Results : <b>Hot</b> <b>flashes</b> during the month before interview were reported by 57 % of the participants, although only 9 % of the entire sample reported <b>hot</b> <b>flashes</b> to be “bothersome”. Night sweats were reported by 36 % of all participants, with 6 % reporting night sweats to be “bothersome”. Fifty-four percent of women reporting <b>hot</b> <b>flashes</b> also reported night sweats. In logistic regression analyses that controlled for menopause status and use of hormone therapy (HT), daily alcohol consumption significantly increased the risk of <b>hot</b> <b>flashes,</b> night sweats, and bothersome night sweats. Higher education and an excellent self-rating of health decreased the risk of night sweats, but not <b>hot</b> <b>flashes.</b> Smoking increased the risk of bothersome <b>hot</b> <b>flashes,</b> but not bothersome night sweats.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} behind <b>hot</b> <b>flashes</b> in menopausal {{women are}} not fully understood. The flashes in women are probably preceded by and actually initiated by a sudden downward shift in the set point for the core body temperature in the thermoregulatory center that is affected by sex steroids, beta-endorphins, and other central neurotransmitters. Treatments that influence these factors {{may be expected to}} reduce <b>hot</b> <b>flashes.</b> Since therapy with sex steroids for <b>hot</b> <b>flashes</b> has appeared to cause a number of side effects and risks and women with <b>hot</b> <b>flashes</b> and breast cancer as well as men with prostate cancer and <b>hot</b> <b>flashes</b> are prevented from sex steroid therapy there is a great need for alternative therapies. Acupuncture affecting the opioid system has been suggested as an alternative treatment option for <b>hot</b> <b>flashes</b> in menopausal women and castrated men. The heat loss during <b>hot</b> <b>flashes</b> may be mediated by the potent vasodilator and sweat gland activator calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) the concentration of which increases in plasma during flashes in menopausal women and, according to one study, in castrated men with flushes.

40|$|Aim: Menopausal <b>hot</b> <b>flashes</b> {{affect the}} {{majority}} of women. Hormone replacement therapy to reduce the severity of <b>hot</b> <b>flashes</b> {{is the most effective}} method. Today, however, due to a number of side effects of hormone therapy more women are seeking alternative treatments such as vitamin pills and herbal products. Previously, various vitamins, minerals and trace elements were studied for this purpose. In this study, our aim was to determine the level of dietary intake of various vitamins in women with <b>hot</b> <b>flashes</b> and to compare them with women who had no complaints. Material and Method: One hundred and seven consecutive women who attended the menopause clinic of our hospital for routine follow up were included in this study. All of the participants were asked about the occurrence of specific menopausal symptoms and completed 92 -itm antioxidant nutrient questionnaire developed by Satia. The main parameters recorded for each woman were; age, obstetrical characteristics, body mass index, smoking status, educational level, type of menopause (surgical or natural), duration of menopause, menopausal symptoms, and number and duration of <b>hot</b> <b>flashes.</b> According to the computerized analysis of questionnaire, dietary intake of water-soluble vitamins; B complex and vitamin C, and fat-soluble vitamins; vitamin, A D, E, K were calculated. Results: Patients were divided into two groups with regard to presence of <b>hot</b> <b>flashes,</b> those with <b>hot</b> <b>flashes</b> constituted the study groups (n: 75), and others without <b>hot</b> <b>flashes</b> constituted the control group (n: 32). The mean age of patients was statistically significantly lower in the study group (p 0, 05). Night sweats and sleep disorders were more common in women with <b>hot</b> <b>flashes.</b> There were no statistically significant differences between the groups regarding the mean levels of dietary intake of evaluated vitamins. Discussion: Although the mean levels of all studied vitamins were lower in women with <b>hot</b> <b>flashes,</b> the differences were statistically insignificant. Supplementation with vitamins should not be recommended in postmenopausal women suffering <b>hot</b> <b>flashes</b> currently. Further investigations are required to determine the role of vitamin supplements for <b>hot</b> <b>flashes...</b>|$|R
