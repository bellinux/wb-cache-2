5|$|After {{the sudden}} death of Labour leader <b>John</b> <b>Smith</b> in May 1994, Brown did not contest the {{leadership}} after Tony Blair became favourite, deciding {{to make way}} for Blair to avoiding splitting the pro-modernising vote in the leadership ballot.|$|E
5|$|Stephen Hartley began brewing in Tadcaster in 1758. In 1845 Jane Hartley mortgaged {{the brewery}} to David Backhouse and John Hartley. In 1847, Samuel Smith of Leeds {{arranged}} {{for his son}} John to enter the business. Jane Hartley died in 1852, and <b>John</b> <b>Smith</b> acquired the business, enlisting his brother William to help him. The timing was to prove fortuitous; pale ales were displacing porter as the beer of choice, and Tadcaster's hard water proved to be well-suited for brewing the new style. The prosperity of the 1850s and 1860s, together {{with the arrival of}} the railways, realised greater opportunities for brewers, and by 1861 <b>John</b> <b>Smith</b> employed eight men in his brewing and malting enterprise.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Scottish & Newcastle {{claimed that}} <b>John</b> <b>Smith's</b> was {{available}} in 40,000 outlets across the United Kingdom. In 2007, Scottish & Newcastle moved production of <b>John</b> <b>Smith's</b> Cask from Tadcaster to Burtonwood near Warrington, and production of <b>John</b> <b>Smith's</b> Magnet to Camerons Brewery of Hartlepool. In 2008 three limited edition beers were released to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the brewery. In 2010 Heineken discontinued production of cask conditioned <b>John</b> <b>Smith's</b> Magnet, although it remains available in kegs. By 2011, production of <b>John</b> <b>Smith's</b> Cask had moved to Cameron's. As of 2012, <b>John</b> <b>Smith's</b> is the sixth highest selling beer brand in the United Kingdom and the highest selling bitter in the world. From February 2013, <b>John</b> <b>Smith's</b> Extra Smooth and Original were reduced from 3.8 to 3.6% ABV. According to Heineken, the decision was taken {{in order to bring}} the product in line with the strength of its major competitors such as Tetley, Boddingtons and Worthington.|$|R
5|$|The brewery brews 3.8 million hectolitres {{annually}} (1.8 {{million of}} which is <b>John</b> <b>Smith's</b> beer), and employed around 300 people in 2008. It has two keg lines, two bottle lines and one canning line. It currently brews and packages the ale brands <b>John</b> <b>Smith's</b> Original, <b>John</b> <b>Smith's</b> Extra Smooth and Newcastle Brown Ale, and the lager brands Foster's, Kronenbourg 1664, Amstel and Tiger.|$|R
500|$|In October 1970, Courage {{purchased}} <b>John</b> <b>Smith's</b> in {{a friendly}} takeover which valued the company at £40million (£ in [...] adjusted for inflation). By this time <b>John</b> <b>Smith's</b> owned around 1,800 licensed premises throughout the north of England, and {{as far south as}} Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire and parts of Cambridgeshire and Shropshire. The merged company held assets worth £137 million. By combining Courage's strength in the South of England, and <b>John</b> <b>Smith's</b> in the North, a national brewing company was created. <b>John</b> <b>Smith's</b> bottled Magnet Pale Ale was selected for nationwide distribution across the group, and the takeover facilitated the wider distribution of Courage brands such as Tavern Keg.|$|R
5|$|By the 19th century, {{the tower}} was {{obscured}} by the surrounding buildings, and was accessed through the brick-built office in front of it, according to the antiquarian and engraver <b>John</b> <b>Smith.</b> The tower began to become too small for storing all the House of Lords' records, and from 1827 onwards only the acts, journals and minute-books were kept in the tower.|$|E
