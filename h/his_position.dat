5|$|A strong {{proponent of}} the day fighter force and the defence of Germany, Galland used <b>his</b> <b>{{position}}</b> to improve {{the position of the}} Jagdwaffe.

Galland was outspoken, something that was not often tolerated by Göring. Yet, by earning and cultivating the support of other powerful personalities in the Luftwaffe, like Erhard Milch and Günther Korten, and personalities in the industrial sector such as Albert Speer and even Adolf Hitler, Galland was able to survive in <b>his</b> <b>position</b> for three years.|$|E
