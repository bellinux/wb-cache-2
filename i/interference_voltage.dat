5000|$|It is {{agreed that}} the most {{important}} characteristic of opto-electronic systems is their noise robustness and insensitivity to electromagnetic fields. What is not considered, however, is that, in addition to the fiber optic line and the output actuator, such a system includes the source of light pulses on the transmitting side and the amplifier on the receiving side that are generally based on micro-circuitry. It is precisely these elements, with low trigger levels, that get damaged by pulse noise (<b>interference,</b> <b>voltage</b> spikes and discharges) of the high voltage power equipment, which negates the main advantage of opto-electronic systems. Moreover, the optical fibers themselves are subject to a severe negative effect of ionizing radiation and external mechanical impacts (which is critically important in military applications). The arrangement of input and output circuits of such systems needs to be widely spaced (requiring a lengthy optical fiber), which drives up the overall dimensions of interface unit. As such, the preferred use of an opto-electronic galvanic decoupling module in interface relays is not always warranted, and is merely the consequence of a stereotypical thinking of design engineers ...|$|E

Figure  4 b shows the effect of the load of terminal side of the transmission line on the <b>interference</b> <b>voltage</b> of S-terminal.

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of pacemaker patients {{among the general}} population and of conducted energy devices (CED) for law enforcement and self-defence is increasing. Consequently, the question whether cardiac pacemaker (CPM) patients are on particular risk becomes increasingly important. The risk of Taser X 26 electric interference with implanted CPM has been investigated by numerical simulation at MRI-based anatomical models of CPM patients with devices implanted at conventional sites (left pectoral, right pectoral and abdominal) and with the monopolar CPM electrode placed at the ventricular apex. In spite of 10 fold higher peak voltages the different coupling conditions make Taser-induced CPM <b>interference</b> <b>voltages</b> lower than those caused by external cardiac defibrillators. It is shown that electric interference considerably depends on ECD electrode orientation. The most unfavourable conditions are encountered with ECD electrodes aligned with the line from the CPM electrode tip to CPM can (EPC line). It could be shown that worst case <b>interference</b> <b>voltages</b> of monopolar pacemakers {{of any kind of}} implantation remain below the pulse immunity level as defined in safety standards of implantable cardiac pacemakers and of cardioverter defibrillators. However, <b>interference</b> <b>voltages</b> exceed CPM sensing thresholds.

40|$|The present {{clinical}} study examined anatomical and physiological {{factors that influence}} an <b>interference</b> <b>voltage</b> at the input of an implanted pacemaker or cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) in a low-frequency electromagnetic field (EMF). "Worst case" conditions were sought that could interfere with proper function of the implanted device and thus endanger the patient with the implant. This investigation was carried out with 15 subjects in a defined 60 Hz electromagnetic field. The <b>interference</b> <b>voltage</b> was recorded using a bipolar {{as well as a}} unipolar electrode configuration; the electrodes were fitted to the chest wall and in an oesophageal catheter positioned immediately adjacent to the right ventricle. The factors examined were: body height, body circumference (in particular chest circumference), body mass index (BMI), respiration, and extent of stomach and cardiac filling. The main findings were that anatomical and physiological factors had a significant effect on the <b>interference</b> <b>voltage,</b> especially with the unipolar system and the 60 Hz electric field. Body circumference and height were the most important anatomical factors. For each 10 cm reduction in thoracic circumference, there was an increase of about 10 percent in <b>interference</b> <b>voltage.</b> With body height, there was an increase in <b>interference</b> <b>voltage</b> of about 11 - 12 % for each 10 cm increase in height. Respiration had the most marked physiological effect, since there was a difference in the <b>interference</b> <b>voltage</b> of over 60 percent between maximal inspiration and maximal expiration. In conclusion, we can state that a combination of the following factors could be regarded as "worst-case": small body circumference, above-average body height, and maximum inspiration. Taken together, these factors can lead to a difference in the <b>interference</b> <b>voltage</b> of over 100 % with a unipolar system in an electrical field. Measurements in a 60 Hz magnetic field showed that this field does contribute to the <b>interference</b> <b>voltage,</b> but this component is only influenced to a limited extent by physiological and anatomical factors. Regardless of anatomical characteristics, our findings demonstrate that with a unipolar system in an electric field, the <b>interference</b> <b>voltage</b> increases as the pacemaker housing is positioned more cranially. It is also clear that the unipolar system is significantly inferior to the bipolar system with regard to its sensitivity to disturbance by a low-frequency EMF. In a magnetic or electric field, a bipolar system only picks up about 5 - 10 % of the noise induced in a unipolar system. The extent of filling of the heart and stomach had no significant effect on the <b>interference</b> <b>voltage</b> in our study. The consequence of our results is that the worst-case-factors outlined above {{must be taken into account}} and documented in future studies for getting comparable results.

An analogous condition can be formulated for the new challenge: the protection of sensitive electronics against lightning. In this case, the so-called transfer impedance, which gives the <b>interference</b> <b>voltages</b> across a sensitive input per ampere lightning current, must be made small. The arguments for this approach are described. A theoretical description is available and practical experience has been built up over the years, also in high-voltage (HV) research and in power engineering measurements in the field.
