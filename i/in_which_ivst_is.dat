40|$|BACKGROUND: Signs {{of cardiac}} transthyretin (TTR) {{amyloidosis}} (ATTR) {{in patients with}} echocardiographic increase in interventricular septal thickness (<b>IVST)</b> <b>are</b> lacking. OBJECTIVES: To identify clinical and ECG/echocardiographic signs associated with increased IVST in ATTR. METHODS: Analysis of patients with baseline echocardiography in the Transthyretin Amyloidosis Outcomes Survey (THAOS) registry (N= 1682). Patients <b>were</b> categorised into <b>IVST</b> classes according to the American Society of Echocardiography classification adapted to gender (ie, normal, mild, moderate, severe); then into two combined IVST classes (normal-mild and moderate-severe). RESULTS: 425 patients were included: 336 with a TTR mutation (m-TTR) and 89 with wild-type TTR (WT-TTR). 72 % were men. Median (25 th, 75 th centile) age was 62 (45, 72) years. Non-Val 30 Met and WT-TTR were frequent in moderate (41 % and 35 %) and severe (50 % and 33 %) IVST classes. Median <b>IVST</b> <b>was</b> 15 ?mm (14, 16) (moderate) and 20 ?mm (18, 22) (severe). In the combined moderate-severe class, 85 % of patients were ? 55 ?years of age; 81 % were men; 86 % had blood pressure < 140 ?mm?Hg; and 77 % had increased right ventricle thickness (? 7 ?mm). Up to 66 % of patients had cardiac sparkling. Systolic dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction < 50 %), restrictive pattern and low voltage were less frequent, and observed in 49 %, 18 % and 33 % of patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Increased IVST, especially in men ? 55 ?years with normal systolic blood pressure, increase in right ventricle free wall and valve thicknesses, and sparkling, should alert practitioners {{to the possibility of}} ATTR. Absence of restrictive pattern and low voltage should not rule out the suspicion. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT 00628745 (clinicaltrials. gov) ...|$|R
40|$|To asses cardiac {{structure}} and function in athletes, hypertensive patients and healthy sedentary control subjects by Doppler-echocardiographyOne hundred athletes, 45 hypertensive patients and 45 healthy sedentary control subjects volunteered {{to take part in}} the study, cardiac dimensions and function were determined by 2 -D Doppler –echocardiography and were compared by One Way Anova test. There was not any significant relation in interventriculer septal thickness (IVST) between athletes and hypertensive patients (0, 89 ± 0. 11 - 0, 87 ± 0. 15). But there was a significant increase in athletes compared with sedentary subjects (0, 89 ± 0. 11 - 0, 77 ± 0. 14). there was a significant relation in deceleration time (DT) and in ratio of peak mitral velocity to mitral flow velocity at the time of atrial contraction (mEv/mAv) which is important for diastolic function compared three group (patients group has in favour of diastolic dysfunction, the other groups has normal limits of DT and mEv/mAv. Values of DT respectively athletes, patients, sedentary group (154 ± 24, 240 ± 54, 210 ± 39). Values of mEv/mAv respectively athletes, patients, sedentary group (1. 5 ± 0. 2, 1. 1 ± 0. 2, 1. 0 ± 01). Although sedentary subject’s <b>IVST</b> <b>was</b> normal, athletes and hypertensive patients had increased IVST; but these increases did not impair diastolic function of heart also diastolic parameters in sedentary subjects was bigger than athletes...|$|R
40|$|Objective 　To {{illustrate}} {{the relationship between}} abdominal fat accumulation and cardiac remodeling in hypertension patients. Methods 　Visceral fat area (VA) and substantial fat area (SA) were assessed by CT in 380 hypertensive patients (male 198, female 182) with an age range of 21 - 83 years {{during the period of}} Jan 2006 to Dec 2008, and their blood pressure, waist circumference (WC), body mass index (BMI), interventricular septum thickness (<b>IVST)</b> <b>were</b> measured at the same time. The patients were divided into 4 groups according to their VA and WC, namely visceral fat obesity (VFO), pseudo-VFO, masked visceral fat obesity (MVFO), and non-obesity; intra-abdominal fat normal group (VA normal), intra-abdominal fat accumulation group (IFA); interventricular septum thickening group, and normal group. The differences in IVST, SA, VA, VA/ SA, WC and BMI were observed between the groups. Results 　The values of WC, VA, BMI, VA/SA were significantly higher in interventricular septum thickening group than in normal group, while the SA was significantly lower than that in normal group, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0. 05). IVST, WC, BMI, VA and VA/SA were significantly higher in IFA group than in VA normal group, while SA was obviously higher in VA normal group, and showed statistically significant difference (P < 0. 05). <b>IVST</b> and VA <b>were</b> significantly higher in VFO group than in other groups (P < 0. 05), and the VA/SA was significantly lower in VFO group than in MVFO group (P < 0. 05); the IVST and VA in MVFO group were significantly higher than those in pseudo-VFO group and non-obesity group (P < 0. 05). The SA in pseudo-VFO group was significantly higher than that in VFO, MVFO and non-obesity groups (P < 0. 05), however, there was no statistically significant difference in IVST when compared with non-obesity group. Logistic correlation analysis showed VA/SA, VA and WC were the risk factors leading to ventricular septal hypertrophy. Conclusions 　Masked abdominal obesity is significantly related to septal hypertrophy in hypertension, and VA/SA is an important risk factor for ventricular septal hypertrophy...|$|R
40|$|Aim. To {{identify}} possible {{predictors of}} atrial fibrillation (AF) recurrence in 6 -month prophylactic propafenone therapy. Material and methods. Patients (n= 63; aged 52. 2 ± 12. 6 years; 25. 4 % women) with frequent AF recurrences who restored sinus rhythm with propafenone, were included into the study. Paroxysmal AF {{was observed in}} 84. 1 % of patients, and persistent AF — in 15. 9 % of patients. ECG, transthoracic echocardiography, chest radiography with the calculation of cardio-thoracic index (CTI) was performed at baseline. All patients received rpropafenone therapy (450 – 600 mg/day) during 6 months after sinus rhythm conversion. ECG and 24 -hours ECG monitoring were performed in 1, 3 and 6 months of the therapy. Patients with 70 – 100 % reduction in AF recurrence rate were included into the 1 -st group, and patients with 0. 05). Mean age of patients in the group 2 was significantly older than this in patients of the group 1 (p< 0. 05). CTI, left atrium size and volume, interventricular septum thickness (<b>IVST)</b> <b>were</b> significantly larger in group 2. Myocardium mass of the left ventricle (MMLV) after 6 months of therapy was larger by 13. 9 % in patients of the group 2 vs this in patients of the group 1 (p< 0. 05). Conclusion. Insufficient preventive effect of propafenone was observed in 8 %, 11. 5 % and 22 % of patients in 1, 3 and 6 months of the follow-up, respectively. Propafenone prophylactic efficacy was slightly higher in men and younger patients. Patients with poor preventive effect of propafenone had a significantly larger baseline CTI, size and volume of the left atrium, IVST, and MMLV. </p...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Primary {{systemic}} amyloidosis is a severe plasma cell disorder {{characterized by the}} extracellular deposition of amyloid fibrils in different organs. Echocardiography is usually performed to assess cardiac involvement. We hypothesized that in patients with {{systemic amyloidosis}}, simple echocardiographic measurement of the left atrial (LA) diameter indexed to the body surface area might provide an important risk marker for this disease. METHODS: Between 1997 and 2011, 134 patients were diagnosed with primary systemic amyloidosis and had echocardiography within 28 days; we collected their baseline characteristics and biological and echocardiographic data retrospectively. LA enlargement was defined as recommended as M-mode LA diameter greater or equal to 23 mm/m(2). RESULTS: One hundred and eleven patients (83 %) had echocardiographic LA dimension data available (mean age 63 ± 11 years; 61 % men; 31 % previously diagnosed with systemic hypertension). Mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and interventricular septum thickness (<b>IVST)</b> <b>were</b> 62 ± 12 % and 14 ± 4 mm, respectively. Mean follow-up was 2. 8 ± 2. 9 years (maximum 12 years). Patients with LA enlargement had a slightly lower LVEF (P= 0. 08) and a significantly greater IVST (P< 0. 0001). Overall, 5 -year survival was 57 ± 5 %. However, 1 -year and 5 -year survival rates were markedly reduced in patients with LA enlargement versus those without LA enlargement (61 ± 7 % and 39 ± 8 % vs 83 ± 5 % and 72 ± 7 %, respectively; P= 0. 0007). On multivariable analysis, after adjusting for age, sex, LVEF, IVST, presence of hypertension and creatinine concentration, LA enlargement remained an independent predictor of overall mortality at 5 years (hazard ratio 2. 47; 95 % confidence interval 1. 11 - 5. 90; P= 0. 02). CONCLUSION: LA enlargement, {{a surrogate marker of}} diastolic dysfunction, is an independent predictor of long-term mortality and may therefore help to enhance risk stratification and management of patients presenting with amyloidosis...|$|R
40|$|Objective: This {{study was}} {{attempted}} to elucidate {{the role of}} estrogen {{in the process of}} cardiac remodeling and nephrosclerosis in Dahl-S female rats with myocardial infarction. Methods: 48 Dahl-S rats with myocardial infarction (MI) were divided into four groups as follows; Group 1 : MI rats with normal-salt diet (LS, 0. 5 %NaCl diet), Group 2 : MI rats with high-salt diet (HS, 8 %NaCl diet), Group 3 : MI rats with ovariectomy (OVX, 8 %NaCl diet), Group 4 : OVX rats with supplementation of estrogen (EST) (8 %NaCl diet, 17 βestradiol 15 mg/pellet/ 90 days subcutaneous pellet). Myocardial infarction was made by coronary artery ligation. One week after surgery, ovariectomy was performed. After ovariectomy, high salt diet was fed and water was given ad libitum for 12 weeks. During the study, blood pressure (BP), heart rate, body weight, urine volume and urinary excretions of protein and sodium were measured every 2 weeks. Transthoracic echocardiogram (ejection fraction: EF, inter ventricular septal thickness: <b>IVST)</b> <b>was</b> performed under anesthesia at 12 weeks after surgery. At the end of the study, the heart and the kidney tissues were obtained for light microscopic examination and evaluations of the expression of mRNA of ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme) and ecNOS (nitric oxide synthase). Results: 1. Blood pressure in HS group showed a gradual elevation from 132 ＋/－ 8 to 152 ＋/－ 10 mmHg (12 weeks) accompanied with the reduction of EF (LS: 64 ＋/－ 4 % vs. HS: 46 ＋/－ 3 %, P< 0. 01) and increases of IVST. Ovariectomy induced significant reduction in EF (OVX: 26 ＋/－ 3 %, P< 0. 01 vs. HS) and increases in IVST without any significant changes in systemic BP (OVX: 174 ＋/－ 12 mmHg). 2. Ovariectomy induced no significant changes in plasma concentration of ACE, PRA (plasma renin activity), angiotensin I and angiotensin II. 3. In the heart obtained from OVX rats, expression of ecNOS-mRNA was decreased and ACE-mRNA was increased. Ovariectomy induced aggravation of cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. Treatment with estrogen in OVX rats improved EF (EST: 38 ＋/－ 4 %, P< 0. 01 vs. OVX: 26 ＋/－ 3 %) and cardiac hypertrophy, although blood pressure remained at the levels of 168 ＋/－ 8 mmHg. 4. In the heart obtained from EST rats, expression of ecNOS-mRNA was significantly increased and ACE-mRNA was significantly suppressed compared to HS. 5. In HS rats, urinary excretion of protein was increased (182. 2 ＋/－ 40. 2 mg/day). Ovariectomy induced the reduction of urinary excretion of protein (125. 4 ＋/－ 23. 4 mg/day) and estrogen supplementation induced a significant increases of urinary excretion of protein (352. 2 ＋/－ 48. 0 mg/day). 6. Light microscopic findings in the kidney showed glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis in HS rats. Estrogen supplementation induced the aggravation of glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis accompanied with microangiopathy and thrombosis. Conclusion: These data indicate that estrogen might protect the development of cardiac hypertrophy and consuming heart failure. However, estrogen promotes microangiopathy and thrombosis in the kidney with progression of kidney insufficiency in Dahl-S rats with heart failure...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) {{has been}} {{recognized}} as a useful tool to assess regional myocardial function. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the development of heart failure in hypertensive Dahl rats using echocardiography with TDI. Methods: Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) rats were placed on 8 % NaCl diet from 7 weeks old. As an age-matched control, DS rats were consistently placed on normal diet. In these rats, echocardiography was performed successively. We evaluated interventricular septal wall thickness (IVST), left ventricle (LV) posterior wall thickness (LVPWT), LV fractional shortening (%LVFS), LV ejection fraction (LVEF) and early diastolic velocity (peak negative velocity: PNV). Results: Following on the rise of blood pressure (12, 18 and 25 weeks of age), <b>IVST</b> and LVPWT <b>were</b> significantly greater in DS rats fed with high-salt diet compared to control group. PNV at 18 and 25 weeks of age was significantly lower in DS rats fed with high-salt diet than control group. However, there were no significant differences on LVEF and %LVFS, between DS rats fed with high-salt diet and control group. Conclusion: LV diastolic dysfunction preceded LV systolic dysfunction in DS rats with hypertension. Consecutive measurements of the PNV should prove valuable in follow-up of progressive LV diastolic dysfunction secondary to hypertension...|$|R

Left ventricular (LV) internal diameter index (LVID/h), total LV mass (LVM) and LVM index (LVMI), relative wall thickness (RWT), LV ejection fraction (EF) by echocardiography and diastolic parameters by pulsed-wave Doppler were calculated. BMI (p< 0. 0001), WHR (p< 0. 03), triglycerides (p< 0, 001), prevalence of obesity (p< 0. 005), visceral obesity (p< 0. 003), left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) (p< 0. 001), metabolic syndrome (p< 0. 0003) and coronary artery disease (CAD) (p< 0. 003) were significantly increased and HDL-C (p< 0. 001) was significantly reduced in hypo-ADPN than normal-ADPN subjects. LVM, LVMI, <b>IVST</b> and RWT <b>were</b> significantly (p < 0. 0001) higher and LVEF was significantly (p< 0. 0002) lower in hypo-ADPN than normal-ADPN patients. LVMI correlated directly with BMI (p< 0. 001), MBP (p< 0. 001), MetS (p< 0. 001) and inversely with ADPN (p< 0. 0001). The prevalence of LVH (p< 0. 001) and CAD (p< 0. 01) was higher in subjects with normal-ADPN and MetS, while the presence of MetS did not change this finding in hypoADPN group. Both models of regression analysis indicated that ADPN and BMI resulted independently associated with LVMI. In conclusion, our data seem to indicate that hypoadiponectinemia might be associated to increased prevalence both of clinical comorbidites and increased LVMI. In this subset of subjects, ADPN and BMI, more than MetS, are able to explain cardiac damage. Accordingly, ADPN might become a new target in the management of cardiometabolic risk...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} an alternating move price-setting duopoly model <b>in</b> <b>which</b> {{marginal costs}} are stochastic without persistence. It is shown that, provided marginal costs do not fluctuate excessively, equilibria <b>in</b> <b>which</b> firms match the current monopoly price do not exist. By contrast, equilibria <b>in</b> <b>which</b> firms always match their rival along the equilibrium path do exist. In these equilibria, deviations {{off of the}} equilibrium path result in extended price wars, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> firms repeatedly undercut each other. Finally, examples <b>in</b> <b>which</b> such price wars are observed in equilibrium are constructed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model of}} optimal taxation <b>in</b> <b>which</b> both private agents and the government can default on their debt. We first consider Ramsey equilibria <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the government can precommit to its policies but <b>in</b> <b>which</b> private agents can default. We then consider sustainable equilibria <b>in</b> <b>which</b> both government and private agent decision rules are required to be sequentially rational. We show that when there is sufficiently little discounting and government consumption fluctuates enough, the Ramsey allocations and policies (<b>in</b> <b>which</b> the government never defaults) can be supported by a sustainable equilibrium. ...|$|R
2500|$|Forms include {{monopoly}} (<b>in</b> <b>which</b> {{there is}} only one seller of a good), duopoly (<b>in</b> <b>which</b> there are only two sellers of a good), oligopoly (<b>in</b> <b>which</b> there are few sellers of a good), monopolistic competition (<b>in</b> <b>which</b> there are many sellers producing highly differentiated goods), monopsony (<b>in</b> <b>which</b> {{there is only}} one buyer of a good), and oligopsony (<b>in</b> <b>which</b> there are few buyers of a good). Unlike perfect competition, imperfect competition invariably means market power is unequally distributed. Firms under imperfect competition have the potential to be [...] "price makers", which means that, by holding a disproportionately high share of market power, they can influence the prices of their products.|$|R
