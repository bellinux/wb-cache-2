25|$|The <b>differential</b> <b>analyser,</b> a {{mechanical}} analog computer designed to solve differential equations by integration using wheel-and-disc mechanisms, was conceptualized in 1876 by James Thomson, {{the brother of}} the more famous Lord Kelvin. He explored the possible construction of such calculators, but was stymied by the limited output torque of the ball-and-disk integrators. In a differential analyzer, the output of one integrator drove the input of the next integrator, or a graphing output.|$|E
25|$|The <b>differential</b> <b>analyser,</b> a {{mechanical}} analog computer designed to solve differential equations by integration, used wheel-and-disc mechanisms {{to perform the}} integration. In 1876 James Thomson had already discussed the possible construction of such calculators, {{but he had been}} stymied by the limited output torque of the ball-and-disk integrators. In a differential analyzer, the output of one integrator drove the input of the next integrator, or a graphing output. The torque amplifier was the advance that allowed these machines to work. Starting in the 1920s, Vannevar Bush and others developed mechanical differential analyzers.|$|E
30|$|Simulating {{models of}} the {{physical}} world is instrumental in advancing scientific knowledge and developing technologies. Accordingly, the task has long been at the heart of science. For example, orreries have been used for millennia to simulate {{models of the}} motions of celestial objects [1]. More recently, <b>differential</b> <b>analysers</b> or mechanical integrators were developed to solve differential equations modelling e.g. heat flow and transmission lines [2, 3].|$|R
50|$|The ball-and-disk {{integrator}} is a {{key component}} of many advanced mechanical computers. Through simple mechanical means, it performs continual integration of the value of an input. Typical uses were the measurement of area or volume of material in industrial settings, range-keeping systems on ships, and tachometric bombsights. The addition of the torque amplifier by Vannevar Bush led to the <b>differential</b> <b>analysers</b> of the 1930s and 1940s.|$|R

25|$|After 2 or 3 months, Kay and Fran {{were moved}} {{to work on the}} <b>differential</b> <b>analyser</b> in the {{basement}} of the Moore School, the largest and most sophisticated analogue mechanical calculator of the time, of which there were only 3 in the United States and 5 or 6 in the world (all of the others were in Great Britain). The analyser had been lent to the University of Pennsylvania for the duration of the war. Using the analyser (invented by Vannevar Bush of MIT a decade prior and made more precise with improvements by the Moore School staff), a single trajectory computation—about 40 hours of work on a mechanical desk calculator—could be performed in about 50 minutes. Kay was further promoted to supervising calculations on the analyser. The analyser room staff worked six days a week, with their only official holidays as Christmas and the Fourth of July.|$|E

They brought the <b>differential</b> <b>analyser</b> with them to London, where it was destroyed by an air raid during the Second World War.|$|E

He was joined by engineers from several companies, along with [...] "Freddie" [...] Williams, who quickly applied some of the techniques he had used on a <b>differential</b> <b>analyser</b> to produce a system known as the Velodyne that tracked smoothly in spite of hard maneuvering and large crossing speeds by the target. The unit also sent ranging information directly to the gyro gunsight, pre-setting it {{so it could be}} fired as soon as the target was spotted.|$|E

2500|$|The {{angular speed}} of the prism changes with {{the range of the}} target: {{consider}} the reverse situation, the apparent high angular speed of an aircraft passing overhead compared to its apparent speed when it is seen at a longer distance. In order to properly account for this non-linear effect, the Norden used a system of slip-disks similar to those used in <b>differential</b> <b>analysers.</b> However, this slow change at long distances made it difficult to fine-tune the drift early in the bomb run. In practice, bombardiers would often set up their ground speed measurements in advance of approaching the target area by selecting a convenient [...] "target" [...] on the ground that was closer to the bomber and thus had more obvious motion in the sight. These values would then be used as the initial setting when the target was later sighted.|$|R

40|$|A tandem <b>differential</b> {{mobility}} <b>analyser</b> system combining volatilisation and humidification aerosol conditioning {{to allow}} the observation of hygroscopic behaviour for non-volatile residues in sulphate aerosols in real time has been developed and demonstrated. The Volatilisation and Humidification Tandem <b>Differential</b> Mobility <b>Analyser</b> (VH-TDMA) system can measure changes in the hygroscopic behaviour of heterogeneously nucleated aerosol as one or more semi-volatile species are removed through thermal evaporation or decomposition. The VH-TDMA system {{has the potential to}} distinguish between submicrometer particles containing residues of differing volatility and hygroscopic growth and can do so for residue diameters as small as 5 nm. The technique has the potential to distinguish between components such as sea salt and combustion derived particles within submicrometer sulphate aerosols and will find application in marine and combustion aerosol research investigating nucleation, coagulation and secondary aerosol formation processes. Hygroscopic growth and volatility data measured with the system are presented for Di- 2 ethylhexyl-sebacate (DEHS), sodium chloride, ammonium nitrate, ammonium sulphate, sulphuric acid, ammonium bisulphate and methane sulphonic acid, as single aerosol species for comparison with values reported by other authors. Results of investigations of aerosols containing mixtures of two species are also presented...|$|R
40|$|PreprintWe {{consider}} the General Purpose Analog Computer (GPAC), introduced by Claude Shannon in 1941 as {{a mathematical model}} of <b>Differential</b> <b>Analysers,</b> {{that is to say}} as a model of continuous-time analog (mechanical, and later one electronic) machines of that time. The GPAC generates as output univariate functions (i. e. functions f:R→R). In this paper we extend this model by: (i) allowing multivariate functions (i. e. functions f:Rn→Rm); (ii) introducing a notion of amount of resources (space) needed to generate a function, which allows the stratification of GPAC generable functions into proper subclasses. We also prove that a wide class of (continuous and discontinuous) functions can be uniformly approximated over their full domain. We prove a few stability properties of this model, mostly stability by arithmetic operations, composition and ODE solving, taking into account the amount of resources needed to perform each operation. We establish that generable functions are always analytic but that they can nonetheless (uniformly) approximate a wide range of nonanalytic functions. Our model and results extend some of the results from [19] to the multidimensional case, allow one to define classes of functions generated by GPACs which take into account bounded resources, and also strengthen the approximation result from [19] over a compact domain to a uniform approximation result over unbounded domains. info:eu-repo/semantics/acceptedVersio...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} the General Purpose Analog Computer (GPAC), introduced by Claude Shannon in 1941 as {{a mathematical model}} of <b>Differential</b> <b>Analysers,</b> {{that is to say}} as a model of continuous-time analog (mechanical, and later one electronic) machines of that time. We extend the model properly to a model of computation not restricted to univariate functions (i. e. functions f: R→R) but also to the multivariate case of (i. e. functions f: R^n →R^m), and establish some basic properties. In particular, we prove that a very wide class of (continuous and discontinuous) functions can be uniformly approximated over their full domain. Technically: we generalize some known results about the GPAC to the multidimensional case: we extend naturally the notion of generable function, from the unidimensional to the multidimensional case. We prove a few stability properties of this class, mostly stability by arithmetic operations, composition and ODE solving. We establish that generable functions are always analytic. We prove that generable functions include some basic (useful) generable functions, and that we can (uniformly) approximate a wide range of functions this way. This extends some of the results from Sha 41 to the multidimensional case, and this also strengths the approximation result from Sha 41 over a compact domain to a uniform approximation result over unbounded domains. We also discuss the issue of constants, and we prove that involved constants can basically assumed to always be polynomial time computable numbers...|$|R
