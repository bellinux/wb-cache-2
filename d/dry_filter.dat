5000|$|Sedimentation {{operates}} {{by passing}} {{water into a}} large thickener or clarifier. In these devices, the particles settle out of the slurry under the effects of gravity, or centripetal forces. These are limited by the surface chemistry of the particles {{and the size of}} the particles. To aid in the sedimentation process, flocculants and coagulants are added to reduce the repulsive forces between the particles. This repulsive force is due to the double layer formed on the surface of the particles. The flocculants work by binding multiple particles together while the coagulants work by reducing the thickness of the charged layer on the outside of the particle. After thickening, slurry is often stored in ponds or impoundments. Alternatively, it can pumped into a belt press or membrane filter press to recycle process water and create stackable, <b>dry</b> <b>filter</b> cake, or [...] "tailings".|$|E

40|$|Summary: The {{quantification}} of α-foetoprotein in dry blood spots from {{pregnant women}} was evaluated, using a conventional radioimmunoassay (RIA) with a monospecific antibody.

The results obtained show that the blood α-foetoprotein is stable on <b>dry</b> <b>filter</b> spots sent by mail and is stable for up to four weeks at 4, 25 and 37 °C. The analytical method used has a minimal detectable concentration of 10 + 1. 9 international kilo-units/I.

40|$|Abstract Background A simple {{filter paper}} method was {{developed}} for, the {{transport and storage}} of monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) at room temperature or - 20 °C after spotting on filter paper, for subsequent serotyping of outer membrane antigens of N. meningitidis by dot-blot ELISA. Methods Monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) were spotted within a 0. 5 – 1 cm diameter area of Whatman grade 903 paper, which were stored individually at room temperature or at - 20 °C. These MAbs were stored and analyzed after periods of one week, 4 weeks, 12 months, or 13 years {{in the case of}} frozen Mab aliquots, or after 4 weeks at - 20 °C or at room temperature (RT) in the case of Mabs <b>dried</b> on <b>filter</b> paper strips. Assays were performed in parallel using dot-blot ELISA. In addition to the MAbs specific for serotyping class 1, 2 or 3, we used a larger number of Mabs for polysaccharides, lipooligosaccharides (LOS), class 5 and cross-reactive antigens for native outer membrane of N. meningitidis. The Mabs <b>dried</b> on <b>filter</b> paper were eluted with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0. 2 % gelatin. Results Mabs of the isotypes IgG and IgM <b>dried</b> on <b>filter</b> papers were not affected by duration of storage. The detection by serotyping Mabs was generally consistent for <b>dried</b> <b>filter</b> paper MAb samples stored frozen for over 1 year at - 20 °C, and although decreased reactive antibody titers were found after storage, this did not interfere with the specificity of the Mabs used after 13 years as <b>dry</b> spots on <b>filter</b> paper. Conclusion The use of filter paper is an inexpensive and convenient method for collecting, storing, and transporting Mab samples for serotyping studies. In addition, the samples occupy little space and can be readily transported without freezing. The efficiency of using immunoglobulin G (IgG) or M (IgM) eluted was found to be consistent with measurement of IgG or IgM titers in most corresponding, ascites Mabs stored frozen for over 1 year. The application of meningococcal typing methods and designations depend on the question being asked. </p...|$|R
40|$|Measurement of {{soil suction}} is {{important}} as soil suction {{is one of}} the two stress-state variables that control both the hydro and mechanical behaviour of unsaturated soils. One of the soil suction measurement techniques is the filter paper method. Even though the filter paper technique has been standardized, the experimental procedure can still be improved {{in order to reduce the}} inconsistencies that are often reported with the filter paper technique. This paper explores usage of both initially dry and initially moist Whatman No. 42 filter paper for matric and total suction measurements. Residual soils from the Bukit Timah Granite in Singapore were compacted at various water contents from dry to wet of optimum using standard Proctor energies and their suctions were measured using both contact and non-contact filter papers. Results of the suction measurements showed hysteresis between the initially dry and the initially moist filter papers for both the contact and non-contact methods. Suction measurement by the contact filter paper method is more consistent than suction measurement by the non-contact filter paper method. Condensation causes the non-contact filter papers to have higher water contents. The results showed that the non-contact initially <b>dry</b> <b>filter</b> paper follows the total suction curve but the non-contact initially moist filter paper may follow the matric suction curve instead...|$|E

They bear a surface adhesive, a non-volatile oil, which is secreted through the cuticle. The pulvilli are everted by blood pressure and are withdrawn inside the tibia by contraction of the tibial muscles. 2. The adhesion of these organs to various types of surface was tested by covering over the pulvilli or by claw amputation. Pulling forces were applied by progressively loading the aphid with weights. The pulvilli perform best on relatively smooth surfaces. Aphids are dislodged from the underside of polished glass by a mass of approx. 9 - 14 mg (a pulling force of 8 - 8 - 13 - 7 xlO~ 5 N). The claws cannot engage a completely smooth surface but are highly effective on rough ones, withstanding a load of approx. 57 mg on <b>dry</b> <b>filter</b> paper.

40|$|A {{primary means}} to reduce {{environmental}} levels of diesel particulate matter (DPM) exposure to miners {{is to reduce}} the amount of DPM emission from the engine. A quick and economic method to estimate engine particulate emission levels has been developed. The method relies on the measurement of pressure increase across a filter element that is briefly used to collect a DPM sample directly from the engine exhaust. The method has been refined with the inclusion of an annular aqueous denuder to the tube which permits <b>dry</b> <b>filter</b> samples to be obtained without addition of dilution air. Tailpipe filter samples may then be directly collected in hot and water-supersaturated exhaust gas flows from water bath-cooled coal mine engines without the need for dilution air. Measurement of a differential pressure (DP) increase with time has been related to the mass of elemental carbon (EC) on the filter. Results for laboratory and field measurements of the method showed agreement between DP increase and EC collected on the filter with R 2 values 3 ̆e 0. 86. The relative standard deviation from replicate samples of DP and EC was 0. 16 and 0. 11, respectively.

At each house, six to nine 24 -h measurements were carried out, spread over the year and the laying cycle. Upstream and downstream of the systems, we measured PM 10, PM 2. 5, and carbon dioxide concentrations, temperature, and relative humidity. Additional measurements of particle size distribution only were carried out at the DF of another poultry house. The latter showed that removal of PM by the DF increased with increasing particle diameter. Mean removal efficiency of the DF for PM 10 was 40. 1 %, whereas PM 2. 5 was not significantly removed. The ESP reduced concentrations of PM 10 {{by an average of}} 57. 0 % and concentrations of PM 2. 5 by an average of 45. 3 %.

The mean (SD between houses) untreated emissions rate from the non-cage layer houses was 7. 81 (4. 12) mg PM 10 h- 1 bird- 1 and 0. 44 (0. 28) mg PM 2. 5 h- 1 bird- 1.
