40|$|In this paper, {{the problem}} of {{designing}} an advanced sensor validation system (SVS) which is robust and fault-tolerant under faulty conditions is considered. Associative memories, which provide robust pattern recognition are investigated as an information processing technology {{that can be applied}} to sensor validation. Studies of Binary Associative Memories (BAM) and Continuous Associative Memories (CAM) yield many results including (1) the stability condition of exemplars and spurious memories in BAMs, (2) the formula of choosing <b>diagonal</b> weights <b>and</b> <b>bias</b> that eliminates spurious memories most effectively in BAMs, (3) the convergence theory of CAMs that have asymmetric weight matrix with non-zero <b>diagonal</b> elements <b>and</b> non-monotonically increasing activation functions, (4) the energy function that explores the convergence behavior of CAMs, and (5) the hybrid learning algorithm that reduces spurious memories effectively in CAMs. The concept of performability is introduced to the evaluation of SVS. A set of important performability variables is introduced. Stochastic Activity Networks are used as a modeling tool to evaluate the performability of SVS. An illustration example, the evaluation of the pressurizer SVS of a PWR, is provided...|$|R

50|$|After so {{many changes}} in the prior year, it is no {{surprise}} that there were few changes for 1970. Most US makes including Chrysler adopted <b>bias</b> <b>belted</b> tires. They were a short-lived hybrid that combined familiar soft riding bias body plies with tread stabilizing belts used in European style radial tires. One well known brand name at the time was Goodyear’s Polyglas. All 1970 Chryslers featured standard <b>bias</b> <b>belted</b> tires, with Town & Country wagons wearing size J78-15. J identified the second largest size available in load capacity, 78 indicated a cross-section height-to-width, or aspect ratio of 78%, and 15 being the nominal rim diameter in inches, as before.|$|R

50|$|Although {{the overall}} size of 1974 Chryslers was barely {{larger than the}} {{fuselage}} generation that preceded it, weight continued to creep upward.

The 3-seat T&C tipped the scales at just under 5,000 pounds, about 300 pounds heavier than ’72 fuselage generation T&C. With air conditioning, and a typical complement of power assists, the average ’74 T&C weighed about 5,200 pounds. Standard tires were size L78x15 <b>bias</b> <b>belted</b> on size 6.5x15 inch rims.
