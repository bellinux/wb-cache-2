50|$|Thiols. Thiol-containing small {{molecules}} {{are the most}} commonly adopted stabilizers in metal nanoparticle synthesis owing to {{the strong interaction between}} thiols and gold and silver. Glutathione {{has been shown to be}} an excellent stabilizer for synthesizing gold nanoclusters with visible luminescence by reducing Au3+ in the presence of glutathione with sodium borohydride (NaBH4). Also other thiols such as tiopronin, phenylethylthiolate, thiolate α-cyclodextrin and 3-mercaptopropionic acid and bidentate dihydrolipoic acid are other thiolated compounds currently being used in the synthesis of metal nanoclusters. The size as well as the luminescence efficiency of the nanocluster depends sensitively on the thiol-to-metal molar ratio. The higher the ratio, the smaller the nanoclusters. The thiol-stabilized nanoclusters can be produced using strong as well as mild reductants. Thioled metal nanoclusters are mostly produced using the strong reductant sodium borohydride (NaBH4). Gold nanocluster synthesis can also be achieved using a mild reducant tetrakis(hydroxymethyl)phosphonium (THPC). Here a zwitterionic thiolate ligand, <b>D-penicillamine</b> (DPA), is used as the stabilizer. Furthermore, nanoclusters can be produced by etching larger nanoparticles with thiols. Thiols can be used to etch larger nanoparticles stabilized by other capping agents. Dendrimers. Dendrimers are used as templates to synthesize nanoclusters. Gold nanoclusters embedded in poly(amidoamine) dendrimer (PAMAM) have been successfully synthesized. PAMAM is repeatedly branched molecules with different generations. The florescence properties of the nanoclusters are sensitively dependent on the types of dendrimers used as template for the synthesis. Metal nanoclusters embedded in different templates show maximum emission at different wavelengths. The change in florescence property is mainly due to surface modification by the capping agents. Although gold nanoclusters embedded in PAMAM are blue-emitting the spectrum can be tuned from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared (NIR) region and the relative PAMAM/gold concentration and the dendrimer generation can be varied. The green-emitting gold nanoclusters can be synthesized by adding mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA) into the prepared small gold nanoparticle solution. The addition of freshly reduced lipoic acid (DHLA) gold nanoclusters (AuNC@DHLA) become red-emitting fluorophores.|$|E

40|$|Background and Purpose Hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) is a gasotransmitter {{produced}} from l-cysteine through the enzymatic action of cystathionine-γ-lyase (CSE) and/or cystathionine-β-synthase. <b>d-Penicillamine</b> is the d isomer of a dimethylated cysteine {{and has been}} used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. As <b>d-penicillamine</b> is structurally very similar to cysteine, we have investigated whether <b>d-penicillamine,</b> as a cysteine analogue, has an effect on the H 2 S pathway. Experimental Approach We tested the effect of <b>d-penicillamine</b> (0. 01 - 1 mM) in mouse aortic rings mounted in isolated organ baths and determined whether it could affect H 2 S biosynthesis. In particular, we investigated any possible inhibitor or donor behaviour by using recombinant enzyme-based assays and an in vivo approach. Key Results <b>d-Penicillamine,</b> per se, showed little or no vasodilator effect, and it cannot be metabolized as a substrate in place of l-cysteine. However, <b>d-penicillamine</b> significantly reduced l-cysteine-induced vasodilatation in a concentration-dependent manner through inhibition of H 2 S biosynthesis, and this effect occurred at concentrations 10 times lower than those needed to induce the release of H 2 S. In particular, <b>d-penicillamine</b> selectively inhibited CSE in a pyridoxal- 5 ′-phospate-dependent manner. Conclusions and Implications Taken together, our results suggest that <b>d-penicillamine</b> acts as a selective CSE inhibitor, leading to new perspectives in the design and use of specific pharmacological tools for H 2 S research. In addition, the inhibitory effect of <b>d-penicillamine</b> on CSE could account for its beneficial action in rheumatoid arthritis patients, where H 2 S has been shown to have a detrimental effect...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND—Wilson's disease, heralded by severe hepatic insufficiency, {{is a rare}} {{disorder}} {{for which}} emergency liver transplantation {{is considered to be}} the only effective therapy.  AIMS—To report the features of Wilson's disease with severe hepatic insufficiency in a series of 17  patients and, during the second period of the study, to assess the efficacy of a policy consisting of early administration of <b>D-penicillamine.</b>  PATIENTS—Seventeen consecutive patients with Wilson's disease were studied. During the first period of the study (up to 1979), none of the patients received <b>D-penicillamine.</b> During the second period (after 1979), all patients without encephalopathy at admission received <b>D-penicillamine.</b>  RESULTS—The four patients observed during the first period who did not have encephalopathy at admission and did not receive <b>D-penicillamine</b> progressed to encephalopathy and died. Among the 13  consecutive patients observed during the second period, two patients with encephalopathy at admission did not receive <b>D-penicillamine</b> and were transplanted. The 11  remaining patients all received <b>D-penicillamine.</b> Ten of these patients survived without the need for transplantation and returned to compensated liver disease without liver insufficiency.

These results suggest the importance of early diagnosis of this form of Wilson's disease before the onset of encephalopathy, and favour early administration of <b>D-penicillamine</b> which could avoid the need for transplantation in most cases.    Keywords: Wilson's disease; acute liver failure; liver transplantation; hepatic encephalopath...|$|E
