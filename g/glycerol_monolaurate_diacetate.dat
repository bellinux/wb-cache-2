40|$|PURPOSE. We {{sought to}} {{determine}} the relative lipase production {{of a range of}} ocular bacterial isolates and to assess the efficacy of <b>glycerol</b> <b>monolaurate</b> (GML) in inhibiting this lipase production in high lipase-producing bacteria without affecting bacterial cell growth. METHODS. Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Propionibacterium acnes, and Corynebacterium spp. were inoculated at a density of 106 /mL in varying concentrations of GML up to 25 μg/mL for 24 hours at 378 C with constant shaking. Bacterial suspensions were centrifuged, bacterial cell density was determined, and production of bacterial lipase was quantified using a commercial lipase assay kit. RESULTS. Staphylococcus spp. produced high levels of lipase activity compared with P. acnes and Corynebacterium spp. GML inhibited lipase production by Staphylococcal spp. in a dosedependent manner, with S. epidermidis lipase production consistently more sensitive to GML than S. aureus. <b>Glycerol</b> <b>monolaurate</b> showed significant (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) lipase inhibition above concentrations of 15 μg /mL in S. aureus and was not cytotoxic up to 25 μg /mL.

40|$|Genome-wide {{transcriptional}} profiling {{studies of}} the response of Staphylococcus aureus to cell wall-active antibiotics {{have led to the}} discovery of a cell wall stress stimulon of genes induced by these agents. msrA 1, encoding methionine sulfoxide reductase, is a highly induced member gene of this stimulon. In the present study we show that msrA 1 induction by oxacillin is common to all methicillin-susceptible strains studied but did not occur in two homogeneous and two heterogeneous methicillin-resistant strains. However, msrA 1 was induced by vancomycin and/or d-cycloserine in methicillin-resistant strains. Lysozyme and lysostaphin treatment did not induce msrA 1 expression.

Methodology/Principal Findings: Antimicrobial effects of GML and DDG (0 to 500 mg/ml) on 54 clinical isolates of S. aureus, including pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) types USA 200, USA 300, and USA 400, were determined in vitro. A rabbit Wiffle ball infection model assessed GML and DDG (1 mg/ml instilled into the Wiffle ball every other day) effects on S. aureus (MN 8) growth (inoculum 36108 CFU/ml), toxic shock syndrome toxin- 1 (TSST- 1) production, tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) concentrations and mortality over 7 days. DDG (50 and 100 mg/ml) inhibited S. aureus growth in vitro more effectively than GML (p, 0. 01) and was stable to lipase degradation.

Given the highly lipophilic nature of the structure of GML, it is suspected that the surfactant exerts its toxin inhibition effects via interaction with the cell membrane. The present study attempted to characterize some of the potential targets of GML action using the model system of lymphocyte activation. Results from murine splenocytes show that GML stimulates proliferation at concentrations between 10 (- 5) and 5 micrograms/ml/ 5 x 10 (5) splenocytes. At concentrations greater than 5 micrograms/ml, GML inhibited lymphocyte proliferation and blocked the proliferative effects of the lymphocyte mitogens phorbol myristate acetate and concanavalin A and the potent T-cell mitogen toxic shock syndrome toxin- 1. Studies using purified immune cell subsets indicated that GML at a concentration of 0. 1 microgram/ml optimally induced proliferation of T cells but did not affect B cells. At higher concentrations, GML inhibited the toxic shock syndrome toxin- 1 mitogenic effects on T cells, but did not inhibit the lipopolysaccharide-induced stimulation of B cells, suggesting that GML preferentially affects the T-cell population.

Recently, we have described that GML potently suppresses select T cell receptor (TCR) -induced signaling events, leading to reduced human T cell effector functions. However, how soluble host factors present in the blood and at sites of infection affect GML-mediated human T cell suppression is unknown. In this study, we have characterized how human serum albumin (HSA) affects GML-induced inhibition of human T cells. We found that HSA and other serum albumins bind to 12 carbon acyl side chain of GML at low micromolar affinities and restores the TCR-induced formation of LAT, PLC-γ 1, and AKT microclusters at the plasma membrane. Additionally, HSA reverses GML mediated inhibition of AKT phosphorylation and partially restores cytokine production in GML treated cells. Our data reveal that HSA, {{one of the most}} abundant proteins in the human serum and at sites of infections, potently reverses the suppression of human T cells by GML.

Additionally, our previous studies suggest that inhibition of exotoxin production, in absence of ability to kill S. aureus and normal flora lactobacilli, will prevent colonization by pathogenic S. aureus, while not interfering with lactobacilli colonization. These disparate activities may be important in development of novel anti-infective agents that do not alter normal flora. We initiated studies to explore the exotoxin-synthesis-inhibition activity of hemoglobin peptides further to develop potential agents to prevent S. aureus infections. We tested synthesized a-globin chain peptides, synthetic variants of a-globin chain peptides, and two human defensins for ability to inhibit exotoxin production without significantly inhibiting S. aureus growth. All of these peptides were weakly or not inhibitory to bacterial growth.

The differential scanning calorimetry results showed that in the region of up to 33 % water, all water molecules are confined to the hydrophilic core of the reverse micelles, leading to the formation of w/o microemulsion. As the water content increases, the water gains mobility, and transforms into bicontinuous in the region of 33 - 39 % water, and finally the microemulsion become o/w in the region of above 39 % water. The microstructure characterization was confirmed by the dynamic light scattering measurements and freeze-fracture transmission electron microscope observation. The antimicrobial activity assay using kinetics of killing analysis demonstrated that the microemulsions in w/o regions exhibited relatively high antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus due to the antimicrobial oil phase as the continuous phase, while the antimicrobial activity started to decrease when the microemulsions entered the bicontinuous region, and decreased rapidly as the water content increased in the o/w region, {{as a result of the}} dilution of antimicrobial oil droplets in the aqueous continuous phase...|$|R

The Sterne strain of B. anthracis was grown to post-exponential phase with 0 -, 10 -, 15 -, or 20 -μg/ml concentrations of GML and then assayed quantitatively for protective antigen (PA) and lethal factor (LF). After 8 h, GML at concentrations greater than 20 μg/ml was bacteriostatic to growth of the organism.

While GML is generally recognized as safe by the FDA for topical use, its safety for chronic use and effects on normal vaginal microflora in this animal model have not been evaluated. GML was therefore tested both in vitro for its effects on vaginal flora lactobacilli and in vivo as a 5 % gel administered vaginally to monkeys.

However, excipients have not previously been tested in susceptibility models. Methods Excipients commonly used in topical products were formulated in a non-toxic vehicle (the "HEC universal placebo"), or other formulations as specified. Twelve hours after exposure to the excipient or a control treatment, mice were challenged with a vaginal dose of HSV- 2, and three days later were assessed for infection by vaginal lavage culture to assess susceptibility. Results The following excipients markedly increased susceptibility to HSV- 2 after a single exposure: 5 % <b>glycerol</b> <b>monolaurate</b> (GML) formulated in K-Y ® Warming Jelly, 5 % GML as a colloidal suspension in phosphate buffered saline, K-Y Warming Jelly alone, and both of its humectant/solvent ingredients (neat propylene glycol and neat PEG- 8). For excipients formulated in the HEC vehicle, 30 % glycerin significantly increased susceptibility, and a trend toward increased HSV- 2 susceptibility was observed after 10 % glycerin, and 0. 1 % disodium EDTA, but not after 0. 0186 % disodium EDTA. The following excipients did not increase susceptibility: 10 % propylene glycol, 0. 18 %, methylparaben plus 0. 02 % propylparaben, and 1 % benzyl alcohol.

Percent cytotoxicity was defined as the median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of resazurin in cell culture media of cells treated with dilutions of long-chain bases/MFI of resazurin in cell culture media of untreated cells x 100, and the lethal dose 50 (LD 50) was determined from the dose response curve where the 50 percent cytotoxicity intercepts with the long-chain base concentration on the x-axis. For all cells, the LD 50 (mean µM + std err) of sphingosine, dihydrosphingosine, phytosphingosine, and GML were 69. 7 (1. 7), 29. 2 (1. 7), 20. 6 (1. 7), and 134. 3 (1. 7), respectively. Primary oral keratinocytes were more resistant to long chain bases, whereas oral fibroblasts, dendritic cells, and oral squamous cell carcinoma cells were more susceptible. Overall, long chain bases have LD 50 for oral keratinocytes, oral fibroblasts, dendritic cells, and oral squamous cell carcinoma cells that are considerably higher than the minimal inhibitory concentrations for oral pathogens, a finding important to their future potential as therapeutics for prevention or treatment of periodontal disease infections...|$|R

In vitro studies were undertaken to evaluate the effect of GML on the growth of and toxin production by potentially pathogenic bacteria. GML inhibited the growth of clinical isolates of group A, B, F, and G streptococci at concentrations of 10 to 20 micrograms/ml. Exotoxin production, including that of pyrogenic exotoxins and hemolysins, was reduced by concentrations of GML that were below those inhibitory for growth as well as growth inhibitory. The growth of Staphylococcus aureus strains from patients with toxic shock syndrome and scalded skin syndrome was inhibited or delayed in the presence of 100 to 300 micrograms of GML per ml. Growth inhibition by GML could be overcome by the production of lipase. S. aureus elaboration of hemolysin, toxic shock syndrome toxin 1, and exfoliative toxin A was inhibited at GML concentrations below those necessary to inhibit growth. Results similar to those for S. aureus were obtained in tests of S. hominis. Escherichia coli growth and Salmonella minnesota growth were unaffected by GML, but an S. minnesota Re mutant was susceptible to growth-inhibitory activity. Endotoxin release into the medium from E. coli cells was also unaffected by GML, but the release or activity of E. coli hemolysin was increased by GML. Streptococcal pyrogenic endotoxin A production by an E. coli clone was not affectd by GML. These studies indicate that GML is effective in blocking or delaying the production of exotoxins by pathogenic gram-positive bacteria...|$|R

Therefore, dodecylglycerol (DDG), a 12 carbon fatty acid monoether, was compared in vitro and in vivo to GML for {{its effects on}} S. aureus growth, exotoxin production, and stability. Antimicrobial effects of GML and DDG (0 to 500 microg/ml) on 54 clinical isolates of S. aureus, including pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) types USA 200, USA 300, and USA 400, were determined in vitro. A rabbit Wiffle ball infection model assessed GML and DDG (1 mg/ml instilled into the Wiffle ball every other day) effects on S. aureus (MN 8) growth (inoculum 3 x 10 (8) CFU/ml), toxic shock syndrome toxin- 1 (TSST- 1) production, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) concentrations and mortality over 7 days. DDG (50 and 100 microg/ml) inhibited S. aureus growth in vitro more effectively than GML (p< 0. 01) and was stable to lipase degradation. Unlike GML, DDG inhibition of TSST- 1 was dependent on S. aureus growth. GML-treated (4 of 5; 80 %) and DDG-treated rabbits (2 of 5; 40 %) survived after 7 days. Control rabbits (5 of 5; 100 %) succumbed by day 4. GML suppressed TNF-alpha at the infection site on day 7; however, DDG did not (< 10 ng/ml versus 80 ng/ml, respectively). These data suggest that DDG was stable to S. aureus lipase and inhibited S. aureus growth at lower concentrations than GML in vitro. However, in vivo GML was more effective than DDG by reducing mortality, and suppressing TNF-alpha, S. aureus growth and exotoxin production, which may reduce toxic shock syndrome. GML is proposed as a more effective anti-staphylococcal topical anti-infective candidate than DDG, despite its potential degradation by S. aureus lipase...|$|R

We initiated studies with {{four of these}} organisms to develop novel topical antibacterial agents that interfere with growth and exo-toxin production, focusing onmenaquinone analogs. Menadione, 1, 4 -naphthoquinone, and coenzymes Q 1 to Q 3 but not menaquinone, phylloquinone, or coenzyme Q 10 inhibited the growth and {{to a greater extent}} exotoxin production of Staphylo-coccus aureus, Bacillus anthracis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus agalactiae at concentrations of 10 to 200 g/ml. Coenzyme Q 1 reduced the ability of S. aureus to cause toxic shock syndrome in a rabbit model, inhibited the growth of four Gram-negative bacteria, and synergized with another antimicrobial agent, <b>glycerol</b> <b>monolaurate,</b> to inhibit S. aureus growth. The staphylococcal two-component system SrrA/B was shown to be an antibacterial target of coenzyme Q 1. We hypothesize that menaquinone analogs both induce toxic reactive oxygen species and affect bacterial plasmamembranes and biosynthetic ma-chinery to interfere with two-component systems, respiration, andmacromolecular synthesis. These compounds represent a novel class of potential topical therapeutic agents. Gram-positive bacteria cause large numbers of infections;some of these organisms and their toxic products, including Bacillus anthracis and Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxins (SEs), are select agents of bioterrorism. S. aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus agalactiae cause infections which range from relatively benign to life-threatening, such as toxic shock syndrome (TSS) (1 – 7). For example, S. aureus secretes the superantigen TSS toxin 1 (TSST- 1), which is the predominant cause of menstrual TSS and up to 50 % of nonmenstrual TSS (8, 9). Staphylococcal enterotoxin superantigens, notably serotypes B and C, cause the remaining 50 % of nonmenstrual TSS cases.

40|$|Inflammation {{has been}} shown to play a part in the disease {{processes}} of human immunodeficiency virus type- 1 (HIV- 1) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infections. The chemokines CCL 20, CCL 21, and CXCL 13 all play important roles in the immune response and have each been, in some manner, linked to HIV- 1 and SIV infection. Expression of these chemokine genes {{has been shown}} to affect disease state and it is, therefore, important to study the transcriptional regulation of these genes as a possible mechanism of controlling their expression. Transcriptional regulation occurs primarily via the promoter region of a gene. This promoter is the target for binding by transcription factors that can either activate or repress the expression of that specific gene. In this study, the promoter regions of the macaque chemokines CCL 20, CCL 21, and CXCL 13 were analyzed. These promoter regions were characterized via sequence alignments and analyses, as well as by mapping putative transcription factor binding sites. Not only were differences between multiple clones of each chemokine promoter identified, but the homology between the rhesus macaque, cynomolgus macaque, and human promoter regions were explored. By cloning the three promoters into the pGL 2 -Basic vector, a promoterless luciferase expression plasmid, transcriptional control was measured from each promoter via levels of luciferase expression. A dual-luciferase reporter assay was designed and optimized as a method of quantitating transcriptional control from macaque chemokine promoters. After stimulation, an increase in CCL 20 transcriptional levels, but no change in CCL 21 and CXCL 13 transcriptional levels, was observed. Possible methods of inhibiting transcription from the CCL 20 promoter were explored by testing the effects of <b>glycerol</b> <b>monolaurate</b> (GML), (-) -epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), and ethyl gallate (EG) on transcriptional levels. In summary, we have amplified three macaque chemokine promoters, characterized their basal and induced transcriptional control of the luciferase gene, and have identified potential inhibitors of their upregulation. The public health relevance of this study is its ability to potentially pave the way for additional approaches to modulating chemokine expression as a method of combating the inflammation associated with HIV- 1 -driven disease...|$|R

Peterson. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xi, 150 pages, appendices p. 147 - 150. Ill. (some col.) Staphylococcus aureus {{is a major}} human pathogen capable of causing various diseases, from skin infections to life-threatening pneumonia and toxic shock syndrome (TSS). S. aureus exoproteins contribute significantly to S. aureus pathogenesis via causing inflammation, tissue disruption, and immune evasion. Antibiotics treat S. aureus disease by eliminating bacteria, but provide no protection from S. aureus exoproteins, once released. With the emergence of antibiotic-resistant S. aureus, new therapeutic options to treat/prevent S. aureus-associated disease are critical. Given most S. aureus diseases initiate locally on mucosal surfaces or the skin, {{it was hypothesized that}} S. aureus exoproteins that have pro-inflammatory and/or cytotoxic effects on epithelial cells, contributing directly to S. aureus pathogenesis. Therefore, anti-staphylococcal therapies that inhibit toxin production and/or prevent toxin effects on host cells could reduce or prevent S. aureus infections. A global approach was taken to characterize pro-inflammatory properties of exoproteins from two genetically close TSS S. aureus isolates, a pulmonary TSS isolate (MNPE) and a menstrual TSS isolate (CDC 587), on epithelial cells. Cytolysins, alpha- and gamma-toxins, superantigens, and staphopain (protease) were determined as the most pro-inflammatory (via interleukin- 8) to epithelial cells. MNPE, originating from skin, produced large amounts of alpha-toxin and SAgs, but little other virulence factors, whereas CDC 587, a mucosal strain, produced gamma-toxin, small amounts of alpha-toxin, and large numbers of secreted virulence factors. These findings implied that pro-inflammatory S. aureus exoproteins play key roles in environmental selection and disease severity. As proof of principle, <b>glycerol</b> <b>monolaurate</b> (GML), a lauric acid monoester known to inhibit S. aureus exoprotein production and to have anti-inflammatory effects, was compared with its monoether, dodecylglycerol (DDG), as local anti-virulence agents to prevent S. aureus disease using a rabbit wiffleball abscess/TSS model. GML, but not DDG, significantly decreased TSST- 1 and local inflammation (via tumor necrosis factor-alpha in the wiffleball and prevented rabbit death from TSS. In summary, these studies identified key exoproteins important in S. aureus mucosal pathogenesis and determined the potential for anti-toxin agents, such as GML, to treat and/or prevent S. aureus diseases. These studies also suggest the addition of anti-toxin components will improve the effectiveness of antistaphylococcal vaccines and immunotherapies...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. May 2009. Major: Microbiology, Immunology and Cancer Biology. Advisor: Patrick M. Schlievert. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xiii, 177 pages. The vaginal environment {{is comprised of}} stratified squamous epithelium, with intracellular lipids to create a permeability barrier. The vaginal mucosa can be colonized {{by a variety of}} bacteria, including commensal organisms such as lactobacilli and potentially pathogenic organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Both S. aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes secrete toxins known as superantigens that are responsible for causing toxic shock syndrome (TSS). Vaginally, S. aureus can cause menstrual TSS through the production of toxic shock syndrome toxin- 1 (TSST- 1). In this thesis it is demonstrated that another group of bacterial toxins known as cytolysins can augment penetration of superantigens across porcine vaginal epithelium in an ex vivo model. The staphyloccal cytolysin α toxin induced a proinflammatory cytokine response from human vaginal epithelial cells (HVECs), which is thought to enhance permeability of the epithelium thereby allowing TSST- 1 to better traverse the mucosal barrier. The streptococcal cytolysin streptolysin O (SLO), on the other hand, directly damaged the cells of the epithelium, creating holes in the barrier to allow streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A (SPE A) to penetrate. SLO also enhanced penetration of Streptococcus pyogenes across ex vivo porcine vaginal epithelium, whereas α toxin did not enhance S. aureus penetration. Both superantigens are capable of inducing a proinflammatory immune response from HVECs, which is thought to contribute to their penetration of the mucosa and subsequent ability to induce TSS. A dodecapeptide region (12 amino acids) found in all superantigens has been implicated in epithelial interactions. This region is distinct from those residues required for superantigenicity. Alanine mutants were generated along this region for TSST- 1 and SPE A, and mutant toxins were tested for their ability to induce IL- 8 production from HVECs. Multiple toxin mutants led to lower IL- 8 production when incubated with HVECs compared to wild type toxins. All toxin mutants maintained superantigenicity when incubated with peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Select low IL- 8 activity mutants were tested in vivo in two rabbit models of TSS. All toxin mutants but one were lethal IV, whereas most low IL- 8 activity mutants showed delayed progression to TSS when administered vaginally. Two mutants, D 130 A TSST- 1 and K 137 A SPE A, were incapable of causing TSS vaginally. HVECs were further tested for their proinflammatory response to multiple vaginal organisms. While a commensal organism, Lactobacillus, and a latex bead control did not induce IL- 8 from HVECs, potentially pathogenic organisms induced a wide range of IL- 8 responses from the cells. The fatty acid monoester <b>glycerol</b> <b>monolaurate</b> (GML) blocked all IL- 8 responses from HVECs. When incubated simultaneously on HVECs, lactobacilli also blocked all responses to pathogenic organisms. This led to pursuit of a possible anti-inflammatory factor made by lactobacilli. Using transwells, it was shown that Lactobacillus crispatus 01026 secretes a factor responsible for inhibiting the IL- 8 response to TSST- 1. Supernate collected from an overnight culture of L. crispatus also inhibited T cell proliferation due to TSST- 1. Further studies will need to be done to characterize this inhibitory factor. It is possible that both GML and the L. crispatus inhibitory factor will prove to be useful for controlling or preventing inflammatory infections that initiate at the vaginal epithelium...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. June 2009. Major: Microbiology, Immunology and Cancer Biology. Advisor: Patrick M. Schlievert. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xxi, 210 pages. Ill. (some col.) Background. Staphylococcus aureus {{is an important}} gram positive pathogen that causes a multitude of human diseases. Many of these diseases {{are associated with the}} production of staphylococcal exotoxins. Superantigens are a family of staphylococcal exotoxins associated with many of these illnesses. Superantigens are defined by their abilities to induce massive cytokine release from host T cells and antigen presenting cells, leading to the development of toxic shock syndrome (TSS). Superantigens have also been associated with atopic dermatitis, an inflammatory skin disease that often coincides with S. aureus colonization of skin lesions. Superantigen production has been shown to induce corticosteroid resistance in human T cells in vitro (corticosteroids are the most common treatment for atopic dermatitis), thus linking superantigens with more severe cases of atopic dermatitis. Past atopic dermatitis studies have focused on select superantigens. To the best of my knowledge, the work presented in this dissertation represents one of the most comprehensive investigation into superantigens associated with S. aureus strains from patients with atopic dermatitis. Superantigens may be also be involved in staphylococcal pulmonary infections. Recently, several community-associated strains of S. aureus have been linked with severe and often fatal pulmonary diseases. I have found that these strains produce superantigens such as toxic shock syndrome toxin- 1 (TSST- 1), and staphylococcal enterotoxins B (SEB) and C. I hypothesize that superantigens are involved with the severity and fatality associated with these infections (likely by causing TSS). Few treatment options currently exist for preventing staphylococcal toxin production, or neutralizing superantigens in humans. Recent studies have shown exciting evidence that suggests that administration of soluble high affinity T cell receptor subunits (V&# 946;-TCRs) can neutralize superantigen activity in vitro, and are able to neutralize lethality in a rabbit model of TSS. Further investigations would be useful for determining the full range of toxin-mediated diseases these small peptides could be used to treat. Additional research has demonstrated the potential for using <b>glycerol</b> <b>monolaurate</b> (GML) for inhibiting staphylococcal toxin production in vitro. The ability of GML to inhibit toxin production in vivo has not been studied prior to the work presented in this dissertation. GML has also been shown to inhibit the growth of several vaginal pathogens such as Gardnerella vaginalis, and Candida albicans, without inhibiting the grown of Lactobacillus crispatus, which is a predominant member of the vaginal normal flora. This finding suggests that GML may be useful as a treatment for vaginal infections such as bacterial vaginosis and vulvovaginal candidiasis. Methods. PCR was used to determine the superantigen profiles of S. aureus isolates collected from patients with steroid sensitive atopic dermatitis, steroid resistant atopic dermatitis, and vaginal isolates collected from healthy women. In some cases, superantigen production was quantified using Western immunoblots. Antibiotic sensitivity was determined using disk diffusion assays. SCCmec typing for DNA encoding methicillin-resistance was performed using PCR. To investigate the role of superantigens in severe staphylococcal pulmonary diseases, rabbits were challenged, via the intrabronchial route, with live bacteria (USA 200 or USA 400 strains of S. aureus) or purified TSST- 1, SEB, or SEC. Some rabbits were hyperimmunized against TSST- 1, SEB, or SEC prior to challenge, and some rabbits were administered live bacteria or purified SEB plus soluble high affinity V&# 946;-TCRs capable of neutralizing SEB superantigenicity. To investigate the effects of GML on staphylococcal exotoxin production and vaginal inflammation, I initiated a double-blind randomized study in which 225 menstruating women were recruited to donate their own used tampons and then wear study tampons (± GML) on their second day of menstruation for 4 - 6 hours. Tampon samples were screened for the presence of S. aureus, TSST- 1, &# 945;-hemolysin, and interleukin- 8 (IL- 8). To investigate further the in vitro and in vivo effects of GML on vaginal microbes, I initiated a small pilot study {{to determine the effects of}} GML on vaginal Candida sp, Gardnerella vaginalis, and Lactobacillus sp. In this clinical study, women with chronic vulvovaginal candidiasis and/or bacterial vaginosis were recruited to use an intravaginal gel containing 0 %, 0. 5 %, or 5 % GML for 2 days. Swabs of vaginal discharge were collected from the women before and after gel use. Swabs were analyzed for the presence of the microbes of interest, as well as for GML content. Lastly, I investigated severe pulmonary infections caused by USA 300 S. aureus strains by challenging rabbits with live bacteria, or purified superantigen. While conducting these studies, I discovered certain USA 300 isolates produce a variant form of TSST- 1. I used rabbit TSS models, PCR, Southern blots, and superantigenicity assays to begin characterization of the variant form of TSST- 1. TSST- 1 may cause lethality through mechanisms in addition to superantigenicity. I tested for this lethality by first neutralizing superantigen activity with soluble high affinity V&# 946;-TCRs, and then administering TSST- 1 to rabbits. Results and conclusions. S. aureus isolates collected from steroid-resistant atopic dermatitis patients had significantly different superantigen profiles than other isolates. Strains from patients with steroid-resistant atopic dermatitis carried the genes for a greater number of superantigens, were more likely to produce the three major TSS-associated superantigens (TSST- 1, SEB, and SEC), and were also more likely to have uncommon combinations of superantigens, compared to isolates from steroid-sensitive patients and vaginal isolates from healthy women. These findings suggest that S. aureus isolates from patients with steroid-resistant atopic dermatitis are selected for on the basis of greater superantigen production. Although this study focused on isolates collected from steroid-resistant, steroid-sensitive, and from the vaginal mucosa of healthy women, it may also be beneficial to include skin isolates collected from healthy individuals as a control. Both methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MSSA and MRSA, respectively) colonized patients with steroid-resistant atopic dermatitis. While MSSA and MRSA isolates both had unusual superantigen gene combinations, MSSA isolates had a greater number of superantigen genes. From my studies that focused on the role of superantigens in severe pulmonary diseases, I found that rabbits challenged with viable bacteria developed fatal pulmonary infections. Rabbits previously immunized against purified SEC and then challenged with viable bacteria did not develop fatal disease. Rabbits treated with soluble high affinity V&# 946;-TCRs for SEB, and then challenged with purified SEB, also did not develop fatal pulmonary disease. In these studies, immunity to superantigens prevents lethality associated with the pulmonary bacterial exposure. Administration of a soluble high-affinity V&# 946;-TCR to non-immune animals also protected rabbits. Results from in vivo investigations of the effects of tampons containing GML, on both staphylococcal exotoxin production and vaginal inflammation, revealed that lower amounts of S. aureus and exotoxins were detected in study tampons ± GML than the women's own tampons. I also found lower amounts of exotoxins were present in GML+ than GML- study tampons. The chemokine IL- 8 was lower in S. aureus- than S. aureus+ tampons and lower in GML+ than GML- study tampons. Collectively, my studies found that tampons containing GML reduce S. aureus exotoxin production. S. aureus increases production of IL- 8 in the human vagina, and GML reduces production of this pro-inflammatory chemokine. My findings suggest adding GML to tampons may provide additional safety over other tampons relative to menstrual TSS. My investigations into the effects of GML on additional vaginal pathogens demonstrated that in vitro GML concentrations of &# 8805; 100 µg/ml were bactericidal for C. albicans, while concentrations &# 8805; 5 µg/ml were bactericidal for G. vaginalis. In human studies, use of either control (0 % GML) or GML gels (0. 5 and 5 % GML) did not significantly alter vaginal pH or levels of Lactobacillus. Use of gels containing GML significantly reduced vaginal levels of Candida. The control gel did not significantly alter Candida levels. Use of both the control and the GML-containing gels significantly lowered the levels of G. vaginalis. These findings suggest that an intravaginal gel containing GML may be useful for treating both vulvovaginal candidiasis and bacterial vaginosis, meanwhile not inhibiting the growth of Lactobacillus. During our studies to investigate the role of superantigens in pulmonary infections caused by USA 300 S. aureus isolates, I observed that immunity to staphylococcal enterotoxin-like Q (SEl-Q) offers partial (but not statistically significant) protection from lethal pulmonary infection. Further investigation revealed the presence of a variant form of TSST- 1 that contains a large deletion in the tstH gene. This deletion was present in several USA 300 clinical isolates. This deletion was predicted to disrupt the ability of variant TSST- 1 to stimulate T cells via the V&# 946;-TCR because variant TSST- 1 was predicted to be unable to crosslink the MHC II molecule to the V&# 946;-TCR. When tested for superantigen activity, variant TSST- 1 was found to retain some superantigen activity, and is still highly lethal in rabbits. Additional experiments using soluble high affinity V&# 946;-TCRs to neutralize full length TSST- 1 superantigen activity revealed that full length TSST- 1 exposure is still lethal; suggesting that full length TSST- 1 can cause lethality through another mechanism in addition to superantigenicity. My findings suggest that lethality due to full length TSST- 1 exposure may occur through multiple mechanisms, including superantigenicity, and potentially through direct interaction with the central nervous system...|$|R
