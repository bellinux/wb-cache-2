500|$|Music plays a very {{important}} role in all Gatlif's films, such as Latcho Drom and Gadjo dilo, Scott Tobias noted in his review <b>for</b> <b>NPR.</b> Korkoro is no exception: the importance of music is evident from the opening credits in which barbed wire fences vibrate to the tune of plucked strings of a guitar and a cymbalum in line with the opening lines of the screenplay, [...] "the barbed wire sings in the wind", to the oddest tools used to make music, such as the clanking of buckets and wagon wheels.|$|E
500|$|Consequence of Sound's Kevin Barber {{praised the}} track and Mars, since it [...] "showcases his Michael Jackson-esque vocal range" [...] and it's [...] "heavy, heartbreaking lyrics". Ken Tucker <b>for</b> <b>NPR</b> noticed that [...] "It's hard to resist the clever come-on refrain of [...] "Grenade" [...] — [...] "I'd catch a grenade for ya", adding that the song had a [...] "creamy melody". Reviewers, Meredith Whitmore and Adam R. Holz, for Pluggedin, think that [...] "Grenade" [...] is the reverse side of [...] "Just The Way You Are", commenting that the song [...] "ponders what happens when that flower fades and dies". However, Slant's Eric Henderson {{dismissed}} its unrealistic lyrics, while AllMusic's Tim Sendra thought the song was [...] "over-the-top"—one of the weaker ones on the album. Spencer Hawk from Little Village criticized the song by calling it [...] "fairly innovative" [...] and notice that the shouting of the lyrics [...] "doesn’t feel genuine", however he felt that [...] "It’s very safe while being a little risky, and Mars is a solid singer". Music-News.com, reviewer David Spencer, stated [...] "great pop but little in way of surprise".|$|E
500|$|Goldenheart {{received}} widespread acclaim from critics, {{some of whom}} hailed Richard as one of {{the best}} new acts in pop and R At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 81, based on nine reviews. Alex Macpherson of The Guardian gave it five stars and called it [...] "dazzling and imperious" [...] because of how Richard's [...] "array of sonic weapons matches her epic, elemental vision. Jason Gubbels from Spin praised her eclectic music and versatile singing, which he credited for [...] "springing finely placed surprises on listeners lulled into reverie, navigating tricky spots just effortlessly enough to mask her mastery". Writing <b>for</b> <b>NPR,</b> Ann Powers found it altogether contemplative, joyful, and mythological. Jonathan Bogart of The Atlantic wrote that, with her Tolkien-inspired lyrics, Richard [...] "remains true to the oldest and most important standards of R, which, more than any other musical genre, charts the uncountable intricacies of the human heart." [...] Grantland critic Steven Hyden felt that the album blurs R conventions like Frank Ocean's Channel Orange (2012) and Janelle Monáe's The ArchAndroid (2010), while Laurie Tuffrey from The Quietus said Richard distinguishes herself from her R contemporaries with her exceptional creativity.|$|E

500|$|MeTV {{described}} Clair's {{parenting style}} as [...] "firm, yet loving." [...] Writing <b>for</b> <b>NPR,</b> Eric Deggans observed that Clair uses a [...] "loving-yet-sardonic" [...] approach to parenting, demonstrated by her line [...] "I {{was a beautiful}} woman once, before the children came". Considered to be the stricter of the two parents, Clair is humorous and sarcastic about the frustrations and challenges of parenting, often joking about killing or abandoning her children {{but at the same}} time making sure they do not take her exaggerated threats too seriously by demonstrating [...] "obvious loving indulgences". In the pilot, Clair responds to Theo's last minute breakfast request for scrambled eggs after she had already prepared sunny side up eggs for him by using her spatula to [...] "scramble" [...] them. According to The Mommy Myth: The Idealization of Motherhood and How It Has Undermined All Women author Susan Douglas, Clair sometimes makes the mistake of alternating between stern and overindulgent too abruptly. Equally successful in their respective professions, Clair's relationship with Cliff deliberately mirrors the real-life relationship of Cosby and his wife Camille. Clair occasionally raises her voice but seldom yells or loses her temper, demonstrating calmness and a sense of humor as a [...] "remedy for the trials and tribulations of motherhood." ...|$|E
500|$|Bilge Ebiri of the {{magazine}} New York said, [...] "You can't shake the feeling that in a just world, all these women– even Kate Upton– would have better material than this." [...] Connie Ogle of The Miami Herald gave the film {{three out of four}} stars and called the film a [...] "goofy, ridiculous, with more gross-out humor than is strictly necessary but still funny. It falls into the category of Girlfriend Films– as in, go with your girlfriends and leave your date/partner/spouse at home with the PlayStation or the NBA playoffs." [...] Colin Covert of Star Tribune gave the film three out of four stars, saying [...] "It's an escapist women's empowerment comedy like many others, but elevated by the simple virtue of being, for most of its length, very, very funny." [...] Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post gave the film one and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "A movie as generic and forgettable as the sofa-size art on its characters' walls." [...] Linda Holmes wrote <b>for</b> <b>NPR,</b> calling the film [...] "a conceptually odious, stupid-to-the-bone enterprise ..." [...] Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times advised guys to [...] "Step away from the vehicle, because The Other Woman is out of control and intent on running down a certain kind of male." ...|$|E
500|$|Rimsky-Korsakoffee has {{received}} a generally positive reception and is known mostly for its desserts and for offering a unique experience to guests. After noting its status {{as one of the}} oldest coffeehouses in Portland, Fodor's said in a Pacific Northwest guide that it remains [...] "one of the best", specifically complimenting the desserts. In her travelogues of Portland, Rachel Dresbeck noted the coffeehouse's uniqueness and recommended the mocha fudge cake and the ice cream desserts known as [...] "Rasputin's Vice" [...] and [...] "Tsar Sulton Suite". Similarly, Portland Examiner contributor Dominique Dobson called the coffeehouse [...] "whimsical" [...] and wrote, [...] "this is a great evening stopoff for caffeine and dessert. It can sometimes be a bit crowded, but the mocha fudge cake is phenomenal with coffee, and the quirky clientele and (sometimes live) music can keep you lingering over that amazing cheesecake!" [...] In his 2010 Frommer's guide titled Portable Portland, Karl Samson noted the coffeehouse's loyal patrons, calling it [...] "Portland's favorite dessert hangout for more than 25 years." [...] Julian Smith wrote in a 2012 Frommer's guide, Portland Day by Day, that Rimsky-Korsakoffee is the [...] "most atmospheric" [...] of the city's coffee establishments, with [...] "fun and sassy" [...] waiters, desserts [...] "to die for" [...] and bathrooms [...] "you have to see to believe". Ari Shapiro, a journalist and White House correspondent <b>for</b> <b>NPR</b> who has performed with the band Pink Martini, was raised in Portland and worked at Rimsky-Korsakoffee.|$|E

500|$|I. Q. Hunter {{identifies}} a prefabricated cult film style {{which includes}} [...] "deliberately, insulting bad films", [...] "slick exercises in dysfunction and alienation", and mainstream films [...] "that sell themselves as worth obsessing over". [...] Writing <b>for</b> <b>NPR,</b> Scott Tobias states that Don Coscarelli, whose previous films effortlessly attracted cult followings, has drifted into this realm. [...] Tobias criticizes Coscarelli as {{trying too hard}} to appeal to cult audiences and sacrificing internal consistency for calculated quirkiness. [...] Influenced by the successful online hype of The Blair Witch Project (1999), other films have attempted to draw online cult fandom {{with the use of}} prefabricated cult appeal. [...] Snakes on a Plane (2006) is an example that attracted massive attention from curious fans. [...] Uniquely, its cult following preceded the film's release and included speculative parodies of what fans imagined the film might be. [...] This reached the point of convergence culture when fan speculation began to impact on the film's production. [...] Although it was proclaimed a cult film and major game-changer before it was released, it failed to win either mainstream audiences or maintain its cult following. [...] In retrospect, critic Spencer Kornhaber would call it a serendipitous novelty and a footnote to a [...] "more naive era of the Internet". [...] However, it became influential in both marketing and titling. [...] This trend of [...] "instant cult classics" [...] which are hailed yet fail to attain a lasting following is described by Matt Singer, who states that the phrase is an oxymoron.|$|E
500|$|A Love Surreal {{received}} widespread acclaim from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 82, based on 11 reviews. AllMusic's Andy Kellman said Bilal had improved {{as a producer}} and songwriter while remaining [...] "supernaturally skilled and creative" [...] as a vocalist, [...] "swooping, diving, wailing, and sighing, all with complete command." [...] Paste magazine's Evan Rytlewski said [...] "for {{the first time in}} his career, Bilal no longer sounds like an artist with entirely too much to prove; he's just a great singer, backed by great players he puts to good use on a set of sticky, deceptively inventive songs". Writing <b>for</b> <b>NPR,</b> Ann Powers said that A Love Surreal [...] "cultivates the stratospheric vibe" [...] of Coltrane's A Love Supreme while Bilal's ambition is [...] "grounded in fierce intelligence and a commitment to letting stories unfold all the way to their sometimes sorrowful, sometimes orgasmic end." [...] Ken Capobianco of The Boston Globe called it [...] "bracingly good", [...] "compelling music" [...] that allows Bilal's [...] "falsetto to bring the intimate lyrics to life." [...] In The New York Times, Jon Pareles said his [...] "full-fledged" [...] voice [...] "needs no studio aid" [...] on songs that [...] "tease and insinuate" [...] with [...] "meanderings [...] lead somewhere." [...] Pitchfork journalist Jayson Greene was less impressed. He said it was a [...] "joy" [...] to listen to Bilal [...] "warp his voice into improbable shapes", but believed the music lacked any prominent melodies. Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times was more critical of the closing series of slow jams and [...] "atmospheric clutter", while writing that the album's best songs [...] "warrant the increased attention" [...] in Bilal.|$|E

2500|$|In June 2009, National Public Radio (NPR), {{relying on}} {{information}} {{obtained from the}} CIA World Factbook, put the number of Israeli Jews living in settlements in the West Bank and Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem at 250,000. However, a better estimate, based on State Department and Israeli sources put the figure at about 500,000. NPR then issued a correction.
