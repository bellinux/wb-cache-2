[...] In this case, we can say that an asymptotically flat spacetime is one in which the gravitational field, as well as any matter or other fields which may be present, become negligible in magnitude at large distances from some region. [...] In particular, in an asymptotically flat vacuum solution, the gravitational <b>field</b> (<b>curvature)</b> becomes negligible at large distances from the source of the field (typically some isolated massive object such as a star).|$|E

40|$|At {{present it}} remains to address why the fast solar wind is fast and the slow wind is slow. Recently we {{have shown that the}} <b>field</b> line <b>curvature</b> may {{substantially}} influence the wind speed $v$, thereby offering an explanation for the Arge et al. finding that $v$ depends on more than just the flow tube expansion factor. Here we show by extensive numerical examples that the correlation between $v$ and <b>field</b> line <b>curvature</b> is valid for rather general base boundary conditions and for rather general heating functions. Furthermore, the effect of <b>field</b> line <b>curvature</b> is even more pronounced when the proton-alpha particle speed difference is examined. We suggest that any solar wind model has {{to take into account the}} field line shape for any quantitative analysis to be made.

40|$|The superspace {{formulation}} of N= 1 conformal supergravity in four dimensions is demonstrated to be {{equivalent to the}} conventional component field approach based on the superconformal tensor calculus. The detailed correspondence between two approaches is explicitly given for various quantities; superconformal gauge <b>fields,</b> <b>curvatures</b> and curvature constraints, general conformal multiplets and their transformation laws, and so on. In particular, we carefully analyze the curvature constraints leading to the superconformal algebra and also the superconformal gauge fixing leading to Poincare supergravity since they look rather different between two approaches.

40|$|AbstractLiposome {{remodeling}} processes (e. g., vesiculation and tubulation) due to N-BAR domain {{interactions with}} the lipid bilayer are explored with a multi-scale simulation approach. Results from atomistic-level molecular dynamics simulations of membrane binding to the concave face of N-BAR domains are used along with discretized mesoscopic field-theoretic simulations to examine how the spontaneous <b>curvature</b> <b>fields</b> generated by N-BAR domains result in membrane remodeling. It is found that tubulation can be generated by anisotropic N-BAR spontaneous <b>curvature</b> <b>fields,</b> whereas vesiculation is only observed with isotropic N-BAR spontaneous <b>curvature</b> <b>fields</b> at high density. The results of the multi-scale simulations provide insight into recent experimental observations...|$|R

50|$|A 150mm Petzval lens {{was fitted}} to a conical metal Voigtländer camera taking {{circular}} daguerreotypes in 1841. The Voigtländer-Petzval {{was the first}} camera and lens specifically designed to take photographs, instead of being simply a modified artist's camera obscura. The Petzval Portrait was the dominant portrait lens for nearly a century. It had what would now be considered severe <b>field</b> <b>curvature</b> and astigmatism, but It was centrally sharp (about a 20° field of view, or 10° for critical applications), and it quickly drifted out of focus to a soft outer field, producing a pleasant halo effect around the subject. The Petzval Portrait remains popular as a projection lens where the narrow angles involved mean the <b>field</b> <b>curvature</b> is not significant.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} electron pairing in {{the presence}} of the Berry <b>curvature</b> <b>field</b> that ubiquitously exists in ferromagnetic metals with spin-orbit coupling. We show that a sufficiently strong Berry <b>curvature</b> <b>field</b> on the Fermi surface can transform a repulsive interaction between electrons into an attractive one in the p-wave channel. We also reveal a topological possibility for turning an attractive s-wave interaction into one in the p-wave channel, even if the Berry <b>curvature</b> <b>field</b> only exists inside the Fermi surface (circle). We speculate that these novel mechanism might be relevant to the recently discovered ferromagnetic superconductors such as UGe$_{ 2 }$ and URhGe. Comment: 4 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

5000|$|Curvature of Field: The Petzval <b>field</b> <b>curvature</b> {{means that}} the image, instead of lying in a plane, {{actually}} lies on a curved surface, described as hollow or round.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new surface normal smoothing process {{which can be}} used in conjunction with shape-fromshading. Rather than directly smoothing the surface normal vectors, we exert control over their directions by smoothing the <b>field</b> of principal <b>curvature</b> vectors. To do this we develop a topography sensitive smoothing process which overcomes the problems of singularities in the <b>field</b> of principal <b>curvature</b> directions at the locations of umbilics and saddles. The method is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world images...|$|R
5000|$|Most current {{photographic}} lenses {{are designed}} to minimize <b>field</b> <b>curvature,</b> and so effectively have a focal length that increases with ray angle. The Petzval lens is one design which has significant amount of <b>field</b> <b>curvature,</b> images taken with the lens are very sharp in the centre, but at greater angles the image is out of focus. Film cameras, {{may be able to}} bend their image planes to compensate, particularly when the lens is fixed and known. This also includes plate film, which could still be bent slightly. Digital sensors are difficult to bend, although experimental products have been produced. [...] By 2016 the only consumer cameras featuring curved sensors were [...] "selfie" [...] Sony Cybershot KW-1 and KW-11. Large mosaics of sensors (necessary anyway due to limited chip sizes) can be shaped to simulate a bend over larger scales.|$|E
50|$|While {{in general}} digital cameras use a flat sensor, Sony prototyped a curved sensor in 2014 to reduce/eliminate Petzval <b>field</b> <b>curvature</b> that occurs {{with a flat}} sensor. Use of a curved sensor allows a shorter and smaller {{diameter}} of the lens with reduced elements and components with greater aperture and reduced light fall-off {{at the edge of}} the photo.|$|E
50|$|Due to Petzval <b>field</b> <b>curvature,</b> {{the film}} plane upon which a lens focuses {{may not be}} a literal plane. Cameras may bend the film stock or even plate stock {{slightly}} to compensate, improving the area of critical focus and sharpness. Nevertheless, the general concept of a focal plane is understood to refer to this position in the camera sensor relative to the lens.|$|E

Trap loading could be accomplished by constructing a nested series of traps, and compressing atom clouds from larger traps into smaller ones. In the smallest magnetic microtraps the motional ground-state energy of atoms in the trap can exceed the recoil energy from resonant photons, which may allow direct laser cooling to the trap ground state. If a number of atoms can be simultaneously cooled to the ground state, the resulting "Bose clusters" should exhibit interesting optical behavior, since their spatial extent would be less than the resonant light wavelength...|$|R
