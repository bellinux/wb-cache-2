This method, which is applied on huge investments in LNG infrastructure, overstates project profitability and may lead to overinvestment. Since <b>financial</b> <b>leasing</b> payments are contractual and deterministic, a separate cash flow valuation is called for, with a lower discount rate for <b>financial</b> <b>leasing</b> costs.
