40|$|The {{ability to}} group {{dissimilar}} stimuli into categories {{on the basis}} of common stimulus relations (stimulus equivalence) or common functional relations (functional equivalence) has been convincingly demonstrated in verbally competent subjects. However, there are investigations with verbally limited humans and with nonhuman animals that suggest that the formation and use of classification schemes based on equivalence does not depend on linguistic skills. The present investigation documented the ability of two California sea lions to classify stimuli into <b>functional</b> <b>classes</b> using a simple discrimination reversal procedure. Following the formation of <b>functional</b> <b>classes</b> in this context, the second experiment showed transfer of the relations that emerged between class members to a matching-to-sample procedure. The third experiment demonstrated that the <b>functional</b> <b>classes</b> could be expanded through traditionally defined equivalence relations. In these three experiments, appropriate within-class responding produced class-specific food reinforcers. Experiment 3 addressed the role of these reinforcers in equivalence classification and showed that the class-specific reinforcers were sufficient to relate new stimuli to the <b>functional</b> <b>classes.</b> These findings show that sea lions can form equivalence classes in simple and conditional discrimination procedures, and that class-specific reinforcers can become equivalence class members...|$|R

Genes without clear homo-logue in Saccharomyces cerevisiae appeared to be conserved in several species, suggesting that they were recently lost by S. cerevisiae. They often identified well-known species-specific traits. Cases of gene acquisition through horizontal transfer appeared to occur very rarely if at all. All identified genes were ascribed to <b>functional</b> <b>classes.</b> <b>Functional</b> <b>classes</b> were differently represented among species.

40|$|The {{goals of}} this study are to {{determine}} how to advance from present capabilities of underwater glider (and hybrid motorglider) technology to what could be possible within the next few years; and to identify critical research issues that must be resolved to make such advancements possible. These goals were pursued by merging archival flight data with numerical model results and system spreadsheet analysis to extrapolate from the present state-of-the–art in underwater (UW) gliders to potential future technology levels. Using existing underwater gliders (legacy gliders) as calibration, this merger approach was applied to six basic glider types that were conceived to satisfy the requirements of five <b>functional</b> <b>classes.</b> <b>Functional</b> <b>classes</b> were posed based on an evaluation of the attributes and limitations of underwater gliders {{in the context of a}} broad range of potential Navy needs in the littoral and deep-water regimes.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the role of common motor {{responses}} as the “speaker” behavior on stimulus class formation, and the emergence of <b>functional</b> <b>classes.</b> Experiment 1 examined whether training one motor response to a set of three stimuli and a second motor response to another set of three stimuli would result in correct category-sort responses for 5 typically developing preschool children. Three of the children passed the categorization tests. Experiment 2 examined whether the classes formed in Experiment 1 were <b>functional</b> <b>classes,</b> and whether participants who did not pass categorization tests in Experiment 1 would do so following common vocal tact training. The 2 participants who failed categorization tests in Experiment 1 passed these tests in Experiment 2, although none of the participants passed the tests for <b>functional</b> <b>classes.</b> The results of the current study did not unequivocally support the naming hypothesis. Future research should therefore evaluate other possible sources of control that aid in stimulus categorization...|$|R
40|$|The {{number of}} {{distinct}} <b>functional</b> <b>classes</b> of single-stranded RNAs (ssRNAs) {{and the number}} of sequences representing them are substantial and continue to increase. Organizing this data in an evolutionary context is essential, yet traditional comparative sequence analyses require that homologous sites can be identified. This prevents comparative analysis between sequences of different <b>functional</b> <b>classes</b> that share no site-to-site sequence similarity. Analysis within a single evolutionary lineage also limits evolutionary inference because shared ancestry confounds properties of molecular structure and function that are historically contingent with those that are imposed for biophysical reasons. Here, we apply a method of comparative analysis to ssRNAs that is not restricted to homologous sequences, and therefore enables comparison between distantly related or unrelated sequences, minimizing the effects of shared ancestry. This method is based on statistical similarities in nucleotide base composition among different <b>functional</b> <b>classes</b> of ssRNAs. In order to denote base composition unambiguously, we have calculated the fraction G+A and G+U content, in addition to the more commonly used fraction G+C content. These three parameters define RNA composition space, which we have visualized using interactive graphics software. We have examined the distribution of nucleotide composition from 15 distinct <b>functional</b> <b>classes</b> of ssRNAs from organisms spanning the universal phylogenetic tree and artificial ribozymes evolved in vitro. Surprisingly, these distributions are biased consistently in G+A and G+U content, both within and between <b>functional</b> <b>classes,</b> regardless of the more variable G+C content. Additionally, an analysis of the base composition of secondary structural elements indicates that paired and unpaired nucleotides, known to have different evolutionary rates, also have significantly different compositional biases. These universal compositional biases observed among ssRNAs sharing little or no sequence similarity suggest, contrary to current understanding, that base composition biases constitute a convergent adaptation among a wide variety of molecular functions...|$|R
