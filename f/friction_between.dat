5|$|In 916 Emperor Taizu (Abaoji) officially {{designated}} {{his eldest}} son, Yelü Bei, as his successor. Succession by primogeniture was a long-held standard in Chinese culture {{but was not}} accepted among the Khitans, creating a <b>friction</b> <b>between</b> Taizu's desires and the beliefs of the Khitan elites, including Taizu's wife, Empress Shulü Ping. Taizu, sensing {{the possibility that the}} succession process would run into difficulty, forced the Khitan leadership to swear allegiance to Yelü Bei after he was installed as heir apparent. To the Khitans, this was considered a radical move. This <b>friction</b> <b>between</b> primogeniture and succession by the strongest candidate would lead to repeated succession crises, the first of which occurred after Taizu's sudden and unexpected death in 926.|$|E
5|$|Peggy resumes {{her plan}} {{to run for}} council in 2010, but is furious to {{discover}} that Pat is also running. The storyline introduces the character of Harvey Freeman, played by Martin Jarvis, a freelance journalist who is reporting on the election. Harvey is a potential love interest for both Peggy and Pat, and causes <b>friction</b> <b>between</b> the friends.|$|E
5|$|The {{magnitude}} of winds offshore are {{nearly double the}} wind speed observed onshore. This is attributed to the differences in <b>friction</b> <b>between</b> land masses and offshore waters. Sometimes, there are even directional differences, particularly if local sea breezes change the wind on shore during daylight hours.|$|E

5|$|Acadia's border was not {{formally}} demarcated by the Treaty of Utrecht, {{which became a}} cause of ongoing <b>friction</b> <b>between</b> the British and French, especially on the Isthmus of Chignecto, which both sides eventually fortified. The French interpreted the phrase ancient boundaries to imply only the peninsula of present-day Nova Scotia, thereby excluding the mainland between New England and the St. Lawrence, ÎLe St. Jean, and Cape Breton. This helped the Amerindians of Abenaquis, Malecites, and MicMacs to retain their sovereignty over their old hunting grounds.|$|E
5|$|As {{the revolutionary}} {{disturbances}} in, and <b>friction</b> <b>between,</b> Haiti and the Dominican Republic continued apace, De Soto {{returned to the}} West Indies in June, arriving at Port-au-Prince on the 19th. The steamer also patrolled in the Gulf of Mexico, {{with an eye on}} the unsettled conditions in Mexico, where a guerrilla war raged against the French occupation of the country. De Soto remained in the region {{through the rest of the}} year before returning to Hampton Roads in the spring of 1867.|$|E
5|$|David Ogden Stiers as Cogsworth – Majordomo, {{the head}} of the {{household}} staff and Lumière's best friend, who has been transformed into a clock. He is extremely loyal to the Beast so as to save himself and anyone else any trouble, often leading to <b>friction</b> <b>between</b> himself and Lumière. Will Finn served as the supervising animator for Cogsworth. Stiers also narrates the prologue.|$|E
50|$|His work on {{the role}} of {{frictions}} in financial markets has shown how initially small shocks can lead to large fluctuations because of the feedback effects between the destruction of relationships of lending institutions and their clients and the amount that investors want to provide to these lending institutions. His research on financial markets also looks at the effects that changes in the interest rate by the central bank has on the economy. His recent work shows both empirically and theoretically that <b>frictions</b> <b>between</b> banks and consumers may actually be more important for economic fluctuations than <b>frictions</b> <b>between</b> banks and firms.|$|R

5|$|In human anatomy, a bursa {{is a small}} pouch {{filled with}} {{synovial}} fluid. Its purpose is to reduce <b>friction</b> <b>between</b> adjacent structures. The prepatellar bursa {{is one of several}} bursae of the knee joint, and is located between the patella and the skin. Prepatellar bursitis is an inflammation of this bursa. Bursae are readily inflamed when irritated, as their walls are very thin. Along with the pes anserine bursa, the prepatellar bursa {{is one of the most}} common bursae to cause knee pain when inflamed.|$|E
40|$|I {{develop a}} novel {{view of the}} trade <b>frictions</b> <b>between</b> rich and poor {{countries}} by arguing that to reconcile bilateral trade volumes and price data within a standard gravity model, the trade <b>frictions</b> <b>between</b> rich and poor countries must be systematically asymmetric, with poor countries facing higher costs to export relative to rich countries. I provide a method to model these asymmetries and demonstrate the merits of my approach relative to alternatives in the trade literature. I then argue that these trade frictions are quantitatively important to understanding the large differences in standards of living and total factor productivity across countries.

5|$|In public, Alexandra was dignified and charming; in private, affectionate and jolly. She enjoyed {{many social}} activities, {{including}} dancing and ice-skating, {{and was an}} expert horsewoman and tandem driver. She also enjoyed hunting, {{to the dismay of}} Queen Victoria, who asked her to stop, but without success. Even after the birth of her first child, she continued to socialise much as before, which led to some <b>friction</b> <b>between</b> the queen and the young couple, exacerbated by Alexandra's loathing of Prussians and the queen's partiality towards them.|$|E
5|$|Palmer {{gained an}} anti-settler {{reputation}} among immigrants, newspapers and officials, {{who said he}} acted too favorably toward the Indians, even though he moved the tribes to reservations outside the Willamette Valley, seeking to avoid <b>friction</b> <b>between</b> settlers and natives by physical distance. In late 1855, while moving the Rogue River tribes to the Grand Ronde Reservation, violent resistance was threatened by settlers who felt the land should not {{be given to the}} tribes. Palmer succeeded, but the territorial legislature petitioned for his removal from office, which became effective in 1857.|$|E
5|$|The Crusaders and Chiefs rivalry {{has only}} existed recently. In 2012 and 2013 the Chiefs {{defeated}} the Crusaders in the semi-final, 20-17 and 20-19 respectively. All matches {{between the two}} sides are characterised by high intensity matches and altercations throughout. The Chiefs have identified and recruited large amounts of talent from traditional Crusaders territory, causing more <b>friction</b> <b>between</b> the fan bases. In the 2017 semi-final, the Crusaders repaid the Chiefs in kind, defeating the Chiefs 27-13.|$|E

40|$|This essay {{explores the}} paradox of activists using corporate-owned platforms—the ‘master’s tools’ (Lorde, 1984) —in {{the context of the}} Occupy Wall Street movement. Grounded in {{findings}} from interviews with 30 women activists from eight North American Occupy sites, this essay reveals the frictions that result from the entangled paradox between philosophies embedded within technologies and activists’ philosophies. We document entanglements between corporate platforms and radical democratic ideals, and subsequent <b>frictions</b> <b>between</b> activists’ ideals and more pragmatic, DIY practices. We also investigate <b>frictions</b> <b>between</b> aspirations of openness, and the realities of surveillance and infiltration by the police state. We examine entanglements through the theoretical lenses of ‘connective labor’ (Boler et al, 2014), ‘veillance’ (Mann, 2004), and the ‘master’s tools’ (Lorde, 1984), and lay the groundwork for ‘queering the binary of individuals and groups’ (Barad, 2012) and recognising the non-linear, dynamic relations of social movements. ...|$|R
5|$|The {{arrival of}} Ronaldinho in 2003, and Barcelona's {{subsequent}} success in La Liga and Champions League, {{has been seen}} as crucial to an increase in the national, and worldwide, fan-base of the club.

5|$|The {{combined}} {{center of}} mass does move slightly to the left when the rider leans to the right relative to the bike, and the bike leans to the left in response. The action, in space, would have the tires move right, but this is prevented by <b>friction</b> <b>between</b> the tires and the ground, and thus pushes the combined {{center of mass}} left. This is a small effect, however, {{as evidenced by the}} difficulty most people have in balancing a bike by this method alone.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} of Nicholas Altomanović's lands created <b>friction</b> <b>between</b> Tvrtko and George of Zeta, since the latter seized coastal župas which Tvrtko {{had expected to}} annex. In early 1377, Tvrtko successfully plotted with the Travunians the takeover of Trebinje, Konavli, and Dračevica, making his final conquests of the Serbian lands. By that time, Serbia {{had been reduced to}} a patchwork of independent lordships.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, the {{relative}} motions for the toroidal drive are analysed. The sliding factors between {{the planet and}} the stator or the worm are given. The <b>friction</b> coefficients <b>between</b> the planet and the stator or the worm under asperity contact or hydrodynamic lubrica-tion are presented. The <b>friction</b> coefficients <b>between</b> the planet and the stator or the worm under partial hydrodynamic lubrication are also given. Changes of the sliding factors between the planet and the stator or the worm along with drive parameters are presented. The <b>friction</b> coef-ficients <b>between</b> the planet and the stator or the worm under hydrodynamic lubrication are compared, and the changes of them along with drive parameters are discussed. Under asperity contact, the changes of the <b>friction</b> coefficient <b>between</b> the planet and the stator along with the drive parameters are given as well. Under partial hydrodynamic lubrication, the changes of the <b>friction</b> coefficient <b>between</b> the planet and the stator along with {{the ratio of the}} film thickness to mean standard deviations of the height distributions for two teeth are also discussed. These results can be used for friction design of the toroidal drive...|$|R

5|$|The keenest socialist {{among the}} Fasci leaders was Garibaldi Bosco. In August 1892 he {{attended}} the Socialist party’s congress at Genoa and on his return obediently purged his fascio of its anarchist and other non-socialist members. His ideal of a united democratic front was shared by the father of Sicilian socialism, Napoleone Colajanni. The leader in Catania, De Felice, also maintained contact with leading anarchists like Amilcare Cipriani. On these and other important issues there was much <b>friction</b> <b>between</b> Catania and Palermo.|$|E
5|$|To man his signals units, Simpson {{sought to}} obtain some 4,000 Australian Women's Army Service (AWAS) personnel. Two special signal {{training}} battalions were activated to cater for them, and Simpson inspected the 2nd Signal Training Battalion (AWAS) at Ivanhoe Grammar School with Lieutenant Colonel Sybil Irving on 6 July 1942. By 1945, the Australian Corps of Signals numbered some 25,000 men and women. The {{large numbers of}} women serving in Signals units caused <b>friction</b> <b>between</b> Irving and Simpson over what degree of control he exercised over them.|$|E
