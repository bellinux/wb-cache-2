40|$|We {{present a}} new {{approach}} for recognition of complex graphic symbols in technical documents. Graphic symbol recognition is a well known challenge {{in the field of}} document image analysis and is at heart of most <b>graphic</b> <b>recognition</b> systems. Our method uses structural approach for symbol representation and statistical classifier for symbol recognition. In our system we represent symbols by their graph based signatures: a graphic symbol is vectorized and is converted to an attributed relational graph, which is used for computing a feature vector for the symbol. This signature corresponds to geometry and topology of the symbol. We learn a Bayesian network to encode joint probability distribution of symbol signatures and use it in a supervised learning scenario for graphic symbol recognition. We have evaluated our method on synthetically deformed and degraded images of presegmented 2 D architectural and electronic symbols from GREC databases and have obtained encouraging recognition rates. 1.

40|$|International audienceThe {{choice of}} a {{relevant}} colour space is a crucial step when dealing with image processing tasks (segmentation, <b>graphic</b> <b>recognition</b> [...] .). From this fact, we address in a generic way the following question: What is the best representation space for a computational task on a given image? In this article, a colour space selection system is proposed. From a RGB image, each pixel is projected into a vector composed of 25 colour primaries. This vector is then reduced to a Hybrid Colour Space {{made up of the}} three most significant colour primaries. Hence, the paradigm is based on two principles, feature selection methods and the assessment of a representation model. The quality of a colour space is evaluated according to its capability to make colour homogenous and consequently to increase the data separability. Our framework brings an answer about the {{choice of a}} meaningful representation space dedicated to image processing applications which rely on colour information. Standard colour spaces are not well designed to process specific images (ie. Medical images, image of documents) so a real need has come up for a dedicated colour mode...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Graphics</b> <b>recognition</b> for {{raster-based}} input discovers primitives such as lines, arrowheads, and circles. This paper {{focuses on}} <b>graphics</b> <b>recognition</b> of figures in vector-based PDF documents. The first stage consists of extracting the graphic and text primitives corresponding to figures.

The second stage consists of discovering simple graphics entities which we call graphemes, e. g., a pair of primitive graphic objects satisfying certain geometric constraints. The third stage uses machine learning to classify figures using grapheme statistics as attributes. A boosting-based learner (LogitBoost in the Weka toolkit) was able to achieve 100 % classification accuracy in hold-out-one training/testing using 16 grapheme types extracted from 36 figures from BioMed Central journal research papers.

40|$|Abstract. Historical maps contain rich cartographic {{information}}, such as road networks, {{but this}} information is “locked ” in images and inaccessible to a geographic information system (GIS). Manual map digitization requires intensive user effort and cannot handle {{a large number of}} maps. Previous approaches for automatic map processing generally require expert knowledge in order to fine-tune parameters of the applied <b>graphics</b> <b>recognition</b> techniques and thus are not readily usable for non-expert users. This paper presents an efficient and effective <b>graphics</b> <b>recognition</b> technique that employs interactive user intervention procedures for processing historical raster maps with limited graphical quality. The interactive procedures are performed on color-segmented preprocessing results and are based on straightforward user training processes, which minimize the required user effort for map digitization. This <b>graphics</b> <b>recognition</b> technique eliminates the need for expert users in digitizing map images and provides opportunities to derive unique data for spatiotemporal research by facilitating timeconsuming map digitization efforts. The described technique generated accurate road vector data from a historical map image and reduced the time for manual map digitization by 38 %...|$|R
