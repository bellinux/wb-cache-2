40|$|The {{application}} of vapour-liquid equilibria-based separation alternatives can be extraordinarily complicated {{for the treatment}} of process wastewaters containing heterogeneous-azeotropic. Despite dissimilar successfully tested methods for separation, there is possibility to get better distillation method by enabling the separation of more and more specific process wastewater. <b>Extractive</b> heterogeneous-azeotropic <b>distillation</b> (EHAD) is a new advance in treatment of fine chemical wastewater showing special features to cope with the treatment of highly non-ideal mixtures. This method combines the worth of heterogeneous-azeotropic and <b>extractive</b> <b>distillations</b> in one apparatus without addition of any extra materials. The study of the separations of ternary component process wastewater from the fine chemical industry shows both in the modelled and experimental results that EHAD can be successfully applied. The measured and modelled compositions at extreme purities, that is, close to 0 % or 100 %, can be different because of the inaccuracies of the modelling. This highlights the paramount importance of the experiments if special extra-fine chemicals with almost no impurities, e. g. of pharmacopoeial quality are to be produced by special distillation technique.

25|$|<b>Extractive</b> <b>distillation</b> {{is similar}} to {{azeotropic}} distillation, except {{in this case the}} entrainer is less volatile than any of the azeotrope's constituents. For example, the azeotrope of 20% acetone with 80% chloroform can be broken by adding water and distilling the result. The water forms a separate layer in which the acetone preferentially dissolves. The result is that the distillate is richer in chloroform than the original azeotrope.|$|E

40|$|In the {{chemical}} industry, distillation is generally the preferred technique to separate a liquid mixture. However some liquid mixtures such as azeotropic mixtures, close-boiling hydrocarbons, and various isomers {{are difficult to}} separate by simple distillation. For the separation of these mixtures normally techniques like <b>extractive</b> or azeotropic <b>distillation</b> and liquid-liquid extraction are used. The relatively high energy consumption for these processes has encouraged the development of new, less energy-consuming separation processes such as pervaporation.

40|$|Separation of {{azeotropic}} mixtures is a {{topic of}} great practical and industrial interest. Most liquid mixtures of organic components form nonideal systems. The presence of some specific groups, particularly polar groups (oxygen, nitrogen, chlorine and fluorine), often results {{in the formation of}} azeotropes. Azeotropic mixtures may often be effectively separated by distillation by adding a liquid material (entrainer) to the system. For the development of separation processes for azeotropic mixtures, {{there is a need for}} insight into the fundamental phenomena of nonideal and azeotropic phase equilibria. This thesis includes a detailed survey on azeotropic phase equilibriumdiagrams of ernarymixtures. Diagram analysis is shown to be an efficient tool for prediction of feasible separations. As a simplifying concept it is proposed that all feasible structures of ternary azeotropic phase equilibrium diagrams can be qualitatively represented by a few elementary cells of which only four have so far been reported to exist. This greatly reduces the complexity of azeotropic istillation analysis and is a key to a simple evaluation of the possibilities and limitations of azeotropic mixtures separation. Insights gained from continuous azeotropic distillation is extended to the operation of batch distillation with focus on the dynamics and control of multivessel and <b>extractive</b> batch <b>distillation</b> as processes for separating azeotropic mixtures. Practical implications of this renewed insight for the fine- and specialty chemical industries are given in the concluding pages of the thesis. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R
40|$|Azeotropic {{separation}} {{technologies have}} been classified broadly into two major categories, i. e., distillation and membrane processes. Because normal distillation has limitations for azeotropic mixtures, enhancements {{have been proposed}} that either introduce a third component serving as an entrainer in <b>extractive</b> and azeotropic <b>distillation</b> processes or apply a pressure swing distillation system. Among the membrane processes, pervaporation {{was reported to be}} most promising for azeotropic separations. More recently, an approach known as process intensification has been proposed for combining multiple processes into single units such as a dividing wall distillation column or exploiting sonication phenomena to break an azeotrope in an ultrasonic distillation system. This article reviews the state-of-the-art technologies covering all the separation techniques mentioned here. Existing techniques are appraised, and technology gaps are identified. Based on these insights, areas for further development are suggested, aiming at satisfying the process objectives by inherently safer, environmentally benign and economically more attractive techniques...|$|R

40|$|Azeotropes, or close-boiling {{mixtures}} often preclude conventional distillation as {{a method}} of separation. Instead, <b>extractive</b> or azeotropic <b>distillations</b> are commonly used to separate close or azeotropic boiling mixtures. For the design of these separation units, selecting suitable solvents is an indispensable step. The traditional method for solving this problem is through experimentation which is time-consuming and expensive. A new approach is offered by combining heuristic knowledge and numerical methods for solvent screening {{in the form of a}} knowledge-based expert system. The prototype expert system takes as inputs a small amount of physico-chemical property data for pure components and mixtures, and the processes which are suitable for the separation of a close boiling or an azeotropic mixture are selected. Then the expert system proposes solvents from the solvent databases based on the requirements of the process under consideration. The heuristic knowledge and numerical knowledge from different sources for selecting solvents for mass-based separation are organized through ac task-oriented framework as the representing strategy. The structured heuristic search hierarchy has been developed as the problem-solving strategy that an expert follows. At present, the prototype expert system is limited to the preliminary selection of promising solvents fo...|$|R
40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this thesis is to study the optimal configuration. design and operating policy of batch distillation processes in different separation scenarios. In so doing, this work also aims to provide conceptual insights and compare {{the performance of the}} traditional regular column against unconventional columns. In {{the first part of the}} thesis, the optimal operation of <b>extractive</b> batch <b>distillation</b> is investigated. A rigorous dynamic optimisation approach based on a detailed model is employed. In addition to the regular column, the optimal operation of the process in the unconventional middle vessel column is examined. The liquid and vapour stream configurations at the middle section of the column is explored for the first time, resulting in improved process performance. The performance of both columns are compared and the results show how their relative performances are affected by different feed compositions. The second part of the thesis is concerned with the simultaneous design and operation of batch distillation processes. The thesis proposes a stochastic optimisation methodology based on genetic algorithm and penalty function. Using the proposed methodology, the simultaneous optimal designs and operations of the regular column for different design scenarios are investigated using rigorous models. Furthermore, the optimal design of the unconventional multivessel column for multicomponent separation is studied for the first time. The effect of different factors such as objective function, feed composition, relative volatility, product specification and number of components on the optimal design of the multivessel system is investigated. A comparison of the performance of the multivessel system with the regular column is also presented. In the final part of the thesis, the feasibility of the genetic algorithm-penalty function approach in tackling simultaneous configuration selection, column sizing and operation is explored. In the case of binary mixture separation, the regular column was found to be more profitable for feeds with a high fraction of the light component whilst the inverted column is optimal for heavier feeds. There exists a flip point, the location of which is case study specific. For the multicomponent separation case study, the multivessel system is found to be superior to both the regular and inverted configuration...|$|R
40|$|Within {{the last}} decade, {{reactive}} distillation {{has become increasingly}} attractive as a potential process alternative for simultaneously conducting liquid-phase reaction and vapor-liquid separation, {{with the potential to}} overcome chemical equilibrium limitations and to simplify flowsheets. This dissertation develops a systematic steady-state design methodology for kinetically controlled, stagewise reactive distillation columns, taking into account a single isomolar or non-isomolar liquid phase reaction, heat effects, nonideal vapor-liquid equilibrium, and a distribution of liquid holdups on the reactive stages. “Kinetically controlled” means that chemical reaction equilibrium is not obtained on every tray, although vapor-liquid equilibrium is assumed. “Stagewise” implies a column consisting of discrete trays. The method is useful for developing a spectrum of feasible designs over a range of design conditions, which provides insight into the effect of such variables as reboil ratio, heat of reaction and Damkohler number on the total number of stages. The method is demonstrated by developing feasible column designs for the dehydration of methanol, the metathesis of 2 -pentene, and the production of ethylene glycol. ^ The influence of azeotropes on the design of ordinary distillation columns has been widely studied for many years. Azeotropes alter product distributions and attainable regions; cause distillation boundaries to occur; and have {{led to the creation of}} <b>extractive</b> and azeotropic <b>distillation</b> technology. It can be expected that reactive azeotropes have a similar impact on reactive distillation design. However, the influence that key physical property parameters (such as the reaction equilibrium constant) exert on reactive azeotropes is relatively unknown. New tools are needed to determine when reactive systems will exhibit reactive azeotropes and how these azeotropes will influence designs. Such a tool is described in this dissertation: an arc-length continuation technique used to determine the existence and location of both homogeneous and heterogeneous reactive azeotropes in an equilibrium reactive system. ^ Using the techniques and methods developed, the use of reactive distillation in nontraditional applications are explored, such as in a system possessing a small reaction equilibrium constant (Keq 2 ̆ 6 Lt; 1) or kinetically resolving enantiomers from a racemic mixture. ...|$|R
