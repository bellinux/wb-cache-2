500|$|If <b>I</b> <b>Could</b> <b>Make</b> <b>a</b> Living was {{the title}} of Walker's second album, {{released}} in 1994. It produced two more No. 1 singles in the title track (co-written by Alan Jackson, Keith Stegall, and Roger Murrah) and 1995's [...] "This Woman and This Man". The latter song spent two weeks at No. 1, becoming his first multi-week No. 1 hit. Then came the number 16 [...] "My Heart Will Never Know". If <b>I</b> <b>Could</b> <b>Make</b> <b>a</b> Living went platinum in May 1995, reaching number 2 on the country albums chart. Gordon Ely of the Richmond Times-Dispatch gave a favorable review, saying that [...] "Walker has broken loose from Nashville's most recent crop of carefully crafted cowboys." [...] Walker also began touring in 1995 as a headlining act, {{in support of the}} album.|$|E
500|$|Kinsler, {{who would}} have been {{eligible}} to play for Israel in the 2013 World Baseball Classic because of his Jewish heritage, said: [...] "Wow, I would be happy to play for Team Israel.... The truth is that if a proposal comes from Team USA to play for them, I will have a very difficult decision to make. Youk , Braun , and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> fantastic team. I am sure that I'll talk it over with Youk – we always laugh about things like this." ...|$|E
500|$|Clay Walker has {{released}} {{a total of}} 11 albums, including a greatest hits package and an album of Christmas music. His first four studio albums all achieved platinum certification in the United States and his greatest hits collection and fifth studio album were each certified gold. He has charted 30 country singles, including six Number Ones: [...] "What's It to You", [...] "Live Until I Die", Dreaming with My Eyes Open", [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>Could</b> <b>Make</b> <b>a</b> Living", [...] "This Woman and This Man", and [...] "Rumor Has It". His most recent album, She Won't Be Lonely Long, was released in mid-2010.|$|E
60|$|I made a deprecatory gesture, and I {{would have}} had the subject changed, but ere <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> effort to that end, the fool Saint-Eustache was {{babbling}} again.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{is quite}} true. If I were {{speaking}} to you or to your father theoretically I should perhaps be unwilling to admit superiority on your side because of your rank and wealth. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> argument in favour of any equality with the best Briton that ever lived,--as would become a true-born Republican." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Letitia dear, isn't it horrid!" [...] she said. [...] "I must go now! I promised Mrs. Medlingcourt that I'd {{be back to}} tea. She {{has some}} stupid people coming in. We've had such a {{wonderful}} game of croquet. I am quite sure <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> expert of Mr. Thain {{in a very short}} time. Can I have my pony cart, please, Letitia? And what time shall I come on Thursday?" ...|$|R
500|$|I {{started writing}} what I felt was Bat Out of Hell part 2, {{definitely}} like The Godfather part I and part 2, that's how I saw it. I {{wanted to do}} a continuation and I {{wanted to do a}}n album that went even further and that was more extreme, if possible, which a lot of people felt wasn't possible but I just wanted to see if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> record that was even more heroic because that's what I thought of it ... Bat Out of Hell to me was ultimately very heroic though it was funny ... and I wanted to do one that to me would be even more heroic and more epic and a little more operatic and passionate.|$|E
500|$|Hetreed {{worked closely}} with Tucker and Webber to adapt the book, {{explaining}} that [...] "... working with them on drafts helped me to concentrate on what the film would be, rather than how beautifully <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> line work." [...] Her first draft was closest to the source material and it slowly [...] "... developed its own character ..." [...] through rewrites. She avoided using a voiceover, which was present in the novel, [...] "... partly because {{it would make it}} very literary." [...] Instead, she focused on conveying Griet's thoughts visually– for example, in her adaptation Griet and Vermeer inspect the camera obscura together under his cloak amidst sexual tension; whereas, in the novel Griet views it alone immediately after him and enjoys the lasting warmth and scent he leaves.|$|E
500|$|Phillips, meanwhile, {{was always}} on the lookout for someone who could bring to a broader {{audience}} the sound of the black musicians on whom Sun focused. As Keisker reported, [...] "Over and over I remember Sam saying, 'If I could find a white man who had the Negro sound and the Negro feel, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> billion dollars.'" [...] In June, he acquired a demo recording by Jimmy Sweeney of a ballad, [...] "Without You", that he thought might suit the teenage singer. Presley came by the studio, but was unable to do it justice. Despite this, Phillips asked Presley to sing as many numbers as he knew. He was sufficiently affected by what he heard to invite two local musicians, guitarist Winfield [...] "Scotty" [...] Moore and upright bass player Bill Black, to work something up with Presley for a recording session.|$|E
60|$|He handcuffed {{me as he}} spoke. Resistance was hopeless. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only <b>make</b> <b>an</b> {{appeal to}} his mercy, on Alicia's account.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> you <b>a</b> pink cream, Mr. Soames, like in old days; you did so relish them. Good-bye, sir; it {{has been}} a pleasure." ...|$|R
5000|$|Within {{just two}} months of its release, Science Fair had {{significantly}} outsold its major label predecessor, Public, despite its more limited independent label distribution and marketing budget. Gryner has {{been quoted as saying}} that [...] "it blew my mind to see that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> album on an 8-track at a rented cottage and it could reach more people than the previous album which was boardroomed to death by all these supposed experts in the industry." ...|$|R
500|$|In 1913, Chabas {{stated that}} he was [...] "pained and humiliated" [...] by the {{controversy}} over September Morn, though he later expressed more positive views. He described the work as [...] "all I know of painting", and responded positively to statements {{that it was his}} masterpiece. In a 1914 interview, he explained that he had not meant to sell the painting, as it [...] "was [...] wife's favorite picture". At {{the time of his death}} in 1937, Chabas had only a single picture in his room: a reproduction of the painting, completed from memory; he had boasted [...] "If I had never seen it from the day I put down my brushes after painting it, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> perfect copy." [...] However, not having copyrighted the work, he did not receive any royalties from the marketing frenzy in the United States; he recalled, [...] "Nobody was thoughtful enough even to send me a box of cigars." ...|$|E
2500|$|Khan {{took part}} in the 10 m Air rifle {{individual}} event in the 2002 Commonwealth Games at the age of 15. [...] He performed well and found himself fifth before the last shot. At that moment he thought a good shot could earn him a fourth-place finish. [...] He said,"..if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> good I would probably end up fourth. The bronze was a possibility but slightly unlike". His final shot scored 9.9, with a total of 691.9, and he won the gold medal.|$|E
2500|$|When Gladwell {{started at}} The New Yorker in 1996 {{he wanted to}} [...] "mine current {{academic}} research for insights, theories, direction, or inspiration". His first assignment was to write a piece about fashion. Instead of writing about high-class fashion, Gladwell opted to write a piece {{about a man who}} manufactured T-shirts, saying: [...] "it was much more interesting to write a piece about someone who made a T-shirt for $8 than it was to write about a dress that costs $100,000. I mean, you or <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> dress for $100,000, but to make a T-shirt for $8 – that's much tougher." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I found <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> earlier {{connection}} with the C.P.A. yesterday {{and get to the}} Island last night. I was in such a fever to get home that I jumped at the chance. Of course I walked from the station--it's only two miles and every step was a benediction. My trunks are over there. We'll go after them to-morrow, daddy, but just now I want to go straight to every one of the dear old nooks and spots at once." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I'll {{fix that}} easily enough," [...] replied the other. [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>make</b> <b>a</b> glass dog bark I {{would be a}} mighty poor wizard." ...|$|R
6000|$|She laughed very softly, {{and again}} her eyes spoke to him. [...] "Monsieur," [...] she murmured, [...] "you and <b>I</b> {{together}} <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> great alliance, {{is it not}} so?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Sullenberger, {{described}} by friends as [...] "shy and reticent," [...] was noted for his poise and calm during the crisis; New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg dubbed him [...] "Captain Cool." [...] Nonetheless, Sullenberger suffered symptoms of {{post-traumatic stress disorder}} in subsequent weeks, including sleeplessness and flashbacks. He said that the moments before the ditching were [...] "the worst sickening, pit-of-your-stomach, falling-through-the-floor feeling" [...] that he had ever experienced. He also said: [...] "One {{way of looking at}} this might be that for 42 years, I've been making small, regular deposits in this bank of experience, education and training. And on January 15, the balance was sufficient so that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> very large withdrawal." ...|$|E
2500|$|After obtaining his BA, Jackman {{completed}} the one-year course [...] "The Journey" [...] at the Actors' Centre in Sydney. About studying acting full-time, he stated, [...] "It wasn't until I was 22 that I {{ever thought about}} my hobby being something <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> living out of. As a boy, I'd always {{had an interest in}} theatre. But the idea at my school was that drama and music were to round out the man. It wasn't what one did for a living. I got over that. I found the courage to stand up and say, 'I want to do it'." [...] After completing [...] "The Journey", he was offered a role on the popular soap opera Neighbours but turned it down to attend the Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts of Edith Cowan University in Perth, Western Australia, from which he graduated in 1994.|$|E
2500|$|Ellison recalls [...] "I {{had played}} in the winning tour to India of 1984–85 and bowled well, or so I thought. But I was injured for {{the early part of}} the 1985 season, which was {{incredibly}} frustrating. I knew that if fit, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> compelling case for my inclusion in the Ashes team." [...] His determination to get back into the Test squad was not deterred by not being selected for the first three Tests, but he then had an opportunity to impress the then England captain, David Gower. Ellison's recollection is that [...] "Kent, my county, were playing a game against Leicestershire in July and I approached [...] David Gower and said: 'I'm going to make you pick [...] me.' I soon started to take wickets and was called into the squad for the fourth Test in Manchester." [...] Ellison took 3–58 in the first-class match, including Gower's wicket in the only innings in which he bowled.|$|E
5000|$|... "I worked {{part time}} at the shop to earn a nickel or dime," [...] Trickle said. [...] "At that age, it was mostly {{sweeping}} the shop, but I started {{to play with the}} welder and soon <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> arc and then weld. I started junking machinery. I save some things getting a head start for when I would go racing at 16. I didn't have any money, but I had this pile of stuff to build a race car with. It was a hope chest.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I thought I {{had found}} out why I am so horrid! exclaimed Sophy. 'Oh, if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only <b>make</b> <b>a</b> fresh beginning! Mamma, do pray give me a Prayer Book.' ...|$|R
60|$|He got up frae his bed, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> oot <b>a</b> {{rustling}} noise, {{as though}} he were dressin' himsel', and presently his footfa' as he began tae walk up and doon in his room.|$|R
60|$|DAVID Now, that's {{just the}} place where <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> shift to do without it.|$|E
60|$|But, though I {{could not}} cry, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> noise with my heels, and this I did with a right good will.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't know, Tom,' {{said his}} sister, blushing, 'I am not quite confident, but I think <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> beef-steak pudding, if I tried, Tom.' ...|$|E
5000|$|Nick Cave: [...] "‘I’m {{not really}} {{interested}} in the audience’s enjoyment,’ Cave mumbles once he has changed into his clean trousers. ‘It doesn’t bother me one way or another. I just don’t give a shit. People feel more and more disappointed with each concert because less and less happens. It’s really easy to suck an audience in. like I can wiggle my bum and backflip on my head and they love it. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> audience love me {{until the end of}} my days. There’s no point in it any more. I wish they’d just … die.’" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't see, now, how <b>I</b> <b>could</b> ever <b>make</b> <b>a</b> {{friend of}} him," [...] {{declared}} Gus Plum. [...] "Now, in one way, I like Merwell--he's a fighter and he doesn't care who knows it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What does {{it matter}} being odd? You could learn the truth at any rate. If she does not care for any one else why shouldn't she have me? <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> her <b>a</b> baronet's wife,--that is, some day when the governor--" ...|$|R
6000|$|So {{interrupted}} the clicking telegraphic instrument. Before <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> comment upon this extraordinary episode, the following despatch carried my thoughts into another and very distressing channel: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yer," [...] said he; {{but before}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> bundle of my load I saw him disappearing over a hill with the canoe on his head.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{must take}} second place now. I must write; {{it is the}} only thing I can do. If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> living at {{anything}} else I would give up writing altogether." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Can she not repent? Can she not mortify these base affections? Can she not be forgiven? Oh, my Pelagia! {{forgive me}} for having dreamed one moment that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> you <b>a</b> philosopher, when {{you may be a}} saint of God, a--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wish you}} would. It {{would be best}} to the aunt, and just tell her that I am fairly well off. She'll tell Ayala <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> quite <b>a</b> proper {{settlement}} on her. That kind of thing does go a long way with young ladies." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{wind had}} fallen to a dead calm toward morning, and the Elsinore, her several spread sails booming and slatting, rolled more miserably than ever. Mr. Mellaire pointed for'ard of our {{starboard}} beam. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> out <b>a</b> bleak land of white and jagged peaks.|$|R
