5|$|According to Fred Guweddeko, a {{researcher}} at Makerere University, Amin {{was the son of}} Andreas Nyabire (1889–1976). Nyabire, a member of the Kakwa ethnic group, converted from Roman Catholicism to Islam in 1910 and changed his name to Amin Dada. He named his first-born son after himself. Abandoned by his father at a young age, Idi Amin grew up with his mother's <b>family</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> rural farming town in north-western Uganda. Guweddeko states that Amin's mother was Assa Aatte (1904–1970), an ethnic Lugbara and a traditional herbalist who treated members of Buganda royalty, among others.|$|E
5|$|After {{depositing}} his <b>family</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> London hotel, the Claimant {{called at}} Lady Tichborne's address {{and was told}} she was in Paris. He then went to Wapping in East London, where he enquired after a local family named Orton. Finding that they had left the area, he identified himself to a neighbour {{as a friend of}} Arthur Orton, who, he said, was now one of the wealthiest men in Australia. The significance of the Wapping visit would become apparent only later. On 29 December the Claimant visited Alresford and stayed at the Swan Hotel, where the landlord detected a resemblance to the Tichbornes. The Claimant confided that he was the missing Sir Roger but asked that this be kept secret. He also sought information concerning the Tichborne family.|$|E
5|$|As Minton grew older, he was {{frequently}} {{in trouble with}} the people in his neighborhood. In 1904, he was arrested for disregarding a town ordinance forbidding bicyclists to ride on the sidewalk. He was taken before a justice of the peace and fined three dollars, an incident he later credited with changing his outlook on life and sparking his desire to become a lawyer. To accomplish that goal, and continue supporting his family, he traveled with his older brother Herbert to Fort Worth, Texas, to take a job at the Swift and Company meat packing plant. His father and younger siblings soon joined him in Texas after the two brothers' income was able to cover their expenses. After saving enough money to help establish the <b>family</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> new home, Minton returned to Indiana to attend high school, leaving his family in Texas.|$|E

5|$|Finally, {{with the}} end of the two mathematicians' cryptologic work at the close of World War II, the Cipher Bureau ceased to exist. From nearly its {{inception}} in 1931 until war's end in 1945, the Bureau, sometimes incorporated into aggregates under cryptonyms (PC Bruno and Cadix), had been essentially the same agency, with most of the same core personnel, carrying out much the same tasks; now it was extinguished. Neither Rejewski nor Zygalski would work again as cryptologists. In late 1946 Rejewski returned to his <b>family</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> devastated and politically altered Poland, to live there another 33 years until his death in February 1980. Zygalski would remain in England until his death in August 1978.|$|E
5|$|Griet (Scarlett Johansson) is a shy girl {{living in}} the Dutch Republic in 1665. Her father, a Delftware painter, has {{recently}} gone blind, rendering him unable to work and putting his <b>family</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> precarious financial situation. To help matters, Griet is sent {{to work as a}} maid in the household of famed painter Johannes Vermeer (Colin Firth). Griet works hard, almost wordlessly, in the lowest position in a harsh hierarchy, doing her best despite spiteful treatment by one of Vermeer's children. While she is on a routine shopping trip outside the house, a butcher's son, Pieter (Cillian Murphy), notices Griet and falls in love with her, even though she is slow to return his affections.|$|E
5|$|Maeser {{was elected}} as the regent of the University of Deseret in 1860, 1863 and in 1865. In 1865, {{he began to}} privately tutor Young's fifty-six {{children}} and also instructed other children {{who came to the}} Young household including Ellis Reynolds Shipp. During this time, he also kept books for Leonard H. Hardy to supplement his income. He was teaching at Young's family school when he was called on a mission to Germany in 1867. He left for Europe in May 1867, leaving his <b>family</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> poor financial state.|$|E

He was cremated at Hollywood Forever Cemetery and his funeral {{was held at the}} Self-Realization Fellowship Lake Shrine in Pacific Palisades, California. His ashes were then scattered in the Ganges and Yamuna rivers near Varanasi, India, by his close <b>family</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> private ceremony according to Hindu tradition. He left almost £100million in his will.|$|E
5|$|Originally from North Carolina, Mainer's main {{influences}} {{came from}} the mountain music of his <b>family.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> career that began in 1934 and spanned almost six decades, Mainer transitioned from {{being a member of}} his brother's band into the founder of his own ensemble, the Sons of the Mountaineers, with whom he performed until 1953, when he became more deeply involved with his Christianity and left the music industry. After working at a General Motors factory and attending gospel revivals, Mainer was convinced that he should restart his career as a Christian gospel musician and began to tour with his wife in this capacity. He continued to release albums until 1993.|$|E

5|$|Princess Sophia's {{substantial}} income, provided {{from the}} civil list, had allowed Conroy to enjoy a wealthy lifestyle. The princess died in 1848, leaving only £1,607 19s 7d in her bank accounts despite a lifestyle of savings and low expenses. The Duke of Cambridge and the Duchess of Gloucester had a lawyer write to Conroy demanding that he account {{for the rest of}} their sister Sophia's funds, but Conroy simply ignored it. According to Flora Fraser, the most recent biographer of George III's daughters, Princess Sophia had in fact personally spent huge sums on Conroy, including heavy contributions to the purchase prices of his residences and supporting his <b>family</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> style he judged appropriate to their position. Conroy ultimately received £148,000 in gifts and money from Sophia.|$|E
5|$|The trailer was {{designed}} to be emotional, allowing players to care for the characters and to be distinct from trailers for the game's competitors. The trailer does not show any actual gameplay, instead telling a short story about the game's world and the background behind its events. The development team also had the goal to show the inevitability and the helplessness of a <b>family</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> zombie outbreak. Upon its release on February 16, 2011, the trailer sparked public interest, and the community reaction led Techland to adjust the content of the actual game. It was met with a mixed reception from critics. Praise was directed at the trailer's new ideas, story, immersion and tone, however, it received criticism for lacking gameplay information and its depiction of a dead child. The trailer received multiple awards upon release.|$|E
5|$|The writer Ratazyayev, who {{jokes about}} using Devushkin as a {{character}} {{in one of his}} stories offends him, but genuinely seems to like him. Eventually Devushkin's pride is assuaged and their friendship is restored. The Gorshkovs come into money because the father's case is won in court. With the generous settlement they seem to be destined to be perfectly happy, but the father dies, leaving his <b>family</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> shambles despite the money. Soon after this, Dobroselova announces that a rich man, Mr. Bykov who had dealings with Anna Fyodorovna and Pokrovsky's father, has proposed to her. She decides to leave with him, and the last few letters attest to her slowly becoming accustomed to her new money.|$|E

5|$|These revivals {{could be}} made using {{pantograph}} machine engraving systems, which gave a cleaner result than historic typefaces whose master punches had been hand-carved, and allowed rapid development of a <b>family</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> large range of sizes. In addition, the new hot metal typesetting technology of the period created increasing availability and demand for new fonts. Among hot metal typesetting companies, Monotype's branches in Britain and the United States brought out separate versions, and the American branch of Linotype licensed that of ATF.|$|E
5|$|When The Jackson 5 parted {{with their}} record label Motown in 1976, they signed to CBS Records and rebranded {{themselves}} as The Jacksons. Additionally, the brothers were signed to CBS-TV to star with their <b>family</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> variety series called The Jacksons. The shows premiered in June 1976 and featured {{all of the}} siblings excluding Jermaine, who had chosen to stay with Motown. The initial series run of the 30-minute programs was four weeks. Due to ratings success, more episodes were ordered in January 1977. The shows {{marked the first time}} that an African-American family had ever starred in a television series. The run of programs concluded shortly afterward.|$|E
5|$|Following the Peace of Paris in 1783, Seymour took a {{house in}} London with his brother Lord George Seymour and John Willett Payne. The three men became notorious socialites, joining the Prince of Wales on many of his {{drinking}} exploits across London: Seymour remained close friends with Prince George {{for the rest of}} his life. Seymour, already known for his good looks, good manners, height and martial bearing, rapidly gained a reputation for dissolution. In 1785 however, Seymour married Lady Anne Horatia Waldegrave, daughter of Earl Waldegrave and Maria Walpole (later Duchess of Gloucester) at the insistence of his <b>family</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> successful attempt to curtail his social activities. It was at this time that Seymour made his first foray into politics, becoming MP for Newport on the Isle of Wight before relinquishing the post two years later. In 1788 he became MP for Tregony, but in 1790 he switched to become MP for Wendover. Seymour remained in this position until 1796 when he changed his seat to Portsmouth, in which he remained until his death. He did not serve as an active politician in any of these positions, preferring his navy career to his political one.|$|E
