40|$|This Project is a fifth {{semester}} {{project in}} the course Danish from Roskilde University. The project aims to describe, analyze and discuss how the choice of new types of <b>fighter</b> <b>aircrafts</b> unfolds in the public debate. The acquisition of new <b>fighter</b> <b>aircrafts</b> {{is based on a}} desire to optimize the Danish defence, so that Denmark can contribute to international military operations and preserve its sovereignty in Danish airspace. The acquisition of new <b>fighter</b> <b>aircrafts</b> is furthermore {{due to the fact that}} the current F- 16 <b>fighter</b> <b>aircrafts</b> are becoming outdated. The project uses tools from text analysis in the form of argumentation and framing theory to identify opinions and the reasons for those opinions to different types of <b>fighter</b> <b>aircrafts.</b> The project begins with a presentation of problems and circumstances of the debate followed by an argument analysis of the prominent arguments. This continues to the study of how frames are used to create a certain opinion towards the two aircrafts F- 35 and F- 18. Furthermore the results of the analysis will be used to discuss the interaction between framing and argumentation, which provides an understanding of why there has been a change of opinion to the preferred fighter aircraft. Furthermore the discussion contributes to understanding how the recipient is unconsciously influenced by the consignor. Finally a reflection of the general complexity in languages will be given. All this shows how the public debate never acts objectively, but activates certain frames through used words and expressions...|$|E

40|$|When an {{aircraft}} is flying and burning fuel {{the center of}} gravity (c. g.) of the aircraft shifts slowly. The c. g. can also be shifted abruptly when e. g. a fighter aircraft releases a weapon. The shift in c. g. is difficult to measure or estimate so the flight control systems need to be robustly designed to cope with this variation. However for <b>fighter</b> <b>aircrafts</b> with high manoeuvrability there is room for improvements. In this project we investigate if the use of adaptive control law augmentation can be used to better cope with the change in c. g. We augment a baseline controller with a robust Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC) design and analyse its benefits and possible issues.

To analyse such load-time histories for fatigue evaluation purposes, a number of counting methods are available in which level crossings, peaks, or ranges are counted. Ten different existing counting principles are defined. The load-time histories are analysed to evaluate these counting methods. For some of the described counting methods, the counting results might be affected by arbitrarily chosen parameters such as the magnitude of load ranges that will be neglected and other secondary counting restrictions. Such influences might invalidate the final counting results entirely. The evaluation shows that {{for the type of}} load-time histories associated with most counting methods, a sensible value of the parameters involved can be found...|$|E

40|$|A {{lightweight}} High Speed Flexible Coupling (HSFC) is used {{to connect}} the engine gear box (EGB) with an accessory gear box (AGB) for <b>fighter</b> <b>aircrafts.</b> The HSFC transmits the power at high speeds ranging from 10000 to 18000 rpm from the EGB to AGB. The HSFC also accommodates larger angular and axial misalignments resulting from differential thermal expansion of the aircraft engine and mounting arrangement. The HSFC utilizes series of metallic contoured annular thin flexible plates. These flexible plates are susceptible to fatigue failures {{in the presence of}} minuscule surface defects. The present work describes the analysis carried out on a typical HSFC with incipient flaw for various kinds of imposed misalignments. Based on the sensitivity study of the flaw on the stress levels, a Fatigue Crack Growth Arrestor (FCGA) is designed. In order to contain the crack propagation, drilling a hole {{at the tip of the}} crack on the flexible plate as a FCGA is adapted. The fatigue life of the flexible plates is improved by finding appropriate size and location of FCGA through finite element analysis and simulations. KEYWORDS...|$|E

Hence accurate prediction of RCS of complex objects like aircrafts is essential to meet this requirement. A simple and efficient numerical procedure for treating problems of wide band RCS prediction Perfect Electric Conductor (PEC) objects is developed using Method of Moment (MoM). Implementation of MoM for prediction of RCS involves solving Electric Field Integral Equation (EFIE) for electric current using the vector and scalar potential solutions, which satisfy the boundary condition that the tangential electric field at the boundary of the PEC body is zero. For numerical purposes, the objects are modeled using planar triangular surfaces patches. Set of special sub-domain type basis functions are defined on pairs of adjacent triangular patches. These basis functions yield a current representation free of line or point charges at sub-domain boundaries. Once the current distribution is obtained, dipole model is used to find Scattering field in free space. RCS can be calculated from the scattered and incident fields.

40|$|Abstract: Fighter {{aircraft}} wings {{are the leading}} lift generating components for any aerospace vehicle. The recital of any flying vehicle largely depends on its wing design. Missiles and the <b>fighter</b> <b>aircrafts</b> which are having propulsion system mostly have fins to control and maneuver. In this present paper work an attempt {{has been made to}} design a fighter aircraft wing configuration which will be used in some air launched air to surface guided weapons fighter aircraft. The main focus of this paper agreement in determining the Sweep-back effects on fighter aircraft wing under transonic condition at different angles of attack (AoA) from 0 to 5 degrees. For this the fighter aircraft wing performance for various flow conditions and sweep angles are obtained based on the empirical, semi-empirical and CFD simulation results. Hence by studying these computational results would help in the optimizing geometry for better performance, an finest wing design for the air launched air to surface body with conservative wing can be obtained. A fighter aircraft is a military aircraft intended primarily for air-to-air combat alongside other aircraft, as contrasting to bombers and attack aircraft, whose main task is to attack earth targets. The trademarks of a fighter aircraft are its quickness, maneuverability, and lesser size virtual to othe...|$|E
40|$|Copyright The {{night of}} May 19, 1986 was famous globally. As many as twenty one unknown objects were seen and tracked by ground radar and many jet {{airplanes}} over several states in southeastern Brazil. Unidentified radar returns were tracked by airports in São Paulo and the Integrated Air Defense & Air Traffic Control Center I (CINDACTA I) in Brasilia. Two F- 5 E and three Mirage jet fighters were scrambled from Santa Cruz AFB in Rio de Janeiro state, and Anápolis AFB in Goias state. It {{was the first}} time that government authorities of any country published the existence in their air space of unidentified aerial phenomena. On that night, CINDACTA I radars that cover the whole Southeast Area, besides the Federal Capital of Brasil captured as many as twenty one unidentified plots, many of which demonstrated very uncommon flight profiles.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} how a 3 D-Audio system {{for use in}} <b>fighter</b> <b>aircrafts</b> was evaluated in an experiment, by comparing localization performance between real and virtual sound sources. Virtual sound sources from 58 selected directions were evaluated, while 16 of these directions were also evaluated using real sound sources, i. e. loudspeakers. 13 pilots from the Royal Danish Air Force and 13 civil persons {{were used in the}} test. The localization performance was split into a constant and a stochastic difference between the perceived direction and the desired direction (stimulus). The constant difference is a localization offset and the stochastic difference is a measure for the localization uncertainty. Stimuli length of both 250 ms and 2 s enabled investigation of the importance of head movements, i. e. using head tracking. Real and virtual sound sources could be located with an uncertainty of 10 o and 14 o degrees for azimuth while the uncertainty for elevation was 12 o and 24 o (real and virtual sound sources). No significant localization offset was found for azimuth, while an average offset for elevation of 3 o – 6 o degrees was found using long stimuli. A significant difference between the localization offset obtained in different directions was found – especially for elevation, where the offset was found to have a strong correlation to the stimuli elevation. ...|$|E

40|$|After {{successful}} completion of the test programme of Gnat Fighter Aircraft using full scale fatigue test rig developed by NAL, the Fatigue Group has taken the major task of developing a computerised full scale fatigue test rig under the project of development of fatigue test facilities. This has felt necessary {{in view of the}} practical difficulties experienced during the use of the existing six actuator full scale fatigue test rig. Sufficient clear heights for rigging of loading trees was an important consideration {{in the design of the}} new test rig. The floor area of the test rig was arrived at by examining the plan form dimensions of 13; number of fighter air-crafts in IAF (Fig. 1).

40|$|The {{conventional}} wisdom on indo-US relations states {{that in the}} last few years, the two sides have elevated their interaction to a deeper level. The Next Steps in Strategic Partnership (NSSP) has substantiated the Indo-US relations.

Moreover, in July 2005, joint statement resolved to establish a US-India “global partnership” through increased cooperation on economic issues, on energy and the environment, on democracy and development, on non-proliferation and security, and on high technology and space. The biggest landmark in the Indo-US relations was achieved with the unveiling of Indo-US Civil Nuclear Cooperation Agreement in July 2005. This agreement has put Indo-US relation on new heights.

40|$|In {{the case}} of {{high-speed}} <b>fighter</b> <b>aircrafts,</b> seat ejection is designed mainly {{for the safety of}} the pilot in case of an emergency. Strong windblast due to the high velocity of flight is one main difficulty in clearing the tail of the aircraft. Excessive G-forces generated, immobilizes the pilot from escape. In most of the cases, seats are ejected out of the aircrafts by explosives or by rocket motors attached to the bottom of the seat. Ejection forces are primarily in the vertical direction with the objective of attaining the maximum possible velocity in a specified period of time. The safe ejection parameters are studied to estimate the critical time of ejection for various geometries and velocities of flight. An equivalent analytical 2 -dimensional biomechanical model of the human spine has been modelled consisting of vertebrae and intervertebral discs with a lumped mass approach. The 24 vertebrae, which consists of the cervical, thoracic and lumbar regions, in addition to the head mass and the pelvis has been designed as 26 rigid structures and the intervertebral discs are assumed as 25 flexible joint structures. The rigid structures are modelled as mass elements and the flexible joints as spring and damper elements. Here, the motions are restricted only in the mid-sagittal plane to form a 26 degree of freedom system. The equations of motions are derived for translational movement of the spinal column.

40|$|In current warfare {{scenario}} stealth {{and passive}} threat detection capabilities are considered as prime requirements to accomplish desired mission by the <b>fighter</b> <b>aircrafts.</b> To improve the stealth of an aircraft, {{the trend is}} towards detecting threats {{with the help of}} passive sensors (Electro Optic or Infrared). Current situation caters for systems like Infra-red Search and Track (IRST) and Passive Missile Warning Systems (PMWS). IRST system is a passive target detection system, used for detecting aerial & ground targets. PMWS is a threat detection system used for detecting missiles approaching towards aircraft. Both of these systems detect targets of interest by processing IR images acquired in mid-IR region. The prime challenge in IRST system or PMWS is detecting a moving target of size typically 1 ~ 2 pixels in acquired image sequences. The temporal change caused by moving target in consecutive frames can be considered as one important factor to detect them. The temporal change caused by moving target is identified through absolute frame differencing of successive frames. This principle has limitation in application to IRST & PMWS as the imaging sensor with the aircraft is moving. This motion also imparts temporal change in the acquired images. In this paper authors are proposing a method for removing the temporal change caused by the platform motion in two consequently acquired frames using registration process.   The proposed method uses the platform attitude information at frame sampling times. Authors have analyzed the sensitivity of registration process to noisy platform attitude information. Defence Science Journal, 2014,  64 (2), pp. 130 - 135.   DOI: [URL] </p...|$|E

One of the main design considerations is the assurance of safety against panel flutter under the flow conditions characterized by harsh thermal environment. This paper presents the work carried out at NAL to estimate the effects of a thermal profile in lowering the critical dynamic pressure (flutter boundary) of flat rectangular panels subjected to supersonic flow. A finite element formulation (employing the Kirchoff plate C 1 bending element) has been developed here for supersonic flutter analysis of simply supported rectangular panels without in-plane edge constraints subjected to an assumed parabolic thermal profile that can result from any residual heat seeping into the metallic panels through the thermal protection systems. The piston theory is used for aerodynamic pressure computations, and provision is made to take into account the effect of arbitrary flow directions with respect to the panel edges. The results generated using the in-house finite element code and also the MSC NASTRAN software are in good agreement with analytical results. From the analysis of the results for various flow directions it has been observed that the flow along the longer side of any panel is most critical.
