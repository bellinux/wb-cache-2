5|$|For the American forces, abuses were {{typically}} either a disproportionate use of firepower or servicemen committing extrajudicial killings (such as in Haditha). Many accusations {{of human rights}} violations against the United States were connected with the First and Second Battles of Fallujah. Following the assault, the United States military admitted it had employed white phosphorus artillery rounds, the use of which is not permitted in civilian areas under the United Nations Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons. Several Marines, all {{of them from the}} 3rd Battalion 1st Marines, were later charged (but not convicted) with executing <b>Iraqi</b> <b>prisoners.</b> Some British advisers also complained that the Marines had little regard for civilian casualties and had used munitions containing depleted uranium that caused birth defects for years after the battle.|$|E

During its year of deployment, the brigade {{established}} Prisoner of War holding areas for over 3,600 <b>Iraqi</b> <b>prisoners</b> and conducted main supply route patrolling over 2,500 kilometers in southern Iraq. The Brigade entered Baghdad in April 2003 and began establishing the new Iraqi Police Service and rebuilding Iraqi police stations. From {{the beginning of}} Operation Iraqi Freedom until February 2004 the Brigade provided command and control for seven Military Police battalions, one Mechanized Infantry battalion, 30 Military Police companies, and two Law and Order detachments. The Brigade’s MPs conducted over 24,000 combat patrols, apprehended over 2,400 criminals, confiscated 7,500 illegal weapons, and trained over 10,000 Iraqi police officers. During their deployment, the Brigade recovered several precious artifacts, such as the Mask of Warka, which was recovered on 23 September 2003. The brigade returned to Sandhofen in 2004 only to return to Iraq in 2007.|$|E

At the hearing several other possible witnesses were listed, including the prerecorded video depositions of three <b>Iraqi</b> <b>prisoners</b> — two for the prosecution {{and one for the}} defense.

500|$|In an {{interview}} with the BBC in October 2005, Walker suggested that the army's recruitment had been adversely affected by the Iraq War.

This is not going to be solved in a short term". In the same month, he gave {{an interview}} for The Sunday Times, in which he said that soldiers' morale had been damaged by the unpopularity of the war among the British public. Later in 2005, Walker was instrumental in drawing up new procedures for the treatment of British service personnel accused of abusing <b>Iraqi</b> <b>prisoners,</b> following claims that the army had abandoned those soldiers charged in connection with the prisoner abuses. In February 2006, Walker headed up a military delegation to Bulgaria to discuss military cooperation between the British and Bulgarian governments.|$|E
500|$|Jackson succeeded General Sir Michael Walker as Chief of the General Staff (CGS)—the {{professional}} head of, {{and highest}} post in, the British Army—on 1 February 2003, {{just over a}} month before the 2003 invasion of Iraq. He later said that he [...] "did his homework" [...] in researching the disputed legality of the war and had convinced himself that the invasion was legal. Shortly after the invasion of Iraq, Jackson ordered an inquiry into the alleged abuse of <b>Iraqi</b> <b>prisoners</b> by British soldiers. He admitted that the allegations had damaged the Army's reputation, but believed that further damage would be done by covering them up. Several soldiers were eventually convicted in connection with the abuse, after which Jackson publicly apologised on behalf of the British Army and promised to appoint an officer to determine what lessons needed to be learnt.
