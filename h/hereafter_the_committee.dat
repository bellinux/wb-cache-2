The opinions in this letter reflect the views of the individuals on <b>the</b> <b>Committee</b> and not those of the American Accounting Association. Scope of this letter This letter speaks to the issues raised in the Proposal specifically. In particular, we note that this letter is a precursor to a more-comprehensive letter on intangibles by <b>the</b> <b>Committee</b> that will summarize and evaluate the relatively large literature on this topic and that will focus on issues related to recognition and measurement, as well as disclosure. We expect to submit this letter to the Board before our annual meeting with the Board next May. General comments <b>The</b> <b>Committee</b> is broadly supportive of the FASB’s proposal for considering issues related to the disclosure and recognition of intangibles. In particular, we agree with the general notion that there are currently inconsistencies in the accounting treatment of economically similar intangibles; for example, the difference between the treatment of intangibles acquired externally and those developed internally. However, we have some reservations and other comments about the Proposal as it currently stands, which fall into the following areas...|$|R

Enrichment Corporation (USEC) privatization. BACKGROUND: In SECY- 98 - 063, dated April 2, 1998, the staff provided the Commission with a revised draft SRP chapter for the privatization of USEC. In May 1998, the staff informed the Commission, via its designated assistants, of proposed further revisions to the SRP based on comments received {{from members of the}} High Enriched Uranium (HEU) Oversight Committee (<b>hereafter,</b> <b>the</b> <b>Committee).</b> These revisions clarified the process for interaction between NRC and the Committee concerning the USEC Privatization Act requirements. The Commission approved the release of the draft SRP, containing the suggested revisions, to USEC and the bidders. The Committee also indicated that it would provide further comment on the SRP regarding NRC review of contracts associated with the Russian HEU Agreement. DISCUSSION: The Committee had communicated to the staff its concern with the SRP Review Procedures, Section 1. 4. 5. 2, "Common Defense and Security, " Item 4. This item dealt with the NRC review of contracts associated with the Russian HEU Agreement. The review was described as an assessment of the impact of these contracts on the viability of the privatized corporation. CONTACT...|$|E

40|$|Rennet is used {{in animal}} and human {{foodstuffs}} (including cheese and food supplements) and in medicinal products and for the manufacture of lactose. Rennet can be produced from animals, mostly calves and adult cattle, from plant materials and by genetic engineering. As rennet may be sourced from certain TSE-susceptible animal species (besides using biotechnological processes or certain plant sources), the SSC was invited to prepare a general opinion on the safety of rennet obtained from calves, adult cattle, small ruminants and pigs with regard to animal TSE risks and particularly BSE risks, including those resulting from the method of harvesting, risks from the epithelium, contamination with lymphoid tissues, contamination with feed, feed bans, risk from cross-contaminated feed, and geographical sourcing. The SSC asked the TSE/BSE ad hoc Group to prepare a scientific report on the subject, which could serve as input into the discussions when preparing its opinion. This report is attached. It served {{as the basis for}} <b>the</b> opinion <b>hereafter,</b> which considers only rennet produced from animals and particularly calves and adult cattle. OPINION In <b>the</b> opinion <b>hereafter</b> <b>the</b> Scientific Steering <b>Committee</b> assumes that animal rennet is derived from materials from animals that are fit for human consumption. A. RENNET FROM RUMINANTS The source of any TSE infectivity in rennet is from the abomasum, from TSE-infected feed within its lumen at the time of slaughter or from cross-contamination. The feed bans that are currently in place in the EU apply equally to bovines and small ruminants and should therefore exclude the presence of TSE-infected feed in the lumen at the time of slaughter. A number of TSE-risk reduction strategies are currently in use in abattoirs in the EU that reduce risks from cross-contamination and should eliminate them if properly enforced. With regard to the possible abomasum-related risk, the SSC considers...|$|R

40|$|Traditional {{communities}} that were precluded from {{the benefits and}} financial rewards of exploitation of the mineral resources of South Africa are afforded the opportunity to lodge an application with the Department of Mineral Resources (<b>hereafter</b> <b>the</b> department) to obtain a so-called preferent prospecting right (or mining right) in respect of land which is registered - or to be registered - in their name. An applicant {{on behalf of the}} community has to meet the requirements of section 104 (2) of the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act 28 of 2002 (<b>hereafter</b> <b>the</b> MPRDA). This in line with one of the objectives of the MPRDA of expanding the opportunities for historically disadvantaged persons, such as traditional communities, to enter into, and actively participate in, the mineral industry and to benefit from the exploitation of the nation's mineral resources (s 2 (d)). The Minister of Mineral Resources ((<b>hereafter</b> <b>the</b> minister), in his/her capacity as the custodian of the mineral resources of South Africa on behalf of the people of South Africa (s 3 (1)), is, amongst others, by implication tasked with achieving, these objectives. The same applies to the department and its officials. However, this was unfortunately not the experience of a traditional community, <b>the</b> Bengwenyama-Ya-Maswazi community (<b>hereafter</b> <b>the</b> BYM community), who had to battle through two rounds of litigation with the minister, the department and persons and entities which promoted their own interests whilst attempting to convey the (false) impression that they were representing the community. The subject of this discussion is the second round of litigation between the Bengwenyama-Ya-Maswazi Tribal Council and Genorah. The second round of litigation involved competing applications for preferent community prospecting rights in two related appeals heard together by the Supreme Court of Appeal (<b>hereafter</b> <b>the</b> SCA). The first appeal concerned preferent community prospecting rights on <b>the</b> farm Nooitverwacht (<b>hereafter</b> <b>the</b> Nooitverwacht appeal) and the second appeal involved preferent community prospecting rights on <b>the</b> farm Eerstegeluk (<b>hereafter</b> <b>the</b> Eerstegeluk appeal). The focus of the discussion is on the Nooitverwacht appeal, and references (where appropriate) will be made to the Eerstegeluk appeal. A number of related issues are also discussed – these include the distinction between prospecting rights and preferent community prospecting rights; the meaning of " [...] . land which is registered or to be registered {{in the name of the}} community concerned" (with reference to restitution land, redistribution land, and community land acquired from own resources); and the changing legal landscape relating to community decision-making and consultation. ...|$|R

40|$|This chapter will {{ascertain}} {{the intentions of}} the drafters of the European Convention on Human Rights (<b>hereafter</b> <b>the</b> ECHR or Convention) and then examine a number of factors that have resulted in the judicial expansion of the rights and freedoms enshrined in its text. The genesis of the Convention predates the creation of the inter-state organisation the Council of Europe. In 1948 a collection of non-governmental groups, favouring unity in western Europe, held the ‘Congress of Europe’. The Congress ended with a five-point declaration that included: ‘…(2) [w]e desire a Charter of Human Rights guaranteeing liberty of thought, assembly and expression as well as the right to form a political opposition; (3) [w]e desire a Court of Justice with adequate sanctions for the implementation of the Charter…’. During the next year a triumvirate of rapporteurs drafted a European Convention on Human Rights and a Statute of the European Court of Human Rights (<b>hereafter</b> <b>the</b> Court) for the ‘European Movement’. Following the establishment of the Council of Europe these two drafts were submitted to the highest political body of <b>the</b> Council, <b>the</b> <b>Committee</b> of Ministers. In turn <b>the</b> <b>Committee</b> of Ministers authorised the discussion of the development of such a Convention by the Council's Consultative Assembly. The ensuing debates revealed the rapporteurs, taking account of the political need to secure state agreement to the substance of the Convention, adopting circumscribed views towards the scope of the Convention's guarantees. For example, Teitgen considered that the Convention should embody a ‘collective guarantee’ of a limited set of rights: ‘security of person; freedom from arbitrary arrest; freedom from slavery and servitude; freedom of speech and expression; freedom of religious belief, practice and teaching; freedom of association and assembly; the natural rights derived from marriage and paternity and those pertaining to the family, the sanctity of the home, equality before law, protection from discrimination on account of religion, race, national origin, political or philosophical opinion; freedom from arbitrary deprivation of property’...|$|R
