5|$|At {{the start}} of the 19th century, {{scientific}} investigation began to indicate that the Glamorgan valleys were rich with coal deposits. Bute, who already owned coal mines in County Durham, commissioned further surveys in 1817 and 1823–24 which showed that there were potentially huge profits to be made from the reserves, both from the coal sitting beneath Bute's own lands, but also from the coal under common lands <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>that</b> Bute could claim through his feudal titles. Bute set about consolidating his rights and existing investments during the late 1820s and 1830s, acquiring extensive rights to the coalfields in the process. Bute established and managed a few colleries – such as that at Rhigos – directly, but given the investment costs and attention they took up, generally preferred to lease out his coal fields and claim a royalty on the coal mined instead. The lessees might be iron-masters, who used the coal in their own operations, or colliery owners who sold the coal on to industrial or domestic customers. The profits increased from £872 {{in the second half of}} 1826, to £10,756 in 1848–49.|$|E

Magnús, therefore, appears to have intended for Sigurðr to rule over his recently-won territories. Unfortunately for Ua Briain, and his long-term ambitions in Ireland and the Isles, Magnús was slain in Ulster in 1103, whereupon Sigurðr immediately repudiated his bride and returned to Norway.

According to historian Severine Silva, no concrete evidence has yet been found that there were any permanent settlements of Christians in South Canara before the 16th century.

5|$|On August12, a {{tropical}} disturbance entered the Caribbean Sea {{to the south}} of Antigua, believed to have been a strong tropical wave.

Due to the ongoing War of 1812, there was a British blockade of American ships, which caused a lack of observations in the region. As a result, the storm's track was uncertain, although it is believed that the system entered the Gulf of Mexico by August18; that day, a ship reported hurricane-force winds. After moving northward, the hurricane turned to the northwest off the coast of Louisiana.|$|E

5|$|Within the year, Magnús himself {{arrived in}} the Isles, {{captured}} Lagmann, and conquered the kingdom. After overwintering in region, the Norwegian king left for Scandinavia in the summer, only to make his return nearly four years later, in 1102 or 1103. Once re-established on Mann, Magnús may well have seized control of Dublin before entering into an alliance with Muirchertach, formalised through the marriage between Magnús's young son, Sigurðr (died 1130), and Muirchertach's daughter, Bjaðmunjo (fl. 1102/1103). The arrangement seems to reveal that Magnús intended for Sigurðr to rule over his recently-won territories. Although it may have also meant that Norwegian sovereignty in the Isles was recognised by the Irish, {{it is also possible}} that Muirchertach intended to exert his own influence into the region through his new son-in-law. Unfortunately for Muirchertach, and his long-term ambitions in Ireland and the Isles, Magnús was slain in Ulster in 1103, whereupon Sigurðr immediately repudiated his bride and returned to Norway.

5|$|Heinrich Olbers {{discovered}} Pallas in 1802, {{the year}} after the discovery of Ceres. He proposed that the two objects were the remnants of a destroyed planet. He sent a letter with his proposal to the English astronomer William Herschel, suggesting that a search near the locations where the orbits of Ceres and Pallas intersected might reveal more fragments. These orbital intersections were located in the constellations of Cetus and Virgo. Olbers commenced his search in 1802, and on 29 March 1807 he discovered Vesta in the constellation Virgo—a coincidence, because Ceres, Pallas, and Vesta are not fragments of a larger body. Because the asteroid Juno had been discovered in 1804, this made Vesta the fourth object to be identified <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>that</b> is now known as the asteroid belt. The discovery was announced in a letter addressed to German astronomer Johann H. Schröter dated 31 March. Because Olbers already had credit for discovering a planet (Pallas; at the time, the asteroids were considered to be planets), he gave the honor of naming his new discovery to German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss, whose orbital calculations had enabled astronomers to confirm the existence of Ceres, the first asteroid, and who had computed the orbit of the new planet in the remarkably short time of 10 hours. Gauss decided on the Roman virgin goddess of home and hearth, Vesta.|$|E

5|$|The {{partition}} {{treaty was}} ratified by its signatories on September 22, 1772. It {{was a major}} success for Frederick II of Prussia: Prussia's share {{might have been the}} smallest, but it was also significantly developed and strategically important. Prussia took most of Polish Royal Prussia, including Ermland, allowing Frederick to link East Prussia and Brandenburg. Prussia also annexed northern areas of Greater Poland along the Noteć River (the Netze District), and northern Kuyavia, but not the cities of Danzig (Gdańsk) and Thorn (Toruń). The territories annexed by Prussia became a new province in 1773 called West Prussia. Overall, Prussia gained 36,000km2 and about 600,000 people. According to Jerzy Surdykowski Frederick the Great soon introduced German colonists in territories he conquered and engaged in Germanization of Polish territories. Frederick II settled 26,000 Germans in Polish Pomerania which influenced the ethnic situation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>that</b> at the time had around 300,000 inhabitants, and enforced Germanization. According to Christopher Clark in certain areas annexed by Prussia like Notec and Royal Prussia 54 percent of the population (75 percent of the urban populace) were German-speaking Protestants. In the next century this was used by nationalistic German historians to justify the partition, but it was irrelevant to contemporary calculations: Frederick, dismissive of German culture, was instead pursuing an imperialist policy, acting on the security interests of his state. The new-gained territories connected Prussia with Germany proper, and were of major economic importance. By seizing northwestern Poland, Prussia instantly cut off Poland from the sea, and gained control of over 80% of the Commonwealth's total foreign trade. Through levying enormous custom duties, Prussia accelerated the inevitable collapse of the Polish–Lithuanian state.|$|E

40|$|A {{mesoscopic}} {{simulation of}} the process of human enamel laser ablation by Er:YAG and CO 2 lasers is being developed using the finite element method, taking into account the complex structure and chemical composition of this material. A geometric model that allows studying <b>in</b> detail <b>the</b> temperature, stress and displacement distribution within a few enamel rods is presented. The heat generation that takes place inside the enamel at the centre of the laser spot, caused by a non-ablative laser pulse emitted by CO 2 and Er:YAG lasers, was simulated. The sensitivity of our model to the estimated material parameters was studied. Temperature, displacement and stress distribution maps obtained for both lasers are presented. These preliminary results suggest that the temperature distribution across the enamel rods is different <b>in</b> <b>the</b> two situations considered; thermally induced stresses <b>in</b> <b>the</b> material are higher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>regions</b> <b>that</b> are richer <b>in</b> hydroxyapatite (HA), and the higher displacements are observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>regions</b> <b>that</b> are rich <b>in</b> water. <b>The</b> rod tails inside enamel present higher stresses <b>in</b> <b>the</b> direction perpendicular to the surface of enamel than the ones that are created at the surface of our simulated structure.
