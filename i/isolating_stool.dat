40|$|Yield {{per unit}} area {{increased}} rapidly to a maximum {{as the number of}} stools increased, and either remained relatively constant or declined slightly with higher stool densities, depending upon the particular component of yield. The results imply that under favourable growing conditions, maximum yield {{per unit area}} can be achieved with relatively low stool populations. There is considerable potential for reducing seedcane requirements and the number of harvestable stalks in irrigated fields. It may also be economically feasible to transplant nursery-grown seedlings into irrigated commercial fields. Comparisons of the yields of <b>isolated</b> <b>stools</b> of different varieties could be misleading because the relative performance of the same varieties can be different at high stool densities...|$|R
40|$|Enterococcus faecium has {{recently}} {{emerged as an}} important cause of nosocomial infections. We previously identified 15 predicted surface proteins with characteristics of MSCRAMMs and/or pili and demonstrated that their genes were frequently present in 30 clinical E. faecium isolates studied; one of these, acm, has been studied in further detail. To determine the prevalence of the other 14 genes among various E. faecium populations, we have now assessed 433 E. faecium isolates, including 264 isolates from human clinical infections, 69 <b>isolates</b> from <b>stools</b> of hospitalized patients, 70 <b>isolates</b> from <b>stools</b> of community volunteers, and 30 isolates from animal-related sources.

40|$|Campylobacter hyointestinalis was <b>isolated</b> from <b>stool</b> {{specimens}} of four persons, {{all of whom}} were experiencing nonbloody, watery diarrhea. The youngest (8 months of age) and the oldest (79 years of age) individuals were females, and the other two were homosexual men.

In case 3 (involving a 37 -year-old homosexual man), Entamoeba histolytica and Shigella sonnei were also present in the stool. The identification of all C. hyointestinalis strains was made biochemically and confirmed by DNA hybridization. This study documented the isolation of C. hyointestinalis from four patients with diarrhea, and our findings suggest that the clinical significance of Campylobacter species must be expanded to include C. hyointestinalis as a potential cause of human gastrointestinal disease...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Klebsiella oxytoca is an {{opportunistic}} pathogen which damages intestinal epithelium through producing cytotoxin tilivalline. This toxin {{plays a role}} in {{the pathogenesis}} of bacteria and is the main virulence factor which leads to antibiotic-associated hemorrhagic colitis progress. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, we collected a total of 75 K. oxytoca strains <b>isolated</b> from the <b>stool,</b> urine, blood, wounds, and sputum and evaluated them in terms of the production of toxins; we detected their cytotoxic effects on HEp- 2 cells. RESULTS: Of all the isolates, five K. oxytoca strains <b>isolated</b> from the <b>stool</b> cultures, two strains isolated from the blood cultures, one strains isolated from the wound cultures, and one strains isolated from the urine cultures had cytotoxic effects on HEp- 2 cells. The strains isolated from sputum cultures had no cytotoxic effects on HEp- 2 cells. CONCLUSIONS: In the current study, the majority of strains <b>isolated</b> from the <b>stool</b> of the patients included cytopathic effects on HEp- 2 cells. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|A {{method for}} rapid {{screening}} of isolates of pathogenic {{members of the}} family Enterobacteriaceae is described. Flow charts are used in conjunction with triple sugar iron agar, o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside-phenylalanine-motility sulfate screening media, oxidase test, and six rapid biochemical tests, namely, lysine decarboxylase, urease, indole, esculin hydrolysis, malonate, and xylose. This scheme is used to provide an inexpensive but rapid presumptive identification of Salmonella, Shigella, Edwardsiella, Aeromonas, Plesiomonas, Vibrio, and Yersinia <b>isolates</b> from <b>stool</b> cultures...|$|R

40|$|Production of cytotoxin and {{enterotoxin}} by Aeromonas strains {{obtained from}} stools of 50 children in Mexico and Texas and from blood of 9 children with sepsis was determined. Results {{were correlated with}} clinical features of infected {{children as well as}} with biochemical traits of Aeromonas strains. Cytotoxin was produced by 40 of 42 Aeromonas strains (95 %) <b>isolated</b> from <b>stools</b> of children with diarrhea, by all 8 <b>isolates</b> from <b>stools</b> of well children, and by all 9 isolates from children with sepsis. There was no difference in the quantities (amount of cytotoxin per milligram of protein required to kill 50 % of the cells) of cytotoxin produced and in clinical manifestations among the groups. None of the isolates produced a toxin that could be neutralized by antiserum raised against Shiga toxin produced by Shigella dysenteriae 1 60 R. Heat-labile-like enterotoxin (LT) was produced by 26 of 42 <b>stool</b> <b>isolates</b> (62 %), while only 1 of the 42 isolates (2 %) produced enterotoxinlike activity in suckling mice; 65 % of the cytotoxin-producing strains also produced an LT-like material. All strains from blood produced LT-like material, and 2 of 6 (33 %) produced activity in suckling mice. All strains produced hemolysin; 37 of 57 (65 %) were Voges-Proskauer positive; 27 of 57 (47 %) were lysine decarboxylase positive by API 20 E strips, none were positive for lysine decarboxylose production by lysin-iron agar slants at 24 h, but 17 of 54 (31 %) were positive at 48 h. There was no correlation between biochemical reactions and enterotoxin or cytotoxin production. There appears to be no correlation between toxin production by Aeromonas spp. and gastroenteritis...|$|R

40|$|Background: Foodborne antimicrobial-resistant Escherichia coli may colonize {{and cause}} infections in humans, but {{definitive}} proof is elusive and supportive evidence is limited.

40|$|Background. Late-onset sepsis is a {{major problem}} in neonatology, but the habitat of the {{pathogens}} before blood-stream invasion occurs is not well established. Methods. We examined prospectively collected stools from premature infants with sepsis to find pathogens that subsequently invaded their bloodstreams, and sought the same organisms in stools of infants without sepsis. Cul-ture-based techniques were used to <b>isolate</b> <b>stool</b> bacteria that provisionally matched the bloodstream organisms, which were then genome sequenced to confirm or refute commonality. Results. Of 11 children with late-onset neonatal bloodstream infections, 7 produced at least 1 stool that contained group B Streptococcus (GBS), Serratia marcescens, or Escherichia coli before their sepsis episode with provisionally matching organisms. Of 96 overlap comparison subjects without sepsis temporally associated with these cases, 4 were colonized with provisionally matching GBS or S. marcescens. Of 175 comparisons of stools from randomly selected infants without sepsis, 1 contained a GBS (this infant had also served as an overlap comparison subject and both specimens contained provisionally matching GBS). Genome sequencing confirmed common origin of provisionally matching fecal and blood isolates. The invasive E. coli were present in all presepti-cemic stools since birth, but gut colonization with GBS and S. marcescens occurred closer to time of bloodstream infection...|$|R
40|$|Thirty-three {{minimally}} passaged {{clinical and}} environmental isolates of Vibrio cholerae were examined for {{ability to survive}} and multiply in the upper bowel of infant mice and to elicit diarrhea. All of 21 smooth O- 1 V. cholerae <b>isolates</b> from <b>stool</b> were able to multiply and elicit diarrhea. Three rough strains <b>isolated</b> from <b>stool</b> were unable to multiply or to elicit diarrhea. Two smooth O- 1 isolates associated with cholera cases (from a sewer and a septic tank) also were able to cause disease. However, four O- 1 strains and one non-O- 1 strain from sources not associated with cholera cases did not cause mouse disease. A human gall bladder isolate was also avirulent, whereas a Louisiana shrimp isolated showed low mouse virulence. We conclude that smooth human diarrheal isolates of V. cholerae of serogroup O- 1 are virulent for infant mice. Examination of sequential isolates from single patients showed that some strains isolated later in infection had a reduced ability to induce diarrhea. Comparison of epidemiologically related strains showed that an isolate from crab had a low ability to induce disease in infant mice, whereas the isolates from patients showed the expected ability to multiply and elicit diarrhea in mice...|$|R
