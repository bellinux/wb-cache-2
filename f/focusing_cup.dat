Might they bring people together to solve common problems, overcoming differences inperspective brought about by specific organisational affiliations and personal backgrounds? Data includes: a literature review, semi-structured interviews and <b>focus</b> groups with <b>CUP</b> members, and Chicago fieldwork. Our study developed the research capacity of a local practitioner who shared the project's learning within his ethnic minority community and beyond. Data analysis indicated the versatility of the CoP approach for individuals working inpartnership across boundaries (for example voluntary, statutory and university sectors). Strikingly, our literature review shows little application of the CoP approach to CUPs,beyond our own limited work. In the literature, CoPs are critiqued for not dealing explicitly with inequalities; while they may offer space to address differences, there is limited analysis of how CoPs work through inter-group conflicts. However our empirical data revealed more potential. Given this promise, future research priorities include (1) empirical studies of CoPs designed to provide effective mechanisms for developing cohesion and learning, and (2) enhancing the role of community partners in co-production and community knowledge exchange...|$|R

40|$|Depth discontinuity-based cup {{segmentation}} from multi-view colour retinal images Gopal Datt Joshi, Member, IEEE,,Jayanthi Sivaswamy Member, IEEE,, S. R. Krishnadas. Abstract—Accurate segmentation {{of the cup}} region from retinal {{images is}} needed to derive relevant measurements for glaucoma assessment. A novel, depth discontinuity (in the retinal surface) based approach to estimate the cup boundary is proposed in this paper. The proposed approach shifts <b>focus</b> from the <b>cup</b> region used by existing approaches to cup boundary. The given set of images, acquired sequentially, are related via a relative motion model and the depth discontinuity at the cup boundary is determined from cues such as motion boundary and partial occlusion. The information encoded by these cues is used to approximate the cup boundary {{with a set of}} best fit circles. The final boundary is found by considering points on these circles at different sectors using a confidence measure. Four different kinds of datasets ranging from synthetic to real image pairs, covering different multi-view scenarios, have been used to evaluate the proposed method. The proposed method was found to yield an error reduction of 16 % for cup-to-disk vertical diameter ratio (CDR) and 13 % for cup-to-disk area ratio (CAR) estimation, over an existing monocular image based cup segmentation method. The error reduction increased to 33 % in CDR and 18 % CAR {{with the addition of a}} third view (image) which indicates the potential of the proposed approach.

50|$|Although {{successful}} commercially, Process 2 {{was plagued}} with technical problems. Because {{the images on}} {{the two sides of}} the print were not in the same plane, both could not be perfectly in focus at the same time. The significance of this depended on the depth of field of the projection optics. Much more serious was a problem with cupping. Films in general tended to become somewhat cupped after repeated use: every time a film was projected, each frame in turn was heated by the intense light in the projection gate, causing it to bulge slightly; after it had passed through the gate, it cooled and the bulge subsided, but not quite completely. It was found that the cemented prints were not only very prone to cupping, but that the direction of cupping would suddenly and randomly change from back to front or vice versa, so that even the most attentive projectionist could not prevent the image from temporarily popping out of <b>focus</b> whenever the <b>cupping</b> direction changed. Technicolor had to supply new prints so the cupped ones could be shipped to their Boston laboratory for flattening, after which they could be put back into service, at least for a while. The presence of image layers on both surfaces made the prints especially vulnerable to scratching, and because the scratches were vividly colored they were very noticeable. Splicing a Process 2 print without special attention to its unusual laminated construction was apt to result in a weak splice that would fail as it passed through the projector. Even before these problems became apparent, Technicolor regarded this cemented print approach as a stopgap and was already at work developing an improved process.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this Master´s Thesis was to conduct a wide scale preliminary survey regarding the package requirements of a cultured dairy package, and to compare the currently used material polystyrene to other suitable packaging materials. Polystyrene {{has a long history}} of use in dairy cups, but in recent years its price has increased significantly compared to other common packaging materials. The overall environmental effects of a package and a package material are today a part of designing a sustainable product life cycle. In addition, in certain contexts there has been discussion of the risks posed by styrene polymer for the environment and for humans. These risks are also discussed in this thesis. Polystyrene (PS) is still the most widely used material in dairy cups. In recent years, polypropylene (PP) cups have appeared in increasing numbers on market shelves. This study focuses on the differences of the suitable polymers and examines the suitability of alternative “suitable” polymers with regards to dairy packaging. Aside from <b>focusing</b> on the <b>cup</b> manufacturer, this thesis also examines its subject matter from the viewpoint of the dairy customer, as well as observing the concrete implications of material changes in the overall value chain. It was known in advance that material permeability would be one of the determining factors and that gas transmission testing would be a significant part of the thesis. Mechanical tests were the second part of the testing process, providing information regarding package strength and protectiveness during the package’s life cycle. Production efficiency, along with uninterrupted stable production, was another important factor that was taken into consideration. These two issues are sometimes neglected in similar contexts due to their self-evident nature. In addition, materials used in production may have a surprising significance to the production and efficiency. Consistent high quality is also partly based on material selection. All of the aforementioned factors have been documented and the results have been analyzed by the development team at Coveris Rigid Finland. Coveris is now calculating the total finance effects and capacities should the material changes be implemented in practice. There are many factors in favor of switching to polypropylene at the moment. The overall production costs, as well as the environmental effects of resin production are the primary influences for said switch from the converters’ perspective...|$|R
