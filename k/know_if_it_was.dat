It was just a really gnarly, gnarly guitar sound. We've gotten some since, but they've been a different kind. I think it {{had more to do}} with the actual electromagnetic chemistry of what was going through our amps that day. It was just a cool, fried-out sound.|$|E
5|$|For a subplot, Chaplin first {{considered}} a character even {{lower on the}} social scale, a black newsboy. Eventually he opted for a drunken millionaire, a character previously used in the 1921 short The Idle Class. The millionaire plot {{was based on an}} old idea Chaplin had for a short in which two millionaires pick up the Little Tramp from the city dump and show him a good time in expensive clubs before dropping him back off at the dump, so when he woke up, the Tramp would not <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> real or a dream. This was rewritten into a millionaire who is a friend of the Tramp when drunk but does not recognize him when sober.|$|E

500|$|Not all reviews were positive. Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad {{reported}} that this episode {{was an odd}} one produced by the show. [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the off-balance tone the episode had because {{two of the three}} plots took place outside, but it just wasn't as good as most episodes." [...] Brad Sanders of the Indiana Daily Student called Jenna and Kenneth's plot a travesty, commenting that the two along with Grammer scamming Carvel was [...] "diabolical, and definitely not funny enough to justify the horribleness". In regards to the episode, itself, Sanders wrote that it was [...] "mostly awful".|$|E
500|$|Along with The Dark Knight Returns, Tim Burton has {{mentioned}} that The Killing Joke influenced his film adaptation of Batman: [...] "I {{was never a}} giant comic book fan, but I've always loved the image of Batman and the Joker. The reason I've never been a comic book fan — and I think it started when I was a child — is because I could never tell which box I was supposed to read. I don't <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> dyslexia or whatever, but that's why I loved The Killing Joke, because {{for the first time}} I could tell which one to read. It's my favorite. It's the first comic I've ever loved. And the success of those graphic novels made our ideas more acceptable." ...|$|E

500|$|Hill {{attended}} Columbia High School, {{where she}} was a member of the track team, a cheerleader and was a classmate of Zach Braff. She also took violin lessons, went to dance class, and founded the school's gospel choir. Academically, she took advanced placement classes and received primarily 'A' grades. School officials recognized her as a leader among the student body. Later recalling her education, Hill commented, [...] "I had a love for – I don't <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> necessarily for academics, more than it just was for achieving, period. If it was academics, if it was sports, if it was music, if it was dance, whatever it was, I was always driven to do a lot in whatever field or whatever area I was focusing on at the moment." ...|$|E
500|$|Reagan met actress Nancy Davis (1921–2016) in 1949 {{after she}} {{contacted}} {{him in his}} capacity as president of the Screen Actors Guild. [...] He helped her with issues regarding her name appearing on a Communist blacklist in Hollywood. She had been mistaken for another Nancy Davis. She described their meeting by saying, [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> exactly love at first sight, but it was pretty close." [...] They were engaged at Chasen's restaurant in Los Angeles and were married on March 4, 1952, at the Little Brown Church in the Valley (North Hollywood, now Studio City) San Fernando Valley. Actor William Holden served as best man at the ceremony. They had two children: Patti (born October 21, 1952) and Ronald [...] "Ron" [...] Jr. (born May 20, 1958).|$|E
500|$|Overall, Yield {{resembles the}} {{straightforward}} rock {{approach of the}} band's early work. Gossard said, [...] "The songs {{were a little bit}} more structured. I don't <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> poppier, but it seemed more professional." [...] O'Brien noted that during the Yield sessions, the band made a conscious effort to create more accessible songs. Tom Sinclair of Entertainment Weekly stated that the band has [...] "turned in an intermittently affecting album that veers between fiery garage rock and rootsy, acoustic-based ruminations. Perhaps mindful of their position as the last alt-rock ambassadors with any degree of clout, they've come up with their most cohesive album since their 1991 debut, Ten." [...] "Given to Fly", the album's first single, was noted for its similarity to Led Zeppelin's [...] "Going to California" [...] from the 1971 album, Led Zeppelin IV.|$|E

500|$|Engineering of {{the song}} was done by Emily Wright and Sam Holland at Conway Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California. While Kesha was {{in the studio with}} Dr. Luke and Blanco, she took three takes to get the song correct as she jokingly [...] "white-girl rapped" [...] over the beat. At one point in the song's production, she had wanted to re-write the verses {{of the song}} because she did not think that they were [...] "funny or clever", feeling that they [...] "kind of sucked." [...] She elaborated, [...] "I thought it was just another song, I thought it was just like all the other ones I'd written. I didn't even <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> very good. I wanted to rewrite the verses, I didn't think it was funny or clever. I thought it kind of sucked. But {{everyone}} else liked it." [...] Kesha ultimately did not end up rewriting any of the song's lyrics. She further described the theme of the song in an interview, emphasizing that it embodied her own lifestyle, ...|$|E
500|$|After leaving Boston, Phips {{searched the}} picked over wrecks in the Bahamas with limited success. Too many other {{treasure}} hunters {{had already gone}} before. [...] When some of his crew became mutinous, he had them put off in Jamaica. On November 18, 1684, Phips was in Port Royal, Jamaica {{the same time as}} Captain Stanley of the Bonetta. [...] There is no record of their joining forces or sharing information. [...] It seems likely they met up but we don't <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> preordained. If Phips was unwittingly being used as a decoy to distract the other treasure hunters away from Stanley, it might have dawned on him at this time. Soon after Phips visited the north coast of Hispaniola and slowly cruised north exploring the banks where Stanley had been diligently searching for over a year. The decisiveness with which Phips later returned and quickly located the treasure suggests {{that he was able to}} gather valuable knowledge and begin to formulate a clear plan, though he would have to wait two years to bring it to fruition.|$|E
500|$|The {{increased}} {{presence of}} humans {{in the water}} proved {{a factor in the}} attacks: [...] "As the worldwide human population continues to rise year after year, so does... interest in aquatic recreation. The number of shark attacks in any given year or region is highly influenced by the number of people entering the water." [...] However, the likelihood that one shark was involved is contested. Scientists such as Victor M. Coppleson and Jean Butler, relying on evidence presented by Lucas and Murphy in 1916, assert that a single shark was responsible. On the other hand, Richard Fernicola notes that 1916 was a [...] "shark year" [...] as fishermen and captains were reporting hundreds of sharks swimming in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States. Ellis remarks that [...] "to try to make the facts as we know them conform to the 'rogue shark' theory is stretching sensationalism and credibility beyond reasonable limits." [...] He admits, [...] "The evidence is long gone, and we will never really <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> one shark or several, one species or another, that was responsible." ...|$|E

500|$|Whiteread's agent Karsten Schubert said, [...] "The {{whole affair}} was a non-event. They {{achieved}} nothing {{and they were}} left looking like real prats." [...] Peter Chater, a director of Schubert's agency concurred; he called Drummond and Cauty [...] "cowards". [...] "It was obviously a publicity stunt. What sort of statement {{they were trying to}} make I don't <b>know.</b> <b>If</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{anything to do with the}} relationship between art and money it was pretty crass. The KLF made a fortune from a couple of successful singles. Artists aren't in that position. Threatening to set light to £40,000 is pretty obscene." [...] Former Factory Records boss Tony Wilson applauded the group, however. [...] "The K Foundation is a very peculiar avant garde group whose ideas are as valid anything the Turner people do," [...] he told NME. [...] "Since when has there been laws governing what constitutes art, or an artistic statement? OK, so a lot of people don't understand what Bill and Jimmy are trying to say, but how many people know exactly what Rachel Whiteread's trying to say with her art?" ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} for The Emancipation of Mimi (2005), Jozen Cummings from PopMatters {{described}} the song's production and instrumentation: [...] "The track is vintage Neptunes with big drums and intergalactic sound effects, and Carey {{adds to the}} breezy, easygoing feel of the song with a voice that is sexy, but subtle, like a shy woman who doesn’t need to {{say anything at all}} to get a man’s attention." [...] Lyrically, [...] "Say Somethin'" [...] recalls an encounter in which a male expresses interest in having a sexual affair in a bathroom with a female, while she agrees and responds [...] "If its worth you're while / Say somethin' good to me". In an interview with Newsweek, Carey described how she felt regarding the song: [...] "You're right. It is a totally different approach for me musically. When I heard it at first I thought it was a cool and interesting track, but I didn't <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> very me." [...] Additionally, Carey outed the lines [...] "Something like volcanic / You and me seems organic / Just like stars and planets" [...] as [...] "nonesense", but claimed she [...] "loved it".|$|E
500|$|For obZen, Haake {{returned}} to the drum kit most notably with his performance on the song [...] "Bleed". In an interview for Gravemusic.com, Haake stated, [...] " [...] was a big effort for me to learn, I {{had to find a}} totally new approach to playing the double bass drums {{to be able to do}} that stuff. I had never really done anything like that before like the fast bursts that go all the way through the song basically. So I actually spent as much time practicing that track alone as I did with all of the other tracks combined. It's kind of a big feat to change your approach like that and I'm glad we were able to nail it for the album. For a while though we didn't even <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> going to make it to the album." [...] Hagström also stated, [...] "obZen is one of the most highly technical offerings the band has ever put to tape". Revolver magazine confirms this statement: [...] "At first listen, obZen seems less challenging to the listener than some of the band's other records, and most of the songs flow smoothly from one syncopated passage to the next. However, careful examination reveals that the material is some of the group's most complicated".|$|E

500|$|The {{sessions}} were particularly difficult for DeLonge, who suffered chronic back pain. [...] "When your back is killing {{you and you}} have to have surgery and all this stuff, it's just kind of hard to keep a focus on the happier times in your life," [...] he told MTV News. [...] "You end up writing all these songs about feeling sad and confused." [...] He often could only stand and sing for five minutes at a time before having to lay down again. Journalist Joe Shooman writes that the album followed a DIY spirit, rather than spending [...] "months and months refining and polishing everything for a major label and international pop market." [...] DeLonge intended to pay for the project himself, but when an A representative heard four unfinished songs, MCA—the record label Blink-182 was on—wanted to finance the album. DeLonge's manager convinced him it would be a bad idea to pass up someone else paying for its distribution. According to Boukas, an MCA representative dropped in on the sessions and was pleased with what he heard. [...] "When we wrote this album, we didn't <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> going to be on a label or if we were going to put it out ourselves," [...] Barker said at the time. [...] "Once MCA jumped on board, it was kind of like, [...] "Whatever! That's cool. Cheers! Put it out, we don't really care!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Xerneas {{is a large}} stag-like Pokémon {{adorned with}} glowing antlers and Yveltal is a large {{y-shaped}} bird. Part of a Legendary trio alongside Zygarde, the designs of Xerneas and Yveltal are rooted in Norse Mythology. Xerneas traces to the Eikþyrnir, a stag that stands atop Valhalla, while Yveltal is inspired by the Hræsvelgr, a giant eagle {{able to make the}} wind blow by flapping its wings. Some fans speculate that the two Pokémon also draw inspiration from the three layers of an organism in biology: neurons (Xerneas), blood vessels and muscles (Yveltal), and endodermal tissue (Zygarde). When asked about this theory by Kotaku, J.C. Smith of The Pokémon Company International stated he personally did not <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> true but called the idea [...] "fascinating and well thought out".|$|E
