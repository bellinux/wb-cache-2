5|$|Fishers {{have five}} toes on <b>each</b> <b>foot,</b> with unsheathed, {{retractable}} claws. Their feet are disproportionately large for their legs, {{making it easier}} for them to move on top of snow packs. In addition to the toes, there are four central pads on <b>each</b> <b>foot.</b> On the hind paws there are coarse hairs that grow between the pads and the toes, giving them added traction when walking on a variety of surfaces. Fishers have highly mobile ankle joints that can rotate their hind paws almost 180 degrees, allowing them to maneuver well in trees and climb down head-first. The fisher is one of relatively few mammalian species with the ability to descend trees head-first.|$|E
5|$|Parrots {{are small}} to large birds with a {{characteristic}} curved beak. Their upper mandibles have slight mobility {{in the joint}} with the skull {{and they have a}} generally erect stance. All parrots are zygodactyl, having the four toes on <b>each</b> <b>foot</b> placed two at the front and two to the back.|$|E
5|$|The {{amount of}} film {{used for the}} picture was uncharacteristic for the time and {{was a sign of}} the long {{production}} process. Chaplin shot 314,256 feet of film, and the completed film ran 8,093 feet. This made a shooting ratio of almost 39 feet of film for <b>each</b> <b>foot</b> of film that made it in the final version.|$|E
50|$|Like {{the other}} types of tapir, they have small, stubby tails and long, {{flexible}} proboscises. They have four toes on <b>each</b> front <b>foot</b> and three toes on <b>each</b> back <b>foot,</b> <b>each</b> with large nails and supported by a padded sole. A patch of bare skin, pale pink or grey in colour, extends just above each toe.|$|R
50|$|Some {{odd-toed}} ungulates (equids) have one hoof on each foot; others have (or had) three distinct hooved or heavily nailed toes, or one hoof and two dewclaws. The tapir {{is a special}} case, having three toes on <b>each</b> hind <b>foot</b> and four toes on <b>each</b> front <b>foot.</b>|$|R
50|$|The higher {{systolic}} {{reading of}} {{the left and right}} arm brachial artery is generally used in the assessment. The pressures in <b>each</b> <b>foot's</b> posterior tibial artery and dorsalis pedis artery are measured with the higher of the two values used as the ABI for that leg.|$|R
5|$|Lambeosaurus {{was like}} other hadrosaurids, and could move on both two legs and all fours, {{as shown by}} {{footprints}} of related animals. It had a long tail stiffened by ossified tendons that prevented it from drooping. The hands had four fingers, lacking the innermost finger of the generalized five-fingered tetrapod hand, while the second, third, and fourth fingers were bunched together and bore hooves, suggesting the animal could have used the hands for support. The fifth finger was free and {{could be used to}} manipulate objects. <b>Each</b> <b>foot</b> had only the three central toes.|$|E

5|$|The Priory Church of St George is {{predominantly}} 15th century {{with evidence of}} 12th- and 13th century work. It has been designated as a Grade I listed building. The church was started by William de Moyon during the 11th century. The tower was built by Jon Marys of Stogursey who received a contract from the parish in 1442. He was paid 13s 4d (approx. 67p) for <b>each</b> <b>foot</b> in height and £1 for the pinnacles. The work was completed in three years. Aisles were added in 1504.|$|E
5|$|All bovids {{have the}} similar basic form - a snout with a blunt end, {{one or more}} pairs of horns (generally present on males) {{immediately}} after the oval or pointed ears, a distinct neck and limbs, and a tail varying in length and bushiness among the species. Most bovids exhibit sexual dimorphism, with males usually larger as well as heavier than females. Sexual dimorphism is more prominent in medium- to large-sized bovids. All bovids have four toes on <b>each</b> <b>foot</b> – they walk on the central two (the hooves), while the outer two (the dewclaws) are much smaller and rarely touch the ground.|$|E
5|$|Silkies {{appear in}} two {{distinct}} varieties: bearded and non-bearded. Bearded Silkies {{have an extra}} muff of feathers under the beak area that covers the earlobes. They also are separated according to color. Colors of Silkie recognized for competitive showing include black, blue, buff, grey, partridge, and white. Alternative hues, such as cuckoo, lavender, red, and splash also exist. The standards of perfection call for all Silkies to have a small walnut-colored comb, dark wattles, and turquoise-blue earlobes. In addition to these defining characteristics, Silkies have five toes on <b>each</b> <b>foot.</b> Other breeds which exhibit this rare trait include the Dorking, Faverolles, and Sultan.|$|E

5|$|The {{selective}} {{pressure that}} shaped the original lemuriform toothcomb {{has been a}} topic of considerable debate since the 1970s. Evidence {{can be seen as}} supporting a grooming function, food procurement function, or both. In the early 1900s, there was less debate. Grooming was seen as the primary function since primates lack the claws needed to adequately comb the fur, although prosimian primates (strepsirrhines and tarsiers) possess at least one grooming claw on <b>each</b> <b>foot</b> to compensate. Grooming—in the form of fur-combing—is generally considered the primary function and original role of the lemuriform toothcomb, and subsequent changes in morphology across multiple lineages have altered its function and obscured its original function.|$|E
5|$|Abra, Kadabra, and Alakazam are bipedal Pokémon {{characterized}} by their humanoid body structure and somewhat fox-like appearance. They {{look like they}} are wearing armor, as they have two pauldron-shaped pieces on their shoulders and a fauld-like piece around their chest. Abra, Kadabra, and Alakazam have three fingers on each hand and three toes on <b>each</b> <b>foot,</b> with two toes in the front on either side {{and one in the}} back near the ankle. Abra and Kadabra also have thick tails the same gold color as the rest of its body, except for a brown band located near the top. Kadabra and Alakazam have relatively large mustaches, which are shorter in female species. Kadabra has a red star-shaped symbol on its forehead, and three red wavy lines on its fauld-like torso. After evolving into Alakazam, the creatures no longer have the Zener markings and tails, while their heads become much larger, resulting in extremely powerful mental powers. Alakazam undergoes slight changes upon Mega Evolving into Mega Alakazam, as its overall color scheme becomes slightly paler, it gains a white beard alongside its now white mustache, a considerably thinner torso, and a red gem-like organ on its forehead.|$|E
5|$|Slow lorises have a {{powerful}} grasp with both their hands and feet due to several specializations. They can tightly grasp branches with little effort because of a special muscular arrangement in their hands and feet, where the thumb diverges at nearly 180° {{from the rest of}} the fingers, while the hallux (big toe) ranges between being perpendicular and pointing slightly backwards. The toes have a large flexor muscle that originates on the lower end of the thigh bone, which helps to impart a strong grasping ability to the hind limbs. The second digit of the hand is short compared to the other digits, while on the foot, the fourth toe is the longest. The sturdy thumb helps to act like a clamp when digits three, four, and five grasp the opposite side of a tree branch. This gives their hands and feet a pincer-like appearance. The strong grip can be held for hours without losing sensation due to the presence of a rete mirabile (network of capillaries), a trait shared among all lorises. Both slender and slow lorises have relatively short feet. Like nearly all lemuriforms, they have a grooming claw on the second toe of <b>each</b> <b>foot.</b>|$|E
50|$|Hyraxes inhabit rocky terrain across sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East. Their feet have rubbery pads with {{numerous}} sweat glands, which may help the animal maintain its grip when quickly moving up steep, rocky surfaces. Hyraxes have stumpy toes with hoof-like nails; {{there are four}} toes on <b>each</b> front <b>foot</b> and three on <b>each</b> back <b>foot.</b> They also have efficient kidneys, retaining water {{so that they can}} better survive in arid environments.|$|R

5|$|Strepsirrhines {{are defined}} by their wet nose or rhinarium. They also have a smaller brain than comparably sized simians, large {{olfactory}} lobes for smell, a vomeronasal organ to detect pheromones, and a bicornuate uterus with an epitheliochorial placenta. Their eyes contain a reflective layer to improve their night vision, and their eye sockets include a ring of bone around the eye, but they lack a wall of thin bone behind it. Strepsirrhine primates produce their own vitamin C, whereas haplorhine primates must obtain it from their diets. Lemuriform primates are characterized by a toothcomb, a specialized set of teeth in the front, {{lower part of the}} mouth mostly used for combing fur during grooming. Often, the toothcomb is incorrectly used to characterize all strepsirrhines. Instead, it is unique to lemuriforms and is not seen among adapiforms. Lemuriforms groom orally, and also possess a grooming claw on the second toe of <b>each</b> <b>foot</b> for scratching in areas that are inaccessible to the mouth and tongue. It is unclear whether adapiforms possessed grooming claws.|$|E
5|$|The Silkie (sometimes spelled Silky) is a {{breed of}} chicken {{named for its}} atypically fluffy plumage, which is said to feel like silk, and satin. The breed has several other unusual qualities, such as black skin and bones, blue earlobes, and five toes on <b>each</b> <b>foot,</b> whereas most {{chickens}} only have four. They are often exhibited in poultry shows, and appear in various colors. In addition to their distinctive physical characteristics, Silkies are well known for their calm, friendly temperament. It {{is among the most}} docile of poultry. Hens are also exceptionally broody, and care for young well. Though they are fair layers themselves, laying only about three eggs a week, they are commonly used to hatch eggs from other breeds and bird species due to their broody nature. Silkie chickens are very easy to keep as pets. They are suitable for children, as they can easily withstand being roughly handled.|$|E
5|$|The arms of I. bernissartensis {{were long}} (up to 75% {{the length of}} the legs) and robust, with rather {{inflexible}} hands built so that the three central fingers could bear weight. The thumbs were conical spikes that stuck out away from the three main digits. In early restorations, the spike was placed on the animal's nose. Later fossils revealed {{the true nature of the}} thumb spikes, although their exact function is still debated. They could have been used for defense, or for foraging for food. The little finger was elongated and dextrous, and could have been used to manipulate objects. The phalangeal formula is 2-3-3-2-4, meaning that the innermost finger (phalange) has two bones, the next has three, etc. The legs were powerful, but not built for running, and <b>each</b> <b>foot</b> had three toes. The backbone and tail were supported and stiffened by ossified tendons, which were tendons that turned to bone during life (these rod-like bones are usually omitted from skeletal mounts and drawings).|$|E
50|$|Hyracotherium {{averaged}} 78 cm (2.5 feet) {{in length}} and weighed about 9 kg (20 pounds). It had four-hoofed toes on <b>each</b> front <b>foot</b> and three-hoofed toes on <b>each</b> hind <b>foot.</b> <b>Each</b> toe had a pad on its underside, {{similar to those of}} a dog. It had a short face with eye sockets in the middle and a short diastema (the space between the front teeth and the cheek teeth). The skull was long, having 44 low-crowned teeth. Although it had low-crowned teeth, the beginnings of the characteristic horse-like ridges on the molars can be seen. Hyracotherium {{is believed to have been}} a browsing herbivore that ate primarily soft leaves as well as some fruits and nuts and plant shoots.|$|R

5|$|The forelimbs of Allosaurus {{were short}} in {{comparison}} to the hindlimbs (only about 35% the length of the hindlimbs in adults) and had three fingers per hand, tipped with large, strongly curved and pointed claws. The arms were powerful, and the forearm was somewhat shorter than the upper arm (1:1.2ulna/humerus ratio). The wrist had a version of the semilunate carpal also found in more derived theropods like maniraptorans. Of the three fingers, the innermost (or thumb) was the largest, and diverged from the others. The phalangeal formula is 2-3-4-0-0, meaning that the innermost finger (phalange) has two bones, the next has three, and the third finger has four. The legs were not as long or suited for speed as those of tyrannosaurids, and the claws of the toes were less developed and more hoof-like than those of earlier theropods. <b>Each</b> <b>foot</b> had three weight-bearing toes and an inner dewclaw, which Madsen suggested could have been used for grasping in juveniles. There was also what is interpreted as the splint-like remnant of a fifth (outermost) metatarsal, perhaps used as a lever between the Achilles tendon and foot.|$|E
5|$|Woodpeckers, piculets and wrynecks all possess {{characteristic}} zygodactyl feet, {{consisting of}} four toes, the first (hallux) {{and the fourth}} facing backward and {{the second and third}} facing forward. This foot arrangement is good for grasping the limbs and trunks of trees. Members of this family can walk vertically up a tree trunk, which is beneficial for activities such as foraging for food or nest excavation. In addition to their strong claws and feet, woodpeckers have short, strong legs. This is typical of birds that regularly forage on trunks. Exceptions are the black-backed woodpecker and the American and Eurasian three-toed woodpeckers, which have only three toes on <b>each</b> <b>foot.</b> The tails of all woodpeckers, except the piculets and wrynecks, are stiffened, and when the bird perches on a vertical surface, the tail and feet work together to support it.|$|E
