6000|$|On the morrow, as Rebecca was <b>gazing</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> window, she startled Miss Crawley, who was placidly {{occupied}} with a French novel, by crying {{out in an}} alarmed tone, [...] "Here's Sir Pitt, Ma'am!" [...] and the Baronet's knock followed this announcement.|$|R
60|$|In {{due time}} {{the shores of}} Italy were sighted, and as we stood <b>gazing</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> decks, early in the bright summer morning, the stately city of Genoa rose {{up out of the}} sea and flung back <b>the</b> {{sunlight}} <b>from</b> her hundred palaces.|$|R
