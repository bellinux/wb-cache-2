5|$|In 1992, Charles Cecil began {{researching the}} Knights Templar {{for the game}} after he, Noirin Carmody and Sean Brennan {{conceived}} Broken Sword. It was built with Revolution's Virtual Theatre engine. This was also used for the company's previous two games. Cecil co-wrote and directed the game, while Eoghan Cahill and Neil Breen drew the backgrounds <b>in</b> <b>pencil</b> and digitally colored them in Photoshop. The game has a serious tone, but features humor and graphics {{in the style of}} classic animated films.|$|E
5|$|The team at Revolution {{had high}} {{expectations}} for Broken Sword, but there was significant competition. Revolution had a team that had created successful adventure games, but believed they needed to utilise the best of other creative industries. Eoghan Cahill and Neil Breen of Dublin's Don Bluth studios drew the backgrounds <b>in</b> <b>pencil</b> and digitally colored them in Photoshop. The introductory sequence and the main characters were done by animator Mike Burgess, {{who worked for the}} Red Rover animation studio. The game's graphics were animated in a style resembling classic animated films.|$|E

5|$|Universal {{sold the}} film to PRC for $125,000, which {{represented}} the negative cost plus interest. The transaction occurred around August 1946, but was not made public until it was screened for the trade press on October1, marking its official release date. The sale occurred so quickly and hastily on the copyright files stores at the Library of Congress, the name Universal Pictures was crossed out and Pathe Industries, PRC's corporate body, was written in its place <b>in</b> <b>pencil.</b> Some pressbook advertisements circulated for the film still included the Universal Pictures logo. PRC had previously produced a horror film about acromegaly called The Monster Maker (1944), in which a mad scientist injects human subjects with the disease {{as part of his}} experiments.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of The Castle of Cagliostro, Miyazaki began working on his ideas for an {{animated}} film adaptation of Richard Corben's comic book Rowlf and pitched the idea to Yutaka Fujioka at TMS. In November 1980, a proposal was drawn up to acquire the film rights. Around that time, Miyazaki was also approached {{for a series of}} magazine articles by the editorial staff of Animage. During subsequent conversations, he showed his sketchbooks and discussed basic outlines for envisioned animation projects with editors Toshio Suzuki and Osamu Kameyama, who saw the potential for collaboration on their development into animation. Two projects were proposed: , to be set in the Sengoku period; and the adaptation of Corben's Rowlf. Both were rejected, as the company was unwilling to fund anime projects not based on existing manga, and the rights for the adaptation of Rowlf could not be secured. An agreement was reached that Miyazaki could start developing his sketches and ideas into a manga for the magazine with the proviso that it would never be made into a film. The manga—titled Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind—ran from February 1982 to March 1994. The story, as re-printed in the tankōbon volumes, spans seven volumes for a combined total of 1060 pages. Miyazaki drew the episodes primarily <b>in</b> <b>pencil,</b> and it was printed monochrome in sepia toned ink. Miyazaki resigned from Telecom Animation Film in November 1982.|$|E
5|$|The designers' {{goal was}} to create a visual bridge between comic and video game graphics. Gibbons drew the {{backgrounds}} <b>in</b> <b>pencil,</b> starting with roughs, which were sent to Revolution to see if they were technically feasible. Once agreed upon, Gibbons would then make the final sketch. The pencil sketches were then colored, mainly by Les Pace. The backgrounds were scanned on a Macintosh as 24-bit, 1000x1000 pixel images with 16 million colors, and then transformed to 8-bit, 320x200 pixel images with 256 colors for the PC version. The backgrounds were designed so that the sprites would appear clear on the screen and wouldn't mix with the backgrounds. Gibbons created the sprites using Deluxe Paint on an Amiga. Steve Ince, who joined the team in February 1993, created a number of sprite animations, also painting some backgrounds based on Gibbons's sketches. Gibbons also designed the characters, although he found it challenging to get a character's personality and expression in a face that was only around seven pixels wide and nine pixels high with a limited palette. He would have liked to design a character in a similar manner to Prince of Persia or Flashback, but Revolution wanted something more detailed, so the result became a compromise. All character sprites are smoothly animated with around 20 positions each. According to Gibbons, about 75% of the backgrounds and characters he designed were used in the game.|$|E

25|$|Miyazaki {{drew the}} Nausicaä episodes {{primarily}} <b>in</b> <b>pencil.</b> The work was printed monochrome in sepia toned ink. Frederik L. Schodt observed differences between Nausicaä and other Japanese manga. He {{has noted that}} it was serialized in the large A4 size of Animage, {{much larger than the}} normal size for manga. Schodt has also observed that Miyazaki drew much of Nausicaä <b>in</b> <b>pencil</b> without inking, and that the page and panel layouts, as well as the heavy reliance on storytelling, are more reminiscent of French comics than of Japanese manga. In appearance and sensibilities, Nausicaä reminds Schodt of the works of Mœbius.|$|E

25|$|Organized by his {{publisher}} Diogenes Verlag in 1982, {{the first}} major exhibition of 63 drawings by Fellini was held in Paris, Brussels, and the Pierre Matisse Gallery in New York. A gifted caricaturist, much of the inspiration for his sketches was derived from his own dreams while the films-in-progress both originated from and stimulated drawings for characters, decor, costumes and set designs. Under the title, I disegni di Fellini (Fellini’s Designs), he published 350 drawings executed <b>in</b> <b>pencil,</b> watercolours, and felt pens.|$|E

A component of the MDF is protection: fuses or other devices that protect the switch from lightning, shorts with electric power lines, or other foreign voltages. In a typical telephone company, a large database tracks information about each subscriber pair and the status of each jumper.

25|$|As we have seen, Wagner {{sketched out}} {{the theme for}} the Ride of the Valkyries on 23 July 1851; other than this, the {{earliest}} musical sketches for Die Walküre date from the summer of 1852. But {{it was not until}} 28 June 1854 that Wagner began to transform these into a complete draft of all three acts of the opera. This preliminary draft (Gesamtentwurf), which was completed by 27 December 1854, was written <b>in</b> <b>pencil</b> and shows a greater degree of orchestral elaboration than the corresponding draft of Das Rheingold.|$|E
25|$|The {{composition}} of Das Rheingold occupied Wagner from 1 November 1853 to 26 September 1854. He began {{by developing a}} preliminary draft (Gesamtentwurf) of the entire work from his sketches. This 77-page draft, which was written <b>in</b> <b>pencil</b> and on two (sometimes three) staves, was completed by 14 January 1854. The following month (1 February) he proceeded to make a second complete draft. It seems that his first intention {{was to make a}} composition draft in ink, just as he had done for Lohengrin, but as such a draft of the opening Prelude – which consists of little more than an arpeggiated E♭ major triad – would have been to all intents and purposes a full score, he decided to skip the intermediate stage and draft the full score in ink right away. This he proceeded to do with the Prelude, significantly revising some of its details in the process. When, however, he reached the beginning of Scene 1, he found that the remainder of the opera required too much revision and elaboration to allow him to develop a full score without first making a second complete draft. He therefore abandoned the full score in ink and proceeded to develop instead an instrumentation draft <b>in</b> <b>pencil,</b> in which he worked out most of the vocal and orchestral details of the four remaining scenes. This Instrumentationsskizze, as Wagner himself styled it, was completed by 28 May 1854.|$|E

25|$|The {{business}} {{was a struggle}} at first, however in ten years' time he had sharpened his skills to perfection.

Munroe took the lead <b>in</b> manufacturing <b>pencils</b> <b>in</b> the United States from that time forward {{as long as he was}} <b>in</b> the <b>pencil</b> business. He also make ever-pointed-pencil leads that were very popular.|$|R

25|$|Instrumentation Draft (Partiturerstschrift) – in {{the case}} of the four scenes of Das Rheingold, the {{preliminary}} draft was followed by what Wagner termed an Instrumentationsskizze, in which he worked out most of the orchestral details. This draft was written <b>in</b> <b>pencil</b> and on as many staves as were required by the instrumentation. It is thus but one remove from being a full score, and in WWV both are referred to by the same name. The instrumental prelude that precedes Scene 1 was not included in the instrumentation draft, however, but was written out in ink in full score without any intermediate stage, as is explained below.|$|E

Of the concept, Bush said that it reflects the title, depicting good and bad things that emerge from you. The album was released on compact disc in Japan in 1987 with the cover art modified. A section of the original cover art was enlarged, creating two different booklet covers: the outer one modified; and underneath the original. The album's cover was voted 'Greatest Album Cover of 1980' by Record Mirror.|$|E
