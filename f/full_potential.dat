5|$|Development {{began in}} 2008, {{simultaneous}} to Dominion of the Dark Djinn. The game's animated sequences were produced by Studio Ghibli, while the original score was co-composed by Joe Hisaishi. The art style was also inspired by Studio Ghibli's other productions. The character development of Oliver {{was a large}} focus of the game, intending to make children empathize with the character and for adults to relive their adolescence. The developers used {{the power of the}} PlayStation 3 to its <b>full</b> <b>potential</b> to render the world with great detail not possible in Dominion of the Dark Djinn.|$|E
5|$|In Haydn's {{previous}} {{two sets of}} quartets, the Opus 20 ("Sun") and Opus 33 ("Russian"), he adopted a variety of cyclical structures, particularly in the alternate placement of the slow movement as {{the second or third}} movement. But in the Opus 50 set, each quartet follows the same fast–slow–minuet–fast sequence. The set is also characterised by a high degree of monothematicism (the use of a single theme within a movement). In a number of movements, including sonata form movements and minuets and trios, Haydn eschews presenting a second and contrasting theme and instead elects to explore the <b>full</b> <b>potential</b> of the primary theme.|$|E

The club's first ever transfer fee, £400, was paid for Welsh international Lloyd Davies who remains Northampton's most-capped player, winger Fred McDiarmid and playmaking centre half David McCartney. With this new talent, in his first season in charge, Chapman led Northampton to eighth place; with additional new signings, such as inside forward Albert Lewis from Coventry City, he used this as a springboard to take the Southern League title in 1908–09, with Lewis finishing as top scorer.|$|E

5|$|Even though {{geothermal}} {{power is}} globally sustainable, extraction {{must still be}} monitored to avoid local depletion. Over the course of decades, individual wells draw down local temperatures and water levels until a new equilibrium is reached with natural flows. The three oldest sites, at Larderello, Wairakei, and the Geysers have experienced reduced output because of local depletion. Heat and water, in uncertain proportions, were extracted faster than they were replenished. If production is reduced and water is reinjected, these wells could theoretically recover their <b>full</b> <b>potential.</b> Such mitigation strategies have already been implemented at some sites. The long-term sustainability of geothermal energy has been demonstrated at the Lardarello field in Italy since 1913, at the Wairakei field in New Zealand since 1958, and at The Geysers field in California since 1960.|$|E
5|$|For Dominion of the Dark Djinn, the {{development}} team {{found that the}} Nintendo DS was best suited to the game's development. Alongside the launch of Dominion of the Dark Djinn on December 9, 2010, Level-5 also launched {{the first chapter of}} Hotroit Stories, titled , for mobile devices via the Roid service. Wrath of the White Witch was developed for the PlayStation 3. The team planned to bring the game to the console from the beginning of development, but opted to work on the DS version of the game beforehand due to the larger number of DS users in Japan at the time. The team found they could render the game world with great detail, using the hardware to its <b>full</b> <b>potential</b> to present the animation, world and music. Hino felt that the PlayStation 3 version allowed the game's music to accompany the imagery, which was not possible on the DS version.|$|E

He had launched Mad magazine, worked briefly for Playboy publisher Hugh Hefner and {{on a series of}} solo and collaborative projects, then returned to working for Hefner with Little Annie Fanny. Each episode of the comic strip was designed and written by Kurtzman and rendered in oil, tempera, and watercolor by Elder. Hefner edited each episode, often requiring detailed changes to ensure that the series remained true to the magazine's editorial style. Critical reaction was mixed, with most praising the elaborate, fully painted comic, but some dismissing it as falling short of Kurtzman's <b>full</b> <b>potential.</b> The complete series was first collected into two volumes in 2000 and 2001 by Dark Horse Comics.|$|E

40|$|Is Australia {{fulfilling}} {{its obligations}} towards its children, in particular fostering their development to their <b>fullest</b> <b>potential,</b> {{in accordance with}} its obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child? This article addresses this com-plex question by elaborating three alternative conceptualisations {{of the right to}} development to one’s <b>fullest</b> <b>potential,</b> based on the literature on human rights principles, and on the writings of the philosophers John Rawls, Michael Walzer, and Amartya Sen. The analysis suggests that while Australia performs well in comparison with other rich countries according to indicators of educational achievement, disparities in educational outcomes are large, implying that many children fail to realise their right to education to their <b>fullest</b> <b>potential.</b> This is not surprising. More surprising is the contrast between the diligence with which educational outcomes in Australia are measured, and the lack of accurate infor-mation on public resource inputs (except at the most highly aggregated levels) to achieve those outcomes. The paper concludes that while the measurement of stu-dent outcomes is an important step in the realisation of all Australian children’s right to education to their <b>fullest</b> <b>potential,</b> the failure to accurately monitor re-source inputs represents an equal failure by Australian governments to protect and promote children’s rights. ...|$|R

The Russell family also drew media and critical attention for storylines involving various LGBT topics: Chad Harris-Crane's affair with Vincent and subsequent confusion about his sexual orientation, Simone's coming out as lesbian to her family, and the revelation that Vincent was intersex. While the show's treatment of sexual and gender identity has received mixed feedback from critics, Passions won the award for Outstanding Daily Drama at the 17th GLAAD Media Awards for its portrayal of Simone's sexuality.|$|E

5|$|After two {{unsuccessful}} seasons, Barcelona were {{in need of}} an overhaul, {{leading to}} the departure of Rijkaard and Ronaldinho. Upon the latter's departure, Messi was given the number 10 shirt. He signed a new contract in July 2008 on an annual salary of €7.8million, becoming the club's highest-paid player. Ahead of the new season, a major concern remained his frequent muscular injuries, which had left him side-lined {{for a total of}} eight months between 2006 and 2008. To combat the problem, the club implemented new training, nutrition, and lifestyle regimens, and assigned him a personal physiotherapist, who would travel with him during call-ups for the Argentina national team. As a result, Messi remained virtually injury-free during the next four years, allowing him to reach his <b>full</b> <b>potential.</b> Despite his injuries early in the year, his performances in 2008 saw him again voted runner-up for the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, both times behind Cristiano Ronaldo.|$|E
