40|$|The {{concept of}} servitudes was {{utilized}} by some writers on international law to qualify a regime of restrictions, established by treaty or local custom, {{applicable to the}} territory of one State {{in the interest of}} the territory of one or more other States. The main character of such regime was identified with the permanent attachment to the territory of the State, so as to be opposable to third States and transmissible in case of a change in sovereignty. From this flowed the analogy with the civil law institute of servitudes: the servient State to which are imposed localized obligations; the dominant State entitled to exercise the corresponding right within the limits provided by the act establishing the servitude. However, the majority of legal writers always doubted that this analogy was adequate, because of the heterogeneousness of the situations evocated, lacking a clear common ground. The only common element was that servitudes, as minor rights in rem, did not imply a transfer of territorial sovereignty but only a limitation of it. The author advocates that international servitudes made their time, the idea of the existence of regimes running with the land still survives in relation to the so-called dispositive treaties, creating territorial objective regimes opposable to third States and automatically transmissible in case of succession. The question is whether there is presently any place for the doctrine of servitudes in international law. The answer has to be negative, not only because the term <b>international</b> <b>servitude</b> is legally incorrect and politically unacceptable, but also because the more recent version of ancient servitudes, the objective territorial regimes created by dispositive treaties, equally face the same uncertainty about their legal standing in international law...|$|E
40|$|The article {{deals with}} one of the most {{controversial}} problems of international law the <b>international</b> <b>servitudes.</b> It presents the origin of the concept of <b>servitudes</b> in <b>international</b> law and legal theories concerning them. The author concludes that, how ever, the doctrine of <b>international</b> <b>servitudes</b> as too rigid and too restrictive is rejected in international law but the problem of special legal ch aracter of rights and obligations in question is still real. The tendency to atribute to them the features of perm anency and transmisibility on occurrence of territorial changes (state succession) is view ed in doctrine of internation al law, practice of states and also in the text of Vienna Convention on Succession of States in Respect of Treaties (1978). This shows that the appearance of the concept of <b>international</b> <b>servitudes</b> influenced the idea of special treatment of rights and obligations attached strictly to the territory of state and may be, has led to the cristalisation of legal norm s contained in art. 11 and 12 of the V ienna C onvention.

40|$|General {{customary}} {{international law}} contains rules, norms, and principles that seem applicable to any state and not to a particular state or an exclusive grouping of states. For example, norms relating to the high seas, to airspace and outer space, to diplomatic immunities, {{to the rules of}} warfare, and so forth, apply equally to all states having occasion to be concerned with these areas. Similarly, the facts of a given case may suggest exclusively the application of general custom—such as cases concerning collision on the high seas between ships of different countries, cases involving general principles of international law, cases turning on the construction of treaties under general customary canons of construction, and in general cases where the plaintiff and defendant states could theoretically be interchanged with any other states without affecting the content of the rules of law cited by either side in the dispute. By contrast, special {{customary international law}} deals with non-generalizable topics such as title to or rights in specific portions of world real estate (e. g., cases of acquisitive prescription, boundary disputes, and so-called <b>international</b> <b>servitudes),</b> or with rules expressly limited to countries of a certain region (such as the law of asylum in Latin America). The line separating general from special custom is similar to that in English common law, where a particular custom 2 ̆ 2 must apply to a definitely limited though indeterminate class of persons 2 ̆ 2 and to a limited geographic area; if the usage is laid in too wide a geographic area, for example, it is taken out of the realm of custom and must be pleaded as an ordinary claim at law...|$|R
