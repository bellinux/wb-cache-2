40|$|ABSTRACT In {{conventional}} recycling method, {{metal chips}} are cast after pressing and melting in electric arc furnace. Material loss occurs during the recycling from liquid metal {{due to the}} several reasons. Direct recycling method which produces the aluminium powder from aluminium chips using mechanical mill can be an alternative to conventional recycling method. Thus material and energy losses, and labour cost will be reduced by direct recycling method without melting. In this study, the particle morphology of powder direct recycled from AA 6013 aluminium alloy chips with cryogenic, disc and ball type grinders is investigated. Mechanical milling resulted flaky and irregular shaped AA 6013 particles. It was ascertained that the chips did not break sufficiently in despite of the long duration milling mechanisms by ball mill. Cryogenic mill provides the energy required for milling mechanisms to act. <b>Disc</b> <b>mill</b> has the highest impact energy was determined. Consequently, efficiency of ball mill {{is lower than the}} efficiency of cryogenic and <b>disc</b> type <b>mills.</b> Shape factors of powders produced with ball and cryogenic mills were found greater than that of the powder produced by <b>disc</b> <b>mill.</b> <b>Disc</b> <b>mill</b> has the most efficient and effective impact energy which produces the smaller particles per minute, was determined...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of milling methods on tensile properties of polypropylene (PP) / oil palm mesocarp fibre (OPMF) biocomposites. Two types of mills were used; Wiley <b>mill</b> (WM) and <b>disc</b> <b>mill</b> (DM). Ground OPMF from each milling process was examined for its particle size distribution and aspect ratio by sieve and microscopic analyses, respectively. Results showed that DM-OPMF had smaller diameter fibre with uniform particle size compared to the WM-OPMF. Surface morphology study by SEM showed that DM-OPMF had rougher surface compared to WM-OPMF. Furthermore, it was found that PP/DM-OPMF biocomposite had higher tensile strength compared to PP/WM-OPMF, with almost two-fold. Thus, it is suggested that small diameter and uniform size fibre may improve stress transfer and surface contact between the fibre and polymer matrix and cause welldispersion of filler throughout the polymer resulted in better tensile strength of PP/DM-OPMF compared to PP/WM-OPMF biocomposite. Overall, it can be concluded that <b>disc</b> <b>milling</b> could serve as a simple and effective grinding method for improving the tensile properties of biocomposite...|$|R

In {{the first set}} of experiments, it was attempted to confirm the information presented in the literature that magnesium hydride could be produced by heating at 350 oC for 24 hours under 10 atmospheres of pressure. The results obtained in this study indicated that even a higher temperature heating at 400 oC under 10 bar hydrogen pressure was insufficient for magnesium hydride formation. Heating and grinding time were selected as the most effective parameters by which a full-factorial experimental design methodology was implemented. Statistical analysis results indicated that a combination of grinding and a 50 oC heating was most effective. Hence, grinding was identified as the most significant factor effect on the production of magnesium hydride.

Nowadays, increasing the interest for rediscovering the benefits, on scientific basis, of traditional fermented beverages based on cereals. Fermented mashes based on different cereal grist, namely Braga in Romanian, is a healthy and nutritious beverage, a source for new functional products with beneficial effects on human health. Physical-chemical and sensorial characteristics of these beverages depend on the ingredients and method of preparation. In this article was analyzed {{the influence of the}} five varieties of wheat on the main physical-chemical and sensorial characteristics of the fermented mashes obtained from grounded debranned millet (Panicum miliaceum), different species of wheat (Triticum aestivum - two variety, Triticum durum - one varieties, Triticum spelta - one variety and Triticum turgidum - one variety) and well modified Pilsner barley malt.

The gluability of the fibrillated bark adhesives was evaluated according to the Japanese Agricultural Standard for Plywood (JAS) and was found to be excellent. These bark adhesives have a number of advantages in that there is no tannin extraction, there is a total use of the bark, a low-level requirement of PF resins, no other components required and there is a high glue bond quality. Considering that very small amounts of fibrillated bark adhesives produced high-quality wood bonding, the bark components such as tannin, hemicellulose, lignin, cellulose nanofibers and other components may well be contributing to produce such a good bonding.|$|R

With {{a view to}} upgrading the micronutrient status of pearl millet-based foods, the effects of single operations and of porridge preparation scenarios on levels and in vitro solubility (IVS) of iron and zinc and mineral complexing factors (phytates: inositol phosphates and phenolic compounds) were tested. <b>Disc</b> <b>milling</b> of grain may add significant iron {{but this is not}} necessarily IVS iron. Soaking of grains results in a 25 % loss of iron, but also facilitates endogenous phytate degradation, particularly when combined with milling and cooking.

Cooking does not decompose phytates, but results in complex formation of phenolic compounds as measured by a significant reduction in reactive hydroxyl groups. Because of its different distribution in the grain, zinc is generally less affected than iron. Phytate reduction by endogenous phytases is inhibited at low pH as caused by fermentation. Kanwa (alkaline rock salt) could be a functional cooking ingredient as a source of minerals and to react with phenolic substances.

The morphology of the sampel surface of the alkaline extracted sample was smoother, denser, and the grain size formed were relatively larger. The formed crystalline phases were HAp (hydroxyapatite), carbonate apatite type A [Ca 10 (PO 4) 6 CO 3] and B [Ca 10 (PO 4) 3 (CO 3) 3 (OH) 2] with crystalline degree of 78. 4 %...|$|R
40|$|A {{spectacular}} {{example of}} free surface flow {{is the impact}} of a solid object on a liquid: At impact a “crown” splash is created and a surface cavity (void) emerges which immediately starts to collapse due to the hydrostatic pressure of the surrounding liquid. Eventually the cavity closes in a single point about halfway down its length and shoots out a fast and extremely slender water jet. Here we <b>impact</b> thin circular <b>discs</b> a few centimeters in radius with velocities of a few meters per second. Combining high-speed imaging with sophisticated boundary-integral simulations we elucidate various aspects of this fascinating process. First we show that the mechanism behind the formation of the fast, almost needle-like liquid jet is reminiscent of the violent jets of fluidized metal created during the explosion “of lined cavities” in military and mining operations. We obtain quantitative agreement between our simulations, experiments, and analytical model. Next we use visualization experiments to measure the air flow as it is squeezed out of the shrinking impact cavity. Together with numerical simulations we show that even in our simple system of a 2 cm <b>disc</b> <b>impacting</b> at merely 1 m/s the air flow easily attains supersonic velocities. A long-standing controversy in the fluid dynamics community has been until recently the pinch-off behavior of a bubble inside a liquid. Our observation of different time scales for the onset of the predicted final regime reconciles the different views expressed in recent literature about bubble pinch-off. Next we replace the <b>impacting</b> <b>disc</b> by a long, smooth cylinder and find that the closure position of the cavity displays distinct regimes separated by discrete jumps which are consistently observed in experiment and numerical simulations. Finally, we simulate the collapse of nanobubbles nucleating from small (50 nm) pits drilled into a silicon wafer. We find that just prior to final collapse a jet very similar in appearance to those after solid object impact forms and penetrates deep into the hole...|$|R
