A true Thinker, who has {{practical}} purpose in his thinking, and is sincere, as Plato, or Carlyle, or Helps, becomes in some sort a seer, and must be always of infinite use in his generation; but an affected Thinker, who supposes his thinking of any other importance than as it tends to work, is about the vainest <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>that</b> {{can be found in}} the occupied classes. Nay, I believe that metaphysicians and philosophers are, on the whole, the greatest troubles the world has got to deal with; and that while a tyrant or bad man is of some use in teaching people submission or indignation, and a thoroughly idle man is only harmful in setting an idle example, and communicating to other lazy people his own lazy misunderstandings, busy metaphysicians are always entangling good and active people, and weaving cobwebs among the finest wheels of the world's business; and are as much as possible, by all prudent persons, to be brushed out of their way, like spiders, and the meshed weed that has got into the Cambridgeshire canals, and other such impediments to barges and business. And if we thus clear the metaphysical element out of modern literature, we shall find its bulk amazingly diminished, and the claims of the remaining writers, or of those whom we have thinned by this abstraction of their straw stuffing, much more easily adjusted.[87] ...|$|E

Using a hidden tape-recorder, the writer recorded the four conversation in natural interaction setting.

Based on the data analysis, the writer found that the switching that mostly happened was from Formal Indonesian into Javanese and Javanese into Formal Indonesian; then Informal Indonesian into Indonesian and Indonesian into informal Indonesian; next was Chinese into Formal Indonesian and Javanese into Chinese; the last was Formal Indonesian into Chinese, Javanese into Informal Indonesian, Informal Indonesian into Javanese, Informal Indonesian into Chinese and Chinese into Javanese. The switching into Indonesian was the higher, then the following was the switching into Javanese, next was the switching into Informal Indonesian, and the last was the switching into Chinese. The other findings showed that participants, topic, setting and function were the factors that influenced Mr. Hermanto to switch codes. For examples: different participants leads Mr. Hermanto to switch to different codes; the changing of topic such as {{when he talks about}} numbers to the Chinese person, he mostly switches into Chinese; informal situation also makes him often does switch into Javanese; and the last is for some reasons (such as raising intimacy, persuading interlocutor, uttering a special term of calling someone, showing seriousness, emphasizing the previous word showing respect, keeping a secret, showing an ethnic identity, habit, and lack of vocabulary), he switches his code. Since this study is limited in term of the number of the subject and the place where this study was conducted, it is far for being perfect.

40|$|In early 21 st Century Beijing, in {{the context}} of the One Child Policy and the {{developing}} market economy, middle class women undertook extraordinary measures to have children of the highest possible quality. A baby making industry, comprising private maternity hospitals, providers of prenatal nutrition, imported formula, and supplements, emerged. Women used taijiao, or fetal education, fetal testing and myriad forms of pregnancy management as part of a project of having the smartest, healthiest baby possible. Based on two years of fieldwork in reproductive contexts in Beijing, this dissertation seeks to untangle the complicated relationship between reproduction, state population policies, parents, fetuses, and babies. It argues that the caring labor of hospital workers, sometimes categorized as immaterial, is in fact very much material, in that it creates particular <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>persons,</b> and <b>that</b> the materiality of this labor demonstrates that material and immaterial are not useful categories. It considers the “non-spectacular” tools of patient education and fetal education alongside spectacular tools of visualization. It argues that technologically assisted reproduction is not exceptional, but rather is on a spectrum with more everyday tools and techniques for influencing pregnancy, such as low-tech educational equipment, stories and metaphors, and fetal education. The dissertation argues that emergent practices of reproduction, specifically the simultaneous use of taijiao and fetal testing, especially the ultrasound, are producing new <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> fetal personhood, a partial personhood wherein a fetus is both a person and not a person...|$|R

5000|$|Although {{no one was}} apprehended or {{prosecuted for}} Little's murder {{there have been a}} number of speculations. The author Dashiell Hammett, was working as a strike-breaker in Butte for Pinkerton's, and (allegedly) turned down an offer of $5,000 to assassinate Little. Hammett later made use of his {{experiences}} in Butte to write Red Harvest. 'In her memoirs Lillian Hellman, Hammett’s companion, said he told her he was offered to murder Little. “Through the years he was to repeat that bribe offer so many times that I came to believe … that it was a <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> key to his life. He had given a man the right to think he would commit murder.” William Nolan, one of Hammett’s biographers, thinks that “the fact that someone even asked him, thinking that he would be <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>person,</b> and <b>that</b> he was that deep into the thing made him feel guilty. He never got over and it always haunted him.”' Union leaders who had seen Little's body at the time insisted that one of the murderers was Billy Oates, a notorious hired thug employed by Anaconda. The rationale for Oates' involvement was a small hole at the back of Little's head that had been [...] "inflicted by the steel hook used by Oates on the stub of his amputated right arm". Over the next nine years two further men were named as possibly being involved in Little's lynching. At the time of the 1918 IWW conspiracy trial in Chicago, IWW lawyers questioned why Ed Morrissey, who had been Butte's chief of detectives at the time of the murder, had taken a twenty-day leave of absence on the day following the killing. It was alleged at the trial that Morrissey had scratches on his face. The autopsy of Little's body had found that he had tried to fight off his assailants and that he had someone's skin under his fingernails. In 1926, William Francis Dunne identified Peter Prlja as one of the 'death squad'. Prlja was at the time a motorcycle officer in the Butte police department and like Oates had worked as a security-guard for Anaconda.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is about}} person features, their representation and interpretation in natural language. I {{will argue that}} {{there are several ways}} in which person features can be represented and interpreted. Most importantly, I will provide evidence for a <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> features <b>that</b> are parts of referential indices of pronouns, constraining possible values that the assignment function maps the indices to (cf. Minor 2011, Sudo 2012). It is this particular way <b>of</b> representing <b>person</b> features <b>that</b> allows to postulate operators that manipulate the assignment in way that all pronouns with certain person features are affected. Such operators, as I will demonstrate, do exist. They come in at least two varieties, imposter operators and monster operators. Imposter operators manipulate the assignment by making all free 1 st person indices (or all 2 nd person indices) undefined in their scope, and when 1 st or 2 nd person indices are undefined 3 rd person indices can be used instead. Building on the observations from Collins and Postal 2012, I will argue that we can interpret the 3 rd person pronoun in sentences like Yours truly's dissertation wasfiled a week before his birthday as referring to the speaker because there is a silent imposter operator that suppresses 1 st person indices in the domain that includes the imposter yours truly and the pronoun. Furthermore, it is due to the presence of the same operator that the 1 st person pronoun and the 3 rd person pronoun in sentences like Yours truly filed his dissertation before my birthday cannot be understood as coreferential. Another likely candidate for a person-sensitive assignment-manipulating operator is the monster operator in Mishar Tatar (strictly speaking, it is not a Kaplanian monster, but I will use the term anyway). This operator is responsible for the fact that a subclass of indexical pronouns in this language may shift to denote the coordinates of the context embedded under an attitude predicate. Thus, the dissertation contains two case studies: one on imposters in English (Chapter 1) and one on indexical shifting in Mishar Tatar (Chapter 2). The overall hope is to build a case in which possible interpretations <b>of</b> <b>person</b> pronouns can inform us about their syntactic representation. by Alexander Podobryaev. Thesis: Ph.
