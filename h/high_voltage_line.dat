25|$|The reforms {{implemented}} in the 1990s led to high investment, which allowed for a 75% increase in generation capacity, resulting in the decrease of prices in the wholesale market from US$40/MW·h in 1992 to US$23/MW·h in 2001. However, the reforms failed to deliver the necessary increase in transmission capacity. Only one relevant project, {{the addition of the}} 1,300km <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>line</b> between Comahue and Buenos Aires, was built in the 1990s.

The plant would provide employment for 600–700 people, or more than 10% of the population.

2500|$|The Argentine Patagonia {{region has}} a very large wind potential. The Chubut Wind Power Regional Center (CREE) {{estimated}} the theoretical potential for the region at 500 GW of electricity generation. However, this large potential is still largely unexploited. One {{of the reasons for}} this underdevelopment is that existing tariffs and incentives do not make wind power development attractive enough yet. However, the main deterrent to wind power development in the region has been the lack of transmission lines that connect the Patagonia region with the National Interconnected System.

Artificial intelligence and more specifically artificial neural networks (ANN) are addressed in this work, {{in order to give}} accurate solutions to <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> transmission <b>line</b> problems using in the calculations only actual field data. Two different case studies are studied, i. e., the estimation of critical flashover voltage on polluted insulators and the estimation of lightning performance of <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> transmission <b>lines.</b> ANN models are developed and are tested on operating <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> transmission <b>lines</b> and polluted insulators, producing very satisfactory results.

40|$|M. Ing. (Electrical and Electronic Engineering) Shunt {{reactors}} {{are used}} in power system amongst other things, to suppress overvoltages in the network during network switching, auto reclosing of transmission lines and under low loading condition of the network. Traditionally, shunt reactors of fixed type have been used and these have been permanently connected to the system. This research work investigated the feasibility of replacing the fixed shunt line reactors with a reactor, whose parameters are automatically varied depending on the system reactive power requirements, in a mature power system overlaid with <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>lines</b> to improve amongst, other things voltage stability. However, in a mature system overlaid with parallel <b>higher</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>lines,</b> power tend to flow on the matured system rather than <b>higher</b> <b>voltage</b> system as predetermined by various impedances of the power system. It is therefore desirable that loading of <b>higher</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>lines</b> be increased because of their higher power transfer capability and fact that <b>higher</b> <b>voltage</b> networks generate capacitive power which is substantially more than for each line at the original voltage. However, replacing {{a large number of}} fixed line reactors, at low loadings of <b>higher</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>lines,</b> even when system collapse is averted by increasing the number of reactors inserted into the system, overvoltage problems may still be an issue, until a certain number of must-run reactors, operating at full reactance, are put into service. If too much inductive reactance is removed from the system when the loading levels are extremely low, the power system will collapse. Therefore, there was no economic benefit in replacing all the fixed shunt line reactors with controllable type when the loading was still relatively low. Thus, the majority of the converted reactors were operating in their full rating as there was still more reactive power to be absorbed. However, when the power was diverted to flow on the <b>higher</b> <b>voltage</b> system through the use of series compensation of the <b>higher</b> <b>voltage</b> system, there was a possibility of making some fixed shunt line reactors on the <b>higher</b> <b>voltage</b> network controllable. This also allowed more power to be transferred in the <b>higher</b> <b>voltage</b> system thus improving its utilisation. Also, a positive impact on active system losses was realised...|$|R
