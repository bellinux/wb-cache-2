25|$|One of {{the first}} Antarctic krill {{trawlers}} to use this technique was the FV Atlantic Navigator, registered in Vanuatu and owned by the Norwegian-based company Aker ASA, which used this technique in the 2003/04 and 2004/05 <b>fishing</b> <b>seasons.</b> In these seasons, this ship alone caught 25% and 38% of the whole krill catch in CCAMLR regions. The successor ship of the Atlantic Navigator, the FV Saga Sea, can fish up to about 120,000 tonnes of krill annually, and Aker announced plans to build more such ships.|$|E
40|$|Abstract only. The paper {{introduces}} {{and analyses}} first the evolution, actuality and current {{problems of the}} summer closed <b>fishing</b> <b>season</b> system of China. The summer closed <b>fishing</b> <b>season</b> system is formally actualized in 1995. Till 2006, all waters of China is managed by the very system. During summer closed <b>fishing</b> <b>season</b> of 2005, 120 thousands of fishing vessel and one million fishermen were prohibited to undertake fishing activities in Chinese waters. The paper gives the detail arrangement of the waters, fishing gears and time of summer closed <b>fishing</b> <b>season</b> system. The paper also analyses the characteristics of Chinese marine fishing industry such as complicated fishery resources, huge fishing labor force and special fishing organization system and why {{there is a huge}} transaction cost in the course of undertaking the summer closed <b>fishing</b> <b>season</b> system. Finally, in the paper the authors discuss how to construct an effective fishing cooperative organization for reducing the administrational cost and improving the economic efficiency of summer closed <b>fishing</b> <b>season</b> system...|$|R

25|$|Marine {{protected}} areas (MPA) are {{protected areas}} of seas, oceans, estuaries or large lakes. MPAs restrict human activity for a conservation purpose, typically to protect natural or cultural resources. Such marine resources {{are protected by}} local, state, territorial, native, regional, national, or international authorities and differ substantially among and between nations. This variation includes different limitations on development, fishing practices, <b>fishing</b> <b>seasons</b> and catch limits, moorings and bans on removing or disrupting marine life. In some situations (such as with the Phoenix Islands Protected Area), MPAs also provide revenue for countries, potentially equal to the income {{that they would have}} if they were to grant companies permissions to fish.|$|E
25|$|Gillnetters – On {{inland waters}} and inshore, {{gillnets}} can be operated from open boats and canoes. In coastal waters, they are operated by small decked vessels which {{can have their}} wheelhouse either aft or forward. In coastal waters, gillnetting is often used as a second fishing method by trawlers or beam trawlers, depending on <b>fishing</b> <b>seasons</b> and targeted species. For offshore fishing, or fishing on the high seas, medium-sized vessels using drifting gillnets are called drifters, and the bridge is usually located aft. The nets are set and hauled by hand on small open boats. Larger boats use hydraulic or occasionally mechanical net haulers, or net drums. These vessels can be equipped with an echosounder, although locating fish is {{more a matter of}} the fishermen's personal knowledge of the fishing grounds rather than depending on special detection equipment.|$|E
25|$|In 1903, American Senator Henry Cabot Lodge {{advocated}} {{that the}} United States should purchase the islands from France. Lodge {{was concerned about}} the French influence on Saint Pierre and Miquelon, possible political or cultural effects on Canada and the United States, and the effect of French fishing fleets on New England fisheries. The economy of the islands had been in decline due to poor cod <b>fishing</b> <b>seasons,</b> and many residents were angry at France for insisting on approving all teachers on the islands. For these reasons, many residents of the islands were in favor of becoming part of the United States, reasoning that they could then sell their fish {{to the rest of the}} United States without import taxes, and that the United States would not interfere with their local educational system. In response, some Canadians asked Great Britain to purchase the islands from France instead. In an election for the islands' representative to the French Chamber of Deputies, one candidate was in favor of annexation while the incumbent candidate was not. The incumbent candidate, who was against annexation, won reelection by a small margin in December 1903. The islands were not purchased by either country, and they remained part of France.|$|E

The show emphasizes the dangers on deck to the fishermen (and the Discovery Channel camera crews recording their work) as crews duck heavy crab pots swinging into position, maneuver hundreds of pounds of crab across a deck strewn with hazards (i. e., holding tank hatches, uneven surfaces, maintenance access plates, wet decks), and lean over the rails to position pots for launch or retrieval as galeforce winds and high waves constantly lash the deck. The series also documents the dangers of being on a boat in the Bering Sea, in the midst of some of the coldest and stormiest waters on earth, where even a minor problem may become complex or even catastrophic with the nearest port often hundreds of miles away.|$|E
