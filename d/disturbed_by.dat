5|$|In 1964 {{the stones}} {{in the circle}} were <b>disturbed</b> <b>by</b> {{agricultural}} activity. It was then decided that the site would be excavated, a project which was ordered by the Ministry of Public Building and Works and carried out in May 1965 under the directorship of Geoffrey J.

Despite these controversies, the door has remained in operation at the basilica.|$|R

5|$|Initially, the {{operations}} room at RAF Uxbridge was <b>disturbed</b> <b>by</b> {{a visit from}} Prime Minister Winston Churchill.

Most of the Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) were relaxing, in spite of Churchill’s presence (he had ordered that they not behave any differently). However, at 10:30 the first German aircraft triggered the alarm at Chain Home radar station at Dover. The filter room at Stanmore recognised the formation as hostile. The WAAF detailed group and sector commands throughout the south that 40-plus enemy aircraft were entering Kentish airspace.|$|E
5|$|It {{is a white}} bird {{adorned with}} buff plumes in the {{breeding}} season. It nests in colonies, usually near bodies of water and often with other wading birds. The nest is a platform of sticks in trees or shrubs. Cattle egrets exploit drier and open habitats more than other heron species. Their feeding habitats include seasonally inundated grasslands, pastures, farmlands, wetlands and rice paddies. They often accompany cattle or other large mammals, catching insect and small vertebrate prey <b>disturbed</b> <b>by</b> these animals.

The inner magnetosphere is located at distances closer than 10RJ from the planet. The magnetic field within it remains approximately dipole, because contributions from the currents flowing in the magnetospheric equatorial plasma sheet are small. In the middle (between 10 and 40RJ) and outer (further than 40RJ) magnetospheres, the magnetic field is not a dipole, and is seriously <b>disturbed</b> <b>by</b> its interaction with the plasma sheet (see magnetodisk below).|$|E
