5|$|In 2001, Usher {{began dating}} TLC member Chilli Thomas, and their {{relationship}} lasted for two years. In 2003, Usher started working on the album which would become Confessions, which contained songs inspired by the personal lives of Usher and his collaborators. The songs about <b>infidelity</b> and pregnant mistresses were inspired not by Usher's private life, but by Jermaine Dupri's own personal challenges at the time. Dupri deliberately intended to create an air of mystery about Usher, and arouse fans' curiosity about {{how much of the}} <b>infidelity</b> story was Usher's own confession. The unintended result of this was to arouse Thomas's suspicions about Usher. They broke up in December 2003.|$|E

40|$|The {{theory of}} evolved sex {{differences}} in jealousy predicts {{sex differences in}} responses to sexual <b>infidelities</b> and emotional <b>infidelities.</b> Critics have argued that such differences are absent in studies that use continuous measures to assess responses to hypothetical <b>infidelities</b> or in studies that assess responses to real <b>infidelities.</b> These criticisms were tested in two random-effects meta-analyses of 40 published and unpublished papers (providing 209 effect sizes from 47 independent samples) that measured sex differences in jealousy using continuous measures. A significant, theory-supportive sex difference emerged across 45 independent samples using continuous measures of responses to hypothetical <b>infidelities,</b> g*= 0. 258, 95 % confidence interval (CI) [0. 188, 0. 328], p<. 00001. Measured emotion significantly moderated effect size. Effects were strongest when measures assessed distress/upset (g*= 0. 337) and jealousy (g*= 0. 309). Other commonly measured negative emotions yielded weaker effects, including hurt (g*= 0. 161), anger (g*= 0. 074), and disgust (g*= 0. 012). Across the 45 independent samples, six significant moderators emerged: random sampling, population type (student vs. nonstudent samples), age, inclusion of a forced-choice question, number of points in the response scale, and year of publication. A significant, theory-supportive effect also emerged across seven studies assessing reactions to actual <b>infidelities,</b> g*= 0. 234, 95 % CI [0. 020, 0. 448], p= 03. Results demonstrate that the sex difference in jealousy neither is an artifact of response format nor is limited to responses to hypothetical <b>infidelities.</b> © 2012 Elsevier Inc. </p...|$|R
