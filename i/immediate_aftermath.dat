5|$|When Marvel {{wanted to}} issue a story dealing with the <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> of the September 11 attacks, the company chose the December 2001 issue of The Amazing Spider-Man.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> of the IAU {{definition}} of dwarf planet, some scientists expressed their {{disagreement with the}} IAU resolution. Campaigns included car bumper stickers and T-shirts. Mike Brown (the discoverer of Eris) agrees with {{the reduction of the}} number of planets to eight.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> of the floods, {{the entire}} Manila police force was mobilized to assist {{residents}} and begin relief operations. On May29, Quezon City mayor Norberto S. Amoranto sent an emergency {{request to the}} Philippine Air Force to rescue people trapped on rooftops.|$|E
5|$|The contest {{was held}} in the <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> of the 2014 Ukrainian revolution, Russian {{military}} intervention in Ukraine, and the crisis in Crimea, in which Crimea was annexed by Russia. Votes cast through Ukrainian telecom providers which service Crimea were counted towards Ukraine's votes.|$|E
5|$|Although up to 200,000 {{people were}} {{executed}} during the Spanish Civil War and its <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath,</b> 48 people were executed {{in the period}} from 1948 {{to the time of}} the 1975 executions. Of those, 17 were executed by firing squad and 31 by garrotting. Historically, the garrote had been the preferred execution method in Spain, with firing squads used for political and military prisoners.|$|E
5|$|British {{casualties}} in the battle were recorded with some accuracy in the <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> as 218 killed and approximately 677 wounded, {{although the number of}} wounded who subsequently died is not known. The ships that suffered most were Bellerophon with 201 casualties and Majestic with 193. Other than Culloden the lightest loss was on Zealous, which had one man killed and seven wounded.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> of Caracalla's death, Adventus was {{selected}} to serve as emperor, but he declined the position due to his old age. The army then chose Macrinus; they had no feelings of 'love or esteem' towards him, {{but there was no}} one else competing for the position. The army proclaimed Macrinus as emperor three days after the death of Caracalla, and named him Augustus.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> of the battle, Herodotus {{says that}} the Persian fleet sailed around Cape Sounion to attack Athens directly. As has been {{discussed}} above, some modern historians place this attempt just before the battle. Either way, the Athenians evidently realised that their city was still under threat, and marched {{as quickly as possible}} back to Athens.|$|E
5|$|Jules Naudet, a French cameraman, and Pavel Hlava, a Czech immigrant, videotaped the crash. A webcam {{set up by}} Wolfgang Staehle at an art {{exhibit in}} Brooklyn to take images of Lower Manhattan every four seconds also {{captured}} images of Flight11 crashing into the North Tower. A WNYW newscamera left rolling on the ground also captured audio of the crash and video of the <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Finnish Red Cross, {{which had}} been quick to descend upon {{the scene in the}} <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath,</b> said that some of the {{proceeds}} from its annual fund drive, which began two days after the shootings, would be contributed towards helping students and teachers affected by the incident. This would include financial provisions for the ongoing counselling services being provided.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{was damaged}} during World War II, but efforts {{to restore the}} castle began in the <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> of the war. Once again, and thanks to local {{non-profit}} organizations like the Wüstenrot Foundation and Community Fund for the Preservation of Lichtenstein Castle, the walls were restored in 1980, followed by the second floor in 1998. The upper floor and roof were restored in 2002.|$|E
5|$|As a brigadier, Dutton {{served at}} the Ministry of Defence as Director, NATO policy, a senior staff post, prior to {{attending}} the Royal College of Defence Studies. He was pulled off the course before completion and seconded to The Pentagon in Washington, DC to act as liaison between the British Chief of the Defence Staff and the American Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> {{of the terrorist attacks}} on the United States.|$|E
5|$|During September25–26, {{large-scale}} evacuations {{took place}} in response to forecasts suggesting a landfall near New Orleans. More than 1.5million people in New Orleans were advised to leave the city. The nine shelters opened throughout the area were collectively capable of accommodating up to 450,000 people. New Orleans mayor Marc Morial declared a State of Emergency to allow federal assistance into the affected areas during the <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> of the hurricane. A curfew was instituted for those who ignored evacuation orders or could not leave the city.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Arthur's widow {{was awarded}} £1m damages in the High Court. The {{families}} {{of the other three}} fatal casualties received damages out of court. A memorial service was held for the victims on the 10th anniversary of the crash in 2010 at St Etheldreda's Church, Hatfield. A second service was held near the crash site afterwards. Both were conducted by the Rector of Hatfield, who had attended to casualties and the bereaved in the <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> of the accident in 2000.|$|E
5|$|On 7 October 2000, three Israeli {{soldiers}} – Adi Avitan, Staff Sgt. Benyamin Avraham, and Staff Sgt. Omar Sawaidwere – were {{abducted by}} Hezbollah while patrolling the Israeli {{side of the}} Israeli-Lebanese border. The soldiers were killed either during the attack or in its <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath.</b> Israel Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz has, however, said that Hezbollah abducted the soldiers and then killed them. The bodies of the slain soldiers were exchanged for Lebanese prisoners in 2004.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Pola, Tegetthoff kept his fleet {{in the northern}} Adriatic, where it patrolled against a possible Italian attack. The Italian ships never came, and on 12 August, the two countries signed the Armistice of Cormons; this ended the fighting {{and led to the}} Treaty of Vienna. Though Austria had defeated Italy at Lissa and on land at the Battle of Custoza, the Austrian army was decisively defeated by Prussia at the Battle of Königgrätz. As a result, Austria, which became Austria-Hungary in the Ausgleich of 1867, was forced to cede the city of Venice to Italy. In the <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> of the war, the bulk of the Austrian fleet was decommissioned and disarmed.|$|E
5|$|After the attack, {{the bulk}} of the {{civilian}} population and the remaining Croatian police and troops fled over snow-covered terrain in poor weather to Karlovac, Ogulin, and to the nearby territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Approximately 30–60 civilians, largely elderly people, remained in Saborsko. The JNA and SAO Krajina troops forced those who remained behind to leave the village, killing or abusing the civilians. At least 25 civilians were murdered by the troops in the <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> of the capture of Saborsko. Some of the victims were shot, while others were beaten or burned to death.|$|E
5|$|Akroinon {{was a major}} {{success for}} the Byzantines, {{as it was the}} first {{large-scale}} victory they had scored in a pitched battle against the Arabs. Seeing it as evidence of God's renewed favour, the victory also served to strengthen Leo's belief in the policy of iconoclasm that he had adopted some years before. In the <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath,</b> this success opened up the way for a more aggressive stance by the Byzantines, who in 741 attacked the major Arab base of Melitene. In 742 and 743, the Umayyads were able to exploit a civil war between Constantine V and Artabasdos and raid into Anatolia with relative impunity, but the Arab sources do not report any major achievements.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the market}} {{continued}} to operate, in the <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> of the plague {{it was at}} a much reduced level and many stalls were left empty for some years after. The famine of 1369 overwhelmed Norwich's burial grounds, necessitating an expansion of St Peter Mancroft's churchyard. The southernmost rows of stalls in the main marketplace, which had been occupied by drapers and linen merchants, were removed to clear space for an enlarged churchyard. By 1377, the population of Norwich had fallen from at least 20,000 before the outbreak to below 6,000.|$|E
5|$|Another {{result of}} the coup was that the work {{that had been done}} by British {{intelligence}} with the anti-Axis government of Cvetković and Maček was lost. By supporting the coup plotters, the SOE undermined the balance in Yugoslav politics that had been achieved by the Cvetković–Maček Agreement. Serb nationalists supported and welcomed the coup because it ended Croatian autonomy under the Agreement and freed them to pursue a Greater Serbia agenda. The coup and its <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> also contributed to the paralysis within the Yugoslav government-in-exile {{during the rest of the}} war, due to ongoing disputes regarding the legitimacy of the Cvetković–Maček Agreement.|$|E
5|$|Damage was {{greatest}} {{in the southwest}} portion of the island, especially in the capital city, Roseau, which resembled an air raid target after the storm's passage. Strong winds from Hurricane David destroyed or damaged 80 percent of the homes (mostly wood)on the island, leaving 75 {{percent of the population}} homeless, with many others temporarily homeless in the <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath.</b> In addition, the rainfall turned rivers into torrents, sweeping away everything in their path to the sea. Power lines were completely ripped out, causing the water system to stop as well.|$|E
5|$|During the {{aftermath}} of the storm, the governor of Nueva Ecija requested then-Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos to declare his province a disaster area. Additionally, UNICEF was asked to provide water-purifying tablets. The Philippine Red Cross, Philippine government, local authorities and civic organizations provided relief assistance in the <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> of the storm. Despite private appeals for up to $1.4million for reconstruction aid, the Philippine government did not submit a request for international aid. However, by October 25, eight non-government relief agencies provided relief, which totaled $1.15million. Furthermore, the government of Switzerland provided $8,061worth of aid.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his release}} from the {{hospital}} and as a prisoner of war—the exact date is unknown—Schnaufer took over the family wine business. He had never planned to run the family winery as his ambition had always been to pursue an officer's career in the Luftwaffe. However, in the <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> of World War II the business had virtually ceased to exist and Schnaufer was given the task of rebuilding it from scratch. He had to re-establish business links to suppliers and customers and to consolidate them. Then {{he had to make}} new contacts in order to facilitate expansion and growth of the business. Lastly, he had to create an infrastructure which supported the growth of the business.|$|E
5|$|Howe {{remained}} inactive for {{the next}} half month, not attacking until September 15 when he landed a force at Kip's Bay. The British quickly occupied the city. On September 21, a fire of uncertain origin destroyed a quarter of New York City. In the <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> of the fire Nathan Hale was executed for spying. Although American troops delivered an unexpected check to the British at Harlem Heights in mid-September, Howe defeated Washington in battle again at White Plains and then again at Fort Washington. Because of these defeats, Washington and the army retreated across New Jersey and into Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|In 1895, Prinzess Wilhelm was {{deployed}} to East Asian waters, where she frequently {{served as the}} flagship of the East Asia Cruiser Division. She {{was one of the}} three ships that participated in the seizure of Kiaochou Bay under the command of Rear Admiral Otto von Diederichs. She subsequently was present in the Philippines in the <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> of the Battle of Manila Bay between American and Spanish squadrons during the Spanish–American War in 1898. Prinzess Wilhelm returned to Germany in 1899 and was modernized in 1899–1903. She was reduced to a mine hulk in February 1914 and ultimately broken up for scrap in 1922.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> of Henry's death, Richard {{successfully}} {{claimed his}} father's lands; he later {{left on the}} Third Crusade, but never married Alice as he had agreed with Philip Augustus. Eleanor was released from house arrest and regained control of Aquitaine, where she ruled on Richard's behalf. Henry's empire, however, did not survive long and collapsed {{during the reign of}} his youngest son John, when Philip captured all of the Angevin possessions in France except Gascony. This collapse had various causes, including long-term changes in economic power, growing cultural differences between England and Normandy but, in particular, the fragile, familial nature of Henry's empire.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> of the Pact, the Scandinavian {{countries}} and Finland were relieved. The Germans and Soviets were now allies, {{and there was}} no German threat against the Soviet Union. But shortly afterwards, Germany invaded Poland and Great Britain and France declared war against Germany. Next, the Soviets invaded eastern Poland, and later Moscow requested that the Baltic states allow the establishment of Soviet military bases and the stationing of troops on their soil. The government of Estonia accepted the ultimatum, signing the corresponding agreement in September, while Latvia and Lithuania followed suit in October.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> of the executions, {{there was}} {{speculation}} {{that up to}} 27 more prisoners could face the death penalty. Ultimately, these predictions proved ill-founded. Franco fell ill in late October 1975 and never recovered, dying on 20 November 1975. His death resulted in the de facto abolition of the death penalty, as no further executions took place. Capital punishment was abolished for all civil crimes by the Spanish Constitution of 1978, with sanctioned military executions in war time the sole exceptions. In 1995, the Spanish parliament abolished {{the death penalty in}} all circumstances.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> of the riot, {{federal troops}} were {{deployed}} in Rock Springs. They escorted the surviving Chinese miners, {{most of whom}} had fled to Evanston, Wyoming, back to Rock Springs {{a week after the}} riot. Reaction came swiftly from the era's publications. In Rock Springs, the local newspaper endorsed the outcome of the riot, while in other Wyoming newspapers, support for the riot was limited to sympathy for the causes of the white miners. The massacre in Rock Springs touched off a wave of anti-Chinese violence, especially in the Puget Sound area of Washington Territory.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> of {{the storm}} and {{associated}} flooding, the Department of Agriculture readied for the distribution of 3million bangus fry, 250,000tilapia fry, and 315bags of rice seeds to affected regions. Furthermore, the National Food Authority allocated 200sacks of rice to Pangasinan. The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council assisted in relief operations by allocating ₱10million (US$200,000) and 800bags of rice for such efforts. In addition, one of eight regional Filipino health offices distributed roughly ₱600,000 (US$10,000) worth of various medicines to Dagupan and Urdaneta, Pangasinan. According to the National Disaster Coordinating Council, ₱15.7million (US$300,000) worth in relief operations was allocated.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> {{of their}} disappearance, an {{international}} search was launched to find Nungesser and Coli. Aviation Digest sponsored a well-known pilot, Floyd Bennett, {{to search the}} area between New York and Newfoundland for nine days. The Canadian government search and rescue organizations also sent out two search aircraft (one of which crashed). Searchers including the French Navy, the U.S. Navy, and the Royal Canadian Navy that scoured the route, including Labrador, the northeast coast of the U.S. and {{the area around the}} St. Lawrence River. With no sign of the aircraft, further search efforts were abandoned.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath,</b> {{many people}} assumed Jack Fingleton, the only {{full-time}} journalist on either team, was responsible. This belief {{may have affected}} {{the course of his}} subsequent career. Fingleton later wrote that Donald Bradman, Australia's star batsman and the primary target of Bodyline, was the person who disclosed the story. Bradman always denied this, and continued to blame Fingleton; animosity between the pair continued {{for the rest of their}} lives. Woodfull's earlier public silence on the tactics had been interpreted as approval; the leak was significant in persuading the Australian public that Bodyline was unacceptable.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath,</b> the New Zealand Red Cross {{provided}} $10,000 (2004NZD) for essential relief supplies. In addition, the New Zealand government provided $70,000 {{for assistance}} in the most affected areas, after the country's Air Force dispatched a plane over Vanuatu {{to determine the extent}} of damage. The Government of Australia similarly sent a helicopter reconnaissance mission to determine damage, as well as two planes with $200,000 (2004AUD) in relief supplies, including 2,400tarps, 2,600water containers, and 5,200packets of water purification tablets. The French government also sent a helicopter and assistance as per the 1992 FRANZ Agreement between New Zealand, Australia, and France.|$|E
5|$|Marion Zimmer Bradley's The Firebrand {{features}} an even younger Troilus, just twelve when he becomes Hector's charioteer. (His brother {{wants to keep}} a protective eye on him now he is ready for war.) Troilus helps kill Patroclus. Although he manages to escape the <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> of Hector's death, he is wounded. After the Trojans witness Achilles' treatment of Hector's body, Troilus insists on rejoining the battle despite his wounds and Hecuba's attempts to stop him. Achilles kills him with an arrow. The mourning Hecuba comments {{that he did not}} want to live because he blamed himself for Hector's death.|$|E
5|$|No. 82 Squadron RAAF was a Royal Australian Air Force fighter {{squadron}} that operated during World WarII and its <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath.</b> It {{was formed}} in June 1943, flying Curtiss P-40 Kittyhawks and, initially, Bell P-39 Airacobras from bases in Queensland and New Guinea. The squadron became operational in September 1944, and undertook ground attack missions against Japanese targets in the Pacific theatre. Following the end of hostilities, No.82 Squadron was re-equipped with North American P-51 Mustangs and deployed to Japan, where it formed part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force. It remained there until October 1948, when it was disbanded.|$|E
5|$|No. 91 (Composite) Wing was a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) wing that {{operated}} {{during the}} Korean War and its <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath.</b> It {{was established in}} October 1950 to administer RAAF units deployed in the conflict: No.77 (Fighter) Squadron, flying North American P-51 Mustangs; No.30 Communications Flight, flying Austers and Douglas C-47 Dakotas; No.391 (Base) Squadron; and No.491 (Maintenance) Squadron. The wing was headquartered at Iwakuni, Japan, as were its subordinate units {{with the exception of}} No.77 Squadron, which was based in Korea and came under the operational control of the United States Fifth Air Force.|$|E
