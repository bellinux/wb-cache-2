5|$|The {{original}} Pool of Radiance game shipped with a 28-page introductory booklet, {{which describes}} secrets {{relating to the}} game and the concepts behind it. The booklet guides players through the character creation process, explaining how to create a party. The game also included the 38-page Adventurer's Journal, which provides the game's background. The booklet features depictions of fliers, maps, and information that characters see in the game. The package also included a translation <b>decoder</b> wheel. After the title screen, a copy protection screen was displayed consisting of two pictures and a line. The player was required to use the <b>decoder</b> wheel to line up the pictures, then enter the word revealed on the <b>decoder</b> wheel. After three unsuccessful attempts, the game automatically shut down.|$|E
5|$|Caesar ciphers can {{be found}} today in children's toys such as secret <b>decoder</b> rings. A Caesar shift of {{thirteen}} is also performed in the ROT13 algorithm, a simple method of obfuscating text widely found on Usenet and used to obscure text (such as joke punchlines and story spoilers), but not seriously used {{as a method of}} encryption.|$|E
5|$|Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD, {{introduced}} in 2006, offer high-fidelity audio features that require HDMI for best results. HDMI 1.3 can transport Dolby Digital Plus, Dolby TrueHD, and DTS-HD Master Audio bitstreams in compressed form. This capability allows for an AV receiver {{with the necessary}} <b>decoder</b> to decode the compressed audio stream. The Blu-ray specification does not include video encoded with either deep color or xvYCC; thus, HDMI 1.0 can transfer Blu-ray discs at full video quality.|$|E
5|$|The album's {{title was}} first {{announced}} in the liner notes of Bruce's solo album The Shining. Bang! Pow! Boom! was initially announced as having an April release. Bruce and Utsler participated in a three-day photo shoot for the album's promotional images. The album's release was preceded with a nationwide in-store tour beginning in August, and followed by a 64-day tour, including the group's annual Halloween performance in Detroit. The album was released in three different color variations of the cover: red, blue, and green. Each version features its own unique introduction and hidden track. A sampler for the album was released, featuring a <b>decoder</b> piece for finding hidden messages in the album's artwork.|$|E
25|$|The first {{processor}} with a Thumb instruction <b>decoder</b> was the ARM7TDMI. All ARM9 and later families, including XScale, have included a Thumb instruction <b>decoder.</b> The Thumb instruction set was originally inspired by SuperH's ISA; ARM licensed several patents from Hitachi.|$|E

25|$|If {{the symbol}} width is n, the codes of width n+1 fall {{naturally}} into two blocks: the lower block of 2n codes for coding single symbols, {{and the upper}} block of 2n codes {{that will be used}} by the <b>decoder</b> for sequences of length greater than one. Of that upper block, the first two codes are already taken: 2n for CLEAR and 2n + 1 for STOP. The <b>decoder</b> must also be prevented from using the last code in the upper block, 2n+1 − 1, because when the <b>decoder</b> fills that slot, it will increase the code width. Thus in the upper block there are 2n − 3 codes available to the <b>decoder</b> that won't trigger an increase in code width. Because the <b>decoder</b> is always one step behind in maintaining the table, it does not generate a table entry upon receiving the first code from the encoder, but will generate one for each succeeding code. Thus the encoder can generate 2n − 2 codes without triggering an increase in code width. Therefore the encoder must emit extra CLEAR codes at intervals of 2n − 2 codes or less to make the <b>decoder</b> reset the coding dictionary. The GIF standard allows such extra CLEAR codes to be inserted in the image data at any time. The composite data stream is partitioned into sub-blocks that each carry from 1 to 255 bytes.|$|E
25|$|FAAD2 is Freeware Advanced Audio (AAC) <b>Decoder</b> {{including}} SBR decoding. It is MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 AAC <b>decoder</b> {{and supports}} MPEG-4 audio object types LC, Main, LTP, LD, ER, SBR and PS, {{which can be}} combined also to HE-AAC and HE-AACv2 Profile (AAC LC+SBR+PS). It contains a library (libfaad) {{that can be used}} by other programs.|$|E
25|$|Legacy EIA-608 home caption <b>decoder</b> fonts had no {{descenders}} on lowercase letters.|$|E
25|$|VLC {{media player}} uses the FAAC (encoder) and FAAD (<b>decoder)</b> {{to provide support}} for AAC audio.|$|E
25|$|A <b>decoder</b> {{must be able}} to {{interpret}} critical chunks to read and render a PNG file.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the first}} two or three digits of the call were registered, the sender called in a <b>decoder,</b> which took the digits as input, and {{returned}} the District and Office brush and group locations for the sender. The <b>decoder</b> also determined the proper rate at which to operate the message register and gave this information to the sender, which set this rate for the call.|$|E
25|$|The monastery was {{featured}} in the 1981 James Bond film For Your Eyes Only. It features in the climax to the film where Bond ascends the rock cliff and intrudes upon Aristotle Kristatos and Erich Kriegler to retrieve the ATAC <b>decoder.</b> Aristotle Kristatos, played by Julian Glover, was using the monastery in the film as a hideout. Eventually Bond throws the ATAC <b>decoder</b> off the cliff top when approached by the KGB.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason why}} {{interleaving}} {{is used on}} OFDM is to attempt to spread the errors out in the bit-stream that is presented to the error correction <b>decoder,</b> because when such decoders are presented with {{a high concentration of}} errors the <b>decoder</b> is unable to correct all the bit errors, and a burst of uncorrected errors occurs. A similar design of audio data encoding makes compact disc (CD) playback robust.|$|E
25|$|The type of <b>decoder</b> {{circuitry}} {{is sometimes}} marked on televisions as CCT (Computer-Controlled Teletext), or ECCT (Enhanced Computer-Controlled Teletext).|$|E
25|$|Helium divers {{may need}} a <b>decoder</b> system (unscrambler) which reduces the {{frequency}} of the sound to make it more intelligible.|$|E
25|$|Early devices {{supporting}} Video CD playback {{include the}} Philips CD-i {{systems and the}} Amiga CD-32 (albeit via an optional <b>decoder</b> card).|$|E
25|$|Divers {{breathing}} helium {{may need}} a <b>decoder</b> system also called unscrambling, which reduces {{the frequency of the}} sound to make it more intelligible.|$|E
25|$|For older televisions, a {{set-top box}} or other <b>decoder</b> is usually required. In the US, since {{the passage of}} the Television <b>Decoder</b> Circuitry Act, {{manufacturers}} of most television receivers sold have been required to include closed captioning display capability. High-definition TV sets, receivers, and tuner cards are also covered, though the technical specifications are different (high-definition display screens, as opposed to high-definition TVs, may lack captioning). Canada has no similar law but receives the same sets as the US in most cases.|$|E
25|$|A 16 {{channel command}} control system named Zero 1 was {{introduced}} in late 1979. Zero 1 was based on digital, not analog, technology, and as such was a forerunner to the NMRA Digital Command Control (DCC) system, {{which appeared in the}} 1990s. Advertisements claimed that 16 locomotives could be operated independently at the same time. Though an important milestone, Zero 1 was not widely successful; the controller units and <b>decoder</b> modules required for the locomotives were expensive, but with clean track and well serviced locos the system worked well. Control of points and other accessories was available in a very simple manner. Locomotives equipped with a Zero 1 <b>decoder</b> could not be used on conventional direct current systems, making it difficult to run one's locomotives on friends' layouts or club layouts. This was a common issue with command control systems in that time period. Locomotives with no <b>decoder</b> could not be used on a Zero 1 layout either.|$|E
25|$|A vocoder, a {{portmanteau}} of {{the words}} voice and encoder, is an analysis and synthesis system, mostly used for speech. In the encoder, the input is passed through a multiband filter, each band is passed through an envelope follower, and the control signals from the envelope followers are communicated to the <b>decoder.</b> The <b>decoder</b> applies these control signals to corresponding filters in the (re)synthesizer. Research physicist Homer Dudley invented the Vocoder at Bell Labs in 1939 which served the purpose of improving the voice-carrying capabilities of his employer's telephone lines.|$|E
25|$|The watch's {{firmware}} {{operating system}} {{is based on}} a FreeRTOS kernel and uses Newlib, the STM32 Peripheral Lib, the Ragel state machine compiler, and an unnamed UTF-8 <b>Decoder.</b>|$|E
25|$|All {{versions}} of WMA released since version 9.0 - namely 9.1, 9.2 and 10 - have been backwards {{compatible with the}} original v9 <b>decoder</b> and are therefore not considered separate codecs. The sole exception to this is the WMA 10 Professional codec whose Low Bit Rate (LBR) mode is only backwards compatible with the older WMA Professional decoders at half sampling rate (similar to how HE-AAC is backwards compatible with AAC-LC). Full fidelity decoding of WMA 10 Professional LBR bitstreams requires a WMA version 10 or newer <b>decoder.</b>|$|E
25|$|FAAC or Freeware Advanced Audio Coder is a {{software}} project {{which includes the}} AAC encoder FAAC and <b>decoder</b> FAAD2. It supports MPEG-2 AAC as well as MPEG-4 AAC. It supports several MPEG-4 Audio object types (LC, Main, LTP for encoding and SBR, PS, ER, LD for decoding), file formats (ADTS AAC, raw AAC, MP4), multichannel and gapless encoding/decoding and MP4 metadata tags. The encoder and <b>decoder</b> is compatible with standard-compliant audio applications using {{one or more of}} these object types and facilities. It also supports Digital Radio Mondiale.|$|E
25|$|The answer, 34 is sent (shifted) {{back to the}} X register. From there, it is {{converted}} by the binary <b>decoder</b> unit into a decimal number (usually binary-coded decimal), and then shown on the display panel.|$|E
25|$|In 2007 the {{encryption}} {{scheme was}} overcome with a tool called dvdcpxm. On 12 February 2008 {{a program called}} DVD-Audio Explorer was released, containing aforementioned libdvdcpxm coupled with an open source MLP <b>decoder.</b>|$|E
25|$|The encoder and <b>decoder</b> support MPEG-4 AAC LC, HE-AAC (AAC LC + SBR), and HE-AACv2 (LC + SBR + PS) Audio Object Types. Sample rates up to 96kHz, and {{multichannel}} audio {{up to six}} channels (5.1 surround) are supported.|$|E
25|$|District and Office {{parameters}} were variable translations {{supplied by}} the <b>decoder,</b> while Incoming parameters and Final Brush were a fixed translation from the Thousands and Hundreds digits of the phone number, merely to adapt efficiently to {{the capabilities of the}} Panel selector.|$|E
25|$|A Teletext capable {{television}} was usually required to receive Teletext. With {{the arrival of}} digital television services such as Freeview, Teletext could be received through a Freeview <b>decoder.</b> In this case captions were normally accessed by subtitle button on a Freeview remote.|$|E
25|$|This {{structure}} {{allows the}} file to be parsed {{even if not}} all parts are understood. A GIF marked 87a may contain extension blocks; the intent is that a <b>decoder</b> can read and display the file without the features covered in extensions it does not understand.|$|E
25|$|QuickTime 6 added limited {{support for}} MPEG-4; {{specifically}} encoding and decoding using Simple Profile (SP). Advanced Simple Profile (ASP) features, like B-frames, were unsupported (in contrast with, for example, encoders such as XviD or 3ivx). QuickTime 7 supports the H.264 encoder and <b>decoder.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Telecommunications Act of 1996 {{expanded}} on the <b>Decoder</b> Circuity Act {{to place}} the same requirements on digital television receivers by July 1, 2002. All TV programming distributors in the U.S. are required to provide closed captions for Spanish-language video programming as of January 1, 2010.|$|E
25|$|In certain circumstances, {{a target}} process will filter any byte from the {{injected}} shellcode {{that is not}} a printable or alphanumeric character. Under such circumstances, the range of instructions {{that can be used to}} write a shellcode becomes very limited. A solution to this problem was published by Rix in Phrack 57 in which he showed it was possible to turn any code into alphanumeric code. A technique often used is to create self-modifying code, because this allows the code to modify its own bytes to include bytes outside of the normally allowed range, thereby expanding the range of instructions it can use. Using this trick, a self-modifying <b>decoder</b> can be created that initially uses only bytes in the allowed range. The main code of the shellcode is encoded, also only using bytes in the allowed range. When the output shellcode is run, the <b>decoder</b> can modify its own code to be able to use any instruction it requires to function properly and then continues to decode the original shellcode. After decoding the shellcode the <b>decoder</b> transfers control to it, so it can be executed as normal. It has been shown that it is possible to create arbitrarily complex shellcode that looks like normal text in English.|$|E
25|$|Many {{low-cost}} MP3 players simply add extra {{software and}} a battery {{to a standard}} flash memory control microprocessor so it can {{also serve as a}} music playback <b>decoder.</b> Most of these players can also be used as a conventional flash drive, for storing files of any type.|$|E
25|$|Chunk {{types are}} given a four-letter case {{sensitive}} ASCII type/name; compare FourCC. The case of the different letters in the name (bit 5 of the numeric value of the character) is a bit field that provides the <b>decoder</b> with some information {{on the nature of}} chunks it does not recognize.|$|E
25|$|CA {{have been}} applied to design error {{correction}} codes in a paper by D. Roy Chowdhury, S. Basu, I. Sen Gupta, and P. Pal Chaudhuri. The paper defines a new scheme of building single bit error correction and double bit error detection (SEC-DED) codes using CA, and also reports a fast hardware <b>decoder</b> for the code.|$|E
