40|$|We {{have focused}} on career ambitions of solo <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers</b> working in the {{construction}} industry. Previous studies on solo <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers</b> have paid attention to factors promoting entrepreneurship and neglected the career development of solo <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers.</b> Little {{is known about the}} career ambitions of solo <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers,</b> therefore it is difficult to predict how this group of workers on the labor market will develop over time. Currently, it is a challenge for policy makers to anticipate. To advance the knowledge on the career ambitions of solo <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers,</b> twenty Dutch solo <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers</b> are interviewed. The results showed {{that the majority of the}} solo <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers</b> who participated in this qualitative research mainly aims to continue their career. Some of them in combination with the ambition to innovate. Nearly all respondents prefer to work as a solo <b>self-employed</b> <b>worker,</b> and do not have plans to let their venture grow by employing employees. Instead, they tend to hire temporary workers or collaborate with other solo <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers.</b> In this regard, it can be said that, although they do not hire employees, solo <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers</b> contribute to work creation and, therefore, have a significant role in the contemporary flexible labor market...|$|R
30|$|Despite the {{political}} debate on dependent self-employment, we know little about dependent <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers</b> due to a lack of corresponding data. The British Labour Force Survey {{was the first to}} include variables that aid in identifying dependent <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers.</b> It is the only dataset that facilitates analysis over a longer period of time. The UK is also an interesting case because of its low level of labour market regulation and supposedly few incentives to circumvent regulations (Nickell and Quintini, 2002). Our first aim is to illustrate the prevalence and characteristics of dependent <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers.</b> Second, we analyse the characteristics of dependent <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers</b> with data from the British Labour Force Survey, investigating whether and how dependent <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers</b> differ from employees and (independent) <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers.</b> Third, we examine whether dependent <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers</b> are rather pushed than pulled into this labour market state by analysing the associations of “good” and “bad” characteristics. Fourth, we consider whether dependent self-employment provides the chance to exploit business opportunities (“opportunity entrepreneurship”) or if such workers lack alternatives (“necessity entrepreneurship”). Finally, although data limitations prevent us from testing the stepping-stone hypothesis, we analyse the short-term labour market behaviour of dependent <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers.</b> Prior to these analyses, we briefly discuss the legal context of dependent self-employment in the UK.|$|R

Although data limitations only allow a limited longitudinal analysis, we provide evidence {{that the majority of}} dependent <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers</b> remain in the labour market in the short run – either as self-employed or employed – and that only few leave the labour market. In addition, dependent self-employment does not create jobs for others; in our data, dependent self-employed individuals stop being dependent and self-employed because they increase their customer base or return to paid employment.|$|R

30|$|The {{increase}} of <b>self-employed</b> and family <b>workers</b> since 2002 can be mainly {{attributed to the}} {{increase of}} <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers</b> without employees (Solo-Selbstständige). In 2014, their share was 56 [*]%. The increase of <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers</b> without employees is supported by government aid. It can be assumed that one part of this increase {{can be attributed to}} the intensified use of labour market policy instruments, like interim payment (Überbrückungsgeld) and grants for business start-ups (Existenzgründungszuschuss). Since 2006, these labour market policy instruments are combined as start-up subsidies (Gründungszuschuss).

30|$|The {{working time}} of <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers</b> and family workers exceeds the annual hours worked of {{employees}} to a great extent. In 2014, <b>self-employed</b> and family <b>workers</b> performed on average 1973 h. In the 1990 s their annual working time was on average 320  h higher, but since 2001 it declines. This decline {{is due to}} the increasing share of <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers</b> without employees, with one third of them working part-time. As a result the part-time rate among <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers</b> strongly increased. One reason for this increase is the larger use of subsidized founding until 2011. Recent studies show that the working time in those newly founded establishments is lower than among traditional <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers,</b> and that self-employment in part-time seemed to be realised with this instrument (cf. Caliendo et al. 2009). Other studies also show that the foundation process in Germany seems to change from self-employment in full-time to part-time self-employment (cf. Brenke 2013).|$|R
30|$|This section aims {{to build}} an {{analytical}} framework to estimate the degree of underreporting of income by households with <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers</b> as household heads. The approach used here {{is based on the}} following main assumptions: (i) Food expenditures are correctly reported by households in budget surveys; but (ii) this not the case of income. Previous studies have qualified this second assumption setting that salary workers are completely honest by reporting their income while <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers</b> hide part of their earnings. However, we really think that a most adjusted picture to the real world involves salary workers (at least some of them) that also conceal partially their income, although in a lower degree than <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers.</b> Consequently, a natural test for measuring the relative extent of such a underreporting by <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers</b> consists of comparing food demand functions—which depend on income—of both groups.|$|R

However, determining whether dependent self-employment provides a stepping stone or dependently <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers</b> suffer long-term career and wage penalties is beyond the possible scope of our analysis due to data limitations. Since our data does not allow us to address the question of whether (or to what extent) dependently <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers</b> are dependent on their sole contractors, this is an issue for further research, possibly involving other research methodologies.|$|R

40|$|Despite {{interest}} in the historically ambiguous position of small entrepreneurs in the occupational and class structure, {{there has been little}} investigation of the lives of small-scale <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers</b> during industrialization. Using data from the 1880 manuscript census, city directories, and R. G. Dun and Company credit reports for Detroit, Michigan, this study explores employment status — self-employment versus wage employment — as a basis of occupational stratification. <b>Self-employed</b> <b>workers</b> in industrial Detroit were more likely than wage earners to have possessed social and labor market advantages. While <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers</b> were diverse in the occupations they held, they were more homogeneous than wage earners in their social characteristics and economic circumstances.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} pointed to the {{existence}} of barriers at the entry of self-employed sectors, such as liquidity constraints. In many countries, policies are directed toward removing these barriers in order to promote entrepreneurial activity. This paper examines whether such barriers exist by examining the amount of rent enjoyed by self-employed workers; if there are no barriers between the self-employed sector and the salary/wage sector, <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers</b> should not enjoy rents. Examination of the rent associated with self-employment, however, cannot simply be accomplished by comparing the incomes of <b>self-employed</b> and salary/wage <b>workers.</b> This is because <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers</b> may enjoy higher utility due to their work environment, with such benefits as autonomy and flexibility of work schedules. To overcome the difficulty of measuring self-employment rents, I use self-reported job satisfaction from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 79 (NLSY 79) to capture workers' overall satisfaction with their jobs. The results robustly indicate that <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers</b> are more satisfied with their jobs than salary/wage workers, even after allowing for the time-invariant individual heterogeneity in their reported job satisfaction. This result suggests that there are barriers at the entry into self-employment and that <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers</b> enjoy rents. Self-Employmen, Job Satisfaction...|$|R
30|$|We create {{alternative}} {{indicators of}} informality for robustness. The first alternative definition combines <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers</b> and salaried workers. Under this definition, formal workers are those with medical benefits, or, if no information on medical benefits is available, those whose firm size {{is greater than}} 20, government workers, {{and those in the}} military. <b>Self-employed</b> <b>workers,</b> casual workers, workers without medical benefits, and workers whose firm size is less than 20 and for whom we do not have information on medical benefits are coded as informal. The second alternative definition of informality does not include information on medical benefits, so we use only firm size and separate workers into three categories: salaried formal, salaried informal, and <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers.</b> The third definition assumes all <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers</b> and workers in firms smaller than 100 employees are informal. The last alternative definition uses information on medical benefits only. Workers reporting medical benefits are coded as formal, while those without medical benefits are informal; we define as missing the formality status of workers for whom information on medical benefits is not available. This last definition is the most restrictive and has the largest fraction of missing values.|$|R

30|$|These workers, who {{are between}} {{independent}} self-employment and dependent employment, may face {{two forms of}} dependence. The first dependence is economic in nature, implying that workers carry {{some or all of}} the entrepreneurial risk. Because such workers have only one contractor, they generate their whole income from this business relationship. If the two parties do not usually agree on a constant quantity of orders, instead – and quite contrarily – basing the amount of business the dependent <b>self-employed</b> <b>worker</b> receives on the economic situation of the firm the worker contracts with, the dependent <b>self-employed</b> <b>worker</b> obviously takes on the short-term risk of demand fluctuations. The second form of dependence relates to time, place, and content of work. Whether a dependent <b>self-employed</b> <b>worker</b> is more similar to employees or to independent self-employed persons is determined by the degree of these two forms of dependency.|$|R
