40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedThis {{is a highly}} graphic user-oriented interactive software product which will assist the user to become more proficient at recognizing and employing Navy signal <b>flags</b> <b>and</b> <b>pennants</b> which are used for visual communications between naval vessels of all types. A tutorial portion of {{the program has been}} designed with a number of options, thereby allowing a user to tailor a recognition program to satisfy specific learning requirements. The program is also capable of graphically displaying any grouping of <b>flags</b> <b>and</b> <b>pennants</b> chosen by the user in flaghoist order. When the <b>flags</b> <b>and</b> <b>pennants</b> are arranged in accordance with the procedural doctrine set forth in the ALLIED MARITIME TACTICAL SIGNAL BOOK, ATP 1 (B), Volume II, the program demonstrates the capability of decoding the displayed signal into its predetermined meaning. The current program is resident in the Secure Command, Control and Communications Exercise Laboratory (C 3 Lab) at the Navy Postgraduate School. [URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|R

5000|$|The gin pennant {{exists in}} several variants. Due to their rather {{informal}} nature, gin pennants may be improvised or customized from available <b>flags</b> <b>and</b> <b>pennants.</b> The simplest {{option is to}} fly the [...] "starboard" [...] manoeuvering signal pennant (a pennant with a white field, and green hoist and fly).|$|R
25|$|The rank <b>flags</b> <b>and</b> <b>pennants</b> of the Spanish Republican Navy {{followed}} the same pattern that had been established for the Spanish Navy in 1914. The only changes were the stripes of equal width and the replacing of the red color of the lower stripe with the morado of the Republican Tricolor.|$|R
50|$|The <b>flag</b> <b>and</b> <b>pennant</b> {{patterns}} are commonly found {{patterns in the}} price charts of financially traded assets (stocks, bonds, futures, etc.).

5000|$|The {{overall design}} and {{dimensions}} correspond {{closely to the}} flag illustration in the 1828"Flags, standards, <b>and</b> <b>pennants</b> of the Russian Empire and their use at present" [...] {{one of the earliest}} official versions of the RAC flag other than the 1806 edict.A similar eagle-centered design occurs again in another governmental flag album, [...] "Album of Standards, <b>Flags</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pennants,</b> used in the Russian Empire" [...] dated 1835.|$|R
50|$|Many Dutchmen {{celebrated on}} the streets while {{preparing}} to receive and cheer on the Allied liberators. Dutch <b>and</b> Orange <b>flags</b> <b>and</b> <b>pennants</b> were prepared, <b>and</b> many workers left their workplace {{to wait for the}} Allies to arrive. German occupation forces and NSB members panicked: documents were destroyed and many fled the Netherlands for Germany.|$|R
5000|$|In 1935 the Ubek were {{replaced}} by hydrographic offices subordinate to {{the commander of the}} fleets and flotillas. In 1937 the 'Hydrographic Office UVMS Red Army' was renamed the [...] "Hydrographic Office of the Workers' and Peasants' Navy" [...] —Гидрографическое управление Рабоче-крестьянского Военно-морского флота (РК ВМФ). The design of the <b>flags</b> <b>and</b> <b>pennants</b> used by the office also underwent changes.|$|R
500|$|The {{origin of}} the legend is a speech made by Bertrand Barère at the National Convention on 21 messidor (9 July), Rapport sur l'héroïsme des Républicains montant le vaisseau le Vengeur, where he claimed that Vengeur had refused to surrender, nailing her <b>flag,</b> <b>and</b> that all the sailors had died with the ship, giving a last shout of [...] "long live the Republic" [...] and waving all sorts of <b>flags</b> <b>and</b> <b>pennants</b> while the ship disappeared.|$|R
5|$|The <b>flags</b> <b>and</b> <b>pennants</b> {{point to}} the low pressure, so it is {{possible}} to determine at which hemisphere the station is standing. The barbs in the figure at the right are located at the Northern Hemisphere, because the wind is circling counter clock-wise around a low-pressure area at the Northern Hemisphere (the wind is blowing in the opposite direction at the Southern Hemisphere, see also Buys Ballot's law).|$|R
5000|$|Only heraldic tinctures are used. These are the metals, gold (Or) {{and silver}} (Argent); and the colors, red (Gules), blue (Azure), black (Sable) and green (Vert). In heraldic {{drawings}} yellow {{can be used}} in place of gold and white in place of silver. In <b>flags</b> <b>and</b> <b>pennants</b> this is almost always done nowadays. Heraldic colours are bright and clean; tones of the colours are picked from center of the scale.|$|R

60|$|From {{the deck}} of the Amoz I scanned the shore through the glasses that Perry had brought with him. When we were close enough for the glasses to be of value I saw that there was indeed a vast {{concourse}} of warriors entirely encircling the walled-village of Goork, chief of the Thurians. As we approached smaller objects became distinguishable. It was then that I discovered numerous <b>flags</b> <b>and</b> <b>pennants</b> floating above the army of the besiegers.|$|R
50|$|A set of galleys and gondolas {{were used}} both {{to cross the}} Pisuerga river and for the shows during the festivities. One of these ships was the royal galley “San Felipe”, named in the king’s honor and painted in blue and gold tones by Santiago de las Cuevas in 1602. That same year, artist Bartolomeo Carducci painted two royal coat of arms in the pennants of a new gondola, while Santiago Remesal {{decorated}} the ship with banners, <b>flags</b> <b>and</b> <b>pennants</b> that included religious symbols, the royal emblems and the coat of arms of Valladolid.|$|R
50|$|The Triumphal arches for {{the arrival}} of Isabel II to Seville were triumphal arches that rose in the city of Seville in September 1862 to welcome Queen Isabel II of Spain and her royal husband Don Francis of Assisi, who arrived on the day 17 to the old former Cordoba Station located at the Campo de Marte, where it had {{arranged}} one arch, after which was placed in the place a street of <b>flags</b> <b>and</b> <b>pennants</b> by which marched the sovereigns together with the Dukes of Montpensier, who had come welcome to them.|$|R
5000|$|In 1924 the Hydrographic Office {{was renamed}} the 'Central Hydrographic Department of the USSR' {{and a set}} of new <b>flags</b> <b>and</b> <b>pennants</b> was issued.

5000|$|... ==History== The North Brabantian flag {{dates from}} the Middle Ages. The colors gules and argent are used in Brabant standards, <b>flags</b> <b>and</b> <b>pennants</b> since the {{proclamation}} of the County of Louvain (942 CE) during the Lotharingian period. Later the Duchy of Brabant took these colors on. During the Middle Ages and the centuries after the red and white would be often used. Ships sailed under a red-white flag, especially in Antwerp. At {{the end of the}} 18th century the flag fell into disuse. Only since 1959 has the red <b>and</b> white checkered <b>flag</b> become the official flag of the province of North Brabant.|$|R
50|$|Born Susanne Faye Tzeporah Berman, {{she grew}} up in London, Ontario, the third of four {{siblings}} in a middle-class Jewish family. Her father owned a small advertising company and her mother had a business that made promotional <b>flags</b> <b>and</b> <b>pennants.</b> The family spent summers at her mother’s family's cottage in Lake of the Woods. Her father died when Berman was in her early teens and her mother died two years later. Her older sister, Corrine, who was then twenty, persuaded the authorities to allow the four children—including her other sister Wendy and younger brother Steven—to remain together until Corrine turned twenty-one and could assume legal custody.|$|R
50|$|In {{the middle}} of the fresco Guidoriccio da Fogliano, a condottiero (mercenary officer) and {{commander}} of the Sienese troops, is depicted on horseback. He is shown in profile with a Field Marshal’s baton in his  hand. On the left Montemassi can be seen surrounded by ramparts. To the right of the central figure of Guidoriccio there is a siege engine with the flag of the Sienese Republic in top. Further to the right there is a group of tents {{at the foot of a}} hill, with white <b>and</b> black <b>flags</b> <b>and</b> <b>pennants</b> flying. At the bottom of the fresco the year of the conquest of Montemassi by Sienese troops (1328) is given in Roman numerals: MCCC.XX.VIII.|$|R

5000|$|The {{flag was}} {{designed}} {{in a contest}} conceived by Springfield resident and famed poet Vachel Lindsay. The contest {{was sponsored by the}} Springfield Art Association and its winner was S.T. Wallace. The Springfield city council adopted the flag design on October 22, 1917 and it was first displayed on November 8, 1917. Today the flag is adorned with the word [...] "Springfield, Illinois." [...] Older photographs, dated May 14, 1953, show the flag, absent its lettering. Indeed, the Springfield Code of Ordinances makes no stipulation for the lettering which appears on the current flag. Instead, it describes a [...] "pennant," [...] similar in description to the flag. The pennant is described as containing the same elements and proportions as the flag, with the addition of the words. In the code the <b>flag</b> <b>and</b> <b>pennant</b> are described as two separate entities.|$|R
40|$|We {{define a}} novel {{criterion}} of pattern similarity in financial time series data. This criterion is robust, and concurs with human intuition. For fast pattern matching, we introduce a hierarchical piecewise linear representation of financial time series data. The {{piecewise linear approximation}} greatly reduces {{the complexity of the}} raw data, and the hierarchical representation keeps the structure of the time series data. 1 Introduction 1. 1 Patterns in the stock times series data In forecasting stock market, a popular method is to identify prototype patterns in the charts (plots of stock time series data), and forecast the future trend based on these chart patterns. Frequently used patterns include: symmetrical triangles, ascending triangles, descending triangles, Wedges, <b>flags</b> <b>and</b> <b>pennants,</b> rectangles, head <b>and</b> shoulders. Another related problem is to find patterns in the historical data that are similar to the current stock market pattern because many people believe that [...] ...|$|R

5|$|Assuming this {{warning shot}} {{had been fired}} {{in the belief that}} his brig, which was not flying a flag, may be an enemy vessel, Barlow ordered the British naval ensign <b>and</b> the <b>pennant</b> of the Channel Fleet run up. Thus clearly {{identified}} as a neutral British warship, Barlow allowed Childers to drift closer inshore with the tide. The French battery responded by raising tricolour <b>flags</b> <b>and</b> red <b>pennants,</b> a move copied by the other batteries covering the Goulet. Having drifted much closer to two batteries Childers suddenly came under heavy fire, the batteries containing very large 48-pounder cannon.|$|R
5000|$|Tower ships (lou chuan); {{these ships}} have three decks {{equipped}} with bulwarks for the fighting lines, <b>and</b> <b>flags</b> <b>and</b> <b>pennants</b> flying from the masts. There are ports and openings for crossbows and lances {{at the sides}} there is provided felt, while (on the topmost deck) there are trebuchets for hurling stones, set up (in appropriate places). And there are also (arrangements for making) molten iron (for throwing in containers from these catapults). (The whole broadside) gives {{the appearance of a}} city wall. In the Jin period the Prancing-Dragon Admiral, Wang Jun, invading Wu, built a great ship 200 paces (1000 ft.) in length, and on it set flying rafters and hanging galleries on which chariots and horses could go. But if of a sudden a violent wind is encountered, (such ships are likely to) get out of human control, so they were judged inconvenient in practice warlike action. But the fleet cannot fail to be furnished with such ships, in order that its overawing might may be perfected.|$|R
50|$|The Kornilov Division, one of {{the crack}} units of the White Army, was named after him, {{as well as many}} other {{autonomous}} White Army formations, such as the Kuban Cossack Kornilov Horse Regiment.

50|$|It is {{the largest}} of its type in Germany and is {{especially}} noted for its graphically clear portrayal of Christ's suffering. The cross is 3.24 metres high and 1.94 metres wide; the figure of Christ is 2.09 metres tall and has an arm span of 2.09 metres. The torso, which {{was made in the}} 14th century, was carved by an unknown artist from walnut wood; from a single trunk of at least 48 centimetres in diameter. The sculptor used oak wood for the arms, and the two beams of the cross. The present smooth surface was originally embellished with wounds and veins made of filler and had a more sculpted appearance as well as being painted. The head appears rather small in proportion today, because it no longer has any of the original hair, which was made of tow and glue. Holes have been bored in the left breast and head in order to attach various relics, including a true cross relic. Hence, from quite early on, the Coesfeld Cross was believed to possess miraculous properties and was the destination of many pilgrimages. A cross is still {{at the heart of the}} tradition today. For the various festivals known as Kreuztrachten, streets and houses along the route of the procession are decorated with <b>flags</b> <b>and</b> <b>pennants,</b> not dissimilar to the custom in other Roman Catholic regions.|$|R

60|$|On Christmas day {{he went to}} Carlton Hall. It was {{a chance}} {{he did not want}} to miss, for very few {{students}} would be there. As it turned out he spent some pleasant hours. But before he left the club his steps led him into the athletic trophy room, and there he was plunged into grief. The place was all ablaze with <b>flags</b> <b>and</b> <b>pennants,</b> silver cups <b>and</b> gold medals, pictures of teams and individuals. There were mounted sculls and oars, footballs and baseballs. The long and proud record of the university was there to be read. All her famous athletes were pictured there, and every one who had fought for his college. Ken realized that here for the first time he was in the atmosphere of college spirit for which the university was famed. What would he not have given for a permanent place in that gallery! But it was too late. He had humiliated the captain of the baseball team. Ken sought out the picture of the last season's varsity. What a stocky lot of young chaps, all consciously proud of the big letter on their shirts! Dale, the captain and pitcher, was in the centre of the group. Ken knew his record, and it was a splendid one. Ken took another look at Dale, another at the famous trainer, Murray, and the professional coach, Arthurs--men under whom it had been his dream to play--and then he left the room, broken-hearted.|$|R
