25|$|Dry {{distillation}} or <b>destructive</b> <b>distillation,</b> {{despite the}} name, is not truly distillation, {{but rather a}} chemical reaction known as pyrolysis in which solid substances are heated in an inert or reducing atmosphere and any volatile fractions, containing high-boiling liquids and products of pyrolysis, are collected. The <b>destructive</b> <b>distillation</b> of wood to give methanol {{is the root of}} its common name – wood alcohol.|$|E
25|$|Methane can be {{produced}} by the <b>destructive</b> <b>distillation</b> of acetic acid {{in the presence of}} soda lime or similar. Acetic acid is decarboxylated in this process. Methane can be prepared from aluminium carbide by reaction with water or strong acids. It is also made by reducing a solution of methanol and concentrated hydrochloric acid with iron powder, giving water and ferrous chloride as byproducts.|$|E
25|$|Town gas is a {{flammable}} {{gaseous fuel}} {{made by the}} <b>destructive</b> <b>distillation</b> of coal. It contains a variety of calorific gases including hydrogen, carbon monoxide, methane, and other volatile hydrocarbons, together with small quantities of non-calorific gases such as carbon dioxide and nitrogen, and is used {{in a similar way}} to natural gas. This is a historical technology and is not usually economically competitive with other sources of fuel gas today.|$|E
25|$|Fernow's {{plan called}} for clearcutting the tract {{at the rate of}} several {{thousand}} acres per year to prepare for planting conifers. With an annual state appropriation for the college of only $10,000, Cornell entered into a contract with the Brookyn Cooperage Company for the project to be viable. Under terms of the contract, the firm was to take the logs and cordwood from the forest land for a 15-year period. (In the 1890s, the more valuable red spruce trees had been logged, leaving primarily northern hardwoods.) Fernow had a -long railroad spur built from Axton to Tupper Lake in order to deliver logs to the company's facility. The firm turned the hardwood logs into barrels and the cordwood into methanol and charcoal, through a process called <b>destructive</b> <b>distillation.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{oldest and}} the most common {{extraction}} method involves pyrolysis (also known as retorting or <b>destructive</b> <b>distillation).</b> [...] In this process, oil shale is heated {{in the absence of}} oxygen until its kerogen decomposes into condensable shale oil vapors and non-condensable combustible oil shale gas. [...] Oil vapors and oil shale gas are then collected and cooled, causing the shale oil to condense. [...] In addition, oil shale processing produces spent oil shale, which is a solid residue. Spent shale consists of inorganic compounds (minerals) and chara carbonaceous residue formed from kerogen. Burning the char off the spent shale produces oil shale ash. Spent shale and shale ash can be used as ingredients in cement or brick manufacture. [...] The composition of the oil shale may lend added value to the extraction process through the recovery of by-products, including ammonia, sulfur, aromatic compounds, pitch, asphalt, and waxes.|$|E
2500|$|More loosely, {{outside the}} field of {{petroleum}} chemistry, the term [...] "cracking" [...] is used to describe any type of splitting of molecules {{under the influence of}} heat, catalysts and solvents, such as in processes of <b>destructive</b> <b>distillation</b> or pyrolysis.|$|E
2500|$|In the 8th century AD, many {{roads were}} built {{throughout}} the Arab Empire. [...] The most sophisticated roads were those in Baghdad, which were paved with tar. [...] Tar {{was derived from}} petroleum, accessed from oil fields in the region, through the chemical process of <b>destructive</b> <b>distillation.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Methanol, {{also known}} as methyl alcohol among others, is a {{chemical}} with the formula CH3OH (often abbreviated MeOH). Methanol acquired the name wood alcohol because it was once produced chiefly as a byproduct of the <b>destructive</b> <b>distillation</b> of wood. [...] Today, industrial methanol is produced in a catalytic process directly from carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen.|$|E
2500|$|The name {{tar sands}} {{was applied to}} {{bituminous}} sands in the late 19th and early 20th century. People who saw the bituminous sands during this period {{were familiar with the}} large amounts of tar residue produced in urban areas as a by-product of the manufacture of coal gas for urban heating and lighting. [...] The word [...] "tar" [...] to describe these natural bitumen deposits is really a misnomer, since, chemically speaking, tar is a human-made substance produced by the <b>destructive</b> <b>distillation</b> of organic material, usually coal.|$|E
2500|$|This {{design of}} {{incinerator}} has 2 chambers: a primary chamber and secondary chamber. [...] The primary chamber in a rotary kiln incinerator {{consists of an}} inclined refractory lined cylindrical tube. The inner refractory lining serves as sacrificial layer to protect the kiln structure. This refractory layer needs to be replaced from time to time. Movement of the cylinder on its axis facilitates movement of waste. In the primary chamber, there is conversion of solid fraction to gases, through volatilization, <b>destructive</b> <b>distillation</b> and partial combustion reactions. The secondary chamber is necessary to complete gas phase combustion reactions.|$|E
2500|$|Aniline {{was first}} {{isolated}} in 1826 by Otto Unverdorben by <b>destructive</b> <b>distillation</b> of indigo. [...] He called it Crystallin. In 1834, Friedlieb Runge isolated a substance from coal tar that turned a beautiful blue color when treated with chloride of lime. [...] He named it kyanol or cyanol. In 1840, Carl Julius Fritzsche (1808–1871) treated indigo with caustic potash and obtained an oil that he named aniline, after an indigo-yielding plant, anil (Indigofera suffruticosa). In 1842, Nikolay Nikolaevich Zinin reduced nitrobenzene and obtained a base that he named benzidam.N2O3]), Bulletin Scientifique , 10 (18) : [...] 272–285. [...] Reprinted in: [...] N. Zinin (1842) [...] Journal für praktische Chemie, 27 (1): 140–153. [...] Benzidam is named on page 150.|$|E
2500|$|The center hub {{rotating}} assembly (CHRA) houses the shaft {{that connects the}} compressor impeller and turbine. It also must contain a bearing system to suspend the shaft, allowing it to rotate at very high speed with minimal friction. For instance, in automotive applications the CHRA typically uses a thrust bearing or ball bearing lubricated by a constant supply of pressurized engine oil. The CHRA may also be considered [...] "water-cooled" [...] by having an entry and exit point for engine coolant. Water-cooled models use engine coolant to keep lubricating oil cooler, avoiding possible oil coking (<b>destructive</b> <b>distillation</b> of engine oil) from the extreme heat in the turbine. The development of air-foil bearings removed this risk.|$|E

50|$|Historically {{the process}} of <b>destructive</b> <b>distillation</b> {{and other forms of}} {{pyrolysis}} led to the discovery of many chemical compounds or elucidation of their structures before contemporary organic chemists had developed the processes to synthesise or specifically investigate the parent molecules. It was especially in the early days that investigation of the products of <b>destructive</b> <b>distillation,</b> like those of other destructive processes, played parts in enabling chemists to deduce the chemical nature of many natural materials. Well known examples include the deduction of the structures of pyranoses and furanoses.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Destructive</b> <b>distillation</b> is the {{chemical}} {{process of the}} decomposition of feedstock by heating it to a high temperature; the term generally applies to processing of organic material {{in the absence of}} air or in the presence of limited amounts of oxygen or other reagents, catalysts, or solvents, such as steam or phenols. It is an application of pyrolysis. The process breaks up or 'cracks' large molecules.

50|$|<b>Destructive</b> <b>distillation</b> of any {{particular}} inorganic feedstock produces only a small range of products as a rule, but <b>destructive</b> <b>distillation</b> of organic materials commonly produces very many compounds, often hundreds, though not all chemical products of {{any particular}} process are of commercial importance. The distilled molecules are generally smaller and more volatile than the feedstock molecules, but some reactions polymerise or condense small molecules into larger molecules, including heat-stable tarry substances and chars. Cracking feedstocks into liquid and volatile compounds, and polymerising, or the forming of chars and solids, may both occur in the same process, and any class of the products might be of commercial interest.|$|E
