Despite the numerous well-preserved burials of that type investigated at the Oglakhty complexes, their chrono-logical position has remained unclear. From the early 20 th century until the present, 2 different time periods had been identified for the Tashtyk burials: (1) from the 1 st century BC until the 1 st century AD and (2) from the 1 st until the 2 nd century AD. New data obtained in the 1990 s suggested a different age for Tashtyk burials, namely the 3 rd– 4 th centuries AD. This considerable shift in chronology needed to be checked with independent data. The chronological position of one of the Oglakhty burials, tomb 4, has been investigated with the use of wiggle-matching, applied to wooden logs used in the con-struction of tomb 4. The resulting dates for this burial strongly suggest its age as being limited to the 3 rd– 4 th centuries AD, which is corroborated by the archaeological <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> the <b>imported</b> artifacts found in the grave and which is in agreement with the chronological position of the Oglakhty site, as proposed by previous investigations...|$|R

Results We found the best estimate R 0 = 1. 75 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 64 to 1. 88) for the basic reproductive number. Correlation analysis allows the selection of the most probable seasonal behavior based on the observed pattern, leading to the identification of plausible scenarios for the future unfolding of the pandemic and the estimate of pandemic activity peaks in the different hemispheres. We provide estimates for the number of hospitalizations and the attack rate for the next wave as well as an extensive sensitivity analysis on the disease parameter values. We also studied the effect of systematic therapeutic use of antiviral drugs on the epidemic timeline. Conclusion The analysis shows the potential for an early epidemic peak occurring in October/November in the Northern hemisphere, likely before large-scale vaccination campaigns could be carried out. The baseline results refer to a worst-case scenario in which additional mitigation policies are not considered. We suggest that the planning of additional mitigation policies such as systematic antiviral treatments might be the key to delay the activity peak in order to restore the effectiveness of the vaccination programs. </p...|$|R

Furthermore, 94 % of the indigenous cases in this time period were reported in Guangdong Province, 83 % of which were in Guangzhou City. In order to determine the possible determinants of the unprecedented outbreak in 2014, a population-based deterministic model was developed to describe dengue transmission dynamics in Guangzhou. Regional sensitivity analysis (RSA) was adopted to calibrate the model and entomological surveillance data was used to validate the mosquito submodel. Different scenarios were created to investigate the roles of the timing <b>of</b> an <b>imported</b> case, climate, vertical transmission from mosquitoes to their offspring, and intervention. The results suggested that an early imported case was {{the most important factor in}} determining the 2014 outbreak characteristics. Precipitation and temperature can also change the transmission dynamics. Extraordinary high precipitation in May and August, 2014 appears to have increased vector abundance. Considering the relatively small number of cases in 2013, the effect of vertical transmission was less important. The earlier and more frequent intervention in 2014 also appeared to be effective. If the intervention in 2014 was the same as that in 2013, the outbreak size may have been over an order of magnitude higher than the observed number of new cases in 2014. The early <b>date</b> <b>of</b> the first <b>imported</b> and locally transmitted case was largely responsible for the outbreak in 2014, but it was influenced by intervention, climate and vertical transmission.
