While there are scads of asset to this system, this sort of resource sharing permit new forms of information leakage across virtual machines. In this paper, we interrogate the time information parameter leakage through cache based side-channel attack and the usage of CPU-cache based side-channels in the cloud. Finally we developed a novel approach which is necessary to mitigate these kinds of attacks in the cloud environment, and correlated to traditional cloud technology...|$|E

40|$|The {{momentum}} behind Cloud Computing has revolutionized how ICT {{services are}} provided, adopted and delivered. Features {{such as high}} scalability, fast provisioning, on demand resource availability makes it an attractive proposition for deploying complex and demanding systems. Clouds are also very suitable for deploying systems with unpredictable load patterns including Critical infrastructure services. Though, the major obstacle in hosting Critical infrastructures is often a lack of assurance. The transparency and flexibility offered by the Cloud, abstracts per definition over e. g. data placement, <b>hardware,</b> <b>service</b> migration. This makes {{it very hard to}} assure security properties. We present an investigation of assurance approaches, an analysis of their suitability for Critical Infrastructure Services being deployed in the Cloud and presents our approach...|$|E
40|$|Cryptographic {{theory has}} {{provided}} the notion of provable security which is often unattainable ideal in practice. Theoretical work gains provable secure protocols only {{at the cost of}} efficiency. Theorists are moving from certain primitives towards powerful sets of primitives. That happens because provable secure protocols often have complex and obscure design, which leads to inefficiency and mistakes. To bridge the gap between cryptographic theory and practice, the Random Oracle Hypothesis was developed. This hypothesis allows to yield crypto protocols much more efficient than standard ones. The invention of Random Oracle Model was predefined by formal modeling and fundamental analysis of crypto protocols [1, 2]. The idea of random oracle builds on handling random functions in unusual way as explained by Goldreich, Goldwasser and Micali in [4]. This has done by simple admissions. We will term a man, an organization, a software or <b>hardware</b> <b>service,</b> or a group of people as &quot;a principal &quot; [3]. We provide al...|$|E

50|$|The {{concept of}} a Space Weather Economic Innovation Zone stems {{from the work of}} the American Commercial Space Weather Association (ACSWA) in 2015. The {{establishment}} of this economic innovation zone would encourage expanded economic activity developing applications to manage the risks space weather and would encourage broader research activities related to space weather by universities. The formation of a Space Weather Economic Innovation Zone would: encourage U.S. business investment in space weather services and products; support U.S. business innovation in space weather services and products; require U.S. government purchases of U.S. built commercial hardware, software, and associated products and services where no suitable government capability pre-exists; promote U.S. built commercial hardware, software, and associated products and services to international partners; designate U.S. built commercial <b>hardware,</b> <b>services,</b> and products as “Space Weather Economic Innovation Zone” activities; and track U.S. built commercial <b>hardware,</b> <b>services,</b> and products as Space Weather Economic Innovation Zone contributions within agency reports. In 2015 HR1561 provided groundwork where social and environmental impacts from a Space Weather Economic Innovation Zone could be far-reaching. U.S. built commercial <b>hardware,</b> <b>services,</b> and products can prevent economic disruptions and loss-of-life from societal risks resulting from space weather and an innovation zone would encourage the research and investment needed for this success. In 2016, the Space Weather Research and Forecasting Act (S. 2817) would potentially build on that legacy.|$|R
