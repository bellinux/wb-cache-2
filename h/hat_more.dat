He has parted brown hair, and he is seen without his <b>hat</b> <b>more</b> often than the other characters with distinctive headwear. As he is overweight, his body is wider, his hands noticeably larger and his head is a more elliptical shape {{in contrast to the}} circular heads of the other children. An additional curved line on his lower face represents a double chin.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} leaked online on July 1, 2009. Daniel Kreps of Rolling Stone said the music video was her weakest since [...] "Gimme More" [...] and {{highlighted}} the comparisons with [...] "Take a Bow", saying, [...] "while Madonna dressed {{the role of}} a distressed aristocratic senorita in the stands, Spears’ wardrobe and giant hat mirror the elite at the Kentucky Derby". He also said the idea was unoriginal and compared it to Spears' fragances commercials. [...] Nadia Mendoza of The Sun said, [...] "forget PVC catsuits and teeny weeny air hostess outfits. Britney Spears has gone all sophisticated on us" [...] and positively commented on the fashion, saying [...] "Britney dons a <b>hat</b> <b>more</b> suited to Ascot than a music video". Peter Gicas of E! commented that the video was a nice departure from her recent more choreographed videos, such as [...] "Womanizer" [...] and [...] "If U Seek Amy". He commended it for its [...] "more straightforward approach in telling a so-called story", but felt it was [...] "a bit too much like one of those overly dramatic fragrance commercials". OK! said the video was [...] "" [...] and also noted the difference from her recent videos.|$|E

50|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, these birds were hunted for their plumes which {{were used to}} {{decorate}} <b>hats.</b> <b>More</b> recently, their numbers have decreased in some regions due to increased competition and predation by large gulls, whose numbers have increased in recent times.|$|R

Mr. Ruck was unhappy, but he was a touching fatalist. “Well, they want to pick up something,” he contented himself with recognising. “That’s the principal interest for ladies.” ...|$|E

60|$|Renouard, with an irritated gesture, {{tilted his}} <b>hat</b> <b>more</b> forward on his eyes, {{as though he}} were bored. The Editor went on with the remark that to be sure neither he (Renouard) nor yet Willie were much used to meet girls of that {{remarkable}} superiority. Willie when learning business with a firm in London, years before, had seen none but boarding-house society, he guessed. As to himself in the good old days, when he trod the glorious flags of Fleet Street, he neither had access to, nor yet would have cared for the swells. Nothing interested him then but parliamentary politics and the oratory of the House of Commons.|$|E
60|$|His fingers aching and {{his brain}} astonished, Bonnet could not {{comprehend}} {{what sort of}} a man it was who stood before him. With hair purposely dishevelled; with his <b>hat</b> <b>more</b> slouched than usual; with his beard divided into tails, each tied with a different-coloured ribbon; with half a dozen pistols strung across his breast; with other pistols and a knife or two stuck into his belt; with his great sword by his side, and his eyes gleaming brighter than ever and a general expression, both in face and figure, of an aggressive impudence, Blackbeard stood on his stout legs, clothed in rough red stockings, and gazed about him. But {{the captain of the}} Revenge did not forget his manners. He welcomed Blackbeard with all courtesy and besought him to enter his poor cabin.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally {{the hunters}} and game wardens wear dark green {{clothing}} of thick felt, and fedora or trilby <b>hats.</b> <b>More</b> and more, traditional clothes are {{giving way to}} modern camouflage, and they may sadly soon be obsolete. Decorative hunting pins are extremely prized for Romanian hunters in their sporting hats, which depending on the wealth or type of hunter can range from a simple fresh branch of fir tree or pine to animal hair brushes or pheasant chest feather fans; the most expensive are usually silver cased badger and boar bristle tufts or capercaillie feather fans.|$|R
5000|$|An {{example of}} {{poisoning}} {{in the workplace}} {{can be seen from}} the phrase [...] "mad as a hatter" [...] (18th and 19th century England). The process for stiffening the felt used in making <b>hats</b> <b>more</b> than a hundred years ago involved mercury, which forms organic species such as methylmercury, which is lipid-soluble, and tends to accumulate in the brain, resulting in mercury poisoning. Other lipid-soluble (fat-soluble) poisons include tetraethyllead compounds (the lead in leaded petrol), and DDT. These compounds are stored in the body's fat, and when the fatty tissues are used for energy, the compounds are released and cause acute poisoning.|$|R

Throwing Antony Van Corlear, who, with his calico mare, formed his escort and army, a little in the advance, and bidding him be of stout heart and great mind, he placed himself firmly in his saddle, cocked his <b>hat</b> <b>more</b> fiercely over his left eye, summoned all the heroism of his soul into his countenance, and, with one arm akimbo, the hand resting on the pommel of his sword, rode into the great metropolis of the league, Antony sounding his trumpet before him in a manner to electrify the whole community.|$|E
60|$|Two men listened uneasily to this {{disparagement}} {{of their}} kind. One was Wells Pearson, foreman of the Mucho Calor cattle ranch. The other was Thompson Burrows, the prosperous sheepman from the Quintana Valley. Both thought Tonia Weaver adorable, {{especially when she}} railed at railroads and menaced men. Either would have given up his epidermis to make for her an Easter <b>hat</b> <b>more</b> cheerfully than the ostrich gives up his tip or the aigrette lays down its life. Neither possessed the ingenuity to conceive a means of supplying the sad deficiency against the coming Sabbath. Pearson's deep brown face and sunburned light hair gave him {{the appearance of a}} schoolboy seized by one of youth's profound and insolvable melancholies. Tonia's plight grieved him through and through. Thompson Burrows was the more skilled and pliable. He hailed from somewhere in the East originally; and he wore neckties and shoes, and was made dumb by woman's presence.|$|E

50|$|The U.S. Federal Army adopted Chasseurs {{during the}} Civil War as a {{scouting}} and skirmishing force for use against the Confederate army. Their uniform was patterned after the French style, with the short, vented coat, {{though they were}} issued grey kepis. A notable unit of Civil War Chasseurs were the 65th New York Volunteer Infantry (also known as the 1st United States Chasseurs). The Chasseurs {{were involved in the}} peninsula campaign, as well as the Appomattox campaign, and lost a total of 146 men.

60|$|The {{place was}} the Town Hall, the High School having proved {{too small for}} the number of the {{intended}} audience, and Lord Rotherwood having been captured, in spite of the Kittiwake being pronounced ready to sail, and all the younger passengers being actually on board, entertaining a party from Clipstone. There he sat enthroned on the platform, with portraits of himself, his Elizabethan ancestor, and the Prince of Wales overhead, and, in propria persona on either side, the Mayor of Rockstone, Captain Henderson, and a sprinkling of the committee, Jane, of course, being one; while in the space beneath was a sea of <b>hats,</b> <b>more</b> or less beflowered and befeathered.|$|R
60|$|In {{a suit of}} coarse flannel with horn buttons, {{a yellow}} neckerchief with draggled ends, an old <b>hat</b> <b>more</b> russet-coloured than black, and laced boots of the hue of his stony calling, Durdles leads a hazy, gipsy sort of life, {{carrying}} his dinner about {{with him in a}} small bundle, and sitting on all manner of tombstones to dine. This dinner of Durdles’s has become quite a Cloisterham institution: not only because of his never appearing in public without it, but because of its having been, on certain renowned occasions, taken into custody along with Durdles (as drunk and incapable), and exhibited before the Bench of justices at the townhall. These occasions, however, have been few and far apart: Durdles being as seldom drunk as sober. For the rest, he is an old bachelor, and he lives in a little antiquated hole of a house that was never finished: supposed to be built, so far, of stones stolen from the city wall. To this abode there is an approach, ankle-deep in stone chips, resembling a petrified grove of tombstones, urns, draperies, and broken columns, in all stages of sculpture. Herein two journeymen incessantly chip, while other two journeymen, who face each other, incessantly saw stone; dipping as regularly in and out of their sheltering sentry-boxes, as if they were mechanical figures emblematical of Time and Death.|$|E
60|$|August 27th.--I {{have been}} {{stationed}} all {{day at the}} end of Long Wharf, and I rather think that I had the most eligible situation of anybody in Boston. I was aware that it must be intensely hot {{in the midst of the}} city; but there was only a short space of uncomfortable heat in my region, half-way towards the centre of the harbor; and almost all the time there was a pure and delightful breeze, fluttering and palpitating, sometimes shyly kissing my brow, then dying away, and then rushing upon me in livelier sport, so that I was fain to settle my straw <b>hat</b> <b>more</b> tightly upon my head. Late in the afternoon, there was a sunny shower, which came down so like a benediction that it seemed ungrateful to take shelter in the cabin or to put up an umbrella. Then there was a rainbow, or a large segment of one, so exceedingly brilliant and of such long endurance that I almost fancied it was stained into the sky, and would continue there permanently. And there were clouds floating all about,-- great clouds and small, of all glorious and lovely hues (save that imperial crimson which was revealed to our united gaze),--so glorious indeed, and so lovely, that I had a fantasy of heaven's being broken into fleecy fragments and dispersed through space, with its blest inhabitants dwelling blissfully upon those scattered islands.|$|E
50|$|The term {{can apply}} to a {{somewhat}} different style of <b>hat,</b> <b>more</b> like a sombrero de catite without quite such a high conical crown, and {{with a sort of}} a small pompom dangling from a cord at the top, which falls {{to one side of the}} hat.|$|E

Jackie, by contrast, has yet to master his self-destructive impulses, but at least he knows that the point of getting sober is not to become more efficient at taking advantage of other people: [...] "Your - whaddyacallit - your world view? It ain't mine. And the day it is, that's the day I shoot myself in the head. I didn't get clean to live like that."... Don't let the stupid title put you off.

50|$|The slouch hat or Terai hat is also {{associated}} with the Koninklijk Nederlands Indisch Leger (Dutch East Indies Army), and Gurkha regiments of the British Army and Indian Army (formerly the British Indian Army) and although it is still worn by the Gurkhas, the hat is no longer worn on active service. The 2nd Gurkha Rifles became the first Gurkha regiment to adopt the slouch hat when they were issued with the Australian variant in 1901. The Gurkha terai hat is created by fusing two hats into one to make the <b>hat</b> <b>more</b> rigid and is worn at an angle, tilted to the right. The Chindits and other units of Field Marshal William Slim's British Fourteenth Army, who fought against the Japanese in the Far East during World War II, also became associated with the slouch hat (also known as the bush hat in the British Army). The slouch hat was also used by colonial units of the British Empire, including the Royal West African Frontier Force, the Canadian Yukon Field Force, Canadian Pacific Railway Militia, the Kenya Regiment and troops from Rhodesia.|$|E
