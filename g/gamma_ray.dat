5|$|<b>Gamma</b> <b>ray</b> {{astronomy}} observes astronomical objects at {{the shortest}} wavelengths {{of the electromagnetic}} spectrum. Gamma rays may be observed directly by satellites such as the Compton <b>Gamma</b> <b>Ray</b> Observatory or by specialized telescopes called atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes. The Cherenkov telescopes do not detect the gamma rays directly but instead detect the flashes of visible light produced when gamma rays are absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|<b>Gamma</b> <b>ray</b> telescopes {{collect and}} measure individual, high energy gamma rays from astrophysical sources. These are {{absorbed by the}} atmosphere, {{requiring}} that observations are done by high-altitude balloons or space missions. Gamma rays can be generated by supernovae, neutron stars, pulsars and black holes. <b>Gamma</b> <b>ray</b> bursts, with extremely high energies, have also been detected but {{have yet to be}} identified.|$|E
5|$|About one in 100,000alpha {{emissions}} causes an excitation in {{the nucleus}} which then {{results in the}} emission of a <b>gamma</b> <b>ray</b> with a maximum energy of 803keV.|$|E
50|$|Ultra-high-energy <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> are <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> with photon {{energies}} {{higher than}} 100 TeV (0.1 PeV). They have a frequency higher than 2.42 × 1028 Hz and a wavelength shorter than 1.24 × 10−20 m. , they are theoretical only {{and have not}} been detected. The highest energy astronomical sourced <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> detected are very-high-energy <b>gamma</b> <b>rays.</b>|$|R
25|$|Natural {{sources of}} <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> on Earth are {{observed}} in the gamma decay of radionuclides and secondary radiation from atmospheric interactions with cosmic ray particles. There are rare terrestrial natural sources, such as lightning strikes and terrestrial gamma-ray flashes, that produce <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> not of a nuclear origin. Additionally, <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> are produced {{by a number of}} astronomical processes in which very high-energy electrons are produced, that in turn cause secondary <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> via bremsstrahlung, inverse Compton scattering, and synchrotron radiation. However, a large fraction of such astronomical <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> are screened by Earth's atmosphere and can only be detected by spacecraft. <b>Gamma</b> <b>rays</b> are produced by nuclear fusion in stars including the Sun (such as the CNO cycle), but are absorbed or inelastically scattered by the stellar material, reducing their energy, before escaping and are not observable from Earth as <b>gamma</b> <b>rays.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{distinction}} between X-rays and <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> {{has changed in}} recent decades. Originally, the electromagnetic radiation emitted by X-ray tubes almost invariably had a longer wavelength than the radiation (<b>gamma</b> <b>rays)</b> emitted by radioactive nuclei. Older literature distinguished between X- and gamma radiation {{on the basis of}} wavelength, with radiation shorter than some arbitrary wavelength, such as 10−11 m, defined as <b>gamma</b> <b>rays.</b> Since the energy of photons is related to wavelength, this past {{distinction between}} X-rays and <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> can also be thought of in terms of energy, with <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> being considered a higher-energy version of electromagnetic radiation.|$|R
5|$|When {{electrons}} and positrons collide, they annihilate each other, {{giving rise to}} two or more <b>gamma</b> <b>ray</b> photons. If the electron and positron have negligible momentum, a positronium atom can form before annihilation results {{in two or three}} <b>gamma</b> <b>ray</b> photons totalling 1.022MeV. On the other hand, high-energy photons can transform into an electron and a positron by a process called pair production, but only {{in the presence of a}} nearby charged particle, such as a nucleus.|$|E
5|$|Cobalt-60 (Co-60 or 60Co) {{is useful}} as a <b>gamma</b> <b>ray</b> source {{because it can be}} {{produced}} in predictable quantity and high activity by bombarding cobalt with neutrons. It produces two gamma rays with energies of 1.17 and 1.33MeV.|$|E
5|$|GRB970508 was {{detected}} by the <b>Gamma</b> <b>Ray</b> Burst Monitor on the Italian–Dutch X-ray astronomy satellite BeppoSAX. Astronomer Mark Metzger determined that GRB970508 occurred at least 6billionlight years from Earth; {{this was the first}} measurement of the distance to a gamma-ray burst.|$|E
50|$|Sufficiently {{energetic}} <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> {{can interact}} with nuclei, electrons, or {{one another to}} produce electron-positron pairs, and electron-positron pairs can annihilate, producing <b>gamma</b> <b>rays.</b> From Einstein's equation E = mc2, <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> must have more energy than {{the mass of the}} electron-positron pairs to produce these pairs.|$|R
25|$|The {{distinction}} between X-rays and <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> {{has changed in}} recent decades. Originally, the electromagnetic radiation emitted by X-ray tubes almost invariably had a longer wavelength than the radiation (<b>gamma</b> <b>rays)</b> emitted by radioactive nuclei. Older literature distinguished between X- and gamma radiation {{on the basis of}} wavelength, with radiation shorter than some arbitrary wavelength, such as 10−11 m, defined as <b>gamma</b> <b>rays.</b> Since the energy of photons is proportional to their frequency and inversely proportional to wavelength, this past {{distinction between}} X-rays and <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> can also be thought of in terms of its energy, with <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> considered to be higher energy electromagnetic radiation than are X-rays.|$|R
25|$|Natural {{sources of}} <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> on Earth include gamma decay from {{naturally}} occurring radioisotopes such as potassium-40, {{and also as}} a secondary radiation from various atmospheric interactions with cosmic ray particles. Some rare terrestrial natural sources that produce <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> that are not of a nuclear origin, are lightning strikes and terrestrial gamma-ray flashes, which produce high energy emissions from natural high-energy voltages. <b>Gamma</b> <b>rays</b> are produced {{by a number of}} astronomical processes in which very high-energy electrons are produced. Such electrons produce secondary <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> by the mechanisms of bremsstrahlung, inverse Compton scattering and synchrotron radiation. A large fraction of such astronomical <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> are screened by Earth's atmosphere and must be detected by spacecraft. Notable artificial sources of <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> include fission such as occurs in nuclear reactors, and high energy physics experiments, such as neutral pion decay and nuclear fusion.|$|R
5|$|On Thursday May 8, 1997, at 21:42 UTC, BeppoSAX's <b>Gamma</b> <b>Ray</b> Burst Monitor {{registered}} a gamma-ray burst {{that lasted}} approximately 15seconds. It was also detected by Ulysses, a robotic space probe designed {{to study the}} Sun, and by the Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) on board the Compton <b>Gamma</b> <b>Ray</b> Observatory. The burst also occurred {{within the field of}} view of one of BeppoSAX's two X-ray Wide Field Cameras. Within a few hours, the BeppoSAX team localized the burst to an error box—a small area around the specific position to account for the error in the position—with a diameter of approximately 10arcminutes.|$|E
5|$|The {{element is}} most {{dangerous}} if {{taken into the}} body. In addition, californium-249 and californium-251 can cause tissue damage externally, through <b>gamma</b> <b>ray</b> emission. Ionizing radiation emitted by californium on bone and in the liver can cause cancer.|$|E
5|$|With seven {{different}} instruments on board, Granat {{was designed to}} observe the universe at energies ranging from X-ray to <b>gamma</b> <b>ray.</b> Its main instrument, SIGMA, was capable of imaging both hard X-ray and soft gamma-ray sources. The PHEBUS instrument was meant to study gamma-ray bursts and other transient X-Ray sources. Other experiments such as ART-P were intended to image X-Ray sources in the 35 to 100keV range. One instrument, WATCH, was designed to monitor the sky continuously and alert the other instruments to new or interesting X-Ray sources. The ART-S spectrometer covered the X-ray energy range while the KONUS-B and TOURNESOL experiments covered both the X-ray and <b>gamma</b> <b>ray</b> spectrum.|$|E
40|$|An {{attempt was}} made to extract {{experimental}} data on baryon symmetry by observing annihilation products. Specifically, <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> and neutrons with long mean free paths were analyzed. Data cover absorption cross sections and radiation background of the 0. 511 MeV <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> from positron annihilations and the 70 MeV <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> from neutral pion decay...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> is {{fundamental}} for {{our understanding of}} the universe: <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> probe the most energetic phenomena occurring in nature, and several signatures of new physics are associated with the emission of <b>gamma</b> <b>rays.</b> The main science objectives and the status of the new generation high-energy gamma-ray astrophysics experiment AGILE are presented...|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} {{is made of}} the interactions of very high energy cosmic ray protons with the relict radiation in extragalactic space. Two situations are examined: <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> derived from neutral pions -mesons produced in collisions in a nonevolutionary situation and <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> from electron pairs produced at early epochs. It is shown that the ultrahigh energy <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> could conceivably be of high enough intensity to be detected. The flux of <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> from the second process is {{not far from the}} diffuse background that was reported...|$|R
5|$|Cadmium zinc {{telluride}} (CZT) is a semiconductive alloy {{that can}} be divided into an array of small sensing devices. These devices are similar to an integrated circuit and can detect the energy of incoming <b>gamma</b> <b>ray</b> photons. When behind an absorbing mask, the CZT sensor array can determine the direction of the rays.|$|E
5|$|HS 1216+5032 is a bright, gravitationally-lensed pair of quasars. W Comae Berenices (or ON 231), a blazar in the constellation's northwest, was {{originally}} designated a variable star and later {{found to be}} a BL Lacertae object. As of 2009, it had the most intense <b>gamma</b> <b>ray</b> spectrum of the sixty known gamma-ray blazars.|$|E
5|$|Other discoveries {{made with}} Hubble data include proto-planetary disks (proplyds) in the Orion Nebula; {{evidence}} {{for the presence of}} extrasolar planets around Sun-like stars; and the optical counterparts of the still-mysterious <b>gamma</b> <b>ray</b> bursts. HST has also been used to study objects in the outer reaches of the Solar System, including the dwarf planets Pluto and Eris.|$|E
40|$|Glycine (50 mg / 10 mL FX) {{system can}} be used in the dose range of 500 to 4000 Gy for Cobalt- 60 <b>gamma</b> <b>rays.</b> The energy {{dependency}} study for the glycine system was carried out by comparing its dose response for Cesium– 137 <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> and 7 MeV electron beam with the dose response for Cobalt- 60 <b>gamma</b> <b>rays.</b> It was found that for both the radiations viz. : Cesium- 137 <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> and electrons, there is no significant change in dose response as compared with that for Cobalt- 60. </span...|$|R
50|$|In {{very large}} hot stars, {{pressure}} from <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> in the stellar core keeps the upper {{layers of the}} star supported against gravitational pull from the core. If the energy density of <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> is suddenly reduced, then the outer layers of the star will collapse inwards. The sudden heating and compression of the core generates <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> energetic enough to be converted into an avalanche of electron-positron pairs, further reducing the pressure. When the collapse stops, the positrons find electrons and the pressure from <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> is driven up, again.|$|R
40|$|Shielding {{neutrons}} involve {{three steps}} that are slowing neutrons, absorption of neutrons, and impregnation of <b>gamma</b> <b>rays.</b> Neutrons slow down with thermal energy by hydrogen, water, paraffin, plastic. Hydrogenated materials {{are also very}} effective for the absorption of neutrons. <b>Gamma</b> <b>rays</b> are produced by neutron (radiation) retention on the neutron shield, inelastic scattering, and degradation of activation products. If a source emits <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> at various energies, high-energy <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> sometimes specify shielding requirements. Multipurpose Materials for Neutron Shields; Concrete, especially with barium mixed in, can slow and absorb the neutrons, and shield the <b>gamma</b> <b>rays.</b> Plastic with boron {{is also a good}} multipurpose shielding material. In this study; new applications and developments in the area of neutron shielding will be discussed in terms of different materials...|$|R
5|$|Following his {{political}} stances, Morrison's attention began drifting towards the stars. In 1954, he published a paper with Bruno Rossi and Stanislaw Olbert {{in which they}} explored Enrico Fermi's theory of how cosmic rays travel through the galaxy. Morrison followed this up with a review of theories {{of the origins of}} cosmic rays in 1957. A 1958 paper in Nuovo Cimento is considered to mark the birth of <b>gamma</b> <b>ray</b> astronomy.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of a massive companion brings many other possibilities. If Eta Carinae A was rapidly stripped of its outer layers, {{it might be a}} less massive WC- or WO-type star when core collapse was reached. This would result in a type Ib or type Ic supernova {{due to the lack of}} hydrogen and possibly helium. This supernova type is thought to be the originator of certain classes of <b>gamma</b> <b>ray</b> bursts, but models predict they occur only normally in less massive stars.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} of energy at the core is the reason stars shine so brightly: every time two or more atomic nuclei fuse {{together to form a}} single atomic nucleus of a new heavier element, <b>gamma</b> <b>ray</b> photons are released from the nuclear fusion product. This energy is converted to other forms of electromagnetic energy of lower frequency, such as visible light, by the time it reaches the star's outer layers.|$|E
5000|$|How are <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> and {{neutrons}} {{produced by}} cosmic rays? Incoming cosmic rays—some of the highest-energy particles—collide with {{the nucleus of}} atoms in the soil. When nuclei are hit with such energy, neutrons are released, which scatter and collide with other nuclei. The nuclei get [...] "excited" [...] in the process, and emit <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> to release the extra energy so they can return to their normal rest state. Some elements like potassium, uranium, and thorium are naturally radioactive and give off <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> as they decay, but all elements can be excited by collisions with cosmic <b>rays</b> to produce <b>gamma</b> <b>rays.</b> The HEND and Neutron Spectrometers on GRS directly detect scattered neutrons, and the gamma sensor detects the <b>gamma</b> <b>rays.</b>|$|R
40|$|Gamma-ray {{production}} processes are considered, {{taking into account}} Compton scattering between cosmic-ray electrons and starlight microwave background photons, synchrotron radiation, bremsstrahlung interactions, nucleon-antinucleon annihilations, {{the form of the}} spectrum from pion production at high energies, and <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> from photomeson production at ultrahigh energies. Attention is also given to gamma-ray absorption mechanisms, <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> observed from the Galaxy, and extragalactic <b>gamma</b> <b>rays...</b>|$|R
50|$|At {{the very}} high density of a large stellar core, pair {{production}} and annihilation occur rapidly. <b>Gamma</b> <b>rays,</b> electrons, and positrons are overall held in thermal equilibrium, ensuring the star's core remains stable. By random fluctuation, the sudden heating and compression of the core can generate <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> energetic enough to be converted into an avalanche of electron-positron pairs. This reduces the pressure. When the collapse stops, the positrons find electrons and the pressure from <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> is driven up, again. The population of positrons provides a brief reservoir of new <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> as the expanding supernova's core pressure drops.|$|R
5|$|A tidal {{disruption}} {{event of}} this sort is when a star interacts with a supermassive black hole shredding the star, {{and in some cases}} creating a relativistic jet which produces bright emission of <b>gamma</b> <b>ray</b> radiation. The event GRB 110328A (also denoted Swift J1644+57) was initially argued to be produced by the disruption of a main sequence star by a black hole of several million times the mass of the Sun, although it has subsequently been argued that the disruption of a white dwarf by a black hole of mass about 10 thousand times the Sun may be more likely.|$|E
5|$|After the war {{he became}} a {{champion}} of nuclear nonproliferation. He wrote for the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, and helped found the Federation of American Scientists and the Institute for Defense and Disarmament Studies. He {{was one of the}} few ex-communists to remain employed and academically active throughout the 1950s, but his research turned away from nuclear physics towards astrophysics. He published papers on cosmic rays, and a 1958 paper of his is considered to mark the birth of <b>gamma</b> <b>ray</b> astronomy. He was also known for writing popular science books and articles, and appearing in television programs.|$|E
5|$|Each {{dealt with}} a {{different}} aspect of the tests. The Naval Ordnance Laboratory handled the blast measurement tests, while the Naval Research Laboratory conducted the radiation measurement experiments, and Argonne National Laboratory did <b>gamma</b> <b>ray</b> measurements. Edgerton, Germeshausen, and Grier were contractors hired to design and install the timing and firing systems. Seven experimental weapon assemblies and six cores were delivered to San Pedro, California, and loaded on the weapon assembly ship USS Curtiss, in February 1948, but the Atomic Energy Commission only gave permission for the expenditure of three cores in the tests.|$|E
50|$|The neutrinos then {{interacted with}} protons in two tanks of water, {{creating}} neutrons and positrons. Each positron created {{a pair of}} <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> when it annihilated with an electron. The <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> were detected by sandwiching the water tanks between tanks filled with liquid scintillator. The scintillator material gives off flashes of light {{in response to the}} <b>gamma</b> <b>rays,</b> and these light flashes are detected by photomultiplier tubes.|$|R
40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} {{study of}} atmospheric <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> with energy greater than 30 MeV {{has been carried}} out. A knowledge of these atmospheric secondaries has significant applications {{to the study of}} cosmic <b>gamma</b> <b>rays.</b> For detectors carried on balloons, atmospherically produced <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> are the major source of background. For satellite detectors, atmospheric secondaries provide a calibration source. Experimental results were obtained from four balloon flights from Palestine, Texas, with a 15 cm by 15 cm digitized wire grid spark chamber. The energy spectrum for downward-moving <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> steepens with increasing atmospheric depth. Near the top of the atmosphere, the spectrum steepens with increasing zenith angle. A new model of atmospheric secondary production has calculated the depth, the energy, and the zenith angle dependence of <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> above 30 MeV, using a comprehensive three-dimensional Monte Carlo model of the nucleon-meson-electromagnetic cascade...|$|R
