The latter remark attracted as much criticism as anything <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> career.|$|E
5|$|Bede, who is {{the main}} source for this information, is unclear on his {{chronology}} relating to Wighard. At {{one point in the}} Historia Ecclesiastica, he states that Canterbury had been vacant for some time before Wighard's election, but in other writings he implies that Wighard was appointed soon after the conclusion of the Council of Whitby, which likely took place in 664. However Wighard was selected, he died in Rome. His death possibly occurred around 664, but could have been as late as 667. It may have been caused by the bubonic plague, or perhaps was due to some other disease epidemic. Like much <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> life, it is unclear if he was actually consecrated before his death. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography entry for Wighard states that he died before consecration. The historian Peter Blair, however, states that Wighard died {{as he was about to}} head home to Canterbury, after his consecration.|$|E

Simultaneously, he and two officers infiltrate Hoffman's command center in the junkyard, where they find Dan's corpse {{sitting in front of}} several monitors connected to the police headquarter's security cameras. He sees Hoffman brought into the morgue in a body bag and tries to warn Palmer, but an automatic turret gun rises up and kills him along with his men. Hoffman kills Dr. Heffner, Palmer, and everyone <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> path to Jill, who briefly escapes before she is caught and knocked unconscious. He straps her to a chair and locks a reverse bear trap to her head; she awakens as the timer starts and is killed when the trap activates, tearing her face apart and bleeding profusely.|$|E

25|$|Bronx native Nancy Savoca's 1989 comedy, True Love, explores two Italian-American Bronx sweethearts in {{the days}} before their wedding. The film, which debuted Annabella Sciorra and Ron Eldard as the betrothed couple, won the Grand Jury Prize at that year's Sundance Film Festival. The CBS {{television}} sitcom Becker, 1998–2004, was more ambiguous. The show starred Ted Danson as Dr. John Becker, a doctor who operated a small practice and was constantly annoyed by his patients, co-workers, friends, and practically everything and everybody <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> world. It showed his everyday life as a doctor working in a small clinic in the Bronx.|$|E

IBM lead negotiator Jack Sams insisted that he never met Gary, and one IBM colleague has confirmed that Sams said so at the time.

25|$|The Geek Chorus {{enters and}} informs the {{audience}} that Spider-Man has defeated his ultimate enemy, so their story is complete. Miss Arrow is convinced {{that they are not}} finished, because Spider-Man's real ultimate enemy should be unbeatable. So they introduce several villains which Spider-Man dispatches: Carnage, Swarm, Kraven the Hunter, Electro, The Lizard, and Swiss Miss (whom Miss Arrow invents on the spot). Throughout this super villain parade, we also learn that Peter and MJ have formed a relationship. With all of these villains afoot, Peter is exhausted and not paying much attention to her or anyone <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> life ("Spider-Man Rising"). As Peter sleeps one night, Arachne invades his dreams. She realizes that she will no longer be alone now that there is another spider to share her darkness ("Turn Off the Dark"). She begins to weave illusions in his mind, and Peter can't tell the difference between the dream and reality when he awakes. MJ becomes completely fed up with Peter's constant lateness and disregard for her after he does not show up for her new play ("Walk Away"). That night, he decides to abandon Spider-Man forever.|$|E

25|$|Some {{while after}} this, the Doctor was {{captured}} by Marnal, {{one of the few}} surviving Gallifreyans, and accused of destroying Gallifrey. Although Gallifrey had been all but wiped from history by the Doctor's actions, Marnal was able to jury-rig a Time Space Visualiser to witness the Doctor actually push the button as he faced off against the Grandfather, although there were about three minutes between the Doctor firing the shot and Gallifrey's actual destruction where the Doctor's activities in the TARDIS were unaccounted for. Reflecting on his discoveries in the TARDIS, the Doctor, along with the aid of K9 (who had been transported into a hidden area of the TARDIS and trapped there following Gallifrey's destruction) realised that his memory loss hadn't been caused by the trauma of destroying Gallifrey; in fact, the Doctor had wiped his memories to give his mind space to store the contents of the Matrix within his brain, compressed down so he wouldn't be driven mad by the voices of all the dead Time Lords within him, his own memories presumably stored somewhere <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> mind, given his occasional flashes from his past. However, right then, the Doctor had more immediate worries; namely, saving Earth from a species of massive fly-like aliens called the Vore, who would soon have the power to devour the planet. As The Gallifrey Chronicles ended, the Doctor, Fitz, and Trix dove into the Vore mountain, the Doctor equipped with a plan to stop the Vore and save the world.|$|E

The moral of the fable :if you're not sure where you're going, you're liable to end up some place <b>else.</b> Consequently, <b>in</b> <b>his</b> book, Mager speaks {{of the importance of}} knowing precisely what is needed to be achieved before embarking on any instructional design process.|$|R

He was full of the afterglow of his marriage; he was still young and psychologically ignorant; above all, he was now, really for the first time, sure {{that he was going to}} be at least some kind of success.
