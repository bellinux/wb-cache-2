40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} the results of a theoretical investigation on the influ- ence of different heat transfer correlations for finned-tubes to the dynamic behavior of a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG). The investigation was done for a vertical type natural circulation HRSG with 3 pressure stages under <b>hot</b> <b>start-up</b> and shutdown conditions. For the calculation of the flue gas side heat transfer coefficient the well known correlations for segmented finned-tubes according to Schmidt, VDI and ESCOATM (traditional and re-vised) as well as a new correlation, which was developed at the Institute for Energy Systems and Thermodynamics, are used. The simulation results show a good agreement in the overall behavior of the boiler between the dif- ferent correlations. But there are still some important differences found in the detail analysis of the boiler behavior...|$|E

40|$|In {{the field}} of {{concentrated}} solar power (CSP) plants, parabolic trough systems with thermal oil as heat transfer fluid represent the technically and economically most mature technology. Due to storage systems these plants produce electricity on demand. However, a considerable portion of the annually collected thermal energy is consumed for the start-up procedure. In fact, after shut-down periods thermal masses must be reheated and additionally further energy losses due to imperfect start-up procedures occur. The present work {{has been carried out}} within the TURIKON project. The main goal is to evaluate and to optimize the transient behavior, namely the start-up of parabolic trough plants with thermal oil. For this purpose, a dynamic model was developed. An internal DLR solar library was used for the modelling of the solar field while the power block is modelled with the publically available ThermoPower library where some components had to be adapted for the needs of CSP plants. In the present publication first results are shown in order to demonstrate the capabilities of the plant model. The dynamic behavior of the power plant during normal operating mode and during a warm and a <b>hot</b> <b>start-up</b> procedure is evaluated and the warm start-up procedure energetically optimized...|$|E

Simulation {{results are presented}} to demonstrate life extension of a typical power plant while satisfying the performance specifications. Key Words-Power-station control: feedforward control: robust control. Abatraet-The objective of life-extending control is to achieve a trade-off between structural durabiilty and dynamic performance. This paper focuses on structural durability of the main steam header under load following to illustrate how the life-extending control of fossil fuel power plants can be achieved via feedforward/feedback. This concept is poten-tially applicable to both new and aging power plants {{under a variety of}} operational modes such as <b>hot</b> <b>start-up,</b> scheduled shutdown, and load following where the plant power is rapidly maneuvered to meet the varying load demand. The feedforward control policy is synthesized via nonlinear optimization of a multi-objective cost functional of dynamic performance and service life under the constraints of actuator saturation, operational limitations, and allowable structural damage, including thermomechanical fatigue and plastic deformation. A linear robust feedback control law that is superimposed on the feedforward sequence is synthesized based on induced &-norm techniques. The results of simulation experiments are presented to demonstr-ate that the proposed feedforward/feedback control policy is potentially capable of ramping the plant power up at a rate of 10 % of the full load per minute while maintaining the specified performance and satisfying the damage constraints...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The paper {{presents}} the results of calculations of effort for the material of selected superheater chambers’constructional systems in unsteady operation conditions. Design/methodology/approach: In model tests, the influence was analysed of internal pressure andtemperature gradient in the chamber wall on the distribution and value of stress. In the calculations, the processof <b>hot</b> <b>start-up</b> of a boiler was simulated, which was accompanied by short thermal shock induced by rapid coolingof the chamber inner wall. Findings: The random nature of thermal shock, which in the industrial practice may occur in any row and to anynumber of coil pipes, determines the value of maximal stress and the area of its occurrence. It has a significantinfluence on the possibility of forecasting the durability of chambers in working conditions. Research limitations/implications: The research has evidenced a link between the method of forcingthermal shock and the value of maximal stress in the area of bridges. Practical implications: The research has demonstrated the existence of connection between the way of forcingthermal shock and the stress value which, depending on the variant of cooling the chamber, ranges between 150 - 370 MPa. These results are very important to the industry connected with the structure of pipelines. Originality/value: It was found that the primary reason for the superheater chamber damage, leading to crackformation, are thermal shocks. A link has been shown between the method of forcing the thermal shock and thevalue of maximal stress in the zone of bridges...|$|E
40|$|Spent {{nuclear fuel}} from {{commercial}} power reactors is reprocessed at the COGEMA plant in La Hague. After shearing and {{dissolution of the}} fuel assemblies, the hulls and nozzles are sent to COGEMA's new compaction facility (ACC) to reduce the final volume of waste. Technological waste generated in the reprocessing plant is also sent to the ACC facility. Compacted waste is characterized by two measurement stations: a gamma spectrometry station and an active and passive neutron measurement station. The main purpose of these measurement stations {{is to determine the}} guaranteed nuclear parameters of the compacted waste and their associated uncertainties: (1) total U and Pu masses, (2) Pu, Cm, and total alpha activities, (3) 137 Cs, 90 Sr- 90 Y, 241 Pu beta activities, (4) decay heat. After giving a description of the measurement stations, this paper will describe the qualification tests performed {{in the context of the}} ACC project. The extensive calibration tests performed on site with different sources and different waste matrices will be described (approximately 500 neutron and gamma experiments). Hot tests that were conducted after <b>hot</b> <b>start-up</b> at the end of 2001 and prior to the start of commercial operation will be also presented. A number of drums produced by the upstream facilities were introduced one by one into the ACC facility in order to avoid mixing of different fuel assemblies. This procedure allows comparison between characterization performed in the upstream facilities on the basis of fuel data available before processing and the measurements performed on the new ACC stations. These comparisons showed good agreement between the different methods of characterization and thus validated the innovative technologies and methods used by COGEMA for compacted waste generated by the ACC facility...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this work was to {{evaluate}} the chemical composition of particulate matter (PM) emitted by eight different light-duty vehicles. Exhaust samples from petrol and diesel cars (Euro 3 to Euro 5) were collected in a chassis dynamometer facility. To simulate the real-world driving conditions, three ARTEMIS cycles were followed: road, to simulate a fluid traffic flow and urban with hot and cold starts, to simulate driving conditions in cities. Samples were analysed for the water-soluble ions, for the elemental composition and for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), respectively, by ion chromatography, inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Nitrate and phosphate were the major water-soluble ions in the exhaust particles emitted from diesel and petrol vehicles, respectively. The amount of material emitted {{is affected by the}} vehicle age. For vehicles ≥Euro 4, most elements were below the detection limits. Sodium, with emission factors in the ranges 23. 5 – 62. 4 and 78. 2 – 227 μg km− 1, for petrol and diesel Euro 3 vehicles, respectively, was the major element. The emission factors of metallic elements indicated that diesel vehicles release three to five times more than petrol automobiles. Element emissions under urban cycles are higher than those found for on-road driving, being three or four times higher, for petrol vehicles, and two or three times, for diesel vehicles. The difference between cycles is mainly due to the high emissions for the urban cycle with <b>hot</b> <b>start-up.</b> As registered for elements, most of the PAH emissions for vehicles ≥Euro 4 were also below the detection limits. Regardless of the vehicle models or driving cycles, the two- to four-ring PAHs were always dominant. Naphthalene, with emission factors up to 925 μg km− 1, was always the most abundant PAH. The relative cancer risk associated with naphthalene was estimated to be up to several orders of magnitude higher than any of the chemical species found in the PM phase. The highest PAH emission factors were registered for diesel-powered vehicles. The condition of the vehicle can exert a decisive influence on both element and PAH emissions...|$|E

40|$|Increasing {{electrical}} power production from renewable sources {{has led to}} changing demands {{in the field of}} conventional power plants in recent years in Germany. Coal-fired power plants that have been designed for Base load operation must withstand frequent start-up and shut-down cycles at present and in the future. Therefore, thick-walled components {{have a negative impact on}} the required flexibility and the life expectancy of these components. The exchange (retrofit) of these components and the commercial impact on an economically optimized operation of the power plant, as well as the financial effect of the exchange of such critical components are investigated in this work. As an example a thick-walled steam outlet header was selected. Different materials and different loading characteristics (number of warm and <b>hot</b> starts) including <b>start-up</b> gradients were taken as variables during the optimization process. The component design is based on EN standards. Economic results of the retrofit of critical components were investigated with sensitivity studies. The results show, that material and manufacturing costs are less important compared to the loading characteristics (i. e. number of starts), the electricity price and the fuel costs. Even the change in the design specifications, with a resulting reduction in the wall thickness, leads to improved flexibility in the plant operation and an economic benefit, even without the use of different materials. Due to the modular design of the implemented methods, this optimization can be easily adapted to other components...|$|R
40|$|Wind power varies over time, mainly {{under the}} {{influence}} of meteorological fluctuations. The variations occur on all time scales. Understanding these variations and their predictability is of key importance for the integration and optimal utilization of wind in the power system. There are two major attributes of variable generation that notably impact the participation on power exchanges: Variability (the output of variable generation changes and resulting in fluctuations in the plant output on all time scales) and Uncertainty (the magnitude and timing of variable generation output is less predictable, wind power output has low levels of predictability). Because of these variability and uncertainty wind plants cannot participate to electricity market, especially to power exchanges. For this purpose, the paper presents techno-economic analysis of work of wind plants together with combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) plant as support for offering continues power to electricity market. A model of wind farms and CCGT plant was developed in program PLEXOS based on real hourly input data and all characteristics of CCGT with especial analysis of techno-economic characteristics of different types of starts and stops of the plant. The Model analyzes the followings: costs of different start-stop characteristics (<b>hot,</b> warm, cold <b>start-ups</b> and shutdowns) and part load performance of CCGT. Besides the costs, the technical restrictions were considered such as start-up time depending on outage duration, minimum operation time, and minimum load or peaking capability. For calculation purposes, the following parameters are necessary to know {{in order to be able}} to economically evaluate changes in the start-up process: ramp up and down rate, time of start time reduction, fuel mass flow during start, electricity production during start, variable cost of start-up process, cost and charges for life time consumption for each start and start type, remuneration during start up time regarding expected or unexpected starts, the cost and revenues for balancing energy (important when participating in electricity market), and the cost or revenues for CO 2 -certificates. Main motivation for this analysis is to investigate possibilities to participate on power exchanges by offering continues guarantied power from wind plants by backing-up them with CCGT power plant...|$|R
