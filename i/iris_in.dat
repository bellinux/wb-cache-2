5|$|Carnivàle {{interiors}} were filmed at Santa Clarita Studios in Santa Clarita, California, {{while the}} show's many exterior scenes were filmed on Southern California locations. The scenes of fictional California town of Mintern, where {{the stories about}} Brother Justin and <b>Iris</b> <b>in</b> Season 1 were based, were shot at Paramount Ranch in Agoura Hills. The carnival set itself was moved around the greater Southern California area, to movie ranches and to Lancaster, which were to replicate the states of Oklahoma, Texas, and New Mexico. The permanent filming location of the carnival in Season 2 was Big Sky Ranch, which was also used for Brother Justin's new home in fictional New Canaan.|$|E
5|$|The second plotline {{revolves}} around a Father Coughlin-esque Methodist preacher, Brother Justin Crowe (Clancy Brown), {{who lives with}} his sister <b>Iris</b> <b>in</b> California. He shares Ben's prophetic dreams and slowly discovers {{the extent of his}} own unearthly powers, which include bending human beings to his will and making their sins and greatest evils manifest as terrifying visions. Certain that he is doing God's work, Brother Justin fully devotes himself to his religious duties, not realizing that his ultimate nemesis Ben Hawkins and the carnival are inexorably drawing closer.|$|E
5|$|When {{the bust}} was first discovered, no piece of quartz to {{represent}} the iris of the left eyeball was present, as in the other eye, and none was found despite an intensive search and a then significant reward of £5 being put up for information regarding its whereabouts. Borchardt assumed that the quartz iris of the left eye had fallen out when the sculptor Thutmose's workshop fell into ruin. The missing eye led to speculation that Nefertiti may have suffered from an ophthalmic infection, and actually lost her left eye, though {{the presence of an}} <b>iris</b> <b>in</b> other statues of her contradicted this possibility.|$|E
50|$|It hybridises very readily {{with other}} Juno <b>irises</b> <b>in</b> the subgenus.|$|R
50|$|The {{habitat of}} the iris is {{threatened}} by human activity. Such as housing and road construction, also conversion of mountainsides to apple orchards. This separates the colonies and makes pollination even more difficult. In 2013, 3 Oncocyclus <b>irises</b> (<b>in</b> the Middle East) {{were thought to be}} extinct; Iris antilibanotica, <b>Iris</b> damascena <b>in</b> Syria and <b>Iris</b> westii <b>in</b> Lebanon.|$|R
50|$|A {{study was}} carried out in 2013, to find out what oils are {{contained}} in the rhizomes of various <b>irises</b> <b>in</b> Syria, including <b>Iris</b> germanica, I. barnumae, <b>Iris</b> bostrensis and <b>in</b> <b>Iris</b> auranitica. It found myristic acid, lauric acid, decanoic acid (capric acid), palmitic acid and methyl ester.|$|R
5|$|Publicity for <b>IRIS</b> <b>in</b> Japan {{was strong}} from its premiere and beyond. In late May 2010, {{a set of}} two concert events billed as {{dramatic}} live stage shows drew sold-out crowds that amounted to over 60,000 attendees. The concerts were a combination of live interviews {{with much of the}} primary cast, re-enactments of pivotal scenes from the series, and performances by the musical acts featured in its soundtrack. Broadcaster TBS revealed in June 2010 that airings of the series on its satellite offerings had broken records daily, doubling the ratings of its previous programs. Such was the influence of the series that flights between Seoul and Akita that had been nearing decommission were revitalized as a result of mounting tourist interest. Due to the commerce generated for Akita prefecture as a result of Iris having filmed there, local governments in Japan began competing for interest from producers in order to solicit tourists with future installments of the series.|$|E
5|$|Brother Justin Crowe is the {{antagonist}} in Carnivàle; reviewers {{also saw}} {{in him a}} possible alternate protagonist. Brother Justin is introduced as a Methodist minister who resides with his sister <b>Iris</b> <b>in</b> {{the small town of}} Mintern, California. As the series reveals in later episodes, Justin's birth name is Alexei Belyakov. He and his sister Iris are orphaned immigrant children in the wilderness, who were found and raised by Reverend Norman Balthus. Following strange visions and supernatural abilities in the pilot episode, Brother Justin erects a church in his God's name. But after a fire in his new ministry leads him almost to suicide, Brother Justin is hospitalized in a sanatarium and discovers his ability to manipulate and control those around him through sheer force of will. Shortly after Brother Justin's return to Mintern, Norman suspects his foster son to be possessed by a demon and confronts him, but Brother Justin is not disturbed by his true nature for long. In the beginning of season 2, Brother Justin has begun to gather a huge flock of worshippers of mostly migrants and Okies outside Mintern via his nightly radio sermons and newfound abilities of persuasion. A scholar named Wilfred Talbot Smith identifies him as the Usher and tells him that, in order to gain his full measure of power and fulfill his destiny, he must find and kill a man named Henry Scudder. While escaped convict Varlyn Stroud helps Brother Justin, the Crowes find a new chambermaid in ex-carny Sofie, not knowing that she is Brother Justin's daughter. Brother Justin at long last meets his adversary, Ben, in the final episode of the series. Brother Justin is killed in a battle in a cornfield near his home, but Sofie as the Omega arrives and places her hands on his chest, causing the corn stalks around them to wither and fall away.|$|E
25|$|Sega was {{introduced}} to <b>Iris</b> <b>in</b> 2001. He started working on several test tracks with Reagan Jones before becoming an official member in 2002.|$|E
50|$|In 1956, a cytological (cell) {{study was}} carried out on various <b>irises</b> <b>in</b> the Californicae Section. Including Iris tenuis.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes it is {{confused}} with <b>Iris</b> leptophylla (<b>in</b> <b>Iris</b> subg. Scorpiris).|$|R
50|$|Often called 'junos', {{this type}} of iris {{is one of the}} more popular bulb <b>irises</b> <b>in</b> cultivation. They are {{generally}} earliest to bloom.|$|R
25|$|It {{has several}} common names, including; roof iris, Japanese roof iris, wall <b>iris</b> (<b>in</b> America), wall flag, white root iris, Ichihatu (In Japan – meaning first {{as the first}} iris to flower), shenan, and roof garden iris.|$|E
25|$|Internationally, {{the show}} airs on MBC Action in the Arab World, TRT 1 and Star in Turkey, <b>Iris</b> <b>in</b> Italy, Viasat TV6 in Sweden, Viasat 3+ in Denmark, TV7 in Bulgaria, TV3 in Estonia, ARD in Germany, and Nine Network in Australia.|$|E
25|$|Iris {{was named}} after the rainbow goddess <b>Iris</b> <b>in</b> Greek mythology, who was a {{messenger}} to the gods, especially Hera. Her quality of attendant of Hera was particularly appropriate to the circumstances of discovery, as Iris was spotted following 3 Juno by {{less than an hour}} of right ascension (Juno is the Roman equivalent of Hera).|$|E
50|$|Irilone is an isoflavone, {{a type of}} flavonoid. It can {{be found}} in Trifolium pratense (red clover), <b>in</b> <b>Iris</b> unguicularis and <b>in</b> <b>Iris</b> germanica.|$|R
50|$|The {{habitat of}} the <b>iris</b> was {{described}} <b>in</b> full by Peter Werckmeister <b>in</b> the <b>Iris</b> Yearbook (<b>in</b> 1957).|$|R
50|$|A {{study was}} carried out in 2013, to find out what oils are {{contained}} in the rhizomes of various <b>irises</b> <b>in</b> Syria, including <b>Iris</b> germanica, Iris barnumiae, I. bostrensis and <b>in</b> <b>Iris</b> auranitica.

25|$|The artist Philip Hermogenes Calderon painted an <b>iris</b> <b>in</b> his 1856 work Broken Vows; he {{followed}} {{the principles of the}} Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. An ancient belief is that the iris serves as a warning to be heeded, as it was named for the messenger of Olympus. It also conveys images of lost love and silent grief, for young girls were led into the afterlife by Iris. Broken Vows was accompanied with poetry by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow when it was first exhibited.|$|E
25|$|The black-necked stork (Ephippiorhynchus asiaticus) {{is a tall}} long-necked {{wading bird}} in the stork family. It is a {{resident}} species across the Indian Subcontinent and Southeast Asia with a disjunct population in Australia. It lives in wetland habitats and certain crops such as rice and wheat where it forages {{for a wide range}} of animal prey. Adult birds of both sexes have a heavy bill and are patterned in white and glossy blacks, but the sexes differ in the colour of the <b>iris.</b> <b>In</b> Australia, it is sometimes called a jabiru although that name refers to a stork species found in the Americas. It is one of the few storks that is strongly territorial when feeding.|$|E
25|$|Nd:YAG laser {{peripheral}} iridotomy (LPI) {{may be used}} {{in patients}} susceptible to or affected by angle closure glaucoma or pigment dispersion syndrome. During laser iridotomy, laser energy is used to make a small, full-thickness opening in the iris to equalize the pressure between the front and back of the iris, thus correcting any abnormal bulging of the <b>iris.</b> <b>In</b> people with narrow angles, this can uncover the trabecular meshwork. In some cases of intermittent or short-term angle closure, this may lower the eye pressure. Laser iridotomy reduces the risk of developing an attack of acute angle closure. In most cases, it also reduces the risk of developing chronic angle closure or of adhesions of the iris to the trabecular meshwork.|$|E
50|$|The {{flower bud}} leans {{slightly}} before flowering <b>in</b> <b>Iris</b> aphylla subsp. hungarica {{as compared to}} <b>Iris</b> aphylla, <b>in</b> which the stem is straight.|$|R
50|$|It {{flowers in}} early spring, {{normally}} February.It grows to about 10 cm tall, with a 5-6 cm tall flower.The bulbs are more pointed and slender in shape than other reticulata <b>irises</b> <b>in</b> the genus.|$|R
50|$|In 1961, a {{study was}} carried out on various <b>irises</b> <b>in</b> USSR, {{including}} <b>Iris</b> furcata.The karyotype of Iris furcata is distinct from that of Iris aphylla, it may be better considered an ancestral form.|$|R
25|$|Promoted to captain on 13 March 1873, Seymour {{spent a year}} at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich {{and then}} became {{commanding}} officer of the troopship HMS Orontes. He went on to be commanding officer of the cruiser HMS <b>Iris</b> <b>in</b> the Mediterranean Fleet in April 1880 and commanding officer of the battleship HMS Inflexible in the Mediterranean Fleet in November 1882. He briefly commanded the converted liner SS Oregon when Russian forces seized Afghan territory in March 1885 during the Panjdeh Incident. He went on to be flag captain to the Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth in May 1886 and, having been appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 21 June 1887, he became assistant to the Admiral Superintendent of Naval Reserves in December 1887.|$|E
25|$|Promoted to captain on 10 January 1837, {{he became}} {{commanding}} officer of the sixth-rate HMS <b>Iris</b> <b>in</b> the West Africa Squadron in October 1842. He was then re-deployed with HMS Iris to the East Indies Station and was involved in operations under Admiral Sir Thomas Cochrane. Mundy was asked to keep the Sultan of Brunei in line until the British Government made a final {{decision on whether to}} take the island of Labuan: he took the Sultan's son-in-law, Pengiran Mumin, to witness the island's accession to the British Crown on 24 December 1846. Some sources state that during the signing of the treaty, the Sultan had been threatened by a British navy warship ready to fire on the Sultan's palace if he refused to sign the treaty while another source says the island was ceded to Britain as a reward for assistance in combating pirates.|$|E
500|$|The biopic Iris (2001) {{featured}} Winslet and Judi Dench as {{the novelist}} Iris Murdoch at different ages. The director Richard Eyre cast the two actresses after finding a [...] "correspondence of spirit between them". Winslet {{was drawn to}} the idea of playing an intellectual and zesty female lead, and in research, she read Murdoch's novels, studied her husband's memoir Elegy for Iris, and watched televised interviews of Murdoch. The project was filmed over four weeks and allowed Winslet to bring her daughter, who was six months old at the time, on set. Writing for The Guardian, the novelist Martin Amis commented that [...] "the seriousness and steadiness of [...] gaze effectively suggest the dawning amplitude of the Murdoch imagination". Winslet received her third Oscar nomination for <b>Iris,</b> <b>in</b> addition to BAFTA and Golden Globe nominations for Best Supporting Actress.|$|E
50|$|Yeld also {{produced}} some well-known <b>irises.</b> <b>In</b> 1923 {{he became the}} first President of the Iris Society, now the British <b>Iris</b> Society, founded <b>in</b> 1922. He was a friend of another iris breeder, Sir Michael Foster, naming one of his plants 'Sir Michael'. This iris, and another called 'Lord of June', were famous for some time.|$|R
25|$|In 2013, a Molecular phylogenetic (genetic evolution) {{study was}} carried out on 16 species of <b>Iris</b> found <b>in</b> Korea. It placed <b>Iris</b> mandshurica <b>in</b> a clade with other basal irises, {{including}} Iris dichotoma and Iris tectorum.|$|R
50|$|Olga {{described}} 3 Juno <b>irises,</b> <b>Iris</b> baldshuanica (<b>in</b> Russk. Bot. Zhurn. 5: 77. 1909,),Iris degerensis (now classed as {{a synonym}} of Iris narbutii) and <b>Iris</b> narynensis (<b>in</b> Bulletin of the Jardin of St Peterburg's Botanic Garden 159 in 1905,).|$|R
500|$|The filmed pilot episode {{served as}} basis for {{additional}} tweaking of intended story lines. The expanded role of Brother Justin encouraged {{the creation of}} his sister <b>Iris</b> <b>in</b> a supporting role, for which Amy Madigan was cast. Little was changed on Ben Hawkins' side except for {{the addition of the}} cootch (striptease) Dreifuss family; a Carnivàle consultant had elated the producers by calling attention to his research about families managing cootch shows in the 1930s. Cynthia Ettinger (Rita Sue Dreifuss) had lost her role as Martha Kent in the pilot episode of Smallville before the opportunity for Carnivàle came up and had turned to theater jobs; she chose Carnivàle because of the theater-like experience. Amanda Aday (Dora Mae Dreifuss) knew she would join the cast for only a few episodes, but was not told the story reasons at that point. The writers prolonged the character arcs of recurring John Carroll Lynch (Stroud) and K Callan (Eleanor) considerably beyond their original intention. Similarly, Robert Knepper's role as Tommy Dolan was extended from a few episodes to half of both seasons because the writers had liked his performance as an [...] "ambitious man [...] Brother Justin to further his career." ...|$|E
2500|$|Plimpton {{appeared}} in the Robert De Niro 1990 film Stanley & <b>Iris</b> <b>in</b> a supporting role. She also {{appeared in}} the 1991 TV movie A Woman At War as the lead, [...] "Helene Moskiewicz", alongside Eric Stoltz.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{there may}} be another meaning to Ozu's title derived from ancient Japanese culture. When Noriko and Shukichi attend the Noh play, the work {{performed}} is called Kakitsubata or [...] "The Water Iris." [...] (The water <b>iris</b> <b>in</b> Japan is a plant which blooms, usually in marshland or other moist soil, in mid-to-late-spring.) In this play, a traveling monk arrives {{at a place called}} Yatsuhashi, famous for its water irises, when a woman appears. She alludes to a famous poem by the waka poet of the Heian period, Ariwara no Narihira, in which each of the five lines begins with one syllable that, spoken together, spell out the word for [...] "water iris" [...] ("ka-ki-tsu-ba-ta"). The monk stays the night at the humble hut of the woman, who then appears in an elaborate kimono and headdress and reveals herself to be the spirit of the water iris. She praises Narihira, dances and at dawn receives enlightenment from the Buddha and disappears.|$|E
50|$|One {{reference}} (Flora of S.S.S.R.) mentions wet {{meadows and}} stream sides, also mentioned by the British Iris Society Guide, but herbarium specimens {{do not support}} this habitat, also the other <b>irises</b> <b>in</b> the Regelia section are also mountainside irises.|$|R
50|$|In 1980, Zhao {{originally}} placed {{this species}} among the crested <b>irises</b> <b>in</b> the Lophiris section, but Brian Mathew and Henry J. Noltie included it with Iris subg. Nepalensis, {{as it is}} very similar to Iris decora. Due to the <b>iris</b> being found <b>in</b> China, it {{is more likely to be}} a Lophiris crested iris, but a molecular study has supported a position within Iris subg. Nepalensis.|$|R
50|$|In 2015, a {{study was}} carried out on 8 species of <b>iris</b> found <b>in</b> Iran {{including}} <b>Iris</b> reticulata, Iris pseudocaucasica, Iris persica, Iris acutiloba and Iris meda. It found that the petals contain anthocyanins, (which are common floral pigments that form blue, purple and red colours). High concentration of Cartenoids have also been found <b>in</b> the <b>iris</b> flowers. Compared to 8 other <b>irises</b> <b>in</b> Iran, it had the highest accumulation of anthocyanin and cartenoids in the petals.|$|R
