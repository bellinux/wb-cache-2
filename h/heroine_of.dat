5|$|To help {{publicize}} the production, Ince {{reported to the}} newspapers that lead-actress Tsuru Aoki {{was a native of}} the island of Sakura and she had lost all her relatives in the eruption—she was actually from Obara Tsuru city, Kyushu, 180 miles north of Sakura-Jima. Ince also embroidered her biography so that she would appeal to the middle-class audiences as the <b>heroine</b> <b>of</b> a melodrama, claiming that she was the daughter of an illustrious Japanese artist. The biographical-type publicity added emotional and psychological authenticity to the character that Aoki played in the film.|$|E

She does not communicate well with others due to her poor social skills and {{can be seen as}} inarticulate. Due to this, she is shy, and is usually seen alone. Rin loves cats and at school takes care of several strays. Riki's roommate and fellow member of the Little Busters is Masato Inohara who loves to work out and improve his muscle mass. He has a particular fondness for Riki, which he is more than willing to express out aloud.

Following Minna's death Cosima wrote to Hans von Bülow on a number of {{occasions}} asking him to grant her a divorce, but Bülow refused to concede this.

The divorce was finally sanctioned, after delays in the legal process, by a Berlin court on 18 July 1870. Richard and Cosima's wedding took place on 25 August 1870.

5|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on February 21, 1911. The film was originally set to be released under the title The Patriot Maid of '76. The reason for the title change {{was due to the}} release by the Rex Motion Picture Company's A <b>Heroine</b> <b>of</b> '76 on February 16, 1911. Though the film bears similarity in title and character, the plots were entirely different. Rex's film was also the first release by the new company. For the release of this patriotic film, Thanhouser made additional efforts for promoting the film in trade publications. A film still was used as the cover illustration on the February 11, 1911 issue of The Moving Picture News and a full-page still would be included in the The Moving Picture Worlds February 11 issue.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most earlier Spanish art, Goya's {{rejects the}} ideals of heroic dignity. He refuses to focus on {{individual}} participants; though he drew from many classic art sources, his works pointedly portray the protagonists as anonymous casualties, rather than known patriots. The exception is , Que valor! (What courage!), which depicts Agustina de Aragón (1786–1857), the <b>heroine</b> <b>of</b> Zaragoza, who brought food to the cannoneers at the city defensive walls during the siege in which 54,000 Spaniards died. When all the cannoneers had been killed, Agustina manned and fired the cannons herself. Although it is agreed that Goya could not have witnessed this incident, Robert Hughes believes {{it may have been}} his visit to Zaragoza in the lull {{between the first and second}} phases of the siege that inspired him to produce the series.|$|E
5|$|A popular lakon named Irawan Rabi ("Irawan's wedding") {{tells about}} {{the love of}} Irawan and Titisari, a {{daughter}} of Kresna (Krishna). While Titisari is engaged to Irawan, Baladewa (Baladeva), Kresna's brother and an ally of the Kurawas (Kauravas), wants her to marry Lesmana Mandrakumara, the son of Durjudana (Duryodhana), initiating a dramatic conflict. The conflict that ensues ends up being three-sided, among the Pandawas, Kurawas and the ogre-kingdom, whose evil ogre-king Barandjana plans to kidnap Titisari. The confusion that follows results in the outwitting and humiliation of the Kurawas. Siti Sendari, the eldest daughter of Kresna and the estranged wife of Abhimanju, {{takes advantage of the}} situation and schemes to bring Irawan and Titisari together, while also mending her relationships with her husband. Though officially Irawan and Titisari are the hero and <b>heroine</b> <b>of</b> the lakon, in reality they are mere spectators, not the movers, in the play. Brandon describes Irawan as a minor character. Irawan is also depicted as unassertive and manipulated by others, which is common in South Asian theatre. Another lakon called Serat Lampahan Pregiwa Pregiwati also relates a tale about the love of Irawan and Titisari.|$|E

5|$|Kazamatsuri is {{the setting}} for a secret war being waged by two main groups: Gaia and Guardian. Gaia, an {{organization}} {{under the auspices of}} the environmental conservation group Martel, is populated by nihilistic and misanthropic people able to contract with familiars, which manifest as constructs fueled by the summoner's life force. Martel itself used to be a church and contains within it a holy maiden group of girls with developmental disabilities. Guardian is dedicated to the destruction of familiars and is composed almost entirely of humans who possess special powers. Gaia and Guardian came to Kazamatsuri in the pursuit of the Earth's familiar named Kagari, who manifests as a young, high school age-looking girl. Kagari, the main <b>heroine</b> <b>of</b> Rewrite, has the power to initiate a period of re-evolution, which restarts the process of evolving another means of intelligent life. However, this is done with the use of the Earth's energy, and by the time the events of Rewrite occur, there is no more energy left to do another re-evolution. Gaia wants to capture Kagari to ensure the destruction of humanity, but Guardian wishes to seek out Kagari to kill her, ensuring that human life continues.|$|E
5|$|Rachel is {{the leading}} female character, and tragic <b>heroine</b> <b>of</b> the game. She and her twin sister, Alma, are afflicted with a blood curse that turns humans into fiends. Believing {{that there is no}} cure for their condition, Rachel seeks to kill Alma to redeem her sister's soul. The {{relationship}} between the sisters and the Greater Fiend Doku, who cursed them, serves as a plot device to drive the game forward, with Rachel occasionally needing to be rescued by Ryu. Although not a player-controlled character in Ninja Gaiden, in a few sections of the Ninja Gaiden Sigma remake she is controllable. Two other characters assist the player in the game. Ayane, a young female ninja and one of the DOA regular cast members, acts as a guide throughout Ninja Gaiden by supplying advice and objectives to the player. Muramasa, a bladesmith, has shops scattered throughout the game world where players can purchase useful items and upgrades for Ryu's weapons. Muramasa also gives quests and relates back-stories and other crucial information; for example, he tells Ryu how he can obtain the item required to upgrade his Dragon Sword to its full potential. Players have the option to customize the appearance of player characters, with selectable costumes for Ryu and hairstyles for Rachel.|$|E

5|$|When Rama {{abandons}} {{the young}} Maya Sita at Agni Pariksha, she – {{worried about her}} uncertain future – questions Rama and Agni about what should she do now. They advise {{her to go to}} Pushkar and perform austerities (Tapas) and prophesy that she will be become Svargalakshmi ("Lakshmi of the heaven") as the result of her asceticism. Shiva is pleased with her penance and promises to grant her desired boon. Maya Sita, who is transformed into Svargalakshmi by practising austerities for three lakh years, anxiously repeats five times that she get a husband. Shiva blesses her that she will be born as Draupadi, the princess of Pancala, who will have five husbands. Draupadi, the <b>heroine</b> <b>of</b> the Mahabharata, is born out of the flames of a yajna (fire sacrifice) of Drupada (King of Panchala) and later becomes the common wife of the five Pandava brothers, princes of Kuru kingdom. The text also declares that in previous birth, Maya Sita was Vedavati, a woman Ravana tries to rape and who curses Ravana that she will be the cause of his ruin. Since she has taken birth in three yugas (ages; a cycle of four ages is believed to repeat) – Vedavati in Satya yuga, Maya Sita in Treta Yuga and Draupadi in Dwapara yuga, she is known as Trihayani, the one who appears in the three ages.|$|E
