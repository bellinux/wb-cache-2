30|$|The {{essence of}} hot deck {{imputation}} is that missing {{data in a}} recipient file (TALIS) are filled in with actual values from a <b>donor</b> <b>data</b> file (PISA) based on a pre‐specified algorithm. This approach requires that the <b>donor</b> <b>data</b> set {{be at least as}} large or larger than the recipient data set. Once a PISA donor is found for a TALIS recipient, the missing data for the TALIS recipient is given the value of the PISA donor. The resulting synthetic data set has a sample size equivalent to that of the original TALIS sample. A number of algorithms exist for hot deck matching, however for this paper we will focus our attention only on nearest neighbor hot deck matching. For our analyses, will use the R program StatMatch (D’Orazio 2011) for non‐parametric hot deck matching.|$|E

40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarUnder certain {{conditions}} blood <b>donor</b> <b>data</b> {{could be one}} of the sources of information on the spread of HIV in the general population in the Netherlands (Gezondheidsraad, 1989). The conditions under which such investigations should be undertaken are the subject of this study. In preparation of future behavioral studies amongst the donor population and the general population a survey was carried out, in the region of the Red Cross Blood Bank Groningen-Drenthe NL, on blood <b>donor</b> <b>data</b> over the period ' 83 -' 89. This report includes a description of all subjects who ceased to be donor in the period ' 83 -' 89, their demographic characteristics (age, gender, city of residence), and the reasons given for quitting the blood donor pool. We conclude that routinely collected Blood Bank data provide detailed information on the annual resignations and deferrals among blood donors, and on the demographic characteristics of this group. These data can serve as a basis for planning behavioral studies in both populations. In addition there are possibilities to analyze the differences between 'active' donors and donors who withdrew, because the data required for such analyses had to be collected for the present study. Given the proportion of resignations because of a risk factor (1, 5 % of all resignations) and with 'unknown' risk factor (70 % of all resignations) no firm conclusions can be drawn on the issue whether the donor population is selected on (low) risk behaviour for HIV. The quality of routinely collected blood <b>donor</b> <b>data</b> must be improved by prospective registration of (reasons for) resignations and the adaption of uniform procedures across the country...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Like other countries, Canada's {{population}} is aging, {{and the implications}} of this demographic change need to be better understood from the perspective of blood supply. Analysis of <b>donor</b> <b>data</b> will help to identify systematic patterns of donation and its correlates. Data Geo-coded blood donor and donor clinic data are provided by Canadian Blood Services. Blood <b>donor</b> <b>data</b> is provided for the fiscal year 2006 - 2007 indicating the total number of donors for each Canadian postal code, excluding the province of Québec. Potential correlates of blood donation are selected based on social and economic characteristics, as well as descriptors of city size and geographical location in the urban hierarchy measures of accessibility, and capacity of donor clinics. Methods Data is aggregated to n = 3, 746 census tracts in 40 Census Metropolitan Areas (CMA) across the country. The number of donors per population in a census tract is regressed against the set of potential donation correlates. Autocorrelation is tested for and results adjusted to provide parsimonious models. Results A number of factors are found to influence donation across the country, including the proportion of younger residents, English ability, proportion of people with immigrant status, higher education, and a population-based measure of accessibility. Conclusion While a number of correlates of blood donation are observed across Canada, important contextual effects across metropolitan areas are highlighted. The paper concludes by looking at policy options that are aimed toward further understanding donor behaviour. </p...|$|E

ECFV is held within narrow limits in healthy subjects, narrower than GFR, and should therefore have a low CV. METHODS Fifteen departments participated in this retrospective study of healthy renal transplant <b>donors.</b> <b>Data</b> were analysed separately for men (n ranged from 28 to 115 per centre; total = 819) and women (n = 28 - 146; 1, 059). All centres used the slope-intercept method with blood sample numbers ranging from two to five. Subjects did not fast prior to GFR measurement. GFR was scaled to body surface area (BSA) and corrected for the single compartment assumption. GFR scaled to ECFV was calculated as the terminal slope rate constant and corrected for the single compartment assumption. ECFV/BSA was calculated as the ratio of GFR/BSA to GFR/ECFV.

What sets this study apart from previous articles on this subject is the use of a disaggregated approach. While previous studies have almost exclusively focused on the total aid flow, this paper divides the total flow into six sub-groups according to the type of aid (budgetary support or sector specific) and to which sector it is dedicated. Using this approach enables us to see if donors make different considerations for different types of aid. Since a rational donor is likely to put different weight on certain factors depending on where the aid funds is going, this approach might be more suitable when evaluating the behavior of <b>donors.</b> <b>Data</b> for 125 recipient countries during 1995 - 2009 is put in panel data form and regressions are run for each of the six sub-groups respectively. The main finding is that there are in fact differences, between sub-groups, in  terms of what factors that influence donors; for example it seems like budgetary support is given mainly to less (relatively) developed country compared to sector specific aid. Hence this paper shows that aid allocation could preferably be studied on a disaggregated level...|$|R
