5|$|Mk. III {{went into}} {{extensive}} testing at No. 25 Sqn in May 1940 and another troubling problem was found. As the target aircraft {{moved to the}} sides of the fighter, the error in the <b>horizontal</b> <b>angle</b> grew. Eventually, at about 60 degrees to the side, the target was indicated as being {{on the other side of}} the fighter. Hanbury Brown concluded that the problem was due to reflections between the fuselage and engine nacelles, due to the change to the long-nose IVF from the short-nose IF and IIF. In previous examples they had used the fuselage of the aircraft as the reflector, positioning and angling the antennas to run along the nose or wing leading edges.|$|E
5|$|The {{back was}} also reconstructed {{in a more}} or less {{horizontal}} orientation by Borsuk-Białynicka, which was followed by most subsequent depictions. In a 2007 study, Daniela Schwarz and colleagues suggested that the back dipped towards the rear. According to these researchers, the shoulder blade would have been inclined at a <b>horizontal</b> <b>angle</b> of 55–65°, much steeper than previously thought, resulting in an elevated shoulder region. With the vertebral column of the trunk and neck held in a relatively straight line, this would result in an elevated position of the head.|$|E

25|$|Sound {{localization}} is {{the process}} of determining the location of a sound source. The brain utilizes subtle differences in loudness, tone and timing between the two ears to allow us to localize sound sources. Localization can be described in terms of three-dimensional position: the azimuth or <b>horizontal</b> <b>angle,</b> the zenith or vertical angle, and the distance (for static sounds) or velocity (for moving sounds). Humans, as most four-legged animals, are adept at detecting direction in the horizontal, but less so in the vertical due to the ears being placed symmetrically. Some species of owls have their ears placed asymmetrically, and can detect sound in all three planes, an adaption to hunt small mammals in the dark.|$|E
25|$|In the US, amber {{front and}} red rear {{side marker lamps}} and retroreflectors are required. The law {{initially}} required lights or retroreflectors on vehicles made after 1 January 1968. This was amended to require lights and retroreflectors on vehicles made after 1 January 1970. These side-facing devices make the vehicle's presence, position and direction of travel clearly visible from oblique angles. The lights are wired so as to illuminate whenever the vehicles' parking and taillamps are on, including when the headlamps are being used. Front amber side markers in the United States may be wired so as to flash in synchronous phase or opposite-phase with the turn signals, but {{are not required to}} flash at all. Side markers are permitted but not required on cars and light passenger vehicles outside the US and Canada. If installed, they are required to be brighter and visible through a larger <b>horizontal</b> <b>angle</b> than US side markers, may flash only in synchronous phase with the turn signals (but are not required to flash), and they must be amber at the front and rear, except rear side markers may be red if they are grouped, combined, or reciprocally incorporated with another rear lighting function that is required to be red.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{versions of}} the Bristol Scout to see aerial combat duty in 1915, the Scout C, had Lewis gun mounts in RNAS service that sometimes were elevated above the propeller arc, and sometimes (in an apparently reckless manner) firing directly through the propeller arc without synchronisation. During {{the spring and summer}} of 1915, Captain Lanoe Hawker of the Royal Flying Corps, however, had mounted his Lewis gun just forward of the cockpit to fire forwards and outwards, on the left side of his aircraft's fuselage at about a 30° <b>horizontal</b> <b>angle.</b> [...] On 25 July 1915 Captain Hawker flew his Scout C, bearing RFC serial number 1611 against several two-seat German observation aircraft of the Fliegertruppe, and managed to defeat three of them in aerial engagements to earn the first Victoria Cross awarded to a British fighter pilot, while engaged against enemy fixed-wing aircraft.|$|E

40|$|The {{accuracy}} and precision of two key field measurements used to produce estimates of marine mammal abundance from shipboard surveys – the <b>horizontal</b> <b>angles</b> from the ship's trackline and the radial distances to the animals in the water – were assessed. Measurements were made from two ships, the McArthur and the David Starr Jordan, under field conditions. <b>Horizontal</b> <b>angles</b> were measured using angle rings and radial distances were measured with reticles in 25 X binoculars. Distances to targets were measured simultaneously using radar and reticles. Rounding of <b>horizontal</b> <b>angles</b> in field survey data to 5 degree increments, and of reticle values to both 0. 2 and 0. 5 reticle increments, was indicated by autocorrelation tests. The rounding was eliminated by "smearing " the original <b>horizontal</b> <b>angles</b> over ± 2 degrees and the original reticles over ± 0. 05 reticles. Replicated measurements of angles in the radar database indicated 95 % of angle measurements to a single target {{were expected to be}} within ± 3 degrees of one another. The precision of radial distances measured using reticles was inversely proportional to target distance. The radial distances calculated using the formula proposed by Lerczak and Hobbs (1998) were a closer fit to distances from radar than alternative formulas, but exhibited a slight tendency to underestimate distances to targets close to the horizon under field conditions. Adjusting reticle measurements for light refraction improved the fit to target distances by reducing this downward bias. A second adjustment corrected ship-specific responses to sea conditions at the time the reticles were used...|$|R

50|$|On small sailboats {{and some}} {{cruising}} sailboats a vang may be omitted. If a vang is not installed, then the sheet has {{to try to}} control both horizontal and vertical angles of the boom. When the boom is near the centerline, the sheet is nearly vertical, and can exert downward force on the boom. As the sheet is loosened to increase the <b>horizontal</b> <b>angle</b> of the boom and sail, the sheet becomes horizontal and exerts less downward force. A vang works with the sheet to apply the downward force on the boom at all horizontal angles, allowing the sheet {{to be used to}} control the <b>horizontal</b> <b>angle</b> of the boom effectively.|$|E

5000|$|There is some {{confusion}} about the instrument to which the name was originally applied. Some identify the early theodolite as an azimuth instrument only, while others specify it as an altazimuth instrument. In Digges's book, the name [...] "theodolite" [...] described an instrument for measuring <b>horizontal</b> <b>angles</b> only. He also described an instrument that measured both altitude and azimuth, which he called a topographicall instrument [...] Thus the name originally applied only to the azimuth instrument and only later became associated with the altazimuth instrument. The 1728 Cyclopaedia compares [...] "graphometer" [...] to [...] "half-theodolite". Even {{as late as the}} 19th century, the instrument for measuring <b>horizontal</b> <b>angles</b> only was called a simple theodolite and the altazimuth instrument, the plain theodolite.|$|R

50|$|The {{combination}} of the antennae in this way resulted in a concentration of the radiated energy to a smaller beam, thus resulting in a higher radiated power in the main direction (Effective Radiated Power = ERP), without increasing the transmitter power. The result was a longer range. With the L-version the <b>horizontal</b> opening <b>angle</b> of the antenna array remained the same, but the vertical opening angle was reduced (so flatter radiation pattern). Because the <b>horizontal</b> opening <b>angle</b> was not changed, the bearing measuring performance was not changed.

50|$|Historically, <b>horizontal</b> <b>angles</b> were {{measured}} {{by using a}} compass to provide a magnetic bearing or azimuth. Later, more precise scribed discs improved angular resolution.
