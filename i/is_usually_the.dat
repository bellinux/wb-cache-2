5|$|Other {{species that}} are less {{commonly}} affected include cats and horses, {{as well as other}} large domestic animals. In cats, hypothyroidism <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> <b>the</b> result of other medical treatment such as surgery or radiation. In young horses, congenital hypothyroidism has been reported predominantly in Western Canada and has been linked with the mother's diet.|$|E

5|$|The {{choice between}} scuba and surface {{supplied}} diving equipment {{is based on}} both legal and logistical constraints.

Higher risk work, particularly commercial diving, may be restricted to surface supplied equipment by legislation and codes of practice.|$|E
5|$|The {{clarinet}} is {{prominent in}} Bulgarian wedding music also; {{it is an}} offshoot of Roma/Romani traditional music. Ivo Papazov is a well-known clarinetist in this genre.

5|$|The {{controlling}} compartment for {{the first}} stop <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> <b>the</b> fastest tissue, but this generally changes during the ascent, and slower tissues usually control the shallower stop times.

5|$|Ab initio phasing {{or direct}} methods – This <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> <b>the</b> method {{of choice for}} small {{molecules}} (<1000 non-hydrogen atoms), and has been used successfully to solve the phase problems for small proteins. If {{the resolution of the}} data is better than 1.4 Å (140 pm), direct methods can be used to obtain phase information, by exploiting known phase relationships between certain groups of reflections.|$|E
5|$|All other {{participating}} teams enter after Greece {{and before}} the host nation, in order according to a language selected by the organizing committee for those games, which <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> <b>the</b> dominant language {{in the area of}} the host city.

5|$|Another {{approach}} is possible, originally developed by Anatoliy Skorokhod and Andrei Kolmogorov, for a continuous-time stochastic process with any metric space as its state space. For {{the construction of}} such a stochastic process, {{it is assumed that}} the sample functions of the stochastic process belong to some suitable function space, which <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> <b>the</b> Skorokhod space consisting of all right-continuous functions with left limits. This {{approach is}} now more used than the separability assumption, but such a stochastic process based on this approach will be automatically separable.|$|E

5|$|Defining {{the top end}} of a clarinet's {{range is}} difficult, since many {{advanced}} players can produce notes well above the highest notes commonly found in method books. G6 <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> <b>the</b> highest note clarinetists encounter in classical repertoire. The C above that (C7 i.e. resting on the fifth ledger line above the treble staff) is attainable by advanced players and is shown on many fingering charts, and fingerings as high as A7 exist.|$|E
5|$|Each {{parliament}} {{lasts for}} {{a maximum of}} five years from the date of its first sitting, and once a parliament has been dissolved a general election must be held within three months. Following a general election, the President appoints as Prime Minister an MP who, in his judgment, is likely to command {{the confidence of the}} majority of the MPs. In practice, the Prime Minister <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> <b>the</b> leader of the political party holding the majority of the seats in Parliament. The President also appoints other Ministers from among the MPs, acting in accordance with the Prime Minister's advice.|$|E

5|$|In Albanian folklore, the dhampir is {{the hybrid}} {{child of the}} karkanxholl (a werewolf-like {{creature}} with an iron mail shirt) or the lugat (a water-dwelling ghost or monster). The dhampir sprung of a karkanxholl has the unique ability to discern the karkanxholl; from this derives the expression the dhampir knows the lugat. The lugat cannot be seen, he can only be killed by the dhampir, who himself <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> <b>the</b> son of a lugat. In different regions, animals can be revenants as lugats; also, living people during their sleep. Dhampiraj is also an Albanian surname.|$|E
5|$|Rapid {{diagnosis}} and treatment are important {{in the care of}} TBI; if the injury is not diagnosed shortly after the injury, the risk of complications is higher. Bronchoscopy is the most effective method to diagnose, locate, and determine the severity of TBI, and it <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> <b>the</b> only method that allows a definitive diagnosis. Diagnosis with a flexible bronchoscope, which allows the injury to be visualized directly, is the fastest and most reliable technique. In people with TBI, bronchoscopy may reveal that the airway is torn, or that the airways are blocked by blood, or that a bronchus has collapsed, obscuring more distal (lower) bronchi from view.|$|E

25|$|Medical {{treatments}} often {{focus on}} alleviating symptoms. However measures which focus on decreasing underlying atherosclerosis—as opposed to simply treating symptoms—are more effective.

If these methods do not work, medicines <b>are</b> <b>usually</b> <b>the</b> {{next step in}} treating cardiovascular diseases, and, with improvements, have increasingly become the most effective method over the long term.|$|R

5|$|Banksia prionotes {{was first}} {{described}} in 1840 by English botanist John Lindley, probably from material collected by James Drummond the previous year. There are no recognised varieties, {{although it has}} been known to hybridise with Banksia hookeriana. Widely distributed in south-west Western Australia, B.prionotes is found from Shark Bay (25° S) in the north, south as far as Kojonup (33°50′S). It grows exclusively in sandy soils, and <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> <b>the</b> dominant plant in scrubland or low woodland. Pollinated by birds, it provides food for a wide array of vertebrate and invertebrate animals in the autumn and winter months. It is an important source of food for honeyeaters (Meliphagidae), and is critical to their survival in the Avon Wheatbelt region, where it is the only nectar-producing plant in flower at some times of the year.|$|E
5|$|English cathedrals {{maintain}} a traditional form of church service, of which canticles, the set psalm of the day, responses, and an anthem are sung by a choir traditionally composed of about thirty men and boys. (Many cathedrals now {{also have a}} girls choir, and a lay choir). Because of this tradition, {{that part of the}} building that contains the stalls, usually to the east of the central tower but sometimes extending under it, is called the choir or quire. The choir is sometimes divided from the nave of the cathedral by a wide medieval screen constructed of stone and in some instances carrying a large pipe organ. This screen traditionally separated the quire from the nave and the clergy from the laity, who were expected to worship at parish churches, rather than at the cathedral. The nave of the cathedral, in medieval times, was used primarily for processions. At its western end it contains the font for the ritual washing service of Baptism, at which a person, most often an infant, is symbolically accepted into the church. The font is usually made of stone and <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> <b>the</b> oldest fitting in the cathedral, many of them being Norman.|$|E
5|$|Scuba diving {{fatalities}} have a {{major financial}} impact by way of lost income, lost business, insurance premium increases and high litigation costs. Equipment failure is rare in open circuit scuba, and when {{the cause of death}} is recorded as drowning, it <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> <b>the</b> consequence of an uncontrollable series of events in which drowning is the endpoint because it occurred in water, while the initial cause remains unknown. Air embolism is also frequently cited as a cause of death, often as a consequence of other factors leading to an uncontrolled and badly managed ascent, occasionally aggravated by medical conditions. About a quarter of diving fatalities are associated with cardiac events, mostly in older divers. There is a fairly large body of data on diving fatalities, but in many cases the data is poor due to the standard of investigation and reporting. This hinders research which could improve diver safety.|$|E
