40|$|Abstract—In {{recent years}} the waste water ministerial {{regulations}} {{have led to a}} constant ascend in the purification performance demanded of waste water treatment plants. Because of this, the number of waste water treatment plants has been maturing, and technical complexity has also been growing. In order to hold the connected rising costs of capital <b>expenditure</b> and <b>operation</b> within bounds, sagacious process technology solutions have to be found. Besides having {{a deeper understanding of the}} individual processes, it is indispensable to consider the entire waste water treatment plant as a whole. Most treatment plants consist of a mechanical and biological waste water purification, sludge treatment and gas utilization. In three of these four stages, namely in the preliminary and secondary clarification of the waste water and in the thickening and dewatering of the sludge, the processes for solids/liquids separation are of crucial importance. The efficiency of the solids/liquids separation is mainly influenced by the properties of the sludge...|$|R

A consequence of more isolated operations is the high demand for some form of energy to power their facilities.

Using documented and projected diesel and wind electrical generation capital <b>expenditures</b> and <b>operations</b> and maintenance (OandM) costs, technical data on operating efficiencies, and projected fuel costs, we can assess the potential profitability of wind power supplementation.

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} of this study has been to evaluate the technical and economical feasibility of the novel hybrid Zero Emission Gas power concept (ZEG), featuring production of electrical power from natural gas with integrated CO 2 capture, via a close integration of the Sorption Enhanced Steam Methane Reforming process (SE-SMR) with a high temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC). Technical design, process simulations and the preparation of detailed equipment lists {{have been carried out}} to calculate capital <b>expenditure</b> (CAPEX) and <b>operation</b> <b>expenditure</b> (OPEX) of the process. A cost analysis has been carried out for different price scenarios involving natural gas and electrical power prices, as well as CO 2 -quota cost and CO 2 sales value. The ZEG concept has been compared with a more conventional pre-combustion technology alternative as a reference case (REF), involving the coupling of auto-thermal reforming, water gas shift, amine CO 2 capture technology and a combined cycle. The results of this study show that the ZEG-case technology is likely to be profitable with relatively high net present values (NPV) in most of the price scenarios chosen, while the REF-case technology, using more conventional pre-combustion available technologies, shows negative NPV-values for all scenarios. Even with no income for the CO 2 captured and a quite moderate natural gas price of 19  EUR/MWh, the ZEG-case shows profitability for an electric power price of 50  EUR/MWh or higher. The promising and encouraging results of this study show the potential of the two technologies and of their close integration towards future zero emission power plants on a medium to long term perspective...|$|R
