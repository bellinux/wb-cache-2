5|$|At 5ft 4in (1.62m), Burnham was slight, but he {{was also}} muscular and bronzed, with a finely formed square jaw. He had a boyish {{appearance}} which he used to his advantage on numerous occasions. His most noticeable feature was his steady, grey-blue eyes. Contemporary reports had it that Burnham's gaze appeared to never leave those of the person <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at,</b> and yet somehow could simultaneously monitor all the details of the physical surroundings. It was also said that Burnham's eyes possessed a far-away look such as those acquired by people whose occupation has caused them to watch continually at sea or on great plains.|$|E

25|$|Galileo was {{considered}} the father of observational astronomy. He {{was among the first}} to use a telescope to observe the sky and after constructing a 20x refractor telescope he discovered the four largest moons of Jupiter in 1610. This was the first observation of satellites orbiting another planet. He also found that our Moon had craters and observed (and correctly explained) sunspots. Galileo noted that Venus exhibited a full set of phases resembling lunar phases. Galileo argued that these observations supported the Copernican system and were, to some extent, incompatible with the favored model of the Earth at the center of the universe. He may have even observed the planet Neptune in 1612 and 1613, over 200 years before it was discovered, but it is unclear if he was aware of what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at.</b>|$|E

500|$|During the {{flashing}} scene, Carell told Flannery that he [...] "wasn't staring at" [...] her breasts, rather, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> her clavicle. Despite what it appears on camera, Flannery {{was not completely}} topless, as she was wearing pasties. The scene was shot several times; Flannery admitted that the shooting was excruiating {{and it felt like}} they had been shooting the one scene for [...] "14 hours". To preserve Flannery's modesty, the series' monitors were shut off and the memory card for the digital camera was removed. Carell actually took pictures during the Christmas party shoot. All of the photos were released online.|$|E
500|$|Youth {{development}} and scouring for talent abroad {{is central to}} Wenger's recruitment policy. He relies on a network of scouts and personal contacts to find and attract talented footballers to play under him. Wenger's strategy is aided by data; for instance, the decision to sign Flamini in 2004 came about as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> statistics to find an understudy to Vieira. To examine the mental state of a young footballer, he uses psychometric tests conducted by psychologist Jacques Crevoisier once every two years. Wenger prides himself on nurturing talent, saying in an interview: [...] "I believe {{one of the best}} things about managing people is that we can influence lives in a positive way. That's basically what a manager is about. When I can do that, I am very happy".|$|E
500|$|After {{not being}} able to find a baby-sitter for Amy, Reagan {{suggests}} that the two throw a game night, an idea Chris doesn't react well to. They invite Ava, Kevin, Missy, but Chris attempts to hide the games due to Reagan's competitive nature. He tries to make her promise that she won't be too competitive, but she does which makes the party awkward. While playing Rock Band the two get in a fight when Chris loses the beat on the drums because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> his [...] "drumming arm". Reagan decide to a make a list of [...] "Things We Are Going to Stop Doing That Embarrass Each Other in 2012", which features annoying habits that the two want each other to give up. However, before 2011 comes to an end the two erase every thing from the list except for Chris's Borat impression and Reagen's competitive nature.|$|E

500|$|The {{day after}} the game, Vézina was {{diagnosed}} with tuberculosis and advised to return home. He made a last trip into the Canadiens' dressing room on [...] to say a final goodbye to his teammates. Dandurand would later describe Vézina as sitting in his corner of the dressing room with [...] "tears rolling down his cheeks. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> his old pads and skates that Eddie Dufour [...] had arranged in Georges' corner. Then, he asked one little favour—the sweater he had worn in the last world series." [...] Vézina returned to his hometown of Chicoutimi with his wife Marie, where {{he died in the}} early hours on Saturday, March 27, 1926, at l'Hôtel-Dieu hospital. Though he played only one period for the Canadiens during the entire season, the team honoured his entire $6,000 salary, a testament to how important Vézina had been to the team.|$|E
500|$|In , Jason Thompson {{referred}} to Monkey Punch's original manga as [...] "a crazy, groovy 1960s world of dynamite and backstabbing, hippies and gangsters", and considered it [...] "a fascinating homage to Mad magazine and a four star example of comics as pure comedy." [...] He rated the series {{four out of}} four stars. Allen Divers of Anime News Network (ANN) praised the strong writing and action; however, {{he felt that the}} art was too primitive. Otaku USAs Daryl Surat was also put off by the art, saying he couldn't tell most character apart and had a hard time figuring out what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at.</b> In The Rough Guide to Manga, Jason S. Yadao highlighted the example of how Lupin wearing a hat looks exactly like Zenigata. However, he considered it a successful plot device in once chapter that while it may take several attempts to understand, eventually pays off. He included the series in his list of 50 essential manga. Many of the first volumes of the English edition of the Lupin III manga released by Tokyopop made it onto ICv2's list of top 50 graphic novels, as well as later volumes from the series.|$|E

Then he would relate what he had seen or what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at.</b> Then Sidney replied, 'I see the same.' Presently Sidney would say 'what do I see?' and would repeat what he had seen or was seeing, and Joseph would reply, 'I see the same.' This manner of conversation was repeated at short intervals {{to the end of the}} vision".|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "surgeon's photograph" [...] is {{reportedly}} the first {{photo of the}} creature's head and neck. Supposedly taken by Robert Kenneth Wilson, a London gynaecologist, {{it was published in}} the Daily Mail on 21 April 1934. Wilson's refusal to have his name associated with it led to it being known as the [...] "surgeon's photograph". According to Wilson, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the loch when he saw the monster, grabbed his camera and snapped four photos. Only two exposures came out clearly; the first reportedly shows a small head and back, and the second shows a similar head in a diving position. The first photo became well-known, and the second attracted little publicity because of its blurriness.|$|E
2500|$|Raymond Rogers [...] {{argued in}} the {{scientific}} journal Thermochimica Acta {{that the presence of}} vanillin differed markedly between the unprovenanced threads <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at,</b> which contained 37% of the original vanillin, while the body of the shroud contained 0% of the original vanillin. He stated that: [...] "The fact that vanillin cannot be detected in the lignin on shroud fibers, Dead Sea scrolls linen, and other very old linens indicate that the shroud is quite old. A determination of the kinetics of vanillin loss suggest the shroud is between 1300 and 3000 years old. Even allowing for errors in the measurements and assumptions about storage conditions, the cloth is unlikely to be as young as 840 years".|$|E
2500|$|On the {{publication}} of Darwin's theory, in On The Origin of Species, he sent a complimentary copy to Owen, saying [...] "it will seem 'an abomination'". Owen {{was the first to}} respond, courteously claiming that he had long believed that [...] "existing influences" [...] were responsible for the [...] "ordained" [...] birth of species. Darwin now had long talks with him and Owen said that the book offered the best explanation [...] "ever published of the manner of formation of species", although he still had the gravest doubts that transmutation would bestialize man. It appears that Darwin had assured Owen that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> everything as resulting from designed laws, which Owen interpreted as showing a shared belief in [...] "Creative Power".|$|E

2500|$|He won the 1958 Academy Award for Best Actor for {{his role}} as Major Pollock in Separate Tables, his only {{nomination}} for an Oscar. Appearing on-screen for only 23 minutes in the film, this was the briefest performance ever to win a Best Actor Oscar, until Anthony Hopkins win for his appearance in the 1991 film The Silence of the Lambs, which is a little over 16 minutes. He was also a co-host of the 30th, 31st, and 46th Academy Awards ceremonies. After Niven had won the Academy Award, Goldwyn called with an invitation to his home. In Goldwyn's drawing room, Niven noticed a picture of himself in uniform which he had sent to Goldwyn from Britain during the Second World War. In happier times with Goldwyn, he had observed this same picture sitting on Goldwyn's piano. Now years later, the picture was still in exactly the same spot.

Darwin now had long talks with him, and told Lyell that [...] "Under garb of great civility, he was inclined to be most bitter & sneering against me. Yet I infer from several expressions, that at bottom he goes immense way with us." [...] Owen was furious at being included among those defending immutability of species, and in effect said that the book offered the best explanation [...] "ever published of the manner of formation of species", though he did not agree with it in all respects.

2500|$|She {{returned}} to North Dakota for a tonsillectomy and was noticed by hotel owner Frank Bering {{while working at}} the Doll House in Palm Springs, California. It was here that she developed her trademark sultry purr – having decided {{to compete with the}} noisy crowd with subtlety rather than volume. Beringin offered her a gig at The Buttery Room, a nightclub in the Ambassador Hotel East in Chicago. There, she was noticed by bandleader Benny Goodman. According to Lee, [...] "Benny's then-fiancée, Lady Alice Duckworth, came into The Buttery, and she was very impressed. So the next evening she brought Benny in, because {{they were looking for a}} replacement for Helen Forrest. And although I didn't know, I was it. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> me strangely, I thought, but it was just his preoccupied way of looking. I thought that he didn't like me at first, but it just was that he was preoccupied with what he was hearing." [...] She joined his band in 1941 and stayed for two years.|$|E

2500|$|Plants vs. Zombies {{director}} George Fan intended on {{balancing the}} game between a [...] "gritty" [...] {{game and a}} [...] "sickeningly cute" [...] game. Strong strategic elements were included to appeal to more experienced gamers, while keeping it simple to appeal to casual gamers, without many tutorials. He was inspired {{to make it a}} tower defense game after both thinking of a more defense-oriented version of a previous title of his, Insaniquarium, and playing some Warcraft III tower defense mods. While <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the towers in Warcraft III, he felt that plants would make good towers. He wanted to bring something new to the genre with Plants vs. Zombies, and he found common tower defense game play elements such as mazing and juggling to be too awkward, causing him to use the five- and six-lane set-ups that were used in the final version. The game was initially going to be called Weedlings, but as the tower defense concept took off and the personality of the game as a whole evolved, the title was later changed.|$|E
2500|$|It {{must have}} been late 1941 or early 1942. Jews were {{required}} to wear the Star of David and to obey a 6p.m. curfew. I had gone {{to play with a}} Christian friend and had stayed too late. I turned my brown sweater inside out to walk the few blocks home. As I was walking down an empty street, I saw a German soldier approaching. He was wearing the black uniform that I had been told to fear more than others – the one worn by specially recruited SS soldiers. As I came closer to him, trying to walk fast, I noticed that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> me intently. Then he beckoned me over, picked me up, and hugged me. I was terrified that he would notice the star inside my sweater. He was speaking to me with great emotion, in German. When he put me down, he opened his wallet, showed me a picture of a boy, and gave me some money. I went home more certain than ever that my mother was right: people were endlessly complicated and interesting. (Kahneman, 2003, p. 417) ...|$|E
2500|$|Emperor Xuānzong had, {{while an}} {{imperial}} prince, disliked Li Deyu's hold on power.

[...] Just seven days after taking the throne, Emperor Xuānzong, to the surprise of the entire imperial administration, sent Li Deyu out of the capital to serve as the military governor of Jingnan Circuit, and also exiled Li Deyu's associates Xue Yuanshang (薛元賞) and Xue Yuanxhang's brother Xue Yuangui (薛元龜). Soon after, Emperor Xuānzong issued an edict permitting the five former Niu Faction chancellors exiled by Emperor Wuzong—Niu Sengru, Li Zongmin, Cui Gong, Yang Sifu, and Li Jue—to be promoted to positions closer to Chang'an, although Li Zongmin died before he could be moved. Emperor Xuānzong also made Li Deyu the defender of Luoyang and removed the honorary chancellor title that he continued to carry as the military governor of Jingnan from him, further showing disapproval.|$|E
