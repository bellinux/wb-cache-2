500|$|I {{remember}} {{not just}} because it was a win, but also because it was a big fight right into the last night. Fabrizia reminded me the other night that we had a problem with the brake pads, so we lost a lot of time. We finished three days rallying (with one day to go), night and day, 32 seconds in front of Ari Vatanen. We drove the last special stage for the night, came back to the hotel and I could not sleep at all, four hours {{in front of me and}} no sleep. Then <b>I</b> <b>arrive</b> <b>at</b> the special stage, it's about 42km long, and I look at Fabrizia and I said [...] "OK, we forget everything, and we are at the first stage of the rally again, because one of us will crash." [...] And so Ari hit a rock, and we won the rally.|$|E

6000|$|Finally, <b>I</b> <b>arrive</b> <b>at</b> {{the last}} great head of my subject, to wit, Tea,--meaning thereby, as before observed, what our Hibernian friend did in the inquiry, [...] "Will y'r Honor take 'tay tay' or 'coffee tay'?" ...|$|E

60|$|It is {{past the}} time to leave off, to cease entirely from what we are doing, and from {{what we have been}} doing for {{hundreds}} of years. It is past {{the time to}} cease seeking one Infinite, ignoring, striving to eliminate the other. The Infinite is twofold, the Father and the Son, the Dark and the Light, the Senses and the Mind, the Soul and the Spirit, the self and the not-self, the Eagle and the Dove, the Tiger and the Lamb. The consummation of man is twofold, in the Self and in Selflessness. By great retrogression back to the source of darkness in me, the Self, deep in the senses, <b>I</b> <b>arrive</b> <b>at</b> the Original, Creative Infinite. By projection forth from myself, by the elimination of my absolute sensual self, <b>I</b> <b>arrive</b> <b>at</b> the Ultimate Infinite, Oneness in the Spirit. They are two Infinites, twofold approach to God. And man must know both.|$|E
60|$|And now at last <b>I</b> <b>arrive</b> <b>at</b> my {{object and}} tender my petition, making supplication to this effect: that the critics adopt a rule {{recognizing}} the Belly and the Members, and formulate a standard whereby work done for them shall be judged.

Everyone says that London is so big and cold and heartless." ...|$|E
