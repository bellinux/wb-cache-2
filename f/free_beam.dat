40|$|LISA is a {{proposed}} space-based laser interferometer detecting gravitational waves by measuring distances between free-floating test masses housed in three satellites in a triangular constellation with laser links in-between. Each satellite contains two optical benches that are articulated by moving optical subassemblies for compensating the breathing angle in the constellation. The phase reference distribution system, {{also known as}} backlink, forms an optical bi-directional path between the intra-satellite benches. In this work we discuss phase reference implementations with a target non-reciprocity of at most 2 π μ rad/√(Hz), equivalent to 1 pm/√(Hz) for a wavelength of 1064 nm in the frequency band from 0. 1 mHz to 1 Hz.

40|$|The topological and {{electronic}} structure of condensed {{matter in the}} nanometer range between molecule and solid state is an important topic of present fundamental research. Both size and interface phenomena {{and in particular the}} rise of interband transitions were determined in clusters on the nanometer scale with optical spectroscopy. Clusters made of silver are especially sensitive to these effects since they expose a very distinct Mie-resonance-absorption. Silver- and gold-cluster with the size of 2 R = 2 nm [...] . 4 nm were produced inside a thermal heater in a special high-vacuum-chamber by supersonic expansion. The cluster-density is high enough for an optical measurement in the <b>free</b> <b>beam.</b> Silver-clusters in the <b>free</b> <b>beam</b> can be compared with cluster of the same run deposited on different substrates or compared with clusters codeposited with various matrix-materials. For substrate coating and embedding matrix different materials were used: Oxides (Al 2 O 3, Sb 2 O 5, TiO 2, SrTiO 2, Cr 2 O 3, SnO 2, In 2 O 3, ITO, SiO 2), Fluorides (MgF 2, CaF 2, LiF), C 60 and Si. The detected resonance-absorption cannot be described quantitatively within the classical Mie-Theory. The extended Mie-Theory allowed the identification of electron transfer between cluster and matrix and the interface-induced damping of the free electrons within the cluster. The width of the Mie-resonance absorption is caused mainly by the damping of the 5 s-electrons in the silver-cluster. The damping depends on the cluster-size and on the chemical-interface damping at the cluster-matrix-interface. In this thesis the changes of interband-transitions in clusters compared to bulk silver were discovered by means of a Kramers-Kronig-Analysis. Electron-spill-out into the surrounding matrix, static charge transfer through chemical cluster-matrix-bonding and/or changed interband-transitions caused a shift between calculated and measured Mie-resonance maximum. The two-stage ellipsoidal model after the theory of Gans and Yamagushi takes coupling between clusters into account. The behavior at the cluster-matrix-interface is documented by an contact area of different size. Interband-transitions in the silver-cluster proved to be size-dependent and additionally matrix-dependent. This was shown for clusters in the <b>free</b> <b>beam</b> and for deposited and embedded clusters. The production of goldclusters and their measurement in the <b>free</b> <b>beam</b> should confirm the results obtained from silver-clusters. A new built thermal heater and first measurements were shown in this thesis. The last chapter is devoted to the deposition of silver-clusters on an epitactic silver film. The contact area between cluster and film has a huge influence on the specific resistance of the film. The effect was theoretically described by Kaser et al [...] In the experiment performed with stepwise rise and drop of resistance at room-temperature and low temperatures.

Atheromas were dissected from arteries with laser radiation and end points were welded in place with laser radiation. LEs (N = 8) were performed with argon ion radiation delivered through a 400 μm fiberoptic. Power was kept constant at 1 W and the average fluence was 97. 5 ± 6. 6 J/cm 2. CLEs were performed with conical sapphire probes powered by either argon ion radiation (N = 12) or Nd-YAG radiation (N = 10). Power used was 1 W to 4 W for each laser.
