Later that year, on July 7, Wilson gave away 1,000 baseball <b>gloves</b> <b>to</b> members of the Giants Community Fund's Junior Giants baseball program.|$|E
5|$|The pig-faced women {{exhibited}} at fairs were not genuine. Showmen would drug a bear into a stupor by feeding it {{large amounts of}} strong beer, and then shave it. Once shaved, the drunken bear would be fitted with padded artificial breasts, and dressed in women's clothing and a wig. Shoes would {{be attached to the}} bear's hind paws, and stuffed <b>gloves</b> <b>to</b> the front paws. The bear would then be placed in a chair with a hole in the back, and securely tied to the chair.|$|E
5|$|Daft Punk are a French {{electronic}} music duo formed in 1993 by Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter. The duo achieved significant {{popularity in the}} late 1990s {{as part of the}} French house movement and had continuous success in the years following, combining elements of house music with funk, techno, disco, rock and synthpop influences. They are also known for their visual stylization and disguises associated with their music; the duo have worn ornate helmets and <b>gloves</b> <b>to</b> assume robot personas in most of their public appearances since 2001 and rarely grant interviews or appear on television. The duo were managed from 1996 to 2008 by Pedro Winter (also known as Busy P), the head of Ed Banger Records.|$|E

5|$|During the trial, {{it emerged}} that Dyer had worn <b>gloves</b> <b>to</b> avoid leaving {{fingerprints}} on {{the letters and}} used water to stick the stamps rather than licking them, {{but that he had}} made errors, such as leaving a copy of an extortion demand on a newsagent's photocopier, however, there is speculation that this was done so his letter would reach Tesco by a person other than himself. Although Dyer initially demanded only £200,000, Tesco would have lost an estimated £5million had they complied with Dyer's demand to place cards in every copy of the Bournemouth Echo.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary body {{piercing}} studios generally take numerous precautions {{to protect the}} health of the person being pierced and the piercer. Piercers are expected to sanitize the location to be pierced as well as their hands, even though they will often wear gloves during the procedure (and in some areas must, as it is prescribed by law). Quite frequently, these gloves will be changed multiple times, often one pair for each step of setup to avoid cross contamination. For example, after a piercer wearing gloves has cleaned the area to be pierced on a client, the piercer may change <b>gloves</b> <b>to</b> avoid recontaminating the area. Wearing sterile gloves is required by law for professional piercing procedures in some areas, such as the states of Florida and South Carolina. Tools and jewellery should be sterilized in autoclaves, and non-autoclavable surfaces should be cleaned with disinfectant agents on a regular basis and between clients.|$|E
5|$|His next fight {{took place}} on January 7, 2006 at Madison Square Garden in New York City against Carlos Baldomir. For Judah, the fight {{was viewed as a}} tuneup bout that would lead to a lucrative bout between Judah and WBC Light Welterweight Champion Floyd Mayweather, Jr., which was {{tentatively}} scheduled for April. Judah entered the fight as a 10-to-1 favorite over Baldomir. The stage was set when Judah unsportingly punched Baldomir on the thigh during the prefight introductions instead of touching <b>gloves</b> <b>to</b> show sportsmanship. The early rounds of the fight were close, but as the rounds passed, Judah was doing less than necessary to win, while Baldomir kept applying pressure on Judah. In round seven, Judah was hurt by a right hand and Baldomir landed a series of right hands to Judah's head along the ropes during the tenth round. Baldomir defeated Judah by unanimous decision with scores of 115–113, 114–113 and 115–112 from the three judges.|$|E

5|$|Realizing {{he needs}} allies, Batman works with Gordon {{and the police}} to retake the prison. Sitting at the {{electric}} chair, the Joker offers Batman a choice: kill Bane, or allow Bane's heartbeat to charge the chair and kill the Joker. Batman uses the electric <b>gloves</b> <b>to</b> stop Bane's heart. Satisfied, the Joker leaves, intending to detonate bombs placed around the city. Batman revives Bane, who injects himself with a steroid that transforms him into a hulking beast. He loses the ensuing battle to Batman and suffers amnesia as a side effect from the steroid, thus preserving Batman's secret identity. With Gordon's help, Batman locates the Joker in the prison chapel. Dismayed that Bane is still alive, the Joker tries to goad Batman into killing him but Batman subdues him instead. Gordon chooses not to pursue Batman, believing he can help the city. In a radio interview during the credits, Quincy Sharp says he will lobby to reopen Arkham Asylum to house the city's worst criminals; after the credits, an imprisoned Deathstroke is approached by Amanda Waller to join her Suicide Squad.|$|E
5|$|Elsa, {{princess of}} Arendelle and heiress to the throne, is {{born with the}} ability to create and control ice and snow. As a child, she uses her {{abilities}} to create a winter wonderland to play in with her younger sister and best friend, Princess Anna. One night, Elsa accidentally harms Anna with her powers. The king and queen of Arendelle hurriedly take Anna to a tribe of mountain trolls to be healed. While healing Anna, the trolls inform the royals present that Elsa's abilities will grow, becoming both beautiful and very dangerous so she must learn to control them. While the trolls erase Anna's memory of the incident and of her elder sister's powers in general, Elsa is traumatized by the event. The king and queen take steps to control and hide Elsa's ice powers: the castle gates are locked, Elsa is shut away in her bedroom for most of the time, she is given <b>gloves</b> <b>to</b> help suppress her powers and is told to hold in her emotions as well. Nonetheless her powers continue to grow even stronger and so she becomes fearful of harming those she cares about most. Meanwhile, her sister Anna is less happy and confused by the loss of contact with her elder sister and tries, without success, to coax her out of her room. When the sisters grow into teenagers, the ship in which the king and queen are sailing is capsized in a storm and they drown, leaving Anna and Elsa feeling even more lonely.|$|E

25|$|Prior to {{touching}} an object, individuals should {{wash their}} hands and determine the most appropriate handling procedures based on the medium being handled.

Glass, glazed ceramics, and other potentially slippery surfaces should be handled using latex or vinyl <b>gloves</b> <b>to</b> prevent slippage. Prior to handling an object, {{it is also important to}} (1) take note of any structural weaknesses so that direct pressure on these areas may be avoided, (2) any clothing or accoutrements with the potential to scratch or catch on the object should be secured, and (3) the object's weight should be considered so that additional help may be requested when handling heavier objects.|$|E

25|$|Baseball players use thin, round {{bats and}} wear <b>gloves</b> <b>to</b> field (with the catcher wearing a special, more {{protective}} glove), while cricketers use wide, flat bats and field barehanded (except for the wicket-keeper, who wears gloves and protective leg pads). Note that while baseball fielders' gloves do provide modest protection against impact, {{they are used}} primarily to extend reach and are generally not padded (except for the catcher's glove). In cricket a batsman wears protective gear such as pads, gloves, thigh pads, helmet, a chest guard, an arm pad and a box (A.K.A. a cup), whereas the only required protective gear for baseball batters is an unsecured helmet (as required in major league baseball rule 1.16); many batters also use elbow, shin, ankle, or hand protectors, and most wear a cup (A.K.A. a box) and use batting gloves (similar to golf <b>gloves)</b> <b>to</b> aid grip.|$|E
