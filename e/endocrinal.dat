5000|$|Crook was {{a pioneer}} in the early {{development}} of socio-ecology, adding this dimension to ethology which was then dominated by the ideas of [...] "Niko" [...] Tinbergen and Konrad Lorenz. His student paper on the gulls of Southampton Water while at University of Southampton, led to his doctoral study at Jesus College, Cambridge of the weaver birds (Ploceidae) of West Africa, supervised by William Homan Thorpe and Robert Hinde. This was followed by further research in India, the Seychelles Islands and East Africa. His theoretical interpretation subsequently contributed to David Lack’s discussion of the behavioural component in avian population research. His fieldwork was further supported by laboratory experimentation on the <b>endocrinal</b> basis for the behaviour observed in the field.|$|E
5000|$|Benedek {{is said to}} have [...] "played {{a central}} role in the {{development}} of psychoanalysis in the United States". Influenced by the theories of hysteria promulgated by Freud, her early research had sought a link between psychological and <b>endocrinal</b> factors for such problems as anxiety, aggression, and diabetes. In the United States, working with endocrinologist Boris B. Rubinstein, she conducted extensive studies on the correlation between ovulation and female emotions, resulting in the 1942 book The Sexual Cycle in Women. Benedek explored a link between the estrogen/progesterone cycle and a woman's desire to engage in sexual intercourse, nurture a pregnancy, and raise children. She also described the [...] "modern" [...] woman's struggle with her natural maternal role. Benedek's analysis of the [...] "un-motherly modern mother" [...] was widely praised and included in psychology and medical teaching manuals.|$|E
5000|$|Science of Living (Jeevan Vigyan; Jeevan = Life and Vigyan = Science) is a {{detailed}} program that complements the current educational approach with spiritual and value based learning. While both {{mental and physical}} development is needed for a student's growth, Jeevan Vigyan adds a third pillar - that of emotional intelligence and morality (or values) - to education in schools and colleges. A combination of theory and practice, Jeevan Vigyan draws {{on the findings of}} various life-sciences as well as nutritional sciences.

5000|$|Myths, therefore, are (very) early {{attempts}} at articulating what, in 1945, Aldous Huxley called Perennial Philosophy, and simultaneously mystical and practical in their origins. Much {{of the practical}} aim of a myth is instruction in what Sansonese calls [...] "the art of dying," [...] a narrative prefiguring of the literal experience of somatic death, which {{is a matter of}} the practical mastery of an <b>endocrinal</b> event that he suggestively describes as a [...] "pituitary catastrophe," [...] {{in the sense that the}} pituitary gland initiates it. In Nigro Sansonese's view, death is an event triggered by the endocrine system. In sum, Nigro Sansonese defines an [...] "authentic myth" [...] as [...] "an esoteric description of a heightened proprioception," [...] meaning a verbal description, albeit a necessarily imperfect one, of a literal experience undergone by an adept while in a trance state, which, very critically, must be distinguished from mere symbolism or metaphor. Understanding religious practice (praxis) eclipses understanding religious belief (dogma) in understanding both the origin and the meaning of a specific myth of sufficient antiquity (see also his lengthy discussion of the Eleusinian Mysteries).|$|E

In 1946, Beach accepted an academic appointment at Yale University where he would spend the next decade.

A sabbatical at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford began in 1957-58. In 1958, Beach accepted a position as Professor of Psychology at the University of California, Berkeley. The research program on dogs that was initiated at Yale was expanded at Berkeley. Beach helped found the Field Station for Behavioral Research near the Berkeley campus. Beach was known for being an excellent mentor to graduate students while at Berkley. Beach became professor emeritus in 1978, but still remained active in his work. Beach was awarded the APA award for Distinguished Teaching in Biopsychology in 1986.|$|E

40|$|Vertebrates exhibit varied {{behavioural}} {{and physiological}} tactics to promote reproductive success. We examined mechanisms that could enable female loggerhead turtles to undertake nesting activities and maintain seasonal reproduction despite recent shark injuries of varying severity. We proposed that <b>endocrinal</b> mechanisms that regulate both a turtle's stress response and reproductive ability are modified to promote successful and continued reproduction. Irrespective {{of the degree}} of injury, females did not exhibit increased levels of the stress hormone corticosterone, nor decreased levels of the reproductive steroid testosterone; hormone responses consistent with stress. When exposed to a capture stressor, females with shark injury did not exhibit any greater corticosterone response than controls. In addition, breeding females showed a reduced corticosterone stress response compared to non-breeding females. Reduced <b>endocrinal</b> responses following shark injury, and during breeding in general may, in part, enable females to maintain behavioural and physiological commitment to reproduction...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Objectives: A {{systematic}} {{overview of}} time trends in hospital contacts among Danish seafarers and fishermen by job title and analyses on skin and infectious diseases. Methods: Occupational cohorts with hospital contacts 1994 – 1998 and 1999 – 2003. Standardized hospital contact ratios (SHCR) were estimated using national rates and ranked by SHCR size.

As for skin diseases, male fishermen and non-officer seamen generally had increased SHCRs, but engine room personnel specifically had a low SHCR for eczema (eight cases).
