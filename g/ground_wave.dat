25|$|The {{propagation}} of sound waves through the ground {{taking advantage of}} the earths ability to more efficiently transmit low frequency is known as Audio <b>ground</b> <b>wave</b> (AGW).|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 1900s, many experimenters {{were looking for}} ways to use this concept for {{locating}} the position of a transmitter. Early radio systems generally used longwave or medium wave signals. Longwave, in particular, had good long-distance transmission characteristics due to their limited interaction with the ground, and thereby provided excellent great circle route <b>ground</b> <b>wave</b> propagation that pointed directly to the transmitter. Methods of performing RDF on longwave signals was a major area of research during the 1900s and 1910s.|$|E

5000|$|Radio {{waves at}} MF {{wavelengths}} propagate via <b>ground</b> <b>waves</b> and reflection from the ionosphere ( [...] called skywaves). [...] <b>Ground</b> <b>waves</b> follow the contour of the Earth. At these wavelengths they can bend (diffract) over hills, and travel beyond the visual horizon; typical MF radio stations can cover a radius {{of several hundred}} miles from the transmitter, with longer distances over water and damp earth.

2500|$|At lower {{frequencies}} in the MF, LF, and VLF bands, due to diffraction {{radio waves}} can bend over obstacles like hills, and travel beyond the horizon as surface waves which follow the contour of the Earth. [...] These are called <b>ground</b> <b>waves.</b> [...] AM broadcasting stations use <b>ground</b> <b>waves</b> {{to cover their}} listening areas. [...] As the frequency gets lower the attenuation with distance decreases, so very low frequency (VLF) and extremely low frequency (ELF) <b>ground</b> <b>waves</b> {{can be used to}} communicate worldwide. [...] VLF and ELF waves can penetrate significant distances through water and earth, and these frequencies are used for mine communication and military communication with submerged submarines.|$|R

2500|$|In physics, {{a surface}} wave is a {{mechanical}} wave that propagates along {{the interface between}} differing media. [...] A common example is gravity waves along the surface of liquids, such as ocean waves. [...] Gravity waves can also occur within liquids, at the interface between two fluids with different densities. [...] Elastic surface waves can travel along the surface of solids, such as Rayleigh or Love waves. [...] Electromagnetic waves can also propagate as [...] "surface waves" [...] in {{that they can be}} guided along a refractive index gradient or along an interface between two media having different dielectric constants. In radio transmission, a <b>ground</b> <b>wave</b> is a guided wave that propagates close {{to the surface of the}} Earth.|$|E

Attenuation is proportional to the frequency making this mode mainly useful for LF and VLF frequencies (see also Earth-ionosphere waveguide).|$|R

2500|$|Conductivity of {{the surface}} affects the {{propagation}} of <b>ground</b> <b>waves,</b> with more conductive surfaces such as sea water providing better propagation. Increasing the conductivity in a surface results in less dissipation. The refractive indices are subject to spatial and temporal changes. Since the ground is not a perfect electrical conductor, <b>ground</b> <b>waves</b> are attenuated as they follow the earth’s surface. [...] The wavefronts initially are vertical, but the ground, acting as a lossy dielectric, causes the wave to tilt forward as it travels. [...] This directs some of the energy into the earth where it is dissipated, so that the signal decreases exponentially.|$|R

40|$|The time {{evolution}} of the <b>ground</b> state <b>wave</b> function of an exciton in an ideal bilayer system is investigated {{within the framework of}} the effective-mass approximation.

The variation amplitude and period of the modulus squared of the <b>ground</b> state <b>wave</b> function increase with the in-plane electric field F-r for a fixed in-plane relative coordinate r and fixed separation d between the electron and hole layers.

2500|$|<b>Ground</b> <b>waves</b> {{have been}} used in over-the-horizon radar, which {{operates}} mainly at frequencies between 2 and 20MHz over the sea, which has a sufficiently high conductivity to convey them to and from a reasonable distance (up to 100km or more; over-horizon radar also uses skywave propagation at much greater distances). In the development of radio, <b>ground</b> <b>waves</b> were used extensively. Early commercial and professional radio services relied exclusively on long wave, low frequencies and ground-wave propagation. [...] To prevent interference with these services, amateur and experimental transmitters were restricted to the high frequencies (HF), felt to be useless since their ground-wave range was limited. [...] Upon discovery of the other propagation modes possible at medium wave and short wave frequencies, the advantages of HF for commercial and military purposes became apparent. Amateur experimentation was then confined only to authorized frequencies in the range.|$|R
50|$|The {{distance}} {{over which}} radio communications is useful depends significantly on {{things other than}} wavelength, such as transmitter power, receiver quality, type, size, and height of antenna, mode of transmission, noise, and interfering signals. <b>Ground</b> <b>waves,</b> tropospheric scatter and skywaves can all achieve greater ranges than line-of-sight propagation. The study of radio propagation allows estimates of useful range to be made.|$|R
50|$|LORAN-C chains were {{organized}} into the Master station, M, {{and up to}} five Secondary stations, V, W, X, Y, Z. All were broadcast at 100 kHz, a much lower frequency than earlier systems. The result was a signal that offered a daytime <b>ground</b> <b>wave</b> range of 2,250 miles, nighttime <b>ground</b> <b>wave</b> of 1,650 miles and skywaves out to 3,000 miles.

In real-world use, the Coast Guard quoted absolute accuracy of 0.25 nautical miles, or better.|$|E
5000|$|When using {{medium to}} high {{frequency}} radio telecommunication, there are radio waves which travel both {{parallel to the}} ground, and towards the ionosphere, {{referred to as a}} <b>ground</b> <b>wave</b> and sky wave, respectively. A skip zone is an annular region between the farthest points at which the <b>ground</b> <b>wave</b> can be received and the nearest point at which the refracted sky waves can be received. Within this region, no signal can be received because, due to the conditions of the local ionosphere, the relevant sky waves are not reflected but penetrate the ionosphere.|$|E

2500|$|Mediumwave and shortwave reflect off the {{ionosphere}} at night, {{which is}} known as skywave. During daylight hours, the lower D layer of the ionosphere forms and absorbs lower frequency energy.
