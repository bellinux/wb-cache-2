40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to develop a {{proposed}} program that would provide comprehensive preparation for prospective secondary and elementary school administrators in Jamaica. The population consisted of one hundred practicing school administrators in Jamaica. A Q-sort technique was used to prioritize thirty-six educational preparation <b>goal</b> <b>statements.</b> The twenty most important goals were chosen and rank-ordered to develop a core curriculum for the proposed program. Findings The following <b>goal</b> <b>statements</b> were ranked as the four most important goals by practicing school administrators:-Goal Statement 1 [...] "Develop competence in selection, development and evaluation of personnel. "-Goal Statement 3 [...] "Development and understanding of the decision making process. "-Goal Statement 13 [...] "Develop competence in providing leadership in the development of the total school curriculum and educational policies. "-Goal Statement 27 [...] "Develop competence in fostering and maintaining staff and student morale. "Goal statements judged to be the least important by practicing school administrators were:-Goal Statement 16 [...] "Develop competence in the process of negotiations and concepts of labor relations in the public school setting. "-Goal Statement 33 [...] "Develop competence in the use of computers in educational operations and in the decision making process. " Conclusions The judgment of practicing school administrators regarding core preparation experiences needed by prospective administrators was revealed by the final rank-ordering of the set of twenty educational <b>goal</b> <b>statements.</b> Since the rank-ordering of the <b>goal</b> <b>statements</b> revealed that administrators in all types of positions were in substantial agreement on the items ranked in the top half of the set of twenty <b>goal</b> <b>statements</b> it would seem reasonable that the core of a program include the content suggested from these items.

40|$|Graduation date: 1984 A new {{organization}} was created when Oregon State University (OSU) School of Education and Western Oregon State College (WOSC) Division of Education merged into the OSU-WOSC School of Education {{in the fall}} of 1982. Two education faculties from two different kinds of institutions (i. e., a large university and a small four-year state college) were combined. A literature review established the importance of goals for an organization, identified important goal studies, and identified the IGI (Institutional Goals Inventory) as a popular instrument for clarifying goal orientations. The instrument contains <b>goal</b> <b>statements</b> divided into 20 goal areas of four statements each, plus 10 additional statements totaling 90 statements in all. The IGI was completed by a randomly selected sample of education faculty at OSU and WOSC. Analysis of variance was the statistical tool. A comparison of "should be" (preferred) goal means were tested for significant differences between OSU and WOSC faculty. Goal areas and <b>goal</b> <b>statements</b> were ranked to determine priorities for future planning for the {{new organization}}. ss, From a total of 20 goal areas, statistical differences were found in only two areas: Research and Advanced Training. OSU faculty gave higher mean ratings to these two goal areas than WOSC faculty. Strong similarities between institutions were indicated when goals were ranked and put in order of priority. Seven <b>goal</b> <b>statements</b> were common to both institutions when the 10 <b>goal</b> <b>statements</b> with highest "should be" means were ranked. When five priority <b>goal</b> <b>statements</b> were ranked, three similar statements were listed for both OSU and WOSC.

40|$|As {{representations}} of the aims, mission, and aspirations of industrial arts/technology educators, the written goals of the field have always prescribed a liberal educational role for industrial arts/technology education. <b>Goal</b> <b>statements</b> exceed the single goal of skill development and include such goals as helping students to become wise consumers and problem solvers and to understand industry and technology. Industrial arts/technology education goals have evolved over time. This evolution has reflected a drift towards more liberal education ideals with goals which specify {{the study of the}} relationships among industry, technology, and society, the interdisciplinary nature of the field, and general problem solving. The practice of industrial arts/technology education, however, has not always demonstrated a clear relationship to those <b>goal</b> <b>statements.</b> Industrial arts/technology education laboratories and student activities often resemble vocational education laboratories and student activities. Moreover, much of the prescriptive theory of curriculum planning for industrial arts/technology education is technical in nature, relying upon curriculum planning techniques which are based upon behaviorism.

To use a {{taxonomy}} of goal content, developed in community-based brain injury rehabilitation {{to examine and}} compare the content of goals set within two different service settings; and to further examine {{the potential of the}} taxonomy to be a reliable and comprehensive framework for classifying goals. Method. Qualitative analysis and categorization of 1492 <b>goal</b> <b>statements</b> extracted from a community-based brain injury rehabilitation service over two time periods (1996 - 97, 1998 - 99), and cross-organizational comparison of ratings of goal classifications using a random sample of 100 <b>goal</b> <b>statements</b> drawn from this data set and the original 1765 <b>goal</b> <b>statements</b> used in developing the taxonomy. Results. Application of the taxonomy beyond the original service setting in which it was developed indicated a strong inter-rater reliability, with a high test-retest agreement reported over time. For both services, a small number of categories accounted for a substantial proportion of goals set within the two time periods, while considerable change was evident in goals between the two periods for one service. Further, both placed emphasis on individually focused goals rather than relationship or family-related goals. Conclusion. The taxonomy provides a reliable means for classifying goals and is a useful tool for exploration of the multiple influences on goal setting. Further application of the taxonomy to examine the relative influence on goal setting of client factors versus a range of organizational factors would be beneficial...|$|R

40|$|Solving {{problems}} in many real-world domains requires integrating knowledge from several past experiences. This integration requires the dynamic retrieval of multiple experiences and {{the extraction of}} their relevant subparts. Our solution is the Multi-Plan Adaptor (MPA), a method for merging partial-order plans {{in the context of}} case-based least-commitment planning. MPA provides this ability by extracting an intermediate <b>goal</b> <b>statement</b> from a partial plan, clipping a stored plan to the intermediate <b>goal</b> <b>statement,</b> and then splicing the clipping into the original partial plan. MPA is implemented in the NICOLE multistrategy reasoning system, where it is paired with MOORE, an asynchronous, resource-bounded memory module. MOORE initially retrieves its current "best guess" but continues search, spontaneously returning a better retrieval as soon as it is found. 1.

The task objective is to generate an assembly sequence from a physical specification of the assembly structure. An assembly design is carried out by specifying mating conditions between geometric feawres of two components belonging to an assembly structure. The set of mating conditions and components specify the assembly structure to be constructed: a <b>goal</b> <b>statement</b> for the planner. The assembly planning is to order the individual assembly operations to avoid subassemblies that may block a collision-free path for future assembly operations. Two complimentary approaches to the assembly planning is presented. One is based on projecting spatial interferences between sibling subassemblies. TIle <b>goal</b> <b>statement</b> is hierarchically structured into subassemblies, forming an assembly hierarchy.

Data were collected by administration of a 35 -item survey instrument which was administered to 50 senior academic and administrative personnel in the Faculty of Education at the University of Nigeria-Nsukka. These subjects were divided into two groups of 25 subjects each. Subjects in Group 1 rated the extent to which goals of university education in Nigeria were being attained at the University of Nigeria-Nsukka. Subjects in Group 2 rated the extent to which goals of university education in Nigeria were preferred as goals for the University of Nigeria-Nsukka. Data used for treatment and analysis {{in this study}} were provided by return of 41 usable survey instruments. ^ The major findings of the study are: (1) A moderate correlation (. 48) between perceptions and ratings of goals attained and goals preferred was present (p 3 ̆c. 001). (2) Twenty-nine of 35 <b>goal</b> <b>statements</b> which were rated were perceived as being attained. (3) Twenty-seven of 35 <b>goal</b> <b>statements</b> which were rated were perceived as being preferred with all preferred <b>goal</b> <b>statements</b> being among the 29 <b>goal</b> <b>statements</b> which were perceived as being attained. (4) Levels of attained and preferred involvement of the Nigerian federal government in governance of university education were perceived to be congruent. (5) Levels of attained and preferred involvement of various roles and agencies in selection of goals and policies for the University of Nigeria-Nsukka were perceived to be congruent. ^ Based on means for perceived levels of attainment and preference, as well as priority ratings made by respondents, five major goals for university education in Nigeria were identified. Programs should (1) provide for national development, (2) be relevant to the needs of the society, (3) be relevant to the needs of individuals, (4) provide students with an understanding of the world around them, and (5) provide for life-long education. ...|$|R
