25|$|Fitzpatrick {{continues}} to develop her {{ideas of the}} importance of community with an analysis of digital text preservation in which she proposes that current technical issues with digital text preservation will require social solutions. This proposal is based on Fitzpatrick’s reasoning that difficulties in the preservation of digital texts are not caused by any quality inherent to digital artifacts but, rather, stem from our understanding of digital products and our social practices concerning their use. It is often assumed that issues with <b>digital</b> <b>preservation</b> are due to the ephemeral quality of digital artifacts. Fitzpatrick points out that this is not entirely correct, illustrating that print text is by no means permanent and digital text is far more permanent than is commonly thought. The loss of access to digital texts or their interpretability, sometimes due to incompatibility between older media formats and newer platforms, is mistakenly perceived as the loss of digital texts themselves. Establishing this fact, Fitzpatrick argues that <b>digital</b> <b>preservation</b> efforts should not focus entirely on technical solutions to technical issues, but instead should concentrate on developing socially organized preservation systems. In addition to focusing on the development of preservation practices through community organization, Fitzpatrick argues that creators of digital artifacts must take steps to ensure the compatibility of their work with preservation efforts, stating: “…planning for the persistent availability of digital resources as {{part of the process of}} their creation will provide the greatest stability of the resources themselves at the least possible cost”.|$|E
25|$|Launched in 2003 under Nanakshahi Trust, the Punjab Digital Library was {{a result}} of the early phase of the digital {{revolution}} in Punjab. While most saw the Nanakshahi as a small digitisation organisation, or as an assemblage of some unknown youth working towards capturing some manuscripts on their digital cameras, its founders saw it as a cornerstone of a fundamentally new approach to preserving Punjab's heritage for future generations. In the shadow of search engines, a Semantic Web approach conceived in the early 2003 reached maturity in 2006. This was when the organisation planned to expand its operations from a mere three-employee organisation to one of the leading NGOs working in the field of <b>digital</b> <b>preservation</b> all over India.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{short-lived}} {{nature of the}} game {{and the fact that the}} gameplay is intimately connected to the vocal SoundLink files that were broadcast into RAM and were thus incapable of <b>digital</b> <b>preservation</b> by receiving Satellaview-owners, the game cannot currently be played in its original form. Despite this, however, a small subculture of collectors and enthusiasts devoted to the restoration of these games have successfully managed to dump the digital information originally downloaded to and saved on the Satellaview's 8M memory packs. As temporally limited games, the copies of BS Zelda that had been saved on 8M Memory Packs were initially intended by Nintendo and St.GIGA for players to over-write with later games. The fortuitous preservation of these 8M Memory Packs is responsible for all subsequent emulation efforts related to the games.|$|E

25|$|The station's news {{broadcasts}} – which originally aired only in {{the evening}} until the launch of a midday newscast in 1972 – began implementing a hosted format in 1967, when Bob Schieffer and Russ Bloxom joined the station as anchors for The Texas News, appearing on camera ahead of and after the newsreel segments. The program officially converted to a live-on-tape broadcast on August 1, 1969. Concurrent with the station's move to The Studios at DFW, KXAS donated its collection of news footage shot for The Texas News from the 1950s through the 1970s to the University of North Texas Libraries in Denton in November 2013; the film reels and accompanying script images were digitized by the university for availability to the public via the library's <b>digital</b> <b>preservation</b> network.|$|E
2500|$|The {{management}} {{of a cultural}} heritage object serves to identify the staff members responsible for care and maintenance of the collection, and establish proper management technique guidelines. Records management should take place when an object enters a collection, when it is moved or shipped, during regular collection inventories, and throughout any conservation treatment as per established collection management policy standards. Records {{management of}} a cultural heritage object often {{takes place in the}} form of photographic documentation combined with written reports designed to provide a visual reference for future professionals, revealing the original condition and any successive states of the condition. [...] These records are sometimes digitized and stored in computer databases using collection cataloging software. One aspect of records management designed specifically for sustaining these digitized records and documenting digital collection materials is known as <b>digital</b> <b>preservation.</b> This technique is used to reformat or duplicate an original object so as to preserve a piece of digital material for as long as possible. Combining strategic planning with conservation actions, <b>digital</b> <b>preservation</b> aims to maintain continued access to digital objects that would otherwise become obsolete.|$|E

Unlike common peer production models emphasis is placed on the expertise of its members as <b>digital</b> <b>preservations,</b> as well as the absorption of digital repositories.
