5|$|Between February and June 1806, <b>Emerald</b> {{underwent}} repairs at Deptford dockyard and was recommissioned under Captain John Armour; Frederick Lewis Maitland assumed {{command in}} the first quarter of 1807. While in the Basque Roads in April, <b>Emerald</b> captured the 14-gun privateer Austerlitz, a brig from Nantes under the command of Captain Gatien Lafont. <b>Emerald,</b> while escorting a Spanish polacca that she had taken, spotted and captured the privateer on 14 April after a ten-hour chase. Austerlitz had been out of port two days but had made no captures; the polacca was the Spanish ship Prince of Asturias, which had sailed from La Guayra with a cargo of cocoa, bark and indigo. <b>Emerald</b> sent both prizes into Plymouth, where they arrived on 22 April. <b>Emerald</b> herself set off in pursuit of another vessel from La Guayra.|$|E
5|$|Government {{agencies}} {{in both the}} USA and Canada have utilized a native species of parasitoid wasp, Cerceris fumipennis, {{as a means of}} detecting areas to which <b>emerald</b> ash borer has spread. The females of these wasps hunt other jewel beetles and <b>emerald</b> ash borer if it is present. The wasps stun the beetles and carry them back to their burrows in the ground where they are stored until the wasps’ eggs hatch and the wasp larvae feed on the beetles. Volunteers catch the wasps as they return to their burrows carrying the beetles to determine whether <b>emerald</b> ash borer is present. This methodology is known as biological surveillance, as opposed to biological control, because it does not appear that the wasps have a significant negative impact on <b>emerald</b> ash borer populations.|$|E
5|$|However, the unfazed Eggman awakens a {{creature}} named Chaos from a huge gem called the Master <b>Emerald.</b> The animals fight {{a losing battle}} to retrieve the Emeralds until Chaos absorbs all seven and becomes giant, but an echidna girl named Tikal, who entombed herself and Chaos in the Master <b>Emerald</b> millennia ago, emerges to help placate him. After Sonic uses the Chaos Emeralds to become Super Sonic, he defeats Chaos, who returns to the Master <b>Emerald</b> with Tikal.|$|E
25|$|The mining of <b>emeralds</b> was {{conducted}} using coas, long thick wooden poles. The people dug holes {{during the rainy}} seasons next to the emerald-containing rocks and the <b>emeralds</b> from sedimentary rocks would wash into the holes that dried up and provided the clean <b>emeralds.</b> <b>Emeralds</b> from veins in metamorphic rocks were excavated using sharp poles.|$|R

5|$|In {{an attempt}} to steal the six Chaos <b>Emeralds</b> and harness their power, the game's antagonist, Dr. Ivo Robotnik, has trapped the animal {{inhabitants}} of South Island in aggressive robots and stationary metal capsules. The player controls Sonic, who aims to halt Robotnik's plans by freeing his animal friends and collecting the <b>emeralds</b> himself. If the player collects all the Chaos <b>Emeralds</b> and completes the game, an ending sequence is shown. If all the <b>emeralds</b> are not collected, Robotnik taunts the player while juggling any of the Chaos <b>Emeralds</b> not collected by the player.|$|R
5|$|In {{areas where}} <b>emerald</b> ash borer {{has not yet}} been detected, surveys are used to monitor for new infestations. Visual surveys are used to find ash trees {{displaying}} <b>emerald</b> ash borer damage, and traps with colors attractive to <b>emerald</b> ash borer, such as purple or green, are hung in trees as part of a monitoring program. These traps can also have volatile pheromones applied to them that attract primarily males.|$|E
5|$|Knuckles {{encounters}} Rouge and Eggman, who try {{to steal}} the Master <b>Emerald.</b> He stops them by shattering the <b>emerald</b> and searches for the scattered shards. Rouge, spying for the government, heads to Eggman's base and the ARK. There, Shadow shows Eggman the Eclipse Cannon, another superweapon created by Gerald, and discloses his plan: to charge the cannon with Chaos Emeralds {{and use it to}} take over the world. Rouge appears, offering them a Chaos <b>Emerald</b> to gain their trust.|$|E

40|$|Abstract 	Goodman’s grue {{paradox is}} {{unassailable}} if we hold that instances confirm generalizations, for the evidence at hand {{is both an}} instance of ‘All <b>emeralds</b> are green’ and ‘All <b>emeralds</b> are grue’. But if we consider what bearing the denials of the two hypotheses have on the evidence, a very different picture emerges. This paper argues that the denial of ‘All <b>emeralds</b> are grue’ is more positively relevant to the evidence to date than the denial of ‘All <b>emeralds</b> are green’ is to the evidence and that therefore ‘All <b>emeralds</b> are green’ is better supported by the evidence than ‘All <b>emeralds</b> are grue’. The measure of support we employ—S(h|e) = p(e|h) – p(e| h) —is motivated by the familiar relevance condition of confirmation, namely e confirms h only if p(h|e) > p(h). ...|$|R

5|$|While off {{the coast}} of Ireland on 8 October, <b>Emerald</b> rescued a British brig by {{capturing}} Incomparable, an 8-gun French privateer. The Frenchman was about to take the British vessel when <b>Emerald</b> intervened. Incomparable had a crew of 63 men and was four days out of Saint-Malo, but had not yet captured any other vessel. Still in Irish waters on 6 November, <b>Emerald</b> took the 16-gun French brig , two days out of Brest and bound for Guadeloupe. After an all-night chase, <b>Emerald</b> caught up. Capitaine de fregate Croquet Deschateurs of Fanfaron resisted, firing several broadsides and a final double-shotted broadside. Unable to escape, Deschateurs prepared to board but <b>Emerald</b> evaded the manouvre and fired a broadside that dismasted Fanfaron, leaving Deschateurs no option but to surrender his vessel. The subsequent French court-martial not only absolved Deschateurs of any liability for the loss but also commended him for his conduct. Four days later <b>Emerald</b> arrived at Cork with Fanfaron and Luna. Fanfaron, with a crew of 113, had been carrying a cargo of flour, salt, and other provisions, as well as iron, lead, and nails, all for Guadeloupe.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of February 1810, <b>Emerald</b> captured and sent into Plymouth, Commerce, Hanson, master, which had been sailing from Drontheim to Bordeaux. Then on 22 March, <b>Emerald</b> captured the 350-ton (bm) Belle Etoile in the Bay of Biscay. Caught after a twelve-hour chase during which she jettisoned much of her cargo; Belle Etoile, out of Bayonne, was pierced for 20 guns but only carried eight. Carrying a cargo of wine, flour, oil, and other merchandise to Île de France, she was sent into Cork with her 56-man crew. <b>Emerald</b> captured an American ship, Wasp, in July 1810. Wasp was carrying 91 passengers from New York to Bordeaux; they arrived at Plymouth on 30 July.|$|E
50|$|The Chaos <b>Emeralds</b> are, in most games, seven <b>emeralds</b> with mystical powers; {{they are}} a {{recurring}} feature of Sonic games.

50|$|The {{territories of}} the Muisca {{contained}} rich mineral resources of various kinds. Salt was mainly extracted in Zipaquirá, Nemocón and Tausa with minor mining activity in Sesquilé, Gámeza, and Guachetá. <b>Emeralds</b> were mined in Somondoco, Coscuez and Ubalá. Carbon exploitation was executed in Sugamuxi, Tópaga and Gámeza. Copper mining {{took place in}} Gachantivá, Moniquirá and Sumapaz. Gold and silver deposits were not common in the Muisca area and mostly obtained through trade.The mining of <b>emeralds</b> was conducted using coas, long thick wooden poles. The people dug holes during the rainy seasons next to the emerald-containing rocks and the <b>emeralds</b> from sedimentary rocks would wash into the holes that dried up and provided the clean <b>emeralds.</b> <b>Emeralds</b> from veins in metamorphic rocks were excavated using sharp poles.Carbon was a common resource in the Muisca territory and was found mainly in the Bogotá and Guaduas Formations.

40|$|Roman gold jewellery, {{which was}} {{excavated}} in Ptuj (Poetovio) {{and consists of}} a necklace, earrings and a braceletwith embedded <b>emeralds,</b> {{is part of the}} Slovenian archaeological artefacts collections. Crystallographic characteristics,inclusions, luminous phenomena and geological characteristics were determined in order to establish theorigin of the <b>emeralds.</b> Chemical composition of the <b>emeralds</b> was determined non-destructively using the methodsof proton-induced X-rays and gamma rays (PIXE/PIGE). The results were compared with reference emeraldsfrom Habachtal in Austria and with green beryls from the Ural Mts. Literature data for <b>emeralds</b> from Egypt andmodern-day Afghanistan area were used to interpret the results. Specifically, these sites were known for emeraldsbeing mined for jewellery in Roman times. It was assumed that <b>emeralds</b> from archaeological artefacts originatedfrom Habachtal in Austria, given that this site was the nearest to the place where found. But the <b>emeralds</b> fromthe necklace and earrings in fact came from Egyptian deposits. The origin of <b>emeralds</b> from the bracelet could nothave been determined absolutely reliably {{due to the lack of}} comparative materials; they may originate from a site inmodern-day Afghanistan or from Egypt, but certainly not from the same site as the previously mentioned emeraldsin the necklace and earrings...|$|R
