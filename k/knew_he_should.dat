5|$|At 1:24a.m., {{one of the}} two men outside {{pushed the}} buzzer near the door and told Abath they were policemen who heard of a {{disturbance}} in the courtyard, and requested to be let inside. Abath <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> not let uninvited guests inside, but he was unsure on whether the rule applied to police officers. He could see the men and believed them to be police officers based on their uniforms. With his partner on patrol, Abath decided to buzz in the men. When the intruders arrived at the main security desk, one of them told Abath that he looked familiar and there was a default warrant out for his arrest. Abath stepped out from behind his desk, where the only alarm button to alert police could be accessed. He was quickly asked for his ID, ordered to face the wall, and then handcuffed. Abath believed the arrest was a misunderstanding, until he realized he hadn't been frisked before being cuffed, and one officer's mustache was made of wax. The second security guard arrived minutes later and was also handcuffed, after which he asked the intruders why he was being arrested. The thieves explained that they were not being arrested, but rather this was a robbery, and proceeded to take the guards to the museum's basement. They handcuffed the guards to pipes and wrapped duct tape around their hands, feet, and heads.|$|E
6000|$|Alfred {{listened for}} {{the tone of his}} mother's voice; he <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> judge by that, even without {{catching}} the words--low, subdued, sad--he almost thought she began with 'Yes.' ...|$|E
60|$|Clement saw {{the crisis}} was come which he had long expected, and rejoiced at the form it had taken, though he <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> suffer from {{pursuing}} the subject.|$|E
50|$|The {{figure is}} taking {{stealthy}} steps, {{looking back to}} examine the scene he is leaving. Apparently he is doing something <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> not be doing, and is attempting {{to get away with}} it anyway.|$|R
6000|$|The {{ceremony}} was {{still to be}} fulfilled, and the smith's wife called them to order by saying, [...] "Good luck to the young gentleman. He is a stranger here, or <b>he</b> would have <b>known</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> have come up by our path! Will you try the well, your Grace?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, it's spring," [...] thought Colville; and then, {{with the}} {{selfishness}} of the troubled soul, he wished {{that it might}} be winter still and indefinitely. It occurred to him now that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> not go back to Des Vaches, for <b>he</b> did not <b>know</b> what <b>he</b> <b>should</b> do there. <b>He</b> would go to New York: though <b>he</b> did not <b>know</b> what <b>he</b> <b>should</b> do in New York, either.|$|R
60|$|He went on packing, {{and putting}} {{away with the}} {{different}} garments the unpleasant thoughts that he <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> be sure to unpack with them in Rome; but they would then have less poignancy.|$|E
60|$|The {{heaviest}} load on his mind, {{after his}} conversation with the trader, lay in the foreseen necessity of breaking to his wife the arrangement contemplated,--meeting the importunities and opposition which he <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> have reason to encounter.|$|E
6000|$|This was {{something}} concrete. The boy <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> remember that comparison. [...] "Bring you anything else?" [...] he asked, admiring the young man's skill {{in getting the}} last flakes of the crust on his fork. The pie had now vanished.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>should</b> have <b>known,</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> have guessed, and now {{she hated}} him for his {{thoughts}} of her; she who had kept herself untainted {{in the midst of}} the worst corruption that ever infested a Court, whose purity of motives, whose upright judgments had procured her countless enemies amongst the imbecile and the infamous, she to be asked and begged to be loyal and to despise treachery! ...|$|R
60|$|The {{day that}} Blunt met his fall, the wooden tank {{in which the}} water had been poured every morning {{was found to have}} been taken away. The bachelors made a great show of indignation and inquiry. Who was it stole their tank? If they did but <b>know,</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> smart for it.|$|R
5|$|Daniel Trippett as Romeo, a brave, kind, and {{handsome}} Montague and Juliet's love interest. <b>He</b> <b>knows</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> not go near the Capulets, but he loves Juliet. It is {{revealed that he}} would not let anyone kidnap Juliet; this is first revealed in a shipwreck scene, when an octopus hypnotizes and tangles Juliet and challenges Romeo to a duel.|$|R
6000|$|... 'He--he--I won't tell him!' sobbed the child. 'He's a bad man--he tells stories. He said {{he would}} not hurt me--when he <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> most terribly. Papa said it was very wrong. Papa was quite angry--he called it deceiving, he did! I won't tell him!' ...|$|E
60|$|But {{the shadow}} would not stir, and Ned {{was obliged to}} mind. He did so very reluctantly, and scolded the shadow well as {{he went back to}} Polly; though all the time he felt he was doing right, and <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> be glad afterwards.|$|E
60|$|Harcourt demurred, {{as he did}} {{not wish}} to be called on imperiously to praise a woman of whom he <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> disapprove, and endeavoured to excuse himself from the journey. But Bertram persisted, and at last it was settled that he would go down.|$|E
2500|$|Secretary of State John Kerry said Snowden had [...] "damaged {{his country}} very significantly" [...] and [...] "hurt {{operational}} security" [...] by telling terrorists how to evade detection. [...] "The bottom line," [...] Kerry added, [...] "is {{this man has}} betrayed his country, sitting in Russia where he has taken refuge. You <b>know,</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> man up {{and come back to}} the United States." ...|$|R
60|$|I don't <b>know</b> how <b>he</b> <b>should</b> have had, {{for it was}} new {{enough to}} me. I passed that off, and brought Mr. Dick on the carpet.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, you're {{not going}} to leave me this morning--of all mornings?" [...] Philip did not quite <b>know</b> why <b>he</b> <b>should</b> not, but it did not matter.|$|R
60|$|Here {{they stopped}} for a day in luxurious quarters, and then Jack, after seeing his friend into the train on his way home, started to travel over the Semmering pass down to Trieste, where he <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> find no {{difficulty}} in obtaining a steamer to Constantinople.|$|E
60|$|When {{the young}} Lefferses {{came in to}} breakfast, the talk went on between these and the Marches; the Triscoes {{presently}} left the table, and Mrs. March rose soon after, eager for that discussion of their behavior which March <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> {{not be able to}} postpone.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have only}} got twenty minutes," [...] said he, {{looking at his}} watch. [...] "But, Susan, tell her what I have said to you. Goodbye." [...] And he put out his hand. He <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> see her again, but this had been his plan to get her hand in his.|$|E
5000|$|... 4. Of a Hermit {{who sought}} to <b>know</b> whom <b>he</b> <b>should</b> have for his {{companion}} in Paradise, and of the leap made by King Richard of England ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, sir, you are right. I {{know that}} Harry Merrycourt feels NOW {{that nothing can}} justify rebellion, and that <b>he</b> little <b>knew</b> whither <b>he</b> <b>should</b> be led.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, but don't exult; I hate {{people who}} exult. Jasper wants to <b>know</b> why <b>he</b> <b>should</b> mind her {{being talked about}} if she doesn't mind it herself.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Considering more intently {{she made}} no answer, and he then <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> have been {{adequately}} answered by her asking how often he himself had spoken of their terrible friend. Suddenly a brighter light broke in her face and an excited idea sprang to her lips in the appeal: “You have forgiven him?” ...|$|E
60|$|The prince {{took his}} leave of me the night before, for, {{as he told}} me, he <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> be met upon the road by several persons of quality, and perhaps by the princess herself; so we lay at two {{different}} inns that night, lest some should come quite to the place, as indeed it happened.|$|E
60|$|There {{was silence}} afterward, for Maxwell lay {{breathing}} unevenly {{with his eyes}} closed, and Dane was swayed in turn by satisfaction and a crushing sense of loss. He suffered from remorse as well. Maxwell dying had revealed a side of his nature his comrade now <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> have seen manifested in his actions if not in his words.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't <b>know</b> why <b>he</b> <b>should</b> {{be a small}} fish. No man {{has done}} better than he has; {{and if you want}} a man to stick to you--" ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> did not <b>know</b> why <b>he</b> <b>should</b> {{have made}} this speech to her, but {{apparently}} she did, and she said, [...] "You're always coming to my help, Mr. Verrian." ...|$|R
50|$|Amon: An Egyptian boy {{who seems}} to <b>know</b> more than <b>he</b> <b>should.</b>|$|R
60|$|He <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> {{go to see}} her again, {{according}} to her invitation. Those earnest men he read of, the saints, whom Sue, with gentle irreverence, called his demi-gods, would have shunned such encounters if they doubted their own strength. But he could not. He might fast and pray during the whole interval, but the human was more powerful in him than the Divine.|$|E
60|$|He almost {{expected}} that the goose would be waiting {{for him at the}} stable door when he opened it; but, since he <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> find his pet in 'the warm box he had made for him, he was not greatly disappointed at not seeing him ready for the journey. Besides, he had come an hour before he told Crippy he would be there, which was sufficient reason why the goose was not ready and anxious to start.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Crawley, you are intoxicated, as usual," [...] replied his wife. And {{the next}} morning, when the Rector woke, {{and called for}} small beer, she put him in mind of his promise to visit Sir Huddleston Fuddleston on Saturday, and as he <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> have a wet night, {{it was agreed that}} he might gallop back again in time for church on Sunday morning. Thus it will be seen that the parishioners of Crawley were equally happy in their Squire and in their Rector.|$|E
60|$|I {{asked how}} long {{he thought it would}} take. He said one week. I told him that in this voyage I would tell him all I <b>knew,</b> and <b>he</b> <b>should</b> tell me all <b>he</b> <b>knew,</b> to which <b>he</b> readily agreed.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't {{like him}} a bit. He gives himself airs {{because he is}} a lord, and is devilish ill-natured. I don't <b>know</b> why <b>he</b> <b>should</b> want to ride my horses.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't <b>know</b> why <b>he</b> <b>should</b> {{think it}} better;--but, of course, I will go if he bids me." [...] Mr. Greenwood had quite {{made up his}} mind {{that it would be better}} for him also that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> go.|$|R
