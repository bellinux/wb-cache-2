Collecting data from each (adult) <b>household</b> member, however, reduces response rates and increases costs. This talk will explore {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} procedures based on collecting data from a subset of <b>household</b> members (possibly just one), randomly selected. Data from the 1995 Nationwide Personal Transportation Survey will be used to evaluate the alternatives. 1. Background Trip production models, extensively used by transportation analysts, require <b>household</b> trip rates. Travel surveys have traditionally obtained the <b>household</b> trip rates by interviewing every adult member of the <b>household</b> about their trips. Older children and teenagers may also be interviewed. Data for other children in the <b>household</b> are obtained from an adult <b>household</b> member. Trip data must be obtained on most or all <b>household</b> members for the <b>household</b> to be useable. There are several drawbacks to trying to obtain trip data from each (adult) <b>household</b> member: reduced <b>household</b> response rates, higher costs, and more respondent burden.
