5|$|Another {{theory is}} that Madeleine, nearly four at the time, left the {{apartment}} by herself, perhaps to look <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>parents,</b> and was abducted by a passer-by or fell {{into one of the}} open construction sites nearby. This is widely regarded as unlikely. According to her mother, Madeleine would have had to open the unlocked patio doors, close the curtains behind her, close the door again, open and close the child gate {{at the top of the}} stairs, then open and close the gate leading to the street.|$|E

The screenplay was written by Keiko Nobumoto.|$|E
5|$|Valene's {{bitterness}} {{over her}} mother's indifference, {{and the subsequent}} loss of Lucy is not resolved until 1979 when she and Gary move to Knots Landing. Much of this early backstory is told through flashbacks in episodes of Knots Landing, and is only briefly referenced in Dallas. While working in a diner in 1978, Valene decided to wait for Lucy outside her school and they {{got to know each}} other. They stayed in contact with each other in secret for several months afterward. In the fall of 1978, Lucy arranges a reunion <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>parents.</b> Gary and Valene move back to Southfork for a short time, but their reunion is again undermined by J.R., who arranged for Gary to take charge of a failing company, hoping that the pressure would drive Gary away. Gary realized that he would fall off the wagon unless he left Southfork, so he departed. J.R. then turned on Valene, trying to bribe her, before ordering her to leave. In December 1979, Valene and Gary are reunited once more in Dallas, and get married for the second time. Gary's parents, Jock Ewing (Jim Davis) and Miss Ellie Ewing (Barbara Bel Geddes), as well as Gary's brother, Bobby (Patrick Duffy), and sister-in-law Pamela Barnes Ewing (Victoria Principal), attend the wedding. Shortly afterward, they move to California to live in a home that Miss Ellie had bought for them as a wedding gift. Valene also appears in the final episode of Dallas during J.R.'s dream, which showed how things would have turned out had J.R. never existed. In this dream, Val meets Gary for the first time when they are both middle aged and they take a liking to each other, highlighting the idea that Gary and Val were always destined to end up together one way or another.|$|E

25|$|Sergey Kavtaradze {{was later}} {{moved to a}} prison in Tbilisi, but brought back to Moscow in February 1939. The couple were {{suddenly}} released in late 1939, and were first allowed {{to see each other}} in Beria's Moscow apartment. British historian Simon Sebag Montefiore argues that this was a delayed consequence of a letter Stalin received in 1936: in it, the couple's eleven-year-old daughter, Maya, begged <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>parents</b> to be allowed to live. The Kavtaradzes (including Maya, who was allowed to leave Tbilisi and transported to Moscow) moved into a hotel, and then allowed to settle in a communal apartment. In what was an unprecedented gesture, Stalin and Beria paid them a visit in their new home.|$|E
25|$|RolePlay was {{the play}} written as the afterthought, but {{turned out to}} be the most {{successful}} play of the three. The play centres on a dinner party held by Justin Lazenby and Julie-Ann Jobson, where they intend to announce their engagement. Before the dinner begins, there are already signs of tension: Julie-Ann gets overly frantic about making the meal perfect <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>parents</b> (her father, it later turns out, is a right-wing bigot), and Justin's alcoholic mother is clearly going to arrive paralytic. However, the biggest complication turns out to be when Paige Petite climbs onto the balcony, on the run from her violent boyfriend. Trapped in the flat by her minder, Justin and Julie-Ann are forced to keep up appearances during the dinner whilst the stand-off is played out.|$|E

25|$|Chef began cooking as a {{child and}} cooks <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>parents</b> still when she goes to visit them. Her {{favorite}} dishes are healthy shakes and dishes involving noodles, specifically udon, which she makes from scratch. In January 2012, a note accompanying the latest video for Cooking with Dog stated that Chef had sustained severe injuries from a bicycle accident in Tokyo. She was rushed to a nearby intensive care unit and was in stable condition. The news resulted in a flood of well-wishes from viewers in the video's comments section. Updates on Chef's situation were provided in subsequent episodes, as Chef entered physical therapy for her injuries, which required a head and neck brace, and eventually returned to film more episodes. While she was still in recovery, Cooking with Dog featured a close acquaintance of Chef's named Shin Kohama (小濱 晋), an actor in the theater troupe Jimo-Koyo.|$|E
25|$|Pamela Jelimo {{was born}} in Kiptamok village, Nandi District, Rift Valley Province. Her mother, Esther Cheptoo Keter, was a {{promising}} 200 metres and 400 metres runner, but the customs of the Nandi tribe meant that as the last-born daughter she could not marry and had to care <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>parents</b> in their old age. However, she was allowed to bear children to different men; thus, Jelimo was raised by her mother {{in a family of}} three brothers and six sisters. Jelimo began running in 2003, aged 13, at Koyo Secondary in the Kaptumo division, near Kapsabet. She quickly established herself as an accomplished athlete, winning at schools' championships in the 100 metres, 200m, 400m, 800 metres, 400 metres hurdles and heptathlon. Her high school games teacher Philip Ng'eno remarked that she used to compete with the boys in sprint events as the girls did not provide the competition she needed.|$|E
25|$|Mireille {{spent all}} of 1966 and 1967 touring. It was then, during a car ride to another concert, that Stark advised Mireille that she was finally debt free, and worth {{more than a million}} francs ($200k USD in 1967). She had always prayed that she could get her family out of poverty, but the touring and singing were much more {{important}} at the time. In her autobiography, she stated her first major purchases were a vehicle for her father's business and a large home <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>parents</b> and siblings. Most importantly, she had a telephone installed for the family, so her parents no longer {{had to go to the}} pharmacy to talk to her while she was in Paris. Her one regret, was that she was unable to see her grandmother Germaine in the hospital before she died because of all the tour contracts.|$|E

At the same time, David and Mary Margaret, {{who are now}} under King Arthur's command, convince Regina {{to hand over the}} dagger to Arthur, unaware that moments after, Regina took the two to the treestump where it was hidden. Emma was waiting <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>parents</b> by placing a freezing spell on them. She tells Regina about Arthur using Mary Margaret and David in order to unite Excalibur with the dagger and then kill Merlin, which is why Emma wants a skeptical Regina to work with her to free the sorcerer, even though Regina is not convinced of Emma's claim, believing that Emma's darkness is telling Emma this, which Emma disputes by saying it's true and that dark magic is the answer. Regina asks how Emma knew her parents were under the spell, and she shows Regina the dreamcatcher. Regina tells Emma that the device catches more than dreams because it's dark magic and dangerous, as Emma believes that her dark magic is stronger than she thought.|$|E
