5|$|While {{the popular}} {{consensus}} is that olfaction {{is very important for}} hunting, two studies that experimentally investigated the role of olfactory, auditory, and visual cues found that visual cues are the most important ones for <b>hunting</b> <b>in</b> red foxes and coyotes.|$|E
5|$|Although no general {{arbitration}} {{treaty was}} entered into, Taft's administration settled several disputes with Great Britain by peaceful means, often involving arbitration. These included {{a settlement of}} the boundary between Maine and New Brunswick, a long-running dispute over seal <b>hunting</b> <b>in</b> the Bering Sea that also involved Japan, and a similar disagreement regarding fishing off Newfoundland. The sealing convention remained in force until abrogated by Japan in 1940.|$|E

5|$|As {{with other}} {{swallows}}, both martins feed on flying insects, <b>hunting</b> <b>in</b> single-species groups or with other swallows and swifts. They feed low over {{a variety of}} open habitats or woodland. Prey items recorded for the Mascarene martin include scarab, click and other beetles, Hemiptera and flying ants, and Brazza's martins will take termites. In eastern Africa, areas deforested by logging or conversion to agriculture are used for hunting by Brazza's martins.|$|E
5|$|Blaine’s {{earliest}} expressions in {{the foreign}} policy sphere were those of a reactionary Anglophobe, {{but by the end}} of his career his relationship with the United Kingdom had become more moderate and nuanced. A dispute over seal <b>hunting</b> <b>in</b> the waters off Alaska was the cause of Blaine’s first interaction with Britain as Harrison’s Secretary of State. A law passed in 1889 required Harrison to ban seal <b>hunting</b> <b>in</b> Alaskan waters, but Canadian fishermen believed they had the right to continue fishing there. Soon thereafter, the United States Navy seized several Canadian ships near the Pribilof Islands. Blaine entered into negotiations with Britain and the two nations agreed to submit the dispute to arbitration by a neutral tribunal. Blaine was no longer in office when the tribunal began its work, but the result was to allow the hunting once more, albeit with some regulation, and to require the United States to pay damages of $473,151. Ultimately, the nations signed the North Pacific Fur Seal Convention of 1911, which outlawed open-water seal hunting.|$|E
5|$|Eschrichtiids {{have one}} living member: the grey whale. They are bottom feeders, mainly eating {{crustaceans}} and benthic invertebrates. They feed by turning {{on their sides}} and taking in water mixed with sediment, which is then expelled through the baleen, leaving their prey trapped inside. This is an efficient method of <b>hunting,</b> <b>in</b> which the whale has no major competitors.|$|E
50|$|Although edible, swans are not <b>hunted</b> <b>in</b> many Western {{cultures}} due {{to hunting}} regulations, and swans were historically a royal prerogative. Swans are <b>hunted</b> <b>in</b> the Arctic regions.|$|R

5|$|Human {{activities}} such as encroachment of settlements, agriculture, and <b>hunting</b> <b>in</b> rural areas {{poses a threat to}} the Natal red rock hare, due to which its population is decreasing. Since the 1900s, more than 21% to 50% of its habitat has been destroyed, which is predicted to remain between 21% and 50% till 2022, decreasing its population by 20% or more by then.|$|E
5|$|Impact on hunting: Semiautomatic rifles {{have been}} purposefully used for <b>hunting</b> <b>in</b> the Czech Republic {{since at least}} 1946 and they are {{especially}} effective and popular in curbing wild boar overpopulation {{that is responsible for}} large number of car accidents as well as damage to agriculture. Banning of these firearms would likely lead to increase of car accidents due to collisions with wild animals and consequent increase in number of injuries and fatalities.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{holders of}} C (hunting) license may too {{transport}} their firearms only {{to and from}} the areas designated for <b>hunting</b> <b>in</b> a manner that excludes their immediate use. In case that they use public transportation, the firearm must also be transported in a closed container, otherwise it may be transported (carried unloaded) openly.|$|E

5|$|Melbourne Castle was {{a medieval}} castle in Melbourne, Derbyshire. It {{was built on}} the site of an earlier royal manor house that had {{provided}} accommodation for noblemen <b>hunting</b> <b>in</b> a nearby royal park in the reign of King John. Construction of the castle was started in 1311 by Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster, and continued until 1322, shortly before his execution, but the work was never fully completed.|$|E
5|$|The Hawaiian {{monk seal}} {{has the lowest}} level of genetic {{variability}} among the 18 pinniped species, allegedly due to a population bottleneck caused by intense <b>hunting</b> <b>in</b> the 19th century. This limited genetic variability reduces the species's ability to adapt to environmental pressures and limits natural selection thus increasing their risk of extinction. Given the monk seal's small population, the effects of disease could be disastrous.|$|E
5|$|The Picardy Spaniel is a docile {{breed of}} dog and {{is fond of}} playing with {{children}} and bonds well with their master. It is described as having a gentle sociable nature, possessing a good character and being relatively easy to train. In France, the breed is used for <b>hunting</b> <b>in</b> wooded areas for Pheasants, and in swamps for Snipes. However {{it can also be}} used for hunting ducks, hares and rabbits. The breed excels at <b>hunting</b> <b>in</b> marshes and will not hesitate to jump into water. It can also adequately serve as a retriever should it be required. The dog is content {{with a small amount of}} space and could suit life in the city, but also loves open spaces.|$|E

5|$|The breed {{has been}} used to hunt {{pheasant}} and partridge, in both small packs and alone. It is well-suited for work in upland <b>hunting</b> <b>in</b> dense cover, and although the Clumber is rather slow in the field compared to other spaniels, it is a quiet worker with a fine nose and good stamina. The broad muzzle of the breed allows it to retrieve a variety of game.|$|E

5|$|Whale {{morphology}} shows {{a number}} of examples of convergent evolution, the most obvious being the streamlined fish-like body shape.
