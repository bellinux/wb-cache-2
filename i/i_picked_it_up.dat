500|$|While touring rigorously {{in support}} of Happiness... in mid-2000, Mike Turner came across The Age of Spiritual Machines, a 1999 book by {{inventor}} and futurist Ray Kurzweil. [...] "I happened to be lucky enough to discover a really shiny book cover in a book store." [...] Turner stated, [...] "I wish I could say it was like, 'Well, I've been on this intellectual quest.' <b>I</b> <b>picked</b> <b>it</b> <b>up,</b> read it and went mental." [...] Becoming fascinated by the futuristic ideology of the book, he proceeded {{to share it with}} the other band members, reading them passages on their tour bus over the next several months.|$|E
2500|$|The BPD's {{handling}} {{of this incident}} has been criticized by some Boston residents and justified by others: [...] "We all thought it was pretty funny," [...] said one student. [...] "The majority of us recognize {{the difference between a}} bomb and a Lite-Brite," [...] said another. One resident said that the police response was [...] "silly and insane," [...] and that [...] "We’re the laughing stock." [...] Another resident said that the device [...] "looked like a bomb. <b>I</b> <b>picked</b> <b>it</b> <b>up,</b> pulled the tape off it, and there were batteries, two on the top and three on the bottom." [...] The same devices had been distributed in nine other cities across the USA without provoking a similar reaction. The United States Department of Homeland Security praised Boston authorities [...] "for sharing their knowledge quickly with Washington officials and the public." ...|$|E
2500|$|On September 13, 1920, Pickford {{gave his}} account of that night to the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner:We arrived back at the Ritz hotel at about 3 o'clock in the morning. I had already booked {{airplane}} seats for London. We were going Sunday morning. Both of us were tired out. We both had been drinking a little. I insisted that we had better not pack then, but rather get up early before our trip and do it then. I went to bed immediately. She fussed around and wrote a note to her mother. ... She was in the bathroom.Suddenly she shrieked: 'My God.' I jumped out of bed, rushed toward her and caught her in my arms. She cried to me {{to find out what}} was in the bottle. <b>I</b> <b>picked</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> and read: 'Poison.' It was a toilet solution and the label was in French. I realized what she had done and sent for the doctor. Meanwhile, I forced her to drink water in order to make her vomit. She screamed, 'O, my God, I'm poisoned.' I forced the whites of eggs down her throat, hoping to offset the poison. The doctor came. He pumped her stomach three times while I held Olive.Nine o'clock in the morning I got her to the Neuilly Hospital, where Doctors Choate and Wharton took charge of her. They told me she had swallowed bichloride of mercury in an alcoholic solution, which is ten times worse than tablets. She didn't want to die. She took the poison by mistake. We both loved each other since the day we married. The fact that we were separated months at a time made no difference in our affection for each other. She even was conscious enough the day before she died to ask the nurse to come to America with her until she had fully recovered, having no thought she would die.She kept continually calling for me. I was beside her day and night until her death. The physicians held out hope for her until the last moment, until they found her kidneys paralyzed. Then they lost hope. But the doctors told me she had fought harder than any patient they ever had. She held onto her life as only one case in fifty. She seemed stronger the last two days. She was conscious, and said she would get better and go home to her mother. 'It's all a mistake, darling Jack,' she said. But I knew she was dying.She was kept alive only by hypodermic injections during the last twelve hours. I was the last one she recognized. I watched her eyes glaze and realized she was dying. I asked her how she was feeling and she answered: 'Pretty weak, but I'll be all right in a little while, don't worry, darling.' Those were her last words. I held her in my arms and she died an hour later. Owen Moore was at her bedside. All stories and rumors of wild parties and cocaine and domestic fights since we left New York are untrue.|$|E

5000|$|The Telecaster was {{important}} {{in the evolution of}} country, electric blues, funk, rock and roll, and other forms of popular music. Its solid construction let guitarists play loudly as a lead instrument, with long sustain if desired. It produced less of the uncontrolled, whistling, 'hard' feedback ('microphonic feedback') that hollowbodied instruments tend to produce at volume (different from the controllable feedback later explored by Pete Townshend and countless other players). Even though the Telecaster is {{more than half a century}} old, and more sophisticated designs have appeared since the early 1950s (including Fender's own Stratocaster), the Telecaster remains in production. There have been numerous variations and modifications, but a model with something close to the original features has always been available.In a recent article for Music Aficionado, Alex Lifeson of Rush wrote [...] "I bought a reissue 1959 Telecaster back in 1981, and that guitar has since become my primary writing guitar for all of these years, especially for the electric work. Every time <b>I</b> <b>pick</b> <b>it</b> <b>up,</b> <b>it</b> feels like an old friend. I took all of the finish off of the neck, so it’s raw wood, and I feel very connected to it when I’m playing it. That is my number-one “go to” for writing new music." ...|$|R

And that woman, that young woman, all alone on the trail, there in the snow, she take out one thousand dollars, in greenbacks, and she put them in my hand. I look at money, I look at her. What can I say? I say, 'No, my canoe very small. There is no room for outfit.' She laugh. She says, 'I am great traveller. This is my outfit.' She kick one small pack in the snow. It is two fur robes, canvas outside, some woman's clothes inside. <b>I</b> <b>pick</b> <b>it</b> <b>up.</b> Maybe thirty-five pounds. I am surprised. She take it away from me.
