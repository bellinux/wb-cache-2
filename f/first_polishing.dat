Soil core samples were freeze-dried and impregnated with a resin [mixed polyester resin A:polyester resin B (Maruto) =  8 : 2 1000  mL and benzoyl peroxide 10  mL]. Hardened samples were cut to smaller pieces of approximately 50  ×  50  ×  7  mm 3 using a cutting machine (MC- 32, Maruto) to obtain thin vertical sections of soil. The samples were ground using an abrasive (C 3000, Maruto) (<b>first</b> <b>polishing)</b> and bonded onto a glass slide with an epoxy resin. Samples were cut again and {{ground to a}} thickness of 30  µm using an automatic polishing machine, followed by manual polishing with an abrasive (C 400 and C 3000, Maruto) (second polishing). We described the soil micromorphology according to the Handbook for Soil Thin Section Description (Bullock et al. 1985) based on observations using a polarizing microscope (BH- 2, Olympus). The size threshold between coarse and fine materials (the C/F concept) was 10  µm, and the C/F concept and abundance of voids were determined under plane-polarized light.|$|E

40|$|Conventional manual {{polishing}} is {{the most}} common finishing process step in an otherwise completely automated process chain for free formed dies and moulds made of steel. As constant process parameters cannot be provided by the worker, manual polishing carefully approaches the goal to obtain fine surfaces down to 5 nm Ra and form accuracies better than 1 m {{at the same time and}} requires up to 30 minutes per square centimetre. Therefore, a manual process cannot be implemented efficiently in terms of economic aspects. For steel, ultra precision diamond machining cannot be applied because of high diamond tool wear. The material removal of processes based on indefined cutting edges such as grinding, lapping and polishing are mainly driven by the combination of materials and the process parameters cutting speed, contact pressure and specific duration [1]. In order to perform a deterministic fine machining, thus controlling and keeping these parameters constant is essential. Fu rthermore, the investigation on fine machining of steel surfaces identified micro chipping as most responsible for material removal [2]. For this reason, a modular force controlled machining system, which is guided by a 6 -axis robot arm, was developed at Fraunhofer IPT. The machine can perform both rotational and oscillating removal motions and applies an additional rotation for multidirectional surface treatment. With regard to <b>first</b> <b>polishing</b> attempts the system enables the automated fine machining down to 10 nm Ra starting with 400 nm Ra in less than 5 minutes per square centimetre...|$|E
40|$|Hence, several special {{transformation}}s in this course can be obtained: 1 � � The transformation of single polygon 2 � � The transformation of two polygons 3 � � The displacement of polygons 4 � � The identification and classification of points 3. 0 The automatic synthesis technique of information We must clarify some basic definitions {{used throughout the}} work at first. In the topological data architecture, the points are independent; they are connected {{with each other to}} compose a line. A line is formed by joining a series of points, begins with the first node, and ends with the last node. A chain is a path on one or more polygons, is also called an arc or a side. Node is the intersection or the end point of lines or chains. A polygon is constituted by an outer ring and null or more inner rings; a ring is composed of one or more chains. Thus {{it can be seen that}} the essential geometric architecture of topological data is line, so lines should be synthesized at <b>first.</b> <b>Polishing</b> lines is processed after synthesizing the lines, and then checked the consistency. We will discuss the variance of topological data in the case of several special changes in protraction synthesis. 3. 1 The transformation of single polygon Transform the correlative lines of this polygon. Given a SHAPE C (s) (u (s), v (s)) polygon i = i i, obtain a polygon S*(s,t) via these lines, t is the parameter of the SHAPE polygon, then we have S * (s, t) = (U(s, t), V(s, t)) Where, U...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:This pape r {{discusses}} a nanometer level precision alignment technique {{as applied}} to highly eff icient micro optics packaging using heat curable adhesives. To achieve a fast curing pro cess, we deposi t microw ave energy to the spot w here opt ical bonding is desi red. Conventional microw ave heating technique, how ever, as w e know it, relies on large mass rat io between the epoxy and the components to be bonded. In order to improve the efficiency of heat abso rption by the t iny amount of adhesive used fo r micro optics packaging, we pre-process the components to be bonded, by <b>first</b> <b>polishing</b> the bonding surfaces and then deposi ting a very thin layer of metalized f ilm on them. An infrared(IR) remote temperature senso r is utilized to monito r {{the temperature of the}} adhesive (to prevent over heating). A n automated sy stem can then adjust the pow er output of the microw ave so that a fairly constant curing temperature can be maintained. During the fast curing process, pre-alignment o f micro opt ics, such as fiber optic coupler, w ill inevitably suffer minor misalignment due to non-uniform heating of the components. To compensate for this side-ef fect, we have developed a real time alignment monito ring and feedback contro lled system. As an example to packag ing fiber couplers, such a sy stem can moni to r the insertion loss(IL) o f a component in real time while the adhesive is being cured by the microw ave energy. A 3 -dimensional piezo-elect ric t ransducer (PZT) i s employed to achieve the x-, y-, and z-axis alignment. A level of 10 nanometer alignment can be readi ly achieved which in turn leads to an IL sensit ivity of as smal l as 0. 004 dB. An improvement of a packaging ef ficiency as high as 150 times has been demonst rated, compared to conventional blind oven curing process. Yield of micro optics packaging is also expected to increase due to the use o f real time alignment pro cess.
