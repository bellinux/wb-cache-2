The nine-by-nine grid has led some scholars {{to suggest that the}} plan is based on the cosmological belief that the Earth is a square divided into nine sections.  This structure is reproduced by the magic <b>square,</b> a <b>tool</b> <b>for</b> divination.|$|R
40|$|The rate {{of energy}} {{dissipation}} in solutions of the body-forced 3 -d incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is rigorously estimated {{with a focus}} on its dependence {{on the nature of the}} <b>driving</b> force. <b>For</b> <b>square</b> integrable body forces the high Reynolds number (low viscosity) upper bound on the dissipation is independent of the viscosity, consistent with the existence of a conventional turbulent energy cascade. On the other hand when the body force is not square integrable, i. e., when the Fourier spectrum of the force decays sufficiently slowly at high wavenumbers, there is significant direct driving at a broad range of spatial scales. Then the upper limit for the dissipation rate may diverge at high Reynolds numbers, consistent with recent experimental and computational studies of "fractal-forced'' turbulence.

50|$|The {{general design}} of a single {{puddling}} furnace is as follows. The footprint of the furnace was 3.3 - 3.6 m long, 1.5 - 2.1 m wide (depending on hearth size) and 1.5 m tall. The outer walls were 23 cm thick and made of typical brick and then covered by cast iron plates. Wrought iron square bars, called cross binders, are run through {{the roof of the}} furnace and bolted to the cast iron plates to keep the roof from collapsing. The chimney was 9 - 12 m tall and 40 cm square. There would be a small work hole allowing access to the fire, and a work door allowing access to the hearth. The average work door was 55 cm wide by 68 cm tall, lined with firebricks on the inside and with a small <b>square</b> work hole <b>for</b> <b>tools.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of a driven pendulum at arbitrary angles and signals is studied using the lagrangian formalism and the effective potential method. We make a general {{discussion of the}} problem and consider three particular <b>driving</b> signals: sinusoidal, <b>square</b> and triangular. Was found that the cut off frequency, which determines the transition between the stability and nonstability regions depends on the type of signal used. <b>For</b> <b>square</b> <b>driving</b> the lower bound is minimum, while for the triangular drive is a maximum, the usual case of sinusoidal driving was found between the previous ones...|$|R

Although he was not as quick scoring in the first test, he moved onto 35 not out by the close, with Merv Hughes once again by his side not out on 2. Australia had ground out runs throughout a slow second day to end on 276 for 6, still ten runs behind England's first innings score.|$|R

40|$|The basic {{function}} of a comparator is to determine whether an input voltage is higher or lower than a reference voltage and to set the output {{to one of two}} levels. Comparators have a wide range of uses, such as 1 -bit analog-to-digital conversion, polarity identification, switch <b>driving,</b> <b>square</b> or triangular wave generation, pulse edge generation, voltage detectors, and battery management. Analog Devices is proud to offer an exciting new portfolio of high speed and low power comparators to meet your most demanding applications. Combining ADI’s comparators with other ADI components creates superior solutions, such as those highlighted in the application matrix below.
