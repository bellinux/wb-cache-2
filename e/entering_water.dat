25|$|The BMD-3 {{is fully}} amphibious and is {{propelled}} by two water jets mounted one {{on either side}} {{at the rear of}} the vehicle, allowing the vehicle to achieve speeds of up to 10km/h in the water and in a sea state of up to three. A snorkel is erected from the driver's position and a trim vane is erected at the front of the vehicle when <b>entering</b> <b>water</b> and the automatic bilge pump is turned on. Unlike its predecessors, the BMD-3 can be airdropped with its all its crews and passengers inside the vehicle, allowing combat engagement to be immediate after landing. For the BMD-1 and BMD-2, the crew would be dropped separately, which required additional time to marry up with their fighting vehicle.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are many}} ways that the soil food web is an {{integral}} part of landscape processes. Soil organisms decompose organic compounds, including manure, plant residues, and pesticides, preventing them from <b>entering</b> <b>water</b> and becoming pollutants. [...] They sequester nitrogen and other nutrients that might otherwise enter groundwater, and they fix nitrogen from the atmosphere, making it available to plants. [...] Many organisms enhance soil aggregation and porosity, thus increasing infiltration and reducing surface runoff. [...] Soil organisms prey on crop pests and are food for above-ground animals.|$|E
2500|$|Nutrient source {{apportionment}} is used {{to estimate}} the nutrient load from various sectors <b>entering</b> <b>water</b> bodies, following attenuation or treatment. Agriculture is typically the principal source of nitrogen in water bodies in Europe, whereas in many countries households and industries {{tend to be the}} dominant contributors of phosphorus. Where water quality is impacted by excess nutrients, load source apportionment models can support the proportional and pragmatic management of water resources by identifying the pollution sources. There are two broad approaches to load apportionment modelling, (i) load-orientated approaches which apportion origin based on in-stream monitoring data and (ii) source-orientated approaches where amounts of diffuse, or nonpoint source pollution, emissions are calculated using models typically based on export coefficients from catchments with similar characteristics. For example, the Source Load Apportionment Model (SLAM) takes the latter approach, estimating the relative contribution of sources of nitrogen and phosphorus to surface waters in Irish catchments without in-stream monitoring data by integrating information on point discharges (urban wastewater, industry and septic tank systems), diffuse sources (pasture, arable, forestry, etc.), and catchment data, including hydrogeological characteristics.|$|E

50|$|Snell's window (also called Snell's circle or optical man-hole) is a {{phenomenon}} by which an underwater viewer sees everything above the surface through a cone of light of width of about 96 degrees.

50|$|Turbidity in {{open water}} {{may be caused}} by growth of phytoplankton.

Certain industries such as quarrying, mining and coal recovery can generate very high levels of turbidity from colloidal rock particles.|$|E
50|$|The {{vehicle is}} fully amphibious, a trim board is raised {{at the front}} of the vehicle before {{entering}} the water to improve vehicle's stability and displacement in water and prevent the water from flooding the bow.
