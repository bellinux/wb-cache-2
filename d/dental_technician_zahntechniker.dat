If the patient still has remaining natural teeth, they see the dentist first to check those remaining teeth, the Dentist then refers them to the Clinical <b>Dental</b> <b>Technician</b> for the provision of partial dentures.

30|$|Education of <b>dental</b> <b>technicians</b> {{varies by}} country, {{and there are}} a variety of means by which {{personnel}} master fabrication knowledge and skills. For example, a survey of <b>dental</b> <b>technicians</b> in the UK conducted by Bower et al.

By contrast, certified <b>dental</b> <b>technicians</b> of JSOI are required to belong to an academic society and to participate in society meetings and certification courses to maintain their credentials. Subscription to JSOI’s journal is an example of the advantages of membership for continuing education.|$|R

40|$|Aims: To compare {{wage earner}} <b>dental</b> <b>technicians</b> with non-exposed {{salaried}} subjects for the preva-lence of respiratory symptoms and function, and {{chest x ray}} abnormalities. Methods: A total of 134 <b>dental</b> <b>technicians</b> and 131 non-exposed subjects participated. A medical and an occupational questionnaire were filled in to evaluate the prevalence of respiratory symptoms and occupational exposures. Subjects underwent respiratory tests and chest x ray examination. Results: Mean age of the <b>dental</b> <b>technicians</b> was 36. 6 years with a mean duration of dental work of 16. 5 years. There was a significant risk of cough (day and night) and usual phlegm in dental techni-cians. Respiratory function parameters were lower in <b>dental</b> <b>technicians</b> with {{a significant difference between}} exposed and non-exposed groups for % FVC (forced vital capacity), % FEF 25 (forced mid expiratory flow), and % FEF 50. The prevalence of small opacities increased with age. Small opacities were significantly related to an exposure to asbestos in the past. Conclusions: Our young population of <b>dental</b> <b>technicians</b> is at risk of respiratory morbidity. They should benefit from adequate technical prevention measures. <b>Dental</b> <b>technicians</b> are exposed to dust and vapour duringthe manufacture of dental prostheses from the negativeimpression of the patient’s teeth obtained by the dentist.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} with transmission electron microscopy to find whether bronchoalveolar lavage could be used to identify subjects with occupational exposure to mineral particles. Non-fibrous mineral particles in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from 46 <b>dental</b> <b>technicians</b> and 41 white collar controls with lung diseases but free from occupational exposure to dusts were analysed. The total particle concentration in BAL fluid was significantly higher in <b>dental</b> <b>technicians</b> than in controls (12. 18 x 10 (5) particles/ml of BAL fluid, v 2. 03 x 10 (5) particles/ml, p < 0. 001). <b>Dental</b> <b>technicians</b> had significantly more crystalline silica, aluminium, and alloys containing nickel and chromium. There was a non-significant twofold increase of total particle concentration in the lungs of <b>dental</b> <b>technicians</b> who were smokers compared with non-smokers. The results strongly support the use of BAL fluid analysis to assess dust accumulation in workers in heavily exposed occupations such as <b>dental</b> <b>technicians.</b> This is a valid method to evaluate occupational exposure to non-fibrous mineral particles, and may be useful to determine the occupational aetiology of some respiratory diseases...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Occupational {{and chronic}} {{exposure}} to solvents and metals {{is considered a}} possible risk factor for Parkinson's disease and essential tremor. While manufacturing <b>dental</b> prostheses, <b>dental</b> <b>technicians</b> are exposed to numerous chemicals that contain toxins known to affect the central nervous system, such as solvents (which contain n-hexane in particular) and metals (which contain mercury, iron, chromium, cobalt and nickel). Methods We performed an epidemiological and clinical study on all 27 <b>dental</b> <b>technicians</b> working in a school for <b>dental</b> <b>technicians.</b> We asked all the technicians to fill in a self-administered questionnaire on extrapyramidal symptoms, and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), a self-administered screening instrument, to detect any psychiatric disorders. Moreover, we invited all 27 <b>dental</b> <b>technicians</b> to undergo a neurological examination and provide a detailed occupational history in our clinic. Results Of the 14 subjects who underwent the neurological examination, four had postural tremor and one had a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. Conclusion We found a high prevalence of extrapyramidal signs and symptoms in this group of male <b>dental</b> <b>technicians</b> working in a state technical high school in Rome. We believe that this finding {{may be due to}} the presence of toxins in the dental technician's work. </p...|$|R

40|$|From the {{registry}} of self employed workers living in Paris, {{a group of}} 105 <b>dental</b> <b>technicians</b> was studied to evaluate occupational exposure, to determine respiratory manifestations, and to investigate immune disturbances. Seventy one <b>dental</b> <b>technicians</b> (age range 43 - 68 : group D), 34 <b>dental</b> <b>technicians</b> younger than 43 or older than 68 (group d), and 68 control workers (age range 43 - 66 : group C) were investigated. The demographic characteristics and the smoking habits of the groups D and C did not differ significantly. The <b>dental</b> <b>technicians</b> often worked alone (43. 7 %) or in small laboratories without adequate dust control. The mean duration of their exposure was long (group D 34. 0 (SD 8. 4) years). The prevalence of respiratory symptoms did not differ between groups D and C except for the occurrence of increased cough and phlegm lasting for three weeks or more {{over the past three}} years (group D 16. 9 %, group C 2. 9 %, p < 0. 007). The effect of cigarette smoking on respiratory symptoms and lung function was obvious. All mean values of lung function for <b>dental</b> <b>technicians</b> and controls were within normal limits. Significant decreases in all mean lung function values were found among smokers by comparison with non-smokers, however, and a positive interaction with occupational exposure was established. The x ray films of <b>dental</b> <b>technicians</b> (n = 102, groups D and d) were read independently by four readers and recorded according to the International Labour Office classification of pneumoconioses. The prevalence of small opacities greater than 1 / 0 was 11. 8 % with a significant increase with duration of exposure. The prevalence among <b>dental</b> <b>technicians</b> with 30 years or exposure or more was significantly higher (22. 2 %) than those with less than 30 years (3. 5, p < 0. 004). The prevalence of autoantibodies (rheumatoid factors, antinuclear antibodies, and antihistone antibodies) was not significantly different in the groups D and C. When positive, autoantibodies only occurred at low concentrations. This finding contrasts with previous reports on the occurrence of autoantibodies and even of connective tissue diseases in <b>dental</b> <b>technicians.</b> In conclusion, the study confirms an increased risk of pneumoconiosis among <b>dental</b> <b>technicians.</b> Moreover, there may be other lung disorders such as impairment of lung function especially in association with cigarette smoking...|$|R

50|$|The {{association}} began {{life as the}} <b>Dental</b> <b>Technicians</b> Education and Training Advisory Board (DTETAB) and {{was established}} by the General Dental Council (GDC). The remit of DTETAB was to review and make recommendations about the education and training of <b>dental</b> <b>technicians,</b> the suitability of that training and how it would fit {{with the demands of}} providing dental services. The other main role for DTETAB was maintaining a Voluntary Register of <b>Dental</b> <b>Technicians,</b> which served as the precursor to the GDC statutory register. The inaugural meeting of the Board took place in January 1986 and was chaired by Margaret Seward (later Dame Margaret Seward). The GDC was only actively involved for the first three years and DTETAB became an independent professional body in 1989 with Colin Lee, a <b>dental</b> <b>technician</b> and laboratory owner from north west England, as chairman.
