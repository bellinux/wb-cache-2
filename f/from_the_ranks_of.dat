5|$|All of the Irish kingdoms {{had their}} own kings but were {{nominally}} subject to the High King. The High King was drawn <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ranks</b> <b>of</b> the provincial kings and ruled also the royal kingdom of Meath, with a ceremonial capital at the Hill of Tara. The concept didn't become a political reality until the Viking Age and even then was not a consistent one. Ireland did have a culturally unifying rule of law: the early written judicial system, the Brehon Laws, administered by a professional class of jurists known as the brehons.|$|E
5|$|Delayed by {{the late}} arrival of the York garrison, it was late evening before the Royalists were fully deployed. A flurry of rain showers and the discouragement of Newcastle and Eythin persuaded Rupert to delay his attack until the next day. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>ranks</b> <b>of</b> the allied army {{he could hear the}} singing of psalms. As the Royalist troops broke ranks for their supper, Leven noted the lack of {{preparation}} among his opponents and ordered his men to attack at or shortly after 7:30pm, just as a thunderstorm broke out over the moor.|$|E

5|$|Estimates of the {{strength}} of the Polish Legions also vary and it is believed that between 20,000 and 30,000 men served in the Legions' ranks at any one time over the course of their existence. The WIEM Encyklopedia estimate is 21,000 for the period up to 1803. Davies suggests 25,000 for the period of up to 1802–1803, as does Magosci et al. Bideleux and Jeffries offer an estimate of up to 30,000 for the period up to 1801. Most of the soldiers came <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ranks</b> <b>of</b> the peasantry, with only about 10 percent being drawn from the nobility.|$|E
5|$|Most pre-war {{officers}} {{came from}} families with military connections, the gentry or the peerage; {{a public school}} education was almost essential. In 1913, about 2% of regular officers had been promoted from the ranks. The officer corps, during the war, consisted of regular officers from the peacetime army, officers who had been granted permanent commissions during the war, officers who had been granted temporary commissions {{for the duration of}} the war, territorial army officers commissioned during peacetime, officers commissioned <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ranks</b> <b>of</b> the pre-war regular and territorial army and temporary officers commissioned from the ranks {{for the duration of the}} war alone.|$|E

Among the many guest performers have been Maria Callas, Plácido Domingo, Kirsten Flagstad, Hans Hotter, Birgit Nilsson, Luciano Pavarotti and Elisabeth Schwarzkopf.

5|$|After {{spending}} {{years as}} a political hostage in Thebes, PhilipII sought to imitate the Greek example of martial exercises and the issuing of standard equipment for citizen soldiery, and succeeded in transforming the Macedonian army from a levied force of unprofessional farmers into a well-trained, professional army. PhilipII adopted some of the military tactics of his enemies, such as the embolon (flying wedge) cavalry formation of the Scythians. His infantry wielded peltai shields that replaced the earlier hoplon-style shield, were equipped with protective helmets, greaves, and either cuirass breastplates or kotthybos stomach bands, and armed with sarissa pikes and a dagger as a secondary weapon. The elite hypaspistai infantry, composed of handpicked men <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ranks</b> <b>of</b> the pezhetairoi, were formed {{during the reign of}} PhilipII and saw continued use during the reign of Alexander the Great. PhilipII was also responsible for the establishment of the royal bodyguards (somatophylakes).|$|E
5|$|Following the {{deployment}} of the AIF a reinforcement system was used to replace wastage. Reinforcements received training in Australia before sailing as drafts and joining their assigned units at the front. To provide officer reinforcements, a series of AIF officer schools, such as that at Broadmeadows, were established in Australia before officer training was eventually concentrated at a school near Duntroon. These schools produced {{a large number of}} officers, but they were eventually closed in 1917 due to concerns that their graduates were too inexperienced and after this most replacement officers were drawn <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ranks</b> <b>of</b> the AIF's deployed units, and candidates attended either British officer training units, or in-theatre schools established in France. After February 1916, the issue of NCO training was also taken more seriously, and several schools were established, with training initially being two weeks in duration before being increased to two months.|$|E
5|$|The Arabization of the Ayyubid ruling {{families}} differed starkly <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ranks</b> <b>of</b> their armies, which lacked cultural cohesion, with Turks and Kurds {{dominating the}} cavalry and nomadic Turcomans and Arabs filling {{the ranks of}} the infantry. These groups typically settled in the pastoral areas outside of the cities, the centers of cultural life, and as such they were relatively isolated from the Arabic-dominant urban environment. This isolation allowed them to preserve their traditions. It is thought that Saladin spoke Turkish to his military commanders. Like their Fatimid predecessors, the Ayyubid rulers of Egypt maintained a substantial force of mamluks (military slaves). By {{the first half of the}} 13th century mamluks were mostly drawn from Kipchak Turks and Circassians and there is strong evidence that these forces continued to speak Kipchak Turkish.|$|E

5|$|The Sejm was {{composed}} of two chambers: a chamber of deputies and a senate. The chamber of deputies {{was composed}} of 100 deputies, in 1810 increased to 166. The initial 100 {{was composed of}} 60 deputies (after 1810, 100) elected <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ranks</b> <b>of</b> the nobility (szlachta) during the sessions of the local parliaments (sejmiks), and 40 non-noble deputies (after 1810, 66), as well {{as members of the}} Council of State. The deputy candidates had to be 24 years or older, and government officials, priests or officers in active military service were not eligible for candidacy. They were elected for a nine-year term of office, in three tranches (elections for a third of the deputies were to be held every three years).|$|E
5|$|Some {{soldiers}} had received training through the compulsory training scheme, while others {{had served as}} volunteers in the part-time forces before the war or {{as members of the}} British Army, but their numbers were limited. In contrast, the majority of officers initially appointed had previous military experience. This was largely through service in the pre-war militia, though, where there had been little to no formal officer training. In addition, there was a small cadre of junior officers who had been trained for the permanent force at the Royal Military College, Duntroon, but their numbers were very small and at the outbreak of the war the first class had to be graduated early {{in order for them to}} join the AIF, being placed mainly in staff positions. Other than small numbers of Duntroon graduates, from January 1915 the only means to be commissioned into the AIF was <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ranks</b> <b>of</b> enlisted personnel. While the AIF's initial senior officers had been members of the pre-war military, few had any substantial experience in managing brigade-sized or larger units in the field as training exercises on this scale had been rarely conducted before the outbreak of hostilities. This inexperience contributed to tactical mistakes and avoidable casualties during the Gallipoli Campaign.|$|E
5|$|The elite hypaspistai infantry, {{composed}} of handpicked men <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ranks</b> <b>of</b> the pezhetairoi and perhaps synonymous with earlier doryphoroi, were formed {{during the reign}} of Philip II and saw continued use {{during the reign of}} Alexander the Great. Philip II was also responsible for the establishment of the royal bodyguards (somatophylakes) and royal pages (basilikoi paides). Philip II was also able to field archers, including mercenary Cretan archers and perhaps some native Macedonians. It is unclear if the Thracians, Paionians, and Illyrians fighting as javelin throwers, slingers, and archers serving in Macedonian armies from the reign of Philip II onward were conscripted as allies via a treaty or were simply hired mercenaries. Philip II hired engineers such as Polyidus of Thessaly and Diades of Pella, who were capable of building state of the art siege engines and artillery firing large bolts. Following the acquisition of the lucrative mines at Krinides (renamed Philippi), the royal treasury could afford to field a permanent, professional standing army. The increase in state revenues allowed the Macedonians to build a small navy for the first time, which included triremes. Although it did not succeed in every battle, the army of Philip II was able to successfully adopt the military tactics of its enemies, such as the embolon (i.e. 'flying wedge') formation of the Scythians. This offered cavalry far greater maneuverability and an edge in battle that previously did not exist in the Classical Greek world.|$|E

5|$|Some {{soldiers}} had received training through the compulsory training scheme {{that had been}} established in 1911, while others had served as volunteers in the part-time forces before the war or {{as members of the}} British Army, but their numbers were limited and in many cases the quality of the training they had received was also limited. The original intention had been that half the initial intake would consist of soldiers that were currently serving in the Militia, but ultimately this did not come to fruition and while about 8,000 of the original intake had some prior military experience, either through compulsory training or as volunteers, over 6,000 had none at all. In terms of officers, the situation was better. For example, within the 1st Division, of its initial 631 officers, 607 had had previous military experience. This was largely through service in the pre-war militia, though, where there had been little to no formal officer training. In addition, there was a small cadre of junior officers who had been trained for the permanent force at the Royal Military College, Duntroon, but their numbers were very small and at the outbreak of the war the first class had to be graduated early {{in order for them to}} join the AIF, being placed mainly in staff positions.
