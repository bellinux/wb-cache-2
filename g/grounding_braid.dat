50|$|These cables use two {{parallel}} bus wires which carry electricity {{but do not}} create significant heat. They are encased in a semi-conductive polymer. This polymer is loaded with carbon; as the polymer element heats, it allows less current to flow. The cables are manufactured and then irradiated and by varying both the carbon content and the dosage then different tape with different output characteristics can be produced. There is then an inner jacket which separates the bus wires from the <b>grounding</b> <b>braid.</b> In commercial and industrial cables, an additional outer jacket of rubber or Teflon is applied. The benefits of this cable are the ability {{to cut to length}} in the field, It is more rugged but not necessarily more reliable than series or zone heaters, it cannot over-heat itself so in theory it can be crossed, but it is bad practice to install tape in this way. Self-regulating heating cables have a specific maximum exposure temperature based on the type of polymer which is used to make the heating core which means that if they are subject to high temperatures then the tape can be damaged beyond repair. Also self-limiting tapes are subject to high inrush currents on starting up similar to an 'induction' motor so a higher rated contactor is required.|$|E
40|$|New harness for {{electrical}} wiring includes plugs {{that do not}} loosen from vibration. <b>Ground</b> <b>braids</b> prevented from detaching from connectors and constrained so braids do not open into swollen "birdcage" sections. Spring of stainless steel encircles <b>ground</b> <b>braid.</b> Self-locking connector contains ratchet not only preventing connector from opening, but tightens when vibrated...|$|R
50|$|Fossils {{were formed}} as silica {{formed in the}} hot springs themselves; when silica-rich water flooded the {{surrounding}} areas; and when it permeated into the surrounding soil. The texture of the sinter formed resemble those found today in freshwater streams at Yellowstone which are typically alkaline (pH 8.7) and tepid 20 to 28 C. The springs were periodically active, and flowed into an alluvial plain containing small lakes. By analogy with Yellowstone, the chert itself probably formed in a marshy area towards the latter end {{of the extent of}} outwash from the springs. Living vegetation covered around 55% of the land area, with litter covering 30% and the remaining 15% of the <b>ground</b> being bare.A <b>braided</b> river flowing to the north periodically deposited the sandy layers found in cores when it flooded its banks.|$|R
50|$|In 1936 Dr. Hans Piesker, an {{archaeologist}} from Hermannsburg, discovered {{a settlement of}} the Beaker culture (ca. 4200-2800 BC) northwest of Beckedorf on the Lührsberg, a low hill 77 metres above sea level and 500 metres wide. Of the original settlement, 30,000 square metres in area, numerous post- and settlement pits were exposed, {{as well as several}} house structures. The houses had a length of about 6 metres and were dug between 0.80 m and 1.40 m into the <b>ground.</b> They had <b>braided</b> walls (Flechtwände) coated in clay. In addition, arrowheads, scrapers, a spearhead and fragments of axes made of flint were found and shards of pottery excavated. From the discovery of spindle whorls it can be deduced that also wool or plant fibres were also been processed here.|$|R
40|$|Topological {{states of}} matter are {{characterized}} by topological invariant, which are physical quantities whose values are quantized and do not depend on details of the measured system. Of these, the easiest to probe in experiments is the electrical Hall conductance, which is expressed in units of e^ 2 /h (e the electron charge, h the Planck's constant). In the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE), fractional quantized values of the electrical Hall conductance attest to topologically ordered states, which are states that carry quasi particles with fractional charge and anyonic statistics. Another topological invariant, which is much harder to measure, is the thermal Hall conductance, expressed in units of κ_ 0 T=(π^ 2 kB^ 2 / 3 h) T (kB the Boltzmann constant, T the temperature). For the quantized thermal Hall conductance, a fractional value attests that the probed state of matter is non-abelian. Quasi particles in non-abelian states lead to a ground state degeneracy and perform topological unitary transformations among <b>ground</b> states when <b>braided.</b> As such, they may be useful for topological quantum computation. In this paper, we report our measurements of the thermal Hall conductance for several quantum Hall states in the first excited Landau level. Remarkably, we find the thermal Hall conductance of the ν= 5 / 2 state to be fractional, and to equal 2. 5 κ_ 0 TComment: 16 pages, 16 figure...|$|R
