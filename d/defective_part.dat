[9] The gracioso or buffoon, {{according}} to Lord Holland, held an intermediate character between a spectator and {{a character in}} the play; interrupting with his remarks, at one time, the performance, of which he forms an essential, but very <b>defective</b> <b>part</b> in another. His part was, I presume, partly written, partly extempore. Something of the kind was certainly known upon our stage. Wilson and Tarleton, in their capacity of clowns, entered freely into a contest of wit with the spectators, which {{was not at all}} held inconsistent with their having a share in the performance.

50|$|Non-uniform wall {{sections}} {{can contribute}} to warpage and stresses in molded parts. Sections which are too thin have a higher chance of breakage in handling, may restrict the flow of material and may trap air causing a <b>defective</b> <b>part.</b> Too heavy a wall thickness, on the other hand, will slow the curing cycle and add to material cost and increase cycle time.|$|E

50|$|Not {{getting things}} {{right the first}} time means wasted resources, effort and time. This all leads to {{excessive}} costs for the company and poor-quality, high-priced products for the customer. NRFT measures the quality of a product and is expressed in “number of <b>defective</b> <b>parts</b> per million”. The number of defective products is divided by the total quantity of finished products. This figure is then multiplied by 10^6 to get the number of <b>defective</b> <b>parts</b> per million.|$|R
50|$|For {{parts that}} have broken in service, a {{forensic}} engineering or failure analysis is performed to identify weakness, where broken parts are analysed {{for the cause}} or causes of failure. The method seeks to identify the weakest component in the load path. If {{this is the part}} which actually failed, then it may corroborate independent evidence of the failure. If not, then another explanation has to be sought, such as a <b>defective</b> <b>part</b> with a lower tensile strength than it should for example.|$|E
50|$|Despite all the {{automation}} {{involved in}} the diamond turning process, the human operator still plays the main role in achieving the final result. Quality control is {{a major part of}} the diamond turning process and is required after each stage of machining, sometimes after each pass of the cutting tool. If it is not detected immediately, even a minute error during any of the cutting stages results in a <b>defective</b> <b>part.</b> The extremely high requirements for quality of diamond-turned optics leave virtually no room for error.|$|E
50|$|Ford {{has found}} that the cruise control system in many of their trucks could catch fire, because the switch system could corrode over time, {{overheat}} and ignite. Ignition was later blamed on spillage from the adjacent master cylinder. On March 5, 2007 Ford recalled 155,000 2003 full-size pickups and full-size SUVs for the <b>defective</b> <b>part.</b> During the previous two years Ford had recalled 5.8 million vehicles in because of the defective cruise control systems in trucks, SUVs and vans.

40|$|During hot forging, the billet {{is heated}} to an {{elevated}} temperature, forged to the required shape and cooled to room temperature. Most {{of the hot}} forged parts produced meet the specified geometric tolerances, but some do not. Some of the <b>defective</b> <b>parts</b> can be rectified by machining, others are rejected. Restoring a hot forged part demands extra production cost. <b>Defective</b> <b>parts</b> {{can be attributed to}} process variations or uncertainties that occur during production. Such manufacturing anomalies in the metal forming industry can induce heavy losses (e. g., premature failure of equipment, under-fill, folds in part and double hit) during mass production. The objectives of this research are, determining the uncertainties that cause <b>defective</b> <b>parts</b> during hot forging and illustrate a method to determine parameters that control the trade-off between rejected parts and rectifiable parts. This information will aid in reducing production costs of the forgings. The uncertainties are demonstrated in this research by simulations of the forging and cooling processes...|$|R

Moreover, the inventory size takes into account that the stock {{is a mixture of}} good and <b>defective</b> <b>parts,</b> and <b>defective</b> <b>parts</b> are generally eliminated at inspection stations. Mhada et al. (2014 a) improve the continuous models of Kim and Gershwin (2005, 2008). The former model is more fluid in the sense that quality is treated as a continuous flow, whereas in the Kim and Gershwin models quality is considered to be discrete. They considered a line with 4 machines.|$|R

40|$|In this study, we {{proposed}} a mathematical model for four-level defective goods supply chain with imperfect quality of commodity components in an uncertain state to maximize profit of supply chain. It is assumed that the inspection of incoming parts in suppliers is randomly done and incomplete. This lead some of the manufactured products will not be properly manufactured because of <b>defective</b> <b>parts</b> and are considered as defective goods and in most cases, the defective products can be repaired by replacing with the good <b>parts.</b> The <b>defective</b> <b>parts</b> will be collected {{and then returned to}} the suppliers for repairing. Out proposed model considers <b>defective</b> <b>parts</b> problem by optimizing the costs of production, maintenance, shipping, reworking on the <b>defective</b> goods and <b>parts,</b> shortage in retailers due to the production of defective goods and cost of capital incurred by the companies. The model can anticipate the active suppliers/manufacturers/distributors and the quantity of parts and goods that must be exchanged between them.

40|$|Original {{scientific}} paper Non {{production of}} <b>defective</b> <b>parts</b> during production operations and non-attention to inflation and time value of money {{are among the}} hypotheses of economic production quantity model. But the performed studies show that considering <b>defective</b> <b>parts</b> in production size determination models or including the subject of inflation and time value of money in them leads to the change of optimal quantity of production class. Therefore, in production systems with <b>defective</b> <b>parts</b> production, {{it is necessary to}} consider these two factors in order to determine production class size. This article studies the effect of time value of money on economic production quantity model in spite of repetition. Due to the complexity of cost function, {{it is not possible to}} find an optimal answer easily; therefore, this article uses an algorithm based on combination of two search methods, accelerating and Dico Thomas, in order to solve the problem. Finally, sensitivity analysis has been done on the basis of interest rate, inflation rate and joint rate. Numerical calculation shows that failure to consider inflation and time value of money causes relatively high error in cost...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 83) A {{computer simulation}} {{model has been}} developed to aid in determination of the quantity of products and components that should be manufactured {{in order to achieve}} minimum costs. The simulation model is directed mainly for products, components and common components to different products, all with a discrete demand and manufactured based on a production to order system. It considers the fact that manufacturing process will rarely yield lots that are free of <b>defective</b> <b>parts</b> and therefore the planned manufacturing quantities should consider that these will be present and reduce the final outcome of parts. The uncertainty of the amount of <b>defective</b> <b>parts</b> will probably cause the quantity manufactured to have a shortage or an excess of parts depending on the existing discrepancy between the occurring amount of <b>defective</b> <b>parts</b> and the one originally estimated. Different costs will exist according to the situation and the minimum total cost will be the one desired. The simulation model has been applied for the manufacturing of underwater electrical hull penetrators. Three products with common components have been selected and their demands arbitrarily chosen as shown: (See more in text. ...|$|R

General Howard did not want Rob to go public with the <b>defective</b> <b>part,</b> since Howard authorized the delivery of the helicopters with the defective C-ring from the manufacturing company. While hiding in the motel, Barbara spots Marchais and his partner planting a bomb in her car. Just after he put Johnny in her car, Barbara moves the bomb out of her car and plants it in the car the hitmen are using. Johnny runs back to the motel to get the robotic toy that carries the C-ring. Barbara rushes to get Johnny and get back to the car. Marchais detonates the device, unknowingly killing himself and his partner, as Barbara makes her getaway.|$|E
5000|$|USS Minnesota (SSN-783) is a fast attack submarine, the 10th of {{the planned}} 48-boat [...] It is the third United States Navy vessel named {{for the state of}} Minnesota, and the first to bear the name since 1921. Minnesota was laid down on 20 May 2011, and christened on 27 October 2012 in a {{ceremony}} attended by many top ranking officials in the U.S. Navy and Congress. On 6 June 2013, Huntington Ingalls Industries announced that Minnesota had been delivered to the Navy, nearly 11 months ahead of schedule. Minnesota was commissioned on 7 September 2013, but has spent little time at sea as she has been in port undergoing repairs for almost 2 years. A <b>defective</b> <b>part</b> was discovered, due to poor welding. The same issue has been discovered on two other boats in the class.

40|$|If many {{potential}} defects exist {{at each site}} in an integrated circuit, then {{as the number of}} applied test patterns increases, the number of defects which remain undetected decreases monotonically. Modeling this rate of decline in <b>defective</b> <b>part</b> level is a non-trivial problem. We show that the number of times each site is observed serves as a signi cantly superior basis for modeling this phenomenon{ when contrasted with the number of faults detected. This "site observation-based" predictor not only increases the accuracy of <b>defective</b> <b>part</b> level prediction, it also provides the rst quantitative method for comparing the eectiveness of various ATPG strategies to reduce the <b>defective</b> <b>part</b> level...|$|E

25|$|A joint {{investigation}} by the Russian Interstate Aviation Committee, aircraft manufacturer, engine manufacturer and Azerbaijani Ministry of National Security was launched. Azerbaijan Airlines believed <b>defective</b> spare <b>parts</b> caused the crash.

50|$|However, {{there is}} one {{characteristic}} of modern quality that is universal. In the past, {{when we tried to}} improve quality, typically defined as producing fewer <b>defective</b> <b>parts,</b> we did so at the expense of increased cost, increased task time, longer cycle time, etc. We could not get fewer <b>defective</b> <b>parts</b> and lower cost and shorter cycle times, and so on. However, when modern quality techniques are applied correctly to business, engineering, manufacturing or assembly processes, all aspects of quality - customer satisfaction and fewer defects/errors and cycle time and task time/productivity and total cost, etc. - must all improve or, if one of these aspects does not improve, it must at least stay stable and not decline. Therefore, modern quality has the characteristic that it creates AND-based benefits, not OR-based benefits.|$|R
40|$|A genetic {{algorithm}} based defect identification system for machined-parts inspection purposes is developed.

40|$|Deterministic {{observation}} and random excitation of fault sites during the ATPG process dramatically reduces the overall <b>defective</b> <b>part</b> level. However, multiple observations of each fault site {{lead to increased}} test set size and require more tester memory. In this paper, we propose a new ATPG algorithm to find a near-minimal test pattern set that detects faults multiple times and achieves excellent <b>defective</b> <b>part</b> level. This greedy approach uses 3 -value fault simulation to estimate the potential value of each vector candidate at each stage of ATPG. The result shows generation of a close to minimal vector set is possible only using dynamic compaction techniques in most cases. Finally, a systematic method to trade-off between <b>defective</b> <b>part</b> level and test size is also presented...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 50 - 52). Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The primary purpose of digital circuit manufacture testing is to detect defective parts so {{that they will not be}} sold to customers. Predicting the <b>defective</b> <b>part</b> level, which results after a set of test patterns has been applied, is not a simple problem, but such a prediction is necessary if the effectiveness of different test sets is to be analyzed without doing extensive surrogate simulation. The final <b>defective</b> <b>part</b> level depends upon the test vectors applied, the circuit structure, and the nature of the defects which are present. In order to detect a defect, a test pattern must both excite the defect and propagate the resulting incorrect logic value through the circuit to a primary output. This research introduces a model which accurately predicts the <b>defective</b> <b>part</b> level based upon the number of times each circuit site has been observed and the probability of exciting an undetected defect given that that site is observed. It is shown conclusively that the probability of excitation decreases exponentially as the number of observations at a circuit site increases. This information is then inserted into the MPG-D <b>defective</b> <b>part</b> level model which can be used to accurately predict the final <b>defective</b> <b>part</b> level that results from the application of different test pattern sets...|$|E
