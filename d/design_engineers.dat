5|$|Edward DeVoe Tompkins, Inc. {{suffered}} numerous {{delays in}} the construction of the bridge and sued the City of Bridgeport. The case went to the Connecticut Supreme Court in Edward DeV. Tompkins v. City of Bridgeport, Connecticut. Tompkins sued the City of Bridgeport for breach of contract on the grounds that City of Bridgeport was unresponsive, and did not clear the site as scheduled. Tompkins also cited other concerns relating to the design and construction of the bridge including the <b>design</b> <b>engineers</b> from the Strauss Bascule Bridge Company being located in Chicago. The City of Bridgeport alleged that Tompkins was incompetent and uncooperative, but the Connecticut Supreme Court disagreed and ruled in favor of Tompkins. The Court awarded Tompkins the full contract as damages.|$|E
5|$|With the bow now irretrievably stuck, and {{the threat}} of even worse weather coming which could {{completely}} destroy the ship, White Star officials decided to attempt an unorthodox method of saving the stern half of the ship, which was not grounded nor damaged, by separating it from the damaged bow. Suevic, like other White Star liners, had been built with watertight compartments as a safety precaution. Depending on the integrity of this <b>design,</b> <b>engineers</b> used carefully placed charges of dynamite to sever the bow at a bulkhead just aft of the bridge on 4 April. This move was successful, and the aft half of the ship floated free. The watertight compartments held their integrity, and Suevic was able to steam under her own power, in reverse and guided by tugs, to Southampton. The damaged bow was left to break up on the rocks.|$|E

25|$|The {{hydraulic}} jump {{is the most}} commonly used choice of <b>design</b> <b>engineers</b> for energy dissipation below spillways and outlets. A properly designed {{hydraulic jump}} can provide for 60-70% energy dissipation of the energy in the basin itself, limiting the damage to structures and the streambed. Even with such efficient energy dissipation, stilling basins must be carefully designed to avoid serious damage due to uplift, vibration, cavitation, and abrasion. An extensive literature has been developed for this type of engineering.|$|E

25|$|A sportier {{version of}} the 200B sedan was {{released}} in June 1978. The new SX featured a revised grille, front spoiler, alloy wheels, revised door and seat trim (striped seat inserts) and tachometer, while the suspension was altered to improve handling. The colours available for this model were simply blue, white or red, and the only transmission available was a 4-speed floor shift. Significantly the SX was a unique model to Australia, the added input from Nissan's Australian <b>design</b> <b>engineers</b> signified {{a step away from}} just assembling cars. This in turn led to the locally built Datsuns, and later Nissans, being re-engineered to better suit Australian conditions, with many components being sourced locally a tradition that would continue right up until 1992, when Nissan ceased local manufacture.|$|E
25|$|The minimum control speed (VMC) of an {{aircraft}} (specifically an airplane) is a V-speed that specifies the calibrated airspeed below which directional or lateral {{control of the}} aircraft {{can no longer be}} maintained, after the failure of one or more engines. The VMC only applies if at least one engine is still operative, and will depend on the stage of flight. Indeed, multiple VMCs have to be calculated for landing, air travel, and ground travel, and there are more still for aircraft with four or more engines. These are all included in the aircraft flight manual of all multi-engine aircraft. When <b>design</b> <b>engineers</b> are sizing an airplane's vertical tail and flight control surfaces, they {{have to take into account}} the effect this will have on the airplane's minimum control speeds.|$|E
25|$|For certain applications, {{copper alloy}} {{conductors}} are preferred instead of pure copper, especially when higher strengths or improved abrasion and corrosion resistance properties are required. However, relative to pure copper, the higher strength and corrosion resistance benefits that are offered by copper alloys are offset by their lower electrical conductivities. <b>Design</b> <b>engineers</b> weigh {{the advantages and}} disadvantages of the various types of copper and copper alloy conductors when determining which type to specify for a specific electrical application. An example of a copper alloy conductor is cadmium copper wire, which is used for railroad electrification in North America. In Britain the BPO (later Post Office Telecommunications) used cadmium copper aerial lines with 1% cadmium for extra strength; for local lines 40lb/mile (1.3mm dia) and for toll lines 70lb/mile (1.7mm dia).|$|E

500|$|The {{existing}} Rolls-Royce {{facilities at}} Osmaston, Derby were {{not suitable for}} large-scale engine production although the floor space had been increased by some 25% between 1935 and 1939; nevertheless, Hives planned to build the first two- or three hundred engines there until engineering teething troubles had been resolved. To fund this expansion, the Air Ministry had provided a total of ₤1,927,000 by December 1939. [...] Having a workforce that consisted mainly of <b>design</b> <b>engineers</b> and highly skilled men, the Derby factory carried out the majority of development work on the Merlin, with flight testing carried out at nearby RAF Hucknall.

2500|$|The {{construction}} of the Petronas Towers {{turned out to be}} a multinational effort. [...] The structural <b>design</b> <b>engineers</b> worked out of New York City, while the wind-tunnel consultants and elevator <b>design</b> <b>engineers</b> were from Canada. To meet local safety construction codes, the towers had to be able to withstand [...] winds. [...] To assure this requirement would be fulfilled, the engineers tested the towers twice within a wind tunnel, first by computer simulation and second by building an actual model of the towers. A unique typographical font was created for the KLCC precinct signage by the Australian design firm, Emery Vincent, who also designed the building's architectural graphics and way-finding maps. The design team was led by Gary Emery and included Alvin Chan, Gini Lee, Linda Popovic and Marius Vogl.|$|E
