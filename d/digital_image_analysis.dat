In conclusion, although the Van Herick technique for anterior chamber angle assessment offers many benefits including being non-invasive, quick, a comparatively accessible technique, with satisfactory specificity and sensitivity values, for the detection of angle closure; it is nonetheless not devoid of limitations. Most of the sources of variability may be simply overcome with the direct measurement of the depth of the anterior chamber through utilisation of equipment such as the Pentacam or imaging <b>digital</b> <b>image</b> <b>analysis,</b> rather than by merely grading the fraction between the anterior chamber depth and the corneal thickness.|$|E

50|$|A {{related work}} called the grid cell {{topology}} appeared in Alexandrov-Hopf's book Topologie I (1935) {{can be considered}} as a link to classic combinatorial topology. Rosenfeld et al. proposed digital connectivity such as 4-connectivity and 8-connectivity in two dimensions as well as 6-connectivity and 26-connectivity in three dimensions. The labeling method for inferring a connected component was studied in the 1970s. T. Pavlidis (1982) suggested the use of graph-theoretic algorithms such as the depth-first search method for finding connected components. V. Kovalevsky (1989) extended Alexandrov-Hopf's 2D grid cell topology to three and higher dimensions. He also proposed (2008) a more general axiomatic theory of locally finite topological spaces and abstract cell complexes formerly suggested by Steinitz (1908). It is the Alexandrov topology. The book of 2008 contains new definitions of topological balls and spheres independent of a metric and numerous applications to <b>digital</b> <b>image</b> <b>analysis.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Proximity System is an {{application}} developed to demonstrate descriptive-based topological approaches to nearness and proximity {{within the context}} of <b>digital</b> <b>image</b> <b>analysis.</b> The Proximity System grew out of the work of S. Naimpally and J. Peters on Topological Spaces. The Proximity System was written in Java and is intended to run in two different operating environments, namely on Android smartphones and tablets, as well as desktop platforms running the Java Virtual Machine. With respect to the desktop environment, the Proximity System is a cross-platform Java application for Windows, OSX, and Linux systems, which has been tested on Windows 7 and Debian Linux using the Sun Java 6 Runtime. In terms of the implementation of the theoretical approaches, both the Android and the desktop based applications use the same back-end libraries to perform the description-based calculations, where the only differences are the user interface and the Android version has less available features due to restrictions on system resources.|$|E

40|$|Quantification {{of protein}} {{expression}} based on immunohistochemistry (IHC) {{is an important}} step in clinical diagnoses and translational tissue-based research. Manual scoring systems are used in order to evaluate protein expression based on staining intensities and distribution patterns. However, visual scoring remains an inherently subjective approach. The aim of our study was to explore whether <b>digital</b> <b>image</b> <b>analysis</b> proves to be an alternative or even superior tool to quantify expression of membrane-bound proteins. We analyzed five membrane-binding biomarkers (HER 2, EGFR, pEGFR, β-catenin, and E-cadherin) and performed IHC on tumor tissue microarrays from 153 esophageal adenocarcinomas patients from a single center study. The tissue cores were scored visually applying an established routine scoring system as well as by using <b>digital</b> <b>image</b> <b>analysis</b> obtaining a continuous spectrum of average staining intensity. Subsequently, we compared both assessments by survival analysis as an end point. There were no significant correlations with patient survival using visual scoring of β-catenin, E-cadherin, pEGFR, or HER 2. In contrast, the results for <b>digital</b> <b>image</b> <b>analysis</b> approach indicated that there were significant associations with disease-free survival for β-catenin, E-cadherin, pEGFR, and HER 2 (P =  0. 0125, P =  0. 0014, P =  0. 0299, and P =  0. 0096, respectively). For EGFR, there was a greater association with patient survival when <b>digital</b> <b>image</b> <b>analysis</b> was used compared to when visual scoring was (visual: P =  0. 0045, image analysis: P <  0. 0001). The results of this study indicated that <b>digital</b> <b>image</b> <b>analysis</b> was superior to visual scoring. <b>Digital</b> <b>image</b> <b>analysis</b> is more sensitive and, therefore, better able to detect biological differences within the tissues with greater accuracy.

40|$|Objective {{assessment}} of crop soil cover, {{defined as the}} percentage of leaf cover that has been buried in soil due to weed harrowing, is crucial to further progress in post-emergence weed harrowing research. Up to now, crop soil cover has been assessed by visual scores, which are biased and context dependent. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether <b>digital</b> <b>image</b> <b>analysis</b> is a feasible method to estimate crop soil cover in the early growth stages of cereals. Two main questions were examined: (1) how to capture suitable digital images under field conditions with a standard high-resolution digital camera and (2) how to analyse the images with an automated <b>digital</b> <b>image</b> <b>analysis</b> procedure. The importance of light conditions, camera angle, size of recorded area, growth stage and direction of harrowing were investigated in order to establish a standard for image capture and an automated image analysis procedure based on the excess green colour index was developed. The study shows that the automated <b>digital</b> <b>image</b> <b>analysis</b> procedure provided reliable estimations of leaf cover, defined as the as the proportion of pixels in digital images determined to be green, which were used to estimate crop soil cover. A standard for image capture is suggested and it is recommended to use <b>digital</b> <b>image</b> <b>analysis</b> to estimated crop soil cover in future research.

40|$|The use of <b>Digital</b> <b>Image</b> Correlation (DIC) {{technique}} {{has become increasingly}} popular for displacement measurements and for characterizing localized material deformation. In this study, a three-dimensional <b>digital</b> <b>image</b> correlation <b>analysis</b> (3 D-DIC) was performed to investigate the displacements {{on the surface of}} isotropically consolidated and drained sand specimens during triaxial compression tests. The deformation of a representative volume of the material captured by 3 D-DIC is used for the estimation of the kinematic and volumetric conditions of the specimen at different stages of deformation, combined with the readings of the global axial compression of the specimen. This allowed for the characterization of a Mohr-Coulomb plasticity model with hardening and softening laws. In addition, a two-dimensional axisymmetric finite element model was built to simulate the actual experimental conditions, including both the global and local kinematics effects captured by 3 D <b>digital</b> <b>image</b> correlation <b>analysis</b> on the boundary of the specimen.
