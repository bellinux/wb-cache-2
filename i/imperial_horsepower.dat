2500|$|Automotive {{engine power}} is usually {{measured}} in horsepower (rather than in kilowatts) in Russia, most other ex-USSR countries and German-speaking countries (note {{that this is}} typically [...] "metric horsepower" [...] rather than <b>imperial</b> <b>horsepower),</b> although in the EU from 2010 the horsepower is permitted only as a supplementary unit.|$|E
5000|$|The {{mechanical}} horsepower, {{also known}} as <b>imperial</b> <b>horsepower</b> equals approximately 745.7 watts. It is defined as 550 foot-pounds per second.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} definitions {{have been}} widely used:In certain situations {{it is necessary to}} distinguish between the various definitions of horsepower and thus a suffix is added: hp(I) for mechanical (or <b>imperial)</b> <b>horsepower,</b> hp(M) for metric horsepower, hp(S) for boiler (or steam) horsepower and hp(E) for electrical horsepower.|$|E
5000|$|The metric {{horsepower}} equals approximately 735.5 watts (98.6% of an <b>imperial</b> mechanical <b>horsepower).</b> It {{is defined}} as 75 kilogram-force meters per second, approximately 735.5 watts.|$|R
50|$|DIN 66036 defines one metric {{horsepower}} as {{the power}} to raise a mass of 75 kilograms against the Earth's gravitational force over a distance of one metre in one second: 75 kg · 9.80665 m/s2 · 1 m / 1 s = 75 ·m/s = 1 PS. This is equivalent to 735.49875 W, or 98.6% of an <b>imperial</b> mechanical <b>horsepower.</b>|$|R

50|$|Horsepower (hp) is {{a unit of}} {{measurement}} of power (the rate at which work is done). There are many different standards and types of horsepower. Two common definitions being used today are the mechanical horsepower (or <b>imperial</b> <b>horsepower),</b> which is approximately 746 watts, and the metric horsepower, which is approximately 735.5 watts.|$|E
