500|$|In {{addition}} to scientific advances, the designers speculated {{on the future}} development of human society. The designers allow the player to decide on {{a whole series of}} value choices and choose a [...] "ruthless", [...] "moderate", or [...] "idealistic" [...] stance. Reynolds said the designers don't promote a single [...] "right" [...] answer, instead giving each value choice positive and negative consequences. This design was intended to force the player to [...] "think" [...] and make the game [...] "addictive". He also commented that Alpha Centauris fictional nature allowed them to draw their characters [...] "a lot more sharply and distinctly than the natural blurring and <b>greyness</b> of history".|$|E
500|$|During an {{appearance}} on Top of the Pops, Morrissey appeared waving gladioli. A 2004 BBC Radio 2 feature on the song noted that the performance was most people's introduction to The Smiths and, [...] "therefore, to the weird, wordy world of Morrissey and the music of Johnny Marr". Uncut magazine, commentating on the nationally televised debut, wrote that [...] "Thursday evening when Manchester's feyest first appeared on Top of the Pops would be an unexpected pivotal cultural event {{in the lives of}} a million serious English boys. His very English, camp glumness was a revolt into Sixties kitchen-sink <b>greyness</b> against the gaudiness of the Eighties new wave music, as exemplified by Culture Club and their ilk. The Smiths' subject matter may have been 'squalid' but there was a purity of purpose about them that you messed with at your peril." [...] Noel Gallagher said of the performance: [...] "None of my mates liked them — they were more hooligan types. They came into work and said 'Fuckin' hell, did you see that poof on [...] "Top of the Pops" [...] with the bush in his back pocket?' But I thought it was life-changing." ...|$|E
2500|$|A housing {{shortage}} existed throughout the Eastern Bloc, especially after a severe cutback in state resources available for housing starting in 1975. [...] Cities became filled with large system-built apartment blocks [...] Western visitors {{from places like}} West Germany expressed surprise at the perceived shoddiness of new, box-like concrete structures {{across the border in}} East Germany, along with a relative <b>greyness</b> of the physical environment and the often joyless appearance of people on the street or in stores. Housing construction policy suffered from considerable organisational problems. Moreover, completed houses possessed noticeably poor quality finishes.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the north}} end of the Palace rises the most famous of the towers, Elizabeth Tower, {{commonly}} known as Big Ben. At 96metres (316ft), it is only slightly shorter than Victoria Tower but much slimmer. Originally known simply as the Clock Tower (the name Elizabeth Tower was conferred on it in 2012 to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II), it houses the Great Clock of Westminster, built by Edward John Dent on designs by amateur horologist Edmund Beckett Denison. Striking the hour to within a second of the time, the Great Clock achieved standards of accuracy considered impossible by 19th-century clockmakers, and it has remained consistently reliable since it entered service in 1859. The time is shown on four dials [...] in diameter, which are made of milk glass and are lit from behind at night; the hour hand is [...] long and the minute hand [...] The Clock Tower was designed by Augustus Pugin and built after his death. Charles Barry asked Pugin to design the clock tower because Pugin had previously helped Barry design the Palace. In the 2012 BBC Four documentary, Richard Taylor gives a description of Pugin's Clock Tower: [...] "It rises up from the ground in this stately rhythm, higher and higher, before you reach the clock face, picked out as a giant rose, its petals fringed with gold. Medieval windows above that and then it hits the grey slate roof, its <b>greyness</b> relieved by those delicate little windows again picked out in gold leaf. And then rises up again in a great jet of gold to the higher roof that curves gracefully upwards to a spire with a crown and flowers and a cross. It's elegant and grand and has fairy tale qualities." ...|$|E
60|$|Low clouds hung {{upon the}} sky, {{and on the}} horizon the <b>greyness</b> of the heavens mingled with the <b>greyness</b> of the sea. She looked into the {{distance}} with longing eyes. Now all her life was set upon that far-off corner of unknown Africa, where Alec and George were doing great deeds. She wondered what was {{the meaning of the}} silence which had covered them so long.|$|E
6000|$|The <b>greyness</b> of {{the distant}} hills [...] Is silvered in the lucid East, [...] See, now the sheeny-plumèd cock [...] Wags haughtily his crest.|$|E
60|$|An ashen <b>greyness</b> {{had been}} {{stealing}} across the old officer's face, and Mrs. Holl was terrified at seeing him suddenly fall forward across the table.|$|E
60|$|The girl's {{eyes had}} grown {{compassionate}} {{as she watched}} him, for there was a suggestive <b>greyness</b> in his face. It was evident {{to her that he}} was utterly worn-out.|$|E
60|$|Yeovil said nothing, but {{into the}} sallow <b>greyness</b> {{of his face}} there crept a dark flush, that faded {{presently}} and left his colour more grey and bloodless than before.|$|E
60|$|And as {{they turned}} down from the knoll to rejoin their comrades, the sun dipped and disappeared, and the woods fell {{instantly}} into the gravity and <b>greyness</b> of the early night.|$|E
60|$|Before {{his long}} and strenuous life was finished. Watch, {{originally}} jet-black without a spot, became quite grey, the <b>greyness</b> being most {{marked on the}} head, which became at last almost white.|$|E
60|$|The cock crew, and {{the night}} seemed to fade away into <b>greyness.</b> The first light of dawn broke through the windows, and I pressed my love to my heart in one last kiss.|$|E
60|$|And all {{the earth}} is gone into a dust Of <b>greyness</b> mingled with a fume of gold, Covered with aged lichens, pale with must, And all the sky has {{withered}} and gone cold.|$|E
6000|$|How {{sweet to}} spend in this blue bay [...] The close of life's {{disastrous}} day, [...] To watch the morn break faintly free [...] Across the <b>greyness</b> of the sea, [...] What time Memnonian music fills [...] The shadows of the dewy hills.|$|E
60|$|Soon {{they were}} in the train again and moving on. The <b>greyness</b> of dawn began. There were several people in the compartment, large florid Belgian business-men with long brown beards, talking incessantly in an ugly French she was too tired to follow.|$|E
6000|$|Brighter gleamed {{the points}} of light, and under their steel pots {{the faces of the}} musketeers, suffused by a dull red glow, sprang for a moment out of the grey mass, to fade once more into the general <b>greyness</b> at the word, [...] "Cock your matches!" ...|$|E
60|$|The colour had deepened in her thin, oval face, {{with its}} {{straight}} brows, and large, grey eyes. Her hair, brushed in fine, high curves {{back from her}} forehead, was going grey, like his own, and this <b>greyness</b> made the sudden vivid colour in her cheeks painfully pathetic.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Lewisham felt {{a curious}} change of {{atmosphere}} on his entry. The door slammed behind him. The hall with its insistent scholastic suggestions, its yellow marbled paper, its long rows of hat-pegs, its disreputable array of umbrellas, a broken mortar-board and a tattered and scattered Principia, seemed dim and dull {{in contrast with}} the luminous stir of the early March evening outside. An unusual sense of the <b>greyness</b> of a teacher's life, of the <b>greyness</b> indeed of the life of all studious souls came, and went in his mind. He took the [...] "lines," [...] written painfully over three pages of exercise book, and obliterated them with a huge G.E.L., scrawled monstrously across each page. He heard the familiar mingled noises of the playground drifting in to him through the open schoolroom door.|$|E
60|$|On the Franciscan {{side of the}} Loggia {{there was}} no {{chanting}} and no flame-colour: only silence and <b>greyness.</b> But there was this counterbalancing difference, that the Franciscans had two champions: a certain Fra Giuliano was to pair with Fra Domenico, while the original champion, Fra Francesco, confined his challenge to Savonarola.|$|E
60|$|Rain, continual rain, a level grey wet sky, a level grey wet sea, a wet and misty train winding {{round and}} round the little bays, diving through tunnels. Ghosts of the unpleasant-looking Lipari islands {{standing}} a little way out to sea, heaps of shadow deposited like rubbish heaps in the universal <b>greyness.</b>|$|E
60|$|She came {{to school}} in the morning seeing the {{hawthorn}} flowers wet, the little, rosy grains swimming in a bowl of dew. The larks quivered their song up into the new sunshine, and the country was so glad. It was a violation to plunge into the dust and <b>greyness</b> of the town.|$|E
60|$|Then, indeed, {{for a time}} I {{felt the}} grim thrill of life. I crawled forward to the cords of the release valves, made my uncle crawl forward too, and let out the gas until we were falling down through {{the air like a}} clumsy glider towards the vague <b>greyness</b> that was land.|$|E
60|$|He {{opened the}} door of the theatre and halted in the chilly grey light that {{struggled}} through the dusty windows. A figure was crouching before the large grate and by its leanness and <b>greyness</b> he knew that it was the dean of studies lighting the fire. Stephen closed the door quietly and approached the fireplace.|$|E
60|$|In {{the silence}} {{something}} happens. A well-remembered voice says, 'Father.' Mr. Don {{looks into the}} <b>greyness</b> from which this voice comes, and he sees his son. We see no one, but we are to understand that, to Mr. Don, Dick is standing there in his habit as he lived. He goes to his boy.|$|E
60|$|Austin {{glanced up}} at the {{lowering}} heavens, but there was no change in their uniform <b>greyness,</b> and no drift of cloud. The smoke of the locomotive boiler went straight up, and the mist hung motionless among the trees ashore. Still, there was something oppressive and portentous in the stillness, and his skin was tingling.|$|E
60|$|Ernest nodded assent at once, and was {{forthwith}} ushered up into Mr. Wilks's private sanctum. The sub-editor was a dry, grizzly-bearded man, with a prevailing wolfish <b>greyness</b> of demeanour {{about his}} whole person; {{and he shook}} Ernest's proffered hand solemnly, in the dreary fashion that is always begotten of the systematic transposition of night and day.|$|E
60|$|He had, however, let {{his hand}} {{fall back into}} the bandage that hung from his neck, {{when the door opened}} and Laura Waynefleet came in. She saw him leaning {{against the side of the}} stall, with a <b>greyness</b> in his face, which had an angry red scar down one side of it, and her eyes shone with compassion.|$|E
60|$|He was aghast at the {{difference}} wrought in {{her during the}} two months since {{he had seen her}} last. Her colour was gone, and her face had the <b>greyness</b> of the dead. There were strange lines on her forehead, and her eyes had an unnatural glitter. Her youth had suddenly left her. She looked as if she were struck down by mortal illness.|$|E
60|$|She {{thought of}} that kiss with a pitiful shame. She hated herself for the {{weakness}} that could not check her tears. Her lonely life had been brightened by the companionship of her young lover. The youth and girlhood of which fate had cheated her {{had come to her}} with love; the future had looked rosy with promise; now it had darkened with dourness and <b>greyness.</b>|$|E
60|$|Then all the {{strength}} seemed {{to leave the}} girl. Moving shakily, with her hand on Eveline Annersly's arm, she turned towards the house, as the pearly <b>greyness</b> crept into the eastern sky. Eveline Annersly said nothing, for she could feel that her companion was trembling, and hear her catch her breath. Carrie stopped {{when they reached the}} homestead, and looked eastward with tear-dimmed eyes.|$|E
60|$|The {{fugitive}} was now within {{but a few}} leaps of safety; {{but this}} {{last part of the}} meadow ran very steeply uphill, and the man ran slower in proportion. What with the <b>greyness</b> of the falling night, and the uneven movements of the runner, it was no easy aim; and as Dick levelled his bow, he felt a kind of pity, and a half desire that he might miss. The quarrel sped.|$|E
60|$|All the {{way from}} Winnipeg a dingy <b>greyness</b> had {{shrouded}} the apparently interminable levels, which lay parched and white beneath an almost intolerable heat, while the lurching cars swung through a rolling cloud of dust that blurred the dreary prospect. Now, as they were slowing down, grimy faces were thrust from the windows and perspiring men leaned out from the platforms, gazing down the track and inquiring with expletives why they were stopping again.|$|E
60|$|Pale {{sunshine}} {{fell upon}} them, though the larches {{beside the road}} were rustling beneath a little cold wind, and {{the song of the}} river came up brokenly out of the valley. An odour of fresh grass floated about them, and the dry, cold smell of the English spring was in the air. Across the valley dim ghosts of hills lighted by evanescent gleams rose out of the east wind <b>greyness</b> with shadowy grandeur.|$|E
60|$|He {{had been}} staring {{away at the}} door, away from her. But his hand {{remained}} on her shoulder. She had gone suddenly very still. He looked down at her. Her eyes were now wide with fear, with doubt, the light was dying from her face, a shadow of terrible <b>greyness</b> was returning. He could not bear the touch of her eyes' question upon him, and the look of death behind the question.|$|E
6000|$|Turning {{now to the}} right, {{far away}} by Basel [beyond which the [...] Swiss {{mountains}} close the scene], a still larger train of war- [...] geared humanity, two hundred thousand strong, is discernible. [...] It has already crossed the water, which is much narrower here, [...] and has advanced several miles westward, where its ductile mass [...] of <b>greyness</b> and glitter is beheld parting into six columns, that [...] march on in flexuous courses of varying direction.|$|E
60|$|Seaforth had {{afterwards}} a hazy {{recollection of}} helping him to twist {{the strip of}} fabric about the firm white flesh, and that his hands made red smears on Alton's deerskin jacket when he stooped and lifted him a little. There was no bronze in his comrade's face, but in place of it a curious yellow tinge, through which the <b>greyness</b> showed in patches, and with fingers that were strangely clumsy he held a flask to Alton's lips.|$|E
