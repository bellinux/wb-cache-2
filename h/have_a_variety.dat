5|$|Beetles <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> {{of ways to}} communicate, {{including}} the use of pheromones. The mountain pine beetle emits a pheromone to attract other beetles to a tree. The mass of beetles are able to overcome the chemical defenses of the tree. After the tree's defenses have been exhausted, the beetles emit an anti-aggregation pheromone. The species can stridulate to communicate.|$|E
5|$|Cacti <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> of uses: {{many species}} {{are used as}} {{ornamental}} plants, others are grown for fodder or forage, and others for food (particularly their fruit). Cochineal {{is the product of}} an insect that lives on some cacti.|$|E

5|$|Digital {{forensics}} investigations <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> of applications. The {{most common}} {{is to support}} or refute a hypothesis before criminal or civil (as part of the electronic discovery process) courts. Forensics may also feature in the private sector; such as during internal corporate investigations or intrusion investigation (a specialist probe into {{the nature and extent}} of an unauthorized network intrusion).|$|E
5|$|Insects {{are mostly}} soft bodied, fragile and almost defenseless {{compared}} to other, larger lifeforms. The immature stages are small, move slowly or are immobile, {{and so all}} stages are exposed to predation and parasitism. Insects then <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> of defense strategies to avoid being attacked by predators or parasitoids. These include camouflage, mimicry, toxicity and active defense.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many other}} parrots, kakapos <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> of calls. As {{well as the}} booms (see below for a recording) and chings of their mating calls, they will often loudly skraark to {{announce}} their location to other birds.|$|E

5|$|The extant Crocodylidae are twelve {{species in}} the genus Crocodylus, and two species in other genera. They <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> of snout shapes, but can be {{recognised}} because the fourth tooth of the lower jaw is visible when the mouth is closed.|$|E
5|$|The {{strategy}} appears paradoxical and counter-intuitive as {{a method}} of camouflage, since disrupting outlines depends on using patches of colour which contrast strongly with each other, so the patches are themselves conspicuous. While background matching works best for a single background, disruptive coloration is a more effective strategy when an animal or a military vehicle may <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> of backgrounds.|$|E

5|$|After the 1998 {{death of}} Ruby, the zoo's famous {{painting}} elephant, the zoo abandoned its elephant breeding program {{and began to}} focus on elephant behavior. The zoo is currently home to three Asian elephants that <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> of behavioral issues, the most common being aggression toward other elephants. One elephant is a former performer at a circus and was subject to mistreatment, while the other two were captured in remote regions where they were never properly socialized.|$|E
5|$|Among non-living things, snowflakes have {{striking}} sixfold symmetry: each flake's structure {{forming a}} record of the varying conditions during its crystallisation, with nearly the same pattern of growth on each of its six arms. Crystals in general <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> of symmetries and crystal habits; they can be cubic or octahedral, but true crystals cannot have fivefold symmetry (unlike quasicrystals). Rotational symmetry is found at different scales among non-living things including the crown-shaped splash pattern formed when a drop falls into a pond, and both the spheroidal shape and rings of a planet like Saturn.|$|E
5|$|Cerium was {{the first}} of the {{lanthanides}} to be discovered, in Bastnäs, Sweden by Jöns Jakob Berzelius and Wilhelm Hisinger in 1803, and independently by Martin Heinrich Klaproth in Germany. It was first isolated by Carl Gustaf Mosander in 1839. Today, cerium and its compounds <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> of uses: for example, cerium(IV) oxide is used to polish glass and is an important part of catalytic converters. Cerium metal is used in ferrocerium lighters for its pyrophoric properties.|$|E

5|$|Day-to-day {{killer whale}} {{behaviour}} generally consists of foraging, travelling, resting and socializing. Killer whales engage in frequent behaviour {{at the surface}} such as breaching (jumping {{completely out of the}} water) and tail-slapping. These activities may <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> of purposes, such as courtship, communication, dislodging parasites, or play. Spyhopping, a behaviour in which a whale holds its head above water, helps the animal view its surroundings.|$|E
5|$|In {{a change}} of {{direction}} in March 1882, L'Estrange applied to the Sydney City Council to establish a juvenile pleasure gardens at the Paddington Reservoir. The fun park was to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> of rides, a maze, merry-go-round and a donkey racecourse. L'Estrange proposed the park to be free entry with all monies being made via the sale of refreshments on site. While he was given permission, the park does not appear ever to have opened.|$|E
5|$|Somerset has few {{industrial}} centres, {{but it does}} <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> {{of light}} industry and high technology businesses, along with traditional agriculture and an increasingly important tourism sector, resulting in an unemployment rate of 2.5%.

Population growth in the county is higher than the national average.|$|E

5|$|The {{traditional}} {{names of}} the Latin and Greek letters are usually used for unmodified letters. Letters which are not directly derived from these alphabets, such as , may <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> of names, sometimes based on {{the appearance of the}} symbol or on the sound that it represents. In Unicode, some of the letters of Greek origin have Latin forms for use in IPA; the others use the letters from the Greek section.|$|E
5|$|A {{potential}} {{obstacle to}} the adoption of biological pest control measures is growers sticking to the familiar use of pesticides. However, pesticides <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> of undesired effects, including the development of resistance among pests, and the destruction of natural enemies; these may in turn enable outbreaks of pests of other species than the ones originally targeted, and on crops at a distance from those treated with pesticides. One method of increasing grower adoption of biocontrol methods involves letting them learn by doing, for example showing them simple field experiments, enabling them to observe the live predation of pests, or demonstrations of parasitised pests. In the Philippines, early season sprays against leaf folder caterpillars were common practice, but growers were asked to follow a 'rule of thumb' of not spraying against leaf folders for the first 30 days after transplanting; participation in this resulted in a reduction of insecticide use by 1/3 and a change in grower perception of insecticide use.|$|E
5|$|Archaea can be {{infected}} by double-stranded DNA viruses that are unrelated {{to any other}} form of virus and <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> of unusual shapes, including bottles, hooked rods, or teardrops. These viruses have been studied in most detail in thermophilics, particularly the orders Sulfolobales and Thermoproteales. Two groups of single-stranded DNA viruses that infect archaea have been recently isolated. One group is exemplified by the Halorubrum pleomorphic virus 1 ("Pleolipoviridae") infecting halophilic archaea and the other one by the Aeropyrum coil-shaped virus ("Spiraviridae") infecting a hyperthermophilic (optimal growth at 90–95°C) host. Notably, the latter virus has the largest currently reported ssDNA genome. Defenses against these viruses may involve RNA interference from repetitive DNA sequences that are related to the genes of the viruses.|$|E
