5|$|In the 22ndminute, a lofted through-pass from Carrick found Rooney on {{the left}} wing, but the Liverpudlian's cross was blocked by Touré and {{went out for a}} corner kick. The corner, taken by Giggs, found Ronaldo, but the Portuguese <b>got</b> <b>too</b> far under the ball and headed over. Precise passing from the Barcelona midfield got the Catalans moving upfield until a {{shoulder}} charge from Anderson sent Iniesta stumbling to the ground in the inside-left channel 30yards from goal. The consequent free kick was taken by Xavi, who sent the ball just wide of the near post. Another free kick followed, as Messi was bundled over by a double-challenge from Vidić and Carrick, but it came to nothing.|$|E
5|$|Zaphod, {{named after}} Zaphod Beeblebrox from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, was Flower's devoted partner and the {{dominant}} male of the Whiskers. As Zaphod assumed both roles by usurping, {{he tended to}} be edgy if Yossarian <b>got</b> <b>too</b> close to Flower. According to the Meerkat Manor: The Series Begins film, Zaphod was a roving Lazuli male before he joined the Whiskers. He was really born in the Vivian, not the Lazuil. He and his younger brother, Yossarian, visited the Whiskers {{at the same time}} in search of females. Flower's sister Viale, then the dominant female, chose Yossarian as her mate and he became the group's dominant male. Zaphod and Flower also mated, but Viale killed the resulting pups. After Viale's death, Flower assumed the role of dominant female and showed preference to Zaphod for her mate. Yossarian then left the group for an unknown length of time.|$|E
5|$|As {{the season}} concluded, the obvious {{standout}} draft choice for both leagues was Alabama quarterback Joe Namath. The Houston Oilers, {{in last place}} in the AFL East, had the number-one pick for the AFL. Both the Oilers and Jets realized that the Jets had a far better chance of signing Namath in competition with the NFL team which drafted him (as it turned out, the St. Louis Cardinals, formerly the Chicago Cardinals), and the Jets were able to acquire the number-one pick. Neither the Jets nor the Cardinals could sign Namath until Alabama played its {{final game of the}} season, the Orange Bowl, on January 1, 1965. Both the Jets and Cardinals negotiated with Namath's attorney, and when the price <b>got</b> <b>too</b> high for the Cardinals, the Giants secretly acquired Namath's NFL rights. Longtime Jets coach Walt Michaels admitted many years later that the Jets had signed Namath days before the game. On January 2, 1965, the Jets held a press conference to announce Namath's signing.|$|E

5|$|Finucane's {{start at}} No. 452 was unimpressive. On 3 May 1941 {{while on a}} {{recognition}} flight with his new commanding officer, Squadron Leader Roy Dutton, Finucane <b>got</b> <b>too</b> close and his propeller sliced through Dutton's tailplane. Finucane radioed Dutton immediately. Dutton attempted to abandon the aircraft but was too low and crash-landed, cracking several ribs but surviving. Finucane excused himself from error asserting that his Spitfire {{was the only one}} with a metal propeller—the others being elder Mark I's with wooden mounts—which gave him extra speed. In tight formation, this had caused the collision. Despite the incident, he was gazetted on 13 May and given temporary command of the squadron while Dutton was injured. While at 452 Finucane became a popular commander and encouraged a more relaxed atmosphere, which he believed would help him get more out of the Australian pilots. He was now in command of 23 pilots, 16 fighters and 130 ground crew.|$|E
5|$|The only {{portion of}} the Canadian assault that did not go as planned was the advance of the 4th Canadian Division, {{collapsing}} almost immediately after exiting their trenches. The commanding officer {{of one of the}} assaulting battalions requested that the artillery leave a portion of German trench undamaged. Machine-gun nests in the undamaged sections of the German line pinned down, wounded or killed much of the 4th Canadian Division's right flank. The progress on the left flank was eventually impeded by harassing fire from the Pimple that was made worse when the creeping barrage <b>got</b> <b>too</b> far ahead of the advancing troops. In view of the German defence, the 4th Canadian Division did not attempt a further frontal assault throughout the afternoon. Reserve units from the 4th Canadian Division came forward and once again attacked the German positions {{on the top of the}} ridge. Persistent attacks eventually forced the German troops holding the south-western portion of Hill145 to withdraw but only after they had run out of ammunition, mortar rounds and grenades.|$|E

25|$|Bumper boats: This {{ride was}} {{supposedly}} safer, but the engines often leaked gasoline, {{at least once}} requiring medical attention for one rider who <b>got</b> <b>too</b> much on his skin.

25|$|When Livingstone {{returned}} in 1853 to the Makololo's capital, Linyati, {{he found out}} that only shortly after her father's death she had stepped down in favour of her brother Sekeletu, who became a new king. In Livingstone's account the reason was her desire to have a stable husband and a family that was firmly hers, while as a ruler she was forced to alternate many husbands so that none <b>got</b> <b>too</b> much power.|$|E

25|$|Spectral {{analysis}} of white dwarfs' atmospheres often finds contamination of heavier elements like magnesium and calcium. These elements cannot originate from the stars' core, {{and it is}} probable that the contamination comes from asteroids that <b>got</b> <b>too</b> close (within the Roche limit) to these stars by gravitational interaction with larger planets and were torn apart by star's tidal forces. Up to 50% of young white dwarfs may be contaminated in this manner.|$|E
25|$|Sebottendorf {{tried to}} {{recapture}} Valeggio, was repulsed, and retreated to Villafranca. Colli sent Rukavina's brigade back {{to rejoin the}} Mantua garrison and took his cavalry to Villafranca. Melas gathered up the troops of the right center and fell back to Castelnuovo. He was soon joined by Hohenzollern's force. Lipthay soon abandoned Peschiera, pursued by the French. When one of Augereau's units <b>got</b> <b>too</b> close, Lipthay's cavalry cut it to pieces, inflicting 100 casualties for a loss of only nine Austrians.|$|E

On the par five 18th, Donald hit his {{approach}} shot into the green leaving six feet for birdie. Westwood attempted to follow him in close to the hole but <b>got</b> <b>too</b> much backspin on his pitch and the ball spun back into the water hazard. Westwood eventually chipped up from the drop zone and went on to make double bogey. Donald then holed his birdie putt to win the championship and in the process became the new world number one.|$|E

25|$|One Ranger, seventeen-year-old , {{who wanted}} to be in on the action, also died in the fighting. He was the son of camp cook, D. R. Smith and the {{youngest}} Ranger ever to die in the line of duty. Smith was apparently too inexperienced to fully appreciate McNelly's terse orders because he <b>got</b> <b>too</b> close to a wounded Mexican bandit; the bandit killed the boy before Smith even knew what was happening. Berry Smith was buried in the northwest corner of the Brownsville cemetery on June 16 with full military honors. The funeral was recorded as one of the finest the city had ever seen.|$|E
25|$|At around 3am, as {{the power}} of the waves {{increased}} and the tide rose, the ship started to break apart. This started a panic for the passengers still on the stricken ship and many were swept away trying to escape to the rocks. The ship then broke loose from the rocks and drifted towards the beach with many still clinging to the vessel. As it <b>got</b> <b>too</b> close to the shore it keeled over and many people still inside the ship drowned, the rest being thrown over the side and forced to swim to the shore. The captain and the first mate stayed with the ship until the end and escaped to safety.|$|E
25|$|The German {{occupation}} of the Channel Islands lasted from 30 June 1940 to 9 May 1945. During that time, the Channel Islanders had to live under and obey the laws of Nazi Germany and work with their occupiers {{in order to survive}} and reduce the impact of occupation. Given no guidance on how to behave by the British government, there were individuals who <b>got</b> <b>too</b> close to the enemy and a few who undertook resistance activities. Most {{had no choice but to}} accept the changes and depredations to their lives and hope that external forces would someday remove the forces of occupation. It was almost five years before the islanders experienced freedom again.|$|E

25|$|Steam {{locomotives}} required regular and, {{compared to}} a diesel-electric engine, frequent service and overhaul (often at government-regulated intervals in Europe and the US). Alterations and upgrades regularly occurred during overhauls. New appliances were added, unsatisfactory features removed, cylinders improved or replaced. Almost {{any part of the}} locomotive, including boilers, was replaced or upgraded. When service or upgrades <b>got</b> <b>too</b> expensive the locomotive was traded off or retired. On the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad two 2-10-2 locomotives were dismantled; the boilers were placed onto two new Class T 4-8-2 locomotives and the residual wheel machinery made into a pair of Class U 0-10-0 switchers with new boilers. Union Pacific's fleet of 3-cylinder 4-10-2 engines were converted into two-cylinder engines in 1942, because of high maintenance problems.|$|E
25|$|Lava flows are {{enormously}} {{destructive to}} property in their path. However, casualties are rare since flows are usually slow enough {{for people and}} animals to escape, though this {{is dependent on the}} viscosity of the lava. Nevertheless, injuries and deaths have occurred, either because they had their escape route cut off, because they <b>got</b> <b>too</b> close to the flow or, more rarely, if the lava flow front travels too quickly. This notably happened during the eruption of Nyiragongo in Zaire (now Democratic Republic of the Congo). On the night of 10 January 1977 a crater wall was breached and a fluid lava lake drained out in under an hour. The resulting flow sped down the steep slopes at up to , and overwhelmed several villages while residents were asleep. As a result of this disaster, the mountain was designated a Decade Volcano in 1991.|$|E
25|$|Powell next competed at the DKF Bislett Games in Oslo, Norway {{where he}} powered to a splendid victory with a wind-aided 9.72s. A week later, he competed at the Golden Gala in Rome, Italy, where he overcame {{a very poor}} {{reaction}} time at the start to take another victory in a World Leading time of 9.82s.It was reported that Powell ended his six-year contract with leading sports brand, Nike, due to sponsorship problems and rumours spread {{that he has a}} new contract with fast upcoming Chinese sports brand, Li-Ning. Asafa next competed in the 200m of the Jamaican Senior Trials where he won the final in 19.97s, his second fastest ever. There, for the first time, he promoted his new Li Ning outfit. Powell next competed in Gateshead where he got off to a terrific start, but lost to fast finishing Tyson Gay, who took the victory in 9.94s to Powell's 9.96s in a strong 1.7m/s headwind. Powell was not very disappointed as he mentioned that he <b>got</b> <b>too</b> relaxed, thus allowing Gay to outdo him in the final strides. The next race in Paris against Usain Bolt was a disappointing one. Although he had a good start, Bolt caught him at halfway point, and Asafa began to lose his fluent running form. He finished 2nd to Bolt in 9.91s, 0.07s slower than his rival, also into a slight headwind. Asafa said that he had a very bad race, which he hoped to improve in his upcoming races. Unfortunately for Powell, there was not a 'next race' for him. He picked up strains from his Paris meeting which aggravated to hamstring and back problems. Powell missed his next two outings where he was scheduled to clash against Bolt and Gay. Powell ended his splendid 2010 season on a disappointing note although he expressed satisfaction on the races that he competed for the year.|$|E
