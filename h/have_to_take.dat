5|$|According to Freitas, {{direct contact}} with civilizations {{significantly}} more advanced than humanity would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> place within the Solar System, as only the more advanced society would have the resources and technology to cross interstellar space. Consequently, such contact could only be with civilizations rated as Type II or higher on the Kardashev scale, as Type I civilizations would be incapable of regular interstellar travel. Freitas expected that such interactions would be carefully planned by the more advanced civilization to avoid mass societal shock for humanity.|$|E

50|$|About {{four weeks}} later the written exams were {{followed}} by the oral exams. All students <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> at least two exams and could take five exams at the most. The number of subjects and the subjects the students <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the exam in, individually were determined by the teacher's council for every student. Students who probably would graduate with honors <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> five oral exams.|$|R
50|$|However, {{students}} starting 5th grade also <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> an exam, which didn't {{guarantee that}} they would pass the exam for 9th grade because they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> this exam as well as everybody else (albeit they have a slight advantage by having been educated longer on a higher level).|$|R
5|$|Another {{problem with}} the NIF lasers is that the flashtubes create a {{significant}} amount of heat, which warms the laser glass enough to cause it to deform. This requires a lengthy cooling-off period between shots, on the order of 12 hours. In practice, NIF manages a shot rate of less than one shot per day. To be useful as a power plant, about a dozen shots would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> place every second, well beyond the capabilities of the NIF lasers.|$|E
5|$|Betances {{returned}} to Puerto Rico in April 1856. At the time, a cholera epidemic was spreading across the island. The epidemic {{made its way}} to Puerto Rico's western coast in July 1856, and hit the city of Mayagüez particularly hard. At the time, Betances was one of five doctors that would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> care of 24,000 residents. Both he and Dr. José Francisco Basora (who became lifelong friends and colleagues from that point on) would alert the city government and press the city managers into taking preventive action.|$|E

The letters were forwarded to NYSDOT, who responded that although the route was an important recreational route between New York and Vermont, the amount of traffic that the route carries was not high enough to warrant a four-lane divided highway. Additionally, the state would also <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> {{a significant number of}} properties along the roadway in order to widen it, which would affect the character of the area.|$|E
5|$|With Ore {{still not}} fully {{recovered}} from his injury and two inexperienced {{players on the}} Georgia side, {{it appeared that the}} teams' passing offenses would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> up the slack. Virginia Tech's Eddie Royal, with 452receivingyards, led both teams in receiving yardage coming into the game. Georgia's receiving corps was led by wide receiver Mohammed Massaquoi and tight end Martrez Milner. Massaquoi caught 28passes for 348yards and two touchdowns coming into the game, while Milner had 27receptions for 376yards and twotouchdowns.|$|E
5|$|An {{emergency}} subscription {{fund was}} established {{by some of the}} city's wealthiest citizens. Betances and Basora had the city's unsanitary slave barracks torched and a temporary camp set up for its dwellers. A large field at a corner of the city was set aside for a supplementary cemetery, and Betances set and managed a temporary hospital next to it (which was later housed in a permanent structure and became the Hospital San Antonio, the Mayagüez municipal hospital, which still serves the city). However, the epidemic struck the city soon after; Betances' stepmother and one of his brothers-in-law would die from it. By October 1856 Betances would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> care of the entire operation on his own temporarily.|$|E

5|$|Fearing {{that the}} guerrilla war would spread south, the South African {{government}} pressured Rhodesia {{to advance the}} process of détente with the politically moderate black governments of Zambia and Tanzania. As part of these negotiations, Smith's government agreed to release a number of black revolutionaries who had been indefinitely detained. After almost eleven years of imprisonment, Mugabe was released in November 1974. He moved in with his sister Sabina {{at her home in}} Highfield township. He was intent on joining the ZANU forces and taking part in the guerrilla war, recognising that to secure dominance of ZANU he would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> command of ZANLA. This was complicated by internal violence within the paramilitary group, predominantly between members of the Manyika and Karange groups of Shona.|$|E
5|$|For Lord Charlemont, Hogarth {{chose to}} paint the satirical Piquet, or Virtue in Danger (also known as The Lady's Last Stake, after a 1708 play by Colley Cibber), which, with echoes of Marriage à-la-Mode, shows an army officer {{offering}} an aristocratic lady a chance to recover the fortune she has just lost by gambling (with the implication that if she loses again, she will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> him as her lover). After Grosvenor saw this painting in Hogarth's studio in 1758, he asked Hogarth to paint a picture for him as well, under the same terms.|$|E

5|$|However, the {{widespread}} use of antipsychotic drugs has long been controversial. There are several reasons for this. First, antipsychotic drugs are perceived as very aversive by people who <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> them, because they produce a general dullness of thought and suppress the ability to experience pleasure. Second, it is difficult to show that they act specifically against psychotic behaviors rather than merely suppressing all types of active behavior. Third, they can produce a range of serious side effects, including weight gain, diabetes, fatigue, sexual dysfunction, hormonal changes, and a type of serious movement disorder known as tardive dyskinesia. Some of these side effects may continue long after the cessation of drug use, or even permanently.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Air Norway lost 1,300 {{passengers}} {{after the}} Norwegian Air Force {{decided to not}} permit their employees to travel from Ørland, but instead <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> cheaper flights from Trondheim, located about a two-hour drive away. The reduction in ridership, along with a strengthening of the Danish krone {{in relation to the}} Norwegian, caused Air Norway to lose NOK100,000 by August 2009. The mayor of Ørland stated at that he was working to make the route receive state grants as a PSO. In February 2010, the municipality granted NOK62,500 for Air Norway to run a television commercial during the semi-final of Melodi Grand Prix.|$|E
5|$|In {{people who}} develop acute liver failure {{or who are}} {{otherwise}} expected to die from liver failure, the mainstay of management is liver transplantation. Liver transplants are performed in specialist centers. The most commonly used criteria for liver transplant were developed by physicians at King's College Hospital in London. Patients are recommended for transplant if they have an arterial blood pH less than 7.3 after fluid resuscitation or if a patient has Grade III or IV encephalopathy, a prothrombin time greater than 100 seconds, and a serum creatinine greater than 300mmol/L In a 24-hour period. Other forms of liver support have been used including partial liver transplants. These techniques {{have the advantage of}} supporting the patient while their own liver regenerates. Once liver function returns immunosuppressive drugs are commenced and they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> immunosuppressive medication {{for the rest of their}} lives.|$|E

5|$|It {{was clear}} from the {{beginning}} of the CryoSat programme that an extensive series of measurements would be needed, both to understand interaction of the radar waves with the surface of the ice caps and to relate the measured freeboard of floating sea ice with its thickness. This latter, in particular, would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> account of snow loading. For sea ice, which moves as it is blown by the wind, it was also necessary to develop techniques which could give consistent results when measured from platforms travelling at different speed (scientists on the surface, helicopter-towed sounders, aircraft-borne radars and CryoSat itself). A number of campaigns were performed under a programme called CRYOVEX which aimed to address each of the identified areas of uncertainty. These campaigns continued through the development of the original CryoSat and were planned to continue after its launch.|$|E
5|$|Some {{theories}} {{attempt to}} explain Daily's tempestuous behaviour, {{one of which was}} put forth by Frank Vaccaro in his 1999 edition of The National Pastime. His theory explains that, in Daily's day, except in cases of injury, for a pitcher to be relieved from his position, another player already in the game would have to relieve him, and the pitcher would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a position in the field. His physical condition did not allow him many opportunities to play any other positions, so this compelled his managers to leave him in the game longer, even when his performance was declining. He was allowed to play in the field on several occasions, when the situation warranted it, as he is credited as playing three games in the outfield, two at second base, and one at shortstop.|$|E
5|$|Artillery {{powered by}} {{gunpowder}} {{was introduced to}} Europe in the 1320s and spread quickly. Handguns, which were initially unpredictable and inaccurate weapons, were not recorded until the 1380s. Castles were adapted to allow small artillery pieces– averaging between – to fire from towers. These guns were too heavy {{for a man to}} carry and fire, but if he supported the butt end and rested the muzzle {{on the edge of the}} gun port he could fire the weapon. The gun ports developed in this period show a unique feature, that of a horizontal timber across the opening. A hook on the end of the gun could be latched over the timber so the gunner did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the full recoil of the weapon. This adaptation is found across Europe, and although the timber rarely survives, there is an intact example at Castle Doornenburg in the Netherlands. Gunports were keyhole shaped, with a circular hole at the bottom for the weapon and a narrow slit on top to allow the gunner to aim.|$|E
