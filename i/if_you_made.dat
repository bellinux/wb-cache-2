500|$|In a Bloomberg West {{interview}} with Emily Chang on August 26, 2015, Andy Cunningham called it [...] "a wonderful film.... It's an incredible character {{study of a}} really complex man. Aaron [...] and Danny Boyle did a fabulous job with it." [...] Her portrayal by Sarah Snook was a [...] "small role but professionally done." [...] The film also portrays Andy as participating in the iMac launch, {{even though she was}} not working with Apple at that time. Journalist Walt Mossberg compared Steve Jobs to the Orson Welles film Citizen Kane, which was loosely based on the life of William Randolph Hearst. Mossberg has stated that while both films are aesthetically well-developed, Welles created a fictional set of characters in order to clarify that his film was a work of fiction. In contrast, according to Mossberg (who knew Jobs for 14 years), Sorkin's decision to use real instead of fictional names detracts from the quality of a film which appears to be a biopic and yet is a work of fiction. Mossberg states that [...] "the Steve Jobs portrayed in Sorkin's film isn't the man I knew. Sorkin chose to cherry-pick and exaggerate some of the worst aspects of Jobs' character, and to focus on a period of his career when he was young and immature [...] It would be as <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>made</b> a movie called JFK almost entirely focused on Kennedy's womanizing and political rivalries, and said nothing about civil rights and the Cuban Missile Crisis. Sorkin opts to end his story just as Jobs is poised to both reel off an unprecedented string of world-changing products and to mature into a much broader, kinder manager and person." ...|$|E
500|$|The ZX Spectrum {{version of}} Wonder Boy in Monster Land {{received}} preview coverage in Your Sinclair magazine. They praised the new additions {{made to the}} game that separated it from Wonder Boy; they called the game [...] "a good arcade adventure with a smattering of strategy thrown in". The magazine reviewed the game four months later. The reviewer noted the diverse level designs and many [...] "surprises" [...] the player will encounter, and they praised the game's learning curve, saying that it [...] "is well thought out and you really feel as <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>made</b> some progress before you die". It was criticized for its long multi-load times on the ZXSpectrum, its jumping mechanics in which the character [...] "floats around", and the graphics which was {{not as good as}} its predecessor. The reviewer called Wonder Boy in Monster Land [...] "a souped-up version of Wonderboy, which improves much on the original theory but at a slight cost to gameplay". Reviewers from UK-based magazine The Games Machine called it [...] "probably the best conversion you could expect on the Spectrum". Crash magazine praised the ZXSpectrum version of the game for its detailed sprites and smooth movements, playability, and combat system. The reviewer further commended the game for the differences that set it apart from the original Wonder Boy game, citing the cartoon-like feel and the vast arrays of enemies and items; just as in Your Sinclair, it was criticized for its slow multi-loading. Overall, the reviewer said the game is [...] "great fun for the experienced games player or the person just starting out in the Spectrum world". Sinclair User magazine praised its gameplay, citing the ability to stab enemies with a sword, to collect gold and items left behind, and to go into shops and pubs and buy equipment. Further praise went to the colorful and detailed graphics and animations, though they said they tend not to perform well in more complex background settings. Spanish magazine MicroHobby said that the ZXSpectrum version brought nothing new from its arcade counterpart, but the execution was good; they lauded the game's graphics and its challenging and addictive gameplay, but they criticized it for its lack of originality.|$|E
2500|$|Due to {{changing}} needs or personal preferences, {{a person may}} {{go back to work}} after retiring. In this case, it is possible to get Social Security retirement or survivors benefits and work at the same time. A worker who is of full retirement age or older may (with spouse) keep all benefits, after taxes, regardless of earnings. But, if this worker or the worker's spouse are younger than full retirement age and receiving benefits and earn [...] "too much", the benefits will be reduced. If working under full retirement age for the entire year and receiving benefits, Social Security deducts $1 from the worker's benefit payments for every $2 earned above the annual limit of $15,120 (2013). Deductions cease when the benefits have been reduced to zero and the worker will get one more year of income and age credit, slightly increasing future benefits at retirement. For example, if you were receiving benefits of $1,230/month (the average benefit paid) or $14,760 a year and have an income of $29,520/year above the $15,120 limit ($44,640/year) you would lose all ($14,760) of your benefits. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>made</b> $1,000 more than $15,200/year you would [...] "only lose" [...] $500 in benefits. You would get no benefits for the months you work until the $1 deduction for $2 income [...] "squeeze" [...] is satisfied. Your first social security check will be delayed for several months—the first check may only be a fraction of the [...] "full" [...] amount. The benefit deductions change in the year you reach full retirement age and are still working—Social Security only deducts $1 in benefits for every $3 you earn above $40,080 in 2013 for that year and has no deduction thereafter. The income limits change (presumably for inflation) year by year.|$|E
