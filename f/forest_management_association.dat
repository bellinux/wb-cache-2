40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{assessment}} of what in Finland {{are referred to as}} local <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> <b>associations</b> (LFMAs); the local units of a non-profit, forestry-promotion institution. First, the concept of organisational effectiveness is explored and an attempt is made to define it with respect to the LFMAs. The study then seeks to identify the environmental constraints, organisational characteristics and managerial practices differentiating the most effective and least effective associations. Discriminant analysis revealed four determinants of effectiveness: agrarian prosperity in the given area, activeness in marketing services to forest owners, the board of governors’ role, and goal setting practices. The results thus indicate that the comparison of managerial policies and practices among LFMAs can provide useful information for improving their effectiveness...|$|R
40|$|According to the {{establishment}} period (1998 to 2007) for sustainable <b>forest</b> <b>management,</b> the <b>forest</b> basic plan in Korea indicated that a long-teun <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> is required to real-ize the sustainable <b>forest</b> <b>management.</b> In this condition, most of private forest owners have abandoned or ignored to do the individual <b>management</b> of their <b>forests</b> even though the private forests occupied 700 / 0 of total forest land areas, which mean is that the p. rivate forest {{can be the most}} important main actor for forest management; thus adequate <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> by the private forest owners might not be expected. Therefore, new main actor for the forest manage-ment is required to replace the private forest owners who have performed as a main actor for the <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> so far. With this reason, various main actors for the <b>forest</b> <b>management,</b> such as <b>Association,</b> Business Corporation, Forest Owner's Association, Local Public Enterprise, and Logging Contractor, were introduced. In conclusion, the forest owner's association is the most adequate main actor for the <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> as a new because it is a forestry business corporation that has conducted the works and guidance related to the private forest, and also it prepared sufficient conditions for the <b>forest</b> <b>management,</b> such as <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> experts,, forestry technicians, capital, technology, and equipment.

40|$|As the Copenhagen {{negotiations}} on the form of post Kyoto mechanisms to tackle climate change approach, firmly on the agenda are proposals to include Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD). REDD could potentially generate {{tens of millions of}} dollars annually for Madagascar, bringing a huge potential to deliver forest conservation and improved livelihoods for the rural Malagasy. Efforts are underway in Madagascar to access REDD finance through a national working group and implementation of five REDD pilot projects. Many areas where the lowering of rates of deforestation is hoped to take place are part of the new generation of protected areas following the 2003 Durban Declaration. These new protected areas are frequently based on federations or grouping ofcommunity managed forests, which the literature and experience has shown to be highly problematic and which are rarely fully operational. If REDD is to prove to be an effective conservation tool, as well as an equitable mechanism to promote rural development several issues need to be addressed: More resources allocated to provide direct incentives to communities and to build local management capacity within their <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> <b>associations.</b> More serious efforts are needed to increase forest plantations and to improve management of existing plantations and natural forests, so as to meet the forest product needs of the whole Malagasy population. Basic human rights to have secure tenure of ancestral forest lands, and to derive a decent living from these needs to be recognised and empowered. The risk of ‘elite capture’ of the revenues generated by REDD should be avoided by the establishment of a transparent and independent scrutiny facility. Finally, it is proposed that improved dialogue between the social critics of conservation in Madagascar and the conservation movement itself should be encouraged...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to investigate how different household characteristics and policy-relevant variables affect individual household demand and willingness to engage in natural resource conservation activities in Burkina Faso. The thesis is based on four individual studies that examine Burkina Faso, a country rich in natural resources such as soil, water, and forests. The four studies use household data {{within each of the}} country's four regions: north, south, central and west. The data set contains information about actual choices, as well as household characteristics, socio-economic variables, and subjective perceptions concerning, among other things, long-term land use rights and soil degradation. Our different models estimate the effects of these variables on the probability of engaging in soil and forest conservation. We also estimate the demand of resource products such as non-timber forest products (NTFPs), and drinking water. The results of the statistical analysis indicate that forest and soil conservation activities by households are mainly determined by four policy-relevant variables: membership in community-based <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> <b>associations,</b> security of land use rights, training and education. Age and gender do not seem to have an effect on willingness to engage in natural resource conservation, although migrants are less likely to participate in forest surveillance. Further, an increase in household size decreases the participation in community work. Household size is shown to {{have a significant effect on}} the demand for NTFPs in the sense that larger households prefer imported or substituted products instead of NTFPs. Moreover, the analysis of the effects of price and income show that the two products that we expected to be substitutes are normal and complementary goods. Concerning the demand for drinking water, the price elasticity derived from the regression analysis shows that water demand is rather inelastic. Furthermore, the results also show that the income elasticities are positive, but smaller than one, implying not surprisingly that water seems to be a necessary good in Ouagadougou...|$|R

As {{a result of these}} efforts recognition has increased about the various ways in which many local communities are already actively managing their forest resources. The planning of development interventions to stimulate more efficient community involvement in <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> can often be based on such indigenous <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> systems. This paper alms to improve the understanding about the diversity and dynamics of indigenous <b>forest</b> <b>management.</b> The analysis consists of three parts. First an overview of the various types of indigenous <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> and their dynamics is presented. Subsequently, the basic principles of <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> are discussed. <b>Forest</b> <b>management</b> is characterized as involving a set of both technical activities and social arrangements for the protection and utilization of forest resources and the distribution of forest products. Three major categories of <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> practices are identified, e. g. controlled utilization of forest products, protection and maintenance of forest stands, and purposeful regeneration. The practices in the first category are both socially and biologically oriented, whereas the activities of the last two categories are biologically oriented. These principles are then used to develop a classification model of the various evolutionary phases in <b>forest</b> <b>management.</b> Along the lines of a similar model developed for exploitation of agricultural crops, various stages of <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> are distinguished along a gradient of increasing input of human energy per unit of exploited forest.

40|$|Abstract Using an {{interdisciplinary}} approach with focus on cultural studies, {{this study provides}} institutional perspectives to explain local scale deforestation and community-based <b>forest</b> <b>management.</b> Conducted in the North West Province of Cameroon (dominated by grassland covering about 90 % of the surface area), it argues that local people can depend on forests to improve their livelihood, while simultaneously manage few patches of threatened forest biodiversity. This can be achieved via a context-specific multi-stakeholder approach in <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> that involves local communities, traditional authorities and institutions, governments and NGOs. This study further argues that the supply of new institutions such as (in) community forestry is crucial for the sustenance of local scale <b>forest</b> <b>management.</b> In the Kilum-Ijim Forest Area, institutional supply has been legitimised by socio-cultural and political factors {{as well as the}} participation of local resource users in institutional crafting and <b>forest</b> <b>management.</b> The study illustrates that an unequal balance of power exists in some community-based <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> projects. But, local institutions and authorities can subtly renegotiate and regain power in <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> through traditional diplomacy and what B. Adrian et al (1999) call chiefing roles (that is, traditional authorities appropriating some State powers in <b>forest</b> <b>management),</b> influenced by the current democratic process in developing countries. Democracy in this perspective is an institution and instrument for decentralised <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> and community development. Hence the democratic dispensation in <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> provides a platform for the re-evaluation, re-invention, and implementation of cultural institutions and practices for <b>forest</b> <b>management.</b> Consequently, local people can use the reservoir of their traditional ecological knowledge, socially learn from formal <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> institutions and techniques.
