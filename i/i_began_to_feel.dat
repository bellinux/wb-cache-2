5|$|I {{realized}} {{that for a}} long time I had been holding onto this whole dogma of nonracism almost like a religion... But in the course of that debate <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> there was a lot lacking in the proponents of the nonracist idea... they had this problem, you know, of superiority, and they tended to take us for granted and wanted us to accept things that were second-class. They could not see why we could not consider staying in that church, and <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> that our understanding of our own situation in this country was not coincidental with that of these liberal whites.|$|E
500|$|While Butcher contributed about a {{third of}} the album's lyrics, most of the music on Loveless was written and {{performed}} by Shields. Shields stated, [...] "I'm actually the only musician on the record except for the Colm song [...]" [...] Shields assumed Butcher's guitarist duties during the recording process; Butcher admitted that she had not minded because she felt she [...] "was never a great guitarist". Bassist Debbie Googe did not perform on the album, though she received a credit on the album sleeve. Googe said, [...] "At the beginning I used to go down [...] most days but after a while <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> pretty superfluous so I went down less." [...] Butcher explained, [...] "for Kevin to actually translate to Debbie what he had in his head and play it right would have been an agonizing process." [...] "It wasn't collaborative at all", Alan Moulder said of the album's recording. [...] "Kevin had a clear view of what he wanted, but he never explained it." ...|$|E
500|$|Frank Proffitt, the Appalachian {{musician}} whose {{version of}} [...] "Tom Dooley" [...] the Trio rearranged, watched their {{performance of his}} song on a television show and wrote in reaction, [...] "They clowned and hipswung. Then they came out with 'This time tomorrow, reckon where I’ll be/If it hadn't a' been for Grayson/I'd a been in Tennessee.' <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> sorty sick. Like I’d lost a loved one. Tears came to my eyes. I went out and bawled on the ridge." [...] Proffitt had learned the song from {{his father and his}} grandmother, who had known Tom Dula and Laura Foster, the killer and the victim in the actual 1866 murder related in the song. Both Proffitt and fellow North Carolina musician Doc Watson sang the older version of the tune, which had [...] "a lively mocking tempo... that retained some of the ghastliness and moral squalor of an actual murder," [...] according to folk historian Robert Cantwell, who also notes that the Kingston Trio's version of the song left out several verses from the traditional lyric. The slower, harmonized Trio version of the Dooley song and other traditional numbers struck Proffitt as a betrayal of [...] "the strange mysterious workings which has made Tom Dooly [...] live..." [...] As recently as 2006, folk traditionalist and influential banjo master Billy Faier remarked: [...] "I hear and see very little respect for the folk genre" [...] in their music and described the Trio's repertoire as [...] "a mishmash of twisted arrangements that not only obscure the true beauty of the folk songs from which they derive, but give them a meaning they never had." ...|$|E

2500|$|On {{the morning}} of the 20th of last month, in the choir, after I had celebrated Mass I yielded to a {{drowsiness}} similar to a sweet sleep. [...] I saw before me a mysterious person similar to the one I had seen on the evening of 5 August. The only difference was that his hands and feet and side were dripping blood. This sight terrified me and what I felt at that moment is indescribable. I thought I should have died if the Lord had not intervened and strengthened my heart which was about to burst out of my chest. The vision disappeared and I became aware that my hands, feet and side were dripping blood. Imagine the agony I experienced and continue to experience almost every day. The heart wound bleeds continually, especially from Thursday evening until Saturday. Dear Father, I am dying of pain because of the wounds and the resulting embarrassment I feel deep in my soul. I am afraid I shall bleed to death if the Lord does not hear my heartfelt supplication to relieve me of this condition. Will Jesus, who is so good, grant me this grace? Will he at least free me from the embarrassment caused by these outward signs? I will raise my voice and will not stop imploring him until in his mercy he takes away, not the wound or the pain, which is impossible since I wish to be inebriated with pain, but these outward signs which cause me such embarrassment and unbearable humiliation....the pain was so intense that <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> as if I were dying on the cross.|$|E
2500|$|In {{discussing}} {{adapting the}} Boris Pasternak novel for television, screenwriter Andrew Davies revealed {{the task was}} [...] "daunting because the book is reckoned to be a masterpiece and the film is a great movie and one that I admire very much. Robert Bolt is the king of epic screenplay writers in my book. But as I got further into the book I kept thinking that I didn't agree with Robert Bolt about how to tell the story... and <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> much more excited." [...] He added, [...] "It was also a relief to find {{so much in the}} book that hadn't found its way into the first movie and could make great drama.... I thought the film does the spectacle really well. Rather surprisingly, it also explains the politics very well, but I thought it could do a better job on the relationships. It's probably a bit controversial, but I thought we could say more about Lara and Yuri and how they get together; about Lara's extraordinary situation {{at the beginning of the}} story and Yuri having a dreadful start to his life with his parents dying. None of these things really came out in the movie, but they are there in the book. I think that if they look at both versions now, people will probably think that this version in a lot of ways works better for our time. It's more contemporary. I think they'll find the performances are more subtle yet speak to us in our time. Maybe my script will seem out of date in 20 years time because a lot of them do, but watching the original film, I think the central performances look stilted and dated now." ...|$|E
