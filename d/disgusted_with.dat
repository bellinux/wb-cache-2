5|$|After 1863, {{relations}} between Mihail Kogălniceanu {{and his friend}} Vasile Alecsandri soured dramatically, as the latter declared himself <b>disgusted</b> <b>with</b> politics. Alecsandri withdrew to his estate in Mircești, where he wrote pieces critical of the political developments.|$|E
5|$|Bunk is <b>disgusted</b> <b>with</b> McNulty's {{serial killer}} scheme {{and tries to}} have Lester Freamon reason with McNulty.

Bunk resumes working the vacant house murders, leading to a murder warrant against Partlow for killing Michael's stepfather.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, Tammany Hall boss Carmine DeSapio led {{the effort}} to defeat Eleanor's son, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Jr., in the {{election}} for New York Attorney General. Eleanor grew increasingly <b>disgusted</b> <b>with</b> DeSapio's political conduct {{through the rest of}} the 1950s. Eventually, she would join with her old friends Herbert Lehman and Thomas Finletter to form the New York Committee for Democratic Voters, a group dedicated to opposing DeSapio's reincarnated Tammany Hall. Their efforts were eventually successful, and DeSapio was forced to relinquish power in 1961.|$|E

5|$|Mr. Burns sits in {{his office}} {{awaiting}} the union leader, who mysteriously disappeared after promising {{to clean up the}} union, so that they can discuss the proposed union contract. While perusing the contract, Mr. Burns becomes <b>disgusted</b> <b>with</b> the union demands and reminisces about simpler times in which disgruntled workers were simply walled up in coke ovens. Mr. Burns then decides to take on the union, and revokes their dental plan.|$|E
5|$|A pupil {{like myself}} had {{to submit to}} Balakirev a {{proposed}} composition in its embryo, say, even the first four or eight bars. Balakirev would immediately make corrections, indicating how to recast such an embryo; he would criticize it, would praise and extol the first two bars, but would censure the next two, ridicule them, and try {{hard to make the}} author <b>disgusted</b> <b>with</b> them. Vivacity of composition and fertility were not at all in favor, frequent recasting was demanded, and the composition was extended {{over a long period of}} time under the cold control of self-criticism.|$|E
5|$|If {{you read}} {{the records of the}} Royal Society and what they were doing in the 1660s, it's clear that at a certain point, some of these people– and I think Hooke was one of them– became a little bit <b>disgusted</b> <b>with</b> {{themselves}} and began excusing themselves when one of these vivisections was going to happen. I certainly don't think they turned into hardcore animal rights campaigners, or anything close to that, but I think after a while, they got a little bit sick of it and started to feel conflicted about what they were doing. So I've tried to show that ambivalence and complication in the book.|$|E

5|$|It's about obsession, {{and that}} can be scary because you're not in control and you don't know where it's going to stop. It says that, at any point in {{somebody}}'s life, when they loved somebody strongly enough and that person returns, a certain touch, a certain physical gesture can turn them from being defiant and <b>disgusted</b> <b>with</b> this person to being subservient again. And it's not just a pleasurable feeling that comes back, it's the complete terror and loss of control that comes back. And I think that's ultimately a great weapon.|$|E
5|$|Jaime Lannister and Bronn {{lead the}} Lannister army to Riverrun, where Lothar Frey and Walder Rivers attempt to coerce the Blackfish into {{surrendering}} the castle {{by threatening to}} execute Edmure Tully. The Blackfish calls their bluff and refuses to surrender. <b>Disgusted</b> <b>with</b> the Freys' incompetence, Jaime takes charge of the siege, orders Edmure to be bathed and fed, and attempts to parley with the Blackfish, warning him that the Lannisters will show no mercy to the Tullys {{if they do not}} surrender the castle. The Blackfish is not intimidated by Jaime's threats and dares him to try and seize the castle, declaring that the Tullys have enough provisions stockpiled to outlast a Lannister siege.|$|E

This halted production for a month {{to develop a new}} story. Screenwriter Barry Wong was brought in to write a new story about Tony Leung's character being an undercover police officer. After writing {{the first part of the}} script, Wong went on a vacation outside Hong Kong, where he died leaving the script unfinished.|$|E

5|$|After Stillman's defeat on May 14, {{the regulars}} and militia {{continued}} up the Rock River {{to search for}} Black Hawk. The militiamen became discouraged at {{not being able to}} find the British Band. When they heard about the Indian raids, many deserted so that they could return home to defend their families. As morale plummeted, Governor Reynolds asked his militia officers to vote on whether to continue the campaign. General Whiteside, <b>disgusted</b> <b>with</b> the performance of his men, cast the tie-breaking vote in favor of disbanding. Most of Whiteside's brigade disbanded at Ottawa, Illinois, on May 28. About 300 men, including Abraham Lincoln, agreed to remain in the field for twenty more days until a new militia force could be organized.|$|E

April (Aubrey Plaza) enters the contest in order to win the $600 prize, despite being <b>disgusted</b> <b>with</b> the concept of a beauty contest. She tries, unsuccessfully, to gain an advantage by sucking up to Leslie. Later, Pawnee police officer Dave Sanderson (Louis C.K.) visits Leslie at work to ask her out on a date. She initially accepts, but when Dave mistakes a photo of Madeleine Albright for Leslie's grandmother, Leslie becomes reluctant.|$|E
5|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) and Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin) {{meet with}} an {{important}} potential client, Christian (Tim Meadows), at Chili's. The client represents the governmental paper {{interests of the}} branch's entire surrounding county, and it is mentioned that taking him on could mean Dunder-Mifflin {{will not have to}} close one of its branches – a threat that had been looming for the past year. Jan is initially <b>disgusted</b> <b>with</b> Michael's antics (which began with Michael changing the meeting location from a hotel meeting room to Chili's without permission) and refusal to talk business, but discovers {{at the end of the}} day that there is a method to his madness when the client bonds with Michael, allowing him to close the deal.

Soon after Drake's death, Newton and Daniel then return to Cambridge and begin lecturing.|$|E
5|$|To {{meet the}} Dutch threat, Oerip {{intended}} to attack while the former colonists were still consolidating their forces, {{a plan that}} was quashed by the government's attempts at diplomacy. He preferred guerrilla tactics to formal military conflicts, once telling a subordinate that the best attack would be one with a hundred snipers hidden behind enemy lines. Oerip was strongly against the Renville Agreement, an ultimately unsuccessful treaty {{that led to the}} withdrawal of 35,000troops from western Java and the formalisation of the Van Mook Line between Dutch and Indonesian forces. He saw the agreement, ratified on 17January 1948, as a stalling tactic, giving the Dutch the chance to strengthen their forces. Meanwhile, Amir Sjarifuddin– by then also serving as prime minister– began culling the army, predominantly keeping leftist-leaning troops. <b>Disgusted</b> <b>with</b> what he perceived as the government's lack of trust in the military, Oerip tendered his resignation, although he continued to serve as an advisor to the Minister of Defence, Vice President Hatta.|$|E
