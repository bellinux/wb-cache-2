40|$|Wastewaters from coal-conversion {{processes}} contain {{phenolic compounds}} in appreciable concentrations. These compounds {{need to be}} removed so that the water can be discharged or reused. Oxidation in supercritical water is one potential means of treating coal-conversion wastewaters, and this project examined the reactions of model pollutants in supercritical water. The decomposition of cresols, hydroxybenzaidehydes, nitrophenols, and benzenediols was studied in dilute aqueous solutions in both the presence and absence of oxygen at 460 {degrees}C and 250 atm. Experimental data from the oxidation of these compounds were fit to global, power-law rate expressions. The resulting rate laws showed that the reactivity of the different isomers at 460 {degrees}C was {{in the order of}} ortho > para > meta for cresols and hydroxybenzaldehydes. Moreover, the CHO-substituted phenol was more reactive than the analogous CH{sub 3 }-substituted phenol, and all of these substituted phenols were more reactive than phenol itself. Identifying and quantifying the reaction products of incomplete oxidation allowed us to assemble a general reaction network for the oxidation of cresols in supercritical water.

Engineering the monomer composition of lignins offers an attractive option towards new lignins with reduced recalcitrance. The presented work describes {{a new strategy}} developed in Arabidopsis for the overproduction of rare lignin monomers to reduce lignin polymerization degree (DP). Biosynthesis of these 'DP reducers' is achieved by expressing a bacterial hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA hydratase-lyase (HCHL) in lignifying tissues of Arabidopsis inflorescence stems. HCHL cleaves the propanoid side-chain of hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA lignin precursors to produce the corresponding hydroxybenzaldehydes so that plant stems expressing HCHL accumulate in their cell wall higher amounts of <b>hydroxybenzaldehyde</b> and hydroxybenzoate derivatives. Engineered plants with intermediate HCHL activity levels show no reduction in total lignin, sugar content or biomass yield compared with wild-type plants. However, cell wall characterization of extract-free stems by thioacidolysis and by 2 D-NMR revealed an increased amount of unusual C 6 C 1 lignin monomers most likely linked with lignin as end-groups. Moreover the analysis of lignin isolated from these plants using size-exclusion chromatography revealed a reduced molecular weight.

Products are detected and characterized using time-of-flight mass spectrometry with both single photon (118. 2 nm; 10. 487 eV) and 1 + 1 resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) as well as matrix isolation infrared spectroscopy. Gas exiting the heated reactor (300 K [...] 1600 K) is subject to a free expansion after a residence time of approximately 100 µs. The expansion into vacuum rapidly cools the gas mixture and allows the detection of radicals and other highly reactive intermediates. By understanding the unimolecular fragmentation patterns of phenol (C 6 H 5 OH), anisole (C 6 H 5 OCH 3) and benzaldehyde (C 6 H 5 CHO), the more complicated thermocracking processes of the catechols (HO-C 6 H 4 -OH), methoxyphenols (HO-C 6 H 4 -OCH 3) and <b>hydroxybenzaldehydes</b> (HO-C 6 H 4 -CHO) can be interpreted. These studies {{have resulted in a}} predictive model that allows the interpretation of vanillin, a complex phenolic ether containing methoxy, hydroxy and aldehyde functional groups. This model will serve as a guide for the pyrolyses of larger systems including lignin monomers such as coniferyl alcohol. The pyrolysis mechanisms of the dimethoxybenzenes (H 3 C-C 6 H 4 -OCH 3) and syringol, a hydroxydimethoxybenzene have also been studied. These results will aid in the understanding of the thermal fragmentation of sinapyl alcohol, the most complex lignin monomer. In addition to the model compound work, pyrolyisis of biomass has been studied via the pulsed laser ablation of poplar wood. With the REMPI scheme, aromatic lignin decomposition products are directly and selectively detected. A number of these products are the lignin model compounds listed above, providing a direct link between the model compound studies and the pyrolysis of actual biomass...|$|R
40|$|The {{tricyclic}} indole and tetracyclic quinoline heterocyclic {{systems were}} chosen from Naresh Kumar (NK) library {{in terms of}} their structural similarity to compounds identified from WEHI library screening. It was also of a particular interest to modify the structure of WEHI 0088846 and test the new analogues against the designated cancer cells. A suitable methodology was developed for the preparation of novel dihydropyranoindoles via the Hemetsberger indole synthesis of arylethers, derived from corresponding <b>hydroxybenzaldehydes</b> with activated alkynes, and a thermal cyclisation in high boiling solvents. Biological studies showed that tetracyclic systems had significant cytotoxic activity at higher concentration against the neuroblastoma cancer cells. More importantly, these systems, at the lower concentration, considerably enhanced the SAHA toxicity. Encouragingly, the toxicity of designated systems on the normal human cells was found to be significantly less than the cancer cells. The nucleophilic substitution of methyl hydroxyindole esters with Î±-haloketones yielded the arylether ketones and subsequent cyclisation resulted in tricyclic and tetracyclic furoindoles. The attempts to cyclize the corresponding intermediates in the presence of catalytic amount of acid generated the desired tricyclic and tetracyclic furoindoles. The additional mono cyclized furoindoles with the non-cyclized methyl ketone were arised from methyl 4, 6 -dihydroxyindole- 2 -carboxylate. The individual cytotoxic efficency of furoindoles were found to be more favourable than the SAHA enhancement effect against the cancer cells. Interestingly, the non-cyclized intermediate provided the best IC 50 value at very low concentration. The first synthetic procedure to prepare the original hit compound WEHI 0088846 was reported and the modifications on the three key regions of compound afforded a range of analogues in good yields. The new hydrazone-hydrazide compounds were found to be cell specific towards the neuroblastoma cells and two derivatives displayed very low micromolar potency against the neuroblastoma cells. The most reactive position of the methyl 5, 6 -dibenzyloxyindole esters was determined via the Vilsmeier Haack reaction and formylated products were used for the design of novel indole-containing imines. The tested imine analogues were shown to have a significant potential for the reduction of Kelly cell viability at a concentration of 10 Î¼M compound alone...|$|R
40|$|Structure-radical {{scavenging}} activity relationships (SAR) among a {{great number}} of acid phenols and related compounds were studied using the Crocin Bleaching Assay (CBA) and/or other assays (DPPH•, ORAC, lipid oxidation), where necessary. The focus was on the activity of various hydroxybenzoic, hydroxyphenylacetic, hydroxyphenylpropanoic and hydroxycinnamic acids. Prior to estimation of antioxidant activity, the CBA protocol was in-house validated taking into account that reliability of SAR evaluation is often subjected to method limitations (e. g. ease and reproducibility). Consistency of experimental findings with Physical Organic Chemistry principles was also taken into account. A step by step chromatographic (HPLC, GC) and spectrophotometric examination of method performance with regard to probe, azo-initiator and test compound characteristics showed that: a) any authentic commercial saffron (origin, grade) can be used for probe preparation as long as certain precautions are taken (removal of interference, adjustement of crocin concentration, short-time storage of probe solution), b) AAPH-derived radical generation conditions such as preheatment are not critical, c) any phenolic compound (AH) meeting the criterion Log PAH vanillic acid). However, the activity order between the respective catechol acid derivatives strongly varied depending on the assay conditions. Homoprotocatechuic acid (-CH 2 COOH) was most active towards DPPH• in methanol while protocatechuic acid (–COOH) was most active under CBA conditions. CBA findings were meaningful when the acidity of –COOH and 4 -OH groups were taken into account. Under all assay conditions, extended conjugation to the side carbon chain of 4 - hydroxycinnamic acids was essential for the rapid scavenging of free radicals. Thus, caffeic and ferulic acids were considerably more active than their dihydrocounterparts. Apart from a better stabilization of the phenoxy radicals through resonance structures, the strong acidity of these compounds may contribute to their potency. The results indicate that CBA is suitable for evaluation of SARs among closely related compound bearing small structural differences. The importance of simple plant-derived acid phenols as efficient radical scavengers under conditions that imitate physiological ones is also highlightened. Investigation {{of the role of the}} – COOH group showed that reduction to –CHO or esterification with short-chain alcohols may render acid phenols even more potent towards peroxyl radicals. The greater antiradical activity found for some acid derivatives such as alkyl gallates (methyl- and propyl-gallate) and <b>hydroxybenzaldehydes</b> (vanillin, syringic aldehyde), also less hydrophilic than the respective acids, is promising for further studies and exploitation of natural sources. ...|$|R
