25|$|In the Controquerra DOC {{stretched}} out among five communes near the Marche border in northern Abruzzo, a novello style wine is produced from grapes {{that at least}} 30% of which has undergone carbonic maceration (a technique used in the French wine region of Beaujolais for the wine Beaujolais nouveau). This produces a very <b>fruity</b> <b>wine</b> with low tannins that can be consumed soon after the vintage.|$|E
25|$|Maurice O'Shea of Mountain View pioneered {{planting}} of Pinot noir {{which he used}} to blend with Shiraz. The Pinot noir grown in the warm Region IV climate of the Hunter exhibits very little varietal similarities with the Pinot noirs of Burgundy and Oregon where it tends to produce a low acid, <b>fruity</b> <b>wine.</b> While an obscure grape mostly associated with the fortified wines of Madeira, Verdelho has developed a niche in the Hunter Valley where its thick skin and high acids tolerate the humidity and heat.|$|E

50|$|Hergenfeld {{is known}} for its winegrowing, and its <b>fruity</b> <b>wines</b> bear the marks of the slaty soil of the Hergenfelder Berg (the Hunsrück itself is part of a vast slate {{formation}} called the Rhenish Massif).|$|R
25|$|Durif, or Petite Sirah, is a {{descendant}} of Syrah and Peloursin. It was propagated by and named after Dr. Francois Durif. Durif is a cross breed between the lesser known Peloursin and Syrah. Regions such as Rutherglen have achieved international regard for their Durif. This varietal is similar to Shiraz, but even more full bodied and tannic because of the smaller, thicker skinned grapes used. Petite Sirah is widely planted in California, where it is popular as a varietal (for example, by Bogle Vineyards), and especially blended with Zinfandel, which results in a rich, bold and <b>fruity</b> <b>wine.</b>|$|E
25|$|As a varietal wine, Merlot {{can make}} soft, velvety wines with plum flavors. While Merlot wines tend to mature faster than Cabernet Sauvignon, some {{examples}} {{can continue to}} develop in the bottle for decades. There are three main styles of Merlot — a soft, fruity, smooth wine with very little tannins, a <b>fruity</b> <b>wine</b> with more tannic structure and, finally, a brawny, highly tannic style made in the profile of Cabernet Sauvignon. Some of the fruit notes commonly associated with Merlot include cassis, black and red cherries, blackberry, blueberry, boysenberry, mulberry, ollalieberry and plum. Vegetable and earthy notes include black and green olives, cola nut, bell pepper, fennel, humus, leather, mushrooms, rhubarb and tobacco. Floral and herbal notes commonly associated with Merlot include green and black tea, eucalyptus, laurel, mint, oregano, pine, rosemary, sage, sarsaparilla and thyme. When Merlot has spent significant time in oak, the wine may show notes of caramel, chocolate, coconut, coffee bean, dill weed, mocha, molasses, smoke, vanilla and walnut.|$|E
25|$|The {{style of}} California Cabernet Sauvignon that first put California on the world's wine map at the Judgment of Paris {{is still a}} {{trademark}} style today. The wines {{are known for their}} concentration of fruits which produces lush, rich wines. Merlot became widely planted in the 1990s due to its wide popularity, and is still the highest selling of all varietal wines in the country. Many sites that were ill-suited for the grape began to produce harsh, characterless wines trying to model Cabernet. Merlot, when planted on better sites tend to produce a plush, concentrated style. The profile of Californian Pinot noir generally takes on a more intense, fruity style than the subtler, more elegant wines of Burgundy or Oregon. Until being passed up by Cabernet in 1998, Zinfandel was the most widely planted red wine grape in California. This was {{due in part to the}} wide popularity of White Zinfandel. Despite being made from the same grape, the only similarity between White and Red Zinfandel is the name. Zinfandel is a powerful, <b>fruity</b> <b>wine</b> with high levels of acidity and a jam-type flavor. White Zinfandel is a thin, slightly sweet blush wine. While the grape does have European origins, Zinfandel is considered a unique American style grape.|$|E
50|$|This terroir {{consists}} {{mainly of}} granite and volcanic soils with south-southwesterly exposure. Blessed {{with a unique}} microclimate due to Lake Bogács, this site has soils rich in minerals that result in distinctive, fresh and <b>fruity</b> <b>wines.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Negoska {{is a red}} Greek {{wine grape}} variety (Negushka) that is grown {{primarily}} in Central Macedonia. Around the town of Goumenissa the grape is blended with Xynomavro to produce very <b>fruity</b> <b>wines</b> with high alcohol levels.|$|R
50|$|Gamay-based {{wines are}} {{typically}} light bodied and <b>fruity.</b> <b>Wines</b> {{meant to be}} drunk after some modest aging {{tend to have more}} body and are produced by whole-berry maceration. The latter are produced mostly in the designated 'Cru Beaujolais' areas where the wines typically have the flavor of sour cherries, black pepper, and dried berry, as well as fresh-cut stone and chalk.|$|R
2500|$|Chenin B: a French grape {{from the}} Loire Valley, {{it is also}} grown in South Africa. It yields a very <b>fruity</b> <b>wine,</b> {{sometimes}} mineral, dry, or sweet depending on the soil. It can be kept {{for a long time}} and take on the noble rot ...|$|E
2500|$|Along {{with the}} internationally styled Merlots, Friuli {{produces}} some distinctive red wines {{from the local}} grape varieties. Tazzelenghe (meaning [...] "tonguecutter") produces a very tannic and <b>fruity</b> <b>wine</b> that mellows as it ages but maintains {{a good amount of}} its fruitiness. The Schioppettino (meaning [...] "gunshot" [...] and sometimes called Ribolla nera) also produces very tannic wines with spice and pepper notes behind the ripe fruit flavors. The best known local red wine variety is the Refosco dal peduncolo rosso (different from regular Refosco) which produces a herbal full bodied wine that ages well. Refosco is noted for its high acidity with blueberry and blackberry notes.|$|E
2500|$|Beaujolais {{wines are}} {{produced}} by the winemaking technique of semi-carbonic maceration. Whole grape clusters are put in cement or stainless steel tanks with capacities between [...] The bottom third of the grapes gets crushed {{under the weight of}} gravity and resulting must begins normal yeast fermentation with ambient yeasts found naturally on the skins of the grapes. Carbon dioxide is released as a byproduct of this fermentation and begins to saturate the individual intact grape berries that remain in the barrel. The carbon dioxide seeps into the skin of the grape and begin to stimulate fermentation at an intracellular level. This is caused, in part, by the absence of oxygen in the winemaking environment. This results in a <b>fruity</b> <b>wine</b> without much tannin. In the case of Beaujolais nouveau, this process is completed in as little as four days, with the other AOCs being allowed longer time to ferment. As the grapes ferment longer, they develop more tannins and a fuller body. Maximum length of the cuvaison for Nouveau wines is limited to 10 days.|$|E
5000|$|The use of {{carbonic}} maceration {{is closely}} associated with the production of Beaujolais nouveau wine from the Gamay grape in the Beaujolais region and some wines in the Rioja Alavesa and Jumilla areas of Spain. This grape lends itself well to the production of simple, <b>fruity</b> <b>wines</b> and Beaujolais winemakers have been able to create a unique identity based on this distinctive style.|$|R

50|$|The Gamay grape {{is thought}} to have {{appeared}} first in the village of the Gamay, south of Beaune, in the 1360s. The grape brought relief to the village growers following the decline of the Black Death. In contrast to the Pinot noir variety, Gamay ripened two weeks earlier and was less difficult to cultivate. It also produced a strong, <b>fruitier</b> <b>wine</b> in a much larger abundance.|$|R

25|$|As {{with many}} grapes that are widely planted, {{there is a}} wide range of quality and variety of Barbera wines from medium bodied, <b>fruity</b> <b>wines</b> to more powerful, intense {{examples}} that need cellaring. Some characteristics of the variety are more consistent—namely its deep ruby color, pink rim, noticeable levels of tannins and pronounced acidity. The acidity of Barbera make it a valued plantings in warm climate regions where acidification is usually needed. The color of Barbera makes it a value blending grape and it was historically used in the Barolo & Barberesco region to add color to the naturally light Nebbiolo grape.|$|R

25|$|Sangiovese di Romagna adapts to {{different}} soil types, producing richer, more full bodied and tannic wines {{in the central}} provinces of Forlì and Ravenna and lighter, <b>fruitier</b> <b>wines</b> in the western and eastern extremes of the regions near the border with Bologna and Marche. The grape seems to produce the highest quality wine in the sandstone and clay rich hills south of the Via Emilia near the Apennines which is covered by much of the Sangiovese di Romagna DOC zone. The higher summer time temperatures of this area gives more opportunity for Sangiovese to sufficiently ripen.|$|R
