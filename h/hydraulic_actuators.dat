5|$|The XF-104 had {{a radical}} wing design. Most {{supersonic}} jets use a swept or delta wing. This allows a reasonable balance between aerodynamic performance, lift, and internal space for fuel and equipment. However {{the most efficient}} shape for high-speed, supersonic flight had {{been found to be}} a small, straight, mid-mounted, trapezoidal wing of low aspect ratio and high wing loading. The wing was extremely thin, with a thickness-to-chord ratio of only 3.4%. The leading edges of the wing were so thin (0.016in/0.41mm) and so sharp that they presented a hazard to ground crews, and protective guards had to be installed during ground operations. The thinness of the wings meant that fuel tanks and landing gear had to be contained in the fuselage. The <b>hydraulic</b> <b>actuators</b> driving the ailerons were only one inch (25mm) thick to fit into the available space and were known as Piccolo actuators because of their resemblance to this musical instrument. The wings had electrically driven leading and trailing edge flaps to increase lift at low speed. The XF-104 did not feature the Boundary Layer Control System of the production aircraft.|$|E

40|$|A draw wire sensor is {{considered}} as a contact measurement method. It is normally {{used to measure the}} speed and position of a system. A draw wire sensor is convenient especially when a low cost solution and a small sensor dimension are desired. The objective {{of this paper is to}} describe the application of draw wire sensor in control tracking of electro <b>hydraulic</b> <b>actuator</b> system. This research started with the modelling of electro <b>hydraulic</b> <b>actuator</b> system by using system identification approach. During the data taking process, an experiment is conducted using electro <b>hydraulic</b> <b>actuator</b> test bed. A draw wire sensor is attached to the load of electro <b>hydraulic</b> <b>actuator</b> system to measure the output displacement when the system is injected with the desired input signal. Draw wire sensor is measuring the output displacement in millimeters and then the signal is converted to voltage reading regarding to the given input signal. The input and output signal is collected and is used in system identification technique to obtain the best mathematical model that can represent the electro <b>hydraulic</b> <b>actuator</b> system. Once a model is obtained, a Self Tuning Controller (STC) with Generalize Minimum Variance Control (GMVC) strategy is designed to control the tracking performance of the electro <b>hydraulic</b> <b>actuator</b> system.

25|$|The {{instantaneous}} {{attitude of}} the vehicle was compared with the desired vehicle attitude in the LVDC. Attitude correction signals from the LVDC were converted into control commands by the flight control computer. The required thrust direction was obtained by gimbaling the engines in the propelling stage to change the thrust direction of the vehicle. Gimbaling of these engines was accomplished through <b>hydraulic</b> <b>actuators.</b> In {{the first and second}} stages (S-IC and S-II), the four outboard engines were gimbaled to control roll, pitch, and yaw. Since the third (S-IVB) stage has only one engine, an auxiliary propulsion system was used for roll control during powered flight. The auxiliary propulsion system provides complete attitude control during coast flight of the S-IUB/IU stage.|$|E
25|$|In 1962 the IBM350 RAMAC {{disk storage}} unit was {{superseded}} by the IBM1301 {{disk storage unit}}, which consisted of 50 platters, each about 1/8-inch thick and 24 inches in diameter. Whereas the IBM350 used only two read/write heads which were pneumatically actuated and moved in two dimensions, the 1301 {{was one of the}} first disk storage units to use an array of heads, one per platter, moving as a single unit. Cylinder-mode read/write operations were supported, and the heads flew about 250 micro-inches (about 6µm) above the platter surface. Motion of the head array depended upon a binary adder system of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>actuators</b> which assured repeatable positioning. The 1301 cabinet was about the size of three home refrigerators placed side by side, storing the equivalent of about 21 million eight-bit bytes. Access time was about a quarter of a second.|$|E
25|$|According to AgustaWestland, the AW109 Power {{features}} various advanced avionics systems, {{these include}} a three-axis autopilot, an auto-coupled Instrument Landing System, integrated GPS, a Moving Map Display, weather radar, and a Traffic Alerting System. These systems {{are designed to}} reduce pilot workload (the AW109 can be flown under single or dual-pilot instrument flight rules (IFR)) and enable the use of night vision goggles (NVG) to conduct day-or-night operations. The AW109 has a forced trim system which can be readily and selectively activated by the controlling pilot using triggers located on the cyclic and collective which hold the control inputs at the last set position if activated. All critical systems are deliberately redundant for fail-safe operations; the hydraulic system, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>actuators,</b> and electrical system are all dual-redundant, while the power inverters are triple-redundant. The AW109 also has reduced maintenance requirements due to an emphasis on reliability across the range of components used.|$|E

The ventral and dorsal gun turrets were removed, as was the large dielectric radome housing the Uspeh radar system, which was replaced by a thermal imaging system located in a smaller fairing. This left the tail turret with twin 23-mm AM-23 cannons, along with electronic countermeasures, as the only defensive armament. The aircraft's search-and-targeting system featured Berkut (Golden Eagle) [...] A complex navigation system was integrated with the weapons targeting system. Structural differences included an airfoil change to the wing, expanding its area to [...] (...)

The most serious incident involved an A-36A shedding both wings when its pilot tried to pull out from a 450mph (724km/h) dive.

[...] Unimation later licensed their technology to Kawasaki Heavy Industries and GKN, manufacturing Unimates in Japan and England respectively.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{performance}} of a magnetorheological (MR) hydraulic power system is analytically and experimentally assessed. Four MR valves are implemented as a Wheatstone bridge hydraulic power circuit to drive a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>actuator</b> using a gear pump. The compact hydraulic power actuation system is a Wheatstone bridge network driving a conventional <b>hydraulic</b> <b>actuator.</b> A key advantage of using MR valves in hydraulic actuation systems is that the valves have no moving parts. This reduces complexity and enhances durability compared to conventional mechanical valves. In such a system, an MR fluid is used as the hydraulic fluid. A constant volume pump is used to pressurize the MR fluid. If a change in direction is required, the flow through each of the valves in the Wheatstone bridge can be controlled smoothly via changing the applied magnetic field. A magnetic field analysis is conducted to design a high-efficiency compact MR valve. The behavior and {{performance of}} the MR valve is {{expressed in terms of}} nondimensional parameters. The performance of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>actuator</b> system with a Wheatstone bridge network of MR valves is derived using three different constitutive models of the MR fluid: an idealized model (infinite yield stress), a Bingham plastic model, and a biviscous model. The analytical system efficiency in each case is compared to experiment, and departures from ideal behavior, that is, a valve with infinite blocking pressure, are recognized.
