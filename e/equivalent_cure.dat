40|$|Special {{consideration}} {{has to be}} {{made for}} the use of sub-lobar resection for ground-glass opacities. The recent work from Travis et al 3 describing adenocarcinoma in situ and minimally invasive adenocarcinoma, which describe small (, 3 cm), solitary adenocarcinomas consisting purely of lipid growth without invasion or, 0. 5 cm invasion, has been set apart from other NSCLCs because they should have 100 % 5 -year disease-free survival when completely resected. 3 These noninvasive tumors represent the ideal setting in which a lesser resection carries <b>equivalent</b> <b>cure.</b> The key feature that safely allows for this is the strong cor-relation between CT scan fi ndings and histopathology. 4 The ability to preoperatively identify noninvasive le-sions is a massive step forward in our understanding of NSCLC and should result in a corresponding advancement in treatment approach, with less radical resection and appropriate preservation of pulmonary parenchyma. Cancer treatment is always a balance of risk and benefi t. In stage IA NSCLC, high local control rates and favorable toxicity profi les of nonsurgical ablative technologies push surgeons to decrease interven-tional risk and improve long-term quality of life while not impacting the high potential for cure. Segmental resections preserve pulmonary parenchyma and rep-resent an excellent treatment option for many patients with early-stage disease. We need to be teach ing this pro-cedure to our residents along with appropriate guide-lines for its use. We need to continue to integrate it into treatment algorithms for stage IA NSCLC while we await randomized data supporting its routine use...|$|E
40|$|Summary Photodynamic therapy (PDT) using Photofrin {{was used}} in {{combination}} with a hypoxic toxin (mitomycin C, MMC) to treat four patients with recurrent skin metastasis of a mammary carcinoma. In precinical experiments an additive effect was found for the combination of MMC and PDT for treating subcutaneous RIFI tumours in mice. When interstitial PDT was combined with a low dose of MMC (administered 15 min before illumination), the Photofrin dose or light dose could be reduced {{by a factor of}} 2 in order to obtain <b>equivalent</b> <b>cure</b> rate or growth delay. In the clinical pilot study, a low dose of Photfrin (0. 75 mg kg-') was used for PDT alone (superficial illumination) or combined with low-dose MMC (5 mg m- 2). Different tumour areas were illuminated with or without a preceding infusion of MMC. Both tumour response and skin photosensitivity were scored. After 8 - 12 weeks of treatment, tumour cure could be achieved by administering light doses> 150 J cm- 2 for PDT alone and similar effects were obtained when light doses of 75 - 87. 5 J cm- 2 were given after infusion with MMC. In all cases necrotic tissue of both tumour and surrounding skin was observed, which lasted for a mean of 5 months (range 2 - 20 months). Skin phototoxicity, tested by using a standardised illumination of skin patches on the back, lasted maximally 3 weeks.

The probability of cure is inversely proportional to initial stage. The hazard rate of relapse is highest during the first three to five years and decreases gradually thereafter. Survival curves for operable breast cancer start to parallel the survival of the general population 15 to 25 years after diagnosis. Between a quarter to a third of patients with locally advanced and/or inflammatory breast cancer are curable with combined modality strategies and a small fraction of highly selected patients with overt metastatic breast cancer have lengthy complete remissions after chemotherapy or combined modality therapy.

To investigate whether the well-tolerated intravenous (i. v.) injection of cephalosporins {{may be of}} comparable gonocidal effect, levels of cefodizime, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin, in serum and tissue fluid (suction blister and cantharides blister fluid) were determined in six healthy men. Single doses of 1 g of cefodizime were injected i. v. and i. m. according to a randomized crossover design. On i. m. injection the drug was completely bioavailable, and the peak concentration in serum was 75 +/- 8 micrograms/ml. The terminal half-life of serum levels was 2. 4 h. Cefodizime concentrations in the blister fluids increased for 1. 5 to 3 h after the i. v. dose and for at least 3 h on i. m. administration. The concentrations of non-protein-bound cefodizime in blister fluid already exceeded the MIC for 90 % of Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains 10 min after i. v. injection and 20 to 30 min after the i. m. dose.

40|$|In {{order to}} further advance {{the state of}} the art in the {{electron}} beam processing of polymers and composites, it is necessary to better understand the development of cure-induced residual stresses. In situ measurement of electron beam cure-induced stress development is challenging due to the bombardment of specimens with intense beams of very high-voltage electrons. In this study, a custom fixture was designed to measure the deformation of an electron beam-cured specimen during processing and thereby to assess specimen stress state during the curing process. The unbalanced composite specimen consisted of two cured unidirectional carbon-epoxy laminates separated by a thin woven fibreglass carrier, which was infused by a layer of electron beam curable epoxy resin systems (Tactix 123 and CAT B). The out-of-plane specimen deformations were monitored during various electron beam irradiation schedules and subsequent thermal post-cure. The preliminary results confirmed that the apparatus was not affected by the irradiation and was capable of accurately measuring the specimen warpage during the cure. It was also shown that the electron beam-cured specimens exhibit a reduced residual stress state compared to <b>equivalent</b> thermally <b>cured</b> specimens. It was observed that the irradiation dose rate applied to a specimen is the main factor in the difference in the way residual stresses develop during electron beam curing.

In-situ measurement of stress development during EB irradiation is a challenging task. The instrumentation has to be adequately shielded from the high-energy electron beam. In this work, a special fixture was designed specifically to measure the warpage of a specimen throughout the EB curing process. The specimen consisted of a thin layer of epoxy resin (Tactix 123 or CAT B) embedded in a layer of glass scrim cloth, sandwiched between layers of steel and aluminum plates and also antisymmetric unidirectional carbon-epoxy laminates. The warpage of the specimens was monitored during and after irradiation at different constant dose rates. The results confirmed that the experimental instrumentation was not affected by the EB exposure and {{that it was possible to}} monitor the specimen warpage during the EB process.

The parameters used to describe the temporal distribution of NDVI and the time interval over which this distribution is assessed impact Relative Greenness and the inferred characteristics of the vegetation.

This paper presents a new method to assess fire danger that capitalizes on the abundance of environmental data available via remote sensing and applies this new method to the northern part of China. Using an analytical hierarchy process, a fire danger index was developed based on five environmental factors that are known to affect fire frequency and severity, including land surface temperature, vegetation <b>curing,</b> <b>equivalent</b> water thickness, vegetation continuity degree, and fuel weight. Data for these five factors were derived from satellite imagery, instead of point data, allowing for predictions to be made over a large geographic area.

The fire danger index was significantly correlated with air temperature and precipitation, suggesting that changes in these two environmental variables will affect the predictions of the index...|$|R
40|$|Mine {{backfilling}} is {{the process}} of filling large underground mining voids ("stopes") with a combination of tailings, water and small amounts of cement, to promote regional stability. Stopes are often in excess of 20 m x 20 m in plan dimensions and 40 - 50 m tall, and can be filled within a week. Barricades are constructed in all tunnels ("drives") that access the stope to contain the backfill material. In recent years, a significant number of failures of mine backfill barricades have occurred, resulting in the inrush of slurry backfill into the mine workings.

The purpose of this thesis is to apply soil mechanics principles to the mine backfill deposition process with the intent of providing some insight into these issues. In many cases, filling, consolidation and cement hydration all take place at a similar timescale, and therefore, to understand the cemented mine backfill deposition process it was necessary to appropriately couple these activities. Developing appropriate models for these mechanisms, and coupling them into a finite element code, forms the core of this thesis. Firstly, the fundamental processes involved in the cementing mine backfill deposition process are investigated and represented using theory founded on basic physical observations. Using this theory, one- and two-dimensional finite element models (called CeMinTaCo and Minefill- 2 D, respectively) are developed to fully couple each of the individual mechanisms. A centrifuge experiment was undertaken to investigate the interaction between consolidation and total stress distribution in a cementing soil. The results of this experiment were also used to verify the performance of Minefill 2 D. Due to scale effects, the centrifuge experiment was unable to fully couple the interaction of the cement hydration and consolidation timescales. To achieve this, a full scale field experiment was undertaken. The simulated behaviour achieved using Minefill- 2 D (with independently derived material properties) provided a good representation of the consolidation behaviour. Finally, a sensitivity study carried out using Minefill- 2 D is presented.

We treated Bolivian mucosal leishmaniasis due to Leishmania braziliensis with the oral agent mil-tefosine, 2. 5 mg/kg/day for 28 days, and followed-up for 12 months. Results. Seventy-two patients were evaluable. The cure rate for the 36 patients who had “mild ” disease (i. e., affecting nasal skin and nasal mucosa) was 83 %. The cure rate for the 36 patients who had more extensive disease (involving the palate, pharynx, and larynx) was 58 %. Patients refused to be randomized to parenteral agents, but the cure rate for an almost contemporary group who was receiving amphotericin B (45 mg/kg over 90 days) was 7 (50 %) of 14. Conclusions. In this unrandomized trial, oral miltefosine was at least as effective as heroic doses of parenteral amphotericin B. The cure rate for miltefosine was approximately <b>equivalent</b> to historical <b>cure</b> rates using parenteral pentavalent antimony for mild and extensive disease in neighboring Peru.

There is a lack of information on {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} different light curing systems. Purpose: The aim of this study was to compare the effect of LED and halogen light curing systems on the shear bond strength of orthodontic brackets. Materials and Methods: Forty extracted human premolars were etched with 37 % phosphoric acid and cleansed with water spray and air dried. The sealant was applied on the tooth surface and the brackets were bonded using Transbond adhesive (3 M Unitek,Monrovia, Calif). Adhesives were cured for 40 and 20 seconds with halogen (Blue Light, APOZA, Taiwan) and LED (Blue dent, Smart, Yugoslavia) light-curing systems,respectively. Specimens were thermocycled 2500 times (from 5 to 55 °C) and the shear bond strength of the adhesive system was evaluated with an Universal testing machine (Zwick GmbH, Ulm, Germany) at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min until the bracketswere detached from the tooth. Adhesive remnant index (ARI) scores were determined after bracket failure. The data were submitted to statistical analysis, using Mann-Whitney analysis and t-test. Results: No significant difference was found in bond strength between the LED and halogen groups (P= 0. 12).

40|$|CONTEXT: Abdominal sacrocolpopexy (ASC) {{represents}} the superior treatment for apical pelvic organ prolapse (POP) but {{is associated with}} increased length of stay, analgesic requirement, and cost compared with transvaginal procedures. Laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy (LSC) and robot-assisted sacrocolpopexy (RSC) may offer shorter postoperative recovery while maintaining <b>equivalent</b> rates of <b>cure.</b> OBJECTIVE: This review evaluates the literature on LSC and RSC for clinical outcomes and complications. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A PubMed search of the available literature from 1966 to 2013 on LSC and RSC with a follow-up of at least 12 mo was performed. A total of 256 articles were screened, 69 articles selected, and outcomes from 26 presented. A review, not meta-analysis, was conducted due {{to the quality of}} the articles. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: LSC has become a mature technique with results from 11 patient series encompassing 1221 patients with a mean follow-up of 26 mo. Mean operative time was 124 min (range: 55 - 185) with a 3 % (range: 0 - 11 %) conversion rate. Objective cure was achieved in 91 % of patients, with similar satisfaction rates (92 %). Six patient series encompassing 363 patients treated with RSC with a mean follow-up of 28 mo have been reported. Mean operative time was 202 min (range: 161 - 288) with a 1 % (range: 0 - 4 %) conversion rate. Objective cure rate was 94 %, with a 95 % subjective success rate. Overall, early outcomes and complication rates for both LSC and RSC appeared comparable with open ASC. CONCLUSIONS: LSC and RSC provide excellent short- to medium-term reconstructive outcomes for patients with POP. RSC is more expensive than LSC. Further studies are required to better understand the clinical performance of RSC versus LSC and confirm long-term efficacy.

40|$|Although {{cytochrome}} P 450 (CYP 450) enzymes {{are frequently}} up-regulated in mosquitoes resistant to insecticides, no regulatory motifs driving these expression differences with relevance to wild populations have been identified. Transposable elements (TEs) are often enriched upstream of those CYP 450 s involved in insecticide resistance, {{leading to the}} assumption that they contribute regulatory motifs that directly underlie the resistance phenotype. A partial CuRE 1 (Culex Repetitive Element 1) transposable element is found directly upstream of CYP 9 M 10, a cytochrome P 450 implicated previously in larval resistance to permethrin in the ISOP 450 strain of Culex quinquefasciatus, but is absent from the equivalent genomic region of a susceptible strain. Via expression of CYP 9 M 10 in Escherichia coli we have now demonstrated time- and NADPH-dependant permethrin metabolism, prerequisites for confirmation of a role in metabolic resistance, and through qPCR shown that CYP 9 M 10 is > 20 -fold over-expressed in ISOP 450 compared to a susceptible strain. In a fluorescent reporter assay the region upstream of CYP 9 M 10 from ISOP 450 drove 10 � expression compared to the <b>equivalent</b> region (lacking <b>CuRE</b> 1) from the susceptible strain. Close correspondence with the gene expression fold-change implicates the upstream region including CuRE 1 as a cis-regulatory element involved in resistance. Only a single CuRE 1 bearing allele, identical to the CuRE 1 bearing allele in the resistant strain, is found throughout Sub- Saharan Africa, {{in contrast to the}} diversity encountered in non-CuRE 1 alleles. This suggests a single origin and subsequent spread due to selective advantage. CuRE 1 is detectable using a simple diagnostic. When applied to C. quinquefasciatus larvae from Ghana we have demonstrated a significant association with permethrin resistance in multiple field sites (mean Odds Ratio ¼ 3. 86) suggesting this marker has relevance to natural populations of vector mosquitoes. However, when CuRE 1 was excised from the allele used in the reporter assay through fusion PCR, expression was unaffected, indicating that the TE has no direct role in resistance and hence that CuRE 1 is acting only as a marker of an as yet unidentified regulatory motif in the association analysis. This suggests that a re-evaluation of the assumption that TEs contribute regulatory motifs involved in gene expression may be necessar...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The primary {{objective}} of this pilot study was to test the hypotheses that (i) depth of cure and (ii) compressive strength of dental composites cured with either a light emitting diode (LED) based light curing unit (LCU) or a conventional halogen LCU do not differ significantly. The second {{objective of this}} study was to characterise irradiance and the emitted light spectra for both LCUs to allow comparisons between the units. METHODS: Dental composite (Spectrum TPH, shades A 2 and A 4) was cured for 40 s with either a commercial halogen LCU or a LED LCU, respectively. The LED LCU uses 27 blue LEDs as the light source. The composites' depth of cure was measured for 10 samples of 4 mm diameter and 8 mm depth for each shade with a penetrometer. The results were compared using a Student's t-test. Compressive strengths were determined after 6 and 72 h, for six samples of 4 mm diameter and 6 mm depth for each shade after being polymerised for 40 s from each end of the mould. Groups were compared using a three way ANOVA. RESULTS: The conventional halogen LCU cured composites significantly (p < 0. 05) deeper (6. 40 mm A 2, 5. 19 mm A 4) than did the LED LCU (5. 33 mm A 2, 4. 27 mm A 4). Both units cured the composite deeper than required by both ISO 4049 and the manufacturer. A three way ANOVA showed that there were no significant differences in the compressive strengths of samples produced with either the LED LCU or the halogen LCU (p = 0. 460). Significant differences in compressive strength of samples stored for 6 and 72 h (p = 0. 0006) and of samples of different shades (p = 0. 035) were found as confirmed by the three way ANOVA. The light spectra of both units differed strongly. While the halogen LCU showed a broad distribution of wavelengths with a power peak at 497 nm, the LED LCU emitted most of the generated light at 465 nm. The LED LCU produced a total irradiance of 350 mW cm- 2 whereas the halogen LCU produced a total irradiance of 755 mW cm- 2. SIGNIFICANCE: The results showed that both units provided sufficient output to exceed minimum requirements in terms of composites' depth of cure according to ISO 4049 and the depth of cure and the composites' compressive strength stated by the manufacturer. Compressive strengths of dental composites cured under laboratory conditions with a LED LCU were statistically <b>equivalent</b> to those <b>cured</b> with a conventional halogen LCU. With its inherent advantages, such as a constant power output over the lifetime of the diodes, LED LCUs have great potential to achieve a clinically consistent quality of composite cure...|$|R

(1995) Physiological changes in kiwifruit during a curing period and incidence of B. Cinerea during storage. Acta Horticulturae, 398, 233 - 240 In vitro germination of B. cinerea isolates from diseased blueberry, camellia, grapes, kiwifruit and strawberry were compared at Massey University (Palmerston North) and pathogenicity on kiwifruit at both Massey University {{and at the}} New Zealand Institute for Crop and Food Research (Levin). An average of 74. 4 % of spores germinated on agar when the concentration was 5. 9 x 10 4 but only 62. 8 % when it was 1. 5 x 10 6. Percentage spore germination on agar did not indicate relative pathogenicity on kiwifruit {{and there was no}} significant difference in disease incidence of fruit inoculated with different isolates. The effect of culture medium and of age of culture from which conidial inoculum was prepared were evaluated by growing B. cinerea on malt agar, potato dextrose agar and autoclaved kiwifruit leaves for seven, 18 or 28 days. Each fruit was inoculated with one drop of a 0. 05 % Tween 20 suspension containing 1, 000, 5, 000, 25, 000 or (Levin only) 125, 000 spores per drop. Disease incidence was proportional to inoculum concentration. There was no significant effect of colony age. The highest disease incidence at Massey University was with inoculum produced on malt agar whereas at Crop and Food Research it was with inoculum produced on autoclaved kiwifruit leaves. All further inoculation work was carried out using the K 3 isolate from Massey University grown on Malt agar for 10 - 14 days. The ability of B. cinerea conidia to survive temperature/humidity regimes that could be used for curing kiwifruit was tested by exposing conidia on glass slides to combinations of 0, 10, 15, 25 or 30 °C with low (90 %) relative humidities for two, four, six or eight days. Both the percentage germination and the speed of germination decreased at the higher temperatures and with longer exposure times. The effect of temperature during curing on subsequent infection levels was investigated in 1992, of humidity in 1993 and of both temperature and humidity in 1994. After harvest, each fruit was inoculated with 125, 000 spores (1992) or 25, 000 spores (1993 and 1994). In 1994 dry conidial application using a paintbrush was also included. The greatest curing effect was obtained at 10 °C. Disease incidence increased at 0 °C and the curing effect diminished at temperatures above 10 °C. Fruit cured at 20 °C and at 30 °C softened rapidly and developed a high incidence of disease. In 1994 a three day curing period was used and 10 °C again gave the lowest subsequent disease incidence. After twelve weeks coolstorage (1993) there was less disease in fruit cured at 89 - 95 % relative humidity than at lower humidities. In 1994 comparable results were obtained. The effect of curing regimes on fruit physiology showed that ethylene production increased and rate of respiration decreased with higher curing temperature but both increased with incubation time. There was no consistent pattern of treatment effect on ethylene production or on rate of respiration during subsequent coolstorage. Fruit firmness decreased with higher curing temperatures and as the curing period was extended. Firmness fluctuated with harvest and in general decreased with storage although a satisfactory firmness was maintained throughout coolstorage from all treatments. There was no consistent relationship between temperature/time of incubation and total soluble solids content during curing and during storage. As the period of storage increased glucose and fructose content of fruit increased. pH remained constant in fruit from all treatments and there was no consistent relationship between acid buffering capacity measured as citric acid <b>equivalent</b> and <b>curing</b> temperature/incubation times during subsequent coolstorage. For all experiments, weight loss increased with increased curing temperature or with decreased relative humidity. Kiwifruit stem scars consisted of two main tissue systems: Ground and vascular. Parenchyma, collenchyma and idioblasts containing raphides were the main components of the ground tissue. The vascular system consisted of xylem vessels, phloem and cambium. There was no evidence of anatomical structures blocking the xylem vessels in Botrytis infected fruit cured at 0 °C or at 10 °C. Samples from both showed some evidence of thickening of the parenchyma cell walls in contact with conidial hyphae. Positive reactions to lignin, suberin and reducing compounds were observed in all treatments. Suberin development in xylem and parenchyma scar tissue was found at 10 °C but not at 0, 20 or 30 °C. Initial relative humidity ranges of 34 - 80 %, 75 - 90 % and 100 % were tested during coolstorage at 0 °C in 1992 and 40 - 59 %, 65 - 80 % and 92 - 97 % in 1994. Inoculum levels applied to the stem scar were 5000 and 25000 spores/ml respectively and infection levels were evaluated after 12 weeks coolstorage. There was no definite pattern in ethylene production and rate of respiration during the incubation period. In both, 1992 and 1994 experiments weight loss increased as relative humidity decreased. TSS increased during incubation for all treatments. Firmness decreased with incubation time and after three months coolstorage for all treatments. In the second experiment of 1994 there was a more marked effect of relative humidity on firmness. Fruit firmness decreased with harvest maturity. In the 1992 experiment fruit disease decreased as incubation time increased and in 1994, infection levels decreased as relative humidity increased...|$|R
