50|$|The {{quantity}} J is not path-independent for monotonic mode I and mode II {{loading of}} elastic-plastic materials, so only a contour {{very close to}} the crack tip gives the energy release rate. Also, Rice showed that J is path-independent in plastic materials when there is no non-proportional loading. Unloading is a special case of this, but non-proportional plastic loading also invalidates the path-independence. Such non-proportional loading is the reason for the path-dependence for the <b>in-plane</b> <b>loading</b> modes on elastic-plastic materials.|$|E
50|$|Layers of {{different}} materials may be used, {{resulting in a}} hybrid laminate. The individual layers generally are orthotropic (that is, with principal properties in orthogonal directions) or transversely isotropic (with isotropic properties in the transverse plane) with the laminate then exhibiting anisotropic (with variable direction of principal properties), orthotropic, or quasi-isotropic properties. Quasi-isotropic laminates exhibit isotropic (that is, independent of direction) inplane response but are not restricted to isotropic out-of-plane (bending) response. Depending upon the stacking sequence of the individual layers, the laminate may exhibit coupling between inplane and out-of-plane response.

40|$|The {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the contact between the elastic bodies subjected to a constant normal load and a varying tangential loading in two directions of the contact plane. For uni-axial <b>in-plane</b> <b>loading,</b> the Cattaneo-Mindlin superposition principle can be applied even if the normal load is not constant but varies as well. However, this is generally not the case if the contact is periodically loaded in two perpendicular in-plane directions. The applicability of the Cattaneo-Mindlin superposition principle guarantees the applicability of the method of dimensionality reduction (MDR) which {{in the case of a}} uni-axial <b>in-plane</b> <b>loading</b> has the same accuracy as the Cattaneo-Mindlin theory. In the present paper we investigate whether it is possible to generalize the procedure used in the MDR for bi-axial <b>in-plane</b> <b>loading.</b> By comparison of the MDR-results with a complete three-dimensional numeric solution, we arrive at the conclusion that the exact mapping is not possible. However, the inaccuracy of the MDR solution is on the same order of magnitude as the inaccuracy of the Cattaneo-Mindlin theory itself. This means that the MDR can be also used as a good approximation for bi-axial <b>in-plane</b> <b>loading...</b>|$|E

40|$|The Counter-Rotating Open Rotor (CROR) concept, though {{promising}} {{a much better}} propulsive efficiency than future turbofans, still presents challenges regarding installation on aircraft, noise and certification. Thus, industries and research centers want to develop methodologies for the prediction of performance, aerodynamic loads and acoustics that should be adapted {{to each of the}} design phases. One of the major requirements for moderate-cost methodologies is the accuracy in the prediction of <b>in-plane</b> <b>loads,</b> as they are a major concern in terms of structural sizing, vibrations and fatigue, as well as aircraft stability and balancing. This paper gives a physical insight into CROR <b>in-plane</b> <b>loads</b> thanks to several simulations in HOST, a comprehensive code for the aeromechanic simulation of helicopters based on the lifting-line theory. It shows first some of the main contributors to the phase lag of these <b>in-plane</b> <b>loads.</b> Then, to improve these predictions, an unsteady curved lifting-line theory has been implemented in HOST code. Previous works have addressed the prediction of <b>in-plane</b> <b>loads</b> for the case of a single propeller in high-speed conditions and in incidence. In this paper, the unsteady curved lifting-line methodology is assessed by comparing CFD URANS computations and HOST simulations for the case of a CROR in high-speed conditions and in incidence. Propulsive performance, <b>in-plane</b> <b>loads</b> and blade loadings are compared and discussed.

By assuming a radial power law variation of Young’s modulus and constant value for Poisson’s ratio, the governing differential equations for plane stress conditions, and general <b>in-plane</b> <b>loading</b> conditions are studied. The elastic solutions are obtained in closed form and, in order to describe localized interface damage between the ring and the plate, two different interface conditions (perfectly bonded and frictionless contact) are studied. The formulae for the stress concentration factors are explicitly given for uniaxial, biaxial and shear <b>in-plane</b> <b>loading</b> conditions and comparisons with interface hoop stress values are performed. The solutions are investigated to understand the role played by the geometric and graded constitutive parameters.

A system, built up of a steel frame, a single glass pane and a flexible {{adhesive bonded}} joint across the full thickness of the glass pane was subjected to a concentrated horizontal <b>in-plane</b> <b>load</b> at the top. Experiments with square glass pane sizes showed that the system had a very small inplane stiffness, a glass-steel contact at large horizontal <b>in-plane</b> <b>loads</b> and a good residual capacity. The parametric studies by means of finite element models only focused on the variation of the geometry of the glass pane. The behaviour of the system mainly depends on the stiffness of the adhesive bonded joint. At larger horizontal in-plane displacements, systems with rectangular glass pane sizes have two glass-steel contacts. The mechanic models well predict the in-plane stiffness of the system, the largest maximum principle stress and the maximum normal and shear stresses in the adhesive bonded joint. The horizontal <b>in-plane</b> <b>load</b> and the horizontal in-plane displacement at the top at the first glass-steel contact are also well predicted. The criteria are the limitation of the horizontal in-plane displacement at the top (serviceability) or the strain rate of the adhesive bonded joint (strength).

40|$|It {{is known}} that the {{aeroelastic}} stability of elastic plates significantly decreases in low supersonic flow. A further reduction may arise due to compressive <b>in-plane</b> <b>loads,</b> which {{can be caused by}} deformations of the adjacent structure. Thus, this is an important subject in the design of supersonic aircraft or rockets. Encouraged by recent studies that have shown an increase in aerodynamic damping due to a turbulent boundary layer, the present study applies three different aerodynamic models coupled with the von Kármán plate equation to show that there is as well a significant enlargement of the static stability regions of a flat plate subjected to quasi-static <b>in-plane</b> <b>loads</b> at Mach 1. 2. However, it has also been found that, despite a turbulent boundary layer, the critical dynamic pressure for flutter almost drops to zero if the <b>in-plane</b> <b>load</b> approaches the critical load for Euler buckling. Further analysis on postcritical flutter revealed that a flexible panel subjected to a boundary layer behaves similarly to a panel in inviscid flow at a lower dynamic pressure, leading {{to the conclusion that the}} turbulent boundary layer scales down the effective dynamic load. This result further shows that the aeroelastic design of flexible plates based on inviscid flow models is a conservative approach. Representative results have been discussed by means of bifurcation curves, modal participation analysis, frequency spectra, phase plots, and Poincaré maps...|$|R

This contribution deals with the development of an intrinsic hybrid composite made up of a continuous fibre-reinforced plastic, in which a metallic insert is integrated.

This work is performed through the determination of stress states due to both thermal tempering and <b>in-plane</b> <b>loading.</b> The modeling of the thermal tempering is performed with the FE software Abaqus and additional user subroutines. Experiments on industrial tempering line with specific set-up allow the determination of the air flow in the hole and then of the forced convection coefficients. The radiative heat transfer is also modeled numerically and the semi-transparency of glass in the near infrared is considered. In order to calculate residual stresses, the visco-elasticity of glass and the structural relaxation phenomena are taken into account. The computed stresses are checked against photo-elastic measurements. As various holes are considered, this study allows to determine the hole geometry for which the tempering process is the most effective. For the study of the consequences of <b>in-plane</b> <b>loading,</b> a large experimental campaign has been performed. The studied connection is derived from countersunk supports. The influences of different parameters as the hole geometry, the nature of thewasher between glass andmetallic connector aswell as the glass-washer material friction coefficient were investigated. The modeling of these tests is performed with the FE software Abaqus. This modeling takes into account the ductility of the materials, the friction and the clearances between the parts.
