60|$|From Virginia's airy {{situation}} {{one could}} look over a vast, far-reaching panorama of mountain ranges and deserts; {{and whether the}} day was bright or overcast, whether the sun was rising or setting, or flaming in the zenith, or whether night and the moon held sway, the spectacle was always impressive and beautiful. Over your <b>head</b> <b>Mount</b> Davidson lifted its gray dome, and before and below you a rugged canyon clove the battlemented hills, making a sombre gateway through which a soft-tinted desert was glimpsed, with the silver thread of a river winding through it, bordered with trees which many miles of distance diminished to a delicate fringe; and still further away the snowy mountains rose up and stretched their long barrier to the filmy horizon--far enough beyond a lake that burned in the desert like a fallen sun, though that, itself, lay fifty miles removed. Look from your window where you would, there was fascination in the picture. At rare intervals--but very rare--there were clouds in our skies, and then the setting sun would gild and flush and glorify this mighty expanse of scenery with a bewildering pomp of color that held the eye like a spell and moved the spirit like music.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—With {{the recent}} {{introduction}} of low cost <b>head</b> <b>mounted</b> displays (HMDs), prices of HMD-based virtual reality setups dropped considerably. In various application areas personal <b>head</b> <b>mounted</b> displays can be utilized {{for groups of}} users to deliver different context sensitive information to individual users. We present a hardware setup that allows attaching 12 or more HMDs to a single PC. Finally we demonstrate how a collaborative, educational, augmented reality application is used by six students wearing HMDs on a single PC simultaneously with interactive framerates.

This can be {{underwater}} work by a commercial diver, or getting through tight restrictions for a cave or wreck diver. With a <b>head</b> <b>mount</b> {{there is a greater}} risk of dazzling other divers in the vicinity, as the lights move with the diver's head, and this arrangement is more appropriate for divers who work or explore alone. Helmet mounts are common for commercial work which is often monitored by a helmet mount closed circuit video camera.|$|E

A stem extends from the ball which terminates at the <b>head</b> <b>mount.</b> They tend to have fewer parts than other types of tripod heads due to their simple mechanism, but the parts must be precisely machined to fit well together and provide smooth movement, increasing their average price. Ballheads offer the convenience of simple controls, but are lacking in terms of precise movements, making specific alignment and image positioning a challenge.|$|E
