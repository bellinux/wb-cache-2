500|$|When they {{informed}} {{them of the}} title, their record label's American office e-mailed them about there being a [...] "Coexist" [...] bumper sticker. Croft said that [...] "I know it has that connection, but <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> right word. It's cool, I guess? It's a nice message? Everybody getting along?" ...|$|E
500|$|Michael Caine as John Cutter, {{the stage}} {{engineer}} (ingenieur) {{who works with}} Angier and Borden. Caine had previously collaborated with Nolan and Bale in Batman Begins. Nolan said that even though <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> character of Cutter was written for Caine, it was not. Nolan noted that the character was written [...] "before I'd ever met" [...] Caine. Caine describes Cutter as [...] "a teacher, {{a father and a}} guide to Angier". Caine, in trying to create Cutter's nuanced portrait, altered his voice and posture. Nolan later said that [...] "Michael Caine’s character really becomes something of the heart of the film. He has a wonderful warmth and emotion to him that draws you into the story and allows you to have a point of view on these characters without judging them too harshly." ...|$|E

5000|$|A {{spokesman}} for the Air Force Research Laboratory described {{his experience as a}} test subject for the system: [...] "For the first millisecond, <b>it</b> just <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> skin was warming up. Then it got warmer and warmer and you <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> was on fire. ... As soon as you're away from that beam your skin returns to normal and there is no pain." ...|$|R
500|$|Commenting on the {{controversy}} the book generated, Steiner admitted to literary journalist and critic Ron Rosenbaum (author of Explaining Hitler) {{that he too}} was disturbed by it, adding that his fictional Hitler had gotten the better of him, [...] "golem- or Frankenstein-like". He said that <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> book [...] "wrote me". Steiner {{also pointed out that}} the novella is not only about his thoughts on the Holocaust, but also about the horrific events that took place in countries like Cambodia, Vietnam, El Salvador and Burundi: [...] "My feeling is that one has to grapple with the abyss if one can." [...] In his 1997 memoir, Errata: An Examined Life, Steiner remarked that had he known what the response to The Portage and its stage interpretation would be, he would have made the novella [...] "my foremost business".|$|E
500|$|Super Mario World was {{the first}} title in the series to be {{developed}} for the upcoming Super Nintendo Entertainment System (known as the Super Famicom in Japan). As such, the team anticipated some difficulty in working with new and more advanced hardware. Tezuka recalled that the software tools were not yet fully developed and thus the team had to [...] "go along with starting something new". Miyamoto expressed optimism as he acknowledged that the team no longer had restrictions on certain mechanics such as scrolling {{and the number of}} colours which they could implement. As a hardware experiment, the team ported Super Mario 3 to the Super Famicom and discovered that <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> same game despite the improved colours and sprites. From that point on Miyamoto realised the team's ultimate goal would be to make the most out of the new hardware in order to create something [...] "totally new".|$|E
500|$|The 2 hour series finale, titled [...] "One Day More", {{aired on}} Sunday 4 June 2006 in a prime-time slot, at 8:30 pm. The finale focuses on Tom's {{attempts}} {{to reconnect with}} his family, and recover from his debilitating illness, whilst dealing with criminal charges brought against him by a vengeful ex-officer {{as well as the}} fact that the Mount Thomas police station, which he loves so dearly, may be closed down. It also features the return of former cast member Damian Walshe-Howling, reprising his role as Adam Cooper, still very bitter about his treatment by Tom. Rather than ending in [...] "a hail of bullet or a bomb explosion", the producers wanted to give the record-breaking series a gentle and fitting farewell to celebrate its life - [...] "We did not want to blow everyone up," [...] producer Gus Howard said, [...] "It is a gentle grounding. <b>It</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> right thing to do.".|$|E

5000|$|... "Whole Damn Year" [...] {{was written}} by Blige along with {{producer}} Knox Brown and musician Emeli Sandé. Commenting on its creation, Sandé stated: “I wrote this song and I love this song, but I didn’t {{think that it was}} a song for me for some reason ... And as soon as Mary heard it and connected to <b>it,</b> <b>it</b> really <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> song had found its natural and true home.” ...|$|R
500|$|... "Chair Model" [...] was {{the third}} episode of the series {{directed}} by Jeffrey Blitz. Blitz had previously directed [...] "The Convict" [...] and [...] "The Negotiation". The episode was written by B. J. Novak, who plays temporary worker turned corporate manager Ryan Howard. Novak was originally going to name the episode [...] "Michael Dating", but the title could have potentially been a spoiler because fans with DVRs would have seen it before [...] "Dinner Party" [...] aired and deduced that Michael and Jan's relationship had completely fallen apart. For a while, [...] "Parking" [...] {{was going to be}} the title, but even that was decided against because that refers to the subplot, and also because it was generic and boring even by the show's no-frills-titles standard. Eventually, someone suggested [...] "Chair Model", which was eventually kept as the name. Originally, Novak wrote Jim putting Dwight through a [...] "phony management training", but NBC pointed out that <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> writers had done it before even though they had not. As a group, the writers tried to think of a new idea for the plot; they considered having Pam move in with Jim, but they thought that first the two should be engaged.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, Rhimes said she tried {{to talk him out}} of quitting, explaining: [...] "I looked in his face and he was really sure. <b>It</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> right thing for him." [...] However, in another interview, Knight said of his exit: [...] "My five-year experience proved to me that I could not trust any answer that was given [...]" [...] Knight was [...] "at peace" [...] with his departure, saying: [...] "There just comes a time when it's so clear that moving on is the best decision." [...] However, Heigl tried to talk Knight out of leaving, saying: [...] "I didn't think it was the right decision. I felt like some of the problems could be worked through. But by the time it came to fruition, I was [...] for him because he was ready to go." [...] On the topic of losing a US$14 million contract, Knight commented: [...] "From an outsider's perspective, I get the [...] 'He's just a spoiled actor, he doesn’t know how good he has it.' There are a lot of people who would like to be in my position. But in the end, I need to be fulfilled in my work." ...|$|E
500|$|The animators and {{character}} designers {{had a lot}} of discussion about what Frank Grimes should look like. He was originally designed as a [...] "burly ex-marine guy with a crew cut", but would later be modeled after Michael Douglas in the movie Falling Down and director Jim Reardon's college roommate. Hank Azaria provided the voice of Frank Grimes, even though such a role would normally have been performed by a guest star. The producers decided Azaria was more suitable because the role involved a great deal of frustration and required extensive knowledge of the show. Azaria felt that the role should instead go to William H. Macy. According to Azaria, [...] "I based the character on William Macy. I can't really copy him vocally, but I tried to get as close as I could and copy his rhythms and the way he has that sort of seething passion underneath that total calm exterior." [...] The producers worked a lot with Azaria to help him perfect the role, and gave him more guidance than they normally would. Azaria felt that it was the role he worked hardest on, adding [...] "I think it's the one we did the most takes on, the most emotional, <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> one I worked on the hardest from a performance point of view, in preparation and in execution." ...|$|E
5000|$|Dean McGrath said: [...] "We knew Matt before, he's a Brisbane based {{producer}} and engineer, {{and we knew}} him on more of a personal basis {{as a friend of}} ours. And he recorded the second EP that we released…we had a few options for recording, but in <b>the</b> end <b>it</b> just <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> right decision to work out of home in Brisbane and to do it with Matt.|$|R
5000|$|Amy Ratcliffe of IGN {{gave the}} episode a 9.1 out of 10, saying [...] "The spring return of Once was {{creative}} {{and seemed to}} infuse the show with fresh energy. <b>It</b> even <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> actors were more comfortable with each other. Hopefully the new curse {{and the introduction of}} the Wicked Witch keeps things lively." [...] Though she did criticize the absurdity of Emma having been dating a flying monkey for eight months.|$|R
5000|$|The album's {{title was}} chosen by Ed Roland. [...] "It kinda fits not only the band, but {{personally}} what we've been through over the years," [...] Roland told Melissa Ruggieri of Access Atlanta. [...] "Things happen and you keep moving." [...] Roland later told Empty Lighthouse Magazine, [...] "It's like a second wind for us <b>it</b> just <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> title related to what we're doing which is getting back to doing what we love." ...|$|R
2500|$|After {{driving for}} Williams for four full seasons, Montoya found the McLaren Mercedes car unpredictable, often {{claiming}} <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> steering wheel was not [...] "attached" [...] {{to the rest}} of the car.|$|E
2500|$|Frightened Rabbit {{released}} {{a new song}} [...] "Fields of Wheat" [...] on July 11, 2017.

2500|$|In {{a review}} from Rickey.org, Nick Roman said, [...] "Last week, I was pretty miffed about Once Upon A Time and its {{treatment}} of Regina (Lana Parrilla). While I ultimately liked the episode, <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> show was continuing to use her as a punching bag to move the plot forward. Need something bad to happen {{to one of our}} characters? Just take it out on Regina! Granted, it’s a formula that has served Once Upon A Time in the past, but at this point, it just felt repetitive. That’s why “Only You” and “An Untold Story” provided such a fresh change of pace for a season finale that not only sets up the next phase of the story, but also promises to put Regina in a more central role." ...|$|E
5000|$|Kristen Elizabeth of TV Equals {{gave the}} episode a {{positive}} review, saying [...] "I just didn’t feel the spark in this episode. <b>It</b> <b>felt</b> more <b>like</b> <b>the</b> writers were dialing it in. Even Donna {{felt a little}} off, and she’s usually my favorite character. I think I might have been expecting too much, but {{considering the fact that}} The Cleveland Show took a few weeks off, there was ample time to turn in a better polished episode than this".|$|R
5000|$|About the album, Brightman said: [...] "I {{wanted to}} record an album with a Middle Eastern feel. <b>It</b> just <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> {{right way to}} go, just a feeling at first, which is how I begin all my albums". [...] "I have always loved that whole Arabian Nights feeling. Much {{of what we have}} created derives from my {{childhood}} reading. I was a C.S. Lewis fan. I <b>like</b> <b>the</b> idea of parallel worlds, faraway lands, mystery - I've traveled a huge amount over the years, which has influenced me immensely".|$|R
5000|$|Elemeno P is the self-titled third studio {{album of}} New Zealand rock band Elemeno P. It was {{released}} on May 26, 2008.

2500|$|In June 2015, for the 15th {{anniversary of}} the show, the cast and showrunners reunited for a special panel at the ATX Television Festival. When asked about a {{possible}} revival, Sherman-Palladino told the audience [...] "I'm sorry, there's nothing in the works at the moment." [...] The hype generated by the reunion, however, empowered Sherman-Palladino to pitch new episodes and encouraged Netflix to produce them. In October 2015 – eight years after the show had ended – TVLine reported that the streaming channel {{struck a deal with}} Warner Bros. to revive the series in a limited run, consisting of four 90-minute episodes, written and directed by Amy and Daniel Palladino. The Palladinos explained that <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> right time creatively to continue the story, and that the freedom provided by Netflix made it possible.|$|E
2500|$|Series creator Jordan Weisman {{noted that}} the game had a [...] "difficult development", and went through many {{different}} creative directions. [...] Throughout the development process, Weisman worked with the game designers to ensure that [...] "the essence of the [...] IP was coming through." [...] When development of Crimson Skies: High Road to Revenge was first assumed by FASA Studio, it was conceived that the game be made into an [...] "interactive movie," [...] a concept that would have involved an elaborate storyline {{and a large number}} of cutscenes. [...] This process would have needed a linear mission design, potentially restricting gameplay. [...] Programmer Patrick Schreiber later noted about the [...] "playable movie" [...] concept that [...] "It looked great on paper, but [...] was difficult to implement in a way where <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> player had some control over what was happening." ...|$|E
2500|$|GameSpy's Will Tuttle and Sal Accardo also {{praised the}} {{graphics}} and online mode, but they too criticized the single player campaign. [...] "Historical Campaign [...] gets very confusing because you frequently switch sides from battle to battle", stated Tuttle. He added that <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> game's campaign was [...] "tacked on {{to allow people}} without PS2 online to have fun." [...] 1UP.com's Andrew Pfister followed suit, also praising the graphics. [...] "Visually, Battlefront is exceptional. Never before have the Star Wars battles been so well recreated and detailed". He criticized the game's AI, however. He {{felt that it was}} too easy to defeat them, and that they often did not follow commands issued by the player. As with other reviewers, Pfister felt the single player mode was the weak point of the game, citing the PlayStation 2 version specifically for players without online access. Overall, he felt the problems with the game were outweighed by its qualities. [...] "Battlefront manages to stand tall as a great game that does the best job we've yet seen of playing out the battles of the Star Wars movies." ...|$|E
5000|$|Ed Kowalczyk's lyrics on {{this album}} return to the spiritual {{territory}} of The Distance to Here. Guitarist Chad Taylor explained that the tensions between Kowalczyk {{and the other three}} members that eventually caused the band to split from him surfaced in 1999, and had grown worse during the album's recording sessions. [...] "I wasn't sure how our rocker fanbase would feel about the lyrics." [...] He expressed his frustration with the album by adding, [...] "Jim Wirt (producer) worked really hard to fashion a contemporary album, but <b>it</b> never <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Live I loved." ...|$|R
5000|$|VentureBeat's McKinley Noble gave Crimson Dragon a low 35 out of 100 score, {{criticizing the}} game's [...] "boring, {{repetitive}} missions" [...] and [...] "flat, impersonal story," [...] stating that <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> nothing <b>like</b> <b>the</b> director's previous Panzer Dragoon efforts. Noble also blamed Microsoft's push to move Crimson Dragon from a 2012 Xbox 360 release to an Xbox One launch title, noting that [...] "the final product is a rushed, homogenized mess {{of a game}} that fails {{to live up to}} its loosely associated pedigree." ...|$|R
5000|$|This {{album was}} {{released}} {{to celebrate the}} 50th anniversary of reggae music and of Jamaican independence. In {{an interview with the}} Miami New Times, Mr. Vegas says [...] "Mikey Bennett had approached me about going in a different lane. He could hear my sound fitting songs <b>like</b> Toots and <b>the</b> Maytals' [...] "Sweet and Dandy" [...] and Hopetown Lewis' [...] "Take It Easy". We started recording, and <b>it</b> just <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> type of music that helped set the foundation of Jamaican music. At the same time it is our 50th anniversary of reggae music and our 50th anniversary of independence this year." ...|$|R
2500|$|With most of {{the album}} being revamped, other musicians joined the project, {{including}} Midi Mafia, RedOne, Toby Gad, Frank Ocean, and Brian Kennedy, the latter of which was consulted to replace Cox as the album's executive producer. Together, they crafted a bunch of new songs, including [...] "Freedom", [...] "One Thing" [...] and [...] "Today" [...] which Norwood later described as sounding [...] "more true to the sound" [...] that she had initially envisioned for the album. However, in early 2008, her A manager, Brandon Creed, presented Norwood several demo tracks that were produced by Rodney Jerkins, including [...] "Right Here (Departed)". Her former main producer on previous albums such as Never Say Never (1998) and Full Moon (2002), Jerkins hadn't worked with Norwood since 2002, due to conflicting schedules and a disagreement on her decision to work with Timbaland on Afrodisiac in 2003. Again, the album was reconstructed, with Jerkins taking over executive duties. On her decision to collaborate with Jerkins, Norwood commented: [...] "With Rodney being the person who produced , I, of course, wanted to go from there because of our history and all the music we have made in the past. <b>It</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> {{right thing to do}} [...] I wanted to see where that chemistry would take us creatively this time round." [...] With Jerkins on board, providing the bulk of Human, the sound of the album shifted drastically, with Norwood and her team abandoning most R records in favour of his international pop sounds.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{occurrence}} {{that influenced}} the episode happened while Parker and Bill Hader were having breakfast outside a café. During the meal, the two heard a sudden buzzing noise {{that turned out}} to be a drone flying down the street. Parker said of this: [...] "We didn't know who was flying it and it was one of those moments where you're like 'oh shit this is really different'." [...] Parker continued: [...] "That thing's just flying around and there's some guy looking at us. <b>It</b> really <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> future, and not in a good way future." ...|$|R
5000|$|Midnight Rescue! {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{successful}} combinations of educational and entertaining games. It has received lukewarm to positive reviews. Users at Abandonia gave it a rating of four out of five, saying that [...] "while the 'action' stopped for the educational parts, many of the stories relate to the game (being played), so <b>it</b> never <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> (<b>the</b> game was left)." [...] A review at Home of the Underdogs gave Midnight Rescue! two thumbs up and their Top Dog Award due to the strength of its ability to teach and entertain at the same time.|$|R
5000|$|Coleen {{said she}} had instigated the reformation after {{speaking}} to her manager.
