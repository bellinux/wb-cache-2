I can't comprehend that yet. Years from now, though, I'll be able to say I played with Rickey Henderson, and I imagine it will be like saying I played with Babe Ruth." [...] Padres general manager Kevin Towers said, [...] "I get e-mails daily from fans saying, 'Sign Rickey.' ...I get more calls and e-mails about him than anybody... We've had some special players come through San Diego. But there's an aura about him nobody else has." ...|$|E

[...] With the additional power, Sucker Punch was able to [...] "have more characters on-screen, more complicated shaders, and much greater layering". For the game, a new method of ambient occlusion (AO) was developed, a hybrid of precomputed AO and dynamic AO. The new method was used to render contact shadows and self-occlusion for moveable objects and was meant to complement the other methods of AO already used.|$|E

Bannon witnessed a younger sorority sister's unabashed infatuation with the older sister. She recalls it was an awkward situation, even though the older sorority sister was [...] "unfailingly gracious" [...] to the younger one. In recognizing the younger woman's attractions, she began to suspect her own sexuality. She said, [...] "I {{saw a lot of}} it happening and I didn't {{know what to make of}} it. I don't even <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> it—I was absolutely consumed with it, it was an extraordinary thing." [...] Another sorority sister was physically remarkable, very tall—almost , with a husky voice and boyish nickname, that Bannon imagined was a blend of Johnny Weissmuller and Ingrid Bergman. She recalled entering the communal restroom and seeing the sister, [...] "both of us in underwear, and experienc(ing) a sort of electric shock", and trying not to stare at her. In 1954, she graduated with a degree in French and soon married an engineer whose job made them relocate frequently.|$|E

500|$|For {{the screen}} adaptation, Spielberg {{wanted to stay}} with the novel's basic plot, while omitting Benchley's many subplots. He {{declared}} that his favorite part of the book was the shark hunt on the last 120pages, and told Zanuck when he accepted the job, [...] "I'd like to do the picture if I could change the first two acts and base the first two acts on original screenplay material, and then be very true to the book for the last third." [...] When the producers purchased the rights to his novel, they promised Benchley that he could write the first draft of the screenplay. The intent was to make sure a script could be done despite an impending threat of a Writer's Guild strike, given Benchley was not unionized. Overall, he wrote three drafts before the script was turned over to other writers; delivering his final version to Spielberg, he declared, [...] "I'm written out on this, and that's the best I can do." [...] Benchley would later describe his contribution to the finished film as [...] "the storyline and the ocean stuff – basically, the mechanics", given he [...] "didn't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> the character texture into a screenplay." [...] One of his changes was to remove the novel's adulterous affair between Ellen Brody and Matt Hooper, at the suggestion of Spielberg, who feared it would compromise the camaraderie between the men on the Orca. During the film's production, Benchley agreed to return and play a small onscreen role as a reporter.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. HitFix Senior Editor Alan Sepinwall wrote that [...] "Timothy Dalton was everything {{we had come}} to expect from him in the part: scary and dangerous and then so much the funnier for the way he kept trying to work the steps and turn over a new leaf. The episode left 's sincerity up in the air for most of the hour - was he really serious about making amends, or just trying to distract Chuck from his latest evil plan? - but Volkoff is such a well-drawn character, and Dalton so talented and versatile, that the comedy worked either way... Vivian, on the other hand? I'd been iffy on her in her most recent appearance, and putting her on camera with , even briefly, was just a reminder of how much less she brings to the table." [...] Ryan McGee of The A.V. Club gave the episode a A-. Though he praised Dalton's performance, McGee wrote, [...] "The direct parallels between Chuck and Vivian haven't really panned out in the way the show initially envisioned it. Let's face it: These two aren't exactly Buffy and Faith in terms of being foils for one another. The show has never painted Chuck as ever potentially going to the dark side. It has used Casey and occasionally Sarah to serve that function at times, but never Chuck. At this point, he's as set in his moral code as possible. Had the Vivian storyline happened at the outset of his Intersect 2.0 days, perhaps the taste of power could have gone to his head, with Vivian {{as an example of the}} road not taken. As such, Vivian's existence largely serves to connect her to the larger spy world of the show, not draw a direct parallel to the support system that helped Chuck overcome any potential temptations." [...] Eric Goldman of IGN gave this episode a score of 8 out of 10, writing, [...] "This Chuck got off to a shaky start. I don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> my finger on it exactly, but the pacing felt off in the first third or so of the episode... Thankfully, things picked up considerably as the episode went along – I'd say the turning point was the scene in which Chuck was sent in to meet with the pirates. The way Chuck's big announcement that he worked for Alexei Volkoff immediately led to a bunch of guns pulled on him was funny, as was not only Chuck asking to play Uno (for his life), but that the pirate did indeed have the game." [...] Carl Cortez of Assignment X, however, gave the episode a negative review, calling it [...] "a painfully nonsense driven episode that's now grasping at straws in an attempt to round out the last part of the season with an adequate storyline." ...|$|E

This extended to a ten-shot lead after five holes in the final round. Kaymer found trouble in the bunkers, resulting in a round of 75 and a fall to third place behind Frenchman Gary Stal, who secured his first European Tour victory, and world number one Rory McIlroy. Speaking after the round, Kaymer told the media that he was [...] "in shock" [...] at the result: [...] "I'm surprised and shocked," [...] the German said. [...] "I don't really <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> it into words. It was very, very surprising today. It will take me {{a few days to}} reflect on this.
