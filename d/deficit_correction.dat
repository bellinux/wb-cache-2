40|$|Although the {{positive}} psychology tradition {{emphasizes the importance}} of a balanced approach regarding individual strengths and weaknesses, there is no valid instrument to measure these phenomena in organizations. The purpose of the present studies is to develop and validate an instrument that measures four dimensions, namely perceived organizational support (POS) for strengths use, POS for <b>deficit</b> <b>correction,</b> strengths use behaviour, and <b>deficit</b> <b>correction</b> behaviour. In study 1 and 2, the Strengths Use and <b>Deficit</b> <b>COrrection</b> (SUDCO) questionnaire was developed and tested for its factor structure, reliability, and convergent and criterion validity in two samples of South African employees (N = 338 and N = 361, respectively). In study 3, the convergent and criterion validity of the SUDCO were examined in a sample of Dutch engineers (N = 133). Results indicated that the intended dimensions of strengths use and <b>deficit</b> <b>correction</b> can be measured reliably with 24 items and showed convergent validity. Moreover, POS for strengths use and strengths use behaviour correlated positively with self- and manager-ratings of job performance, supporting the criterion validity of these scales. As expected, POS for <b>deficit</b> <b>correction</b> and <b>deficit</b> <b>correction</b> behaviour were unrelated to the performance ratings...|$|E
40|$|Orientation: It is {{well known}} that the first year at {{university}} can be very challenging and stressful for students. While some students mainly depend on the university to assist them through this time, other students want to proactively manage this stressful period themselves by focusing on their strengths and developing in their areas of weakness. Two new scales measuring proactive strengths use and <b>deficit</b> <b>correction</b> behaviour have recently been developed for employees. However, the psychometric properties of these new scales have not yet been tested on first-year students in the South African context. Research purpose: To examine the validity, measurement invariance and reliability of the proactive strengths use and <b>deficit</b> <b>correction</b> scales for South African first-year university students. Motivation for the study: In order to cope in the demanding university environment, first-year university students need to develop and apply proactive strategies, including using their strengths and developing in their areas of weaknesses. Several studies have indicated that proactive behaviour, specifically strengths use and <b>deficit</b> <b>correction</b> behaviour, lead to favourable outcomes such as higher engagement, lower burnout and more life satisfaction. Therefore, it is important to validate scales that measure these constructs for first-year students. Research design, approach and method: A cross-sectional research approach was used. A sample of South African first-year university students aged between 18 and 23 years (N = 776) was collected. The two scales were tested for their factor structure, measurement invariance, reliability, and convergent and criterion validity. Main findings: A two-factor structure was found for the strengths use and <b>deficit</b> <b>correction</b> behaviour scales. Measurement invariance testing showed that the two scales were interpreted similarly by participants from different campuses and language groups. Cronbach’s alpha coefficients (α ≥ 0. 70) indicated that both scales were reliable. In addition, the scales demonstrated convergent validity (comparing them with a general strengths use and proactive behaviour scale). Strengths use and <b>deficit</b> <b>correction</b> behaviour both predicted student burnout, student engagement and life satisfaction, with varying strengths of the relationships for strengths use and <b>deficit</b> <b>correction</b> behaviour. Practical implications: Strengths use and <b>deficit</b> <b>correction</b> behaviour could enable students to manage study demands and enhance well-being. Students will experience favourable outcomes from proactively using strengths and developing their weaknesses, including reduced burnout and enhanced engagement and life satisfaction. Universities and lecturers can be informed, which allows them to develop support structures and provide students with opportunities to apply their strengths and develop thier deficits. Contribution/value-add: The present study adds to the limited research available on initiating proactive behaviour to use strengths and improve deficits for university students by validating two new scales. This could help in facilitating positive outcomes for first-year university students within the South African context. </p...|$|E

40|$|This paper uses cointegration and multicointegration {{analysis}} {{to explore the}} issue of twin deficits for the USA in the post-World War II period. The results suggest that prior to 1974 the systems of fiscal and foreign sector variables exhibit multicointegration. These results do not rule out short-run correlations between government deficits and external deficits. However, they do preclude {{the possibility that the}} twin deficit phenomenon describes a long-run structural relationship in the post-World War II, Bretton Woods era. In the more recent period, 1974 forward, neither system exhibits evidence of multi/cointegration. But, weak evidence of cointegration is present between fiscal deficits and trade <b>deficits.</b> Error <b>correction</b> models suggest that causality runs from internal to external deficits in the dynamic adjustment process. This evidence provides some support for the notion that more recently fiscal deficits may have contributed to external deficits. In combination with the results from the early sub-period, the evidence indicates that to the extent the twin deficit relationship exists, it is time specific and weak. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} state-of-the-art digital filtering {{techniques that}} are part of GEANA, an automatic data analysis software used for the GERDA experiment. The discussed filters include a novel, nonlinear correction method for ballistic deficits, which is combined with one of three shaping filters: a pseudo-Gaussian, a modified trapezoidal, or a modified cusp filter. The performance of the filters is demonstrated with a 762 g Broad Energy Germanium (BEGe) detector, produced by Canberra, that measures γ-ray lines from radioactive sources in an energy range between 59. 5 and 2614. 5 keV. At 1332. 5 keV, together with the ballistic <b>deficit</b> <b>correction</b> method, all filters produce a comparable energy resolution of 1. 61 keV FWHM. This value is superior to those measured by the manufacturer and those found in publications with detectors of a similar design and mass. At 59. 5 keV, the modified cusp filter without a ballistic <b>deficit</b> <b>correction</b> produced the best result, with an energy resolution of 0. 46 keV. It is observed that the loss in resolution by using a constant shaping time over the entire energy range is small when using the ballistic <b>deficit</b> <b>correction</b> method...|$|E

Doing this in a valid way in a cross-culturally diverse working environment may be challenging. It is, therefore, important to investigate the cultural consistency of new tools that assist managers in reaching these personnel development goals. Research purpose: Determine whether the Strengths Use and <b>Deficit</b> <b>COrrection</b> (SUDCO) questionnaire is universally applicable across the Nguni, Sesotho and West-Germanic language groups in South Africa by evaluating it statistically for bias and equivalence. Motivation for the study: South African personnel management could gain valuable insights and outcomes when they aim to improve both strengths and weaknesses. Research design, approach and method: The study employed semi-stratified sampling. A sample (N = 658) of employees in the banking sector participated in the study. The research focused on psychometric properties relating to bias, structural equivalence and reliability. Main findings: A four-factor model fitted the data best. This model described perceived organisational support (POS) for strengths use, POS for <b>deficit</b> <b>correction,</b> strengths-use behaviour and deficit-correction behaviour. A multi-group confirmatory factor analysis for the direct comparison of the SUDCO’s fit across the language groups (Nguni, Sesotho and WestGermanic) showed the 33 were unbiased against any of the three language groups and structured into the same four latent constructs. Practical implications: In personnel development, employees and managers should understand the benefits of a combined strengths and deficit approach as relating to different language groups.

We are still unable to reject the null hypothesis of non-sustainability for four countries.

Algorithms for a digital shaping-filter amplifier, for a digital pile-up elimination scheme and for ballistic <b>deficit</b> <b>correction</b> were investigated using a high-purity germanium detector. The pile-up elimination method was originally developed for fission fragment spectroscopy using a Frisch-grid back-to-back double ionisation chamber and was mainly intended for pile-up elimination in case of high alpha-radioactivity of the fissile target. The developed pile-up elimination method affects only the electronic noise generated by the preamplifier. Therefore, the influence of the pile-up elimination scheme on the final resolution of the spectrometer is investigated in terms of the distance between piled-up pulses.

40|$|Use of {{computational}} fluid dynamic (CFD) {{methods to}} predict the power production from wind entire wind farms in flat and complex terrain is presented in this paper. Two full 3 D Navier–Stokes solvers for incompressible flow are employed that incorporate the k–ε and k–ω turbulence models respectively. The wind turbines (W/Ts) are modelled as momentum absorbers by means of their thrust coefficient using the actuator disk approach. The WT thrust is estimated using the wind speed one diameter upstream of the rotor at hub height. An alternative method that employs an induction-factor based concept is also tested. This method features the advantage of not utilizing the wind speed at a specific distance from the rotor disk, which is a doubtful approximation when a W/T {{is located in the}} wake of another and/or the terrain is complex. To account for the underestimation of the near wake <b>deficit,</b> a <b>correction</b> is introduced to the turbulence model.

In the complex terrain case, there are some significant discrepancies with the measurements, which are discussed.

Postpartum hypernatremia with osmotic cerebral demyelination {{is a rare}} cause of reversible rhabdomyolysis. Electromyographic studies in postpartum hypernatremia have not been reported. Materials and Methods: Electromyography (EMG) was performed in five women with postpartum hypernatremia and muscle biopsy was performed in one of them. Results: Among the five women presenting with postpartum hypernatremia associated with marked elevation of serum creatine kinase, four had quadriparesis. All had varying degrees of encephalopathy at admission and recovered without residual <b>deficits</b> after gradual <b>correction</b> of hypernatremia. Needle EMG revealed fibrillations with positive sharp waves in five patients and myotonic discharges in three patients. Serial EMG in one patient revealed the occurrence of transient fibrillations, positive sharp waves and myotonic discharges. Muscle biopsy revealed extensive rhabdomyolysis in one patient.

In this study, the authors analyzed the efficacy and complication rate of percutaneous needle fasciotomy using a statistical method that takes the multilevel structure of data, regarding multiple measurements from the same patient, into account. Methods: The data of 470 treated rays from 451 patients with Dupuytren disease that underwent percutaneous needle fasciotomy were analyzed retrospectively. The authors described the early postoperative results of percutaneous needle fasciotomy and applied linear mixed models to compare mean correction of passive extension deficit between joints and efficacy of primary versus secondary percutaneous needle fasciotomy. Results: Mean preoperative passive extension deficits at the metacarpophalangeal, proximal interphalangeal, and distal interphalangeal joints were 37, 40, and 31 degrees, respectively. Mean preoperative total passive extension deficit was 54 degrees. Results were excellent, with a mean total passive extension <b>deficit</b> <b>correction</b> of 85 percent. Percutaneous needle fasciotomy was most effective for metacarpophalangeal joints and less effective for proximal interphalangeal and distal interphalangeal joints. Secondary percutaneous needle fasciotomy was as effective as primary percutaneous needle fasciotomy. Complications were rare and mostly minor. Conclusion: The {{results of this study}} confirm that percutaneous needle fasciotomy is an effective and safe treatment modality for patients with mild to moderate disease who prefer a minimally invasive procedure...|$|E
40|$|Point contact {{germanium}} (PCGe) detectors play a {{vital role}} in research such as, neutrinoless double beta decay, direct dark matter detection, the neutrino magnetic moment and coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering. This dissertation presents an experimental investigation of two commercially available, almost identical large volume PCGe detectors (~ 760 g). Their point contact size was stepwise modified according to specified simulations of the electric field in the detectors. The reduction of the point contact size improved both, the pulse shape discrimination efficiency of background signals at a few MeV and the noise from electronics. The lowest contribution of noise to the energy resolution was (299 ± 2) eV and (336 ± 2) eV (FWHM) for the two detectors, respectively. The better value translates to an energy threshold of 1 keV for an experiment with a low background level. A sensitivity study concluded that a resolution of less than 150 - 180 eV is required to detect the coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering near nuclear reactors. This is a factor of two better than the currently obtained value. Additionally, two different approaches have been used to determine the Fano factor. They both yielded consistent results, the better result is 0. 1076 ± 0. 0005. Before the most optimal results could be obtained, an evaluation of three shaping filters (the rounded-top cusp, rounded-top trapezoidal and Gaussian filter) and a ballistic <b>deficit</b> <b>correction</b> was performed.

Following this conversation, the Strengths Use and <b>Deficit</b> <b>Correction</b> Questionnaire (SUDCO) was developed. However, the cultural suitability of the SUDCO has not been confirmed. Research purpose: The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the bias and structural equivalence of the SUDCO. Motivation for the study: In a diverse cultural context such as South Africa, it is important to establish that a similar score on a psychological test has the same psychological meaning across ethnic groups. Research design, approach and method: A cross-sectional survey design was followed to collect data among a convenience sample of 858 employees from various occupational sectors in South Africa. Main findings: Confirmatory multigroup analysis was used to test for item and construct bias. None of the items were biased, neither uniform nor non-uniform. The most restrictive model accounted for similarities in weights, intercepts and means; only residuals were different. Practical/managerial implications: The results suggest that the SUDCO is suitable for use among the major ethnic groups included in this study. These results increase the probability that future studies with the SUDCO among other ethnic groups will be unbiased and equivalent.

Our study compares actual evapotranspiration estimates acquired with the Eddy-Covariance (EC) method and ETa measurements {{by a set of}} six redundant weighable lysimeters for a managed grassland site at Rollesbroich (Eifel, Western Germany). The comparison of ETa measured by EC (accounting for energy balance <b>deficit</b> <b>correction)</b> and by lysimeters is hardly reported in literature and gains more insight into the performance of both techniques. The evaluation of ETa estimates by both methods for the year 2012 shows a good agreement with a total difference of ca. 4 %, which is mainly related to variations in grass height at the lysimeters and in the EC footprint. We also used the lysimeter records to estimate precipitation amounts in combination with the AWAT filter algorithm. The estimated precipitation volumes of the lysimeter measurements show significant differences compared to the precipitation data of the Hellman type tipping bucket rain gauge at the test site. For the entire year 2012 the lysimeter measurements exhibit a 16 % higher precipitation amount than the tipping bucket data. With help of an on-site video surveillance system the precipitation data of the lysimeters were investigated in more detail. It was found that the precipitation surplus in lysimeter records in part is related to the detection of rime and dew, which contributes 17 % to the yearly difference between both methods. We concluded that weighable lysimeter data can be used to simultaneously estimate precipitation and actual evapotranspiration in a reliable fashion. Furthermore, lysimeter allow a plausible detection of rime and dew in contrast to standard rain gauges...|$|E

Log p 50 in vivo/pH plots were constructed to determine the Bohr effect.

We conclude that Siggaard-Andersen p 50 calculations may be misleading when there are disturbances of hemoglobin-oxygen affinity and acid-base balance, owing to changes in shape of the hemoglobin-dissociation curve. When metabolic acidosis occurs with high hemoglobin-oxygen affinity, as can occur in critical illness, indexes derived by the Siggaard-Andersen algorithm on arterial blood may greatly overestimate oxygen availability...|$|E

Economic growth decelerated in 2008 - 09 to 6. 7 percent. This represented a decline of 2. 1 percent from the average growth rate of 8. 8 percent in the previous five years. To counter the negative fallout of the global slowdown on the Indian economy, the federal Government responded by providing three focused fiscal stimulus packages in the form of tax relief to boost demand and increased expenditure on public projects to create employment and public assets. India's central Bank — the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) took a number of monetary easing and liquidity enhancing measures to facilitate flow of funds from the financial system to meet the needs of productive sectors. From all accounts, except for the agricultural sector initially as noted above, economic recovery seems to be well underway. Economic growth stood at 8. 6 percent during fiscal year 2010 - 11. GDP growth for 2009 - 10 was placed at 8 percent. When compared to countries across the world, India stands out as one of the best performing economies. Although there was a clear moderation in growth from 9 percent levels to 7 + percent soon after the crisis hit, in 2010 - 11, at 8. 6 percent, GDP growth in nearing the pre-crisis levels and this pace makes India the fastest growing major economy after China. Considering the current inflationary strains, the as yet excessive pre-emption of the community's savings by the government, the potential for crowding out the requirements of the enterprise sector, and rising interest payments on government debt, it is extremely essential to reduce the fiscal deficit, and more aggressively, mainly by lowering the revenue <b>deficit.</b> <b>Correction</b> of these deficits would, inter alia, require considerable refocusing and reduction of large hidden subsidies associated with under-pricing in crucial areas, such as power, irrigation, and urban transport. Food and fertilizer subsidies are other major areas of expenditure control. Be that as it may, the process of fiscal consolidation needs to be accelerated through more qualitative adjustments to reduce government dissavings and ameliorate price pressures. The step-up in India's growth rate over much of the last two decades was primarily due to the structural changes in industrial, trade and financial areas, among others, over the 1990 s as the reforms in these sectors were wide and deep and hence contributed significantly to higher productivity of the economy. Indeed, there is potential for still higher growth on a sustained basis of 9 + percent in the years ahead, but among other things, this would require the following: 1) revival and a vigorous pursuit of economic reforms at the center and in the states; 2) a major effort at raising the rate of domestic savings, especially by reducing government dissavings at the central and state levels through cuts in, and refocusing of, explicit and implicit subsidies, stricter control over non-developmental expenditures, improvements in the tax ratio through stronger tax enforcement, and strengthening incentives for savings; 3) larger investments in, and better performance of, infrastructural services, both in the public and private sectors; and 4) greater attention to, and larger resources for, agriculture, social sectors and rural development programs to increase employment, reduce poverty and for creating a mass base in support of economic reforms...|$|E

To assess whether temporal and regional variation in diet occurred, faecal samples were collected from two colonies of national importance on the southwest and southeast coast of Ireland. Results highlighted significant seasonal and inter-annual variations within diet samples collected from the southwest site, while significant regional differences occurred between geographic locations. Differences in prey assemblages are assumed to be related to their seasonal abundance and the foraging habitat type surrounding each haul-out site. While commercial species were found in relatively low abundances, haddock/pollock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus/Pollachius pollachius/ P. virens) species were substantial biomass contributors to the diet in Ireland. Low quantities of fishery target species were recovered from juvenile bycaught seal stomachs obtained from the west and south coast of Ireland. Lengths from a total of four prey fish overlapping with sizes targeted by the fisheries. Results suggest this cohort is not primarily responsible for the reported levels of depredation. The findings from this study are discussed in relation to results from other geographical areas of the grey seals distribution, with potential mitigation measures and future recommendations considered...|$|R
40|$|William J RoweFormer Assistant Clinical Professor of Medicine, Medical University of Ohio at Toledo, Ohio, USAAbstract: The {{hypothesis}} underpinning {{this paper}} is that space flight may predispose to catecholamine cardiomyopathy. Catecholamine levels in space are twice those of the supine levels on Earth. Serum magnesium levels are significantly reduced, with potential vicious cycles triggered by elevation of catecholamines. These are conducive to coronary vasospasm with clot formation from oxidative stress and calcium overload, and ultimately, temporary impairment of left ventricular function could occur. Experimental animals in space have shown {{a significant increase in}} norepinephrine levels with various microcirculatory disorders and serious myocardial pathology. During extravehicular activity (space walks), astronauts show heart rates of 150 – 174 beats per minute. Before exposure to the iron-laden dust brought into the habitat on his space suit, Neil Armstrong&# 39;s heart rates on the lunar surface were 130 – 160 beats per minute, and accompanied by dyspnea on two occasions during his last 20 minutes on the moon. A stress test done on the day after splashdown was consistent with "ischemic left ventricular dysfunction". To support this hypothesis, echocardiography on the international space station might show left ventricular hypokinesia. Alpha adrenergic blockade, correction of invariable significant magnesium <b>deficits,</b> along with <b>correction</b> of invariable atrial natriuretic peptide deficits, may counteract the vasoconstrictive action of norepinephrine.

40|$|Background: Portal vein {{thrombosis}} (PVT) is a severe complication of liver cirrhosis (LC), especially in presence of hepatocarcinoma (HCC). Liver {{is the main}} site of homocysteine (Hcy) metabolism and Hcy-related vitamins (folate, B 12) storage. Aim: Assessment of possible association of moderate hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) (> 15 mol/L), risk factor for deep venous thrombosis, and TVP in different stage LC patients, with and without HCC. Methods: 16 (aged 60 ± 12, 8 f) LC patients with documented (doppler ultrasonography) PVT and 32 (aged 64 ± 11, 12 f) without PT were studied [total plasma Hcy (HPLC), Hcy-related vitamin status (ELISA), stage of disease (Child-Pugh score), presence of HCC (radiological and/or histological diagnosis), ethiology (alcohol, viral, both, other) ]. Results: Hcy levels significantly (corrected for vitamin status) increases with Child-Pugh score (A: 11. 84 ± 4. 2, n= 12; B= 16. 5 ± 8. 2, n= 22; C= 18. 5 ± 8. 1, n= 14, mol/L. p= 0. 021); HCC patients (n= 18) showed higher Hcy than those without HCC (17. 7 ± 7. 4 vs. 13. 5 ± 5. 9,p=ns,after vitamin status correction). As expected, prevalence of HCC was higher in PVT group (10 / 16 (62. 5 %) vs. 8 / 32 (25 %),p < 0. 01). TVP group presented lower serum folate (3. 8 ± 1. 2 vs. 5. 5 ± 1. 8 nmol/ml, p= 0. 017) and B 12 levels (352 ± 89 vs. 516 ± 125, p=. 038), with no differences for different ethiologies, and a higher prevalence of folate and B 12 <b>deficit.</b> After <b>correction</b> for vitamin status, Child-Pugh score, and prevalence of HCC, TVP group showed higher Hcy (19. 7 ± 5. 5 vs. 13. 81 ± 7. 8 mol/L, p= 0. 015) and an higher prevalence of HHcy (10 / 16 (62. 5 %) vs 8 / 32 (25 %), p<. 011). Association of HHcy and TVP resulted significant (OR= 5. 0, 95 %CI: 1. 4 - 18. 2, p= 0. 014). Conclusions: Our data suggest the possible importance of raised Hcy levels in development of TVP in cirrhotic patients, especially in higher stadium of disease or complicated by HCC. Studies {{about the role of}} treatment of HHcy in LC patients for the prevention of TVP are underway...|$|R
40|$|Lesions of the parieto-occipital {{junction}} (POJ) {{in humans}} cause gross deviations of reaching movements and impaired grip formation if the targets {{are located in}} the subjects peripheral visual field. Movements to central targets are typically less impaired. This disorder has been termed optic ataxia. It has been suggested that a general <b>deficit</b> of online <b>corrections</b> under central as well as peripheral viewing conditions might be sufficient to explain this discrepancy. According to this hypothesis, patients with optic ataxia should demonstrate an impaired online correction of grip aperture under central viewing conditions if the target object changes its size during the grasping movement. We investigated this prediction in a patient with optic ataxia (I. G.) in a virtual visuo-haptic grasping task. We imposed an isolated need for online corrections of the hand aperture independently of positional changes of the target object. While we found some general inaccuracies of her grasping movements, the patient d id not show a specific impairment of online adjustment of grip aperture. On the contrary, I. G. smoothly adjusted her grip aperture comparable to healthy subjects. A general deficit of fast movement correction affecting targets in peripheral as well as central visual fields thus does not appear to account for the overt visuomotor deficits in optic ataxia. Rather, it seems more likely that an anatomical dissociation between visuomotor pathways related to actions in the central and in the peripheral visual field underlies the dissociation of visuomotor performance depending on the retinotopic target position in optic ataxia...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{evaluate}} internationally agreed limits on public sector debt and deficits, {{such as those}} agreed by the EC countries in the Treaty of Maastricht as preconditions for membership in a monetary union. These fiscal convergence criteria require that general government budget deficits should not exceed 3 % of GDP and that the gross debt of the general government should not be above 60 % of GDP. The Maastricht requirements, especially the debt criterion, are much more stringent than those required to ensure public sector solvency. Their implementation would require an excessive degree of fiscal retrenchment which would adversely affect the level of economic activity. The deficit guideline {{does not appear to}} be sensible, since the numerical criterion refers to the nominal interest payments-inclusive financial <b>deficit,</b> with no <b>corrections</b> for inflation and real output growth, no cyclical adjustment and no appropriate allowance for future revenue-producing public sector investment. The verbal qualifications are too vague to neutralize the potential for serious damage attached to the numerical guidelines. We discuss the various `externality' arguments in favour of binding fiscal rules and find them wanting, both theoretically and empirically. An argument in favour of external enforcement of binding fiscal rules might be made in the presence of `excessive deficits' due to political distortions. We conclude that the fiscal convergence criteria should be disregarded or applied quite loosely in order to avoid the risk of serious fiscal overkill.

40|$|This study set out {{to improve}} our {{understanding}} of the molecular genetic characteristics of imported strains of common carp reared in the Czech Republic. To do this we characterized the genetic diversity and population structure of 11 carp strains including two farmed strains from Germany (Scheuerman and Glinzig mirror carp) and France (Forez and Dombez scaly carp), one farmed population from Amur river basins, and one feral population from the Ebro River (Spain), by microsatellite analysis of 10 loci. Mean heterozygosity within populations ranged from 0. 584 to 0. 700, and the mean number of alleles per population ranged from 5. 0 to 9. 8. Of the analysed loci, 92 out of 130 possible tests were found to deviate significantly (P < 0. 05) from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium revealing significant heterozygote <b>deficit</b> after Bonferroni <b>correction.</b> Global analysis of hierarchical gene diversity (AMOVA) further revealed that the total genetic variation among populations was 21 %, whilst variation within populations was estimated to be 79 %. After grouping, the majority of total microsatellite loci variation appeared to be due to variation within populations. A relationship tree based on Nei's DA genetic distance and the UPGMA algorithm grouped the strains and populations into two major clusters, reflecting their affiliation to the European/Central Asian or East-Asian subspecies of common carp, rather than their country of origin. An individual assignment test (self-classification) using a Bayesian method demonstrated 89. 6 % accuracy in assigning individuals into their correct strains/population of origin at P < 0. 05. Thus, the set of 10 highly polymorphic microsatellite markers {{used in the present study}} demonstrated significant worth in monitoring the genetic diversity of cultured common carp. Additionally, our results proved the efficiency of the conservation programme and highlighted the need for better control of genetic variability in common carp strains. This could also be useful for the conservation of carp strains in the Czech Republic. © 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Objetivo: Determinar a prevalência de baixa acuidade visual (AV) em uma amostra populacional, com um padrão socioeconômico diferenciado. Métodos: Realizou-se estudo de prevalência, sendo verificada a AV de 213 voluntários examinados em um posto no {{interior}} de um {{shopping center}} em Porto Alegre, por meio do aparelho Ortho-Rater, da Bausch & Lomb. Foi medida a AV para longe em todos os indivíduos e naqueles com 40 anos ou mais, a AV para perto, ambos sem e com correção. Determinou-se como baixa AV, aquela inferior a 10 (equivalente a 20 / 20 na Tabela de Snellen). Resultados: A idade variou de 6 a 75 anos, com uma média ± desvio-padrão de 27, 8 ± 15, 16 anos, pertencendo a maioria dos examinados à faixa entre 10 e 40 anos. Encontrou-se uma prevalência de 38, 7 % (IC 95 %: 32, 1 - 45, 7) de baixa AV para longe nos dois olhos. 24, 9 % (IC 95 %: 19, 2 - 31, 3) apresentavam déficit visual binocular e não faziam uso de correção. Para perto, observou-se que 70, 8 % (IC 95 %: 55, 9 - 83) dos indivíduos testados apresentaram déficit visual binocular sem correção e 41, 7 % (IC 95 %: 27, 6 - 56, 8) apresentaram baixa AV independente do uso de correção. Conclusão: Este estudo demonstrou que existe considerável parcela da população com déficit visual, necessitando de avaliação e manejo adequados. Conclui-se que programas de medida da AV e orientação sobre saúde ocular são importantes em qualquer ambiente e atingindo diferentes classes socioeconômicas. Purpose: To determine {{the prevalence of}} low visual acuity (VA) in a populational sample, with a differentiated social pattern. Methods: This was a prevalence study, in which the 213 volunteers' VA, examined in a shopping mall in Porto Alegre, was verified through the Ortho-Rater device, from Bausch & Lomb. Far sight VA was measured in all the individuals and in those who were 40 years old or older, near sight VA, both of them without and with correction. VA was considered low when {{it was less than}} 10 (equivalent to 20 / 20 on the Snellen chart). Results: The age group varied from 6 to 75 years, presentig a mean ± standard deviation of 27. 8 ± 15. 16 years, most belonging to the range between 10 and 40 years. A prevalence of 38. 7 % (IC 95 %: 32. 1 - 45. 7) of low far sight VA in both eyes was detected. 24. 9 % (IC 95 %: 19. 2 - 31. 3) presented binocular visual deficit and they didn't use any optic correction. For near sight VA, it was observed that 70. 8 % (IC 95 %: 55. 9 - 83) of the tested individuals presented binocular visual <b>deficit</b> without <b>correction</b> and 41. 7 % (IC 95 %: 27. 6 - 56. 8) presented low VA, independent of the correction used. Conclusion:This study demonstrated that a considerable part of the population has low visual acuity, needing adequate evaluation and handling.

40|$|Introduction: Previous {{research}} indicates that children with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) show <b>deficits</b> performing online <b>corrections,</b> an issue exacerbated by adding inhibitory constraints; however, cross-sectional data suggests that these deficits may reduce with age. Using a longitudinal design, {{the aim of the}} study presented here was to model the coupling that occurs between inhibitory systems and (predictive) online control in typically developing children (TDC) and in those with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) {{over an extended period of}} time, using a framework of interactive specialization. We predicted that TDC would show a non-linear growth pattern, consistent with re-organisation in the coupling during the middle childhood period, while DCD would display a developmental lag. Method: A group of 196 children (111 girls and 85 boys) aged between 6 and 12 years participated in the study. Children were classified as DCD according to research criteria. Using a cohort sequential design, both TDC and DCD groups were divided into age cohorts. Predictive (online) control was defined operationally by performance on a Double-Jump Reaching Task (DJRT), which was assessed at 6 -month intervals over two years (5 time points in total). Inhibitory control was examined using an anti-jump condition of the DJRT paradigm whereby children were instructed to touch a target location in the hemispace opposite a cued location. Results: For the TDC group, model comparison using growth curve analysis revealed that a quadratic trend was the most appropriate fit with evidence of rapid improvement in anti-reach performance up until middle childhood (around 8 - 9 years of age), followed by a more gradual rate of improvement into late childhood and early adolescence. This pattern was evident on both chronometric and kinematic measures. In contrast, for children with DCD, a linear function provided the best to fit on the key metrics, with a slower rate of improvement than controls. Conclusion: We conclude that children with DCD require a more extended period of development to effectively couple online motor control and executive systems when completing anti-reach movements, whereas TDC show rapid improvement in early and middle childhood. These group differences in growth curves are likely to reflect a maturational lag in the development of motor-cognitive networks in children with DCD...|$|R
40|$|Iatrogenic {{spinal cord}} injury is the most feared {{complication}} of scoliosis surgery. The importance of combined somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) and motor evoked potentials (MEP) monitoring during spine surgery is well known. The current authors retrospectively evaluated the results of neurophysiological intraoperative monitoring (IOM) in a large population of patients who underwent surgical treatment for spinal deformity. Intraoperative monitoring of SEPs and transcranial electrical stimulation MEPs (TES-MEP) was performed in 172 successive patients who underwent surgical treatment of idiopathic (128 pts), congenital (15 pts) or syndromic (29 pts) scoliosis. The first 106 patients (Group 1) underwent only SEP monitoring, while the other 66 patients (Group 2) underwent combined SEP and TES-MEP monitoring, when the technique {{was introduced in the}} current authors’ institution. Halogenate anaesthesia (Sevoflurane, MAC 0. 6 – 1. 2) was performed in Group 1 cases, total intravenous anaesthesia (Propofol infusion, 6 – 10  mg/kg/h) in Group 2 patients. A neurophysiological “alert” was defined as a reduction in amplitude (unilateral or bilateral) of at least 50 % for SEPs and of 65 % for TES-MEPs compared with baseline. In Group 1, two patients (1. 9 %) developed postoperative neurologic <b>deficits</b> following surgical <b>correction</b> of spinal deformity, consisting of permanent paraparesis in one case and transient paraparesis secondary to spinal cord ischaemia in the other. Twelve patients presented intraoperative significant changes of neurophysiological parameters that improved following corrective actions by surgeons and anaesthesiologists, and did not show any postoperative neurologic deficits. In ten cases the alert was apparently unrelated to surgical manoeuvres or to pharmacological interventions and no postoperative neurologic deficits were noted. Considering the patients of Group 2, two patients (3. 0 %) presented transient postoperative neurologic deficits preceded by significant intraoperative changes in SEPs and TES-MEPs. In five cases a transient reduction in the amplitudes of SEPs (1 patient) and/or TES-MEPs (5 patients) was recorded intraoperatively with no postoperative neurologic deficits. In conclusion, in the current series of 172 patients the overall prevalence of postoperative neurologic deficit was 2. 3 % (4 patients). When combined SEP and TES-MEP monitoring was performed, the sensitivity and specificity of IOM for sensory-motor impairment was 100 and 98 %, respectively. Combined SEP and TES-MEP monitoring must be regarded as the neurophysiological standard for intraoperative detection of emerging {{spinal cord injury}} during corrective spinal deformity surgery. Early detection affords the surgical team an opportunity to perform rapid intervention to prevent injury progression or possibly to reverse impending neurologic sequelae...|$|R
