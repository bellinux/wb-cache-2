A 2 x 3 factorial design was implemented with participant's sense <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> and the amount <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> used by the therapist being the independent variables.

I also hypothesized that participants who had a greater sense <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> would rate the therapist more positively. Results revealed a partial confirmation of the hypotheses.

40|$|Philosophies <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> {{date back}} at least to antiquity, but {{linguistic}} study <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> has developed only recently, perhaps due to the "lighthearted" nature of the field. Since its emergence as a serious linguistic topic, linguists have worked to formalize a linguistic theory <b>of</b> <b>humor.</b> While many different methods for such a formalized theory have been proposed, Raskin (1985) has made the largest strides in this direction with his SEMANTIC SCRIPT THEORY <b>OF</b> <b>HUMOR</b> (SSTH).

Specifically, the paper draws on ideas from the cognitive linguistics SURPRISE DISAMBIGUATION (SD) model <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> and explores new criteria for determining not only what constitutes a joke, but what constitutes a strong joke, as opposed to a weak joke.

This study investigated the relationship between psychological capital and good feeling among the women teachers. To this end, this study used a descriptive – correlation approach carried on female teachers of Ardabil city in Iran. From this population, 80 women selected with multi-stage cluster sampling method and psychological capacity and sense <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> questionnaires carried on them. Data analyzed with Pearson correlation and multiple regression techniques. Results indicated that optimism, resilience and confidence have a significant relationship with a sense <b>of</b> <b>humor,</b> but the relationship between sense <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> and hope, was negligible. Another result was that resilience had a considerable positive relationship with all four factors <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> sense. Optimism related to humor and humor creation and confidence was associated only with humor creation. The hope, had not a great relationship with each of the four factors humor. Considering the relationship between psychological capacity and sense <b>of</b> <b>humor,</b> if the organization's managers focus on both increasing psychological capacity and a sense <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> in staff, its impact on work results will be considerably larger than when the focus is only on one of these two variables...|$|R

The reply (Martin 2015, On the challenges <b>of</b> measuring <b>humor</b> styles: Response to Heintz and Ruch. Humor: International Journal <b>of</b> <b>Humor</b> Research 28. 635 – 639) suggested that our study could be methodologically flawed, thereby limiting the conclusions that can be drawn. In the present reply, we discuss each of these criticisms and demonstrate that these are likely unfounded and do not influence our results and conclusions. Thus we still suggest that the gap between the conceptualization and the measurement <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> styles should be closed to improve the construct validity of the HSQ. This would allow interpreting the manifold findings with the HSQ and deriving hypotheses for future studies based on the humor style constructs...|$|R
