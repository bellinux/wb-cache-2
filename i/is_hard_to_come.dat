2500|$|Bitch {{has also}} been reappropriated by hip-hop culture, rappers use the {{adjective}} [...] "bad bitch" [...] to refer to an independent, confident, attractive woman. The term is used in a complimentary way, meaning the woman is desirable. One of the first instances of [...] "bitch" [...] being used {{in this way is}} in the song [...] "Da Baddest Bitch" [...] by Trina, released in 1999. This can also be seen throughout multiple different songs from Rihanna's song entitled [...] "Bad Bitch" [...] featuring Beyoncé which reiterates the line [...] "I'm a bad bitch" [...] multiple times. Nicki Minaj is another female rap icon who uses the term in her song [...] "Starships" [...] where she says [...] “bad bitches like me <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> by”. This use of the word bitch shows women reappropriating the meaning to be a more positive and empowering word for women.|$|E

2500|$|In several interviews, Octavia Butler has {{acknowledged}} that a series of family and life experiences influenced her novel Kindred. Butler’s grandmother worked chopping sugar cane, and did the laundry of her family {{as well as for}} the white family whom she worked for. Butler spent a great deal of her childhood feeling ashamed that her mother was a housemaid. She also resented her mother for allowing her employers to treat her like dirt, talking to her like she was less than a human being. As she grew older, Butler realized that her mother endured all that disrespect in order to provide for her. This, in turn, inspired her to write a series of female characters—Alice, Sarah, and Dana—whose capacity of endurance and sacrifice in the face of exploitation is heroic. [...] Butler’s work experiences also helped her develop the protagonist of the novel, Dana. Just like Butler, Dana works at a number of jobs--"from blue collar to low grade white collar, clerk typist"—while struggling to become a published writer. Like Dana, when work <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> by, Butler goes home, bakes a solitary potato for her daily meal and keeps on writing.|$|E

6000|$|A certain Mr. Mackay from Ireland {{called on}} me, an active agent, it would seem, about {{the reform of}} prisons. He exclaims, justly I have no doubt, {{about the state of}} our Lock-up House. For myself, I have some {{distrust}} of the fanaticism--even of philanthropy. A good part of it arises in general from mere vanity and love of distinction, gilded over to others and to themselves with some show of benevolent sentiment. The philanthropy of Howard, mingled with his ill-usage of his son, seems to have risen to a pitch of insanity. Yet without such extraordinary men, who call attention to the subject by their own peculiarities, prisons would have remained the same dungeons which they were forty or fifty years ago. I do not see the propriety of making them dandy places of detention. They should be a place of punishment, and that can hardly be if men are lodged better, and fed better, than when they are at large. The separation of ranks is an excellent distinction, and is nominally provided for in all modern prisons. But the size of most of them is inadequate to the great increase of crime, and so the pack is shuffled together again for want of room to keep them separate. There are several prisons constructed on excellent principles, the economy of which becomes deranged so soon as the death takes place of some keen philanthropist who had the business of a whole committee, which, having lost him, remained like a carcass without a head. But I have never seen a plan for keeping in order these resorts of guilt and misery, without presupposing a superintendence of a kind which might perhaps be exercised, could we turn out upon the watch a guard of angels. But, alas! jailors and turnkeys are rather like angels of a different livery, nor do I see how it is possible to render them otherwise. Superintendence is all you can trust to, and superintendence, save in some rare cases, <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> by, where it is to be vigilantly and constantly exercised. Quis custodiet ipsos custodes? As to reformation, I have no great belief in it, when the ordinary class of culprits, who are vicious from ignorance or habit, are the subjects of the experiment. [...] "A shave from a broken loaf" [...] is thought as little of by the male set of delinquents as by the fair frail. The state of society now leads so much to great accumulations of humanity, that we cannot wonder if it ferment and reek like a compost dunghill. Nature intended that population should be diffused over the soil in proportion to its extent. We have accumulated in huge cities and smothering manufactories the numbers which should be spread over the face of a country; and what wonder that they should be corrupted? We have turned healthful and pleasant brooks into morasses and pestiferous lakes,--what wonder the soil should be unhealthy? A great deal, I think, might be done by executing the punishment of death, without a chance of escape, in all cases to which it should be found properly applicable; of course these occasions being diminished to one out of twenty to which capital punishment is now assigned. Our ancestors brought the country to order by kilting[135] thieves and banditti with strings. So did the French when at Naples, and bandits became for the time unheard of. When once the evil habit is altered--when men are taught a crime of a certain character is connected inseparably with death, the moral habits of a population become altered, and you may in the next age remit the punishment which in this it has been necessary to inflict with stern severity. I think whoever pretends to reform a corrupted nation, or a disorderly regiment, or an ill-ordered ship of war, must begin by severity, and only resort to gentleness when he has acquired the complete mastery by terror--the terror being always attached to the law; and, the impression once made, he can afford to govern with mildness, and lay the iron rule aside.|$|E
