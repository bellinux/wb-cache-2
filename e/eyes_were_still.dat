25|$|Two {{weeks before}} the Bislett Games, which Saidy {{considered}} important in the Olympic preparations, {{it was reported that}} the injury was healed, and that Saidy would compete in both the 100 and the 200 metres. One week later, however, the reports were countered. Having not recovered fully from the injury, Saidy stated that he would compete no earlier than late June. His <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> fixed on the main goal for the 2008 season, the 2008 Summer Olympics. In Beijing he competed at the 100 metres sprint and placed 3rd in his heat after Derrick Atkins and Andrey Yepishin in a time of 10.37 seconds. He qualified for the second round in which he improved his time to 10.14 seconds. However, he was unable to qualify for the semi finals as he finished in 4th place of his heat after Usain Bolt, Darvis Patton and Francis Obikwelu. He also took part in the 200 metres individual, finishing second in his first round heat, with a time of 20.54 seconds. With 20.45 seconds in the second round he placed third in his heat and he qualified for the semi finals, however he did not show up {{at the start of the}} race.|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{himself had}} to ditch {{into the sea}} on 10April, {{when he was shot}} down after being {{surprised}} by three Zeros during another of his solo reconnaissance missions near Lae. After playing dead beside his crashed plane to discourage the Japanese fighters from machine-gunning him, he swam to shore and made his way through jungle for over a week to Wau, with the help of two New Guinea natives. When he arrived back at Port Moresby in a US Douglas Dauntless on 23April, a Japanese air raid was in progress and a bullet cut off the tip of his right index finger. Having survived his trek through the jungle, he dismissed the wound as [...] "a mere scratch". On 27April, Jackson met with his pilots and revealed that some senior RAAF officers had expressed dissatisfaction with the way in which No.75 Squadron was avoiding dogfighting with the Japanese Zeros. Jackson and his men had generally eschewed such tactics owing to the Zero's superiority to the Kittyhawk in close combat. The senior officers' comments had evidently stung him, however, as he declared to his pilots: [...] "Tomorrow I'm going to show you how". According to journalist Osmar White, who saw him {{on the night of the}} 27th, Jackson's [...] "hands and <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> and rock steady" [...] but he appeared [...] "weary in soul" [...] and [...] "too long in the shadows". White concluded: [...] "He had done more than conquer fear—he had killed it". The next day, Jackson led No.75 Squadron's five remaining airworthy Kittyhawks to intercept a force of Japanese bombers and their escort. He destroyed an enemy fighter before being shot down and killed. His aircraft hit the side of a mountain and embedded itself six feet; Jackson was identified only by his size-ten boots and the revolver he habitually wore. His final tally of aerial victories during the war was eight.|$|E

Bankhead, at 62 and audibly suffering from breathing difficulties from emphysema in the interview show, frankly spoke of how hopeless she would be on a desert island, admitting that she [...] "couldn’t put a key in the door, dahling. I can't do a thing for myself." [...] In the interview, host Plomley spoke of Bankhead's glory days as the most celebrated actress of 1920s London. Later he recalled of their interview, [...] "She was a very frail and ailing old lady, and I {{was shocked to see}} how old and ill she looked as I helped her out of a taxi. She had come from her hotel wearing a mink coat slung over a pair of lounging pyjamas, and she leaned heavily on my arm as I supported her to the lift. Her <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> fine, and there was still beauty in the bone structure of her face beneath the wrinkles and ravages of hard living.

40|$|Abstract: The {{currently}} available methods for {{the diagnosis of}} dry <b>eye</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> far from being perfect {{for a variety of}} reasons. This review attempts to highlight the advantages and disad-vantages of both traditional tests (such as Schirmer’s test, break-up time and ocular surface staining) and innovative noninvasive procedures, including tear meniscus height measurement, corneal topography, functional visual acuity, tear interferometry, tear evaporimetry and tear osmolarity assessment. Although any ophthalmologist and <b>eye</b> care practitioner <b>is</b> familiar with conventional methods such as Schirmer’s test and break-up time (BUT), diagnosing dry <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> a challenging task for several reasons: 1. The term “dry eye ” includes a wide spectrum of alterations of the ocular surface with different etiology and pathophysiology; as a consequence, even the defi nition of dry <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> debated, as demonstrated by the fact that in 2006 a panel meeting, including some of the most experienced subspecialists, recommended using the designation of “dysfunctional tear syndrome ” (DTS) instead of dry <b>eye,</b> as “it <b>is</b> suffi ciently broad to encompass the myriad of etiologies while still representing...|$|R
