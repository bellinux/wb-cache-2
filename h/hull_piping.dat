5000|$|In mid-July, after {{a period}} of local operations, the ship moved to Seattle, Washington, where she entered the Todd Shipyard for another {{modernization}} overhaul to repair her aging <b>hull,</b> <b>piping</b> systems, and cabling. Returning to Long Beach in mid-October, she conducted refresher training and local operations into the following spring. On 19 April 1965, Belle Grove pointed her bow westward for service in Vietnam. She transported a portion of the elite South Korean [...] "Tiger" [...] Corps to Vietnam. The ship then supported the recent marine deployment to Da Nang by serving as a boat haven in that city's harbor. In addition, she provided repair facilities to inshore coastal vessels engaged in Operation Market Time, a series of coastal patrols designed to interdict communist waterborne logistics routes into South Vietnam. Returning home 29 November, she spent only six weeks in leave and upkeep before heading back to Vietnam.|$|E
50|$|Biofouling or {{biological}} fouling is the undesirable accumulation of micro-organisms, algae and diatoms, plants, and animals on surfaces, for example ships' <b>hulls,</b> or <b>piping</b> and reservoirs with untreated water. This can {{be accompanied by}} microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC).|$|R
5000|$|Construction - Full nuclear sub shock, <b>hull</b> and <b>piping</b> {{requirements}} {{were imposed}} on the designers - nullifying the [...] "off the shelf" [...] design approaches requested {{by the government in}} earlier phases. To accommodate the larger <b>piping</b> and thicker <b>hull,</b> other systems had to be lightened. (Reference the GAO and RAND reports.) The pressure hull construction was HY-80 alloy steel (same as larger nuclear powered submarines) and the batteries were contained in separate titanium alloy pressure enclosures (14 total) which hung beneath the hull. The outer surfaces, control surfaces, nose, and tail were constructed of fiberglass composite to give the submersible a streamlined shape. The pressure hull consisted of three compartments; an operations compartment (forward) where the submersible was piloted and controlled; a diving lockout chamber (middle); and a troop transport compartment (aft) where special operations commandos and their equipment are transported.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} implementation of a fairing module for a ship hull design application. This module {{is part of a}} large project on ship design, including facilities for <b>piping,</b> <b>hull</b> design and virtual reality tools for interactive navigation. The surface hull model is based on trimmed NURBS. A discussion of existing fairing algorithms and related criteria for this particular application is presented. The proposed algorithm, based on filtering parallel plane sections of the hull is presented and discussed. Postprint (published version...|$|R
