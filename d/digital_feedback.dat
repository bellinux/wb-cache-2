50|$|To be able {{to exert}} torques on the {{microbeads}} at least two magnets are necessary, but many other configurations have been realized, reaching from only one magnet that only pulls the magnetic microbeads {{to a system of}} six electromagnets that allows fully controlling the 3-dimensional position and rotation via a <b>digital</b> <b>feedback</b> loop. The magnetic field strength decreases roughly exponentially with the distance from the axis linking the two magnets on a typical scale of about the width of the gap between the magnets. Since this scale is rather large in comparison to the distances, when the microbead moves in an experiment, the force acting on it may be treated as constant. Therefore, magnetic tweezers are passive force clamps {{due to the nature of}} their construction in contrast to optical tweezers, although they may be used as positive clamps, too, when combined with a feedback loop. The field strength may be increased by sharpening the pole face of the magnet which, however, also diminishes the area where the field may be considered as constant. An iron ring connection the outer poles of the magnets may help to reduce stray fields. Magnetic tweezers can be operated with both, permanent magnets and electromagnets. The two techniques have their specific advantages.|$|E
50|$|The {{displacement}} of the magnetic beads corresponds to {{the response of the}} system to the imposed magnetic field and hence needs to be precisely measured: In a typical set-up, the experimental volume is illuminated from the top so that the beads produce diffraction rings in the focal plane of an objective which is placed under the tethering surface. The diffraction pattern is then recorded by a CCD-camera. The image can be analyzed in real time by a computer. The detection of the position in the plane of the tethering surface is not complicated since it corresponds {{to the center of the}} diffraction rings. The precision can be up to a few nanometers. For the position along the vertical axis, the diffraction pattern needs to be compared to reference images, which show the diffraction pattern of the considered bead in a number of known distances from the focal plane. These calibration images are obtained by keeping a bead fixed while displacing the objective, i.e. the focal plane, with the help of piezoelectric elements by known distances. With the help of interpolation, the resolution can reach precision of up 10 nm along this axis. The obtained coordinates may be used as input for a <b>digital</b> <b>feedback</b> loop that controls the magnetic field strength, for example, in order to keep the bead at a certain position.|$|E

5000|$|Media theory {{focuses on}} the agency that {{composing}} in new media can give writers. It {{is important not to}} simply add in new media as a problematic addendum to analogue writing; instead, teachers can take advantage of these [...] "new" [...] means by calling students to become both consumers or critics of new media as well as producers, as technology's role in society becomes ever more prominent. Giving students the resources to take part in discourses around and through new media gives them the power and agency to act in this digital world. The agency gained through new media composition also provides a basis for social change. Gunther Kress remarks on the potential for teaching design via new media composition in the classroom:Design takes for granted competence in the use of resources, but beyond that it requires the orchestration and remaking of these resources in the services of frameworks and models that express the maker's intentions in shaping the social and cultural environment. While critique looks at the present through the means of past production, design shapes the future through deliberate deployment of representational resources in the designer's interest. Teachers cite the ease of which students pick up on the techniques of composition and analysis of new media. The visually saturated and technologically heavy society of today means that students and writers will need to question the communications and compositions around them as rhetorical moves integral to the culture students live in. [...] Their familiarity with and knowledge of new media often results in positive, conscious appropriation of media, and opens the door for discussions of repurposing within culture. Jay Bolter and Richard Grusin say:No medium today, and certainly no single media event, seems to do its cultural work in isolation from other social and economic forces. What is new about new media comes from the particular ways in which they refashion older media {{and the ways in which}} older media refashion themselves to answer the challenges of new media. One potentially useful method of teaching composition with media theory in mind is through the use of online classrooms. Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and Online Writing Labs (OWLs) are becoming increasingly popular, especially with distance learning. These educational formats also typically deal with analogue texts, but provide technologically based resources for this composition process via <b>digital</b> <b>feedback</b> and revision techniques. Media theory has particular potential for teaching basic writers or students whose native language is not English. As a [...] "literacy" [...] that [...] "translates" [...] better across languages and demographics, new media can serve to engage students who were previously uninterested in composition, as well as allow these students to feel like they have more expertise or agency in the composing process. Furthermore, it allows for more creativity and exploration of rhetorical power in composition as students learn the semiotic power of various modes of discourse through technology.|$|E

40|$|A {{method of}} <b>digital</b> <b>feedback</b> control was {{established}} more than 20 years ago.

40|$|Where <b>digital</b> <b>feedback</b> studies report {{positive}} pedagogic outcomes, {{reasons for}} such outcomes {{are often not}} clear. One possible factor {{is the nature of}} learners’ engagement with <b>digital</b> <b>feedback.</b> With the aim of informing markers’ own action research, this exploratory study investigates how form (as opposed to content) of <b>digital</b> <b>feedback</b> may influence engagement. Within the context of an English university with rapidly growing use of the GradeMark <b>digital</b> <b>feedback</b> tool, and informed by a secondary analysis of a prior survey of learners’ experiences and perceptions of feedback, interviews with learners were conducted to investigate: How may the ways in which feedback can be presented in the GradeMark <b>digital</b> <b>feedback</b> tool influence undergraduates’ engagement in developmental use of lecturers’ feedback for summative assessment of written coursework? It was found that GradeMark on-script ‘Bubble Comments’ and off-script ‘Voice Comments’ may both positively influence how valued learners feel and encourage and support their use of feedback for development by positively influencing their motivation and ability to engage. On-script ‘QuickMark Comments’ and off-script ‘General Comments’ and ‘Rubrics’ may negatively influence same. These influences arise from the specific ways feedback can be presented in GradeMark affecting personalisation, specificity and clarity of meaning of feedback, learners’ emotional connection with their marker and by grabbing their attention. Ways in which form may influence content are also identified. It is recommended that, through their own action research, markers using GradeMark explore the use of Bubble Comments and Voice Comments as alternatives to General Comments, and ‘Grading Forms’ as an alternative to Rubrics. Markers using other <b>digital</b> <b>feedback</b> tools may consider using on-script annotations and digital audio feedback as alternatives to off-script paragraphs of digital written feedback, and free-form rather than pre-set assessment criteria-related comments.
