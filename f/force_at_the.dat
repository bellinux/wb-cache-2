5|$|A {{study of}} the {{estimated}} bite <b>force</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> canine teeth of a large sample of living and fossil mammalian predators, when adjusted for the body mass, found that for placental mammals the bite <b>force</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> canines (in newtons/kilogram of body weight) was greatest in the dire wolf (163), followed among the modern canids by the four hypercarnivores that often prey on animals larger than themselves: the African hunting dog (142), the gray wolf (136), the dhole (112), and the dingo (108). The bite <b>force</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> carnassials showed a similar trend to the canines. A predator's largest prey size is strongly influenced by its biomechanical limits. The morphology of the dire wolf {{was similar to that}} of its living relatives, and assuming that the dire wolf was a social hunter, then its high bite force relative to living canids suggests that it preyed on relatively large animals. The bite force rating of the bone-consuming spotted hyena (117) challenged the common assumption that high bite force in the canines and the carnassials was necessary to consume bone.|$|E

5|$|In United States v.

5|$|Advance {{elements}} of the 24th Infantry Division were badly defeated in the Battle of Osan on July 5, during the first battle between American and North Korean forces. The <b>force</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> battle, Task Force Smith, retreated from Osan, and U.S. forces were again defeated in the Battle of Pyongtaek. For over {{a week after the}} defeat of Task Force Smith, 24th Infantry Division soldiers were repeatedly defeated and forced south by the North Korean force's superior numbers and equipment. The regiments of the 24th Infantry Division were systematically pushed south at and around Chochiwon, Chonan, Pyongtaek, Hadong, and Yechon. These American soldiers, most of whom had experienced only occupation duty in Japan and no actual combat, were unprepared compared to the more disciplined North Korean units.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the changes in the tax rules that went into <b>force</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{beginning}} of 2016, plug-in electric car sales declined significantly. Sales {{during the first half of}} 2016 were down 64% from the same period in 2015. A total of 9,185 plug-in passenger cars were registered in the first three quarters of 2016, consisting of 6,567 plug-in hybrids and 2,618 all-electric cars. The market share of the plug-in car segment captured 3.2% of new car sales during the period. , the Outlander P-HEV remained as the all-time top-selling plug-in car in the country with 25,984 units registered, followed by the Volvo V60 Plug-in Hybrid (15,804), Volkswagen Golf GTE (10,691), Volkswagen Passat GTE (7,773), Mercedes-Benz C 350 e (6,226), and the Tesla Model S (6,049).|$|E
5|$|As the {{collapse}} continues, the rotation rate can increase {{to the point}} where the accreting protostar can break up due to centrifugal <b>force</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> equator. Thus the rotation rate must be braked during the first 100,000years to avoid this scenario. One possible explanation for the braking is the interaction of the protostar's magnetic field with the stellar wind in magnetic braking. The expanding wind carries away the angular momentum and slows down the rotation rate of the collapsing protostar.|$|E
5|$|At dawn on 6 April, the JNA {{launched}} a fresh attack towards Kupres and Kupreška Vrata, leaving {{the bulk of}} the 13th Partisan Brigade in reserve and employing the rest of the <b>force</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> plateau. The artillery was used so intensely that the 30th Partisan Division had to request resupply of its depleted stocks. The most effective part of the advance was the 9th Tank Company, which quickly pushed through the defensive positions, bypassed Zlosela and reached Olovo. In contrast, the Bosnian Croat TO command in Kupres was overwhelmed by the complexity of the situation and could not track which units it had at its disposal—even losing track of units physically near the command post.|$|E

5|$|Built for {{overseas}} service, Scharnhorst and Gneisenau {{were assigned}} to the East Asia Squadron in 1909 and 1910, respectively. Both ships had brief careers; shortly before the outbreak of World War I, the ships departed the German colony at Tsingtao. On 1 November 1914, the ships destroyed a British <b>force</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Battle of Coronel and inflicted upon the Royal Navy its first defeat since the Battle of Plattsburgh in 1814. The East Asia Squadron, including both Scharnhorst-class ships, was subsequently annihilated at the Battle of the Falkland Islands on 8 December.|$|E
5|$|By late November 1917, the Germans in East Africa {{were left}} with few options {{if they wanted to}} {{continue}} the war. They were outnumbered drastically and were split up into several different columns. The two largest of these, under Theodor Tafel and Paul Emil von Lettow-Vorbeck, were completely cut off from each other. Although von Lettow-Vorbeck's column had defeated a large British <b>force</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Battle of Mahiwa he had lost a large number of troops and expended virtually his entire supply of modern ammunition. With only antiquated weapons and no way of resupplying, von Lettow-Vorbeck decided to invade Portuguese East Africa in hopes of acquiring sufficient supplies to continue the war. There was no legal impediment to this attack; Germany had declared war on Portugal on 9 March 1916.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the British intervened {{directly}} in 1883, the Mahdi had set about conquering much of Sudan, at the time controlled by Egypt, and had won several critical victories that provided him great wealth and modern weaponry. Colonel William Hicks, British officer appointed commander of eight-thousand Egyptian soldiers and an extensive supply train, was given the simple objective of crushing the insurrection. Colonel Hicks and nearly every man in his army was killed by an overwhelming Mahdist <b>force</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Battle of El Obeid. After this defeat, and facing immense financial difficulties in Egypt, the British government decided not to pursue further offensive action and instead selected General Charles George Gordon to lead the evacuation effort, as thousands of civilians and pounds of equipment were to be withdrawn from outposts throughout Sudan.|$|E
