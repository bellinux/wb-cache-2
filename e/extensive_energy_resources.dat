40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the problems of managing residuals and environmental quality in a region facing potentially rapid growth as a consequence of externally made development decisions. The research adapted and applied the residuals environmental management concept which recognizes the need for an integration of physical methods, implementation incentives and institutional arrangements in controlling air, water and solid residuals. The area selected for study, the Uintah Basin in Southeastern utah, has the potential for <b>extensive</b> <b>energy</b> <b>resource</b> and mineral development and could experience a large population influx and accelerated economic growth as a result. in the face of a wide range of possible resource developments, the study used an alternative futures approach, in which combinations of exogenous events leading to different types and levels of economic activities and employment inpacts were identified. Economic and land use simulation models were applied to project the effects of the futures on the basin. Materials balances were then drawn up for major polluting activities to determine the residuals that would be produced and discharged to the environment if there were not controls. An environmental impact and management model, structured as al inear programming model, was used to evaluate environmental management strategies. The model incorporated various production processes and residuals treatment methods. Air and water quality simulation models were applied to assess environmental impacts and generate model constraints. Several dimesnsions of environmental management strategies were analyzed including alternative production processes, waste treatment methods, and various implementation incentives such as effluent charges, effluent standards and effects of legal restructions.

40|$|In a {{world where}} {{wireless}} sensor networks (WSNs) are increasing in importance in diverse fields, such as, industry, military, medical and home facilities. There is a constant effort to improve the network‘s utilization and extend its life cycle. The detection and handling of the bottlenecks in the WSNs is one area in which a significant effort is being made {{in order to achieve}} that goal. Bottlenecks cause an increment in the number of messages retransmitted over the WSN and for throughput deterioration and packet transmission latency to increase. Moreover, in case a sensor {{that is part of the}} bottleneck chain dies, some parts of the network would become inaccessible causing the network to be partitioned into several sections. In a network that consists out of low power supplied nodes prone to failure and characterized by random scattering, it is important that we detect the bottleneck nodes to prevent the network being taken out of use. The customary internet bottleneck detection tools and the latest WSNs detection tools, that I encountered, are not message complexity oriented. Unfortunately, this is an important character due to the <b>extensive</b> <b>energy</b> <b>resources</b> that are wasted in the course of packet transmission in a limited power supplied sensors network For example, the energ...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. This {{research}} identifies {{modes of}} market entry {{as well as}} strategies embarked on by South African companies that are currently {{doing business in the}} DRC. Data collection was performed through one–on–one interviews with executives of the South African companies that are in the different sectors of business in the DRC. Research has found that the mode adopted for entry was related to {{the degree to which the}} company has committed its resources, across all sectors involved. The DRC is potentially one of the richest countries in Africa, with rich mineral resources, timber (75 % of the country is forested) and <b>extensive</b> <b>energy</b> <b>resources,</b> however it is one of the poorest, with real GDP per capita falling from $ 380 in 1960 to $ 167 by 2010. The top–ranked countries in Africa are South Africa (29), Mauritius (32), and Namibia (42). Guinea–Bissau (173) and the Democratic Republic of Congo (175) rank lowest in the region. The Democratic Republic of Congo also ranks lowest in the world. Doing business in Africa became easier in 2005 – 2006 because reformers simplified business regulations, strengthened property rights, eased tax burdens, increased access to credit, and reduced the cost of exporting and importing. “Such progress is sorely needed. African countries would greatly benefit from new enterprises and jobs, which can come with more business–friendly regulations,” said Michael Klein, World Bank–IFC vice president for finance and private sector development and IFC chief economist. “Big improvements are possible. If an African country adopts the region’s best practices in the 10 areas covered by Doing Business, it would rank eleventh globally. ” Operational challenges in the DRC were found to be the same as what all emerging countries are experiencing in the continent, such as: lack of skills, corruption and lack of law enforcement, poor infrastructure, exchange rate volatility, successful informal sector, and crime and anti–South Africa sentiments. These challenges lead to higher costs of doing business in the DRC for South African companies. This research further gives a proposal for a model that South African companies can Modes of market entry and strategies for selected South African Companies doing business in the DRC consider as part of their strategic planning process when internationalising their business into the DRC.
