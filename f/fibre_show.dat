40|$|In {{this work}} a new {{configuration}} of a refractometric sensor for aqueous solutions {{based on the}} combination of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) with fibre Bragg gratings (FBG) is presented. Two FBGs are selected having reflection maxima in {{each side of the}} plasmon resonance peak. These FBGs enable a different processing scheme for the information provided by the SPR transducer. This improved interrogation method increases the sensitivity and resolution of the sensor compared with those obtained with the usual method of tracking the spectral transmittance minimum and makes the system performance independent of optical source power fluctuations.

This {{is due to a}} combination of high saturation power, low noise, immunity to crosstalk, low power requirement and the ability to work at high data rates. In addition, compatibility with existing fibre components is excellent, allowing all-optical fibre circuitry to be assembled with both active and passive components. This is particularly beneficial for the fibre amplifier, where splicing of the active fibre into the telecommunications link virtually eliminates, troublesome Fresnel-reflection feedback which normally limits the gain in semiconductor laser amplifiers. As such the application of EDFAs to high data rate long-haul communications, multichannel distribution networks and analog video distribution have been successfully demonstrated. This paper will discuss the characteristics of EDFAs, highlight their advantages and review current applications...|$|E

Experiments conducted on epoxy matrix composites reinforced with unidirectional Kevlar and carbon fibres (KFRP and CFRP) with a thin layer of thermoplastic coating, e. g. polyvinyl alcohol (PVAL), on the <b>fibre</b> <b>show</b> promising results for transverse fracture toughness without any significant loss in strength properties. Variation of fracture toughness with temperature is a direct manifestation of the dependence of the interface properties on the parameter studied. Interlaminar fracture toughness determined in mode I and mixed mode I/II delamination is also shown to be encouraging. Surface analysis of the fibre and composite interfaces confirms the distinctive failure mechanisms between the composites with and without the PVAL coating. A micromechanics analysis of the total fracture toughness arising from major failure mechanisms gives good agreement with experimental results. Characterization of the interface properties, including interfacial fracture toughness, residual clamping stress and coefficient of friction, using a fibre pull-out model based on a shear-lag analysis is discussed and applied to evaluate experimental data obtained in these composites...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Electrical and Electronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2009. The PBMR {{has called}} for {{research}} into the possibility of distributed in-core temperature measurement. In this thesis, several methods for distributed temperature measurement in high-pressure, -radiation and -temperature environments have been investigated {{by means of a}} literature study. The literature study has revealed FBG temperature sensors as the most feasible solution to the temperature measurement challenge. Various parameters affecting the propagation of light in optical fibres and consequently the FBG reflection profile was researched. The differential equations describing FBG structures were solved and implemented in Matlab in order to simulate WDM of a distributed FBG sensing system. Distributed sensing with apodized FBGs written in sapphire optical <b>fibre</b> <b>show</b> the most promise of becoming a solution to the measurement challenge. However, practical testing of sapphire FBGs exposed to the environment in the PBMR core is required. With this long-term goal in mind, a general test platform for FBG temperature sensors was assembled. A heater controller was built for a specialized fibre heating element capable of controlling the temperature of a single FBG up to 1600 C. Temperature measurement using wavelength division multiplexing of apodized FBGs written in silica optical fibre were demonstrated in the test platform with great success. The measured results corresponded very well with the theory. Finally, the implementation of FBGs in the PBMR is discussed and recommendations are made for future wor...|$|E

40|$|Today, global {{environmental}} issues, such as {{global warming and}} fossil depletion, drive a paradigm shift in material applications from conventional fossil sources to renewable sources. Following this trend, the topic of this thesis is to analyse the use of biobased resources for fibre reinforced composite fabrication. Currently {{the most widely used}} fibre reinforced composites are composed of glass fibre reinforcements and polymeric matrices. In this thesis, the biobased alternative, i. e. flax fibre, {{which is one of the}} most widely used natural fibres, is studied as a glass fibre substitute from an environmental impact point of view. Moreover, a newly emerging biobased polymer, the wheat gluten, is analysed in the study; and it is compared to a conventional polymer and to a commercially available biobased polymer from environmental impact perspective. The main question addressed in this thesis is whether there are general environmental advantages for the use of flax fibres over glass fibres, and for the wheat gluten polymer over petrochemical polymers. Although biobased materials are often perceived to be environmentally friendly, an in-depth analysis is still needed to answer this question. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is considered to be an appropriate tool for environmental impact quantification. The thesis addresses the following research objectives: (i) to deliver life cycle inventory data for the flax fibre and wheat gluten; (ii) to perform LCA studies on flax fibres compared to glass fibres in composite reinforcement applications and on wheat gluten polymer compared to the conventional low density polyethylene (LDPE) and commercially available biobased polymer polylactic acid (PLA); (iii) to conduct an in-depth analysis concerning sensitivity and uncertainty to obtain information on the robustness of the obtained results. As the initial step, a detailed life cycle inventory for flax cultivation in Northern France is documented. Field emissions associated with the nitrogen cycle are estimated both from a process-oriented DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) method and the generic Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) method. Since the IPCC method is derived from field measurements at sites with various soil types, climate conditions, and crops, it is subject to relatively large uncertainty. In contrast, the outputs from the DNDC method are believed to be more accurate because this method is constructed based on complex biochemical models from soil science and makes use of site specific data. The comparison of the results lead to the conclusion that the emission factors from the DNDC method and the recommended values from the IPCC method for flax cultivation in Northern France are quite different. The DNDC based emission factor for direct N 2 O emission, which is a strong greenhouse gas, is by a quarter to half lower than the recommended emission factor according to the IPCC method. The DNDC method leads to a reduction of 17 % in the impact category of climate change per kg retted flax straw production in comparison to the level obtained from the IPCC method. Different co-product accounting principles: mass allocation, economic allocation, and system expansion are investigated for the flax fibre extraction process. The impact results per kg flax hackled long <b>fibre</b> <b>show</b> that economic allocation and system expansion lead to similar values, while the mass allocation approach leads to significantly lower values among all impact categories. Furthermore, methods including the statistical fitting, qualitative judgement, and expert-judgement are integrated to parameterise the important inventory data to run a Monte-Carlo simulation for uncertainty analysis. In the case of the climate change impact category, the uncertainty levels through the mass allocation, economic allocation, and system expansion are compared for the results. It is found that the system expansion approach implies the highest level of uncertainty due to inclusion of additional external processes, while the mass allocation leads to the lowest uncertainty. The uncertainty level related to economic allocation is significantly higher than the mass allocation, which can be caused by fluctuating prices of flax (co-) products. With a reliable impact assessment on flax fibre production and with the economic allocation method is used, the study further extends to a comparison of flax fibres and glass fibres in composite applications. The Ashby method is used to ensure functionally equivalent designs. A so-called life cycle environmental impact indicator (LEI) has been introduced. Such LEI is derived from the material mass indices illustrated in the Ashy method. The material mass indices contain only material intrinsic properties and are proportional to the product mass while ensuring equal functionality (e. g. stiffness, strength, etc.) for a specified structure and loading type. Then the LEI can be constructed by using unit environmental impact values (e. g. climate change, fossil depletion, and etc.) in production, use, and EoL, and multiplying these with the mass indices. The LEI highlights three important variables severely influencing the outcome of comparative studies based on this indicator method: the replacement ratio, the specific fuel saving (in case of transport applications), and the fibre volume fraction. The first parameter addresses the concern that flax FRPs are likely to fail earlier than conventional FRPs. Therefore, more flax FRP components are needed for the expected lifespan. The specific fuel saving denotes how much fuel can be saved by a certain weight reduction over a total transport distance. Since flax fibres have a much lower density than conventional glass fibres, flax FRPs can facilitate structures with reduced weight. Therefore flax FPRs are likely to contribute to lower fuel consumption rates. The third parameter, the flax volume fraction, influences the mechanical properties of flax FRPs. Constructed on the polypropylene (PP) matrix, two types of flax FRP products: the flax mat-PP (panel) and short flax fibre-PP (strut), produced via compression moulding and injection moulding, respectively, have been evaluated for multiple impact categories using the ReCiPe method for fixed values of the fibre volume fraction and specific fuel reduction. Compared to a 9 kg glass mat-PP with 20 vol% fibre content, with the equal stiffness criterion under bending, the flax mat-PP with 20 vol% leads to a reduced mass design (7. 8 kg). In contrast, with an equal stiffness criterion under tension, the short flax fibre-PP is similarily heavy (9. 2 kg) as the corresponding GFRP (9 kg). The LCA study compared the environmental impact of flax FRPs and GFRPs within Europe in non-transport use (production plus EoL phases) and transport use. Over the production and EoL phases, the flax mat-PP exhibits lower values for most environmental impact categories than its corresponding glass fibre based counterpart. For most categories, the reductions can reach 20 %~ 50 %. In particular, a 23 % reduction in the climate change category and a 24 % reduction in fossil depletion are documented. Moreover, for the impact categories of ozone depletion and human toxicity reductions of up to 70 % can be achieved. On the other hand, replacing the short glass fibre-PP by short flax fibre-PP only results in modest environmental impact reductions in multiple impact categories, including the impact categories of climate change and fossil depletion where only reductions of around 10 % are recorded. Coming to the full life cycle impact, the saved fuel consumption during the use phase could be very significant depending on the lifetime distance travelled. In 14 out of 17 impact categories, lower life cycle impact results can be observed for the flax mat-PP. However, in case of the short flax fibre-PP compared to short glass fibre-PP, the two material systems lead to very similar environmental impact values in multiple categories due to their very similar mass. Subsequently, a consequential life cycle analysis (CLCA) is conducted to capture how overall environmental impact will change when shifting from glass fibres to flax fibres as reinforcements in composite fabrication. With certain assumptions, the marginal flax fibre supply is identified to be a combination of Chinese flax fibre (70 %) and French flax fibre (30 %). Due to inferior cultivars and coal-fired electricity in Chinese flax cultivation, the CLCA study reveals that flax mat-PP has 0. 8 ~ 2 times higher environmental impact values than the glass mat-PP in most environmental impact categories over the production and end-of-life (EoL) phases. For the purpose of providing potential trajectories of marginal flax fibre supply, additional all French fibre, and all Chinese fibre scenarios are also evaluated, formulating the lower and upper boundaries in terms of environmental impact change, respectively. The attributional fibre supply mix scenario is supplied as well. The all French fibre scenario leads to better scores than glass fibre composites in most impact categories; while the break-even mix lies at attributional supply mix scenario since it presents a close eco-profile to that of glass mat-PP. All of these scenarios are useful for policy analysis. Finally, the study quantifies the life cycle impact for wheat gluten based materials. The contribution serves as a base assessment which can feed into the evaluation of any future wheat-gluten based product. The study evaluates wheat gluten based packaging film and compares it with low density polyethylene LDPE and PLA film over the life cycle of these products. Scenarios including extrusion and casting for film production; incineration with energy recovery and composting for end-of-life treatments are evaluated. The comparison offers insight into the environmental benefits of using wheat gluten over conventional plastic film as well as its biobased alternative and identifies its optimal production and disposal methods. For wheat gluten production, the LCA results show that the impacts of the wheat cultivation and gluten drying phase are dominant in the majority of the impact categories in the ReCiPe midpoint assessment method. The LCA results also exhibit that the scenario with wheat gluten film produced by extrusion and incinerated to recover embodied energy is favourable from an environmental perspective. It offers great benefits in climate change and fossil depletion over LDPE film and in 14 impact categories over PLA film. Although wheat gluten film suffers from common problems for biobased materials (e. g. land occupation), the overall environmental performance indicates that wheat gluten represents a promising source for biobased polymer productionTABLE OF CONTENT TABLE OF CONTENT	I LIST OF FIGURES	V LIST OF TABLES	VII LIST OF ABRIVATIONS	IX ABSTRACT	XI SAMENVATTING	XIII CHAPTER 1 GENERAL INTRODUCTION	 1 1. 1.

In all organs studied, cholinergic innervation was more developed than noradrenergic innervation.

A similar abundance of noradrenergic nerve <b>fibres</b> (<b>showing</b> immunoreactivity both to TH and DβH) was also found in both layers of the SV and BU (but not in the prostate). In the prostate a moderate density of VIP-IR nerve fibres was present but only very scarce NPY-IR nerve <b>fibres</b> were <b>shown.</b> All the studied accessory sexual glands (ASG) of male sheep contained VIP-IR nerve fibres in a similar frequency.

40|$|Graphene nanoplatelets {{have been}} {{introduced}} into the interphase between electrically insulating glass fibre and polymer matrix to functionalize the traditional composite. Owing to the distribution of network structure of GNPs, the interphase can transfer the signals about various internal change of material. Consequently, due to the novel bio-inspired overlapping structure, our GNPs-glass <b>fibre</b> <b>shows</b> a unique opportunity as a micro-scale multifunctional sensor. The following conclusions {{can be drawn from}} present research: •	We prepared GNPs solution via a scalable and highly effective liquid-phase exfoliation method. This method produces high-quality, unoxidized graphene flakes from flake graphite. We control the thickness and size of GNPs by varying the centrifugation rate. •	A simple fibre oriented capillary flow which can suppress ‘coffee ring’ effect to deposit GNPs onto the curved glass fibre surface. The GNPs form continuous fish scales like overlapping structure. •	The electrical conductivity of our GNPs-glass <b>fibre</b> <b>shows</b> semiconductive property. The electrical resistance value scattering and the advancing contact angle value scattering indicate a uniform deposit structure. The uniform overlapping structure is a key factor for higher electrical conductivity compared with our previous work with CNTs. •	The contact angles of our GNPs-glass fibre with water indicate that the GNPs are almost unoxidized, so the inert GNPs coating decreases the interfacial shears strength. •	A micro scale GNPs-glass fibre sensor for gas sensing is achieved by deposit GNPs onto glass fibre surface. This sensor can be used to detect solvents vapours, such as water, ethanol and acetone. All these vapours work as electron acceptor when reacting with GNPs. The acetone shows the highest sensitivity (45000 %) compared with water and ethanol. •	The doping-dedoping of GNPs-glass fibres during adsorption-desorption cycles of acetone result in the efficient “break-junction” (GNPs lost electron carrier concentration) mechanism, which provides the possibility to fabricate the electrochemical “switch” in a simple and unique way. •	The resistance of our GNPs-glass <b>fibre</b> <b>shows</b> exponential relationship with RH. This is attributed to two points. Firstly, the water vapours show similar exponential adsorption on carbon surface; secondly, the bandgap of GNPs increases with the increase of adsorbed water vapour concentration. •	Due to the weak van der Waals interaction when water molecules are adsorbed on GNPs surface, our GNPs-glass <b>fibre</b> <b>shows</b> extreme fast response and recovery time with RH. It is potential for our GNPs-glass fibre being used to monitor the breath frequency. •	Utilizing the negative temperature coefficient of GNPs, our GNPs-glass fibre can be used as temperature sensor with a sensing region of - 150 to 30 °C. •	Through the observed abnormal resistance change at a temperature of about – 18 °C, we discovered a phase change of the trance confined water in graphene layers. Based on the resistance change, we can study the interaction of water and carbon nanoparticles. •	The bio-inspired novel overlapped multilayer structure of GNPs coating shows structural colours. Even more, our GNPs-glass fibre can be used to monitor the loading force in the interphase when it is embedded into epoxy resin. •	Our GNPs-glass <b>fibre</b> <b>shows</b> an excellent piezoresistive property, the single GNPs-glass <b>fibre</b> <b>shows</b> a larger gauge factor than the commercial strains sensor. •	The semiconductive interphase was formed when the GNPs-glass fibre was embedded in polymer matrix. This semiconductive interphase is very sensitive to the deformation of material, therefore, an in-situ strain sensor was manufactured to real-time monitor the microcracks in a composite instead of external sensors. The area of resistance ‘jump’ increase {{can be seen as the}} feature area for damage’s early warning. •	Monitoring the resistance variation of the single fibre composite was conducted under cyclic loading with progressively increasing the strain peaks in order to further investigate the response of in-situ sensor to the interphase damage process. The deviation of resistance/strain when the stress is larger than 2 % highlights the accumulation of damage, which gives insight into the mechanism of resistance change...|$|R
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the geochemical pattern of fluid infiltration in the extensional detachment of Tinos Island (Cyclades, Greece). Ion microprobe O-isotope analyses and fluid inclusion {{studies have been conducted}} in strain fringes developing around pyrite blasts in the mylonite of the shear zone. Micro-scale traverses in quartz and calcite <b>fibres</b> <b>show</b> that δ 18 O increases from 17 - 18 to 20 - 21 ‰ in 1 mm towards the blast, drops of 3 ‰ in ∼ 200 μm, then rises again in the direction of growth. δ 18 O variations are interpreted as transient influxes of exotic fluids into the shear zone between periods of closed system buffering by the host rock. Fluid inclusions trapped in the <b>fibres</b> <b>show</b> fluctuating salinities (0 - 4 wt% NaCl eq.) and densities that reflect drops of the pore pressure from lithostatic (λ= 1) to hydrostatic (λ= 0. 4) values during fringe growth. Isotopic and microthermometric data are consistent with models of seismic pumping developed for compressive shear zones. We therefore suggest that co-seismic pore pressure variations developed suction forces sufficient to drive large-scale fluid migration in the Tinos detachment, as in convergent tectonic settings...|$|R
40|$|The post-larval {{growth of}} lateral white muscle was studied in eels at {{different}} stages of post-larval development (glass, yellow and silver eels) by means of histochemical methods for myosin-ATPase (mATPase) activity, immunohistochemistry (for myosin isoforms) and electron microscopy. Morphological, histo- and immunohistochemical data reveal a uniform appearance of white muscle in glass eels, whereas in following stages the typical mosaic appearance is present. Small-diameter <b>fibres</b> <b>show</b> a more acid-labile mATPase activity than large fibres and react with anti-F, anti-FHC and anti-S sera, but not with anti-SHC serum. In the silver stage, the small fibres tend to decrease in number as the size of the eels increases. Electron microscopy reveals the presence of satellite cells at every stage: in glass eels there are also ‘activated’ elements showing scarce myofilaments in their cytoplasm; in yellow eels very small fibres are present, enveloped within the basal lamina of well-differentiated muscle fibres; in silver eels there are no <b>fibres</b> <b>showing</b> signs of immaturity. Presumably the post-larval development of white muscle involves in juvenile eels a substantial recruitment of fibres from the satellite cell population; later the hyperplasia decreases or ceases and hypertrophy remains the only mechanism for muscle growth...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to study the effect of sympathetic innervation on morphological and histochemical aspects of skeletal muscle tissue. Rabbit masseter muscle was studied using histochemical and immunohistochemical methods for periods of up to 18 months post-sympathectomy. The morphological and enzymatic characteristics of control masseter muscles were similar on both the left and right sides. The main features were muscle fibres with a mosaic pattern and a predominance of type IIa fibres, followed by type I. Type IIb <b>fibres</b> <b>showed</b> very low frequency. Sympathectomized animals showed varying degrees of metabolic and morphological alterations, especially 18 months after sympathectomy. The first five groups showed a higher frequency of type I fibres, whilst the oldest group showed a higher frequency of type IIb fibres. In the oldest group, a significant variation in fibre diameter was observed. Many <b>fibres</b> <b>showed</b> small diameter, atrophy, hypertrophy, splitting, and necrosis. Areas with fibrosis were observed. Thus cervical sympathectomy induced morphological alterations in the masseter muscles. These alterations were, in part, similar to both denervation and myopathy. These findings indicate that sympathetic innervation contributes to the maintenance of the morphological and metabolic features of masseter muscle fibres...|$|R
