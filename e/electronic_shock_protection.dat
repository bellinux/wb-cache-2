40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} results of shock experiments conducted to demonstrate the advantages of two novel shock-protection technologies: 1) nonlinear spring shock stops and 2) soft coating shock stops. Both technologies basically employ the conventional idea of hard shock stops to decouple de-vice design from shock-protection design but are specialized to re-duce impact force, {{which is one of}} the drawbacks of hard stops. In addition, they enable wafer-level and batch fabrication processes compatible with microfabrication techniques. We designed test devices to reflect the effect of impact force and fabricated them using silicon microbeams (nonlinear springs) or Parylene coating (soft coating). After conducting multiple shock tests (up to 2500 g), we demonstrate that the shock-survival rates of test devices are considerably improved in both our novel technologies (nonlinear spring: 88 %, soft coating: 94 %) compared to conventional hard stops (4 %). Moreover, we demonstrated that <b>shock</b> <b>protection</b> is improved by optimizing the design of shock springs. Finally, we analyzed dynamics of flexible beams and identified a new device-fracture mechanism induced by impact force, which is different from conventionally known mechanisms.

40|$|Nowadays, many boar {{reproduction}} researches {{are directed}} to improve extenders {{and to increase}} cold <b>shock</b> <b>protection</b> of semen. Little research {{is focused on the}} influence of egg yolk combined with alternative cold shock protective media. Egg yolk could interfere with other compounds present in the extender composition. The influence of egg yolk addition was assessed in boar sperm cells, cooled at 5 ºC, to elucidate its effect on motility and membrane integrity. Flow Cytometry and Computer Assisted Semen Analysis (CASA) were used to determine the rate of sperm with intact plasma and acrosomal membrane, respectively the sperm cells motility. Statistical analyses (T-Test) were performed using GraphPad Prism version 5. 00. Androhep Plus supplemented with 20 % egg yolk (AhPlus+ 20 %EY) indicated a higher cold <b>shock</b> <b>protection</b> in progressive motility (93. 9 ± 2. 64 %) and membrane integrity (79. 78 ± 4. 14 %), rather than the extender without egg yolk (p 0. 05).

40|$|Abstract Cross {{tolerance}} is {{a phenomenon}} that occurs when a plant, in resisting one form of stress, develops a tolerance to another form. Pretreatment with nonlethal heat shock {{has been known to}} protect cells from metal stress. In this study, we found that the treatment of rice roots with more than 25 μM of Cu 2 + caused cell death. However, heat shock pretreatment attenuated Cu 2 +-induced cell death. The mechanisms of the cross tolerance phenomenon between heat shock and Cu 2 + stress were investigated by pretreated rice roots with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX). CHX eVectively block heat <b>shock</b> <b>protection,</b> suggesting that protection of Cu 2 +-induced cell death by heat shock was dependent on de novo protein synthesis. In addition, heat pretreatment downregulated ROS production and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activities, both of which can be greatly elicited by Cu 2 + stress in rice roots. Moreover, the addition of puriWed recombinant GST–OsHSP 70 fusion proteins inhibited Cu 2 +-enhanced MAPK activities in an in vitro kinase assay. Furthermore, loss of heat <b>shock</b> <b>protection</b> was observed in Arabidopsis mkk 2 and mpk 6 but not in mpk 3 mutants under Cu 2 + stress. Taken together, these results suggest that the interaction of OsHSP 70 with MAPKs may contribute to the cellular protection in rice roots from excessive Cu 2 + toxicity...|$|R

5000|$|The second {{generation}} {{also saw the}} introduction of Super Select 4WD (SS4) as ActivTrak 4WD in some markets, multimode ABS, which were firsts on Japanese four-wheel drives, and <b>electronic</b> <b>shock</b> absorber. SS4 was ground-breaking {{in the sense that}} it combined the advantages of part-time and full-time four-wheel drive with four available options: 2H (high-range rear-wheel drive), 4H (high-range full-time four-wheel drive), 4HLc (high-range four-wheel drive with locked center differential) and 4LLc (low-range four-wheel drive with locked center differential). Another advantage of this {{second generation}} system is that it gave the driver the ability to switch between two-wheel drive and full-time four-wheel drive at speeds up to 100 km/h (62 mph), whereas the first generation Pajero had to be stationary to switch from rear-wheel drive to four-wheel drive (but not from four-wheel drive back to rear-wheel drive). In addition to the SS4, an air locking differential was included as factory option. Either 4HLc or 4LLc mode must be engaged to perform this operation. Multimode ABS, on the other hand, was equally innovative. This meant ABS would be fully functional in all modes of SS4, as braking with a locked center differential requires completely different braking parameters. The new <b>electronic</b> <b>shock</b> absorber was also factory option with three settings: S (soft), M (medium), and H (hard). This meant driver can change ride quality and handling depending on road conditions via a switch on center console.|$|R

If metal bracelets are used they should be made of the same metal alloy as the watch case to prevent corrosion of the metal with the lower PRE-factor as it will act as a sacrificial anode.

40|$|Abstract: The use of vibro-impact (VI) {{attachments}} as {{shock absorbers}} is studied. By considering different configurations of primary linear oscillators with VI attachments, {{the capacity of}} these attachments to passively absorb and dissipate significant portions of shock energy applied to the primary systems is investigated. Parametric studies are performed to determine the depen-dence of energy dissipation by the VI attachment {{in terms of its}} parameters. Moreover, non-linear shock spectra are used to demonstrate that appropriately designed VI attachments can signifi-cantly reduce the maximum levels of vibration of primary systems over wide frequency ranges. This is in contrast to the classical linear vibration absorber, whose action is narrowband. In addition, it is shown that VI attachments can significantly reduce or even completely eliminate resonances appearing in the linear shock spectra, thus providing strong, robust, and broadband <b>shock</b> <b>protection</b> to the primary structures to which they are attached...|$|R
