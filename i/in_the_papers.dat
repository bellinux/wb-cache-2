5|$|Pound {{was fascinated}} by the {{translations}} of Japanese poetry and Noh plays which he discovered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>papers</b> of Ernest Fenollosa, an American professor who had taught in Japan. Fenollosa had studied Chinese poetry under Japanese scholars; in 1913 his widow, Mary McNeil Fenollosa, decided to give his unpublished notes to Pound after seeing his work; she was looking for someone who cared about poetry rather than philology. Pound edited and published Fenellosa's The Chinese Written Character as a Medium for Poetry in 1918.|$|E

During the Second World War he fought in the Battle of France. He then {{became one of the}} first to make his way to Britain to fight with the Free French under General Charles de Gaulle, adopting the nom de guerre of Leclerc so that his wife and children would not be put at risk if his name appeared <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>papers.</b> He was sent to French Equatorial Africa, where he rallied local leaders to the Free French cause, and led a force against Gabon, whose leaders supported Vichy France.
