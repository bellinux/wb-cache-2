Goldstein joined WTNH as a meteorologist in 1986. He became somewhat of a local celebrity in Connecticut from these broadcasts, eventually becoming WTNH's chief meteorologist. In 1999, he authored the Complete Idiot's Guide to Weather. He held the honorary title of Director Emeritus at the Western Connecticut State University Weather Center.|$|E
50|$|The WC-130 {{provides}} vital {{tropical cyclone}} <b>forecasting</b> <b>information</b> {{and is the}} primary weather data collector for the National Hurricane Center, supplemented by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration's WP-3D Orion. They penetrate tropical cyclones and hurricanes at altitudes ranging from 500 to 10000 ft above the ocean surface depending upon {{the intensity of the}} storm. The most important function of these reconnaissance aircraft is to collect high-density, high-accuracy weather data from within the storm's environment. This includes penetration of the center or hurricane eye of the storm. This vital information is instantly relayed by satellite to the National Hurricane Center to aid in the accurate forecasting of hurricane movement and intensity.|$|E
50|$|After {{populations of}} large whales were {{decimated}} by whaling {{in the last}} two centuries, several species are rebounding. Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary is a seasonal home to several species of those large whales. From Early Spring to late Fall the sanctuary sees increasing numbers of humpback, blue and fin whales- with seasonally migrating gray whales transiting the sanctuary on their trips between the North Pacific and the lagoons of Baja California. At times, large whales aggregate in tremendous numbers, with as many as 186 unique photo identifications occurring in a single day. Understanding the causes of this aggregation, such as bloom dynamics of the krill the whales feed on, can provide valuable <b>forecasting</b> <b>information</b> to predict where whales are likely to be in the near term. This information in turn could aid in reducing whale-ship interactions. Ongoing work has focused on behavioral responses of large whales to close encounters with large vessels transiting the Santa Barbara Channel. This work is being extended to focus on two problems: how variability in krill depth is key to whale decision making, and how the whales are selecting specific sized prey within pools of mixed-age krill. To get after these questions, sanctuary staff and contractors are combining an ongoing program of tagging large whales with time-depth-location recording tags with systematic mapping of krill fields around the sanctuary. The sanctuary is assisting the work of partners from Cascadia Research Collective and Scripps Institution of Oceanography.|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{important}} {{problem of how}} to assure credible <b>forecast</b> <b>information</b> sharing between a supplier and a manufacturer. The supplier is responsible for acquiring the necessary capacity before receiving an order from the manufacturer who possesses private <b>forecast</b> <b>information</b> for her end product. We address how different contracts affect the supplier's capacity decision and, hence, the profitability of the supplier and the manufacturer. We fully develop two contracts (and provide explicit formulae) to enable credible <b>forecast</b> <b>information</b> sharing. The first is a nonlinear capacity reservation contract under which the manufacturer agrees to pay a fee to reserve capacity. The second is an advance purchase contract under which the manufacturer is induced to place a firm order before the supplier secures the component capacity used to build the end product. These contracts serve a strategic role in information sharing. The capacity reservation contract enables the supplier to detect the manufacturer's private <b>forecast</b> <b>information,</b> while the advance purchase contract enables the manufacturer to signal her <b>forecast</b> <b>information.</b> We show that channel coordination is possible even under asymmetric <b>forecast</b> <b>information</b> by combining the advance purchase contract with an appropriate payback agreement. Through our structural and numerical results we also show that the degree of <b>forecast</b> <b>information</b> asymmetry and the risk-adjusted profit margin are two important drivers that determine supply chain efficiency and which contract to adopt. game theory, screening, signaling, coordination, supply contracts, capacity reservation, advance purchase, payback, asymmetric <b>information,</b> <b>forecast...</b>|$|R

This thesis is a case study exploring the practice of rolling forecasts as a dynamic management tool within an organization – namely FiGo. Through qualitative research method, the study aims to get an in-depth understanding of how <b>forecasting</b> <b>information,</b> in a longitudinal perspective, affects top management interaction. Specifically we investigate: (a) how top management make use of forecasting information; (b) what changes has affected the <b>forecasting</b> <b>information</b> and influenced top management discussions; and (c) what challenges in regards of forecasting processes have affected top management attention. Our main findings indicate that top management strives that rolling forecasts is used in the whole organization, {{and that there is a}} consistently business understanding. Rolling forecasts and the <b>forecasting</b> <b>information</b> is an important tool for knowledge sharing, learning, and reflection at top management level. The study finds that there is a cultural change going on, together with an anchoring of the Beyond Budgeting mindset, which has led to an increased business understanding and more accurate <b>forecasting</b> <b>information.</b> However, the top management faces a big challenge due to variation in the use of rolling forecast, and still having “old budget mindset” in the organization, which increase the forecasting uncertainty and decrease forecasting accuracy. The top management has a standardization agenda in mind, trying to solve these problems, and manage to get comparable <b>forecasting</b> <b>information</b> from the whole organization. The study finds that there is a decoupling and a tension between how the top management wants the forecasts to be used, and what the operational levels in the organization needs. nhhma...|$|E

The strategy is based on the solution of a receding-horizon stochastic dynamic optimization problem. This permits the direct incorporation of economic objectives, statistical <b>forecast</b> <b>information,</b> and operational constraints.
