5000|$|A {{latching}} relay (also called [...] "impulse", [...] "keep", or [...] "stay" [...] relays) maintains either contact position indefinitely without power {{applied to the}} coil. The advantage is that one coil consumes power only for an instant while the relay is being switched, and the relay contacts retain this setting across a power outage. A {{latching relay}} allows remote control of building lighting without the hum that may be produced from a continuously (AC) <b>energized</b> <b>coil.</b>|$|E
50|$|Sometimes an {{economizer}} circuit is also installed {{to reduce the}} power required to keep a contactor closed; an auxiliary contact reduces coil current after the contactor closes. A somewhat greater amount of power is required to initially close a contactor than is required to keep it closed. Such a circuit can save {{a substantial amount of}} power and allow the <b>energized</b> <b>coil</b> to stay cooler. Economizer circuits are nearly always applied on direct-current contactor coils and on large alternating current contactor coils.|$|E
40|$|Magnetic field {{modeling}} {{is extremely}} important for electromagnetic (EM) driven spherical actuators. This paper proposes a novel mathematic modeling method based on equivalent <b>energized</b> <b>coil</b> and Biot-Savart law to formulate the complex magnetic field distribution in three-dimensional (3 D) space. The <b>energized</b> <b>coil</b> model is employed as an equivalent substitution of cylindrical permanent magnet (PM) poles. The magnetic field distribution of single <b>energized</b> <b>coil</b> is then formulated analytically. The complete magnetic field model of the actuator with multiple cylindrical PM poles is thus achieved from linear superpositions. Compared with other conventional approaches, as there are no omission of high order of harmonic terms, shape approximation of magnet poles and assumption of evenly distributed flux field, it helps to improve the modeling accuracy. Furthermore, this method is more generic for other flux field applications. It is available for both PM and EM poles, and theoretically could be implemented for other magnet shapes. The computational time may increase for complex magnet shapes and distribution patterns. The proposed method {{is applied to the}} spherical actuator with novel 3 D magnetic pole array that helps to improve the actuator torque output. Numerical computation is conducted to validate the derived analytical magnetic field model. It shows that the analytical model fits with the result from finite element method (FEM) closely. A research prototype and an automatic experimental platform have been developed. Experiment is thus conducted to measure the magnetic field distribution of the spherical actuator. The data comparison shows that the analytical model matches the experimental measurement result well. The developed model can be employed for subsequent study of torque formulation and control implementation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

Methods: The tracks of the gradient coils are modified by cutting slits along the current flow direction. The electromagnetic model developed was first experimentally validated and then used to study the impacts of the slit conductors on the energized and surrounding coils. In this study, gradient coils were slit with different numbers of sub-Tracks and driven by a current with frequencies ranging from 100 Hz to 10 kHz.

40|$|This report {{considers}} {{a system for}} transferring electric power from shore to ships for charging of electrical driven ferries by use of induction power transfer (IPT). The IPT works by leading an alternating current through a coil stationed on shore which creates a time-varying magnetic field. This magnetic field will, through an air gap induce a voltage in another coil stationed on a ship, {{making it possible to}} transfer power wirelessly. This system will, as well as transferring power to the receiving coil also produce a time-varying magnetic field in the nearby surroundings which practically can be considered a leakage field, but can to some extent also be defined as electromagnetic radiation. In Norway, regulations regarding both ionizing and non-ionizing radiation are given by the Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority (NRPA). The IPT system operates in frequencies from 3 &# 150; 5 kHz and therefore the magnetic leakage field is considered as non-ionizing radiation. Requirements given by NRPA do not say anything specific about permitted levels of magnetic field strength because it varies with frequency, but says generally that it should be as low as practically possible and refer to reference levels given in guidelines published by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). To obtain an overview of the radiation created by the IPT and how it complies with the reference levels, the system is modelled in COMSOL Multiphysics with one specific configuration of the coils and the current. The simulations have shown that the IPT will create time-varying magnetic fields that cause radiation above reference levels given in the ICNIRP guidelines; however the effect to the surroundings can be significantly reduced by use of screening such as aluminum plates in various configurations. The method used for modelling the IPT system has been verified by modelling an actual coil found in storage at SINTEF Energy research. This coil had been energized with a current of 10 A and the magnetic flux density created by the <b>energized</b> <b>coil</b> has been measured and compared with COMSOL simulations. </p...|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} few years, there has been {{considerable}} interest in using saturated magnetic objective lenses in high resolution electron microscopes. Such lenses, in present commercial electron microscopes, are energized either by conventional or superconducting coils.

50|$|Inductive {{pumps are}} {{considered}} highly accurate and energy efficient. Inductive pumps use two primary parameters to control flow, they are Rate and Dwell. Rate {{is used to}} determine the number of strokes per second or in any given time interval. Dwell is used to control the length of time the <b>energizing</b> <b>coil</b> remains on during the Rate cycle. Essentially if the piston has completed its stroke and is waiting for the reverse cycle to occur, {{there is no need to}} continue <b>energizing</b> the <b>coil</b> as most of this energy will be converted to heat as no more work is being done by the piston. The Dwell setting allows adjustment of this ON time during the rate cycle. Also the Dwell setting allows for a true pressure control parameter for the pump. By reducing the Dwell time even further one can reduce the total energy applied to the piston during the pumping cycle. This can reduce the maximum output pressure during pumping. This differs from many other pumps as they commonly reduce flow to reduce pressure in a given circumstance, however if an occlusion occurs to the output channel other pumps tend to build up to their maximum pressure until they either burst the tubing or damage their internal mechanism. Inductive pumps can be shut off at the outlet and will not exceed the pressure they are set at. Pumping against a close output does not cause damage to the pump.|$|R

Normally closed (NC) contacts disconnect the circuit when the relay is activated; the circuit is connected when the relay is inactive. All of the contact forms involve combinations of NO and NC connections.|$|R
5000|$|The rotary {{converter}} {{can be thought}} of as a motor-generator, where the two machines share a single rotating armature and set of field coils. The basic construction of the {{rotary converter}} consists of a DC generator (dynamo) with a set of slip rings tapped into its rotor windings at evenly spaced intervals. When a dynamo is spun the electric currents in its rotor windings alternate as it rotates in the magnetic field of the stationary field windings. This alternating current is rectified by means of a commutator which allows DC current to be extracted from the rotor. This principle is taken advantage of by energizing the same rotor windings with AC power which causes the machine to act as a synchronous AC motor. The rotation of the <b>energized</b> <b>coils</b> excites the stationary field windings producing part of the DC current. The other part is AC current from the slip rings which is directly rectified into DC by the commutator. This makes the rotary converter a hybrid dynamo and mechanical rectifier. When used in this way it is referred to as a synchronous rotary converter or simply a synchronous converter. The AC slip rings also allow the machine to act as an alternator.|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} low gravity, aircraft-based, {{experiments}} {{was conducted to}} investigate the combustion of supported thermoplastic polymer spheres under varying ambient conditions. The three types of thermoplastic investigated were polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), polypropylene (PP). and polystyrene (PS). Spheres with diameters ranging from 2 mm to 6. 35 mm were tested. The total initial pressure varied from 0. 05 MPa to 0. 15 MPa whereas the ambient oxygen concentration varied from 19 % to 30 % (by volume). The ignition system consisted {{of a pair of}} retractable <b>energized</b> <b>coils.</b> Two CCD cameras recorded the burning histories of the spheres. The video sequences revealed a number of dynamic events including bubbling and sputtering, as well as soot shell formation and break-up during combustion of the spheres at reduced gravity. The ejection of combusting material from the burning spheres represents a fire hazard that must be considered at reduced gravity. The ejection process was found to be sensitive to polymer type. All average burning rates were measured to increase with initial sphere diameter and oxygen concentration, whereas the initial pressure had little effect. The three thermoplastic types exhibited different burning characteristics. For the same initial conditions, the burning rate of PP was slower than PMMA, whereas the burning rate of PS was comparable to PMMA. The transient diameter of the burning thermoplastic exhibited two distinct periods: an initial period (enduring approximately half of the total burn duration) when the diameter remained approximately constant, and a final period when the square of the diameter linearly decreased with time. A simple homogeneous two-phase model was developed to understand the changing diameter of the burning sphere. Its value is based on a competition between diameter reduction due to mass loss from burning and sputtering, and diameter expansion due to the processes of swelling (density decrease with heating) and bubble growth. The model relies on empirical parameters for input, such as the burning rate and the duration of the initial and final burning periods...|$|R
