40|$|The term rural {{is used to}} {{describe}} people, places, traditions, and spaces. It is often employed as a setting for study {{as well as an}} object of study. People’s perceptions of rural are confused and differ considerably. For over a century researchers have attempted to define more precisely this term using social, economic, and or ecological components. However, problems of interpreting official definitions and measurements exist. These definitions require extensions in order to capture a more objective meaning of the word. This thesis presents the foundations of a new approach to measuring and defining rurality. A spatial based approach is taken in which explicitly spatial data instead of social or economic data are collected and indexed. The index is divided into two clusters, a connectivity cluster and an access-to-service cluster. The indicators in the clusters are chosen based on a list of criteria taken from the Institute for International Development. The model employs mathematical foundations of both topology and metrics. The use of fuzzy measures to determine a <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>rurality,</b> instead of classical set theory, enhances the model. A degree of connectivity, a degree of accessibility, and an overall <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>rurality</b> is determined. The model also incorporates scale. The granularity of an indicato...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Private {{practitioners}} play a {{vital role}} in meeting the health needs of rural communities. However, the prospect of operating a private practice business in rural Australia seems to be increasingly unattractive, because many communities are forced to recruit salaried or overseas-trained doctors. This study focuses on rural practices as businesses whose viability influences their attractiveness for the recruitment and retention of practitioners. The specific objectives are to ascertain which factors contribute to or threaten practice viability in rural areas, and whether they vary according to the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>rurality</b> or geographical remoteness...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} spatial {{employment}} patterns of Australia’s university graduates in nonurban locations. Using a 2006 data set recording the employment status of 65, 661 university graduates 6 months after their graduation we examine how the personal and human capital characteristics of the individual university graduate affect the type of rural location into {{which he or she}} enters for employment purposes. The importance of identifying which types of graduates work where is essential for our understanding of the forces that are currently shaping the spatial distribution of human capital across Australia’s regions. In order to do this we allocate postcode-based data of graduate employment to one of five remoteness classes, as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, that allow us to distinguish between different <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>rurality.</b> The postcode data are used to associate {{the ways in which the}} human capital characteristics of the graduate in terms of the types <b>of</b> university <b>degrees</b> awarded and the universities attended, as well as the personal characteristics of the graduate, are related to the <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>rurality</b> in his or her employment outcomes. © 2010 Copyright the Authors.

40|$|Purpose—The present {{research}} examined {{the extent to}} which rural residence and social support seeking are associated with quality of life (QOL) among breast cancer patients following chemotherapy. Methods—Female breast cancer patients (n = 46) from communities <b>of</b> varying <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>rurality</b> in a mid-sized Midwestern state completed psychological and QOL measures at 1 month post-chemotherapy. Analyses assessed the relationships between QOL outcomes, rurality, and social support seeking. Findings—Using age and education as covariates, regression analyses were conducted to determine {{the extent to which}} QOL was related to social support seeking and rural/urban residence. Analyses revealed that social support seeking was associated with lower scores on multiple indices of QOL, and it was associated with higher self-reported symptoms of depression. Several significant associations with rural/urban residence were noted as well. Specifically, increasing rurality, as defined by USDA Rural-Urban continuum codes, was associated with lower overall QOL, lower functional well-being, and increased complaints of breast cancer-specifi...|$|R

In Great Britain, there has been considerable controversy amongst farmers, the public, scientists and politicians {{over the role of}} badger culling in the management of bovine tuberculosis. This paper examines public attitudes to badger culling in rural Wales, the reasons why culling is rejected and/or accepted and the level of trust the public place in different organisations responsible for badger culling. Variations in public attitudes between areas <b>of</b> differing <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>rurality</b> and disease incidence are analysed. Results indicate moderate levels of support for badger culling, but respondents do not believe the current scientific evidence on the effectiveness of a cull is acceptable. Respondents in rural fringe areas and low disease incidence are more likely to favour badger vaccination. The results have implications for future policy and methods of communicating wildlife control policies to the public...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSeveral {{studies have}} {{suggested}} rural health disadvantages. In France, studies on rural-urban patterns of lung cancer survival have yielded conflicting results. The aim of this analysis {{was to determine whether}} rural residence was associated with poor survival in three French counties. The database consisted of all primary lung cancer cases diagnosed in 2000 and 2001 collected through the Doubs cancer registry. A <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>rurality,</b> obtained from socio-demographic and farming parameters of the 1999 French census treated with factor analysis, was attributed to each patient according to his/her place of residence. Among the 802 patients, 21 % resided in rural areas, 11 % were semi-urban inhabitants and 68 % were urban residents. Survival differed significantly between these three rurality categories (p= 0. 04), with 2 -year survival rates of 18, 29 and 24 %, respectively. Using a Cox model, rural areas were significantly correlated with poor survival as compared with semi-urban areas (OR= 1. 42; 95 % confidence interval= 1. 06 - 1. 90; p= 0. 02). There was no survival difference between semi-urban and urban patients (OR= 1. 18; 95 % confidence interval= 0. 91 - 1. 53; p= 0. 21). Patient and tumour characteristics, especially stage and staging procedures, as well as first line treatment, did not vary with the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>rurality.</b> In conclusion, rurality has to be considered as a strong prognostic factor. Several intricate factors might be hypothesized such as increasing time to diagnosis leading to heavier tumour burden, worse treatment compliance and socioeconomic status. Before practical interventions can be proposed, prospective studies are warranted with further definition of rural risk factors for decreased survival in rural lung cancer patients...|$|E

40|$|Objective: Complementary and {{alternative}} medicine (CAM) use {{is high in}} rural health and an agenda for research in the geography of CAM has been outlined. Unfortunately, no studies to date have mapped the geographic distribution of CAM practitioners in rural areas. For {{the first time we}} investigate CAM practitioner distributions across a large district/region in rural Australia. Setting and design: A CAM infrastructure audit of practitioners was performed in rural Divisions of General Practice in New South Wales, Australia. Results: CAM providers form {{a significant part of the}} health care system in rural New South Wales with substantial representation across all <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>rurality</b> and in both under-serviced and well-serviced areas. CAM practitioners outnumbered GPs in four NSW Divisions of General Practice and in no Division numbered less than half of the total number of GPs. Conclusions: Given the challenges of access to and recruitment and retention of conventional health care providers in rural settings and the significant presence of CAM practitioners, it is possible to consider such practitioners as an untapped resource in rural health care delivery. Assuming appropriate regulatory and quality standards are in place this resource should attract careful attention as part of future rural health policy and planning. The significant presence and high prevalence of use of CAM practitioners should also serve as an impetus to reform CAM service delivery in Australia...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Cardiac arrest {{occurs when}} the heart {{suddenly}} ceases to pump blood around the body. To optimise survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), knowledge of the spatial distribution of OHCA {{and the availability of}} resuscitation, or âChain of Survivalâ, is required. Thus, this study aims to describe OHCA incidence and Chain of Survival availability in a manner that can help inform pre-hospital planning in the Republic of Ireland. In view of Irelandâs heterogeneous settlement pattern, we analyse the association between varying <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>rurality,</b> OHCA incidence and the availability of the Chain of Survival. In addition to population density, settlement size, proximity to urban centres and land use is taken into account which results in six classes: city; town; accessible village; remote village; accessible rural; remote rural. Results show that, when adjusted for age and sex, the incidence of adult OHCA decreases with increasing rurality. Furthermore, while distance to the nearest ambulance station and call-response interval is greater with increasing rurality, the lowest levels of bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation occur in the most urban class. To the best of our knowledge, {{this is one of the}} very first whole-country geographic descriptions of OHCA to be performed internationally. It is also the first OHCA study to use a multi-class urban-rural classification that considers rurality as more than a function of population densit...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the quality of care rating for {{long-term}} care facilities in rural versus urban Illinois locations. Using quality of care data available on medicare. gov, 774 Illinois long-term care facilities were compared to determine if a difference in quality of care existed based on rurality. Each facility was classified as either urban focused, large rural city/town (micropolitan) focused, small rural town focused, or isolated small rural town focused using the Rural Urban Commuting Area (RUCA) codes provided by the Rural Health Research Center. Frequencies, ANOVA, and Scheffe tests were used to analyze the data. Significant differences were found between urban focused and small rural town focused long-term care facilities and also between urban focused and isolated small rural town focused in regards to inspection ratings. Significant differences were also found for general quality ratings between urban focused and large rural city/town (micropolitan) focused, small rural town focused, and isolated small rural town focused long-term care facilities. Urban focused locations had a mean inspection average of 2. 72 stars out of a possible five compared to small rural town focused facilities that had a mean rating of 3. 21 stars, and isolated small rural town focused facilities that had a 3. 33 star average. Results also showed that general quality ratings were high, an average of 3. 81 stars, for urban focused facilities, compared to an average of 2. 84 stars for micropolitan facilities, 2. 82 stars for small rural town focused, and 3. 03 for isolated small rural town focused. Findings from this study offer some initial evidence that while overall quality in Illinois long-term care facilities are not significantly different on the basis <b>of</b> <b>rurality,</b> there are significant differences in inspection ratings and general quality ratings that could be attributed to <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>rurality...</b>|$|R

40|$|The main {{determinant}} {{of all forms}} of local taxation in France between 1993 and 2006 was the cooperation between municipalities (communes) known as intercommunality. First, a municipalitys membership in a Public Intermunicipal Cooperation Body (Établissement Public de Coopération Intercommunale: EPCI) tends to increase the rates of the four local direct taxes relative to a municipality that does not belong to such a group. Second, the rates are structurally higher in EPCIs that have adopted a single business tax and a supplementary local tax on households (fiscalité mixte). Third local taxation rates tend to rise structurally with municipality size, then decline in the largest cities. We obtained these results with a structural-residual analysis of taxation levels for the four local direct taxes in municipalities according to their membership in various categories of intermunicipal groupings, their population size, their <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>rurality,</b> and their type of living area (bassin de vie).

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} the Index of Relative Rurality, a continuous measure of rurality. The index {{is based on}} four dimensions: population size, density, percentage of urban residents, and distance to the closest metropolitan area. The index varies from 0 (most urban) to 1 (most rural). Compared to existing means of measuring rurality, the index is continuous and thus does not suffer from problems that arise when using arbitrary thresholds to separate discrete categories. This shift away from often ill-defined categories of rural and urban, to measuring the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>rurality</b> will shed new light on {{a wide array of}} rural issues ranging from rural poverty to economic growth. This paper shows that the Index of Relative Rurality makes an invaluable contribution to the debate on what is rural and what is urban. Three properties of the index are particularly beneficial for both research and policy: rurality is treated as a relative attribute, making it possible to investigate trajectories of rurality over time; sensitivity to small changes in one of the defining dimensions; applicability to different spatial scales.

The previous report focused on statewide threshold levels for retail and service businesses between the years 2000 and 2005, primarily to focus on trends {{in the number of}} people required for certain businesses to be sustainable. This report provides a more in depth analysis of threshold levels at the county level recognizing that Iowa’s retail landscape is diverse and the differences between counties vast. Using County Business Pattern data and Non-Employer Statistics from the U. S. Census Bureau for 2005, this report groups similar counties into peer groups to take into account differences in income levels, commuting patterns, and <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>rurality.</b> The results demonstrate that threshold levels for very few businesses and services are consistent across the state’s counties. Specialized retail stores see increasing thresholds the further from the metro area we move while common services like waste collection and death care services see declining threshold levels. The results indicate that county specific analysis can highlight where we see agglomeration of services, economies of scale, and where the elasticity of price and convenience matter most to the consumer. The report includes county by county comparison with their respective peer group, tables reporting the employer and non-employer data, and suggestions on where opportunities for more research exist. ...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of a study that developed and applied social metabolism methods to assess the sustainability of a regional economy, particularly the dynamics related to changes in the production and use of energy. The first objective {{of the study was to}} assess the feasibility of using existing secondary data sources as a basis for sub-nation state and regional analysis (with the regions in this case differentiating the area based on rurality). The second was to structure the outputs of the analysis in ways that provided comprehensive yet succinct and interpretable assessments of the balance of flows of material, energy and money that underpin the economy, with the intention that ultimately these assessments would be used to inform policymaking. The paper provides an introduction to the key concepts used within social metabolism analysis particularly the use of emergy (a measure of the cumulative environmental support provided to a social-ecological system). This is a unifying metric into which the myriad flows within an economy can be translated and combined in meaningful ways. It does so by, preserving information on both the quantity and quality of flows and so avoiding the need for arbitrary weightings. The paper presents a range of options for the use of emergy-based metrics that could be used to inform policy making. Comparisons for the years 2001 and 2010 are made at country level for Scotland and for three <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>rurality.</b> The analysis highlights how decisions on the share of the offshore energy sector attributed to Scotland and on the share of services (particularly those imported from beyond U. K.) have profound effects on the sustainability trajectory of the economy and the conclusions that might be drawn for policy. The paper concludes that the methods have the potential to add value to existing administrative datasets, and provide new perspectives that may be of value to policy making, but acknowledges that challenges remain in translating this potential into tangible use within policymaking...|$|R

This is especially interesting {{against the background of}} German history and the persistent disparity between Eastern and Western Germany. In this paper, the 439 German administrative districts, called Landkreise, provided the macro-level characteristics for this study. Altogether, 5516 individuals in 437 districts were included from data collected between 2005 and 2007. Our results show a significant association between the district unemployment rate and subjective health. The impact remains significant after adjusting for individual variables, including individual employment status. Furthermore, a significant association was found between subjective health and the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>rurality,</b> the proportion of elderly inhabitants and the proportion of foreigners. However, the variance of these was zero. In conclusion, our findings indicate an independent association between the unemployment rate of districts and individual self-rated health.

The farm population is declining relatively and absolutely in developed countries. Rural employment solutions will not come from agricultural development. Obtaining information for rural development via farm surveys will provide an increasingly narrow picture of rural society. Farm survey information will be most useful for rural analysis when it is presented in its rural context. Some on-farm and within-farm-household diversification will increase rural employment. This should be measured early to allow policy analysts to understand the type of unit that "adopts" such diversification strategies. Proposals to encourage these strategies will benefit from this key information. There is no special category of "rural statistics".

The gap in the supply of general internal medicine (GIM), general paediatrics (GP), general Ob/Gyn (GOG), emergency (EM) physicians between urban and rural areas increasingly narrowed over the last decade. However, the supply of general/family practice (GFP) physicians known as 'rural doctors' continued to decrease in rural areas over the last decade. As a result, the imbalance in the supply of all PCPs combined between urban and rural areas widened over the last decade.

The analysis shows that educational deprivation in Indiana is widespread and has been persistent over the last three decades. Spatially, the highly educated population increasingly concentrates {{in the center of the}} state. By the year 2000 a knowledge agglomeration has emerged that contributes to an increasing spatial disparity of intellectual capital across Indiana’s counties. The analysis further suggests that growth of the knowledge population is favorably influenced by closeness to the knowledge agglomeration, but negatively influenced by rurality and educational deprivation. Moreover, it suggests that counties experience higher growth of their highly educated population if they neighbor counties with a high growth of their knowledge population. These results potentially have far reaching policy implications for regional development in the State of Indiana...|$|E
40|$|China's {{rural areas}} are {{undergoing}} considerable spatio-temporal change. To some extent, this change increases {{the difficulty in}} our understanding the regional rural development and thus brings about challenges for the making of feasible regional rural development policies and strategic planning. This study establishes an index system to evaluate the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>rurality</b> in China at county level using national census data of 2000 and 2010, and examines the correlationship between rurality index and major socio-economic and geographical indicators. The results of evaluation and spatial analysis show that the rurality index can largely reflect the spatio-temporal patterns of China's rural development, and the Pearson correlation analysis confirmed that counties with high rurality have been marginalized in the aspects of both geographical location and economic development. As such, the patterns of rural development identified by rurality index analysis significantly improve our knowledge on the recent development of rural China. However, this index is less successful in revealing the agricultural production status quo alone. The authors argue that rurality index is an important tool for measuring rural development, and could provide us with valuable information for local planning and the innovation of rural development policies. Furthermore, integrating rurality studies and rural socio-economic analysis can contribute greatly to the making of integrated and regionalized rural development policies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This refl ects the regional differentiation based on the character of regional employment development potential. The specifi cs of rural regions are highlighted. Employment dynamics are assessed {{in the light of the}} process of employment restructuring both in its territorial and sectoral characteristics. The results illustrate employment in the service sector to be a viable driver of employment development regardless the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>rurality</b> but in absolute effects conditioned by its value. Furthermore, employment development is conditioned by the sectoral structure of regional employment. Components of employment development are identifi ed by application of shift-share analysis. The strength of the competitive effect describing the existence of locational advantages for specifi c sectors is further relativised to calculate its relevance for employment change. In conclusion, the existence of locational advantages has only a minor impact in terms of its relative size on employment change that would normally be expected.

In recent years, it has experienced a remarkable resurgence. This paper tries to investigate this phenomenon. Therefore, major trajectories of rural change in East Germany since 1989 are briefly described, and rural discourses in selected policy arenas are explored. It is argued that the notion <b>of</b> <b>rurality</b> is differentiated across different discourse arenas. While the notions <b>of</b> <b>rurality</b> are not independent from each other, they do not form a coherent worldview. This fragmentation of rural discourses reflects the increasingly hybrid reconstitution of the global countryside.

Logit models were developed and logistic regression analyses were carried out for each community. The empirical {{results suggest that the}} perception by residents of the potential economic benefits and negative impacts from land application of biosolids can be very influential in achieving public acceptance. From a policymaker 2 ̆ 7 s viewpoint, this suggests the need for sound educational programs that explicitly describe the economic benefits, negative impacts, and potential risks that typically occur with land application of biosolids. Supportive studies are needed to complement the educational programs. These measures will allow residents to weigh the relative benefits and costs to determine their positions on this approach to management of biosolids and to discount emotional judgements and misinformation. The media needs to ensure that newspaper, magazine, and television reports are accurate and taken from reliable sources. Survey results suggest that the less volume of information presented by the media, the more supportive residents are of land application. Therefore, with such sensitivity by respondents to quantity of information, it is imperative that media outlets place high priority on the quality and accuracy of materials presented.

We measured the association of rural residence with patient characteristics, survival, and time to transplant among 552 [*] 279 patients who initiated dialysis between January 1, 1995 and December 31, 2002 and survived more than 90 days. We also examined the characteristics of 4363 Medicare-certified dialysis facilities by <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>rurality.</b> Compared with urban patients, rural dialysis patients were older, less racially diverse with a higher prevalence of most co-morbid conditions. Hemodialysis was the dominant modality in both urban and rural areas, although the use of peritoneal dialysis was more frequent in rural areas. Survival and time to transplant differed by racial–ethnic group. Most notably, despite slightly better survival associated with rural vs urban residence among black popultions, black populations living in rural areas were less likely to be transplanted than their urban counterparts (and than any other group examined). Compared with urban facilities, rural facilities are smaller, less likely to be for profit or owned by a large chain. Nonetheless, rural facilities perform at least as well as urban facilities based on standard performance measures. Despite more frequent use of peritoneal dialysis among rural patients, rural facilities were markedly less likely to offer peritoneal dialysis or home hemodialysis training than urban facilities. Rural black patients (most of whom live in the south) should be targeted in policies to reduce racial disparities in access to transplant. Further studies are needed to determine whether rural dialysis patients have adequate access to home-based therapies...|$|E
40|$|This {{workshop}} provides practical {{information on}} how to advocate for quality spiritual, emotional and medical care for the terminally ill in rural communities. It explains in step-by-step format how to implement informational programs, using student social work projects that assist families, clergy and physicians in finding resources. In rural communities, spiritual, emotional and medical support for the terminally ill is a major concern. While in urban areas hospice has provided quality end-of-life care for several million Americans, rural communities remain greatly underserved. In their study, Virnig, Moscovice, Durham & Casey, found that the rates of hospice care before death were negatively correlated with the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>rurality.</b> Also they found that Medicare beneficiaries who lived in rural areas are less likely to receive hospice than those in urban areas. (2004). Awareness of the potential effect of hospice services on both the welfare of patients and their families is limited. National surveys and studies have shown that alternative approaches are infrequently discussed among doctors, patients and families (Merson, Bradley, 2002). Even after rural patients are in a hospice program, when compared to urban patients, differences in the types of medications given, in psychosocial support, and spiritual care were found. This workshop will provide practical information on the ways social work students can establish community partnering with local health services, and assist in improving end-of-life care for rural populations. Methods for educating different groups such as clergy and physicians on family needs and resources will be discussed. Procedures on how social work students can implement community education will be covered...|$|E
40|$|The lack of {{consensus}} among researchers in defi ning the focal construct <b>of</b> <b>rurality</b> has led to contradictory conclusions {{of whether or not}} a rural-urban performance gap exists in higher education. Compounding this problem are the changing defi nitions of rural and urban, even among governmental agencies. Thus, this study used two different defi nitional models <b>of</b> <b>rurality</b> to illustrate how different defi nitions can result in contradictory interpretations of any observed performance and attainment gap between students from different backgrounds...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Rural populations face {{numerous}} {{barriers to}} health, including poorer health care infrastructure, access to care, and other sociodemographic factors largely associated with <b>rurality.</b> Multiple measures <b>of</b> <b>rurality</b> {{used in the}} biomedical and public health literature can help assess rural–urban health disparities and may impact the observed associations between rurality and health. Furthermore, understanding what makes a place truly “rural” versus “urban” may vary from region to region in the US. Purpose The objectives {{of this study are}} to compare and contrast five common measures <b>of</b> <b>rurality</b> and determine how well-correlated these measures are at the national, regional, and divisional level, as well as to assess patterns in the correlations between the prevalence of obesity in the population aged 60 + and each of the five measures <b>of</b> <b>rurality</b> at the regional and divisional level. Methods Five measures <b>of</b> <b>rurality</b> were abstracted from the US Census and US Department of Agriculture (USDA) to characterize US counties. Obesity data in the population aged 60 + were abstracted from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). Spearman’s rank correlations were used to quantify the associations among the five rurality measurements at the national, regional, and divisional level, as defined by the US Census Bureau. Geographic information systems were used to visually illustrate temporal, spatial, and regional variability. Results Overall, Spearman’s rank correlations among the five measures ranged from 0. 521 (percent urban–urban influence code) to 0. 917 (rural–urban continuum code–urban influence code). Notable discrepancies existed in these associations by Census region and by division. The associations between measures <b>of</b> <b>rurality</b> and obesity in the 60 + population varied by rurality measure used and by region. Conclusion This study is among the first to systematically assess the spatial, temporal, and regional differences and similarities among five commonly used measures <b>of</b> <b>rurality</b> in the US. There are important, quantifiable distinctions in defining {{what it means to be}} a rural county depending on both the geographic region and the measurement used. These findings highlight the importance of developing and selecting an appropriate rurality metric in health research...|$|R
40|$|Rural {{intentional}} communities {{withdraw from}} mainstream urban space, rejecting its materialism and consumption. In {{creating their own}} places in the countryside, they produce new spaces <b>of</b> <b>rurality.</b> Constructions <b>of</b> <b>rurality</b> by intentional communities can be perceived as 'out of place' by local populations. This article draws on a wider study on the life-course of intentional communities, i. e. processes of growth, persistence, transformation, decline, and disintegration. We focus on ruralities as social constructions, by discussing {{the example of the}} community of the Hobbitstee in its relation with its rural Surroundings in the Netherlands. This is done through an analysis of the life course of the Hobbitstee since its establishment in 1969 onwards. The results show that relations between locals and community members are characterised by diversity and multiplicity. In general, their constructions <b>of</b> <b>rurality</b> gradually and partly developed from conflicting to converging. (c) 2007 Published by Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
