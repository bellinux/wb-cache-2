25|$|Fatty Tissue. In Biology, {{adipose tissue}} (/ˈædəˌpoʊs/) or body fat or fat depot or just fat is loose {{connective}} tissue composed of adipocytes. It is technically composed of roughly only 80% fat; fat in its solitary state {{exists in the}} liver and muscles. Adipose tissue is derived from lipoblasts. Its main role is to store {{energy in the form}} of lipids, although it also cushions and insulates the body. Far from hormonally inert, adipose tissue has in recent years been recognized as a major <b>endocrine</b> <b>organ,</b> as it produces hormones such as leptin, resistin, and the cytokine TNFα. Moreover, adipose tissue can affect other organ systems of the body and may lead to disease. Obesity or being overweight in humans and most animals does not depend on body weight but on the amount of body fat—to be specific, adipose tissue. Two types of adipose tissue exist: white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT). The formation of adipose tissue appears to be controlled in part by the adipose gene. Adipose tissue was first identified by the Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner in 1551.|$|E
2500|$|The {{relationship}} between some gut flora and humans {{is not merely}} commensal (a non-harmful coexistence), but rather a mutualistic relationship. Some human gut microorganisms benefit the host by fermenting dietary fiber into short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as acetic acid and butyric acid, which are then absorbed by the host. [...] Intestinal bacteria {{also play a role}} in synthesizing vitamin B and vitamin K as well as metabolizing bile acids, sterols, and xenobiotics. [...] The systemic importance of the SCFAs and other compounds they produce are like hormones and the gut flora itself appears to function like an <b>endocrine</b> <b>organ,</b> and dysregulation of the gut flora has been correlated with a host of inflammatory and autoimmune conditions.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1890s, the German {{pharmacologist}} Carl Jacobj (1857–1944) {{in the laboratory}} of Oswald Schmiedeberg [...] in Strasbourg studied {{the relationship between the}} adrenals and the intestine. Electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve or injection of muscarine elicited peristalsis. This peristalis was promptly abolished by electrical stimulation of the adrenals. The experiment has been called [...] "the first indirect demonstration {{of the role of the}} adrenal medulla as an <b>endocrine</b> <b>organ</b> [...] actually a more sophisticated demonstration of the adrenal medullary function than the classic study of Oliver and Schäfer". [...] While this may be true, Jacobj did not envisage a chemical signal secreted into the blood to influence distant organs, in other words a hormone, but nerves running from the adrenals to the gut, [...] "Hemmungsbahnen für die Darmbewegung".|$|E
2500|$|In biology, {{adipose tissue}} , body fat, or simply fat is a loose {{connective}} tissue composed mostly of adipocytes. In addition to adipocytes, adipose tissue contains the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of cells including preadipocytes, fibroblasts, vascular endothelial cells {{and a variety}} of immune cells such as adipose tissue macrophages. Adipose tissue is derived from preadipocytes. Its main role is to store energy in the form of lipids, although it also cushions and insulates the body. Far from being hormonally inert, adipose tissue has, in recent years, been recognized as a major <b>endocrine</b> <b>organ,</b> as it produces hormones such as leptin, estrogen, resistin, and the cytokine TNFα. The two types of adipose tissue are white adipose tissue (WAT), which stores energy, and brown adipose tissue (BAT), which generates body heat.

Adipose tissue– more specifically brown adipose tissue– was first identified by the Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner in 1551.|$|E

50|$|Developing {{research}} has demonstrated that many of the benefits of exercise are mediated through the role of skeletal muscle as an <b>endocrine</b> <b>organ.</b> That is, contracting muscles release multiple substances known as myokines, including but not limited to those cited in the above description, which promote the growth of new tissue, tissue repair, and various anti-inflammatory functions, which in turn reduce the risk of developing various inflammatory diseases.

5000|$|Multiple {{endocrine}} neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) (also {{known as}} [...] "Pheochromocytoma and amyloid producing medullary thyroid carcinoma", [...] "PTC syndrome," [...] and [...] "Sipple syndrome") {{is a group}} of medical disorders associated with tumors of the endocrine system.

50|$|A second {{important}} aspect of the practice of endocrinology is distinguishing human variation from disease.
