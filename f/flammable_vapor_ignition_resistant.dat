50|$|All liquids have a {{specific}} vapor pressure, which {{is a function of}} that liquid's temperature and is subject to Boyle's Law. As temperature increases, vapor pressure increases. As vapor pressure increases, the concentration of <b>vapor</b> of a <b>flammable</b> or combustible liquid in the air increases. Hence, temperature determines the concentration of <b>vapor</b> of the <b>flammable</b> liquid in the air. A certain concentration of a <b>flammable</b> or combustible <b>vapor</b> is necessary to sustain combustion in air, the lower flammable limit, and that concentration is different and is specific to each flammable or combustible liquid. The flash point is the lowest temperature at which there will be enough <b>flammable</b> <b>vapor</b> to induce <b>ignition</b> when an ignition source is applied.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} the {{environmental}} dispersion (i. e. atmospheric stability, wind speed, temperature, humidity and ground roughness) and source release factors (i. e. pipeline diameter, length, pressure and release opening area) on the suffocation distance, <b>flammable</b> <b>vapor</b> cloud distance, overpressure distance and thermal radiation distance after the natural gas released from pipeline were evaluated and analyzed. The results show that all the environmental dispersion factors except humidity {{have an effect on}} the <b>flammable</b> <b>vapor</b> cloud distance. The more stable atmospheric condition, lower wind speed and smaller ground roughness lead to the longer <b>flammable</b> <b>vapor</b> cloud distance. The atmosphere temperature has a very limited influence on the <b>flammable</b> <b>vapor</b> cloud distance. The higher ambient temperature and larger humidity result in the longer downwind thermal radiation distance, while the atmospheric stability, wind speed and ground roughness nearly does not. All the four source release factors significantly influence the <b>flammable</b> <b>vapor</b> cloud distance and thermal radiation distance, which is due to the different release amount, release rate and initial momentum...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe Buncefield Incident in 2005 {{led to a}} {{significant}} change in our understanding of how <b>flammable</b> <b>vapor</b> clouds could be generated from overfilling bulk storage tanks with volatile liquids. Prior to that incident, it was widely thought that an overfilling tank would produce a pool of liquid in the bunded area around a tank that would evaporate relatively slowly. However, in the Buncefield Incident, the release of liquid through vents in the tank roof led to waterfall-like cascade of fine gasoline droplets that produced <b>flammable</b> <b>vapor</b> at a much faster rate. It took only around 25  min for the dense current of <b>flammable</b> <b>vapor</b> to fill an area roughly 500  m by 400  m to a depth of between 2  m and 4  m. The wind speed was very low during the incident {{and the way in which}} the vapor cloud dispersed was affected by the slope of the ground and presence of obstacles. The resulting explosion was severe, even across open unobstructed areas. Fortunately there were no fatalities, but the total damage from the incident was estimated to have cost around $ 1. 5 billion. Since the Buncefield Incident took place, several incidents with striking similarities have taken place at Jaipur (India), San Juan (Puerto Rico) and the Amuay Refinery (Venezuela). This paper presents the findings of the Buncefield Incident investigation team and further research that has been carried out on tank overfilling releases over the last seven years at the Health and Safety Laboratory (HSL). The work has involved a combination of unique spill experiments and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling, and has resulted in a simple methodology for predicting the rate of <b>flammable</b> <b>vapor</b> production from overfilling tanks. This paper takes the opportunity to present for the first time a unified narrative, starting with the key findings of the incident investigation and culminating with the description of a workbook method for predicting which substances and storage tanks could create significant vapor clouds...|$|R

50|$|In the mid-1960s, the US Navy {{developed}} aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF). This synthetic foam has a {{low viscosity}} and spreads rapidly {{across the surface of}} most hydrocarbon fuels.

40|$|Analysis {{of mining}} {{equipment}} fires from 1990 through 1999 reveals {{that there were}} 340 large mining equipment fires, resulting in 72 injuries and five fatalities. Many of the fires resulted {{in the loss of}} equipment and all posed potential or real risks to the operator. In 97 cases, the fires raged out of control due to engine shut 2 failure, even upon activation of the machine fire suppression system, due to the spraying of pressurized hydraulic flu 2 and fuel onto hot engine surfaces. In other cases, even after engine shutoff, the fires re-ignited, fueled by the contin 2 flow of flammable fluids remaining in the lines onto the hot engine surfaces. In many of the fires, <b>flammable</b> <b>vapors</b> evolved and penetrated the cab, violently igniting, forcing the operator to exit under very hazardous conditions. The use of emergency evacuation lines in the fuel and hydraulic fluid systems, and methods to reduce or prevent the spraying of pressurized fluids onto hot engine surfaces would greatly improve the chances of successfully suppressing large mining equipment fires. In addition, the use of systems for preventing the <b>ignition</b> of <b>flammable</b> <b>vapors</b> inside the cab, and detecting and suppressing fires originat 2 in the cab, would greatly enhance operator safety. The National Institute for Occupation Safety and Health (NIOSH) recently conducted experiments on meth 2 to reduce the fire hazards associated with large mining equipment. These experiments evaluated the use of cab inerting systems to prevent the <b>ignition</b> of <b>flammable</b> <b>vapors</b> inside the cab and sup 2 fires originating in the cab, while maintaining a breathable atmosphere for the operator to bring the equipment to a stop and safely exit the cab...|$|R
50|$|At present, <b>flammable</b> <b>vapors</b> in {{fuel tanks}} are {{rendered}} inert by replacing {{the air in}} the tank with an inert gas, such as nitrogen, nitrogen enriched air, steam or carbon dioxide. This reduces the oxygen concentration of the ullage to below the combustion threshold. Alternate methods based on reducing the ullage fuel-air ratio to below the LFL or increasing the fuel-air ratio to above the UFL have also been proposed.|$|R
50|$|A {{household}} {{light switch}} may emit a small, harmless visible spark when switching. In an ordinary atmosphere this arc {{is of no}} concern, but if a <b>flammable</b> <b>vapor</b> is present, the arc might start an explosion.

50|$|Electrostatic {{discharges}} (other than lightning {{which comes}} from triboelectric charging or ice and water droplets within clouds) cause minimal harm because the energy (V2C) of the spark is very small, being typically several tens of micro joules in cold dry weather, and much less than that in humid conditions; however, such sparks can ignite <b>flammable</b> <b>vapors,</b> see risks and counter-measures.

50|$|Wood Gasifier: To {{keep the}} {{generator}} engine running {{they will need}} a constant fuel supply. One way is to scavenge for gasoline, but that method is dangerous and barely sustainable. John C. proposed building a gasifier after noticing an abundance of wood. A gasifier is two containers each holding wood scraps. The wood in the first container is used to build a fire. The fire heats the wood in the second container releasing a <b>flammable</b> <b>vapor</b> called wood gas. The wood gas is then piped directly into the generator engine.|$|R

50|$|Emulsifying {{agents are}} {{effective}} at extinguishing fires on small, thin-layer spills of flammable liquids (Class B fires). Such agents encapsulate the fuel in a fuel-water emulsion, thereby trapping the <b>flammable</b> <b>vapors</b> {{in the water}} phase. This emulsion is achieved by applying an aqueous surfactant solution to the fuel through a high-pressure nozzle. Emulsifiers are not effective at extinguishing large fires involving bulk/deep liquid fuels, because the amount of emulsifier agent needed for extinguishment {{is a function of}} the volume of the fuel, whereas other agents such as aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) need cover only the surface of the fuel to achieve vapor mitigation.|$|R
