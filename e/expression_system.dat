25|$|An <b>expression</b> <b>system</b> is {{a system}} {{specifically}} designed {{for the production of}} a gene product of choice. This is normally a protein although may also be RNA, such as tRNA or a ribozyme. An <b>expression</b> <b>system</b> consists of a gene, normally encoded by DNA, and the molecular machinery required to transcribe the DNA into mRNA and translate the mRNA into protein using the reagents provided. In the broadest sense this includes every living cell but the term is more normally used to refer to expression as a laboratory tool. An <b>expression</b> <b>system</b> is therefore often artificial in some manner. Expression systems are, however, a fundamentally natural process.

Plectasin, found in Pseudoplectania nigrella, {{is the first}} defensin to be isolated from a fungus. Plectasin has a chemical structure resembling defensins found in spiders, scorpions, dragonflies and mussels. In general, defensins have commonalities in their molecular structure, such as cysteines in the peptide stabilized with disulfide bonds. In particular, defensins from P.nigrella, invertebrates, and plants and share a conformation that has been named the CSαβ motif. [...] In laboratory tests, plectasin was especially active in inhibiting {{the growth of the}} common human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae, including strains resistant to conventional antibiotics. Plectasin has a low toxicity in mice, and cured them of peritonitis and pneumonia caused by S.pneumoniae as efficiently as vancomycin and penicillin, suggesting that it may have therapeutic potential.

2500|$|Sometimes {{modulation}} of transgene expression may {{be necessary}} since strong constitutive expression of a therapeutic gene in retinal tissues could be deleterious for long-term retinal function. [...] Different methods have been utilized for the expression modulation. One way is using exogenously regulatable promoter system in AAV vectors. For example, the tetracycline-inducible <b>expression</b> <b>system</b> [...] uses a silencer/transactivator AAV2 vector and a separate inducible doxycline-responsive coinjection. When induction occurs by oral doxycycline, this system shows tight regulation of gene expression in both photoreceptor and RPE cells.|$|E
2500|$|Choice of a {{starting}} material {{is key to}} the design of a purification process. [...] In a plant or animal, a particular protein usually isn't distributed homogeneously throughout the body; different organs or tissues have higher or lower concentrations of the protein. [...] Use of only the tissues or organs with the highest concentration decreases the volumes needed to produce a given amount of purified protein. [...] If the protein is present in low abundance, or if it has a high value, scientists may use recombinant DNA technology to develop cells that will produce large quantities of the desired protein (this is known as an <b>expression</b> <b>system).</b> Recombinant expression allows the protein to be tagged, e.g. by a His-tag or Strep-tag, to facilitate purification, which means that the purification can be done in fewer steps. In addition, recombinant expression usually starts with a higher fraction of the desired protein than is present in a natural source.|$|E
40|$|Introduction Gene {{expression}} {{is an important}} process whereby the genotype controls an individual cell’s phenotype. However, even genetically identical cells display a variety of phenotypes, which {{may be attributed to}} differences in their environment. Yet, even after controlling for these two factors, individual phenotypes still diverge due to noisy gene expression. Synthetic gene <b>expression</b> <b>systems</b> allow investigators to isolate, control, and measure the effects of noise on cell phenotypes. I used mathematical and computational methods to design, study, and predict the behavior of synthetic gene <b>expression</b> <b>systems</b> in S. cerevisiae, which were affected by noise. Methods I created probabilistic biochemical reaction models from known behaviors of the tetR and rtTA genes, gene products, and their gene architectures. I then simplified these models to account for essential behaviors of gene <b>expression</b> <b>systems.</b> Finally, I used these models to predict behaviors of modified gene <b>expression</b> <b>systems,</b> which were experimentally verified. Results Cell growth, which is often ignored when formulating chemical kinetics models, was essential for understanding gene expression behavior. Models incorporating growth effects were used to explain unexpected reductions in gene expression noise, design a set of gene <b>expression</b> <b>systems</b> with “linear” dose-responses, and quantify the speed with which cells explored their fitness landscapes due to noisy gene expression. Conclusions Models incorporating noisy gene expression and cell division were necessary to design, understand, and predict the behaviors of synthetic gene <b>expression</b> <b>systems.</b> The methods and models developed here will allow investigators to more efficiently design new gene <b>expression</b> <b>systems,</b> and infer gene expression properties of TetR based systems...|$|R
