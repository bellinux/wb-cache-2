The Flying Broomstick did not last long, however, and was improved upon, creating the Goblin Glider. The Goblin Glider was a more efficient flight system than Norman's Flying Broomstick. The Glider allowed the Goblin to carry a wide array of armaments, including heat-seeking and smart missiles, machine guns, extending blades, a flamethrower and a pumpkin bomb dispenser/launcher with him as he flew and had much greater speed and mobility than the Broomstick.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of the}} CHRISGAS {{project was}} the {{development}} of a gasification technique to produce clean hydrogen-rich synthesis gas from biomass. In order to improve the process efficiency, this work presents a gas cleaning concept, which combines chemical hot gas cleaning with hot (1 MPa, 900 degrees C) and warm (1 MPa, 300 degrees C) filtration. As the focus is set on the removal of H 2 S, HCI and KCl, calculations on chemical gas cleaning for the hot and warm <b>gas</b> <b>filter</b> were done using a thermodynamic process model using SimuSage (TM) (GTT-Technologies). The calculations show that Ca-based and Fe-based sorbents are not suitable H 2 S sorbents under the conditions of the hot <b>gas</b> <b>filter.</b> For Cu-based sorbents, H 2 S concentration below 100 cm(3) M- 3 is achievable, if the temperature is reduced below 810 degrees C. Additional calculations of KCl sorption on alumosilicates under the conditions of the hot <b>gas</b> <b>filter</b> show that the alkali concentration in gasifier-derived gases can be limited to 100 mm(3) m(- 3). Thus, the condensation temperature of KCl can be decreased down to 580 degrees C. The results of HCl sorption calculations show that Na- and K-based sorbents are only suitable for temperatures below 600 degrees C. Therefore, the HCl sorption is transferred to the warm <b>gas</b> <b>filter.</b> The KCl sorption results were confirmed by experiments using bauxite, bentonite, kaolinite and naturally occurring zeolite as sorbents.
