Wechsler changed {{a few of the}} boundaries for classification categories and a <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> names compared to the 1958 version of the test. The test's manual included information about how the actual percentage of persons in the norming sample scoring at various levels compared to theoretical expectations.|$|E
5|$|During the off-season, an up-start league was created, the Players' League(PL), {{which drew}} many players away from teams {{from both the}} AA and NL teams. The Browns lost a <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> best players as well, {{including}} Comiskey, their player-manager, and King, the team's top pitcher. Chamberlain re-signed with the team, but he was sold to the Columbus Solons after pitching in just five games. These movements left Stivetts and Toad Ramsey as the franchise's top two starters, with rookie Billy Hart cast as the occasional relief starter.|$|E
5|$|In 1972 and 1976 a {{large number}} of African {{countries}} threatened the IOC with a boycott to force them to ban South Africa and Rhodesia, because of their segregationist regimes. New Zealand {{was also one of the}} African boycott targets, because its national rugby union team had toured apartheid-ruled South Africa. The IOC conceded in the first two cases, but refused to ban New Zealand on the grounds that rugby was not an Olympic sport. Fulfilling their threat, twenty African countries were joined by Guyana and Iraq in a withdrawal from the Montreal Games, after a <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> athletes had already competed.|$|E
40|$|Bloggers devote {{significant}} {{time not}} only producing content {{for others to}} read, watch or listen to, but also paying attention to and engaging in interactions with other bloggers. We hope to throw light {{not only on the}} factors that gain bloggers significant readership and lively interactions with their audience, but also on the rules that govern their relations with others. We relate bloggers' activity with the size and structure <b>of</b> <b>their</b> network <b>of</b> fellow bloggers. A blogger's readership increases with his activity, while bloggers who read back proportionally <b>fewer</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> readers tend also to be more active. We find evidence that those bloggers who read back proportionally <b>fewer</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> readers have less readers than bloggers who reciprocate more, but tend to receive more comments per posts.

Over {{the next few months}} as word of the Dutch victory spread, more and more villages came to pay their respects at Fort Zeelandia and assure the VOC of their friendly intentions. However, the new masters of Mattau also inherited their enemies, with both Favorlang and Tirosen expressing hostility towards the VOC in the wake of their victory.|$|E
5|$|While many of {{the leaders}} were of socialist or anarchist leanings, <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> {{supporters}} were revolutionaries. Nevertheless, the peasants who assembled into the Fasci were eager for social justice and convinced that a new world {{was about to be}} born. A crucifix hung beside the red flag in {{many of the}}ir meeting-places, and portraits of the King beside those of the revolutionaries Garibaldi, Mazzini and Marx. Cheers for the King were often heard in their marches that almost resembled quasi-religious processions. Many of the Fasci were part of the Italian Workers' Party (Partito dei Lavoratori Italiani, the initial name of the Italian Socialist Party) that had been founded at a conference in Genoa on August 14, 1892.|$|E
5|$|While {{the outcome}} of the battle was still undecided, a second British frigate——arrived. Outnumbered, the French captain saw no {{alternative}} and surrendered his ship. The late arrival of Arethusa—under Captain Robert Mends, who claimed the victory for himself—sparked a furious argument that developed into a lasting animosity between Mends and Captain Michael Seymour of Amethyst. The failure of Niémen to reach Isle de France also had serious repercussions for the French squadron there. With naval supplies severely limited, their ability to operate at sea {{for long periods of time}} was hampered and by late 1810 <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> vessels were still seaworthy.|$|E

The 3rd Parachute Battalion had suffered {{the worst in the}} scattered parachute drop, and only a <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> men had arrived at the bridge. With no command structure, they were attached to the 1st Parachute Battalion to help defend the bridge. To the north, the Italian 372nd Coastal Battalion and the 10th Arditi Regiment had been informed of the parachute landings. Many of the 372nd Battalion had disappeared, while the Arditi mounted the first of a number of attacks on the British positions.

However, a <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> routes were not sufficiently heavily trafficked to warrant jetliners. An arrangement was reached whereby the three newest F-27s were transferred to Busy Bee, one each in 1975, 1976 and 1977. It also operated flights along the West Coast, connecting airports from Kristiansand Airport, Kjevik {{in the south to}} Trondheim Airport, Værnes in the north. From 1977 Busy Bee took over Braathens SAFE's two daily services from Stavanger Airport, Sola via Farsund Airport, Lista to Oslo.|$|E
25|$|The British 6th Battalion Royal Marines Light Infantry (RMLI) was {{scratched}} {{together from}} a company of the Royal Marine Artillery and companies {{from each of the}} three naval port depots.

Their original purpose had been only to deploy to Flensburg to supervise a vote to decide whether northern Schleswig-Holstein should remain German or be given to Denmark. Many of the Marines were less than 19 years old; it would have been unusual to send them overseas. Others were ex-prisoners of war who had only recently returned from Germany and had no home leave.|$|E

After running to retrieve their rifles and loading them as they returned to the line, the 46th and the rest of their brigade, supported by artillery, proceeded to handily repulse the Rebels, inflicting terrible casualties, but incurring very <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> own.|$|E
25|$|Both sides {{tried to}} break the {{stalemate}} using scientific and technological advances. On 22 April 1915, at the Second Battle of Ypres, the Germans (violating the Hague Convention) used chlorine gas {{for the first time}} on the Western Front. Several types of gas soon became widely used by both sides, and though it never proved a decisive, battle-winning weapon, poison gas became one of the most-feared and best-remembered horrors of the war. Tanks were developed by Britain and France, and were first used in combat by the British during the Battle of Flers–Courcelette (part of the Battle of the Somme) on 15 September 1916, with only partial success. However, their effectiveness would grow as the war progressed; the Allies built tanks in large numbers, whilst the Germans employed only a <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> own design, supplemented by captured Allied tanks.|$|E

Findings indicated that students’, parents’, and teachers’ current beliefs related to care were largely shaped by <b>their</b> past experiences <b>of</b> care in school. Parents who attended schools {{in other areas of}} the world tended to emphasize different attributes of care, than parents who attended schools in British Columbia.
