2500|$|A chined hull {{consists}} of straight, smooth, tall, long, or short plates, timbers or sheets of ply, which are set {{at an angle}} to each other when viewed in transverse section. The traditional chined hull is a simple hull shape because it works with only straight planks bent into a curve. These boards are often bent lengthwise. Plywood chined boats made of 8'x4' sheets have most bend along the long axis of the sheet. Only thin ply 3–6mm can easily be shaped into a compound bend. Most home-made constructed boats are chined hull boats. Mass-produced chine powerboats are usually made of sprayed chop strand fibreglass over a wooden mold. The Cajun [...] "pirogue" [...] {{is an example of a}} craft with hard chines. Benefits of this type of hull is the low production cost and the (usually) fairly flat bottom, making the boat faster at planing. Sail boats with chined hull make use of a <b>dagger</b> <b>board</b> or keel.|$|E

5000|$|Hobie Alter {{acknowledged}} other {{influences on}} the design of his 1965 Hobie Cat. was heavily influenced by the Molokai and Honolulu beach cats of the 25-40 ft range, used to take tourists on rides off the beach. These [...] "beach cats" [...] had been in use since at least the 1950s as a commercial venture, though GIs in World War II mention them in memoirs (inter alia, James Jones cite). The unique feature of these designs were asymmetrical hulls, a naval architecture term for hulls that are perpendicular (flat) {{on the outside of the}} hull, but curved on the inside. The design allows lateral resistance upwind, without the need for a skeg, daggerboard or centreboard. The Hobie Cat was the only design of the early three that did not use <b>dagger</b> <b>boards,</b> although now it offers designs with <b>dagger</b> <b>boards</b> and skegs. When running in and out of the surf, the lack of <b>dagger</b> <b>boards</b> or center boards makes [...] "beaching" [...] almost effortless.|$|R
5000|$|The company founder, Hobart Alter, {{began as}} a {{surfboard}} manufacturer in the late 1950s. According to another source, Alter's focus changed in 1961 to designing an easily beached fibreglass catamaran.The impetus of this shift is attributed to a 1961 boat show in Anaheim, CA which placed Alter in a booth selling surfboards, next to Art Javes, the designer of the new (1961) AQUA CAT 12 sailboat. That sailboat featured lightweight fibreglass hulls with an aluminium tube structure supporting a trampoline style deck for seating. The AQUA CAT catamaran did well in shallow water, but relied on <b>dagger</b> <b>boards</b> to reduce slippage sidewise under sail. <b>Dagger</b> <b>boards</b> were also used by the much heavier Pacific Cat from 1960. That design featured a solid fibreglass deck on a 19' x 8' boat, giving it a weight of almost 500 pounds. Following the 1961 boat show, Alter contacted Arthur [...] "Art" [...] Javes, designer of the AQUA CAT {{to tell him he}} was also entering the fledgling catamaran market. The first Hobie Cat is credited with being first built in 1965 and featured a structure similar to the AQUA CAT, but slightly heavier with assymmetrically-shaped hulls that did not rely on <b>dagger</b> <b>boards.</b> This design was more readily beached than the AQUA CAT or Pacific Cat.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Aqua cat 12 {{was modified}} to an improved Aqua cat 12.5 {{and is also}} available as an Aqua Cat 14 Catamaran which features upturned hulls and is available in an easier sailing resort model. The 14' model uses small keels to replace the <b>dagger</b> <b>boards</b> found on the smaller Aqua cats.|$|R
5000|$|Most aft-mast sailboats {{are either}} catamarans, or trimarans. An {{exception}} is the [...] "4.8 monomaran" [...] designed by Kees Radius's. A [...] ""monomaran"" [...] is a single hull with no ballast and a <b>dagger</b> <b>board.</b>|$|E

50|$|Kite {{dinghies}} can {{be found}} {{for as little as}} $100, but the mast, rudder and <b>dagger</b> <b>board</b> can raise that figure if repairs/replacements are required. A Kite dinghy in good condition with all the equipment could easily run to $6000.|$|E
5000|$|Prindle {{moved into}} the classes {{production}} in the early 1990s, {{with the development of}} the Prindle 19, a well designed, fast and balanced ship. The Prindle 19 class continues to grow but is at best a borderline [...] "beach cat", with more of an emphasis on hydrodynamically linear hull design and the use of <b>dagger</b> <b>boards.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In the United States, Art Javes {{designed}} and marketed an early fiberglass catamaran sailboat, the Aqua, in 1961. The Aqua was a 12-foot-long fiberglass hulled cat, which featured two flat-bottomed, foam filled, symmetric fiberglass hulls. These hulls were connected with aluminum tubing that supported a trampoline-style deck that was {{large enough for}} several people. It also featured an unusual [...] "lateen rigged" [...] sail that {{was supported by a}} rigid aluminum A-frame. The mast itself was topped with a styrofoam float that helped insure that a capsizing, (especially in shallow water that could damage the mast), would be easily righted and result only in the boat going part way over. If capsized it was designed to rest on one hull, with the ball {{at the top of the}} mast preventing it from going fully inverted. The flat bottomed hulls made it a beach-friendly catamaran, but its reliance on <b>dagger</b> <b>boards</b> meant it had a draft of 2 ft with the <b>dagger</b> <b>boards</b> in position.|$|R
5000|$|The {{resulting}} {{and nearly}} ubiquitous Hobie {{is now the}} most recognized beach cat of the last thirty years. It combines {{the structure of the}} earlier Aqua with the asymmetrical hull design of the Molokai, HI, and the beaching ability of the Pacific cat. Combining these features, along with optional skeg and daggerboard options, Hobie created a catamaran that could easily sail on and off the beach through the surf. The brilliance of the initial Hobie design was the combination of the asymmetrical hull design with the smaller, surf [...] "friendly" [...] layout. Without <b>dagger</b> <b>boards</b> but with a large sail area to weight ratio (the [...] "16" [...] weighed 325 lb at its inception and, with over 350 ft2 m2 of sail), the initial Hobie designs were able to sail into and out of heavy surf safely. The asymmetric hulls reduced lateral drift which made dagger board-dependent designs more difficult to handle in unfavorable winds or over extended shallow areas where <b>dagger</b> <b>boards</b> could not be deployed.|$|R
5000|$|Snarks (currently Super Snarks) have a monohull {{length of}} eleven feet; beam of thirty-eight inches; draft of [...]17 foot; and weight {{capacity}} of 310 lb. Features include a lateen-rigged nylon sail of 45 square feet; aluminum mast, spar, and boom; wood rudder and an integral center sleeve molded into the hull {{to support a}} removable wood <b>dagger</b> <b>board.</b> With an overall depth of 12 inches, the sailboat can be stored upright in a depth of 12 inches, and the boat is described as [...] "car-toppable." [...] The boats arrive as a knock down kit {{in a cardboard box}} and can be assembled in an hour.|$|E
5000|$|After the Hobie 14/16 and Prindle 16/18 [...] "era", beach cat {{manufacturers}} increasingly {{moved away}} from the asymmetrical designs which moved easily on and off the beach, and focused on theoretically faster symmetrical designs, including the aforesaid Prindle 19, the Hobie 18, the Nacra 5.2 and the Boston Whaler [...] "SuperCat 20". The influence of the Tornado as an Olympic class beginning in 1984 cannot be underestimated in the emphasis placed on symmetrical, <b>dagger</b> <b>board</b> based models. The Tornado, with its estimated thirty naut top speed, and Olympic panache, contributed to the continuance development of faster and faster [...] "beach cats", which, theoretically, could sail {{in and out of the}} surf, but in reality, were much more adept at one design racing. Hence, the development of the F (for Formula) 18 class certification.|$|E
50|$|Centre board - (also <b>dagger</b> <b>board)</b> an {{elongated}} underwater appendage that fits vertically {{in the slot}} of a centre case and extends below the hull. It can be retracted so the boat can float in very shallow water. The board has a length to breadth ratio of about 4;1. The board is tapered to a hydrodynamic (teardrop) shape in plan section to promote laminar flow of the water. This shape prevents stalling or eddying when sailing to windward. Together with the sails it lifts the hull in the windward direction. Common materials are wood often reinforced with fibreglass or carbon to obtain more stiffness and abrasion resistance. When sailing to windward the board is fully down but is retracted about half way when sailing directly down wind. When sailing to windward an efficient board prevents most leeway (sideways movement).|$|E

At the Lion Circus, Das performed rare feats like cutting iron rods using teeth, bending iron rods using neck, weightlifting, throwing javelins and <b>dagger</b> <b>boards.</b> In 1948, Das formed his own circus known as the Royal Pakistan Circus.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "original" [...] beachcat, the Pacific cat, {{appeared}} in 1960 in California. The Pacific cat {{was designed by}} Carter Pyle and was first built in 1960. It was slightly smaller than 19 ft × 8 ft, and was a solid fiberglass catamaran with a solid core deck and traditional catamaran sail plan. The design's chief limitation was its weight of over 500 lb with approximately 300 sq ft of sail area. The design was a traditional design with <b>dagger</b> <b>boards</b> and a hard deck. By comparison, the AQUA CAT 12 weighed 160 pounds and could easily be carried by two people, and the mast raised by one person.|$|R

50|$|Foil-name for the T- or L-shaped {{hydroplaning}} appendage that lifts a hull out of {{the water}} while sailing. The vertical component is similar to a conventional <b>dagger</b> <b>board</b> but much narrower due to the high sailing speed of foiling craft. 120 mm is typical in a foiling Moth of 3.3 m length. The vertical component is a symmetrical NASA foil shape. The main vertical foil is often angled forward to prevent air being sucked down the leading edge and creating a disturbed water flow. The winglets or blades are asymmetrical NASA foil shapes like a plane wing. In most foiling boats the whole wing can moved up or down - either automatically and/or partly controlled by a crew member to adjust the amount of lift needed. This depends mainly on wind and boat speeds. Winglets with a wider cross section give more lift at lower speeds but have more drag as speed increases whereas narrower ones have less lift but less drag at higher speed. Foils are usually made of lightweight carbon fibre because of its extreme strength and stiffness.|$|E

40|$|The use of canting keels in {{conjunction}} with various appendage configurations has been used successfully on racing yachts ranging from the 6. 5 m Mini Transat yacht through to the Open 60 and Volvo 70 round the world racing yachts {{and even some of}} the maxi class racing yachts. Experimental tests were completed on two models of Mini-Transat yachts, one at 1 / 3 rd scale and the second at 1 / 6 th scale. Both models were tested at the towing tank facility at Southampton Solent University. The first of two towing tank models was fitted with an additional dynamometer able to measure keel forces in isolation from total hydrodynamic forces, the latter being recorded with the standard tank dynamometer. Hence the contribution of lift and drag generated by the canting keel alone, as compared to the total lift and drag generated by the complete hull and keel configuration, are studied using model scale experiments. This particular keel also was fitted with a trim tab which was set at 0, 5 and 10 degrees, enabling the further investigations to be made. The second model was used to investigate the overall sailing performance of a Mini Transat yacht, which sails with the keel canted to 25 degrees, firstly with and then without a <b>dagger</b> <b>board.</b> Extrapolated full size hydrodynamic results from the tests {{in conjunction}} with appropriate stability data and sail dimensions are then used in the Wolfson Unit’s WinVPP program to establish the sailing performance of the Mini Transat yacht for both conditions. The results of this investigation show that there is a fine balance in choosing the best appendage configuration which is dependant upon a combination of design cant angle together with wind speed and hence heel angle...|$|E
40|$|The boat {{has to be}} {{design for}} in and {{offshore}} races in the Adriatic Sea; the length is been chosen based on the local regulations and for a compromise between light and strong wind characteristics. A canting keel system will be developed to increase the stability in strong winds conditions keeping the displacement not very high. For {{the use of the}} canting keel system a front <b>dagger</b> <b>board</b> is necessary to increase the side force of the boat; to maximize the boat performances is been decide to use two asymmetric dagger boards, fore the mast, one in each side. The study of their Lift and Drag coefficient is been taking into account to optimize their performances; various NACA profile has been take in consideration. The boat is design as fully racing boat so all the criteria are focalized for its functionality, maneuvers and simplicity of the deck lay out; a large open cockpit is required for an easy crew disposition during maneuvers. A height of 1. 85 m is required in the inside of the coach roof for an easier crew liability and to keep a good relationship between the length of the boat and its height. To make the boat faster in light-wind conditions, high SA/Δ and SA/WSA ratios have to be reach. The mast design will focus on the performances in light wind conditions with the forestay height on 9 / 10 of the mast length with the possibility to use a masthead asymmetrical spinnaker and a “code-zero”. Two runners and backstay for each sides and shrouds with few degrees angle of sweptback spreader will support the mast. The hull will be built in E-Glass composite material; for all the appendages carbon laminates will be use as more sensible in term of performances. The boat will be built as “one off” design with a male mould. ...|$|E
50|$|Junks {{employed}} stern-mounted rudders {{centuries before}} their adoption in the West {{for the simple}} reason that Western hull forms, with their pointed sterns, obviated a centreline steering system until technical developments in Scandinavia created the first, iron mounted, pintle and gudgeon 'barn door' western examples in the early 12th century CE. A second reason for this slow development was that the side rudders in use were, contrary to a lot of very ill-informed opinion, extremely efficient. Thus the junk rudder's origin, form and construction was completely different in that it was the development of a centrally mounted stern steering oar, examples of which can also be seen in Middle Kingdom (c.2050-1800 BCE) Egyptian river vessels. It was an innovation which permitted the steering of large ships and due to its design allowed height adjustment according to the depth of the water and to avoid serious damage should the junk ground. A sizable junk can have a rudder that needed up to twenty members of the crew to control in strong weather. In addition to using the sail plan to balance the junk and take the strain off the hard to operate and mechanically weakly attached rudder, some junks were also equipped with leeboards or <b>dagger</b> <b>boards.</b> The world's oldest known depiction of a stern-mounted rudder can be seen on a pottery model of a junk dating from before the 1st century AD, though some scholars think this may be a steering oar - a possible interpretation given that the model is of a river boat that was probably towed or poled.|$|R
