40|$|Measurements {{of thermal}} {{excitations}} of V-O and Y-Ba-Cu-O solid solutions {{have been performed}} by a method of inelastic neutron scattering for low-energy transfers range. Features at energy transfer about 3 meV and about 5 meV for V-O and Y-Ba-Cu-O accordingly were observed in neutron scattering spectra. The reason of appearance of the observed low-energy excitations are {{the formation of an}} effective potential of oxygen with broad weakly upwards bottom at the xy plane of tetragonal symmetry octahedron, which the interstitial atom occupies. The experimental observed features can be understood in the representation of hindered quantum gyration of the interstitial atom. It was assumed that O 1 and O 4 atoms in Y-Ba-Cu-O, as well as in V-O system, are in two-dimensional quantum-well, which has almost <b>flat</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>formed</b> by the surrounding atoms Cu and Ba. The possibility of formation of collective excitations of gyration-type as a result of exchange interaction of light atoms in matrix lattice is considered. The assumption is made that the existence of gyration-like excitations can play an important role for explanation of some phenomena in solid state physics, in particular in realization of high values of temperatures of superconducting transitions in high temperature superconductors.

60|$|I {{then put}} into the hive, instead of a thick, square piece of wax, a thin and narrow, knife-edged ridge, {{coloured}} with vermilion. The bees instantly began on both sides to excavate little basins near to each other, {{in the same way}} as before; but the ridge of wax was so thin, that the bottoms of the basins, if they had been excavated to the same depth as in the former experiment, would have broken into each other from the opposite sides. The bees, however, did not suffer this to happen, and they stopped their excavations in due time; so that the basins, as soon as they had been a little deepened, came to have flat bottoms; and these <b>flat</b> <b>bottoms,</b> <b>formed</b> by thin little plates of the vermilion wax having been left ungnawed, were situated, as far as the eye could judge, exactly along the planes of imaginary intersection between the basins on the opposite sides of the ridge of wax. In parts, only little bits, in other parts, large portions of a rhombic plate had been left between the opposed basins, but the work, from the unnatural state of things, had not been neatly performed. The bees must have worked at very nearly the same rate on the opposite sides of the ridge of vermilion wax, as they circularly gnawed away and deepened the basins on both sides, in order to have succeeded in thus leaving flat plates between the basins, by stopping work along the intermediate planes or planes of intersection.|$|R

40|$|A {{model is}} {{developed}} {{to investigate the}} process {{which leads to the}} formation of sand waves in shallow tidal seas characterised by a heterogeneous sea bed composition. The main goal of the analysis is the evaluation of the eﬀects that a graded sediment has on the formation of the <b>bottom</b> <b>forms</b> and the investigation of the sorting process induced by the growth of the <b>bottom</b> <b>forms.</b> The analysis is based on the study of the stability of the ﬂat bed conﬁguration, i. e. small amplitude perturbations are added to the <b>ﬂat</b> <b>bottom</b> and a linear analysis of their time development is made. For an oscillatory tidal current dominated by one tidal constituent, the results show that the graded sediment can stabilise or destabilise the <b>ﬂat</b> <b>bottom</b> conﬁguration with respect to the uniform sediment case, depending on the standard deviation σ ∗ of the grain size distribution and on the ratio r between the horizontal tidal excursion and the water depth. For moderate values of r, i. e. values just larger than the critical value for which the sediment is moved and sand waves appear, the presence of a sand mixture stabilises the ﬂat bed. On the other hand, for large values of r, the mixture has a destabilising eﬀect. In both cases the eﬀect that a sand mixture has on the stability of the ﬂat bed conﬁguration is relatively small. Moreover, for moderate values of r, the ﬁne fraction of the mixture tends to pile up at the crests of the <b>bottom</b> <b>forms</b> while the coarse fraction moves towards the troughs. For large values of r, the grain size distribution depends on the value of σ ∗. The results are physically interpreted and provide a possible explanation of the apparently conﬂicting ﬁeld observations of the grain size distribution along the sand wave proﬁle, carried out in the North Sea...|$|R

40|$|Studies of the LHC beam {{loss in the}} SPS {{started in}} 2003 [1], [2] and {{continued}} in 2004. The <b>flat</b> <b>bottom</b> losses strongly depend on the batch intensity and the RF voltage. For beam with the 75 ns spacing at the same bunch intensity they are smaller than for the 25 ns spaced bunches. Large voltage on the <b>flat</b> <b>bottom</b> together with some optimum voltage at injection helps to reduce losses. Analysis of data from 2003 has shown that observations are compatible with a diffusion like process on the <b>flat</b> <b>bottom.</b> Therefore significant time during 2004 was devoted to studies of possible RF noise sources. However the main improvement in beam lifetime on the <b>flat</b> <b>bottom</b> was observed after {{a change in the}} working point in the transverse plane (MD on 1. 09. 2004).

The discretization of the RANS equations is achieved by a finite volume (FV) approach. The volume of fluid (VOF) method is employed to track the complicated free surface. A numerical wave tank is built to generate the ocean waves which are suitable for deploying offshore structures. A typical deploying condition is employed to reflect the process of <b>flat</b> <b>bottom</b> body impacting waves, and the pressure distribution of bottom is also presented. Four different lowering velocities are applied to obtain the relationship between slamming force and wave parameters.

40|$|Abstract. Bi-directional Flying Wing (BFW) {{is a new}} {{supersonic}} civil transport shape {{concept that}} aims to meet the conflict requirements of high speed cruise and low speed take-off/landing missions. In this paper the Class-Shape-Transformation (CST) shape parameterization method is modified to represent the BFW shape, and new basis functions suitable for the BFW airfoil representation are constructed. The Far-field Composite Element (FCE) wave drag optimization is performed on both the <b>flat</b> <b>bottom</b> and symmetric BFW configurations, and the drag reduction effects and result precision are surveyed. It is suggested that significant wave drag reduction {{can be achieved by}} the FCE optimization for both the <b>flat</b> <b>bottom</b> and the symmetric BFW configurations. The wave drag coefficients with sufficient precision can be obtained in the FCE optimization of the symmetric configuration; while the FCE optimization results of the <b>flat</b> <b>bottom</b> one are not accurate enough...|$|R
