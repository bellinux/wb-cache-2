We show that the fly has <b>implemented</b> both sensory <b>modalities</b> into a single system, Johnston's organ, which houses specialized clusters of mechanosensory neurons, each of which monitors specific movements of the antenna. Gravity- and sound-sensitive neurons differ in their response characteristics, and only the latter express the candidate mechanotransducer channel NompC. The two neural subsets also differ in their central projections, feeding into neural pathways that are reminiscent of the vestibular and auditory pathways in our brain. By establishing the Drosophila counterparts of these sensory systems, our findings provide the basis for a systematic functional and molecular dissection of how different mechanosensory stimuli are detected and processed. ...|$|R

Face recognition is a common biometric <b>modality</b> <b>implemented</b> for access control operations such as customs and borders. The recent report from the Special Group on Issues Affecting Facial Recognition and Best Practices for their Mitigation highlighted scarring as one of the emerging challenges. The significance of this problem extends to the ISO/IEC and national agencies are researching to enhance their intelligence capabilities. Data was collected on face images with and without scars, using theatrical special effects to simulate scarring on the face and also from subjects that have developed scarring within their lifetime. A total of 60 subjects participated in this data collection, 30 without scarring of any kind and 30 with preexisting scars. Controlled data on scarring is problematic for face recognition research as scarring has various manifestations among individuals, yet is universal in that all individuals will manifest some degree of scarring. Effect analysis was done with controlled scarring to observe the factor alone, and wild scarring that is encountered during operations for realistic contextualization. Two environments were included in this study, a controlled studio that represented an ideal face capture setting and a mock border control booth simulating an operational use case. ...|$|R

However, such automated services are generally quite inaccessible to users who have had little technological exposure. There has been a widespread belief that speech-recognition technology {{can be used to}} bridge this gap, but little objective evidence for this belief has been produced. To address this situation, two interfaces, touchtone and speech-based, were designed and <b>implemented</b> as input <b>modalities</b> to a system that provides technologically unsophisticated users with access to an informational/transactional service. These interfaces were optimised and compared using transaction completion rates, time taken to complete tasks, error rates and user satisfaction. The speech-based interface was found to outperform the touchtone interface in terms of completion rate, error rate and user satisfaction. The data obtained on time taken to complete tasks could not be compared as the DTMF interface data were highly influenced by people who are not technologically unsophisticated. These results serve as a confirmation that speech-based interfaces are more effective and more satisfying and can therefore enhance information dissemination to people who are not well exposed to the technology.

40|$|Oxygen {{distribution}} {{is a major}} determinant of treatment success in radiotherapy, with well-oxygenated tumour regions responding by up to a factor of three relative to anoxic volumes. Conversely, tumour hypoxia is associated with treatment resistance and negative prognosis. Tumour oxygenation is highly heterogeneous and difficult to measure directly. The recent advent of functional hypoxia imaging modalities such as fluorine- 18 fluoromisonidazole positron emission tomography have shown promise in non-invasively determining regions of low oxygen tension. This raises the prospect of selectively increasing dose to hypoxic subvolumes, a concept known as dose painting. Yet while this is a promising approach, oxygen-mediated radioresistance is inherently a multiscale problem, and there are still a number of substantial challenges that must be overcome if hypoxia dose painting is to be successfully <b>implemented.</b> Current imaging <b>modalities</b> are limited by the physics of such systems to have resolutions in the millimetre regime, whereas oxygen distribution varies over a micron scale, and treatment delivery is typically modulated on a centimetre scale. In this review, we examine the mechanistic basis and implications of the radiobiological oxygen effect, the factors influencing microscopic heterogeneity in tumour oxygenation and the consequent challenges in the interpretation of clinical hypoxia imaging (in particular fluorine- 18 fluoromisonidazole positron emission tomography). We also discuss dose-painting approaches and outline challenges that must be addressed to improve this treatment paradigm...|$|R

Objectives: Aim {{of this study was}} to describe changes in serotype distribution and antibiotic susceptibility of S. pneumoniae from invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPD) in the last decade. Study Design: S. pneumoniae isolates from IPD, collected through a national surveillance system, were serotyped and antibiotic susceptibility was determined by E-test. Data were analyzed according to age groups (5 years, > 5 - 64 years, 65 years) and to 3 time periods: prior, during and after PCV 7 implementation (2001 - 2003, 2006 - 2008 and 2009 - 2011). Results: The percentage of PCV 7 serotypes (vaccine serotypes, VS) decreased over the years not only in children (from 60 % to 26 %) but also in the other age groups. Penicillin resistance was rather low in 2001 - 2003 (7 - 12 %), but peaked in children in 2006 - 2008 (24 %), and decreased in 2009 - 2011, while erythromycin resistance slightly decreased over the 3 periods. Conclusions: PCV 7 use has largely impacted the epidemiology of S. pneumoniae in Italy, with a decrease in VS in all age groups.
