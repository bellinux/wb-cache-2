This makes the heater self-limiting. The rubber foil is thin and flexible and can be formed to any shape and size.|$|E

An average statistic risk level has been proved to be approximately equal to the annual percentile of coincident dry- and wet-bulb temperatures for HVAC systems whose thermal time constant is less than 1 h.

In the investigated dairy cattle barns, on condition that minimum ventilation requirement to be achieved for - 3, 0 and 1. 7 °C outdoor design temperature and 70, 80 % Indoor Relative Humidity (IRH), estimated indoor temperature were ranged from 2. 2 to 12. 2 °C for 70 % IRH, 4. 3 to 15. 0 °C for 80 % IRH.

50|$|The bulb breaks as {{a result}} of the thermal {{expansion}} of the liquid inside the bulb. The time it takes before a bulb breaks is dependent on the <b>temperature.</b> Below the <b>design</b> <b>temperature,</b> it does not break, and above the <b>design</b> <b>temperature</b> it breaks, taking less time to break as temperature increases above the design threshold. The response time is expressed as a response time index (RTI), which typically has values between 35 and 250 m½s½, where a low value indicates a fast response. Under standard testing procedures (135 °C air at a velocity of 2.5 m/s), a 68 °C sprinkler bulb will break within 7 to 33 seconds, depending on the RTI. The RTI can also be specified in imperial units, where 1 ft½s½ is equivalent to 0.55m½s½. The sensitivity of a sprinkler can be negatively affected if the thermal element has been painted.|$|R
