However, the city crew that installed the new turf reportedly did not install it properly, resulting in seams being visible in several places.|$|E
25|$|The {{developers}} came to {{the conclusion}} that complex battles would only serve to confuse players. One play tester helped them by pointing out the quality of the fire pit puzzle, a puzzle that has the player-character riding on a moving platform that is descending into flames, requiring players to find a way to survive. He stated that it was both dramatic and exciting, but also a difficult puzzle. Wolpaw stated that this made no sense, commenting that it was one of the easiest puzzles in the game. He added that the battle was a dramatic high-point, since it was being the first time GLaDOS directly tries to kill the player-character and the first time that players have to use the environment to their advantage. After learning about what fellow Valve developers had planned for the final boss battle in Half-Life 2: Episode Two, the Portal developers decided to implement a neurotoxin that would kill the player-character in six minutes. This made it <b>easier</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> writers, who only had to write six minutes of dialogue. As a result, they scaled the game back, intending to ensure that everyone was able to see the game to the very end.|$|E

He noted the {{influence}} both of Alban Berg and, in the strings and percussion, of rock music and appreciated a musical language that makes modernism <b>easier</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ears. However, {{he felt a}} degree of ambivalence about a composer he described as [...] "theatrical... in both the good and bad senses of the word." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{land around}} Waterfall Gully {{provided}} the original inhabitants {{with a number}} of resources. The bark from the local stringybark trees (Eucalyptus obliqua) was used in the construction of winter huts, and stones and native timbers were used to form tools. Food was also present, and cossid moth larvae along with other species of plants and animals were collected. Nevertheless, {{there were only a few}} resources that could only be found on the slopes, and [...] "both hunting and food gathering would in general have been <b>easier</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rich plains".|$|E
500|$|Tony {{left the}} soap on 12 December 2008, after his true nature was exposed. It was {{announced}} on 7 September 2009 {{that he would}} return to EastEnders to be put on trial. Coghill was pleased to return, believing it right that Tony's story arc should conclude realistically, giving closure to the storyline and continuing to raise awareness of the issue. Santer commented: [...] "One of the unique things about EastEnders is its ability to play stories over months and years. Chris agreeing to come back for these episodes will enable us to continue showing the long-term consequences of Tony's abuse of Whitney and – I hope – continue to do justice to the issue of child sex abuse." [...] Grounds praised Tony's trial, stating that it demonstrated the importance for children of having their abusers brought to justice. Palmer felt that: [...] "If one person out there who's been abused saw that [...] {{go out of their way}} to make it <b>easier</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> victim – Whitney's evidence is given by video link – it will be worth it." ...|$|E
500|$|Chris Coghill {{was cast}} as Whitney's abuser Tony on 20 June 2008. Upon {{accepting}} the role, he commented: [...] "Shona doesn't act, or look, {{like a little}} child. Which helps." [...] He has added of their off-screen relationship: [...] "Shona's fantastic to work with. She's very natural, very instinctive and a natural actress. There isn't any uncomfortable feeling at all." [...] Having undergone a thorough characterisation session, Coghill began shooting on 30 June 2008, and first appeared on-screen on 12 September 2008. Coghill has explained that Tony began grooming Whitney {{as soon as he}} met Bianca, ingratiating himself so as to become the family's [...] "hero figure" [...] and [...] "saviour". Discussing his character's relationship with Whitney, Coghill explained that: [...] "The lie that Tony has spun to Whitney is that as soon as she's 16 they'll run away together and start a new life. But Tony's the type of paedophile who preys on younger children. Whitney is beginning to pass her sell-by date with him. [...] He feels like he's losing his little girl but needs to keep Whitney under his control and not speak out." [...] Coghill stated that: [...] "This is the most challenging role I have had to play. But I hope by EastEnders tackling the sensitive issue of child abuse it can raise awareness." [...] When asked how she felt about the abuse storyline, Palmer commented: [...] "It would be brilliant if it helped somebody. If one person out there who's been abused saw [...] {{go out of their way}} to make it <b>easier</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> victim – Whitney's evidence is given by video link – it will be worth it." ...|$|E

Rolling Stone stated, [...] "Pink has shown more personality before, and some cuts, including the goopy ballad [...] "I Don't Believe You", make her sound like just another big-voiced chart-buster. Funhouse would be more fun if Pink went <b>easier</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bad-love songs." ...|$|E
2500|$|The longarm {{quilting}} machine {{makes it easier}} to make larger quilts because of the extended arm that is used. Being able to leverage the larger machine and not having to hold the material that is being used while quilting helps the process move along much faster and makes it <b>easier</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> quilter. Some quilt shops offer longarm services, where one can pay for their project to be quilted and in some cases, bound as well.|$|E
2500|$|Bedfordshire batted {{first at}} Luton. They progressed slowly, making their first 50 in the 23rd over. Whilst they {{improved}} to 143 for 9 in their 50 overs, {{it was never}} going to be enough. By way of comparison, it took Sussex six overs to reach their first 50, with Ian Ward (65 off 44) scoring most of the early runs, although admittedly batting was <b>easier</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> drying pitch. Sussex overhauled their modest target with 31.3 overs to go - almost two thirds of their allotted quota.|$|E

2500|$|One {{advantage}} of electrification {{is the lack}} of pollution from the locomotives. [...] Electrification results in higher performance, lower maintenance costs and lower energy costs. Power plants, even if they burn fossil fuels, are far cleaner than mobile sources such as locomotive engines. The power can come from clean or renewable sources, including geothermal power, hydroelectric power, nuclear power, solar power and wind turbines. Electric locomotives are quiet compared to diesel locomotives since there is no engine and exhaust noise and less mechanical noise. The lack of reciprocating parts means electric locomotives are <b>easier</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> track, reducing track maintenance.|$|E
2500|$|The only {{diagonal}} ambling gait {{is called}} the fox trot in English, though it is given other names in other countries. The diagonal footfalls are usually slightly uneven, occurring in [...] "couplets" [...] of a 1-2, 3-4 rhythm that gives the rider a slight forward and back sensation when riding. [...] They are considered physically <b>easier</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> horse than the lateral gaits as less hollowing of the back occurs when the horse is in the gait. [...] Diagonal four beat gaits are classified as an alternative ambling gait, even though derived from the trot rather than the pace. The genetic mechanism that allows diagonal ambling gaits {{appears to be the}} same gene responsible for lateral ambling gaits.|$|E
2500|$|There are 2 common {{methods of}} deworming. [...] Purge dewormers that kill parasites {{with a single}} strong dose, are given periodically, {{depending}} on local conditions and veterinary recommendations. Continuous dewormers, also known as [...] "daily" [...] dewormers, are given in the horse's feed each day, in small doses, and kill worms as they infect the horse. [...] Neither of these methods is perfect; purge dewormers are effective for rapidly killing parasites, but are gone from the horses' body in a few days, and then the horse may start to be re-infected. [...] Continuous dewormers are a mild low dose and may be <b>easier</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> horse, but may not be effective in quickly killing worms in a heavily-infected horse and may contribute to drug resistance. [...] If a treatment doesn't kill at least 95% of a worm species, that species is classed as 'resistant' to the drug. [...] For adult horses, frequent rotation of several types of dewormers is no longer recommended, as it can often lead to overtreatment and subsequent drug resistance.|$|E

2500|$|Haig {{suggested}} {{that with the}} ample artillery ammunition available, capturing the Montauban spur would be <b>easier</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first day and that and the tactical benefit of possession of the Montauban and Serre–Miraumont spurs, would reduce the danger from German counter-attacks. After consultations between Joffre, General Ferdinand Foch and Haig, Rawlinson was instructed to plan for an advance of [...] on a [...] front, taking the German first position and advancing midway to the second position on the right at Montauban, taking the first position in the centre and the second position from Pozières to Grandcourt. An extra corps was allotted to the Fourth Army but the different concepts of step by step advances or a quicker advance, to force German withdrawals on the flanks, was not resolved. Further problems arose, when the French contribution to the offensive was reduced and in late May, there was doubt that the French could participate at all. On 29 May, Haig directed that {{the aims of the}} offensive, would be to wear down the German army and reach positions favourable for an offensive in 1917.|$|E
2500|$|Normally, {{a breath}} is taken every other stroke. This can be {{sustained}} over long distances. Often, breathing every stroke slows the swimmer down. (At a certain level, a breathing stroke becomes just {{as fast as a}} nonbreathing stroke; therefore, very experienced competitors, such as Michael Phelps, may breathe every stroke.) Other intervals of breathing practised by elite swimmers include the [...] "two up, one down" [...] approach in which the swimmer breathes for two successive strokes and then keeps their head in the water on the next stroke, which is <b>easier</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lungs. Swimmers with good lung capacity might also breathe every 3rd stroke during sprints for the finish. Some swimmers can even hold their breaths for an entire race (assuming that it is a short one). To be able to swim with best results {{it is important to keep}} one's head down when taking a breath. If the swimmer lifts his or her head too high the swimmer's hips often drop, creating drag, thus slowing the swimmer down. The closer one's head is to the water the better one swim is the general technique used by swimmers.|$|E

5000|$|Clark's third studio album, How I Feel, {{was issued}} in May 1998. The album's lead single, [...] "Now That I Found You," [...] {{reached the top}} five in both the United States and Canada. It was the album's second single, [...] "You're <b>Easy</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Eyes," [...] that gave Clark's first American No. 1, the song also reached No. 1 in Canada.
