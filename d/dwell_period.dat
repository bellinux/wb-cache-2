Fatigue crack propagation rates were determined and were found to vary with the environment and the loading waveform used in the tests. At small crack depths in HSF, oxidation in air increased cyclic crack growth rates by over an order of magnitude compared with vacuum.

40|$|The {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the modeling of the behaviour of welds when subjected to severe thermal and mechanical loads where the maximum temperature during <b>dwell</b> <b>periods</b> lies in the creep range. The methodology of the life assessment method R 5 is applied where the detailed calculations are carried out using the linear matching method (LMM), with the objective of generating an analytic model. The linear matching method has been developed to allow accurate predictions using the methodology of R 5, the UK life assessment method. The method is here applied to a set of weld endurance tests, where reverse bending is interrupted by creep <b>dwell</b> <b>periods.</b> The weld and parent material are both Type 316 L(N) material, and data were available for fatigue tests and tests with 1 and 5 h <b>dwell</b> <b>periods</b> to failure. The elastic, plastic, and creep behavior of the weld geometry is predicted with the LMM using the best available understanding of the properties of the weld and parent material. The numerical results are translated into a semi-analytic model. Using the R 5 standard creep/fatigue model, the predicted life of the experimental welds specimens are compared with experimental data. The analysis shows that the most severe conditions occur at the weld/parent material interface, with fatigue damage concentrated predominantly in the parent material, whereas the creep damage occurs predominantly in the weld material. Hence, creep and fatigue damage proceed relatively independently. The predictions of the model are good, except that the reduction in fatigue life due to the presence of the weld is underestimated. This is attributed to the lack of separate fatigue date for the weld and parent material and the lack of information concerning the heat affected zone. With an adjustment of a single factor in the model, the predictions are very good. The analysis in this paper demonstrates that the primary properties of weld structures may be understood through a number of structural parameters, defined by cyclic analysis using the linear matching method and through the choice of appropriate material data. The physical assumptions adopted conform to those of the R 5 life assessment procedure. The resulting semi-analytic model provides a more secure method for extrapolation of experimental data than previously available...|$|R

Estimates {{of the life of}} these components are difficult because of the indefinite nature of the assumed constitutive model and also of the relevant material properties. In an attempt to handle this problem, a new predictive technique is presented which is based on the concept of 'fuzzy sets ' (1). The basic ideas behind fuzzy sets are simply explained and then applied to test results previously obtained (2) on a 1 Cr Mo V steel. A simple linear cumulative damage rule is used for illustration. Using the method, estimates of system uncertainty can be made which can then be combined with random uncertainty of the parameters to obtain a probability measure of the number of loading cycles to failure of a component. Cumulative distribution functions for the system uncertainty in the test results are produced and their usefulness to the designer discussed.

Due to the demands for improved performance and efficiency in applications of the superalloys, new and improved higher temperature alloy systems are being developed. Constitutive relations for these materials need to be formulated accordingly to predict behavior of cracks at notches in components under cyclic loading with peak <b>dwell</b> <b>periods</b> representative of gas turbine engine disk materials. Since properties are affected by microstructure at various length scales ranging from 10 nm tertiary γ' precipitates to 5 - 30 μm grains, hierarchical multiscale modeling is essential to address behavior at the component level. The goal of this work {{is to develop a}} framework for hierarchical multiscale modeling network that features linkage of several fine scale models to incorporate relevant microstructure attributes into the framework to improve the predictability of the constitutive model. This hierarchy of models is being developed in a collaborative research program with the Ohio State University. The fine scale models include the phase field model which addresses dislocation dissociation in the γ matrix and γ' precipitate phases, and the critical stresses from the model are used as inputs to a grain scale crystal plasticity model in a bottom-up fashion. The crystal plasticity model incorporates microstructure attributes by homogenization. A major task of the present work is to link the crystal plasticity model, informed by the phase field model, to the macroscale model and calibrate models in a top-down fashion to experimental data for a range of microstructures of the improved alloy system by implementing a hierarchical optimization scheme with a parameter clustering strategy. Another key part of the strategy to be developed in this thesis is the incorporation of polycrystal plasticity simulations to model a large range of virtual microstructures that have not been experimentally realized (processed), which append the experimentally available microstructures. Simulations of cyclic responses with <b>dwell</b> <b>periods</b> for this range of virtual (and limited experimental) polycrystalline microstructures will be used to (i) provide additional data to optimize parameter fitting for a microstructure-insensitive macroscopic internal state variable (ISV) model with thermal recovery and rate dependence relevant to the temperatures of interest, and (ii) provide input to train an artificial neural network that will associate the macroscopic ISV model parameters with microstructure attributes for this material. Such microstructure sensitive macroscopic models can then be employed in component level finite element studies to model cyclic behavior with dwell times at smooth and cracked notched specimens. M.

In the case of using EGR (49 – 52 %) at 1500 rpm and 10 % of engine peak torque, by increasing the fuel injection pressure from 300 to 800 bar, engine thermal efficiency increased from 16. 5 to 19. 1 % and 17. 1 to 19. 7 %, BSFC decreased by 13. 5 % and 13. 2 %, smoke level decreased by 74. 3 % and 70. 1 % and NOx emissions increased by 69. 6 % and 68. 0 %, respectively for a short (5 CAD) and a long (40 CAD) <b>dwell</b> <b>period.</b> In addition, the study of a variation of pilot fuel quantities (0. 8 – 3. 0 mg/stroke) with a fixed <b>dwell</b> <b>period</b> (5 CAD) at two different fuel injection pressures (250 bar and 800 bar) shows that the smaller pilot quantity with the higher fuel injection pressure can be considered as an enhanced strategy to control engine performance and emissions simultaneously. Therefore, the combination of higher injection pressure, longer dwell, smaller pilot quantity and the use of EGR could potentially improve fuel consumption and minimise engine emissions. The use of TME-diesel blends results in lower engine thermal efficiency and higher fuel consumption and NOx emissions. In the case of 1500 rpm and 25 % of engine peak torque, the combustion of TME 10 and TME 30 reduced the engine thermal efficiency from iii 35. 3 to 33. 7 % and 35. 3 to 33. 2 % and increased the BSFC by 4. 9 % and 6. 5 %, respectively.

40|$|Many {{components}} in conventional {{and nuclear power}} plant, chemical plant and aero engines may be subjected to severe loading conditions, i. e. loads which cause reverse plasticity and/or incremental growth (Ratchetting). If operating temperatures are high, creep strains may also be significant and may exacerbate the ratchetting process. Also the residual stress fields associated with the cycling of load in the plastic region for a material will influence the accumulation of strain during the dwell periods between cycles when steady loading is sustained. Some analytical solutions for the cyclic behaviour of simple components and loadings are available, however very little information {{on the effects of}} stress concentrations and complex loading conditions on ratchetting is published. A better understanding of the mechanisms of ratchetting for complex components and loadings is essential in order to identify characteristic behaviours which can be used to aid the design process for {{components in}} potential ratchetting situations. A range of component geometries, uniform sections and stress concentrations, and loading conditions have been analysed by the finite element method to investigate ratchetting mechanisms and to obtain ratchet and <b>dwell</b> <b>period</b> strain data. The effects of stress concentrations, material behaviour models, loading conditions and stress redistribution due to creep on ratchetting mechanisms and strain accumulations are described. <b>Dwell</b> <b>period</b> creep effects are bounded by the 'no creep' (zero <b>dwell</b> <b>period)</b> condition {{on the one hand and}} by complete redistribution between cycles at the other extreme.

40|$|Design {{and life}} {{assessment}} procedures for high temperatures {{are based on}} 'expert knowledge' in structural mechanics and materials science, combined with simplified methods of structural analysis. Of these R 5 {{is one of the}} most widely used life assessment methods internationally with procedures based on reference stress techniques and shakedown calculations using linear elastic solutions. These have been augmented by full finite element analysis and, recently, the development of a new programming method, the Linear Matching Method (LMM), that allows a range of direct solutions that include shakedown methods and simplified analysis in excess of shakedown. In this paper LMM procedures are compared with calculations typical of those employed in R 5 for cyclic loading problems when the assumption of a constant residual stress field is appropriate including shakedown and limit analyses, creep rupture analysis and the evaluation of accumulated creep deformation. A typical example of a 3 D holed plate subjected to a cyclic thermal load and a constant mechanical load is assessed in detail. These comparisons demonstrate the significant advantages of linear matching methods for a typical case. For a range of cyclic problems when the residual stress field varies during the cycle, which include the evaluation of plastic strain amplitude, ratchet limit and accumulated creep strains during a high temperature <b>dwell</b> <b>periods,</b> the corresponding LMM and R 5 procedures are discussed in an accompanying paper...|$|R
30|$|Computational {{analyses}} of a stationary crack showed the progressive accumulation of strain near the crack tip under fatigue, which justified the strain accumulation criterion used in XFEM prediction of fatigue crack growth. During simulation, the crack length was recorded against {{the number of}} loading cycles, {{and the results were}} in good agreement with the experimental data. It was also shown, both experimentally and numerically, that an increase of <b>dwell</b> <b>period</b> leads to an increase of crack growth rate due to the increased creep deformation near the crack tip, but this effect is marginal when compared to the dwell effects under fatigue-oxidation conditions.|$|E
40|$|The {{knowledge}} of slip or drift flux in {{two phase flow}} is necessary for several technical processes (e. g. two phase pressure losses, heat and mass transfer in steam generators and condensers, <b>dwell</b> <b>period</b> in chemical reactors, moderation effectivity of two phase coolant in BWR). In the following the most important models for two phase flow with different phase velocities (e. g. slip or drift models, analogy between pressure loss and steam quality, #epsilon# -#epsilon# models and models for the calculation of void distribution in reposing fluids) are classified, described and worked up for a further comparison with own experimental data.

40|$|Minimum dwell {{fatigue testing}} of nickel based {{superalloy}} FG RR 1000 at 650 [*]∘C {{has led to}} significant reductions in fatigue life. The reduction in fatigue life under minimum dwell fatigue has been caused by relatively early and multiple crack initiation events from a highly oxidised surface. The depth of oxidation damage, in the present circumstances achieved under cyclic loading at 650 [*]∘C, appeared similar to previous stress free isothermal exposure studies conducted on RR 1000 but at higher temperature/shorter duration suggesting an enhancement in oxidation due to applied stress. Surface oxidation and crack initiation were clearly resisted under the baseline loading cycle despite being exposed for similar periods of exposure time. To understand the respective effects {{of the environment and}} minimum <b>dwell</b> <b>period,</b> vacuum fatigue and hold time oxidation tests have been completed...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAn observer-based fault {{tolerant}} control (FTC) method is proposed for constrained switched systems (CSS) with input constraints. A family of Lyapunov-based bounded controllers {{are designed to}} ensure that, whenever actuator faults occur at the <b>dwell</b> time <b>period</b> of each continuous mode, the mode is always within its corresponding stability region. A set of switching laws are designed to guarantee the asymptotic stability of the overall CSS. The fixed stability regions on which the FTC method is based are also relaxed by the proposed variable stability regions. An example of CPU processing illustrates the effectiveness of proposed method...|$|R
40|$|Solutions were {{formulated}} to examine, independently, {{the roles}} of osmolality and glucose in the reduction of viability and inhibition of phagocyte function by dextrose-containing peritoneal dialysis fluids. The exposure of neutrophils (polymorphonuclear leukocytes) to test fluids containing > or = 2. 7 % (wt/vol) glucose resulted in significant cytotoxicity as assessed by the release of lactate dehydrogenase above control values (7. 12 +/- 2. 65 %). At the highest concentration of glucose (4. 5 %), lactate dehydrogenase release was 15. 83 +/- 0. 49 % (P < 0. 05). These effects were {{directly related to the}} presence of D-glucose in the test fluids. In contrast, phagocytosis and the release of leukotriene B 4 from PMN stimulated with serum-treated zymosan were significantly inhibited in an osmolality-, but not glucose-, dependent manner. The inhibition of tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin- 6 release from mononuclear leukocytes was inhibited by a combination of osmolality and monosaccharide concentration. Under the same conditions, PMN respiratory burst activation remained unaffected irrespective of glucose concentration or fluid osmolality. These data indicate that, in addition to the low pH of peritoneal dialysis fluid and its high lactate concentration, its glucose content (either directly or {{as a consequence of the}} resulting hyperosmolality of the fluid) inhibits cell functional parameters. These findings suggest clinically significant inhibition of host defense mechanisms because, in high-glucose dialysis fluids, osmolality does not reach physiologic values, even during extended intraperitoneal <b>dwell</b> <b>periods...</b>|$|R
40|$|Corrugated 0. 05 {{in thick}} strips of Fe-Cr-Al {{ferritic}} stainless steel samples with 4 % and 6 % aluminum were heat treated, and the resulting Al 2 O 3 oxide was analyzed using SEM imaging. Three heat treatment cycles were carried out for each sample. The heat treatments were based on future metal-substrate catalytic converter processing prior to applying the washcoat Each heat treatment started with a 90 minute ramp from room temperature to 538 °C and a 32. 5 minute ramp from 538 °C to 899 °C. The three different <b>dwell</b> <b>periods</b> at 899 °C were 4 hours, 6 hours, and taking a sample out every hour for 4 hours and letting it air cool. The full 4 and 6 hour cycles were finished with an in-furnace cool recorded by an external thermocouple and datalogger. Additional samples {{were included in the}} 6 hour cycle that were flattened by pressing a metal cylinder {{across the top of the}} corrugated sheet. All samples were sputtered with a 300 -Å-thick layer of gold to improve resolution in the SEM. Cold rolling to form the 0. 05 in sheet and possibly the corrugation deformed the microstructure and altered the surface, which produced different oxide structures during heat treatment in linear patterns. Also, the different regions of the corrugation (ridge, valley and slope) produced different oxide formations. The ridges showed a flatter oxide, the valleys showed a linear pattern with alternating needle-like and rough granular oxides, and the slopes showed needle-like oxide with patches of smooth rounded oxide. The desired oxide is a needle-like structure which provides a large surface area for the catalyst layer (washcoat) during the production of catalytic converters...|$|R
