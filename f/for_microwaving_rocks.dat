40|$|Abstract: The paper {{analyzed}} {{the process of}} the <b>microwave</b> drill <b>for</b> <b>rock,</b> and established the theoretical analysis model and the system equations. And through the numerical simulation, the electric field intensity and the temperature of the top of the microwave generator increased with the increase of the depth that the conductor was inserted, and the thermal runaway effect was strengthened. So the <b>microwave</b> assisted <b>rock</b> breaking scheme with microwave near field energy and thermal runaway effect is feasible...|$|R
