6000|$|Pray {{tell the}} illustrious Philip van Artevelde, that I {{will deal with}} the nefarious case in {{question}} <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a little doubtful of the practicability of doing so, and frisking outside the bounds {{of the law of}} libel.

6000|$|... "That is {{just what}} I don't want to do. I {{want to see what}} these {{meetings}} are like, what sort of arguments are used, what the spirit of the people <b>is,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can.</b> That <b>is</b> what <b>I</b> would really like to find out, Aaron--the spirit of the people." ...|$|R
6000|$|Oh, {{something}} so wonderful has happened. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> hardly believe it.
