60|$|Gentle {{measures}} are those {{which tend to}} exert a calming, quieting, and soothing influence on the mind, or to produce only such <b>excitements</b> as are pleasurable in their character, as means of repressing wrong and encouraging right action. Ungentle {{measures are}} those which tend to inflame and irritate the mind, or to agitate it with painful <b>excitements.</b>|$|R

5|$|Critics {{agreed that}} Arkham Originss boss battles were {{one area of}} {{improvement}} over its predecessors; they offered dynamic, multiphase conflicts with their own stories. While not considering all equally fun or impressive, reviewers said that their variety and unpredictability provided <b>excitement.</b> Less-notable characters from the comics were considered less compelling than more-popular characters.|$|E

5|$|Two ballets caused great <b>excitement</b> in Paris in the 1830s. In November 1831, Meyerbeer's opera Robert le diable had {{its first}} performance. It {{featured}} a short ballet called Ballet of the Nuns. In this little ballet, scantily clad nuns rise from their graves to dance wantonly in the moonlight. The public loved this little supernatural ballet.|$|E
5|$|After {{approximately}} three weeks, the expedition arrived in Lambaréné {{and met with}} Albert Schweitzer. Klevan later described the meeting with Schweitzer as the greatest moment of the entire expedition. Later, the hospital received 500kg of Norwegian klippfisk (dried and salted cod), a particular favourite with the hospital's patients. The medicines were handed over, and the container was opened. Even though the drainage had been monitored throughout the expedition, there was still great <b>excitement</b> associated with seeing the result firsthand. The block of ice {{turned out to be}} almost entirely intact.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the time}} of the {{armistice}} which ended the war, Baker's engagement with Scott was broken off; Scott then began a relationship with an American diplomat in Paris, Philander Cable. Missing his fiancee and the <b>excitement</b> of the war, he felt directionless; he dreaded going back to work in an office and considered himself a sportsman rather than a businessman. Though he was scheduled to return to the United States in December, Baker requested and was refused an extension of his time in France.|$|E

5|$|At {{least one}} of the objects now in the British Museum can be seen in a cabinet in the {{background}} of a family portrait from 1838 (left), the year before Ferdinand was born. In his Reminiscences Ferdinand recalled his <b>excitement</b> as a child when he was allowed to help wrap and unwrap his father's collection, which spent the summers in a strongroom when the family left Vienna for a country villa.|$|E
5|$|Bears {{produce a}} number of vocal and non-vocal sounds. Tongue-clicking, {{grunting}} or chuffing many be made in cordial situations, such as between mothers and cubs or courting couples, while moaning, huffing, sorting or blowing air is made when an individual is stressed. Barking is produced during times of alarm, <b>excitement</b> or to give away the animal's position. Warning sounds include jaw-clicking and lip-popping, while teeth-chatters, bellows, growls, roars and pulsing sounds are made in aggressive encounters. Cubs may squeal, bawl, bleat or scream when in distress and make motor-like humming when comfortable or nursing.|$|E
5|$|Beese {{introduced}} Winehouse to his boss, Nick Gatfield, and the Island head {{shared his}} enthusiasm in signing the young artist. Winehouse was signed to Island, as rival interest in Winehouse {{had started to}} build to include representatives of EMI and Virgin starting to make moves. Beese told HitQuarters that he felt the reason behind the <b>excitement,</b> over an artist who was an atypical pop star for the time, was due to a backlash against reality TV music shows, which included audiences starved for fresh, genuine young talent.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} 1990s, {{real-time}} strategy games began outselling turn-based games. As they surged in popularity, major 4X developers fell into difficulties. Sid Meier's Firaxis Games released Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri in 1999 to critical acclaim, {{but the game}} fell short of commercial expectations. Civilization III encountered development problems followed by a rushed release in 2001. Despite the <b>excitement</b> over Master of Orion III, its release in 2003 was met with criticism for its lack of player control, poor interface, and weak AI. Game publishers eventually became risk-averse to financing the development of 4X games.|$|E
5|$|Colbert {{received}} {{the idea for}} The Magical Worlds of Harry Potter {{during the summer of}} 2000, when his young nephew and nieces spent their vacation at his home in Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina.

When his nephew and nieces {{received the}} book, they read it for the remainder of their vacation with him.|$|E
5|$|Godwin's book {{follows a}} venerable {{tradition}} of travel literature that blends the <b>excitement</b> of journeys to foreign places with utopian reflection; More's Utopia is {{cited as a}} forerunner, as is the account of Amerigo Vespucci. Godwin could fall back on an extensive body of work describing the voyages undertaken by his protagonist, including books by Hakluyt and Jan Huyghen van Linschoten, and the narratives deriving from the Jesuit mission in Beijing.|$|E
6000|$|... "'All right,' I'd say. 'Romp {{along and}} move. This here <b>excitement's</b> killing me. If I don't reform some, and loosen up {{the strain of}} this {{checkered}} dissipation I won't have a nerve left.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Then it's all right" [...] {{said the}} judge, {{and he took}} up the Tuskingum Intelligencer, lying till then unread in the <b>excitements</b> which had {{followed}} its arrival the day before, {{and began to read}} it.|$|R
5|$|Initially, the <b>excitement</b> {{generated}} by Pac-Mans home release prompted retail stores {{to expand their}} inventory to sell video games. Drugstores began stocking video game cartridges, and toy retailers vied for new releases. Kmart and J. C. Penney competed against Sears to become the largest vendor of video games. The game's release also led {{to an increase in}} sales of the Atari 2600 console.|$|E
5|$|Jim Dawson devoted {{an entire}} chapter of his 2006 Modern History of the Fart to Shatner's alleged {{flatulence}} in Mind Meld, which he compares {{to the sound}} of someone stepping on a tribble. G. Noel Gross of DVD Talk compared the <b>excitement</b> over this sound to that evinced by adolescent boys watching pornography, and compared the level of scrutiny devoted to the scene to that received by the Zapruder film of the Kennedy assassination.|$|E
5|$|Like other nuthatches, {{this is a}} noisy {{species with}} a range of vocalizations. The male's mating song is a rapid nasal qui-qui-qui-qui-qui-qui-qui. The contact call between members of a pair, given most {{frequently}} in the fall and winter is a thin squeaky nit, uttered up to 30 times a minute. A more distinctive sound is a shrill kri repeated rapidly with mounting anxiety or <b>excitement</b> kri-kri-kri-kri-kri-kri-kri-kri; the Rocky Mountains and Great Basin subspecies have a higher, faster yididitititit call, and Pacific birds a more nasal beeerf.|$|E
6000|$|... "My Babie, I {{hope you}} are not spoilt by all the <b>excitements</b> of our last few years," [...] said the mother. [...] "You won't find life in Collingwood Street much like life in Hyde Corner." ...|$|R
5000|$|... while {{during these}} <b>excitements</b> severe and {{exciting}} denunciations of the Bishops were publicly made-while {{they were called}} 'popes' and 'usurpers'-the patriarchal appearance and the humble and loving manner of Bishop Roberts disarmed prejudice wherever he went.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have had}} such a time, Mr Swinburne. I am not used to these <b>excitements.</b> As Vicar of Chuntsey, in Essex'--he threw this in with an indescribable airiness of vanity--'I have never known such things happen." ...|$|R
