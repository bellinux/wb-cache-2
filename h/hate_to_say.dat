25|$|People don't {{understand}} {{how difficult it}} is living with a head injury. It's really hard; it sucks; it's aggravating. It feels like I'm a little off on things, a little slower. My left side is always numb, and my brain doesn't feel as sharp as it used to. And it's tough when people don't want to see or know about that. They draw a big X on you, and that's sad. It's like you're forgotten when you're out of the limelight. Nobody owes me anything, but somebody could maybe give me something (work-wise) to keep me involved. I used to make $5,000 for a two-hour appearance. Now, I have a hard time finding a job for anything. I <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it, but sometimes I wish God had just taken me.|$|E
500|$|Lesley Aeschiliman of Yahoo! Voices wrote [...] "This year [...] is SpongeBob SquarePants' tenth anniversary, and I <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it, but SpongeBob {{has really}} been showing his age recently. This special was not worth being part of such a {{milestone}} year for a television series." ...|$|E
500|$|Michael Jackson wrote [...] "Speechless" [...] after a water balloon {{fight with}} {{children}} in Germany. It took him 45 minutes. In an interview with [...] Vibe magazine, the musician commented, [...] "I was so happy after the fight that I ran upstairs in their house and wrote 'Speechless'. Fun inspires me. I <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that, because it's such a romantic song." [...] He added, [...] "But it was the fight that did it. I was happy, and I wrote it in its entirety right there. I felt {{it would be good}} enough for the album. Out of the bliss comes magic, wonderment, and creativity." [...] Jackson would consider [...] "Speechless" [...] to be one of his favorite songs on Invincible.|$|E
60|$|Again {{the girl}} hesitated; she <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it, {{but if it}} would help to recall the past to that poor, dimmed mind, it was her duty.|$|R
6000|$|The aviator dug his toe {{into the}} ground and still looking down, blurted {{something}} which he evidently <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> [...] "If {{it is a matter of}} living, old top," [...] he said, [...] "er--money, er--you know--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I'm wretched," [...] {{she said}} very mildly. She <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> hear herself <b>say</b> it; she tried <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it as judicially as possible.|$|R
500|$|Urlacher dislocated {{his wrist}} in the 2009 season opener against the Packers. He {{underwent}} surgery, {{and went on}} to miss the remainder of the season. [...] Urlacher had severely damaged a bone in his wrist that was adjacent to a major nerve. Urlacher was forced to wear a cast on his wrist for 12 weeks and spend a month in therapy to recover from the injury. The Bears began to struggle on offense and defense. As frustration built, Urlacher criticized the Bears offense, stating that the addition of quarterback Jay Cutler had changed the team's identity. The Bears, who have historically employed a strong running game, were beginning to rely more on the pass on offense. He went on to say, [...] "Kyle Orton might not be the flashiest quarterback, but the guy is a winner, and that formula worked for us. I <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it, but that's the truth." [...] Urlacher and Cutler later made amends. The Bears finished the season with a 7–9 record, and missed the playoffs for the third consecutive year.|$|E
500|$|Scogin's introspective lyrics {{have covered}} topics like materialism, death, and the Nashville Christian music industry. The lyrics for Wars and Rumors of Wars were formed after a family loss: [...] "...only {{a year ago}} my father passed away. And I <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> this, because it sounds like such a band-dude thing to say, but the lyrics are a lot darker than any other record just because of how {{personal}} they are for me." [...] Scogin usually refers to his lyrics as poems and has maintained that [...] "a song is never finished but abandoned." [...] "...as an artist you can forever be changing a song or making a song 'better' or whatever but the moment that you stop recording and send it off to be mastered you have not 'finished' the song…you have only abandoned the song {{and that is how}} it will stay forever." [...] His lyrics sometimes espouse Christian themes and beliefs, albeit subtly. For example, the track [...] "Yellow Dress: Locked Knees" [...] from Everything... contains the Spanish lyrics [...] "Jesus, yo quiero que este mundo te conozca."; when translated, it says [...] "Jesus, I want this world to know You." [...] The song [...] "And Shot Each Other" [...] from The Fiancée fades out into a Sacred Harp choir singing the song 'Child of Grace', which features the lyrics [...] "How happy is a child of grace, who feels his sins forgiven / This world, he cries, is not my place / I seek a place in Heaven." ...|$|E
2500|$|Th’ bones whereof {{some men}} got rich upon sending owners to th’ happy hunting grounds. Looks {{as if your}} work was done Bill, since th’ Overland is paved with steel ‘stead of oxen {{painting}} over plain and hill all gone for good, there’s a new deal. I <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> good bye but guess it’s true that you have quit us all f’r good, can’t see how we’re goin’ t’ see an’ do th’ things that seem‘s you only could.” ...|$|E
60|$|Beyond this sentimental reluctance, Mrs. Savor later {{confessed to}} Annie {{herself that she}} was really {{accepting}} the charge of Idella in the same spirit of self-sacrifice as that in which Annie was surrendering it, and that she felt, when Mr. Peck first suggested it, {{that the child was}} better off with Miss Kilburn; only she <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> so. Her husband seemed to think it would make up to her for the one they lost, but nothing could really do that.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Tavernake shall decide!" [...] she exclaimed, {{waving her}} hand to him. [...] "Mr. Tavernake, there is a {{difference}} of opinion about my earrings. Major Post here,"--she indicated a distinguished-looking elderly gentleman, with carefully trimmed beard and moustache, and an eyeglass attached to a thin band of black ribbon--"Major Post wants me to wear turquoises. I prefer my pearls. Mr. Crease half agrees with me, but as he never agrees with any one, on principle, he <b>hates</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> so. Mr. Faulkes is wavering. You shall decide; you, I know, are {{one of those people who}} never waver." ...|$|R
5000|$|Favre {{would respond}} that Cook's {{comments}} {{were taken out}} of context, and that Cook was [...] "joking around," [...] but also added that [...] "the {{lesson to be learned}} in all that is, I <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> even <b>say</b> it, is that you can't trust anybody." ...|$|R
2500|$|A product missing its {{announced}} release date, and the {{labeling of}} it as vaporware by the press, {{can be caused by}} its development taking longer than planned. Most software products are not released on time, according to researchers in 2001 who studied the causes and effects of vaporware; [...] "I <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> yes, but yes", a Microsoft product manager stated in 1984, adding that [...] "the problem isn't just at Microsoft". The phenomenon is so common that Lotus' release of 1-2-3 on time in January 1983, three months after announcing it, amazed many.|$|E
2500|$|After {{viewing the}} {{shooting}} from multiple angles, police use-of-force expert Roy Bedard {{changed his mind}} about his opinion, saying: [...] "I <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> this, it looks like an execution to me" [...] and [...] "It really looks bad for the officer." [...] University of San Francisco law professor Robert Talbot said the videos could support a claim of an accidental shooting: [...] "Nothing about his body looks murderous." [...] Attorney Harland Braun, who won acquittal for an officer in the Rodney King beating, noted that video evidence can be deceptive. Footage does not show what happened before or after an incident.|$|E
2500|$|The Downtown, Inc./Downtown Voice {{was another}} Downtown-related magazine. Kevin Clear of the Creneau Media Group planned to {{establish}} a magazine about Downtown Houston that would be published by Creneau. In January 1990 his company had developed a business plan aimed towards competing with Houston Downtown magazine. Houston Downtown was closed before Clear could develop a new magazine. Clear said [...] "I <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> we danced on their grave, but we weren't unhappy {{about the way things}} turned out." [...] Clear planned to introduce his magazine in May 1991. As of January 1991 he had not decided on a name for the magazine. Elise Perachio became the editor of the magazine, which was ultimately named Downtown, Inc. On August 1, 1994, the magazine, then called Downtown Voice, was sold to company Media Ink.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. It's very silly, but I {{want to tell}} it, because I <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> {{have people}} <b>say</b> and think such things about us and Laurie." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> {{go without}} <b>saying</b> good-bye," [...] she said, tremulously. [...] "He's always {{been good to}} me," [...] she added, smitten with sudden {{realization}} of her husband's kindness.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>say,</b> I <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> bother you--dare <b>say</b> you're {{busy and}} {{all that sort of}} thing--but would you mind if I popped in for half a second and used your 'phone?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm sorry, Babbitt, but {{the best}} thing you can do--I <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it, but you could help us most by keeping {{strictly}} out of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|He was {{struggling}} {{as if with}} the pangs of death, but he said, [...] "'Tis childish, I know, but I <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> good-bye to it all." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> {{hear you}} <b>say</b> 'the force,' Mark, {{just as if}} you were still a detective; it is bad enough that you should have belonged to it, even for the purpose you did; but you have done with it now." ...|$|R
6000|$|Pony {{agreed that}} this would be the best way, but he did not really like the notion of living so long among the Indians that he would not {{remember}} his father and mother when he saw them; he would like to stay till he was pretty nearly grown up, and then come back in a chief's dress, with eagle plumes all down his back and a bow in his hand, and scare them a little when he first came in the house and then protect them from the tribe and tell them who he was, and enjoy their surprise. But he <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> this <b>to</b> Jim Leonard, because he would think he was afraid to live with the Indians always. He hardly dared to ask him what the Indians would do to him if they did not adopt him, but he thought he had better, and Jim said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'I <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> {{disappoint}} you,' <b>says</b> Captain Mankeltow, 'because I {{know you}} feel as an inventor.' I wasn't feeling like an inventor just then. I felt friendly, but the British haven't more tact than {{you can pick up}} with a knife out of a plate of soup.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it, but I think I'd {{go over to}} the shore, {{till the}} storm was over and I knew jest how thet dam was a-goin' to act." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Carson, this is {{a serious}} matter," [...] said Saunders. [...] "I <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> much about it, but the stuff has been found here, and I don't see how I can do {{otherwise}} than look to you for that fourteen dollars." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, hang it, if {{you must}} know---- <b>Hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it, but I'd do almost {{anything}} {{to get rid of}} you. Fact is, I've been sort of touring with a lady and her father, and you would be in the way!" ...|$|E
50|$|Stevie and I {{have been}} hanging {{out a little}} bit lately, and we’ve been talking about that. I think that’s {{something}} that would happen this year as well. Oddly enough, I <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> even <b>say</b> it, I think the 40th anniversary of that is next year. Jeez! Is that possible? So we’ve been talking about it. Of course, we’ve been talking about it off and on for a long time, but Stevie seems really into the idea. So yes, I would say yes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, don't say that," [...] Marian put in quickly; [...] "I <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> hear men <b>say</b> they'll never marry. It is such {{a terrible}} mistake. They become so selfish, and frumpish, and old-bachelorish." [...] Dear Marian has a high idea of the {{services}} she has rendered to society in saving her own fortunate husband from this miserable and deplorable condition.|$|R
60|$|She <b>hated</b> having <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{this sort}} of thing to a butler, it was so infra dig.; but what could you do with father? Roger, indeed, after making himself {{consistently}} disagreeable about the dance, would come down presently, with his fresh colour and bumpy forehead, as though he had been its promoter; and he would smile, and probably take the prettiest woman in to supper; and at two o'clock, just as they were getting into the swing, he would go up secretly to the musicians and tell them to play 'God Save the Queen,' and go away.|$|R
6000|$|ACIS. Four! I am sorry, Strephon. I {{am getting}} on for three myself; and I know what old age is. I <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> 'I told you so'; {{but she was}} getting a little hard set and flat-chested and thin on the top, wasn't she? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "His arm," [...] said Chad, [...] "is harder'n a diamond. He interduced me to what {{he called}} a shore-perplexus punch, and 'twas like being kicked twice by a mustang. He's playin' it low down on you, Curt. He ain't no sicker'n I am. I <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it, but the runt's workin' you for range and shelter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it [...] . {{it seems}} so disloyal [...] . but, well, I don't like Ruby Gillis now. I liked her {{when we went to}} school and Queen's {{together}} [...] . though not so well as you and Jane of course. But this last year at Carmody she seems so different [...] . so [...] . so [...] ." ...|$|E
5000|$|Kaplan always {{encouraged}} {{people to}} enjoy having sex {{as much as}} possible. However, since the epidemic of AIDS into the United States in the 1970-1980s, she has had to add the caveat: [...] "If you aren't extremely careful, it can kill you." [...] Kaplan commented that she [...] "absolutely <b>hates</b> having <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that. ... I have spent my whole life devising solutions to people's problems, telling them that sex is not dirty or harmful, but a natural function. And now I have to tell them, 'Hey, look out. You could die.'" [...] Two of her disciples are Ruth Westheimer and Hans-Werner Gessmann (in 1976, who added to sex therapy his own humanistic psychological and hypnosis approaches).|$|R
5000|$|During the trial, {{public figures}} freely {{expressed}} their opinions. [...] "Jodi Arias {{has stated that}} she follows me on Twitter so I really <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> be <b>saying</b> that she is guilty but sadly, she is as guilty as it gets", Donald Trump wrote. He also offered Arias legal advice on how she could avoid the maximum sentence. [...] "Jodi should try but the govt. should not make a deal - no jury could be dumb enough to let her off (but you never know, look at OJ & others)," [...] Trump suggested. Arizona Governor Jan Brewer told reporters after an unrelated press event that she believed Arias to be guilty. She sidestepped a question about whether she believed the one-time waitress guilty of manslaughter, second-degree murder or first-degree murder, but said [...] "I don't have all the information, but I think she's guilty." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly, I will promise you," [...] said Will, {{reddening}} however. If {{he never}} said a cutting word about Mr. Casaubon again and left off receiving favors from him, it would clearly be permissible <b>to</b> <b>hate</b> him the more. The poet must know how <b>to</b> <b>hate,</b> <b>says</b> Goethe; and Will was at least ready with that accomplishment. He said that he must go now without waiting for Mr. Casaubon, whom {{he would come to}} take leave of at the last moment. Dorothea gave him her hand, and they exchanged a simple [...] "Good-by." ...|$|R
