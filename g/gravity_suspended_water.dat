5000|$|A {{settling}} basin, {{settling pond}} or decant pond is an earthen or concrete structure using sedimentation to remove settleable matter and turbidity from wastewater. The basins {{are used to}} control water pollution in diverse industries such as agriculture, aquaculture, and mining. [...] Turbidity is an optical property of water caused by scattering of light by material <b>suspended</b> in that <b>water.</b> Although turbidity often varies directly with weight or volumetric measurements of settleable matter, correlation is complicated by variations in size, shape, refractive index, and specific <b>gravity</b> of <b>suspended</b> matter. [...] Settling ponds may be ineffective at reducing turbidity caused by small particles with specific gravity low enough to be suspended by Brownian motion.|$|R
5000|$|UASB uses an {{anaerobic}} process whilst {{forming a}} blanket of granular sludge which suspends in the tank. Wastewater flows upwards through the blanket and is processed (degraded) by the anaerobic microorganisms. The upward flow combined with the settling action of <b>gravity</b> <b>suspends</b> the blanket {{with the aid of}} flocculants. The blanket begins to reach maturity at around three months. Small sludge granules begin to form whose surface area is covered in aggregations of bacteria. In the absence of any support matrix, the flow conditions create a selective environment in which only those microorganisms capable of attaching to each other survive and proliferate. Eventually the aggregates form into dense compact biofilms referred to as [...] "granules".|$|R
