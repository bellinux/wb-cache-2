5|$|After the Order emerged victorious {{from the}} siege, it {{received}} {{financial support from}} Europe, which was used to construct the new capital city on the Sciberras Peninsula. The Italian engineer Francesco Laparelli was sent by the Pope to design the city's fortifications, which were designed along the Italian bastioned system. Laparelli's original design consisted of a bastioned enceinte, with nine cavaliers and a <b>ditch.</b> <b>The</b> city was to be designed along a grid plan, and was to include a naval arsenal and a Manderaggio (a harbour for small ships).|$|E

5|$|From {{the late}} 15th century, {{there was a}} formal {{ceremony}} of degradation, in which Garter King of Arms, accompanied {{by the rest of}} the heralds, proceeded to St George's Chapel. While the Garter King of Arms read aloud the Instrument of Degradation, a herald climbed up a ladder and removed the former knight's banner, crest, helm, and sword, throwing them down into the quire. Then the rest of the heralds kicked them down the length of the chapel, out of the doors, and into the castle <b>ditch.</b> <b>The</b> last such formal degradation was that of James, Duke of Ormonde in 1716.|$|E

This gate is protected by the freestanding Revelin Fortress, which are connected by a wooden drawbridge and a twin-spanned stone bridge spanning a protective <b>ditch.</b> <b>The</b> Outer Gate of Ploče was designed and constructed by architect Mihajlo Hranjac in 1628, while the two bridges to the Revelin Fortress were built in the 15th century by Paskoje Miličević. Miličević was also designed the Pile Gate bridges, which explains the similarities between the bridges. Over the bridge, just like with the Gate of Pile, there is the statue of Saint Blaise, the patron saint of Dubrovnik.|$|E

5|$|After {{learning}} {{they are}} short of money, {{a group of}} four robbers decide to execute a bank heist. The four create a plan and hire an unwitting chauffeur to drive them to their location. As soon as they reach an isolated road, the robbers force the chauffeur out of the car, gag him, and throw him into a <b>ditch.</b> <b>The</b> robbers then drive {{the car to the}} bank. After entering, they kill a security guard and use explosives to force the bank vault open. The thieves steal as much money as possible and make a quick retreat to their car. Back in the park, a young couple on a walk discover the unconscious body of the chauffeur, and the man calls the police.|$|E
5|$|Although motte-and-bailey castles are {{the best}} known castle design, they were not always the most {{numerous}} in any given area. A popular alternative was the ringwork castle, involving a palisade being built {{on top of a}} raised earth rampart, protected by a <b>ditch.</b> <b>The</b> choice of motte and bailey or ringwork was partially driven by terrain, as mottes were typically built on low ground, and on deeper clay and alluvial soils. Another factor may have been speed, as ringworks were faster to build than mottes. Some ringwork castles were later converted into motte-and-bailey designs, by filling in the centre of the ringwork to produce a flat-topped motte. The reasons for why this decision was taken are unclear; motte-and-bailey castles may have been felt to be more prestigious, or easier to defend; another theory is that like the terpen in Netherlands, or Vorburg and Hauptburg in Lower Rhineland, raising the height of the castle was done to create a drier site.|$|E

They found the ships of the Second Carrier Division and hit Jun'yō with two bombs near her island. The ship was not badly damaged, but flight operations had to be suspended. Air Group 652 claimed seven American aircraft shot down and four more probably shot down, but lost eleven Zeros, plus another three that had to <b>ditch.</b> <b>The</b> air group was disbanded on 10 July with many of its remaining personnel being assigned to Air Group 653.|$|E
5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 19th century the Glastonbury Canal {{drainage}} problems and competition from the new railways caused a decline in trade, and the town's economy became depressed. The canal was closed on 1 July 1854, and the lock and aqueducts on the upper section were dismantled. The railway opened on 17 August 1854. The lower sections of the canal were given to the Commissioners for Sewers, for use as a drainage <b>ditch.</b> <b>The</b> final section was retained to provide a wharf for the railway company, which was used until 1936, when it passed to the Commissioners of Sewers and was filled in. The Central Somerset Railway merged with the Dorset Central Railway to become the Somerset and Dorset Railway. The main line to Glastonbury closed in 1966.|$|E
5|$|In 1565, the Ottomans {{attacked}} {{again in}} the Great Siege of Malta. Fort Saint Elmo fell after fierce fighting (in which the Ottoman general Dragut Reis was killed), but the knights held out in Birgu and Senglea until a relief force arrived. By {{the end of the}} siege, most of the fortifications had been destroyed in the attacks, so they were rebuilt. The Grand Master, Jean Parisot de Valette, decided to build a new fortified capital on the Sciberras Peninsula. The first stone of the new city was laid down in 1566, and it was called Valletta. The city walls, which were constructed mainly in the 1560s and 1570s, remain largely intact to this day, and they include bastions, cavaliers, counterguards and a <b>ditch.</b> <b>The</b> ruined Fort Saint Elmo was rebuilt and integrated into the city walls. The area around St Elmo was strengthened a number of times later on in the 17th century, especially by the building of the Carafa Enceinte in 1687.|$|E

5|$|In Virginia, {{the storm}} {{produced}} a storm tide of 3.6feet (1.1m) above normal in Norfolk. Sustained winds peaked at 60mph (95km/h) in Langley Air Force Base, while gusts reached 71mph (114km/h) in Norfolk. The bands {{of the storm}} spawned an F1 tornado near Portsmouth and Chesapeake, damaging twelve homes and downing hundreds of trees. Damage from the tornado amounted to $250,000 (1971USD, $ USD). Rainfall from Doria was moderate, peaking at 6.44inches (164mm) at a location 2miles (3.2km) south-southeast of Halifax. One person drowned in Alexandria when she fell into a draining <b>ditch.</b> <b>The</b> storm severely damaged a large warehouse in Norfolk, as well. Damage in Virginia totaled $375,000 (1971USD, $ USD). Floodwaters from Doria clogged sewage systems near Norfolk, Virginia with sand and silt. This forced the sewage to be dumped into the Chesapeake Bay, resulting in the closure of several beaches for days.|$|E
5|$|The Tameside Archaeology Survey {{began in}} 1990, {{carried out by}} the University of Manchester Archaeology Unit with more than £500,000 of funding from Tameside Council; £300,000 of this was {{directed}} towards the excavations at Buckton Castle. A topographical survey and trial excavations were carried out in 1996 and 1998 to record the castle earthworks and examine the possible outer bailey. As a result, the possible outer bailey was revealed to be a 20th-century feature and was probably related to nearby mining activity. On two occasions (1999 and 2002) illegal digging by unknown parties necessitated remedial work and test pitting. In 2007 full-scale excavations at Buckton Castle began with the aim of establishing the date and history of the site. Across three seasons 2007, 2008, and 2010 trenches were opened across the <b>ditch,</b> <b>the</b> northern entrance, the gap in the circuit of earthworks on the south side, the interior, and the curtain wall.|$|E
5|$|The bailey was an {{enclosed}} courtyard overlooked by the motte {{and surrounded by}} a wooden fence called a palisade and another <b>ditch.</b> <b>The</b> bailey was often kidney-shaped to fit against a circular motte, but could be made in other shapes according to the terrain. The bailey would contain a wide number of buildings, including a hall, kitchens, a chapel, barracks, stores, stables, forges or workshops, and was {{the centre of the}} castle's economic activity. The bailey was linked to the motte either by a flying bridge stretching between the two, or, more popularly in England, by steps cut into the motte. Typically the ditch of the motte and the bailey joined, forming a figure of eight around the castle. Wherever possible, nearby streams and rivers would be dammed or diverted, creating water-filled moats, artificial lakes and other forms of water defences.|$|E
5|$|Antiquarians {{and historians}} have been {{interested}} in <b>the</b> <b>ditch</b> since <b>the</b> 19th century, but much of its course has been built over. Between 1990 and 1997, the University of Manchester Archaeological Unit excavated sections of <b>the</b> <b>ditch</b> in Denton, Reddish, Levenshulme and Platt Fields, in an attempt to determine its age and purpose. Although no date was established for <b>the</b> <b>ditch's</b> construction, <b>the</b> investigations revealed that the bank to the north of <b>the</b> <b>ditch</b> is of 20th century origin. Together with <b>the</b> <b>ditch's</b> profile, which is U-shaped rather than the V-shape typically used in military ditches and defences, this suggests {{that the purpose of the}} earthwork was to mark a territorial boundary. The conclusion of the project was that <b>the</b> <b>ditch</b> was probably a boundary marker.|$|R
