40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is remote <b>interpreting</b> (RI). Our {{objective}} has been to describe the current experience with this new kind of <b>interpreting,</b> the reasons for its application, {{the opinions of the}} interpreters and the impact of RI on their work and health. The paper is divided in two sections. In the theoretical part, we explained the term remote <b>interpreting</b> and its two meanings: (distance <b>interpreting</b> in general x simultaneous conference <b>interpreting</b> without direct view at the speaker). A short description of the various types of distance <b>interpreting</b> (telephone <b>interpreting,</b> <b>interpreting</b> for deafs and in media) and the modern ways of conferencing make a panorama of situations in which the distance <b>interpreting</b> is (or could be) used...|$|R

40|$|Whether and how language-pair {{specificity}} {{affects the}} process and product of <b>interpreting</b> is a recurring implicit topic of debate in <b>interpreting</b> studies. Previous discussions have touched upon this issue in Japanese/English and German/English <b>interpreting,</b> with little attention to its role in Chinese/English <b>interpreting.</b> This study focuses {{on the effect of}} structural asymmetry between English and Chinese on English-Chinese simultaneous <b>interpreting</b> performance, which is exemplified by right-branching structures in English and left-branching structures in Chinese. Based on a naturalistic observation of three professional interpreters’ on-site simultaneous interpretations of the same speech, it investigates two major questions: a) Does structural asymmetry between English and Chinese constitute particular difficulties in the interpreters’ <b>interpreting</b> performance? b) If yes, how does such language-pair specificity affect their <b>interpreting</b> product? While previous <b>interpreting</b> studies generally consider that the <b>interpreting</b> product is shaped by three major variables including the interpreter’s <b>interpreting</b> competence, cognitive conditions on the site and norms of <b>interpreting,</b> findings of the present study suggest that language-pair specificity functions as another variable in English-Chinese <b>interpreting.</b> It implies the necessity of considering it in the theoretical account of <b>interpreting</b> between languages such as English and Chinese that involve significant contrasts in linguistic structure and cultural conceptualization...|$|R
40|$|<b>Interpreting</b> is {{generally}} {{recognized as a}} particularly demanding language processing task for the cognitive system. Dependency distance, the linear distance between two syntactically related words in a sentence, is an index of sentence complexity and is also able to reflect the cognitive constraints during various tasks. In the current research, we examine the difference in dependency distance among three <b>interpreting</b> types, namely, simultaneous <b>interpreting,</b> consecutive <b>interpreting</b> and read-out translated speech based on a treebank comprising these types of <b>interpreting</b> output texts with dependency annotation. Results show that different <b>interpreting</b> renditions yield different dependency distances, and consecutive <b>interpreting</b> texts entail the smallest dependency distance other than those of simultaneous <b>interpreting</b> and read-out translated speech, suggesting that consecutive <b>interpreting</b> bears heavier cognitive demands than simultaneous <b>interpreting.</b> The current research suggests {{for the first time}} that <b>interpreting</b> is an extremely demanding cognitive task that can further mediate the dependency distance of output sentences. Such findings may be due to the minimization of dependency distance under cognitive constraints...|$|R
40|$|It {{is usually}} the case when {{describing}} the conference <b>interpreting</b> profession or the training for an <b>interpreting</b> degree, the discussion is overshadowed by commonly known aspects of translation practice.   The fact that non-linguistic traits or the interpreter’s aptitude primarily account for the overall performance of <b>interpreting</b> is still worth investigating in interpretation studies. Persona and cognitive abilities of the interpreter have occupied a considerable position {{in the literature of}} interpretation studies which often attempted to explore <b>interpreting</b> as a terra incognita. Some might even go to say that interpreters are born with an inherent aptitude to <b>interpret.</b> This study attempts to draw some distinctions between <b>interpreting</b> and translation. To achieve this end, the study focuses on non-linguistic traits of <b>interpreting</b> such as aptitude and cognitive abilities of the interpreters that cater for the specificities of the <b>interpreting</b> profession. The personal and cognitive skills arguably enable interpreters to perform the highly cognitively and communicatively demanding task of <b>interpreting.</b>   Keywords : <b>interpreting,</b> aptitude, cognitive abilities, <b>interpreting</b> skills</p...|$|R

5|$|In {{the first}} {{published}} {{discussion of the}} Trossingen Plateosaurus finds, Fraas suggested that only miring in mud allowed {{the preservation of the}} single complete skeleton then known. Similarly, Jaekel <b>interpreted</b> the Halberstadt finds as animals that waded too deep into swamps, became mired and drowned. He <b>interpreted</b> partial remains as having been transported into the deposit by water, and strongly refuted a catastrophic accumulation. In contrast, von Huene <b>interpreted</b> the sediment as aeolian deposits, with the weakest animals, mostly subadults, succumbing to the harsh conditions in the desert and sinking into the mud of ephemeral water holes. He argued that the completeness of many finds indicated that transport did not happen, and saw partial individuals and isolated bones as results of weathering and trampling. Seemann developed a different scenario, in which Plateosaurus herds congregated on large water holes, and some herd members got pushed in. Light animals managed to get free, while heavy individuals got stuck and died.|$|E
