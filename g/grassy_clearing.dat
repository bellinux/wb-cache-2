He cures her, and they go and find Livvy and her friend Ross Starr {{at the edge of a}} <b>grassy</b> <b>clearing.</b> Livvy tells Destiny and her father that she has been immortal since camp, and that she and Ross {{exchanged}} blood. Livvy and Ross change into blackbirds, and fly off into the black sky.|$|E
2500|$|After these turns, {{it begins}} a more {{pronounced}} {{climb up the}} side of the brook valley, heading more to the northeast. This levels out at about [...] when the road reaches Taylor Hollow, the low point between Hunter and East Rusk. An abandoned road continues north down the hollow to private property in the Schoharie Valley below. It is a wide, <b>grassy</b> <b>clearing,</b> and s are available for horses that wish to take a break.|$|E
2500|$|The {{summit of}} Kaaterskill High Peak is a small, viewless <b>grassy</b> <b>clearing</b> {{surrounded}} by boreal forest. A {{rock in the}} center holds a reference marker for two nearby United States Geological Survey benchmarks at the [...] elevation marking the highest point on the mountain; the bolts themselves are on rocks in the nearby woods (one is on the southern trail five feet from the peak, the other is about [...] to {{the south in the}} woods).|$|E
5000|$|Ilha da Queimada Grande has {{a variety}} of vegetation. The island is partly covered in {{rainforest}} and partly bare rock and <b>grassy</b> <b>cleared</b> areas, a result of deforestation. The deforestation is the origin of the island's name: the term “Queimada”, in Portuguese, means to slash and burn because when locals attempted to clear land for a banana plantation on the island, they had to clear rainforest using this technique. A lighthouse was constructed in 1909 to steer ships away from the island. The last human inhabitants left the island when the lighthouse was converted to being automated.|$|R
50|$|C. alboguttata {{lives in}} woodlands, <b>grassy</b> and <b>cleared</b> areas. It is usually only seen around {{temporary}} pools and water-filled claypans. The species is active {{by day and}} night. This frog is known {{to go through a}} period of torpor when resources are scant. University of Queensland researchers have discovered that their cell metabolism changes during a dormancy period, allowing the frogs to maximize the use of their limited energy resources without depleting them completely. This discovery could prove to have important medical applications, particularly regarding obesity.|$|R
50|$|The northwestern {{climbing}} salamander or northwestern mushroomtongue salamander (Bolitoglossa sima) is {{a species}} of salamander in the family Plethodontidae. It is endemic to Ecuador and found in the northwestern lowlands of the country at elevations below 1000 m asl. It has been recorded in dense wet forest and in a <b>grassy</b> field, <b>cleared</b> for cattle grazing, {{although it is not}} known whether it could adapt to human-altered habitats. Agriculture and logging are threats to its habitat. It has been found in the Cotacachi Cayapas Ecological Reserve.|$|R
2500|$|The {{tower is}} a [...] high steel frame Aermotor structure, {{anchored}} by bolts into the exposed bedrock, with a glazed steel cab on top reached by an eight-flight staircase. It {{is located in}} a <b>grassy</b> <b>clearing</b> of roughly , just east of the mountain's summit, along a narrow ridge. At the clearing's west end, {{the upper end of the}} trail and the mountain's true summit, is the rustic one-room cabin where observers lived during their shifts in the tower. Just to its north is a small wooden privy. Two picnic tables are in the area between the cabin and the tower.|$|E

60|$|Here {{he found}} a fair-sized space about a clear and {{plentiful}} spring of cold water. Only a few low bushes dotted the <b>grassy</b> <b>clearing</b> which was almost completely surrounded by dense and impenetrable jungle. The men had deposited their burdens, and still Theriere stood waiting for the balance of his party--Miller and Swenson with Barbara Harding.|$|E
50|$|It {{is located}} on a broad ridge {{extending}} northwards from Carnedd Llewelyn to Carnedd Gwenllian (formerly Garnedd Uchaf) and Foel-fras. An emergency refuge has been built beneath the summit. Compared to the surrounding mountains much deeper snow takes place due to its rather broad summit and high <b>grassy</b> slopes. On <b>clear</b> days the Isle of Man and even the Mourne Mountains in Northern Ireland {{can be seen from}} the summit.|$|R
50|$|The {{station was}} {{administratively}} accountable to Canadian Forces Air Defence Command, and its successor Fighter Group. In August 1984, Beaverlodge {{became part of}} the Canada West ROCC. The station carried on its assigned duties until operations ceased on 1 April 1988. Today, the facilities of the radar station have been removed, and the land is now a <b>cleared</b> <b>grassy</b> site with little or no evidence of its military past.|$|R
60|$|He {{came upon}} the second {{aeroplane}} in a <b>clear</b> <b>grassy</b> space {{by the side of}} the streaming water, and it seemed scarcely damaged at all. It looked as though it had floated down into a position of rest. It lay on its side with one wing in the air. There was no aeronaut near it, dead or alive. There it lay abandoned, with the water lapping about its long tail.|$|R
60|$|And then he unbound the fifty-nine honest men {{and took}} the ropes from their necks. As nightfall was fast {{approaching}} the new servants set to work to prepare a great feast in honor of their master.

6000|$|At South Bay we {{came upon}} a <b>grassy</b> <b>clearing</b> larger than usual, near a bright stream; its pottery and charred wood showed {{the site of the}} Spanish barracoon {{destroyed}} by the British in 1840. During the last seven years the [...] "patriarchal institution" [...] has become extinct, and the old slavers who have at times touched at the island, have left it empty-handed. Corisco had long been celebrated for cam-wood, a hard and ponderous growth, yielding a better red than Brazil or Braziletto, alias Brazilete (Brasilettia, De Cand.) one of the Eucæsalpinieæ, a congener of C. Echinata, which produces the Brazil-wood or Pernambuco-wood of commerce. In 1679, the Hollander Governor-General of Minas sent some forty whites to cultivate [...] "Indian wheat and other sort of corn and plants of Guinea." [...] The design was to supply the Dutch West Indian Company's ships with grain and vegetables, especially bananas, which grow admirably; I heard that there are fifteen varieties upon this dot of dry land. Thus the crews would not waste time and money at Cape Lopez and the Portuguese islands. The Dutch colonists began by setting up a factory in a turf redoubt, armed with iron guns, [...] "the better to secure themselves from any surprise or assault of the few natives, who are a sort of wild and mischievous blacks." [...] The plantation was successful, but the bad climate and noxious gases from the newly turned ground, combined with over-exertion, soon killed some seventeen out of the forty; and the remainder, who also suffered from malignant distempers, razed their buildings and returned to the Gold Coast. When the Crown of Spain once more took possession of Fernando Po, it appointed a Governor for Corisco, but no establishment was maintained there. To its credit be it said, there was not much interference with the Protestant mission; public preaching was forbidden pro formâ in 1860, but no notice was taken of [...] "passive resistance." ...|$|E
60|$|Well, {{he kept it}} up {{like that}} till he made their sides ache with laughing; which was quite natural, for {{certainly}} {{it was a very}} funny ideaat that timeI mean, the idea of that gentle little creature, that wouldn't hurt a fly, and couldn't bear the sight of blood, and was so girlish and shrinking in all ways, rushing into battle with a gang of soldiers at her back. Poor thing, she sat there confused and ashamed to be so laughed at; and yet at that very minute there was something about to happen which would change the aspect of things, and make those young people see {{that when it comes to}} laughing, the person that laughs last has the best chance. For just then a face which we all knew and all feared projected itself from behind the Fairy Tree, and the thought that shot through us all was, crazy Benoist has gotten loose from his cage, and we are as good as dead! This ragged and hairy and horrible creature glided out from behind the tree, and raised an ax as he came. We all broke and fled, this way and that, the girls screaming and crying. No, not all; all but Joan. She stood up and faced the man, and remained so. As we reached the wood that borders the <b>grassy</b> <b>clearing</b> and jumped into its shelter, two or three of us glanced back to see if Benoist was gaining on us, and that is what we sawJoan standing, and the maniac gliding stealthily toward her with his ax lifted. The sight was sickening. We stood where we were, trembling and not able to move. I did not want to see the murder done, and yet I could not take my eyes away. Now I saw Joan step forward to meet the man, though I believed my eyes must be deceiving me. Then I saw him stop. He threatened her with his ax, as if to warn her not to come further, but she paid no heed, but went steadily on, until she was right in front of himright under his ax. Then she stopped, and seemed to begin to talk with him. It made me sick, yes, giddy, and everything swam around me, and I could not see anything for a timewhether long or brief I do not know. When this passed and I looked again, Joan was walking by the man's side toward the village, holding him by his hand. The ax was in her other hand.|$|E
50|$|The Tasmanian nativehen is a {{secondary}} grazer, {{meaning that it}} depends on other species to keep grass swards low and with fresh shoots. Before European settlement in Tasmania, the cleared spaces required for feeding {{would probably have been}} provided by Indigenous burning of grasslands to provide feeding grounds for mammals, which would be hunted for food. The expansion of these <b>cleared</b> <b>grassy</b> areas, and the introduction of rabbits, has provided greater food sources and consequently greater numbers of the species within its range.|$|R
25|$|The {{original}} {{inhabitants of}} the area were the Pallittorre Clan of the Northern Nation of Aboriginal Tasmanians. The North Midlands Nation name for Quamby Bluff was lartitickitheker (lar.tit.ick.it.he.ker).There are caves south of Meander, in the Great Western Tiers, with deposits showing aboriginal habitation, though these have not been dated. The deposits were either left by the Pallittorre, or their neighbours the Luggermairrernerpairre {{who were part of}} the neighbouring Big River tribe. The Pallittorre probably inhabited the area for thousands of years; aborigines are believed to have lived in Tasmania for more than 30,000 years. They maintained <b>cleared</b> <b>grassy</b> plains by regular careful burning, and used this method also to control undergrowth in the forests. This land management technique enabled easier hunting and food gathering.|$|R
5|$|The Pallittorre's {{numbers have}} been {{estimated}} from as low as 50–60 to as high as 600. They maintained <b>cleared</b> <b>grassy</b> plains by regular careful burning, and used this method also to control undergrowth in the forests. This land management technique enabled easier hunting and food gathering. European colonists noted, after the Pallittorre had been eliminated from the area, how the forests rapidly reclaimed the formerly cleared land. They ranged across the land on a seasonal basis, {{at least as far}} as Mole Creek, and lived in villages of bark huts at times. They mined ochre in the Gog Range, trading this with other aborigines, across Tasmania. The Pallitorre congregated in areas in the Meander area, such as Jackeys Marsh - the name 'jackey' being a colloquial term for aboriginal people.|$|R
50|$|Calocybe carnea {{appears in}} spring, summer, and early autumn (usually after rain). It is {{frequent}} in Britain, Europe, Asia, and North America, growing in grassy meadows and fields and on lawns. It is very rarely found in woods, unless a <b>grassy</b> <b>clearing</b> is present. It seems to tolerate agricultural practices, because its fruiting bodies often appear on fertilized farmland.|$|E
50|$|Sometime in the 1960s, Hidden Beach came to prominence. At the time, {{the beach}} was only a small <b>grassy</b> <b>clearing</b> by the shore, led to by a deer path-sized trail. It {{eventually}} became a popular nude beach. The nearby rail yard brought many travelers and vagabonds to the area. Local {{legend has it that}} these transients helped create Hidden Beach by filling in the area with rocks.|$|E

60|$|Practically and commercially {{the former}} is worked by the Bristol barques and the latter commences at Cape Threepoints. The bold headland, a hundred feet tall and half a mile broad by a quarter long, bounded north by its river, has a base of black {{micaceous}} granite supporting red argillaceous loam. Everywhere beyond the burning of the billows the land-surface is tapestried with verdure and tufted with cocoas; they still show the traditional clump which gave the name recorded by Camoens. The neck attaching the head to the continent-body is a long, low sand-spit; and the background sweeps northward in the <b>clear</b> <b>grassy</b> stretches which African travellers agree to call 'parks.' These are fronted by screens of tall trees, and backed by the blue tops of little hills, a combination which strongly {{reminded me of the}} Gaboon.|$|R
2500|$|In 1934 the NGS and Air Corps co-sponsored the Explorer, a manned high-altitude balloon {{capable of}} stratospheric flight. After {{the crash of}} the Soviet Osoaviakhim-1 that {{nevertheless}} set an altitude record of , the sponsors redefined their primary objectives from record-setting to scientific research and tests of new navigation instruments. Air Corps Capt. Albert William Stevens, Capt. Orvil Arson Anderson and Maj. William E. Kepner were selected to fly the Explorer. Kepner and Anderson, experienced balloonists, were in charge of locating a suitable launch site. According to Kepner, an ideal site would be a crater or canyon, a <b>clear</b> <b>grassy</b> valley encircled with rocky ridges high enough to shield the tall balloon from any wind. Ideally, the launch site it would have a high-voltage electric line, road and rail access, [...] "and a trout stream". Kepner and Anderson eventually located their dream canyon near Rapid City, South Dakota. City officials, fascinated by the expected publicity campaign, agreed to build a road and electric line.|$|R
60|$|The general {{aspect of}} the region is prepossessing. It is a rolling surface sinking towards the Atlantic, in parts broken by hills and dwarf chains, either {{detached}} or pushed out by the Ghats; a land of short and abnormally broad rivers, which cannot, like the Congo, break through the ridges flanking the Central African basin, and which therefore are mere surface drains of the main ranges. The soil is mostly sandy, but a thin coat of rich vegetable humus, quickened by heavy rains and fiery suns, produces a luxuriant vegetation; whilst the proportion of area actually cultivated is nothing compared with the expanse of bush. In the tall forests, which abound in wild fruits, there are beautiful tracts of <b>clear</b> <b>grassy</b> land, and the woods, clear of undergrowth, resemble an English grove more than a tropical jungle. Horses, which die of the tsetse (Glossina morsitans) {{in the interior of}} North Guinea, and of damp heat at Fernando Po, thrive on its downs and savannahs. The Elais palm is rare, sufficing only for home use. The southern parts, about Cape Lopez and beyond it, resemble the Oil River country in the Biafran Bight: the land is a mass of mangrove swamps, and the climate is unfit for white men.|$|R

50|$|St John's Master's lodge {{is located}} in a <b>grassy</b> <b>clearing</b> to the north of Third Court. It was built {{at the same time as}} the new Chapel was being constructed, and has Tudor fittings, wainscot, portraits and other relics from the {{demolished}} north wing of First Court. It has a large garden, and in the winter its westmost rooms have excellent views of the college's old library, the River Cam, and the Bridge of Sighs. The architect was Sir George Gilbert Scott.|$|E
60|$|Nothing {{can be more}} picturesque than a band of voyageurs breakfasting on {{the banks}} of a pretty river. The spot they had chosen was a little above the Burntwood Creek, on a {{projecting}} <b>grassy</b> point, pretty <b>clear</b> of underwood. Each boat's crew--of which there were three--had a fire to itself, and over these fires were placed gipsy-like tripods, from which huge tin kettles depended; and above them hovered three volunteer cooks, who were employed stirring their contents with persevering industry. The curling wreaths of smoke formed a black cloud among the numerous fleecy ones in the blue sky, while all around, in every imaginable attitude, sat, stood, and reclined the sunburnt, savage-looking half-breeds, chatting, laughing, and smoking in perfect happiness. They were all dressed alike, in light cloth capotes with hoods, corduroy trousers, striped shirts open in front, with cotton kerchiefs tied sailor-fashion loosely round their swarthy necks. A scarlet worsted belt strapped each man's coat tightly to his body, and Indian moccasins defended their feet. Their head-dresses were as various as fanciful-- some wore caps of coarse cloth; others coloured handkerchiefs, twisted turban-fashion round their heads; and one or two, who might be looked upon as voyageur-fops, sported tall black hats, covered so plenteously with bullion tassels and feathers as to be scarcely recognisable.|$|R
25|$|Markhor are {{adapted to}} mountainous terrain, {{and can be}} found between 600 and 3,600 meters in elevation. They {{typically}} inhabit scrub forests made up primarily of oaks (Quercus ilex), pines (Pinus gerardiana), and junipers (Juniperus macropoda). They are diurnal, and are mainly active in the early morning and late afternoon. Their diets shift seasonally: {{in the spring and summer}} periods they graze, but turn to browsing in winter, sometimes standing on their hind legs to reach high branches. The mating season takes place in winter, during which the males fight each other by lunging, locking horns and attempting to push each other off balance. The gestation period lasts 135–170 days, and usually results in the birth of one or two kids, though rarely three. Markhor live in flocks, usually numbering nine animals, composed of adult females and their young. Adult males are largely solitary. Adult females and kids comprise most of the markhor population, with adult females making up 32% of the population and kids making up 31%. Adult males comprise 19%, while subadults (males aged 2–3 years) make up 12%, and yearlings (females aged 12–24 months) make up 9% of the population. Their alarm call closely resembles the bleating of domestic goats. Early in the season the males and females may be found together on the open <b>grassy</b> patches and <b>clear</b> slopes among the forest. During the summer, the males remain in the forest, while the females generally climb to the highest rocky ridges above.|$|R

50|$|At {{the peak}} of its of fame, the site could garner quite the {{gathering}} on the weekends. Drinking from the waters was a social event and guests hosted often large picnics in the <b>grassy</b> <b>clearing</b> just above the springs.

50|$|With {{the union}} of the two {{companies}} in 1821, the Lake Superior trade was diverted from Montreal to Hudson Bay via Michipicoten. This lasted until 1863, when the arrival of steamboats and railways made it unnecessary.
