25|$|Optical fibers are {{connected}} to terminal equipment by optical fiber connectors. These connectors are usually of a standard type such as FC, SC, ST, LC, MTRJ, MPO or SMA. Optical fibers may be connected to each other by connectors or by splicing, that is, joining two fibers {{together to form a}} continuous optical waveguide. The generally accepted splicing method is arc <b>fusion</b> <b>splicing,</b> which melts the fiber ends together with an electric arc. For quicker fastening jobs, a “mechanical splice” is used.|$|E
25|$|Silica can {{be drawn}} into fibers at {{reasonably}} high temperatures, and has a fairly broad glass transformation range. One other advantage is that <b>fusion</b> <b>splicing</b> and cleaving of silica fibers is relatively effective. Silica fiber also has high mechanical strength against both pulling and even bending, provided that the fiber is not too thick and that the surfaces have been well prepared during processing. Even simple cleaving (breaking) of {{the ends of the}} fiber can provide nicely flat surfaces with acceptable optical quality. Silica is also relatively chemically inert. In particular, it is not hygroscopic (does not absorb water).|$|E
25|$|It {{is often}} {{necessary}} to align an optical fiber with another optical fiber, or with an optoelectronic device {{such as a}} light-emitting diode, a laser diode, or a modulator. This can involve either carefully aligning the fiber and placing it {{in contact with the}} device, or can use a lens to allow coupling over an air gap. Typically the size of the fiber mode is much larger than the size of the mode in a laser diode or a silicon optical chip. In this case a tapered or lensed fiber is used to match the fiber mode field distribution to that of the other element. The lens {{on the end of the}} fiber can be formed using polishing, laser cutting or <b>fusion</b> <b>splicing.</b>|$|E
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the scheme {{for the study of}} the Bragg {{wavelength}} shift dependence on the applied tensile force. Samples of fiber Bragg gratings with different coatings have been studied: the restored acrylate coating, the heatshrinkable <b>fusion</b> <b>splice</b> protection sleeve without metal rod, the heat-shrinkable <b>fusion</b> <b>splice</b> protection sleeve with a metal rod, the metal capillary, polyvinylchloride tube. For different coatings of diffractive structure, dependences of wavelength shift for the Bragg grating resonance have been obtained on the tensile strength applied to the ends of an optical fiber. It was determined that the studied FBG coatings give the possibility to reduce the mechanical impact on the Bragg wavelength shift for 1. 1 - 15 times as compared to an uncoated waveguide. The most effective version of coated fiber Bragg grating is the heatshrinkable <b>fusion</b> <b>splice</b> protection sleeve with a metal rod. When the force (equal to 6 N) is applied to the 100 mm optical fiber area with the inscribed diffractive structure, the Bragg wavelength shift is 7. 5 nm for the unprotected sample and 0. 5 nm for the one coated with the heat-shrinkable <b>fusion</b> <b>splice</b> protection sleeve...|$|R
50|$|Current fusion splicers {{are either}} core or {{cladding}} alignment. Using {{one of these}} methods the two cleaved fibers are automatically aligned by the <b>fusion</b> <b>splicer</b> in the x,y,z plane, then are fused together. Prior to {{the removal of the}} spliced fiber from the <b>fusion</b> <b>splicer,</b> a proof-test is performed to ensure that the splice is strong enough to survive handling, packaging and extended use. The bare fiber area is protected either by recoating or with a splice protector. A splice protector is a heat shrinkable tube with a strength membrane and less loss.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we report the {{fabrication}} of periodically tapered Long Period Fiber Grating (LPFG) in standard single-mode telecommunication fiber using electric arc from a <b>fusion</b> <b>splicer.</b> The {{ability of the}} <b>fusion</b> <b>splicer</b> to precisely taper the fiber is effectively utilized for producing periodic tapers in the fiber. The antisymmetric resonant mode of the fabricated LPFG is utilized as a refractive index transducer to measure the ethanol concentration in ethanol-gasoline blends. The work carried out shows that compared with the normal arc induced LPFG, the periodically tapered one shows better refractive index sensitivity. ...|$|R
25|$|<b>Fusion</b> <b>splicing</b> is {{done with}} a {{specialized}} instrument. The fiber ends are first stripped of their protective polymer coating (as well as the more sturdy outer jacket, if present). The ends are cleaved (cut) with a precision cleaver to make them perpendicular, and are placed into special holders in the fusion splicer. The splice is usually inspected via a magnified viewing screen to check the cleaves {{before and after the}} splice. The splicer uses small motors to align the end faces together, and emits a small spark between electrodes at the gap to burn off dust and moisture. Then the splicer generates a larger spark that raises the temperature above the melting point of the glass, fusing the ends together permanently. The location and energy of the spark is carefully controlled so that the molten core and cladding do not mix, and this minimizes optical loss. A splice loss estimate is measured by the splicer, by directing light through the cladding on one side and measuring the light leaking from the cladding on the other side. A splice loss under 0.1dB is typical. The complexity of this process makes fiber splicing much more difficult than splicing copper wire.|$|E
50|$|Alternatives to <b>fusion</b> <b>splicing</b> include using {{optical fiber}} {{connectors}} or mechanical splices {{both of which}} have higher insertion losses, lower reliability and higher return losses than <b>fusion</b> <b>splicing.</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{promising}} {{technology for}} fabricating chiral long-period gratings (CLPGs) is demonstrated using a commercial <b>fusion</b> <b>splicer.</b> The key {{aspect of this}} technology is the incorporation of a fully automatic program we designed for the <b>fusion</b> <b>splicer.</b> High-quality CLPGs are successfully fabricated from single-mode fibers, which have very flat surfaces and low insertion loss. We also investigate the tuning characteristics of the transmission spectrum with the mechanical twist rate in CLPGs for torsion sensing application. The torsion sensitivity is improved and the shift in resonance wavelength versus the mechanical twist rate shows an almost perfect linear relationship. In addition, by choosing appropriate fabrication parameters, the fabricated CLPGs {{can be used as}} tunable single-band-rejection filters in a broad wavelength range.

40|$|Abstract. A {{hollow core}} fiber based all-fiber {{intermodal}} interferometer is proposed for measurement of strain and temperature. The sensing structure {{is simply a}} short segment of hollow core silica fiber being spliced between two normal single mode fibers. The fabrication process only involves a conventional <b>fusion</b> <b>splicer</b> and a mechanical fiber cleaver.

50|$|Stripping is {{the act of}} {{removing}} the protective polymer coating around optical fiber in preparation for <b>fusion</b> <b>splicing.</b> The splicing process begins by preparing both fiber ends for fusion, which requires that all protective coating is removed or stripped from the ends of each fiber.|$|E
50|$|The {{company has}} its {{origin in the}} {{telecommunications}} industry and was founded in 1987 by Uwe Böttcher, {{the former head of}} <b>Fusion</b> <b>Splicing</b> Development and Production at LM Ericsson Fiber Optics in Stockholm. Nyfors first commercial product was an optical fiber recoater launched in 1988.|$|E
50|$|The basic <b>fusion</b> <b>splicing</b> {{apparatus}} {{consists of}} two fixtures on which the fibers are mounted and two electrodes. These fixtures are often called sheath clamps. Inspection microscope assists in {{the placement of the}} prepared fiber ends into a fusion-splicing apparatus. The fibers are placed into the apparatus, aligned, and then fused together. Initially, <b>fusion</b> <b>splicing</b> used nichrome wire as the heating element to melt or fuse fibers together. New fusion-splicing techniques have replaced the nichrome wire with carbon dioxide (CO2) lasers, electric arcs, or gas flames to heat the fiber ends, causing them to fuse together. The small size of the fusion splice and the development of automated fusion-splicing machines have made electric arc fusion (arc fusion) {{one of the most popular}} splicing techniques in commercial applications.|$|E
50|$|Recoated splices {{can usually}} be coiled into a tight radius because the recoated fiber section is just as {{flexible}} as the original polymer coating. Recoats are e.g. employed in the assembly of undersea optical fiber cables where high <b>fusion</b> <b>splice</b> strength is already necessitated by stringent reliability requirements. Another reason optical fiber recoating is attractive in submarine communications cabling is that the cross section of recoated fibers matches that of the original fiber.|$|R
25|$|Mechanical fiber splices are {{designed}} to be quicker and easier to install, but there is still the need for stripping, careful cleaning and precision cleaving. The fiber ends are aligned and held together by a precision-made sleeve, often using a clear index-matching gel that enhances the transmission of light across the joint. Such joints typically have higher optical loss and are less robust than <b>fusion</b> <b>splices,</b> especially if the gel is used.

50|$|Stripping is {{the act of}} {{removing}} the protective polymer coating around optical fiber in preparation for <b>fusion</b> <b>splicing.</b> The splicing process begins by preparing both fiber ends for fusion, which requires that all protective coating is removed or stripped from the ends of each fiber. Fiber optical stripping can be done using a special stripping and preparation unit that uses hot sulphuric acid or a controlled flow of hot air to remove the coating. There are also mechanical tools used for stripping fiber which are similar to copper wire strippers. Fiber optical stripping and preparation equipment used in <b>fusion</b> <b>splicing</b> is commercially available through {{a small number of}} specialized companies, which usually also design machines used for fiber optical recoating.|$|E
50|$|Nyfors Teknologi AB is a {{high-end}} supplier of advanced optical fiber handling equipment, based in Stockholm, Sweden.

50|$|Optical fiber {{recoating}} is {{the process}} of restoring the primary coating to stripped optical fiber sections after <b>fusion</b> <b>splicing.</b> The polymer comprising the recoat is usually similar in composition to the original fiber polymer coating. Nyfors optical fiber recoaters are designed to restore the primary coating on spliced optical fibers with acrylate coatings. Due to the mould design, the restored part of the coating has a diameter and other properties, such as eccentricity and roundness, that are almost identical to the original fiber.|$|E

50|$|The fiber is then cleaved {{using the}} score-and-break method {{so that its}} end-face is {{perfectly}} flat and perpendicular to the axis of the fiber. The quality of each fiber end is inspected using a microscope. In <b>fusion</b> <b>splicing,</b> splice loss is a direct function of the angles {{and quality of the}} two fiber-end faces. The closer to 90 degrees the cleave angle is the lower optical loss the splice will yield. The quality of the cleave tool being used is critical.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{most other}} types of lasers, the laser cavity in fiber lasers is {{constructed}} monolithically by <b>fusion</b> <b>splicing</b> different types of fiber; fiber Bragg gratings replace conventional dielectric mirrors to provide optical feedback. Another type is the single longitudinal mode operation of ultra narrow distributed feedback lasers (DFB) where a phase-shifted Bragg grating overlaps the gain medium.

The goal is to fuse the two fibers together {{in such a way}} that light passing through the fibers is not scattered or reflected back by the splice, and so that the splice and the region surrounding it are almost as strong as the virgin fiber itself. The source of heat is usually an electric arc, but can also be a laser, or a gas flame, or a tungsten filament through which current is passed.|$|E
