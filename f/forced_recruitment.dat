25|$|In 1999, ILO {{helped lead}} the Worst Forms Convention 182 (C182), which {{has so far been}} signed upon and {{domestically}} ratified by 151 countries including the United States. This international law prohibits worst forms of child labour, defined as all forms of slavery and slavery-like practices, such as child trafficking, debt bondage, and forced labour, including <b>forced</b> <b>recruitment</b> of children into armed conflict. The law also prohibits the use of a child for prostitution or the production of pornography, child labour in illicit activities such as drug production and trafficking; and in hazardous work. Both the Worst Forms Convention (C182) and the Minimum Age Convention (C138) are examples of international labour standards implemented through the ILO that deal with child labour.|$|E
25|$|Poor Allied co-operation, {{tactical}} {{disputes and}} command rivalries ensured the Allies made little progress in 1705 {{on either the}} Meuse or the Moselle; {{there was also a}} setback in occupied Bavaria where the Emperor's heavy taxation and <b>forced</b> <b>recruitment</b> led to a brief peasant revolt. Nevertheless, in 1706 the Allies would at last make the breakthrough in the Low Countries when, on 23 May, Marlborough defeated Villeroi and the Elector of Bavaria at the Battle of Ramillies north of Namur. Each side fielded some 60,000 men, but it was the English general, taking advantage of his opponent’s weak disposition, who won a decisive victory. A two-week pursuit of their shattered opponents quickly secured a number of ill-defended towns, including Brussels, Ghent, Bruges, and Antwerp; a second campaigning phase required the application of more substantial siegeworks, but the Allies eventually captured Ostend, Menen (thereby breaching the first line of Vauban's pré carré), Dendermonde, and Ath. The Spanish Netherlands was re-established as the buffer zone between France and the Dutch Republic, and the territory became an Anglo-Dutch condominium {{for the duration of the}} war, governed in the name of Charles III but in accordance with the directives from the Maritime Powers. For their part, the Franco-Bavarian army fell back to a new defensive line running between Ypres and Namur, via Lille, Tournai, Condé, Mons, and Charleroi.|$|E

2500|$|There {{was also}} a marked change in how the LRA {{perceived}} the conflict. [...] Having become convinced that the Acholi were now collaborating with the Museveni government, Kony began to target the civilians using his increased military strength. [...] Mutilations such as those {{carried out in the}} wake of the Arrow Group strategy became commonplace, and 1994 saw the first mass forced abduction of children and young people. Other militant groups, such as the West Nile Bank Front, adopted the LRA tactics of abductions and raids. The strategy of <b>forced</b> <b>recruitment</b> was prompted by the lack of new volunteers to continue the conflict, and the fact that the young could be indoctrinated to support the LRA much more easily than adults.|$|E
2500|$|On November 18, a draft {{resolution}} spearheaded by the French Foreign Ministry was presented before the United Nations Security Council. The resolution, signed by 44 different organizations {{and with the}} backing of the British Foreign Office minister Mark Malloch Brown, asked the UN to send 3,000 more peacekeepers to reinforce the 17,000-strong garrison in the Congo, which is the largest garrison of its kind. This was similar to the pleas of the Human Rights Watch and humanitarian aid groups in the region, who were also asking for reinforcements to bring stability to the area. In a shared statement, the coalition of organizations stated that [...] " [...] would help to prevent the atrocities that continue to be committed against civilians on an ever greater scale here in North Kivu , on the border of Rwanda and Uganda... Since August 28, fighting has intensified in many areas, causing deaths, rapes, lootings, <b>forced</b> <b>recruitment</b> and further displacements of civilian populations. The population has thus been immersed in unspeakable suffering. In the last few days, fighting has drawn closer to large populated areas, such as the town of Goma. Fighting has also invaded and torn apart the region of Rutshuru, particularly in the town of Kiwanja, where hundreds of civilian deaths have now been recorded." [...] Local groups in the Congo also requested help from the European Union, as {{they would be able to}} deploy soldiers sooner, working as a [...] "bridging force" [...] until the UN reinforcements arrived. British EU spokeswoman Catriona Little stated that they were [...] "not ruling in or out EU forces".|$|E
2500|$|Until {{the end of}} May 1944, SHEAF had a [...] "Block Planning" [...] {{policy for}} the Resistance under which the Resistance would lie low until Operation Overlord was {{launched}} and then afterwards, the Resistance was to launch a full blown guerilla war {{in all of the}} French provinces one by one. At the end of May 1944, Eisenhower changed his plans and instead wanted a nationwide guerilla war launched in all of the regions of France with the start of Overlord. The SOE had informed the Resistance leaders to listen to the BBC's [...] "personal messages" [...] French language broadcasts on the 1st, 2nd, 15th and 16th of every month for the messages telling them when Overlord was due to start. If the phrase [...] "l'heure des combats viendra" [...] ("the hour battle will come"), which was broadcast on 1 June 1944, that was the signal that the Allies would land within the next 15 days. If a line from a poem by Verlaine [...] "Les sanglot longs de l'automne" [...] ("The long sobs of autumn") was read on the BBC, that was the signal that the invasion was imminent and if the following line [...] "bercent mon Coeur d'une langueur monotone" [...] (wound my heart with a monotonous languor"), which was broadcast on 5 June 1944, then the invasion would occur the next day. In the spring of 1944, a number of uniformed American, French and British soldiers known as the [...] "Jedburgh" [...] teams as part of Operation Jedburgh were landed in France to make contact with the maquis guerillas. A Jedburgh team was a three men crew consisting of a commander, his deputy and a radio operator and one of the [...] "Jeds" [...] was always French with the other two being either British or American whose job was to maintain radio contact with Britain, to provide professional military training to the maquis and {{in the words of the}} British historian Terry Crowdy to [...] "tactfully" [...] give professional military leadership. One [...] "Jed", the British officer Tommy Macpherson observed that the FTP used rough methods to motivate people, writing: [...] "The leader of the FTP in the Department of Lot was a very strong character who went under the name of Commissar Georges. He actually held indoctrination classes as well as his military operations and exercised a degree of almost <b>forced</b> <b>recruitment</b> among the young people of the area, threatening their families.

40|$|The human {{orofacial}} {{system is}} richly endowed with low threshold, slowly adapting mechanoreceptors that respond to self-generated movements and external loads. The functional linkage between these afferents and {{the recruitment of}} motor units in the lower face during the dynamics of speech is unknown. Mechanically evoked activity in the orbicularis oris muscles was studied in young human female adults (N= 10) during a lip <b>force</b> <b>recruitment</b> task associated with the repetition of the nonsense speech utterance “ah-wah. ” This speech task involved the recruitment of perioral motor units against an elastic load. A skin contactor probe coupled to a servo-controlled linear motor delivered punctate ipsilateral mechanical inputs (25 ms duration, 1800 μm displacement) to the glabrous surface of the upper lip in order to index the modulation and specificity of the compound trigeminofacial response {{as a function of}} speech <b>force</b> <b>recruitment</b> threshold (Ft). Modulation of the early (Ft = 0. 2 N) and later (Ft = 1. 0 N) components of the evoked perioral response was found at the two force thresholds. Beginning at approximately 60 ms post-stimulus, a significant suppression response was found among lower lip EMG recording sites and its magnitude was greatest when the mechanical perturbation occurred during the early phase of lip <b>force</b> <b>recruitment.</b> Variation in the lip force trajectories was manifest by a greater difference in net interangle force associated with lip perturbations indexed to the early Ft. This was interpreted to reflect the operation of a feedforward mechanism which may play a more significant role during an evolving speech action. Thus, the application of servo-controlled mechanosensory inputs effectively indexed the excitability of the facial motor nucleus during production of a simple speech phrase. Future studies are needed to explore mechanisms of short-term adaptation and trigeminofacial modulation during propositional speech in health and disease...|$|R
