Simple neoclassical open economy models predict that capital will flow to regions/countries with relatively high output growth. This prediction is confirmed for regions within European countries but the magnitude is smaller than predicted. We find no association between capital flows and growth for the European countries except for Ireland. Net capital flows between regions are large in northern Europe but very small in Italy and Spain. This difference partly explained by the industrial structure and partly by taxes and transfers. Overall {{the results suggest that}} capital markets are integrated among European regions–though to a lesser extent than the U. S. states— and not integrated at all across European countries...|$|R

The <b>income</b> <b>flows</b> from the State include public sector workers' earnings, Social Security pensions, unemployment benefits, and Social Assistance transfers. The <b>income</b> <b>flows</b> to the State comprise direct taxes and employees' social security contributions. Data come from the Brazilian POF 2008 – 09. We do not measure indirect contributions to inequality of subsidies granted to and taxation of companies, nor the in-kind provision of goods and services. The results indicate that the State contributes to a large share of family per capita income inequality. Incomes associated with work in the public sector—wages and pensions—are concentrated and regressive. Components related to the private sector are also concentrated, but progressive. Contrary to what has been found in European countries, public spending associated with work and social policies is concentrated in an elite group of workers and, taken as a whole, tends to increase income inequality. Redistributive mechanisms that could reverse this inequality, such as taxes and social assistance, are very progressive but proportionally small.

50|$|Under the Irish Church Act 1869, {{taking effect}} on the 1st January 1871, the Church of Ireland {{ceased to be a}} State Church, and much of its property, aside from actual {{religious}} buildings (so, for example, rectories and their lands), passed to the State. In the case of Raheny Parish, this meant that an <b>income</b> <b>flow</b> of around 400 Irish pounds dropped to one of around 40, not really enough to support a rector, never mind to replace or buy the former rectory. In addition, Raheny's Church of Ireland population was falling, and active parishioners becoming scarcer, with perhaps 8 or 9 at General Vestry meetings. As a further effect of reorganisation following disestablishment, the system by which clergy were nominated by the Crown or various private or Church bodies ceased, and a Board of Nomination had to be created in each parish.|$|E
5000|$|This {{approach}} has been criticized by advocates of modern portfolio theory (MPT) and the closely related doctrine of the efficient-market hypothesis (EMH) most closely associated with Eugene Fama (Fama, 1970). These theories argue that if a stock or asset is selling at {{what appears to be}} a “distress value” compared to some estimate of its true value based on its current income flows, then the market has information about the expected future of the company or asset that is not reflected in its current <b>income</b> <b>flow.</b> In this regard, investors such as Buffett who have successfully used the Graham approach should expect to spend extra resources to have better information about the companies or assets they purchase compared to most agents in the market. A study that shows that the Graham approach may well do better than various other alternatives (such as the “three-factor theory” that Fama and French, 1996, have argued performs better than the EMH), is Xiao and Arnold (2008).|$|E
50|$|Women's {{access to}} food is closely {{connected}} to households' food access {{because they are}} typically responsible for food supply in households. Women can gain the access to food through producing it for their own consumption or purchasing it with income. Income is either generated from market activity or granted by redistributive mechanisms {{in the form of}} government's social protection measure or community's solidarity. Many studies conducted during the 1980s suggest that women typically spend a higher portion of their income on food and health care for children than men do. For example, a study in Côte d'Ivoire found that for men, it needs eleven times bigger income of women to improve children's nutrition to the same level at which women achieve. Another study demonstrated that poorer women-headed households often succeed in providing more nutritional food for their children than men-headed households. Studies explain such difference in income spending between men and women with several hypothesis. One of them is that societal and cultural norms may impose on women the role of ensuring adequate share of food among household members. When a study interviewed people living near Lake Victoria, women typically considered their children as the first or second greatest expenditure, while men did not view them as a cost. Another hypothesis is that women may prefer to spend more on children's daily needs as they share more time with them. The other hypothesis is that different <b>income</b> <b>flow</b> of women from men causes different transaction costs. According to a study, men typically contribute to large and one-off payments while women spend for daily household expenditure.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{determinants}} of net capital <b>income</b> <b>flows</b> within the United States. We analyze a simple multi-state neoclassical model in which total factor productivity varies across states and over time and capital flows freely across state borders. The model predicts that capital will flow to states with relatively high output growth. Since relative growth patterns are persistent such states are also high output states, which implies that high output will be associated with inflows of capital and net outflows of capital income. Our empirical findings correspond well to the predictions of the model and indicate persistent net capital <b>income</b> <b>flows</b> and net cross- state investment positions between states which are {{an order of magnitude}} larger than observed capital <b>income</b> <b>flows</b> between countries. Thus, our results imply that frictions associated with national borders are likely to be the main explanation for "low" international capital flows. capital flows, ownership, net factor income, historical income...|$|R

Unlike earlier {{studies that have}} {{found it difficult to}} document a consistent effect of financial globalization on international consumption comovements, we make use of the information implicit in the relative levels of consumption and output to measure long-run risk sharing among OECD countries and US federal states. nWe derive our empirical setup from a deliberately simplistic model in which countries can trade perpetual claims to each other's output (Shiller securi-nties). Our framework allows us to distinguish between two channels of risk sharing: ex ante diversification that leads to income smoothing through cap-nital <b>income</b> <b>flows</b> and ex-post consumption smoothing through savings and dissavings. The model successfully replicates the patterns of income andnconsumption smoothing observed in both U. S. state-level and international data. The increase in international consumption risk sharing is closely associated with the decline in international portfolio home bias. While capital <b>income</b> <b>flows</b> remain relatively limited as a channel of risk sharing at businessncycle frequencies, we find that better international portfolio diversification has led to a considerable increase in capital <b>income</b> <b>flows</b> at medium and long horizons...|$|R
