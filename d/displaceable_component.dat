30|$|Nicotine, {{because of}} its high {{affinity}} to α 4 β 2 receptors, exhibited competition with 18 F-nifene. Previous in vitro studies using 10 nM of nicotine displaced 60 - 65 % in the thalamus region and 300 μM of nicotine, 95 % elimination {{is seen in the}} thalamus [2]. As expected, displacement of 18 F-nifene binding was seen in the post-nicotine challenge similar to that reported for 2 -[18 F]F-A- 85380 [17]. Figure 6 clearly shows a drop in binding at the time of nicotine injection (30 min into the scan), displacing at least > 80 % of 18 F-nifene binding. The ability for nicotine to compete with 18 F-nifene can be used to detect changes in receptor occupancy suggesting PET to be a valuable tool in assessing tobacco-related dependence [13]. Pre-nicotine challenges at different dose levels of nicotine, demonstrated a steady decrease in 18 F-nifene occupancy with respect to nicotine. At low doses of nicotine, 0.02 mg/kg, > 40 % of receptors were occupied while at high doses (0.5 mg/kg) > 80 % receptors were occupied with nicotine (Table 3). While the cerebellum was used as a reference region, some issues have risen questioning the validity of the cerebellum as a reference region. With the presence of nicotinic receptors in the rat cerebellum [17 – 19], measurement of binding potential can be complex. Studies using 2 -[18 F]F-A- 85380 in rodents have reported nicotine <b>displaceable</b> <b>component</b> in the cerebellum [17], suggesting a need for arterial input function for accurate quantification.|$|E
