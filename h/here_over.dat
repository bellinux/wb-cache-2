Stravinsky later explained to Nikolai Findeyzen, the editor of the Russian Musical Gazette, that {{the first part of the}} work would be called [...] "The Kiss of the Earth", and would consist of games and ritual dances interrupted by a procession of sages, culminating in a frenzied dance as the people embraced the spring. Part Two, [...] "The Sacrifice", would have a darker aspect; secret night games of maidens, leading to the choice of one for sacrifice and her eventual dance to the death before the sages. The original working title was changed to [...] "Holy Spring" [...] (Russian: [...] Vesna sviashchennaia), but the work became generally known by the French translation Le Sacre du printemps, or its English equivalent The Rite of Spring, with the subtitle [...] "Pictures of Pagan Russia".|$|E

[...] Myles McNutt from The A.V. Club awarded the episode a B+ rating and wrote positively of the trivia plot, saying, [...] "When The Office reaches its next hiatus, and then its subsequent return, I’ll find myself hoping for more like the trivia side of 'Trivia', storylines that even after contrived introductions can simply sit back and let the character-driven jokes take over the narrative." [...] Chris Plante from New York magazine explained that [...] "If you plan to continue watching The Office, here’s my advice ... You need to forget the negative energy this show attracts. Start thinking of Season Eight like a reboot." [...] He concluded that [...] "The Office is not irreparable.

[...] Alan Sepinwall from HitFix, who was notably critical of the new season, called the episode [...] "charming." [...] IGN reviewer Cindy White noted that the episode bore stylistic similarities to the third episode of the British version of the show, entitled [...] "The Quiz", writing that [...] "while 'Trivia' does loosely allude to that pub quiz with a bar trivia night, that turns out to be the only thing the two have in common."
