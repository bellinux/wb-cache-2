A study of how the anodization rate depends on current at various orientations demonstrated that, on the whole, the macroscopic anisotropy with respect to the dominating rate along the < 100 [*]>[*]direction becomes weaker with increasing current density, and the relative rates for different directions change places.

The experiments are carried out by low energy electron microscopy on Au-Si and Au-Ge, which are model systems for studying liquid droplet alloys. Studying in-situ the behaviour of Au droplets on various Si and Ge surfaces, we describe a subtle interplay between the substrate orientation, the surface defects, and the droplet motion.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{cryogenic}} deep {{reactive ion etching}} (DRIE) and presents {{how it can be}} applied to the fabrication of silicon micro- and nanostructures that have applications in microfluidics and micromechanics. The cryogenic DRIE process relies on inductively coupled SF 6 /O 2 plasma at temperatures below - 100 °C. Low etching temperatures can cause some photoresist materials to crack, but Al 2 O 3 has been shown to be a very well-suited masking material for cryogenic <b>etching.</b> The <b>anisotropy</b> of the <b>etching</b> process is enhanced by a thin passivation layer on sidewalls that prevents lateral etching. The main parameters that are used to adjust the thickness of the passivation layer are the process temperature and the O 2 flow. Under adequate conditions vertical sidewalls are obtained, whereas passivation layers that are too thin result in negatively tapered sidewall slopes. Under conditions where a passivation layer is not formed, at higher temperatures and/or without oxygen flow, the etching profiles are isotropic. On the other hand, too high oxygen flow results in over passivation. Under conditions where the sidewall is slightly over passivated, its slopes are positively tapered, while more pronounced over passivation results in the formation of black silicon (or silicon nanograss, silicon nanoturf or columnar microstructures). Typically, vertical sidewall profiles are desirable. However, this thesis shall also demonstrate the usefulness of under and over passivation regimes. Here, highly anisotropic etching conditions are utilized to create trenches with vertical sidewalls, fluidic channels with regular micropillar arrays, and high aspect ratio silicon nanopillars. An isotropic etching process is utilized during the release of aluminum heaters fabricated on top of perforated free-standing Al 2 O 3 membranes and silicon dioxide coated thermal silicon actuators. The fabrication process of three-dimensional sharp electrospray ionization (ESI) tips takes advantage of etching conditions that result in negatively tapered sidewalls. A self-feeding ESI interface for mass spectrometry (MS) is fabricated by combining a lidless micropillar filled channel with a sharp tip. Two approaches to the fabrication of silicon nanopillars are presented, both of which are suitable for wafer-scale manufacturing. One method combines silica nanoparticles with a highly anisotropic DRIE step, while the other method relies on highly over passivating conditions in a maskless DRIE process. Due to a large surface area and efficient light absorption in UV-range, silicon nanopillar structured surfaces are utilized as sample plates in laser desorption/ionization (LDI) MS. The wetting of nanopillar structured silicon surfaces is also studied. Fluoropolymer coated nanopillar structured surfaces have a contact angle of more than 170 ° and are ultrahydrophobic, whereas oxidized nanostructured surfaces are completely wetting. The accurate patterning of both completely wetting and ultrahydrophobic areas side by side allows complex droplet shapes and droplet splitters to be tailored...|$|R
40|$|Extensive work {{continues}} {{to be carried out}} on correlating the electric characteristics of parallel-plate discharges with an equivalent model. Theoretical models have been developed for capacitive radio frequency driven plasmas. Voltage, current and phase measurements of radio frequency discharges have been used to gain empirical data {{of a wide range of}} discharge parameters. It has been found that parasitic impedances within a plasma chamber have a substantial effect on impedance measurements of plasmas. This means that simple a priori models are inadequate for understanding plasmas. Complicated experimental setups have been used to better understand the propagation of radio frequency electromagnetic radiation through plasmas/plasma chambers. These however can not be transferred to a manufacturing environment due to non uniformity issues across a given wafer. The effect of the plasma chamber setup on plasma characteristics has been demonstrated. Although plasma processes are widely used in industry, the general understanding of these processes is poor and process control is difficult. The ability to etch fine lines and the control of <b>anisotropy,</b> <b>etching</b> rate, uniformity, selectivity and end point detection are obtained by experimental trial and error. This thesis describes a method of characterising the condition of a radio or microwave frequency excited plasma etching or deposition system as would be used in the semiconductor industry. This process can be used for: (i) monitoring the state of a system as it ages to detect when cleaning or repair is required (ii) checking that the characteristics of the system are as expected after manufacture, rebuild or modification. The location of any defects may be detected by simulating the frequency response of the altered system to see which electrical component values have changed. These can then be related to the physical components of the system. This characterisation can be integrated into the normal process flow; when the plasma is not powered up e. g., during pump down or loading for example, the network analyser can be switched in and the measurements made. In this way, the system can be characterised on a “real-time” basis...|$|R

The effect of potential has been investigated in the transition region between macropore formation and electropolishing. Upon increasing the anodization potential, the pore cross-section changes from circular to square shape, and {{the bottom of the}} pores changes from a rounded to a V-shaped profile. Prolonged etching of the contour of (1 1 0) p-Si disks in the regime of porous silicon formation allows for a comparison of the etching characteristics of the (1 ¯ 1 x) orientations.

40|$|Graphene {{has been}} {{considered}} to be an intriguing playground for novel physics, especially since its isolation ten years ago. For the investigation of the predicted properties of graphene, however, clean samples with crystallographically defined edges are of crucial importance. Here, we explore the interaction of graphite and graphene on SiO 2 and hBN substrates with hydrogen ions and radicals in two different pressure regimes, searching for a reliable fabrication method for zigzag edged graphene nanoribbons. The samples are prepared by exfoliating graphite and depositing graphitic material on the substrate of interest. Subsequently the samples are exposed to the plasma at various gas pressures and sample-plasma distances. Exposing graphite flakes to a pure hydrogen plasma at pressures around 0. 03 mbar, leads to the intercalations of hydrogen atoms in between the top graphite layers where the atoms recombine to hydrogen molecules. This process is reversible as the gas molecules can be released from within the substrate when the samples are heated to elevated temperatures. In this regime a partial hydrogenation of the graphite and graphene surfaces is measured and indicates the formation of graphane. Its band structure is expected to be gapped, opening the way for atomically thin devices employable in electronic industry. Increasing the gas pressure of the plasma to 0. 4 - 1. 7 mbar, the graphitic samples are etched by hydrogen radicals at intrinsic or predefined defects, evolving into hexagonally shaped holes, indicating an anisotropic <b>etching</b> process. The <b>anisotropy</b> of the <b>etching</b> process is, however, strongly dependent on the substrate and the amount of graphite layers exposed. The edges of the hexagons are expected to be of zigzag type and can be employed to fabricate graphene nanoribbons with well define edges. Zigzag graphene nanoribbons were predicted to have magnetic edge states and a band gap, opening the possibility of investigating spin filter devices in graphene structures. Stimulated by the unanswered question of strongly differing c-axis resistivities (rho_c) of natural and highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG), transport experiments, following older investigation are pursued. Reducing the sample height of natural graphitic flakes to micrometer sized samples, noticeably enlarges its rho_c, approaching it to the measured HOPG values. A recent theory unveils the discrepancy in rho_c of natural graphite and HOPG, linking the density of bulk disorder with the value of rho_c. The measurement result of the micrometer sized natural graphitic samples with increased rho_c, distinctly point to a strong influence of the bulk disorder in the graphite flakes on rho_c, confirming the recent theory put forward...|$|R

The research is primarily aimed at developing advanced applications of wet etching in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). The etching process is carried out at different temperatures in the range of 61 - 81 Â°C. The etching results of silicon hemisphere and different shapes of three-dimensional structures in 1 0 0 - and 1 1 0 -Si surfaces are analyzed.

It is known that individual pores in meso-porous silicon form a dense array with a stable front propagating in the bulk of the crystal. Despite that individual pore channels in this array display strong anisotropy of their motion (microscopic anisotropy), the anisotropy in the propagation of the pore front (macroscopic anisotropy) is rather weak. Porous silicon has been intensively studied in the last two decades; however, the information about the macroscopic anisotropy of the electrochemical etching rate is scarce [8 – 12], and its quantitative characteristics are at all lacking. A possible reason is that no appropriate method of study has been developed so far. Recently, we suggested the method of local anodization of p-Si wafers through a mask in the form of narrow long wedges radiating from the center in all directions (‘wagon-wheel’ mask) [13], previously used to examine only the chemical <b>etching</b> <b>anisotropy</b> for Si in alkaline solutions [14, 15].

40|$|Silicon {{electrochemical}} micromachining technology (ECM) {{has come}} a long way since the pioneering paper of Lehmann and Foll, dated 1990, which firstly reported about the possibility of controlling the electrochemical dissolution of silicon in HF-aqueous electrolytes by back-side illumination etching for the formation of nicely ordered array of macropores. Currently, ECM is routinely used in different laboratories around the world to fabricate silicon microstructures (e. g. microtips, spirals) and microsystems (e. g. microgrippers, microneedles) of much higher complexity than macropores, with application ranging from (bio) sensing to nanomedicine, from photonics to microelectronics. ECM technology capitalizes on the experimental and theoretical results reported in the literature over the last two decades on the electrochemical dissolution of silicon in HF-aqueous electrolytes. Among others (e. g. aspect-ratio> 100, verticality≈ 90 °, surface roughness< 10 nm), it is worth mentioning the peculiarity of dynamically controlling the electrochemical <b>etching</b> <b>anisotropy</b> from 1 to 0 in real-time, which has greatly advanced such a technology with respect to state-of-the-art etching technology. Nonetheless, a number of important limitations either remain unsolved or need to be improved towards future industrial applications of ECM technology (e. g. minimum and maximum etching features, etching rate). In this paper, basic and advanced features as well as main limitations of silicon microfabrication by ECM technology are thoroughly reviewed and discussed, both from theoretical and experimental points of view, also with reference to future industrial applications.

40|$|Integration of {{conjugated}} luminescent polymers into three-dimensional silicon microstructures for cell culturing and diagnostics Although {{in nature}} cells reside in environments with three-dimensional features, {{most of what}} is known about cell proliferation-differentiation-death has been derived from cultures on flat surfaces, such as Petri dishes or glass slides. Investigating and monitoring cell cultures into a three-dimensional matrix has been demonstrated to highlight major effects on cell behaviour, from adhesion and differentiation to apoptosis, that are not similarly evident from cell cultures on flat substrates. The recent progress in cell culture and microfabrication technologies has suggested the development of a novel generation of label-free cell-based sensors for drug discovery, clinical diagnostics, and detection of toxic agents. Such a new-generation of cell-based biosensors exploits living cells in three-dimensional microstructures as bioreceptors and allows cell morpho-functional changes and/or detachment, induced by exposure to environmental perturbations, to be monitored by a suitable transduction (i. e. optical, electrical) method, possibly in a non-invasive and label-free manner. A number of label-free biosensors exploiting different electrical and optical transduction mechanisms has been reported so far. The main objective of this thesis is the development of a three-dimensional silicon microstructure for 3 D cell cultures and diagnostics. The microstructure consists of a microstructured silicon substrate featuring a two-dimensional array of square holes (size of about 40 micron x 40 micron and depth of about 50 micron) with spatial periods of 70 microns. Anchor structures characterized by a two-dimensional periodicity are integrated between adjacent holes. A photoluminescent and/or electroluminescent conducting polymer film is deposited at the bottom of each hole, so that, upon suitable excitation, the light emitted by the polymer can be used for investigating the biological material. In fact, from the spectral analysis of the light transmitted at each hole through the biological material, {{it might be possible to}} identify cells featuring special characteristics, such as tumour cells that have a higher volume and refractive index with respect to healthy cells. The proposed microstructure has been fabricated by silicon electrochemical micromachining (ECM) technology in a single etching step. ECM advanced features, such as dynamic control of the <b>etching</b> <b>anisotropy</b> (from 1 to 0) as the electrochemical etching progresses, allow the silicon dissolution to be switched in real-time from the anisotropic to the isotropic regime and enable advanced silicon microstructuring to be achieved through the use of high-aspect-ratio functional and sacrificial structures, the former being functional to the microsystem operation and the latter being sacrificed for accurate microsystem fabrication. We investigated several deposition techniques, ranging from spin-coating to drop-casting and dip-coating. The deposition of the luminescent polymer film on the bottom of the culturing wells is not trivial owing to the very high aspect ratio of these wells. The polymer film coverage has been investigated via Fluorescence Microscopy and the best results have been reached depositing the polymer by dip-coating. The device performances have been investigated via optical excitation with a laser emitting within the absorption band of the polymer and collecting, then, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra. The present work has been focused on the microstructure realization and on the polymer film integration in such structure, but long-term developments could regard the microstructure performance improvement. It is to be highlighted that, even if this is a feasibility study, the results are encouraging for further investigations. By properly designing the anchor structure, in fact, such structure could act as a two-dimensional photonic crystal. If the photonic crystal structure band-gap falls in the wavelength range of polymer photoluminescence/electroluminescence emission, a confinement of the light emitted by the polymer film in the out-of-plane (perpendicular to the substrate surface) direction is expected. The resulting reduction of optical losses in the in-plane directions (parallel to the substrate surface) and the increased coupling efficiency with cells living in the holes could improve the microstructure performance...|$|E

Their durability under harsh environmental and operational conditions such as high pressure and high temperature, and large spectral coverage range including 200 nm deep ultra-violet (deepUV) through 1500 nm infra-red (IR) make them excellent candidates for opto-electronic applications such as full color LCD panels, biomedical sensor devices, high resolution printers, high density storage devices, defense systems. Among III-Nitrides, GaN has attracted the most interest with its high electronic band gap of 3. 4 eV at room temperature and ability to form compounds with other group III elements aluminum and indium which have band gaps of 6. 2 eV and 0. 7 eV respectively which results in a large optical spectrum. However, potential performance of III-Nitride based devices is hindered mainly because of an optical phenomenon called total internal reflection (TIR). High dielectric constant of these materials prevents light {{to escape from the}} structure. Light is totally reflected back from the air-nitride interface for incident angles larger than critical angle. With a refractive index of 2. 7, GaN material has 22 °- 24 ° critical angle which means less than 12 % of light can just escape the structure. While 66 % of the light generated in quantum well region of a GaN based light emitting diode (LED) is trapped in the GaN layer, 22 % of the light is guided in the sapphire substrate. Because of TIR, although internal quantum efficiency of GaN based LED with emission wavelength of around 400 nm is almost unity (higher than 90 %), external quantum efficiency is very low. To enhance extraction, a lot of geometrical methods including surface roughening and facet shaping have been tried to reduce the effects of dielectric contrast between the device and medium. In order to increase the extraction efficiency of GaN based LEDs, two dimensional photonic crystals were used in this thesis. LED wafers used were fabricated in collaboration with University of Santa Barbara, California (UCSB) which are InGaN/GaN multi quantum well (MQW) structures that emit light at 390 nm and 410 nm respectively. These LED wafers were processed in the scope of the thesis and photonic crystal (PC) structures were patterned on the p layer of the device. This thesis work is concentrated on two parts; first part is characterization and fabrication, and second part is simulation. In characterization and fabrication part, firstly GaN material etching characterizations were completed using dry etching method by reactive ion etcher (RIE) since there had been no optimized recipe for GaN processing in the clean room know-how. In this characterization, main parameter was the <b>etching</b> <b>anisotropy</b> since vertical side-wall is crucial for LED processing and PC formation. After characterization step was completed, p doping activation was done in Middle East Technical University, Ankara (METU) and then LED wafers were processed in clean room class- 100 environment at Bilkent University, Ankara by using the know-how and recipe obtained from characterization stage. As a final step, two dimensional square and triangular photonic crystal lattice structures were patterned by using electron beam writer and these structures were transferred on to p layer of GaN LED by using RIE. Measurements and imaging regarding material and optical properties, fabrication quality and extraction enhancement were done by using scanning electron microscope (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), spectrophotometer (UV-Vis), ellipsometer and probe station. I-V characteristics, optical power measurements and intensity plots on black&white CCD camera images were taken. In simulations part, two and three dimensional simulations using plane wave expansion method, integral method and finite difference time domain method were completed. More than 40000 simulations were run in total during this thesis work. As a result, PCs with 520 nm lattice period and 260 nm hole diameters in square and triangular geometries were modeled and fabricated. Final depth of lattices was around 100 - 120 nm. Results of 2 D integral simulations suggested around 15 - 20 % of error between modeling and experiments because of imperfectness regarding fabrication of PC structures. Furthermore, damaging effects of RIE and focused electron beams were not considered. In measurements, extraction efficiency enhancement factors of about 2. 2 and about 2. 6 were found using square and triangular PC lattices with respect to LED devices without PC structure patterning. In simulations, while square PC lattice models showed 2. 8 times enhancement in extraction efficiency, triangular lattice resulted in 3. 1 times with respect to no PC models. In comparison of measurements and simulations, difference in the range of 15 - 25 % was found which were expected as stated above with also considering the effect of processing damages on top p and p++ layer and quantum well region. by Ali Güneş Kaya.
