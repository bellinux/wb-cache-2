25|$|Some {{materials}} show induced magnetic {{behavior that}} follows a Curie type law but with exceptionally large {{values for the}} Curie constants. These materials are known as superparamagnets. They are characterized by a strong ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic type of coupling into domains of a limited size that behave independently from one another. The bulk properties of such a system resembles that of a paramagnet, but on a microscopic level they are ordered. The materials do show an ordering temperature above which the behavior reverts to ordinary paramagnetism (with interaction). Ferrofluids are a good example, but the phenomenon can also occur inside solids, e.g., when dilute paramagnetic centers are introduced in a strong itinerant medium of ferromagnetic coupling such as when Fe is substituted in TlCu2Se2 or the alloy AuFe. Such systems contain <b>ferromagnetically</b> coupled clusters that freeze out at lower temperatures. They are also called mictomagnets.|$|E

50|$|With {{regard to}} coil composition, the core {{material}} may {{be either a}} magnetically inert substrate (i.e., the so-called 'air-core' coil design), or possess a solid, <b>ferromagnetically</b> active material (i.e., the so-called 'solid-core' design).

Varying the geometric shape of the coil itself may also result in variations in the focality, shape, and depth of cortical penetration of the magnetic field. Differences in the coil substance as well as the electronic operation of the power supply to the coil may also result in variations in the biophysical characteristics of the resulting magnetic pulse (e.g., width or duration of the magnetic field pulse).

40|$|Motivated by {{the fact}} that many bilayer quantum magnets occur in nature, we generalize the study of thermal Hall {{transports}} of spin excitations to bilayer magnetic systems. It is shown that bilayer magnetic systems can be coupled either <b>ferromagnetically</b> or antiferromagnetically. We study both scenarios on the honeycomb lattice and show that the system realizes topologically nontrivial magnon bands induced by alternating next-nearest-neighbour Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction (DMI). As a result, the bilayer system realizes both magnon Hall effect and magnon spin Nernst effect. We show that antiferromagnetically coupled layers differ from <b>ferromagnetically</b> coupled layers by a sign change in the conductivities as the magnetic field is reversed. Furthermore, Chern number protected magnon edge states are observed and propagate in the same direction on the top and bottom layers in <b>ferromagnetically</b> coupled layers, whereas the magnon edge states propagate in opposite directions for antiferromagnetically coupled layers.

40|$|We present {{theoretical}} {{results for}} the underscreened Kondo lattice model with localized S= 1 spins coupled to a conduction band through a Kondo coupling, J_K, and interacting among them <b>ferromagnetically.</b> We use a fermionic representation for the spin operators and expand the Hamiltonian in terms of bosonic fields. For large values of J_K, we obtain a <b>ferromagnetically</b> ordered solution and a Kondo regime with a Kondo temperature, T_K, larger than the Curie temperature, T_C. This finding suggests a scenario for a coexistence of Kondo effect and ferromagnetic order. In some uranium compounds, like UTe or UCu_ 0. 9 Sb_ 2, this kind of coexistence has been experimentally observed: they order <b>ferromagnetically</b> with a Curie temperature of order T_C ∼ 100 K and exhibit a Kondo behavior for T > T_C. The proposed underscreened Kondo lattice model accounts well for the coexistence between magnetic order and Kondo behavior and yields to a new "ferromagnetic Doniach diagram"...|$|E
40|$|By {{means of}} a diagram {{technique}} for Hubbard operators we show {{the existence of a}} spin-dependent renormalization of the localized levels in an interacting region, e. g. quantum dot, modeled by the Anderson Hamiltonian with two conduction bands. It is shown that the renormalization of the levels with a given spin direction is due to kinematic interactions with the conduction sub-bands of the opposite spin. The consequence of this dressing of the localized levels is a drastically decreased tunneling current for <b>ferromagnetically</b> ordered leads compared to that of paramagnetically ordered leads. Furthermore, the studied system shows a spin-dependent resonant tunneling behaviour for <b>ferromagnetically</b> ordered leads. Comment: 8 pages, 5 figure...|$|E

The system bath interaction is studied under the central spin model, where the qubits are coupled to the bath spins through isotropic Heisenberg interaction. We have given a more generalized representation of the protocol in terms of density matrices and calculated the average fidelity of the teleported state for different Bell state measurements performed by Alice. The common bath interaction differentiates the outcome of various Bell state measurements made by Alice. There will be a high fidelity teleportation for a singlet measurement made by Alice when both the qubits of Alice interact either <b>ferromagnetically</b> or antiferromagnetically with bath.
