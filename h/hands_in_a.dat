5|$|The next {{match was}} The Undertaker against Batista in a Last Man Standing Match for the World Heavyweight Championship. At one spot, Undertaker leg dropped Batista through an {{announce}} table. Towards the end, the two fought up the entrance ramp, where Batista speared to The Undertaker off the stage. Neither man {{could get to}} their feet before the referee's count of ten; in result, the match ended in a draw. Due to WWE regulations, titles can't change <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Last Man Standing match by a draw, so The Undertaker remained champion.|$|E
5|$|After infiltrating the Garden of Death and {{the castle}} where Blofeld spends his time {{dressed in the}} costume of a Samurai warrior, Bond is {{captured}} and Bunt identifies him as a British secret agent and not a Japanese coal miner. After surviving a near execution, Bond exacts revenge on Blofeld in a duel, Blofeld armed with a sword and Bond with a wooden staff. Bond eventually kills Blofeld by strangling him with his bare <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> fit of violent rage, then blows up the castle. Upon escaping, he suffers a head injury, leaving him an amnesiac living as a Japanese fisherman with Kissy, {{while the rest of}} the world believes him dead; his obituary appears in the newspapers.|$|E
5|$|Drummond's wartime {{experience}} {{had given him}} a series of abilities akin to that of a hunter: stealth—"he could move over ground without a single blade of grass rustling"—and the ability to incapacitate others—"he could kill a man with his bare <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> second". During his time on the Western Front he would take himself on solitary raids through no man's land. Drummond was also proficient in jujutsu and boxing, was a crack shot, played cricket for the Free Foresters, and was an excellent poker player. In addition to Drummond's physical attributes is his common sense, which allows him to equal and beat his opponents, even if they have a superior intellect.|$|E

5|$|In New York City, Stephen Strange, an {{acclaimed}} but arrogant neurosurgeon, badly injures his <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> car accident, {{leaving him}} unable to operate. Fellow surgeon and former lover Christine Palmer {{tries to help}} him move on, but Strange vainly pursues experimental surgeries to heal his hands. Strange eventually learns of Jonathan Pangborn, a paraplegic who mysteriously regained full use of his legs. Pangborn directs Strange to Kamar-Taj, where he is taken in by Mordo, a sorcerer under the Ancient One. The Ancient One demonstrates her power to Strange, revealing the astral plane and other dimensions such as the Mirror Dimension. She eventually agrees to train Strange, despite his arrogance, which reminds her of Kaecilius.|$|E
5|$|In Western European {{medieval and}} Renaissance {{versions}} of the legend, Troilus is the youngest of Priam's five legitimate sons by Hecuba. Despite his youth {{he is one of}} the main Trojan war leaders. He dies in battle at Achilles' <b>hands.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> popular addition to the story, originating in the 12th century, Troilus falls in love with Cressida, whose father has defected to the Greeks. Cressida pledges her love to Troilus but she soon switches her affections to the Greek hero Diomedes when sent to her father in a hostage exchange. Chaucer and Shakespeare are among the authors who wrote works telling the story of Troilus and Cressida. Within the medieval tradition, Troilus was regarded as a paragon of the faithful courtly lover and also of the virtuous pagan knight. Once the custom of courtly love had faded, his fate was regarded less sympathetically.|$|E
5|$|In {{the smaller}} painting, Mary averts {{her eyes and}} folds her <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> gesture that symbolised {{submission}} to God's will. Mary is not submissive, however, in the larger piece. The girl, interrupted in her reading by this unexpected messenger, puts a finger in her bible to mark the place and raises her hand in a formal gesture of greeting or surprise. This calm young woman appears to accept her role as the Mother of God, not with resignation but with confidence. In this painting, the young Leonardo presents the humanist face of the Virgin Mary, recognising humanity's role in God's incarnation.|$|E

5|$|On September 11, 2004, Cotto faced Kelson Pinto from Brazil, for {{the vacant}} World Boxing Organization junior welterweight title. This {{represented}} the third fight between them, with Pinto being victorious in their two previous encounters, {{both of which}} took place {{while they were still}} amateurs. The fight was televised by HBO from San Juan, Puerto Rico. During this card Cotto utilized a defensive stance with his <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> high position instead of his usual aggressive orthodox stance. Over the course of the fight Cotto scored three knockdowns and won the World Boxing Organization Junior Welterweight Championship by knockout in the sixth round.|$|E
5|$|The {{cover was}} {{designed}} by Metallica and Peter Mensch and painted by Don Brautigam. It depicts a cemetery field of white crosses tethered to strings, manipulated {{by a pair of}} <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> blood-red sky. Instead of releasing a single or video in advance of the album's release, Metallica embarked on a five-month American tour in support of Ozzy Osbourne. The European leg was canceled after Burton's death in September 1986, and the band returned home to audition a new bassist. Metallica honored the album's 20th anniversary on the Escape from the Studio '06 tour, by playing it in its entirety.|$|E
5|$|The gunfight {{was not the}} end of the conflict. On December 28, 1881, Virgil Earp was ambushed and maimed in {{a murder}} attempt by the Cowboys. On March 18, 1882, Cowboys fired from a dark alley through the glass door of a saloon, killing Morgan Earp. The {{suspects}} in both incidents furnished alibis supplied by other Cowboys and were not indicted. Wyatt Earp, newly appointed as Deputy U.S. Marshal in Cochise County, then took matters into his own <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> personal vendetta. He was pursued by county sheriff Johnny Behan, who had received a warrant from Tucson for Wyatt's shooting of Frank Stilwell.|$|E

25|$|In November 1582, the Spaniards, led by Juan Baptista de Tasis, returned. Steenwijk {{was soon}} {{overcome}} {{and the remaining}} Protestants fled the city. Steenwijk, now a Spanish stronghold, had only fifty of its original inhabitants. Only Zeeland, Utrecht and Friesland remained in Dutch rebel <b>hands.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> short time the Spanish army, now led by Anthonie de Coquele, was expanded to over 1,000 men, including Spaniards, Italians, Walloons and Burgundians.|$|E

25|$|Major Henry Smith, acting Commissioner of the City Police, {{claimed in}} his memoirs to have {{discovered}} bloodied water in a public sink in a court off Dorset Street, and as the water was slowly {{running out of the}} basin, he calculated that the Ripper had been there only moments before. Ripper author Martin Fido thought it unlikely that the culprit would wait to wash his <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> semi-public place about forty minutes after the crime, and Smith's memoirs are both unreliable and embellished for dramatic effect.

25|$|A {{significant}} factor in {{the sound of a}} loudspeaker system is the amount of absorption and diffusion present in the environment. Clapping one's <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> typical empty room, without draperies or carpet, produces a zippy, fluttery echo due both to a lack of absorption and to reverberation (that is, repeated echoes) from flat reflective walls, floor, and ceiling. The addition of hard surfaced furniture, wall hangings, shelving and even baroque plaster ceiling decoration changes the echoes, primarily because of diffusion caused by reflective objects with shapes and surfaces having sizes on the order of the sound wavelengths. This somewhat breaks up the simple reflections otherwise caused by bare flat surfaces, and spreads the reflected energy of an incident wave over a larger angle on reflection.|$|E
