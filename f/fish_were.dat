5|$|In 1966, a sludge pond {{discharged}} a {{large amount}} of toxic waste into Kettle Creek. Over 185,000 <b>fish</b> <b>were</b> killed by this.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 2000, twelve species of <b>fish</b> <b>were</b> {{observed}} during electrofishing. They included eastern blacknose dace, northern hognosed suckers, shiners, smallmouth bass, and rock bass.|$|E
5|$|This {{suggestion}} was acted upon and in 1889 the first non-native <b>fish</b> <b>were</b> stocked into Yellowstone waters, {{a practice that}} continued until 1955 and helped create the angling experience Yellowstone National Park is renowned for.|$|E
50|$|Recreational <b>fishing</b> <b>is</b> <b>fishing</b> for {{pleasure}} or competition. It can be contrasted with commercial <b>fishing,</b> which <b>is</b> <b>fishing</b> for economic profit, or subsistence <b>fishing,</b> which <b>is</b> <b>fishing</b> for survival.|$|R
50|$|Bait <b>fish</b> can <b>be</b> {{contrasted with}} forage <b>fish.</b> Bait <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> a term used {{particularly}} by recreational fishermen, although commercial fisherman also catch fish to bait longlines and traps. Forage <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> a fisheries term, {{and is used}} in that context. Forage <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> small <b>fish</b> that <b>are</b> preyed on in the wild by larger predators for food. The predators can <b>be</b> other larger <b>fish,</b> seabirds and marine mammals. Bait <b>fish,</b> by contrast, <b>are</b> <b>fish</b> that <b>are</b> caught by humans to use as bait for other fish. The terms also overlap {{in the sense that}} most bait <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> also forage <b>fish,</b> and most forage <b>fish</b> can also <b>be</b> used as bait fish.|$|R
50|$|Game <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> <b>fish</b> {{pursued by}} {{recreational}} anglers. They can be freshwater or saltwater fish. Game <b>fish</b> can <b>be</b> eaten after being caught. Some game <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> also targeted commercially, particularly salmon.|$|R
5|$|Analysis {{of antiquities}} related to {{skeletal}} remains revealed 12 species of domesticated and wild animals: cattle, buffaloes (Bubalisbubalis linn), sheep (Ovis aries), cheetal (Axis axis), barasinga, pig, elephant, rhinoceros, cheetal (Axis axia), dog, a carp and {{two types of}} turtles. Bones of birds and <b>fish</b> <b>were</b> also found. Faunal finds indicate that the area was forested over an undulating topography.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 100 dead <b>fish</b> <b>were</b> {{reported}} in two streams after fire retardant was accidentally dropped on them. Aside from a temporary decrease {{in a few}} species of aquatic insects, no long-term impact has been observed on aquatic life in any of Yellowstone's rivers or lakes.|$|E
5|$|The Army {{also tried}} to control poaching. In 1896, acting Superintendent Colonel S. B. M. Young stopped issuing firearm permits after {{discovering}} {{that large numbers of}} game and <b>fish</b> <b>were</b> being killed. Poaching continues to be an issue in the 21st century. The Army's administration of the park ended in 1914.|$|E
50|$|Standard size of male <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> 3.2″ (8cm) {{and female}} <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> 4.8″ (12cm).|$|R
50|$|Hunting and <b>fishing</b> <b>are</b> {{popular among}} the {{residents}} of the town. Hunters chiefly pursue white-tailed deer, pheasant, quail, and raccoon. Local <b>fishing</b> <b>is</b> focused on catfish. Other game animals and <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> also found in the area.|$|R
50|$|<b>Fishing</b> <b>is</b> popular on the island. Until {{the late}} 1980s, skate <b>fishing</b> <b>was</b> a growing industry.|$|R
5|$|The Bororo {{people of}} Mato Grosso in central Brazil {{regarded}} the constellation as a land tortoise Geriguigui, while the Tucano {{people of the}} northwestern Amazon region saw it as an egret. To the Tupi people of São Luís Island in Brazil, Corvus might {{have been seen as}} a grill or barbecue—seychouioura, on which <b>fish</b> <b>were</b> grilled. The depiction could have also referred to the Great Square of Pegasus.|$|E
5|$|The Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox Churches {{and their}} {{calendars}} had great influence on eating habits; consumption of meat was forbidden {{for a full}} third {{of the year for}} most Christians. All animal products, including eggs and dairy products (but not <b>fish),</b> <b>were</b> generally prohibited during Lent and fast. Additionally, it was customary for all citizens to fast prior to taking the Eucharist. These fasts were occasionally for a full day and required total abstinence.|$|E
5|$|The main {{agricultural}} {{staple foods}} during the Han dynasty were foxtail millet, proso millet, rice (including glutinous rice), wheat, beans, and barley. Other food items included sorghum, taro, mallow, mustard plant, jujube, pear, plum (including Prunus salicina and Prunus mume), peach, apricot, and myrica. Chicken, duck, goose, beef, pork, rabbit, sika deer, turtle dove, owl, Chinese bamboo partridge, magpie, common pheasant, crane, and {{various types of}} <b>fish</b> <b>were</b> commonly consumed meats.|$|E
5000|$|Fishing - Catch {{some fish}} for points. Small <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> worth 100 points, medium <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> worth 200 points, and big <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> worth 300 points. Careful! Do not catch the shark, {{if you catch}} it, you'll lose 1000 points. 1 ...|$|R
5000|$|A game <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> any {{species of}} fish pursued for sport by recreationalists (anglers). The capture of game <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> usually tightly regulated. In comparison, nongame <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> all <b>fish</b> not {{considered}} game fish. Game <b>fish</b> may <b>be</b> eaten after being caught, though increasingly anglers are practicing catch-and-release tactics to improve fish populations.|$|R
50|$|Smoked <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> <b>fish</b> {{that has}} <b>been</b> cured by smoking. Foods have been smoked by humans {{throughout}} history. Originally {{this was done}} as a preservative. In more recent times <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> readily preserved by refrigeration and freezing and the smoking of <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> generally done for the unique taste and flavour imparted by the smoking process.|$|R
5|$|After the American Civil War, {{returning}} residents {{found that}} their slaves, livestock and farm equipment had been taken. Most residents relocated. However, in the early 20th century, farmers returned {{and the town of}} Green Lake modestly grew to an approximate population of 300 in 1914. At the time, much of the land in the vicinity was used for livestock grazing. The only profitable commercial uses for the lake itself included transportation of lumber and fishing. Approximately US$100,000 worth of <b>fish</b> <b>were</b> caught in the lake from 1900 to 1915. Nevertheless, the lake bed remained dry for extended periods and vegetation covered certain areas. Local residents soon began to use the bed to grow cotton.|$|E
5|$|Exceptionally heavy {{rainfall}} in November 2012 caused a major {{break in the}} Grand Western Canal's banks, near Halberton, necessitating nearby homes to be evacuated. Two temporary dams were installed which allowed {{the rest of the}} canal to remain open and meant the horse drawn barge at Tiverton was able to run throughout the summer of 2013. Around 400 <b>fish</b> <b>were</b> returned to the canal from a flooded field but many fish including pike, eels, perch, bream, tench and roach were lost. About 25 people from the Environment Agency and Tiverton Angling Club assisted with saving the fish. The Environment Agency restocked the canal with 3,000 fish in January 2013 and by May the Environment Agency said they were flourishing.|$|E
5|$|Fish and Shawn McGrath {{collaborated on}} a puzzle game that became Fez. When McGrath left the project due to {{creative}} differences, Fish, the game's artist, pursued a platform game direction with Renaud Bédard, the game's programmer, {{who wrote the}} game's level editor and game engine from scratch. Levels were built in 3D by extruding surfaces with Photoshop-created textures. Bédard and <b>Fish</b> <b>were</b> joined by three different animators and other collaborators. The game was first announced in June 2007 and won an award at the 2008 Independent Games Festival and entered the public spotlight. Fish created a studio, Polytron Corporation, and was later aided by nearby developer-publisher Trapdoor when Polytron ran out of money. Fez won several more prerelease awards, including the 2012 Seumas McNally Grand Prize.|$|E
25|$|Forage <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> {{sometimes}} referred to as bait fish or feeder <b>fish.</b> Bait <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> a term used particularly by recreational fishermen, although commercial fisherman also catch fish to bait longlines and traps. Forage <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> a fisheries term, and is used in the context of fisheries. Bait <b>fish,</b> by contrast, <b>are</b> <b>fish</b> that <b>are</b> caught by humans to use as bait for other fish. The terms overlap in the sense that most bait <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> also forage <b>fish,</b> and vice versa. Feeder <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> a term used particularly in the context of fish aquariums. It refers essentially to the same concept as forage fish, small <b>fish</b> that <b>are</b> eaten by larger fish, but the term is adapted to the particular requirements of working with fish in aquariums.|$|R
5000|$|The jellynose fishes or tadpole <b>fishes</b> <b>are</b> {{the small}} order Ateleopodiformes. This group of ray-finned <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> monotypic, {{containing}} a single family Ateleopodidae. It has {{about a dozen}} species in four genera, but these enigmatic <b>fishes</b> <b>are</b> in need of taxonomic revision.|$|R
25|$|Like coastal {{demersal}} fish, {{deep sea}} demersal <b>fish</b> can <b>be</b> divided into benthic fish and benthopelagic fish, where the benthic <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> negatively buoyant and benthopelagic <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> neutrally buoyant.|$|R
5|$|More than 90 {{species of}} birds breed within the Briar Creek watershed. These include several species of ducks, flycatchers, herons, plovers, rails, and swallows, {{as well as one}} species of {{kingfisher}} and one species of crane. Bald eagles, sandhill cranes, and several species of waterfowl have been observed on Briar Creek Reservoir. Mammals living in the watershed include minks, muskrats, and short-tailed shrews, and the endangered Indiana bat. Fish, damselflies, mayflies, and other macroinvertebrates also inhabit the watershed. A total of 28 species of <b>fish</b> <b>were</b> observed by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission in the watershed in 2006. Earlier, 34 species were observed.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{watershed}} of Roaring Creek is in Columbia County, but small areas are in Montour County, Northumberland County, and Schuylkill County. More than 40 percent of {{the watershed}} is forested and nearly 40 percent is agricultural land. State game lands and state forests {{are also in the}} watershed. A total of approximately 3,500 people inhabit the watershed, as of 2000. The creek's drainage basin is a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery upstream of Lick Run. Downstream of Lick Run, the main stem is a Trout Stocked Fishery and Migratory Fishery. A reach of the creek above Lick Run is designated as Class A Wild Trout Waters. 31 species of <b>fish</b> <b>were</b> observed at 20 sites in the watershed in 2003 and 2004.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{organisms that}} can be classified as <b>fish</b> <b>were</b> soft-bodied chordates that first appeared during the Cambrian period. Although they lacked a true spine, they possessed notochords which allowed {{them to be more}} agile than their invertebrate counterparts. Fish would continue to evolve through the Paleozoic era, diversifying into a wide variety of forms. Many fish of the Paleozoic developed external armor that protected them from predators. The first fish with jaws appeared in the Silurian period, after which many (such as sharks) became formidable marine predators rather than just the prey of arthropods.|$|E
50|$|In Hinduism, The Rainbow <b>Fish</b> <b>was</b> a <b>fish</b> that <b>was</b> {{as large}} as a whale. It ate Buddha, an {{incarnation}} of the deity Vishnu. The Rainbow <b>Fish</b> <b>was</b> caught and killed by some fishermen who freed Buddha from its stomach. After The Rainbow <b>Fish</b> <b>was</b> caught, it provided an entire nation with food for a year.|$|R
50|$|Oily <b>fish</b> can <b>be</b> {{contrasted with}} white fish, which contain oil {{only in the}} liver, and much less overall than oily fish. Examples of white <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> cod, haddock and flatfish. White <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> usually {{demersal}} <b>fish</b> which live {{on or near the}} seafloor, whereas oily <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> pelagic, living in the water column away from the bottom.|$|R
50|$|Coarse <b>fishing</b> <b>is</b> a {{term used}} in the United Kingdom and Ireland for angling for coarse <b>fish.</b> Coarse <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> {{freshwater}} <b>fish</b> that <b>are</b> distinguished from game fish. Freshwater game <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> all salmonids - most particularly salmon, trout and char - so generally coarse <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> freshwater <b>fish</b> that <b>are</b> not salmonids. There is disagreement over whether grayling should be classified as a game fish or a coarse <b>fish.</b> Fly <b>fishing</b> <b>is</b> the technique usually used for freshwater game fishing, while other angling techniques are usually used for coarse fishing. The sport of coarse fishing and the techniques it uses are particularly popular in the United Kingdom and mainland Europe, and {{as well as in}} some former British Commonwealth countries and among British expatriates.|$|R
5|$|The {{inspiration}} for Nemo sprang from multiple experiences, {{going back to}} director Andrew Stanton's childhood, when he loved going to the dentist to see the fish tank, assuming that the <b>fish</b> <b>were</b> from the ocean and wanted to go home. In 1992, shortly after his son was born, {{he and his family}} took a trip to Six Flags Discovery Kingdom (which was called Marine World at the time). There, after seeing the shark tube and various exhibits, he felt that the underwater world could be done beautifully in computer animation. Later, in 1997, he took his son for a walk in the park, but realized that he was overprotecting him and lost an opportunity to have a father-son experience that day.|$|E
5|$|The {{market place}} at the centre of Poulton is the width of two streets and is now closed to motor traffic. Lying south of St Chad's Church and {{surrounded}} by shops, the square contains the town's war memorial {{as well as a}} market cross, stocks, whipping post and fish slabs, from which <b>fish</b> <b>were</b> sold on market days. Although many of the buildings surrounding the market place were rebuilt following a fire in the 18thcentury, a few of the earlier buildings remain. To the south of the market place are town houses that were built for local merchants and professionals.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} staple crops {{consumed}} during Han were wheat, barley, foxtail millet, proso millet, rice, and beans. Commonly eaten {{fruits and vegetables}} included chestnuts, pears, plums, peaches, melons, apricots, strawberries, red bayberries, jujubes, calabash, bamboo shoots, mustard plant and taro. Domesticated animals that were also eaten included chickens, Mandarin ducks, geese, cows, sheep, pigs, camels and dogs (various types were bred specifically for food, while most were used as pets). Turtles and <b>fish</b> <b>were</b> taken from streams and lakes. Commonly hunted game, such as owl, pheasant, magpie, sika deer, and Chinese bamboo partridge were consumed. Seasonings included sugar, honey, salt and soy sauce. Beer and wine were regularly consumed.|$|E
