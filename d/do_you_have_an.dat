Frequently, people become disturbed by a particular situation, which results in discussion, tension, and conflict that leads to a search for solutions. Many issues often surround a problem or concern. The terms “public issue ” and “public policy ” can be defined in several ways. A private problem or issue becomes public when consequences of individual or group action go beyond those directly involved. An effort by others to influence those consequences is also present. As more people become involved, leaders and interested citizens become aware of the concern. Discussion clarifies and defines the problem or opportunity—the gap between “what is ” and “what could be. ” The issue then emerges as differen...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients use advance directives. Since the PSDA (Patient Self Determination Act) was passed in 1990, the use of advance directives has low numbers. This study utilized the model of Joyce Travelbees (Tomey & Alligood, 1998) human-to-human-relationship theory which emphasizes attaining a rapport with the patient after progressing through the original encounter, emerging identities, having sympathy and empathy. Twenty-five COPD subjects were given a quantitative cross sectional survey at a suburban hospital in Michigan, which included demographic information such as: age, gender, education, marital status and insurance. The subjects completed a self-report questionnaire about advance directives including questions such as: <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> advance directive and who gave you information about advance directives. This study used SPSS (Statistical Package for the social sciences) for analyzing the data. The results showed that most subjects were > 65 years of age, had a high-school education, were female, and were married. Results for this study also revealed that a high number of the subjects did not have an advanced directive. Implications for theory, practice and research are related to the results. Of special importance is that healthcare workers, including nurse practitioners, should continue to support advance directives in their professional practice...|$|E

40|$|What do you {{experience}} when you read? You are reading right now, so ask yourself, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> inner voice, visual imagery, or a perceptual {{experience of the}} words on the page. Perhaps, while you read this abstract, you simply find your mind wandering. Philosophers and psychologist provide radically conflicting descriptions of the commonplace experience of reading, and my own introspection feels incomplete and unclear. I begin, in Chapter 1, by making the case for a healthy skepticism towards introspective reports, even those of experts describing their current experiences. In Chapter 2, I contrast the experience of reading with perceptual experiences and discuss the sources of introspective error: inference error, overgeneralization, and memory limitations. Due to these sources of error, we can not take introspective reports at face value, and I argue for the need to compare subjective and objective measures of experience using the Subjective and Objective Measures of Experience (SOME) method. Chapter 3 is an examination of the cognitive processes that underlie the act of reading, and I discuss the phonological loop, the visuospatial sketchpad, situational models of narrative comprehension, flow, and mind wandering. In Chapter 4, I describe a series of experiments on the phenomenology of reading that use SOME method. Chapter 5 is a general discussion of the results. These experiments suggest that there is extensive variability in the experience of reading. Experts have been blind to this variability because introspective error creates systematic biases in descriptions of experience. I argue that our confidence in introspective reports is always high, regardless of accuracy, so we must evaluate methods of measuring introspective reports, not the reports themselves. Further, these results suggest that coarse-grained aspects of experience, such as modal experiences while reading, are functionally isolated. They are what I call paraphenomena. When our experiences are not functionally isolated, the relationship between experience and behavior is often one of interference instead of facilitation. I finish by laying out the implications for the relationship between phenomenal and functional notions of consciousness...|$|E
