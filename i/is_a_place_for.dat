Each details a particular life experience {{which led to the}} poet's examination of nature and the role of poetry. They describe virtuous conduct and man's obligation to God, nature and society, and ask as if there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> simple appreciation of nature without having to actively dedicate one's life to altruism.|$|E

Bread, produced in cottage bakeries, is available, as is locally grown and imported rice, although neither of these products is comparable to cassava in popularity.|$|E
25|$|Looking back, {{the total}} lack of a comic book scene in the early 2000s proved to have a {{cleansing}} effect and pushed many to rebuild the whole scene from its base. The first to act were remaining hardcore fans, who began to organize into web communities on Internet forums and a new scene developed {{on the basis of}} scanlations. Since no comic books were sold on the market, fans began to scan, translate, re-letter and share digital comics. In English speaking countries scanlations usually refer to manga, but in Hungary the process of fan translations and lettering started with Marvel superhero-type comics, and then moved on to other types. The most notable achievement of the Hungarian scanlating scene was that it brought together the fans, forming a base of comics fandom. Although many different websites existed, each specializing in different comics genres, types (European, superhero, independent, manga, underground, etc.), Kepregeny.net managed to unite all different kind of comics fans. Kepregeny.net also started out as a scanlating and scanning website, its forum provided a platform for fans and professionals (artists, editors of earlier series, retailers etc.) to meet and discuss all kinds of issues. Many projects were eventually launched from there, and to this day it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> fan talk and professional debate and most notably Kepregeny.net can be regarded as the main information gateway for all comics fans and professionals.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "B+". He {{argued that the}} episode was [...] "the best season finale cliffhanger the show ever did", and compared it to the second season finale [...] "Anasazi"; he noted that while the latter episode was [...] "pretty amazing", [...] "Requiem" [...] has [...] "a finality" [...] to it and a [...] "sense that nothing will ever be the same" [...] that made its cliffhanger ending work. VanDerWerff also wrote that the nods to the pilot episode helped to show how far the series had evolved in seven years. Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, gave the episode a largely positive review. Despite lamenting the loss of Fox Mulder, he noted that [...] "the truth is The X-Files has been a show like no other and 'Requiem' proved once again there truly <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> magic and beauty and love {{on the small screen}} and I am delighted to have witnessed it for seven seasons now." [...] Kessenich later named the episode one of the [...] "Top 25 Episode of All Time" [...] of The X-Files, ranking it at number 20.|$|E
500|$|The {{popularity}} of Hemingway's work {{depends on its}} themes of love, war, wilderness and loss, {{all of which are}} strongly evident in the body of work. These are recurring themes in American literature, and are quite clearly evident in Hemingway's work. Critic Leslie Fiedler sees the theme he defines as [...] "The Sacred Land"—the American West—extended in Hemingway's work to include mountains in Spain, Switzerland and Africa, and to the streams of Michigan. The American West is given a symbolic nod with the naming of the [...] "Hotel Montana" [...] in The Sun Also Rises and For Whom the Bell Tolls. [...] According to Stoltzfus and Fiedler, in Hemingway's work, nature <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> rebirth and rest; and it is where the hunter or fisherman might experience a moment of transcendence at the moment they kill their prey. Nature is where men exist without women: men fish; men hunt; men find redemption in nature. Although Hemingway does write about sports, such as fishing, Carlos Baker notes the emphasis is more on the athlete than the sport. At its core, much of Hemingway's work can be viewed in the light of American naturalism, evident in detailed descriptions such as those in [...] "Big Two-Hearted River".|$|E

Griffin responded, [...] "Our organization has already touched on that matter and converted a few to remembering that they are women first and a butch for fem secondly, so their attire should be that which society will accept.

2500|$|Lee was {{replaced}} in 1996 by Merrill J. Bateman. From 1996 to 1999, Bateman oversaw {{the expansion of}} the Harold B. Lee Library. He also strengthened the foundations of several buildings on campus in case of an earthquake. Later in his term, he began plans for the Joseph F. Smith Building, completed in 2004. All in all, Bateman was responsible for the building of 36 new buildings for the university both on and off campus, including the Barlow Center in Washington D. C.. This center <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> students to stay and also provide a BYU presence in the city. Athletics programs also saw development under Bateman. Under him, the women's softball team came into being. He was also one of several key college leaders who brought about the creation of the Mountain West Conference, which BYU's athletics program joined. Previously, BYU had been in the Western Athletic Conference. Bateman was instrumental in a push to rename [...] "Cougar Stadium", [...] "LaVell Edwards Stadium" [...] in 2000, in honor of former football coach LaVell Edwards. He also led a push among several universities to reverse an NCAA ruling that games could be scheduled on Sunday (an effort which was unsuccessful). Overall, sports programs flourished under Bateman's tenure. In the computing and technology area, Bateman directed a merging of BYU's computer systems with the LDS Church's, as well as enlarging the resources available to computing majors. A BYU satellite TV network also opened in 2000, under his leadership. Bateman was also president during the September 11th attacks in 2001. The planes crashed on a Tuesday, mere hours before the weekly devotional normally held at BYU. Previous plans for the devotional were altered, as Bateman led the student body in a prayer for peace.|$|E
