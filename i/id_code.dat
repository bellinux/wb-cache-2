5|$|Every runic {{inscription}} {{is shown}} with its <b>ID</b> <b>code</b> {{that is used}} in scholarly literature {{to refer to the}} inscription, and it is only obligatory to give the first two parts of it. The first part is one or two letters that represent the area where the runic inscription appears, e.g. U for Uppland, Sö for Södermanland and DR for Denmark. The second part represents the order in which the inscription is presented in official national publications (e.g. Sveriges runinskrifter). Thus U 73 means that the runestone was the 73rd runic inscription in Uppland that was documented in Sveriges runinskrifter. If the inscription was documented later than the official publication, it is listed according to the publication where it was first described, e.g. Sö Fv1954;20, where Sö represents Södermanland, Fv stands for the annual publication Fornvännen, 1954 is the year of the issue of Fornvännen and 20 is the page in the publication.|$|E

50|$|Due to {{concerns}} surrounding {{the return of}} clinically significant results to research participants {{in the context of}} translational projects, P3G has developed the DataTrust (DT) service. This service supports the process of re-contacting participants and returning individual-level results in translational research projects, when appropriate. The DataTrust (DT) proposes to provide P3G as an honest and independent, third party broker to act as the key holder of personal information and associated unique <b>ID</b> (<b>codes).</b> P3G-DT safeguards the independence of the research project team, while enhancing ethical compliance with privacy and confidentiality standards in the research setting.|$|R

In total, bentonites from 43 volcanic eruptions, of which six are new discoveries, were established in the Telychian of Estonia. Names and identification (<b>ID)</b> <b>codes</b> were assigned to the bentonites. The different distribution patterns of volcanic ash thicknesses indicate different source volcanoes. Lack of several bentonites near the transition between the Rumba and Velise formations and at the LlandoveryWenlock boundary indicates sedimentary hiatuses in the eastern part of the studied area...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This {{paper is}} about hiding RFID tag {{identifier}} (ID) using handheld device like a cellular phone. By modifying the tag ID of objects periodically or manually using cellular phone built-in a RFID reader chip {{or with a}} external RFID reader device, we can prevent other people from gathering the information related with objects querying information server (like an EPC IS) with a tag ID or deriving the information from tag <b>ID’s</b> <b>code</b> structure or tracking {{the location of the}} objects and the owner of the objects. In this paper, we use a cryptographic algorithm for modification and restoring of RFID tag ID, and for one original tag ID, there are several different temporary tag ID, periodically.

40|$|Conducting psychosocial {{research}} on the International Space Station (ISS) requires rigorous privacy precautions that exceed standard scientific human subject protocols. In our previous study involving crewmembers on Mir, and in our ongoing ISS work, special precautions were taken during each phase of the missions. Pre-flight, participants received detailed consent forms explaining that only group-level data would be presented, and they chose <b>ID</b> <b>codes</b> known only to them. In-flight, special procedures protected data during collection and transmission. Post-flight, our analytic strategy further masked participants’ identities, and participant representatives were invited to review manuscript drafts prior to publication. In this paper we describe lessons learned during our on-orbit studies and discuss their relation to maintaining privacy on studies of future long-duration space missions...|$|R
