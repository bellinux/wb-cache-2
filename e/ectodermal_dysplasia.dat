25|$|There is much {{discrepancy}} {{in the literature}} regarding {{the exact nature of}} the facial clefting involved in EEC. Some authors claim that the clefting involved in EEC is always cleft lip +/- palate and use this marker as a means of distinguishing EEC from other syndromes, such as AEC syndrome (ankyloblepharon, <b>ectodermal</b> <b>dysplasia,</b> and clefting) in which other types of clefting are found. Other authors include cleft palate only (CPO) in conjunction with ectrodactyly and <b>ectodermal</b> <b>dysplasia</b> as sufficient for a diagnosis of EEC.|$|E
25|$|The hypohydrotic {{symptoms}} of <b>ectodermal</b> <b>dysplasia</b> described above are evidenced {{not only in}} the skin of affected individuals, but also in their phonation and voice production. Because the vocal folds may not be as hydrated as is necessary during the adduction phase of vocal fold vibration (due to lack of lubrication), a complete seal may not be accomplished between the folds and mucosal wave movement may be disrupted. This results in air escapement between the folds and the production of breathy voice, which often accompanies the skin abnormalities of <b>ectodermal</b> <b>dysplasia.</b>|$|E

25|$|The <b>ectodermal</b> <b>dysplasia</b> {{associated}} with EEC syndrome arises from abnormalities in the embryonic ectoderm, as described above. Very early in embryonic development, the {{embryonic stem cells}} differentiate into three types of cells: the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. It is from these three types of cells that all body organs originate. In general terms, ectodermal cells generate the skin, spinal cord, and teeth (as well as the numerous derivatives mentioned above). Mesodermal cells generate blood vessels, muscle and bone, and endodermal cells generate the lungs, the digestive system and the urinary system.|$|E
25|$|Anodontia is a {{complete}} lack of tooth development, and hypodontia {{is a lack of}} some tooth development.

The absence of third molars is very common, occurring in 2023% of the population, followed in prevalence by the second premolar and lateral incisor. Hypodontia is often associated with the absence of a dental lamina, which is vulnerable to environmental forces, such as infection and chemotherapy medications, and is also associated with many syndromes, such as Down syndrome and Crouzon syndrome.|$|E

40|$|The <b>ectodermal</b> <b>dysplasias</b> {{include a}} complex and highly diverse group of {{heritable}} disorders that share in common developmental abnormalities of ectodermal derivatives. The broader definition of <b>ectodermal</b> <b>dysplasias</b> (as heritable disorders involving {{at least two of}} the ectodermal derivatives nails, teeth, hair, and eccrine sweat glands) encompasses 170 - 200 conditions. Some conditions included by this definition are relatively common; others are rare and, in some cases, family-specific. Classification of the <b>ectodermal</b> <b>dysplasias</b> has largely been approached by categorizing patterns of clinical findings (phenotypic grouping). In the last 2 decades great progress has been made in understanding the molecular pathogenesis and inter-relatedness of some of these conditions and a new consensus approach to classification that incorporates this new information is needed. A comprehensive and definitive classification of these disorders would be highly valuable for the many stakeholders in ED. As disease-specific molecular treatments are developed, accurate classification will assume greater importance in designing registries to enable rapid identification of those with rare disorders who may wish to participate in clinical trials. Ideally a working classification of such a disparate collection of conditions would have a design and architecture that would facilitate easy accessibility by each of the key stakeholder groups and would encourage enhanced interaction between these parties. Attaining this objective is a major challenge but is achievable. This article reviews the historical-clinical perspective and the impact of recent developments in molecular biology in the field.

This condition may be the result of allelic mutations at a single gene locus. Alternatively, incompletely penetrant non-allelic genes may show a synergistic effect as expected for a multifactorial trait with interacting gene products.
