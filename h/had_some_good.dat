5|$|In the 2013 Indian Premier League, Karthik <b>had</b> <b>some</b> <b>good</b> {{starts for}} the Mumbai Indians, {{in the early}} matches: in particular, when he scored a quick 86 against the Delhi Daredevils in their home match at the Wankhede Stadium. The Mumbai Indians {{went on to win}} their first IPL trophy this season with Karthik batting and wicket-keeping in all 19 of their matches. In almost all the matches he batted third and was seen as a key run getter for the team. He ended the tournament with 510 runs and was within the top 10 run scorers of the tournament.|$|E
5|$|In June 1937 the Old Vic company took up an {{invitation}} to perform Hamlet {{in the courtyard of}} the castle at Elsinore, where Shakespeare located the play. Olivier secured the casting of Leigh to replace Cherry Cottrell as Ophelia. Because of torrential rain the performance had to be moved from the castle courtyard to the ballroom of a local hotel, but the tradition of playing Hamlet at Elsinore was established, and Olivier was followed by, among others, Gielgud (1939), Redgrave (1950), Richard Burton (1954), Derek Jacobi (1979), Kenneth Branagh (1988) and Jude Law (2009). Back in London, the company staged Macbeth, with Olivier in the title role. The stylised production by Michel Saint-Denis was not well liked, but Olivier <b>had</b> <b>some</b> <b>good</b> notices among the bad. On returning from Denmark, Olivier and Leigh told their respective spouses about the affair and that their marriages were over; Esmond moved out of the marital house and in with her mother. After Olivier and Leigh made a tour of Europe in mid 1937 they returned to separate film projects—A Yank at Oxford for her and The Divorce of Lady X for him—and moved into a property together in Iver, Buckinghamshire.|$|E
5|$|While on tour in South Africa in 1927–28, Hammond did not {{dominate}} as expected. Still {{recovering from}} his illness, he was worn {{out from the}} strain of a long season. He showed good batting form, but once George Geary was injured, a strong but not fully representative side found itself short of bowling, forcing Hammond to play as an all-rounder. In all first-class matches on the tour, he scored 908 runs {{at an average of}} 47.78, and took 27 wickets at an average of 23.85. His Test debut came in the first match of the series, as he scored a quick 51 in his only innings and took five wickets for 36 runs in the South African second innings. At one point, he took three wickets for no runs and his bowling was described by Wisden as a key factor in an England victory. His best innings came in the third Test as he reached 90. He <b>had</b> <b>some</b> <b>good</b> bowling spells, and in the fourth Test he removed both South African openers. An innings of 66 in the fifth and final Test left him with 321 runs at an average of 40.12 in his debut series, while his 15 wickets cost 26.60 runs each. All of Hammond's batting appearances were at number four in the order; of his 140 career Test innings, 118 were at number three or four. The series was drawn 2–2.|$|E

25|$|The South African middle order {{collapsed}} due {{mostly to}} the bowling of Brett Lee, who took five wickets, four of which were bowled. Shaun Pollock <b>had</b> <b>some</b> <b>good</b> batting with several sixes {{but it was not}} enough. Australia received a bonus point because they won by more than 50 runs.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the club}} <b>had</b> <b>some</b> <b>good</b> results {{in its early}} seasons, it {{struggled}} {{for the most part}} and before the 1888 season, following a run of disastrous results, Derbyshire was demoted from first-class status, which was then {{based on the number of}} matches against other teams of similar standing. Derbyshire recovered first-class status in 1894 and rejoined the County Championship in 1895.|$|E
25|$|As {{evident from}} the scoreline, the Australian team greatly outclassed the Indians, who <b>had</b> <b>some</b> <b>good</b> {{individual}} performances to their credit. However, they did not put up much resistance as a team, with their batting failing to make any impression on the Australians. The only silver lining for India in terms of match results was their two victories in the First Class Matches.|$|E

This was the second time, and second consecutive time, that a student of Cho's got into the final of a major young player tournament and won. Atsushi Tsuruyama is a 6 dan in Japan and another one of Cho's students. Tetsuya Mitani was also a student of Cho, but later transferred to Takeo Ando. Even one of the best amateur players in the world, Dragoş Băjenaru was a student. Băjenaru placed 3rd in the latest edition of the European Ing Cup, the European version of the Ing Cup.|$|E

25|$|Heavy {{overnight}} rain {{made the}} pitch responsive to spin and Bradman seizing this opportunity, declared, setting the Indians {{a target of}} 337. The Indians fared poorly in the second innings, with only Gul Mohammad and Kanwar Rai Singh making any noteworthy contributions, scoring 28 and 24. Singh stuck around giving a few lust hits here and there, but unfortunately for India, they folded up at 125, a score which seemed probable when they lost half of their side with just 60 runs on the board. Noteworthy performers for Australia were Bradman, Morris, Johnston, Johnson and Hassett. The Indians <b>had</b> <b>some</b> <b>good</b> individual performances {{in the form of}} Mankad and Amarnath, the former putting up a good all-round show, while the latter, picking up a match haul of 7 for 130.|$|E
25|$|While the 1960s did {{result in}} some trophies and good Serie A {{finishes}} for Fiorentina, nobody {{believed that the}} club could challenge for the title. The 1968–69 season started with Milan as frontrunners, but on matchday 7, they lost to Bologna and were overtaken by Gigi Riva's Cagliari. Fiorentina, after an unimpressive start, then moved {{to the top of}} the Serie A, but the first half of their season finished with a 2–2 draw against Varese, leaving Cagliari as outright league leader. The second half of the season was a three-way battle between the three contending teams, Milan, Cagliari and Fiorentina. Milan fell away, instead focusing their efforts on the European Cup, and it seemed that Cagliari would retain top spot. After Cagliari lost against Juventus, however, Fiorentina took over at the top. The team then won all of their remaining matches, beating rivals Juve in Turin on the penultimate matchday to seal their second, and last, national title. In the European Cup competition the following year, Fiorentina <b>had</b> <b>some</b> <b>good</b> results, including a win in the Soviet Union against Dynamo Kyiv, but they were eventually knocked out in the quarter-finals after a 3–0 defeat in Glasgow to Celtic.|$|E

500|$|However, actress Kathleen Freeman {{stated that}} when people visited set of Singin' in the Rain to relate their {{experiences}} during the silent era, they would ask to speak with Kelly.

Stan <b>had</b> <b>some</b> <b>good</b> ideas and worked with Gene, {{but he was still}} the 'office boy' to Gene, in a sense, although Gene had great respect for him." [...] Kelly became more involved with the Singin' in the Rain script during its third draft, which was when its structure began to resemble the final version. Comparing Donen and Kelly's films as solo directors, Donen's were usually more critically acclaimed and financially successful than Kelly's films. Kelly's 1969 film Hello Dolly! is credited with effectively killing the Hollywood musical.|$|E

It was quite frightening - they had machine guns on the roof. I was also allowed to drive around the perimeter but if you {{got out of the}} car there was a loudspeaker warning you to keep away. There was not a chance of going in it, and I was delighted because I knew from going to the Bank of England vaults that gold isn't stacked very high and it's all underwhelming. It gave me the chance to show the biggest gold repository in the world as I imagined it, with gold going up to heaven. I came up with this cathedral-type design. I had a big job to persuade Cubby and the director Guy Hamilton at first." ...|$|E
