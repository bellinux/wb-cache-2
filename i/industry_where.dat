It {{operated}} {{this and other}} routes until its retirement in 1960, when it was donated to Chicago's Museum of Science and <b>Industry,</b> <b>where</b> it remains on public display.

5|$|Weston {{moved from}} Capitol to Columbia Records and, in 1950, Stafford {{followed}} suit. Content and very comfortable working with him, Stafford {{had had a}} clause inserted in her contract with Capitol stating that if Weston left that label, she would automatically be released from her obligations to them. When that happened, Capitol wanted Stafford to record eight more songs before December 15, 1950, and {{she found herself in}} the unusual situation of simultaneously working for two competing record companies, an instance that was very rare in an <b>industry</b> <b>where</b> musicians were seen as assets. In 1954, Stafford became the second artist after Bing Crosby to sell 25 million records for Columbia. She was presented with a diamond-studded disc to mark the occasion.|$|E
5|$|Wheels {{are prone}} to slipping—an {{inability}} to generate traction—on loose or slippery terrain. Slipping wastes energy and can potentially lead {{to a loss of}} control or becoming stuck, as with an automobile on mud or snow. This limitation of wheels {{can be seen in the}} realm of human technology: in an example of biologically inspired engineering, legged vehicles find use in the logging <b>industry,</b> <b>where</b> they allow access to terrain too challenging for wheeled vehicles to navigate. Tracked vehicles suffer less from slipping than wheeled vehicles, owing to their larger contact area with the ground—but they tend to have larger turning radii than wheeled vehicles, and they are less efficient and more mechanically complex.|$|E

5|$|Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), {{sometimes}} called by its DuPont name Teflon, represents 60–80% by {{mass of the}} world's fluoropolymer production. The largest application is in electrical insulation since PTFE is an excellent dielectric. It is also used in the chemical <b>industry</b> <b>where</b> corrosion resistance is needed, in coating pipes, tubing, and gaskets. Another major use is in PFTE-coated fiberglass cloth for stadium roofs. The major consumer application is for non-stick cookware. Jerked PTFE film becomes expanded PTFE (ePTFE), a fine-pored membrane sometimes referred to by the brand name Gore-Tex and used for rainwear, protective apparel, and filters; ePTFE fibers may be made into seals and dust filters. Other fluoropolymers, including fluorinated ethylene propylene, mimic PTFE's properties and can substitute for it; they are more moldable, but also more costly and have lower thermal stability. Films from two different fluoropolymers replace glass in solar cells.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, Braathens SAFE started {{flying to}} Ålesund {{and at the}} same time started flights along the West Coast. In 1959, Fokker F-27s were taken into use, and with the Herons taken out of service, Hamar, Farsund and Tønsberg were terminated. During 1960, the airline flew a single season to Sandefjord and Aalborg. The company also entered the {{domestic}} and international charter market during the 1960s, an <b>industry</b> <b>where</b> the airline would eventually grow to become a large Norwegian and Swedish contestant. Services to Bodø and Tromsø started in 1967, although only from Western Norway. Braathens' main domestic competitor was Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS), which operated all the primary domestic routes Braathens SAFE did not, in addition to the international routes. Braathens took Boeing 737-200s and Fokker F-28s into use in 1969; Kristiansund was first served in 1970 and Molde in 1972. From 1984, the airline also operated two Boeing 767s, although they were retired along with the F-28s were in 1986. Services to Longyearbyen started in 1987. From 1987, Braathens SAFE was allowed to make international scheduled flights on certain routes. In 1989, it opened a route to Billund, in 1991 to Malmö, Newcastle and London, and in 1993 to Murmansk. From 1989 to 1994, the airline replaced its fleet with Boeing 737-400 and -500s. From 1989 to 1994, Braathens Helikopter operated services on contract with oil companies to their oil platforms in the North Sea.|$|E
