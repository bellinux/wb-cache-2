50|$|In 2008, she {{translated}} <b>Junot</b> <b>Diaz's</b> Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, The Brief and Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao, into Spanish. The Dominican-American author's novel addresses many themes, including {{young adult}} sexuality and national identity, {{also present in}} Obejas' work. She's also translated work by Rita Indiana, Wendy Guerra, Adam Mansbach, Carlos Velazquez, F.G. Haghenbeck, and many others. She is the rare translator who can work {{in and out of}} both English and Spanish.|$|R
5000|$|All Summer in a Day is {{alluded to}} in a {{description}} of main character Oscar Wao, from <b>Junot</b> <b>Díaz's</b> The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao. [...] "Sucks {{a lot to be}} left out of adolescence, sort of like getting locked in the closet on Venus when the sun appears {{for the first time in}} a hundred years." [...] Although in Bradbury's All Summer in a Day, it comes out every seven years.|$|R
500|$|In 1997 Publishers Weekly {{described}} {{the work as}} [...] "an epic Latin American melodrama of lost identity, political violence and polymorphous sexuality", whose [...] "complex plotting is occasionally confusing", but with [...] "characterizations, dialogue and relationships [...] are vividly, emotionally engaging". [...] Charles Hatfield considered Poison River [...] "the apogee of Hernandez's art to date" [...] for [...] "wed formal complexity to thematic ambition". [...] Québécois cartoonist and comics critic [...] considered Poison River [...] "a major comics work of uncommon inspiration". [...] Dominican-American writer <b>Junot</b> <b>Díaz</b> stated he likely would not have become a writer {{if he had not}} read Poison River.|$|E
500|$|Cisneros often {{incorporates}} Spanish {{into her}} English writing, substituting Spanish words for English ones where {{she feels that}} Spanish better conveys the meaning or improves {{the rhythm of the}} passage. However, where possible she constructs sentences so that non-Spanish speakers can infer the meaning of Spanish words from their context. In Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories Cisneros writes: [...] "La Gritona. Such a funny name for such a lovely arroyo. But that's what they called the creek that ran behind the house." [...] Even if the English-speaking reader does not initially know that arroyo means creek, Cisneros soon translates {{it in a way that}} does not interrupt the flow of the text. She enjoys manipulating the two languages, creating new expressions in English by literally translating Spanish phrases. In the same book Cisneros writes: [...] "And at the next full moon, I gave light, Tía Chucha holding up our handsome, strong-lunged boy." [...] Previous sentences inform the reader that a baby is being born, but only a Spanish speaker will notice that [...] "I gave light" [...] is a literal translation of the Spanish [...] "dí a luz" [...] which means [...] "I gave birth." [...] Cisneros joins other Hispanic-American US writers such as Gloria Anzaldúa, Piri Thomas, Giannina Braschi, Gustavo Pérez Firmat, and <b>Junot</b> <b>Díaz,</b> who create playful linguistic hybrids of Spanish and English. Cisneros noted on this process: [...] "All of a sudden something happens to the English, something really new is happening, a new spice is added to the English language." [...] Spanish always has a role in Cisneros's work, even when she writes in English. As she discovered, after writing The House on Mango Street primarily in English, [...] "the syntax, the sensibility, the diminutives, the way of looking at inanimate objects" [...] were all characteristic of Spanish. For Cisneros, Spanish brings to her work not only colorful expressions, but also a distinctive rhythm and attitude.|$|E

40|$|The use of {{pop culture}} {{references}} in <b>Junot</b> <b>Diaz's</b> The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao serve to provide heroic legitimacy to the novel's characters. Social issues which have a nature particular to a specific culture become recognizable and mainstream through the use {{of pop culture}} references. The mechanism which facilitates recognition is the universal plot structure of the monomyth. The monomyth is pervasive throughout the novel as well as the pop culture references. The familiarity created by the monomyth allows for complex themes such as immigration, displacement and identity to be discussed...|$|R
40|$|In {{exploring}} <b>Junot</b> <b>Díaz’s</b> use of Spanglish, I {{propose that}} Díaz {{is driven by}} the anxiety of history—a phenomenon similar to the anxiety of influence, as articulated by Harold Bloom, but which focuses {{on the role of the}} Latino minority in this postmodern moment. I compare Díaz’s texts to Piri Thomas’s autobiography Down These Mean Streets, one of the original texts to utilize Spanglish, and Mumbo Jumbo by Ishmael Reed, a satirical novel about minority culture. Díaz’s vision of a future, Spanglish-speaking America is revealed to be the ultimate outcome of the anxiety of history’s influence on Díaz...|$|R

50|$|Paterson is {{the subject}} of William Carlos Williams' five-book epic poem Paterson, a {{cornerstone}} work of modern American poetry. Paterson is also mentioned in the twelfth line of Part 1 of Allen Ginsberg's poem Howl. In the novel On the Road by Ginsberg's friend Jack Kerouac, the protagonist Sal Paradise lives with his aunt in Paterson. Kerouac may have chosen Paterson as a stand-in for his hometown of Lowell, Massachusetts, also a mill town with a waterfall. Paterson is the setting of many of <b>Junot</b> <b>Diaz's</b> short stories and novels, including the Pulitzer Prize-winning The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao, and John Updike's 1997 novel In the Beauty of the Lilies.|$|R
5000|$|Cepeda's autobiography, “Bird of Paradise: How I Became Latina,” was {{published}} by Atria Books in March 2013. In a review for NBC Latino, Claudio Remeseira suggested that readers should see the book as “the non-fiction, female-gender companion to <b>Junot</b> <b>Díaz’s</b> ‘The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao’. Both are tales of self-discovery through the many racial, ethnic, and linguistic conflicting forces that {{lie at the heart}} of U.S. Latino identity, as well as the story of a personal struggle against a supposed fukú or ancestral curse that has haunted the author's families for generations." [...] The Huffington Post’s Dr. David J. Leonard wrote that “’Bird of Paradise’ is a book where hip-hop meets the human genome project.” ...|$|R
40|$|The {{connection}} between national and personal traumas {{is a key}} concern in two Dominican-American short-story cycles, Julia Alvarez’s How the García Girls Lost Their Accents (1991) and <b>Junot</b> <b>Díaz’s</b> This is How You Lose Her (2012). Both texts link the inability to establish long-lasting romantic relationships to the violent collective past of the Dominican Republic, but they do so very differently. With its regressive chronological structure, Alvarez’s narrative casts its characters as inescapable victims of a history destined to repeat itself. By contrast, Díaz eschews Alvarez’s etiological quest, highlighting the question of personal responsibility. Only marginally successful in rejecting traditional models of national identity, the protagonist-narrator of Lose Her continues the reconceptualization of Dominicanness begun in Díaz’s The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao (2007) ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, I {{will discuss}} magical realism as a postcolonial genre of {{resistance}} in Ana Castillo’s So Far from God, and <b>Junot</b> <b>Díaz’s</b> The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao, {{and whether or}} not labeling these novels as magical realism is a problematic form of exoticizing and other-ing. I compare these two novels—one written by a Chicana (Mexican-American) woman in 1993, the other written by a Dominican-American man in 2007 —to look at the similarities in the way they challenge US/European cultural and political dominance.

40|$|A project {{about the}} spaces that exist between {{literary}} characters, and a suggested method for their analysis. Drawing {{on the work}} of Wolfgang Iser and extending upon it, this project combines a literary fiction novel written from multiple perspectives with an exegetical enquiry about how Iser’s notion of spaces between sentences may be modified to analyse, and therefore write more effectively and successfully, the spaces between literary characters. Iser’s modified theories have been used to analyse <b>Junot</b> <b>Diaz’s</b> novel The Brief and Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao. The emphasis of the creative and theoretical work is to develop an understanding about how spaces between characters and the “affect” implicit within them may be consciously created and used by writers. This project aims to deliver to writers a model that may be used to “compose” spaces, and “compose” the sequencing of spaces...|$|R
40|$|In <b>Junot</b> <b>Díaz’s</b> The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao, {{the romantic}} {{failures}} of an overweight Dominican nerd {{are attributed to}} an all-encompassing curse that is passed through generations and across national borders. Intrinsically tied to the violent legacy of slavery, colonialism, greedy dictatorships, and political corruption, the curse, {{referred to as the}} fukú, {{is much more than a}} supernatural entity in the novel; the fukú and its antidote, zafa, function as conceptual mechanisms through which characters engage with their worlds and make sense of their diasporic experiences. By first elucidating the restrictive and liberating effects of the fukú and zafa, respectively, on the characters’ mentalities and then showing how these same dynamics are repeated in the language of the novel, this essay posits that the dialectic between the fukú and zafa reveal both the imprisoning and freeing effects of discourse and narrative in the construction of life stories...|$|R
