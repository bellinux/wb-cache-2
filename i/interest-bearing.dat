5|$|A fairly {{peculiar}} economic phenomenon {{occurred during}} the war in that the Confederate government issued both regular money notes and <b>interest-bearing</b> money, although the United States did issue Interest Bearing Notes during the war that were legal tender for most financial transactions. The circulation of the <b>interest-bearing</b> money and the convertibility of one kind of money into the other was enforced by fiat and Southern banks were threatened with a return to the gold standard if they did not cooperate. Because of the amount of Southern debt held by foreigners, to ease currency convertibility, in 1863 the Confederate Congress decided to adopt the gold standard, although actual convertibility was not to come into effect until 1879 (hence the law never went into effect, being supplanted by the Coinage Act of 1873 {{and the end of the}} Confederacy).|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Innovation Norway criticized Nordland County Municipality, who {{administrated}} the DA-funds, {{stating that}} both the grant and load to Glimt were illegal. Therefore, both were converted to an <b>interest-bearing</b> loan and were issued to Aspmyra Stadion instead of the club. The club is required to have positive equity to keep its license {{to play in the}} top two tiers. Because it was the majority shareholder of the stadium company, it filed consolidated accounts which also include the equity of Aspmyra Stadion AS. Thus, the consequence of Innovation Norway's proceedings was that the club risked ending up with a negative equity and could be relegated to the third tier. To secure it retained a positive equity, Glimt proposed selling the venue to the municipality.|$|E
5|$|Laffoon's {{administration}} {{was confronted by}} the economic difficulties of the Great Depression. While he proposed a number of improvements, money was not available in the state budget to implement his plans. In his first full year in office, he cut $11.5 million from the state budget, but it remained out-of-balance. The state issued additional <b>interest-bearing</b> warrants to cover its debts. In 1931, these warrants accounted for 24.2 percent of the state's receipts; by 1932, that number had climbed to 40.2 percent. In order to raise more funds, Laffoon proposed a 2 percent state sales tax in 1932. The proposal was extremely unpopular with merchants and private citizens, and it showed little promise of passing in the General Assembly. On March 2, 1932, a mob of 100 anti-tax protesters stormed the governor's mansion, damaging some items inside. In {{an attempt to get}} the tax passed, Laffoon agreed to seek only a 1 percent tax. The proposal passed the House, but a Senate committee refused to report it to the full chamber for a vote.|$|E
25|$|The {{nominal rate}} cannot be {{directly}} compared between loans with different compounding frequencies. Both the {{nominal interest rate}} and the compounding frequency are {{required in order to}} compare <b>interest-bearing</b> financial instruments.|$|E
25|$|Thiel, {{a founder}} of PayPal, has stated that PayPal is not a bank {{because it does not}} engage in fractional-reserve banking. Rather, PayPal's funds that have not been disbursed are kept in {{commercial}} <b>interest-bearing</b> checking accounts.|$|E
25|$|Interest rate risk: {{the risk}} that the {{relative}} value of an <b>interest-bearing</b> liability, such as a loan or a bond, will worsen due to an interest rate increase. Interest rate risks can be hedged using fixed-income instruments or interest rate swaps.|$|E
25|$|In its {{campaign}} against Riba in the 1980s {{the regime of}} General Muhammad Zia ul-Haq replacing <b>interest-bearing</b> savings accounts with PLS (profit-loss sharing) instruments in Pakistan's state banks. The government also introduced and encouraged such banks to adopt financing schemes based upon the principles of mudaraba and or musharaka.|$|E
25|$|Usmani {{stated that}} by complex {{mechanisms}} Sukuk {{had taken on}} the same characteristics as conventional <b>interest-bearing</b> bonds, as they do not return to investors more than a fixed percentage of the principal, based on interest rates, while guaranteeing the return of investors' principal at maturity. Usmani's estimate that 85% of all Sukuk in issuance were not Shariah-compliant {{was based on the}} existence of guaranteed returns and/or repurchase obligations from the issuer—a violation of shariah.|$|E
25|$|In November 1997, Mitsubishi hired Katsuhiko Kawasoe {{to replace}} Takemune Kimura as company president. Kawasoe {{unveiled}} an aggressive restructuring program that aimed {{to cut costs}} by ¥350billion in three years, reduce personnel by 1,400, and return the company to profitability by 1998. But while the program had some initial success, the company's sales were still stagnant as the Asian economy continued to sputter. In 1999, Mitsubishi was forced once again to skip dividend payments. Its <b>interest-bearing</b> debt totalled ¥1.7trillion.|$|E
25|$|Money value fluctuates over time: $100 {{today has}} a {{different}} value than $100 in five years. This is because one can invest $100 today in an <b>interest-bearing</b> bank account or any other investment, and that money will grow/shrink due to the rate of return. Also, if $100 today allows the purchase of an item, {{it is possible that}} $100 will not be enough to purchase the same item in five years, because of inflation (increase in purchase price).|$|E
25|$|Papers {{were filed}} in Delaware on June 2, 1922, to legally {{incorporate}} the new entity, {{to be known}} as the Russian-American Industrial Corporation (RAIC). Funds for the project were to be raised by having union members purchase capital stock in RAIC, priced at $10/share. Sales of stock were not packaged as a de facto donation but rather as an <b>interest-bearing</b> investment, the principal of which was to be insured by Lloyds of London. An office for the project was maintained at 31 Union Square, Room 902, in New York City.|$|E
25|$|Sharia {{was perhaps}} most famous for {{calling for the}} {{abolition}} of <b>interest-bearing</b> banks, hadd penalties such as flogging and amputation for alcohol consumption, theft, fornication, adultery and other crimes. Hadd penalties have been criticized by Westernized Muslims as cruel and in violation of international human rights but Maududi argued that any cruelty was far outweighed by the cruelty in the West that resulted from the absence of these punishments, {{and in any case}} would not be applied until Muslims fully understood the teachings of their faith and lived in an Islamic state.|$|E
25|$|For an <b>interest-bearing</b> security, {{coupon rate}} is {{the ratio of}} the annual coupon amount (the coupon paid per year) per unit of par value, whereas current yield is {{the ratio of the}} annual coupon divided by its current market price. Yield to {{maturity}} is a bond's expected internal rate of return, assuming it will be held to maturity, that is, the discount rate which equates all remaining cash flows to the investor (all remaining coupons and repayment of the par value at maturity) with the current market price.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to these complex economic conditions, thrift managers resorted to several innovations, such as alternative mortgage instruments and <b>interest-bearing</b> checking accounts, {{as a way to}} retain funds and generate lending business. Such actions allowed the industry to continue to record steady asset growth and profitability during the 1970s even though the actual number of thrifts was falling. Despite such growth, there were still clear signs that the industry was chafing under the constraints of regulation. This was especially true with the large S in the western United States that yearned for additional lending powers to ensure continued growth. Despite several efforts to modernize these laws in the 1970s, few substantive changes were enacted.|$|E
25|$|Large-denomination {{currency}} (i.e., banknotes with a {{face value}} of $500 or higher) {{had been used in}} the United States since the late 18th century. The first $500 note was issued by the Province of North Carolina, authorized by legislation dated May 10, 1780. Virginia quickly followed suit and authorized the printing of $500 and $1,000 notes on October 16, 1780 and $2,000 notes on May 7, 1781. High-denomination treasury notes were issued, for example during the War of 1812 ($1,000 notes authorized by an act dated June 30, 1812). During the American Civil War Confederate currency included $500 and $1,000 notes. During the Federal banknote issuing period (1861 to present), the earliest high-denomination notes included three-year <b>Interest-bearing</b> notes of $500, $1,000, and $5,000, authorized by Congress on July 17, 1861. In total, 11 different types of U.S. currency were issued in high-denomination notes across nearly 20 different series dates.|$|E
25|$|While lucrative, the {{revenues}} realized {{from the three}} factories should not be overemphasized: while the Medici often had invested more than 7,900 gold florins in the three factories in 1458, for example, the sum invested in banks in 1458 was more than 28,800and that figure is low, for it excludes the Rome branch serving the Pope, the Medici's <b>interest-bearing</b> deposits in their branches, and also omits any accounting of several years' profit which were inaccessible (since the relevant partnerships {{had not yet been}} dissolved; this may seem to be a flaw in the system, but it built up capital in a branch and allowed it to lend out more than it had been incorporated with). Part of the reason for maintaining these factories when the funds could have been more profitably invested in the banks or trade could have been social: it seems to have a bit of a Florentine tradition to run such factories to provide employment for the poora social obligation, as it were.|$|E
25|$|Within {{the sense}} of the Constitution, bills of credit signify a paper medium of {{exchange}} intended to circulate between individuals, and between the Government and individuals, for the ordinary purposes of society. It is immaterial whether the quality of legal tender is imparted to such paper. <b>Interest-bearing</b> certificates in denominations up to ten dollars that were issued by loan offices established by the State of Missouri and made receivable in payment of taxes or other moneys due to the State, and in payment of the fees and salaries of state officers, were held to be bills of credit whose issuance was banned by this section. The States are not forbidden, however, to issue coupons receivable for taxes, nor to execute instruments binding themselves to pay money at a future day for services rendered or money borrowed. Bills issued by state banks are not bills of credit; it is immaterial that the State is the sole stockholder of the bank, that the officers of the bank were elected by the state legislature, or that the capital of the bank was raised by the sale of state bonds.|$|E
25|$|On September 18, 2013, it was {{reported}} that Sega Sammy Holdings had won a bid to acquire Index for 14 billion yen. Sega Sammy Holdings denied taking over Index Corporation at first, however it announced later that day that Index Corporation would sell the digital game business, contents and solution business, and amusement business to Sega Dream Corporation (株式会社セガドリーム), a subsidiary of Sega Corporation established on September 5, 2013 effective on November 1, 2013. The sales covered fixed assets and intellectual property assets of the announced operations, which included Atlus Holding, Inc. (parent company of Index Digital Media, Inc.), Tiger Mob Limited, Index Corp (Thailand) Ltd., Mobi Town Ltd. However, liabilities including <b>interest-bearing</b> debts would not be taken over. On November 1, 2013, Sega announced that it will rename its subsidiary, Sega Dream Corporation, to Index Corporation (株式会社　インデックス). On February 18, 2014, Sega and Index Corporation announced the separation of Index Corporation's contents and solution businesses into a new subsidiary under the name 'Index Corporation' (株式会社インデックス), while renaming the 'old' Index Corporation and its remaining digital game business division into 'Atlus' (株式会社アトラス), effective on April 1, 2014. The new Atlus would also include the foreign subsidiary Index Digital Media, Inc., which would be renamed to Atlus U.S.A., Inc. at the effective establishment day of the new Atlus.|$|E
25|$|Some {{individuals}} and media sources expressed {{concern over the}} Qatari involvement. Because Qatari Diar was involved, the project was required {{to adhere to the}} restrictions of Sharia, or Islamic law. This included a ban on collecting interest. Not only did Qatari Diar provide cash (not <b>interest-bearing</b> loans) for the project, banks were not initially permitted as tenants. There were concerns that the sale of alcohol, pork, or tobacco as well as businesses such as gambling, hotels, movie theaters, and nude entertainment would also be prohibited. The Hines-Archstone group said it had never intended to allow banks, gambling, or liquor stores, and although it was seeking a wine bar (or similar business) as a tenant the Qataris said their interpretation of Sharia permitted such an establishment. The Qataris also said restaurants would be able to serve liquor and pork, because the sale of such items was not a restaurant's primary business. Automated teller machines would also be permitted, and the agreement between Hines-Archstone and Qatari Diar did not bar a bank as a tenant in the future. Concern over the Qatari role in CityCenterDC was expressed by the conservative think tank Center for Security Policy and by Pamela Geller, author of the popular conservative blog Atlas Shrugs, both of whom believed that Islamic law was being imposed on Americans without their consent. Conservative concern over the project was also reported in the Washington City Paper.|$|E
500|$|As is usual {{practice}} with encyclicals, the text derived its title from the Latin opening words, which translate into English as [...] "It has hardly reached".

500|$|Chambers's {{political}} opinions {{after the war}} were at first concerned with government debt. In an 1868 article in the Cleburne Chronicle, Chambers argued against all <b>interest-bearing</b> national debts, and for a general policy of inflationism. Running as a Democrat, he was elected an alderman of Cleburne and was a delegate to Texas's constitutional convention of 1875. The proposed constitution that emerged was primarily an attempt to reverse the changes made by Republicans during Reconstruction. Chambers opposed its adoption, not for that reason, but because [...] "while taxation was unequally thrown upon property alone, unqualified suffrage was given to every man". He also opposed the homestead exemption, [...] "which protect the debtor class from the just demands of the creditor class." [...] Nevertheless, the constitution was adopted by a two-to-one majority.|$|E
500|$|With the {{financial}} crisis abated, many in Congress wanted the greenbacks to be withdrawn from circulation. The public had never seen greenbacks as equivalent to specie, and by 1866 they circulated at a considerable discount, although their value had risen {{since the end of}} the war. Hugh McCulloch, the Treasury Secretary under Lincoln and Johnson, believed the notes were an emergency measure only and thought they should be gradually withdrawn. McCulloch proposed a bill, the Contraction Act, to convert some of the greenbacks from notes redeemable in bonds to <b>interest-bearing</b> notes redeemable in coin. Most Senate Finance Committee members had no objection, and Sherman found himself alone in opposition to it, believing that withdrawing greenbacks from circulation would contract the money supply and harm the economy. Sherman instead favored leaving the existing notes in circulation and letting the growth in population catch up to the growth in money supply. He suggested an amendment that would instead just allow the Treasury to redeem the notes for lower-interest bonds, now that the government's borrowing costs had decreased. Sherman's amendment was voted down, and the Contraction Act passed; greenbacks would be gradually withdrawn, but those still circulating would be redeemable for the high-interest bonds as before. In his memoirs, Sherman called this law [...] "the most injurious and expensive financial measure ever enacted by Congress," [...] as the continued high-interest payments it required [...] "added fully $300,000,000 of interest" [...] to the national debt.|$|E

2500|$|In {{order to}} finance the War of 1812, Congress {{authorized}} the issuance of Treasury Notes, <b>interest-bearing</b> short-term debt {{that could be used}} to pay public dues. While they were intended to serve as debt, they did function [...] "to a limited extent" [...] as money. Treasury Notes were again printed to help resolve the reduction in public revenues resulting from the Panic of 1837 and the Panic of 1857, as well as to help finance the Mexican–American War and the Civil War.|$|E

2500|$|The idea of debt {{dates back}} to the ancient world, as {{evidenced}} for example by ancient Mesopotamian [...] city clay tablets recording <b>interest-bearing</b> loans. There is little consensus among scholars as to when corporate stock was first traded. Some see the key event as the Dutch East India Company's founding in 1602, while others point to earlier developments. Economist Ulrike Malmendier of the University of California at Berkeley argues that a share market existed as far back as ancient Rome. One of Europe's oldest stock exchanges is the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (...) established in 1585 in Frankfurt am Main.|$|E

Newly minted lawyer Pepper lost the case brought on behalf of Franklin's heirs in 1890, but learned [...] "in any human system for the administration of justice {{there must be a}} reserved judicial right to refuse in exceptional cases to stretch beyond the breaking point a legal principle that is sound enough for everyday use." [...] Five decades later, the Orphans Court (which was found to lack jurisdiction in the original case) appointed him Master to determine question under Franklin's will and thus facilitate the administration of the trust which as a youthful advocate he had tried to set aside.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2005, the Dow Jones Indexes in New York City and RHB Securities in Kuala Lumpur {{teamed up}} to launch a new [...] "Islamic Malaysia Index"—a {{collection}} of 45 stocks representing Malaysian companies that comply {{with a variety of}} Sharia-based requirements. For example, total debt, cash plus <b>interest-bearing</b> securities and accounts receivables must each be less than 33% of the trailing 12-month average capitalization. Also, [...] "gambling" [...] on derivatives and options, and on investing in firms that make pornography or pork are also unacceptable. Islamic bonds, or sukuk, use asset returns to pay investors to comply with the religion's ban on interest and are currently traded privately on the over-the-counter market.

2500|$|In the past, savers {{looking to}} keep their coins and {{valuables}} in safekeeping depositories deposited gold and silver at goldsmiths, receiving in exchange a note for their deposit (see Bank of Amsterdam). These notes gained acceptance as a medium of exchange for commercial transactions and thus became an early form of circulating paper money. As the notes were used directly in trade, the goldsmiths observed that people would not usually redeem all their notes at the same time, and they saw the opportunity to invest their coin reserves in <b>interest-bearing</b> loans and bills. This generated income for the goldsmiths but left them with more notes on issue than reserves with which to pay them. A process was started that altered {{the role of the}} goldsmiths from passive guardians of bullion, charging fees for safe storage, to interest-paying and interest-earning banks. [...] Thus fractional-reserve banking was born.|$|E
2500|$|Explanations for {{why some}} Islamic {{scholars}} judge bank interest permissible include {{the tendency for}} rulers to get the fatwas they want on [...] "key policy issues" [...] from [...] "official" [...] ulama [...] "whose task it is to legitimize" [...] rulers' policies. [...] Egyptian President Anwar Sadat obtained a fatwa from the Sheikh of al-Azhar ruled that <b>interest-bearing</b> treasury bonds were consistent with Islamic law. [...] More recently the mufti of Egypt, Dr. Muhammad Sayyid Tantawy issued several fatawa permitting bank interest in 1991. In 1997 Shaykh Nasr Farid Wasil (Grand Mufti of Dar al-Ifta al-Misriyyah at the time) also declared bank interest permissible provided the money was invested in halal avenues: [...] "there {{is no such thing}} as an Islamic or non-Islamic bank. So let us stop this controversy about bank interest." [...] Dr Abd-al-Munim Al-Nimr, an ex-minister of 'Awqaf in Egypt, publicly stated that banking interest [...] cannot be considered riba.|$|E
2500|$|The first <b>{{interest}}-bearing</b> War Loan {{was issued}} in November 1914 at {{an interest rate}} of 3.5%, to be redeemed at par in 1925–28. It raised £; £ at face value as it was issued at a 5% discount. [...] It was revealed in 2017 that public subscriptions amounted to £91m, and the balance had been subscribed by the Bank of England, under the names of then governor, John Gordon Nairne, and his deputy Ernest Harvey. [...] It was followed by £ of a second War Loan in June 1915, at 4.5%. £ of this was accounted for by conversion of the 3.5% issue, and a further £ by holders of 2.5% and 2.75% Consols, who were also allowed to transfer to the higher interest rate. The government also pledged that if they issued War Loans at even higher interest, holders of the 4.5% bonds might also convert to the new rate. In his memoirs Lloyd George stated his regret that his successor Reginald McKenna increased the interest rate {{at a time when}} investors had few alternatives. Not only did it directly increase the nation's annual interest payments by £ but it meant interest rates were higher throughout the economy during the post-war depression.|$|E
