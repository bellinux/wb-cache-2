5000|$|The SIGAP {{strategy}} (Geographic Information Systems for Protected Areas /Participatory Action) is {{a research}} methodology that adopts cartographic semiosis and tests its actual range of application. It takes up concepts presented by international agencies - such as [...] "sustainability", [...] "conservation" [...] participation” - and turns them into operational tools for territorial and environmental planning. Tested in various national and international contexts with regard {{to a variety of}} issues (migration, environmental protection, landscape planning, tourism systems, urban regeneration, etc.), the SIGAP methodology deploys the typical range of geography-based competences in the field of applied research. As such it involves all stages of analysis: the adoption of a theory informing land methodology; interaction with local inhabitants for the reading of data; construction of interpretative models and their cartographic visualization. In each of these stages, cartography takes on different capacities depending on the goal to be pursued. The final product is an <b>interactive</b> <b>multimedia</b> <b>system</b> GIS (for example: Multimap and Orobiemap), which becomes as an invaluable tool for field research, for the implementation of intervention strategies, for the processing and circulation of data.Participatory mapping systems play an essential role in this context, because they can recover the role of local communities and produce cartographic representations that take account of local interests. According to the technology involved and the level of participation entailed, these systems may include: i) participatory mapping, carried out by local communities at the request of an external party; ii) Community Integrated GIS - or CIGIS, built and operated by actors outside the community but including data collected through participatory methodologies; iii) Public Participation GIS - PPGIS), made and used directly by local communities in an exchange with local administrators or supervising agencies. The latter, based on WebGIS technology, fall within the realm of [...] "cybercartography" [...] or “open” digital mapping systems that allow users to interact, by promoting social projects and processes (Geomatics and Cartographic Research Centre).|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The {{concepts}} of sensor recycling and re-use offer a new developmental methodology for both centralised and network-based <b>interactive</b> <b>multimedia</b> <b>systems</b> and <b>multimedia</b> art applications.

40|$|Research {{has shown}} that the design and {{creation}} of interactive multimedia systems is a difficult and challenging task. Most interactive multimedia systems differ from conventional computer systems by being functionally more complex and by addressing a wider and broader range of inexperienced or novice users. The increased complexity in functionality is often a result of integration, time variation, and navigation. Furthermore, years of research within software engineering shows that improvements in software design processes require systematic work practices that involve well-founded methods. This paper reports from an empirical study of a conventional software analysis and design for the design of an <b>interactive</b> <b>multimedia</b> <b>system.</b> The primary purpose of the study is to investigate software engineering concepts for the design of interactive multimedia systems. The actual activities and concepts of the method are empirically evaluated against a typical desktop-based <b>interactive</b> <b>multimedia</b> <b>system</b> and weakness and strength of the analysis and design are discovered. It is concluded that more software engineering concepts are not well suited for interactive multimedia systems design. The main reason is that more of the concepts are intended for the analysis and design of work processes in a given, specific work environment. However, the rigid focus on work processes and tasks is useless since the complexity of the future system is not hidden in work tasks. The challenge of designing a coherent and affective <b>interactive</b> <b>multimedia</b> <b>system</b> lacks conceptual support and foundation. It is indicated that future analysis and design methods need to address other aspects of systems design than previous methods. 1...|$|E
