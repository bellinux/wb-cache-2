WEC was forthcoming with information relating to practices, procedures, and surface scan results. Scans performed by the WEC technician were extremely thorough and methodical. The WEC and ORAU technicians identified the same areas of elevated activity with comparable detector responses. WEC sampling of re-use soils, waste soils, sediments, and groundwater were conducted under ORAU observation. The sampling efforts observed by ORAU were performed in accordance with site-specific procedures and in a manner sufficient to provide quality supporting data. Three observations were made during groundwater sampling activities. First, the water level indicator was re-used without submitting rinse blank. Second, bubbles created during tubing extraction could indicate the presence of volatilized organic compounds. Third, samplers did not use a photo ionization detector prior to sample collection to indicate the presence of volatile organic vapors. Results of split samples indicated a high level of comparability between the WEC and ORAU/ORISE radiological laboratories. Analytical practices and procedures appear to be sufficient in providing quality radiochemical data. All concentrations from the Soil Re-Use Area and sediment samples are below Uniform radionuclide-specific derived concentration guideline level (DCGL{sub W}) limits; thus, comparisons to the less conservative stratified geometry were not required.

This thesis is a detailed study of the manner in which <b>in-process</b> <b>inspection</b> can be organised so that process flaws that subsequently result in defects can be eliminated or minimised. The quality management system and the inspection methods in force at Lola are thus subjected to intensive scrutiny so as to identify opportunities for improvement. A review of relevant literature on quality management, continuous improvement, mistake-proofing and zero defect initiatives helped map out a methodology for the research. The literature has also looked at the human issues that influence quality and inspection methods. The approach to the study has been to establish quality performance in the past and at present, establish quality attitudes and evaluate inspection methods. Visual inspection is the widely used method of inspection within the industry and instrument aided methods are still an area for research. Ways in which defects may be prevented from occurring and analysing the defects when they occur so as to get to the root causes have been suggested. This study has highlighted the need to adhere to standard operating procedures which account for errors that are avoidable. Motivation and inspiration can only be cultivated into workers through recognition and rewards. Employee engagement is very crucial and workers need to be supported with focussed training and appropriate working aids. Recommendations have been made on involving workers right from the design stage through the manufacturing process right to the customer. Customer requirements will need to be executed with certainty and all necessary information deemed useful will must be input at the design stage. <b>In-process</b> <b>inspection</b> must take a holistic approach i. e. both horizontal and vertical inspection.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model to}} describe {{the evolution of the}} roughness profile machined by barrel finishing (BF) operation. It is based on the measure of the material removal (MR) and on the assumptions that no plastic deformation and cutting of peak take place. In order to obtain these information, a morphological procedure has been developed based on the finding of a representative peak of the profile. By this way, it is possible to overcome the common problem of repositioning the instrument on a specific point of the surface, especially if an action takes place. The measurements taken on specimens machined in different conditions satisfied the assumptions and confirmed the capability of the model to predict roughness attainable. An interesting result has been the constant MR per working time. The analysis has been carried out by means of statistical approach demonstrating the reliability of the model.

40|$|AbstractDimensional {{measurement}} of work piece {{in between the}} manufacturing process is an essential method to achieve the precision components. The machine tool probing system can measure machined features of work piece placed on the machine table after partial or final machining operation. The in-process machine tool probing system is helpful in minimising the lead time of component by eliminating the unloading time on the machine and loading and inspection time on the measuring instrument. It also improve the part quality through process control. In this research, the component inspection is performed by optical machine tool probe when position into the spindle of CNC milling machine. The relative movement between the probe and job are programmed by developing a CNC part program. The probe touches the machined surface as per the program codes and the optical machine interface (Transceiver) receives signal data through infrared optical waves and these signals transformed into the CNC controller through wired network. The CNC controller displays the data points on the screen. These data points were transferred into CAD system for generating lines, curves and thereafter surfaces and these generated surfaces were analysed against CAD model of the designed component for dimensional evaluation.

A new fringe projection profilometry system is being developed, which is capable of performing the inspection of filigree tool geometries, e. g. gearing elements with tip radii of 0. 2 mm, inside forming machines of the sheet-bulk metal forming process. Compact gradient-index rod lenses with a diameter of 2 mm allow for a compact design of the sensor head, which is connected to a base unit via flexible high-resolution image fibers with a diameter of 1. 7 mm. The base unit houses a flexible DMD based LED projector optimized for fiber coupling and a CMOS camera sensor.

There are different strategies {{to deal with the}} need for construction inspection resources and they may include strategies such as outsourcing the inspection of construction activities and using quality control and quality assurance certification programs to reduce the need for <b>in-process</b> <b>inspection.</b> One strategy that could reduce the inspection workload is prioritizing construction activities for inspection. However, reducing the number of inspections also has risks, such as functional failures and reduced design life, if defects are not identified before the work is covered. Thus, available inspection resources should be allocated to the activities with significant risk consequences due to reduced inspection. The objective of this study was to: (1) evaluate the current inspection practices of INDOT and (2) develop a risk-based inspection protocol to facilitate efficient allocation of available inspection resources to minimize the risks associated with reduced inspection. First, the current inspection practices implemented by INDOT, other State Departments of Transportation, and consulting firms were identified and compared. The comparison between the inspection practices revealed that there is consistency between INDOT’s and consultants’ and other State Departments of Transportation’s inspection practices. To develop a risk-based inspection protocol, first, the risk consequences associated with reduced inspection were identified for different transportation construction activities, based on the data collected from 20 site visits to INDOT projects. These risk consequences include short and long-term functional failures, reduced design life, reduced safety, and increased maintenance cost. Based on data collected from 23 state Departments of Transportation, 58 engineers and inspectors from the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT), and 20 inspection consultants in the Midwest, the subjective perceived probabilities associated with the occurrence of each risk consequence were encoded using fuzzy analysis. Using these subjective probabilities, the risk impacts due to reduced inspection were derived. The construction activities subsequently were prioritized based on the risk impacts associated with reduced inspection into five priority levels: high, medium-high, medium, medium-low, and low. The greater the risk impacts were due to reduced inspection, the higher the priority would be for inspection of that activity. The study also included identification of value added of inspection and the critical items to be watched for different activities related to transportation construction. Deliverables of this project include: (1) an inspection protocol, (2) an inspection staffing guide and (3) a list of pay items whose documentation requirements need to be modified to enhance the documentation process. The inspection protocol created in this study could assist INDOT in efficient allocation of inspection resources to construction activities...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{demands from}} end {{users in the}} fields of optics, defence, automotive, medical, aerospace, etc. for high {{precision}} 3 D miniaturized components and microstructures from a range of materials have driven the development in micro and nano machining and changed the manufacturing realm. Conventional manufacturing processes such as chemical etching and LIGA are found unfavourable or limited due to production time required and have led mechanical micro machining to grow further. Mechanical micro machining is an ideal method to produce high accuracy micro components and micro milling is the most flexible enabling process and is thus able to generate a wider variety of complex micro components and microstructures. Ultraprecision micromilling machine tools are required so as to meet the accuracy, surface finish and geometrical complexity of components and parts. Typical manufacturing requirements are high dimensional accuracy being better than 1 micron, flatness and roundness better than 50 nm and surface finish ranging between 10 and 50 nm. Manufacture of high precision components and parts require very intricate material removal procedure. There are five key components that include machine tools, cutting tools, material properties, operation variables and environmental conditions, which constitute in manufacturing high quality components and parts. End users assess the performance of a machine tool based on the dimensional accuracy and surface quality of machined parts including the machining time. In this thesis, the emphasis is on the design and development of a control system for a 5 -axis bench-type ultraprecision micromilling machine- Ultra-Mill. On the one hand, the developed control system is able to offer high motion and positioning accuracy, dynamic stiffness and thermal stability for motion control, which are essential for achieving the machining accuracy and surface finish desired. On the other hand, the control system is able to undertake <b>in-process</b> <b>inspection</b> and condition monitoring of the machine tool and process. The control of multi-axis precision machines with high-speed and high-accuracy motions and positioning are desirable to manufacture components with high accuracy and complex features to increase productivity and maintain machine stability, etc. The development of the control system has focused on fast, accurate and robust positioning requirements at the machine system design stage. Apart from the mechanical design, the performance of the entire precision systems is greatly dependent on diverse electrical and electronics subsystems, controllers, drive instruments, feedback devices, inspection and monitoring system and software. There are some variables that dynamically alter the system behaviour and sensitivity to disturbance that are not ignorable in the micro and nano machining realm. In this research, a structured framework has been developed and integrated to aid the design and development of the control system. The framework includes critically reviewing {{the state of the art}} of ultraprecision machining tools, understanding the control system technologies involved, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of various control system methods for ultraprecision machines, understanding what is required by end-users and formulating what actually makes a machine tool be an ultraprecision machine particularly from the control system perspective. In the design and development stage, the possession of mechatronic know-how is essential as the design and development of the Ultra-Mill is a multidisciplinary field. Simulation and modelling tool such as Matlab/Simulink is used to model the most suitable control system design. The developed control system was validated through machining trials to observe the achievable accuracy, experiments and testing of subsystems individually (slide system, tooling system, monitoring system, etc.). This thesis has successfully demonstrated the design and development of the control system for a 5 -axis ultraprecision machine tool- Ultra-Mill, with high performance characteristics, fast, accurate, precise, etc. for motion and positioning, high dynamic stiffness, robustness and thermal stability, whereby was provided and maintained by the control system.
