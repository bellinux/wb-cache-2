A main factor is how long it takes the ventricles to fill—if the ventricles contract faster, then there is less time to fill and the preload will be less. Preload can also be affected by a person's blood volume. The force of each contraction of the heart muscle is proportional to the preload, described as the Frank-Starling mechanism. This states that the force of contraction is directly proportional to the <b>initial</b> <b>length</b> of muscle fiber, meaning a ventricle will contract more forcefully, the more it is stretched.|$|E

The optimal performance of PRQT can be achieved with a proper choice of the <b>initial</b> prefix <b>length</b> according to the tag set size. In this paper, we propose an <b>initial</b> prefix <b>length</b> adaptation algorithm for PRQT protocol when the tag set size is unknown before identification. The algorithm starts with the setting of a small <b>initial</b> prefix <b>length</b> l followed by the polling of all 2 l prefixes. The <b>initial</b> prefix <b>length</b> is then increased repeatedly until the collision ratio satisfies a prescribed condition. We derive the optimal increment step size and the respective sequence of decision thresholds. Simulation results show that PRQT with <b>initial</b> prefix <b>length</b> adaptation can significantly reduce the expected tag read time for all range of tag set size {{when compared to the}} use of Query-Tree protocol.

The shells are analyzed with a nonlinear shell analysis code that accurately accounts for global and local structural response phenomena. Results are presented for internal pressure and for axial compression loads. The effect of <b>initial</b> crack <b>length</b> on the initiation of stable crack growth and unstable crack growth in typical shells subjected to internal pressure loads is predicted using geometrically nonlinear elastic-plastic finite element analyses and the crack-tip-opening angle (CTOA) fracture criterion. The results of these analyses and of the experiments indicate that the pressure required to initiate stable crack growth and unstable crack growth in a shell subjected to internal pressure loads decreases as the <b>initial</b> crack <b>length</b> increases. The effects of crack length on the prebuckling, buckling and postbuckling responses of typical shells subjected to axial compression loads are also described.

40|$|Frogs {{are capable}} of {{impressive}} feats of jumping and swimming. Recent work has shown that anuran hind limb muscles can operate at lengths longer than the optimal length. To address the implications of muscle operating length on muscle power output and swimming mechanics, we built a robotic frog hind limb model based upon Xenopus laevis. The model simulated the force-length and force-velocity properties of vertebrate muscle, within the skeletal environment. We tested three muscle starting lengths, representing long, optimal and short starting lengths. Increasing starting length increased maximum muscle power output by 27 % from 98. 1 W kg 1 when muscle begins shortening from the optimal length, to 125. 1 W kg 1 when the muscle begins at longer <b>initial</b> <b>lengths.</b> Therefore, longer starting lengths generated greater hydrodynamic force for extended durations, enabling faster swimming speeds of the robotic frog. These swimming speeds increased from 0. 15 m s 1 at short <b>initial</b> muscle <b>lengths,</b> to 0. 39 m s 1 for the longest <b>initial</b> <b>lengths.</b> Longer starting lengths were able to increase power as the muscle's force-length curve was better synchronized with the muscle's activation profile. We further dissected the underlying components of muscle force, separating force-length versus force-velocity effects, showing a transition from force-length limitations to force-velocity limitations as starting length increased. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Hill-type muscle {{models are}} often used in muscle {{simulation}} studies {{and also in the}} design and virtual prototyping of functional electrical stimulation systems. These models have to behave in a sufficiently realistic manner when recruitment level and contractile element (CE) length change continuously. For this reason, most previous models have used instantaneous CE length in the muscle’s force vs. length (F-L) relationship, but thereby neglect the instability problem on the descending limb (i. e. region of negative slope) of the F-L relationship. Ideally CE <b>length</b> at <b>initial</b> recruitment should be used but this requires a multiple-motor-unit muscle model to properly account for different motor-units having different <b>initial</b> <b>lengths</b> when recruited. None of the multiple-motor-unit models reported in the literature have used <b>initial</b> CE <b>length</b> in the muscle’s F-L relationship, thereby also neglecting the descending limb instability problem. To address the problem of muscle modelling for continuously varying recruitment and length, and hence different values of <b>initial</b> CE <b>length</b> for different motor-units, a new multiple-motor-unit muscle model is presented which considers the muscle to comprise 1000 individual Hill-type virtual motorunits, which determine the total isometric force. Other parts of the model (F-V relationship and passive elements) are not dependent on the <b>initial</b> CE <b>length</b> and, therefore, they are implemented for the muscle as a whole rather than for the individual motor-units. The results demonstrate the potential errors introduced by using a single-motor-unit model and also the instantaneous CE length in the F-L relationship, both of which are common in FES control studies...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY We studied {{sarcomere}} {{performance in}} single isolated intact frog atrial cells using tech-niques that allow direct measurement of sarcomere length and force. The {{purpose of this}} investigation was to determine-whether length-dependent alterations in contractile activation occur in the single isolated cardiac cell. This was accomplished by determining the effect of <b>initial</b> sarcomere <b>length</b> on the tune course of sarcomere shortening and force development during auxotonic twitch contractions. The results presented in this paper demonstrate that the velocity of sarcomere shortening, the rate of force development, and the magnitude of force development during auxotonic twitch contractions all increase as <b>initial</b> sarcomere <b>length</b> increases over the range of about 2 pm to greater than 3 /un. These results indicate that the level of contractle activation increases as <b>initial</b> sarcomere <b>length</b> increases. Also, results are presented that indicate that the rate of increase of contractile activation during a twitch contraction also increases as <b>initial</b> sarcomere <b>length</b> increases. These length-dependent effects on contractile activation in conjunction with the slow time course of contractile activation cause the force-velocity-length relationship to be time-dependent: i. e., the velocity of sarcomere shortening at a given sarcomere length and load depends on the time during the contraction when the sarcomere reaches that length. The results suggest that length-dependent alterations in contractile activation ma...|$|R

40|$|Free {{electron}} lasers (FEL) need a {{very bright}} electron beam in three dimensions and a high peak charge density. In order to compress an initially longer electron bunch generated from the photoinjector, magnetic bunch compression systems are widely employed. In this paper, first harmonic RF linearization and its associated requirements are reviewed. Meanwhile it is also briefly discussed what is the relation between a proper <b>initial</b> bunch <b>length</b> and main RF frequency, when a harmonic RF linearization is included. Then given a reasonable bunch compression ratio, a proper <b>initial</b> bunch <b>length</b> {{as a function of}} the main RF frequency and RF phase is estimated analytically by several approaches, assuming that no harmonic RF section is needed to linearize the energy modulation introduced during main RF acceleration, and at the same time still linearly compress the bunch length. Next the upper limit of the bunch compression ratio in a single stage is evaluated analytically. The analytical relations derived on choosing a proper <b>initial</b> bunch <b>length</b> as a function of main RF frequency are confirmed by numerical simulation. These simple limit provide rough estimations and may be beneficial for choosing bunch compression ratios in different stages of an FEL driver, especially in a first stage bunch compression where there is usually a harmonic RF linearization applied. It may also be useful in evaluating the possibility of low charge operation mode without any harmonic RF linearization, where a shorter <b>initial</b> bunch <b>length</b> can be achieved from the photoinjector. ...|$|R
