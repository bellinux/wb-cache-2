5|$|The Navy {{decided that}} a Hawaiian base was a necessity, {{considering}} the Army field at Ford Island an ideal candidate. Naval Air Station Pearl Harbor, consisting of nine officers and fifty-five men, was commissioned on December 19, 1919. Although the Navy attempted to displace the Army from the island and designate it solely <b>for</b> <b>naval</b> <b>use,</b> U.S. Secretary of War Newton D. Baker divided the island equally between the military branches. The Army received {{the west side of}} the island, and the Navy the southeastern side. Lieutenant Commander Robert D. Kirk-Patrick was sent to establish a naval station on the island with four airplanes and fifty-five men. Kirk-Patrick's men had two Curtiss HS2L flying boats and two N-9 planes salvaged from World War I, which they stored in two large canvas hangars across the harbor from the island. After the naval hangars were commissioned on January 17, 1923, by Lieutenant Commander John Rodgers, the detachment moved onto Ford Island and received Naval Aircraft Factory TS, Felixstowe F5L, Curtiss H-16, Keystone PK-1 and Douglas DT type aircraft. To accommodate ship berthing the Navy built a concrete-and-stone quay around the entire island, and in 1926, they received Vought FU, Vought VE-7 and Vought VE-9 biplanes.|$|E

Jyoti was the largest ship in the navy until INS Vikramaditya (R33) was commissioned in November 2013. Its primary role is fleet replenishment and sustaining blue-water operations. It was later fitted with close-in weapon systems for self-defence.|$|E
25|$|After these successes Martin sailed back to England, {{arriving}} there late in 1743, {{and receiving}} a promotion to rear-admiral on 7 December. He received a command in the Channel Fleet in February 1744 under his old commander, Sir John Norris, and {{was promoted to}} vice-admiral on 23 June 1744. Martin was appointed second {{in command of the}} fleet sent to Lisbon under Sir John Balchen, and while there produced a report on the contract hospitals. Martin was highly critical of them, and influenced the later decision to introduce dedicated medical centres solely <b>for</b> <b>naval</b> <b>use.</b> Balchen was lost during the return voyage to England, when his flagship, the 100-gun , disappeared at sea. Martin replaced him as commander of the fleet, a post he held until 1745.|$|E
25|$|Reusing Olympics space {{saved the}} {{shipyard}} {{time and money}} by not clearing out a third slip similar in size to those used for Olympic and Titanic. In August 1914, before Britannic could commence transatlantic service between New York and Southampton, the First World War began. Immediately, all shipyards with Admiralty contracts were given top priority to use available raw materials. All civil contracts including the Britannic were slowed down. The naval authorities requisitioned {{a large number of}} ships as armed merchant cruisers or for troop transport. The Admiralty paid the companies for the use of their ships but the risk of losing a ship in naval operations was high. However, the big ocean liners were not taken <b>for</b> <b>naval</b> <b>use,</b> because smaller ships were easier to operate. RMS Olympic returned to Belfast on 3 November 1914, while work on her sister continued slowly.|$|E

25|$|Raeder {{attended}} {{a meeting with}} Hitler on 21 December 1939. He informed Hitler that naval reconnaissance operations were impossible. In response Göring allowed X. Fliegerkorps to be seconded to the navy and for the transfer of Dornier Do 17 bombers. Admiral Otto Schniewind compiled a memo on 15 January 1940 entitled Organisation and Expansion of the Naval Air Units of Commander in Chief, Navy. Schniewind noted only 14 Staffeln (Squadrons) were {{at the disposal of}} the navy. Schniewind argued that X. Fliegerkorps be given responsibility for air-sea operations to assist naval–controlled unit. He also asked for an allocation of the new Dornier Do 217 bomber <b>for</b> <b>naval</b> <b>use.</b> Göring was trying to limit naval squadrons to nine multi purpose and six reconnaissance units but did not resist the suggestion X. Fliegerkorps should be engaged in anti-shipping operations, but he refused the navy's use of the Do 217 and insisted the He 115 would have to remain sufficient on the grounds the type would go to the newly established X. Fliegerkorps. On 4 April 1940 Göring implemented another program to reduce the naval air forces from 12 to nine Junkers Ju 88s in a Staffel and 11 Do 17s per Dornier-staffel and nine in each Blohm & Voss BV 138-equipped Staffel. The proposal was put to the Naval Staff on the eve of Operation Weserübung, the invasion of Denmark and Norway. In the event, the campaign proved what even small air strength could accomplish against shipping and enemy naval forces.|$|E
500|$|Cannon {{also saw}} {{use in the}} Tudor navy (where a cannon was a [...] "gun", and a {{cannonball}} a [...] "shot"). The French [...] "culverin" [...] was adapted <b>for</b> <b>naval</b> <b>use</b> by the English in the late 16th century, and had a significant advantage over the ballista {{that had previously been}} used in naval warfare. This cannon was of relatively long barrel and light construction, and fired solid round shot projectiles at long ranges along a flat trajectory. One of the first ships to be able to fire a full cannon broadside was the English carrack the Mary Rose, built in Portsmouth from 15101512, and equipped with 78 guns (91 after an upgrade in the 1530s). It was one of the earliest purpose-built warships to serve in the English Navy (thought never to have served as a merchant ship), and her crew consisted of 200 sailors, 185 soldiers, and 30 gunners.|$|E
500|$|Girl Pat was {{repaired}} and refitted in Georgetown by her new owners, the Grimsby-based firm Girl Pat Ltd, and {{was brought}} back to England, arriving at Portsmouth on 9 May 1937 [...] She remained there for two weeks as a tourist attraction, before moving to London on 28 May. Her new owners declared {{that they were still}} undecided as to the ship's longer-term future, but for the time being she would be displayed at Blackpool and other holiday resorts. On 17 February 1939 The Times reported that Girl Pat had been sold to the Port of London Authority (PLA), {{to be used as a}} wreck-marking vessel. After the outbreak of war in September 1939, she was requisitioned by the Admiralty <b>for</b> <b>naval</b> <b>use,</b> and is listed as one of the [...] "minor war vessels" [...] in service in July 1940. By 1945 she had been returned to the PLA; there is no public record of her subsequent history. The name Girl Pat was adopted by at least one later registered vessel; in August 1966 a 60-ton yacht of that name was arrested by Greek coastguards in the Gulf of Corinth and its occupants charged with the theft of antiquities.|$|E
50|$|MX designations were {{a series}} of designations used for {{experimental}} weapon system programs, including jet- and rocket-powered precision-guided munitions, designed and manufactured by U.S. defense contractors under contracts provided by the United States Army Air Force (1945 - 1947), the United States Air Force (1947 - 1954) and the United States Navy. Some of those missile projects, which were equally applicable <b>for</b> <b>naval</b> <b>uses</b> (e.g. air-to-surface anti-ship missiles and air-to-underwater anti-submarine missiles,) eventually have been transferred to the Navy, and later developed {{under the auspices of}} Naval research facilities.|$|R

500|$|The wartime {{activities}} of the ship are unclear. According to a postwar report written for the Proceedings of the United States Naval Institute, the incomplete vessel was towed to Kiel, where she {{was used as a}} barracks ship. The modern naval historian René Greger states that the incomplete hull never left Hamburg. Some contemporary observers believed the ship had been completed for service with the German Navy, and British Admiral John Jellicoe, the commander of the Grand Fleet, received intelligence that the ship might have been in service by 1916. Other observers, such as Barnett, pointed to the difficulty the German Navy would have had in rearming the ship with German guns, given the fact that Germany possessed no designs for naval guns of that caliber or mountings suitable for use aboard Salamis. He regarded the claim that she had been put into service [...] "doubtful". Barnett's assessment was correct; the Germans would have had to have done substantial rebuilding of the ship's barbette structures to accommodate German guns, and since guns available <b>for</b> <b>naval</b> <b>use</b> were not easily available owing {{to the needs of the}} German Army, work was directed toward German vessels under construction like the battlecruiser [...] The British realized the rumor was false when the ship did not appear at the Battle of Jutland on 31 May – 1 June 1916.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the entry}} of the United States into World War I in 1917, the U.S. naval {{purchased}} a number of large private yachts, including Bayocean, for use as patrol vessels.

2500|$|While [...] "coal and sulfur" [...] {{had been}} {{recognised}} {{as the best}} weapon for naval warfare as early as 1260, cannon saw their first real naval use in large numbers during the Renaissance.

2500|$|When {{relations}} with the Soviet Union deteriorated in late 1939, the Finnish state-owned icebreakers were again armed and assigned to a wartime icebreaker flotilla. Tarmo had been fitted with gun mounts already in 1931, and shortly before the Winter War began she was armed with four [...] 50-caliber Vickers naval guns of Russian origin on two twin mounts. It was soon apparent that the guns, which were used on all large Finnish icebreakers, were not very suitable <b>for</b> <b>naval</b> <b>use</b> due to their relatively short range and slow rate of fire. On 11 January 1940, after spending {{the early days of}} the war near Turku, Tarmo was ordered to the Gulf of Finland because the ice conditions had become too severe for the smaller Murtaja. When the two icebreakers met in Helsinki on 13 January, a Madsen 20 mm anti-aircraft cannon was moved from Murtaja to Tarmo.|$|E
