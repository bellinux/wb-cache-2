5|$|<b>Engine</b> <b>failure</b> causes {{problems}} on conventional subsonic aircraft; {{not only does}} the aircraft lose thrust on that side but the engine creates drag, causing the aircraft to yaw and bank {{in the direction of the}} failed engine. If this had happened to Concorde at supersonic speeds, it theoretically could have caused a catastrophic failure of the airframe. Although computer simulations predicted considerable problems, in practice Concorde could shut down both engines on the same side of the aircraft at Mach 2 without the predicted difficulties. During an <b>engine</b> <b>failure</b> the required air intake is virtually zero. So, on Concorde, <b>engine</b> <b>failure</b> was countered by the opening of the auxiliary spill door and the full extension of the ramps, which deflected the air downwards past the engine, gaining lift and minimising drag. Concorde pilots were routinely trained to handle double <b>engine</b> <b>failure.</b>|$|E
5|$|The type's first fatal {{accident}} occurred on 30 June 1994 near Toulouse {{on a test}} flight when an Airbus-owned A330-300 crashed while simulating an <b>engine</b> <b>failure</b> on climbout, killing all seven on board. Airbus subsequently advised A330 operators to disconnect the autopilot and limit pitch attitude {{in the event of}} an <b>engine</b> <b>failure</b> at low speed.|$|E

50|$|Mazzacane and Jacques Villeneuve retired with <b>engine</b> <b>failures</b> on laps 29-30. Giancarlo Fisichella's Benetton and Eddie Irvine's Jaguar also {{suffered}} <b>engine</b> <b>failures,</b> Fisichella in the pits on lap 31 and Irvine on the start-finish straight on lap 43. Meanwhile, Häkkinen was failing to catch Barrichello, doing slower laps. Montoya pitted on lap 47 only to stall his engine; {{after it had}} been restarted, he burned his clutch leaving the pits, forcing him to retire. At the same time, Ralf and Häkkinen made their final pit stops.|$|R

On lap 208, Jeff Gordon became the new race leader after Biffle came into pit road. After pit stops, Biffle reclaimed the top position. On lap 220, the third caution was given as Ambrose's car suffered an <b>engine</b> <b>failure.</b> Jeff Gordon and Martin stayed out, while some of the leaders came to pit road.|$|E
5|$|By the , {{the ninth}} {{race of the}} season, Schumacher was 25 points behind Alonso, but he then won the {{following}} three races to reduce his disadvantage to 11. After his victories in Italy (in which Alonso had an <b>engine</b> <b>failure)</b> and China, in which Alonso had tyre problems, Schumacher led in the championship standings {{for the first time}} during the season. Although he and Alonso had the same point total, Schumacher was in front because he had won more races.|$|E
5|$|Four {{cars were}} {{entered in the}} GT1 class for the 1995 24 Hours of Le Mans, two by PC Automotive Jaguar and two by Chamberlain Engineering, though the latter did not run their cars. Neither team had Jaguar or TWR backing; both of PC Automotive's cars were outpaced by the new McLaren F1 GTR. Richard Piper, Tiff Needell and James Weaver were holding fourth {{position}} until an <b>engine</b> <b>failure</b> during the night, ending their race, whilst the second XJ220 retired after leaving the road.|$|E
50|$|<b>Engine</b> <b>failures</b> became epidemic. Eighteen <b>engine</b> <b>failures</b> {{occurred}} during {{the last quarter of}} 1968. Karl Polifka (call sign Raven 45) reported 26 in a month, apparently February 1969. This led to all the O-1s being cycled through Udorn to have their fuel tanks cleaned out. Some of them had 18 years of crud and mud contaminating the tanks. The tanks were cleaned, and by May 1969, air force piston engine mechanics came on board at the ratio of a mechanic per two FAC aircraft. Engine problems dropped drastically after that.|$|R

5|$|He {{then went}} on to score points in five of the next six races on his way to moving into the top 10 in the World Drivers' Championship, the run of results {{interrupted}} only by an <b>engine</b> <b>failure</b> in Monaco. One of his best races came in Austria where despite starting from the pitlane and suffering a drive-through penalty he set the race's third fastest lap, behind only the Ferraris of Michael Schumacher and Rubens Barrichello, finishing in 7th place.|$|E
5|$|On 18 July 1943 the P-51 Mustang {{in which}} he was flying was hit by German flak or {{suffered}} <b>engine</b> <b>failure</b> and crashed over France. The Germans reported him as a prisoner of war but he died in a military hospital from his injuries. MacLachlan was awarded a second Bar to his DFC on 30 July 1943 in absentia. During the course of his combat career he flew the Fairey Battle, Hawker Hurricane, Supermarine Spitfire and P-51 Mustang.|$|E
5|$|On 4 November 2010, Qantas Flight 32, {{en route}} from Singapore Changi Airport to Sydney Airport, {{suffered}} an uncontained <b>engine</b> <b>failure,</b> resulting {{in a series of}} related problems, and forcing the flight to make an emergency landing. The plane safely returned to Singapore. There were no injuries to the passengers, crew or people on the ground despite debris falling onto the Indonesian island of Batam. The A380 was damaged sufficiently for the event to be classified as an accident. Qantas subsequently grounded all of its A380s that day subject to an internal investigation taken in conjunction with the engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce plc. A380s powered by Engine Alliance GP7000 were unaffected but operators of Rolls-Royce Trent 900-powered A380s were affected. Investigators determined that an oil leak, caused by a defective oil supply pipe, led to an engine fire and subsequent uncontained <b>engine</b> <b>failure.</b> Repairs cost an estimated 139 million (~US$145M). As other Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines also showed problems with the same oil leak, Rolls-Royce ordered many engines to be changed, including about half of the engines in the Qantas A380 fleet. During the airplane's repair, cracks were discovered in wing structural fittings which also resulted in mandatory inspections of all A380s and subsequent design changes.|$|E

50|$|As {{a result}} of a number of {{incidents}} involving Chalk's aircraft, concern had arisen among Chalk's pilots about the state of repair of the aircraft. Pilots had experienced a number of <b>engine</b> <b>failures,</b> and in one incident an elevator control cable snapped in flight, although fortunately the pilot was able to land that aircraft safely. This led to several of Chalk's pilots reconsidering their position in the company, and one, having suffered four <b>engine</b> <b>failures</b> during his period there, and having a wife and new baby to support, resigned his position over what he perceived as persistent maintenance issues with the fleet.|$|R

5|$|On September 8, 2015, British Airways Flight 2276 aborted takeoff from McCarran due to <b>engine</b> <b>failure.</b> While {{preparing}} to takeoff from runway 7L for London Gatwick Airport, the Boeing 777-200ER suffered failure of its left (#1) engine, and a fire erupted. 14 passengers suffered injuries during the evacuation, and the runway {{was closed for}} eight hours. The aircraft suffered major damage, but it was repaired and returned to service in March 2016.|$|E
5|$|Prevented {{from flying}} further combat {{missions}} for propaganda reasons, {{at the age}} of 28 Mölders was appointed Inspector of Fighters. He was inspecting the Luftwaffe units in the Crimea when he was ordered to Berlin to attend the state funeral of Ernst Udet, a Luftwaffe general and World War I flying ace. On the flight to Berlin, the aircraft in which he was traveling as a passenger attempted an emergency landing due to an <b>engine</b> <b>failure.</b> It crashed at Breslau, killing Mölders and two others.|$|E
5|$|Proximal {{volcanic}} hazards pose {{a significant}} threat {{to human life}} near Gareloi. If Gareloi were to erupt unexpectedly, ash clouds, falling volcanic ash, pyroclastic flows, and debris avalanches (such as lahars) could easily span deadly hazards such as tsunamis. As volcanic ash can induce <b>engine</b> <b>failure,</b> it puts commercial airplanes in particular at high risk. Inhalation of volcanic ash, also known as tephra, creates respiratory complexities and irritation of the eye.|$|E
