5|$|For the dentist, {{the goal}} of {{treatment}} generally is to relieve the pain, and wherever possible to preserve or restore function. The treatment depends on {{the cause of the}} toothache, and frequently a clinical decision regarding the current state and long-term prognosis of the affected tooth, as well as the individual's wishes and ability to cope with dental treatment, will influence the treatment choice. Often, administration of an intra-oral local anesthetic such as lidocaine and epinephrine is indicated in order to carry out pain-free treatment. Treatment may range from simple advice, removal of dental decay with a <b>dental</b> <b>drill</b> and subsequent placement of a filling, to root canal treatment, tooth extraction, or debridement.|$|E
5|$|Much of Carter's {{inspiration}} for the episode came from reports of Phineas Gage, who underwent a personality change after a blasting accident drove an iron rod completely through his head (though the idea that Gage became violent, immoral, or a pathological liar, as Scully describes him, is without foundation). The aliens' use of a <b>dental</b> <b>drill</b> on Barry {{was inspired by a}} neighbour of Carter who said that he was abducted and that the aliens drilled holes into his teeth – which a dentist analyzed and said could not be done with any equipment he knew.|$|E

50|$|<b>Dental</b> <b>drills,</b> {{which have}} a distinctive, shrill sound, are often a {{prominent}} factor in many people's fear of dentistry.|$|R
25|$|A <b>dental</b> <b>drill</b> is a small, {{high-speed}} drill used in dentistry {{to remove}} decayed tooth material {{prior to the}} insertion of a dental filling. George F. Green of Kalamazoo, Michigan invented the first electric powered device to drill teeth in 1875.|$|E
25|$|Abrading is {{the process}} in which surface {{deposits}} are removed using abrasives. Abrasives come in both solid and cream forms. Solid forms of abrasives include glass fiber brush or a rubber burr on a <b>dental</b> <b>drill.</b> Cream forms are usually attached to paper or film. Polishing creams are commonly used to remove thin layers of insoluble surface deposits such calcium. These creams can also remove surface dirt and marks made by tools. The best creams of ceramic do not have oil, grease, or bleach as additives and are used only on glazed ceramics.|$|E
500|$|During {{the filming}} of Duane Barry's abduction, they had a [...] "film run out" [...] which, {{according}} to Carter, gave the scene a [...] "very eerie effect". Shooting that scene was a [...] "real test" [...] according to Carter. Carter {{was pleased with the}} outcome, saying he was able to show viewers what he wanted out of The X-Files, which he felt he was [...] "very successful" [...] at. The visual effects' crew had to hang a [...] "giant light" [...] over the house where Barry was being abducted. It took the course of 45 minutes to shoot the scene. According to Carter, much teamwork was required to film that particular scene. As Carter puts it, he was actually forced to stay [...] "behind the camera" [...] to see the end results. For the experiments, Railsback was put in a plaster model of his back as he was lifted by a hydraulic device, and had water squirted on his mouth for the <b>dental</b> <b>drill.</b>|$|E

50|$|Impact wrenches, pulse tools, nutrunners, screwdrivers, drills, grinders, die grinders, sanders, <b>dental</b> <b>drills</b> {{and other}} {{pneumatic}} tools {{use a variety}} of air motors. These include vane type motors, turbines and piston motors.|$|R
500|$|The first parody {{recorded}} for {{the album was}} [...] "Cavity Search", a parody of U2's hit [...] "Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me". The song, which recounts the horror of {{having to go to}} the dentist, features the sound of an actual <b>dental</b> <b>drill.</b> To enhance the dental theme of the song, Yankovic called in his actual dentist, who brought a real drill and a human tooth, which the two took turns drilling while recording to create a genuine sound effect. The second parody was a pastiche of TLC's hit [...] "Waterfalls" [...] called [...] "Phony Calls", about prank calls. During the bridge, a clip from The Simpsons second season episode [...] "Blood Feud" [...] is played on top of the music. Because the sound clip was from a preexisting episode, Yankovic noted that [...] "it was a pretty sweet deal for the Simpsons' voice actors – they each got a nice pile of money, and they didn't even have to come to the studio!" [...] The next parody {{recorded for}} the album was [...] "Gump", a parody of [...] "Lump" [...] by The Presidents of the United States of America. The song recounts the basic plot to the 1994 film Forrest Gump about a naïve and slow-witted yet athletically prodigious native of Alabama who witnesses, and in some cases influences, some of the defining events of {{the latter half of the}} 20th century in the United States. [...] "Gump" [...] was released as the second single from the album, and received a video.|$|E
2500|$|In general, early {{treatment}} is quicker {{and less expensive}} than treatment of extensive decay. Local anesthetics, nitrous oxide ("laughing gas"), or other prescription medications may be required {{in some cases to}} relieve pain during or following treatment or to relieve anxiety during treatment. A dental handpiece ("drill") is used to remove large portions of decayed material from a tooth. [...] A spoon, a dental instrument used to carefully remove decay, is sometimes employed when the decay in dentin reaches near the pulp. Some dentists remove dental caries using a laser rather than the traditional <b>dental</b> <b>drill.</b> A Cochrane review of this technique looked at Er:YAG (erbium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet), Er,Cr:YSGG (erbium, chromium: yttrium-scandium-gallium-garnet) and Nd:YAG (neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet) lasers and found that although people treated with lasers (compared to a conventional dental [...] "drill") experienced less pain and had a lesser need for dental anaesthesia, that overall there was little difference in caries removal. Once the caries is removed, the missing tooth structure requires a dental restoration of some sort to return the tooth to function and aesthetic condition.|$|E
60|$|In a dentist's {{operating}} room on a fine August morning in 1896. Not the usual tiny London den, {{but the best}} sitting room of a furnished lodging in a terrace on the sea front at a fashionable watering place. The operating chair, with a gas pump and cylinder beside it, is half way between {{the centre of the}} room and one of the corners. If you look into the room through the window which lights it, you will see the fireplace {{in the middle of the}} wall opposite you, with the door beside it to your left; an M.R.C.S. diploma in a frame hung on the chimneypiece; an easy chair covered in black leather on the hearth; a neat stool and bench, with vice, tools, and a mortar and pestle in the corner to the right. Near this bench stands a slender machine like a whip provided with a stand, a pedal, and an exaggerated winch. Recognising this as a <b>dental</b> <b>drill,</b> you shudder and look away to your left, where you can see another window, underneath which stands a writing table, with a blotter and a diary on it, and a chair. Next the writing table, towards the door, is a leather covered sofa. The opposite wall, close on your right, is occupied mostly by a bookcase. The operating chair is under your nose, facing you, with the cabinet of instruments handy to it on your left. You observe that the professional furniture and apparatus are new, and that the wall paper, designed, with the taste of an undertaker, in festoons and urns, the carpet with its symmetrical plans of rich, cabbagy nosegays, the glass gasalier with lustres; the ornamental gilt rimmed blue candlesticks on the ends of the mantelshelf, also glass- draped with lustres, and the ormolu clock under a glass-cover in the middle between them, its uselessness emphasized by a cheap American clock disrespectfully placed beside it and now indicating 12 o'clock noon, all combine with the black marble which gives the fireplace the air of a miniature family vault, to suggest early Victorian commercial respectability, belief in money, Bible fetichism, fear of hell always at war with fear of poverty, instinctive horror of the passionate character of art, love and Roman Catholic religion, and all the first fruits of plutocracy in the early generations of the industrial revolution.|$|E
50|$|Starting in the 1990s, {{a number}} of {{alternatives}} to conventional rotary <b>dental</b> <b>drills</b> have been developed. These include laser ablation systems and air abrasion devices (essentially miniature sand blasters) or dental treatments with ozone.|$|R
50|$|Burrs (sometimes called rotary files) {{are small}} cutting tools used in die grinders, rotary tools, or <b>dental</b> <b>drills.</b> The name may be {{considered}} appropriate when their small-sized head (3 mm diameter shaft) is compared to a bur (fruit seed with hooks) or their teeth are compared to a metal burr.|$|R
50|$|Today {{ball and}} roller {{bearings}} {{are used in}} many applications which include a rotating component. Examples include ultra high speed bearings in <b>dental</b> <b>drills,</b> aerospace bearings in the Mars Rover, gearbox and wheel bearings on automobiles, flexure bearings in optical alignment systems, bicycle wheel hubs, and air bearings used in Coordinate-measuring machines.|$|R
50|$|Bien-Air {{was founded}} by David Mosimann in 1959 to devolop medical {{instruments}} that would improve work for medical practitioners.

50|$|Modern <b>dental</b> <b>drills</b> can rotate {{at up to}} 400,000 rpm, and {{generally}} use hard metal alloy bits known as burrs. Dental burrs come in {{a great variety of}} shapes designed for specific applications. They are often made of steel with a tungsten carbide coating, or of tungsten carbide entirely. The burr may also have a diamond coating.|$|R
5000|$|Pulpitis may {{be caused}} by dental caries that {{penetrate}} through the enamel and dentin to reach the pulp, or it may be a result of trauma, such as physical abuse of the tooth or thermal insults, including overheating from insufficiently cooled <b>dental</b> <b>drills</b> and use of dental curing lights. More often it is from physical trauma rather than dental treatments.|$|R
50|$|Emerson was {{established}} in 1890 in St. Louis, Missouri as Emerson Electric Manufacturing Co. by Civil War Union veteran John Wesley Emerson to manufacture electric motors using a patent owned by the Scottish-born brothers Charles and Alexander Meston. In 1892, it became the first to sell electric fans in the United States. It quickly expanded its product line to include electric sewing machines, electric <b>dental</b> <b>drills,</b> and power tools.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>dental</b> <b>drill</b> or dentist's drill is a small, {{high-speed}} drill {{used during}} dental procedures, usually to remove decay and shape tooth structure {{prior to the}} insertion of a filling or crown. A <b>dental</b> <b>drill</b> may also {{be used in the}} cleaning and shaping of root canals during endodontic treatment, or to remove old or temporary fillings or crowns prior to the insertion of new or permanent restorations. The term [...] "dental drill" [...] is considered the more colloquial form of the term [...] "dental handpiece," [...] although it can also be construed as to include the power source for one or more handpieces, a [...] "dental engine." [...] "Handpiece" [...] and [...] "engine" [...] are more generic and euphemistic terms for generic dental tools.|$|E
50|$|Use of {{the dental}} laser remains limited, with cost and {{effectiveness}} being the primary barriers. The {{cost of a}} dental laser ranges from $4,000 to $130,000, where a pneumatic <b>dental</b> <b>drill</b> costs between $200 and $500. The lasers are also incapable of performing some routine dental operations.|$|E
50|$|The first {{electric}} <b>dental</b> <b>drill</b> was patented in 1875 by Green, {{a development}} that revolutionized dentistry. By 1914, electric dental drills could reach speeds of up to 3000 rpm. A second wave of rapid development occurred in the 1950s and 60s, including {{the development of the}} air turbine drill.|$|E
40|$|Following {{isolation}} of Legionella pneumophila from a special dental station water circuit, used primarily to cool high-speed <b>dental</b> <b>drills</b> which produce fine aerosols, a case finding and environmental survey was undertaken.

5000|$|She {{was working}} as an {{audition}} pianist when she met Danny Kaye; both were working on a short-lived Broadway show. Fine wrote the lyrics and music for it. Although the pair had never met before, they discovered something in common. Kaye had once worked for Fine's father, watching his office while the dentist went to lunch. Dr. Fine had fired his future son-in-law for doing woodworking with his <b>dental</b> <b>drills.</b> They married on January 3, 1940.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel {{design of a}} virtual dental training system (hapTEL) using haptic technology. The system allows dental students to learn and practice procedures such as <b>dental</b> <b>drilling,</b> caries removal and cavity preparation for tooth restoration. This paper focuses on the hardware design, development and evaluation aspects {{in relation to the}} dental training and educational requirements. Detailed discussions on how the system offers dental students a natural operational position are documented. An innovative design of measuring and connecting the dental tools to the haptic device is also shown. Evaluation of the impact on teaching and learning is discussed...|$|R
50|$|Other {{measures}} that are taken during {{management of the}} acute phase might include reducing {{the height of the}} tooth with a <b>dental</b> <b>drill,</b> so it no longer contacts the opposing tooth when biting down; and regular use of hot salt water mouth washes (antiseptic and encourages further drainage of the infection).|$|E
50|$|He is {{best remembered}} for inventing a {{water-cooled}} mercury-vapor lamp (Kromayer lamp) for ultraviolet irradiation of the skin. On 23 October 1906 {{he received a}} patent for the lamp. He also made pioneer contributions in regards to dermabrasion; around 1905 he introduced a device that consisted of rotating burrs attached to a <b>dental</b> <b>drill,</b> being designed {{for the removal of}} unwanted skin layers.|$|E
5000|$|The Indus Valley Civilization {{has yielded}} {{evidence}} of dentistry being practiced {{as far back}} as 7000 BC. This earliest form of dentistry involved curing tooth related disorders with bow drills operated, perhaps, by skilled bead craftsmen. The reconstruction of this ancient form of dentistry showed that the methods used were reliable and effective. Cavities of 3.5 mm depth with concentric groovings indicate use of a drill tool. The age of the teeth has been estimated at 9000 years. In later times, mechanical hand drills were used. Like most hand drills, they were quite slow, with speeds of up to 15 rpm. In 1864, British dentist George Fellows Harrington invented a clockwork <b>dental</b> <b>drill</b> named Erado. [...] The device was much faster than earlier drills, but also very noisy. In 1868, American dentist George F. Green came up with a pneumatic <b>dental</b> <b>drill</b> powered with pedal-operated bellows. James B. Morrison devised a pedal-powered burr drill in 1871.|$|E
50|$|Soon {{after the}} {{hospital}} opened, the Independent Commission Against Corruption carried out an extensive {{investigation into the}} provision of equipment at the new facility due to suspected commercial fraud. Much of the original equipment were suspected copies of reputable models and were not fully operable. Repairs and replacements had {{to be carried out}} on all dental chairs, stools, bunsen burners, <b>dental</b> <b>drills,</b> instrument modules, ultrasonic scalers, and operating lights. Investigators stated that there was no health threat to the public. In 1983 the hospital board chairman Lydia Dunn stated that the hospital was one of the foremost dental teaching hospitals in the world.|$|R

40|$|Background:Pneumomediastinum is {{commonly}} caused by iatrogenic injury such as surgery on the cervical planes and chest or by tracheostomy. It is also {{well known that}} emphysema may occur after dental treatments using an air turbine drill, {{but there have been}} few cases of emphysema which extended to the mediastinum. Case Presentation:A 16 -year-old boy is presented with subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum which developed 24 hours after surgery for extraction of an inferior second molar. We first describe history, clinical presentation and radiologic appearance of our patient and then review the literature about oral surgery causing pneumomediastinum. Conclusion:Surgical procedures in oral cavity can lead to the development of emphysema and pneumomediastinum when air turbine <b>dental</b> <b>drills</b> are used. To avoid these complications, air turbine high speed drills should be used only in necessary cases...|$|R
