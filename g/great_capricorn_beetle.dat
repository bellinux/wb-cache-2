40|$|This {{work was}} aimed at {{identifying}} the pheromone component(s) of the <b>great</b> <b>Capricorn</b> longhorn <b>beetle</b> (Cerambyx cerdo). Volatile samples from beetles were obtained by means of collection of headspace volatiles from the animals, and by direct solvent extraction of body parts, and analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and gas chromatography- Electroanntennography (GC-EAG). The chemical analyses were accompanied by behavioural studies. No potential pheromone candidate(s) was identified, neither in the GC-MS analyses nor the GC-EAG analyses. However, the behavioural studies in a two-way choice olfactometer using live beetles as odour sources suggest that the males emit pheromones attracting the females...|$|R
50|$|The <b>capricorn</b> <b>beetle,</b> Cerambyx scopolii Fuessly, is an {{invasive}} species of longhorn beetle from Europe. Its wood-boring larvae will grow in oak, willow, and chestnut, and in sufficient density can kill a tree.|$|R
5000|$|Cerambyx is a genus of beetles in {{the family}} Cerambycidae (longhorn beetles). They are {{commonly}} known as <b>capricorn</b> <b>beetles,</b> as their strong, stout and curved antennae, each segment of which flares towards the tip, are reminiscent of the horns of an Alpine Ibex (Capra ibex) or [...] "capricorn".|$|R
5000|$|The Dainava Forest mainly {{consists}} of pine trees. There are some birch, spruce, black alder groves. Soils are sandy, light, densely covered by cup lichen.

The fauna includes many endangered species, such as the gray wolf, wood grouse, black grouse, hoopoe, Eurasian eagle-owl, osprey, mountain hare, stoat, Coronella austriaca, <b>great</b> <b>capricorn</b> <b>beetle,</b> and Lucanus cervus.|$|E
40|$|The old-growth endemic Imeretian oak [Quercus robur subsp. imeretina (Steven ex Woronow) Menitsky, 1968] is a {{protected}} relict Tertiary period tree still preserved in Ajameti Managed Reserve (Republic of Georgia). For a long time, these forests were experienced {{to the strong}} anthropogenic influence. The old-age oak trees {{and the development of}} root and stem rot have promoted the settlement of <b>great</b> <b>capricorn</b> <b>beetle</b> [Cerambyx cerdo Linnaeus, 1758 (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) ]. Both of species are protected under the EU Habitats Directive and listed in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. The investigation of settling degree of C. cerdo was conducted at two areas, Ajameti and Vartsikhe, on the edge {{and in the middle of}} oak forests in June and October 2014. On both the areas, the number of trees with fly exit holes of <b>great</b> <b>capricorn</b> <b>beetle</b> was higher on the margin of forests where plantations suffer greater of human impact. The number of fly exit holes of imago is significantly increased due to deterioration of sanitary condition of forests.

40|$|The <b>Great</b> <b>Capricorn</b> <b>beetle,</b> Cerambyx cerdo, and Mediterranean oak {{habitats}} (Quercus ilex – 9340 and Quercus suber – 9330) {{are protected}} by the Habitats Directive (HD). However, in the Mediterranean basin, these habitats are also traditionally used for animal, wood, and cork productions. Cerambyx cerdo feeds into the wood of trees and can be perceived by forest practitioners as an umbrella species or as a pest, depending on the context. Monitoring programmes involving forest practitioners could thus focus on assessing: 1) the conservation status of the <b>Great</b> <b>Capricorn</b> <b>beetle</b> and habitats (distribution and abundance of insects and reproductive sites or colonised trees), 2) pest status, and 3) management options to achieve both conservational and economic benefits. Considering that Cerambyx cerdo and Cork and Holm oak forests are not priority species or habitats under the HD, targeted funding {{is likely to be}} limited for monitoring. In this context, citizen science could gather important information on the target species useful for the monitoring programmes and management. To address management questions, the citizen science based programme for Cerambyx cerdo monitoring and habitat conservation should be seen not only as citizens collecting good data sets, but also as a deeper collaboration amongst different knowledge bodies and perspectives within a community – based environmental monitoring and learning network...|$|E
50|$|The {{wildlife}} of {{the area}} corresponds to the various layers of vegetation. On and in the earth live the sand lizard and common lizard, the mole, the common shrew, the tundra vole and red fox. In the tree layer the beech marten and red squirrel may be seen. The herb and shrub layer are home to many species of songbird. The main bird species on the Streckelsberg are the robin wren, great tit, blue tit, chiffchaff, red-breasted flycatcher, willow warbler, blackcap and lesser whitethroat. The somewhat larger blackbird and song thrush also live on the Streckelsberg. In the tree layer there are golden oriole, chaffinch, stock dove, tawny owl, wood pigeon, hooded crow and goshawk. Bats also have their summer homes in tree hollows and cracks. Depending on the biodiversity of the flora, many insect species live on Streckelsberg. In addition to various butterflies there are also <b>beetles,</b> including the <b>capricorn</b> <b>beetle,</b> sawyer and longhorn beetle, whose larvae live on dead wood.|$|R

40|$|Presence-only {{models can}} aid {{conservation}} and management of threatened, elusive species. A MaxEnt model has been developed for the <b>great</b> <b>capricorn</b> <b>beetle</b> (Cerambyx cerdo L., 1758) in south-western Poland and the variables identified best explaining the species’ occurrence on a large scale. Once successfully validated, the model was used to (a) illustrate the expected location of the species’ habitats {{in the region and}} in existing Natura 2000 sites (SACs) in S-W Poland and (b) assess the efficacy of the regional network of national protected areas (NPAs) versus Natura 2000 (SACs). Overall, information was gathered on 1025 localities of C. cerdo L., 1758 in Lower Silesia. All the records came from the pedunculate oak Quercus robur L., 1753. The occurrence of the <b>great</b> <b>capricorn</b> <b>beetle</b> in the study region is limited mainly to its eastern part, with a marked concentration in the valleys of the rivers Odra, Barycz and Bystrzyca. The kernel density estimation analysis also showed the high concentration of occupied trees in the north-western part of the region, clearly isolated from the above-mentioned main populations. Although a considerable part of the localities in the study region (74. 2 %) occurred within protected areas (PAs), their contribution to the species’ conservation varied between the PAs groups. Natura 2000 SACs are the most important PAs, covering more than 30 % of the predicted area of suitable habitats in the region and more than 45 % of optimal habitats. In total, 384 localities of C. cerdo L., 1758 were found within the cities, most of them (n = 356) in the city of Wrocław. Forty three percent (43 %) of the urban localities of the species (n = 165) in the study region are protected within the regional network of protected areas (OPAs), while those unprotected are mainly concentrated in the city of Wrocław (n = 207). Wrocław also includes 17. 1 % of the area of suitable habitats and 29 % optimal habitats of the species in the region outside the protected area network. To preserve C. cerdo L., 1758, forest corridors should be created or restored to bridge the otherwise impermeable gaps revealed by the authors’ model and grant protection to the still largely unprotected area of the Lower Silesian territory. The species conservation programme in the region requires the cooperation of various authorities, not only those dealing with nature conservation, but also local governments, state forest management and flood protection authorities...|$|E
40|$|The Life Project "Monitoring {{of insects}} with public participation" (LIFE 11 NAT/IT/ 000252) had {{as the main}} {{objective}} to develop and test methods for the monitoring of five beetle species listed in the Annexes of the Habitats Directive (92 / 43 /EEC) : Osmoderma eremita (hermit beetle, Scarabaeidae), Lucanus cervus (European stag beetle, Lucanidae), Cerambyx cerdo (<b>great</b> <b>capricorn</b> <b>beetle,</b> Cerambycidae), Rosalia alpina (rosalia longicorn, Cerambycidae) and Morimus asper/funereus (morimus longicorn, Cerambycidae). The data gathered represent {{an important contribution to}} the monitoring of these target species in Italy. The methods developed for monitoring of the target species are intended for use by the local management authorities and staff of protected areas. These developed methods are the result of extensive fieldwork and ensure scientific validity, ease of execution and limited labour costs. The detailed description of methods and the results for each species are published in separate articles of this special issue of Nature Conservation. A second objective of the project was to gather faunistic data with a Citizen Science approach, using the web and a mobile application software (app) specifically built for mobile devices. The validation of the records collected by the citizens was carried out by experts, based on photographs, which were obligatory for all records. Dissemination activities represented the principal way to contact and engage citizens for the data collection and also offered the possibility of providing information on topics such as Natura 2000, the Habitats Directive, the role of monitoring in nature conservation, the importance of forest ecosystems and the ecological role of the saproxylic insects. An innovative method tested during the project was the training of a dog for searching and monitoring the elusive hermit beetle; the trained dog also added a "curiosity" factor to attract public attention towards this rare insect and the issues mentioned above...|$|E

40|$|This study {{reports on}} an {{investigation}} into the manner in which mathematical symbols influence learners’ understanding of mathematical concepts. The study was conducted in <b>Greater</b> Sekhukhune and <b>Capricorn</b> districts of Limpopo Province, South Africa. Multistage sampling (for the district), simple random sampling (for the schools), purposive sampling (for the teachers) and stratified random sampling with proportional allocation (for the learners) were used. The study was conducted in six schools randomly selected from rural, semi-urban and urban settings. A sample of 565 FET learners and 15 FET band mathematics teachers participated in the study. This study is guided by four interrelated constructivist theories: symbol sense, algebraic insight, APOS and procept theories. The research instruments for the study consist of questionnaires and interviews. A mixed method approach that was predominantly qualitative was employed. An analysis of learners’ difficulties with mathematical symbols produced three (3) clusters. The main cluster consists of 236 (41. 6 %) learners who indicate that they experience severe challenges with mathematical symbols compared to 108 (19. 1 %) learners who indicated that they could confidently handle and manipulate mathematical symbols with understanding. Six (6) categories of challenges with mathematical symbols emerged from learners’ encounters with mathematical symbols: reading mathematical text and symbols, prior knowledge, time allocated for mathematical classes and activities, lack of symbol sense and problem contexts and pedagogical approaches to mathematical symbolisation. Two sets of theme classes related to learners’ difficulties with mathematical symbols and instructional strategies emerged. Learners lack symbol sense for mathematical concepts and algebraic insight for problem solving. Learners stick to procedurally driven symbols at the expense of conceptual and contextual understanding. From a pedagogical perspective teachers indicated that they face the following difficulties when teaching: the challenge of introducing unfamiliar notation in a new topic; reading, writing and verbalising symbols; signifier and signified connections; and teaching both symbolisation and conceptual understanding simultaneously. The study recommends teachers to use strategies such as informed choice of subject matter and a pedagogical approach in which concepts are understood before they are symbolised.
