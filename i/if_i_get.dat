25|$|During World War II, the U.S. needed greater {{aluminum}} {{supplies to}} build airplanes. Aluminum plants required {{huge amounts of}} electricity. To provide the power, TVA engaged {{in one of the}} largest hydropower construction programs ever undertaken in the U.S. By early in 1942, when the effort reached its peak, 12 hydroelectric plants and one steam plant were under construction at the same time, and design and construction employment reached a total of 28,000. The largest project of this period was the Fontana Dam. After negotiations led by Vice-President Harry Truman ("I want aluminum. I don't care <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> it from Alcoa or Al Capone."), TVA purchased the land from Nantahala Power and Light, a wholly owned subsidiary of Alcoa, and built Fontana Dam.|$|E

500|$|Synge later {{developed}} {{an interest in}} Irish antiquities and the Aran Islands, and {{became a member of}} the Irish League for a year. He left the League because, as he told Maud Gonne, [...] "my theory of regeneration for Ireland differs from yours... I wish to work on my own for the cause of Ireland, and I shall never be able to do so <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> mixed up with a revolutionary and semi-military movement."

[...] This is an allusion to the poet Homer, who was also captivated with the nature versus nurture debate.

He maintained a [...] "natural goalscoring instinct" [...] throughout his career, and has said [...] "I always fancy myself to stick the ball {{in the back of the}} net <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> a chance". He ended the 2013–14 season with eight goals in 21 appearances for Rovers.|$|E

500|$|After {{recording}} Astral Weeks, Morrison {{moved with}} his wife to a home on a mountain top in the Catskills near Woodstock, a hamlet in upstate New York with an artistic community. Because of the album's poor sales figures, the singer wanted to produce a third record {{that would be more}} accessible and appealing to listeners: [...] "I make albums primarily to sell them and <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> too far out a lot of people can't relate to it. I had to forget about the artistic thing because it didn't make sense on a practical level. One has to live." [...] He began writing songs for Moondance in July 1969. The musicians who went on to record the album with Morrison were recruited from Woodstock and would continue working with him for several years, including guitarist John Platania, saxophonist Jack Schroer, and keyboardist Jef Labes. The singer left after the Woodstock music festival in August attracted an influx of people to the area.|$|E
500|$|Parker was {{frequently}} compared to Derrick Rose in high school. According to Chicago Sun-Times writer Michael O'Brien, , Rose had a 3–0 advantage in defining moments: [...] "the back-to-back dunks against Washington {{in the city}} championship at the United Center, the game-winning shot in overtime to give Simeon the state championship against Peoria Richwoods and the dismantling of Oak Hill, the top-ranked team in the country." [...] Rose's game against the Oak Hill team with Brandon Jennings, Nolan Smith and Alex Legion on ESPN is described as Rose's national introduction. Although there are comparisons to Rose, his game is most often compared to Grant Hill and Paul Pierce. Dime Magazine describes him as [...] "Grant Hill with a jump shot". Parker claims to model his game after Paul Pierce and Carmelo Anthony. He hopes {{to be regarded as}} the best high school basketball player {{in the history of the}} city of Chicago and has stated that [...] "being compared to Derrick also drives me. I know <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> better than him or break the records he broke I could be one of the best players to come out of Chicago. I look forward to being one of those players." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{search for}} a new guitarist and drummer began with {{advertisements}} placed in copies of Melody Maker. The invitation was spotted by drummer Phil Collins, formerly of Flaming Youth who already knew Stratton-Smith. He recalled, [...] "My only knowledge of Genesis was through seeing the ads for their gigs. It seemed like they were constantly working. ... I thought 'At least I'm going to be working <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> the gig'." [...] Roger Taylor, subsequently of Queen, turned down an invitation to audition. Collins went to the audition at Gabriel's parents' house in Chobham, Surrey with his Flaming Youth band mate, guitarist Ronnie Caryl. As they arrived early, Collins took a swim in the pool and heard what the other drummers were playing. [...] "They put on 'Trespass', and my initial impression of a very soft and round music, not edgy, with vocal harmonies and I came away thinking Crosby, Stills and Nash". Gabriel and Rutherford noticed the confident way Collins approached and sat at his drum kit and knew he would be the right replacement. Banks said, [...] "It was a combination of things. He could make it swing a little bit ... he could also tell good jokes and make us laugh ... And he could sing, which was an advantage because Mike and I were not very good at back-up vocals". In August 1970, Collins became the new drummer for Genesis. Caryl's audition was unsuccessful; Rutherford thought he was not the player the group were looking for.|$|E

500|$|A strong {{start to}} the 2006–07 Australian {{domestic}} season, exemplified by 150* against Tasmania in the Pura Cup and 126* against New South Wales in the Ford Ranger Cup (previously ING Cup) saw White recalled to the Australia one-day squad. [...] Chief of selectors, Andrew Hilditch described his inclusion in the squad, praising his [...] "great form with the bat and [...] has had some terrific performances with the ball". In an interview with Australian newspaper The Age, White professed his relief at returning to the international scene, stating that [...] "I don't really care <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> picked as a batting allrounder or a bowling allrounder, or just as a bat or bowler, as long as I get picked." [...] An international Twenty20 against England saw White rewarded with {{a man of the}} match award for his 40* off 20 balls, and 1/11 with the ball in hand. In his next batting innings, White scored 45runs including 3sixes against New Zealand, leading teammate Andrew Symonds to praise his ability to strike the cricket ball, saying that [...] "when you've got that going on at the other end, it makes it a lot easier for me". Despite his excellent form with the bat, White's bowling was proving to be mostly ineffective. For this reason, as well as the improved form of Brad Hodge and the selection of Brad Hogg and Shane Watson for their ability with the ball, he was dropped for the finals of the Commonwealth Bank Series and left out of the World Cup squad.|$|E
500|$|Thompson {{viewed the}} novel as a story of [...] "love and money," [...] noting that some people needed one more than the other. During the writing process, {{executive}} producer Sydney Pollack stressed that the film be understandable to modern audiences, and that it be made clear why the Dashwood sisters could not just obtain a job. [...] "I'm from Indiana; <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> it, everyone gets it," [...] he said. Thompson believed that Austen was just as comprehensible in a different century, [...] "You don't think people are still concerned with marriage, money, romance, finding a partner?" [...] She was keen to emphasise the realism of the Dashwoods' predicament in her screenplay, and inserted scenes to make the differences in wealth more apparent to modern audiences. Thompson made the Dashwood family richer than {{in the book and}} added elements to help contrast their early wealth with their later financial predicament; for instance, because it might have been confusing to viewers that one could be poor and still have servants, Elinor is made to address a large group of servants at Norland Park early in the film for viewers to remember when they see their few staff at Barton Cottage. Lee also sought to emphasise social class and the limitations it placed on the protagonists. Lee conveys this in part when Willoughby publicly rejects Marianne; he returns to a more lavishly furnished room, a symbol of the wealth she has lost. [...] "Family dramas," [...] he stated, [...] "are all about conflict, about family obligations versus free will." ...|$|E

2500|$|For example, {{one person}} might argue erections {{are not a}} problem, and forcing males to cover up goes against their beliefs {{of the human body}} not being shameful. (This assumes the subject is not {{breaching}} etiquette by trying to attract attention, including wandering around.)

2500|$|In July 2009, a {{spokesperson}} for Lopez told People magazine that Lopez was not replacing Paula Abdul on the eighth season of American Idol because she would be busy promoting her film, The Back-up Plan {{as well as her}} new album.

However during an interview with KTU Mornings, Lopez revealed that both the album and film were being pushed back to April 2010. Rap-Up magazine would later confirm that the album and film were being released together in cross-promotion of each other.

2500|$|On 4 April, England were {{up against}} Sri Lanka, and {{struggling}} at 133–6, chasing 236 to win. Nixon {{came to the}} crease and crashed 42 off just 44 deliveries, with two 4s and a superb 6, sharing an 87 run partnership with Ravi Bopara off just 15.2 overs, before skying a Lasith Malinga delivery to Mahela Jayawardene. This {{turned out to be}} the best seventh wicket partnership of the whole competition. His 6 came in the form of a fantastic reverse sweep off the bowling of Muttiah Muralitharan. Renowned as one of the best players of the shot, Nixon remarked after the match, [...] "I've probably hit 20 sixes like that in county cricket – <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> my timing right, it's going to go out of the ground". He had taken England to the brink of victory, having arrived at the crease with the team all but defeated. Bopara was left with the task of hitting 3 runs off the last delivery, but was clean bowled by Dilhara Fernando, as Sri Lanka sneaked a 2 run victory. After this innings, Nixon had a World Cup average of 63 – second highest in the England team to Paul Collingwood, but still better than renowned big hitters Kevin Pietersen and Andrew Flintoff. The figure placed him in the top twenty batsmen – in terms of average – at the World Cup at this stage, ahead of fellow wicket keepers, Brendon McCullum, Adam Gilchrist, Mark Boucher and Kumar Sangakkara.|$|E
2500|$|After Taylor's dismissal, Tatenda Taibu's speedy fifty kept Zimbabwe in the hunt. However, the match-changing {{partnership}} {{was between}} the two all-rounders Malcolm Waller and Elton Chigumbura. Waller played {{one of the greatest}} innings in ODI history as he scored 99*. In the end, he even did not think of his century but to just take his team over the line. His selflessness brought about for Zimbabwe a much-needed victory. His partner Chigumbura scored a brisk 47 and was quite unlucky to miss out on his half-century, bowled by Jacob Oram after he along with Waller had taken the equation below a run a ball. When Keegan Meth was bowled two balls later for a duck, Waller kept his cool as he marshalled the middle order efficiently, assisted by a six by debutant Natsai Mushangwe, and then enough support by Ray Price brought the scores level. After Price was dismissed (caught), it was the last wicket Zimbabwe had and the new man in was another debutant Njabulo Ncube. Waller is said to have advised him, [...] "'No matter what happens, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> bat on ball, let's take the run.' And the run they did take, thereby recording a legendary victory for Zimbabwe. According to an interview later, Waller said that he was thinking of a swing and get the ball over the ground so that both his team could win and he could get a century, but later he though that he would rather take the team home rather than get 100,". Waller was the Man of the Match for his spectacular performance, while Brendan Taylor was Man of the Series.|$|E
