5|$|On 9 May 2010, a {{ceremony}} was held aboard Belfast {{to mark the}} 65th anniversary of end of the Second World War in Europe. Veterans of the Arctic convoys were in attendance to receive medals <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> Ambassador Yuri Fedotov. During the ceremony it was announced that, {{as part of the}} restoration of the ship, two new masts had been manufactured at the Severnaya Verf shipyard near Saint Petersburg. The production of the masts, to replace corroded originals, had been supported by a number of Russian businesses at a reported cost of £500,000. The restoration of the masts involved removing the fittings from both masts, allowing them to be individually restored. The old masts were then cut down in sections, the new masts erected, and the original fittings replaced. On 19 October 2010, the new masts were dedicated at {{a ceremony}} attended by HMS Belfast veterans, by Prince Philip and officials <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> embassy and government.|$|E

Soon after his return <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> front, he participated {{on the side of the}} Dowmont family in the quarrel over the estate of Dowmontów against another magnate, Samuel Łaszcz, located on his lands; soon after the victorious battle against Łaszcz he bought the lands from the Dowmonts and incorporated them into his estates.|$|E
5|$|Another {{attraction}} of the Andriyivskyy Descent is the baroque Saint Andrew's Church. It is located atop a hill overlooking the Podil neighborhood from the Andriyivskyy Descent. The idea to construct the Saint Andrew's Church came <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> Tsaress Elizabeth Petrovna. When she visited Kiev in 1747–1754, she laid the foundation brick of the church with her own hand, after which the church was constructed, to a design by the imperial architect Bartolomeo Rastrelli.|$|E
5|$|Before 1914, Lenin's {{views were}} largely in {{accordance}} with mainstream European Marxist orthodoxy. Although he derided Marxists who adopted ideas from contemporary non-Marxist philosophers and sociologists, his own ideas were influenced not only by Russian Marxist theory but also by wider ideas <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> revolutionary movement, {{including those of the}} Narodnik agrarian-socialists. He adapted his ideas according to changing circumstances, including the pragmatic realities of governing Russia amid war, famine, and economic collapse. Thus, as Leninism developed, Lenin revised the established Marxist orthodoxy and introduced innovations in Marxist thought.|$|E

5|$|Historians {{have to make}} {{considerable}} assumptions {{trying to}} reconstruct the full family tree because of extremely scarce written sources about {{the early history of}} Lithuania. The matter is further complicated by the 16–17th century genealogies, most famously the Bychowiec Chronicle, that mixed legends and facts into one. The legends about Palemonids, a noble family from the Roman Empire who settled in Lithuania and gave rise to the Duchy, are quite popular and widespread in these genealogies. The real historical data comes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> and Livonian chronicles, most important of these being the Hypatian Codex.|$|E
5|$|In 1808, Napoleon and Czar Alexander {{met at the}} Congress of Erfurt to {{preserve}} the Russo-French alliance. The leaders had a friendly personal relationship after their first meeting at Tilsit in 1807. By 1811, however, tensions had increased and Alexander was under pressure <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> nobility to break off the alliance. A major strain {{on the relationship between}} the two nations became the regular violations of the Continental System by the Russians, which led Napoleon to threaten Alexander with serious consequences if he formed an alliance with Britain.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, Sukhoi {{developed}} {{an updated version}} of the Su-33; flight trials began in October 2010. This modernised Su-33 was to compete with a potential Chinese indigenous version of the original Su-33, and to encourage orders <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> Navy. Major upgrades to the aircraft included more powerful (132kN, 29,800lbf) AL-31-F-M1 engines and a larger weapons carriage; upgrades to the radar and weapons were not possible at the time due to funding constraints. According to military author Richard Fisher, it has been speculated that further modifications to a new production batch would include a phased-array radar, thrust-vectoring nozzles, and long-range anti-ship missiles.|$|E
5|$|Talks {{began on}} 30 April 1634, and the Treaty of Polyanovka {{was signed in}} May, {{putting an end to}} hostilities. The treaty {{confirmed}} the pre-war status quo, with Russia paying a large war indemnity (20,000 rubles in gold), while Władysław agreed to surrender his claim to the Russian throne and return the royal insignia to Moscow. Jasienica notes that <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> perspective it was likely that Władysław's abnegation of his claim was more important, in terms of the subsequent increase in internal stability, than the loss of disputed borderland. Despite not winning militarily, the Russians may have scored a diplomatic triumph. Other authors, such as Hellie, support this interpretation.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{conditions}} set out by Tikhon's decree for this temporary autonomy not being met, the American diocese of the Russian church declared self-governance in 1924, against the protests of the patriarchate, {{with which it}} had communication and which was capable of governance had its American branch been willing. The refusal of the American branch {{to submit to the}} patriarchate thus based itself officially on a document whose conditions it had not met. In reality, however, it was a fear of Communism and a belief that the patriarchate had been compromised which fueled the rebellion, paired with a desire {{on the part of the}} Metropolia to dissociate itself <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> Orthodox Church Outside Russia (ROCOR) of which it had been part.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{suppression}} of the Russian Revolution of 1905 and the consequent exile of political dissidents <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> Empire, Russian-language journalism in New York City enjoyed a revival. Among the fledgling publications were a number of political newspapers and labor union periodicals, including Golos Truda, which the Union of Russian Workers in the United States and Canada began publishing in the city in 1911, initially on a monthly basis. The newspaper adopted the ideology of anarcho-syndicalism, a fusion of trade unionism and anarchist philosophy which had emerged from the 1907 International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam and along similar lines in America through the influential Industrial Workers of the World. The anarcho-syndicalists rejected state-oriented political struggle and intellectualism, instead proposing labor unions as the revolutionary agents that would bring about an anarchist society characterised primarily by worker collectives.|$|E
5|$|Franken {{was born}} on May 21, 1951, in New York City, the son of Joseph Franken, a {{printing}} salesman, and Phoebe Franken (born Kunst), a real estate agent. His paternal grandparents emigrated from Germany; his maternal grandfather came from Grodno, Belarus, and his maternal grandmother's parents were also <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> Empire. Both of his parents were Jewish, and Al {{was raised in a}} Reform Jewish home. The Franken family moved to Albert Lea, Minnesota, when Al was four years old. His father opened a quilting factory, but it failed after just two years. The family moved to St. Louis Park, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis. Franken graduated from The Blake School in 1969, where {{he was a member of}} the wrestling team. He attended Harvard College where he majored in political science, graduating cum laude (in the top 25% of the class) with a Bachelor of Arts in 1973. His older brother Owen is a photojournalist, and his cousin Bob is a journalist for MSNBC.|$|E
5|$|In 1892 Rimsky-Korsakov {{suffered}} a second creative drought, {{brought on by}} bouts of depression and alarming physical symptoms.

Crises in the Rimsky-Korsakov household {{may have been a}} factor—the serious illnesses of his wife and one of his sons from diphtheria in 1890, the deaths of his mother and youngest child, as well as the onset of the prolonged, ultimately fatal illness of his second youngest child. He resigned <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> Symphony Concerts and the Court Chapel and considered giving up composition permanently. After making third versions of the musical tableau Sadko and the opera The Maid of Pskov, he closed his musical account with the past; he had left none of his major works before May Night in their original form.|$|E
