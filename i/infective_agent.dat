25|$|The <b>infective</b> <b>agent</b> may be embryonated eggs or infective larvae, and {{infection}} {{is due to}} ingestion of contaminated food, water, or intermediate hosts. As larvae are released into the intestinal area, they can burrow through intestinal walls, travel into the mesenteric veins, and migrate to the alveoli. Here, they undergo a pulmonary cycle, where the larvae develop into adult worms {{in a process that}} may take seven days. After reaching adulthood, M. laryngeus migrates upwards to the trachea, larynx, or bronchi, where sexual reproduction occurs. Egg production begins about three weeks later, and eggs are coughed up and expelled in sputum, or excreted in feces. Larvae may hatch from embryonated eggs outside of the mammalian host.|$|E

50|$|Ferritin {{concentrations}} increase drastically in {{the presence}} of an infection or cancer. Endotoxins are an up-regulator of the gene coding for ferritin, thus causing the concentration of ferritin to rise. By contrast, organisms such as Pseudomonas, although possessing endotoxin, cause serum ferritin levels to drop significantly within the first 48 hours of infection. Thus, the iron stores of the infected body are denied to the <b>infective</b> <b>agent,</b> impeding its metabolism.|$|E
50|$|Scrapie is a fatal {{infectious}} {{disease of the}} neural system of sheep; one of a class of brain diseases that can affect cattle (BSE) and humans (Kuru, nCJD). Scrapie had been thought {{to be caused by}} a 'slow virus' - one that could take years to show as a change in behaviour or movement. By the mid 1960s, it was established that cells could only replicate via DNA. Radioactivity stops cell replication by 'killing' DNA. Alper found that radiation did not kill the <b>infective</b> <b>agent</b> in scrapie, suggesting that a virus was unlikely to be the <b>infective</b> <b>agent.</b> The <b>infective</b> <b>agent</b> had to be smaller and simpler than (viral) DNA. Alper also found that the agent remained active under ultraviolet light. DNA is inactive under UV light. Instead, the agent was killed by light at 237 nm, a wavelength specific to polysaccharide inactivation. Alper and colleagues reported these properties of the scrapie agent - a finding that was greeted with astonishment in many quarters, for it appeared to contravene the central dogma that holds that replication (and hence the growth of the disease and its infectious properties) can only proceed via DNA. However, once these empirical findings were accepted, several theories developed to accommodate the peculiar properties of the scrapie agent. The most widely accepted theory today is the prion theory, which posits a 'rogue' protein as the infectious source. However, Alper could not accept that a protein 'mutation' was the agent. Firstly, her UV radiation studies did not indicate a protein agent and, secondly, isolated prions did not induce scrapie. Her own theories concerning the agent were developed {{in the last years of}} her life and suggested a more dynamic and complex story.|$|E
50|$|Phagocytic {{efficacy}} can {{be enhanced}} by opsonization. Plasma derived complement C3b and antibodies that exude into the inflamed tissue during the vascular phase bind to and coat the microbial antigens. As well as endocytic PRRs, phagocytes also express opsonin receptors Fc receptor and complement receptor 1 (CR1), which bind to antibodies and C3b, respectively. The co-stimulation of endocytic PRR and opsonin receptor increases {{the efficacy of the}} phagocytic process, enhancing the lysosomal elimination of the <b>infective</b> <b>agent.</b>|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: In the {{pediatric}} population chronic respiratory disorders (CRDs) include many pathological entities in which gastroesophageal reflux (GER) {{may play a}} role in the induction or persistence of clinical symptoms. It is not well established whether <b>infective</b> <b>agents</b> may be present in lung aspiration. The aim of the work was to investigate whether different <b>infective</b> <b>agents</b> could be found in children with GER-related CRDs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Extensive microbiological investigations including culture for bacterial agents, serology, direct fluorescent antigen and polymerase chain reaction analyses for different respiratory viruses were performed in 32 children (18 males, 14 females, mean age 5. 0 +/- 2. 4 years). Fifteen children out of 32 considered as "aspirators" (lipid-laden macrophage index-LLMI->or= 86 and pathological pH-assay) were compared to 17 "non-aspirators" (LLMI < 86 and normal pH-assay). RESULTS: Aspirators were older (6. 0 +/- 1. 9 vs. 4. 2 +/- 2. 5 years, P = 0. 006) and less frequently atopic (13...|$|R
