40|$|Nitrides in {{many ways}} are {{fascinating}} since they often appear as superconductors, high energy density and hard materials. Though there exist a large variety of <b>nitrides,</b> noble <b>gas</b> <b>nitrides</b> are long missing in nature. Pursuit of noble <b>gas</b> <b>nitrides</b> has therefore become the subject of topical interests, but remains as a great challenge since molecular nitrogen (N 2, a major form of nitrogen) and noble gases are both inert systems and do not interact at normal conditions. We show through a swarm structure searching simulation that high pressure can lift the reactivity of both N 2 and xenon (Xe), making chemical reaction of them possible. The resultant nitride has a peculiar stoichiometry of XeN 6, possessing a high-energy-density of approximately 2. 4 kJg- 1, rivaling that of the modern explosives.

50|$|In plasma nitriding, the {{reactivity}} of the nitriding media {{is not due}} to the temperature but to the gas ionized state. In this technique intense electric fields are used to generate ionized molecules of the gas around the surface to be nitrided. Such highly active gas with ionized molecules is called plasma, naming the technique. The gas used for plasma nitriding is usually pure nitrogen, since no spontaneous decomposition is needed (as {{is the case of}} <b>gas</b> <b>nitriding</b> with ammonia).

50|$|In <b>gas</b> <b>nitriding</b> {{the donor}} is a {{nitrogen}} rich gas, usually ammonia (NH3), {{which is why}} it is sometimes known as ammonia nitriding. When ammonia comes into contact with the heated work piece it dissociates into nitrogen and hydrogen. The nitrogen then diffuses onto the surface of the material creating a nitride layer. This process has existed for nearly a century, though only in the last few decades has there been a concentrated effort to investigate the thermodynamics and kinetics involved. Recent developments have led to a process that can be accurately controlled. The thickness and phase constitution of the resulting nitriding layers can be selected and the process optimized for the particular properties required.|$|E

One batch of nitride samples with DIGS content similar to the port SARJ (did not fail on orbit) which exhibited almost no nitride spalling after being run on one test rig. Another batch of nitride samples with DIGS content levels similar to the starboard SARJ exhibited significant nitride spalling on the same test rig with the same load under dry conditions.

40|$|Purpose– The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{consider}} the corrosion properties of laser nitrided Ti‐ 6 Al‐ 4 V alloys that have been reported previously by several researchers. Design/methodology/approach– Different kinds of surface nitriding methods of titanium alloys, such as plasma <b>nitriding,</b> ion <b>nitriding,</b> <b>gas</b> and laser <b>nitriding,</b> are introduced. Microstructure changes, such as phase formation and the influence of laser processing parameters in laser nitriding layers of Ti‐ 6 Al‐ 4 V alloys, were investigated using scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope, X‐ray photo‐electron spectroscopy, and X‐ray diffraction. Based on investigations presented in the literature, the effect of laser nitriding on the corrosion behavior of Ti‐ 6 Al‐ 4 V alloy was reviewed. Findings– By regulating the laser processing parameter, the microstructure of the nitrided layer can be controlled to optimize corrosion properties. This layer improves corrosion behavior in most environments, due to the formation of a continuous TiNxOy passive film, which can retard the ingress of corrosive ions into the substrate and can maintain a constant value of a current density. Therefore, the laser <b>gas</b> <b>nitrided</b> specimens have a relatively noble corrosion potential and a very small corrosion current, as compared to untreated specimens.

H 577 M ISE 2015 Chanxi, 152 leaves :illustrations (some color); 30 cmBecause of {{the unique}} {{properties}} as smart material and the biocompatibility, near-equiatomic nickel titanium (NiTi) was widely applied in making biomedical devices. Further improvements in the tribological and mechanical properties of NiTi could bring benefit in improving biocompatibility and durability of these devices. Various surface modification techniques such as PVD, CVD, plasma spraying, etc., have been developed and applied on NiTi over years but all of these techniques have different limitations such as poor interfacial bonding at the surface and long production time. This project investigates the feasibility of applying laser <b>gas</b> <b>nitriding</b> technique to improve the tensile stiffness, wear resistance and corrosion resistance of nickel titanium (NiTi). In the present work, a continuous wave fibre laser was applied to perform laser <b>gas</b> <b>nitriding</b> process under a pure nitrogen environment on the substrate of commercial NiTi plates. A Taguchi analysis was implemented in this project to optimize the process parameters for laser <b>gas</b> <b>nitriding.</b> Optimum parameters for nitriding in terms of output power, scanning speed, beam diameter and nitrogen flow rate were obtained. The optimum set of process parameter for laser <b>gas</b> <b>nitriding</b> was subsequently applied to fabricate titanium nitride (TiN) tracks on surface of NiTi with hardness more than 700 HV. With the optimized parameters, different thickness of TiN single track could be produced at {{the surface of the}} NiTi alloy using laser <b>gas</b> <b>nitriding.</b> Two schemes of combining single TiN tracks were investigated: a) parallel longitudinal tracks for studying the effect of laser <b>gas</b> <b>nitriding</b> on the tensile stiffness of NiTi; b) network grid for studying the effect of laser <b>gas</b> <b>nitriding</b> on wear and corrosion resistance of NiTi. The results from scheme (a) indicate that the amount of TiN surface coverage may not be a linear relationship with the increase of the tensile stiffness of the NiTi. Sample with 40 % TiN surface coverage has the highest tensile stiffness. Using scheme (b), with a 47 % and 76 % grid surface coverage, the average wearing volume are 0. 00495 μm² and 0. 00859 μm² respectively less than that of the untreated NiTi. The corrosion resistance of the NiTi is enhanced as well. The icorr for untreated, 47 % and 76 % grid surface coverage was 0. 5 μA/cm² and 0. 34 μA/cm² respectively. It could be concluded that reinforcement tracks or grid of TiN by laser <b>gas</b> <b>nitriding</b> could be effective in improving the tensile stiffness, wear and corrosion properties of NiTi.
