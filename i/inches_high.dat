The pianist can thus rush headlong through fearfully rapid passages, precisely spanning an octave at each blow.|$|E

The details of this cave seem to indicate that it is perhaps as early as those at Bedsa and Karle, and consequently it is among the earlier excavations about Junnar.|$|E
500|$|Years later, Grossmith's {{obituary}} in The Times {{noted the}} comedian's [...] "nimbleness, his diverting tricks, his still more diverting dignity—the dignity {{of a man}} of few <b>inches</b> <b>high</b> or round—and his incomparable power of rapid speech and singing." [...] The Daily Telegraph wrote of his Jack Point: [...] "Whether giving expression to poor Jack’s professional wit, or hiding a sorry heart behind light words... Mr Grossmith was master of the part he assumed." [...] In 1883, The Times, reviewing a matinee performance of Iolanthe, wrote: [...] "Mr. Grossmith's impersonation of the Lord Chancellor has ... become an exquisitely refined satire." [...] On the other hand, his sketch comedy background had trained Grossmith to improvise comic business. [...] Gilbert and the actor had a famous exchange during rehearsals for The Mikado about an improvised bit of [...] "business" [...] in which Jessie Bond pushed Grossmith, as they kneeled before the Mikado, and he rolled completely over. Gilbert requested that they cut out the gag, and Grossmith replied: [...] "but I get an enormous laugh by it". [...] Replied Gilbert: [...] "So you would if you sat on a pork-pie." ...|$|E

Additionally, a single of the Main Theme was released in 1980, and a disco single using audio excerpts from the film was released in 1979 on the UK label Bronze Records by a recording artist under the name Nostromo. A model kit of the Alien, 12 <b>inches</b> <b>high,</b> was released by the Model Products Corporation in the United States, and by Airfix in the United Kingdom.
