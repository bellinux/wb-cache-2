500|$|The album {{has made}} several top albums lists. Pitchfork placed the album at number ten on {{its list of}} {{greatest}} albums of the 1970s. In 2012, Rolling Stone ranked the album number 429 on its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. In 2003, Blender placed the album on its list of [...] "500 CDs You Must Own: Alternative Rock", stating that the album is [...] "Experimental yet accessible, it’s <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> album that Eno devotees long for from him today".|$|E
500|$|A review {{published}} March 8, 2010 in the Air Force Times cited overall negative {{reviews from}} bomb experts in Iraq {{attached to the}} 4th Brigade, 1st Armored Division, quoting a bomb disposal team leader who called the film's portrayal of a bomb expert [...] "grossly exaggerated and not appropriate," [...] and describing the lead character as [...] "more of a run and gun cowboy type … <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> person that we're not looking for." [...] Another bomb disposal team member said that the lead character's [...] "swagger would put a whole team at risk. Our team leaders don't {{have that kind of}} invincibility complex, and if they do, they aren't allowed to operate. A team leader's first priority is getting his team home in one piece." ...|$|E
500|$|In October 2003, Harisu {{made the}} {{decision}} to leave her management company, TTM Entertainment. However, TTM claimed to hold the rights to her stage name, and announced their intentions to use that name to promote other artists. The matter was taken to court, and in early 2004 the ruling went in favour of Harisu, allowing her to keep the name. She subsequently set up her own company, G Entertainment, in order to make her own decisions regarding her career. In February she released her third album, Foxy Lady, which marked a change from the sound of her previous albums towards a more hip-hop/R style, with Harisu saying [...] "now I am on my own, and showing my true colors, doing <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> music that I've always wanted." [...] The album, however, failed to make the top 50 in the Korean charts.|$|E

Allowing arbitrary transformations doesn't meet that goal: they are much too powerful, being Turing complete unless significant restrictions are added (e.g. no transformations that introduce and then rewrite symbols in a context-free fashion).|$|R

Indeed, it {{strikes me as}} an error of the magnitude of some of Rushdoony's own historical nonsense to consider there to be such a view called Dominionism sic that Rushdoony, Schaeffer, James Dobson, and all the other people in the list somehow share and that it seeks to get Christians and only Christians into all the influential positions in secular society.|$|R
500|$|Loud {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 given to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 67, based on 22 reviews. Jon Pareles of The New York Times perceived a [...] "hermetic, cool calculation" [...] on the album, writing that it [...] "works the pop gizmos as neatly as any album this year, maintaining the Rihanna brand". Entertainment Weeklys Leah Greenblatt commented that Loud shows Rihanna [...] "undefeated by her worst circumstances — and finding redemption in <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> pop nirvana {{that made her}} famous in the first place". James Reed of The Boston Globe called the album [...] "an unabashed return to where Rihanna belongs: the dance floor" [...] and stated: [...] "As if liberating herself from the depths, she's a force on these 11 songs". Stacey Anderson of Spin commended Rihanna's [...] "full, healthy claim to her sexuality" [...] and wrote that the album [...] "offers a confident female ethos on par {{with the best of}} Shakira or Beyoncé".|$|E
500|$|When Blacker {{became aware}} of the {{existence}} of hollow-charge ammunition, he realized that it was <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> ammunition he was looking for to develop a hand-held anti-tank weapon, as it depended upon the energy contained within itself, and not the sheer velocity at which it was fired. Blacker then developed a hollow-charge bomb with a propellant charge in its tail, which fitted into a shoulder-fired launcher that consisted of a metal casing containing a large spring and a spigot; the bomb was placed into a trough {{at the front of the}} casing, and when the trigger was pulled the spigot rammed into the tail of the bomb and fired it out of the casing and up to approximately [...] away. Blacker called the weapon the 'Baby Bombard', and presented it to the War Office in 1941. However, when the weapon was tested it proved to have a host of problems; a War Office report of June 1941 stated that the casing was flimsy and the spigot itself did not always fire when the trigger was pulled, and none of the bombs provided exploded upon contact with the target.|$|E
500|$|Massengale argues that, {{given that}} music is so {{important}} in the Epistles, and that Bellman had more than enough musical skill to write a tune, {{it is remarkable that}} all or almost all the tunes are borrowed. He suggests that this [...] "seems to indicate that Bellman wanted to preserve some vestige of the borrowing." [...] That the borrowing was not just about saving effort or making up for absent skill, Massengale argues, is demonstrated {{by the fact that the}} amount of work Bellman had to put into the melodies for Epistles 12 ("Gråt Fader Berg och spela") and 24 ("Kära Syster!") was [...] "surely tantamount to the production of new melodies." [...] Borrowing was accepted, even encouraged at the time, but that does not explain why Bellman would have done it so consistently. The [...] "poetic possibility", Massengale suggests, is that Bellman wished to exploit the humorous contrast between a melody of one type and a story of another, or between an existing image associated with the melody, and a fresh one presented in an Epistle. In addition, Bellman was able to use what his audience knew to be borrowed music to reinforce the historical flavour of the Epistles, introducing <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> ambiguity that he was seeking.|$|E
500|$|Per the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, {{reconciliation}} {{cannot be}} subject to a filibuster. But reconciliation is limited to budget changes, which is why the procedure was not used to pass ACA in the first place; the bill had inherently non-budgetary regulations. Although the already-passed Senate bill could not have been passed by reconciliation, most of House Democrats' demands were budgetary: [...] "these changes—higher subsidy levels, different <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> taxes to pay for them, nixing the Nebraska Medicaid deal—mainly involve taxes and spending. In other words, they're <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> policies that are well-suited for reconciliation." ...|$|R

500|$|Other reviewers {{were less}} enthusiastic. The Daily Telegraphs Catherine Taylor found the protagonist [...] "a little too credulous." [...] She also found McEwan's [...] "wilful {{narrative}} sadism" [...] sadly {{missing from the}} work. The review in The Economist was even more scathing: referring to Sweet Tooth as [...] "not Mr McEwan's finest book", the reviewer concluded that by the end, [...] "it is hard to feel much of anything for these heroes, who are all notions and no depth." [...] James Lasdun of The Guardian {{found that there were}} [...] "momentous political questions" [...] raised in the earlier parts of the novel, which were not fully addressed by the end. Stylistically, Serena found herself caught in <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> narrative she disliked, but, asked Lasdun, [...] "to what end?" [...] Particularly the ending of the book was polarising. Kellaway saw it as [...] "a good excuse {{to go back to the}} beginning and read this rich and enjoyable novel all over again", while another reviewer confessed that, though the ending [...] "might be enough to send McEwan acolytes scurrying back through the novel to see how he did it... it made me want to throw the book out the window." ...|$|E
500|$|To {{bring about}} this battle, Themistocles used a cunning mix of subterfuge and misinformation, psychologically {{exploiting}} Xerxes's desire {{to finish the}} invasion. Xerxes's actions indicate that he was keen to finish the conquest of Greece in 480BC, and to do this, he needed a decisive victory over the Allied fleet. Themistocles sent a servant, Sicinnus, to Xerxes, with a message proclaiming that Themistocles was [...] "on king's side and prefers that your affairs prevail, not the Hellenes". Themistocles claimed that the Allied commanders were infighting, that the Peloponnesians were planning to evacuate that very night, and that to gain victory all the Persians {{needed to do was}} to block the straits. In performing this subterfuge, Themistocles seems to have been trying to lure the Persian fleet into the Straits. The message also had a secondary purpose, namely that {{in the event of an}} Allied defeat, the Athenians would probably receive some degree of mercy from Xerxes (having indicated their readiness to submit). At any rate, this was <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> news that Xerxes wanted to hear. Xerxes evidently took the bait, and the Persian fleet was sent out to effect the block. Perhaps overconfident and expecting no resistance, the Persian navy sailed into the Straits, only to find that, far from disintegrating, the Allied navy was ready for battle.|$|E
500|$|Production for {{the film}} began in February 2006, with a budget of $20–25 million. Principal {{photography}} {{for the film}} was shot in Auckland, New Zealand within sixty days. Film editing took ten weeks, while post-production, music mixing, and visual effects took a few months. The film was finished by November 2006, because the crew [...] "had to rush" [...] to meet the February 16 deadline. The film was directed by Nickelodeon's Rugrats co-creator and former Hanna-Barbera animator Gábor Csupó, who was first recommended for the job by Walden Media President Cary Granat. Although Csupó had never worked on a live-action film before, it [...] "didn't worry Granat in the least". Csupó stated that {{he was interested in}} making the film because he [...] "had the ambition to do a live-action film for a long time", but that he [...] "didn't like anything until I read this book". He described the book as [...] "beautiful" [...] and said that it [...] "moved [...] ". Bridge to Terabithia was cinematographer Michael Chapman's final film before his retirement. Chapman mentioned in the film's DVD commentary that he retired after shooting this film because he wanted his last film to be a good one; [...] "this is such a beautiful story, and it's <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> movie I want to do at this time in my life".|$|E

500|$|Either way, when Xerxes {{received}} this news, he ordered his fleet {{to go out}} on patrol off the coast Salamis, blocking the southern exit. Then, at dusk, he ordered them to withdraw, possibly in order to tempt the Allies into a hasty evacuation. That evening Themistocles now attempted what {{appears to have been a}} spectacularly successful use of disinformation. He sent a servant, Sicinnus, to Xerxes, with a message proclaiming that Themistocles was [...] "on the king's side and prefers that your affairs prevail, not the Hellenes". [...] Themistocles claimed that the Allied command was in-fighting, that the Peloponnesians were planning to evacuate that very night, and that to gain victory all the Persians need to do was to block the straits. In performing this subterfuge, Themistocles seems to have been trying to bring about exactly the opposite; to lure the Persian fleet into the Straits. This was <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> news that Xerxes wanted to hear; that the Athenians might be willing to submit to him, and that he would be able to destroy the rest of the Allied fleet. Xerxes evidently took the bait, and the Persian fleet was sent out that evening to effect this block. Xerxes ordered a throne to be set up on the slopes of Mount Aigaleo (overlooking the straits), in order to watch the battle from a clear vantage point, and so as to record the names of commanders who performed particularly well.|$|E
500|$|After the {{recording}} sessions were completed, Nirvana sent unmastered tapes {{of the album}} to several individuals, including the president of DGC's parent company Geffen Records Ed Rosenblatt and the group's management company Gold Mountain. [...] When asked about the feedback he received, Cobain told Michael Azerrad, [...] "The grown-ups don't like it." [...] He said he was told his songwriting was [...] "not up to par", the sound was [...] "unlistenable", {{and that there was}} uncertainty that mainstream radio would welcome the sound of Albini's production. [...] There were few people at Geffen or Gold Mountain who wanted the band to record with Albini to begin with, and Cobain felt he was receiving an unstated message to scrap the sessions and start all over again. [...] Cobain was upset and said to Azerrad, [...] "I should just re-record this record and do the same thing we did last year because we sold out last year—there's no reason to try and redeem ourselves as artists at this point. [...] I can't help myself—I'm just putting out a record I would like to listen to at home." [...] However, a number of the group's friends liked the album, and by April 1993, Nirvana was intent on releasing In Utero as it was. [...] According to Cobain, [...] "Of course, they want another Nevermind, but I'd rather die than do that.

500|$|Reviews for 1984 were {{generally}} favorable. Robert Christgau rated the album a B+. He explained that [...] "Side one is pure up, {{and not only}} that, it sticks to the ears" [...] and that [...] "Van Halen's pop move avoids fluff because they're heavy and schlock because they're built for speed, finally creating an all-purpose mise-en-scene for Brother Eddie's hair-raising, stomach-churning chops." [...] He also called side two [...] "consolation for their loyal fans—a little sexism, a lot of pyrotechnics, and a standard HM bass attack on something called 'House of Pain'." [...] J.D. Considine, a reviewer for Rolling Stone, rated 1984 {{four out of five}} stars. He called it [...] "the album that brings all of Van Halen's talent into focus." [...] He stated that [...] ""Jump" [...] is not <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> song you'd expect from Van Halen", but that [...] "once Alex Van Halen's drums kick in and singer David Lee Roth starts to unravel a typically convoluted story line, things start sounding a little more familiar". Although he mentioned [...] "Jump" [...] as having [...] "suspended chords and a pedalpoint bass in a manner more suited to Asia", he went on to state that [...] "Eddie Van Halen manages to expand his repertoire of hot licks, growls, screams and seemingly impossible runs to wilder frontiers than you could have imagined." [...] He concluded that [...] "what really makes this record work is the fact that Van Halen uses all this flash as a means to an end—driving the melody home—rather than as an end in itself" [...] and that [...] "despite all the bluster, Van Halen is one of the smartest, toughest bands in rock & roll. Believe me, that's no newspeak." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper seeks {{first to}} {{interrogate}} {{the ways in}} which two contemporary feminist thinkers (Judith Butler and Luce Irigaray) have appropriated and reformulated a fundamental principle of pre-modern thinking about human action and conduct (Plato’s philosophy of Forms). I will argue that any view on issues of essentialist and constructivist social history which Butler and Irigaray inadvertently raise must first accommodate a thoroughgoing presentation of all available evidence. The second half of this paper explores {{the ways in which}} specific representations of female identity—the gravestone of two citizens of the late-republican city of Rome (CIL 6 / 3. 18524) and the graffito of a Roman “poetess” in the epigraphic environment of early-imperial Pompeii (CIL 4. 5296) —engender (in many senses) <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> tensions and ambiguities which Butler and Irigaray bring to bear on Plato’s philosophical strategies.

This is real and of some interest, but it unfortunately casts very little light on symbolization and language in general, and naming capacity in particular.
