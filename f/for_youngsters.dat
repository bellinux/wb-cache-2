25|$|The Smart Way Reading and Spelling {{program is}} {{presented}} {{in a series of}} twenty-seven individual flip chart lessons. Each flip chart contains a complete lesson that includes both the student and coach materials within one bound booklet. The student sees an image or text {{on one side of the}} flip chart, while the reading coach has his scripted instructions on the other side with a mirror image of what the student sees. The completely scripted nature of the program allows even the most novice coach to work with a student immediately. Extensive training is not necessary. Over time, as the coach becomes more confident, he can add more creativity and interaction in working with students. Rather than stressing individual phonetic rules for the sake of teaching rules, the Smart Way methodology introduces words and word patterns in families, helping students grasp the key phonetic rules through a cognitive learning process. The program was designed as both a complete learning system <b>for</b> <b>youngsters</b> and as an intervention method for older students and adults. Though results will vary, most students will complete each lesson in one to two hours.|$|E
