5|$|Braun {{underwent}} surgery in October to desensitize the pain receptors near the nerves {{at the base}} of his right thumb. The problem was affecting <b>his</b> <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bat. The surgery was performed by Dr. Vernon Williams. Through 2014, he was fifth among all active ballplayers in career slugging percentage, and second among active left fielders in career fielding percentage.|$|E
5|$|In 1788, the Tây Sơn moved {{north to}} attack the Trịnh and unite Vietnam. Nguyễn Ánh took {{advantage}} of the situation to return to southern Vietnam. After rebuilding his army, he recaptured Saigon on September 7, 1788. <b>His</b> <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> south was enhanced by a group of Frenchmen and equipment that Pigneau had recruited, although the magnitude of the aid has been the source of dispute.|$|E
5|$|In {{the post-war}} years, Sargsyan {{tightened}} <b>his</b> <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Armed Forces, establishing {{himself as a}} virtual strongman. After strongly supporting Ter-Petrosyan to retain power, he forced the president out of office in 1998 due to his support for concessions in the Nagorno-Karabakh settlement negotiations, and helped Prime Minister Robert Kocharyan to be elected president. With their relations deteriorated, Sargsyan merged the influential war veterans group Yerkrapah into the Republican Party and joined forces with Armenia's ex-communist leader Karen Demirchyan. In the May 1999 elections, their reform-minded alliance secured a comfortable majority in the National Assembly. Sargsyan became prime minister, emerging as the de facto decision-maker in Armenia with effective {{control of the military}} and the legislature.|$|E
5000|$|Terunoumi was a yotsu-sumo wrestler, preferring {{grappling}} techniques. <b>His</b> favoured <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> opponent's mawashi or belt was migi-yotsu, a {{left hand}} outside, right hand inside position. His favourite kimarite was yori kiri.|$|R
5000|$|Oginohana was a yotsu-sumo wrestler who {{preferred}} grappling techniques to pushing and thrusting. <b>His</b> favoured <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mawashi was hidari yotsu, a right hand outside, left hand inside position. His speciality was uwatenage, or overarm throw.|$|R
50|$|Asahiyutaka was a yotsu-sumo wrestler who {{specialised}} in grappling {{rather than}} pushing techniques. <b>His</b> preferred <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> opponent's mawashi was hidari-yotsu, a right hand outside, left hand inside position. His favourite kimarite were uwatenage (overarm throw) and katasukashi (under-shoulder swing down).|$|R
5|$|Seeking vengeance for Kureha's death, Ryu learns from Murai {{that the}} raiders were from Vigoor, so he stows away on an airship {{bound for the}} empire. Fighting {{his way through the}} streets of its capital city, Tairon, Ryu faces several bosses {{including}} the three Greater Fiends. He defeats Alma in a battle that wrecks the city, but leaves her to Rachel's mercy. Conversely, Rachel cannot bring herself to kill her sister, and instead is taken by Doku, who prepares to sacrifice her in a ritual to enhance Alma's power. With Alma's help Ryu rescues Rachel and destroys Doku's spirit, but with his dying breath Doku casts the blood curse on Ryu. The only way for Ryu to lift the curse is to kill the emperor, so he storms the palace, defeating Marbus who bars his way to the emperor's personal realm. Two successive boss fights must be completed to destroy the Emperor and reclaim the Dark Dragon Blade—once this is accomplished his realm starts to destruct. Ryu must then be maneuvered up a series of ledges to escape, but in the process he loses <b>his</b> <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Dark Dragon Blade.|$|E
5|$|Simon de Montfort {{had seized}} power in England {{following}} his victory over Henry III at the Battle of Lewes during the Second Barons' War, but <b>his</b> <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> country was under threat. In {{an attempt to}} gather more support he summoned representatives from not only the barons and the knights of the shires, as had occurred in previous parliaments, but also burgesses from the major towns. The resulting parliament in London discussed radical reforms and temporarily stabilised Montfort's political situation. Montfort was killed at the Battle of Evesham later that year, {{but the idea of}} inviting both knights and burgesses to parliaments became more popular under the reign of Henry's son Edward I. By the 14th century this had become the norm, with the gathering becoming known as the House of Commons. This parliament is sometimes referred to as the first English parliament and Montfort himself is often termed the founder of the Commons.|$|E
5|$|The realistic-looking {{effects of}} the astronauts {{floating}} weightless in space and inside the spacecraft were accomplished by suspending the actors from wires attached {{to the top of}} the set, and placing the camera underneath them. The actors' bodies blocked the camera's view of the suspension wires, creating a very believable appearance of floating. For the shot of Poole floating into the pod's arms during Bowman's rescue attempt, a stuntman replaced a dummy on the wire to realistically portray the movements of an unconscious human, and was shot in slow motion to enhance the illusion of drifting through space. The scene showing Bowman entering the emergency airlock from the E.V.A. pod was done in a similar way: an off-camera stagehand, standing on a platform, held the wire suspending Dullea above the camera positioned at the bottom of the vertically configured airlock. At the proper moment, the stagehand first loosened <b>his</b> <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wire, causing Dullea to fall toward the camera, then, while holding the wire firmly, he jumped off the platform, causing Dullea to ascend back up toward the hatch.|$|E
50|$|Shōdai is a yotsu-sumo wrestler {{who prefers}} {{grappling}} techniques to pushing his opponents. <b>His</b> favoured <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mawashi or belt is migi-yotsu, a left hand outside, right hand inside position. His most common winning kimarite is a straightforward yori-kiri or force out.|$|R
50|$|Ryan is {{tormented by}} nightmares and {{memories}} of <b>the</b> violence <b>on</b> Earth; {{he starts to}} fear he is losing <b>his</b> <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> reality. <b>The</b> shipboard computer urges {{him to take a}} drug that eliminates all delusions and hallucinations; but he is strangely reluctant to use this drug.|$|R
50|$|Shunketsu was predominately a yotsu-sumo wrestler, preferring {{grappling}} {{as opposed}} to pushing and thrusting techniques. <b>His</b> favoured <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> opponent's mawashi was hidari-yotsu, {{with his right hand}} outside and left hand inside his opponent's arms. He also regularly employed henka, or sidestepping at the tachi-ai or initial charge.|$|R
25|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Laver lost <b>his</b> <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> major tournaments. He played only five Grand Slam tournaments from 1970 through 1972. This was {{partly because of}} his {{contracts}} with NTL and WCT. But on the WCT tours, he remained the leading player and by far the leading prize money winner.|$|E
25|$|Michael Rasmussen kept {{clear of}} danger on the 182.5km flat route from Marseille to Montpellier to {{maintain}} his hold on the yellow jersey. And {{it looked as if}} Tom Boonen would tighten <b>his</b> <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> green jersey with Erik Zabel off the pace, but the Belgian lost momentum on the fringes of the crash in the final kilometre and eventually came home 37th. New Zealander Julian Dean hit the deck along with Iker Camaño, Sebastien Hinault, Marcel Sieberg and Fränk Schleck.|$|E
25|$|With the {{archbishop}} absent, Sverre tightened <b>his</b> <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bishops, and on Nikolas Arnesson in particular. Nikolas was the half-brother of Inge Krokrygg {{and had become}} bishop of Oslo in 1190 against Sverre's wish. After {{the destruction of the}} Øyskjeggs at Florvåg, Sverre arranged a meeting with Nikolas where he claimed to have proof that the bishop had colluded with the Øyskjeggs. The king accused Nikolas of treason and threatened severe punishment. Nikolas submitted, and on 29 June, together with the other bishops, he crowned Sverre as King of Norway. Sverre's domestic priest was elected bishop of Bergen.|$|E
60|$|He {{advanced}} suddenly with hasty steps, {{until the}} body {{that belonged to the}} limp hand and arm had become visible. <b>His</b> <b>grip</b> tightened <b>on</b> <b>the</b> implement he carried. The thing was the figure of a Chinaman lying <b>on</b> his face. <b>The</b> abandon of the pose was unmistakable.|$|R
50|$|Like {{some other}} pitchers, Hernández wears a long-sleeved undershirt beneath his uniform jersey. While {{typically}} {{this is done}} to keep the pitcher's arm from getting chilled, Hernández wears it even in the hottest weather. For him it serves to keep perspiration from running down his arms and interfering with <b>his</b> hand's <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> baseball.|$|R
50|$|Kotoryū {{used both}} tsuki/oshi (pushing and thrusting) and yotsu (grappling) techniques. <b>His</b> {{preferred}} <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mawashi was hidari-yotsu, {{with his right}} hand outside and left hand inside his opponent's arms. Among his favourite kimarite were uwatenage (overarm throw) and tsuridashi (the lift out). However, he most often won with yori-kiri (the force out).|$|R
25|$|As Lord Northcliffe aged, <b>his</b> <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> paper slackened {{and there}} were periods {{when he was not}} involved. But light-hearted stunts enlivened him, such as the 'Hat campaign' in the winter of 1920. This was a contest with a prize of £100 for a new design of hat — a subject in which Northcliffe took a {{particular}} interest. There were 40,000 entries and the winner was a cross between a top hat and a bowler christened the Daily Mail Sandringham Hat. The paper subsequently promoted the wearing of it but without much success. In 1922, when Lord Northcliffe died, Lord Rothermere took full control of the paper.|$|E
25|$|Wesker {{returns in}} the sixth film, , having betrayed Alice and killed {{everyone}} at the White House. Guided by the Red Queen, Alice returns to the Hive where Umbrella has developed a potent antivirus. In a confrontation in the Hive, Alicia Marcus fires Wesker, enabling the Red Queen to crush his legs with a blast door, trapping Wesker. Before leaving to chase Doctor Alexander Isaacs, Alice primes the detonator for the explosives she planted around the Hive and leaves it in Wesker's hand. Wesker eventually dies of blood loss, causing him to lose <b>his</b> <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> detonator. Without Wesker holding the detonator, Alice's explosives destroy the Hive, killing everyone within including Alicia Marcus, the Umbrella High Command and thousands of others held in stasis.|$|E
25|$|With {{the return}} of the Test players the {{following}} summer, Chappell held his place in the South Australian side and was promoted to the number four position, following brother Ian at number three. The highlight of Chappell's season was a brilliant 154 against Western Australia, but his continuing preference for leg side shots was seen as a weakness if he wanted to make Test cricket. During a brief dressing room encounter with the great Don Bradman, then a state and national selector, Chappell was advised to change <b>his</b> <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bat in order to improve his off-side play. Without hesitation, Chappell made the recommended change and at season's end, wrote to the English county team Somerset, asking for a contract to play county cricket to further his development.|$|E
50|$|Tagaryu {{preferred}} yotsu-sumo, or grappling techniques. <b>His</b> favoured <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> opponent's mawashi was migi-yotsu, a {{left hand}} outside, right hand inside position. He also liked uwatenage, or overarm throw, and uwatedashinage, or pulling overarm throw. His most common winning kimarite was yori-kiri, the force out, used in about 40 {{percent of his}} victories.|$|R
50|$|Beara was an {{athletic}} and self-confident keeper, endowed with an eye-catching yet effective style. Thanks to <b>his</b> firm <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ball and <b>his</b> brave attitude, not only {{he was an}} outstanding shot-stopper, but he also excelled at coming off his line. He was nicknamed The ballet dancer with the hands of steel because {{of his ability to}} combine elegance with goalkeeping skills.|$|R
50|$|Karl and Lotte: {{a couple}} who journey to Badenheim for the music festival. Karl has dragged a skeptical Lotte to the town, but it is Karl who loses <b>his</b> <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> reality as <b>the</b> summer wears <b>on.</b>|$|R
25|$|In {{spite of}} this revelation, rather than being granted a break to recover and {{possibly}} undergo surgery Sakuraba scheduled to return to action on December 31, 2006 against Yoshihiro Akiyama at K-1 Dynamite!!. During the bout, Sakuraba was hit with several punches and he rushed to get the takedown, but in doing so he slipped from Akiyama's body. As the sequence repeated itself over and over while Sakuraba took punishment, he opted to drop to his back and attempt a kneebar from there, but <b>his</b> <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> judoka inexplicably failed again. Having Sakuraba trapped against the ropes and struggling for his submission, Akiyama was free to attack with ground and pound for the referee stoppage. Words were exchanged between Sakuraba and referee Yoshinori Umeki prior to the stop, which was {{brought on by the}} sounding of a bell at the behest of Akira Maeda, the event coordinator, the referee separating the fighters following the bell rather than initiating the stop himself.|$|E
25|$|Football League runners-up {{and twice}} champions Preston North End sent an under-strength eleven for a {{friendly}} meeting with Small Heath. The team was further weakened when their trainer {{had to play}} in place of Bob Roberts, who failed to turn up, {{but they were still}} too good for their hosts. Aston Villa did much of the attacking in the semi-final of the Birmingham Charity Cup but Charsley and his defenders were up to their task, and Small Heath progressed to the final by two goals to nil. In the final, at Aston Lower Grounds, Hallam scored with a header after only five minutes, and failed to take a good chance when Wolverhampton Wanderers' goalkeeper lost <b>his</b> <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ball, but at the interval the score was 1–1. In the second half, with both sun and wind in their favour, Heath struck the woodwork several times, but the only goal came when an error from their backs allowed Harry Wood a free run.|$|E
25|$|Kelly {{dominated}} the following spring. He won Paris–Nice {{for the third}} successive time beating Roche {{as well as the}} Tour de France winner, Bernard Hinault who was returning after a knee injury. Kelly finished second in Milan–San Remo and the Tour of Flanders, but was unbeatable in Paris–Roubaix and Liège–Bastogne–Liège. The day after Paris–Roubaix, the French daily sports paper, L'Équipe, pictured Kelly cycling the cobbles with mud on his face and had the heading Insatiable Kelly! referring to his appetite for winning that spring He won all three stages in the Critérium International: the bunch sprint on stage 1, a solo victory in the mountain stage and beating Roche in the final time trial. Kelly achieved 33 victories in 1984. He was becoming a contender in the grand tours, as seen by finishing fifth in the Tour de France. This may have caused him to lose <b>his</b> <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> points classification in that year's Tour. Kelly was wearing it as the Tour was finishing on the Champs-Élysées but lost it in the bunch finish to the Belgian, Frank Hoste, who finished ahead of Kelly gaining points to take the jersey off Kelly's shoulders.|$|E
50|$|Tochinoshin favours yotsu-sumo techniques, {{preferring to}} grapple with rather than push his opponents. <b>His</b> {{favourite}} <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mawashi is migi-yotsu, meaning he likes his right hand inside and his left hand outside his opponent's arms. His most common winning technique or kimarite is yori kiri or force out, but he also uses <b>his</b> left hand <b>grip</b> to good effect by regularly employing uwatenage, or overarm throw.|$|R
50|$|Like many wrestlers, Kasugaō {{was fond}} of yotsu-sumo or {{grappling}} techniques, his most common winning move being yori-kiri or force out. <b>His</b> favourite <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mawashi was migi-yotsu, {{with his left hand}} outside and right hand inside his opponent's arms. However, he was also adept at throws, his next two most often used techniques being kote-nage, the armlock throw, and uwate-nage, the outer-arm throw.|$|R
5000|$|Misugisato was a solidly yotsu-sumo (grappling) wrestler who did {{not often}} push or thrust at his opponents. <b>His</b> favoured <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mawashi was migi-yotsu, a left hand outside, right hand inside position. His most common winning kimarite was a {{straightforward}} yori-kiri, or force out. He was also well known for uwatenage, or overarm throw, and the ring edge throw (utchari), sometimes dubbed [...] "Misugisato's Magic".|$|R
25|$|King Thomas acted resolutely to {{strengthen}} his position. In January 1444, he penetrated the Bosnian-held region of Zachlumia, {{ruled by the}} Kosačas. He was accompanied by Kosača's nephew Ivaniš Pavlović and upon arrival joined by the Radivojević family, the discontent vassals of the Kosačas. The party soon took Drijeva, thus restoring the important customs town to the royal domain {{for the first time}} in three decades. Pressed by his simultaneous war with Venice and receiving no assistance from the Ottoman Turks, Kosača agreed to a truce in March. Both sides hoped to buy time to regain strength for future clashes. King Thomas tried to exact from Venice the promise of assistance in the event of Hungarian offensive against him, even offering 25-year-long control over some of his towns and mines to the Republic in return. Throughout May, however, successful negotiations with Hungary rendered this cession unnecessary. János Hunyadi's intercession with King Vladislaus I led to Hungarian recognition of Thomas in June, for which the grateful King of Bosnia promised to Hunyadi free passage, shelter, an annual income and assistance in any matter. Thus, by summer, Thomas had secured <b>his</b> <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> throne.|$|E
500|$|The Cook County Coroner's Office took 70 day {{sessions}}, 20 night {{sessions and}} 450 witnesses examinations {{to collect evidence}} about the riots. Its report stated that on July 27, 1919, Eugene Williams, an African American youth, drifted towards an informally segregated beach on the South Side while holding onto a railroad tie. He was subsequently hit by a stone as a white man threw rocks at him and other African Americans to drive them away from their part of the 29th Street beach in the city's Douglas community on the South Side. A witness recalled seeing a single white male standing on a breakwater [...] from the raft of the African Americans and throwing rocks at them. Williams was struck in the forehead. He then panicked, lost <b>his</b> <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> railroad tie, and drowned. The assailant ran toward 29th Street, where a different fight had already started when African Americans tried to use {{a section of the}} beach there, in defiance of its tacit segregation.|$|E

5000|$|Wajima {{was not a}} {{particularly}} large wrestler but he had superb technique. <b>His</b> preferred <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mawashi was hidari yotsu (right hand outside, left hand inside), and he was famed for {{the power of his}} so-called [...] "golden left arm" [...] which he would use to down his opponents by shitatenage or inner-arm throw. His other favourite kimarite included yori-kiri (force out) and tsuri-dashi (lift out).|$|R
6000|$|Alton nodded. [...] "Yes," [...] he said.
