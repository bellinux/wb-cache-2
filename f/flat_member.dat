40|$|Graduation date: 1980 Presentation date: 1979 - 06 - 28 The thesis area {{is located}} in north-central Oregon {{approximately}} 20 km west {{of the town of}} Mitchell. The rocks exposed in the area belong to the Clarno Formation. This study supports the informal reclassification of the Clarno to Group status, composed of an Upper and Lower Clarno Formation. An angular unconformity separates the two Formations. The Lower Clarno Formation is composed of a lower Ross <b>Flat</b> <b>Member</b> dominated by epiclastic sedimentary rocks and an upper Heflin Creek Member composed primarily of pyroxene andesite lavas. The Upper Clarno Formation consists of two conformable units, a lower Q,uartz-bearing Andesite Unit and an upper Pyroxene Andesite Unit. A thin sequence of rhyolite flows is found {{near the top of the}} upper unit. Andesite, dacite and rhyolite rocks intrude the lavas and sediments of the Group. When plotted on a Peacock diagram the Clarno rocks are found to be calcic. The chemical variation diagrams and AFM plot of samples, however, follow talc-alkaline trends and compare favorably with rocks considered to be talc-alkaline by others. Most of the thesis area lies on the southern flank of the east-northeast trending Sutton Mountain Syncline. The northeast trending Mitchell Anticline is found east of the project area and the Lower Clarno rocks follow its' trend. The easterly trending strike-slip Mitchell Fault cuts the northern part of the area. Strata of the area show five kilometers of right-lateral movement along the fault. The angular unconformity separating the formations is found in the eastern part of the area and has been displaced by the Mitchell Fault. The occurrence of andesitic talc-alkaline volcanism near consuming plate margins is well documented and it is possible that the Clarno rocks may be the surface manifestations of subduction. It would be well to remember, however, that "Not all talc-alkaline rocks of the interior of the western United States are related to subduction" (Robyn, 1977) ...|$|E
40|$|The Neoproterozoic–Cambrian {{succession}} in the Death Valley {{region of}} the southwestern United States is among the best exposed and easily accessible in the world. The largest single exposure of these strata occurs in the Panamint Range {{on the west side}} of Death Valley, and it, although variably metamorphosed, contains the most complete sections of the Noonday Formation cap carbonate sequence. New geological mapping, measured sections, and high-resolution carbon isotope data for the Noonday Formation in this range enable establishment of a unified stratigraphy across the Death Valley region that consists of three units. From the base upward, they include: the Sentinel Peak Member of light-gray, massive to laminated fine dolostone locally containing vugs and tubes variably filled with micrite, spar, or quartz (and rarely galena), and varying from 2 to 200 m in thickness; the Radcliff Member, composed of feldspathic shale and sandstone and thin-bedded limestone, 0 – 200 m thick; and the newly defined Mahogany <b>Flats</b> <b>Member</b> of gray, commonly stromatolitic, thin- to medium-bedded fine dolostone that is 200 m thick at its type locality. Carbon isotopic trends in the Panamint Range match to within 1 ‰– 2 ‰ reproducibility those known for the equivalent nonmetamorphosed strata in the eastern Death Valley sections. A composite section of the Noonday Formation displays a chemostratigraphic profile with values near − 3 ‰ through the cap dolostone of the Sentinel Peak Member, a decline to − 6 ‰ in the lower part of the Radcliff Member, followed by a recovery to near 0 ‰ and subsequent decline toward − 2 ‰ in the remainder of the Radcliff units and lower Mahogany <b>Flats</b> <b>Member,</b> and then a return to positive values (4 ‰) through the remainder of the Mahogany <b>Flats</b> <b>Member.</b> This pattern matches the Ediacaran cap carbonate in Namibia remarkably well, and, assuming our carbon isotopic correlations are correct, it indicates that Noonday deposition occurred at the beginning of the Ediacaran Period, and that the immediately underlying Wildrose Diamictite of the Kingston Peak Formation probably represents the younger Cryogenian (Marinoan) glacial episode. </p...|$|R

40|$|The Upper Ordovician Utica Formation of the Appalachian Basin is a {{potential}} target for natural gas development. This black shale outcrops throughout the Mohawk Valley in Central New York State. The lower <b>Flat</b> Creek <b>Member</b> is characterized by E-W Mode 2 (strike-slip) fractures, bed-parallel thrusts, and N-S Mode 1 (tensile) fractures. E-W fractures and dilational jogs host the majority of calcite veins, some with hydrocarbon staining and methane-dominated low-salinity aqueous fluid inclusions. Mode 1 fractures host calcite veins and sand injectite dikes sourced from sand and dolomite sourced from underlying Paleozoic strata and Proterozoic basement. Volcanic ash beds from within the Utica are also a source of material for sand injectites.

It supports a possible peer review of Yucca Mountain drill core by summarizing the available data {{in a form that}} allows comparison of stratigraphic units in drill holes with surface outcrops of the same units. Petrographic and mineral chemical data can be used in conjunction with other geologic and geophysical information to determine if stratigraphic relations in Yucca Mountain drill core are geologically reasonable and compare well with relations known from extensive surface studies. This compilation of petrographic and mineral chemical data is complete enough for most stratigraphic units to be used in a peer review of Yucca Mountain drill core. Additional data must be collected for a few units to complete the characterization. Rock units at Yucca Mountain have unique petrographic and mineral chemical characteristics {{that can be used to}} make accurate stratigraphic assignments in drill core samples. Stratigraphic units can be differentiated on the basis of petrographic characteristics such as total phenocryst abundances, relative proportions of phenocryst minerals, and type and abundances of mafic and accessory minerals. The mineral chemistry of phenocrysts is also an important means of differentiating among stratigraphic units, especially when used in conjunction with the petrographic data. Sanidine phenocrysts and plagioclase rims have narrow compositional ranges for most units and often have well-defined dominant compositions.

40|$|Limestones and shales of the Grant Lake Formation (Upper Ordovician; Katian; Maysvillian) {{are well}} exposed in the Cincinnati Arch of {{southern}} Ohio and north central Kentucky, and highly fossiliferous. These rocks document gradual changes in lithofacies and biofacies from offshore nodular, phosphatic, brachiopod-rich limestones and marls to very shallow olive gray platy, laminated dolostones with desiccation cracks, southward along a gently sloping ramp. This study uses facies analysis in outcrop to determine paleoenvironmental parameters, particularly {{those related to}} water depth. Within a tightly correlated stratigraphic interval, we document the occurrence of paleoenvironmental indicators, including desiccation cracks, and light-depth indicators, such as red and green algal fossils, and oncolites. Mapping of facies {{on both sides of}} the Cincinnati Arch suggests an approximately E-W strike. The deepest water environments, exposed near Hamilton, Ohio, comprise nodular bedded, phosphatic limestone facies, dominated by the robust brachiopods. These facies were deposited within the shallow euphotic zone, as indicated by the presence of cyclocrinitid green algae and microendolith assemblages in brachiopod shells, and thus, approximately 20 - 40 m of water for semi-turbid water in subtropical shelf settings (average depth of 30 m used in calculations). The northernmost appearance of desiccation cracks in age-equivalent tidal <b>flat</b> facies (Terrill <b>Member),</b> just north of Richmond, Kentucky (200 km to the south), constrains the position of the contemporary shoreline and allows for the first semi-quantitative assessment of the slope of the Ordovician seafloor at this time. This implies a very gentle ramp with a gradient of about 10 - 20 cm of water depth increase per kilometer in a northward direction. By determining such ecological parameters, this study provides a better understanding of paleogeography and environments during the time of important ecological change...|$|R
40|$|I. Glacigenic {{deposits}} in the Death Valley region occur within the Neoproterozoic Kingston Peak Formation. In the Panamint Range, immediately west of Death Valley, these strata are ≥ 1000 m thick and are continuously exposed for nearly 100 km along the strike of the range. Although these strata are variably metamorphosed and locally exhibit pronounced ductile strain, original sedimentary textures are well preserved throughout the range. Diamictic strata occur in two distinct intervals, a lower one comprising the Limekiln Spring and Surprise Members, and an upper one {{known as the}} Wildrose Sub-member of the South Park Member. Each of these intervals are succeeded by well defined cap carbonates, which, from oldest to youngest, are the Sourdough Member of the Kingston Peak and the Sentinel Peak Member of the overlying Noonday Formation. Between the two glacial successions, the Sourdough and sub-Wildrose South Park units comprise a 300 m thick interglacial succession that includes platform carbonate deposition. Sparse lonestones and striated clasts, along with the impressive lateral continuity of diamictic units, support a glacial origin. Chemostratigraphic profiles of δ 13 C through the Sourdough (- 3 ‰ to + 2 ‰, increasing upward) and Sentinel Peak (- 3 ‰ +/- 1 ‰) suggest correlation with the Sturtian and Marinoan caps, respectively. Potentially economic U deposits (secondary brannerite) occur in graphitic schists of the Limekiln Spring Member and sub-economic U and Th (hosted by detrital monazite) occur within quartz-pebble conglomerates in the South Park Member. The strata contain no fossils, radiometric age control, or primary magnetizations. II. The Neoproterozoic-Cambrian succession in the Death Valley region of SW Laurentia is among the best exposed and easily accessible in the world, and comprises {{one of the most}} complete sections in Laurentia. The largest single exposure of these strata occurs in the Panamint Range on the west flank of Death Valley, but this area has received little attention in comparison to numerous exposures to the east of Death Valley, primarily because of structural complexity and metamorphism. The eastern strata, although unmetamorphosed, occur in isolated fault-bounded exposures and are relatively thin and incomplete compared to the Panamint stratigraphy. These factors, combined with a lack of fossil or radiometric age control, has hindered confident regional correlation, as well as placement in the context of hallmark Neoproterozoic events observed in the South Australian, Namibian and other successions around the globe. New geological mapping, measured sections and high-resolution C-isotope data reported here from the Noonday Formation in the Panamint Range delineate its regional stratigraphic architecture and establish its age through correlation with section with radiometric age control. Carbon isotopic trends in the Panamint Range match to within 1 - 2 ‰ reproducibility previous results obtained for correlative strata in the eastern sections, indicating that metamorphism did not significantly alter C isotopic ratios. The combined lithostratigraphic and chemostratigraphic data form the basis for a revised, more complete stratigraphic framework for the Noonday Formation. A composite section shows that, where most complete, the Noonday consists of three members, from the base upward, the Sentinel Peak, Radcliff, and Mahogany <b>Flats</b> <b>members.</b> New mapping and chemostratigraphic data permit robust regional correlation of a thin dolostone marker horizon {{at the base of the}} Noonday in the Panamint Range as little as 2 m thick (Sentinel Peak Member) with a tube-bearing microbial dolostone in the eastern Death Valley region more than 200 m thick. The data also reveal that the Radcliff Member is bounded by disconformable surfaces and their correlative conformities. These surfaces are recognizable throughout the region and are used to construct a regionally unified stratigraphic nomenclature. A key finding of this study is the construction of a chemostratigraphic profile spanning most of Noonday time. This was greatly aided by the discovery of carbonatebearing strata in the lower part of the Radcliff Member in the Tucki Mountain area of the Panamints, and relating their stratigraphic position to upper Radcliff and younger Noonday strata in the Wildrose Canyon area. The chemostratigraphic profile is a remarkable match for the Maiberg cap carbonate sequence in Namibia, including the decline to a minimum at - 5 ‰, a recovery to near 0 ‰, and then subsequent decline to - 2 ‰. Globally, profiles through many post-Marinoan sequences are either too condensed or lack sufficient carbonate to record these features, including the sections in the eastern Death Valley region. (Halverson et al. 2005). As such, the Panamint profiles represent the first relatively complete record of the post-Marinoan C-isotopic recovery outside of southern Africa. Correlation of these curves (1) firmly places the Noonday at the base of the Ediacaran Period, (2) indicates deposition of 200 m of Sentinel Peak and Radcliff strata occurred between 635 and 632 Ma, (3) supports the hypothesis that the Wildrose Diamictite of the Kingston Peak Formation, which lies in sharp contact below the Sentinel Peak Member, represents at least part of the Marinoan glacial interval; (4) helps identify correlative cap carbonate sequences in key Laurentian sections, which include the Ravensthroat Formation in the MacKenzie Mountains, dolostones capping the upper diamictite of the Pocatello Formation in eastern Idaho, and the middle part of the Mina el Mezquite Formation in Sonora. The Noonday C-isotopic profile confirms that the details of relatively rapid, complex variations in ocean chemistry observed in basal Ediacaran strata in Namibia are globally reproducible. III. The Kingston Peak Formation in the Panamint Range represents the stratigraphically most complete section of Cryogenian strata along the SW margin of Laurentia. Two glacigenic diamictites and their associated cap carbonates, the older Surprise Member and Sourdough Member and the younger Wildrose Member and Noonday Formation (Sentinel Peak Member), provide timing constraints to bracket the inter-glacial succession to between ca. 713 Ma and 635 Ma, the ages of inferred correlative glacial cap carbonate rocks dated elsewhere. This timing constraint is further strengthened by the presence of a sharp decline in C isotopes in the Thorndike Member, which occurs immediately beneath the Wildrose Member; this decline is readily correlated with the global Trezona anomaly. Within the inter-glacial succession, new mapping in the northern Panamints has documented the presence of a previously unrecognised suite of coarse sedimentary rocks herein defined as the Argenta Member of the Kingston Peak Formation. The Argenta consists largely of poorly-sorted breccias and conglomerates containing an assemblage of gravel-sized clasts dominated by granitic gneiss, schist, feldspar augens, vein quartz and quartzite fragments, and locally carbonate rocks. These compositions indicate derivation from a basement provenance and record deposition in alluvial-fan to coarse-braided fluvial settings; their textural and compositional immaturity implies relatively short distances of transport. Mapping shows that the Argenta defines wedge-shaped packages as much as 200 m thick and that the base of the Argenta is a significant angular unconformity. Combined, these features are evidence that deposition occurred during a phase of extensional tectonism interpreted as recording the initial dismemberment of the Rodinia supercontinent. Best estimates place the timing of this tectonism at ca. 650 – 700 Ma. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract in Undetermined A {{national}} debate {{about how to}} transform and to ‘green’ the problematic housing stocks from the boom era {{has been going on}} since the late 1990 s. Different kinds of policy instruments with energy efficiency objectives that address either energy systems, energy sources or construction and renovation of the building envelope have been in use. Some policy instruments have combined green objectives with social rehabilitation of housing areas or financial objectives in times of economic crisis. Many of the policy instruments address private homeowners, private companies, or households that own their <b>flats</b> as <b>members</b> of cooperative organisations. Swedish policy has been very efficient in converting the dependence on fossil fuels for heating to other sources, which has resulted in decreased levels of carbon emissions from housing. However, regulations for energy efficiency in existing multi-family stocks, regarding for example the building envelope, have been neglected until recently. Demonstration projects that have been carried out supported by KLIMP or by the Swedish Energy Agency have shown great potential for reduced energy use, but they have not had a large influence on the sector as a whole (Stenberg et al., 2009). We have discussed energy efficiency in housing with a special focus on multi-unit blocks from the Million Homes Programme (1965 - 74), which represents almost 20 % of the housing stock in Sweden. 22 % of the total housing stock and 50 % of the stock from the Million Homes Programme is owned and managed by public housing companies. The potential for energy efficiency in these buildings represents {{a large part of the}} potential for savings in the building stock as a whole. The critical issue is related to major renovation of multi-unit housing where large energy savings can be made in individual projects (Hellström and Sandkvist, 2010). The majority of housing from the indicated period is in urgent need of renovation in order to deal with technical deterioration, energy inefficiency, and with social problems. As major renovations are only undertaken every 30 to 40 years, or even longer for some components, such as every 60 years for facades (VVS Industry, 2009), the projects that will be carried out in the coming years should aim for at least a 50 % reduction of energy use in order to reach national climate goals for 2050. With the lack of public policy to support energy efficiency in the existing housing stock, the responsibility will be transferred to property owners and managers. Our case studies indicate that energy-efficient renovation projects are possible through commitment, and strong and clear leadership. While technology does not seem to be a major hindrance, and knowledge barriers have been successfully overcome in several projects through industry-research collaborations (Dalenbäck, 2010), there is a major lack of economic incentives for action. Current practice shows that there is good return on minor investments and adjustments to retrofit existing housing for improved energy efficiency, and this is implemented on a large scale. The problem is when a major renovation is needed to address other building issues, because of the higher cost. In our cases, Gårdsten has largely benefited from financial support from external sources while Brogården shows that high ambitions can be achieved through a long-term perspective on investments. Both cases have been strongly enabled by co-operation and support from the local authorities and the owners – the city of Gothenburg and Alingsås municipality. According to SABO, the umbrella organisation for public housing, almost 50 % of the Swedish public housing owners are operating in strained financial conditions, which is a hindrance for major renovation projects (SABO, 2009). Investments in energy efficiency cannot directly be transferred to the rent, and the future energy price is difficult to estimate. One solution is to combine energy-efficient renovation with standard-raising interventions that can be transferred to the rent in what is referred to as ‘total solutions’. However, this is not always effective, especially in housing areas with unattractive buildings and low purchasing power among tenants. Alternative ways to set rents that would acknowledge energy efficiency as a standard-raising investment could be supportive. The on-going debate indicates that one major problem could be the short-term perspective in the investment calculations used by a majority of public housing companies. It could also be that the financial risk of investment in housing developments in areas with low purchasing power is overstated. Alingsåshem seems to be an example of a public housing company with a long-term perspective. Their approach should be further studied and might be an example for wider dissemination. However, the new law on public housing that came into force on 1 st January 2011 dictates a more commercial public housing, which may enforce even more the prevailing short-term economic perspective among public housing owners. In order to reach goals for energy efficiency in the existing housing stock, it can be argued that there is a need for better economic incentives, such as grants or loan guaranties, but also stronger and clearer regulations and increased competence in energy efficiency on the whole in the building sector. In light of the study made of Gårdsten, governmental or municipal financial support for major energy-efficiency investments could also be defended with regard to positive effects from a wider societal point of view. Finally, our case studies, like other earlier studies (Stenberg et al., 2009), indicate that energy efficiency is seldom the main motivation for engaging in major renovation. There seem to be several correlating factors that will influence the behaviour among housing companies regarding major renovations, in our cases out-of-date apartments, lack of comfort and bad indoor climate, technical deterioration, and stigmatized and unattractive housing areas. In order to set up strategies and public policy, it will be of importance that continued research shed new light on not only external incentives that push for action but also the internal processes and conditions (such as owner directives, investment calculation procedures, competence etc.) that lead up to the decision to invest in energy-efficient renovation...|$|R
