50|$|<b>Graphic</b> <b>tablets</b> are {{commonly}} used in the artistic world. Using a pen-like stylus on a <b>graphic</b> <b>tablet</b> combined with a graphics-editing program, such as Illustrator or Photoshop by Adobe Systems, or CorelDraw, gives artists a lot of precision when creating digital drawings or artwork. Photographers can also find working with a <b>graphic</b> <b>tablet</b> during their post processing can really speed up tasks like creating a detailed layer mask or dodging and burning.|$|R
25|$|Psion's MC 200/400/600/WORD Series, {{introduced}} in 1989, {{came with a}} new mouse-replacing input device similar to a touchpad, although more closely resembling a <b>graphics</b> <b>tablet,</b> as the cursor was positioned by clicking on a specific point on the pad, instead of moving it {{in the direction of}} a stroke.|$|E
25|$|Newton/eMate: In 1993 the Apple Newton used a {{precision}} touchscreen which required a rigid and moderately sharp object for input, {{such as a}} fingernail or its included stylus. The Newton's touchscreen interaction was equivalent to a simple <b>graphics</b> <b>tablet,</b> and was used to affect what eventually became the most widely lauded handwriting recognition system on the market. This technology eventually found its way onto the Macintosh {{in the form of}} 10.2's Inkwell feature, sparking rumors of a Newton revival.|$|E
25|$|With his {{recording}} {{studio in the}} same building as his home located in the Hollywood Hills, Franke would attend creative meetings before scoring the on average 25 minutes of music for each episode. Utilising Cubase software through an electronic keyboard, or for more complex pieces a light pen and <b>graphics</b> <b>tablet,</b> he would begin by developing the melodic content round which the ambient components and transitions were added. Using playbacks with digital samples of the appropriate instruments, such as a group of violins, he would decide which tracks to produce electronically or record acoustically.|$|E
50|$|A <b>graphic</b> <b>tablet</b> is {{also used}} for Audio-Haptic {{products}} where {{blind or visually impaired}} people touch swelled graphics on a <b>graphic</b> <b>tablet</b> and get audio feedback from that.

25|$|Flicky was {{developed}} {{over the course of}} one year and was designed by Yoji Ishii in collaboration with artist Yoshiki Kawasaki. The game evolved from a simple game that Kawasaki first envisioned where the player would catch dots in a maze. He took inspiration from a popular song about sparrows on power lines from a 1970s Japanese variety show, Migoro! Tabegoro! Waraigoro!, and so made the main character a sparrow and the platforms and walls wires. However, he found the power line theme boring, and thus changed the background to an apartment building after taking inspiration from one outside his office window. Kawasaki used a poorly calibrated <b>graphics</b> <b>tablet</b> to draw all the game graphics.|$|E
500|$|Dragon Ball was {{serialized}} in the manga anthology Weekly Shōnen Jump from issue No. 51 on December 3, 1984, to No. 25 on June 5, 1995. As the readership of Dragon Ball grew up, {{the magazine}} changed to reflect their changing interests. [...] The 519 individual chapters were collected into 42 tankōbon volumes by Shueisha from September 10, 1985, through August 4, 1995. These saw any color or partly colored artwork greyscaled. For the series' 24th anniversary, the tankōbon received new cover art {{that has been}} used on all reprints since 2009. Between December 4, 2002, and April 2, 2004, the series was released in a collection of 34 kanzenban volumes that retain the color artwork from its Weekly Shōnen Jump run. This edition received newly drawn cover illustrations, and each volume included a poster of their respective cover image. These new illustrations were initially drawn in ink, scanned into a computer and colored using Corel Painter. Midway through, Toriyama changed to drawing them on a <b>graphics</b> <b>tablet</b> and coloring them with Adobe Photoshop.|$|E
2500|$|Pen {{computing}} {{reduces the}} hardware {{impact of a}} system and also increases the range of physical world objects usable for control beyond traditional digital objects like keyboards and mice. Such implementations could enable a new range of hardware that does not require monitors. This idea {{may lead to the}} creation of holographic display. The term gesture recognition has been used to refer more narrowly to non-text-input handwriting symbols, such as inking on a <b>graphics</b> <b>tablet,</b> multi-touch gestures, and mouse gesture recognition. This is computer interaction through the drawing of symbols with a pointing device cursor. (see Pen computing) ...|$|E

2500|$|Before {{he joined}} the game industry, Kamikokuryo had created figurative art of people and landscapes. His primary {{influences}} are realist painter Andrew Wyeth, industrial designer Luigi Colani, comics artists Alex Ross and Frank Frazetta as well as photojournalist Steve McCurry. Kamikokuryo also gives Hajime Sorayama, Katsuya Terada, Range Murata, Akira Yasuda, Ryuichiro Kutsuzawa and Alphonse Mucha as his favorite artists. Some of the tools and programs used by Kamikokuryo are a Vaio computer, an Intuos <b>graphics</b> <b>tablet</b> and the applications Adobe Photoshop and MetaCreations Painter. He explained how his style differs depending on the teams he works with: Yoshinori Kitase's staff would normally ask for [...] "catchy and original" [...] designs while Yasumi Matsuno's would request something [...] "highly artistic in nature" [...] and [...] "faithful to [...] sound foundation" [...] of the team.|$|E

50|$|<b>Graphic</b> <b>tablets,</b> {{because of}} their stylus-based {{interface}} and ability to detect {{some or all of}} pressure, tilt, and other attributes of the stylus and its interaction with the tablet, are widely considered to offer a very natural way to create computer graphics, especially two-dimensional computer graphics. Indeed, many graphic packages can make use of the pressure (and, sometimes, stylus tilt or rotation) information generated by a tablet, by modifying the brush size, shape, opacity, color, or other attributes based on data received from the <b>graphic</b> <b>tablet.</b>|$|R

A virtual brush model, including the emulation of both geometric- and physical-based deformations, is proposed to enhance the veracity of the visual effect. In experiments, the performance of the proposed system is compared with results using a calligraphy brush and a <b>graphic</b> <b>tablet...</b>|$|R
