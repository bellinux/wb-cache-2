40|$|Research PaperFisheries affect {{fish stocks}} through their {{exploitation}} rate and <b>exploitation</b> <b>pattern.</b> Both influence the economic yield from the fish stock. In regulated fisheries, the exploitation rate is determined {{either by the}} acceptable level of fishing effort or catch, whereas the <b>exploitation</b> <b>pattern</b> is determined by selectivity of gears and/or regulatory measures like closed areas, closed seasons and minimum catch and/or landing sizes. This paper describes the process of improving the <b>exploitation</b> <b>pattern</b> in the fishery for Northeast Arctic Saithe in Norway. The process was started in 1996 when the Norwegian Ministry of Fisheries requested the Directorate of Fisheries and the Institute of Marine Research to calculate the biological and economic consequences of increasing the minimum catch size in the fishery. Data on the biological characteristics of the fish stock, the selectivity of the various fishing gears and cost and earnings from the various fleet segments were collected. Using these data, the biological and economic consequences of increasing the minimum catch size on spawning stock biomass, catch and net economic revenue during a 10 -year period were calculated. Regional consequences for the fishermen were also described. The calculated consequences were written in a report sent to various interested parties. Comments to the report were treated and {{in cooperation with the}} fishing industry, new minimum catch sizes were advocated in 1997 and formally established in 1999. Since then, the spawning stock has grown and it is debated whether this growth has been caused by a modest exploitation rate or by an improved <b>exploitation</b> <b>pattern.</b> This underlines the mutual dependency between the exploitation rate and <b>exploitation</b> <b>pattern</b> when managing a fishery...|$|E

40|$|Programming models {{based on}} {{algorithmic}} skeletons promise {{to raise the}} level of abstraction perceived by programmers when implementing parallel applications, while guaranteeing good performance figures. At the same time, however, they restrict the freedom of programmers to implement arbitrary parallelism <b>exploitation</b> <b>patterns.</b> In fact, efficiency is achieved by restricting the parallelism <b>exploitation</b> <b>patterns</b> provided to the programmer to the useful ones for which efficient implementations, as well as useful and efficient compositions, are known. In this work we introduce muskel, a full Java library targeting workstation clusters, networks and grids and providing the programmers with a skeleton based parallel programming environment. muskel is implemented exploiting (macro) data flow technology, rather than the more usual skeleton technology relying on the use of implementation templates. Using data flow, muskel easily and efficiently implements both classical, predefined skeletons, and user-defined parallelism <b>exploitation</b> <b>patterns.</b> This provides a means to overcome {{some of the problems that}} Cole identified in his skeleton "manifesto" as the issues impairing skeleton success in the parallel programming arena.

However, some studies suggest that protecting immature fish is not essential to sustainability because extrinsic factors determine both recruitment and stock status.

The analysis used empirical data for 38 fish stocks of 13 species in the NE Atlantic. Two metrics of <b>exploitation</b> <b>pattern</b> were used and their sensitivity was compared. As expected, exploitation rate had a sig-nificant negative effect on current stock status. Exploitation patterns associated with high proportional fishing mortality of immature fish also had a significant negative effect on current stock status, providing empirical support for the “spawn-at-least-once ” principle. When the fishing mortality of immature fish exceeds half that of mature fish, stock status falls below precautionary limits.

40|$|There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} that fishing causes evolution in life-history traits {{that affect the}} productivity of fish stocks. Here we explore the impact of fisheries-induced evolution (FIE) on the productivity of North Sea plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) using an ecogenetic, individual-based model by comparing management scenarios with and without an evolutionary response. Under status-quo management, plaice evolve towards smaller size at age, earlier maturation, and higher reproductive investment. Current reference points of maximum sustainable yield (MSY) and corresponding fishing-mortality rate (F MSY) that ignore FIE will decrease and cannot be considered sustainable. The {{nature and extent of}} the change through FIE depend on fishing effort and selectivity. The adverse evolutionary effects can be reduced — and even reversed — by implementing a dome-shaped <b>exploitation</b> <b>pattern</b> protecting the large fish. The evolutionarily sustainable maximum yield can be obtained by combining such a dome-shaped <b>exploitation</b> <b>pattern</b> with a reduction in fishing mortality and an increase in mesh size; it is similar to the MSY that would apply if life-history traits were static. Fisheries managers will need to trade off the short-term loss in yield associated with evolutionarily informed management with the long-term loss in yield FIE causes under evolutionarily uninformed management. </p...|$|E

The importance of Mediterranean hake predation on Northwestern Mediterranean anchovy stock was evaluated using current bibliography about biology, population dynamics and trophic ecology of both species, all of which have been extensively analysed. From several papers which include numeric data about hake-anchovy interaction two hypothetical predation matrices have been elaborated.
