2500|$|A <b>key</b> <b>term</b> {{was that}} François and Mary should cease using {{the style and}} arms of the King and Queen of England. As Catholics, they {{regarded}} Elizabeth, daughter of Anne Boleyn, as illegitimate, leaving Mary herself as the rightful Queen. Their use of the English royal arms led the French to dub the campaign the [...] "War of the Insignia". Queen Mary never ratified the agreement, since by doing so she would have acknowledged Elizabeth as rightful Queen of England, {{and she did not}} wish to relinquish her own claim to the English throne.|$|E

[...] Wolf was similarly skeptical of Snowden's, [...] "...very pretty pole-dancing Facebooking girlfriend who appeared for, well, no reason in the media coverage ... and who keeps leaking commentary, so her picture can be recycled in the press." [...] Wolf responded at her website, [...] "I do find {{a great deal of}} media/blog discussion about serious questions such as those I raised, questions that relate to querying some sources of news stories, and their potential relationship to intelligence agencies or to other agendas that may not coincide with the overt narrative, to be extraordinarily ill-informed and naive." [...] Specifically regarding Snowden, she wrote, [...] "Why should it be seen as bizarre to wonder, if there are some potential red flags—the <b>key</b> <b>term</b> is 'wonder'—if a former NSA spy turned apparent whistleblower might possibly still be—working for the same people he was working for before?" ...|$|E

Our method bases on a combination of the following two techniques: Wikipedia-based semantic relatedness measure of terms and algorithm for detecting community structure of a network.

40|$|Abstract [...] <b>key</b> <b>terms</b> are {{important}} {{terms in the}} document, which can give high-level description of contents for the reader. Extracting <b>key</b> <b>terms</b> is a basic step for many problems in natural language processing, such as document classification, clustering documents, text summarization and output the general subject of the document. This article proposed a new method for extracting <b>key</b> <b>terms</b> from text documents. As an important feature of this method, we note {{the fact that the}} result of its work is a group of <b>key</b> <b>terms,</b> with terms from each group are semantically related by one of the main subjects of the document. Our proposed method is based on a combination of the following two techniques: a measure of semantic proximity of terms, calculated based on the knowledge base of Wikipedia and an algorithm for detecting communities in networks. One of the advantages of our proposed method is no need for preliminary learning, because the method works with the knowledge base of Wikipedia. Experimental evaluation of the method showed that it extracts <b>key</b> <b>terms</b> with high accuracy and completeness...|$|R

40|$|For Information Retrieval, {{users are}} more {{concerned}} about the precision of top ranking documents in most practical situations. In this paper, we propose a method to improve the precision of top N ranking documents by reordering the retrieved documents from the initial retrieval. To reorder documents, we first automatically extract Global <b>Key</b> <b>Terms</b> from document set, then use extracted Global <b>Key</b> <b>Terms</b> to identify Local <b>Key</b> <b>Terms</b> in a single document or query topic, finally we make use of Local <b>Key</b> <b>Terms</b> in query and documents to reorder the initial ranking documents. The experiment with NTCIR 3 CLIR dataset shows that an average 10 %- 11 % improvement and 2 %- 5 % improvement in precision can be achieved at top 10 and 100 ranking documents level respectively. ...|$|R

Then stop words {{are removed from}} input question. A list of stop words has been prepared in advance for English and Punjabi. After this <b>key</b> <b>terms</b> are extracted from remaining string of question. Nouns, adjectives and verbs are treated as <b>key</b> <b>terms.</b> Synonyms of these <b>key</b> <b>terms</b> are extracted using bilingual dictionary of English and Punjabi and using Vector Space Model. Query is then reformulated by usage of these <b>key</b> <b>terms</b> and synonyms. Next phase is to retrieve the necessary web pages by applying string matching with reformulation of query. At last our question answering system returns the answers from the web documents extracted by online search engine and then it gives scores to the answer candidates. Finally we can extract top scored twenty answers for our question...|$|R

The steps in cluster analysis are: 1) identifying the <b>key</b> <b>terms</b> in the rhetoric, 2) charting the terms that cluster around the <b>key</b> <b>terms,</b> 3) discovering emergent patterns in the clusters, and 4) naming the motive, or situation, based on the meanings of the <b>key</b> <b>terms.</b> Chapter Three is a cluster analysis of the 2002 San Francisco "HIV Stops With Me" campaign. <b>Key</b> <b>terms</b> found in this analysis are "HIV," "sex," "life/living," and "death/dying.

5000|$|The {{following}} is an excerpt from a speech titled [...] "Americanism" [...] given by Warren G. Harding in 1920 regarding aid to European nations devastated by World War I. Terms bolded are those a critic might associate with the <b>key</b> <b>term</b> [...] "Old World stabilization" [...] and terms underlined are those a critic might associate with the <b>key</b> <b>term</b> [...] "stabilize America."It's time to idealize, but it's very practical {{to make sure our}} own house is in perfect order before we attempt the miracle of Old World stabilization. Call it the selfishness of nationality if you will. I think it's an inspiration to patriotic devotion to safeguard America first, to stabilize America first, to prosper America first, to think of America first, to exalt America first, to live for and revere America first. Let the internationalist dream and the Bolshevist destroy.In this example, the critic would examine the cluster of words and phrases around the <b>key</b> <b>term</b> [...] "Old world stabilization" [...] in order to find certain patterns. Terms like idealize, miracle, dream, and attempt depict reconstruction through aid as an unproven strategy; internationalist and Bolshevist characterize supporters of aid as foreign and Communist; and the ending word 'destroy' implies a disastrous consequence for the proposal. In all, a critic can assume that these clusters work together to present aid for European reconstruction as an irresponsible and un-American plan.|$|E

The story of a narrative entails the normal temporal sequence of events whereas the plot is a distortion of the normal storyline and thus associated with defamiliarisation (Williams 2004, p. 5).|$|E
