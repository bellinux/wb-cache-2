5|$|An overvalued idea <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>false</b> {{belief that}} is held with {{conviction}} {{but not with}} delusional intensity. Hypochondriasis is an overvalued idea that one is suffering from an illness, dysmorphophobia is an overvalued idea that a part of one's body is abnormal, and people with anorexia nervosa may have an overvalued idea of being thin.|$|E

Conditions5, 6 and 7 are and conditions. Conditions8, 9 and 10 are or conditions. Condition11 <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>false</b> condition.|$|E
25|$|A {{public defender}} is an {{attorney}} appointed to represent people who cannot afford to hire one.

25|$|The {{ratio of}} false positives (identifying an {{innocent}} traveller as a terrorist) to true positives (detecting a would-be terrorist) is, therefore, very high; and because almost every alarm <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>false</b> positive, the {{positive predictive value}} of these screening tests is very low.|$|E
25|$|Scientifically, such {{imagery is}} {{generally}} {{characterized as a}} form of pareidolia. This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>false</b> perception of imagery due to what is theorized as the human mind's over-sensitivity to perceiving patterns, particularly the pattern of a human face, in otherwise random phenomena.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} finding <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>false</b> localizing sign, {{the so-called}} Kernohan's notch, which results from compression of the contralateral cerebral crus containing descending corticospinal and some corticobulbar tract fibers.

25|$|False positives {{can also}} produce serious and counter-intuitive {{problems}} when the condition being searched for is rare, as in screening. If a test has a false positive {{rate of one}} in ten thousand, but only {{one in a million}} samples (or people) is a true positive, most of the positives detected by that test will be false. The probability that an observed positive result <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>false</b> positive may be calculated using Bayes' theorem.|$|E
25|$|A {{misrepresentation}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>false</b> {{statement of}} fact or law that is relied on by the other party in entering a contract. For example, in Curtis v Chemical Cleaning and Dyeing Co Ms Curtis took a wedding dress with beads and sequins to the cleaners. They gave her a contract to sign and she asked the assistant what it was. The assistant said it was to stop risk to the beads. In fact the contract exempted all liability. The dress was stained. But the exclusion was ineffective because of the assistant's misrepresentation.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the best-known}} of the meth legends {{refers to the}} method of {{administration}} in which the user will heat/melt crystal methamphetamine and inhale the resulting methamphetamine vapor. The legend states that the drug, once inhaled, will re-crystallize in large amounts inside the lungs, damaging them in the process. This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>false</b> claim as crystallized methamphetamine is always {{in the form of}} a salt (usually methamphetamine hydrochloride), which is highly soluble in water, as well as hydrophilic, and is instantly absorbed into the user's blood stream via the alveoli.|$|E

25|$|Heuristics are {{cognitive}} short cuts. Instead of weighing all {{the evidence}} when making a decision, people rely on heuristics to save time and energy. The availability heuristic occurs when people estimate the probability of an outcome based on how easy that outcome is to imagine. As such, vivid or highly memorable possibilities will be perceived as more likely than those that are harder to picture or are difficult to understand, resulting in a corresponding cognitive bias. The representativeness heuristic is a shortcut people use to categorize something based on how similar it is to a prototype they know of. Numerous other biases have been found by social cognition researchers. The hindsight bias <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>false</b> memory of having predicted events, or an exaggeration of actual predictions, after becoming aware of the outcome. The confirmation bias {{is a type of}} bias leading to the tendency to search for, or interpret information in a way that confirms one's preconceptions.|$|E
25|$|The {{first floor}} {{exterior}} wall consists of limestone quoins {{at the corner}} and stone coursing. A string course with Greek decorative carving is set {{between the first and}} second floors, and acts as the window sill for the second floor windows and as the balustrade for the entrance loggia. The second and third floor exterior walls have stone quoins as well. Between each window on the second floor is a panel inlaid with variegated marble and surrounded by egg-and-dart moldings. The base of the panel is decorated with scrollwork, and the top by a bas-relief urn. Five fruit-shaped clusters decorate the outside frame of the furthermost window on this floor (the lowest cluster supported by a tiny putto), while above each window <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>false</b> pediment topped by an escutcheon flanked by drapery. Variegated marble panels are set between each window on the third floor as well, the bottom of each decorated with scrollwork and a small dramatic mask. The sill of each third floor window is of scrollwork, while the window is topped by scrollwork and a torch. Circular medallions with pendants decorate the outside frame of the furthermost window on the third floor. A bas-relief putto stands atop each medallion and panel, supporting fruit swags. Between the third and fourth (or attic) floors is a molding decorated with repetitive small eggs which serves as the sill for the fourth floor windows. The truncated hipped roof slightly overhangs the walls. The cornice is decorated with dentils and acanthus carvings beneath the roofline. The roof, originally red tile, was changed at some point to asbestos roof shingles with copper flashing. There are seven chimneys on the roof, and about five skylights on the flat section.|$|E
500|$|Creationists {{have argued}} {{for over a}} century that {{evolution}} is a [...] "theory in crisis" [...] that will soon be overturned, based on objections that it lacks reliable evidence or violates natural laws. These objections have been rejected by most scientists, as have claims that intelligent design, or any other creationist explanation, meets the basic scientific standards that would be required to make them scientific alternatives to evolution. It is also argued that even if evidence against evolution exists, it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>false</b> dilemma to characterize this as evidence for intelligent design.|$|E

500|$|The {{scholar and}} {{translator}} Roy Liuzza commented that Tolkien's essay [...] "is usually credited with re-establishing the fabulous elements and heroic combats {{at the center}} of the modern reader's appreciation of the poem." [...] Liuzza at once went on to write, however, that [...] "the separation of the poem into 'mythical' and 'historical' elements <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>false</b> dichotomy". He argues that if myth can condense and hold the deepest sources of tension between self and the social order, and dramatises current ideologies by projecting them into the past, then even the hero Beowulf's mythic fights are at the same time throwing light on society and history.|$|E
500|$|Jackson faced {{numerous}} {{disagreements with}} the song's co-producer. It {{has been reported}} that Quincy Jones did not want the song to appear on Thriller and that he felt that the song was too weak {{to be part of the}} collection, but Jones has stated this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>false</b> rumor. The producer disliked the demo and did not care for the song's bassline. Jones wanted to cut Jackson's 29-second introduction. The entertainer, however, insisted that it be kept. [...] "I said, 'Michael we've got to cut that intro'" [...] Jones later recalled. [...] "He said: 'But that's the jelly! ... That's what makes me want to dance'. And when Michael Jackson tells you, 'That's what makes me want to dance', well, the rest of us just have to shut up." [...] Jones also wanted to change the track's title to [...] "Not My Lover", as he believed that people would think the song referred to the tennis player Billie Jean King. Jackson refused to change the title and asked Jones to give him co-producing credits for the track, as he felt that the finished product sounded close to the demo. In addition, Jackson wanted extra royalties. Jones granted him neither and the two fell out for several days.|$|E
