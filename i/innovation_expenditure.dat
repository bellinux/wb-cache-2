40|$|Non-R&D {{innovation}} {{is a common}} economic phenomenon, though R&D has been the central focus of policy making and scholarly {{research in the field}} of innovation. An analysis of the third European Community Innovation Survey (CIS- 3) results for 15 countries finds that almost half of innovative European firms did not perform R&D in-house. Firms with weak in-house innovative capabilities and which source information from suppliers and competitors tend to innovate through non-R&D activities. In contrast, firms that engage in product innovation, find clients, universities and research institutions an important information source for innovation, or apply for patents or use other appropriation methods are more likely to perform R&D. However, non-R&D performers do not form a consistent block, with several notable differences between firms that use three different methods of innovating without performing R&D. Many of these determinants also influence the share of total <b>innovation</b> <b>expenditures</b> that are spent on non-R&D innovation activities.

We apply the same framework and select the same period (2004 - 2006) to make our study comparable. The modified CDM model considers not only companies that report formal <b>innovation</b> <b>expenditures</b> but the entire sample of manufacturing firms. This approach accounts for underreporting of innovative firm’s efforts, especially among small firms. Additionally, we allow dynamic two-direction relationship between productivity and innovation input and test “success breeds success” hypothesis. Our major attention is given to the impact of the government support on firm’s R&D <b>expenditures,</b> <b>innovations</b> and productivity. The results show that government financial support has positive effect on the probability and amount of firm’s <b>innovation</b> <b>expenditures</b> but not on the probability of innovation itself, neither for process nor for product innovation. The latter finding emphasizes that only the effective government innovation policy may actual positively contribute to the productivity after all. We found that both parts of the "success breeds success" hypothesis work. Firms which have introduced new or significantly improved product in the past are more likely to invest into R&D and {{to come up with a}} product innovator in the future.

According to Deng et al. (2013), total <b>innovation</b> <b>expenditure</b> has considerable influence on new product development.

We find that dominant companies operating in concentrated industries in Australia {{are able to}} generate significant risk-adjusted excess stock returns. Our results for Australian data are opposite to that found by Hou and Robinson (2006) for United States market data. Hou and Robinson reason that United States firms which operate in concentrated industries are insulated from competitive pressures, have lower levels of innovation (Arrow, 1962) and therefore experience lower profitability and stock returns. By contrast, the Australian data show a significant and positive relationship between concentration and <b>innovation</b> <b>expenditure.</b> Therefore, the excess stock returns of dominant companies in Australia are {{consistent with previous research}} linking <b>innovation</b> <b>expenditure</b> with excess stock returns.

40|$|Innovation {{activities}} in the German enterprise sector showed two opposing trends {{over the past two}} decades: While total <b>innovation</b> <b>expenditures</b> grew substantially, the number of firms conducting innovation activities fell sharply. <b>Innovation</b> <b>expenditures</b> hence concentrate on fewer firms. In this paper we analyse the evolution of firms' innovation and R&D activities. Based on panel data from the German part of the Community Innovation Survey covering a 13 years period (2001 to 2013) we use continuous-time Markov-Chains to analyse the changing properties of the firms' choices to conduct R&D and non-R&D innovation activities. Our findings are threefold. As compared to the pre-crisis period 2001 - 2007 there is a considerable change in innovation and R&D behaviour of German firms from 2008 onwards with an increasing number of firms exiting R&D and innovation activities. Smaller firms are the main driver behind this process, particularly with regard to quitting non-R&D innovation activities. Although smaller firms were also less likely to move to higher levels of innovativeness and R&D engagement and more likely to fall back in the pre-crisis period, these trends have been more pronounced in the crisis and even in the post-crisis period. Both public innovation support and better financial capabilities can increase the rate chances to move to higher levels of innovativeness and reduce the chances to fall back...|$|R

40|$|R&D {{expenditures}} {{of firms}} varies vastly between and within industries. In recent years {{a lot of}} theoretical and empirical studies attempted to explain the distribution of R&D expenditures. Four main factors repeatedly appeared in this literature: Firm size, market power, appropriability and technological opportunity. The present paper tests the empirical content of the hypotheses raised in this literature. It employs the data of {{the first wave of}} the Mannheim Innovation Panel conducted in 1993. Our study divers from the literature in several aspects: (1) The data covers firms from all size classes. The questionaire was designed to minimize the undercounting problem of R&D in small firms. (2) Besides a traditional definition of R&D we also used the concept of total <b>innovation</b> <b>expenditures</b> to capture the importance of non R& D innovation activities which are especially important for small firms. (3) We give reliable estimates on the occurrence of R&D and innovation activities in small and medium sized enterprises in Germany. (4) Our data base includes R&D performers as well as non-R&D performers. (5) We distinguish between the decision to perform R&D or not and the decision on the amount invested in R&D. We show that there are several differences with respect to both stages. As our survey collects information on several R&D enhancing characteristics of firm and market we are able to employ a more extended set of variables explaining R&D performance than most previous studies. The main results can be summarized as follows: (1) Once small firms have decided to invest in innovation activities, the amount they invest as a percentage of sales is larger than the innovation intensity of big firms. On the other hand, the probability that a firm is engaged in R&D increases strongly with firm size. The large and small firms differential in intensity can even be more pronounced if we use total <b>innovation</b> <b>expenditures</b> instead of the narrowly defined R&D expenditures only. (2) Evidence of a positive relationship between seller concentration and innovation input is rather weak. (3) Stronger appropriability conditions and higher technological opportunities enhance firms spending on investment in innovation activities and/or in R&D. (4) Certain other firm characteristics (exporting firm, financial constraints) play a role in determining <b>innovation</b> <b>expenditures</b> and R&D expenditures. [...] ...|$|R
