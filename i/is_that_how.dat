2500|$|As a child, Murray's {{family lived}} in poverty and were {{constantly}} moving to different areas of London, which meant that he was often bullied and involved in fights. By the time his family settled in Clapton in 1970, Murray joined a skinhead gang and [...] "had a violent {{couple of years of}} being out on the street." [...] He developed an interest in rock music when he was 15 after hearing [...] "Voodoo Chile" [...] by Jimi Hendrix on the radio, about which he recalls, [...] "everything changed, just like that. Getting into rock music wasn't like a gradual process for me; it was completely sort of extreme, totally black and white. I heard 'Voodoo Chile' on the radio and I thought, 'Bloody hell! What <b>is</b> <b>THAT?</b> <b>How</b> do you do THAT?' And I started hanging around the rock music section of the record stores and buying albums, thinking about getting into the big time, wondering what that would be like." [...] After [...] "hanging 'round record stores" [...] and acquiring several Hendrix and blues albums, Murray decided to take up the guitar. At 16, he formed his first band, a trio called Stone Free, which also included Adrian Smith on vocals, who would also become a member of Iron Maiden in 1980. From there, Murray would answer ads in Melody Maker and regularly audition for different bands at the weekend, leading to short stints in Electric Gas, [...] "this sort of soft-rock, American-type band," [...] and The Secret, [...] "this sort of mad punk band," [...] with whom he would record a single, [...] "Café De Dance", in 1975.|$|E
