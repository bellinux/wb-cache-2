30|$|Conventional {{methods to}} {{mitigate}} inter-cell <b>interference</b> mainly involve various orthogonalization-based processing.

The vector-space <b>interference</b> alignment (IA) scheme is an advanced orthogonalization-based <b>interference</b> coordination scheme, where multiple <b>interference</b> are aligned in a subspace while leave the orthogonal signal subspace interference-free [8, 9]. However, the orthogonalization-based processing schemes are only efficient when the <b>interference</b> has similar strength with the desired signal.

5|$|To {{overcome}} these challenges, researchers have employed various solutions. Astronomical interferometry, first conceived by Hippolyte Fizeau in 1868, was the seminal concept that has enabled major improvements in modern telescopy {{and led to}} the creation of the Michelson interferometer in the 1880s, and the first successful measurement of Betelgeuse. Just as human depth perception increases when two eyes instead of one perceive an object, Fizeau proposed the observation of stars through two apertures instead of one to obtain <b>interferences</b> that would furnish information on the star's spatial intensity distribution. The science evolved quickly and multiple-aperture interferometers are now used to capture speckled images, which are synthesized using Fourier analysis to produce a portrait of high resolution. It was this methodology that identified the hotspots on Betelgeuse in the 1990s. Other technological breakthroughs include adaptive optics, space observatories like Hipparcos, Hubble and Spitzer, and the Astronomical Multi-BEam Recombiner (AMBER), which combines the beams of three telescopes simultaneously, allowing researchers to achieve milliarcsecond spatial resolution.|$|E

On the May 5 episode of Impact!, James made her first successful title defense against Ms. Tessmacher. On May 15 at Sacrifice, James successfully defended her title against Madison Rayne and in the process helped Tara get a release from her alliance with Rayne. The following month at Slammiversary IX, James successfully defended her title against Angelina Love, however after the match both Love and Winter attacked her. On June 18, James made her debut for TNA's Mexican partner Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide (AAA) at Triplemanía XIX, where she teamed with Angelina Love, Sexy Star and Velvet Sky to defeat Cynthia Moreno, Faby Apache, Lolita and Mari Apache in an eight-woman tag team match. James returned to AAA on July 9, teaming with Sexy Star to defeat the Apaches in a tag team match, after which she challenged Mari to a match for her AAA Reina de Reinas Championship. On July 31 at Verano de Escándalo, James competed in an eight–way match for the Reina de Reinas Championship, becoming the last person eliminated by the new champion, Pimpinela Escarlata. On the June 23 episode of Impact Wrestling, James was defeated by Winter in a non-title Street Fight, following outside interference from Love. This led to a match on August 7 at Hardcore Justice, where James lost the Knockouts Championship to Winter, following multiple <b>interferences</b> from Love and a red mist from Winter. On the following episode of Impact Wrestling, James defeated Madison Rayne to earn a rematch for the title. On the September 1 episode of Impact Wrestling, James defeated Winter to win her second TNA Knockouts Championship. On September 11 at No Surrender, James dropped the title back to Winter.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{capacity}} of discrete memoryless many-to-one <b>interference</b> channels, i. e., K user <b>interference</b> channels where only one receiver faces <b>interference.</b> For a class of many-to-one <b>interference</b> channels, we identify a noisy <b>interference</b> regime, i. e., a regime where random coding and treating <b>interference</b> as noise achieves sum-capacity. Specializing our results to the Gaussian MIMO many-to-one <b>interference</b> channel, which is a special case {{of the class of}} channels considered, we obtain new capacity results. Firstly, we extend the noisy <b>interference</b> regime, previously studied for (many-to-one) <b>interference</b> channels with average power constraints on the inputs, to a more general class of inputs. This more general class includes the practical scenario of inputs being restricted to fixed finite-size constellations such as PSK or QAM. Secondly, we extend noisy <b>interference</b> results previously studied in SISO <b>interference</b> channels with full channel state information (CSI) at all nodes, to MIMO and parallel Gaussian many-to-one <b>interference</b> channels, and to fading Gaussian many-to-one <b>interference</b> channels without CSI at the transmitters. While the many-to-one <b>interference</b> channel requires <b>interference</b> alignment, which in turn requires structured codes in general, we argue that in the noisy <b>interference</b> regime, <b>interference</b> is implicitly aligned by random coding irrespective of the input distribution. As a byproduct of our study, we identify a second class of many-to-one <b>interference</b> channels (albeit deterministic) where random coding is optimal (though <b>interference</b> is not treated as noise). The optimality of random coding in this second class of channels is due to an <b>interference</b> resolvability condition which precludes <b>interference</b> alignment and hence obviates the need of structured codes.

Even though all four types of <b>interference</b> competition reduce population biomass, <b>interference</b> competition at intermediate intensity sometimes significantly increases the abundance of adult individuals and the population's reproduction rate. We find that foraging and metabolic <b>interference</b> evolutionarily favor smaller maturation size when <b>interference</b> is weak and larger maturation size when <b>interference</b> is strong. The evolutionary response to survival <b>interference</b> and reproductive <b>interference</b> is always larger maturation size.

Like other types of trait-mediated competition, all four types of <b>interference</b> competition can induce disruptive selection and thus promote initial diversification.

However, when two users retransmit their information simultaneously in the same strong <b>interference</b> subchannel, they also interfere with each other. In [14], this problem was simplified by only using individual coding on strong <b>interference</b> subchannels. In [15], considering a specific scenario, only one user was allowed to transmit on these strong <b>interference</b> subchannels. In [16], a capacity-achieving joint coding scheme was proposed for two-user two-subchannel symmetric deterministic <b>interference</b> channel, but the proof of capacity achieving is divided into multiple subcases, and the corresponding joint coding schemes are respectively designed for each subcase. Due to the lack of systematic design principle, this scheme is hard to be generalized to parallel <b>interference</b> channel with multiple subchannels and multiple users. In [17], the parallel symmetric two-user <b>interference</b> channels were studied when the <b>interference</b> is bursty and feedback is available from the receivers. With the help of channel bursty and feedback, the subchannel in very strong <b>interference</b> regime can help to recover the signals for subchannels in strong and weak <b>interference</b> regime. However, the scheme does not work in constant <b>interference</b> channels, and there is no mechanism to let the strong <b>interference</b> subchannel help the weak <b>interference</b> subchannel.|$|R
