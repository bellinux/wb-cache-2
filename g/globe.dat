5|$|Franklin's machine used a {{belt and}} pulley system that could be {{operated}} by one person turning a crank. A large pulley {{was attached to the}} crank-handle, and a much smaller pulley was attached to a large glass <b>globe.</b> An iron axle passed through the <b>globe.</b> This allowed the <b>globe</b> to be rotated at high speed. When the crank was turned, the glass <b>globe</b> rubbed against a leather pad, which generated a large static charge, similar to the electrical charge that could be created by rubbing a glass tube with wool cloth by hand. The machine was unique improvement over others made in Europe at the time, as the glass <b>globe</b> could be spun faster with much less labor. A few revolutions of the handle was all that was needed to charge a Leyden jar.|$|E

50|$|In America, {{during the}} 1940s, snow <b>globes</b> were {{often used for}} advertising. In Europe, during the 1940s and 1950s, {{religious}} snow <b>globes</b> were common gifts for Catholic children. Snow <b>globes</b> have appeared {{in a number of}} film scenes, the most famous of which is the opening of the 1941 classic Citizen Kane.In the 1950s, the <b>globes,</b> which were previously made of glass, became available in plastic.

Snow <b>globes</b> feature diverse scenes, ranging from the typical holiday souvenirs to more eclectic collectibles featuring Christmas scenes, Disney characters, popular icons, animals, military figures, historical scenes, etc. Snow <b>globes</b> have even been used for election campaigns. Since 2000 fashion and luxury brands, such as Louis Vuitton, Ladurée, Sonia Rykiel, or Martin Margiela, got hold of the trend and grew particularly fond of snow <b>globes</b> as collectible totems and emblems of their brand image. Such enthusiasm was reinforced by presence in numerous art collections of contemporary artists Walter Martin & Paloma Muñoz (also known as Martin & Muñoz) who use snow <b>globes</b> as a medium, or museums who paid tribute to famous artists such as French sculptor Auguste Rodin in creating high quality numbered glass dome snow <b>globes.</b>|$|R
