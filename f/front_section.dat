Having already {{acted in}} or written {{for a number}} of films and {{television}} shows (including popular American television series Heroes), Kitamura was a relatively experienced actor compared to other cast members. He auditioned for the role of Katsuro via Skype from Los Angeles after the casting director saw him on television and recommended him for the role. The rest of the cast did not meet Kitamura until the day before shooting commenced.|$|E

5|$|In mid 1962, {{the wreck}} of U-20 was {{discovered}} in the northern Adriatic. Italian salvage crews raised the boat's rear portion on 22 July and her <b>front</b> <b>section</b> on 21 November. The conning tower and a small midships section of U-20 were donated to the Heeresgeschichtliches Museum in Vienna, where they are on display, {{while the rest of}} the boat was scrapped.

5|$|Titanics down angle altered fairly rapidly {{from zero}} degrees to about {{four and a}} half degrees during the first hour after the collision, but {{the rate at which the}} ship went down slowed greatly for the second hour, {{worsening}} only to about five degrees. This gave many of those aboard a false sense of hope that the ship might stay afloat long enough for them to be rescued. By 1:30, the sinking rate of the <b>front</b> <b>section</b> increased until Titanic reached a down angle of about ten degrees.|$|E
5|$|The body of {{the coconut}} crab is, like that of all decapods, divided into a <b>front</b> <b>section</b> (cephalothorax), which has 10 legs, and an abdomen. The front-most pair of legs has large chelae (claws), with the left being larger than the right. The next two pairs, as with other hermit crabs, are large, {{powerful}} walking legs with pointed tips, which allow coconut crabs to climb vertical or overhanging surfaces. The fourth pair of legs is smaller with tweezer-like chelae at the end, allowing young coconut crabs to grip {{the inside of a}} shell or coconut husk to carry for protection; adults use this pair for walking and climbing. The last pair of legs is very small and is used by females to tend their eggs, and by the males in mating. This last pair of legs is usually held inside the carapace, in the cavity containing the breathing organs. There is some difference in color between the animals found on different islands, ranging from orange-red to purplish blue; in most regions, blue is the predominant color, but in some places, including the Seychelles, most individuals are red.|$|E

5|$|Saturday afternoon's {{qualifying}} session {{lasted for}} 75 minutes. The cars were {{split into two}} groups with the leading championship point-standing leaders and the fastest two drivers from the previous road course race composing the second group. Both groups were allowed 30 minutes on the circuit with a 15-minute break in {{between the two groups}} recording their lap times. Weather conditions were warm for the 75-minute session. De Ferran clinched his first pole position of the season, his second at Toronto, and the twelfth of his career with a time of 57.703 seconds. He was joined on the grid's front row by teammate Castroneves and had the pole position until de Ferran's lap. Bräck qualified third, Kanaan fourth and Tagliani fifth (all three drivers went off into the track's run-off areas but continued without damaging their cars.) Franchitti, Fernández, Tracy, Roberto Moreno and Scott Dixon rounded out the top ten qualifiers. Servià was the fastest driver not to qualify in the top ten; his best lap time was 0.534 seconds off de Ferran's pace. He was followed by Carpentier in twelfth. Andretti, 13th, slid and hit the turn one tire barrier lightly with the left <b>front</b> <b>section</b> of his nose cone; he later contacted the turn five wall with his right-rear tire on his final timed lap. Fittipaldi took 14th position, ahead of Herta who spun at turn nine without damaging his car. Vasser, da Matta, Michel Jourdain Jr., Gugelmin, Junqueira filled the next five places on the grid. Papis took 21st and was joined by Tora Takagi on the grid's eleventh row. 23rd-place qualifier Gidley made contact with Carpentier who was braking heavily for the turn eight right-hander and Gidley damaged his front suspension heavily with his front wheels out of line. Both drivers were unhurt. Zanardi took 24th position. Wilson and Nakano qualified {{at the back of the}} grid in 25th and 26th places; Wilson closely followed Nakano on his first timed lap made heavy contact with the rear-left of Nakano's car and went airborne briefly. Both drivers were uninjured but switched to their back-up cars as their primary chassis were heavily damaged.|$|E

40|$|Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) {{with respect}} to the {{proposed}} Flexible Target Family (FTF). The FTF would streamline MDA’s target acquisition process by using a collection of common boosters, <b>front</b> <b>sections,</b> and components to assemble a variety of different target configurations. Specialized equipment used to transport, test, and handle assembled targets is also part of the FTF and is considered in the analysis documented in the FTF Environmental Analysis (EA). MDA has determined that the EA prepared for the FTF represents an accurate and adequate analysis of the scope and level of associated environmental impacts. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED ACTION: MDA proposes to streamline its target development and acquisition process by using common processes and procedures, and common core components to assemble a standardized inventory of target boosters, <b>front</b> <b>sections,</b> and components. This would increase target reliability, minimize cost, and reduce target production time. The EA considers the development, preparation, assembly, integration, testing, transportation, and use of the FTF to support BMDS testing. Development would consis...|$|R

5000|$|The current sound {{reinforcement}} {{system is}} a line-array configuration of multiple loudspeaker enclosures hung vertically in a curved manner, with the lower enclosures facing the <b>front</b> <b>sections,</b> and the upper enclosures angled towards the rear sections. It is manufactured by L'Acoustics, and includes state-of-the-art audio processing allowing each individual loudspeaker enclosure to be [...] "tuned" [...] and directed towards the near-precise location of the listener, regardless of where in the venue they are sitting. This results in the audience in the rear sections hearing the same audio, at the same level, as in the <b>front</b> <b>sections.</b> This electronic processing includes sound level, frequency equalization, occasional special effects, and time delay (sound passes through wire much faster than through air, therefore the sound coming from the speakers must be delayed, allowing the actual sound from the stage to [...] "catch up" [...] so both sources reach the listeners' ears simultaneously). The system is maintained by Rat Sound Systems, the same company that has provided audio for the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival {{commonly known as the}} Coachella Festival, since its inception.|$|R

25|$|The {{modifications}} to the Concord started with a two-door sedan monocoque (unitized) body. To add strength to the platform after the removal of its roof, fourteen steel reinforcements were welded to the undercarriage and a steel targa roll bar was welded to the door pillars for rigidity, as well as additional passenger compartment protection. The <b>front</b> <b>section</b> of the roof (ahead of the targa bar) was a removable lightweight fiberglass hatch, while the rear section of polyvinyl material folded and included a tonneau cover {{for use in the}} down position.|$|E
25|$|The Caproni Ca.60 Transaereo, a huge, nine-winged, eight-engine flying boat, {{conceived}} as a 100-passenger transatlantic airliner, was tested without success in 1921.

The only surviving parts (the two side floats, the <b>front</b> <b>section</b> of the main, central hull, one of the Liberty L-12 engines and the control panel) are on display at the Gianni Caproni Museum of Aeronautics, where they have been moved in 2011.|$|E

30|$|In the {{remainder}} of the paper, we consider two distinct problems associated with the presence of an unstable zero-activity state in the neural field model (Equation 2.1). First, how do slowly varying spatial heterogeneities in the synaptic weights affect the speed of propagating pulled <b>fronts</b> (<b>Sections</b> 3 and 4)? Second, what is the estimated time for extinction of a stable steady state in the presence of multiplicative extrinsic noise (Sections 5 and 6)? Both problems are linked from a methodological perspective since the corresponding analysis reduces to solving an effective Hamiltonian dynamical system.|$|R
