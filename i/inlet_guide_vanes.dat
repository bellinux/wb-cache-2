25|$|The {{arrays of}} {{airfoils}} {{are set in}} rows, usually as pairs: one rotating and one stationary. The rotating airfoils, also known as blades or rotors, accelerate the fluid. The stationary airfoils, also known as stators or vanes, decelerate and redirect the flow direction of the fluid, preparing it for the rotor blades of the next stage. Axial compressors are almost always multi-staged, with the cross-sectional area of the gas passage diminishing along the compressor to maintain an optimum axial Mach number. Beyond about 5 stages or a 4:1 design pressure ratio a compressor will not function unless fitted with features such as stationary vanes with variable angles (known as variable <b>inlet</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vanes</b> and variable stators), the ability to allow some air to escape part-way along the compressor (known as interstage bleed) and being split into more than one rotating assembly (known as twin spools, for example).|$|E

To achieve this, the initial design used a low-pressure (LP) axial compressor and a high-pressure (HP) centrifugal compressor, each being driven by its own single-stage turbine. This two-spool design eliminated the need for features such as variable <b>inlet</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vanes</b> (Avon, J79), inlet ramps (J65), variable stators (J79) or compressor bleed (Avon) which were required on single spool compressors with pressure ratios above about 6:1. Without these features an engine could not be started nor run at low speeds without destructive blade vibrations. Nor could they accelerate to high speeds with fast acceleration times ("spool up") without surge. The design was progressively modified and the centrifugal HP compressor was replaced by an axial HP compressor.

40|$|In a VAV (variable air volume) system, the {{set point}} of the static {{pressure}} (usually measured at 213 downstream of the main supply air duct) is maintained by modulating the fan speed or <b>inlet</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> position. The set {{point of the}} static pressure is often set at a constant value, which is adequate to provide design flow to each room. This method consumes more fan power than necessary under partial load conditions. The fan speed or <b>inlet</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> can also be controlled based on the maximum damper position of the terminal boxes. This method is called air volume control logic. Under this control logic, terminal box airflow requirements are met with reduced static pressure. Fan power consumption is minimized.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{an analysis of}} moveable <b>inlet</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> operation for use in active control of rotating stall in axial flow compressors. The results indicate that blade deflections needed (in degrees) are approximately {{one half of the}} sensed axial velocity disturbance (in percent). Models were developed for the blade row, the control perturbations launched by the moving blades, and the compressor. These models were used in a parametric study which showed that from a control wave launching point of view, airfoil camber and mean flow turning of the cascade are unimportant, whereas fraction of blades moved and solidity are the key parameters. Furthermore, the compressor model lead to the result that the more in phase the blade misstaggering is with the velocity disturbance, the more effective the control is. These results were then used to design and build an <b>inlet</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> row of 12 blades for testing as a stall control device...|$|R
40|$|The overall {{performance}} of a fan stage with nine <b>inlet</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> angle settings is presented. These data were obtained over the stable flow range at speeds from 60 to 120 percent of design for vane setting angles from - 25 to 42. 5 degrees. At design speed and design <b>inlet</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> angle, the stage has a peak efficiency of 0. 892 at a pressure ratio of 1. 322 and a flow of 25. 31 kg/s. The stall margin based on peak efficiency and stall was 20 percent. Based on an operating line passing through the peak efficiency point at the design setting angle, the useful operating range of the stage at design speed is limited by stall at the positive setting angles and by choke at the negative angles.

40|$|Variable <b>inlet</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> (IGV) is used {{to control}} the mass flow and {{generate}} prewhirl in centrifugal compressors.

After optimization, the regulating performance of IGV has improved significantly, the prewhirl ability has been enhanced greatly, and the pressure loss has been reduced. The mass flow and power of compressor reduced by using the optimized <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> at large setting angles, and the efficiency increased significantly; the flow field distribution has been improved obviously, since the nonuniform distribution of flow and flow separation phenomenon greatly weakened or even completely disappeared.

40|$|Abstract: In a {{conventional}} one-dimensional scheme design of centrifugal fans and compres-sors, {{it is assumed}} that there is no flow prewhirl at the impeller inlet when the <b>inlet</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> is absent. However, many experiments have proved that the flow prewhirl does exist at the inlet of centrifugal impellers. This results in an error in the design of centrifugal fans and compressors. In this study a new method is presented to calculate the Euler work of centrifugal impellers con-sidering the presence of an inlet flow prewhirl in the case without the <b>inlet</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vane.</b> Stodola’s approachdealingwith the slip velocity at the impeller outlet is applied to the impeller inlet. A new formula for Euler work calculation is deduced to evaluate the effect of the inlet prewhirl. The new formula has been applied to 33 industrial centrifugal fans and the calculated results have been compared with the experimental data of these fans. The comparison shows that the new formula is more accurate in most cases than the original formula without consideration of the inlet flow prewhirl, and the accuracy has been improved by more than 10 per cent on average. The aim {{of this study is to}} improve the accuracy of the one-dimensional scheme design of centrifugal fans and to provide a reference for a similar research...|$|R

The study Involved retrofitting one Of the 54 VAV air-handling units (AHUs) in the building as a pilot installation. Measurement was conducted to obtain the characteristics of the system followed by a short term monitoring of the frequency of power supply to the AHU and the outdoor temperature. A simplified model was established from the measured results for predicting the fan energy use of the system. The feasible annual energy saving was estimated using the model, based on the monthly operating hours and the monthly mean outdoor temperatures determined from the records logged by the building management system. The pilot study concluded that the conversion would be viable, as the payback period would be less than four years. Fan speed control retrofit for all the VAVAHUs in the building commenced In March 1999 and was completed in June 2000. The electricity consumption Of the AHUs during the past year has been determined from metered energy use records and found to be reasonably close to the predictions of the model established in the pilot study.
