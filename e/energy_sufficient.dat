60|$|Bathsheba {{actually}} sat {{and cried}} over this letter most bitterly. She was aggrieved and wounded that {{the possession of}} hopeless love from Gabriel, which she had grown to regard as her inalienable right for life, should have been withdrawn just at his own pleasure in this way. She was bewildered too {{by the prospect of}} having to rely on her own resources again: it seemed to herself that she never could again acquire <b>energy</b> <b>sufficient</b> to go to market, barter, and sell. Since Troy's death Oak had attended all sales and fairs for her, transacting her business at the same time with his own. What should she do now? Her life was becoming a desolation.|$|E
60|$|A recent {{historical}} {{writer has}} described the world of that time as one that 'believed in established words and was invincibly blind to the obvious in things.' Certainly it seems now that nothing {{could have been more}} obvious {{to the people of the}} earlier twentieth century than the rapidity with which war was becoming impossible. And as certainly they did not see it. They did not see it until the atomic bombs burst in their fumbling hands. Yet the broad facts must have glared upon any intelligent mind. All through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries the amount of energy that men were able to command was continually increasing. Applied to warfare that meant that the power to inflict a blow, the power to destroy, was continually increasing. There was no increase whatever in the ability to escape. Every sort of passive defence, armour, fortifications, and so forth, was being outmastered by this tremendous increase on the destructive side. Destruction was becoming so facile that any little body of malcontents could use it; it was revolutionising the problems of police and internal rule. Before the last war began it was a matter of common knowledge that a man could carry about in a handbag an amount of latent <b>energy</b> <b>sufficient</b> to wreck half a city. These facts were before the minds of everybody; the children in the streets knew them. And yet the world still, as the Americans used to phrase it, 'fooled around' with the paraphernalia and pretensions of war.|$|E
60|$|Leopold, Grand Duke of Austria, was {{the first}} {{possessor}} of that noble country to whom the princely rank belonged. He had been raised to the ducal sway in the German Empire {{on account of his}} near relationship to the Emperor, Henry the Stern, and held under his government the finest provinces which are watered by the Danube. His character has been stained in history on account of one action of violence and perfidy, which arose out of these very transactions in the Holy Land; and yet the shame of having made Richard a prisoner when he returned through his dominions; unattended and in disguise, was not one which flowed from Leopold's natural disposition. He was rather a weak and a vain than an ambitious or tyrannical prince. His mental powers resembled the qualities of his person. He was tall, strong, and handsome, with a complexion in which red and white were strongly contrasted, and had long flowing locks of fair hair. But there was an awkwardness in his gait which seemed as if his size was not animated by <b>energy</b> <b>sufficient</b> to put in motion such a mass; and in the same manner, wearing the richest dresses, it always seemed as if they became him not. As a prince, he appeared too little familiar with his own dignity; and being often at a loss how to assert his authority when the occasion demanded it, he frequently thought himself obliged to recover, by acts and expressions of ill-timed violence, the ground which might have been easily and gracefully maintained by a little more presence of mind {{in the beginning of the}} controversy.|$|E

Proton scattering in a silicon carbide film has been numerically simulated. Distribution histograms {{of the energy}} imparted to recoil atoms are obtained. Two energy ranges are considered when analyzing the histograms. In the first range of “low” energies, individual Frenkel pairs with closely spaced components are created.

50|$|Historically, {{the most}} favored {{model has been}} the {{hydrogen}} bond switching model. It proposes that an electron-hole pair formed by the incident light may recombine near a weak Si-Si bond, releasing <b>energy</b> <b>sufficient</b> to break the bond.

However, new experimental evidence is casting doubt on this model. More recently, the H collision model proposed that two spatially separated recombination events cause emission of mobile hydrogen from Si-H bonds to form two dangling bonds, with a metastable paired H state binding the hydrogen atoms at a distant site.|$|E
