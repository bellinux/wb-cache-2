50|$|There {{are several}} {{circumstances}} where the grant <b>of</b> an <b>easement</b> may be implied, usually occurring on the conveyance of land. Where land is transferred, subject to contrary intention, existing easements are automatically conveyed under Section 62 of the Law of Property Act 1925. Additionally - and controversially {{in some cases}} - 'precarious' rights, such as licenses or personal rights may be transformed into legal easements, as demonstrated in International Tea Stores Co v Hobbs. In this case a right of way granted as a license by a land owner was transformed into an easement, following the conveyance of land into a legal estate. A limitation of Section 62 {{is that it does}} not act to imply reservation easements; for example, a land owner in common ownership of two plots of land could not claim that, after selling one plot, his remaining plot should have an <b>easement</b> for right <b>of</b> <b>light</b> implied. Other circumstances where easements may be implied are where they are necessary for the enjoyment of land.|$|R

40|$|In my {{doctoral}} thesis I {{have focused on}} legal regulation <b>of</b> <b>easements</b> and rights <b>of</b> neighbours as interrelated legal institutes. The introductory passages illustrate both fundamental concepts of this work, namely <b>easements</b> and rights <b>of</b> neighbours {{with regard to the}} current legal regulations, as well as their mutual relation. A short presentation of the historic legislation of both institutes in our territory since the early 19 th century until today might help better understanding of the actual legal regulation of these institutes in Civil Code. By determination <b>of</b> <b>easements</b> and rights <b>of</b> neighbours and by analysis of their establishment in current Czech law I attempted to incorporate in my work the actual cases of the most frequently established easements, as well as very common violations of neighbourhood rights.

50|$|Easements in English law are rights within English {{land law}} that one {{individual}} has over another's land. Rights recognised as easements most frequently include rights <b>of</b> way or <b>light,</b> and extend {{as far as}} the right to use a neighbour's lavatory, or to park a car on their land. The necessity <b>of</b> <b>easements</b> can be recognised by the Law Commission's recent findings that there are easements over at least 65% of registered freehold titles. In some circumstances for example, it may be impossible for one land owner to access a public highway without an <b>easement</b> <b>of</b> a right of way. The creation <b>of</b> <b>easements</b> is usually done expressly by deed, but easements may be implied where they are necessary, or would be reasonably expected to be held by a land owner, an approach which is not altogether uncontroversial, and {{has been the subject of}} recent reform proposals.|$|R
