The title {{made me think of}} an entire generation of Lolitas: someone—our parents? God?—needed us to be there, but the need felt neurotic and uncompassionate. In “We Love You Carol and Alison” (my favorite Game Theory song) I'm trying to express that teen alienation thing that the kids go for, but I’m also fishing around for a basis of proper adulthood.|$|E
500|$|According to Hughes, {{the scene}} at the Art Institute of Chicago was [...] "a self-indulgent scene of mine—which was a place of refuge for me, I went there quite a bit, I loved it. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>all</b> the paintings, the {{building}}. This was a chance for me to go back into this building and show the paintings that were my favorite." [...] The museum had not been shot in, until the producers of the film approached them. [...] "I remember Hughes saying, 'There {{are going to be more}} works of art in this movie than there have ever been before,'" [...] recalled Jennifer Grey.|$|E
500|$|For {{her fourth}} album, The House (2010), Melua worked with {{producer}} William Orbit. She {{said about the}} experience: [...] "The whole thing has been really exciting. It was the same feeling I had the first time I went skydiving. I was really quite nervous, but <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>all</b> I {{had to do was}} let myself go and it was going to feel amazing. I wasn't {{trying to get away from}} anything. It was more about going towards something. I wanted the music to be inspired by the future, something unknown that's never been heard before, but at the same time hold on to the values of the music of the past, to try and tap into something that's so ancient and old that it's kind of forgotten. I thought that, if we went far enough in both directions, we could end up in the same place".|$|E

2500|$|What {{he saw was}} a city under siege: [...] "'Lurid flames roared and belched {{and licked}} their forked tongues into the air. Smoke ascended the sky in thick, black volumes and amid it all, the planes—now {{a dozen or more}} in number—still hummed and darted here and there with the agility of natural birds of the air.'" [...] Making his way outside, Franklin found the source of the strange sound that had {{peppered}} his building. [...] "'The side-walks were literally covered with burning turpentine balls. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>all</b> too well where they came from, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>all</b> too well why every burning building first caught fire from the top.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|The book {{consumed}} Naipaul. [...] In 1983, he wrote:The book {{took three}} years to write. [...] It felt like a career; {{and there was a}} short period, {{towards the end of the}} writing, when I do believe <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>all</b> or much of the book by heart. [...] The labour ended; the book began to recede. [...] And I found that I was unwilling to re-enter the world I had created, unwilling to expose myself again to the emotions that lay below the comedy. [...] I became nervous of the book. [...] I haven't read it since I passed the proofs in May 1961.|$|E
2500|$|One night I went to Q-Tip's {{solo album}} release party {{and at some}} point in the night, I ran into the guy everyone's been telling me is behind the bootleg. So I {{approached}} him. When I told him what I suspected, to my surprise, he got real loud with me right there in the middle of the club. It was strange. We separated and I went over to the bar. I was sitting there like, [...] "No the fuck this nigga did not....." [...] I was talking to people, but I was really talking to myself out loud, just in a state of shock. Before I even realized what I was doing, I headed back over to him, but this time I was blacking out with anger. The next thing <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> <b>all</b> hell had broken loose in the club. That night the guy went straight to the police and I was indicted...|$|E

2500|$|During the 1924 {{election}} campaign, Reeves {{was asked}} to {{speak on behalf of}} both the Liberal and Labour Party candidates. [...] She choose to support Labour: [...] "The Liberal audiences were nice narrow decent people. They sat upright in rows and clapped their cotton gloves... But when I got to the Labour meetings in the slums, among the costers and the railway men and the women in tenth hand velvet hats – when I saw their pinched grey-and-yellow faces in those steamy halls, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>all</b> of a sudden that they were my people". [...] She soon {{became a member of the}} party and supported her husband as the Labour Party candidate for Holland-with-Boston in Lincolnshire. [...] The seat had gone to the Liberals in a by election earlier that year and Rivers failed to win it back. Amber attempted to get her theories on currency, later brought together in her book The Nationalisation of Banking, adopted by the Labour Party, and she and Rivers became responsible for a party publication called Womens Leader. Amber remained active in the Fabian Society, and by this time many Fabians agreed that there was a need to work through the parliamentary Labour Party. She stood twice as a candidate for Hendon, in 1931 and 1935 ...|$|E
2500|$|Blanchett {{returned}} to the theatre in 2009 with the Sydney Theatre Company production of Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire, directed by Liv Ullmann. She starred as Blanche DuBois alongside Joel Edgerton as Stanley Kowalski. Ullmann and Blanchett had been meaning to collaborate on a project since Ullman's intended film adaption of A Doll's House fell by the wayside. Blanchett proposed embarking on Streetcar to Ullmann, who jumped at the opportunity after initial discussion. The production traveled from Sydney to the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York, and the Kennedy Center in Washington D.C. It was critically and commercially successful and Blanchett received critical acclaim for her performance as Blanche DuBois. The New York Times critic Ben Brantley said, [...] "DuBois has been pulled gently and firmly down to earth by Ms. Blanchett and Ms. Ullmann ... What Ms. Blanchett brings to the character is life itself, a primal survival instinct ... All the baggage that any [...] "Streetcar" [...] usually travels with has been jettisoned. Ms. Ullmann and Ms. Blanchett have performed the play {{as if it had}} never been staged before, with the result that, as a friend of mine put it, [...] "you feel like you’re hearing words you thought you knew pronounced correctly for the first time."" [...] The Washington Posts Peter Marks proclaimed, [...] "What Blanchett achieves in the Sydney Theatre Company's revelatory revival of [...] "A Streetcar Named Desire" [...] amounts to a truly great portrayal—certainly the most heartbreaking Blanche I've ever experienced." [...] John Lahr of The New Yorker said of her portrayal, [...] "Blanchett, with her alert mind, her informed heart, and her lithe, patrician silhouette, gets it right from the first beat ... Blanchett doesn’t make the usual mistake of foreshadowing Blanche’s end at the play’s beginning; she allows Blanche a slow, fascinating decline ... I don’t expect to see a better performance of this role in my lifetime." [...] Jane Fonda, who attended a New York show, deemed it [...] "perhaps the greatest stage performance I have ever seen", and Meryl Streep declared, [...] "That performance was as naked, as raw and extraordinary and astonishing and surprising and scary as anything I've ever seen ... She took the layers of a person and just peeled them away. I thought I'd seen that play, I thought <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>all</b> the lines by heart, because I've seen it so many times, but I'd never seen the play until I saw that performance." [...] Blanchett won the Sydney Theatre Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role. The production and Blanchett received Helen Hayes Awards, for Outstanding Non-Resident Production and Outstanding Lead Actress in a Non-Resident Production award, respectively.|$|E
