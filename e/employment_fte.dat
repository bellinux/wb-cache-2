40|$|An {{important}} component of the debate surrounding climate legislation in the United States is its potential impact on labor markets. Theoretically the connection is ambiguous and depends on the sign of cross-elasticity of labor demand with respect to energy prices, which is a priori unknown. This paper provides some new evidence on this question by estimating the relationship between real electricity prices and indicators of labor market activity using data for 1976 - 2007. A key contribution of this analysis is that it relies on within-state variation in electricity prices to identify the models and considers all sectors of the U. S. economy rather than focusing only on the manufacturing sector. The main finding is that employment rates are weakly related to electricity prices with implied cross elasticity of full-time equivalent (<b>FTE)</b> <b>employment</b> with respect to electricity prices ranging from - 0. 16 % to - 0. 10 %. I conclude by interpreting these empirical estimates in the context of increases in electricity prices consistent with H. R. 2454, the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009. The preferred estimates in this paper suggest that in the short-run, an increase in electricity price of 4 % would lead to a reduction in aggregate <b>FTE</b> <b>employment</b> of about 460, 000 or 0. 6 %. ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{assesses the}} {{economic}} importance of air transport and airport activities in Belgium {{in terms of}} employment, value added and investment over the period 2007 - 2009. The sector considered embraces not only the activities directly connected with air transport, but also all the activities which take place on site at the six Belgian airports (Antwerp, Brussels, Charleroi, Kortrijk, Liège, Ostend). The direct and indirect effects of the sector are estimated respectively {{on the basis of}} microeconomic data (mainly obtained from the Central Balance Sheet Office) and macroeconomic data (from the National Accounts Institute). The study also includes an analysis of the social balance sheet and certain ratios on the basis of Central Balance Sheet Office data. In 2009, the air transport sector thus defined generated over € 6. 1 billion in direct and indirect value added (or 1. 8 % of Belgium’s GDP), and provided direct or indirect employment for 80, 300 people in full-time equivalents (or 2 % of domestic <b>employment</b> in <b>FTE).</b> Brussels Airport was the one most affected by the decline in global traffic in 2009, {{as a result of the}} economic crisis: in that year it ceased to be Belgium’s principal cargo airport, ceding that position to Liège Airport. However, the national airport still ranks first in the passenger market, accounting for almost three-quarters of traffic in 2010, despite the exponential growth of traffic at Charleroi Airport. Together, these two airports represented almost 97 % of passenger traffic passing through Belgium in 2010.

40|$|Allocation {{decisions}} in Saskatchewan of water are needed {{because of the}} limited nature of the resource in the province. Timely allocation of water can impact crop production, and through that economic development in the province, which may result through {{the value of the}} improved crop production as well as the economic linkages within the economy. Irrigation {{can be seen as a}} tool for economic growth as it decreases the reliance on natural factors which are critical for crop production in the province. The provincial government has committed, among its various agricultural initiatives, to develop tools to reach economic development goals. A study of the economic importance of irrigation in Saskatchewan is important to understand its contribution provincially and regionally as a possible tool for this economic development. The economic impacts of irrigation extend beyond farm-level impacts and understanding how it contributes to the entire economy at a provincial and regional level is information needed by decision makers. The purpose of this study is to provide the contributions of the irrigation sector on the provincial and regional economy. The Saskatchewan Irrigation Impact Analyzer (SIIA) model was built as a part of this study. The SIIA was based on a regionalized rectangular input-output model of the irrigation sector. Base data for the model were obtained from Statistics Canada Transaction Tables for 2011. The model was regionalized into: The Lake Diefenbaker Development Area (LDDA) and the other regions of Saskatchewan. The original data for agriculture production were disaggregated into irrigated and dryland production, each further disaggregated to crop and livestock production sectors. The model was further augmented with an employment model. Two scenarios of irrigation development were tested in the study: First, irrigation development that occurred during 2011 - 2016; Second, new irrigation development through infill expansion. In addition, the marginal contribution of the irrigation activity on the lake Diefenbaker Development Area region was also undertaken, which required a survey of producers. The study found that the total economic impacts of irrigation development during 2011 - 2016, enabling an additional 8, 472 acres of irrigated production, amounted to $ 200. 83 million in output (sales) generating $ 86. 60 million in GDP contributions at market prices. This resulted in 1, 179 full-time equivalent (<b>FTE)</b> <b>employment</b> years and $ 62. 48 million in household income contributions. These estimates are based on a simulation of irrigation over a twenty-year period. With respect to potential irrigation expansion, the study found that if the 32, 250 -remaining infill-acres (that have been identified as offering irrigation potential) were to be developed and under production for a twenty-year period, the total economic impacts to the province of Saskatchewan would be $ 603. 70 million in output (sales) responsible for 2, 908 <b>FTE</b> <b>employment</b> years. This would amount to $ 181. 12 million in household income contributions and $ 240. 89 million in gross domestic product (GDP) contributions at market prices, at 2011 dollars. The study also found that regionally, irrigation provides an impetus for economic development. During the 2011 year, the marginal contribution of irrigation production, over and above the alternative of dryland production, was created through purchases of higher amounts of farm inputs, as well as spending of additional household income. These two avenues resulted in total economic impacts of $ 116. 53 million in output (sales) which generated $ 78. 47 million in GDP contributions at market prices. In the region, $ 58. 72 million in household income gains also were incurred as a result of the 1, 323 <b>FTE</b> <b>employment</b> years generated. The study found the economic impacts of irrigation, currently and potentially, to be extensive in each scenario and offering considerable regional impacts over and above the dryland production alternatives...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{retirement and}} related behavioral responses to policies that on average are actuarially neutral. Many conventional models predict that actuarially neutral policies {{will not affect}} retirement behavior. In contrast, our model allows those with high time preference rates {{to find that the}} promise of an actuarially fair increase in future rewards does not balance the loss from foregone current benefits. Using data from the Health and Retirement Study, we find that from age 62 through full retirement age, the earnings test reduces full-time work by married men by about four percentage points, or by about ten percent of married men at full-time work. Abolishing the requirements on many jobs that an individual work full-time or not at all, what we term a minimum hours constraint on employment, would induce {{more than twice as many}} people to enter partial retirement as would leave full-time work, so that total full-time equivalent (<b>FTE)</b> <b>employment</b> would increase, although by a modest amount. If all benefits from personal accounts could be taken as a lump sum, the fraction not retired at age 62 would fall by about 5 percentage points compared to a system where there is mandatory annuitization of benefits. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} firm multifactor productivity growth (mfp) and changing skill levels of labour in New Zealand, over the period 2001 - 12, using longitudinal data from Statistics New Zealand’s Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) and Integrated Data Infrastructure (IDI). We estimate that the average skill of workers declined by 1. 8 % over the period, reflecting strong employment growth for workers with lower than average skill levels. The net decline was the combined effect of a 3. 6 % decline in unobserved skill outweighing a 1. 8 % increase in observed skill, resulting in 1. 8 % slower estimated skill-adjusted labour growth (13. 3 %) than the 15. 0 % growth in full-time equivalent (<b>FTE)</b> <b>employment.</b> Mirroring the skill-dilution, skill-adjusted mfp growth averaged 0. 24 % per annum over the period compared to 0. 14 % pa for unadjusted growth. The patterns were stronger over the pre-GFC period to 2008, during which adjusted and unadjusted mfp grew 0. 57 % pa and 0. 42 % pa respectively. Our analysis {{of the effect of}} changing skill on mfp growth finds that the impact of skill adjustment was almost entirely due to changing skill composition within continuing firms...|$|R

50|$|Consider one of {{the most}} famous DID studies, the Card and Krueger article on minimum wage in New Jersey, {{published}} in 1994. Card and Krueger compared employment in the fast food sector in New Jersey and in Pennsylvania, in February 1992 and in November 1992, after New Jersey's minimum wage rose from $4.25 to $5.05 in April 1992. Observing a change in employment in New Jersey only, before and after the treatment, would fail to control for omitted variables such as weather and macroeconomic conditions of the region. By including Pennsylvania as a control in a difference-in-differences model, any bias caused by variables common to New Jersey and Pennsylvania is implicitly controlled for, even when these variables are unobserved. Assuming that New Jersey and Pennsylvania have parallel trends over time, Pennsylvania's change in employment can be interpreted as the change New Jersey would have experienced, had they not increased the minimum wage, and vice versa. The evidence suggested that the increased minimum wage did not induce an increase in unemployment in New Jersey, as standard economic theory would suggest. The table below shows Card & Krueger's estimates of the treatment effect on <b>employment,</b> measured as <b>FTEs</b> (or full-time equivalents). Keeping in mind that the finding is controversial, Card and Krueger estimate that the $0.80 minimum wage increase in New Jersey led to a 2.75 <b>FTE</b> increase in <b>employment.</b>|$|R
40|$|This project uses {{data from}} the Health and Retirement Study to examine, {{in the context of}} a {{structural}} retirement model, the effects on retirement of non-wage aspects of employment emanating from firm side factors. Factors examined include minimum hours constraints, layoffs, physical and mental requirements of the job, informal pressures to retire, accommodations made by the employer when a person has a health problem, and retirement windows. The most important effects found pertain to minimum hours constraints. Should minimum hours constraints be abolished, the percent of the population ages 62 to 69 who are completely retired will decline by 10 to 15 percentage points. The fraction in this age group who are working in partial retirement jobs will increase by roughly twenty percentage points of the population. Were minimum hours constraints abolished, more than twice as many people would enter partial retirement as would leave full time work. As a result, total <b>FTE</b> <b>employment</b> would increase were minimum hours constraints eliminated. Increasing the importance of partial retirement would affect the role of the earnings test and liquidity of the Social Security system, although the increase in partial retirement would be largely, but not entirely offset by the decline in full time work. This would limit the size of any effects on Social Security finances. Authors’ Acknowledgment This paper was supported by a grant from the U. S.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we aim to}} study and compare the {{countries}} of the former EU- 15 in terms of the difference in labour market conditions between mothers and non-mothers and we look at how public policies can be designed in order to minimise the employment penalties associated with the presence of young children and thus promote parenthood by working women. As women choose to take part in paid employment, fertility rates will depend on their possibilities to combine employment and motherhood. As a result, the motherhood-induced employment penalties discussed in this paper as well as the role of public policies should be given priority attention by politicians and policy-makers. Firstly, in this paper we start out from a multinomial logit model to analyse motherhood-induced employment gaps in the EU- 15. Then, various decomposition techniques (the method of recycled prediction and the Oaxaca (1973) and Blinder (1973) technique adapted to the non-linear case) are applied to the computed gross <b>FTE</b> <b>employment</b> gaps between mothers and non-mothers to isolate the net employment effect associated with the presence of children from that of differences in characteristics between mothers and non-mothers. Special attention is also given to the specific role of education to contain the negative labour market consequences that derive from the presence of young children. It seems that differences in characteristics such as age, education and non labour personal income do not influence a lot the difference in employment status. Secondly, we use an OLS regression to confront motherhood-induced employment penalties with selfconstructed country-specific indicators of child policies, used as explanatory variables, in order to test the impact and effectiveness of policies of different design and generosity on these employment gaps that separate mothers of young children from non-mothers and mothers with grown up children. We round off our analysis by presenting a new typology and country-specific overview of the adjustment mechanisms applied by career-pursuing mothers on the labour market {{as well as of the}} supportiveness of different child policies. In the conclusion, we carefully review the main results of this research, advance a number of policy recommendations and suggest interesting avenues for future research. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 06 Background Little {{is known}} about the {{occupational}} health and safety risks of animal aquaculture workers. In 2015, the nonfatal occupational injury and illness incidence rate for aquaculture workers in the United States exceeded the national rate for all industries combined (13. 6 and 3. 3 injuries and illnesses, respectively, per 100 full-time employees), a trend echoed in Washington State (13. 3 and 4. 5 injuries and illnesses, respectively, per 100 full-time employees). Washington supports 12 % of American aquaculture employment, the second highest aquaculture industry employer in the United States as of 2005. Objective The {{purpose of this study was}} to better characterize occupational injuries and illnesses facing aquaculture workers in Washington State from 2006 - 2014. Methods We extracted accepted workers’ compensation claims from January 1, 2006 to December 31, 2014 from the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries’ (L&I) State Fund (SF). Trends in employment, worker demographics (including age, gender, and body mass index (BMI)), claim rate, and injury characteristics were summarized for Washington State aquaculture risk classes. We analyzed accepted claims. Results During the nine-year study period, 1, 180 of 1, 285 (91. 8 %) claims were accepted, of which 344 (26. 8 %) were compensable and 836 (65. 1 %) were medical-aid only. Men filed 85. 3 % of claims, 62. 8 % of claimants were overweight or obese (BMI > 25), and 53. 3 % of claimants were between ages 25 and 44. Most commonly reported injury types included being struck by/against an object (35. 6 %) and work-related musculoskeletal disorders (26. 3 %). There was no statistically significant change in claim rates from 2006 to 2014 (p = 0. 77), however, there was a statistically significant change in full-time equivalent (<b>FTE)</b> <b>employment</b> (p = 0. 003) when analyzed by both risk classes combined. Conclusion Given the growth in aquaculture production nationally and internationally, our study suggests that the industry should devote greater attention to prevention of work-related injuries. Additionally, aquaculture workers in Washington may be experiencing higher occupational injury and illness rates than compared to other workers in the state, and our study highlights the need for local efforts. Enhanced occupational safety and health programs for this industry could help to reduce injuries and illnesses, as well as the cost of workers’ compensation claims. Employers should focus on interventions to protect workers from physical hazards in the workplace, especially those resulting in being struck by/against objects or WMSD injuries...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to contribute}} {{to a better understanding of}} the small firm sector’s role in bringing about employment growth at the community level. The study begins by focusing on the new prominence of the small firm and the reasons for this. Part of this new prominence relates to the apparent ability of the small firm sector to generate a disproportionately large number of jobs when compared to the large firm sector. This ability has in turn led to speculation that small firms could play an important role in regional development. However, the literature reporting on small firms and the literature reporting on changes in the economy send mixed signals with respect to the potential of the small firm sector as an instrument of regional development. As a result, it is relevant to ask whether small firms can lead recovery in communities recently depleted by above average employment losses. In seeking an answer to this question the research focuses on Great Britain. There are several reasons for this choice. First, since the 1980 s many researchers in Great Britain have studied the small firm sector; as a result, there is a substantial knowledge base including a sound understanding of the environmental factors that influence rates of new firm formation. Second, Great Britain has simultaneously experienced both growth and decline as its regional economies exhibit substantial variation; consequently, issues of regional development are important there. Third, during the 1980 s the new prominence of the small firm received a considerable boost from promotion of the enterprise culture by successive Thatcher governments. Fourth, Great Britain’s small firm sector exhibited exceptional growth over the 1980 s when the population of VAT registered firms increased substantially. Therefore the British experience should be an important indicator, of the potential of the small firm sector to lead recovery. Using the NOMIS data base and other sources, each community in Great Britain was classified as occupying an environment that was either most conducive, least conducive or indeterminate with respect to its influence on the rate of new firm formation. It was then shown that the majority of depleted communities in Great Britain occupied environments that were among the least conducive to new firm formation. Consequently, for the majority of Britain’s depleted communities, small firm led recovery would require a robust small firm sector that was capable of overcoming the limitations imposed by unfavorable environmental conditions. The research also showed that in recovering communities there was virtually no association between rates of firm formation and rates of net <b>FTE</b> <b>employment</b> change. This result strongly suggests that many recovering communities relied on other sources of employment change for their recoveries. An analysis of employment changes in recovering and non- recovering depleted communities revealed the very important role played by the manufacturing sector. In recovering communities the manufacturing sector acted as a "stabilizer" which made it possible for the contributions of new small firms to be observed. Together these findings suggest that in communities experiencing substantial losses m manufacturing employment, government policies which are intended to stimulate recovery by emphasizing entrepreneurship would be more effective if at least some resources were directed toward stabilizing employment in the manufacturing sector. In other words, even though new small firms created many new jobs, differences between depleted communities that recovered and depleted communities that did not recover are not well explained by variations in the number of jobs created by new small firms. Rather, the differences appear to be better accounted for by the abatement of manufacturing job losses in some communities (those that recovered) and the continuation of manufacturing job losses in others (those that did not recover...|$|R
