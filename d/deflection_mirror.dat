40|$|Over {{the past}} fifty year, lasers have found many, often {{groundbreaking}} applications {{in science and}} technology. The most important features of lasers are that photons are inherently free of contamination, extremely high energy densities can be focused in very small areas and the laser beam can be precisely positioned using <b>deflection</b> <b>mirrors.</b> By reducing pulse lengths from a few nanoseconds down to the picosecond or femtosecond range, material ablation is becoming increasingly "a thermal", i. e. structure damage by local heating is reduced to well below a few microns. In view of these outstanding characteristics of lasers, it is very surprising that sample preparation for microstructure diagnostics did not derive the advantages from laser micro-machining. microPREP, is a new laser-micromachining tool developed by 3 D-Micromac capable of making fast, clean, and efficient laser ablation available for the preparation of samples for transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The workflow follows a three-stage approach. First, a supporting basic structure is cut from the feedstock. Second, the supported structure is laser-thinned down to a few microns and third, the supported and laser-thinned structure is thinned using a focused ion beam or an ion broad beam. The examples {{presented in this paper}} support this approach and show it is ready to be applied in different areas of microstructure diagnostics and has very high potential for failure diagnostics...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. During {{the last}} years the use of {{tracking}} cameras for SLR observations became less important due to the high accuracy of the predicted orbits. Upcoming new targets like satellites in eccentric orbits and space debris objects, however, require tracking cameras again. In 2013 the interline CCD camera was replaced at the Zimmerwald Observatory with a so called scientific CMOS camera. This technology promises a better performance for this application than all kinds of CCD cameras. After the comparison of the different technologies the {{focus will be on}} the integration in the Zimmerwald SLR system. Zimlat The 1 ‐meter Zimmerwald Laser and Astronometry Telescope (ZIMLAT) was installed in 1997. It allows for state‐of‐the‐art satellite laser ranging (SLR) and also serves as astronomical telescope for the optical observation of astrometric positions and magnitudes of near‐Earth objects, such as space debris, using Charge Coupled Device (CCD) or Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) cameras. The telescope is monostatic w. r. t. SLR (transmit and receive paths are identical between the primary mirror and the transmit/receive mirror located {{at the lower end of}} the Coudé path). The dichroic mirror (DBS) located in the fork of the mount (Figure 1) allows for the use of tracking cameras simultaneously with SLR observations.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the question of}} an optical unit designing for transmitting power laser radiation through an optical fiber. The aim of this work is designing a simple construction unit with minimized reflection losses. The source of radiation in the optical unit described below is an ultraviolet laser with diode pumping. We present the general functioning scheme and designing features for the three main parts: laser beam deflecting system, laser beam dump and optical unit control system. The described laser beam deflection system is composed of a moving flat mirror and a spherical scattering mirror. Comparative analysis of the production technology for such mirrors was carried out, and, as a result, {{the decision was made}} to produce both mirrors of 99. 99 % pure molybdenum without coating. A moving mirror deflects laser emission from a source through a fiber or deflects it on a spherical mirror and into the laser beam dump, moreover, switching from one position to another occurs almost immediately. It is shown that a scattering mirror is necessary, otherwise, the absorbing surface of the beam dump is being worn out irregularly. The laser beam dump is an open conical cavity, in which the conical element with its spire turned to the emission source is placed. Special microgeometry of the internal surface of the beam dump is suggested for the better absorption effect. An optical unit control system consists of a laser beam deflection system, laser temperature sensor, deflection system solenoid temperature sensor, and <b>deflection</b> <b>mirror</b> position sensor. The signal processing algorithm for signals coming from the sensors to the controller is described. The optical unit will be used in special technological equipment...|$|E

Recent work set out a comprehensive analysis of the velocity sensed by a single laser Doppler vibrometer beam incident in an arbitrary direction on a target that is of substantial interest in engineering — a rotating shaft requiring three translational and three rotational co-ordinates to describe its vibratory motion fully. Six separate "vibration sets", each a combination of motion parameters, appeared in the full expression for vibration velocity sensitivity and the difficulties associated with resolving individual vibration components within a complex motion were highlighted. The velocity sensitivity model can incorporate time dependent beam orientation and this is described in this paper with reference to scanning laser Doppler vibrometry. Continuously scanning strategies, in which the laser beam orientation is a continuous function of time, have recently received considerable attention, including a tracking profile in which the probe laser beam remains fixed on a single point on a target such as a rotating disc. Typically, one beam <b>deflection</b> <b>mirror</b> is driven using a cosine function whilst the other is driven with a sine function, resulting in a slightly elliptical beam trajectory. This and other more significant issues such as the effects of misalignment are easily accommodated in the velocity sensitivity model and a thorough analysis of their influence on the measured vibration signal is reported in this paper...|$|E

40|$|The {{aging process}} is {{associated}} {{to a complex}} ensemble of structural and functional changes. Focusing on the aging brain, the most reported modification {{has to do with}} the progressive atrophy of prefrontal cortices. The decrease in cortical volume is accompanied by a gradual (and greater) decrease of white matter density in anterior portions of the brain and by a progressive reduction of the functionality of the dopaminergic system. Those findings lead to the development of the frontal lobe hypothesis, which states that age-related cognitive and behavioral changes are due to the gradual decline of frontal brain structures. At the same time, functional data highlighted how older people show peculiar compensatory activity involving prefrontal regions when they are engaged in cognitive tasks, thus keeping acceptable performance levels notwithstanding neural losses. Within this scenario, the development of markers able to mirror and track functional decline across physiological and pathological aging processes is one of the most relevant challenges. Traditional paper-and-pencil assessment procedures, indeed, may not be sufficiently sensitive to discriminate small cognitive difficulties occurring, for example, in prodromal phases of degenerative diseases. Oscillatory and event-related electrophysiological measures, instead, are thought to be valuable candidates, them being sensitive to changes in cognitive and functional states, easy to record, non-invasive, and cheaper than alternative instrumental markers based on biochemical, metabolic or neuroimaging methods. Even though most of recent research focused on early pathological signs of Alzheimer Disease and/or Mild Cognitive Impairment, age has been classically associated to decrease in alpha band power and to progressive slowing of EEG rhythms even in healthy elderly people, as well as to prolonged latency of the N 2 event-related component, lack of habituation of the P 3 a component, and reduced/later P 3 b <b>deflections,</b> <b>mirroring</b> information-processing and allocation of attention resources.

Present and literature evidence point out the potential of EEG-ERP measures to help sketching a finer and more complete picture of cognitive-functional profile even in healthy elderly, and data on age-related changes of oscillatory cortical activity may be deemed as potential targets for future intervention via transcranial alternating current stimulation or neurofeedback techniques...|$|R
