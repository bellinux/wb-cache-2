5|$|Confusion {{with the}} highly {{regarded}} miller or sweetbread mushroom (Clitopilus prunulus) {{is a common}} cause of poisoning in France; the latter fungus has a greyish-white downy cap and whitish decurrent gills which turn pink with maturity. Young fruit bodies of Entoloma sinuatum can also be confused with St George's mushroom (Calocybe gambosa), although the gills of the latter are crowded and cream in colour, and the clouded agaric (Clitocybe nebularis), which has whitish decurrent gills and an unusual odour. To complicate matters, it often grows near these edible species. Its overall size and shape resemble members of the genus Tricholoma, although the spore colour (white in Tricholoma, pinkish in Entoloma) and shape (angular in Entoloma) help distinguish it. The rare and edible all-white dovelike tricholoma (T.columbetta) has a satiny cap and stem and a faint, not mealy, odour. E.sinuatum may be confused with Clitocybe multiceps in the Pacific Northwest of North America, although the latter has white spores and generally grows in clumps. A casual observer may mistake it for an edible <b>field</b> <b>mushroom</b> (Agaricus campestris), but this species has a ring on the stipe, pink gills that become chocolate-brown in maturity, and a dark brown spore print. The poorly known North American species E. albidum resembles E.sinuatum but is likewise poisonous.|$|E
25|$|The {{cultivated}} mushroom {{as well as}} the common <b>field</b> <b>mushroom</b> initially form a minute fruiting body, referred to as the pin stage because of their small size.

However, in modern molecularly defined classifications, not all members of the order Agaricales produce mushroom fruit bodies, and many other gilled fungi, collectively called mushrooms, occur in other orders of the class Agaricomycetes. For example, chanterelles are in the Cantharellales, false chanterelles such as Gomphus are in the Gomphales, milk-cap mushrooms (Lactarius, Lactifluus) and russulas (Russula), as well as Lentinellus, are in the Russulales, while the tough, leathery genera Lentinus and Panus are among the Polyporales, but Neolentinus is in the Gloeophyllales, and the little pin-mushroom genus, Rickenella, along with similar genera, are in the Hymenochaetales.|$|E

40|$|Fungivorous {{arthropods}} including mites, collembolans {{and insects}} were reviewed focusing on commercial mushroom pests in each taxon. Insects collected from mushroom fruiting bodies play roles {{not only of}} fungivores but also of phoretic hosts of smaller invertebrates. Their function should be considered for sound control measures. To learn biology and ecology of fungivores in <b>field</b> <b>mushrooms</b> is crucial because it could provide potential pest information, particularly under the situation that commercial mushroom production is on growing in species numbers and cultivation methods in Japan. Additionally, to learn pest control in other countries is also important, and I included arthropod pests and natural enemies in overseas mushroom cultivations. After reviewing published information on fungivorous arthropods, I conclude that fungivorous flies {{are one of the}} most important pest groups because of their high fecundity, fast life cycle, polyphagy and difficulty in control...|$|R

They later pass through grey and brown to become dull chocolate. There is a large spreading ring, white above but sometimes with yellowish scales underneath. Viewed from below, on a closed-cap specimen, the twin-layered ring has a well-developed 'cogwheel' pattern around the stipe. This is the lower part of the double ring. The odor is described as like anise. It belongs to a group of Agaricus which tend to stain yellow on bruising.|$|E

40|$|The basidiolipids of six {{mushroom}} species, i. e. the basidiomycetes Amanita virosa (engl., death cup), Calvatia exipuliformis (engl., puffball), Cantharellus cibarius (engl., chanterelle), Leccinum scabrum (engl., red birch boletus), Lentinus edodes (jap., Shiitake), and Pleurotus ostreatus (engl., oystermushroom), were isolated, {{and their}} chemical structures investigated. All glycolipids are structurally related {{to those of}} the Agaricales (engl., <b>field</b> <b>mushroom).</b> They are glycoinositolphosphosphingolipids, their ceramide moiety consisting of t 18 : 0 -trihydroxysphinganine and an α-hydroxy long-chain fatty acid. In contrast to a previous study [Jennemann, R., Bauer, B. L., Bertalanffy, H., Geyer, R., Gschwind, R. M., Selmer, T. & Wiegandt, H. (1999) Eur. J. Biochem. 259, 331 – 338], the glycoside anomery of the hexose (mannose) connected to the inositol of all investigated basidiomycete glycolipids, including the basidiolipids of Agaricus bisporus, was determined unequivocally to be alpha. Therefore, the root structure of all basidiolipids consists of α-dManp- 2 Ins 1 -[PO 4]-Cer. In addition, for some mushroom species, the occurrence of an inositol substitution position variant, α-Manp- 4 Ins 1 -[PO 4]-Cer, is shown. The carbohydrate of chanterelle basidiolipids consists solely of mannose, i. e. Cc 1, Manα- 3 or - 6 Manα; Cc 2, Manα- 3 (Manα- 6) Manα-. All other species investigated show extension of the α-mannoside in the 6 -position by β-galactoside, which, in some instances, is α-fucosylated in 2 -position (Fucα- 2) Galβ- 6 Manα-. Further sugar chain elongation at the β-galactoside may be in 3 - and/or 6 -position by α-galactoside, e. g. Ce 4, Po 2, Galα- 3 ‐(Galα- 6) (Fucα- 2) Galβ- 6 Manα-, whereas A. virosa, Av- 3, has a more complex, highly α-fucosylated terminus, Galα- 3 (Fucα- 2) (Fucα- 6) Galα- 2 (Galα- 3) Galβ- 6 Manα-. L. edodes basidiolipids show further elongation by α-mannoside, e. g. Le 3, Manα- 2 Manα- 6 Galα- 3 (Fucα- 2) Galβ- 6 Manα-, C. exipuliformis glycolipid by α-glucoside, i. e. Ce 3, Glcα- 6 Galβ- 6 Manα-. Basidiolipid Ls 1 from L. scabrum, notably, has a 3 -α-mannosylated α-fucose, i. e. Galα- 6 (Manα- 3 Fucα- 2) Galα- 6 Galβ- 6 Manα-. In conclusion, basidiolipids, though identical in their ceramide constitution, display wide and systematic mushroom species dependent variabilities of their chemical structures...|$|E
