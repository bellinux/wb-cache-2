40|$|Abstract: Power flow {{equation}} {{is used to}} calculate <b>equilibrium</b> <b>mode</b> distribution in W-type glass optical fibers. It has been shown how the coupling length for achieving the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>mode</b> distribution in W-type glass optical fibers varies with the depth and width of the intermediate layer and coupling strength for different widths of launch beam distribu-tion. W-type optical fibers have shown effectiveness in reducing modal dispersion and ben-ding loss...|$|R
5000|$|The cut {{should be}} made to retain 1 meter or more of the fiber, in order to {{establish}} <b>equilibrium</b> <b>mode</b> distribution conditions for the second measurement. In a multimode fiber, the lack of an <b>equilibrium</b> <b>mode</b> distribution could introduce errors in the measurement due to output coupling effects. In a single-mode fiber, measuring a shorter cutback fiber could result in significant transmission of cladding modes (light carried in the cladding rather than the core of the optical fiber), distorting the measurement. The errors introduced will result in conservative results (i.e., higher transmission losses and lower bandwidths) than would be realized under equilibrium conditions.|$|R

A similar analysis is done for time-independent <b>equilibrium</b> <b>modes</b> of the five dimensional plane AdS black hole. A self-adjointness analysis of this problem reveals {{that in addition to}} the modes corresponding to the usual glueball states, there is a discrete infinity of other <b>equilibrium</b> <b>modes</b> with imaginary mass for the glueball. We suggest these modes may be related to a Savvidy-Nielsen-Olesen-like vacuum instability in QCD. Comment: 18 pages, 2 figures, version to appear in Nuclear Physics...|$|R

40|$|To {{develop a}} sensor for {{measurements}} of hydrogen (and its isotopes) concentration in liquid Pb- 16 Li, two permeating capsules made with niobium and pure iron have been tested. The experimental results {{demonstrated that the}} Nb-sensor is not suitable for the foreseen application. The Fe-sensor cannot be operated in <b>equilibrium</b> <b>mode</b> because of the very long time necessary to reach the hydrogen pressure equilibrium. However, the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>mode</b> cannot be definitively excluded.

In this context, different optimised solutions have been developed and good performance demonstrated by simulations.

5000|$|<b>Equilibrium</b> <b>mode</b> power {{distributions}} {{were reported}} in early multimode transmission systems at propagation distances as short as a few hundred metres. However, as fibre manufacturing improved, the minute waveguide dimensional and structural changes that produce mode-mixing have been greatly reduced. The length of fibre required to attain true equilibrium is now {{much greater than the}} length of practical multimode transmission systems, which makes the term effectively obsolete.|$|R
50|$|The term {{equilibrium}} length is sometimes {{used to describe}} a stationary mode distribution, which is the length of multi-mode optical fiber necessary to attain a static mode distribution from a specific excitation condition. Equilibrium length is, strictly, the longest such length, as would result from a widely variable range of input excitation. Other terms for {{equilibrium length}} are equilibrium coupling length and <b>equilibrium</b> <b>mode</b> distribution length.|$|R

The basis for virtual lab development is the computer-aided system of thermogasdynamic research and analysis “ASTRA”. The features of gas turbine engine transient <b>modes</b> <b>simulator</b> are described. The principal difference between the simulators of transient and stationary modes of gas turbine engines is that the energy balance of the compressor and turbine becomes not applicable. The computer-aided system of virtual gas turbine engine testing was created using the developed transient <b>modes</b> <b>simulator.</b> This system solves the tasks of operational (throttling, speed, climatic, altitude) characteristics calculation, analysis of transient dynamics and selection of optimal control laws. Besides, the system of virtual gas turbine engine testing is a clear demonstration of gas turbine engine working process and the regularities of engine elements collaboration. The interface of the system of virtual gas turbine engine testing is described in the article and some screenshots of the interface elements are provided. The developed system of virtual gas turbine engine testing provides means for reducing the laboriousness of gas turbine engines testing. Besides, the implementation of this system in the learning process allows the diversification of lab works and therefore improve the quality of training...|$|R
40|$|Self-starting {{performance}} {{is a key}} factor in the evaluation of a Darrieus straight-bladed vertical axis turbine. Most traditional studies have analyzed the turbine’s self-starting capability using the experimental and numerical data of the forced rotation. A 2 D numerical model based on the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software ANSYS-Fluent was developed to simulate the self-starting process of the rotor at constant incident water-flow velocities. The vertical-axis turbine (VAT) rotor is driven directly by the resultant torque generated by the water flow and system loads, including the friction and reverse loads of the generator. It is found that the incident flow velocity and the moment of inertia of the rotor have little effect on the averaged values of tip-speed ratios in the equilibrium stage under no-load conditions. In the system load calculations, four modes of the self-starting were found: stable <b>equilibrium</b> <b>mode,</b> unstable <b>equilibrium</b> <b>mode,</b> switch mode and halt mode. The dimensionless power coefficient in the simulations of passive rotation conditions is found to be, on average, 38 % higher than those achieved in the simulations of forced rotation conditions...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>equilibrium</b> <b>mode</b> power {{distribution}} of light travelling in an optical waveguide or fiber, is {{the distribution of}} light {{that is no longer}} changing with fibre length or with input modal excitation.

At propagation distances exceeding the equilibrium length, intramodal pulse distortion increases (bandwidth decreases) as the square root of length.|$|R

This phenomenon is indeed recognized by the German Federal Network Agency responsible for overseeing the national power grids, and new regulations are currently being identified to counter this phenomenon. We study the currently valid proposal, and compare it with a set of alternative approaches that take up and combine ideas from communication protocol design, such as additive-increase/multiplicativedecrease known from TCP, and exponential backoff used in CSMA variations. We classify these alternatives with respect to their availability and goodput.

In Fullerton, Karney, and Baylis (2012), we show that it may actu-ally reduce emissions in other sectors (“negative leakage”). But reducing emissions in both sec-tors may merely reflect welfare costs of carbon policy that reduce real income and, thus, reduce consumption of both outputs. These possibilities capture the concern that unilateral carbon policy might have a high cost per global unit of carbon abated (that is, low “cost effectiveness”).

Our findings suggest that monopoly unions with risk-averse/neutral members may effectively act as commitment devices driving firms to the symmetric Cournot mode of competition.

An. <b>equilibrium</b> <b>mode</b> 1 of the issue-invest decision is developed under these assumptions.

Although these results challenge the Sraffian position on indeterminacy, the classical principle that current economic activity {{is embedded in}} the past proves to be a powerful insight: it establishes the robustness of factor-price indeterminacy and casts doubt on the importance of overlapping-generations indeterminacy.
