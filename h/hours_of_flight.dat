5|$|The Douglas DC-7 serving Flight 663 {{made its}} first flight in 1958, and had {{subsequently}} accumulated a total of 18,500 <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>flight</b> time.

5|$|The {{flight was}} manned by {{a crew of}} nine, {{including}} six flight attendants and three flight crewmen. The flight crew was captained by 51-year-old Laureano Caviedes with 28-year-old first officer Mauricio Klotz and 45-year-old flight engineer Matias Moyano. At {{the time of the}} crash, Captain Caviedes had been employed with Avianca for over 27 years and had logged over 16,000 <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>flight</b> time, including over 1,500 in the 707.

5|$|On March 21, 1942, Davis {{enlisted in}} the United States Army in Lubbock, Texas, just after the US entry into World War II. On June 3, he was {{appointed}} an aviation cadet in the Army Air Corps. He was moved to Kelly Field in San Antonio, Texas for pre-flight training, which he completed in August. He was then moved to Jones Field in Bonham, Texas for primary flight training. During this training, {{he got his first}} 60 <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>flight</b> time aboard a Fairchild PT-19 trainer aircraft. Then, he flew for another 74 hours during Basic Flight Training in Waco, Texas and a final stint of training aboard the T-6 Texan at Aloe Field in Victoria, Texas. On February 16, 1943, Davis completed his training and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the US Army Reserve, and immediately ordered to active duty with the Army Air Forces.

5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{ended up}} being used primarily to develop arresting gear and barriers, but were used operationally {{for a short time}} by at least one Texas-based United States Naval Reserve squadron as they transitioned to jets. Between them, the 30 production aircraft had only a total of 945 <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>flight</b> time, only 31.5 hours each. Some aircraft flew only six hours which was enough for little more than their acceptance flight and the flight to their ultimate disposition.|$|E

50|$|This rating {{requires}} {{highly specialized}} training by a certificated flight instructor (CFI) {{with a special}} instrument instruction rating (CFII), and completion of an additional written exam, oral exam, and flight test.

50|$|JP-7 is a {{compound}} mixture composed primarily of hydrocarbons; including alkanes, cycloalkanes, alkylbenzenes, indanes/tetralins, and naphthalenes; with addition of fluorocarbons {{to increase its}} lubricant properties, an oxidizing agent to make it burn more efficiently, and a cesium-containing compound known as A-50, which is to aid in disguising the radar and infrared signatures of the exhaust plume. The SR-71 Blackbirds used approximately 36000 - 44000 lb <b>of</b> fuel per <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>flight.</b>|$|R
5|$|Training Check Airman Captain Dennis E. Fitch, 46, {{was hired}} by United Airlines in 1968.

5|$|In {{the days}} {{following}} the attack on Pearl Harbor, Roddenberry received a telegram with orders to attend Kelly Air Force Base, enlisting on December 18, 1941. Following the completion of boot camp, {{he was sent to}} Corsicana, Texas for pilot training by civilian instructors. He completed sixty <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>flight</b> time there, including thirty-two solo hours. In March 1942, he moved to Goodfellow Field (now Goodfellow Air Force Base) in San Angelo, Texas for basic flight training where he flew a Vultee BT-13 Valiant. Roddenberry graduated on August 5, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant.|$|E
5|$|The report {{suggests}} two hypotheses for the accident. In the first, {{there was}} a flaw in the power control of the plane's engines, which would have kept one of the thrust levers into acceleration, regardless of their actual position. In such circumstances, there was mechanical failure of the aircraft. However, the occurrence of this failure is one in 400 billion <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>flight</b> and therefore highly improbable. In the second hypothesis, the pilot has performed a procedure different from that provided in the manual, and put the thrust lever in an irregular position, a configuration of human error for the accident.|$|E
25|$|The flight had {{a crew of}} 9. The {{captain was}} highly experienced, with 16,365 hours in the air (including 4,303 <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> night <b>flights).</b>|$|R

5|$|Crowds {{of people}} {{gathered}} in New York {{to witness the}} historic arrival, {{with tens of thousands}} of people crowding Battery Park in Manhattan to have a good view of the Statue of Liberty, where the aircraft was scheduled to touch down. Rumors circulated that L'Oiseau Blanc had been sighted along its route, in Newfoundland, or over Long Island. In France, some newspapers even reported that Nungesser and Coli had arrived safely in New York, evoking a wave of French patriotism. L'Oiseau Blanc had been carrying a sizable load of fuel, , which would have given them approximately 42 <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>flight</b> time. After this time had passed, with no word as to the aircraft's fate, it was realized that the aircraft had been lost. In France, the public was scandalized by the newspapers such as La Presse which had printed false reports about the aircraft's arrival, and outrage was generated against the companies involved, with demonstrations in the streets.|$|E
5|$|The 10-month 767 {{flight test}} program {{utilized}} {{the first six}} aircraft built. The first four aircraft were equipped with JT9D engines, while the fifth and sixth were fitted with CF6 engines. The test fleet was largely used to evaluate avionics, flight systems, handling, and performance, while the sixth aircraft was used for route-proving flights. During testing, pilots described the 767 as generally easy to fly, with its maneuverability unencumbered by the bulkiness associated with larger wide-body jets. Following 1,600 <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>flight</b> tests, the JT9D-powered 767-200 received certification from the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) in July 1982. The first delivery occurred on August 19, 1982, to United Airlines. The CF6-powered 767-200 received certification in September 1982, followed by the first delivery to Delta Air Lines on October 25, 1982.|$|E

2500|$|The {{program was}} the subject of public {{controversy}} for its cost to American taxpayers. In 1996, the General Accounting Office (GAO) disclosed that the USAF's B-2 bombers [...] "will be, by far, the most costly bombers to operate on a per aircraft basis", costing over three times as much as the B-1B (US$9.6million annually) and over four times as much as the B-52H (US$6.8million annually). In September 1997, each <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> B-2 <b>flight</b> necessitated 119 <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> maintenance in turn. Comparable maintenance needs for the B-52 and the B-1B are 53 and 60 hours respectively for each <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>flight.</b> A key reason for this cost is the provision of air-conditioned hangars large enough for the bomber's [...] wingspan, which are needed to maintain the aircraft's stealthy properties, particularly its [...] "low-observable" [...] stealthy skins. Maintenance costs are about $3.4million a month for each aircraft.|$|R
