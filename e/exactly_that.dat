5|$|Randall {{began to}} gain {{prominence}} in the small Democratic caucus by opposing Reconstruction measures. His delaying tactics against fellow Pennsylvanian Thaddeus Stevens's military Reconstruction bill in February 1867 kept the bill from being considered for two weeks—long enough {{to prevent it from}} being voted on until the next session. He likewise spoke against what would become the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. Although he opposed the amendment, Randall did favor the idea behind part of it: section 4, which guarantees that Congress may not repudiate the federal debt, nor may it assume debts of the Confederacy, nor debt that the individual Confederate states incurred during the rebellion. Many Republicans claimed that if the Democrats were to regain power, they would do <b>exactly</b> <b>that,</b> repudiating federal debt and assuming that of the rebels. Despite disagreement on other facets of Reconstruction, Randall stood firmly with the Republicans (and most Northern Democrats) on the debt.|$|E
5|$|Third, the {{curvature}} index k determines {{the sign of}} the mean spatial curvature of spacetime averaged over sufficiently large length scales (greater than about a billion light years). If k=1, {{the curvature}} is positive and the Universe has a finite volume. Such universes are often visualized as a three-dimensional sphere embedded in a four-dimensional space. Conversely, if k is zero or negative, the Universe has infinite volume. It may seem counter-intuitive that an infinite and yet infinitely dense Universe could be created in a single instant at the Big Bang when R=0, but <b>exactly</b> <b>that</b> is predicted mathematically when k does not equal 1. By analogy, an infinite plane has zero curvature but infinite area, whereas an infinite cylinder is finite in one direction and a torus is finite in both. A toroidal Universe could behave like a normal Universe with periodic boundary conditions.|$|E
5|$|With {{the failure}} of the Spanish match, Charles and Buckingham turned their {{attention}} to France. On 1 May 1625 Charles was married by proxy to the fifteen-year-old French princess Henrietta Maria in front of the doors of the Notre Dame de Paris. Charles had seen Henrietta Maria in Paris while en route to Spain. The couple married in person on 13 June 1625 in Canterbury. Charles delayed the opening of his first Parliament until after the second ceremony, to forestall any opposition. Many members of the Commons were opposed to the king's marriage to a Roman Catholic, fearing that Charles would lift restrictions on Catholic recusants and undermine the official establishment of the reformed Church of England. Although he told Parliament that he would not relax religious restrictions, he promised to do <b>exactly</b> <b>that</b> in a secret marriage treaty with his brother-in-law Louis XIII of France. Moreover, the treaty loaned to the French seven English naval ships that would be used to suppress the Protestant Huguenots at La Rochelle in September 1625. Charles was crowned on 2 February 1626 at Westminster Abbey, but without his wife at his side because she refused to participate in a Protestant religious ceremony.|$|E

25|$|The Tordesillas Meridian divided South America {{into two}} parts, leaving {{a large chunk}} of land to be {{exploited}} by the Spaniards. The Treaty of Tordesillas was arguably the most decisive event in all Brazilian history, since it alone determined that a portion of South America would be settled by Portugal instead of Spain.

25|$|The Piltdown Man hoax succeeded so well because, at {{the time}} of its discovery, the {{scientific}} establishment believed that the large modern brain preceded the modern omnivorous diet, and the forgery provided <b>exactly</b> <b>that</b> evidence. It has also been thought that nationalism and cultural prejudice played a role in the less-than-critical acceptance of the fossil as genuine by some British scientists. It satisfied European expectations that the earliest humans would be found in Eurasia, and the British, it has been claimed, also wanted a first Briton to set against fossil hominids found elsewhere in Europe.|$|E
25|$|The class L is {{the class}} of sets whose {{construction}} is influenced by A, where A may be a (presumably non-constructible) set or a proper class. The definition of this class uses DefA (X), {{which is the same}} as Def (X) except instead of evaluating the truth of formulas Φ in the model (X,∈), one uses the model (X,∈,A) where A is a unary predicate. The intended interpretation of A(y) is y∈A. Then the definition of L is <b>exactly</b> <b>that</b> of L only with Def replaced by DefA.|$|E
25|$|Some critiqued Paul VI's decision; {{the newly}} created Synod of Bishops had an {{advisory}} role only and could not make decisions on their own, although the Council decided <b>exactly</b> <b>that.</b> During the pontificate of Paul VI, five such synods took place, and he is on record of implementing all their decisions. Related questions were raised about the new National Bishop Conferences, which became mandatory after Vatican II. Others questioned his Ostpolitik and contacts with Communism and the deals he engaged in for the faithful.|$|E

25|$|The {{most serious}} {{military}} threat to Santa Barbara during the Spanish period was {{not by a}} colonial power, but by Hippolyte de Bouchard, a French privateer working for the Argentine government, which was, along with Mexico, attempting to throw off Spanish rule. Bouchard, who was given the task of destroying as many Spanish assets as possible, {{and in particular the}} ports in the Americas, possessed two well-armed frigates, which had sufficient armament and crews to destroy any lightly defended towns they encountered. He had done <b>exactly</b> <b>that</b> to Monterey, the capital of Alta California, shortly before coming to Santa Barbara.|$|E
25|$|The year 383 denotes a {{significant}} point in Welsh history, remembered {{in literature and}} {{considered to be the}} foundation point of several medieval royal dynasties. In that year the Roman general Magnus Maximus would strip all of western and northern Britain of troops and senior administrators and launch a successful bid for imperial power, continuing to rule Britain from Gaul as emperor. Having left with the troops and Roman administrators, and planning to continue as the ruler of Britain in the future, his practical course was to transfer local authority to local rulers. Welsh legend provides a mythic story that says he did <b>exactly</b> <b>that.</b>|$|E
25|$|The John Conolly Wing {{was built}} on the Asylum playing fields, {{removing}} the opportunities for patients and staff to play football or cricket. A two story building, it was designed as two East and West halves under another blue roof, a colour matching <b>exactly</b> <b>that</b> of the Maternity unit. A hanging corridor was built from the first floor into the general hospital entrance, but with the general hospital gaining trust status and general hospital patients (and some staff) not keen on having psychiatric patients in the shop areas of the general hospital, this corridor was closed off and is now only used for fire evacuation reasons which admittedly was always its primary design purpose.|$|E

25|$|In the 1881 Parliamentary session, a Bill was lodged by the G {{to drain}} the Canal and convert it to a railway: <b>exactly</b> <b>that</b> which the former Chairman had {{described}} as perfect nonsense. There was no serious opposition now, and the Bill was passed, and the G found itself having to find money for the line {{as well as the}} quadrupling of the joint line and the extension of Gilmour Street station at Paisley simultaneously. The canal had been built as a contour line, following exactly a particular altitude; this avoided locks at the expense of a circuitous route. Many of the loops taken by the course of the canal were eased in the railway construction by the use of earthworks.|$|E
25|$|In time, however, Pascal's {{desire to}} make his mark on cinema {{returned}} and Pascal took a ship back from India to America penniless but undaunted. He landed in San Francisco where he spent some time deciding what to do next. Then it struck him to approach George Bernard Shaw, whom Pascal had met auspiciously many years earlier. During that earlier meeting Shaw, who had been impressed with the young Pascal's passion for art and cinema, {{had told him to}} pay him a visit when he was entirely penniless. Pascal was now <b>exactly</b> <b>that.</b> He then sought out Shaw, first by going to New York City hidden in the toilet of a train, then convincing a sea captain to give him a lift to England.|$|E
25|$|Historian Harvey Klehr {{indicates}} that {{membership of the}} WAA did exhibit growth after unification, however, in large measure {{as a result of}} growth of the WPA jobs program and the ability of now employed WPA workers to pay the relatively nominal dues of the WAA. Despite misgivings about painting itself into a corner as a de facto trade union for WPA employees, it seems that in practice the WAA became <b>exactly</b> <b>that,</b> with WPA employees constituting some 75 percent of the organization's dues paying membership by 1939. The survival of the WAA was thus intimately linked with the fate of the WPA program, with periodic layoffs of WPA workers due to budgetary constraints playing havoc with the WAA's membership rolls.|$|E
