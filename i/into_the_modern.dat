After World War II, writers such as Mongo Beti and Ferdinand Oyono analysed and criticised colonialism and rejected assimilation.|$|E

5|$|No {{effort to}} depict vampires in popular fiction was as {{influential}} or as definitive as Bram Stoker's Dracula (1897). Its portrayal of vampirism {{as a disease}} of contagious demonic possession, with its undertones of sex, blood and death, struck a chord in Victorian Europe where tuberculosis and syphilis were common. The vampiric traits described in Stoker's work merged with and dominated folkloric tradition, eventually evolving <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>modern</b> fictional vampire.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there is}} {{insufficient}} data to accurately estimate population sizes {{at the time}} of contact with the Spanish, early Spanish reports suggest that sizeable Maya populations existed in Petén, particularly around the central lakes and along the rivers. Before their defeat in 1697 the Itza controlled or influenced much of Petén and parts of Belize. The Itza were warlike, and their martial prowess impressed both neighbouring Maya kingdoms and their Spanish enemies. Their capital was Nojpetén, an island city upon Lake Petén Itzá; it has developed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>modern</b> town of Flores, which is the capital of the Petén department of Guatemala. The Itza spoke a variety of Yucatecan Maya.|$|E

5|$|Herbals {{contributed to}} botany by setting in train {{the science of}} plant description, classification, and botanical illustration. Up to the 17th century botany and {{medicine}} were {{one and the same}} but those books emphasising medicinal aspects eventually omitted the plant lore to become modern pharmacopoeias; those that omitted the medicine became more botanical and evolved <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>modern</b> compilations of plant descriptions we call Floras. These were often backed by specimens deposited in a herbarium which was a collection of dried plants that verified the plant descriptions given in the Floras. The transition from herbal to Flora marked the final separation of botany from medicine.|$|E

Before the conquest the country formed {{a part of the}} Mesoamerican cultural region, and was inhabited by a number of indigenous peoples, including the Pipil, the Lenca, the Xinca, and Maya. Native weaponry consisted of spears, bows and arrows, and wooden swords with inset stone blades; they wore padded cotton armour.|$|E

5|$|The ancestral {{origins of}} the Maine Coon are unknown — there are only {{speculation}} and folk tales. One such folk tale involves Marie Antoinette, the Queen of France, who was executed in 1793.

She loaded Clough's ship with her most prized possessions, including six of her favorite Turkish Angora cats. Although she did not make it to the United States, her pets safely reached the shores of Wiscasset, Maine, where they bred with other short-haired breeds and developed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>modern</b> breed of the Maine Coon.|$|E
5|$|The bobcat is {{believed}} to have evolved from the Eurasian lynx, which crossed into North America by way of the Bering Land Bridge during the Pleistocene, with progenitors arriving as early as 2.6 million years ago. The first wave moved into the southern portion of North America, which was soon cut off from the north by glaciers. This population evolved into modern bobcats around 20,000 years ago. A second population arrived from Asia and settled in the north, developing <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>modern</b> Canada lynx. Hybridization between the bobcat and the Canada lynx may sometimes occur.|$|E
