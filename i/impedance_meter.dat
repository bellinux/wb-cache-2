40|$|The US NRC is {{planning}} to use advanced best estimate thermal hydraulics computer codes to analyze the safety systems of next-generation nuclear power plants in order to streamline the licensing process and improve the viability of nuclear power for electric utilities. In advanced BWR designs the chimney section above the core is generally modeled as a large diameter pipe. Advanced codes utilize the two-fluid model, which treats both phases with separate equations for conservation of mass, momentum and energy. The two-fluid model {{has been shown to}} work extremely well; however it has one weak link in the constitutive models for the interfacial interactions. For this approach to work, the computer codes require accurate models {{for a wide variety of}} two-phase flow phenomena. One of the interfacial transfer terms is the interfacial drag force, which is essential for accurately calculating the void fraction in dispersed bubbly flow. Current advanced codes utilize a drift-flux based approach to this modeling. As each of these flow regimes differ significantly in their governing physical mechanisms, accurate flow regime data is also essential to any modeling effort. It has been found that insufficient data exists to accurately assess the existing models for interfacial drag in large diameter pipes at high void fractions. ^ In light of this, data has been collected in pipes of diameter 0. 152 m and 0. 203 m with liquid velocity conditions of 0. 05 m/s to 1. 0 m/s, gas velocities of 0. 01 m/s to 5. 0 m/s and void fractions from 0. 05 to 0. 8 in order to augment the existing void fraction database, develop accurate models for the flow regime transitions, and evaluate the current models for the prediction of interfacial drag in large pipes. A new approach to modeling the drag force in the two-fluid model, a scheme for drift-flux modeling in pipes and a new transition model for the cap bubbly to churn-turbulent flow regime transition have been proposed. The use of <b>impedance</b> <b>meters</b> in pipes with diameters up to 0. 203 m was validated, Pressure was found to have negligible effect on the accuracy of the recommended drift-flux models, Hydraulic diameter was found to have no effect on the two-phase flow for non-dimensional diameters greater than 55 and axial development of the flow regime was found to have little effect on the void fraction prediction. Finally, a new method of flow regime identification has been proposed and the recommended drift-flux models for pipes have been validated. ^ In addition, though the proposed flow regime transition criterion has not been validated, what results are available from the flow regime identification seems to support the proposed transition. Additional work is required to find an accurate method of determining the flow regime in large pipes through the use of <b>impedance</b> <b>meters.</b> Also, additional work should be done collect local data so that interfacial area relations can be developed in large pipes and the proposed model for interfacial drag can be validated. ...|$|R

The CPDF (cumulative probability distribution function) of void fractions and bubble chord lengths obtained by means of <b>impedance</b> <b>meters</b> and conductivity probes are used to calculate both entropies. Entropy values for 242 flow conditions in upward two-phase flows in 25. 4 mm and 50. 8 mm pipes have been calculated. The measured conditions cover ranges from 0. 13 m/s to 5 m/s in the superficial liquid velocity jf and ranges from 0. 01 m/s to 25 m/s in the superficial gas velocity jg. The physical meaning of both entropies has been interpreted using the visual flow regime map information. The area-averaged void fraction and bubble chord length entropies capability as flow regime indicators have been checked with other statistical parameters and also with different input signals durations. The area-averaged void fraction and the bubble chord length entropies provide better or at least similar results than those obtained with other indicators that include more than one parameter. The entropy is capable to reduce the relevant information of the flow regimes in only one significant and useful parameter. In addition, the entropy computation time is shorter than the majority of the other indicators. The use of one parameter as input also represents faster predictions...|$|R

The magnetic-control-electric {{and corresponding}} dielectric behavior of ZnO/NiFe/ZnO multilayers with a single inserting NiFe layer compared with that of pure ZnO film also conclude the magnetoelectric effect in present multilayered structures.

40|$|The {{field of}} {{biological}} acoustics has witnessed a steady {{increase in the}} research into overtone singing, or “throat-singing,” in which a singer utilizes resonance throughout the vocal tract to sing melodies with the overtones created by a vocal drone. Recent research has explored both how a singer vocalizes {{in order to obtain}} rich harmonics from a vocal drone, as well as how further manipulations of the vocal apparatus function to filter and amplify selected harmonics. In the field of phonetics, vowel production is quantified by measuring the frequencies of vocal tract resonances, or formants, which a speaker manipulates to voice a particular vowel. Thus, an investigation of throat singing is closely linked to human speech production. Formants are usually detected in vowel spectra obtained using Fast Fourier Transform algorithms (FFTs). An alternative method that provides much higher frequency resolution is external excitation of the vocal tract and measurement of the pressure response signal at the mouth’s opening, which can be used to calculate the acoustic impedance spectrum.

Global and local flow regimes {{were obtained for}} the rod bundle geometry. Local two-phase flow parameters were measured at various axial locations {{in order to understand}} the transport of interfacial structures. A one-dimensional two-group interfacial area transport model was evaluated using the local parameter database. ^ Air-water two-phase flow experiments were performed in an 8 X 8 rod bundle test section to obtain flow regime maps at various axial locations. Area averaged void fraction was measured using parallel plate type <b>impedance</b> void <b>meters.</b> The cumulative probability distribution functions of the signals from the <b>impedance</b> void <b>meters</b> were used along with a self organizing neural network to identify flow regimes. Local flow regime maps revealed the cross-sectional distribution of flow regimes in the bundle. ^ Local parameters that characterize interfacial structure, that is, void fraction α, interfacial area concentration, ai, bubble Sauter mean diameter, DSm and bubble velocity, vg were measured using four sensor conductivity probe technique. The local data revealed the distribution of the interfacial structure in the radial direction, as well as its development in the axial direction. In addition to this, the effect of spacer grid on the flow structure at different gas and liquid velocities was revealed by local parameter measurements across the spacer grids. ^ A two-group interfacial area transport equation (IATE) specific to rod bundle geometry was derived. The derivation of two-group IATE required certain assumption on the bubble shapes in the subchannels and the bubbles spanning more than a subchannel. It was found that the geometrical relationship between the volume and the area of a cap bubble distorted by rods was similar to the one derived for a confined channel under a specific geometrical transformation. ^ The one dimensional form of the interfacial area transport equation was evaluated against the one dimensional area averaged data obtained in the rod bundle. The model was evaluated for the overall development of the flow structure. The effect of spacer grid was not considered in the model evaluation scheme, in view of the observation from flow regime identification, that the flow structure developed within a short distance downstream of the spacer grid. The evaluation results showed that one-group interfacial area transport model agreed well with the experimental data. However, the two-group model prediction deviate from the experimental data. The model predicted experimental data within 30 % for flow conditions with lower liquid flow rates. The model needs further developments for it to be applicable to a wide range of flow conditions. ...|$|R
