40|$|Solutions are {{presented}} for the stresses in a specially orthotropic infinite strip which {{is subjected to}} localized uniform normal loading on one edge while the other edge is either restrained against normal displacement only, or completely fixed. The solutions are used to investigate the diffusion of load into the strip {{and in particular the}} decay of normal stress across the width of the strip. For orthotropic strips representative of a broad range of balanced and symmetric angle-ply composite laminates, minimum strip widths are found that ensure at least 90 % decay of the normal stress across the strip. In addition, in a few cases where, on the fixed edge the peak shear stress exceeds the normal stress in magnitude, minimum strip widths that ensure 90 % decay of both stresses are found. To help in putting these results into perspective, and to illustrate the influence of material properties on load 9 orthotropic materials, closed-form solutions for the stresses in similarly loaded orthotropic half-planes are obtained. These solutions are used to generate illustrative stress contour plots for several representative laminates. Among the laminates, those composed of intermediate-angle plies, i. e., from about 30 degrees to 60 degrees, exhibit marked changes in normal stress contour shape with stress level. The stress contours are also used to find 90 % <b>decay</b> <b>distances</b> in the half-planes.

A total of 287 tropical and 160 temperate inbred lines were genotyped with 1943 {{single nucleotide polymorphism}} (SNP) markers of high quality and compared for genetic diversity and LD decay using the SNPs and their haplotypes developed from genic and intergenic regions. Intronic SNPs revealed a substantial higher variation than exonic SNPs. The big window size haplotypes (3 -SNP slide-window covering 2160 kb on average) revealed much higher genetic diversity than the 10 kb-window and gene-window haplotypes. The polymorphic information content values revealed by the haplotypes (0. 436 – 0. 566) were generally much higher than individual SNPs (0. 247 – 0. 259). Cluster analysis classified the 447 maize lines into two major groups, corresponding to temperate and tropical types.

Within this method {{we focused on}} the <b>distance</b> <b>decay</b> function and its parameter. So far only <b>distance</b> <b>decay</b> functions with constant parameters have been applied. Therefore, we developed a variable <b>distance</b> <b>decay</b> function to be used within the FCA method. We were able to replace the impedance coefficient β by readily available distribution parameter (i. e. median and standard deviation (SD)) within a logistic based <b>distance</b> <b>decay</b> function. Hence, the function is shaped individually for every single population location by the median and SD of all population-to-provider distances within a global catchment size. Theoretical application of the variable <b>distance</b> <b>decay</b> function showed conceptually sound results. Furthermore, the existence of effective variable catchment sizes defined by the asymptotic approach to zero of the <b>distance</b> <b>decay</b> function was revealed, satisfying the need for variable catchment sizes. The application of the iFCA method within an urban case study in Berlin (Germany) confirmed the theoretical fit of the suggested method. In summary, we introduced for the first time, a variable <b>distance</b> <b>decay</b> function within an integrated FCA method. This function accounts for individual travel behaviors determined by the distribution of providers.

40|$|Abstract Background Tobler's {{first law}} of geography, 'Everything {{is related to}} {{everything}} else, but near things are more related than distant things' also applies to biological systems as illustrated by a general and strong occurrence of geographic <b>distance</b> <b>decay</b> in ecological community similarity. Using American palms (Arecaceae) as an example, we assess {{the extent to which}} Tobler's first law applies to species richness and species composition, two fundamental aspects of ecological community structure. To shed light on the mechanisms driving <b>distance</b> <b>decays</b> in community structure, we also quantify the relative contribution of geographic distance per se and environmental changes as drivers of spatial turnover in species richness and composition. Results Across the Americas, similarity in species composition followed a negative exponential decay curve, while similarity in species richness exhibited a parabolic relationship with geographic distance. Within the four subregions geographic <b>distance</b> <b>decays</b> were observed in both species composition and richness, though the decays were less regular for species richness than for species composition. Similarity in species composition showed a faster, more consistent <b>decay</b> with <b>distance</b> than similarity in species richness, both across the Americas and within the subregions. At both spatial extents, geographic <b>distance</b> <b>decay</b> in species richness depended more on environmental distance than on geographic distance, while the opposite was true for species composition. The environmentally complex or geographically fragmented subregions exhibited stronger <b>distance</b> <b>decays</b> than the more homogenous subregions. Conclusion Similarity in species composition exhibited a strong geographic <b>distance</b> <b>decay,</b> in agreement with Tobler's first law of geography. In contrast, similarity in species richness did not exhibit a consistent <b>distance</b> <b>decay,</b> especially not at distances > 4000 kilometers. Therefore, the degree to which Tobler's first law of geography applies to community structure depends on which aspect hereof is considered – species composition or species richness. Environmentally complex or geographically fragmented regions exhibited the strongest <b>distance</b> <b>decays.</b> We conclude that Tobler's law may be most applicable when dispersal is a strong determinant of spatial turnover and less so when environmental control predominates. </p...|$|R

Soc., vol. 20, 1921, pp. 148 – 181) of Kelvin wave reflection in a semi-enclosed rectangular basin of uniform depth is extended {{to account for}} horizontally viscous effects. To this end, we add horizontally viscous terms to the hydrodynamic model (linearized depth-averaged shallow-water equations on a rotating plane, including bottom friction) and introduce a no-slip condition at the closed boundaries. In a straight channel of infinite length, we obtain three types of wave solutions (normal modes). The first two wave types are viscous Kelvin and Poincaré modes. Compared to their inviscid counterparts, they display longitudinal boundary layers and a slight decrease in the characteristic length scales (wavelength or along-channel <b>decay</b> <b>distance).</b> For each viscous Poincaré mode, we additionally find a new mode with a nearly similar lateral structure. This third type, entirely due to viscous effects, represents evanescent waves with an along-channel <b>decay</b> <b>distance</b> bounded by the boundary-layer thickness. The solution to the viscous Taylor problem is then written as a superposition of these normal modes: an incoming Kelvin wave and a truncated sum of reflected modes. To satisfy no slip at the lateral boundary, we apply a Galerkin method. The solution displays boundary layers, the lateral one at the basin’s closed end being created by the (new) modes of the third type. Amphidromic points, in the inviscid and frictionless case located on the centreline of the basin, are now found on a line making a small angle to the longitudinal direction. Using parameter values representative for the Southern Bight of the North Sea, we finally compare the modelled and observed tide propagation in this basin.

40|$|We probe in two {{different}} ways the competing attractive and repulsive forces that create lamellar arrays of the phospholipid lecithin when in equilibrium with pure water. The first probe involves the addition of low molecular weight solutes, glucose and sucrose, to a system where the phospholipid is immersed in a large excess of water. Small solutes can enter the aqueous region between bilayers. Their effect is first to increase and then to decrease the separation between bilayers as sugar concentration increases. We interpret this waxing and waning of the lattice spacing {{in terms of the}} successive weakening and strengthening of the attractive van der Waals forces originally responsible for creation of a stable lattice. The second probe is an "osmotic stress method," in which very high molecular weight neutral polymer is added to the pure water phase but is unable to enter the multilayers. The polymer competes for water with the lamellar lattice, and thereby compresses it. From the resulting spacing (determined by X-ray diffraction) and the directly measured osmotic pressure, we find a force vs. distance curve for compressing the lattice (or, equivalently, the free energy of transfer to bulk water of water between bilayers.
