5|$|Christy is {{the oldest}} of Carl and Helen Jenkins's two daughters. Both of her parents are mortal, and her powers were {{inherited}} from her maternal grandmother, making her a carrier of the genes determining magical ability. As a witch, Christy possesses the basic ability to cast spells, perform rituals, brew potions, scry for lost people or objects {{through the use of}} a crystal pendant, and communicate with the dead. She also possesses an advanced form of telepathy, enabling her to hear and project her thoughts, as well as channeling other magical creatures' powers. Carl and Helen Jenkins (David Starzyk and Barbara Niven) said Christy <b>heard</b> <b>voices</b> prior to her kidnapping, implying that this power was already active. As a firestarter, Christy had the power of pyrokinesis; this power could be augmented by Billie's projection powers to vanquish demons previously believed to be invincible. Christy was identified as the Key to the Ultimate Power due to her relationship with Billie. Demain of Television Without Pity compared Christy to Buffy the Vampire Slayer character Dawn Summers as they were both referenced as the Key.|$|E

In his early years, he agonized over whether these psychic abilities were spiritually delivered from the highest source.|$|E

500|$|On 10 September, {{the police}} arrested a notorious local called John Pizer, dubbed [...] "Leather Apron", {{who had a}} {{reputation}} for terrorising local prostitutes. His alibis for the two most recent murders were corroborated, and he was released without charge. At the inquest one of the witnesses, Mrs Elizabeth Long, testified that she had seen Chapman talking to a man at about 5:30am just beyond the back yard of 29 Hanbury Street, where Chapman was later found. Baxter inferred that the man Mrs Long had seen was the murderer. Mrs Long described him as over forty, a little taller than Chapman, of dark complexion, and of foreign, [...] "shabby-genteel" [...] appearance. He was wearing a brown deer-stalker hat and a dark overcoat. Another witness, carpenter Albert Cadosch, had entered the neighbouring yard at 27 Hanbury Street at about the same time, and <b>heard</b> <b>voices</b> in the yard followed by the sound of something falling against the fence.|$|E

On 17 June, as they {{prepared to leave}} again, Nansen thought he heard a dog bark and went to investigate. He then <b>heard</b> <b>voices,</b> {{and a few minutes}} later encountered a human being. It was Frederick Jackson, who had organised his own expedition to Franz Josef Land after being rejected by Nansen, and had based his headquarters at Cape Flora on Northbrook Island, the southernmost island of the archipelago. Jackson's own account records that his first reaction to this sudden meeting was to assume the figure to be a shipwrecked sailor, perhaps from the expedition's supply ship Windward which was due to call that summer. As he approached, Jackson saw [...] "a tall man, wearing a soft felt hat, loosely made, voluminous clothes and long shaggy hair and beard, all reeking with black grease". After a moment's awkward hesitation, Jackson recognised his visitor: [...] "You are Nansen, aren't you?", and received the reply [...] "Yes, I am Nansen." ...|$|E
500|$|... 12 Troop entered Mozambique on 31 July 1968 and {{contacted}} the enemy around noon, when Strong <b>heard</b> <b>voices</b> ahead and ordered his men {{out for a}} sweep. The guerrillas, encamped under trees on a slightly higher position {{on the other side}} of a dry riverbed, opened fire, wounding an RLI trooper. Strong called on the insurgents to surrender, to which they responded with obscenities and anti-white racist slogans before resuming fire. 12 Troop took cover and tossed phosphorus grenades to mask their advance; the men on the left rushed up the slope beneath the smoke and positioned themselves to the cadres' right. Under attack from the front and the right flank, the ZIPRA fighters soon fled, leaving seven dead and one wounded. Petter-Bowyer and the helicopters now arrived to give air support and wounded two insurgents, who took cover in a small, naturally formed tunnel. Lance-Corporal Lahee and one other man chased them to the tunnel and captured them. Of the remaining five guerrillas, four were killed and one captured. The focus now moved to the other group of cadres being chased south by Pearce's men.|$|E

2500|$|During {{their initial}} {{psychiatric}} assessment, the pseudopatients {{claimed to be}} hearing voices {{of the same sex}} as the patient which were often unclear, but which seemed to pronounce the words [...] "empty," [...] "hollow," [...] "thud," [...] and nothing else. These words were chosen as they vaguely suggest some sort of existential crisis and for the lack of any published literature referencing them as psychotic symptoms. No other psychiatric symptoms were claimed. If admitted, the pseudopatients were instructed to [...] "act normally," [...] reporting that they felt fine and no longer <b>heard</b> <b>voices.</b> Hospital records obtained after the experiment indicate that all pseudopatients were characterized as friendly and cooperative by staff.|$|E
2500|$|The {{film was}} {{originally}} {{planned to be}} produced by Touchstone Pictures—just as Shyamalan's previous four films were released by Walt Disney Studios—but ultimately no deal was reached. Disney executive Nina Jacobson had spoken with Shyamalan about the film's storyline, the idea for which studio chairman Dick Cook didn't understand. Shyamalan was reportedly angry about the response, claiming that Disney [...] "no longer valued individualism". Despite the fact that Disney was willing to completely fund the film regardless, Shyamalan rejected their offer and eventually presented the project to Warner Bros., who agreed to finance the film. The {{events that led to}} the making of the film were featured in a book, The Man Who <b>Heard</b> <b>Voices,</b> by Michael Bamberger.|$|E

Fish pleaded insanity, and claimed to have <b>heard</b> <b>voices</b> from God telling him to kill children. Several psychiatrists testified about Fish's sexual fetishes, which included sadism, masochism, cunnilingus, anilingus, fellatio, flagellation, exhibitionism, voyeurism, piquerism, cannibalism, coprophagia, urophilia, pedophilia and infibulation. Dempsey in his summation noted that Fish was a [...] "psychiatric phenomenon" [...] and that nowhere in legal or medical records was there another individual who possessed so many sexual abnormalities.|$|E

When drivers become frustrated by events their negative emotional state can escalate dangerously. This study examines behavioral and attitudinal effects of cognitively reframing frustrating events. Participants (N = 36) were asked to navigate {{a challenging}} driving course that included frustrating events such as long lights and being cut-off. Drivers {{were randomly assigned to}} three conditions. After encountering a frustrating event, drivers in a reappraisal-down condition <b>heard</b> <b>voice</b> prompts that reappraised the event in an effort to deflate negative reactions. Drivers in the second group, reappraisal-up, <b>heard</b> <b>voice</b> prompts that brought attention to the negative actions of vehicles and pedestrians. Drivers in a silent condition drove without hearing any voice prompts. Participants in the reappraisal-down condition had better driving behavior and reported less negative emotions than participants in the other conditions.
