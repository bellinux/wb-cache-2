40|$|In most bird species, pairs copulate {{many times}} before egg laying. The exact {{function}} of repeated <b>inseminations</b> (i. e. successful copulations) is unknown, but several suggestions have been made. We tested the hypothesis that repeated <b>inseminations</b> are required to ensure fertilization of eggs, by using an experimental method where free-ranging male collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis) were prevented from inseminating their mates. We show that egg fertility was lower when females had not copulated during the studied part of their fertile period. By counting sperm on the inner perivitelline layer of eggs, we estimated that a minimum of 86 sperm must reach the site of fertilization to ensure average fertility. Using the timing of <b>inseminations</b> and the numbers of sperm on successive eggs, we show that repeated copulations are necessary to achieve an average rate of fertilization of a single clutch. Our results thus provide evidence that repeated <b>inseminations</b> function to ensure fertilization success. We discuss possible constraints on sperm production and utilization that {{may have contributed to}} this pattern...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{investigated}} {{the frequencies of}} single and multiple matings in field-collected female Anopheles gam-biae by conducting microsatellite DNA analyses on the sperm contained within their spermatheca. Amplifcation by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at four loci allowed the detection of sperm extracts exhibiting more than two alleles per locus, thereby revealing the occurrence of multiple <b>inseminations.</b> Polyandry was found in six of 239 females examined, or 2. 5 % of the samples. Previous analyses of the molecular form of the sperm and female extracts using a PCR-based diagnostic procedure showed that two of these multiple <b>inseminations</b> involved cross-mating between two chromosomal/molecular forms of An. gambiae s. s.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine last-male sperm {{precedence}} in the domestic fowl. We used sperm from two different genotypes to assign paternity: and in seven experiments females were artificially inseminated with either equal or unequal numbers of sperm at intervals of 4 or 24 h. We were unable to replicate the results of a previous study by Compton et al. (1978) in which a strong last-male precedence effect had been recorded when two equal sized <b>inseminations</b> were made 4 h apart. We observed no marked last-male sperm precedence and our results did not differ significantly from that predicted by the passive sperm loss model, in which a last-male effect is determined by the rate at which sperm are lost from the female tract and the interval between successive <b>inseminations.</b> The most likely explanation for the disparity between our result and Compton et al.

40|$|Background: Gynecological {{endocrinology}} {{and reproductive}} medicine within the reproductive health systems {{of developing countries}} is underappreciated and methods to incorporate basic infertility workup and treatment needs to be addressed. However, most recommendations of how to proceed in particular, though, are very general. We exemplarily report our approach in Eritrea. Methods: Two one-week intensive training courses on gynecological endocrinology and reproductive medicine (lectures and hands on training) were given 2011 and 2012 at the Orotta National Referral Maternity Hospital in Asmara, Eritrea. Important subjects included: education and training in contraception fertility awareness, methods to optimize fertility potential, utilization of vaginal ultrasound for cycle monitoring, performance of hysterocontrastsonograhy, and one-step semen preparation for intrauterine <b>inseminations.</b> Results: After two intensive courses a basic infertility work up is possible with pelvic ultrasound assessment and contrastsonography for tubal patency. Simplified intrauterine <b>inseminations</b> after mild ovarian stimulation are possible as well and represent the first step into assisted reproduction. All procedures are feasible and performed independently by the trainees. Conclusions: Basic gynecological endocrinology and infertility care in resource-poor countries is possible. The Eritrean example of intensive courses with training in hysterocontrastsonography and one step intrauterine <b>inseminations</b> may encourage others to follow and introduce basic infertility care into other resource-poor countries...|$|R
5|$|Harmless to humans, the cloudy {{catshark}} adapts well to captivity and has {{reproduced in}} the aquarium. It {{is often used}} as a model organism in physiology research. On September 25, 1995, Masuda Motoyashi and colleagues used this species to perform the first successful artificial <b>insemination</b> of a shark or ray. The cloudy catshark is caught incidentally by commercial fisheries with bottom fishing nets including trawls and gillnets, {{as well as on}} bottom longlines. Captured individuals are typically discarded, possibly with a high survival rate due to their hardiness. Some 40% of the fish discarded in Yamaguchi Prefecture fisheries are of this species. The bottom trawl fishery operating off Fukushima Prefecture may catch over a ton of cloudy catsharks annually, which are also discarded.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the incidence of repeat breeding in dairy cows under tropical condition. This was a preliminary study conducted in Sinjai Regency, Indonesia. A total of 82 Holstein Friesian lactating cows from five dairy farmer groups were used in the present study. Of the 82 cows, 75. 6 % eventually became pregnant after repeated <b>inseminations</b> (AI). The incidence of repeat breeding in this area was very high (62 %). Days in milk (DIM) at first AI, first AI conception rate, and calving to conception interval were 62. 5 ± 19. 3 days, 0 %, and 202. 8 ± 150. 0 days, respectively. There was no difference in DIM at first AI between repeat breeders and normal fertility cows (60. 4 ± 15. 2 days vs 68. 3 ± 28. 6 days). However, normal fertility cows required only 123. 3 ± 52. 9 days to conceive and 2. 4 ± 0. 8 <b>inseminations</b> per pregnancy, whereas repeat breeders required significantly more days to conceive (222. 9 ± 134. 1 days) and more <b>inseminations</b> per pregnancy (4. 8 ± 0. 9).

5|$|Techniques such as {{artificial}} <b>insemination</b> and {{embryo transfer}} are frequently used today, {{not only as}} methods to guarantee that females breed regularly but also to help improve herd genetics. This may be done by transplanting embryos from high-quality females into lower-quality surrogate mothers – freeing up the higher-quality mother to be reimpregnated. This practice vastly increases the number of offspring which may be produced by a small selection of the best quality parent animals. On one hand, this improves {{the ability of the}} animals to convert feed to meat, milk, or fiber more efficiently, and improve the quality of the final product. On the other, it decreases genetic diversity, increasing the severity of certain disease outbreaks among other risks.|$|E

40|$|Since early {{fertility}} decline {{is a permanent}} problem of broiler breeders, {{the aim of this}} study was to test the effects of various sex ratios, spiking strategies and additional artificial <b>inseminations</b> (AI) on their breeding efficiency. Six breeder flocks were analysed during the whole reproduction cycle. In Flock A the sex ratio was maintained at 10 % during the whole cycle (control), while in Flock B the number of males was increased to a final ratio of 16 %. In Flocks C (technological control), D, E and F the ratio of males was gradually decreased from 10 % to 6. 5 % until the end of the cycle. Moreover, at the age of 44 weeks in Flocks D and E 50 and 100 % of cockerels were replaced by young ones, respectively, while in Flock F additional artificial <b>inseminations</b> were applied in the second half of the reproduction cycle. The increase of sperm transport was successful only in Groups B (increase in male numbers) and D (50 % replacement of old cockerels with young ones); however, it was not sufficient for increasing the fertility rates in either group. Nor did additional artificial <b>inseminations</b> (Flock F) have an effect on fertility. As a conclusion, it can be established that increasing the sperm count in the hens’ oviducts in any way could not improve fertility in the last third of the production cycle. The results also suggest that the expensive and labour-intensive spiking technique used in broiler breeder management is useless. The prime factor responsible for the shortened persistence of fertility may be the reduced ability of the female oviduct to accept and store sperm...|$|R
