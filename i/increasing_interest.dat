UConn also signed a landmark deal during the season with Connecticut Public Television to broadcast their games.|$|E
5|$|Alpha {{silicon carbide}} (α-SiC) {{is the most}} {{commonly}} encountered polymorph; it is formed at temperatures greater than 1700°C and has a hexagonal crystal structure (similar to Wurtzite). The beta modification (β-SiC), with a zinc blende crystal structure (similar to diamond), is formed at temperatures below 1700°C. Until recently, the beta form has had relatively few commercial uses, although there is now <b>increasing</b> <b>interest</b> in its use as a support for heterogeneous catalysts, owing to its higher surface area compared to the alpha form.|$|E

5|$|Chaplin {{developed}} {{a passion for}} music {{as a child and}} taught himself to play the piano, violin, and cello. He considered the musical accompaniment of a film to be important, and from A Woman of Paris onwards he took an <b>increasing</b> <b>interest</b> in this area. With the advent of sound technology, Chaplin began using a synchronised orchestral soundtrack – composed by himself – for City Lights (1931). He thereafter composed the scores for all of his films, and from the late 1950s to his death, he scored all of his silent features and some of his short films.|$|E
5|$|His <b>increasing</b> <b>interest</b> in {{mineralogy}} at {{this time}} is also apparent from the titles of two books he authored between 1803 and 1809. The first was a two volume work that appeared in 1804 entitled A Practical Essay on the Analysis of Minerals, which was reissued in 1808 as A Manual of Analytical Mineralogy. In 1809 he published Analysis of a Course of Lectures on Mineralogy. Beginning in 1808, while at the Surrey Institution, Accum also published, {{a series of articles}} on the chemical properties and composition of mineral water in Alexander Tilloch's Philosophical Journal.|$|E
5|$|Stone Gossard and Jeff Ament {{were members}} of {{pioneering}} grunge band Green River during the mid-1980s. Green River toured and recorded to moderate success but disbanded in 1987 due to a stylistic division between the pair and bandmates Mark Arm and Steve Turner. In late 1987, Gossard and Ament began playing with Malfunkshun vocalist Andrew Wood, eventually organizing the band Mother Love Bone. In 1988 and 1989, the band recorded and toured to <b>increasing</b> <b>interest</b> and found {{the support of the}} PolyGram record label, which signed the band in early 1989. Mother Love Bone's debut album, Apple, was released in July 1990, four months after Wood died of a heroin overdose.|$|E

5|$|Citi Bike {{finally began}} {{operations}} on May 27, 2013, with 332 stations. The stations {{were located in}} Manhattan south of 59th Street and in Brooklyn north of Atlantic Avenue and west of Nostrand Avenue. Officials said the system opened with 6,000 bikes. At the time of implementation, {{it was the largest}} bikesharing program in the United States. When launched, the system was slated to expand to 10,000 bicycles and 600 stations in Manhattan south of 79th Street, plus stations in several Brooklyn neighborhoods, including Greenpoint, Crown Heights, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Park Slope and Carroll Gardens as well as parts of Queens. At first, the timeline for the expansion was not made publicly available, but it was later announced that the expansion would be complete by the end of 2016. There has been <b>increasing</b> <b>interest</b> in further expansion across New York City; for example, in June 2013 a Brooklyn politician opened a petition drive to accelerate deployment in Greenpoint. In contrast, the May 2013 installation deliberately bypassed South Williamsburg.|$|E
5|$|Crowley had {{his first}} {{significant}} mystical experience while on holiday in Stockholm in December 1896. Several biographers, including Lawrence Sutin, Richard Kaczynski, and Tobias Churton, believed {{that this was the}} result of Crowley's first same-sex sexual experience, which enabled him to recognise his bisexuality. At Cambridge, Crowley maintained a vigorous sex life with women—largely with female prostitutes, from one of whom he caught syphilis—but eventually he took part in same-sex activities, despite their illegality. In October 1897, Crowley met Herbert Charles Pollitt, president of the Cambridge University Footlights Dramatic Club, and the two entered into a relationship. They broke apart because Pollitt did not share Crowley's <b>increasing</b> <b>interest</b> in Western esotericism, a break-up that Crowley would regret for many years.|$|E

Over the next few years, Einstein and Marić's friendship developed into romance, and they read books together on extra-curricular physics in which Einstein was taking an <b>increasing</b> <b>interest.</b> In 1900, Einstein was awarded the Zürich Polytechnic teaching diploma, but Marić failed the examination with a poor grade in the mathematics component, theory of functions. There have been claims that Marić collaborated with Einstein on his 1905 papers, known as the Annus Mirabilis papers, but historians of physics who have studied the issue find no evidence that she made any substantive contributions.|$|E
5|$|Miller {{was married}} {{three times and}} fathered seven {{children}}. Miller married Barbara Crow, from Shamrock, Texas, when she was 17. The couple had four children. The first child, Michael, died shortly after birth due to heart issues. They had three more children — Alan, Rhonda, and Shari. By the time Shari was born, Miller's career was blossoming into national popularity. The family remained in Inglewood {{for a short time}} after Miller found fame. The <b>increasing</b> <b>interest</b> in Miller caused struggles for the performer: He suffered from depression and insomnia, and had a drug addiction which contributed {{to the end of his}} first and second marriages. Miller was also notorious for walking off shows and fighting.|$|E
5|$|These {{powers were}} {{generally}} devolved {{to the prime}} minister and ministers. The matters are political by nature and call for political judgment rather than judicial control. Thus, Parliament is the most appropriate forum for debate and the best qualified to control the executive. However, in practice, parliamentary accountability of ministers is not entirely effective. The prerogative powers that the government officials exercise on behalf of the Crown, coupled with a weak system of checks and balances between the Parliament and the executive, can lead to an abuse of those powers which may be detrimental to the people. The possibility of such abuse, coupled with the way administrative law and judicial review evolved since the 1960s– a period of judicial activism– led courts in the United Kingdom to take an <b>increasing</b> <b>interest</b> {{in the manner in which}} prerogative powers had been exercised.|$|E

5|$|Think Tank, {{released}} in May 2003, {{was filled with}} atmospheric, brooding electronic sounds, featuring simpler guitar lines played by Albarn, and largely relying on other instruments to replace Coxon. The guitarist's absence also meant that Think Tank was almost entirely written by Albarn. Its sound {{was seen as a}} testament to Albarn's <b>increasing</b> <b>interest</b> in African and Middle Eastern music, and to his complete control over the group's creative direction. Think Tank was yet another UK number one and managed Blur's highest US position of number 56. It was also nominated for best album at the 2004 Brit Awards. The band did a successful tour in 2003, with former Verve guitarist Simon Tong filling in for Coxon.|$|E
5|$|Voyager 1s mission {{included}} a flyby of Titan, Saturn's largest moon, which {{had long been}} known to have an atmosphere. Images taken by Pioneer 11 in 1979 had indicated the atmosphere was substantial and complex, further <b>increasing</b> <b>interest.</b> The Titan flyby occurred as the spacecraft entered the system to avoid any possibility of damage closer to Saturn compromising observations, and approached to within , passing behind Titan as seen from Earth and the Sun. Voyager's measurement of the atmosphere's effect on sunlight, and Earth-based measurement of {{its effect on the}} probe's radio signal were used to determine the atmosphere's composition, density, and pressure. Titan's mass was also measured by observing its effect on the probe's trajectory. Thick haze prevented any visual observation of the surface, but the measurement of the atmosphere's composition, temperature, and pressure led to speculation that lakes of liquid hydrocarbons could exist on the surface.|$|E
5|$|At Queen Square, the Morris {{family lived}} in a flat {{directly}} above the Firm's shop. They were joined by Janey's sister Bessie Burton {{and a number of}} household servants. Meanwhile, changes were afoot at the Firm as Faulkner left, and to replace him they employed a business manager, Warrington Taylor, who would remain with them till 1866. Taylor pulled the Firm's finances into order and spent much time controlling Morris and ensuring that he worked to schedule. During these years the Firm carried out a number of high-profile designs; from September 1866 to January 1867, they redecorated the Armoury and Tapestry Room in St. James' Palace, in the latter year also designing the Green Dining Room at the South Kensington Museum (it is now the Morris Room at the Victoria and Albert Museum). The Firm's work received <b>increasing</b> <b>interest</b> from people in the United States, resulting in Morris's acquaintance with Henry James and Charles Eliot Norton. However, despite its success, the Firm was not turning over a large net profit, and this, coupled with the decreasing value of Morris' stocks, meant that he had to decrease his spending.|$|E

5|$|Until the 1970s, Mary Shelley {{was known}} mainly for {{her efforts to}} publish her husband's works and for her novel Frankenstein, which remains widely read and has {{inspired}} many theatrical and film adaptations. Recent scholarship has yielded a more comprehensive view of Mary Shelley’s achievements. Scholars have shown <b>increasing</b> <b>interest</b> in her literary output, particularly in her novels, which include the historical novels Valperga (1823) and Perkin Warbeck (1830), the apocalyptic novel The Last Man (1826), and her final two novels, Lodore (1835) and Falkner (1837). Studies of her lesser-known works, such as the travel book Rambles in Germany and Italy (1844) and the biographical articles for Dionysius Lardner's Cabinet Cyclopaedia (1829–46), support the growing view that Mary Shelley remained a political radical throughout her life. Mary Shelley's works often argue that cooperation and sympathy, particularly as practised by women in the family, were the ways to reform civil society. This view was a direct challenge to the individualistic Romantic ethos promoted by Percy Shelley and the Enlightenment political theories articulated by her father, William Godwin.|$|E
