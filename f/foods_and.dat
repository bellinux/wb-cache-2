40|$|This paper {{tests the}} {{potential}} for the <b>food</b> <b>and</b> wine tourism model developed by Hall and Sharples {{to be used as a}} tool for identifying specific <b>food</b> <b>and</b> wine segments in a destination. Using Cairns, Australia, as a case study a survey of tourists identified three <b>food</b> <b>and</b> wine segments and confirmed the ability of the model to be used to classify the destination’s position as a <b>food</b> <b>and</b> wine destination based on the categories developed by Hall and Sharples. Results of the survey indicate that although almost all participants experienced the destination’s <b>food</b> <b>and</b> wine products, only 45 % of respondents self-identified as <b>food</b> <b>and</b> wine tourists. A second group participated in <b>food</b> <b>and</b> wine experiences but did not select specific destinations on the basis of the destination’s <b>food</b> <b>and</b> wine sector. A third group expressed no interest in <b>food</b> <b>and</b> wine as a tourist experience but did consume unique <b>food</b> <b>and</b> wine as part of the overall tourist experience. The research found that the <b>food</b> <b>and</b> wine tourism model developed by Hall and Sharples was a useful tool for both identifying the stage of development of the <b>food</b> <b>and</b> wine industry and planning strategies to develop the sector. The paper concludes by outlining a number of implications for marketing <b>food</b> <b>and</b> wine tourism...|$|R
