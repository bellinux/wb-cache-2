25|$|The {{number of}} various {{molecules}} in an oil sample {{can be determined}} by laboratory analysis. The molecules are typically extracted in a solvent, then separated in a gas chromatograph, and finally determined with a suitable detector, such as a <b>flame</b> <b>ionization</b> <b>detector</b> or a mass spectrometer. Due to {{the large number of}} co-eluted hydrocarbons within oil, many cannot be resolved by traditional gas chromatography and typically appear as a hump in the chromatogram. This unresolved complex mixture (UCM) of hydrocarbons is particularly apparent when analysing weathered oils and extracts from tissues of organisms exposed to oil. Some of the component of oil will mix with water: the water associated fraction of the oil.|$|E
25|$|Supercritical fluid {{chromatography}} (SFC) {{can be used}} on {{an analytical}} scale, where it combines many of the advantages of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatography (GC). It can be used with non-volatile and thermally labile analytes (unlike GC) and can be used with the universal <b>flame</b> <b>ionization</b> <b>detector</b> (unlike HPLC), as well as producing narrower peaks due to rapid diffusion. In practice, the advantages offered by SFC have not been sufficient to displace the widely used HPLC and GC, except in a few cases such as chiral separations and analysis of high-molecular-weight hydrocarbons. For manufacturing, efficient preparative simulated moving bed units are available. The purity of the final products is very high, but the cost makes it suitable only for very high-value materials such as pharmaceuticals.|$|E
25|$|These two components, used together, allow a much finer {{degree of}} {{substance}} identification than either unit used separately. It {{is not possible}} to make an accurate identification of a particular molecule by gas chromatography or mass spectrometry alone. The mass spectrometry process normally requires a very pure sample while gas chromatography using a traditional detector (e.g. <b>Flame</b> <b>ionization</b> <b>detector)</b> cannot differentiate between multiple molecules that happen to take {{the same amount of time}} to travel through the column (i.e. have the same retention time), which results in two or more molecules that co-elute. Sometimes two different molecules can also have a similar pattern of ionized fragments in a mass spectrometer (mass spectrum). Combining the two processes reduces the possibility of error, as it is extremely unlikely that two different molecules will behave in the same way in both a gas chromatograph and a mass spectrometer. Therefore, when an identifying mass spectrum appears at a characteristic retention time in a GC-MS analysis, it typically increases certainty that the analyte of interest is in the sample.|$|E

50|$|In the oil {{industry}} katharometers {{have been used for}} a long time for hydrocarbon detection but have a history of unstable calibrations in non-stationary oil-related applications. In normal drilling practice, 5 hydrocarbon gases, plus a couple of non-hydrocarbon gases, are expected in normal samples resulting in cross-talk between the methane absorption line and the ethane. Hence the current use of <b>flame</b> <b>ionization</b> <b>detectors.</b>|$|R
50|$|Because gases {{produced}} by landfills are both valuable and sometimes hazardous, monitoring techniques have been developed. <b>Flame</b> <b>ionization</b> <b>detectors</b> {{can be used}} to measure methane levels as well as total VOC levels. Surface monitoring and sub-surface monitoring as well as monitoring of the ambient air is carried out. In the U.S., under the Clean Air Act of 1996, it is required that many large landfills install gas collection and control systems, which means that at the very least the facilities must collect and flare the gas.|$|R

50|$|Methanizer is an {{appliance}} used in gas chromatography, {{which allows}} to detect very low concentrations {{of carbon monoxide}} and carbon dioxide. It consists of a <b>flame</b> <b>ionization</b> <b>detector,</b> preceded by a hydrogenating reactor, which converts CO2 and CO into methane CH4.|$|E
50|$|The {{separated}} gases are {{detected by}} thermal conductivity detector for atmospheric gases, by <b>flame</b> <b>ionization</b> <b>detector</b> for hydrocarbons and oxides of carbon.

50|$|<b>Flame</b> <b>ionization</b> <b>detectors</b> cannot detect {{inorganic}} substances and some highly oxygenated or functionalized species like infrared and laser technology can. In some systems, CO and CO2 {{can be detected}} in the FID using a methanizer, which is a bed of Ni catalyst that reduces CO and CO2 to methane, which can be in turn detected by the FID. The methanizer is limited by its inability to reduce compounds other than CO and CO2 and its tendency to be poisoned {{by a number of}} chemicals commonly found in GC effluents.|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{investigation}} of dispersion from ground source {{on a single}} building model was performed. The measurements were conducted in boundary layer wind tunnel in Aerospace Research and Test Establishment (VZLU).

50|$|In the helium photoionization mode, the PDD is a universal, non-destructive, high {{sensitivity}} detector. The {{response to}} both inorganic and organic compounds is linear {{over a wide}} range. Response to fixed gases is positive (increase in standing current), with an MDQ in the low ppb range. The PDD in helium photoionization mode is an excellent replacement for <b>flame</b> <b>ionization</b> <b>detectors</b> in petrochemical or refinery environments, where the flame and use of hydrogen can be problematic. In addition, when the helium discharge gas is doped with a suitable noble gas, such as argon, krypton, or xenon (depending on the desired cutoff point), the PDD can function as a specific photoionization detector for selective determination of aliphatics, aromatics, amines, {{as well as other}} species.|$|R
40|$|Wind tunnel {{experiments}} {{have been conducted}} in order to characterize the expansion of heavy gas jets.

From experiments with two virtual sources simulating the expansion of two-phase jets in the atmosphere it is concluded that the thermodynamic processes proceeding during the large-scale gas expansion cannot completely taken into account by small-scale simulations.

30|$|The {{analyses}} of the headspace gases were performed on a system previously developed to measure trace atmospheric gases [17]. Briefly, a 233 Â cm 3 (at STP) sample was cryogenically pre-concentrated and injected into a multi-column/detector GC system. The system consists of three Hewlett-Packard 6890 GC units (Wilmington, DE) {{using a combination of}} columns and detectors capable of separating and quantifying hundreds of gases, including, but not limited to, non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs), alkyl nitrates, and halocarbons in the ppbv to pptv range (10 - 9 - 10 - 12). The <b>detectors</b> include <b>flame</b> <b>ionization</b> <b>detectors</b> (FIDs), electron capture detectors (ECDs), and a mass selective detector (MSD). Preliminary identifications of the unknown compounds were made using GC-MSD and verification was obtained by injecting the diluted headspace of pure compounds (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) to ensure that both the elution time and the mass spectrum matched that of the unknown.|$|R

The 2 D system with two mass-selective detectors was validated with use of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) standards and two standard reference materials from air and diesel exhaust. Furthermore, the system was applied to a real sample, wood smoke particulates. The PAH values determined correlated well with the previous data and those from the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The system enhanced the benefits of the previous system, which were limited by the low detectability and lack of mass selectivity.

In addition, when alkali ions are not added to the flame, AFD operates like a standard FID.|$|E
50|$|The TCD {{is a good}} {{general purpose}} {{detector}} for initial investigations with an unknown sample.

40|$|An {{automated}} analyser for total hydrocarbon contents and hydrocarbon composition (from methane to pentanes) was constructed and tested in both laboratory and field exploitation. It used two-channel analysis: continuous measurements of total hydrocarbon contents and periodic (90 or 150 s) composition analysis after separation of hydrocarbons on a gas chromatographic column. <b>Flame</b> <b>ionization</b> <b>detectors</b> {{were used in}} both channels. A simple 16 -bit analogue-to-digital converter was used (4. 8, practically four orders of magnitude), while the full measuring range (six orders of magnitude) was ensured by automatic dilution of the sample (or standard) with clean air.
