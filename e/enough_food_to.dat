5|$|Henderson and JPL {{director}} Bruce Ng {{prepare a}} space probe to deliver <b>enough</b> <b>food</b> <b>to</b> last Watney until Ares IV's arrival. When the Hab's airlock malfunctions {{due to a}} small puncture, it destroys Watney's crops. Sanders orders the team {{to speed up the}} supply mission with the Iris probe by skipping the safety inspections. However, an oversight causes the destabilization and subsequent explosion of the rocket 40 seconds after liftoff, causing Watney to think about his seemingly inevitable death.|$|E
5|$|Sitting Bull and {{his people}} stayed in Canada for 4 years. Due to the smaller size of the buffalo herds in Canada, Sitting Bull and his men found it {{difficult}} to find <b>enough</b> <b>food</b> <b>to</b> feed his people, who were starving and exhausted. Sitting Bull’s presence in the country led to increased tensions between the Canadian and the United States governments. Before Sitting Bull left Canada, he may have visited Walsh for a final time and left a ceremonial headdress as a memento.|$|E
5|$|A {{squadron}} {{commanded by}} Admiral Pierre Vanstabel was dispatched to Hampton Roads to provide escort. Vanstabel {{would bring the}} convoy to the Bay of Biscay, where a second squadron under Joseph-Marie Nielly would reinforce him {{for the rest of}} the journey. Together, these officers mustered six ships of the line and numerous smaller craft. The main French battlefleet of 25 ships under Admiral Villaret de Joyeuse would cruise the Bay of Biscay in order to challenge the British Channel Fleet if it attempted to intercept the supplies. The convoy's passage was expected to take approximately two months, and it included 117 merchant ships carrying <b>enough</b> <b>food</b> <b>to</b> feed France for a year.|$|E

5|$|Militants {{of unknown}} {{affiliation}} fired rockets at United Nations World Food Program (UNWFP) planes on 8 June near Luena and again near Kuito {{a few days}} later. As the first plane, a Boeing 727, approached Luena someone shot a missile at the aircraft, damaging one engine but not critically as the three-man crew landed successfully. The plane's altitude, , most likely prevented the assailant from identifying his target. As the citizens of Luena had <b>enough</b> <b>food</b> <b>to</b> last them several weeks, the UNFWP temporarily suspended their flights. When the flights began again a few days later, militants shot at a plane flying to Kuito, the first attack targeting UN workers since 1999. The UNWFP again suspended food aid flights throughout the country. While he did not claim responsibility for the attack, UNITA spokesman Justino said the planes carried weapons and soldiers rather than food, making them acceptable targets. UNITA and the Angolan government both said the international community needed to pressure the other side into returning to the negotiating table. Despite the looming humanitarian crisis, neither side guaranteed UNWFP planes safety. Kuito, which had relied on international aid, only had <b>enough</b> <b>food</b> <b>to</b> feed their population of 200,000 {{until the end of}} the week. The UNFWP had to fly in all aid to Kuito and the rest of the Central Highlands because militants ambushed trucks. Further complicating the situation, potholes in the Kuito airport strip slowed aid deliveries. Overall chaos reduced the amount of available oil to the point at which the UN had to import its jet fuel.|$|E
5|$|The farm invasions {{severely}} impacted agricultural development. Zimbabwe {{had produced}} over two {{million tons of}} maize in 2000; by 2008 this had declined to approximately 450,000. By October 2003, Human Rights Watch reported {{that half of the}} country's population were food insecure, lacking <b>enough</b> <b>food</b> <b>to</b> meet basic needs. By 2009, 75% of Zimbabwe's population were relying on food aid, the highest proportion of any country at that time. Zimbabwe faced continuing economic decline. In 2000, the country's GDP was US $7.4 billion; by 2005 this had declined to US $3.4 billion. Inflation resulted in economic crisis. By 2007, Zimbabwe had the highest inflation rate in the world, at 7600%. By 2008, inflation exceeded 100,000% and a loaf of bread cost a third of the average daily wage. Increasing numbers of Zimbabweans relied on remittances from relatives abroad.|$|E
5|$|The {{second phase}} was {{contingency}} training, {{which focused on}} astronauts learning the skills required to survive if the landing did not occur where planned. The group started their training by being dropped off {{in the middle of}} the jungle in Panama. They performed the survival training in pairs, carrying only their parachutes and survival kits. Chaffee, with help from his Boy Scout training, foraged for <b>enough</b> <b>food</b> <b>to</b> survive during the three-day training mission. Following the jungle training, the astronauts traveled to an entirely different environment: the desert of Reno, Nevada. For clothing, the astronauts had only long underwear, shoes, and robes they manufactured from their parachutes. Lizards and snakes were the main source of food, and the astronauts used their parachutes as makeshift tents for shelter for the two days of desert training.|$|E

5|$|To {{preserve}} Zutphen's garrison, Farnese gathered <b>enough</b> <b>food</b> <b>to</b> feed 4,000 men {{for three}} months in the towns of Groenlo, Oldenzaal, Lingen and Münster. As this food was carried to Borculo, a large convoy was formed to resupply Zutphen. Farnese gave command of the mission to Alfonso Félix de Ávalos Aquino y Gonzaga, Marquis del Vasto, under whom he put an escort of 2,500 infantry− 1,000 of them Spanish– and 600 Italian and Albanian cavalry, according to the Jesuit historian Famiano Strada, or just 600 infantry and 300 cavalry as claimed by the Spanish chronicler and soldier Alonso Vázquez, who was an eyewitness. On 21 September Farnese {{sent a letter to}} Verdugo commanding him to leave Zutphen with 1,000 men, meet the convoy and deliver it to the town. Farnese's courier, however, was intercepted near Lochem and Leicester learned of the convoy. Persuaded by one of his confidants, Captain Rowland York, he prepared an ambush. York had served for some years in the Dutch States Army before being imprisoned on charges of pretending to surrender Dendermonde to the Spanish. When Brussels fell to Farnese, he was freed and went to serve Leicester, whose confidence he earned.|$|E

This was a decrease from an estimate of roughly 1 billion malnourished people in 2009. In 2007, 923 million people were reported as being undernourished, an increase of 80 million since 1990-92. It has also been recorded that the world already produces <b>enough</b> <b>food</b> <b>to</b> support the world's population.|$|E
25|$|A {{large portion}} of Mexico's {{population}} relies on agriculture for food. However, the government's attempts to balance subsidies (which encourage farmers to grow more crops) while trying to keep food prices low can complicate the process of obtaining locally grown foods. Recently, decreased government support of agriculture has crippled maize farmers' ability to produce <b>enough</b> <b>food</b> <b>to</b> feed the population. In addition, Mexico is vulnerable to drought which can further cripple agriculture.|$|E
25|$|LU Wolf is the mascot for the University. He was {{inspired}} by the coat-of-arms of St. Ignatius of Loyola, from whom Loyola derives its name, which depicts two wolves standing over a kettle. Taken from the heraldic crest carved in the lintel on St. Ignatius' family home in Azpeitia, Spain, the wolves and cauldron refer to the prosperity and generosity of the Loyola family, who, after feeding family, retainers and soldiers, had <b>enough</b> <b>food</b> <b>to</b> feed even the wild animals.|$|E

25|$|It is {{estimated}} that 70% of worldwide water is used for irrigation, with 15-35% of irrigation withdrawals being unsustainable. It takes around 2,000 - 3,000 litres of water to produce <b>enough</b> <b>food</b> <b>to</b> satisfy one person's daily dietary need. This is a considerable amount, when compared to that required for drinking, which is between two and five litres. To produce food for the now over 7 billion people who inhabit the planet today requires the water that would fill a canal ten metres deep, 100 metres wide and 2100 kilometres long.|$|E
25|$|In 1789 former convict James Ruse {{produced}} {{the first successful}} wheat harvest in NSW. He repeated this success in 1790 and, because of the pressing need for food production in the colony, was rewarded by Governor Phillip with the first land grant made in New South Wales. Ruse's 30 acre grant at Rose Hill, near Parramatta, was aptly named 'Experiment Farm'. This was the colony's first successful farming enterprise, and Ruse was soon joined by others. The colony began to grow <b>enough</b> <b>food</b> <b>to</b> support itself, and {{the standard of living}} for the residents gradually improved.|$|E
25|$|Dolores Huerta {{grew up in}} Stockton, California, {{which was}} in the San Joaquin Valley, an area filled with farms. In the early 1950s, she {{completed}} a degree at Delta Community College, part of the University of the Pacific. She briefly worked as an elementary school teacher. Huerta saw that her students, many of them children of farm workers, were living in poverty without <b>enough</b> <b>food</b> <b>to</b> eat or other basic necessities. To help, she became {{one of the founders of}} the Stockton chapter of the Community Service Organization (CSO). The CSO worked to improve social and economic conditions for farm workers and to fight discrimination.|$|E

25|$|The tunnels {{accommodated}} {{what amounted}} to an underground city. The entire 16,000-strong garrison could be housed there along with <b>enough</b> <b>food</b> <b>to</b> last them for 16 months. Within the tunnels there were also an underground telephone exchange, a power generating station, a water distillation plant, a hospital, a bakery, ammunition magazines and a vehicle maintenance workshop. They also housed one of Gibraltar's most secret places – Stay Behind Cave, built for Operation Tracer, a plan to maintain a secret observation post manned by six men within the Rock if it had fallen to a German invasion. It was not rediscovered until as recently as 1997.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} by rights groups that several land seizures of Akha land have been undertaken {{in the name of}} the Queen of Thailand. Originally a semi-nomadic people, the Akha are often relocated by the presiding national government to permanent villages, after which the government allegedly sells to logging companies and other private corporations access to lands formerly occupied by the Akha. The land onto which the Akha are displaced is almost always less fertile than their previous plots. On their new lands, the Akha can rarely produce <b>enough</b> <b>food</b> <b>to</b> sustain themselves and are often forced to leave and seek employment outside the villages, thus disrupting their traditional culture and economy.|$|E
25|$|A growing {{differentiation}} {{in terms}} of wealth that is visible among settlements sites but especially among burials, indicates the development of social hierarchies. This {{is illustrated by the}} discovery, in 2005, of the burial of a 2-year old child near the Heuneburg, accompanied by imported (Etruscan) jewellery. It is clear that a young child could not have earned or gained such wealth, hence the individual must have been born rich. There is probably also an element of political centralisation involved in these processes. The fact that the Heuneburg and Aussensiedlung were not able to locally produce <b>enough</b> <b>food</b> <b>to</b> support their own populations implied quite clearly that they must have been able to receive and maintain the support of a much larger surrounding area.|$|E
