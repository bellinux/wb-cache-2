25|$|His use {{of glass}} and an <b>exposed</b> <b>steel</b> frame in this design was both radical and functional, {{although}} soon after completion it drew criticism from {{a new generation of}} architects that rejected Art Nouveau.|$|E
25|$|Starting on July 4, 2000, and for {{subsequent}} special occasions, each tower is illuminated by 380 light fixtures that highlight the <b>exposed</b> <b>steel</b> structure. On each tower {{there are a}} mix of 150 and 1000 watt metal halide lamp fixtures. The architectural lighting design was completed by Domingo Gonzalez Associates.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{design for the}} towers of the bridge called {{for them to be}} encased in concrete and granite. However, because of cost considerations during the Great Depression and favorable aesthetic critiques of the bare steel towers, this was never done. The <b>exposed</b> <b>steel</b> towers, with their distinctive criss-crossed bracing, have become one of the bridge's most identifiable characteristics.|$|E
50|$|Four Seasons Arena is a {{concrete}} and steel structure. The exterior is painted unfinished concrete. The interior walls are unfinished concrete, to which sound-absorbent acoustical panels (made of fabric-covered wood) are attached. The floor is finished, polished concrete. The interior ceiling consists of <b>exposed</b> painted <b>steel</b> beams.|$|R
50|$|An {{element in}} the design was {{a focus on the}} media center and its {{application}} of technology. A path that circles the media center leads visitors to all the major facilities. Concrete masonry, <b>exposed</b> structural <b>steel,</b> glass and metal roofs make up the majority of the building exteriors.|$|R

25|$|TD Bank Ballpark was {{designed}} by architectural firms Clarke Caton Hintz and SSP Architectural Group. The ballpark's wine-colored brick and green <b>exposed</b> <b>steel</b> facade and metal roof is designed to evoke the historic character and elements reminiscent {{of some of the}} country's older stadiums. The ballpark was honored for its outstanding design with a New Jersey Golden Trowel Grand Design Award.|$|E
25|$|The {{elevated}} section {{built with}} concrete girders was not built {{to withstand the}} use of road salt in the winter. The salt created corrosion of the steel within the concrete bents (vertical columns and horizontal caps), which expanded and weakened the steel, and caused pieces of concrete to fall off. Remedial work had to be applied starting in the 1990s {{at a cost of}} $8 million per year. The remedial work included sealing expansion joints to force the salty water into the drains and extensive patching of the concrete columns. <b>Exposed</b> <b>steel</b> was sand-blasted and repainted.|$|E
25|$|The entire {{movement}} of German architectural modernism {{was known as}} Neues Bauen. Beginning in June 1907, Peter Behrens' pioneering industrial design work for the German electrical company AEG successfully integrated art and mass production on a large scale. He designed consumer products, standardized parts, created clean-lined designs for the company's graphics, developed a consistent corporate identity, built the modernist landmark AEG Turbine Factory, and made full use of newly developed materials such as poured concrete and <b>exposed</b> <b>steel.</b> Behrens was {{a founding member of}} the Werkbund, and both Walter Gropius and Adolf Meyer worked for him in this period.|$|E

5000|$|It {{was built}} in 1923 by Grenander/Fehse/Jennen. Due to massive {{financial}} problems, the station {{was built in}} a very simple way, without any artwork: the walls are covered only in plaster, and many columns are left as <b>exposed,</b> painted <b>steel.</b> In 1951 the station was renamed [...] "Walter-Ulbricht-Stadion" [...] after the stadium nearby.|$|R
5000|$|The Fensalir by Jeroen van Schooten (of Van Schooten and Meyer Architecten in Amsterdam) is {{the tallest}} {{building}} in Zilverparkkade. The ground floor and first floor (mezzanine) are designated for commercial space, storerooms and staircase {{with access to}} apartments which fill the upper floors. Floors 11, 12 and 13 form a [...] "head" [...] that stands above the neighbouring buildings, visually separated by the tenth floor breaking {{the line of the}} walls and <b>exposing</b> <b>steel</b> girders supporting the upper floors. This break is further emphasized by the upper floors being oriented east-west, providing the inhabitants with views not available from the lower floors and the other buildings, which are oriented north-south. Furthermore, the southern wall, facing Zilverparkkade and the Zilverpark, is [...] "blind" [...] on those floors. The building is named after Fensalir, a location mentioned in Norse mythology.|$|R
25|$|In 2000 she won an {{international}} {{competition for the}} Phaeno Science Center, in Wolfsburg, Germany (2002–2005). The new museum was only a little larger than the Cincinnati Museum, with 9,000 square metres of space, but the plan was much more ambitious. It was similar in concept to the buildings of Le Corbusier, raised up seven metres on concrete pylons. Unlike Corbusier's buildings, she planned for the space under the building {{to be filled with}} activity, and each of the 10 massive inverted cone-shaped columns that hold up the building contains a cafe, a shop, or a museum entrance. The tilting columns reach up through the building and also support the roof. The museum structure resembles an enormous ship, with sloping walls and asymmetric scatterings of windows, and the interior, with its angular columns and <b>exposed</b> <b>steel</b> roof framework, gives the illusion of being inside a working vessel or laboratory.|$|E
500|$|The {{ballpark}} {{was designed}} by HOK Sport, now known as Populous, a division of Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum. HOK designed it as the second retro-modern ballpark, with asymmetrical fences of varying heights, a smaller upper deck, and stepped tiers. It is similar to HOK's Oriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore, {{which was the first}} retro-modern ballpark. The ballpark was sited to give a favorable view of Cleveland's downtown skyline. The structural engineering was done by a Cleveland company, Osborn Engineering, which helped design League Park, Cleveland Municipal Stadium, [...] "Old" [...] Yankee Stadium and Fenway Park. It was designed to blend in with the city of Cleveland with its <b>exposed</b> <b>steel</b> design and the vertical light towers [...] that match the smoke stacks of Cleveland’s industrial zone.|$|E
2500|$|The JLTV {{could have}} polyfibroblast applied to it, {{a type of}} {{self-healing}} paint developed by the Office of Naval Research and Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory made to decrease vehicle maintenance. [...] Development began in 2008 and created a powder consisting of microscopic liquid-filled polymer spheres that can be combined with standard primers. [...] The substance lets paint scratches heal by breaking capsules and forming a coating over the <b>exposed</b> <b>steel</b> before corrosion takes place, cutting maintenance costs and allowing vehicles {{to operate in the}} field longer.|$|E
40|$|Most {{available}} data sets {{for the long-term}} corrosion loss of various grades of weathering <b>steel</b> <b>exposed</b> to marine atmospheric environments are demonstrated {{to be consistent with}} the multi-phase corrosion model previously proposed for <b>steels</b> <b>exposed</b> to marine environments. This means that the early corrosion of weathering steels by oxidation is gradually inhibited by the build-up of corrosion products. These produce anoxic and sub-oxic conditions that may permit microbiological activity to govern the longerterm corrosion loss process. This new interpretation for the long-term corrosion of weathering steels may have implications for the design of such steels...|$|R
30|$|<b>Exposed</b> bolted <b>steel</b> plate {{connections}} {{performed the}} worst, {{due to the}} rapid heating with exposure to high temperatures. Providing a single layer of gypsum board was shown to nearly double the fire resistance time, with nearly a 50  % increase for plywood protection. Additionally, fire resistance was shown to improve with increase in wood section width and decrease in the applied structural loading.|$|R
50|$|Witthoefft House is a {{historic}} home located at Armonk, Westchester County, New York. It was built in 1957, and is a one-story, Modernist style dwelling on a concrete slab foundation and stone covered concrete retaining walls. It features <b>exposed</b> structural <b>steel,</b> white glazed-brick walls, and full elevations of glass. The house is perched atop rock outcroppings in a semi-rural setting.|$|R
2500|$|The Admiralty {{set up the}} [...] "Torpedo Committee" [...] in 1872 {{to examine}} {{ways in which the}} newly invented Whitehead torpedo could be {{launched}} at sea. [...] The Royal Navy's first purpose-built torpedo launching ship was HMS Vesuvius, which, with a maximum speed of less than 10 knots, [...] was intended to stealthily approach within a few hundred yards of enemy ships at night to launch her torpedoes. Leading on from this, Barnaby and his assistant J Dunn, proposed in the mid-1870s a fast cigar-shaped vessel with five submerged torpedo tubes and protected by 2 inches of armour over the deck. The design was modified in late 1875 into a larger vessel equipped with a ram. Early in 1876 the design was modified again into a [...] unarmoured torpedo ram with a top speed of 17 knots. Later the design was modified yet again to have armour added to the <b>exposed</b> <b>steel</b> deck.|$|E
2500|$|In May 1980, Mazda {{released}} a {{limited production run}} of special North American models known as the Leathersport Models. This package was essentially an uprated GS model with added LS badges on each B-pillar, special striping, and LS-only gold anodized wheels (with polished outer face and wheel rim). All LS editions came equipped with special LS-only full brown leather upholstery, leather wrapped steering wheel, leather wrapped shift knob, removable sunroof, LS-specific four-speaker AM/FM stereo radio with power antenna (though listed as a six speaker stereo, as the two rear dual voice coil speakers were counted as four speakers in total), remote power door side mirrors, and other standard GS equipment. Two primary options were also available; a three-speed JATCO 3N71B automatic transmission and air conditioning. Other GS options such as cassette tape deck, splash guards, padded center console arm rest and others could be added by the dealer. The LS model was only ever available in three different exterior colors: Aurora White, Brilliant Black, and Solar Gold. No official production records are known to exist or to have been released. This series of RX-7 had <b>exposed</b> <b>steel</b> bumpers and a high-mounted indentation-located license plate, called by Werner Buhrer of Road & Track magazine a [...] "Baroque depression." ...|$|E

50|$|The second generation, build series W451 (internally: C 451, Coupé - A 451, Cabrio), was {{introduced}} in November 2006—its length increased by 200 mm to 106.1 in and offering improved crash performance. The second generation retained the interchangeable plastic body panels {{as well as the}} prominent <b>exposed,</b> rigid <b>steel</b> safety cell, which is 50% high-strength steel, hot-dip galvanised and powder-coated—and marketed as Tridion.|$|R
50|$|When modern {{architecture}} {{was first}} practiced, {{it was an}} avant-garde movement with moral, philosophical, and aesthetic underpinnings. Immediately after World War I, pioneering modernist architects sought to develop a completely new style appropriate for a new post-war social and economic order, focused on {{meeting the needs of}} the middle and working classes. They rejected the architectural practice of the academic refinement of historical styles which served the rapidly declining aristocratic order. The approach of the Modernist architects was to reduce buildings to pure forms, removing historical references and ornament in favor of functionalist details. Buildings displayed their functional and structural elements, <b>exposing</b> <b>steel</b> beams and concrete surfaces instead of hiding them behind decorative forms. Architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright developed Organic architecture, in which the form was defined by its environment and purpose, with an aim to promote harmony between human habitation and the natural world with prime examples being Robie House and Fallingwater.|$|R

30|$|A {{comparable}} system-level {{fire test}} for a multi-story timber structure {{would have the}} potential to lead to a significant step-change in the understanding and acceptance of multi-story timber frame buildings. In {{the same way that the}} Cardington tests resulted in a step-change in the acceptance of <b>exposed</b> structural <b>steel,</b> a multi-story building test with full burn out may assist with the acceptance of large timber buildings.|$|R
50|$|Epoxy and {{modified}} epoxy are standard coatings {{used to provide}} protective barriers to corrosion in ballast tanks. <b>Exposed,</b> unprotected <b>steel</b> will corrode much more rapidly than steel covered with this protective layer. Many ships also use sacrificial anodes or an impressed current for additional protection. Empty ballast tanks will corrode faster than areas fully immersed due to the thin - and electo conducting - moisture film covering them.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, the six large arched {{windows at}} {{the west end of}} the {{building}} were uncovered. Painted over for years, they were refitted with filtered glass to allow them to remain uncovered during games. The acoustical ceiling, installed in 1967 for use as a concert and music hall, was removed to <b>expose</b> the <b>steel</b> rafters. The rafters and the black ceiling above them were painted in an off-white buff tone.|$|R
