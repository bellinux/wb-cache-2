500|$|For José Pierre, Whaam! {{represents}} Lichtenstein's 1963 expansion [...] "into the 'epic' vein". Keith Roberts, in a 1968 Burlington Magazine article, {{described the}} explosion as combining [...] "art nouveau elegance with a nervous energy reminiscent of Abstract Expressionism". Wendy Steiner believes {{the work is}} Lichtenstein's most successful and harmonious comic-based composition. She sees the narrative and graphic elements as complementary: the action and spatial alignment lead the viewer's eye {{from left to right}} so as to emphasize the relationship between the action and its explosive consequence. The ellipses of the text balloon present a progression which culminates with a [...] "WHAAM!". The [...] "coincidence of pictorial and verbal order" [...] are clear for the Western viewer with the <b>explanatory</b> <b>text</b> beginning in the upper left and action vector moving from the left foreground to the right background, culminating in a graphical explosion in tandem with a narrative exclamation. Steiner says the striking incongruity of the two panels—the left panel appearing to be [...] "truncated", while the right depicts a centralized explosion—enhances the work's narrative power.|$|E
