50|$|Masbate {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} {{settlements}} in the Philippines. Archaeological records show that Batungan (in Mandaon) and Bagumbayan (in Palanas) were major settlement sites during the Bronze Age (4000-1000 BC). The development of bronze metallurgy in South-East Asia coincided with an increasingly hierarchical society, firmly based on agricultural village settlements. It was these crucial changes, the introduction of new technologies, new social forms, and a new economic base, which culminated in the foundation of the proto-urban settlements of the 1st millennium AD. A fine stone chisel from Mount Batungan is dated to the twelfth century BC. Of the age of Philippine neoliths it is only possible to say that polished stone adzes from Masbate have been dated from 2710 BC to AD 179.2 Kalanay (in Aroroy) was an island site from 1000 BC-AD 850 (early metal). Masbateño burial jars and a small pottery skull box found in caves dated to the beginning of the Christian era. Exquisite goldwork represents an old Philippine wealth in both an economic and an artistic sense: all sorts of wrought or molded ornaments and jewelry demonstrate both the availability of the raw material and the skill of the artisan - finger rings, earrings, <b>head-bands,</b> pendants and pectoral ornaments, heavy chains with interlocking serrated edges, light filigree work, delicate necklaces of fine twisted wires, 12-millimeter beads composed of 184 separate granules soldered together, thin hammered sheets for decorating grosser objects like earplugs or the visages of corpses, and a charming little snail of unknown use. Productive mines in Benguet, Butuan, Masbate, and Paracale were in operation and gold being panned in riverbeds all over the archipelago when the Spaniards arrived.|$|R

During The Adventures of Mimi Tour in 2006, Carey performed the song at select shows. For the performances of the song, she donned a long yellow cocktail gown and black Christian Louboutin pumps. Once again Lorenz was featured on stage, however with the addition of two different female back-up singers, MaryAnn and Sherry Tatum. Carey also performed the song at the 2015 Billboard Music Awards along with Infinity to promote her number 1 To Infinity album. Carey also included the song in her Las Vegas residency, Mariah Carey Number 1's, a chronicle of her 18 US number 1 hits. The song was first in the chronological setlist, and for the performance Carey donned a black sequined gown, and her signature curls.|$|E
5000|$|Raphael reused {{in many of}} his {{sketches}} {{the staff}} in his studio as models, so call “garazone” who were not always used in the final versions of the painting. This is quite evident in the 'Borghese Deposition' study currently in the British Museum suggested to be from around 1508, in which the draped person carrying the torso of the Christ was not used in the final version. This garzone {{appears to be in}} the 'Adoration of the Shepherds' [...] This specific garzone, identified by his distinct nose and ear, his beard, his hairstyle, and even his clothing. This same garzone seems also to appear also in the Death of Adonis', from ca 1508, in the Ashmoelan museum, carrying the torso of Adonis. The distinct nose is visible, along with the beard and even the <b>head-band.</b> Interesting is however the verso side of this drawing, referred to as the 'Adam Tempted', in which an often uncommented sketch of an infant reclining backward and resting on his left arm, while lifting, {{what seems to be a}} drape, or holding the hand of the virgin, with his right arm. Johannides mentions that this child is taken from Bellini’s Madonna with a Sleeping Child (Boston Gardner Museum). However this small figure also bears however a likeness to the infant Jesus in the 'Adoration of the Shepherds'. In the 'Adoration of the Shepherds', the child has “woken up” and turned its head towards the virgin, who no longer supports his head, she has retracted her hand to her bosom. An addition Garzone is perhaps the Virgin, whos distinct face can be recognized in the 'Madonna of the goldfinch'. The likeness is so striking that it is hard to deny that it would be based on the same person.The reuse of ideas and images was also a distinct trait of Raphael, as Ames-Lewis discusses, Raphael was under enormous pressure and needed to optimized economize within his resources. The reused of figures and Ideas could come many years later, of which Raphael either pulled from sketches or from is memory. The technique used by Raphael is to do a quick preparatory stylus sketch on prepared paper before working in chalk. Raphael reused his figures, according to Ames- Lewis: “A figure which he studied carefully for use in one context but the rejected as no longer suitable to the way the design had evolved, may reappear in another similar context.” [...] Such a figure is again the kneeling shepherd, whom Raphael, seems to have converted to the 'lame man', in the 'Healing of the Lame Man', from 1516, as seen in the cartoon, now in the Victoria and Albert Museum. One distinct feature is the barrel around the waist. Such a barrel does also appear in the Metropolitan engraving of the 'Adoration of the Shepherds' by School Marcantonio Raimondo, curisouly attributed to have been engraved in Bologna, but after a design by Raphael.|$|E
30|$|The <b>head-band</b> {{frame is}} a {{composite}} of plastic and Velcro straps with fabric (Fig.  1 C and 1 D). The diameter of the <b>head-band</b> may be adjusted using either the Velcro straps, or the ratcheting wheel located {{on the front of}} the <b>head-band</b> (Fig.  1 C). Ideal location of the band is just above the orbital margins. Near the temporal windows, the <b>head-band</b> frame contains plastic inverted “U-shaped” pieces following the course of the superior temporal line, meant for mounting the robotic drive/TCD probe construct (Fig.  1 B). This is accomplished using wing-nut fasteners. The entire <b>head-band</b> is padded with exchangeable Neoprene inserts, for comfort (Fig.  1 A).|$|E
30|$|Finally, we {{observed}} {{that in one}} patient with scalp soft tissue bruising, the ratcheting <b>head-band</b> triggered a sustained intra-cranial pressure elevation above 20  mmHg lasting 5  min, with an initial baseline ICP of 10 – 15  mmHg. This was promptly resolved by re-adjusting the <b>head-band.</b> In this one patient, however, the sedation was relatively light, and thus the ICP elevation was likely secondary to pain experienced during the <b>head-band</b> tightening. Nevertheless, {{this is an important}} potential complication to highlight.|$|E
30|$|The <b>head-band</b> {{appeared}} to be comfortable, with the padding protecting surgical wounds from injury, to rarely moving once secured. Once in situ, the <b>head-band,</b> with attached robotic drive/TCD probes tolerated patient turning in each patient, without loss of CBFV waveform or intensity. Furthermore, 2 of the 10 patients underwent portable chest x-ray while recording, with no change in signal intensity throughout this procedure. Finally, 1 of the 10 patients underwent a bedside chest-tube insertion without change in signal quality.|$|E
