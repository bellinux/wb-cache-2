25|$|Her {{original}} {{power was}} nothing more than was due to earnestness and intellectual clearness within a certain range. With small imaginative and suggestive powers, and therefore nothing approaching to genius, she could see clearly what she did see, and give a clear expression to what she <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> In short, she could popularize while she could neither discover nor invent.|$|E

In the 2009 general elections, he kept the Amritsar seat defeating Om Prakash Soni of INC by 6858 votes.

25|$|His poems display {{neither the}} {{incoherence}} of nostalgia for some mentally palatable past nor, however vaguely charted, {{the possibility of}} the future. All he had was the present, which was not to his Muse’s liking, and eventually not to his own either. His poetry, in other words, is that of the here and now and of no escape, except for poetry itself. Yet for all he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about the present, his language is amazingly clear and direct, and the formal aspects of his verse are amazingly conservative. Evidently Kees did not feel the imperative of arrythmia so palpable among his less memorable peers, not to mention successors.|$|E

Their black Flag, under which they had committed abundance of Pyracies and Murders, was affix'd to one Corner of the Gallows. It had in it the Portraiture of Death, with an Hour-Glass in one Hand, and a Dart in the other, striking into a Heart, and three Drops of Blood delineated as falling from it. This Flag they called Old Roger, and us'd to say, They would live and die under it.|$|E

25|$|Lecca's new {{missions}} did not alienate {{him from}} the German circles, and he witnessed first-hand the Germans' growing involvement in Romania's antisemitic policies. He {{was caught in the}} middle as Horst Böhme, who headed the RSHA branch in Bucharest, began investigating Killinger's bureaucratic work. This was a local facet of the violent conflict opposing the RSHA and the German Foreign Office. Böhme, who wanted to speed up the Final Solution project, was described by Lecca as a person of outstanding cruelty, promoted as kudos for his earlier rule of terror in Bohemia-Moravia. Lecca alleged that both Killinger and the senior Schutzstaffel delegate, Richter, were alarmed by Böhme's scrutiny of their dealings with the CE. He writes that Böhme accused both colleagues for leniency and incompetence, displaying such arrogance as to invite in speculation that he was mentally ill. In one of his own RSHA reports, Böhme worried that Killinger had lost Antonescu's respect, and that, among Romanians, Lecca was the only one still interested in what the German Ambassador <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> Eventually, Böhme's notes angered the German Foreign Minister, Joachim von Ribbentrop, who obtained his reassignment, freeing Killinger of a nuisance.|$|E
25|$|Ivo Josipović gave a short speech {{after the}} exit polls were {{announced}} saying he was confident the official results would match the results they predicted. After the official results were published, he gave a victory speech shortly after midnight thanking his colleagues and especially his voters for their support and expressed conviction {{he would be the}} victor once again two weeks later. He said the citizens of Croatia have a choice between the light and the dark, with him being the light, referring to his untarnished political record, and Bandić being the dark, referring to his allegations of corruption. Milan Bandić arrived to his campaign headquarters {{just a couple of minutes}} before midnight and just a couple of minutes after the results were announced he gave his speech. He congratulated all the other candidates and said a new race began that night. He said he would be an independent president, not a remote-control of Zoran Milanović and accused Josipović of being a project of the highest-ranking members of SDP. He claimed Croatia needs a president that works for them, not for his party. While he was speaking, most television networks were showing scenes from Josipović headquarters in the corner, with Milanović observing Bandić's remarks. During the middle of his speech, right when Bandić was bashing his former party and its leader, Josipović came to the stage and all television stations switched to hear what he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b>|$|E
500|$|In retrospect, Biden {{would take}} the blame for his {{mistakes}} during the campaign. [...] On one, he said, [...] "All I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> was 'Like Kinnock.' If I'd just said those two words, 'Like Kinnock,' and I didn't. It was my fault, nobody else's fault." [...] On another, he ruefully recalled, [...] "'Hey pal, you want to compare IQs?'

500|$|In {{addition}} to {{encouraging people to}} search for Herb, Burger King added an [...] "I'm not Herb" [...] promotion to their marketing campaign.

To get the discounted price, customers <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "I'm not Herb" [...] while ordering. Customers named Herb were told to say, [...] "I'm not the Herb you're looking for".|$|E

I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> 'I'm collecting a frozen goat penis.' After that I said, 'I will never collect for you again.'"

[...] Hillenburg rejected it, saying [...] "it was too far over the edge." [...] Hutchins said, [...] "a lot of effort for something that lasts only 15 seconds on screen.

500|$|In 1985, Gene Roddenberry was {{the first}} {{television}} writer to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. When the Sci-Fi Channel was launched, the first broadcast was a dedication to two [...] "science fiction pioneers": Isaac Asimov and Roddenberry. The Roddenberry crater on Mars is named after him, as is the asteroid 4659 Roddenberry. Roddenberry and Star Trek have been cited as inspiration for other science fiction franchises, with George Lucas crediting the series for enabling Star Wars to be produced. J.
