5|$|In {{his early}} years with the Steelers, Greene was at times uncontrollable, and often let his temper <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> him. On one {{occasion}} during a 1975 game against the rival Cleveland Browns at Cleveland Municipal Stadium, Greene repeatedly kicked Browns lineman Bob McKay in the groin while McKay {{was lying on the}} ground. He also punched Denver Broncos guard Paul Howard and spat at quarterback Fran Tarkenton, and he frequently clashed with officials.|$|E
500|$|Minaj's [...] "Monster" [...] verse {{was listed}} by Complex {{as the best}} rap verse of the 2010s. West claimed {{at one point he}} {{considered}} deleting her verse from the track, because he was worried it would outshine his own work:It was like that moment when I thought about taking Nicki's verse off of [...] "Monster" [...] because I knew people would say that was the best verse on the best Hip Hop album of all time or arguably top ten albums of all time. And I would do all that work, eight months of work on [...] "Dark Fantasy" [...] and people to this day would say to me 'My favorite thing was Nicki Minaj's verse.' So if I let my ego <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> me instead of letting that girl get the shot to get that platform to be all she could be, I would take it off or marginalize her, try to stop her from having that shining moment… ...|$|E

500|$|... "Kill the Lights" [...] is {{an urban}} and dance-pop song that alludes to Spears {{conflict}} with the paparazzi, which is perceived in lines such as [...] "Mr. Photographer / I think I'm ready for my close-up / Tonight / Make sure you catch me from my good side". Jon Pareles of The New York Times said the song features [...] "amid electronic blips and ominous artificial strings and horns", while Spears [...] "alternately invites photographers closer and fends them off. 'They all wanna see', she warns prospective stars. 'Is life going to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> you?'". [...] "Kill the Lights" [...] features a similar theme to Spears' [...] "Piece of Me" [...] (2007) and was considered its sequel, while Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone said the song [...] "recalls the synth crush of 2007's Blackout." [...] Music critics criticized the fact that Spears is introduced by Danja as [...] "Our very own Pop princess / Now Queen of Pop", commenting that the honorific nickname [...] "Queen of Pop" [...] is attributed to American recording artist Madonna, while describing her vocals as heavily produced.|$|E
500|$|Jason Lipshutz of Billboard {{wrote that}} [...] "The Edge of Glory" [...] was [...] "risk-taking, [...] it's focused on romance rather than {{individual}} inspiration." [...] Lewis Corner of Digital Spy awarded the song with {{five out of}} five stars and wrote: [...] "Gaga belts over a chorus tastier and more filling than a meatball sub– stuffed with stadium-sized beats and massive techno synths; while the side of sax solo courtesy of the late Clarence Clemons is bound to seduce many a clubber into bringing out their rarely-used-nowadays air sax." [...] Kevin O'Donnell of Spin noted that in the song, Gaga [...] "goes back to basics". He also called the song a [...] "four-on-the-floor anthem with loads of references to '80s pop music" [...] and concluded [...] "Thankfully, 'Edge of Glory' proves Gaga hasn't let her global celebrity <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> her art, and she's still capable to cranking out straightforward, dance-ready jams like 'Just Dance' or 'Poker Face'." [...] Both Andy Gill of The Independent and James Reed of The Boston Globe praised Clarence Clemons' saxophone solo in [...] "The Edge of Glory".|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{it speaks}} about a love {{stronger}} than a gunshot, {{and according to}} Stacy-Ann Ellis of Vibe magazine it is a [...] "less violent version" [...] of Rihanna's 2011 single [...] "Man Down". Edmonton Journal Sandra Sperounes wrote that on [...] "No Love Allowed" [...] Rihanna plays with the Barbadian accent on {{the same way she}} did on her 2005 debut single [...] "Pon de Replay". According to a reviewer of Billboard, Rihanna's cry to the love police in the song, can be heard in the lines, [...] "Broken heart was the case / go'on and put him away / He's the only one one one / I let <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> me." [...] BBC Music's Natalie Shaw wrote that some of the song's lyrics like [...] "Like a bullet your love hit me to the core / I was flying ‘til you knocked me to the floor", are uncomfortably balanced between true love and awkward acrimony. According to Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly, the up stated lines [...] "doesn’t sound like she has forgiven" [...] Chris Brown for the 2009 domestic violence case.|$|E

500|$|She {{has played}} with Robyn Maher, Michelle Timms and Shelley Gorman. [...] Jackson admires them. [...] They all won bronze medals at the 1996 Summer Olympics. Jackson had a rivalry with American {{basketball}} player Lisa Leslie. [...] Both women dislike each other, a dislike {{that goes back}} to when Jackson was on tour in the United States with the Opals as a 16-year-old. The rivalry intensified in 2000 at the Olympics in the gold medal match when Jackson accidentally pulled off Leslie's hair extension when Jackson was trying to grab a rebound. [...] Jackson treated the incident as a joke, saying [...] "It was something to joke about even though we lost the gold medal." [...] Leslie did not {{feel the same way about}} the extension pulling incident. [...] The rivalry continued when Jackson transitioned to the WNBA and her Seattle Storm team played Leslie's Los Angeles Sparks, who at the time were the best team in the league. [...] The rivalry was so intense that their coaches had to coach around it, sometimes choosing to keep one off the floor when the other was on. [...] The coaches feared if they left the players on the floor together, their own player would foul out in an attempt to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> the other player. [...] Leslie and Jackson have played together as team members in the WNBA's All-Star game. [...] Their relationship thawed some by 2007 but they did not become friends.|$|E

2500|$|On {{his return}} to Paris he had become acquainted with Étienne Clavière, the Genevese exile, and a banker named Panchaud. From them he learnt about the abuse of stock-jobbing, and seizing their ideas he began to regard stock-jobbing, or {{agiotage}} (known in English as [...] "arbitrage"), {{as the source of}} all evil, and to attack in his usual vehement style the Banque de St-Charles and the Compagnie des Eaux. This pamphlet brought him into controversy with Pierre Beaumarchais, who certainly did not <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> it, but it lost him any chance of employment with the government.|$|E

2500|$|In {{his only}} other fight in 1994 Ferguson was matched with Larry Holmes, the 44-year-old former great {{who was on}} another {{comeback}} trail. Ferguson despite being out of shape had Holmes reeling in the second, and appeared to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> the ex-champ. Yet again Ferguson was {{on the wrong side}} of the points decision, and even the New York Times reported it as: [...] "A robbery. Larry Holmes came off second-best against Jesse Ferguson." [...] By 1995 Ferguson was frequently out of shape and made little effort in his fights. He had Jeremy Williams out on his feet but quit in the 7th with a swollen eye. He dropped Alex Stewart twice but was denied the decision. He did nothing against Danell Nicholson and pulled out after 8 rounds. In all three fights he looked distinctly uninterested.|$|E
2500|$|Her {{following}} effort, Klondike Annie (1936) dealt, as best {{it could}} given the heavy censorship, with religion and hypocrisy. Some critics called the film her screen masterpiece, {{but not everyone}} felt the same way. Press baron and would-be film mogul William Randolph Hearst, ostensibly offended by an offhanded remark West made about his mistress, Marion Davies, sent a private memo to all his editors stating, [...] "That Mae West picture 'Klondike Annie' is a filthy picture...We should have editorials roasting that picture, Mae West, and Paramount...DO NOT ACCEPT ANY ADVERTISING OF THIS PICTURE." [...] At one point, Hearst asked aloud, [...] "Isn't it time Congress did something about the Mae West menace?" [...] Paramount executives felt they had to tone down the West characterization, or face further recrimination. This may be surprising by today's standards, as West's films contained no nudity, no profanity, and very little violence. Though raised {{in an era when}} women held second-place roles in society, West portrayed confident women who were not afraid to use their sexual wiles to get what they wanted.
