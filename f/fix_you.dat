500|$|Lior Philips from Consequence of Sound found {{influences}} of Gaga's [...] "dance musicality" [...] in [...] "The Cure", {{especially in the}} [...] "finger clicking, pristine clean production, anthemic flute-like synth, and her remarkable falsetto". Comparing the track to songs by OneRepublic, Philips complimented {{the simplicity of the}} verses, writing that it [...] "intensifies the mood". Los Angeles Times writer Mikael Wood states that [...] "The Cure" [...] is [...] "an intriguing midtempo pop-soul jam", with [...] "synthetic textures", and [...] "very Madonna circa 'Human Nature'". Amy Mackelden of Marie Claire called it a [...] "synth-pop masterpiece that will be stuck in your head from the second you hear it" [...] and further wrote: [...] "The lyrics are super uplifting and relatable, especially as the chorus features the positive refrain, 'No matter what you know, I'll <b>fix</b> <b>you</b> with my love.'" [...] Ian Monroe from V praised the song for its lyrics and called it [...] "the song of the summer".|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{talks about the}} healing effect of love. In an article for Bustle, Danielle Jackson presumed it to be love from her fans who had {{supported}} Gaga throughout her career. While performing [...] "The Cure" [...] at 'Coachella', the singer said to the crowd: [...] "I love you guys so much. I have {{been through so much}} in my life and I've seen so much. And you cure me every time with your love." [...] The dedication-like lyrics begins with the singer comparing her music as an escape route for her fans. This is expanded upon in the chorus when Gaga belts [...] "If I can't find the cure, I'll, I'll <b>fix</b> <b>you</b> with my love", thus positioning herself as someone who advocates for the troubling time in anyone's life, evident by the closing line [...] "Promise I'll always be there, Promise I'll be the cure". Ally Hirschalg from Mic also found other explanations from the lyrics: a mother talking to her children and someone who had a recent break-up, the latter alluding to Gaga's break-up with fiancee Taylor Kinney the previous year.|$|E
