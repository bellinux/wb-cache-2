40|$|Early {{stages of}} {{infection}} by the mouse polyomavirus {{have been studied}} using HeLa cells stably expressing small interfering RNA to protein disulfide isomerase (PDI). <b>Infectibility</b> measured by nuclear T antigen expression was reduced commensurately with the degree of PDI downregulation. <b>Infectibility</b> was restored by transfection with a plasmid expressing PDI but not with a control expressing catalytically inactive enzyme. Deconvolution microscopy using fluorescently labeled virus and cellular markers showed that virus reaches the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) normally in cells with reduced PDI but subsequently fails to exit the ER. Simian virus 40 infection was not inhibited in PDI-downregulated cells.

40|$|Purpose: Treatment of aortoiliac {{prosthetic}} graft infections {{includes the}} removal of the infected material and repeat revascularization if necessary. The risk of infection of the graft material used for the repeat revascularization has been the drawback of its use in situ except with autografts. Good results were obtained in this setting by use of in situ arterial allografts. The purpose of our study was to compare in vivo the <b>infectibility</b> of arteries used as allografts to the <b>infectibility</b> of commercially available prostheses. Methods: Twelve dogs underwent thoracoabdominal aortic bypass with use of either an artery from a human being (n= 6) or an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) graft (n= 6). One month later, bacteremia was produced with Staphylococcus aureus. One week after bacterial challenge, the animals were killed to recover the grafts. Each graft then underwent bacterial study. Results: None of the arterial grafts grew bacteria, whereas four of the six ePTFE grafts (P< 0. 05) did. In addition, none of the fragments of the arterial grafts grew bacteria, whereas 24 of the 60 ePTFE fragments (P< 0. 01) did. Conclusion: Nonautologous arteries are less infectible than ePTFE in vivo. This decreased <b>infectibility</b> makes the arterial allograft an appealing material when revascularization must be performed in a contaminated field...|$|E

Tsai et al., EMBO J. 22 : 4346 - 4355, 2003; Gilbert and Benjamin, in press). These studies {{were carried out}} with C 6 rat glioma cells, a heterologous host chosen for its known deficiency in ganglioside biosynthesis. Here, a cell genetic approach was undertaken to identify components required for the early steps of infection using mouse cells as the natural host for Py. Receptor-negative (R−) mouse cells, screened based on resistance to Py infection, were shown to bind Py but failed to allow entry of the virus. R− cells were also found to be resistant to SV 40. <b>Infectibility</b> was restored or enhanced by the addition of the same specific gangliosides found in earlier studies with C 6 cells. In one R− line, overexpression of caveolin- 1 also increased <b>infectibility.</b> These results support and extend findings on gangliosides in lipid rafts as functional receptors and mediators of internalization for Py and SV 40...|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{analyzed}} parameters influencing HIV- 1 <b>infectibility</b> {{of cells}} of the monocyte/macrophage lineage (MO/MAC) isolated from different healthy donors. The proportion of in vitro-infected cells and replication kinetics in different donor MAC ranged from 0. 03 to 99 % p 24 antigen-positive MAC and from undetectable RT activity up to 5 × 106 cpm/ml/ 90 min, respectively. As a quantitative measurement for HIV- 1 susceptibility of donor MO/MAC, we determined TCID 50 values of defined virus stocks which varied up to 3000 -fold depending on the donor MAC used for titration. As host factors which may influence the viral infection we determined the expression of virus receptors CD 4, CCR 5, CXCR 4, and CCR 3 {{as well as the}} secretion of the natural ligands of CCR 5, which altogether showed no correlation with HIV- 1 <b>infectibility</b> of the cells. Moreover, other MO-derived secretory factors which might affect viral infection of these cells could be excluded. Furthermore, expression of maturation-related antigens CD 14, CD 16, HLA-DR, and MAX. 1 /CPM was determined. Analysis of the reverse transcription process revealed that restricted HIV- 1 infection was reflected by highly reduced or even undetectable full-length HIV- 1 DNA formation, although early and intermediate transcripts appeared, suggesting that viral replication is blocked after entry at the level of early reverse transcription...|$|E

40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1), the retrovirus responsible for {{acquired immunodeficiency syndrome}} (AIDS), contains two heavily glycosylated envelope proteins, gp 120 and gp 41, which mediate attachment of virions to glycosylated cell surface receptor molecules (CD 4 antigens) and appear {{to be responsible for}} syncytium formation and associated cytopathic effects of this virus. A comprehensive study of the effects of N-linked glycoprotein processing inhibitors on HIV- 1 replication, infectivity, cytopathicity, target-cell <b>infectibility,</b> syncytium formation, and gp 120 electrophoretic mobility was conducted to assess the importance of protein glycosylation in the pathogenesis of HIV- 1 in vitro. The electrophoretic mobility of gp 120 was decreased when gp 120 was synthesized in the presence of castanospermine or 1 -deoxynojirimycin (inhibitors of glucosidase I), increased when gp 120 was synthesized in the presence of 1 -deoxymannojirimycin (mannosidase I) or swainsonine (mannosidase II), and unaffected when gp 120 was synthesized in the presence of bromoconduritol (glucosidase II). Inhibition by tunicamycin (lipid-linked oligosaccharide precursor synthesis), castanospermine, 1 -deoxynojirimycin, and 1 -deoxymannojirimycin attenuated HIV- 1 infectivity and blocked HIV- 1 -induced syncytium formation and cytopathicity, whereas bromoconduritol and swainsonine failed to have such effects. None of the inhibitors interfered with virus replication in acutely infected cells or affected the ability of target cells to form syncytia with untreated HIV- 1 -infected cells. These results demonstrate that protein N-glycosylation is critical to the pathogenesis of HIV- 1 at the levels of viral infectivity and cytopathicity but not at the level of virus replication or of host-cell <b>infectibility...</b>|$|E

A first-in-Phase 1 assessment of preliminary pharmacodynamics was included by measuring changes in ex vivo HIV- 1 suppression in rectal biopsy tissue after exposure to product in vivo. Methods: HIV- 1 seronegative, sexually-abstinent men and women (N = 36) were randomized in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing UC 781 gel at two concentrations (0. 1 %, 0. 25 %) with placebo gel (1 : 1 : 1).

40|$|Adenovirus (Ad) gene {{transfer}} vectors {{can be used}} to transfer and express antigens and function as strong adjuvants and thus are useful platforms for the development of genetic vaccines. Based on the hypothesis that Ad vectors with enhanced <b>infectibility</b> of dendritic cells (DC) may be able to evoke enhanced immune responses against antigens encoded by the vector in vivo, the present study analyzes the vaccine potential of an Ad vector expressing β-galactosidase as a model antigen and genetically modified with RGD on the fiber knob [AdZ. F(RGD) ] to more selectively infect DC and consequently enhance immunity against the β-galactosidase antigen. Infection of murine DC in vitro with AdZ. F(RGD) showed an eightfold-increased transgene expression following infection compared to AdZ (also expressing β-galactosidase, but with a wild-type capsid). Binding, cellular uptake, and trafficking in DC were also increased with AdZ. F(RGD) compared to AdZ. To determine whether AdZ. F(RGD) could evoke enhanced immune responses to β-galactosidase in vivo, C 57 BL/ 6 mice were immunized with AdZ. F(RGD) or AdZ subcutaneously via the footpad. Humoral responses with both vectors were comparable, with similar anti-β-galactosidase antibody levels following vector administration. However, cellular responses to β-galactosidase were significantly enhanced, with the frequency of CD 4 + as well as the CD 8 + β-galactosidase-specific gamma interferon response in cells isolated from the draining lymph nodes increased following immunization with AdZ. F(RGD) compared to Ad. Z (P < 0. 01). Importantly, this enhanced cellular immune response of the AdZ. F(RGD) vector was sufficient to evoke enhanced inhibition of the growth of preexisting tumors expressing β-galactosidase: BALB/c mice implanted with the CT 26 syngeneic β-galactosidase-expressing colon carcinoma cell line and subsequently immunized with AdZ. F(RGD) showed decreased tumor growth and improved survival compared to mice immunized with AdZ. These data demonstrate that addition of an RGD motif to the Ad fiber knob increases the <b>infectibility</b> of DC and leads to enhanced cellular immune responses to the Ad-transferred transgene, suggesting that the RGD capsid modification may be useful in developing Ad-based vaccines...|$|E

CLOS action caused a threefold increase in the differentiation of root epidermal cells into root hairs. At maturity, root hairs were significantly longer because of an extended period of active elongation without a change in the elongation rate itself.

Further studies showed several newly described infection-related root hair responses to CLOSs, including the localized disruption of the normal crystallinity in cell wall architecture and the induction of new infection sites. The application of CLOS also enabled a NodC- mutant of R. leguminosarum bv. trifolii to progress further in the infection process by inducing bright refractile spot modifications of the deformed root hair walls.

Results: Tumor uptake was 83 % to 100 % in the subcutaneous model and 60 % to 100 % in the orthotopical mouse model, except for Hs- 766 T cells, which did not grow orthotopically. Pathohistological analyses of the orthotopical models revealed an infiltrative growth of almost all tumors into the pancreas; however, the different cell lines gave rise to tumors with different morphological characteristics. All of the resultant tumors were positive for MUC- 1 staining indicating their origin from glandular or ductal epithelium, but revealed scattered pan-cytokeratin staining. Transfer of the cytochrome P 450 and cytosine deaminase suicide gene, respectively, into the pancreatic cancer cell lines using retroviral vector technology revealed high level <b>infectibility</b> of these cell lines and allowed the analysis of the sensitivity of these cells to th...|$|E
40|$|Apart from lymphocytes, {{mononuclear}} phagocytes play {{an essential}} role as target cells for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Circulating blood monocytes (MOs) and tissue macrophages (M phi) may harbor and distribute the virus throughout the body. In addition, proinflammatory monokines [interleukin- 1 (IL- 1), IL- 6, IL- 8, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) ] {{may contribute to the}} pathogenesis of HIV-mediated diseases. We have established a culture system on hydrophobic Teflon membranes for blood-borne MOs/M phi. Both freshly isolated MOs as well as MO-derived M phi could be infected with a monocytotropic HIV- 1 isolate (HIV- 1 D 117 III) derived from a perinatally infected child. The virus production monitored by assay for viral antigen in cell-free supernatant is continuous for several weeks. We analyzed the stimulus response and the secretory repertoire of MOs/M phi early after infection with HIV as well as in long-term cultured, virus-replicating cells. Infected MOs/M phi respond to interferon-gamma more effectively than control cells as estimated from the release of neopterin. The response to lipopolysaccharide was regulated differently: whereas the proinflammatory cytokines IL- 1, IL- 6, IL- 8 and TNF-alpha were up-regulated and even constitutively secreted upon infection, the production of the hematopoietin macrophage-colony-stimulating factor decreased. High levels of TNF-alpha and IL- 1 might augment the <b>infectibility</b> of M phi by HIV in an autocrine manner. Our results may provide some explanation for the immunologic dysfunction, the hematopoietic failure and the chronic inflammatory disease occurring in HIV-infected patients...|$|E
40|$|Four {{classes of}} {{murine leukemia virus}} (MuLV) which display {{distinct}} cellular tropisms and bind to different retrovirus receptors to initiate virus infection have been described. In the present study, we describe a rapid, sensitive immunofluorescence assay useful for characterizing the initial binding of MuLV to cells. By using the rat monoclonal antibody 83 A 25 (L. H. Evans, R. P. Morrison, F. G. Malik, J. Portis, and W. J. Britt, J. Virol. 64 : 6176 - 6183, 1990), which recognizes an epitope of the envelope gp 70 molecule common to the different classes of MuLV, {{it is possible to}} analyse the binding of ecotropic, amphotropic, or xenotropic MuLV by using only a single combination of primary and secondary antibodies. The MuLV binding detected by this assay is envelope receptor specific and matches the susceptibility to infection determined for cells from a variety of species. The binding of amphotropic MuLV to NIH 3 T 3 cells was shown to be rapid, saturable, and temperature dependent. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K 1) cells normally lack the ability to bind ecotropic virus and are not infectible by ecotropic vectors. Expression of the cloned ecotropic retrovirus receptor gene (Rec) in CHO-K 1 cells confers high levels of ecotropic virus-specific binding and confers susceptibility to infection. Characterization of MuLV binding to primary cells may provide insight into the <b>infectibility</b> of cells by retroviruses and aid in the selection of appropriate vectors for gene transfer experiments...|$|E
40|$|The human CCR 5 {{chemokine}} receptor {{functions as}} a coreceptor with CD 4 for infection by macrophage-tropic isolates of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1). A mutated CCR 5 allele which encodes a protein that does not function as a coreceptor for HIV- 1 has been identified. Thus, expression of the wild-type and/or mutation allele is relevant to determining the <b>infectibility</b> of patient {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMC) and affects disease progression in vivo. We developed a qualitative CCR 5 genotyping assay using NASBA, an isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology. The method involves three enzymes and two oligonucleotides and targets the CCR 5 mRNA, which is expressed in PBMC at a copy number higher than 2, the number of copies of DNA present encoding the gene. The single oligonucleotide set amplifies both alleles, and genotyping is achieved by separate hybridizations of wild-type- and mutation-specific probes directly to the single-stranded RNA amplification product. Assay sensitivity and specificity were demonstrated with RNAs produced in vitro from plasmid clones bearing the DNA encoding each allele. No detectable cross-reactivity between wild-type and mutation probes was found, and 50 copies of each allele were readily detectable. Analysis of patient samples found that 20 % were heterozygous and 1 % were homozygous for the CCR 5 mutation. Thus, NASBA is a sensitive and specific means of rapidly determining CCR 5 genotype and provides several technical advantages over alternative assay systems...|$|E
40|$|The {{recently}} established human monocytic {{cell line}} Mono Mac 6 expressing distinct characteristics of mature monocytes/macrophages was tested for its susceptibility to infection with human immunodeficiency virus. Inoculation {{of the cells}} with the T-cell-tropic human immunodeficiency virus strains human T-lymphotropic virus type IIIB and lymphadenopathy-associated virus type 2 led to a noncytopathic productive infection becoming apparent only after a latency period of up to 56 days. The <b>infectibility</b> of the Mono Mac 6 cells was dependent on low levels of CD 4 expression, as demonstrated by blocking experiments with various CD 4 -specific antibodies. Increasing with time after infection (greater than 200 days), the cultured Mono Mac 6 cells released virus variants which showed shortened latency periods when passaged onto uninfected Mono Mac 6 cells. Also, cytopathogenicity for several CD 4 + T cells of the Mono Mac 6 -derived virus was drastically increased; thus, the infection of the H 9 cell line with low doses of virus (less than 0. 1 50 % tissue culture infective dose per cell) led to giant syncytium formation within 1 day and subsequent death of all fused cells. We propose Mono Mac 6 cells as a new model {{for the study of}} human immunodeficiency virus infecting the monocyte/macrophage lineage, particularly with regard to virus-host cell interaction and the influence of cell differentiation and activation on latency and development of virulence. The human immunodeficiency virus-infected Mono Mac 6 cell may also serve as a valuable tool for in vitro testing of antiviral therapies...|$|E

In this study, we tested the sensitivity to HIV 1 infection of in vitro generated LC throughout their differentiation and we investigated the effect of such an infection on in vitro differentiation. Phenotypic controls were performed using FACS analysis on day 6 for the presence of a CD 1 a+ cell population, and differentiation was assessed by transmission electron microscopy on day 13 for the presence of Birbeck granules. CD 34 + cells were purified from cord blood mononuclear cells by magnetic separation. Cell suspensions were infected with either a T-lymphotropic, syncytium-inducing isolate (HXB 2) or a macrophage-tropic, non-syncytium-inducing isolate (Ba-L). Viral particle release was measured by p 24 antigen production in the culture supernatant. A high level of p 24 production was noted on day 13 of postinfection only when infection was carried out with Ba-L isolate on cells generated after 6 days in culture with GM/CSF+TNF alpha. No infection of CD 34 + progenitor cells was obtained either with Ba-L isolate or HXB 2. The sensitivity of Langerhans cell/dendritic cell (LC/DC) precursors to NSI isolate (Ba-L) seemed to coincide with the early stage of differentiation (CD 1 a antigen appearance). The infection did not alter the differentiation of in vitro generated LC, which presented their specific ultrastructural marker of epidermal environment, i. e.

40|$|One of the {{objectives}} in adenovirus (Ad) vector development is to target gene delivery to specific cell types. Major {{attention has been given}} to modification of the Ad fiber knob, which is thought to determine virus tropism. However, among the human Ad serotypes with different tissue tropisms, not only the knob but also the length of the fiber shaft domain varies significantly. In this study we attempted to delineate the role of fiber length in coxsackievirus-adenovirus receptor (CAR) - and non-CAR-mediated infection. A series of Ad serotype 5 (Ad 5) capsid-based vectors containing long or short fibers with knob domains derived from Ad 5, Ad 9, or Ad 35 was constructed and tested in adsorption, internalization, and transduction studies. For Ad 5 or Ad 9 knob-possessing vectors, a long-shafted fiber was critical for efficient adsorption/internalization and transduction of CAR/αv integrin-expressing cells. Ad 5 capids containing short CAR-recognizing fibers were affected in cell adsorption and infection. In contrast, for the chimeric vectors possessing Ad 35 knobs, which enter cells by a CAR/αv integrin-independent pathway, fiber shaft length had no significant influence on binding or <b>infectibility</b> on tested cells. The weak attachment of short-shafted Ad 5 or Ad 9 knob-possessing vectors seems to be causally associated with a charge-dependent repulsion between Ad 5 capsid and acidic cell surface proteins. The differences between short- and long-shafted vectors in attachment or infection were abrogated by preincubation of cells with polycations. This study demonstrates that the fiber-CAR interaction is not the sole determinant for tropism of Ad vectors containing chimeric fibers. CAR- and αv integrin-mediated infections are influenced by other factors, including the length of the fiber shaft...|$|E

The {{purpose of this paper is}} to review the literature and evaluate the data which bears on the question of racial differences in susceptibility to tuberculosis. Materials and Methods: Systematic review of peer reviewed studies identified through Medline. The search was restricted to articles published in English. The references of the identified papers for further relevant publications were also reviewed. Results: For the review, 31 papers were eligible from 417 identified in the search. The {{prevalence of}} TB among black skin people was 81. 5 % and 18. 5 % in white skin people. The black subjects demonstrated higher frequency of the Fok 1 E 2 -C 4 T F allele, Bsm 1 E 8 -G-+ 284 A- B allele, APa 1 e 9 -T- 48 G- a allele, and Taq 1 E 9 -T- 32 C- t allele and marked differences in IL- 6, IL- 10, TNF-α, TGF-β, and IFN-γ than white subject. There were no significant differences in MCP- 1 2518 A, G allele between black and white subjects. White subjects tended to have borderline significantly higher mean serum of vitamin D (58. 4 nmol/l) than black subjects (37. 7 nmol/l). The capacities of skin to synthesize vitamin D Post-UVB were significantly higher in whites than in black subjects. Conclusions: Black skin people had consistently higher susceptibility to infection by M. tuberculosis than are whites skin peoples.

40|$|The infectible {{cells of}} soybean roots {{appear to be}} located {{at any given time}} just above the zone of root {{elongation}} and just below the position of the smallest emergent root hairs. The location of infectible cells on the primary root at the time of inoculation was inferred from the position of subsequent nodule development, correcting for displacement of epidermal cells due to root elongation. Marks were made on the seedling growth pouches at the time of inoculation to indicate the position of the root tip and the zones of root hair development. Virtually all of the seedlings developed nodules on the primary root above the marks made at the root tips at the time of inoculation. None of the plants formed nodules on the root where mature root hairs were present at the time of inoculation. These results and profiles of nodulation frequency indicate that the location of infectible cells is developmentally restricted. When inoculations were delayed for intervals of 1 to 4 hours after marking the positions of the root tips, progressively fewer nodules were formed above the root tip marks, and the uppermost of these nodules were formed at progressively shorter distances above the marks. These results indicate that the <b>infectibility</b> of given host cells is a transient property that appears and then is lost within a few hours. The results also indicate that host responses leading to infection and nodulation are triggered or initiated in less than 2 hours after inoculation. The extent of nodulation above the root tip mark increased in proportion to the logarithm of the number of bacteria in the inoculum...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Recombinant adenoviruses are {{employed}} {{to deliver a}} therapeutic transgene in the liver, muscle or tumour tissue. However, to rationalise this delivery approach, the factors of variation between individuals need to be identified. It is assumed that differences between inbred strains of laboratory animals are considered to reflect differences between patients. Previously we showed that transgene expression in the liver of different rat strains was dependent on the transcription efficiency of the transgene. In the present paper we investigated if transfection of muscle and tumour tissue were also subject to such variations. Methods Variation, in transgene expression, after intramuscular gene delivery was determined in different rodent strains and gene expression in tumours was investigated in different human and rodent cell lines {{as well as in}} subcutaneously implanted rodent tumours. The molecular mechanisms involved in transgene expression were dissected using an adenovirus encoding luciferase. The luciferase activity, the viral DNA copies and the luciferase transcripts were assessed in cultured cells {{as well as in the}} tissues. Results Large differences of luciferase activity, up to 2 logs, were observed between different rodent strains after intramuscular injection of Ad Luciferase. This inter-strain variation of transgene expression was due to a difference in transcription efficiency. The transgene expression level in tumour cell lines of different tissue origin could be explained largely by the difference of <b>infectibility</b> to the adenovirus. In contrast, the main step responsible for luciferase activity variation, between six human breast cancer cell lines with similar phenotype, was at the transcriptional level. Conclusion Difference in transcriptional efficiency in muscles as observed between different inbred strains and between human breast cancer cell lines may be expected to occur between individual patients. This might have important consequences for clinical gene therapy. The variation between tumour types and tissues within a species are mainly at the levels of infectivity. </p...|$|E
40|$|Human T-cell leukemia virus type I {{and type}} II (HTLV-I and HTLV-II, respectively) infect certain sublines of the BJAB human B-cell line. We {{observed}} that the WH subline, but not the CC/ 84 subline, of BJAB cells were infectible by cell-free HTLV-I or HTLV-II and formed syncytia with cells infected by these retroviruses. This suggests that the BJAB-CC/ 84 cells possibly lack a membrane molecule(s) important for syncytium formation and <b>infectibility.</b> In order to identify this antigen, we generated polyclonal anti-BJAB-WH antisera which were adsorbed on BJAB-CC/ 84 cells. The adsorbed antisera bound only BJAB-WH and BJAB-CC/ 79 cells as demonstrated by complement-dependent cytotoxicity and flow cytometric assays. Furthermore, this adsorbed antisera bound several human T-cell clones, including SupT- 1, as determined by flow cytometric assays. The adsorbed antiserum was monospecific as it immunoprecipitated only one 78 - to 80 -kDa protein from lysates of metabolically labeled BJAB-WH, BJAB-CC/ 79, and SupT- 1, but not BJAB-CC/ 84, cells. The monospecific antisera detected a glycoprotein composed of a 64 - to 66 -kDa core protein containing tunicamycin-sensitive N-linked oligosaccharides. This membrane glycoprotein appears {{to be involved in}} HTLV-I- and HTLV-II-induced fusion and infection, as the monospecific antisera were capable of inhibiting both of these processes. The monospecific antisera diluted 1 : 50 and 1 : 90 inhibited 85 to 90 % of syncytium formation induced in BJAB-WH, BJAB-CC/ 79, and SupT- 1 cells cultured with HTLV-I- or HTLV-II-infected MT 2, MoT, or FLW human T- or B-cell lines. At the same dilution, antisera inhibited 70 to 80 % of infection of BJAB-WH cells by cell-free HTLV-I or HTLV-II.

Phase 1, randomized, two-site (US), double-blind, placebo-controlled study of sexually-abstinent males and females. Eighteen participants received a single 300 mg exposure of oral TDF and were then randomized 2 ∶ 1 to receive a single then seven-daily rectal exposures of TFV 1 % gel (40 mg TFV per 4 ml gel application) or hydroxyethyl-cellulose (HEC) placebo gel. Blood and rectal biopsies were collected for pharmacokinetic TDF and TFVdp analyses and ex vivo HIV- 1 challenge. There was a significant fit for the TFVdp dose-response model for rectal tissue (p =  0. 0004), CD 4 +MMC (p< 0. 0001), CD 4 -MMC (p< 0. 0001), and TotalMMC (p< 0. 0001) compartments with r 2 ranging 0. 36 - 0. 64. Higher concentrations of TFVdp corresponded with lower p 24, consistent with drug-mediated virus suppression. The single oral treatment failed to provide adequate compartment drug exposure to reach the EC 50 of rectal tissue TFVdp predicted to be necessary to suppress HIV in rectal tissue. The EC 50 for CD 4 +MMC was within the single topical treatment range, providing evidence that a 1 % topical, vaginally-formulated TFV gel provided in-vivo doses predicted to provide for 50 % efficacy in the ex vivo assay. The 7 -daily topical TFV gel treatment provided TFVdp concentrations that reached EC 90 biopsy efficacy for CD 4 -MMC, CD 4 +MMC and TotalMMC compartments. The TFVdp MMC compartment (CD 4 +, CD 4 - and Total) provided the best surrogate for biopsy <b>infectibility</b> and the 7 -daily topical TFV gel treatment provided the strongest PK profile for HIV suppression.
