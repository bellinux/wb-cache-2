Recently, attention is also focussed on surfaces of <b>hot</b> <b>strips</b> and bars/rods. A large variety of techniques, both in spatial and frequency domains, have been applied for defect detection. Often, combination of several techniques has provided useful results. With respect to defect classification, some form of neural network or support vector machine-based techniques {{have been found to be}} of use. Real-time operation of automated inspection system often demands very fast processing of images as mill speed is generally very high for flat and long steel products. This calls for dedicated hardware system with parallel processing capability for each camera.|$|R
30|$|Caleb and Steuer [36] is an {{interesting}} paper where experiments were conducted on relative performance of multilayer perceptron (MLP) and group method of data handling (GMDH) with same set of five classes of defects and non-defect in <b>hot</b> <b>strips.</b> Classifiers were constructed to segregate i) defects as a class from non-defects, ii) all six classes and iii) five classes of defects within themselves. MLP consistently provided better result than GMDH. Within three sets of trials, best result from MLP was obtained (97 %/ 93 % for training/test set) during classification of defects from non-defects. For classification between five defect classes, accuracy reduced to 89 % and 78 %, respectively, for training and test sets and further to 86 % and 80 % for all six classes. It is suggested that simple problem decomposition on a class level would involve cascading two networks, the first network separating regions on defects/non-defect basis and the second only dealing with the cases classified as defects by the first.|$|R

30|$|Steel is the {{material}} of choice for a large number and very diverse industrial applications. Surface qualities along with other properties {{are the most important}} quality parameters, particularly for flat-rolled steel products. Traditional manual surface inspection procedures are awfully inadequate to ensure guaranteed quality-free surface. To ensure stringent requirements of customers, automated vision-based steel surface inspection techniques {{have been found to be}} very effective and popular during the last two decades. Considering its importance, this paper attempts to make the first formal review of state-of-art of vision-based defect detection and classification of steel surfaces as they are produced from steel mills. It is observed that majority of research work has been undertaken for cold steel strip surfaces which is most sensitive to customers' requirements. Work on surface defect detection of <b>hot</b> <b>strips</b> and bars/rods has also shown signs of increase during the last 10  years. The review covers overall aspects of automatic steel surface defect detection and classification systems using vision-based techniques. Attentions have also been drawn to reported success rates along with issues related to real-time operational aspects.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Temperature {{evolution}} {{is one of}} the important parameters of mechanical properties of thin strip products. So the ability of prediction of temperature history before processing is critical to the processing scheme of controlling rolling and controlling cooling. In this paper an integrate model of finite element method is presented for the prediction of the temperature evolution in the finishing rolling during <b>hot</b> <b>strips.</b> The model takes into account the interaction between thermal behavior and mechanical behaviors. By using the second-development method based on the commercial code thermal behavior and temperature distribution of strips through seven-pass finishing rolling are described in detail. A method for computing the mean temperature at the exit of each pass is approached. Using this method the mean temperature can be attained after each pass. In one seven-pass thin strip rolling mills the temperature at the exit after each pass is measured by the pyrometer. The measured results and the simulation results are compared. The validity of the proposed analysis model is examined. The computing results are in agreement with the measured results...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports a}} new design of optofluidic tunable lens using a laser-induced thermal gradient. It {{makes use of}} two {{straight}} chromium strips {{at the bottom of}} the microfluidic chamber to absorb the continuous pump laser to heat up the moving benzyl alcohol solution, creating a 2 D refractive index gradient in the entrance part between the two <b>hot</b> <b>strips.</b> This design can be regarded as a cascade of a series of refractive lenses, and is distinctively different from the reported liquid lenses that mimic the refractive lens design and the 1 D gradient index lens design. CFD simulation shows that a stable thermal lens can be built up within 200 ms. Experiments were conducted to demonstrate the continuous tuning of focal length from initially infinite to the minimum 1. 3 mm, as well as the off-axis focusing by offsetting the pump laser spot. Data analyses show the empirical dependences of the focal length on the pump laser intensity and the flow velocity. Compared with previous studies, this tunable lens design enjoys many merits, such as fast tuning speed, aberration-free focusing, remote control, and enabling the use of homogeneous fluids for easy integration with other optofluidic systems.

The system was installed in the seven-stand hot-strip mill of voestalpine´s steel plant in Linz / Austria in 1997. It is able to predict the mechanical properties {{as well as the}} thickness and composition of the scale layer of the <b>hot</b> rolled <b>strip</b> immediately after cooling and downcoiling A simulation of all process-steps such as austenitization during reheating of the slab and dissolution of the micro-alloying elements in the reheating furnace, deformation, recrystallization and grain growth processes in the austenite, precipitation during roughing and finishing as well as phasetransformation and precipitation in the cooling line and during cooling of the coil down to room temperature is performed. The results of the pre-calculation after roughing based on the up stream parameters are used for a fully automatic in-line control of the production in the finishing mill. If the material is subjected to stretchlevelling in subsequent process-steps such as pickling the elongation caused by the stretch levelling unit is also taken into account for the prediction of the mechanical properties. The results of the calculated values are compared with the mechanical properties obtained by tensile testing. Operational experience with the CAQCsystem will be presented in the paper. 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{environmental effects}} on evolution of cluster galaxies under hierarchical structure formation scenario using {{combination of a}} dissipationless $N$-body simulation and a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation. The $N$-body simulation enables us to calculate orbits of galaxies in simulated clusters. Therefore we can include stripping of cold gas from the galactic disks by ram pressure from an ICM in our model. In this paper we consider galaxy mergers, <b>stripping</b> of diffuse <b>hot</b> gas from galactic halos as they infall into larger virialized objects, and ram-pressure stripping of cold gas from galactic disks. We find that observed color and star formation gradients in galaxy clusters are explained by the <b>hot</b> gas <b>stripping</b> as previous work has shown. Since the <b>hot</b> gas <b>stripping</b> sufficiently suppress star formation in clusters, the ram-pressure stripping of cold gas hardly affects the global properties of the cluster galaxies. We also examine whether the ram-pressure stripping can resolve the problem that the simulated clusters contain too few galaxies with intermediate bulge-to-disk ratio under the hierarchical galaxy formation. We, however, find that the ram-pressure stripping gives little change in morphologies of the cluster galaxies. It suggests that the additional processes other than major mergers and ram-pressure stripping, which affect the morphological evolution of disk-dominated galaxies, should be considered to reproduce the observed intermediate population in clusters...|$|R
