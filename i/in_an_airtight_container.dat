25|$|Leftover {{decorated}} pavlova can be refrigerated overnight, but {{the dessert}} will absorb moisture and lose its crispness. Undecorated pavlova {{can be left}} overnight in the oven, or for several days <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> <b>container,</b> to be decorated when ready.|$|E
25|$|Coffee is best stored <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> <b>container</b> made of ceramic, glass, or {{non-reactive}} metal. Higher quality prepackaged coffee {{usually has}} a one-way valve which prevents air from entering while allowing the coffee to release gases. Coffee freshness and flavor is preserved {{when it is}} stored away from moisture, heat, and light. The ability of coffee to absorb strong smells from food means {{that it should be}} kept away from such smells. Storage of coffee in the refrigerator is not recommended due to the presence of moisture which can cause deterioration. Exterior walls of buildings which face the sun may heat the interior of a home, and this heat may damage coffee stored near such a wall. Heat from nearby ovens also harms stored coffee.|$|E
25|$|The {{storage of}} pasta {{depends on how}} far along it is processed. Uncooked pasta is kept dry and can sit in the {{cupboard}} for a year if airtight and stored in a cool, dry area. Cooked pasta is stored {{in the refrigerator for}} a maximum of five days <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> <b>container.</b> Adding a couple teaspoons of oil helps keep the food from sticking to itself and the container. If the cooked pasta is not used in the five days it may be frozen for up to two or three months. The pasta will start to dry after a period of time, but it varies with the type of pasta. Should the pasta be dried completely, it can be placed back in the cupboard.|$|E
2500|$|Hemp oil oxidizes {{and turns}} rancid {{within a short}} period of time if not stored properly; [...] its shelf life is {{extended}} when stored <b>in</b> <b>a</b> dark <b>airtight</b> <b>container</b> and refrigerated.|$|R
2500|$|Save {{the tick}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> small <b>airtight</b> <b>container</b> with moist paper or a leaf or blade of grass. Label {{with the date}} removed and the {{locality}} where the tick was acquired. The tick can be identified later if you develop illness, especially in the following 4 weeks. (Note that an engorged female will deposit eggs {{within a few weeks}} and these will hatch into thousands of larvae which can escape the container if not properly sealed.) ...|$|R
50|$|The factory on Sturt Street, between Russell and Norman streets, was by 1875 {{turning out}} 30 tons of soap and 6 tons of candles per week. The process of boiling down fat and tallow {{produces}} some particularly foul odours, and Tidmarsh was diligent in reducing this nuisance {{to a minimum}} by ventilating the vats through charcoal or quicklime. The lees were transported away from the factory <b>in</b> <b>a</b> large <b>airtight</b> <b>container</b> on wheels, to be dumped at some remote location.|$|R
25|$|Being a {{phosphate}} mineral, turquoise {{is inherently}} fragile and sensitive to solvents; perfume and other cosmetics will attack the finish and may alter the colour of turquoise gems, as will skin oils, as will most commercial jewellery cleaning fluids. Prolonged exposure to direct sunlight may also discolour or dehydrate turquoise. Care {{should therefore be}} taken when wearing such jewels: cosmetics, including sunscreen and hair spray, should be applied before putting on turquoise jewellery, and {{they should not be}} worn to a beach or other sun-bathed environment. After use, turquoise should be gently cleaned with a soft cloth to avoid a buildup of residue, and should be stored in its own container to avoid scratching by harder gems. Turquoise can also be adversely affected if stored <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> <b>container.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Quality {{gasoline}} {{should be}} stable {{for six months}} if stored properly but gasoline will break down slowly over time due to {{the separation of the}} components. Gasoline stored for a year will most likely be able to be burned in an internal combustion engine without too much trouble but the effects of long term storage will become more noticeable with each passing month until a time comes when the gasoline should be diluted with ever-increasing amounts of freshly made fuel so that the older gasoline may be used up. If left undiluted, improper operation will occur and this may include engine damage from misfiring and/or the lack of proper action of the fuel within a fuel injection system and from an onboard computer attempting to compensate (if applicable to the vehicle). Storage should be <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> <b>container</b> (to prevent oxidation or water vapors mixing in with the gas) that can withstand the vapor pressure of the gasoline without venting (to prevent the loss of the more volatile fractions) at a stable cool temperature (to reduce the excess pressure from liquid expansion, and to reduce the rate of any decomposition reactions). When gasoline is not stored correctly, gums and solids may be created, which can corrode system components and accumulate on wetted surfaces, resulting in a condition called [...] "stale fuel". Gasoline containing ethanol is especially subject to absorbing atmospheric moisture, then forming gums, solids, or two phases (a hydrocarbon phase floating on top of a water-alcohol phase).|$|E
50|$|Solder paste must {{be transported}} while {{refrigerated}} and stored <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> <b>container</b> at a temperature between 0-10°C. It should be warmed {{to room temperature}} for use.|$|E
5000|$|Cannabis {{is fully}} dry for [...] "curing" [...] when the {{moisture}} level reaches 55%-62% RH. A {{simple way to}} check this is by closing the cannabis up <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> glass <b>container</b> with <b>a</b> hygrometer. The container is stored for 12 hours at 22 °C (72 °F) and the hygrometer checked. 62% and above readings mean the jar needs to be opened {{for a few hours}} and then closed up, to allow more moisture to escape. The jar is again checked after 12 hours and the process repeated until a steady 55% is reached.|$|R
2500|$|UHT, {{also known}} as ultra-heat-treating, {{processing}} holds the milk at a temperature of 140°C (284°F) for four seconds. During UHT processing milk is sterilized and not pasteurized. This process lets consumers store milk or juice for several months without refrigeration. The process is achieved by spraying the milk or juice through a nozzle into a chamber filled with high-temperature steam under pressure. [...] After the temperature reaches 140°C the fluid is cooled instantly <b>in</b> <b>a</b> vacuum chamber, and packed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> pre-sterilized <b>airtight</b> <b>container.</b> Milk labeled [...] "ultra-pasteurized" [...] or simply [...] "UHT" [...] has been treated with the UHT method.|$|R
50|$|Brined cheese, also {{sometimes}} referred to as pickled cheese for some varieties, is cheese that is matured <b>in</b> <b>a</b> solution of brine <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> or semi-permeable <b>container.</b> This process gives the cheese good stability, inhibiting bacterial growth even in warmer climates. Brined cheeses may be soft or hard, varying in moisture content, and in colour and flavour, according to the type of milk used; though all will be rindless, and generally taste clean, salty and acidic when fresh, developing some piquancy when aged, and most will be white.|$|R

50|$|Steel-ground yellow cornmeal, {{which is}} common {{mostly in the}} United States, has the husk and germ of the maize kernel almost {{completely}} removed. It is conserved {{for about a year}} if stored <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> <b>container</b> in a cool, dry place.|$|E
50|$|Canned {{fish are}} fish {{which have been}} processed, sealed <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> <b>container</b> such as a sealed tin can, and {{subjected}} to heat. Canning is a method of preserving food, and provides a typical shelf life ranging from one to five years.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{variation}} is cold brew coffee, sometimes known as [...] "cold press." [...] Cold water is poured over coffee grounds {{and allowed to}} steep for eight to twenty-four hours. The coffee is then filtered, usually through a very thick filter, removing all particles. This process produces a very strong concentrate which can be stored <b>in</b> <b>a</b> refrigerated, <b>airtight</b> <b>container</b> for up to eight weeks. The coffee can then be prepared for drinking by adding hot water to the concentrate at a water-to-concentrate ratio of approximately 3:1, but can be adjusted to the drinker's preference. The coffee prepared by this method is very low <b>in</b> acidity with <b>a</b> smooth taste, and is often preferred by those with sensitive stomachs. Others, however, feel this method strips coffee of its bold flavor and character. Thus, this method is not common, and there are few appliances designed for it.|$|R
30|$|The raw banana peels were {{collected}} from a local fruit market in Burdwan town. The materials were washed repeatedly with deionized water to remove soluble dust. The banana peels were allowed to dry in the sun for 5  h followed by hot air oven at 70  °C for 24  h (Fig. S 1 a and S 1 b). The dried fish scales were ground and sieved through metallic sieves ranging from 100 to 150  µm. The dried dust of banana peels was stored <b>in</b> <b>a</b> sterilized <b>airtight</b> plastic <b>container.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{dough is}} then {{ready to be}} shaped into {{different}} types of pasta. Depending {{on the type of}} pasta to be made, the dough can either be cut or extruded through dies. The pasta is set <b>in</b> <b>a</b> drying tank under specific conditions of heat, moisture, and time {{depending on the type of}} pasta. The dried pasta is then packaged: Fresh pasta is sealed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> clear, <b>airtight</b> plastic <b>container</b> with <b>a</b> mixture of carbon dioxide and nitrogen that inhibits microbial growth and prolongs the product's shelf life; dried pastas are sealed in clear plastic or cardboard packages.|$|R
50|$|Tallow is a {{rendered}} form of beef or mutton fat. It {{is solid}} at room temperature. Unlike suet, tallow {{can be stored}} for extended periods {{without the need for}} refrigeration to prevent decomposition, provided it is kept <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> <b>container</b> to prevent oxidation.|$|E
50|$|Infused oils are a {{combination}} of a carrier oil and plant material and they can be either commercially or domestically prepared. A base oil, often sunflower, is placed <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> <b>container</b> with the appropriate plant material for a time. Calendula and carrot oils are produced in this way.|$|E
50|$|Once {{completely}} dried, the pappadams can to stored <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> <b>container</b> {{for over}} a year. Their long shelf life implies that these pappadams are produced in bulk in summer and are utilized {{for the rest of}} the year. The pappadams are also sold as packages containing 50-100 pieces/pack.|$|E
50|$|Brined or pickled {{cheese is}} matured <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{solution}} of brine <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> or semi-permeable <b>container.</b> This process gives the cheese good stability, inhibiting bacterial growth even in hot countries. Brined cheeses may be soft or hard, varying in moisture content, and in colour and flavour, {{according to the}} type of milk used; though all will be rindless, and generally taste clean, salty and acidic when fresh, developing some piquancy when aged, and most will be white. Varieties of brined cheese include bryndza, feta, halloumi, sirene, and telemea. Brined cheese is the main type of cheese produced and eaten in the Middle East and Mediterranean areas.|$|R
30|$|The sago hampas waste used in {{this study}} was {{obtained}} from a sago processing plant in Ukong, Tutong District, Brunei Darussalam. When used on a dry basis, sago hampas contains 58  % starch, 23  % cellulose, 9.2  % hemicellulose and 4  % lignin [28]. Sago hampas is the starchy lignocellulosic by-product from the pith of Metroxylon sagu (sago palm) following the starch extraction process [26]. Sago waste collected from the processing plant was washed repeatedly with distilled water to remove soluble impurities, such as excess starch, and solid wastes from the industrial process including adhering dirt and debris. The sago waste was then dried to drain excess water and then further dried <b>in</b> <b>an</b> 80  °C oven for 24  h prior to storage. The dried biomass was ground using a laboratory blender to a fine powder and screened with a standard sieve size to ensure that particle sizes were not greater than 350  µm. The powdered biomass was stored <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> plastic <b>container</b> and used for batch adsorption tests and characterization. Sago waste samples used without chemical treatment are denoted here as SW.|$|R
