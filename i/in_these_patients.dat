5|$|In these diseases, {{antibodies}} {{are mainly}} directed against {{two of the}} proteins of the complex, called PM/Scl-100 (the RNase D like protein) and PM/Scl-75 (one of the RNase PH like proteins from the ring) and antibodies recognizing these proteins are found in approximately 30% of patients with the PM/Scl overlap syndrome. Although these two proteins are the main target of the autoantibodies, other exosome subunits and associated proteins (like C1D) can be targeted <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>patients.</b> At the current time, the most sensitive way to detect these antibodies is by using a peptide, derived from the PM/Scl-100 protein, as the antigen in an ELISA, instead of complete proteins. By this method, autoantibodies are found in up to 55% of patients with the PM/Scl overlap syndrome, {{but they can also}} be detected in patients suffering from either scleroderma, polymyositis, or dermatomyositis alone.|$|E

25|$|There are a {{large number}} of {{immunodeficiency}} syndromes that present clinical and laboratory characteristics of autoimmunity.

25|$|Children or {{adults who}} {{ingested}} acute overdoses have usually manifested {{central nervous system}} depression ranging from mild sedation to coma; serum concentrations of aripiprazole and dehydroaripiprazole <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>patients</b> were elevated by up to 3-4 fold over normal therapeutic levels, yet to date no deaths have been recorded.|$|E
25|$|In rarer {{cases such as}} situs ambiguus or heterotaxy, situs {{cannot be}} determined. <b>In</b> <b>these</b> <b>patients,</b> the liver may be midline, the spleen absent or multiple, and the bowel malrotated.

25|$|Sexual {{activity}} {{for the first}} time may set the stage for an associated asthma attack or may aggravate pre-existing asthma.

25|$|Treatment with {{exogenous}} GH {{is indicated}} only in limited circumstances, and needs regular monitoring {{due to the}} frequency and severity of side-effects.

25|$|Concentrations of {{hemoglobin}} A1 (HbA1) are increased, both in diabetic {{patients and}} {{in patients with}} renal failure, when measured by ion-exchange chromatography.

40|$|Worldwide, {{hepatitis}} C virus (HCV) is {{a common}} infection. Due to new antiviral approaches and the approval of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAA), HCV therapy has become more comfortable. Nevertheless, there are special patient groups, in whom treatment of HCV is still challenging. Due to only few data available, tolerability and efficacy of DAAs in special patient cohorts still remain unclear. Such special patient cohorts comprise HCV in patients with decompensated liver disease (Child-Pugh Class B or C), patients with chronic kidney disease, and patients on waiting lists to renal/liver transplantation or those with HCV recurrence after liver transplantation. HCV infection <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>patient</b> cohorts {{has been shown to}} be associated with increased morbidity and mortality and may lead to reduced graft survival after transplantation. Successful eradication of HCV results in a better outcome concerning liver-related complications and in a better clinical outcome of <b>these</b> <b>patients.</b> <b>In</b> this review, we analyze available data and results from recently published literature and provide an overview of current recommendations of HCV-therapy regimen <b>in</b> <b>these</b> special <b>patient</b> cohorts...|$|R

Fetal {{surgery is}} a high risk procedure reserved for cases with severe oligohydramnios, to try to limit the associated lung underdevelopment, or pulmonary hypoplasia, that is seen at birth <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>patients.</b> The risks of fetal surgery are significant and include limb entrapment, abdominal injury, and fetal or maternal death.

25|$|Also a {{significant}} positive correlation between plasma oxytocin levels and RD personality dimension was found by researchers in New Zealand.

Results from studies measuring plasma oxytocin levels in patients with a diagnosis of major depressive episode according to DSM III-R has shown decreased oxytocin levels <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>patients</b> and lower RD scores on the TCI, leading to an assumption that lower reward dependence leads to depression.|$|E
25|$|The Pacak-Zhuang {{syndrome}} is a recently described disease manifestation in females that includes multiple paragangliomas and somatostatinomas (in some), both neuroendocrine tumors, and secondary polycythemia {{associated with high}} erythropoietin levels. Paragangliomas <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>patients</b> are mainly localized to the abdomen whereas somatostatinomas {{are found in the}} second portion of the duodenum, as shown by imaging or biochemistry. This {{syndrome is}} of special interest as finding more than one type of neuroendocrine tumor in one individual is unusual.
