Caterina Bori goes further, arguing that despite popularity Ibn Taymiyya may have enjoyed among the masses, he appears to have been not merely unpopular among the scholars of his day, but somewhat of an embarrassment. [...] notes similarly that Ibn Taymiyyah had [...] "very little influence on mainstream Sunni Islam until the nineteenth century." [...] and that he was [...] "a little-read scholar with problematic and controversial views" [...] and that [...] "The idea that Ibn Taymiyyah had an immediate and significant impact on the course of Sunni Islamic religious history simply does not cohere with the <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have from the five centuries that elapsed between his death and the rise of Sunni revivialism in the modern period."
