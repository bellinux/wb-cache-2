According to Dustin Hoffman in his online Masterclass, Brando would often talk to camera men and fellow actors about their weekend even after the director would call action. Once Brando felt he could deliver the dialogue as natural as that conversation he would start the dialogue. In his 2015 documentary, Listen To Me Marlon, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>before</b> that actors were like breakfast cereals. He was calling them predictable. Critics would later say this was Brando being difficult, but actors who worked opposite would say it was just all part of his technique.|$|E

[...] <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>before</b> the tour's start that remaining popular {{had been one of}} his motivations for the Super Bowl appearance: [...] "I've said no for about 10 years or however long they've been asking, but, I tell you, we played on the last tour and there were some empty seats here and there and, well, there shouldn't be any empty seats at an E Street Band show. I hold pride that we remain one of the great wonders of the world ... so sometimes you got to remind people a little bit." ...|$|E
500|$|The Utah {{portion of}} I-70 was not {{completed}} to Interstate Highway standards until 1990, {{when the second}} Eagle Canyon bridge was dedicated. A second dedication ceremony {{was held at the}} bridge declaring the Utah portion of I-70 complete. Archie Hamilton, one of three engineers who worked for Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) long enough to see I-70 progress from conception to completion, said the most memorable moment was seeing the excavation at Spotted Wolf Canyon. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>before</b> construction began, he could stand in one spot and touch both sides of the canyon. To carve the first [...] through the canyon required excavating [...] of rock. It was estimated construction cost for the San Rafael Swell portion was $183.5million, $105.5million (1970, $595million in 2008) to build the first two lanes, and $78million (1990, $130million in 2008) to construct the rest. At the 1970 dedication, it was noted the cost of land acquisition helped to offset the cost of the massive excavation. UDOT acquired the right of way to build the majority of I-70 from the BLM at the lowest cost per mile of any highway in Utah.|$|E

500|$|Following the {{assassination}} of Martin Luther King on April 4, 1968 there was widespread rioting and disorder across the US. The trouble reached Baltimore on April 6, {{and for the next}} three days and nights the city burned. Agnew {{declared a state of emergency}} and called out the National Guard. When order was restored there were six dead, more than 4,000 were under arrest, the fire department had responded to 1,200 fires, and there had been widespread looting. On April 11, Agnew summoned more than 100 moderate black leaders to the state capitol, where instead of the expected constructive dialogue he delivered a speech roundly castigating them for their failure to control more radical elements, and accused them of a cowardly retreat or even complicity. One of the delegates, the Rev. Sidney Daniels, rebuked the governor: [...] "Talk to us like we are ladies and gentlemen", <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>before</b> walking out. Others followed him; the remnant was treated to further accusations as Agnew rejected all socio-economic explanations for the disturbances. Many white suburbanites applauded Agnew's speech: over 90 percent of the 9,000 responses by phone, letter or telegram supported him, and he won tributes from leading Republican conservatives such as Jack Williams, governor of Arizona, and former senator William Knowland of California. To members of the black community the April 11 meeting was a turning point. Having previously welcomed Agnew's stance on civil rights, they now felt betrayed, one state senator observing: [...] "He has sold us out ... he thinks like George Wallace, he talks like George Wallace".|$|E

He further said that [...] "The Lord wins in the end" [...] and [...] "thank you all", <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>before</b> giving them his blessing.|$|E

The title was picked as a reference to the 1979 David Bowie song [...] "Look Back in Anger" [...] from the seminal art rock album Lodger, with Bowie's work being a massive Oasis influence.|$|E

2500|$|Air Canada said {{it could}} be forced to cancel flights and strand {{thousands}} of passengers if Aveos is unable to complete repairs to several planes. [...] The airline's lawyers argued in vain Monday for a Quebec Superior Court judge to order Aveos to not lay off more workers and to meet its obligations to complete the aircraft repairs. [...] Justice Mark Schrager denied an Air Canada request that would have forced Aveos to maintain operations and employment to complete the contracted repairs. [...] "Accommodation, if there is any between Aveos and Air Canada, is going to be made in a boardroom, not a courtroom," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>before</b> granting creditor protection Monday.|$|E
2500|$|Apparently prehistoric man {{was hunting}} big game with stone tools {{one year and}} farming with {{domestic}} animals and ground stone tools the next. Mortillet postulated a [...] "time then unknown (époque alors inconnue)" [...] to fill the gap. The hunt for the [...] "unknown" [...] was on. On April 16, 1874, Mortillet retracted. [...] "That hiatus is not real (Cet hiatus n'est pas réel)," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>before</b> the Société d'Anthropologie, asserting {{that it was an}} informational gap only. The other theory had been a gap in nature, that, because of the ice age, man had retreated from Europe. The information must now be found. In 1895 Piette stated that he had heard Lartet speak of [...] "the remains from the intermediate period (les vestiges de l'époque intermédiaire)", which were yet to be discovered, but Lartet had not published this view. The gap had become a transition. However, asserted Piette: ...|$|E
2500|$|In March 2016, Pakistan was {{eliminated}} from the 2016 ICC World Twenty20 after losing 3 matches against India, New Zealand and Australia and only winning against Bangladesh. This caused great controversy over whose 'fault' it was. Khan was amongst those blamed and there were talks about him retiring from PCB after this. However, he later spoke out {{and said he would}} not resign. He also said {{it would be better to}} bring in a foreign coach, implying that Waqar Younis' coaching contract, which ends in June 2016, will not be renewed. Furthermore, he did not release any statements on who he thought was responsible for the loss [...] Instead, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>before</b> the match that he will not change Afridi's position because he has been 'serving Pakistan for the last 20 years'. He added that changes will happen after the tournament but also added that the poor performance was from the whole team, except certain individuals.|$|E

2500|$|On the July 23 {{episode of}} WWE Raw 1000, after CM Punk {{attacked}} The Rock, Lawler would mention on commentary that [...] "CM Punk has {{turned his back}} on the WWE Universe". The following week on Raw, Punk would confront Lawler about what <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>before</b> being interrupted by Big Show. On the August 20 episode of Raw, after John Cena wouldn't tell Punk he was the [...] "Best in the World", Punk would ask for Lawler to get in the ring and say it for the WWE Universe. After Lawler refused to say Punk was the [...] "Best in the World" [...] too, Punk would attack Lawler from behind. The next week on Raw, after Lawler demanded an apology from Punk, Punk would challenge Lawler to a match, which Lawler would accept later that night, where Punk would defeat Lawler in a Steel Cage match. Before the September 3 episode of Raw, Punk and Lawler brawled backstage, with Punk getting the upper hand before officials stopped them, Lawler was kicked in the throat, which caused Lawler to miss commentary that night, with The Miz filling in for him.|$|E
