5|$|Life in Nelson {{remained}} {{difficult for}} Heaphy, who had by now lost his appetite for exploration. He eked {{out a living}} taking occasional jobs {{for the next six}} months. For much of 1847, he undertook survey work around Tasman Bay and later in that year was the representative of the New Zealand Company, when the government investigated the amount of land set aside by the company for the local Māori. Work <b>had</b> <b>dried</b> up by early 1848 and when he was offered employment with the Auckland Survey Office in April 1848, he accepted.|$|E
5|$|The war had {{shattered}} Pound's {{belief in}} modern western civilization. He saw the Vorticist movement as finished and doubted his own {{future as a}} poet. He had only the New Age to write for; his relationship with Poetry was finished, The Egoist was quickly {{running out of money}} because of censorship problems caused by the serialization of Joyce's Ulysses, and the funds for The Little Review <b>had</b> <b>dried</b> up. Other magazines ignored his submissions or refused to review his work. Toward the end of 1920 he and Dorothy decided their time in London was over and resolved to move to Paris.|$|E
5|$|In {{southern}} Palestine the wet {{season was}} approaching with another thunderstorm and heavy {{rain on the}} night of 11 November. The dark cotton soil over which the Egyptian Expeditionary Force was now advancing would not need much more rain to turn it into impassable mud. But 12 November had been fine and the roads <b>had</b> <b>dried</b> out. The rolling maritime plain was dotted with villages on low hill tops surrounded by groves and orchards. These were in turn surrounded by hedges of prickly pear or cactus, making them strong natural places of defence. In the distance to the right the spurs and valleys of the Judean Hills were visible even to the invading British Empire troops near the Mediterranean coast. On 13 November the weather was clear and fine with at first no sign of the Ottoman Army.|$|E

5|$|Rosberg {{was again}} fastest {{in the second}} session on Friday afternoon, setting his fastest time of 1:07.967 in the early minutes. This {{benchmark}} would stand {{for the rest of}} the session as heavy rain arrived at the circuit eight minutes in. Several drivers slid off the track as they tried to return to the pitlane, where they would remain for half an hour until the rain eased off. Ricciardo was the first to head out again on the intermediate tyres, slowly followed by the rest of the field. With under twenty minutes remaining, the track <b>had</b> <b>dried</b> out enough to use slick tyres. Behind Rosberg and Hamilton, Nico Hülkenberg set the third-fastest time, ahead of Vettel, who spun out into the gravel trap in turn 2 late in the session.|$|E
5|$|Although {{rain fell}} on Saturday morning, the track <b>had</b> <b>dried</b> by {{the start of}} the final free {{practice}} session. Lewis Hamilton again set the fastest time with 1:25.624, less than two-tenths of a second in front of teammate Rosberg, with Sebastian Vettel in third position close behind. The fastest times had been set on the super-soft tyre compound. However, Mercedes's advantage over Ferrari proved more significant, up to seven-tenths of a second on the harder soft compound, the tyre most likely {{to be used in the}} race. Toro Rosso confirmed their good pace for the weekend with fourth and sixth place for Carlos Sainz and Max Verstappen respectively, being about half a second quicker than their sister team, Red Bull Racing. A major incident occurred just seconds after the beginning of the practice session, when Rio Haryanto and Romain Grosjean collided in the pit lane. Both cars needed to equip new front wings and Haas also changed the floor on Grosjean's car. Haryanto was later issued a three-place grid penalty for the incident, as well as two penalty points added to his licence.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{increase}} her resistance to pain he would drop hot sealing wax {{on her back and}} arms or stick pins in her, commanding her not to cry out. He would test her ability to keep secrets by telling her that his life was in danger and she should tell no one. To increase her resistance to the cold, Day instructed Sabrina to wade into Stowe Pool until the water reached her neck, then lie in the nearby meadow until her clothes and hair <b>had</b> <b>dried</b> in the sun. Finally, to test her resistance to luxury, he gave her a big box of handmade silk clothes and had her throw them on a fire. Day had limited success with these techniques. Sabrina became able to endure hot wax dripped on her arm without flinching, but she did tell others of his secret techniques, and could not help screaming whenever he fired his gun at her.|$|E

Because of its scarcity, bread that <b>had</b> <b>dried</b> was made into a pudding known as boyos de pan.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, India {{still had}} a fixed {{exchange}} system, where the rupee was pegged {{to the value of}} a basket of currencies of major trading partners. India started having balance of payments problems since 1985, {{and by the end of}} 1990, it found itself in serious economic trouble. The government was close to default and its foreign exchange reserves <b>had</b> <b>dried</b> up to the point that India could barely finance three weeks’ worth of imports. As in 1966, India faced high inflation and large government budget deficits. This led the government to devalue the rupee.|$|E
25|$|The {{earthquake}} of 1908, {{which killed}} 60,000 people in Messina, later affected {{the club in}} a large manner; deaths included Charles Bousfield Huleatt, players Frank John Carter, Walter Oates and financial backer George H. Peirce. Football resumed in Messina during the following year, thanks largely to Arthur Barret Lascelles who used money from his own pocket to ensure football activity in the city would continue. By 1910 the funds of Barret <b>had</b> <b>dried</b> up and the club was folded, Società Ginnastica Garibaldi Messina (Gymnastic Society Garibaldi Messina) briefly took its place until it too was dissolved due to the First World War.|$|E

The children were crying for food or milk, none of which existed, because the women's breasts <b>had</b> <b>dried</b> up from hunger... Many women, hungry and exhausted, would leave their famished children on the roadside, and continue their tortuous journey. Some would go to nearby forests in search of something to eat. Usually they would not come back. Often those who died, served as food for the living.|$|E
25|$|By 1952, orders <b>had</b> <b>dried</b> {{up in the}} United States, with a total {{production}} run of only 99 units. The units proved relatively more popular in Canada, particularly with the CPR, and orders continued there until 1955. Several variants were only ever produced by the Canadian Locomotive Company, and Canadian roads accepted a total of 66 units. However, Westinghouse had announced in 1953 that it was leaving the locomotive equipment market, {{in part because of}} the generator reliability issues in the F-M units. This development made continuing production of the C-liners impractical without a redesign, and since marketplace acceptance was already marginal, the decision was made to end production.|$|E
25|$|Anna Karoline {{served as}} a cargo vessel and the cargo changed {{depending}} on what owners she had, {{time of the year}} and where she was stationed. When Ole Vandsvik was one of the owners Anna Karoline started the new year with a voyage to Lofoten to buy fish. The fish was salted on board the vessel and she returned in May to Kiran in Roan where the fish was dried. While the fish was drying the jekt was transporting timber from Namsen to Northern Norway. When the fish <b>had</b> <b>dried</b> the vessel was loaded with stockfish, and sailed to Bergen. The vessel was also used for transporting herring and as sleeping quarters during fishing.|$|E
