Crystallography shows a hexagonal unit cell, space group P 6 3 /mmc (No. 194) with Z = 2, a = b = 11. 7104 (11) Å, c = 6. 6259 (5) Å and V = 786. 90 (12) Å 3 at 100 K. The <b>hydrated</b> <b>trivalent</b> yttrium(III) <b>ion</b> forms a tricapped trigonal prism, in which the yttrium(III) ion is surrounded by six equidistant water molecules in the prism and three more distant water molecules in capping positions with M-O bond distances of 2. 370 (2) and 2. 446 (3) Å, respectively. Relatively strong hydrogen bonds (2. 818 and 2. 851 Å) from water molecules to the bromate ions stabilize the trigonal prism around the yttrium(III) ions...|$|R

The bis-zwitter- ionic lamellar material was prepared by sol-gel process from only 3 -amino- propyltriethoxysilane (APTES), succin- ic anhydride, and ethylenediamine. In ethanol heated under reflux, the ex- change ethylenediammonium versus Ln 3 + {{proved to be}} complete by com- plexometry measurements and elemen- tal analyses, one Cl ion per one LnIII remaining as expected for charge bal- ance. In aqueous solution at 20 8 C, the material {{was found to be}} selective to- wards lanthanide in spite of the similar- ity of their ionic radii. The cation uptake depends {{on the nature of the}} salt, the difference between two lantha- nides reaching up to 20 % in some cases. Finally, ion-exchange reaction with FeCl 3 was chosen as a probe to get more information on the material after incorporation of <b>trivalent</b> <b>ions.</b> Based on Mçssbauer spectroscopic in- vestigations on the resulting material in conjunction with the XRD analysis of materials containing <b>trivalent</b> <b>ions,</b> a structural model was proposed to de- scribe the incorporation of <b>trivalent</b> <b>ions</b> by exchange reaction within the original zwitterionic material...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{experiments}} {{have shown that}} <b>trivalent</b> <b>ion,</b> spermidine$^{ 3 +}$, can provoke lateral microphase segregation in DNA brushes. Using molecular simulations and simple theoretical arguments, we explore the effects of trivalent counterions on polyelectrolyte brushes. At a proper range of grafting density, polymer size, and ion concentration, the brush polymers collapse heterogeneously into octopus-like surface micelles. Remarkably, the heterogeneity in brush morphology is maximized and the relaxation dynamics of chain and condensed ion are the slowest at the 1 : 3 stoichiometric concentration of <b>trivalent</b> <b>ions</b> to polyelectrolyte charge. A further increase of <b>trivalent</b> <b>ion</b> concentration conducive to a charge inversion elicits modest reswelling and homogenizes the morphology of brush condensate.

40|$|AbstractThe {{presence}} of {{small numbers of}} multivalent ions in DNA-containing solutions results in strong attractive forces between DNA strands. Despite the biological importance of this interaction, e. g., DNA condensation, its physical origin remains elusive. We carried {{out a series of}} experiments to probe interactions between short DNA strands as small numbers of <b>trivalent</b> <b>ions</b> are included in a solution containing DNA and monovalent ions. Using resonant (anomalous) and nonresonant small angle x-ray scattering, we coordinated measurements of the number and distribution of each ion species around the DNA with the onset of attractive forces between DNA strands. DNA-DNA interactions occur as the number of <b>trivalent</b> <b>ions</b> increases. Surprisingly good agreement is found between data and size-corrected numerical Poisson-Boltzmann predictions of ion competition for non- and weakly interacting DNAs.

40|$|The {{plant hormone}} abscisic acid (ABA) mediates many vital {{processes}} in plant growth and development, including seed dormancy, cell division, water use efficiency, and adaptation to drought, salinity, chilling, pathogen attack, and UV light. Our understanding of ABA signal transduction is fragmentary and {{would benefit from}} specific and facile probes of the process. Protoplasts from rice (Oryza sativa L. cv IR 54) embryonic suspension cultures cotransformed with effector plasmids encoding the maize (Zea mays) VIVIPAROUS 1 cDNA and/or the Arabidopsis dominant negative mutant (abi 1 - 1) ABA-insensitive cDNA demonstrated genetic interactions of VIVIPAROUS 1 and abi 1 - 1 in transactivation of the ABA-inducible HVA 1 promoter from barley (Hordeum vulgare), suggesting the mechanisms of these effecters are conserved among monocots and dicots. <b>Trivalent</b> <b>ions</b> {{have been shown to}} act as an effector of gene expression in plants and animals, although the mechanism of action is unknown.

40|$|AbstractWe have {{investigated}} the salt sensitivity of the hexagonal-to-cholesteric phase transition of spermidine-condensed DNA. This transition precedes the resolubilization of precipitated DNA that occurs at high spermidine concentration. The sensitivity of the critical spermidine concentration at the transition point to the anion species and the NaCl concentration indicates that ion pairing of this <b>trivalent</b> <b>ion</b> underlies this unusual transition. Osmotic pressure measurements of spermidine salt solutions are consistent with this interpretation. Spermidine salts are not fully dissociated at higher concentrations. The competition for DNA binding among the fully charged <b>trivalent</b> <b>ion</b> and the lesser charged complex species at higher concentrations significantly weakens attraction between DNA helices in the condensed state. This {{is contrary to the}} suggestion that the binding of spermidine at higher concentrations causes DNA overcharging and consequent electrostatic repulsion...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{work has}} shown that in rice {{suspension}} cells, NaCl at 0. 4 M can induce Em gene expression and act synergistically with ABA, possibly by potentiating the ABA response pathway through a rate-limiting intermediate (R. M. Bostock and R. S. Quatrano (1992) Plant Physiol., 98, 1356 - 1363). Since calcium is an intermediate in ABA regulation of stomatal closure, we tested the effect of calcium changes on ABA-inducible Em gene expression in transiently transformed rice protoplasts. We show that calcium is required for ABA-inducible Em-GUS expression and can act in synergy with ABA. The <b>trivalent</b> <b>ions</b> lanthanum, gadolinium, and aluminum, which are known to interact with calcium- and other signaling pathways, can act at sub-millimolar concentrations to increase GUS reporter gene expression driven by several promoters in transiently transformed rice protoplasts. This effect is not specific for the ABA-inducible Em promoter, but is synergistic with ABA. The lanthanum synergy with ABA does not require calcium. In rice suspension cells, lanthanum alone does not induce Em gene expression, in contrast to transiently transformed protoplasts, yet can act synergistically with ABA to effectively increase the sensitivity to ABA greater than tenfold. <b>Trivalent</b> <b>ions</b> may be a useful tool to study the regulation of gene expression. The possible effects of <b>trivalent</b> <b>ions</b> on ABA signal transduction and gene expression are discussed...|$|R

Alkaline earth fluoride nanoparticles doped with <b>trivalent</b> lanthanide <b>ions</b> (which are required for the quantum cutting phenomenon) were prepared via a microwave assisted method in ionic liquids. As doping <b>trivalent</b> <b>ions</b> into a host with divalent cations requires charge compensation, this effect was thoroughly studied by powder X-ray and electron diffraction, luminescence spectroscopy and 23 Na, 139 La and 19 F solid state NMR spectroscopy.
