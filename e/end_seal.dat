25|$|At {{a reverse}} voltage lower than −1.5V at room temperature, the cathode {{aluminum}} foil begins {{to build up}} an oxide layer corresponding to the applied voltage. This is aligned with generating hydrogen gas with increasing pressure. At {{the same time the}} oxide layer on the anode foil begins dissolution of the oxide, which weakens the voltage proof. It is now a question of the outside circuit whether the increasing gas pressure from oxidization leads to bursting of the case, or the weakened anode oxide leads to a breakdown with a short circuit. If the outside circuit is high-ohmic the capacitor fails and the vent opens due to high gas pressure. If the outside circuit is low-ohmic, an internal short circuit is more probable. In every case a reverse voltage lower than −1.5V at room temperature may cause the component to catastrophically fail due to a dielectric breakdown or overpressure, which causes the capacitor to burst, often in a spectacularly dramatic fashion. Modern electrolytic capacitors have a safety vent that is typically either a scored section of the case or a specially designed <b>end</b> <b>seal</b> to vent the hot gas/liquid, but ruptures can still be dramatic.|$|E

50|$|Dr Brain made cadaveric plaster casts of {{the space}} around and behind the glottis, a space adapted to the {{acceptance}} of foreign bodies {{in the form of}} food, therefore likely to tolerate an inflated cuff. Dr Brain recognised that if the boat shaped space were to be filled by an expandable cuff, an end to <b>end</b> <b>seal</b> could be formed. Dr Brain experimented with the Goldman Dental nasal mask cuff, if the flanges were drawn together in the midline, they produced a remarkable approximation to the plaster casts. The final step to create the first prototype laryngeal mask was to incorporate a tube. Satisfied by the results of inserting the prototype laryngeal mask into cadavers, the prototype laryngeal mask was first used in the summer of 1981 in a 40-year-old male patient undergoing an elective inguinal hernia repair. To Dr Brain’s delight, it was possible to ventilate the lungs, indicating not only that the device provided a clear airway, but that it also formed an effective seal with the glottic inlet.|$|E
40|$|This Master Thesis {{consider}} the load deflection characteristics of <b>end</b> <b>seals</b> incorporated in guide vanes used in hydropower turbines. The force {{response of the}} <b>end</b> <b>seals</b> is critical {{in order to prevent}} leakage and thus increase the efficiency of the turbine. The guide vanes is located in front of the turbine runner in order to regulate the flow of water. At present time, either one or two O-rings, cut into mouldings, is used as these aforementioned <b>end</b> <b>seals.</b> Rainpower, which have proposed this master thesis only have a selection of experimental measurements of the load characteristics for a limited amount of geometries and material parameters of the <b>end</b> <b>seals.</b> By use of two dimensional modelling and Finite Element Analysis focusing on groove tolerances, cross-sectional dimensions, and material properties, a parameter study of situations including both one and two sealing elements is assessed. ABAQUS 6. 14 - 1 is used for construction of two dimensional models and conducting Finite Element Analysis of the sealing elements. Interaction properties such as contact algorithm and frictional behaviour are taken into consideration. In addition, procedure notes, additional results, proposed test data guide lines for experimental material testing of elastomers and early model development is presented in appendices. It was concluded that; using a linear-elastic material approach is sufficient to recreate the trends of the material behaviour in highly confined environments. Several load deflection curves were carried out and compared, the results indicated distinctive material trends depending on the aforementioned factors. However, experimental test data of different material batches are required to implement numerical analysis with hyperelastic properties in ABAQUS. Relevant theory, methodology and results is considered in addition to evaluation and discussion of results. Recommendations for any further work have also been proposed...|$|R

Governing equations of the seal analysis modified to model the damper bearing; differences between the upstream conditions of the damper bearing and a typical annular seal; prediction of the damper bearing analysis; and assumptions of the analysis which require further investigation are described...|$|E

40|$|Squeeze film dampers {{are widely}} used in {{aircraft}} engines, land-based gas turbines, and other rotating machines to im-prove system damping. They often have entrained air within the oil film, which is usually not {{taken into account in}} rotordy-namics analysis due to lack of good formulations of the effects involved. The effects on the damping force calculation can be significant. This work presents a new formulation of the nonlin-ear Reynolds equation pressure evaluation within the squeeze film damper, including the effects of entrained air, with result-ing changes in effective lubricant density and viscosity. Viscos-ity and density expressions are developed {{as a function of the}} air/oil volume fraction. The density of the bubbly oil is a func-tion of the air bubble diameter, which changes due to surface tension effects during lubricant motion in the bubbly oil film. The lubricant viscosity decreases due to the entrained volume of air but increases due to the surface tension effects taken from experimental tests. Pressure supply and bubbly oil film cavita-tion effects are included in the analysis and <b>end</b> <b>seal</b> effects are evaluated. The nonlinear time-transient forces in the squeeze film damper are evaluated as functions of (1) lubricant and air properties; (2) damper geometry including diameter, length, clearance; (3) <b>end</b> <b>seal</b> properties; and (4) shaft position and ve-locity. Example cases of pressure calculations and radial and tangential forces are shown.

40|$|Squeeze film dampers (SFDs) provide {{viscous damping}} to {{attenuate}} excessive vibrations and enhance system stability in turbomachinery. SFDs are of special importance in aircraft engines which use rolling element support bearings that, by themselves, {{do not provide}} enough damping to ensure safe operation. A modular test rig capable of simulating actual operating conditions in aircraft jet engines is used to test two centrally grooved, <b>end</b> <b>sealed,</b> SFDs. Both SFDs have diameter D and nominal radial clearance c and consist of two parallel squeeze film lands separated by a deep circumferential groove of length LG and depth dG. A short length damper with film land lengths L and a long damper with land lengths 2 L are tested. Piston rings seal the damper lands. An ISO VG 2 lubricant is supplied to the SFD via three radial holes that discharge lubricant into the central groove. The lubricant passes through the damper lands and across the piston ring seals to finally exit the damper at ambient pressure. Circular orbit tests of amplitude ~ 0. 5 c and for static eccentricities varying from 0 to ~ 0. 36 c are conducted on the two sealed dampers. The instrumental variable filter method (IVFM) serves to identify the SFD dynamic force coefficients. The parameter identification range is 50 Hz to 210 Hz for the short damper and 110 Hz to 250 Hz for the long damper. Large amplitude dynamic pressures measured in the central groove demonstrate that the central groove does not divide the damper in two separate film lands, but the lubricant in the groove interacts with the squeeze film lands, hence contributing significantly to the SFD forced response. Dynamic pressures in the film lands and in the central groove reveal that both dampers operate free of air ingestion or cavitation for the tested static eccentricities and amplitudes of motion. Comparisons to test results for the same SFD configurations but with open ends demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} <b>end</b> <b>seals</b> on increasing the direct damping coefficients. For the <b>sealed</b> <b>ends</b> short length damper, the added mass coefficients are ~ 2 times larger and the damping coefficients are ~ 3. 8 times larger than the respective coefficients of the open ends long damper. For the <b>sealed</b> <b>ends</b> long damper, the damping coefficients are ~ 2. 8 times, and the added mass coefficients are ~ 3. 1 times larger than coefficients from the open ends configuration. The identified SFD direct stiffness coefficients are nearly zero except at the maximum static eccentricity for the long damper. Predictions from a novel computational model that include the effects of the central groove, the lubricant feed holes and the <b>end</b> <b>seals</b> are in excellent agreement with results from the short length damper. For the long damper, the predicted damping coefficients are in good agreement with the test results, while the added mass coefficients are under predicted by ~ 25 percent. Experimental results from the two sealed SFD configurations lead {{to a better understanding of}} the effects of <b>end</b> <b>seals</b> as well as central feed groves on the SFD forced performance. The results presented in this thesis will help improve the effectiveness of SFDs aircraft jet engines...|$|R

One hundred fifty capacitors incorporating the design improvements were manufactured and subsequently underwent 500 thermal shock cycles. One hundred forty nine capacitors survived the test.

40|$|Squeeze film dampers (SFDs) {{with low}} levels of {{external}} pressurization and poor end sealing are prone to air entrapment, thus reducing the damping capability. Furthermore, existing predictive models are too restrictive. Single frequency, unidirectional load and centered circular orbit experiments were conducted on a revamped SFD test rig. The damper journal is 1 " in length and 5 " in diameter, with nominal clearance of 5 mils (0. 127 mm). The SFD feed end is flooded with oil, while the discharge end contains a recirculation groove and four orifice discharge ports to prevent air ingestion. The discharge end is fully sealed with a wave-spring that pushes a seal ring into contact with the SFD journal. The measurements conducted without and with lubricant in the squeeze film lands, along with a frequency domain identification procedure, render the mechanical seal dry-friction force and viscous damping force coefficients as functions of frequency and motion amplitude. The <b>end</b> <b>seal</b> arrangement is quite effective in eliminating side leakage and preventing air entrainment into the film lands. Importantly enough, the dry friction force, arising from the contact forces in relative motion, increases significantly the test element equivalent viscous damping coefficients. The identified system damping coefficients are thus frequency and amplitude of motion dependent, albeit decreasing rapidly as the motion parameters increase. Identified force coefficients, damping and added mass, for the squeeze film damper alone agree very well with predictions based on the full film, short length SFD model...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to determine the effect of various weld and machine parameters on ultrasonic weld strength. Specifically, welds with six different triple-layer coextruded polyethylene and metallized polypropylene films were examined. These materials were welded in separate experimental studies using a bench top weld system and a high production volume packaging machine. The first study investigated the effect of a range of weld forces, energies, and amplitudes in a lap joint geometry using a bench top ultrasonic plunge welding system. Weld strength was determined by measuring resistance to tearing and peel and shear strength. It was observed that low energy and low weld force had a significant effect on shear strength welds for all materials. High peel strength was observed at relatively high weld forces and energies, and high tear resistance was observed at relatively high forces, high amplitudes, and mid-range energy levels. The second study determined the suitability for the same materials to be sealed as bags for packaging applications in a vertical 2 ̆ 2 form fill seal 2 ̆ 2 machine. This machine was equipped with an ultrasonic <b>end</b> <b>seal</b> jaw. The machine factors tested in this study include energy, amplitude, and production rate (the rate at which bags are created/welded) to determine the effect on peel strength. It was observed that low energy and amplitude correlated with high strength for the top weld (top of bag) of one material and low production rate resulted in high strength for the top weld of two materials as well as the bottom weld for two materials. Data for the sixth material was inconclusive...|$|E
40|$|Flexible {{packaging}} is {{a growing}} successful market {{and the majority of}} flexible package applications are for the food industry. The demand for process optimization and reduced production costs, has led to an increase in flexible packaging. However, fast production lines can result in contamination in the seal area. For flexible food packaging, contamination is considered any food particle or substance trapped in the seal area. Current quality control processes can detect contamination in the seal area, but it is not determined if seal contamination affects seal quality. Oil-based and sodium based snack foods are two common categories that can be packaged on a horizontal form fill and seal (HFFS) flow-wrap machine. The study uses vegetable oil and a salt water solution to simulate the effect of liquid contamination along the T-point of flexible pouches made on an HFFS. The T-point refers to where the fin seal meets the <b>end</b> <b>seal</b> and requires the seal jaw to seal through four layers of film, which is the most difficult point to seal. The study tests a combination of different sealing temperatures and dwell time to determine the optimal sealing condition for a hermetic seal. A quality hermetic seal provides an enclosed seal with no leaks due to successful polymer chain entanglement between the two sealant layers. The different test categories of the study are non-contaminated (control), salt water solution for salt based foods, and vegetable oil for oil-based foods. Given the test parameters of the study, 140 ⁰C sealing temperature and 0. 3 seconds dwell time are considered to be the optimal sealing condition for all three test categories. For Phase 1 of the study, salt water had a lower Hermeticity pass rate compared to vegetable oil and non-contaminated seals. In addition, the effect of refrigerated storage temperature and ambient storage temperature did not show to be significant for any of the test categories. However, refrigerated conditions showed a higher Hermeticity pass rate, but it was not statistically different. The findings for seal strength indicated no test category had higher or lower seal strength over the 14 day test period. Overall, the study shows there is no effect of liquid contaminant on Hermeticity and seal strength for flexible film with LLDPE sealant layer...|$|E
