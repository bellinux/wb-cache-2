25|$|In September 1963, Mitchell {{unexpectedly}} took early retirement, due {{to health}} reasons, at age 58, after 24 years service. He had {{announced that he}} would do so before he came under suspicion. But he was later interrogated, in 1968, and seemingly was able to answer the charges successfully. The main suspicion then fell on Hollis and, although the matter has never been completely resolved, Christopher Andrew in his Authorised History of MI5 comes to a firm conclusion that neither were traitors. Pincher, conversely, believes that Hollis was the most likely culprit, <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>one.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Conspiracy of 1741, {{also known}} as the Negro Plot of 1741 or the Slave Insurrection of 1741, was a purported plot by slaves and poor whites in the British colony of New York in 1741 to revolt and level New York City with a series of fires. Historians {{disagree}} as to whether such a plot existed and, <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>one,</b> its scale.

25|$|The Lake–Peterson House {{is one of}} the U.S. {{state of}} Illinois' finest {{examples}} of Gothic Revival architecture, specifically Victorian Gothic. The asymmetrical two-story residence is constructed of yellow brick and sits upon a stone foundation. Its steeply pitched roof is clad in slate tiles and each of the four sides of the original home features a decorative gable. The house also features tall brick chimneys with corbelled chimney caps, dormers, bay windows and a large veranda. The architect, <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>one,</b> is unknown, though it is probable that Lake himself was the builder. One possibility is that John Lake obtained the architectural plans in England, his native land, where he had returned from as construction on the house began in 1873.|$|E
25|$|The FIDONET {{program was}} what later {{became known as}} a mailer. FIDO was {{modified}} to use a previously unused numeric field in the message headers to store a node number for the machine the message should be delivered to. When FIDONET ran, it would search through the email database for any messages with a number in this field. FIDONET collected all of the messages for a particular node number into a file known as a message packet. After all the packets were generated, one for each node, the FIDONET program would look up the destination node's phone number in NODELIST.BBS, and call the remote system. Provided that FIDONET was running on that system, the two systems would handshake and, if this succeeded, the calling system would upload its packet, download a return packet <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>one,</b> and disconnect. FIDONET would then unpack the return packet, place the received messages into the local system's storage, and move onto the next packet. When there were no remaining packet, it would exit, and run the FIDO BBS program.|$|E
500|$|Because of this uncertainty, a co-regency is {{currently}} impossible to prove or disprove.

However, co-regency supporters note that since at least one rebellion had been led against Ahmose during his reign, it would certainly have been logical to crown a successor before one's death to prevent a struggle for the crown.|$|E

This came as a shock to many Americans, and it fell to Oppenheimer to check the evidence and confirm that the explosion had taken place. In response, Strauss recommended that the United States retain nuclear superiority by developing the [...] "Super". This had been under consideration at Los Alamos for several years. Brigadier General James McCormack told the AEC commissioners that while thermonuclear weapons could potentially be thousands of times as powerful as fission weapons, as of 1949 there was no design that worked, and no certainty that a practical bomb could be built <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>one.</b> He cautioned that the [...] "Super" [...] would probably require large amounts of tritium, which could only be acquired by diverting the AEC's nuclear reactors from plutonium production.|$|E
500|$|Since Athenian {{politicians}} were often indicted by their opponents, {{there was not}} always {{a clear distinction between}} [...] "private" [...] and [...] "public" [...] cases, and thus a career as a logographer opened the way for Demosthenes to embark on his political career. An Athenian logographer could remain anonymous, which enabled him to serve personal interests, even if it prejudiced the client. It also left him open to allegations of malpractice. Thus for example Aeschines accused Demosthenes of unethically disclosing his clients' arguments to their opponents; in particular, that he wrote a speech for Phormion (350 BC), a wealthy banker, and then communicated it to Apollodorus, who was bringing a capital charge against Phormion. Plutarch much later supported this accusation, stating that Demosthenes [...] "was thought to have acted dishonorably" [...] and he also accused Demosthenes of writing speeches for both sides. It has often been argued that the deception, <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>one,</b> involved a political quid pro quo, whereby Apollodorus secretly pledged support for unpopular reforms that Demosthenes was pursuing in the greater, public interest (i.e. the diversion of Theoric Funds to military purposes).|$|E
