5|$|A French street artist, <b>Invader,</b> made a {{name for}} himself by {{creating}} mosaic artwork of Space <b>Invader</b> aliens around the world.|$|E
5|$|<b>Invader</b> is a {{graduate}} of the École des Beaux-Arts, a Parisian art school. <b>Invader</b> initially derived inspiration for his creations from video games from the late 1970s to early 1980s that he played when he was growing up, particularly characters from Space Invaders, from which he derived his name. Games of the era were made with 8-bit graphics, and so lend themselves well to his method of each tile representing one pixel. <b>Invader</b> began making mosaics in Paris in the 1990s and then in 31 other cities in France.|$|E
5|$|As {{his works}} have sold since the 2010s, <b>Invader</b> adopted a new {{strategy}} to avoid them being removed. In late 2015, <b>Invader</b> planned a series of art pieces in New York City, putting out a call on social media for building owners who {{would be willing to}} host his mosaics legally. In addition, he has chosen sites with architectural features restricting access. Also, his works may be larger and use more delicate tiles so that they cannot be removed undamaged.|$|E

5|$|In Hong Kong {{in early}} 2014, <b>Invader</b> {{installed}} 48 works. However, the city's Highways Department removed a roadside mosaic in Fortress Hill. Local residents were disappointed, {{and saw the}} removal {{as an example of}} the government only paying lip-service to promoting the arts in the city. In early 2015, a replica of the life-sized Hong Kong Phooey (HK 58) that had been removed, reached HK$1.96 million ($250,000) at auction at Sotheby's. NY 145, featuring an <b>invader</b> and an old Apple Computer icon, sold for HK$562,500 ($72,000).|$|E

5|$|<b>Invader</b> {{sees himself}} as a hacker of public space {{spreading}} a virus of mosaic. He believes that museums and galleries are not accessible to everyone, so deliberately makes his works public by installing them at street level for ordinary people to enjoy on a daily basis.|$|E
5|$|A legend {{developed}} that England would not fall {{to a foreign}} <b>invader</b> {{as long as there}} were ravens at the Tower of London; although this is often thought to be an ancient belief, the official Tower of London historian, Geoff Parnell, believes that this is actually a romantic Victorian invention.|$|E

50|$|Taubman {{felt like}} the move was a foregone conclusion. As a result, after the merger between the Oakland <b>Invaders</b> and the Oklahoma Outlaws collapsed, Taubman quietly {{approached}} <b>Invaders</b> owner Tad Taube about a possible merger with his Panthers. When the league owners met to vote on moving to the fall, Taubman sent his son with a message for the commissioner—if the teams voted {{to move to the}} fall, the Panthers would merge with the <b>Invaders,</b> with the <b>Invaders</b> as the surviving team. When the vote to play in the fall passed, the Panthers and <b>Invaders</b> announced their merger, with Taubman as majority owner of the <b>Invaders.</b>|$|R

5|$|<b>Invader</b> works incognito, often masked {{and largely}} at night. To guard his {{anonymity}} on camera during interviews, he pixellates {{his own image}} or wears a mask as a disguise. He claims {{that only a few}} people know his real name and his face, and that his parents think he works as a tiler in the construction industry.|$|E
5|$|Polistes exclamans live {{in social}} nests that are open combed. This leaves nests very {{susceptible}} to attacks by predators and by parasitoids. Attack by parasitoids {{will occur in}} the nest brood, as the <b>invader</b> will attempt to insert its own offspring into the host’s nest. The two most common parasitoids are Chalcoela iphitalis and Elasmus polistis.|$|E
