5|$|<b>Financial</b> <b>integration</b> among {{industrialized nations}} grew {{substantially}} during the 1980s and 1990s, as did liberalization of their capital accounts. Integration among financial markets and banks rendered {{benefits such as}} greater productivity and the broad sharing of risk in the macroeconomy. The resulting interdependence also carried a substantive cost in terms of shared vulnerabilities and increased exposure to systemic risks. Accompanying <b>financial</b> <b>integration</b> in recent decades was a succession of deregulation, in which countries increasingly abandoned regulations over the behavior of financial intermediaries and simplified requirements of disclosure {{to the public and}} to regulatory authorities. As economies became more open, nations became increasingly exposed to external shocks. Economists have argued greater worldwide <b>financial</b> <b>integration</b> has resulted in more volatile capital flows, thereby increasing the potential for financial market turbulence. Given greater integration among nations, a systemic crisis in one can easily infect others. The 1980s and 1990s saw a wave of currency crises and sovereign defaults, including the 1987 Black Monday stock market crashes, 1992 European Monetary System crisis, 1994 Mexican peso crisis, 1997 Asian currency crisis, 1998 Russian financial crisis, and the 1998–2002 Argentine peso crisis. These crises differed in terms of their breadth, causes, and aggravations, among which were capital flights brought about by speculative attacks on fixed exchange rate currencies perceived to be mispriced given a nation's fiscal policy, self-fulfilling speculative attacks by investors expecting other investors to follow suit given doubts about a nation's currency peg, lack of access to developed and functioning domestic capital markets in emerging market countries, and current account reversals during conditions of limited capital mobility and dysfunctional banking systems.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the market}} {{turbulence}} of the 1990s financial crises and September 11 {{attacks on the}} U.S. in 2001, <b>financial</b> <b>integration</b> intensified among developed nations and emerging markets, with substantial growth in capital flows among banks and in the trading of financial derivatives and structured finance products. Worldwide international capital flows grew from $3 trillion to $11 trillion U.S. dollars from 2002 to 2007, primarily {{in the form of}} short-term money market instruments. The United States experienced growth in the size and complexity of firms engaged in a broad range of financial services across borders {{in the wake of the}} Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act of 1999 which repealed the Glass–Steagall Act of 1933, ending limitations on commercial banks' investment banking activity. Industrialized nations began relying more on foreign capital to finance domestic investment opportunities, resulting in unprecedented capital flows to advanced economies from developing countries, as reflected by global imbalances which grew to 6% of gross world product in 2007 from 3% in 2001.|$|E
5|$|RIRP {{rests on}} several assumptions, {{including}} efficient markets, no country risk premia, and zero {{change in the}} expected real exchange rate. The parity condition suggests that real interest rates will equalize between countries and that capital mobility will result in capital flows that eliminate opportunities for arbitrage. There exists strong evidence that RIRP holds tightly among emerging markets in Asia and also Japan. The half-life period of deviations from RIRP have been examined by researchers and found to be roughly six or seven months, but between two and three months for certain countries. Such variation in the half-lives of deviations may be reflective of differences {{in the degree of}} <b>financial</b> <b>integration</b> among the country groups analyzed. RIRP does not hold over short time horizons, but empirical evidence has demonstrated that it generally holds well across long time horizons of five to ten years.|$|E
40|$|Given the {{importance}} of economic integration and the concern for macroeconomic stabilisation, {{it is important to}} understand how increasing integration alters the effectiveness of government policy tools. This paper aims to determine how increasing goods and <b>financial</b> market <b>integration</b> changes the effectiveness of fiscal and monetary policy. Expansionary monetary and fiscal policies are analysed under different degrees of goods and <b>financial</b> market <b>integration</b> in a dynamic general equilibrium framework. Imperfect goods market integration is represented by the presence of pricing-to-market behaviour by firms and imperfect <b>financial</b> market <b>integration</b> is represented by agents facing adjustment costs to foreign asset stock changes. Simulations show that the effectiveness of fiscal and monetary policy change significantly depending on the presence of incompletely integrated goods and/or financial markets. While <b>financial</b> market <b>integration</b> increases the effectiveness of monetary policy, it diminishes the effectiveness of fiscal policy. Goods market integration increases the effectiveness of both monetary and fiscal policy.

5|$|Each of {{the core}} {{economic}} functions, consumption, production, and investment, have become highly globalized in recent decades. While consumers increasingly import foreign goods or purchase domestic goods produced with foreign inputs, businesses continue to expand production internationally to meet an increasingly globalized consumption in the world economy. International <b>financial</b> <b>integration</b> among nations has afforded investors the opportunity to diversify their asset portfolios by investing abroad. Consumers, multinational corporations, individual and institutional investors, and financial intermediaries (such as banks) are the key economic actors within the global financial system. Central banks (such as the European Central Bank or the U.S. Federal Reserve System) undertake open market operations {{in their efforts to}} realize monetary policy goals. International financial institutions such as the Bretton Woods institutions, multilateral development banks and other development finance institutions provide emergency financing to countries in crisis, provide risk mitigation tools to prospective foreign investors, and assemble capital for development finance and poverty reduction initiatives. Trade organizations such as the World Trade Organization, Institute of International Finance, and the World Federation of Exchanges attempt to ease trade, facilitate trade disputes and address economic affairs, promote standards, and sponsor research and statistics publications.|$|E
5|$|The global {{financial}} crisis precipitated in 2007 and 2008 shared {{some of the}} key features exhibited by the wave of international financial crises in the 1990s, including accelerated capital influxes, weak regulatory frameworks, relaxed monetary policies, herd behavior during investment bubbles, collapsing asset prices, and massive deleveraging. The systemic problems originated in the United States and other advanced nations. Similarly to the 1997 Asian crisis, the global crisis entailed broad lending by banks undertaking unproductive real estate investments as well as poor standards of corporate governance within financial intermediaries. Particularly in the United States, the crisis was characterized by growing securitization of non-performing assets, large fiscal deficits, and excessive financing in the housing sector. While the real estate bubble in the U.S. triggered the financial crisis, the bubble was financed by foreign capital flowing from many different countries. As its contagious effects began infecting other nations, the crisis became a precursor for the global economic downturn now referred to as the Great Recession. In the wake of the crisis, total volume of world trade in goods and services fell 10% from 2008 to 2009 and did not recover until 2011, with an increased concentration in emerging market countries. The {{global financial}} crisis demonstrated the negative effects of worldwide <b>financial</b> <b>integration,</b> sparking discourse on how and whether some countries should decouple themselves from the system altogether.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, a {{newly elected}} {{government}} in Greece revealed the falsification of its national budget data, {{and that its}} fiscal deficit for the year was 12.7% of GDP {{as opposed to the}} 3.7% espoused by the previous administration. This news alerted markets to the fact that Greece's deficit exceeded the eurozone's maximum of 3% outlined in the Economic and Monetary Union's Stability and Growth Pact. Investors concerned about a possible sovereign default rapidly sold Greek bonds. Given Greece's prior decision to embrace the euro as its currency, it no longer held monetary policy autonomy and could not intervene to depreciate a national currency to absorb the shock and boost competitiveness, as was the traditional solution to sudden capital flight. The crisis proved contagious when it spread to Portugal, Italy, and Spain (together with Greece these are collectively referred to as the PIGS). Ratings agencies downgraded these countries' debt instruments in 2010 which further increased the costliness of refinancing or repaying their national debts. The crisis continued to spread and soon grew into a European sovereign debt crisis which threatened economic recovery {{in the wake of the}} Great Recession. In tandem with the IMF, the European Union members assembled a €750 billion bailout for Greece and other afflicted nations. Additionally, the ECB pledged to purchase bonds from troubled eurozone nations in an effort to mitigate the risk of a banking system panic. The crisis is recognized by economists as highlighting the depth of <b>financial</b> <b>integration</b> in Europe, contrasted with the lack of fiscal integration and political unification necessary to prevent or decisively respond to crises. During the initial waves of the crisis, the public speculated that the turmoil could result in a disintegration of the eurozone and an abandonment of the euro. German Federal Minister of Finance Wolfgang Schäuble called for the expulsion of offending countries from the eurozone. Now commonly referred to as the Eurozone crisis, it has been ongoing since 2009 and most recently began encompassing the 2012–13 Cypriot financial crisis.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} <b>financial</b> markets <b>integration</b> on welfare in a monetary union and a flexible exchange rate regime. A two-country dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with sticky prices as well as country-specific technology–, government spending – and money demand shocks is employed. It turns out that for both regimes, welfare is higher under high – than under low <b>financial</b> markets <b>integration,</b> yet the difference between high – and low integration is less pronounced for a monetary union. Thus, a monetary union has a comparative advantage under low <b>financial</b> markets <b>integration</b> whereas the opposite holds under high integration. This finding is robust {{over a wide range}} of parameter values. Moreover, under the benchmark parametrization, the degree of <b>financial</b> markets <b>integration</b> is pivotal for the absolute welfare ranking of the two regimes. This result, however, is sensitive to how aggressive monetary authorities react to the output gap and off-target inflation. ...|$|R

500|$|The {{introduction}} of the euro seems to have had a strong effect on European <b>financial</b> <b>integration.</b> According to a study on this question, it has [...] "significantly reshaped the European financial system, especially with respect to the securities markets [...] However, the real and policy barriers to integration in the retail and corporate banking sectors remain significant, even if the wholesale end of banking has been largely integrated." [...] Specifically, the euro has significantly decreased the cost of trade in bonds, equity, and banking assets within the eurozone. On a global level, there is evidence that the {{introduction of}} the euro has led to an integration in terms of investment in bond portfolios, with eurozone countries lending and borrowing more between each other than with other countries.|$|E
500|$|The global {{financial}} crisis and Great Recession prompted renewed {{discourse on the}} architecture of the {{global financial}} system. These events called to attention <b>financial</b> <b>integration,</b> inadequacies of global governance, and the emergent systemic risks of financial globalization. Since the establishment in 1945 of a formal international monetary system with the IMF empowered as its guardian, the world has undergone extensive changes politically and economically. This has fundamentally altered the paradigm in which international financial institutions operate, increasing the complexities of the IMF and World Bank's mandates. The lack of adherence to a formal monetary system has created a void of global constraints on national macroeconomic policies and a deficit of rule-based governance of financial activities. French economist and Executive Director of the World Economic Forum's Reinventing Bretton Woods Committee, Marc Uzan, has pointed out that some radical proposals such as a [...] "global central bank or a world financial authority" [...] have been deemed impractical, leading to further consideration of medium-term efforts to improve transparency and disclosure, strengthen emerging market financial climates, bolster prudential regulatory environments in advanced nations, and better moderate capital account liberalization and exchange rate regime selection in emerging markets. He has also drawn attention to calls for increased participation from the private sector in the management of financial crises and the augmenting of multilateral institutions' resources.|$|E

50|$|Because of {{financial}} market imperfections, <b>financial</b> <b>integration</b> in neighboring, regional and/or global economies is therefore imperfect. For example, the imperfect <b>financial</b> <b>integration</b> can {{stem from the}} inequality of the marginal rate of substitutions of different agents. In addition to financial market imperfections, legal restrictions can also hinder <b>financial</b> <b>integration.</b> Therefore, <b>financial</b> <b>integration</b> can also be achieved from the elimination of restrictions pertaining to cross-border financial operations to allow (a) financial institutions to operate freely, (b) permit businesses to directly raise funds or borrow and (c) equity and bond investors to invest across the state line with fewer without imposing any restrictions. However, {{it is important to}} note that many of the legal restrictions exist because of the market imperfections that hinder <b>financial</b> <b>integration.</b> Legal restrictions are sometimes second-best devices for dealing with the market imperfections that limit <b>financial</b> <b>integration.</b> Consequently, removing the legal restrictions can make the world economy become worse off.In addition, <b>financial</b> <b>integration</b> of neighboring, regional and/or global economies can take place through a formal international treaty which the governing bodies of these economies agree to cooperate to address regional and/or global financial disturbances through regulatory and policy responses. The extent to which <b>financial</b> <b>integration</b> is measured includes gross capital flows, stocks of foreign assets and liabilities, degree of co-movement of stock returns, degree of dispersion of world-wide real interest rates, and financial openness. Also there are views that not gross capital flows (capital inflow plus capital outflow), but bilateral capital flows determine <b>financial</b> <b>integration</b> of a country, which disregards capital surplus and capital deficit amounts. For instance, a county with only capital inflow and no capital outflow will be considered not financially integrated.|$|E

5000|$|Benefits of <b>financial</b> <b>integration</b> include {{efficient}} capital allocation, better governance, higher {{investment and}} growth, and risk-sharing. Levine [...] (2001) shows that <b>financial</b> <b>integration</b> helps strengthen domestic financial sector allowing for more efficient capital allocation and greater investment and growth opportunities. As {{a result of}} <b>financial</b> <b>integration,</b> efficiency gains can also be generated among domestics firms {{because they have to}} compete directly with foreign rivals; this competition can lead to better corporate governance (Kose et al., 2006). If having access to a broader base of capital is a major engine for economic growth, then <b>financial</b> <b>integration</b> is one of the solutions because it facilitates flows of capital from developed economies with rich capital to developing economies with limited capital. These capital inflows can significantly reduce the cost of capital in capital-poor economies leading to higher investment (Kose et al., 2006). Likewise, <b>financial</b> <b>integration</b> can help capital-poor countries diversify away from their production bases that mostly depend on agricultural activities or extractions of natural resources; this diversification should reduce macroeconomic volatility (Kose et al., 2006). <b>Financial</b> <b>integration</b> can also help predict consumption volatility because consumers are risk-averse who have a desire to use financial markets as the insurance for their income risk, so the impact of temporary idiosyncratic shocks to income growth on consumption growth can be softened. Stronger comoverment of consumption growth across the globe can also be a results of <b>financial</b> <b>integration</b> (Kose et al., 2006). Furthermore, <b>financial</b> <b>integration</b> can also provide great benefits for international risk-sharing (Lewis, 1999; Obstfeld, 1994; van Wincoop, 1999 [...] ).|$|E

30|$|The {{results of}} the study have {{important}} implications for economic policy makers and investors. For economic policy makers, the information about volatility spillover between financial markets would be of greater interest for them for economic stability because <b>financial</b> market <b>integrations</b> imply <b>financial</b> sector <b>integration,</b> so the policy makers need to design such policies which would safeguard the financial sector from the international financial shocks.

The results of this study are also important for investors, who want to make efficient portfolios and make capital budgeting decisions in the selected markets. The institutional and individual investors can benefit from portfolio diversification by investing in non-correlated markets which will reduce their risk and enhance their returns.
