2500|$|Music {{educator}} and therapist Helen Lindquist Bonny (1921 – May 25, 2010) developed an approach influenced by humanistic and transpersonal psychological views, {{known as the}} Bonny method of <b>guided</b> <b>imagery</b> in music (GIM). <b>Guided</b> <b>imagery</b> refers to a technique used in natural and alternative medicine that involves using mental imagery {{to help with the}} physiological and psychological ailments of patients. The practitioner often suggests a relaxing and focusing image and through the use of imagination and discussion, aims to find constructive solutions to manage their problems. Bonny applied this psychotherapeutic method to the field of music therapy by using music as the means of guiding the patient to a higher state of consciousness where healing and constructive self- awareness can take place. Music is considered a [...] "co-therapist" [...] because of its importance. GIM with children can be used in one-on-one or group settings, and involves relaxation techniques, identification and sharing of personal feeling states, and improvisation to discover the self, and foster growth. The choice of music is carefully selected for the client based on their musical preferences and the goals of the session. Usually a classical piece, it must reflect the age and attentional abilities of the child in length and genre, and a full explanation of the exercises must be offered at their level of understanding.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Guided</b> motor <b>imagery</b> {{and cross}} {{education}} are two concepts that build upon motor programs. <b>Guided</b> motor <b>imagery</b> consists of imagining a specific action, thereby activating the respective motor program without an actual movement. Cross education incorporates contralateral training {{to activate the}} motor program of an action to the resting limb. These techniques yield neurological actions {{that can lead to}} improved performance outcomes when integrated into physical therapy programs. PURPOSE: This literature review investigated <b>guided</b> motor <b>imagery</b> and cross education within the scientific literature, identified and summarized evident themes and provided suggestions for incorporating these methods into rehabilitation programs. METHODS: An electronic search was conducted of peer-reviewed articles on <b>guided</b> motor <b>imagery</b> and cross education and their relation to rehabilitation. DISCUSSION: Despite the paucity of research, evidence exists for the effectiveness of these methods and provides insights regarding how these techniques may be successfully integrated into physical therapy regimens.

40|$|The {{scientific}} study of sexual desire {{is characterized by a}} series of unconnected mini-theories and dissimilar empirical findings. This research develops a functional theory which deconstructs sexual desire to include two conceptually meaningful variables which comprise a person 2 ̆ 7 s “bifurcated lovemap:” an emotional disposition toward fantasy and an emotional disposition toward interpersonal relationships. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the relationship between objectified, i. e., depersonalized, sexual fantasies and interpersonal attachments, specifically investigating the “personal bias” held toward objectified fantasies among people with chronic hypersexuality, e. g., sexual addiction/compulsivity and the internal working models these persons hold toward “comfortable interpersonal attachments. ” A quantitative analysis suggests that 22 (N = 22) self-identified sexual addicts were able to reduce the power of their objectified fantasies and increase their ‘underdeveloped’ sense comfort with interpersonal relationships by experiencing imagery restructuring exercises in the form of <b>guided</b> <b>imageries.</b> A thorough analysis of the data allowed for the emergence of an axiom associated with the two relevant variables: As comfort toward interpersonal relationships increases, the negative power of objectified fantasies is diminished. This study is of special significance as it provides a pragmatic model which is able to link praxis with theory. Further, the results suggest that objectified fantasies are normative, purposeful and enduring and that the meta-communication underlying their symbolic form is a mythical allegory which allows for perceived responsiveness and affirmation. As a means to support this theory 2 ̆ 7 s coherence, I suggest that future research be directed toward persons with sexually avoidant behaviors. This would assist in the development of an elegant theory related to the variable nature of sexual desire which is able to link both measurable variables and clear-cut points of intervention to the diversity of its expression when it obstructs humanistic expression. ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Metaphors {{are used}} in {{everyday}} language and {{play a role in}} the therapeutic domain.

While metaphors have long been part of traditional healing methods, clinicians of diverse orientations are rediscovering their use in therapy. Erickson (1935; 1944) arid Kopp (1971; 1972) made significant contributions to the acceptance of this therapeutic technique.

40|$|In a {{previous}} study we showed that healthy highly hypnotizable subjects, during {{the suggestion of a}} moderately unpleasant situation administered in awake conditions, exhibited a sympathetic response greatly attenuated with respect to non-hypnotizable individuals. This was interpreted as a natural protection of hypnotizable subjects against the cardiovascular effects of cognitive stress. Aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate whether the hypnotic trait is able to modulate the autonomic and cerebral activities also in specific phobic awake hypnotizable (Highs) and non-hypnotizable (Lows) subjects. Electroencephalogram, electrooculogram, electromiogram of corrugator muscle, electrocardiogram, respirogram and tonic electrodermal activity were recorded during a <b>guided</b> mental <b>imagery</b> of an animal phobic object. Phobic stimulation induced in both groups the rise of heart and respiratory frequency and the lowering of skin resistance. These changes are less pronounced in Highs than in Lows and are sustained by a different modulation of the sympatho-vagal balance. During phobic stimulation both groups exhibited a similar significant increase of EEG gamma relative power. At variance, significant stimulation-related decrements of alpha 1, theta 1 and theta 2 activities were found only in Highs that exhibited similar changes during the control and phobic stimulation. Results suggest that hypnotizability is able to modulate cerebral and autonomic responses also in specific phobic subjects. However, the presence of a specific phobia attenuates the effectiveness of hypnotizability as a protective factor against possible stress-related cardiac illness...|$|R
40|$|There {{is strong}} {{evidence}} that focussing on the goal of an action improves performance relative to focussing on the concrete motor behaviours. The current study tests whether blind action <b>guided</b> by <b>imagery</b> relies on the same foci of attention. Thirty female participants took part in an experiment. In each condition there were 20 trials, {{they were asked to}} close their eyes and draw a straight line between two landmarks on a graphics tablet. We instructed them, in three conditions, to focus on (1) mental imagery of the goal landmark (external focus of attention), (2) drawing a straight line with the fingers (internal focus), or (3) without a specific focus of attention (control). We tested to what extent these attention instructions affected drawing performance, in terms of both deviations of the participants’ lines from an ideal straight line, and the time it took to complete the line. The study revealed that the manipulation specifically affected the deviation measure and that an external focus of attention was better than an internal focus and the control condition. These findings reveal that that mental imagery during blind action relies on same processes as actual performance. These data give perceptual representations of a direct role in motor control. They will be related to current theories of action control (constrained action hypothesis, ideomotor theories, and dual task accounts) ...|$|R
