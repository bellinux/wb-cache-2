50|$|Although drivers {{experimented with}} the use of <b>front</b> <b>spoilers,</b> the 1990s saw {{manufacturer}} bringing them into production, when Tenth Technology introduced the Predator in early 1994 that was sold with them followed by the Team Losi XXX with its optional High Downforce Wing Kit. Later in the decade saw a migration of indoor venues and high-grip clay tracks which saw an emphasis on aerodynamics which was expected to benefit <b>front</b> <b>spoilers</b> but they were slow to catch on until recently (as in 2015) for 2WD buggies.|$|R
50|$|The goal of many {{spoilers}} used in {{passenger vehicles}} {{is to reduce}} drag and increase fuel efficiency. Passenger vehicles can be equipped with <b>front</b> and rear <b>spoilers.</b> <b>Front</b> <b>spoilers,</b> found beneath the bumper, are mainly used to decrease the amount of air going underneath the vehicle to reduce the drag coefficient and lift.|$|R
50|$|Another popular {{cosmetic}} upgrade {{were the}} AMG body kits. These ranged from subtle <b>front</b> <b>spoilers,</b> to an aggressive Wide Body kits for the W126 coupes.

50|$|In 1979 the Marina {{received}} a facelift and the BL O-Series OHC 1.7-litre engine; however, {{at the time}} the Marina name was held in low regard by the New Zealand public, and was dropped completely, the car being renamed Morris 1700. The Morris 1700 had high equipment levels and included <b>front</b> <b>spoilers</b> and driving lights on all models. The related van and pickup models were renamed Morris 575.|$|R

25|$|The GT's styling went wilder {{again with}} a 'Shaker' cold-air {{induction}} scoop protruding from {{a hole in the}} bonnet, which now sported twin wide GT stripes from grille to windscreen, rather than the bonnet blackouts of the XW. The thick side stripes remained, although altered slightly, as did the twin driving lights and blacked-out panel between the tail lights.

50|$|In 1975, all Manta and 1900 {{models were}} {{equipped}} with the Bosch L-Jetronic fuel injection in the United States due to emission regulations. Yet in Europe this feature was only available on the high-end GT/E models, which also sported fog lamps and lower <b>front</b> <b>spoilers,</b> which were not offered {{on any of the}} U.S. spec Manta models. Also of note is that the 1974-75 Opel Manta models had large aluminium 5 mph bumpers to comply with U.S. crash standards of the time; the European Mantas did not receive the large bumpers.|$|R

25|$|A sportier {{version of}} the 200B sedan was {{released}} in June 1978. The new SX featured a revised grille, <b>front</b> <b>spoiler,</b> alloy wheels, revised door and seat trim (striped seat inserts) and tachometer, while the suspension was altered to improve handling. The colours available for this model were simply blue, white or red, and the only transmission available was a 4-speed floor shift. Significantly the SX was a unique model to Australia, the added input from Nissan's Australian design engineers signified {{a step away from}} just assembling cars. This in turn led to the locally built Datsuns, and later Nissans, being re-engineered to better suit Australian conditions, with many components being sourced locally a tradition that would continue right up until 1992, when Nissan ceased local manufacture.|$|E
25|$|The final HZ Sandman, {{featured}} {{a choice of}} V8 engines only, along with a four-headlight grille and under bumper <b>front</b> <b>spoiler.</b> According to a GMH Price List dated 25 January 1979, a basic HZ Holden panel van was priced at A$6,076, with the Sandman option package an additional A$1,700. The further optional components also included 5.0-litre V8 engine and a limited slip differential. If a buyer selected every Sandman extra, the price {{would be more than}} 150percent {{of the cost of the}} basic HZ model. By the end of 1979, the Sandman had largely lost its place in the contemporary Australian youth cultureâ€”order figures were down and many of the vehicles were now being sold with the stripes and tailgate logos deleted. The Sandman ute was phased out of production prior to the van, the last of which was manufactured around October 1979.|$|E
25|$|In 1970, the GSX {{option was}} {{available}} in only two colors, Saturn Yellow and Apollo White (in 1971 and 1972 6 other colors were available for the GSX). Came with only full black interior.

The C-pillar ventilation outlets were moved to {{each side of the}} rear screen. Inside there were a redesigned dashboard and instrumentation, new door panels and the check control panel from the Quadrifoglio Oro on all models. Top of the range models adopted an overhead console, which extended for the full length of the roof and housed three reading spot lamps, a central ceiling light, and controls for the electric windows. Alongside the facelift two new models were introduced: the 2.4 Turbo Diesel, which in most markets gradually replaced the previous 2.0-litre which was instead installed in the marginally smaller Giulietta. There was also a renewed two-liter Quadrifoglio Oro, equipped with electronic fuel injection. Thanks to the Bosch Motronic integrated electronic fuel injection and ignition the QO had the same 130PS output of the carburetted 2.0, while developing more torque and being more fuel efficient.|$|E

2500|$|In the race, the #1 car {{suffered}} broken front shock-absorbers and a slipping clutch, and {{the engine}} burned oil. Witzenburg reported the brakes and both front shocks [...] "all but gone" [...] in #2 â€” pumping the brakes dragged the <b>front</b> <b>spoiler,</b> but {{had little effect on}} speed. Moreover, since the AMXs were [...] "rather crude" [...] compared with the smaller, lighter cars they were racing against, they lost time in the turns. Nevertheless, Witzenburg said the cars [...] "ran great," [...] especially on the straights where they reached about [...]|$|E
2500|$|At mid-season, a GT package became {{available}} with a <b>front</b> <b>spoiler</b> and flared wheel openings {{as on the}} 1978 AMX.
