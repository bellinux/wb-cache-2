In this process, the high-pressure gas jet is used to disintegrate the molten metal stream in to the spherical powders. Due to hydrodynamic and thermal interaction between high-pressure gas jet and molten metal stream especially near melt <b>delivery</b> <b>nozzle,</b> this technique is very complex and challenging for atomization industries. Melt <b>delivery</b> <b>nozzle</b> design {{is one of the}} key factors to control powders properties. The optical Schlieren technique and analogue water atomizer along with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) numerical methods are practical methods for observing the single or two-phase flow of gas-metal interaction during CCGA. This research is focused on the optical Schlieren and numerical CFD techniques to observe single-phase gas flow behaviour with different melt nozzles tip design and gas dies profile. The CFD numerical results are validated by the experimental Schlieren test results. The effect of melt tip design on open to closed-wake condition near melt nozzle was investigated. Comparing the CFD velocity field and velocity streamlines of different nozzle design at different atomization gas pressure could help to propose a new hypothesis of how open to closed-wake condition occurs at different nozzle tip design. In addition, the flow separation problem around melt nozzle by two different gas die systems was investigated.

These factors significantly affect the process and are also important input parameters for any finite element or analytical models of the melt pool and deposition tracks. The analytical model in this paper presents a method to calculate laser attenuation and powder temperatures at every point below such a nozzle. It is applicable to laser beams that are approximately parallel over the beam -powder interaction distance of any initial intensity distribution (Top Hat, Gaussian, TEM 01 * or other). The volume below the nozzle is divided into the region above the powder consolidation plane, where the powder stream is annular, and below it, where it is a single Gaussian stream, and expressions derived for each region. Modelled and measured results are reasonably matched. Results indicate that attenuation is more severe once the annular powder stream has consolidated into a single stream but is not zero before that point.

40|$|Ultra-precision diamond turning {{can deliver}} very {{accurate}} form, often less than 100 nm P-V. A possible manufacturing method for thin Wolter type- 1 mirrors in hard X-ray space telescopes thus involves generating electroless nickel plated mandrels by diamond turning, before coating {{them with a}} reflective film and substrate. However, the surface texture after turning falls far short from the requirements of X-ray and EUV applications. The machining marks need to be removed, with hand polishing still widely employed. There is thus a compelling need for automated finishing of turned dies. A two step finishing method is presented that combines fluid jet and precessed bonnet polishing on a common 7 -axis CNC platform. This method is capable of finishing diamond turned electroless nickel plated dies down to 0. 28 nm rms roughness, while deterministically improving form error down to 30 nm P-V. The fluid jet polishing process, which consists of pressurizing water and abrasive particles for <b>delivery</b> through a <b>nozzle,</b> has been specially optimized with a newly designed slurry delivery unit and computer simulations, to remove diamond turning marks without introducing another waviness signature.

40|$|The main {{aim of this}} {{research}} work is investigate into coolant delivery system {{in order to develop}} a radically new generation of parametric multi-purpose nozzle system, which incorporate a dual/triple flow coupled system to deliver a low volume, low pressure fluid for both conventional and MQL coolant applications in grinding process with step-up pressure. The investigation aimed to show through design, simulation and experimental study the possibility of a step change in the amount of cutting fluid used in grinding by combining positive aspects of MQL and conventional nozzles, to come up with high performance universal nozzle and draw its characteristics via measurement in terms of jet velocity, trends of coherence length, and fluid flow patterns. To achieve this, aim a new concept termed ‘Nested Nozzles’ was designed and implemented giving birth to a new approach to fluid delivery that is “Dual/Triple Fluid Configurable Delivery”. It is demonstrated {{here for the first time}} that by nesting a nozzle in the cavity of another one can step up the inlet pressure by a factor, thus eliminating the need of high pressure supply. The nested nozzle acts as a flow conditioner creating a laminar flow; also in addition the flow through this nested nozzle accelerates the primary flow, thus inducing a stepping effect in the velocity. Besides flow conditioning, pressure and velocity step-up effect, the nested nozzle offers the supply of one or two fluids either alone or in combination. This, together with the main nozzle allows for dual/triple fluid delivery and their combination The relationship between the flows and the pressures in the main and nested nozzles was investigated and an optimized design emerged with a modular configurable multi-purpose nozzle. Here with a single nozzle one could apply conventional flood cooling with reduced fluid requirement, MQL or multiple fluid <b>deliveries.</b> The <b>nozzle</b> exit aperture can be flexibly configured based on the application need from 0. 3 mm up to 0. 7 mm. A wide range of simulations was undertaken in SolidWorks CFD and ANSYS CFX software packages. Air, oil, water and their mixtures were used as cooling media. The results revealed the flow behaviour intra-nozzle and externally where the fluid exited the nozzle aperture. The jet coherency length was estimated from these simulations along with velocity profiles. An attempt was made in simulating Wheel-Nozzle-Workpiece subsystem to show the interaction of the three elements. A test rig was set up using a surface grinding machine, which was modified and instrumented with 3 -axis digital readout, data acquisition system with LabVIEW software and sensors with Pitot tube. The results of the measurement reveal fundamentally new behaviour of the fluid that has not recorded earlier. In a three-layered measurement across nozzle aperture and along the stream, it was found that the fluid velocity after exiting the nozzle increased from top layer to bottom layer, however decreased monotony down the stream. A conical core of fluid keeping original exit velocity was observed in the centre of the jet. These two key finding gave an indication as to where to position the workpiece (grinding contact zone) and the orientation of the nozzle relative to the cutting zone. It is therefore suggested that the bottom third of the jet be directed into the contact zone whilst the top two third be aimed at the wheel. As this work has only answered some questions in fluid application, it has conversely open numerous questions yet to be investigated, therefore, recommendations for further studies are given along with some initial ideas and directions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Soda lime {{glass is}} used {{extensively}} in camera lens, micro gas turbines, light bulbs, tablewares, optics, and chemical apparatus owing to its high hardness, excellent optical properties, and good corrosion and chemical resistance. Such applications of {{soda lime glass}} demand high machining and finishing precision. On the other hand, machining of glass poses significant challenges due to its inherent brittleness. The process of removal of material from glass, if not done in ductile mode, can generate subsurface cracks and brittle fractures which have adverse effects on its functionality. This research investigates the high speed micro-end milling of soda lime glass {{in order to obtain}} ductile regime machining. It has been found by other researchers that ductile mode machining can avoid sub-surface cracks and brittle fractures. However, in ductile mode machining, the gummy chips settle permanently on the machined surface affecting adversely the surface finish. In order to avoid such chip settlement, compressed air was directed using a special air <b>delivery</b> <b>nozzle</b> to blow away the resultant gummy chips, thereby preventing them from settling on the machined surface.

For adoption of this technology in the manufacturing environment, further understanding is required to ensure robust components with appropriate properties are routinely fabricated. This requires a complete understanding of the thermal history during part fabrication and control of this behavior. This paper will describe research to understand the thermal behavior for the Laser Engineered Net Shaping (LENS) process, where a component is fabricated by focusing a laser beam onto a substrate to create a molten pool in which powder particles are simultaneously injected to build each layer. The substrate is moved beneath the laser beam to deposit a thin cross section, thereby creating the desired geometry for each layer. After deposition of each layer, the powder <b>delivery</b> <b>nozzle</b> and focusing lens assembly is incremented in the positive Z-direction, thereby building a three dimensional component layer additively.

40|$|In {{proton therapy}} {{delivered}} with range modulated beams, the energy spectrum of protons entering the <b>delivery</b> <b>nozzle</b> {{can affect the}} dose uniformity within the target region and the dose gradient around its periphery. For a cyclotron with a fixed extraction energy, a rangeshifter is used to change the energy but this produces increasing energy spreads for decreasing energies. This study investigated {{the magnitude of the}} effects of different energy spreads on dose uniformity and distal edge dose gradient and determined the limits for controlling the incident spectrum. A multilayer Faraday cup (MLFC) was calibrated against depth dose curves measured in water for nonmodulated beams with various incident spectra. Depth dose curves were measured in a water phantom and in a multilayer ionization chamber detector for modulated beams using different incident energy spreads. Some nozzle entrance energy spectra can produce unacceptable dose nonuniformities of up to ± 21 % over the modulated region. For modulated beams and small beam ranges, the width of the distal penumbra can vary by a factor of 2. 5. When the energy spread was controlled within the defined limits, the dose nonuniformity was less than ± 3 %. To facilitate understanding of the results, the data were compared to the measured and Monte Carlo calculated data from a variable extraction energy synchrotron which has a narrow spectrum for all energies. Dose uniformity is only maintained within prescription limits when the energy spread is controlled. At low energies, a large spread can be beneficial for extending the energy range at which a single range modulator device can be used. An MLFC can be used as part of a feedback to provide specified energy spreads for different energies...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSince {{the late}} 1980 ’s and the Montreal {{protocol}} on substances that deplete the ozone layer, fire safety has to replace halon compounds used for fire protection systems. As {{water is a}} well-known candidate, {{a significant amount of}} research has been carried out since and especially from present authors on water sprays/mists for radiative shielding [1 - 3]. Usually, the radiation comes from fire flames or high temperature walls and water curtains are then used for either firefighting or for protection of equipment and people. The present study is part of this framework and aims at assessing the radiative attenuation provided by various sprays investigated in the frame of French-Ukrainian cooperation. For the present work three different spraying devices were used: a full cone nozzle TG- 1 (delivering 0. 86 L. min- 1 under 4 bars) and two equivalent “sprinklers”with respective nozzle discharge coefficient (K-factor) of 4. 45 and 13. 6 L. min- 1. bars- 1 / 2. An experimental system was built up for the radiative attenuation investigations. It includes an extended blackbody used as the radiation source, a coupled FTIR spectrometer / IR camera for the infrared analysis and a pressurized vessel for the water <b>delivery</b> to the <b>nozzle.</b> The incident radiation coming from the blackbody crosses the water curtain and is then attenuated (due to absorption and scattering by droplets and vapour in air) during its path through the spray. The transmitted signal is finally recorded by the camera and the spectrometer. Nozzles were tested at various pressures suitable and flow rates. Attenuation measurements were conducted at several distances from the injection point. Experimental results were then compared to numerical results provided by the BERGAMOTE code developed by the authors. This code is used for the prediction of the radiation attenuation throughout a water spray by combining (1) an Eulerian-Lagrangian approach to simulate the two phase flow made of droplets and air, and (2) a Monte Carlo method to calculate the radiation attenuation by the resulting participating medium. A series of parameters and phenomena is involved in the simulation as input data, including droplet size distribution, flow rate, radiative properties of the spray, evaporation, turbulence and heat transfer. Therefore, the characteristics of the nozzles were determined first in terms of velocity and droplet size distribution using a two-dimensional PDPA device and an optical microscopy.

The main goal of this work is to better understand these techniques through experimental and numerical investigation and increase their technological maturity to aid industrial implementation. The thermal tensioning techniques investigated in this work are Thermal Tensioning by Cooling and Thermal Tensioning by Heating. The investigation for both techniques encompasses thermal source characterisation, application to different weld geometries and residual stress measurements and analysis of both butt and fillet welded samples. A detailed technology transfer study of Thermal Tensioning by Cooling {{was carried out in}} which different aspects of the application of TTC to arc welding (Gas Metal Arc Welding and Gas Tungsten Arc Welding) was examined. This study focused on the influence of both the liquid CO 2 delivery system installation and welding tooling and jigging on the effectiveness of Thermal Tensioning by Cooling in reducing buckling distortion. Experimental and numerical cooling source characterisation was also carried out in the Thermal Tensioning by Cooling work to investigate the characteristics of the cooling source under different cooling conditions. The Thermal Tensioning by Cooling work was then concluded with welding trials and residual stress measurement and analysis. The results of the Thermal Tensioning by Cooling study show that the installation of the liquid CO 2 delivery system as well as the welding tooling and jigging has a major influence on the effectiveness of Thermal Tensioning by Cooling in reducing buckling distortion. The cooling source characterisation work reveals that the most important parameter of the cryogenic <b>nozzle</b> <b>delivery</b> system used in this work is the Air Entrainment Gap. A description of a control system of Thermal Tensioning by Cooling is suggested based on controlling the Air Entrainment Gap.

The Thermal Tensioning by Heating investigation includes heat source characterisation, application of Thermal Tensioning by Heating on butt and fillet welds, utilisation of alternative heat sources and residual stress analysis. The results of these investigation show that Thermal Tensioning by Heating is also highly effective in eliminating buckling distortion in butt, fillet and overlapped panels.
