First, I propose a novel definition <b>of</b> <b>flexibility</b> in swarm robotics. Second, I present an approach to the formal verification <b>of</b> <b>flexibility</b> in swarm robotics systems using model checking.

Even though <b>flexibility</b> is one <b>of</b> the most important properties of swarm robotics systems, together with robustness and scalability, the definitions available in the literature are usually not precise and sometimes flexibility and adaptability are mixed together.

5|$|As a Postelsia alga grows, its stipe thickens in {{the same}} manner as a tree's trunk. The cells beneath the epidermis, called the meristoderm, divide rapidly to form rings of growth, again, like a tree. However, the greater <b>flexibility</b> <b>of</b> Postelsia stipe over that of a woody tree makes for some {{distinct}} differences. Postelsia must be thicker than a tree of equal height in order to support itself. However, the stipe is very much more suited to the coastal habitat, as it allows the seaweed to bend with the constant wave action. Such an environment would cause the inflexible, woody tree to break.|$|E

The contact calls of equines vary from the whinnying and nickering of the horse, the barking of plains zebras, and the braying of asses and Gr√©vy's zebras. Equines also communicate with visual displays and the <b>flexibility</b> <b>of</b> their lips allows them to make complex facial expressions.

The Harrier's capabilities were necessary in the Belize deployment, as it was the only RAF combat aircraft capable of safely operating from the airport's short runway; British forces had been stationed in Belize for several years due to tensions over a Guatemalan claim to Belizean territory; the forces were withdrawn in 1993, two years after Guatemala recognized the independence of Belize.|$|E

5|$|The Victor was {{commonly}} {{described as}} having good handling and excellent performance, along with favourable low speed flight characteristics. During the flight tests of the first prototype, the Victor proved its aerodynamic performance, flying up to Mach 0.98 without handling or buffeting problems; there were next to no aerodynamic changes between prototype and production aircraft. Production aircraft featured an automated nose-flap operation to counteract a tendency for the aircraft to pitch upwards during low-to-moderate Mach numbers. At low altitude, the Victor typically flew in a smooth and comfortable manner, {{in part due to}} its narrowness and <b>flexibility</b> <b>of</b> the crescent wing. One unusual flight characteristic of the early Victor was its self-landing capability; once lined up with the runway, the aircraft would naturally flare as the wing entered into ground effect while the tail continued to sink, giving a cushioned landing without any command or intervention by the pilot.|$|E
5|$|The <b>flexibility</b> <b>of</b> Brazilian FFVs {{empowers}} {{the consumers}} {{to choose the}} fuel depending on current market prices. As ethanol fuel economy is lower than gasoline because of ethanol's energy content is close to 34% less per unit volume than gasoline, flex cars running on ethanol get a lower mileage than when running on pure gasoline. However, this effect is partially offset by the usually lower price per liter of ethanol fuel. As a rule of thumb, Brazilian consumers are frequently advised by the media to use more alcohol than gasoline in their mix only when ethanol prices are 30% lower or more than gasoline, as ethanol price fluctuates heavily depending on the result of seasonal sugar cane harvests.|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} the rhetoric <b>of</b> <b>flexibility</b> has become {{increasingly}} influential within the UK's Higher Education (HE) sector.

5|$|This {{ability to}} provide {{real-time}} tissue loading data allows the computer to indicate the diver's current decompression obligation, and to update it for any permissible profile change, so the diver with a decompression ceiling {{does not have to}} decompress at any specific depth provided the ceiling is not violated, though the decompression rate will be affected by the depth. As a result, the diver can make a slower ascent than would be called for by a decompression schedule computed by the identical algorithm, as may suit the circumstances, and will be credited for gas elimination during the slower ascent, and penalized if necessary for additional ingassing for those tissues affected. This provides the diver with an unprecedented <b>flexibility</b> <b>of</b> dive profile while remaining within the safety envelope of the algorithm in use.|$|E
