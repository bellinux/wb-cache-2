The nuts are also a good source of cooking oil. The bract is used as a <b>bowl</b> <b>for</b> feeding <b>pigs.</b> The leaves are used for thatch and weaving, but only when the more common fan palms Sabal causiarum and Coccothrinax argentea are unavailable. It is also used as a source of lumber and as a boundary marker between farmers' fields due to its longevity and ability to survive hurricanes.|$|R
5000|$|Granite stones {{from the}} {{original}} bridge were subsequently [...] "presented to {{various parts of the}} British world to further historic links in the British Commonwealth of Nations". Two of these stones are in Canberra, the capital city of Australia, sited between the parallel spans of the Commonwealth Avenue Bridge, one of two major crossings of Lake Burley Griffin {{in the heart of the}} city. Stones from the bridge were also used to build a monument in Wellington, New Zealand, to Paddy the Wanderer, a dog that roamed the wharves from 1928 to 1939 and was befriended by seamen, watersiders, Harbour Board workers and taxi drivers. The monument, built in 1945, is on Queens Wharf, opposite the Museum of Wellington City & Sea. It includes a bronze likeness of Paddy, a drinking fountain and <b>drinking</b> <b>bowls</b> below <b>for</b> dogs. Another piece of the stone is situated under the sundial in the Wellington Boat Harbour Park, next to Clyde Quay Marina, an area of historical significance in Wellington Harbour.|$|R

5000|$|Paddy the Wanderer, {{according}} to a telephone call made to The Evening Post a day after his death, {{had been given to}} the daughter of Mrs. R. Gardner of Wellington by a horse trainer from Christchurch. After the child died, eleven years earlier, the dog ran away. According to Dianne Haworth's 2007 biography, the child had died of pneumonia; after her death, he wandered the Wellington Harbour and occasionally took trips on visiting ships. He had crossed the Tasman Sea many times, and had flown in a Gypsy Moth. He was rumoured to have made it to San Francisco and back. The Wellington Harbour Board adopted him under the formal title of Assistant Night Watchman, whose job it was to keep guard for [...] "pirates, smugglers and rodents." [...] Haworth also reports that apparently Paddy had almost fallen victim to a dognapping scheme perpetrated by jealous citizens of Auckland.He died on 17 July 1939 at Harbour Shed no. 1, apparently after a cold snap, and was taken to his funeral in a parade of twelve taxicabs and a traffic officer; {{according to}} Haworth, the city was brought to a standstill for the ceremony. The Ladies' auxiliary of the local SPCA took up donations in his name for a memorial. Including Haworth's 1997 Paddy the Wanderer, three biographies of the dog have been published. There is a monument to Paddy on Queens Wharf, opposite the Wellington Museum, including his bronze likeness, a drinking fountain and <b>drinking</b> <b>bowls</b> below <b>for</b> dogs. Erected in 1945, it was paid for by Paddy's many friends and includes stones from London's Waterloo Bridge, bombed during World War II.|$|R
