2500|$|The Mufti opposed all {{immigration}} of Jews into Palestine, {{and during the}} war he campaigned against the transfer of Jewish refugees to Palestine. No evidence has been forthcoming to show he was opposed to transferring Jews to countries outside the Middle East. The Mufti’s numerous letters appealing to various governmental authorities to prevent Jewish refugees from emigrating to Palestine have been republished and widely cited as documentary evidence of his participative support for the Nazi genocide. For instance, Husseini intervened on 13 May 1943, before the meeting with Himmler when he was informed of the Holocaust, with the German Foreign Office to block possible transfers of Jews from Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania to Palestine, after reports reached him that 4,000 Jewish children accompanied by 500 adults had managed to reach Palestine. He asked that the Foreign Minister [...] "to do his utmost" [...] to block all such proposals and this request was complied with. According to Idith Zertal, none of the documents presented at Eichmann's trial prove {{that it was the}} Mufti's interference, in these 'acts of total evil,' that prevented the children's rescue. [...] In June 1943 the Mufti recommended to the Hungarian minister {{that it would be better}} to send Jews in Hungary to concentration camps in Poland rather than let them find asylum in Palestine. [...] A year later, on 25 July 1944 [...] he wrote to the Hungarian foreign minister to register his objection to the release of certificates for 900 Jewish children and 100 adults for transfer from Hungary, fearing they might end up in Palestine. He suggested that if such transfers of population were deemed necessary, then:I ask your Excellency to permit me to <b>draw</b> <b>your</b> <b>attention</b> to the necessity of preventing the Jews from leaving your country for Palestine, and if there are reasons which make their removal necessary, it would be indispensable and infinitely preferable to send them to other countries where they would find themselves under active control, for example, in Poland, thus avoiding danger and preventing damage." ...|$|E
