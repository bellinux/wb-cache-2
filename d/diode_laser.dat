5|$|Rubidium {{compounds}} {{are sometimes}} used in fireworks {{to give them}} a purple color. Rubidium has also been considered for use in a thermoelectric generator using the magnetohydrodynamic principle, where rubidium ions are formed by heat at high temperature and passed through a magnetic field. These conduct electricity and act like an armature of a generator thereby generating an electric current. Rubidium, particularly vaporized 87Rb, {{is one of the most}} commonly used atomic species employed for laser cooling and Bose–Einstein condensation. Its desirable features for this application include the ready availability of inexpensive <b>diode</b> <b>laser</b> light at the relevant wavelength, and the moderate temperatures required to obtain substantial vapor pressures. For cold atom applications requiring tunable interactions, 85Rb is preferable due to its rich Feshbach spectrum.|$|E

25|$|Many of the {{advances}} in reliability of diode lasers {{in the last}} 20 years remain proprietary to their developers. The reliability of a laser diode {{can make or break}} a product line. Moreover, reverse engineering is not always able to reveal the differences between more-reliable and less-reliable <b>diode</b> <b>laser</b> products.|$|E
25|$|Another {{method of}} {{powering}} some diode lasers {{is the use}} of optical pumping. Optically pumped semiconductor lasers (OPSL) use a III-V semiconductor chip as the gain medium, and another laser (often another <b>diode</b> <b>laser)</b> as the pump source. OPSL offer several advantages over ILDs, particularly in wavelength selection and lack of interference from internal electrode structures.|$|E

The development of CRDS was first reported by O’Keefe et al. in 1988. In 1999, Kerstel et al. successfully applied this technique to determine D/H in water sample. The system consists of a laser and a cavity equipped with high finesse reflectivity mirrors. Laser light is injected into the cavity, at which the resonance takes place due to the constructive interference. The laser then is turn off. The decay of light intensity is measured. In the presence of a water sample, the photo-absorption by water isotopologues follows the kinetic law. The optical spectrum is obtained by recording ring-down time of the H2O spectral features of interest at certain laser wavelength. The concentration of each isotopologue is proportional to the area under each measured isotopologue spectral feature.|$|E

25|$|Diode lasers of {{that era}} {{operated}} with threshold current densities of 1000 A/cm2 at 77 K temperatures. Such performance enabled continuous-lasing to be demonstrated in the earliest days. However, when operated at room temperature, about 300 K, threshold current densities were two orders of magnitude greater, or 100,000 A/cm2 in the best devices. The dominant challenge {{for the remainder of}} the 1960s was to obtain low threshold current density at 300 K and thereby to demonstrate continuous-wave lasing at room temperature from a <b>diode</b> <b>laser.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{laser diode}} is {{electrically}} a PIN diode. The active {{region of the}} laser diode is in the intrinsic (I) region, and the carriers (electrons and holes) are pumped into that region from the N and P regions respectively. While initial <b>diode</b> <b>laser</b> research was conducted on simple P-N diodes, all modern lasers use the double-hetero-structure implementation, where the carriers and the photons are confined {{in order to maximize}} their chances for recombination and light generation. Unlike a regular diode, the goal for a laser diode is to recombine all carriers in the I region, and produce light. Thus, laser diodes are fabricated using direct band-gap semiconductors. The laser diode epitaxial structure is grown using one of the crystal growth techniques, usually starting from an N doped substrate, and growing the I doped active layer, followed by the P doped cladding, and a contact layer. The active layer most often consists of quantum wells, which provide lower threshold current and higher efficiency.|$|E

2500|$|Several workers {{demonstrated}} optically pumped VECSELs, {{and they}} continue to be developed for many applications including high power sources for use in industrial machining (cutting, punching, etc.) because of their unusually high power and efficiency when pumped by multi-mode <b>diode</b> <b>laser</b> bars.

2500|$|At {{the edge}} of a <b>diode</b> <b>laser,</b> where light is emitted, a mirror is {{traditionally}} formed by cleaving the semiconductor wafer to form a specularly reflecting plane. This approach is facilitated by the weakness of the [...] crystallographic plane in III-V semiconductor crystals (such as GaAs, InP, GaSb, etc.) compared to other planes. A scratch made at {{the edge of}} the wafer and a slight bending force causes a nearly atomically perfect mirror-like cleavage plane to form and propagate in a straight line across the wafer.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{interesting}} features of any VECSEL is the small thickness of the semiconductor gain region in the direction of propagation, less than 100nm. In contrast, a conventional in-plane semiconductor laser entails light propagation over distances of from 250µm upward to 2mm or longer. The significance of the short propagation distance is that it causes the effect of [...] "antiguiding" [...] nonlinearities in the <b>diode</b> <b>laser</b> gain region to be minimized. The result is a large-cross-section single-mode optical beam which is not attainable from in-plane ("edge-emitting") diode lasers.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the absence}} of stimulated {{emission}} (e.g., lasing) conditions, electrons and holes may coexist in proximity to one another, without recombining, for a certain time, termed the [...] "upper-state lifetime" [...] or [...] "recombination time" [...] (about a nanosecond for typical <b>diode</b> <b>laser</b> materials), before they recombine. A nearby photon with energy equal to the recombination energy can cause recombination by stimulated emission. This generates another photon of the same frequency, polarization, and phase, travelling {{in the same direction}} as the first photon. This means that stimulated emission will cause gain in an optical wave (of the correct wavelength) in the injection region, and the gain increases as the number of electrons and holes injected across the junction increases.
