40|$|Due to the {{benefits}} of diversity, autonomous ecosystem management and careful farmers' stewardship, pest and disease control doesn't pose a profound problem in ecological agriculture practice. However, during the conversion period, and in ecological horticulture, particularly in fruit growing, this preventive control is often not sufficient enough, and additional control, mostly (curative) spraying is needed. This need for additional pest and <b>disease</b> <b>control</b> (<b>spraying)</b> in ecological horticulture, may be linked with our incomplete {{understanding of the role}} of those subsystems in the agro-ecosystem as a whole. Currently, organic standards normally do specify permitted (environmental friendly, mainly natural substances), prohibited (synthetic pesticides), and sprays whose use is restricted (like natural, broad spectrum pesticides). Unfortunately, the list of, and the elaboration on these sprays, differ even between those standards (or standards of the same organisation in different countries) which are perceived as mutually compatible. This incompatibility indicates that {{there is a lack of}} both practical and theoretical certainty in regard to this matter. This situation results in an expand of countless anonymous "recipes" of "eco-sprays" with questionable effectiveness. Therefore, this paper tries to cast some more light on the types, origin, formulation, mode of action, efficiency and environmental effects of some most common eco-sprays. Additionally, constraints for their practical use and further improvement, which are not primarily of technological, but rather of economic, juridical (regulative) and ethical nature are discussed. Once these, non technological constraints were lifted, due to their great pesticide potential, as demonstrated in numerous relevant studies, "eco-sprays" could become much more reliable than now. Such accurate "eco-sprays" would than serve as a tool which offers more assurance to ecological fruit growers and eco-farmers, particularly during conversion period. Therefore, in order to facilitate the elimination of current barriers for more productive use of "eco-sprays", it is deemed essential to establish an international network (IFOAM task force) which should stimulate a dialogue on these issues between farmers, scientists, industry and policy makers worldwide. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was to investigate BiOWiSHTM-Aqua, a commercial dry solid formulation containing a consortium of bacteria and yeast, as a biopesticide for treatment of Botrytis cinerea, a gray mold that affects strawberries. BiOWiSHTM-Aqua was compared with another commercial product specifically used as a fungicide and bacteriocide, Serenade® Garden <b>Disease</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Spray</b> (concentrated Bacillus subtilis strain QST 713). Both laboratory tests {{as well as in}} vivo lab tests were conducted. BiOWiSHTM-Aqua results varied widely from plate to plate, regardless of experimental conditions. In some of these plates, inhibition zones were observed around colonies from BiOWiSHTM-Aqua, indicating efficacy. The organism responsible for the inhibition zones of B. cinerea growth was isolated from BiOWiSHTM-Aqua, and 16 s rRNA analysis identified this culture as a strain of B. subtilis. This strain was designated as B. subtilis ssp. KLB. The B. subtilis KLB concentration required to completely inhibit B. cinerea was 9. 1 x 104 CFU/mL when B. subtilis KLB was inoculated 48 hours before B. cinerea, 1. 3 x 105 CFU/mL at 24 hours, and 3. 2 x 106 CFU/mL when both were inoculated at the same time. Various preliminary experiments using B. subtilis KLB were also conducted to investigate its economic feasibility, to characterize the organism, and to test its post-harvest in vivo viability. B. subtilis KLB cell concentration was 1. 6 x 109 CFU/mL in a bioreactor with LB {{at the end of the}} log growth phase. B. subtilis KLB achieved cell concentrations as high as 5 x 109 CFU/mL in shake flasks with food-grade tapioca as a carbon source. Inoculation of B. subtilis KLB on post-harvest strawberries did not have an effect on Botrytis infection rates compared to the negative control. These various experiments were the first step in research to potentially produce B. subtilis KLB on a commercial scale...|$|R
40|$|The {{benefit of}} windbreaks and copper <b>sprays</b> for <b>control</b> of citrus canker caused by Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri was {{investigated}} in a commercial citrus orchard located in a citrus canker endemic area in southern Brazil. Control of canker was evaluated as incidence and severity of lesions on foliage and by the effect on premature leaf and fruit drop for three production seasons. Effect of the treatments on fruit production was evaluated as incidence of citrus canker on prematurely abscised fruits and harvested fruits. Copper application significantly reduced damage to foliage and fruit, while windbreaks made little contribution to <b>disease</b> <b>control.</b> Copper <b>sprays</b> increased fruit yield for 3 years. This {{could be attributed to}} lower incidence of fruit with lesions and fewer fruits abscised due to canker infection.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Citrus {{black spot}} (CBS) caused by Guignardia citricarpa {{is one of}} the most serious Brazilian citrus diseases. This study aims to assess the {{interference}} of three application volumes in spray deposition citrus fruit, as well as fruit growth and rainfall effects on spray deposit reduction during the CBS control period. The experiment was carried out in a commercial citrus orchard, with sixteen-year-old trees of the Valencia variety, in Mogi Guaçu, São Paulo State, Brazil. The spray volumes were: 3. 5 (1333 L ha- 1), 4. 5 (1714 L ha- 1) and 8. 5 (3238 L ha- 1) litres per tree, sprayed by an airblast sprayer using fungicides at recommended periods for <b>disease</b> <b>control.</b> The <b>spray</b> deposition quantification and residue was done by spectrophotometry using a copper oxychloride tracer. Samples were collected in three height zones of the tree (top, middle and bottom) and placed between trees on line plantation. Spray depositions were significantly smaller in the first application as a consequence of reduced fruit size. The spray losses on average for each day of rainfall ranged from 4. 0 to 5. 7 %. There was no significant difference between application volumes regarding spray deposition on citrus fruit,which makes possible the reduction of application volumes, however, it is necessary to improve spraying techniques for the top zone of the citrus tree...|$|R

40|$|Citrus canker, {{caused by}} Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri, {{is a serious}} and wide-spread disease of citrus, causing losses in fruit yield and quality. There are no highly {{effective}} citrus canker <b>disease</b> <b>control</b> measures. Repeated <b>spray</b> applications of copper are often employed to protect fruit from bacterial infection with consequences for copper phytotoxicity and accumulation in the soil. Alternatively, innate plant defense mechanisms can be enhanced by plant treatments with specific natural and synthetic inducers for <b>control</b> of bacterial <b>diseases.</b> In this study, hexanoic acid applied as a soil drench or foliar spray on 9 -month-old potted citrus trees reduced lesions on leaves by 50 % compared with control plants. Disease-reducing activity lasted up to 50 days after application. Induction of resistance mediated by hexanoic acid was demonstrated by enhanced expression of Pathogenesis-related (PR) genes and callose deposition in treated and infected plants. These findings indicated that hexanoic acid applications trigger a defensive response in the plants. The application of this natural compound may have potential for management of citrus canker {{in conjunction with other}} <b>disease</b> <b>control</b> measures and may reduce the frequency or rate of copper bactericides.

40|$|Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs) often {{suffer from}} {{intermittent}} disruption and variable long delay due to {{factors such as}} mobility and energy. In this paper, a Location Aided <b>Controlled</b> <b>Spraying</b> (LACS) routing algorithm is proposed {{to deal with the}} challenging issues in DTN routing. Only the routing information carried by the contacted nodes is needed in this algorithm, and {{there is no need for}} global networks knowledge and hardware support. The routing process is divided into two stages, i. e., <b>controlled</b> <b>spraying</b> routing stage and single-copy routing stage. The maximum transfer throughput of the contact is checked before each message is forwarded. During the <b>controlled</b> <b>spraying</b> stage, the current node adjusts spraying strategy according to the encounter angle of the contact nodes. During the single-copy stage, a location prediction model based on the semi-Markov process (SMP) is introduced, and the node's behaviors can be captured both in the temporal and spatial domains with this model. The current node predicts the destination node's location, and then decides whether to forward the message to target node based on the time used for meeting the destination node. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve better performance than the traditional routing schemes of DTNs in terms of delivery ratio, network overhead and transmission delay under both random node movement model and realistic trace scenario...|$|R

40|$|Background & objectives: Biting {{behaviour}} of Anopheles funestus in Mutare and Mutasa districts, Zimbabwe, {{is little}} understood. An investigation {{was conducted to}} primarily compare indoor and outdoor biting behaviour of the mosquito, as well as blood meal sources and sporozoite rates. Methods: Monthly adult anopheline sampling was conducted from October 2013 to September 2014 using Centers for <b>Disease</b> <b>Control</b> light-traps, pyrethrum <b>spray</b> catch and artificial pit shelter methods. Mosquitoes sampled by light-traps {{were divided into two}} cohorts. In one cohort, traps were left overnight and mosquitoes were collected the following morning, while in the other set, mosquitoes were collected hourly from 1800 - 0600 hrs. Collected females were identified using morphological characters and categorised according to their abdominal status. Polymerase chain reaction was used to identify An. funestus sibling species and blood meal sources. Infection rate was tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: Morphological identification showed that indoor and outdoor catches comprised Anopheles funestus (98. 3 %) and Anopheles gambiae s. l. (1. 7 %). Of the 2268 mosquitoes collected, 66. 2 % were caught by light-traps, and 33. 8 % were caught resting indoors and outdoors. Anopheles funestus and An. gambiae s. l. were trapped more abundantly indoors (68 %) than outdoors (32 %). Both indoor and outdoor An. funestus densities were higher in wet (4. 3) than dry season (1. 8). In Burma Valley and Zindi areas, An. funestus demonstrated variable nocturnal indoor and outdoor flight activity rhythms, with two peaks during the night; between 2200 - 2300 hrs and 0200 - 0400 hrs. Human blood index in An. funestus was 0. 64, with Plasmodium falciparum infection rate of 1. 8 %. Interpretation & conclusion: The present work highlighted important information on the host-seeking behaviour, blood meal sources and infection rates in An. funestus. The information would be helpful in improving the vector control strategies...|$|R
